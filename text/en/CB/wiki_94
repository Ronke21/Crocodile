<text>A &quot;V&quot; device is a metal capital letter &quot;V&quot; with serifs which, when worn on certain decorations awarded by the United States Armed Forces, distinguishes a decoration awarded for combat valor or heroism from the same decoration being awarded for a member&#x27;s actions under circumstances other than combat.

The decorations with which a &quot;V&quot; may be authorized differ among the military services, as well as the manner in which the &quot;V&quot; is worn and the name by which it is referred to. Until 2017, each service also used different criteria in determining whether a &quot;V&quot; could be authorized.

==Etymology==
The Department of Defense, Army, and Air Force refer to the &quot;V&quot; as the &quot;V&quot; device. The Coast Guard refers to it as the Valor Device, while the Navy and Marine Corps refer to it as the Combat Distinguishing Device or Combat &quot;V&quot;. When referring to a medal that has been awarded with the &quot;V&quot; device, it is often referred to as having been awarded &quot;with valor&quot;.

== History ==

On 22 December 1945, in War Department Circular 383, the United States Army decided to introduce the &quot;V&quot; device to distinguish the award of a Bronze Star Medal for acts of valor and heroism, rather than meritorious service. Soldiers, including Army airmen, who were awarded the Bronze Star Medal for heroism in combat were now authorized to wear a bronze &quot;V&quot; on the suspension and service ribbon of the medal. Only one &quot;V&quot; was allowed to be worn on a ribbon. The Department of the Navy introduced the &quot;V&quot; as the &quot;Combat Distinguishing Device&quot;, and on 15 February 1946, authorized the &quot;V&quot; device to be worn on the Legion of Merit and Bronze Star Medal for services or acts performed in actual combat with the enemy; in February 1947, this was changed to acts or services involving direct participation in combat operations.
Most World War II veterans who were entitled to the &quot;V&quot; probably did not know about or apply for the device, since large-scale separations from the services were taking place after the war ended. Stocks of the device also were not available for issue for at least a year after the issuance of the Army circular.

To be worn on a decoration, the &quot;V&quot; device must have been specifically authorized in the written award citation issued with the medal. In 1996, the &quot;V&quot; device garnered public attention after the suicide of Admiral Jeremy Boorda, who was the Chief of Naval Operations. The news media reported that his death by suicide may have been caused by a Navy investigation following a story by &quot;Newsweek&quot; about Boorda wearing two &quot;combat valor pins&quot; on the service ribbons of his uniform, which he received for duty as a weapons officer and executive officer aboard two naval ships off the coast of Indochina during the Vietnam War. Although there were indications these &quot;combat distinguishing devices&quot; were authorized to be worn on his Navy Commendation Medal and Navy Achievement Medal, the Department of the Navy Board For Correction of Naval Records determined after his death that both of the devices were not authorized to be worn on the two decorations.

In 2011, the Department of Defense changed its awards manual regulations concerning the Medal of Honor (MOH), specifying that the &quot;V&quot; device instead of the oak leaf cluster and inch star would be used to denote additional citations in the rare event of a service member being awarded a second MOH. By May 2015, the Department of Defense changed its awards manual again concerning the MOH, specifying that a separate MOH is presented to an individual for each succeeding act that justifies an award. There has not been a living repeat MOH recipient since the World War I era, so the &quot;V&quot; device has yet to be worn in this fashion by a living recipient.

Until 2017, the criteria and conditions under which the &quot;V&quot; device could be awarded differed among the services. For the Army, the &quot;V&quot; was worn solely to denote &quot;participation in acts of heroism involving conflict with an armed enemy&quot;. For the Navy, Marine Corps, and Coast Guard, the &quot;V&quot; could be worn to denote combat heroism, or to recognize individuals who were &quot;exposed to personal hazard during direct participation in combat operations&quot;. For the Air Force, the &quot;V&quot; could be worn on the Bronze Star Medal to denote heroism in combat, but also on the Commendation Medal and Achievement Medal to denote heroism or for being &quot;placed in harm&#x27;s way&quot; during contingency deployment operations.

Prior to 1 January 2014, the device was also authorized on Outstanding Unit Awards and Organizational Excellence Awards to indicate the unit participated in direct combat support actions. The &quot;V&quot; device is also authorized for the Air Medal by all the services where heroism in aerial combat was involved on an individual mission. On 15 August 2016, the Coast Guard changed their criteria such that new awards of the &quot;V&quot; would be for valor only, to denote a heroic act or acts while participating in conflict or combat with an armed enemy. On 6 January 2016, the Department of Defense announced that it was revising its military decorations and awards program to include a &quot;V&quot; device change to its original 1940s use of denoting heroism in combat only on specific decorations for the military services. Two new &quot;C&quot; and &quot;R&quot; devices will also be used on relevant awards.

===Device changes===
On 2 February 2017, new silver-plated and gold-plated &quot;V&quot; devices were introduced, followed by wreathed versions in September which led to speculation that the various versions of the &quot;V&quot; device would now indicate how many times a specific medal was awarded with the &quot;V.&quot; The U.S. Air Force uniform regulations update of 15 April 2019, was the first to describe and depict the new &quot;V&quot; devices as follows:
On 21 December 2016, the &quot;V&quot; device ceased being authorized for Achievement Medals. Retroactive to January 2016, the &quot;V&quot; device ceased being authorized for the Legion of Merit, being replaced by the &quot;C&quot; device.

== Decorations eligible for the &quot;V&quot; device ==
Currently, the following decorations of the United States Armed Forces are eligible to be awarded with a &quot;V&quot; device.
== Army, Air Force and Space Force ==
For the Army and the Air Force, the &quot;V&quot; is positioned to the right of any bronze or silver oak leaf clusters from the wearer&#x27;s perspective, or positioned in the center of the service ribbon if worn alone.
Only 4 devices may be worn per ribbon; an additional ribbon is worn to the wearer&#x27;s left when necessary to support additional devices:
== Navy, Marine Corps, and Coast Guard ==
For the Navy, Marine Corps, and Coast Guard, the &quot;V&quot; is always worn in the center of the service ribbon, while any gold or silver Inch Stars are added in balance to the right and left of the &quot;V&quot; starting with the right side from the wearer&#x27;s perspective. Marine Corps refer to it as Combat Distinguishing Device.
The Navy, Marine Corps, and Coast Guard continue to award and issue the bronze version. The Marine Corps allows anodized medals and anodized Combat &quot;V&quot;s to be worn on the dress blues uniform. 
== Combined with Arabic numerals ==
Golden or brass Arabic numerals may be used to indicate the total number of times the medal was awarded if the total number of devices, of any types, exceed 4 total devices and would thus not fit on a single ribbon.

<text>The Bureau of Intelligence and Research (INR) is an intelligence agency in the United States Department of State. Its central mission is to provide all-source intelligence and analysis in support of U.S. diplomacy and foreign policy. INR is the oldest civilian element of the U.S. Intelligence Community and among the smallest, with roughly 300 personnel. Though lacking the resources and technology of other U.S. intelligence agencies, it is &quot;one of the most highly regarded&quot; for the quality of its work. 

INR is descended from the [[Research and Analysis Branch]] (R&amp;A) of the World War II-era Office of Strategic Services (OSS), which was tasked with identifying the strengths and weaknesses of the Axis powers. Widely recognized as the most valuable component of the OSS, upon its dissolution in 1945, R&amp;A assets and personnel were transferred to the State Department, forming the Office of Intelligence Research. INR was reorganized into its current form in 1947. 

In addition to supporting the policies and initiatives of the State Department, INR contributes to the President&#x27;s Daily Briefings (PDB) and serves as the federal government&#x27;s primary source of foreign public opinion research and analysis. INR is primarily analytical and does not engage in counterintelligence or espionage, instead utilizing intelligence collected by other agencies, Foreign Service reports and open-source materials, such as news media and academic publications. INR reviews and publishes nearly two million reports and produces about 3,500 intelligence assessments annually. 

The INR is headed by the assistant secretary of state for intelligence and research reporting directly to the secretary of state and serves as the secretary&#x27;s primary intelligence advisor. In March 2021, President Joe Biden nominated Brett Holmgren to lead INR.

==History==
INR has played a key role in the US intelligence community.

=== Review of covert actions during the Johnson administration ===
In 1967, the INR played an important role in an internal governmental review of covert operations oversight. In early 1967, in the wake of news reports regarding CIA interference in domestic affairs and efforts to assassinate Castro, the Johnson White House ordered the Justice Department to investigate CIA ties to private voluntary organizations in the US. It was increasingly clear, writes journalist Tim Weiner, that “[t]he mechanisms created to watch over the CIA and to invest its clandestine service with presidential authority were not working.” The INR provided a memo to Deputy Under Secretary of State for Political Affairs Foy D. Kohler dated February 15, 1967. The memo identified several weaknesses in the oversight and management of the CIA’s “5412 activities” (which refers to an NSC Directive 5412/2 of December 28, 1955 authorizing the CIA to conduct foreign covert actions). While concluding the procedures of the 303 Committee “are not too bad except for the shortness of time for staffing” the INR memo went on to point out that some covert activities “lack adequate detail on how certain programs are to be carried out and we lack continuing review of major ongoing programs in the light of changing circumstances.” The memo made a number of recommendations to improve oversight by the 303 Committee and to revisit procedures for the “handling of 5412 activities.” Later that year, INR’s director Thomas L. Hughes made recommendations to revise NSC 5412 in order “to deal more explicitly with the risks, consequences, and alternatives of covert operations” among other reasons. Among the recommended changes to NSC 5412 are the need for the U.S. to maintain plausible deniability for covert actions as well as an acknowledgment that covert actions “carry the serious long-term risk of eroding or negating [legal and social] principles, which are fundamental to the achievement of long-range United States objectives.” Therefore, “United States policy to keep covert operations to an irreducible minimum, and to undertake a covert operation only when it is determined, after careful consideration, that the prospective results (a) are essential to national security or national interests; (b) are of such value as significantly to outweigh the risks, both immediate and long-term; and (c) cannot be effectively obtained in any other way.” (see Memorandum From the Director of the Bureau of Intelligence and Research (Hughes) to the Deputy Under Secretary of State for Political Affairs (Kohler)). Hughes discussed these recommendations with Secretary of State Dean Rusk and Assistant AG Nick Katzenbach on May 5, 1967. However, NSC 5412 was not revised during the Johnson administration. 

=== Vietnam War ===
In May 2004, the National Security Archive released a highly classified review of INR&#x27;s written analysis of the Vietnam War during the 1960s commissioned in 1969 by then-INR director Thomas L. Hughes. The INR written analysis was a 596 page study examining US decisions made during the Vietnam War. Some notable information within the review included pointing out the INR relied on circumstansial evidence to blame the North Vietnamese for maliciously attacking the US during the Gulf of Tonkin Incident. The review showed that INR had repeatedly warned of the weaknesses of the South Vietnamese Government and of the failing US strategy in Vietnam, and that, despite pressure from the military and Pentagon, INR had portrayed and projected the course of the war more accurately than any other source. That being said, there are instances within the review noting events the INR could not have predicted, one of the most infamous being the Tet Offensive in 1968; &quot;Nothing, however... of the situation led INR to anticipate the scope or nature of the Tet Offensive.&quot; Still, the majority of the INR&#x27;s findings were accurate to the course of the war and highlighted the poor intelligence gathering of the CIA in comparison. An annex within the review was dedicated to critiquing the CIA&#x27;s decision in intelligence gathering and the conflict the CIA had with the Defense Intelligence Agency.

=== Iraq War ===
In July 2004, the United States Senate Select Committee on Intelligence issued a scathing report on prewar intelligence on Iraq. INR was spared the poor performance review that most other intelligence agencies received, and the panel specifically endorsed the dissent that INR inserted into the National Intelligence Estimate of 2002. The bureau was being studied as a positive example as Congress debated how to best reform U.S. intelligence agencies in the wake of the 2003 invasion of Iraq.

=== Myer arrest (2009) ===
In June 2009, the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) arrested former INR employee Walter Kendall Myers on charges of serving as an illegal agent of the Cuban government for nearly 30 years and conspiring to provide classified U.S. information to the Cuban government. Myers had worked in the INR from 2000 to 2007. His arrest was the culmination of a three-year joint investigation by the FBI and the Department of State Diplomatic Security Service. 

=== 2022 Russian invasion of Ukraine ===
INR was the only US intelligence agency to dissent from the consensus that Kyiv would fall in a few days during the 2022 Russian invasion of Ukraine. Although it agreed with other agencies in overestimating Russian military capability, unlike the others INR used growing Ukrainian willingness to fight in opinion surveys to predict that the country would strongly resist the invasion.

==Mission==

The primary mission of the INR is to provide all-source intelligence to support U.S. diplomats. This is achieved through all-source analysis, intelligence policy and coordination, polling and media analysis, and conferences and workshops to integrate outside expertise. As the nexus of intelligence and foreign policy, it plays a key role in ensuring that intelligence activities are consistent with U.S. foreign policy, and that other components of the Intelligence Community (IC) understand the information and analysis needs of senior foreign policy decision makers. INR&#x27;s portfolio is as broad and diverse as the secretary&#x27;s global agenda. As a result, INR employs experts who understand current policy concerns as well as the historical context to provide input to policymakers and timely guidance to the IC. 
Officially, INR intelligence is aimed at ensuring that diplomats, policymakers, and other government officials have access to focused intelligence products that will help advance U.S. foreign policy, namely to build democracies, promote economic stability, provide humanitarian assistance, and combat terrorism, disease, and the proliferation of Weapons of Mass Destruction (WMD) around the world. 
INR is the department&#x27;s principal liaison with the Office of the Director of National Intelligence (ODNI). Since the creation of the ODNI, there have been many changes in the IC, including more attention to customer needs, new standards for information sharing, and initiatives regarding analytic standards. INR participates in a wide variety of working groups and committees on behalf of the Department of State, and INR analysts participate in the drafting of IC assessments and analyses.

==Priorities==

* Expanding electronic dissemination of intelligence so that Department policymakers can access intelligence quickly and securely from the desktop; 
* Creating and maintaining an expert workforce through recruitment, training, and professional development in support of the national security mission; 
* Tracking and analyzing issues that may undermine efforts to promote peace and security such as terrorism, the spread of WMD, and trafficking in humans and illicit drugs; 
* Playing a key role in the IC to optimize intelligence collection and requirements so that current and future diplomatic information needs are met, resulting in enhanced intelligence support for policymakers; 
* Increasing collaboration and information sharing on humanitarian issues through the interagency Humanitarian Information Unit; 
* Serving as a leader in the USG for foreign public opinion surveys and polls that will help inform the USG’s public diplomacy initiatives; and 
* Providing all-source analyses and assessments that examine trends in governance, democracy, and human rights and assess domestic policies and leadership performance in countries of interest.

<text>What&#x27;s Happening Now!! is an American sitcom sequel to the original ABC 1976–1979 sitcom &quot;What&#x27;s Happening!!&quot; focusing on its main characters as independent people. It aired in first-run broadcast syndication from September 7, 1985 until March 26, 1988.

==Premise==
In the series, Roger &quot;Raj&quot; Thomas (Ernest Thomas) has graduated from the University of Southern California, and become a fledgling writer. He and his new wife Nadine (Anne-Marie Johnson), a social worker, move in to his old home in Watts (given to him by his mother, Mabel Thomas (Mabel King), now remarried and living in Phoenix, Arizona). His sister, Dee (Danielle Spencer), is away at college. Childhood friend, Dwayne Nelson (Haywood Nelson), has become a computer programmer, while Freddie &quot;Rerun&quot; Stubbs (Fred Berry) is now a used-car salesman. The old soda shop hangout, Rob&#x27;s Place, has gone out of business and has been left abandoned. Reminded of his youth, and seeing an opportunity, Raj and Shirley Wilson (Shirley Hemphill), who used to wait tables there, decide to buy the business together, renaming it &quot;Rob&#x27;s.&quot;

<text>Jacques Pierre Paul Raverat (pronounced Rav-er-ah) (20 March 1885 – 6 March 1925) was a French painter; Raverat was the son of Georges Pierre Raverat and Helena Lorena Raverat, née Caron; he was born in Paris, France, in 1885.

Raverat started at Bedales School in Steep, Hampshire in 1898. From Bedales, he went up to Jesus College, Cambridge.

He married the English painter and wood engraver Gwen Darwin, in 1911, the daughter of George Darwin and Lady Maud Darwin, née Maud du Puy; she was a granddaughter of Charles Darwin. They had two daughters, Elisabeth (1916–2014), who married the Norwegian politician Edvard Hambro, and Sophie Jane (1919–2011) who married the Cambridge scholar M. G. M. Pryor and later Charles Gurney. Raverat suffered from a form of multiple sclerosis and died on 6 March 1925, following complications of it. His funeral took place in Christ Church in Cannes, France, where he may be buried.

Before moving, in 1920, to Vence in France the couple were active members of an intellectual circle known as the &quot;Neo-Pagans&quot; and centred on Rupert Brooke. They also moved on the fringes of the Bloomsbury Group, whose members included Virginia Woolf, John Maynard Keynes, Vanessa Bell and Lytton Strachey.

In 2004, his grandson, William Pryor edited the complete correspondence between Raverat, his wife and Virginia Woolf which was published as &quot;Virginia Woolf and the Raverats&quot;.

<doc id="842673" wikidata="Q157184" url="?curid=842673" title="Astragalus (plant)">
<text>Astragalus is a large genus of over 3,000 species of herbs and small shrubs, belonging to the legume family Fabaceae and the subfamily Faboideae. It is the largest genus of plants in terms of described species. The genus is native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. Common names include milkvetch (most species), locoweed (in North America, some species) and goat&#x27;s-thorn (&quot;A. gummifer&quot;, &quot;A. tragacantha&quot;). Some pale-flowered vetches (&quot;Vicia&quot; spp.) are similar in appearance, but they are more vine-like than &quot;Astragalus&quot;.

==Description==
Most species in the genus have pinnately compound leaves. There are annual and perennial species. The flowers are formed in clusters in a raceme, each flower typical of the legume family, with three types of petals: banner, wings, and keel. The calyx is tubular or bell-shaped.

==Taxonomy==
The genus was formally described in 1753 by Carl Linnaeus in his &quot;Species Plantarum&quot;.

The name &quot;Astragalus&quot; is Greek, an old name for this group of plants which were believed to have a positive effect on goat milk production.

===Selected species===


==Ecology==
&quot;Astragalus&quot; species are used as food plants by the larvae of some Lepidoptera species including many case-bearing moths of the genus &quot;Coleophora&quot;: &quot;C. cartilaginella&quot;, &quot;C. colutella&quot;, &quot;C. euryaula&quot;, and &quot;C. onobrychiella&quot; feed exclusively on &quot;Astragalus&quot;, &quot;C. astragalella&quot; and &quot;C. gallipennella&quot; feed exclusively on the species &quot;Astragalus glycyphyllos&quot;, and &quot;C. hippodromica&quot; is limited to &quot;Astragalus gombo&quot;.

==Uses==
===Traditional medicine===
Astragalus has been used in traditional Chinese medicine over centuries to treat various disorders, but there is no high-quality evidence that it is effective or safe for any medical purpose.

===Phytochemicals and supplements===
Extracts of astragalus root include diverse phytochemicals, such as saponins and isoflavone flavonoids, which are purported in traditional practices to increase lactation in nursing mothers. There is no valid clinical evidence to indicate such use is effective or safe for the mother or infant. Dietary supplement products containing astragalus extracts may not have been adequately tested for efficacy, safety, purity or consistency. The root extracts of astragalus may be used in soups, teas or sold in capsules.

===Side effects and toxicology===
Although astragalus supplements are generally well tolerated, mild gastrointestinal upset, diarrhea, and allergic reactions may occur. Because astragalus may affect regulation of blood sugar and blood pressure, it may be risky for people with blood disorders, diabetes, or hypertension to use it as a supplement. Astragalus may interact with prescribed drugs that suppress the immune system, such as medications used by people being treated for cancer or recovery from organ transplants.

Some astragalus species can be toxic, such as those found in the United States containing the neurotoxin swainsonine, which causes &quot;locoweed&quot; poisoning in animals. Some astragalus species may contain high levels of selenium, possibly causing toxicity.

===Ornamental use===
Several species, including &quot;A. alpinus&quot; (bluish-purple flowers), &quot;A. hypoglottis&quot; (purple flowers), and &quot;A. lotoides&quot;, are grown as ornamental plants in gardens.

<doc id="842678" wikidata="Q788517" url="?curid=842678" title="Penalty (rugby)">
<text>In rugby football, the penalty is the main disciplinary sanction available to the referee to penalise players who commit deliberate infringements. The team who did not commit the infringement are given possession of the ball and may either kick it towards touch (in which case the ball back rule is waived), attempt a place kick at goal, or tap the ball with their foot and run it. It is also sometimes used as shorthand for &quot;penalty goal&quot;.

==Penalties in rugby union==
The referee signals that he has awarded a penalty to a side by raising his arm at 45 degrees between vertical and horizontal and blowing a blast on his whistle. The arm is raised on the side that won the penalty. Penalties may be awarded for a number of offences, including:

* Failing to release the ball after being tackled, or the tackling player failing to release the tackled player or doing a dangerous tackle on the other player.
* Entering a ruck or maul from the side.
* Leaving one&#x27;s feet in the ruck.
* Deliberately collapsing a scrum or illegally collapsing a maul (see ELV).
* Scrum infringements: not binding properly on an opponent (for prop forwards) or a teammate (for other players); leaving the scrum before the ball has emerged from it; not pushing straight against the opposing pack. 
* Being offside and not making an effort to move to an onside position.
* Tackling infringements: a high tackle (where contact is made above the shoulders); or a player holding a teammate off the ground.
* Violent or Foul play: eye gouge, low blow, elbowing, tripping and so forth.
* Throwing or knocking the ball forwards, or out of play in any direction.
* Tackling or holding an opponent who is not in possession of the ball.
* Obstructing an opponent from tackling the ball-carrier (blocking).
* Not retreating ten metres at a penalty.
* Contesting or dissenting from a referee&#x27;s decision, or using abusive language or conduct towards any match official.
* Any other action the referee considers to be &quot;contrary to good sportsmanship&quot; (such as throwing the ball away while play is stopped in order to prevent a prompt restart, especially if time is close to expiring).

Referees may not penalise some of these infringements if in their judgement the offending player had no intent to break the rules (e.g. a marginally late tackle on a player who has just kicked or passed the ball) or if the offending player was not participating in or affecting the game (e.g. a player who is in an offside position but not interfering with play). Equally, a referee may warn teams about technical infringements (especially at the scrum and ruck) before penalising them. Many consider a referee&#x27;s willingness and ability to do so as a mark of good officiating in that it reduces stoppages in the game and allows it to &quot;flow&quot;.

The side that is awarded the penalty restarts the game with a kick or scrum at their discretion. If a kick is taken, the side that the penalty was awarded against must retreat 10 metres (or to their goal line if closer). There are four ways of restarting the game;

* A tap penalty, often taken quickly to exploit lack of organisation in the opposition&#x27;s retreating defence, is where a player drops the ball onto his foot and kicks it up into his arms (or puts it on the ground and kicks it a small distance before picking it up again) and then carries the ball forward.
* A kick to touch. The side with the penalty gets the throw-in to the resultant line-out, from which they have a good chance of securing possession. This is used mainly to gain territory though it is also used as a tactic to gain a platform for a rolling maul near the opponent&#x27;s try line and muscle over for a score. The kicker may punt or drop kick for touch.
* A kick at goal. The kick at goal is usually taken off the ground from a sand or plastic tee (though it is possible to drop kick the ball). If it is successful, they score three points, and the opposition restart from the centre line. (In rugby sevens, the scoring team restarts from the centre line.) If the penalty is missed but the ball remains in play, play continues. If the penalty is missed and the ball goes dead a 22 metre drop-out is awarded to the opposition.
* A scrum. A team may opt to have a scrum. This would normally be taken if an attacking team wished to have all the defensive forwards tied up in one place allowing the backs the luxury of a one on one confrontation. Alternatively, if a team has ascendancy in the scrums they may try for a pushover try, which may result in the award of a penalty try if the scrums are deliberately collapsed by the defending side.
* A team awarded a penalty at a lineout may choose a further lineout into which they throw in.

One of the laws associated with penalties was experimented with in association football, that being that penalties may be moved 10 metres forward of their original position either due to talk-back from the players or offside from a quick tap penalty. This was dropped after variable application by referees, but remains a rugby rule.

==Penalties in rugby league==
Penalties operate in roughly the same manner as in union, but with some slight differences. Firstly, the implication is that a side either takes a tap kick or a shot at goal. They can kick for touch, but, if the ball makes it into touch, the side then takes a tap kick 10m infield (20m infield in the NRL as of 2007) from the point where the ball went into touch (except where it goes into touch inside the opposition&#x27;s 10m line, in which case the tap is taken from the 10m line), as opposed to a lineout. They can also tap the ball from where the penalty was awarded. In both instances, the defending side must remain 10m from the ball until the tap kick is taken.

The penalty may also be place-kicked towards goal. If successful, the kicking side scores two points. If the kick is unsuccessful and the ball is caught by the opposition before it leaves the field of play, play continues. If the ball goes into touch-in-goal or over the dead ball line, then play is restarted with a drop-out from the offenders&#x27; 20m line.

Penalties may be awarded for:

* Offside 
* Tackling an opponent above the shoulders
* Tackling an opponent who is not in possession of the ball
* Tackling a player in midair
* Late hits (such as hitting a ballcarrier already taken to ground)
* Obstructing an opponent from tackling the ball-carrier
* Failing to retreat 10m from an opposition play-the-ball
* If marker at the play-the-ball, failing to stand opposite it
* Not playing the ball correctly at a play-the-ball
* Kicking the ball into touch, touch-in-goal, or over the dead ball line on the full from the kick-off
* Crossing the goal line, not sending the ball ten metres, on sending it into touch on the full from a goal-line drop-out
* Dissent (Disputing a Referee&#x27;s decision)

There is also a &quot;differential penalty&quot;, awarded for technical breaches when a scrum is packed (as opposed to foul play within a scrum). A penalty goal cannot be scored from a differential penalty.

<text>The Baojin Expressway/ Jinxiong Expressway () is a highway in north China, linking Baoding in Hebei province with Tianjin municipality.

The expressway was first built in 1995 and opened to the general motoring public in mid-December 1999. It links Baoding, Xushui, Rongcheng and heads east toward Tianjin, linking Xiongxian and Bazhou.

The 129 km-long expressway is designed for a speed that, as of May 2004, is the maximum speed legally tolerated on PRC expressways—120 km/h. (The Tianjin part, though, has a lower speed limit of 110 km/h.)

The western part links with the Jingshi Expressway 118 kilometres after its starting point from Beijing&#x27;s 3rd Ring Road at Liuliqiao. It is not far away from the city of Baoding.

The eastern end links with the Waihuan (Outer Ring) Road in Tianjin, which links to other expressways in the region, such as the Jingjintang Expressway to Beijing and Tanggu, and the Jinghu Expressway to Shanghai.

Three service areas exist along the expressway.</text><links>

<doc id="842685" wikidata="Q2705230" url="?curid=842685" title="The Amazing Adventures of Kavalier &amp; Clay">
<text>The Amazing Adventures of Kavalier &amp; Clay is a 2000 novel by American author Michael Chabon. A historical fiction novel, it follows the lives of two Jewish cousins, Josef &quot;Joe&quot; Kavalier, a Czech artist and magician who escapes Nazi-occupied Prague, and Sammy Clay, a Brooklyn-born writer. Together, they create The Escapist, a fictional superhero inspired by Joe’s desire to fight fascism and his struggle to rescue his family from Europe. Their rise in the comic book industry parallels the Golden Age of American comics, exploring themes of artistic ambition, wartime trauma, Jewish identity, and the power of storytelling. 

The novel was widely praised for its intricate prose, rich historical detail, and blend of realism and adventure. It won the Pulitzer Prize for Fiction in 2001. Scholars and critics have noted its engagement with the history of comic books, its metafictional elements, and its reflections on exile and heroism. 

The novel remains a landmark in contemporary American literature, celebrated for its exploration of history, popular culture, and the immigrant experience. 

==Plot==
The novel opens in 1939, with the arrival of 19-year-old Josef &quot;Joe&quot; Kavalier as a refugee in New York City, where he comes to live with his 17-year-old cousin, Sammy Klayman in Brooklyn. Joe, trained as an escape artist, and Sammy, an aspiring writer, bond over their shared love of art and comics. As the story unfolds, they find their creative niches: entrepreneurial and artistic. Together, Joe and Sammy create the Escapist, an anti-fascist superhero that becomes hugely popular. Despite their success, their employer, Empire Novelty, reap the most financial rewards.

Joe is primarily concerned with rescuing his family, still trapped in Prague. As he becomes romantically involved with Rosa Saks, a bohemian with her own artistic aspirations, Joe&#x27;s drive to help his family shows through in his work, which remains anti-Nazi despite his employer&#x27;s concerns. Meanwhile, Sammy grapples with his sexual identity, eventually entering a secret relationship with Tracy Bacon, the handsome actor who voices the Escapist on the radio.

Joe&#x27;s efforts to bring his family to the States culminate in securing passage for his younger brother Thomas on the ship &quot;The Ark of Miriam&quot;. On the eve of the attack on Pearl Harbor, however, Thomas&#x27;s ship is sunk by a German U-boat. Devastated, Joe abruptly enlists in the Navy, hoping to fight the Nazis, but is instead sent to a secluded naval base in Antarctica. An obstructed chimney fills the base with carbon monoxide, leaving Joe as one of only three survivors.

Parallel to Joe&#x27;s experiences leading up to the United States&#x27; entrance into the war, Tracy is cast as the Escapist for a film adaptation. Sammy moves with him to Hollywood. While there, they attend a private gathering of gay men at a friend&#x27;s beach house, which is raided by the local police. During the raid, all the men at the party are arrested – except for Sammy and another man, who manage to hide under the dinner table. However, the off-duty FBI agents conduct a final sweep, find them both, and sexually abuse them. This leads Sammy to end his relationship with Tracy out of fear of homophobic persecution.

Upon returning to New York, Joe avoids Rosa and Sammy, who have married and are raising Tommy, Joe&#x27;s son, who was born after he left for the war. Tommy, unaware of his father&#x27;s true identity, encounters Joe and begins to secretly take private magic lessons from him in the Empire State Building. This leads to a gradual reunion with Sammy and Rosa, who welcome Joe back into their lives. However, peace is disrupted when Sammy&#x27;s homosexuality is publicly exposed during a Senate investigation into comic books. Despite Joe&#x27;s attempts to rebuild their family (and his purchase of Empire Comics), Sammy decides to leave for Los Angeles to start a new life as a television writer, leaving Joe, Rosa, and Tommy to navigate their complex relationship.

== Inspiration ==
Many events in the novel are based on the lives of actual comic-book creators, including Jack Kirby (to whom the book is dedicated in the afterword), Bob Kane, Stan Lee, Jerry Siegel, Joe Shuster, Joe Simon, Will Eisner and Jim Steranko. Other historical figures play minor roles, including Salvador Dalí, Al Smith, Orson Welles and Fredric Wertham. The novel&#x27;s period roughly mirrors that of the Golden Age of Comics itself, starting from shortly after the debut of Superman and concluding with the Kefauver Senate hearings, two events often used to restrict the era.

==Cultural references==
In the novel, one of the early comics&#x27; covers has a painting of The Escapist punching Adolf Hitler in the jaw (on some editions of the book itself, this is also the cover art). This is a reference to the real-life comic book series &quot;Captain America Comics&quot;, which showed the protagonist punching Hitler on the cover of its first issue, published a year before the attack on Pearl Harbor.

Josef &quot;Joe&quot; Kavalier is referred to in the 2006 novel &quot;The Chinatown Death Cloud Peril&quot; by Paul Malmont. The novel describes the friendship and rivalry among pulp writers of the 1930s; it also includes Lester Dent, Walter B. Gibson, and L. Ron Hubbard.

==Printed editions==
* U.S.: 2000, Random House, hardcover, .
* U.S.: 2001, Picador, paperback, .
* U.S.: 2012, Random House, paperback and e-book, . This edition includes a reader&#x27;s guide and an &quot;Odds &amp; Ends&quot; section containing additional pieces by the author: &quot;Breakfast in the Wreck&quot;, &quot;The Return of the Amazing Cavalieri&quot;, &quot;The Crossover&quot;, and &quot;Fifty Dollars Takes it Home&quot;.

==Reception==
&quot;The Amazing Adventures of Kavalier &amp; Clay&quot; won the Pulitzer Prize for Fiction in 2001 and received widespread critical acclaim.

In &quot;The New York Times&quot;, Ken Kalfus praised the novel as &quot;a comic epic&quot; and &quot;a novel of towering achievement&quot;. Fellow &quot;Times&quot; critic Janet Maslin lauded it as &quot;a big, ripe, excitingly imaginative novel&quot; that maintained its seriousness despite its comic book setting.

Writing in &quot;New York Magazine&quot;, Daniel Mendelsohn identified the novel as a potential Great American Novel, citing its exploration of themes including cultural assimilation, identity, and the role of popular entertainment in American life. Claude Lalumière of &quot;January Magazine&quot; echoed this assessment, praising both its portrayal of the comics industry and its examination of American society from the Depression through the 1950s.

Bret Easton Ellis named it &quot;one of the three great books of [his] generation&quot;, and &quot;The New York Review of Books&quot; deemed it Chabon&#x27;s &quot;magnum opus&quot;. &quot;The Guardian&quot; critic Stephanie Merritt placed it &quot;alongside the best of recent American fiction&quot;.

The novel was featured on &quot;Entertainment Weekly&quot;&#x27;s end-of-decade &quot;best-of&quot; list, praised for combining comic books, Jewish mysticism, and American history. In 2019, &quot;The Guardian&quot; ranked it 57th on its list of the best books of the 21st century, and in 2024, it placed 16th on The New York Times&#x27; 100 Best Books of the 21st Century list, with Andrew Sean Greer calling it &quot;the century&#x27;s first masterpiece&quot;.

The novel was nominated for the 2000 National Book Critics Circle Award and the 2001 PEN/Faulkner Award for Fiction.

== Adaptations ==

===Film===
Producer Scott Rudin bought the screen rights to &quot;The Amazing Adventures of Kavalier &amp; Clay&quot; for Paramount Pictures based on a one-and-a-half page pitch before the novel had been published. (Rudin was involved with the novel so early on that his name appears in the acknowledgments to its first edition.) After the book was published, Chabon was hired to write the screen adaptation. In July 2002, it was reported that the process had taken 16 months and six drafts, none of which pleased Rudin. &quot;It&#x27;s like those arcade games where a gopher head pops out&quot;, Chabon said at the time. &quot;I fix this and then another head pops out.&quot; Rudin explained that his problems with the drafts often derived from scenes in the book he wanted kept in the film and which Chabon, &quot;incredibly unprecious about his work&quot;, had cut.

In their 2002 &quot;It List&quot;, &quot;Entertainment Weekly&quot; declared &quot;Kavalier &amp; Clay&quot; the year&#x27;s &quot;It Script&quot;, publishing a short excerpt from the screenplay. Chabon told the publication, &quot;a lot of things about the book are really a pain in the neck [to adapt]... The story takes place over this huge span of time. There&#x27;s an 11-year gap in the middle when we don&#x27;t see the characters at all. I wrote the first draft of the screenplay from memory, as if there were no novel at all and I were just remembering a story that I had heard... Much less time passes in the movie than in the book. It&#x27;s really just the period of the war.&quot; While at that point, the film was in active pre-production (with Sydney Pollack attached to direct and Jude Law in talks to play Kavalier); by late 2004, Chabon had declared the film project &quot;very much dead&quot;.

In November of that same year, though, director Stephen Daldry announced in &quot;The New York Times&quot; that he planned to direct the film &quot;next year&quot;. In January 2005, Chabon posted on his website that &quot;about a month ago, there was a very brief buzzing, as of a fruit fly, around the film version of &quot;The Amazing Adventures of Kavalier &amp; Clay&quot;. It was a casting-buzz. It went like this: Tobey Maguire as Sam Clay. Jamie Bell as Joe Kavalier. Natalie Portman as Rosa Saks. It buzzed very seriously for about eleven minutes. Then it went away&quot;. Actors Andrew Garfield, Ben Whishaw, Jason Schwartzman and Ryan Gosling were also considered for parts in the project, with Wishaw and Garfield doing scenes for a screen test titled &quot;The Window, Shabbos Dinner, The Return, The Story of the Golem, War Is Over&quot;.

In June 2006, Chabon maintained that Portman was still &quot;a strong likelihood for the part of Rosa&quot;, and listed a number of important plot points present in the book that would be left out of the movie. The list included the scene between Clay and Tracy Bacon in the ruins of the 1939 New York World&#x27;s Fair (though the film would still feature their gay love story), the Long Island scene, and the appearances of Orson Welles and Stan Lee. Chabon added that &quot;whether [this project] will move at last... into really-truly pre-production, with a budget and cast and everything, will be decided on or around 12 July 2006&quot;.

Jamie Caliri, director of music videos and short films, posted two and a half minutes of concept footage on his Vimeo channel, stating, &quot;this piece was made as part of the development process... They asked me to explore animation concepts. I thought it would be much more fun to actually shoot a section of the script to intertwine live action and animation&quot;. In August 2006, however, it was reported that the film had &quot;not been greenlit&quot;. In April 2007, Chabon added that the project &quot;just completely went south for studio-politics kinds of reasons that I&#x27;m not privy to... Right now, as far as I know, there&#x27;s not a lot going on&quot;. In a 2012 interview, Benedict Cumberbatch expressed interest in starring in a possible film adaptation of the book.

===Television===

In a December 2011 interview, Stephen Daldry stated that he was considering making a &quot;Kavalier &amp; Clay&quot; adaptation as a television miniseries rather than a feature film, preferring to do it &quot;on HBO as an eight-parter... If you could put that in the article and ring up HBO and tell them that&#x27;s what I wanna do, I&#x27;d really appreciate it&quot;. In 2019, CBS TV Studios signed a multi-year production pact with Chabon and his wife and writing partner Ayelet Waldman including plans to adapt the novel as a Showtime series. Chabon confirmed in 2020 that he and Waldman were working on the script together, anticipating an initial run of &quot;two eight-episode seasons&quot;.

===Stage===

In 2014, Seattle-based Book-It Repertory Theatre produced a stage adaptation written by Jeff Schwager. The production ran from June 8 to July 13, 2014, and featured a five-hour running time, including a 40-minute meal break.

===Opera===

In 2018, The Metropolitan Opera announced that they were in talks to co-commission an opera based on the novel, with Opera Philadelphia.

In January 12th 2024, Indiana University Jacobs School of Music announced co-production of opera with The Metropolitan Opera through its social media page. Mason Bates will be composing the opera with Gene Scheer on libretto.

In November 15th 2024, Indiana University Jacobs School of Music world-premiered opera conducted by Michael Christie (conductor).

<text>Gwendolen Mary &quot;Gwen&quot; Raverat (née Darwin; 26 August 1885 – 11 February 1957), was an English wood engraver who was a founder member of the Society of Wood Engravers. Her memoir &quot;Period Piece&quot; was published in 1952.

==Biography==

Gwendolen Mary Darwin was born in Cambridge in 1885; she was the daughter of astronomer Sir George Howard Darwin and his wife, Lady Darwin (née Maud du Puy). She was the granddaughter of the naturalist Charles Darwin and a first cousin of poet Frances Cornford (née Darwin).

She married the French painter Jacques Raverat in 1911. They were active in the Bloomsbury Group and Rupert Brooke&#x27;s Neo-Pagan group until they moved to the south of France, where they lived in Vence, near Nice, until his death from multiple sclerosis in 1925. They had two daughters: Elisabeth (1916–2014), who married the Norwegian politician Edvard Hambro, and Sophie Jane (1919–2011), who married the Cambridge scholar M. G. M. Pryor and later Charles Gurney.

Raverat is buried in the Trumpington Extension Cemetery, Cambridge with her father. Her mother, Maud, Lady Darwin, was cremated at Cambridge Crematorium on 10 February 1947. There is a memorial to Raverat in Harlton Church, Cambridgeshire, where her family and friends donated towards the restoration of the church in her memory.

Cambridge and the people associated with it remained very much the centre of her life. Darwin College, Cambridge, occupies both her childhood home, Newnham Grange, and the neighbouring Old Granary where she lived from 1946 until her death. The college has named one of its student accommodation houses after her.

==Wood engravings==
Raverat was one of the first wood engravers recognised as modern. She went to the Slade School in 1908, but stood outside the groups growing up at the time, the group that gathered around Eric Gill at Ditchling and the group that grew up at the Central School of Arts and Crafts around Noel Rooke. She was influenced by the Impressionists and Post-Impressionists and developed her own painterly style of engraving.

There was some similarity between her early engravings and those of Gill, and she did know Gill, but the similarity was based mostly on her black line style at the time, influenced by Lucien Pissarro, and the semi-religious themes that she then chose. One of her first wood engravings to appear in a book was &quot;Lord Thomas and Fair Annet&quot; in &quot;The Open Window&quot; (1911), which also featured a wood engraving by Noel Rooke.

Balston credits her with having produced one of the first two books illustrated with modern wood engravings. This was &quot;Spring Morning&quot; by her cousin Frances Cornford, published by the Poetry Bookshop in 1915. It was accessioned at the British Museum Library in May 1915, which makes it the first modern British book illustrated with wood engravings, as the other contender, &quot;The Devil&#x27;s Devices&quot; illustrated by Eric Gill, was accessioned in December 1915.

In 1922 she contributed two wood engravings to &quot;Contemporary English Woodcuts&quot;, an anthology of wood engravings produced by Thomas Balston, a director at Duckworth and an enthusiast for the new style of wood engravings. Campbell Dodgson, Keeper of Prints and Drawings at the British Museum, wrote about her in his introduction to the book: &quot;Mr. Greenwood excels in the delicate and minute work in white line upon black, which has also won the admiration of many collectors for the earlier wood engravings of Mrs. Raverat&quot;. Much of Raverat&#x27;s work was for friends from Cambridge and appeared in books with small editions. She found a wider public with the London Mercury which reproduced many of her engravings. The most famous are perhaps the engravings &quot;Six Rivers Round London&quot; which were produced for the London General Omnibus Company.

Most of Raverat&#x27;s commissions for book illustrations date from the 1930s. The first was for a set of engravings for Kenneth Grahame&#x27;s classic anthology &quot;The Cambridge Book of Poetry for Children&quot; (1932). This was published by the Cambridge University Press and printed at the press by Walter Lewis. The Cambridge University Press took almost as much care with their printing as a private press, and Lewis printed the wood engravings from the original blocks. He printed four more books for Raverat – &quot;Mountains and Molehills&quot; by Frances Cornford (1934), &quot;Four Tales from Hans Andersen&quot;, a new version by R. P. Keigwin (1935), &quot;The Runaway&quot; by Elizabeth A. Hart (1936) and &quot;The Bird Talisman&quot; by H. A. Wedgwood (her great-uncle) (1939). &quot;Four Tales&quot; and &quot;The Bird Talisman&quot; were illustrated with colour wood engravings. Brooke Crutchley, Lewis&#x27;s successor at the press, was responsible for printing the collection of Raverat&#x27;s work by Reynolds Stone and described the care taken over printing from old warped blocks.

Her experience of a real private press, St John Hornby&#x27;s Ashendene Press, was rather more mixed. Raverat spent a year producing 29 wood engravings for an edition of &quot;Les Amours de Daphne et Chloe&quot; by Longus. It appeared in 1933, five years after the project started. The first edition had been printed on Japanese vellum, but was scrapped when the ink failed to dry properly.

In 1934 she produced a set of engravings for &quot;Farmer&#x27;s Glory&quot; by A. G. Street (1934), perhaps her best known work. &quot;Cottage Angles&quot; by Norah C. James (1935) reused engravings produced for &quot;Time and Tide&quot;. She illustrated &quot;A Sentimental Journey&quot; by Laurence Sterne for Penguin Illustrated Classics in 1938. Her final wood engravings were for another private press, the Dropmore Press, for which she illustrated &quot;London Bookbinders 1780–1806&quot; by E. Howe (1950).

She illustrated a number of books with line drawings, including &quot;Over The Garden Wall&quot; by Eleanor Farjeon (1933), &quot;Mustard, Pepper and Salt&quot; by Alison Uttley (1938), &quot;Red-Letter Holiday&quot; by Virginia Pye (1940), &quot;Crossings&quot; by Walter de la Mare (1942), &quot;Countess Kate&quot; by Charlotte M. Yonge (1948) and &quot;The Bedside Barsetshire&quot; by L. O. Tingay (1949).

Raverat played a significant part in the wood engraving revival in Britain at the beginning of the twentieth century. By 1914 she had completed some sixty wood engravings, far more than any of her contemporaries. Her name recurs consistently in all contemporary reviews, and the first book devoted to a modern wood engraver was Herbert Furst&#x27;s &quot;Gwendolen Raverat&quot;. She illustrated the first book illustrated with modern wood engravings, &quot;Spring Morning&quot;, and she exhibited at every annual exhibition of the Society of Wood Engravers between 1920 and 1940, exhibiting 122 engravings, more than anyone else.

Raverat had to give up wood engraving after a stroke in 1951.

Raverat&#x27;s work was part of the painting event in the art competition at the 1948 Summer Olympics. Examples of her work were included in ‘Print and Prejudice: Women Printmakers, 1700-1930’, an exhibition at the Victoria and Albert Museum in London, 2022–23.

== Raverat and Cambridge ==

Apart from her studies at the Slade and the period from 1915 to 1928, which covered her life with Jacques and early widowhood, Raverat lived in or near Cambridge. In 1928 she moved into the Old Rectory, Harlton, near Cambridge. The house was the model for her engravings for &quot;The Runaway&quot;. In 1946 she moved into The Old Granary, Silver Street, in Cambridge; the house was at the end of the garden of Newnham Grange, where she was born.

Her life revolved around her contacts in Cambridge. One aspect was her work for the theatre, designing costumes, scenery and programmes. Her first experience was in 1908, when she designed costumes for &quot;Milton&#x27;s&quot; &quot;Comus&quot; at the New Theatre, Cambridge. Her brother-in-law Geoffrey Keynes asked her to provide scenery and costumes for a proposed ballet drawn from &quot;Illustrations of the Book of Job&quot; to commemorate the centennial of Blake&#x27;s death; her second cousin, Ralph Vaughan Williams, wrote the music to the work which became known as &quot;Job, a masque for dancing&quot;, the premiere of which took place in Cambridge in 1931. The miniature stage set that she built as a model still exists, housed at the Fitzwilliam Museum in Cambridge. She went on to design costumes, scenery and programmes for some ten productions, mostly for the Cambridge University Musical Society. Raverat met one of her close friends Elisabeth Vellacott, in the society&#x27;s production of Handel&#x27;s oratorio &quot;Jephta&quot;.

Raverat had a keen interest in children&#x27;s fiction. Three of her books were Victorian stories that she persuaded publishers to reprint – &quot;The Runaway&quot;, &quot;The Bird Talisman&quot; and &quot;Countess Kate&quot;. When she discovered that &quot;The Runaway&quot; had gone out of print, she persuaded the publisher Duckworth to reissue it in 1953.

== &quot;Period Piece&quot; ==

When she was 62 Raverat started to write her classic childhood memoir &quot;Period Piece&quot;, which she illustrated with line drawings. It appeared in 1952 and has not been out of print since then.

== Memberships ==
Gwen Raverat was a founding member of the Society of Wood Engravers, which held an annual exhibition that included works from other artists such as David Jones, John Nash, Paul Nash, Paul Gauguin and Clare Leighton.

== Publications on Raverat ==
There are two published collections of Raverat&#x27;s work. The first, by Reynolds Stone, presents many of her engravings printed from Raverat&#x27;s original blocks; the second, by Joanna Selborne and Lindsay Newman, presents some 75 engravings printed from the blocks, and has long listings of Raverat&#x27;s work. (The second editions of these books are not printed from the original blocks.) The catalogue of the 1989 exhibition at Lancaster University includes a useful bibliography.

Raverat&#x27;s grandson, William Pryor, has edited and published the complete correspondence between Gwen, Jacques, and Virginia Woolf. Pryor has also blogged a talk on Raverat.

<text>Credit Suisse Group AG (, ) is a global investment bank and financial services firm founded and based in Switzerland as a standalone firm but now a subsidiary of UBS. According to UBS, eventually Credit Suisse will be fully integrated into UBS but while the integration is not complete both banks are operating separately. Headquartered in Zürich, as a standalone firm it maintained offices in all major financial centers around the world and provided services in investment banking, private banking, asset management, and shared services. It was known for strict bank–client confidentiality and banking secrecy. The Financial Stability Board considered it to be a global systemically important bank. Credit Suisse was also a primary dealer and Forex counterparty of the Federal Reserve in the United States. 

Credit Suisse was founded in 1856 to fund the development of Switzerland&#x27;s rail system. It issued loans that helped create Switzerland&#x27;s electrical grid and the European rail system. In the 1900s, it began shifting to retail banking in response to the elevation of the middle class and competition from fellow Swiss banks UBS and Julius Bär. Credit Suisse partnered with First Boston in 1978 before buying a controlling share of the bank in 1988. From 1990 to 2000, the company purchased institutions such as Winterthur Group, Swiss Volksbank, Swiss American Securities Inc. (SASI), and Bank Leu.

The company was one of the least affected banks during the 2007–2008 financial crisis, but afterwards began shrinking its investment business, executing layoffs and cutting costs. The bank was at the center of multiple international investigations for tax avoidance (such as the famous &quot;Suisse Secrets&quot; scandal) which culminated in a guilty plea and the forfeiture of US$2.6 billion in fines from 2008 to 2012. By the end of 2022, Credit Suisse had approximately in assets under management.

On 19 March 2023, following negotiations with the Swiss government, UBS announced its intent to acquire Credit Suisse for $3.25 billion (CHF 3 billion) in order to prevent the bank&#x27;s collapse. UBS completed the acquisition in June 2023.

==History==

===Early history===


Credit Suisse&#x27;s founder, Alfred Escher, was called &quot;the spiritual father of the railway law of 1852&quot;, for his work defeating the idea of a state-run railway system in Switzerland in favor of privatization. Escher founded Credit Suisse (originally called the Swiss Credit Institution, i.e., &quot;Schweizerische Kreditanstalt&quot;) jointly with Allgemeine Deutsche Credit-Anstalt on 5 July in 1856 primarily to provide domestic funding to railway projects, avoiding French banks that wanted to exert influence over the railway system. Escher aimed to start the company with three million shares and instead sold 218 million shares in three days. The bank opened on 16 July 1856 and was modeled after Crédit Mobilier, a bank funding railway projects in France that was founded two years prior, except Credit Suisse had a more conservative lending policy focused on short-to-medium term loans. In its first year of operation, 25 percent of the bank&#x27;s revenues was from the Swiss Northeastern Railway, which was being built by Bruno Hildebrand and Escher&#x27;s company, Nordostbahn. 

Credit Suisse played a substantial role in the economic development of Switzerland, helping the country develop its currency system, funding entrepreneurs and investing in the Gotthard railway, which connected Switzerland to the European rail system in 1882. Credit Suisse helped fund the creation of Switzerland&#x27;s electrical grid through its participation with Elektrobank (now called Elektrowatt), a coalition of organizations that co-financed Switzerland&#x27;s electrical grid. According to &quot;The Handbook on the History of European Banks&quot;, &quot;Switzerland&#x27;s young electricity industry came to assume the same importance as support for railway construction 40 years earlier.&quot; The bank also helped fund the effort to disarm and imprison French troops that crossed into Swiss borders in the 1870 Franco-Prussian War. By the end of the war, Credit Suisse had become the largest bank in Switzerland.

Throughout the late 1800s, Credit Suisse set up banking and insurance companies in Germany, Brussels, Geneva and others (as SKA International) with the bank as a shareholder of each company. It created insurance companies like Swiss RE, Swiss Life (aka Rentenanstalt) and Schweiz. Credit Suisse had its first unprofitable year in 1886, due to losses in agriculture, venture investments, commodities, and international trade. The bank created its own sugar beet factory, bought 25,000 shares in animal breeding ventures and supported an export business, Schweizerische Exportgesellschaft, that experienced heavy losses for over-speculative investing.

In the early 1900s Credit Suisse began catering to consumers and the middle-class with deposit counters, currency exchanges and savings accounts. The first branch outside of Zürich was opened in 1905 in Basel. The bank helped companies affected by World War I restructuring, and extended loans for reconstruction efforts. During the 1920s depression, net profits and dividends were halved and employees took salary cuts. After World War II, a substantial portion of Credit Suisse&#x27;s business was in foreign reconstruction efforts. Banks subsequently acquired by Credit Suisse have been linked to bank accounts used by members of the NSDAP in the 1930s. Holocaust survivors had problems trying to retrieve assets from relatives that died in concentration camps without death certificates. This led to a class action lawsuit in 1996 that settled in 2000 for $1.25 billion. The &quot;Agreement on the Swiss Banks&#x27; Code of Conduct with Regard to the Exercise of Due Diligence&quot; was created in the 1970s, after a Credit Suisse branch in Chiasso was exposed for illegally funneling $900 million in Italian deposits to speculative investments.

===Acquisitions, growth and First Boston===

In 1978, White, Weld &amp; Company dropped its partnership with Credit Suisse after it was bought by Merrill Lynch. To replace the partnership with White, Credit Suisse partnered with First Boston to create Credit Suisse First Boston in Europe and bought a 44 percent stake in First Boston&#x27;s US operations.

In 1987, the Group acquired the blue chip London stockbrokers Buckmaster &amp; Moore, originally established by aristocrat Charles Armytage-Moore and sportsman Walter Buckmaster, who had met at Repton School. As stockbrokers they were very well connected, had developed a good private client business, which at one time included John Maynard Keynes.

Other Credit Suisse First Boston brands were later created in Switzerland, Asia, London, New York and Tokyo. According to an article in &quot;The New York Times&quot;, First Boston became &quot;the superstar of the Euromarkets&quot; by buying stakes in American companies that wanted to issue bonds. In 1988 First Boston loaned $487 million to Gibbons and Green for the purchase of the Ohio Mattress Company, which was purchased at twenty times its annual revenue. Gibbons had also borrowed $475 million in junk bonds. When the junk bonds market crashed the following year, Gibbons couldn&#x27;t repay First Boston. Credit Suisse injected $725 million to keep First Boston in business, which ultimately led to the company being taken over by Credit Suisse. This became known as the &quot;burning bed&quot; deal, because the Federal Reserve overlooked the Glass–Steagall Act that requires separation between commercial and investment banks in order to preserve the stability of the financial markets.

In the late 1990s, Credit Suisse executed an aggressive acquisition strategy. The bank acquired Bank Leu, known as Switzerland&#x27;s oldest bank, in 1990. In 1993 Credit Suisse outbid UBS for a controlling stake in Switzerland&#x27;s fifth largest bank, Swiss Volksbank in a $1.1 billion deal. It also merged with Winterthur Group in 1997 for about $9 billion and acquired the asset management division of Warburg, Pincus &amp; Co. in 1999 for $650 million. Donaldson, Lufkin &amp; Jenrette was purchased for $11.5 billion in 2000.

In 1996, Credit Suisse restructured as the Credit Suisse Group with four divisions: Credit Suisse Volksbank (later called Credit Suisse Bank) for domestic banking, Credit Suisse Private Banking, Credit Suisse Asset Management, and Credit Suisse First Boston for corporate and investment banking. The restructure was expected to cost the company $800 million and result in 7,000 lost jobs, but save $560 million a year. While Credit Suisse First Boston had been struggling, Credit Suisse&#x27;s overall profits had grown 20 percent over the prior year, reaching $664 million. In 1999 Japan&#x27;s Financial Supervisory Agency temporarily suspended the financial-products division&#x27;s license to operate in Japan for &quot;window dressing&quot;, the practice of selling derivatives that are often used by bank clients to hide losses.

In the 2000s, Credit Suisse executed a series of restructures. In 2002 the bank was consolidated into two entities: Credit Suisse First Boston for investments and Credit Suisse Financial Services. A third unit was added in 2004 for insurance. Credit Suisse restructured again in 2004 under what it calls the &quot;one bank&quot; model. Under the restructuring, every board had a mix of executives from all three divisions. It also changed the compensation and commission models to encourage cross-division referrals and created a &quot;solution partners&quot; group that functions between the investment and private banking divisions. Following the restructure Credit Suisse&#x27;s private banking division grew 19 percent per year despite the economic crisis. The firm bumped long-time rival UBS off the number one position in Euromoney&#x27;s private banking poll. In 2006, Credit Suisse acknowledged misconduct for helping Iran and other countries hide transactions from US authorities and paid a $536 million settlement. The same year it merged Bank Leu AG, Clariden Holding AG, Bank Hofmann AG and BGP Banca di Gestione Patrimoniale into a new company called Clariden Leu.

The increasing importance of sustainability and the related commitments and liabilities of international standards such as the UNGC, of which the bank is a member, lead to increasingly sophisticated and ambitious risk management over the years. Credit Suisse operates a process which since 2007 uses RepRisk, a Swiss provider of ESG Risk analytics and metrics, to screen and evaluate environmental and social risks of risky transactions and due diligence.

In 2009, Yellowstone Club founder Tim Blixseth sued Credit Suisse when the bank attempted to collect on $286 million in loan debt during Yellowstone&#x27;s bankruptcy proceedings. The debtor had borrowed more than $300 million for the business, but used a large portion of it for personal use before eventually filing for bankruptcy. Four lawsuits were filed from other resorts seeking $24 billion in damages alleging Credit Suisse created loans with the intention of taking over their properties upon default.

===Post-financial crisis===
According to &quot;The Wall Street Journal&quot; in 2008, &quot;Credit Suisse survived the credit crisis better than many competitors.&quot; Credit Suisse had $902 million in write-downs for subprime holdings and the same amount for leveraged loans, but it did not have to borrow from the government. Along with other banks, Credit Suisse was investigated and sued by US authorities in 2012 for bundling mortgage loans with securities, misrepresenting the risks of underlying mortgages during the housing boom. Following the crisis, Credit Suisse cut more than one-trillion in assets and made plans to cut its investment banking arm 37 percent by 2014. It reduced emphasis on investment banking and focused on private banking and wealth management. In July 2011, Credit Suisse cut 2,000 jobs in response to a weaker than expected economic recovery and later merged its asset management with the private bank group to cut additional costs.

A series of international investigations took place in the early 2000s regarding the use banking secrecy in Credit Suisse accounts for tax evasion. In 2008, the Brazilian government investigated 13 former and current Credit Suisse employees. The investigation led to arrests that year and in 2009 as part of a larger crackdown in Brazil. Four Credit Suisse bankers were accused of fraud by the US Justice Department in 2011 for helping wealthy Americans avoid taxes. In 2012, German authorities found that citizens were using insurance policies of a Bermuda-based Credit Suisse subsidiary to earn tax-free interest. 

In November 2012, Credit Suisse&#x27;s asset management division was merged with the private banking arm. In September 2012, the Swiss government gave banks like Credit Suisse permission to provide information to the US Justice Department for tax evasion probes. In February 2014, it agreed to pay a fine of $197 million after one of its businesses served 8,500 US clients without registering its activities, leading to suspicion as to whether it was helping Americans evade taxes. It was one of 14 Swiss banks under investigation. Separately, in 2013, German authorities began to probe Credit Suisse, its private bank subsidiary Clariden Leu, and its regional subsidiary Neue Aargauer Bank for helping German citizens evade taxes. In 2012, the bank eventually entered into a €150 million settlement with the government.

In March 2014, Credit Suisse denied claims it had been drawn into a Swiss competition probe investigating potential collusion to manipulate foreign exchange rates (Forex scandal) by various Swiss and foreign banks. In May 2014, Credit Suisse pleaded guilty to conspiring to aid tax evasion. It was the most prominent bank to plead guilty in the United States since Drexel Burnham Lambert in 1989 and the largest to do so since the Bankers Trust in 1999. &quot;Credit Suisse conspired to help US citizens hide assets in offshore accounts in order to evade paying taxes. When a bank engages in misconduct this brazen, it should expect that the Justice Department will pursue criminal prosecution to the fullest extent possible, as has happened here,&quot; Attorney General Eric H. Holder said at the time. Holder also said &quot;This case shows that no financial institution, no matter its size or global reach, is above the law.&quot; Credit Suisse shares rose 1% on the day the $2.6 billion penalty was announced.

In March 2015, it was announced that Tidjane Thiam, the CEO of Prudential would leave to become the next CEO of Credit Suisse. In September 2016, Brian Chin was appointed Chief Executive of Global Markets and joined the executive board of the bank. At this time, it was also announced that Eric M. Varvel was appointed president and CEO of Credit Suisse Holdings (USA).

The collapse of Lehman Brothers caused a large loss in consumer and market participant trust and confidence in the banking industry. The loss in confidence is reflected in the large loss of share prices across the Swiss banking sector after 2008.

In August 2019, Credit Suisse announced the formation of a new &quot;direct banking&quot; business unit under their Switzerland division (Swiss Universal Bank, SUB), focusing on digital retail products. The step is seen as a reaction to the emergence of FinTech competitors such as N26 or Revolut in Switzerland and shall help to better attract young clients. In July 2020, Thomas Gottstein, the new CEO of the company, announced restructuring; it was influenced as a result of the trading surge in Q2 of 2020, amid the COVID-19 pandemic. The planned restructuring is set &quot;to reduce costs and improve efficiencies&quot; and features some reverts of alterations brought by the previous CEO, Thiam. According to Gottstein, &quot;These initiatives should also help to provide resilience in uncertain markets and deliver further upside when more positive economic conditions prevail.&quot;

In November of 2022, Credit Suisse announced that it was selling the majority of its Securitized Products Group to Apollo Asset Management. Credit Suisse cited a reduction in RWA as the primary factor driving the sale. The deal was expected to close in the first half of 2023.The spin-off was branded Atlas SP and the deal ultimately finalized in March of 2024.

In December of 2022, Credit Suisse completed a CHF 4.00bn capital increase by the way of a CHF 2.24bn rights issue and a CHF 1.80bn private placing.

On 9 February 2023, the bank reported an annual loss of CHF 7.3bn, the biggest loss since the 2007–2008 financial crisis. On 14 March of that same year, Credit Suisse published its annual report for 2022 saying it had identified “material weaknesses” in controls over financial reporting.

===Collapse===

On 15 March 2023, Credit Suisse&#x27; share price dropped nearly 25percent after Saudi National Bank, its largest investor, said it could not provide more financial assistance. The market price of the bank&#x27;s unsecured bonds set for maturity in 2027 dropped to a low of 33percent of their par value on that day, down from being valued at 90percent of their par value at the beginning of the month.

Later in the same week, Credit Suisse sought to shore up their finances by taking a loan of 50 billion Swiss francs from the Swiss National Bank (SNB); the bank later proceeded to buy three billion Swiss francs of its own debt and to put the Baur en Ville hotel in Zürich for sale. However, this intervention did not stop investors and customers from pulling their money out of Credit Suisse, with outflows topping 10 billion Swiss francs during the week, and almost $69 billion (approximately 61 billion Swiss francs) in withdrawals during the first calendar quarter. The situation was so compromised that the SNB and the Swiss government started discussions to fast-track the bank&#x27;s acquisition by UBS. On 19 March 2023, UBS announced a deal had been reached to acquire Credit Suisse for US$3.25billion () in an all-stock deal.

European regulators have criticized the moral hazard of the AT1 bondholders suffering in the loss of their capital rather than the shareholders of the bank. In June 2024, a group of Credit Suisse bondholders holding $82 million worth of the bank&#x27;s ATL debt filed a lawsuit against Switzerland seeking compensation.

According to financial analysts, economic sanctions imposed by Switzerland on Russian individuals and businesses had a significant impact on the demise of the bank. According to &quot;Bloomberg News&quot;, Credit Suisse held about $33 billion for Russian clients, 50% more than UBS.

In late April 2023, the political and economic fall-out had been evaluated by a number of economic analysts, particularly the resulting lack of banking competition in Switzerland&#x27;s economy. The take-over by UBS had limited the choice of lenders, particularly for smaller and medium sized companies. Credit Suisse&#x27;s international reach had affected the employment situation in Europe as well as other regions. The Swiss economy as such also relies on a number of heavily capitalised state banks that have been a significant lender to those smaller enterprises, particularly after the demise of CS.

===Post-acquisition===
On 27 June 2023, UBS announced its intention to cut more than half of Credit Suisse&#x27;s workforce. In July 2024, Credit Suisse (Schweiz) ceased to exist as a separate legal entity after fully being integrated into UBS Switzerland.

In 2023, the Credit Suisse unit in Singapore was ordered to pay $743 million to Georgian billionaire Bidzina Ivanishvili for fraud. 

===Leadership history===
Credit Suisse&#x27;s leadership history unfolds through visionary leaders like Alfred Escher, who founded the bank in 1856. Hermann Heller&#x27;s international focus during 1909–1937 and August Rust&#x27;s diversification from 1942–1967 laid crucial foundations. Edwin Stopper&#x27;s strategies in 1979–1990 brought challenges amid expansion into global markets. 

Lukas Muhlemann&#x27;s cost-cutting efforts in 1993–2002 faced setbacks, and Oswald Grubel grappled with restructuring post–2008 crisis during 2003–2013. Tidjane Thiam&#x27;s wealth management focus in 2015–2020 faced external challenges, leading to resignation. Tomas Gottstein, since 2020, tackles geopolitical tensions, emphasizing sustainability while navigating regulatory changes for investor confidence. Understanding Credit Suisse&#x27;s leadership involves considering broader industry trends and key advisors beyond CEOs.

Credit Suisse endorses a strategy called bancassurance of trying to be a single company that offers every common financial services product. The investment bank is intended for companies and wealthy individuals with more than 50,000 euro.

Credit Suisse developed the CreditRisk+ model of risk assessment in loans, which is focused exclusively on the chance of default based on the exogenous Poisson method. As of 2002 about 20 percent of Credit Suisse&#x27;s revenue was from its insurance business it gained through the 1997 acquisition of Winterthur. The investment bank&#x27;s insurance products are primarily popular in the domestic market and include auto, fire, property, life, disability, pension and retirement products among others. Historically 20–40 percent of the bank&#x27;s revenue has been from private banking services, one of its higher profit-margin divisions.

Credit Suisse produces one of the six hedge funds following European stock indices that are used to evaluate the performance of the markets. The investment bank also has a 30 percent ownership in hedge fund investment firm York Capital Management. York sells hedge funds independently to its own clients, while Credit Suisse also offers them to private banking clients. Credit Suisse manages the financial instruments of the Dow Jones Credit Suisse long/short equity index (originally called Credit Suisse/Tremont Hedge Fund Indexes).

According to a 2011 article in &quot;Seeking Alpha&quot;, Credit Suisse&#x27;s investment managers favor financial, technology and energy sector stocks. The bank&#x27;s head of equity investments in Europe said the team focuses on &quot;value with an emphasis on free cashflow&quot;. She also has an interest in companies undergoing management changes that may influence the stock price. According to a story in &quot;The Wall Street Journal&quot;, the head of Credit Suisse&#x27;s International Focus Fund keeps a portfolio of only 40–50 stocks, instead of the industry-norm of more than 100. Credit Suisse publishes its investment advice in four publications: &quot;Compass, Viewpoints, Research&quot; and the &quot;Credit Suisse Investment Committee Report&quot;.

On 5 May 2023, Credit Suisse announced it would buy Ecuadorian bonds worth $1.6 billion in a debt-for-nature swap that costs the Swiss bank only $644 million. As a result, the government of Ecuador pledged to spend about $18 million annually for two decades on conservation in the Galapagos islands, a UNESCO world heritage site. The bond purchase was below 55% of the purchase value and below 35.5% for the consecutive 5 year-intervals after 2025. Underwriters for that deal is the Inter-American Development Bank (IDB) and the U.S. International Development Finance Cooperation, therefore limiting the risk for Credit Suisse. The deal effectively saves Ecuador from liquidity shortages due to an estimated public debt of $66.8 billion. In April 2020, Ecuador repaid $1 billion of loans made two years earlier by Goldman Sachs and Credit Suisse.

==Reputation and rankings==
The reputation of the bank is controversial. From the 1940s until into the 2010s, beside regular customers, Credit Suisse offered criminals, corrupt politicians and controversial secret service chiefs a safe haven for their assets, despite all public declarations of a &quot;white money&quot; strategy.

Until its acquisition by UBS in 2023, Credit Suisse was a member of Wall Street&#x27;s bulge bracket, a list of the largest and most profitable banks. The company was one of the world&#x27;s most important banks, upon which international financial stability depends. The bank was also one of &quot;Fortune Magazine&#x27;s&quot; most admired companies.

As of 2004, Credit Suisse was first in volume of high-yield transactions, second for corporate high-yield bond insurance and third for IPO underwriting. As of 2012, Credit Suisse was recognised as the world&#x27;s best private bank by &quot;Euromoney&quot; Global Private Banking Survey and as the best European Equity Manager by &quot;Global Investors&quot;. In polls by &quot;Euromoney&quot;, it has been ranked as the top private bank and the best bank in Switzerland. In 1995, the Securities Data Company ranked Credit Suisse as the fourth best place for financial advice for mergers and acquisitions in the US and sixth for domestic equity issues. Credit Suisse was recognized by the Asset Triple A Awards and in 2005 it was ranked as the second best prime broker by &quot;Institutional Investor&quot;.

An investigation in February 2022 by &quot;The Guardian&quot; following the Suisse Secrets leaks revealed that Credit Suisse was holding bank accounts for many criminals, fraudsters and corrupt politicians.

In early September 2023, UBS had clearly profited from the takeover as its stocks were increasingly valuable. From April to July, UBS made a record profit of 29.2 billion CHF and its stocks, which were initially depressed after the fusion, were traded at much higher prices. The record profit was based on the difference between the purchase price of Credit Suisse stocks and the apparently higher value of its assets.

==Controversies==

===Mismarking, 2007===
In 2007, two Credit Suisse traders pleaded guilty to mismarking their securities positions to overvalue them by $3 billion, avoid losses, and increase their year-end bonuses. Federal prosecutors and the Securities and Exchange Commission charged that the traders&#x27; goal was to obtain lavish year-end bonuses that the mismarking would lead to. The traders engaged in what &quot;The New York Times&quot; called &quot;a brazen scheme to artificially increase the price of bonds on their books to create fictitious profits&quot;. A team of traders, facing an inquiry from Credit Suisse&#x27;s internal controls Price Testing group, justified their bond portfolio&#x27;s inflated value by obtaining &quot;independent&quot; marks from other banks&#x27; trading desks.

The traders secured sham &quot;independent&quot; marks for illiquid securities that they held position in from friends who worked at other financial firms. Their friends generated prices that valued a number of bonds at the prices that the traders requested, which the traders then recorded as the true value of the bonds. The bank was not charged in the case. Credit Suisse&#x27;s outside auditor discovered the mismarkings during an audit. Credit Suisse took a $2.65 billion write-down after discovering their traders&#x27; mismarking.

===Japan limited income tax case, 2008===

In November 2008, 300 current and former Credit Suisse employees had understated or completely failed to declare stock-based compensation. Among all these cases one individual, Takashi Hatta was prosecuted from the investigation done by the Tokyo Regional Taxation Bureau. He insisted that he did not intend tax evasion, not realizing Credit Suisse had not withheld income tax, as is usual in Japan. After years of investigation and trials, Hatta was acquitted.

===International Emergency Economic Powers Act and New York State Law violations, 2009===
On 16 December 2009, it was announced that the US Department of Justice (DOJ) reached a settlement with Credit Suisse over accusations that the bank assisted residents of International Emergency Economic Powers Act sanctioned countries to wire money in violation of the Act as well as New York law from 1995 to 2006. The settlement resulted in Credit Suisse forfeiting $536 million.

===US tax fraud conspiracy, 2014, 2023===

In 2014, Credit Suisse pleaded guilty to conspiring with Americans to file false tax returns. Credit Suisse subsequently paid $2.6 billion in fines and restitution. It was reported in 2022 that the US DOJ had opened an investigation into whether the bank continued to assist clients hide assets from tax authorities despite the terms of the 2014 settlement. According to the DOJ in 2023, Credit Suisse violated a plea agreement with US authorities by failing to report secret offshore accounts that wealthy Americans used to avoid paying taxes.

===Malaysia Development Berhad scandal, 2015===

In September 2015 Hong Kong police began investigations regarding $250 million in Credit Suisse branch deposits in Hong Kong linked to former Malaysia&#x27;s Prime Minister Najib Razak and Malaysian sovereign wealth fund, 1Malaysia Development Berhad (1MDB). In 2017, Singapore fined Credit Suisse a total of S$0.7m (£0.4m, $0.5m, €0.45m). In May 2017, Reuters reported that &quot;Swiss financial watchdog FINMA ... had conducted &quot;extensive investigations&quot; into Credit Suisse&#x27;s dealings surrounding 1MDB&quot;. In 2019 FINMA issued a complaint to Credit Suisse.

===Mozambique secret loans scandal, 2017===

Between 2012 and 2016, Credit Suisse brokered US$1.3 billion of loans with Mozambican finance minister Manuel Chang, to develop the country&#x27;s tuna fishing industry. The loans were issued as bonds to be paid off by the income from tuna fishing as well as the country&#x27;s nascent natural gas industry. Chang lied to investors, his own government, the IMF and the banks issuing the loans, including Credit Suisse. Credit Suisse was fined almost US$500 million by UK, US and European regulators for a lack of transparency in the issuing of the bonds, for kickbacks benefitting Credit Suisse bankers and for enabling loans likely to be embezzled by Mozambican officials, including Chang. In October 2021, Credit Suisse pled guilty to wire fraud and agreed to forgive US$200 million in debt owed by Mozambique to the bank.

===US Foreign Corrupt Practices Act violation, 2018===
On 5 July 2018, Credit Suisse agreed to pay a $47 million fine to the US Department of Justice and $30 million to resolve charges of the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). The SEC&#x27;s investigation said that the banking group sought investment banking business in the Asia-Pacific region by hiring and promoting more than one hundred Chinese officials and related people in violation of the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act.

===Climate controversy, 2018===

In November 2018, about a dozen climate activists played tennis inside Credit Suisse agencies (of Lausanne, Geneva and Basel simultaneously), disrupting operations as a protest against the bank&#x27;s investments in fossil fuels. Credit Suisse lodged a complaint and the activists from Lausanne were tried in January 2020 and fined 21,600 CHF. They were later cleared of all charges in what a Swiss media outlet considered a &#x27;historical decision&#x27;.

The tennis theme was chosen to urge Swiss tennis star Roger Federer to break his connection with Credit Suisse as a sponsor due to the company&#x27;s participating in the climate crisis (notably by multiplying 16-fold its financing for coal from 2016 to 2017). On 11 January 2020, Federer published a statement saying: &quot;[...] I have a great deal of respect and admiration for the youth climate movement, and I am grateful to young climate activists for pushing us all to examine our behaviours&quot;, and further committed to a dialogue with his sponsors on social issues.

On 24 January 2020, following the trial, the climate activist group emitted a press statement requesting a transparent, televised debate with the CEO of Credit Suisse. With no answer from the bank, they created a website under the name &quot;DiscreditSuisse&quot; hosting content pertaining to Credit Suisse&#x27;s record on climate issues.

===Private spying scandal, 2019===
In 2019, a senior executive who was leaving the firm discovered that Pierre-Olivier Bouée, the chief operating officer (COO) of Credit Suisse at the time, had hired private detectives to follow him to see if he was wooing Credit Suisse clients. Bouée was fired, and a private investigator involved in the surveillance apparently killed himself.

===Greensill Capital, 2021===

In March 2021, Credit Suisse closed and liquidated several supply-chain investment funds tied to the activities of Greensill Capital. The investors in the funds, which totalled assets of approximately $10 billion, were expected to lose $3 billion as of March 2021. Credit Suisse has returned around $7.4 billion to investors in its Greensill-linked funds.

===Archegos Capital, 2021===
In April 2021, at least seven executives were removed from their posts after Credit Suisse reported losses of $4.7 billion linked to its prime brokerage services provided to Archegos Capital. The executives who departed included Lara Warner, the group&#x27;s chief risk and compliance officer, and Brian Chin, head of the investment bank. Just prior to Credit Suisse&#x27;s 2021 Annual General Meeting, Andreas Gottschling, head of the board&#x27;s risk committee, also stood down. In July 2023, Credit Suisse&#x27;s parent UBS was fined $269 million by the Federal Reserve and $119 million by the Bank of England for its failure in risk management.

===Forex manipulations conviction, 2021===
In 2021, Credit Suisse was fined €83.3 million for forex rates manipulation by the European Union Commission on Competition because of its participation in a cartel detrimental to EU consumers and involving several other large international banks. In October 2022, a US jury found that Credit Suisse did not collude with other banks to manipulate forex rates, in a class-action trial.

===Drug money laundering scandal, 2022===
On 7 February 2022, it was announced that Credit Suisse would be tried in the first criminal trial of a major bank in Switzerland. Swiss prosecutors are seeking around 42 million Swiss francs ($45 million) in compensation from Credit Suisse for allowing a Bulgarian cocaine trafficking gang around Evelin Banev to launder millions of Euros of cash between 2004 and 2008. On 27 June 2022, the bank as well as one of its former employees was found guilty by the Federal Criminal Court of Switzerland for not doing enough to prevent the crime from taking place. The court imposed a fine of and ordered the confiscation of assets worth more than that the drug gang held in accounts at the bank; and to relinquish over — the amount that could not be confiscated due to internal deficiencies at the bank. The bank said it would appeal against the verdict.

===Suisse secrets leak, 2022===

In February 2022, details of 30,000 customers holding over 100bn Swiss francs (£80bn) in accounts at the bank were leaked to the &quot;Süddeutsche Zeitung&quot;, and became known as &quot;Suisse Secrets&quot;. Among those with accounts at the bank were a human trafficker, a torturer, drug traffickers and a Vatican-run account that allegedly invested €350m fraudulently in London property. On 20 February, Credit Suisse said it &quot;strongly rejects&quot; allegations of wrongdoing.

===Russian oligarch loans documents destruction after invasion of Ukraine, 2022===
Following Swiss sanctions on Russia during the 2022 Russian invasion of Ukraine, Credit Suisse issued legal requests asking hedge funds and other investors to destroy documents linking Russian oligarchs to yacht loans, a move for which they faced considerable criticism. The US House Oversight Committee launched a probe into the firm demanding documents linked to the bank&#x27;s compliance with sanctions on Russian oligarchs.

===Social media rumours, 2022===
In early October 2022, Credit Suisse stocks came under considerable pressure when rumours on social media projected the demise of the bank. According to financial analysts, the bank has a “strong capital base and liquidity position”. Nevertheless, the Swiss National Bank vowed to follow the situation closely. European finance experts in particular talked of a &quot;self-fulfilling risk&quot; since liquidity is not a problem for the Swiss bank. CS had suffered severe losses in 2021 from the Archegos and Greensill financial scandals that implicated former Archegos executives with racketeering conspiracy, securities fraud and wire fraud.

On 7 October 2022, the bank offered to buy back US$3 billion worth of debt, and put Zurich&#x27;s Savoy Hotel on sale, which was later purchased by wealthy Arab officials. The bank&#x27;s current chairman, Axel Lehmann, also assured investors that the bank was stable after wealthy clients began moving their assets out of the bank. In the fall-out from the falling stock prices, insiders believed that Saudi prince Mohammed bin Salman was looking to invest almost US$500 million into the bank, but had to withdraw his offer due to regulatory concerns.

===NSDAP accounts, 2023===
In 2023 Credit Suisse stopped internal investigation into its Nazi clients and other Nazi-linked accounts facing much condemnation of the U.S. Senate Budget Committee and Holocaust survivors among others. According to the most recent Senate report at least 14 of these stayed open until 2000s. In 1996 and 1997, both the Bergier Commission and the Volcker Committee had investigated the same remaining accounts related to the Swiss banks&#x27; dealing with Nazi Germany. Those settlements had resulted in the payment of USD 1.288 billion by UBS, Credit Suisse and other Swiss banks to 458,400 Holocaust victims, and 198,000 victims of the Slave Labor Class action lawsuit.

==Work environment==
Credit Suisse is more internationally minded than most European banks. According to WetFeet&#x27;s Insider Guide, Credit Suisse offers more travel opportunities, greater levels of responsibility and more client interaction than new employees get at competing firms but is known for long hours. Analysts report 60- to 110-hour work-weeks.

Roles and responsibilities are less stringent and the environment is pleasant despite hours being &quot;the most grueling on Wall Street&quot;. Vault&#x27;s Insider&#x27;s Guide reached similar conclusions, noting above-average training, executive access and openness matched with reports of 80- to 100-hour work-weeks.

In 2023, the bank made moves to pay bonuses to top executives and senior bankers upfront but included an added condition that they needed to stay with the bank for three years or else they would need to pay the bonus, or some of the bonus, back to the company. Later the Swiss federal government, as well as the last General Assembly of Credit Suisse shareholders voted to withdraw or seriously reduce bonus payments to top management.

<text>Flash fiction is a brief fictional narrative that still offers character and plot development. Identified varieties, many of them defined by word count, include the six-word story; the 280-character story (also known as &quot;twitterature&quot;); the &quot;dribble&quot; (also known as the &quot;minisaga&quot;, 50 words); the &quot;drabble&quot; (also known as &quot;microfiction&quot;, 100 words); &quot;sudden fiction&quot; (750 words); &quot;flash fiction&quot; (1,000 words); and &quot;microstory&quot;.

Some commentators have suggested that flash fiction possesses a unique literary quality in its ability to hint at or imply a larger story.

==History==
Flash fiction has roots going back to prehistory, recorded at origin of writing, including fables and parables, notably &quot;Aesop&#x27;s Fables&quot; in the west, and Panchatantra and Jataka tales in India. Later examples include the tales of Nasreddin, and Zen koans such as &quot;The Gateless Gate&quot;.

In the United States, early forms of flash fiction can be found in the 19th century, notably in the figures of Walt Whitman, Ambrose Bierce, and Kate Chopin.

In the 1920s flash fiction was referred to as the &quot;short short story&quot; and was associated with &quot;Cosmopolitan&quot; magazine, and in the 1930s, collected in anthologies such as &quot;The American Short Short Story&quot;.

Somerset Maugham was a notable proponent, with his &quot;Cosmopolitans: Very Short Stories&quot; (1936) being an early collection.

In Japan, flash fiction was popularized in the post-war period particularly by .

In 1986 Jerome Stern at the Florida State University organized the World&#x27;s Best Short-Short Story Contest for stories of fewer than 250 words. Michael Martone, the first winner, received $100 and a crate of Florida oranges as the prize. The &quot;Southeast Review&quot; continues the contest but has increased the maximum to 500 words. In 1996 Stern published &quot;Micro Fiction: an anthology of really short stories&quot; drawn, in part, from the contest.

It was not until 1992, however, that the term &quot;flash fiction&quot; came into use as a category/genre of fiction. It was coined by James Thomas, who together with Denise Thomas and Tom Hazuka edited the 1992 landmark anthology titled &quot;Flash Fiction: 72 Very Short Stories&quot;, and was introduced by Thomas in his Introduction to that volume. Since then the term has gained wide acceptance as a form, especially in the W. W. Norton Anthologies co-edited by Thomas: &quot;Flash Fiction America&quot;, &quot;Flash Fiction International&quot;, &quot;Flash Fiction Forward&quot;, and &quot;Flash Fiction: 72 Very Short Stories&quot;.

In 2020 the Harry Ransom Center at the University of Texas at Austin established the first curated collection of flash fiction artifacts in the United States.

==Authors==
Practitioners have included Saadi of Shiraz (&quot;Gulistan of Sa&#x27;di&quot;), Bolesław Prus, Anton Chekhov, O. Henry, Franz Kafka, H. P. Lovecraft, Yasunari Kawabata, Ernest Hemingway, Julio Cortázar, Daniil Kharms, Arthur C. Clarke, Richard Brautigan, Ray Bradbury, Kurt Vonnegut Jr., Fredric Brown, John Cage, Philip K. Dick, and Robert Sheckley.

Hemingway also wrote 18 pieces of flash fiction that were included in his first short-story collection, &quot;In Our Time&quot; (1925). It is disputed whether (to win a bet), as alleged, he also wrote the flash fiction &quot;For Sale, Baby Shoes, Never Worn&quot;.

Also notable are the 62 &quot;short-shorts&quot; which comprise &quot;Severance,&quot; the thematic collection by Robert Olen Butler in which each story describes the remaining 90 seconds of conscious awareness within human heads which have been decapitated.

Contemporary English-speaking writers well known for their published flash fiction include Kathy Fish, Venita Blackburn, Amber Sparks, Lydia Davis, David Gaffney, Robert Scotellaro, and Nancy Stohlman, Sherrie Flick, Bruce Holland Rogers, Steve Almond, Barbara Henning, Grant Faulkner.

Spanish-speaking literature has many authors of microstories, including Augusto Monterroso (&quot;El Dinosaurio&quot;) and Luis Felipe Lomelí (&quot;El Emigrante&quot;). Their microstories are some of the shortest ever written in that language. In Spain, authors of &quot;microrrelatos&quot; (very short fictions) have included Andrés Neuman, Ramón Gómez de la Serna, José Jiménez Lozano, Javier Tomeo, José María Merino, Juan José Millás, and Óscar Esquivias. In his collection &quot;La mitad del diablo&quot; (Páginas de Espuma, 2006), Juan Pedro Aparicio included the one-word story Luis XIV, which in its entirety reads: &quot;Yo&quot; (&quot;I&quot;). In Argentina, notable contemporary contributors to the genre have included Marco Denevi, Luisa Valenzuela, and Ana María Shua.

The Italian writer Italo Calvino consciously searched for a short narrative form, drawing inspiration from Argentine writers Jorge Luis Borges and Adolfo Bioy Casares and finding that Monterroso&#x27;s was &quot;the most perfect he could find&quot;; &quot;El dinosaurio&quot;, in turn, possibly inspired his &quot;The Dinosaurs&quot;.

German-language authors of &quot;Kürzestgeschichten,&quot; influenced by brief narratives penned by Bertolt Brecht and Franz Kafka, have included Peter Bichsel, Heimito von Doderer, Günter Kunert, and Helmut Heißenbüttel.

The Arabic-speaking world has produced a number of microstory authors, including the Nobel Prize-winning Egyptian author Naguib Mahfouz, whose book &quot;Echoes of an Autobiography&quot; is composed mainly of such stories. Other flash fiction writers in Arabic include Zakaria Tamer, Haidar Haidar, and Laila al-Othman.

In the Russian-speaking world the best known flash fiction author is Linor Goralik.

In the southwestern Indian state of Kerala P. K. Parakkadavu is known for his many microstories in the Malayalam language.

Hungarian writer István Örkény is known (beside other works) for his &quot;One-Minute Stories.&quot;

==Print journals==
A number of print journals dedicate themselves to flash fiction. These include &quot;Flash: The International Short-Short Story Magazine&quot;.

==Online journals==
Access to the Internet has enhanced an awareness of flash fiction, with online journals being devoted entirely to the style. &quot;SmokeLong Quarterly&quot;, founded by Dave Clapper in 2003, is &quot;dedicated to bringing the best flash narratives to the web whether written by widely published authors or those new to the craft.&quot; A few others that specialize in the form include &quot;Every Day Fiction&quot; (founded in 2007), &quot;Flash Fiction Online&quot; (founded in 2007), &quot;wigleaf&quot; (founded in 2008) and &quot;Flash Fiction Magazine&quot; (founded in 2014), not to mention the Webby Award recognized &quot;Dribble Drabble Review&quot; (best cultural website), founded and edited by Keith Hoerner since 2020.

In a CNN article on the subject, the author remarked that the &quot;democratization of communication offered by the Internet has made positive in-roads&quot; in the specific area of flash fiction, and directly influenced the style&#x27;s popularity. The form is popular, with most online literary journals now publishing flash fiction.

In the summer of 2017, &quot;The New Yorker&quot; began running a series of flash fiction stories online every summer.

<text>James Pickles (18 March 1925 – 18 December 2010) was an English barrister and circuit judge and who later became a tabloid newspaper columnist. He became known for his controversial sentencing decisions and press statements. His obituaries variously described him as forthright, colourful, and outspoken.

==Early life==
Pickles was born in Halifax, West Yorkshire. His father, Arthur Pickles, was an architect and surveyor who became a property developer, and later a Liberal member of Halifax Town Council and ultimately Mayor of Halifax. His father&#x27;s family were also involved in building and masonry: his great-grandfather worked on the construction of the Royal Courts of Justice on the Strand in London. His uncle was the radio presenter Wilfred Pickles.

James&#x27; sister, Christina Pickles, is an actress, most famous for her role as a nurse in the hospital drama &quot;St. Elsewhere&quot; and for playing the mother of Ross and Monica in the American sitcom &quot;Friends&quot;, both of which won her Emmy nominations.

James Pickles suffered a severe burn to his right hand when young, and learned to write and play tennis and squash with his left hand. He was educated at local primary schools, a prep school and then at Worksop College in Nottinghamshire. His hand injury made him exempt from military service in the Second World War, and he read law at Leeds University and Christ Church, Oxford. He graduated in the second class in 1947, Pickles was called to the bar at the Inner Temple in 1948.

== Legal and political career ==
Pickles practised as a barrister at Bradford, Yorkshire, from 1949 to 1976, originally in the chambers headed by Joseph Stanley Snowden. He became head of chambers in 1972, but his applications for appointment as Queen&#x27;s Counsel were rejected.

He also dabbled in politics. He was a Labour member of Brighouse Borough Council from 1956 to 1962, and stood for election to Parliament in Yorkshire seats twice. He was the unsuccessful Labour candidate for Barkston Ash in the 1959 general election, and then came third as the Liberal candidate for Brighouse and Spenborough at the 1964 general election.

==Judicial career==
Pickles served as an assistant recorder of the Crown Court from 1963, and then served as a Recorder of Bradford from 1972 to 1976, when he was appointed Circuit Judge on the north eastern circuit. His career as a judge was controversial, and some of his judgments made headline news, resulting in calls for judges to be held more accountable.

He came to public attention in 1985 when he wrote an article that was published in &quot;The Daily Telegraph&quot; criticising the Conservative government&#x27;s policy of widening probation, insisting that imprisonment was necessary to deter offenders. His statements to the press breached the voluntary rules established by Lord Kilmuir in the 1950s that restricted press statements to senior judges. He publicly criticised the Lord Chancellor Lord Hailsham as &quot;a brooding quixotic dictator&quot;. Hailsham retaliated that Pickles was &quot;a sort of anti-Judge who does all the things that a Judge ought not to do&quot;. The Kilmuir rules were abolished when Lord Mackay became Lord Chancellor in October 1987. There was speculation that Pickles would be dismissed in 1989, after he spoke to the press about a case he had heard which was subject to appeal, but instead he was given a &quot;serious rebuke&quot;.

Among his most controversial sentencing decisions was a case in early 1989 in which he sentenced a man to a period of probation after he was convicted of sexually assaulting a six-year-old girl. Later that year, he jailed a woman for seven days for contempt of court when she refused to give evidence against her ex-boyfriend, who had assaulted her – she was later freed by the Court of Appeal. In early 1990, he imprisoned a 19-year-old single mother for six months on a charge of theft for letting her friends take goods from the shop at which she worked; the sentence was replaced by a period of probation on appeal.

Pickles was a vocal proponent of the legalisation of cannabis, and also advocated the legalisation of prostitution.

== Television and writing==
Outside the law, Pickles enjoyed writing, particularly writing plays. He was a member of Halifax Thespians and Halifax Authors&#x27; Circle. In addition to tabloid journalism in &quot;The Sun&quot; and the &quot;Daily Sport&quot;, he also wrote several books, including two memoirs &quot;Straight from the Bench&quot; (1987) and &quot;Judge for Yourself&quot; (1992) and a novel &quot;Off the Record&quot; (1993). He also wrote many plays, some of which were aired on BBC Radio.

Pickles appeared as a guest on &quot;Have I Got News for You&quot; in 1994, sparring with Ian Hislop. When Hislop told him it was a pleasure to be sitting opposite a judge, Pickles replied: &quot;It&#x27;s a great pleasure to be sitting opposite someone who should be in the dock.&quot; 

Pickles also appeared in an episode of &quot;Da Ali G Show&quot;, and the Channel 5 programme &quot;The People vs. Jerry Sadowitz&quot;.

==Personal life and death==
Pickles married Sheila Ratcliffe in August 1948. They had two sons, Roger and Simon Pickles, and a daughter, Carolyn Pickles, who became an actress, appearing on television in &quot;Emmerdale&quot;. His wife died in 1995, and he was survived by his three children.

James Pickles died on 18 December 2010, aged 85.

<text>William Gibson Haig Clark, Baron Clark of Kempston, (18 October 1917 – 6 October 2004) was a British Conservative politician who sat for a total of 28 years as a member of Parliament for three constituencies. He was also a Member of the House of Lords.

==Early life==
Clark was educated at Battersea Polytechnic, qualifying in accountancy in 1941. From 1941 to 1946 he served in World War II in Britain and India in the Royal Army Ordnance Corps, gaining the rank of major. He became involved in business, particularly investing in cane sugar production, with interests in St Kitts and Belize, and in property in the UK. He was also a consultant to Tate&amp;Lyle.

==Political career==
In 1949, Clark was elected to Wandsworth Borough Council, serving until 1953. He was unsuccessful in his attempt to win a seat on the London County Council and stood without success in the 1955 general election in Northampton.

Clark was elected to Parliament for Nottingham South in 1959, serving on the opposition front bench from 1964 to 1966, the only period in his career. He lost his seat in 1966.
He returned to Parliament as the MP for East Surrey in 1970, and from 1974 until he retired in 1992 for its largely successor seat after boundary changes, Croydon South. Geoffrey Howe succeeded him in the East Surrey seat when boundary changes meant he was transferred from the Reigate seat close by. He was active in the 1970s in restoring Conservative Party finances to a sustainable levels. He identified with the right wing of the party and voted against British membership of the European Community in 1971. He chaired the Conservative backbench Finance Committee from 1979 until 1992, encouraging Margaret Thatcher to pursue financial stability and free enterprise and defending her policies on television and radio. He was knighted in 1980 and in 1990 was made a Privy Counsellor.

Following his retirement Clark received a life peerage on 21 July 1992 as Baron Clark of Kempston, &quot;of Kempston in the County of Bedfordshire&quot;, and was an active contributor to House of Lords debates.

==Personal life==
Clark was married to Irene Rands and had three sons and a daughter.

<text>The Chooser is an application program for Macintosh systems using the classic Mac OS. The Chooser started out as a desk accessory and became a standalone application program as of System 7. The Chooser allowed users to connect to AppleShare file servers (via AppleTalk or TCP/IP), enable or disable the network access, and select which printer to use.

==History==
The original Macintosh computer included two high-speed (for the era) serial ports that were used for most external connectivity. This included printers, which had to be adapted for use on the Mac through the addition of such a port, or an adaptor. Any device could be plugged into either port, which meant that some system needed to be used to identify which port had a printer, possibly both.

A small desk accessory called &quot;Choose Printer&quot; allowed the printer driver and serial port to be selected for the connected printer. It did this by listing known printer drivers, displayed as icons of the printer model in question, and allowing the user to select it by clicking on the icon. The icons were expected to physically resemble the printer in question and were contained in the drivers&#x27; resource fork. At this point the two serial ports appeared, allowing the user to indicate which port that printer was connected to.

When Apple introduced the LaserWriter, its very high cost meant that the only cost-effective way to use it was shared among a small workgroup of Macintoshes. This necessitated the inclusion of AppleTalk, a simple networking implementation which used low-cost cabling and the same physical RS-422 serial port hardware. It was a natural extension of &quot;Choose Printer&quot; to include the ability to select the LaserWriter and also which port was used to connect its network connection.

As AppleTalk became useful for other types of networking, such as file sharing, the &quot;Choose Printer&quot; accessory was renamed to simply &quot;Chooser&quot;. The Chooser became the main point to add top-level configuration options for both networking and printing.

Starting with Mac OS X 10.0, the Chooser was replaced by macOS&#x27;s integrated networking features in the Finder. For the printing functions, they were found in the separate Print Center (10.0–10.2) and Printer Setup Utility (10.3–10.4) applications and in the &quot;Print &amp; Fax&quot; (10.3–10.6), &quot;Print &amp; Scan&quot; (10.7–10.8) and &quot;Printers &amp; Scanners&quot; (10.9 and later) panes in System Preferences (10.0–12) and System Settings (13 and later) applications.

<text>Kings Worthy is a village and civil parish in Hampshire, England, approximately two miles north-east of Winchester. Kings Worthy was a tithing of Barton Stacey when the Domesday Book was written.

==St Mary&#x27;s church==
The parish church, established in 1185, is found on London Road. A traditional village church, St Mary&#x27;s caters to a range of worshippers from Anglo-Catholics to those of a more evangelical persuasion. The church is welcoming to families, with a dedicated room for younger children. A highlight of the church calendar is the Festival of Nine Lessons and Carols. This celebration of Christmas follows a traditional format with a wide selection of choir items, congregational carols and readings.

==Education==

The primary school is Kings Worthy Primary School. Most pupils from Kings Worthy Primary go on to study at Henry Beaufort School.

Sports within Kings Worthy are limited, however the Worthys Football club were runners up in the 2017 Jack West Cup Final.

===Primary school===

Kings Worthy Primary School is a medium-sized school in the heart of Kings Worthy, Winchester, England. It has around 420 pupils and 25 staff. It is a state school for pupils aged from 4–11. At the school, pupils finish by taking their year six SATS exams.

The school was established in 1953. It was originally one of two local schools: the other was in nearby Abbots Worthy. As the school started to grow they bought Hinton House, a Victorian house adjacent to the school site. This was then used to house five classrooms.

In September 2008 Hinton House was sold and work began on a brand new building consisting of five new modern classrooms, as well as purpose-built technology rooms. During this move some of the school grounds were lost, but they still have a wide area including a pond and a big sports field.

Every year the school puts on a Christmas production that involves everyone in the school and each class comes on and does their own little sketch. Every year the show is different but it always links in or around the Christmas story.

==Theatre==
The Jubilee Hall on London Road is home to amateur dramatics group, The Worthy Players, who have been treading the boards in the village since 1973. A versatile group, the Players have performed pantomimes, comedies, farces, thrillers, music hall, serious plays and much more over more than 40 years.

==Transportation==
The main road (Springvale Road) is fairly busy, and is served by regular buses going to the centre of Winchester. The main bus route serving the village is known as &quot;The Spring&quot;, and is operated by Stagecoach. The parish is crossed by the A33, which merges with the A34 immediately to the south. Kings Worthy formerly had a station on the Didcot, Newbury and Southampton Railway. It was by-passed to the west by the London and South Western Railway (the surviving main line) and to the north by the Alton, Alresford and Winchester Railway, part of which survives to the east as the Watercress Line.

==Conservation==
Worthys Conservation Volunteers is the local group of practical conservationists working on the third Sunday of each month to care for the wildlife and natural environment in and around the village and The Worthys.

==Representation==
Cllr Jackie Porter, Cllr Malcolm Prince and Cllr Jane Rutter (all Liberal Democrats) represent The Worthys ward on Winchester City Council.

<text>Barry Ferguson (born 2 February 1978) is a Scottish football coach, former player and pundit who is the interim head coach of Scottish Premiership club Rangers.

Ferguson spent most of his playing career at Rangers, in two spells either side of a £7.5 million transfer to English club Blackburn Rovers. He totalled 431 games and 60 goals for Rangers, whom he captained between 2000 and 2003 and again between 2005 and 2009. Ferguson won the Scottish Premier League, Scottish Cup and Scottish League Cup five times apiece for Rangers, including a treble in 2003, which earned him the honour of SFWA Footballer of the Year. He also helped Rangers to reach the 2008 UEFA Cup final.
Ferguson made 45 appearances for the Scotland national team, starting from 1998. In 2009, following behavioural incidents while on national duty, he was stripped of the captaincy of Rangers and told he would no longer be considered for international selection.
Later in his career, he returned to England with Birmingham City, Blackpool and Fleetwood Town. Towards the end of his playing spell with Blackpool, he served as caretaker manager of the club. Ferguson was appointed player-manager of Clyde in June 2014; he resigned from this position in February 2017. He became manager of Kelty Hearts in October 2018, and he left them in May 2021 after guiding them to promotion to the SPFL for the first time. Ferguson then became manager of Alloa Athletic soon after, but left the club on 14 February after a run of one win in eleven games.

In February 2025, he was appointed interim head coach of Rangers.

==Early life==
Born in Hamilton into a Rangers-supporting family, Ferguson&#x27;s older brother Derek played for the club in the same midfield position in the 1980s, with the younger sibling often being invited behind the scenes at Ibrox Stadium as a child. 

Around the age of 8 he began playing for Mill United in Hamilton. In his early teens, although highly rated, he made it into the last thirty or so candidates for the Scotland Schoolboys squad at trials in Largs only to be rejected due to his stature, later recalling &quot;When I got out of the car, I went up and lay on my bed and thought to myself, &#x27;You know what? I&#x27;m going to go and show them... The same thing happened at Rangers. There was a father and son, and they were both from Ayrshire, and they were taking us at Rangers for the under-15s. We were playing Celtic, and I got took to the side and told, &#x27;Listen, it&#x27;s too physical a game for you. We&#x27;re not going to play you.&#x27; And I went away again and said to myself, &#x27;Either throw the towel in, or go and prove these people wrong.&#x27; Two or three years later, you&#x27;re beginning to chap the first-team door, and you&#x27;re walking past [the people who said you wouldn&#x27;t make it] and they&#x27;re saying, &#x27;I knew you were going to do it.&#x27;&quot;

Having trained with Rangers since 1991, Ferguson signed a professional contract upon finishing his education at Brannock High School in 1994. Aside from his brother, Ferguson&#x27;s idol was Ian Durrant, who was still an important player when he joined the club.

==Playing career==
===Club===
====Rangers (first spell)====
Ferguson was promoted to the first-team squad for the 1996–97 season. He made his debut on the last day of that season against Hearts on 10 May 1997. He made a number of sporadic appearances the following season under manager Walter Smith&#x27;s policy of easing him into the first team.

Ferguson became a regular fixture in the first team during the 1998–99 season under new manager Dick Advocaat (displacing fellow youth graduate Charlie Miller). The Dutchman soon secured Ferguson on a long-term contract as he became an important member of the squad. He scored his first career goal in a League Cup match against Alloa Athletic on 18 August 1998, and played against his brother on three occasions during that season when Rangers faced Dunfermline Athletic, with a 20-year-old Ferguson scoring his first league goal in the match at East End Park. His brother, then 31 years old, made his last appearance at Ibrox in the reverse fixture. Injury prevented him from being involved in the 1998–99 season run-in as the club achieved the treble; Ferguson watched the 1999 Scottish Cup final from the stands as Rangers won by a single goal, scored by Rod Wallace three minutes into the second half.

Ferguson was so influential the following season that he was given an extended six-year deal at Rangers in October 1999. He was named the Scottish Football Writers&#x27; Association Footballer of the Year for 1999–2000, a season in which Rangers retained the Premier League and Scottish Cup, beating Aberdeen in the final.

Ferguson received minor facial injuries after engaging in a drunken hotel brawl following a 6–2 defeat to Celtic in August 2000. After being sent off in the match, he had made obscene gestures to the crowd and then went drinking in Bothwell in his club tracksuit. When the club crashed out of the UEFA Champions League group stage at the hands of AS Monaco, largely because of a mistake by captain Lorenzo Amoruso, the Italian was stripped of the captaincy and it instead went to the 22-year-old Ferguson. An incident in which two bags of ice were thrown at the Celtic dug-out during a 2–0 defeat at Ibrox in September 2001 was attributed to Ferguson, who was criticised for his petulance and immaturity. Celtic manager Martin O&#x27;Neill played down the incident, saying he thought the ice had been thrown by his club&#x27;s doctor. The young Ferguson went on to successfully guide his team to a League Cup and Scottish Cup later that season under manager Alex McLeish, who had replaced Advocaat in December 2001. In the latter final, another Old Firm clash, Ferguson tied the score at 2–2 with a free kick (Peter Lovenkrands scored the winning goal).

During their second season together, 2002–03, Ferguson captained the side to a domestic treble. After scoring 18 goals from midfield, he also won Scottish Football Writers&#x27; Association Footballer of the Year and Scottish PFA Players&#x27; Player of the Year.

====Blackburn Rovers====
On 29 August 2003, Ferguson joined Premier League club Blackburn Rovers for a fee of £7.5 million. With Everton also chasing Ferguson, Rangers had initially denied that he was leaving. He made his Blackburn debut in a Premier League match against Liverpool on 19 September at Ewood Park, and scored his first goal against the same team, also at Ewood Park, during a League Cup match on 29 October.

Graeme Souness made Ferguson captain of Blackburn in July 2004 and he seemed to be adapting well to Premiership football, despite the team still struggling and a managerial change, which saw Mark Hughes replacing Souness. However, after 16 months at the club, including a lengthy period out through injury after fracturing his kneecap in a Premiership match against Newcastle United, during the January 2005 transfer window, Ferguson submitted a written transfer request, admitting that the draw of playing in the Premiership and a Lancashire derby could not compare with an Old Firm match, nor could the team&#x27;s desire to win be matched.

====Rangers (second spell)====
After much discussion between the clubs, a fee of £4.5 million was agreed and Ferguson rejoined Rangers just before the close of the transfer window. Ferguson later said that the fee Rangers paid was actually £100,000 plus the fees Blackburn owed from the original transfer. Ferguson&#x27;s second debut for Rangers came in a League Cup semi-final victory over Dundee United. He was a 69th-minute substitute for Alex Rae during the 7–1 win. His first goal after his return was the opening goal in a 1–1 draw against Inverness CT on 5 March 2005. Ferguson played in the 2005 Scottish League Cup final and was part of the Rangers team that won the league title on the last day of the season.
At the start of the 2005–06 season, manager Alex McLeish re-appointed Ferguson as club captain. McLeish had not wanted to remove the captaincy mid-season from Fernando Ricksen. Ferguson played the latter part of the season carrying an ankle injury as Rangers ended up in a third-place finish in the Premier League. At the end of the season, Ferguson revealed that he had snapped ligaments and confessed that he should have undergone the surgery sooner.

After an incident in the dressing room at Caledonian Stadium, Inverness, on 27 December 2006, it was announced on BBC Radio Scotland&#x27;s New Year&#x27;s Day broadcast of &quot;Sportsound&quot; that Ferguson had been stripped of the Rangers captaincy after a meeting with then manager Paul Le Guen. He was also dropped from the squad for the next match. Later Le Guen claimed Ferguson was undermining him. &quot;I&#x27;ll go on record as saying I never had one bust-up with him, never had one argument with him. I don&#x27;t know where all this comes from,&quot; explained Ferguson eleven years later. &quot;No disrespect to Inverness Caley – they had good players, no doubt – but we we&#x27;re Rangers here. We were dropping points against teams that we should be beating. So, I let it out a wee bit. There was no arguments, nothing in the dressing room. After I had said that, we flew back down to Glasgow. We were playing Motherwell next, I think, and I came in the day of, or the day before, the Motherwell game. I came in, put my bag down, Yves Colleu, who was the assistant manager, comes in and says, &#x27;Paul wants to speak to you&#x27;. I went into his office and went to sit down, and [Le Guen] said, &#x27;Don&#x27;t sit down. That&#x27;s you finished; you won&#x27;t play with Rangers again.&#x27;&quot;

The match at Motherwell was won 1–0 by Rangers, and goalscorer Kris Boyd reportedly showed solidarity with the deposed skipper by holding up six fingers, in reference to Ferguson&#x27;s shirt number. Following the resignation of Le Guen as manager on 4 January, Ferguson was re-instated to the Rangers side by caretaker manager Ian Durrant and was also re-appointed as captain. Later that year, sports journalist Graham Spiers published &quot;Paul Le Guen: Enigma&quot;, documenting his tenure at the club. According to Spiers, Le Guen left because he was being &quot;undermined&quot; by other Rangers personnel, including Ferguson and then club doctor, Ian McGuinness.

The 2007–08 season began with Ferguson scoring twice in the first SPL match against Inverness. His scoring form continued and he netted the second in a 3–0 win over rivals Celtic, as well as in the UEFA Champions League against VfB Stuttgart. The Old Firm goal was Ferguson&#x27;s first against Celtic since the 2002 Scottish Cup Final.

In January 2008, he scored a controversial goal in Rangers&#x27; 2007–08 Scottish League Cup semi-final win against Hearts. He later admitted to handling the ball in the buildup to the goal but that the infringement was unintentional. Rangers went on to win both the League Cup final and the Scottish Cup final.

On 14 May 2008, Ferguson made his 400th appearance for Rangers in the UEFA Cup Final against Zenit Saint Petersburg at the City of Manchester Stadium; he captained the side to a 2–0 defeat.
The summer of 2008 saw Ferguson undergo an operation on a fresh injury problem that would see him ruled out until early November; the injury was not the same one that plagued him towards the end of the season prior. He returned to the first team on 1 November in a 5–0 league win over Inverness at Ibrox.

In April 2009, after an extended hotel drinking session with Rangers teammate Allan McGregor after Scotland&#x27;s defeat to the Netherlands, followed by both players making inappropriate gestures while on the bench during the next match against Iceland, Ferguson was stripped of the captain&#x27;s armband for both club and country. He recovered from this setback to help Rangers win the 2009 Scottish Cup Final against Falkirk (his last match for the club, having not started since the Scotland incident). Rangers also won the SPL title but missed out on another treble with a defeat in the 2009 Scottish League Cup Final.

Ferguson was inducted into the Rangers F.C. Hall of Fame in 2004 at the age of 26.

====Appearance records====
Ferguson made 82 appearances in European competitions, all of them for Rangers, which made him the record European appearance holder at the club. Ferguson overtook David Narey&#x27;s record for the number of European appearances made whilst playing for a Scottish club by starting in a UEFA Cup match against Werder Bremen. He broke Kenny Dalglish&#x27;s record for the number of competitive European appearances by a Scottish footballer when he played in his 80th match in Europe, against Sporting CP.

====Birmingham City====

On 17 July 2009, Ferguson completed a move to English Premier League newcomers Birmingham City on a three-year contract for an undisclosed fee, reported as &quot;in the region of £1.2m&quot;. Joining up with boss Alex McLeish once again, the former Rangers manager said that Ferguson has &quot;unfinished business in England&quot; and that he believed the former Scottish international to be &quot;very capable of competing with the best players in the Premier League.&quot; He made his debut in the opening game of the season, against Manchester United on 15 August 2009, and his first goal for the club came as the only goal of the FA Cup third round replay against Nottingham Forest in January 2010. Ferguson won the Birmingham City players&#x27; Player of the Year award for 2009–10.

Ferguson helped Birmingham beat Arsenal in the 2011 League Cup Final at Wembley, despite playing the last hour of the game with a broken rib. During both of his two seasons with Birmingham, Ferguson made over two thousand passes without recording an assist. In season 2009–10 Ferguson had the highest number of completed passes of any player in the Barclays Premier League, according to Opta statistics.

====Blackpool====

With Birmingham needing to reduce their wage bill following their relegation from the Premier League, Ferguson joined Championship club Blackpool on 22 July 2011 for an undisclosed fee, reported to be around £750,000. This enabled him to move closer to his family in Scotland, and he signed a two-year deal, with the option of staying on for a further year. He was given the captain&#x27;s armband (taking over from Charlie Adam, who had departed for Liverpool) for the club&#x27;s opening League fixture at Hull City on 5 August.

Ferguson scored his first goal for &quot;the Seasiders&quot; in a 2–0 victory over Ipswich Town at Bloomfield Road on 10 September. It was his first goal in English league football for seven years.

In late October 2012, after a falling out with chairman Karl Oyston, Ferguson was made to train with the Blackpool youth team. Early the following month, he received a call from Micky Mellon, manager of nearby Fleetwood Town. Although he doubted Ferguson would want to play in League Two, Mellon put forward the offer of coming on loan. Ferguson accepted, the only such move of his career, and spent three months at Highbury Avenue.

Ferguson was reinstated to the side by Paul Ince on 20 February in his first game in charge, a 2–0 defeat at Leeds United. He had been named as a substitute for the previous couple of games, under the caretaker-managership of Steve Thompson. He was given the captain&#x27;s armband, in the absence of Alex Baptiste, for the home victory over Derby County on 26 April.

In October 2013, Ferguson had a sixth and final operation on his ankle, which kept him out until 3 December. &quot;After the surgery, the surgeon said, &quot;Right, it&#x27;s over. Don&#x27;t try [playing] again.&quot;

On 21 January 2014, Ferguson was installed as Blackpool&#x27;s caretaker manager in the wake of Ince&#x27;s sacking. &quot;I didn&#x27;t want to take it, but nobody else would take the job,&quot; Ferguson explained in 2020. &quot;And it was a chance to keep the club up.&quot; He initially stated that he would not be playing while in the managerial role, but on 12 April, at Leeds, he named himself in the starting line-up in an attempt to stave off the threat of relegation. &quot;Bob [Malcolm] says to me, &#x27;You&#x27;ll need to come back in.&#x27; I said, &#x27;Bob, I&#x27;ve not trained for six weeks.&#x27; He said, &#x27;You&#x27;ll need to come back and play; we&#x27;re struggling.&#x27;&quot;

Although Blackpool won only three of their twenty games with Ferguson in charge, they avoided relegation by two points. Ferguson left Blackpool at the end of the 2013–14 season.

===International===
Ferguson made twelve appearances for Scotland&#x27;s under-21 team. He made his full international debut at the age of 20 against Lithuania on 5 September 1998. However, an injury-plagued season prevented him from picking up more caps. Indeed, Ferguson did not return to the Scotland set up until a year later, starting in a 2–1 win against Bosnia-Herzegovina on 4 September 1999.

He was appointed captain of the national side in 2004 by then-manager Berti Vogts, following the retirement of Paul Lambert. Ferguson captained Scotland a total of 28 times. He led the side to a single-goal victory over former World Champions France 1–0 at the Parc des Princes in Paris on 12 September 2007. This completed a double-header of single-goal victories against the French during the UEFA Euro 2008 qualifying campaign.

Ferguson received criticism for being a disruptive influence on the team despite captaining his country for years. On 3 April 2009, he was banned from ever representing Scotland again after serious breaches of squad discipline, and the captain&#x27;s armband was given to Darren Fletcher. Additionally, Ferguson&#x27;s club, Rangers, stripped him of the captain&#x27;s role and suspended him for two weeks without pay.

Following the dismissal of George Burley as manager of Scotland, SFA chief executive Gordon Smith confirmed that the incoming manager would be free to select Ferguson should he so wish. On 6 July 2010, Scotland coach Craig Levein confirmed that Ferguson will not play for Scotland again. Levein had hoped he would return, but Ferguson informed him that he wanted to focus on club football instead.

==Coaching career==
===Clyde===
In June 2014, Ferguson was appointed player-manager of Scottish League Two club Clyde. Clyde were drawn away to Rangers in the Challenge Cup after a 2–0 home win against Ayr United; Rangers won 8–1. On 27 September, Ferguson made his playing debut against Annan Athletic in a 1–1 draw at Broadwood, but came off early in the second half with an injury. Towards the end of the 2–0 defeat to Lowland League club Spartans in the second round of the Scottish Cup, Ferguson was sent to the stands after a verbal altercation with Clyde supporters. In April 2015, Ferguson said that he had retired as a player.

In his second season at Clyde, the team came third and reached the play-offs, in which they defeated Elgin City 5–1 on aggregate in the semi-finals. In the final, however, they lost 3–2 to Queen&#x27;s Park, despite winning the second leg 1–0 at Hampden. Clyde went on a poor run of form during his third season, failing to win a league match in December, January or February. With the club sitting in eighth place in late February, Ferguson resigned.

===Kelty Hearts===
In October 2018, Ferguson had discussions with Lowland League club Kelty Hearts about becoming their new manager. He was offered and accepted the position later that month. Hearts finished third in the Lowland League in Ferguson&#x27;s first season in charge. They won the championship the following season, 2019–20, after it was curtailed due to the COVID-19 pandemic.

Ferguson guided Kelty into the SPFL for the first time in their history when they beat Brechin City over two legs in the Scottish League Two play-offs at the end of the 2020–21 campaign. The result also ended Brechin City&#x27;s 67-year stint in the senior leagues. A day after the play-offs ended, Ferguson left Kelty.

===Alloa Athletic===
Shortly after leaving Kelty, Ferguson was appointed manager of Alloa Athletic. After struggling in the league, the club announced on 14 February 2022 that Ferguson had tendered his resignation.

===Rangers===
On 24 February 2025, Ferguson was appointed as interim head coach of Scottish Premiership club Rangers following the dismissal of Philippe Clement. He invited former teammates Neil McCann, Billy Dodds and Allan McGregor onto the coaching group.

==Media career==
Ferguson regularly appears on STV&#x27;s &quot;Peter &amp; Roughie&#x27;s Football Show&quot; and the online sports show &quot;PLZ Soccer – Football Show&quot;. He also has a regular column in the &quot;Daily Record&quot; newspaper.

==Personal life==
Ferguson is married to Margaret, a trained psychologist. They have three children: Connor, Kyle and Cara. His son, Kyle, is also a professional footballer, a centre back who signed for Harrogate Town in June 2022.

During the 2014 Scottish independence referendum Ferguson was a supporter of the Better Together campaign against Scottish independence.

In July 2017 it was reported that Ferguson successfully applied for bankruptcy after running up debts of £1,425,633, whilst having only £3,000 worth of assets to help pay off his creditors. Ferguson exited bankruptcy in July 2018, having co-operated with an insolvency firm.

<text>Angeles (), officially the City of Angeles (; ), is a highly urbanized city in the Central Luzon region of the Philippines. According to the 2020 census, it has a population of 462,928 people.

While Angeles City is politically independent from the province of Pampanga, it is usually grouped with it for statistical purposes by the Philippine Statistics Authority and also it is the largest city of that province.

Angeles City is the urban core of Metro Clark, an urban area in Pampanga. This area, also known as Metro Angeles, is considered the industrial and residential heartland of Central Luzon. Metro Clark Angeles is also identified as a regional center by the national government.

==History==
===Spanish colonial era===

In 1796, the &quot;gobernadorcillo&quot; or town head of San Fernando, &quot;Don&quot; Ángel Pantaleón de Miranda, and his wife, &quot;Doña&quot; Rosalía de Jesús, along with some followers, staked out a new settlement, which they named &quot;Culiát&quot; because of the abundance of vines (&quot;Gnetum indicum&quot;) of that name in the area. The new settlers cleared the woodland and cultivated the area for rice and sugar farming. Don Ángel built his first house with light materials at the northwest corner of the intersection of Sapang Balen and the road going towards the town of Porac. It was later donated to the Catholic Church and became a cemetery called &quot;Campo Santong Matua&quot; (today the site of Nepomuceno Coliseum).

On May 12, 1812, the new settlers tried to make Culiat a self-governing town but the friars resisted the move, led by Fray José Pometa. Ten years later, on February 11, 1822, Don Ángel filed a petition for the township of Culiat to secede from San Fernando, but it was denied. This was followed by another petition within the same year, jointly signed by Don Ángel, his son-in-law, Mariano Henson, and the latter&#x27;s father, Severino Henson. He donated 35 hectares (86 acres) for the construction of the first Catholic church, a convent and a primary school while Doña Agustina Henson de Nepomuceno, the niece of who would become the first &quot; of Angeles in 1830, Don Ciriaco de Miranda, gave land for the new public market. Don Ángel paid the complete amount required by law just for the secession of Culiat from San Fernando. There were only 160 taxpayers then but the law required that it should have at least 500 taxpayers.

Located some north of Pampanga&#x27;s capital, Culiat became a barrio of San Fernando for 33 years and on December 8, 1829, became a separate municipality. The newly-autonomous town was renamed &quot; in honor of its patron saints, the Holy Angels, and the name of its founder, Don Ángel, coinciding with the rise of new &quot;barrios&quot; such as Santo Cristo (as the &quot;población&quot; or town proper), Cutcut, Pampang and Pulong Anunas. The progressive barrios developed some new industries like a sugar mill and a wine distillery. The transition of Angeles from a jungle clearing to a barrio, to a town and finally to a city took 168 years and in all that time, it survived locusts&#x27; infestations, wars, epidemics, volcanic eruptions and typhoons to become one of the fast rising towns in the country. When it received its first official municipal charter, the town contained some 661 people, 151 houses and an area of 38.65 km2.

On May 7, 1899, General Emilio Aguinaldo transferred the seat of the First Philippine Republic to Angeles. It then became the site of celebrations for the first anniversary of Philippine independence, which was proclaimed a year earlier in Kawit, Cavite. Events included a parade, led by the youngest ever Filipino generals, Gregorio del Pilar and Manuel Tinio, with General Aguinaldo viewing the proceedings from the Pamintuan Residence, which was the Presidential Palace from May to July 1899 (and later was the Central Bank of the Philippines office in Central Luzon, before its ownership passed to the National Historical Commission of the Philippines). Aguinaldo&#x27;s sojourn was short, however, for in July of this same year he transferred his government to the province of Tarlac following Angeles&#x27; occupation by the American forces.

===American invasion era===
On August 10, 1899, U.S. forces began the attack on Angeles confident in capturing it in a few days. However, the Filipino Army defending the town refused to give in so easily and fiercely fought back and for three months, they battled the Americans in and around the town. It was only after the battle on November 5, 1899, that the town finally fell into American hands. The Battle of Angeles was considered to be the longest in the history of the Filipino-American War in Pampanga. This led to the establishment of an American camp in Barrio Talimundoc (in what is now Lourdes Sur), located next to the railroad station, in order to establish control over the central plains of Luzon. In January 1900, General Frederick D. Grant organized the first U.S. Civil Government in Angeles by appointing an &quot;alcalde&quot; or municipal mayor, beginning American rule over Angeles.

In 1902, the United States Army studied relocating their post from Barrio Talimundoc to a fertile plain in Barrio Sapang Bato, which supposedly had better grass for their horses. A year after that, U.S. President Theodore Roosevelt signed an executive order on September 1, establishing of land in Sapang Bato as Fort Stotsenburg (which later would expand to in 1908 to become Clark Air Base). It was centered on what would in later years become Clark Air Base&#x27;s parade ground.

The Americans quickly commandeered Holy Rosary Parish Church and converted it into an army hospital, with the choir loft served as a dental clinic. The &quot;convento&quot;, which now houses Holy Family Academy, was the barracks for medical officers and enlisted men. The sacristy was the only portion where Angeleños could hear Mass. When the Americans finally vacated the church in 1904 and relocated to Fort Stotsenburg, parish priest Rev. Vicente Lapus listed a total of US$638 for portions of the church destroyed, looted church items and treasures, and arrears on rentals.

===World War II===
Hours after the attack on Pearl Harbor, Japan attacked the Philippines, targeting the American military presence, as well as the Philippine Army, and taking over the civilian government. During the Japanese occupation in the country, 57,000 Filipino and American prisoners of war passed the town of Angeles. They were forced to join the Bataan Death March, going to Camp O&#x27;Donnell in Capas, Tarlac. Angeleños showed their sympathy by handing them food, milk, boiled eggs, rice cakes, cigarettes, and water. Angeleños followed them up to the train station in Dau railway station in Mabalacat to give moral and spiritual support, and even helped the escapees.

War historians considered the bombing of Fort Stotsenburg on December 8, 1941, at 12:30 p.m. as one of the most destructive air raids in World War II, because almost all the American war planes were wrecked on the ground. In thirty minutes, the air might of the United States in the Far East was completely destroyed.

On the early morning of New Year&#x27;s Day 1942, the first Japanese troops entered Angeles; they would occupy it until January 1945. During the Japanese invasion, another type of local government was set up on January 22, 1942. During the Japanese occupation, Clark Air Base then became a major center for staging Japanese air operations. Japanese aircraft flying out of Clark participated in the Battle of Leyte Gulf, considered to be the largest naval battle of the Second World War and possibly the largest naval battle in history.

Clark Air Base was recaptured by the Americans in January 1945, after three months of fierce fighting in the Philippines. After three years of atrocities committed by Japanese forces, the town and the rest of the Philippines were finally liberated by the combined United States and Philippine Commonwealth troops in 1945. The building of the general headquarters of the Philippine Commonwealth Army and Philippine Constabulary was situated in Angeles from January 1945 to June 1946, during and after World War II.

===Philippine independence===
====Cityhood====

After World War II, the Philippines gained independence from the United States on July 4, 1946, but then would be tied to a neo-colonial relationship. The &quot;Treaty of General Relations&quot; signed on independence day itself signified the Americans&#x27; withdrawal and surrender of possession, control and sovereignty over the Philippines, except the use of their bases. It was followed by the Philippine-American Military Bases Agreement on March 14, 1947, allowing the U.S. to maintain territorial integrity and sovereignty over Clark Air Base and Subic Naval Base for the next 44 years. Clark occupied 63,103 hectares and served as the tactical operational U.S. air force installation in the entire Southeast Asian region that had the capacity to accommodate the U.S. military transport planes, which served the entire Western Pacific.

Through the years, although Fort Stotsenburg continued to expand to become what would eventually be known as Clark Air Base, Angeles, despite its proximity to the American camp, did not progress fast and remained fairly small until the end of World War II. It was finally inaugurated on January 1, 1964, as a chartered city under Republic Act No. 3700 and then proceeded to enter a period of tremendous growth that resulted in its present position as the &quot;Premier City in Central Luzon&quot;. It was through Mayor Rafael del Rosario&#x27;s brainchild that Angeles became a city. He gained the distinction of being the last municipal mayor of Angeles. He was assisted in the preparation of the City Chapter by Attorney Enrique Tayag, a prominent resident of the town. Congresswoman Juanita L. Nepomuceno of the first district of Pampanga sponsored the bill in Congress, which was approved by then President Diosdado Macapagal, the ninth Philippine president and a native of the province of Pampanga.

====Mount Pinatubo eruption and Angeles today====

On June 15, 1991, Angeles was affected by the cataclysmic eruption of nearby Mount Pinatubo, with up to 60,000 people being evacuated from the city. It was the second-largest volcanic eruption of the twentieth century and, by far, the largest eruption to affect a densely populated area. The province of Pampanga, Clark specifically, was badly hit and the agricultural lands, as well as other businesses, were covered by tons of lahar. There were no casualties reported inside Clark two days from the initial eruption because the 18,000 personnel and their families were transported to Guam and the Subic Naval Base in Zambales.

The eruption of Mount Pinatubo forced the leadership of the U.S. to prematurely abandon its military installation at Clark Air Base. This was in addition to a vote by the Philippine Senate in 1991 to no longer extend the Laurel–Langley Agreement, which allowed the presence of U.S. military forces on Philippine territory, thus ending the long chapter of Filipino-American relations in the history of Angeles. The U.S. military never returned to Clark, turning over the damaged base to the Philippine government on November 26, 1991

In 1993, cleanup and removal of volcanic ash deposits began. The former base re-emerged as Clark Special Economic Zone (CSEZ) approved by then President Fidel V. Ramos on April 3 of the same year. The airfield infrastructure was improved and destined to be the premiere airport in the country in the next five years and one of the most modern in Asia. The creation of CSEZ has helped to offset the loss of income and jobs previously generated by the presence of the U.S. base. Today, Angeles and Clark together form the hub for business, industry, aviation and tourism, as well as the entertainment and gaming center of Central Luzon.

Among the draws for tourists is the local dish sisig which according to the Center for Kapampangan Studies, originated in this Angeles and has been on the menu since the 1730s. Pampanga is well known as the culinary center of the Philippines.

In 2018, Angeles applied to be a UNESCO Creative City, while it also applied &quot;sisig&quot; into the UNESCO List of Intangible Cultural Heritage. The applications are currently being processed by UNESCO.

A recent racial study showed that Angeles City, Pampanga; alongside Manila; and Olongapo, Zambales; was the locations of several concentrations of 250,000 Amerasians (Mixed American-Asians) who were born as a result of the American colonization of the Philippines and the presence of US bases in the country.

== Geography ==
It is bordered by Mabalacat to the north, Mexico to the east, San Fernando to the southeast, Bacolor to the south, and Porac to the southwest and west. Though the city administers itself autonomously from Pampanga, it is the province&#x27;s commercial and financial hub.

Angeles is served by Clark International Airport in Clark Freeport Zone.

Angeles is from Manila and from the provincial capital, San Fernando.

===Climate===
Under the Köppen climate classification system, Angeles has a tropical savanna climate that borders on a tropical monsoon climate (Köppen climate classification Aw/Am).
Angeles experiences two distinct seasons: a dry season from November through April, with a wet season from May through October. From 1953 to 1991, the mean daily low was 22.6 °C and the mean daily high was 31.3 °C, with June being warmest and January and February being the coolest. The average annual rainfall is 2026.8 mm. Typhoons tend to approach from the east during the summer and fall. Many damaging storms struck the city, including Typhoon Irma on November 28, 1974 (generally considered to be the strongest one); Typhoon Rita on October 27, 1978; Typhoon Irma (the name was reused) on November 24, 1981; Typhoon Ruby on October 25, 1988; and Typhoon Yunya on June 15, 1991, which coincided with the Mount Pinatubo blast. In July 1972, Central Luzon experienced a month of nearly continuous rain, resulting in ± falling on the plain around Angeles.

===Languages===
Kapampangan is the predominant language of the city, along with Tagalog. English is also widely spoken. Angeles City is also home to the majority of Chinese Filipinos that live in Pampanga, a large portion of these Chinese Filipinos have Philippine Hokkien or (咱人話) as their main language. Due to the growing Korean population in Angeles City, Korean is also spoken by the Korean expatriates that are residing in Angeles City.

===Religion===
The majority of the population of Angeles is Catholic. At least two major festivals associated with the Catholic faith are held in October in the city. Commemorating the victory of the Spanish fleet over the Dutch Navy in 1646, the La Naval Fiesta is celebrated in honor of the Our Lady of La Naval de Manila with adherents believing that her intercession was instrumental to the Spaniards&#x27; naval victory. The Apu Fiesta involves devotees from all over Pampanga making a visit to the Apu shrine to venerate the image of Jesus Christ lying in the sepulchre which is believed to be miraculous by believers.

=== Expatriate and immigrant community ===
Owing to the presence of the nearby U.S. Clark Air Force Base and consequent Freeport Zone, many Americans chose to permanently settle in the area, particularly in the Balibago district, and thus Angeles became home to a large colony of expatriates. During the American colonial period (1898–1946), more than 800,000 Americans were born in the Philippines, and a large concentration of Filipino mestizos or Filipinos with American ancestry were located in this city.

== Economy ==
Being home of the former Clark Air Base (once the largest United States military facility outside the continental United States), it was significantly affected by the fallout from the eruption of Mount Pinatubo in 1991. The economy of Angeles was heavily dependent on the American base at that time.

In 1993, a full cleanup and removal of volcanic ash deposits began and the former U.S. base was transformed into the Clark Special Economic Zone (CSEZ). The creation of CSEZ has helped to offset the loss of income and jobs previously generated by the presence of the U.S. base in the city. Today, Angeles and Clark form the hub for business, industry, aviation, and tourism in the Philippines as well as a leisure, fitness, entertainment and gaming center of Central Luzon.

Angeles is home to an emerging technology industry. Its economy is based also on tourism and gambling. Fields Avenue forms the hub of the night life industry focused in Angeles. With close proximity to an international airport in Clark Freeport, Angeles is visited by foreigners all year round.
In the 2000s, the local government of Angeles rebranded the Fields Avenue tourist belt as a high-end destination with fine restaurants and luxury hotels and casinos The finishing of roads, such as the Subic–Clark–Tarlac Expressway, has improved trade and transport. The project connects the industrial, transport and business hubs of Pampanga, Zambales, Bataan and Tarlac. The project is crucial to bolstering growth in Central Luzon.

The city has cottage industries producing rattan furniture, coconuts, and charcoal briquettes. It also has many thriving export businesses in handicrafts, metal crafts, toys, houseware and garments. Apart from the Clark Freeport Zone, industrial areas include the Angeles Livelihood Village and the Angeles City Industrial Estate.

Call centers present are e-Telecare, CyberCity, Sutherland and IRMC. Other American IT industries are major employers as well. The establishment of a number of shopping malls also fueled the city&#x27;s economy, including SM City Clark, Robinsons Angeles, Jenra Grand Mall, Nepo Mall, Saver&#x27;s Mall and the Marquee Mall, next to City Hall.

Angeles City houses numerous restaurants that are usually located near the malls and mostly in Nepo Quad which was newly renovated to cater the heightened needs of the population.

==Culture==

The city hosts a street party called the Tigtigan Terakan keng Dalan () every October which features musical performances from both amateur and better-known OPM bands. Through &quot;Presidential Proclamation 696&quot;, October 26, 2024 was declared a special non-working day in celebration of its Tigtigan Terakan Keng Dalan Festival.

The Sisig Festival, locally known as the Sadsaran Qng Angeles, festivities dedicated to the Kapampangan dish &quot;sisig&quot;, used to be held every December. It was halted in 2008 following the murder of Lucia Cunanan, who was known for promoting the dish. The festival was revived as a one-day fiesta in April 2017 in association with the Department of Tourism.

==Tourism==
Angeles is promoted as a gastronomy tourist destination and is billed as the &quot;culinary capital&quot; of the Philippines.

Angeles is also situated within the perimeter of the Clark Freeport Zone.

===Sex tourism===
A consequence of the presence of U.S. bases in the country is the prostitution industry in the city. Since the early days of Clark Air Base, Fields Avenue in Balibago district is an area frequently visited by the U.S. servicemen, has been known as a center for prostitution and sex tourism.
A BBC article characterized it as &quot;the centre of the Philippines sex industry&quot; and dubbed it &quot;Sin City&quot;.

<text>The Waikiki Natatorium War Memorial is a war memorial in Honolulu, Hawaii, USA, built in the form of an ocean water public swimming pool. The Natatorium was built as a living memorial dedicated to &quot;the men and women who served during the great war&quot; (now known as World War I).

== Creation of the memorial ==
In March 1918, the Daughters and Sons of Hawaiian Warriors first proposed a memorial to the more than 10,000 men from the then Territory of Hawaii who volunteered to serve in the great war. The Honolulu Ad Club agreed with the idea and on November 20, 1918, appointed an investigative committee led by Colonel Howard Hathaway, Ned Loomis, and W.D. Westervelt to bring together representatives from all civic organizations to collaborate on the concept of a memorial beginning with a conference which was held on December 6, 1918. At this meeting, Colonel Hathway was appointed Chairman and Fred W. Beckley was appointed Secretary of the general committee on a war memorial.

At the second meeting, a subcommittee was formed to investigate and prepare a report on the design and cost estimates of a war memorial. This subcommittee included:
*Princess Kalanianaole
*Mrs. Walter Macfarlane
*Mrs. A. A. Young
*Mrs. J.M. Dowsett
*C.R. Hemenway
*Senator John H. Wise
*J.D. McInerny
Upon the report of the subcommittee, a plan to acquire the former William G. Irwin Estate (located between the shoreline and Kapiolani Park in Waikiki) for a public park for the memorial gained unanimous support. To pursue the idea, John Guild, Mrs. Walter Macfarlane, Mrs. John Baird, Mrs. A.G.M. Robertson, and Alexander Rume Ford took the lead in pursuing the property.

A bill passed through the territorial legislature with &quot;practical unanimity&quot; according to the Historical Commission of Honolulu. The act was signed by the governor on April 29, 1919, providing for the acquisition of the Irwin property through the sale of territorial bonds and provided that the property should be named &quot;Memorial Park&quot; for the memorial concept being discussed by the committee on a war memorial.

Memorial Park was formally dedicated on the first anniversary of the signing of the armistice with the dedication organized by the recently formed organization, the American Legion.

In 1920, with the memorial&#x27;s site now acquired, a committee to study and recommend designs for the memorial itself was organized. The Honolulu Historical Commission, Territory of Hawaii, lists the members of the memorial committee as:

*J.K. Butler
*L.S. Cain
*A.L.C. Atkinson
*A.T. Longley
*H.P. O&#x27;Sullivan
*Norman Watkins
*Senator L.M. Judd
*J.R. Galt
*L.B. Reeves
*Alexander May
*R.L. Richards
*G.H. Angus
*Sherwood Lowrey
*R.N. Burnham for the Rotary Club
*Milo Vanek for the Ad Club
*Gordon Usborne for the Hawaiian Academy of Art and Design.

After much deliberation, the committee reported its final recommendation for the war memorial. According to the Historical Commission of the Territory of Hawaii, &quot;the scheme evolved called for a memorial natatorium with a pavilion and attractive landscaping of Memorial Park, the swimming pool itself to be of Olympic proportions&quot;.

On the opening day of the 1921 Territorial Legislature, Senator L.M. Judd introduced a bill for the construction of a war memorial at Memorial Park, to be funded by issuing territorial bonds. The bill specified that the memorial is to be dedicated to &quot;the men and women of Hawaii who served during the great war&quot; which was an expansion from the initial concept which was to honor the men of Hawaii who died in service during World War I.

The bill was passed by both houses of the legislature and signed by the governor on March 15, 1921, becoming Act 15.

Act 15, set three requirements for the design of the memorial:
#It is to be located at Memorial Park, Waikiki
#That it &quot;shall contain a swimming course of at least 100 meters&quot;; and
#All other design elements were to be determined by a design contest with features chosen by a Territorial War Commission appointed by the Governor.

== Territorial War Memorial Commission ==
Act 15 provided for the formation of a Territorial War Memorial Commission to determine the features of the memorial beyond the requirements set out by law: the swimming course of 100 meters and the location. Governor Charles J. McCarthy appointed the members of the commission:
A. Lester Marks, Chairman
John R. Galt, Secretary
A.L.C. Atkinson, later replaced by J.K. Butler

Louis Christian Mullgardt, a Fellow of the American Institute of Architects (AIA), was appointed as an advisory architect to prepare a general scheme for the park and to plan and execute a competition following the rules set forth by the AIA.

The jury to determine the winning design was composed of:
The Governor of the Territory of Hawaii
The Mayor of Honolulu
Architect Bernard R. Maybeck of San Francisco
Architect Ellis F. Lawrence of Portland
Architect W. R. B. Willcox of Seattle

The jury selected the design by San Francisco architect Lewis P. Hobart as the first prize.
&quot;It reveals a fine, discriminating taste and ability in architectural design, and in such landscape treatment as reflects the highly individual color and flavor of Hawaii and Honolulu; it forecasts a memorial which will sustain an appropriate interest into the distant future, and perpetuate the noble thought and purpose which animated the original conception of the project.&quot; - The judges of the War Memorial Commission&#x27;s design contest of the winning design by Architect Lewis P. Hobart

== Current state ==
Located in Honolulu, at the shore west of Kapiolani Park and completed in 1927, the natatorium was built in the Hawaiian Beaux-Arts architectural style. The entrance to the memorial includes an arch featuring four stone eagles typical of this style.

Inside the memorial is a 100-meter by 40-meter saltwater swimming pool. In the opening ceremonies on August 24, 1927, the local Olympic gold medal holder Duke Kahanamoku made the first swim (it was his birthday).
In the following swim meet, world record holder Johnny Weissmuller won the 100, 400 and 800-meter events, and Buster Crabbe (also local) won the 1500 meters.

After the attack on Pearl Harbor in 1941, the natatorium was taken over by the US Army and used for training during World War II. In 1949 it was refurbished and turned over to the City and County of Honolulu on July 1, 1949. Its condition deteriorated, and was officially closed in 1963, but continued to be used.

It was added to the National Register of Historic Places listings in Oahu on August 11, 1980, as site 80001283.

There have been several proposals to demolish the structure, while others argue for its preservation and repair.
For generations, the natatorium was a popular recreational gathering center for residents and tourists. However, it closed to the public in 1979 due to safety concerns and city council political support has oscillated between renovation and demolition of the structure.

=== 2018–2019 Renovation and reopening draft study ===
In 2018–2019, the City and County of Honolulu began a study to see about reopening the memorial, which has been closed to the public since approximately 1979. The draft study is available online and allows the city to proceed with research on alternatives that will allow the memorial to be brought into a usable condition and to resolve hazards that prevent the memorial from being a proud representation and tribute to WW1 veterans.

The EIS study notes the &quot;significant and adverse&quot; socio-cultural impact if no action is taken to improve the dilapidated structure. The city mayor estimates the preferred option of renovation to cost around USD 25.6 million.

==Kaimana Beach==

Adjacent to the south of the Natatorium lies Kaimana Beach, a popular destination for the resident Honolulu population of the Kaimuki, Manoa, Diamond Head and other surrounding communities. Kaimana is a sandy beach lined with palms with a lifeguard tower, showers and public parking.

Kaimana Beach was originally a rocky beach with a narrow strip of sand. It is also known as Sans Souci Beach, (French for &quot;without worries&quot;) for the hotel once run by George Lycurgus in 1893, named in turn after the Sanssouci Palace in Potsdam.

After the Waikiki War Memorial Natatorium was built adjacent to Kaimana and just off the shoreline, the beach was able to accumulate a vastly wider sandy beach which makes it so popular today. The name Kaimana is not an ancient Hawaiian name for the area, but is rather the Hawaiian pronunciation of the English name for the nearby Diamond Head. The former Sans Souci site is now the New Otani Kaimana Beach Hotel.

Kaimana Beach was the end point of the first submarine communications cable between California and Hawaii. Duke Kahanamoku&#x27;s uncle, David Piikoi, was said to have been the person who dragged the underwater cable through Kapua Channel and onto Kaimana&#x27;s shore in 1902. The first telegraphic message over this new cable was sent on January 1, 1903, from Henry Ernest Cooper to President Theodore Roosevelt in Washington, DC.

<text>Antillia (or Antilia) is a phantom island that was reputed, during the 15th-century age of exploration, to lie in the Atlantic Ocean, far to the west of Portugal and Spain. The island also went by the name of Isle of Seven Cities (&quot;Ilha das Sete Cidades&quot; in Portuguese, &quot;Isla de las Siete Ciudades&quot; in Spanish).

It originates from an old Iberian legend, set during the Muslim conquest of Hispania . Seeking to flee from the Muslim conquerors, seven Christian Visigothic bishops embarked with their flocks on ships and set sail westwards into the Atlantic Ocean, eventually landing on an island (&quot;Antillia&quot;) where they founded seven settlements.

The island makes its first explicit appearance as a large rectangular island in the 1424 portolan chart of Zuane Pizzigano. Thereafter, it routinely appeared in most nautical charts of the 15th century. After 1492, when the north Atlantic Ocean began to be routinely sailed and became more accurately mapped, depictions of Antillia gradually disappeared. It nonetheless lent its name to the Spanish Antilles.

The routine appearance of such a large &quot;Antillia&quot; in 15th-century nautical charts has led to speculation that it might represent the American landmass, and has fueled many theories of pre-Columbian trans-oceanic contact.

== Legend ==

Stories of islands in the Atlantic Ocean, legendary and otherwise, have been reported since classical antiquity. Utopian tales of the Fortunate Islands (or Isles of the Blessed) were sung by poets like Homer and Horace. Plato articulated the utopian legend of Atlantis. Ancient writers like Plutarch, Strabo, and, more explicitly, Pliny the Elder and Ptolemy, testified to the existence of the Canary Islands. The names of some real islands re-emerged as distinct mythical islands with associated legends, e.g. &quot;capraria&quot; (the island of goats) and &quot;canaria&quot; (the island of dogs) are often found on maps separately from the Canary Islands (e.g. Pizzigani brothers, 1367).

The Middle Ages saw the emergence of Christian versions of these tales. Notable among these are the Irish immrama (tales of a hero&#x27;s journey to the Otherworld), such as the immram of Uí Corra, or the sea voyages of the 6th-century Irish missionaries Saint Brendan and Saint Malo. These are the source for several legendary Atlantic islands such as Saint Brendan&#x27;s Island and the Island of Ima. The sagas of Norse seafarers to Greenland and Vinland, notably the Grœnlendinga saga and the saga of Erik the Red, have also been influential. Norse encounters with North American indigenous peoples seem to have filtered into Irish &quot;immrama&quot;.

The peoples of the Iberian Peninsula, who were closest to the real Atlantic islands of the Canaries, Madeira and Azores, and whose seafarers and fishermen may have seen and even visited them, articulated their own tales. Medieval Andalusian Arabs related stories of Atlantic island encounters in the legend (told by al-Masudi) of the 9th-century navigator Khashkhash of Cordoba and the 12th-century story (told by al-Idrisi) of the eight &quot;Maghrurin&quot; (Wanderers) of Lisbon.

Given the tendency of the legends of different seafarers – Greek, Norse, Irish, Arab and Iberian – to cross-fertilize and influence each other, the exact source of some legendary Atlantic islands – such as the mythical islands of Brasil and the Isle of Mam – are extremely difficult to disentangle.

It is from Christian Iberia that the legend of &quot;Antillia&quot; emerged. According to the legend, in c. 714, during the Muslim conquest of Hispania, seven Christian bishops of Visigothic Hispania, led by the Bishop of Porto, embarked with their parishioners on ships and set sail westward into the Atlantic Ocean to escape the Arab conquerors. They stumbled upon an island and decided to settle there, burning their ships to permanently sever their link to their now Muslim-dominated former homeland. The bishops erected seven settlements (the &quot;Seven Cities&quot;) on the island. In one reading (from Grazioso Benincasa), the seven cities are named Aira, Antuab, Ansalli, Ansesseli, Ansodi, Ansolli and Con.

The legend, in this form, is told in various places. The principal source is an inscription on Martin Behaim&#x27;s 1492 Nuremberg globe which reads (in English translation):


The legend is also found inscribed in the 1507/08 map of Johannes Ruysch, which reads (in English):
Ruysch&#x27;s inscription is reproduced almost verbatim in the &quot;Libro&quot; of Spanish historian Pedro de Medina (1548). Medina gives the island&#x27;s dimensions as 87 leagues in length and 28 in width, with &quot;many good ports and rivers&quot;, and says it is situated on the latitude of the Straits of Gibraltar, that sailors have seen it from a distance, but disappears when they approach it.

The adjustment to the 714 date and the burning of the ships is due to Ferdinand Columbus (1539), who also reports an alleged encounter with the islanders by a Portuguese ship in the time of Henry the Navigator (c. 1430s–1440s). António Galvão (1563) reports that a 1447 Portuguese ship stumbled on the island, and met its (Portuguese-speaking) inhabitants, who reported they had fled there in the &quot;time of Roderic&quot; and asked whether the Moors still dominated Hispania. More elaborate versions of this story have been told in more modern times.

Yet another variant of the tale is told in Manuel de Faria e Sousa (1628), of Sacaru, a Visigothic governor of Mérida. Besieged by the Muslim armies and finding his situation hopeless, Sacaru negotiated capitulation, and proceeded, with all who wished to follow him, to embark on a fleet for exile in the Canary islands. Faria e Sousa notes they may not have reached their destination, but may have ended up instead on an Atlantic Ocean island &quot;populated by Portuguese, that has seven cities ... which some imagine to be that one which can be seen from Madeira, but when they wish to reach it, disappears&quot;.

The island is mentioned in a royal letter of King Afonso V of Portugal (dated 10 November 1475), where he grants the knight Fernão Teles &quot;the Seven Cities and any other populated islands&quot; he might find in the western Atlantic Ocean. It is mentioned again in a royal letter (dated 24 July 1486), issued by King John II of Portugal at the request of Fernão Dulmo authorizing him to search for and &quot;discover the island of Seven Cities&quot;.

Already by the 1490s, there are rumors that silver can be found in the island&#x27;s sands. In the 16th century, the legend gave rise to the independent Spanish legends of the Seven Cities of Gold, reputed by mercenary conquistadors to be fabulously wealthy and located somewhere on the mainland of America.

== Etymology ==
The term &quot;Antillia&quot; is probably derived from the Portuguese &quot;Ante-Ilha&quot; (&quot;Fore-Island&quot;, &quot;Island of the Other&quot;, or &quot;Opposite Island&quot;). It may be a reference to the belief that the island lay directly &quot;opposite&quot; from mainland Portugal (as it is usually charted), consistent with the Seven Cities story. Its size and rectangular shape is a near-mirror image of the Kingdom of Portugal itself. Some suggest the &quot;ante-ilha&quot; etymology might be older, possibly related in meaning to the &quot;Aprositus&quot; (&quot;the Inaccessible&quot;), the name reported by Ptolemy for one of the Fortunate Isles.

Others regard the &quot;ante-ilha&quot; etymology as unsatisfactory, on the basis that &quot;ante&quot;, in geographical usage, suggests it sits opposite another island, not a continent. As a result, alternative etymological theories of &quot;Antillia&quot; abound. One theory was that &quot;Antillia&quot; is merely a poorly-transcribed reference to Plato&#x27;s &quot;Atlantis&quot;. Another is that it is a corruption of &quot;Getulia&quot;, an ancient Roman name for a geographical location in northwestern Africa. Another theory, famously forwarded by Alexander von Humboldt, is that it comes from the Arabic &quot;al-Tin&quot; or &quot;al-Tennyn&quot;, for &quot;dragon&quot;, a reference to the old Arab legends about sea dragons on the edge of the ocean (frequently depicted in Arab maritime charts), and that the island may have been known as &quot;Jezirat al Tennyn&quot;, or &quot;Dragon&#x27;s Isle&quot;, in Andalusian Arab legend.

One more recent hypothesis (although not finding wide acceptance), is that &quot;Antillia&quot; may mean &quot;in front of Thule&quot;. Sometimes written &quot;Tile&quot;, Thule was a semi-mythical reference to Iceland, already spoken of in classical sources. If so, then &quot;ante Tile&quot;, the &quot;island before Thule&quot;, might very well be Ireland, which might have had seven &quot;cities&quot; at the time. This theory, however, seems highly speculative. Ireland (&quot;Hibernia&quot;) was well-known and appears distinctly on all 15th-century maps.

In a fresh work on the subject, the author Demetrio Charalambous notes that in medieval maps, the name of the island is written Antylia, which is inconsistent with the interpretation commonly accepted that the name means &quot;ante-ilha&quot; in Portuguese. No medieval map records the name &quot;Antilha&quot;, by which the author dismisses the name as being Portuguese. Instead, he noted that the first cartographers to mention the island (although they did not represent it) were Francesco and Domenico Pizigano in 1367, who called it Antullia. From this follows that the name means &quot;Anti-Tullia&quot;, i.e. Anti-Thule, later transformed into Antyllia, and finally Antillia. According to his interpretation, the name denotes the island opposite to Tyle, but this does not mean it is before Iceland, but beyond it, as represented in the maps. The name means the island opposite to Tyle by sailing southwest, and therefore refers to America.

== Cartographic representation ==

The rediscovery of the Canary Islands by Europeans in the 14th century revived an interest in Atlantic island myths. With the existence of lands out in the Atlantic Ocean confirmed, 14th-century European geographers began plumbing the old legends and plotting and naming many of these mythical islands on their nautical charts, alongside the new discoveries. Mythical Atlantic islands litter the early 14th-century portolan charts of Pietro Vesconte and Angelino Dulcert.

Some historians believe the legend of &quot;Antillia&quot; was first insinuated cartographically in the 1367 portolan of the Venetian brothers Domenico and Francesco Pizzigano. This was insinuated by an inscription (albeit with no island) on the western edge of the map, which was read by some 19th-century historians as referring to &quot;statues on the shores of &quot;Atullia&quot;&quot; (&quot;ante ripas Atulliae&quot;) beyond which sailors should not pass. However, later readings have suggested it should be read as the statues of &quot;Arcules&quot; (Hercules), and that the inscription&#x27;s reference is probably to the Pillars of Hercules, the &quot;non plus ultra&quot; (outer limits) of ancient navigation, and not Antillia.
Antillia makes its first unambiguous appearance in the 1424 portolan chart of Venetian cartographer Zuane Pizzigano, as part of a group of four islands, lying far in the Atlantic Ocean some 250 leagues west of Portugal, and 200 leagues west of the Azores archipelago (which also usually depicted in contemporary charts). Pizzigano drew Antillia as a large, red, rectangular island, indented with bays and dotted with seven settlements, with the inscription &quot;ista ixola dixemo antilia&quot; (&quot;this island we call antillia&quot;, in Venetian). Some sixty leagues north of it is the comparable large blue Satanazes island (&quot;ista ixolla dixemo satanazes&quot;, called Satanagio/Satanaxio/Salvagio in later maps), capped by a small umbrella-shaped &quot;Saya&quot; (called &quot;Tanmar&quot; or &quot;Danmar&quot; in later maps). Some twenty leagues west of Antilia is the small blue companion island of &quot;Ymana&quot; (the &#x27;Royllo&#x27; of later maps). These four islands will be collectively drawn together in many later 15th-century maps, with the same relative size, position and shape Pizzigano gave them in 1424. They are commonly referred to collectively as the &quot;Antillia group&quot; or (to use Beccario&#x27;s label) the &quot;insulae de novo rep(er)te&quot; (&quot;islands newly reported&quot;).

Cartographic appearances of Antillia (in chronological order):

As is evident, on some maps (e.g. Pareto, Soligo, Behaim), Antillia appears without Satanazes.

Significantly, although included in his map of 1436, the Antillia group is omitted in the later Andrea Bianco map of 1448, although some authors believe that two rectangular islands depicted by Bianco much further south (in the environs of Cape Verde), and labelled merely &quot;dos ermanos&quot; (&quot;two brothers&quot;) may be a reference to Antilia and Satanazes.

The controversial and possibly fake Vinland map, dated by its supporters around 1440, shows the outlines of Antillia and Satanazes islands (but not the two smaller ones) under the general label &quot;Magnae insulae Beati Brandani&quot; (great islands of St Brendan).

Antillia (and all its companions) are conspicuously omitted in the map of Gabriel de Vallseca (1439), the Genoese map (1457), the Fra Mauro map (1459) and the maps of Henricus Martellus Germanus (1484, 1489) and Pedro Reinel (c. 1485). With a few exceptions (e.g. Ruysch), Antillia disappears from almost all known maps composed after Christopher Columbus&#x27;s voyages to the Americas in the 1490s (e.g. it is absent on the 1500 map of Juan de la Cosa, the Cantino planisphere of 1502, etc.)

It appears in virtually all of the known surviving Portolan charts of the Atlantic – notably those of the Genoese B. Beccario or Beccaria (1435), the Venetian Andrea Bianco (1436), and Grazioso Benincasa (1476 and 1482). It is usually accompanied by the smaller and equally legendary islands of Royllo, St Atanagio, and Tanmar, the whole group often classified as &quot;insulae de novo repertae&quot;, newly discovered islands.
On these maps, Antillia was typically depicted on a similar scale to that of Portugal, lying around 200 miles west of the Azores. It was drawn as an almost perfect rectangle, its long axis running north–south, but with seven trefoil bays shared between the east and west coasts. Each city lay on a bay. The form of the island occasionally becomes more figurative than the semi-abstract representations of Bartolomeo de Pareto, Benincasa and others: Bianco, for instance, shifts its orientation to northwest–southeast, transmutes generic bays into river mouths (including a large one on the northeastern coast), and elongates a southern tail into a cape with a small cluster of islets offshore.

Around the time of Spain&#x27;s discovery of South America, Antillia dwindles substantially in size on Behaim&#x27;s globe and later charts. Contrary to the earlier descriptions of the two island groups as distinct entities, a 16th-century notion relegates Antillia to the island of São Miguel, the largest of the Azores, where a national park centering on two lakes still bears the name Sete Cidades National Park.

==Medieval beliefs and the Age of Discovery==
A Portuguese legend tells how the island was settled in the early 8th century in the face of the Moorish conquest of Iberia by the Archbishop of Porto, six other bishops and their parishioners to avoid the ensuing Moorish invasion. Each congregation founded a city, namely, Aira, Anhuib, Ansalli, Ansesseli, Ansodi, Ansolli and Con, and once established, burnt their caravel ships as a symbol of their autonomy. The reporting of this settlement comes courtesy of a young couple who eloped back to Europe on a rare trading ship and reported the seven cities as a model of agricultural, economic and cultural harmony. Centuries later, the island became known as a proto-utopian commonwealth, free from the disorders of less favoured states.

Since these events predated the Kingdom of Portugal and the clergy&#x27;s heritage marked a claim to significant strategical gains, Spain counterclaimed that the expedition was, in fact, theirs. One of the chief early descriptions of the heritage of Antillia is inscribed on the globe which the geographer Martin Behaim made at Nuremberg in 1492. Behaim relates the Catholic escape from the barbarians, though his date of 734 is probably a mistake for 714. The inscription adds that a Spanish vessel sighted the island in 1414, while a Portuguese crew claimed to have landed on Antillia in the 1430s.

In a later version of the legend, the bishops fled from Mérida, Spain, when Moors attacked it around the year 1150.

With this legend underpinning the growing reports of a bountiful civilisation midway between Europe and Cipangu, or Japan, the quest to discover the Seven Cities attracted significant attention. However, by the last decade of the 15th century, the Portuguese state&#x27;s official sponsorship of such exploratory voyages had ended, and in 1492, under the Spanish flag of Ferdinand and Isabella, Christopher Columbus set out on his historic journey to Asia, citing the island as the perfect halfway house by the authority of Paul Toscanelli. Columbus had supposedly gained charts and descriptions from a Spanish navigator, who had &quot;sojourned ... and died also&quot; at Columbus&#x27;s home in Madeira, after having made landfall on Antillia.

Following John Cabot&#x27;s first 1497 voyage to Newfoundland, several people believed he had discovered Antillia. Upon Cabot&#x27;s return to England, two residents of Bristol – the Italian merchant Raimondo de Soncino (in a letter to the Duke of Milan, dated August 24, 1497) and Bristol merchant John Day (in a letter to Christopher Columbus, written c. December 1497) – refer to Cabot making landfall and coasting the &quot;Island of Seven Cities&quot;.

==Later influence==
Others following d&#x27;Anghiera suggested contenders in the West Indies for Antillia&#x27;s heritage (most often either Puerto Rico or Trinidad), and as a result the Caribbean islands became known as the Antilles. As European explorations continued in the Americas, maps reduced the scale of the island Antillia, tending to place it mid-Atlantic, whereas the Seven Cities of Gold were attributed to mainland Central or North America, as the various European powers vied for territory in the New World.

<text>Guomao () is an area in Beijing at the center of the Beijing central business district, demarcated by the intersection of Jianguomen Outer Street and the Third Ring Road. The Chinese World Trade Center is located there. It was formerly known as Dabeiyao (), and bus stops in the vicinity still bear this name.

Guomao is also the name of the interchange station on Line 1 and Line 10.

==History==
During the Ming Dynasty, the area was pastureland outside the city walls, and served as a hunting ground for the imperial family. During World War II, the occupying Japanese Army built a complex of kilns in the area, the largest of which in the north became a landmark. The area was then called Dabeiyao (), literally the &quot;Great Northern Kiln&quot;.

In 1985, the China World Trade Center was built at the intersection of the 3rd Ring Road and Jianguomen Outer Street and the Beijing CBD was established in 1993. The Dabeiyao Overpass was consequently renamed the Guomao Bridge - &quot;Guomao&quot; is the abbreviation for the Chinese name of the China World Trade Center (). Guomao subway station was opened on September 28, 1999.

<text>The Metrication Board was a non-departmental public body that existed in the United Kingdom to promote and co-ordinate metrication within the country. It was set up in 1969, four years after the metrication programme was announced, and wound down in 1981.

==Prelude to metrication==
The question of whether or not to convert British trade and industry to metric was the subject of a UK Government White Paper in 1951, itself the result of the Hodgson Committee Report of 1949 which unanimously recommended compulsory metrication and currency decimalisation within ten years. The report said &quot;The real problem facing Great Britain is not whether to adhere either to the Imperial or to the metric system, but to maintain two legal systems or to abolish the Imperial.&quot; The report also recommended that any change should be done in concert with the Commonwealth (former Empire) and the US, that the UK adopt a decimal currency and that the UK and US harmonise their respective definitions of the yard using the metre as a reference.

Although most of the Hodgson Report was rejected at the time as being premature, within a decade and a half changing patterns in British trade meant that in 1963 a poll by the British Standards Institute (BSI) revealed that the majority of its members favoured a transition to the metric system.

Two years later, after taking a poll of its members, the Confederation of British Industry informed the government that they favoured the adoption of the metric system, though some sectors emphasised the need for a voluntary system of adoption. The metrication programme in the United Kingdom was to have five phases: announcement of policy; metrication of the documentation for materials, specification and engineering design; metrication of engineering-related industries; initiation of a national education programme in the schools and metrication of the wholesale, retail and consumer industries.

==Establishment of the Board==
In March 1966 the [Parliamentary] Standing Joint Committee on Metrication was appointed and on 26 July 1968, when accepting the committee&#x27;s report, the government announced that:
:*The target date for the completion of the metrication programme was 1975.
:*An advisory Metrication Board would be set up.
:*Legislation would be passed where necessary.
:*There would be no compensation – costs would be borne where they fell.

The Metrication Board was set up with a mandate to &quot;consult, advise, inform, stimulate and coordinate&quot;. Its mandate specifically excluded a campaigning role. The board held its first meeting in May 1969 under the chairmanship of Lord Ritchie-Calder when eight committees were set up to deal with the most important sectors of British Industry:
:*Agriculture, Forestry, Fisheries and Land
:*Distribution, Food and Consumer Goods Industries
:*Education and Industrial Training
:*Engineering Industries
:*Fuel and Power Industries
:*Industrial Materials and Construction Industries
:*Transport and Communications Industries
:*Information Policy

By the time the board was set up, much of the groundwork, especially rewriting of many British Standards using metric units had been done and many of the industries that stood to benefit from metrication had already metricated, or had a metrication programme in progress.

Traditionally the British Government had imposed little regulation on British industry – standards were usually defined by the industry itself, often in conjunction with the British Standards Institution. Legislation relating to units of measure were normally directed at trade with industry being allowed to develop its own standards.

After the general election and change of government in 1970, the incoming government announced its intention to continue to &quot;encourage these voluntary developments, including the use of metric specifications for public purposes as soon as consultation with the suppliers shows this to be practicable&quot;.

==White paper==
In 1972, three years before the target date for completion of the metrication programme, the Metrication Board published a white paper laying out the political and economic rationale behind the adoption of the metric system, identifying the practicalities and potential difficulties of the changeover and outlining the programme. The report emphasised that unlike currency decimalisation, the [remainder of] the programme would be on a phased basis with no M-Day. The report also emphasised the need for co-ordination between the various sectors as all were interdependent and thus that partial metrication was undesirable.

==Activities of the Board==
Completion of metrication as cited in the Final report of the Metrication Board was:
*1970 – Electric Cables, British Aerospace designs, London Metal Exchange, Flat glass.
*1971 – Paper and Board, National Coal Board designs, Pharmaceuticals.
*1972 – Steel industry, Building regulations
*1974 – Textile and wool transactions, clothing (dual units)
*1975 – Retail trade in fabrics and floor coverings, Post office tariffs, medical practice
*1976 – Bulk sales of petroleum, agriculture and horticulture
*1977 – Livestock auctions
*1978 – Solid fuel, cheese wholesaling, London Commodity Market
*Metrication of retail pre-packaged foodstuffs was phased in during 1977 and 1978

==Winding up of the Board==
Following the 1979 general election and another change of government, Sally Oppenheim, described by the last director of the Metrication Board, Jim Humble, as having &quot;been almost the lone but persistent critic of the metric programme&quot; was appointed Minister of State for Consumer Affairs. On 14 November 1979, six months after her appointment, she announced that no more statutory orders would be made regarding metrication – continued progress would be on a voluntary basis. The following year the Metrication Board was wound up, one of the 457 Quangos that were wound up in the &quot;Quango bonfire&quot; of 1979–81.

The author of the final report of the Metrication Board wrote &quot;Today metric units are used in many important areas of British life – including education; agriculture; construction; industrial materials; much of manufacturing; the wholesaling of petrol, milk, cheese and textiles; fatstock markets and many port fish auctions, nearly all the principal prepacked foods; posts and telecommunications: most freight and customs tariffs; all new and revised Ordnance Survey maps; and athletics. Nevertheless, taken as a whole, Britain is far from being wholly metric.&quot; The report identified major areas that had not yet been metricated as being the retail petrol trade (metricated early 1980s), retail sale of loose goods (metricated in 2000) and road signs (as of 2020, only weights are metricated, but not distance).

==Comparable institutions==
Similar bodies were instituted in other jurisdictions around the world:

* Australia – Metric Conversion Board (1970) 
* Canada – the Metric Commission
*Hong Kong – the Metrication Committee
* New Zealand – Metric Advisory Board (1970)
* South Africa – Metrication Advisory Board (1967)
* United States of America – the United States Metric Board

<text>The Hawaii Theatre is a theatre in downtown Honolulu, Hawaii, United States. Built in 1922, it is located at 1130 Bethel Street, between Hotel and Pauahi Streets, on the edge of Chinatown. It is listed on the State and National Register of Historic Places.

== History ==

When Consolidated Amusement Company opened the Hawaii Theatre on September 6, 1922, local newspapers called it &quot;The Pride of the Pacific&quot; and considered it the equal in opulence to any theatre in San Francisco or beyond. When it opened, it was Consolidated Amusement&#x27;s flagship theatre and the largest (1,760 seats) and most ornate in Hawaii. The company&#x27;s offices were also in the building.

Honolulu architects Walter Emory and Marshall Webb employed elements of Neoclassical architecture for the exterior—with Byzantine, Corinthian, and Moorish ornamentation—and a rich panoply of Beaux-Arts architecture inside—Corinthian columns, a gilded dome, marble statuary, an art gallery, plush carpets, silk hangings, and a Lionel Walden mural above the proscenium. The interior was wide and shallow, with a single balcony and two rows of loge boxes. On the main floor, two private boxes flanked the stage.

The exterior originally had a simple canopy with a small reader board listing the attractions, and a vertical sign lit by electric bulbs. In 1938, a large, new marquee was installed with the largest neon display in the islands.

The Hawaii Theatre presented both Vaudeville entertainment and silent films through the 1920s. It had its own full orchestra for live shows and a large Robert-Morton pipe organ used to accompany silent films. Following the introduction of sound films, it operated as a downtown movie theatre through the 1960s.

== Decline and Revival ==

With the shift in entertainment and retail venues away from downtown beginning in the 1960s, theatre attendance gradually declined into the 1970s and early 1980s. Consolidated Amusement decided not to renew its lease and the Hawaii Theatre closed in 1984. Concerned about the Hawaii&#x27;s potential demolition, several members of the theatre&#x27;s pipe organ volunteer group formed the non-profit 501(c)(3) Hawaii Theatre Center and, joined by others, united to save and restore it, eventually undertaking major fund-raising efforts. In 1986, the organization was able to purchase the theatre and, subsequently, several adjacent buildings. An extensive renovation of the interior followed in 1994, coordinated by the architectural firm of Hardy Holzman Pfeiffer of New York City. The theatre reopened in 1996, while exterior renovations continued through 2005. The large marquee from 1938, which had deteriorated and been removed, was replicated and installed, and featured new electronic display panels.

== Current Operation and Accolades ==

The Hawaii Theatre is once again a popular venue for stage shows and concerts, and continues today as a successful performing arts center. 
In 2005, the League of Historic America Theatres named it the &quot;Outstanding Historic Theatre in America&quot;; in 2006, the National Trust for Historic Preservation gave the Hawaii Theatre its highest &quot;Honor Award&quot; for national preservation; and in 2006, the Hawaii Better Business Bureau presented its &quot;Torch Award for Business Ethics&quot; to the Hawaii Theatre Center, the first small nonprofit to receive that award.

The Hawaii Theatre is the last surviving, operating historic theatre in Honolulu. Guided tours of the theatre are regularly offered.

<text>Bernard Richard Meirion Darwin CBE JP (7 September 1876 − 18 October 1961) a grandson of the British naturalist Charles Darwin, was a golf writer and high-standard amateur golfer. He was inducted into the World Golf Hall of Fame.

==Biography==
Born in Downe, Kent, Darwin was the son of Francis Darwin and Amy Ruck, his mother dying from a fever on 11 September, four days after his birth. He was the first grandson of Charles and Emma Darwin (see Darwin–Wedgwood family), and was brought up by them at their home, Down House. His younger half-sister from his father&#x27;s second marriage to Ellen Wordswotth Crofts was the poet Frances Cornford.

Darwin was educated at Eton College, and graduated in law from Trinity College, Cambridge, where he was a Cambridge Blue in golf 1895–1897, and team captain in his final year.

Darwin married the engraver Elinor Monsell in 1906. They had one son, Sir Robert Vere Darwin, and two daughters; the potter Ursula Mommens, and Nicola Mary Elizabeth Darwin, later Hughes (1916–1976). During the First World War he served with the Royal Army Ordnance Corps in Macedonia as a lieutenant.

After Cambridge, Darwin became a court lawyer, but did not particularly enjoy that career, and gradually moved into journalism, despite having no formal training. He covered golf for &quot;The Times&quot; from 1907 to 1953 and for &quot;Country Life&quot; from 1907 to 1961, the first writer ever to cover golf on a daily basis, instead of as an occasional feature.

He played the game at an excellent level himself well into middle age, and competed in The Amateur Championship on 26 occasions across five decades between 1898 and 1935, with his best results being semi-final appearances in 1909 and 1921. In 1922, while in the United States to report on the first Walker Cup amateur team match between Britain and Ireland and the U.S., and also appointed as non-playing captain, Darwin was pressed into service at the last minute as a player, when one of the British team members, Robert Harris, was unable to play. He lost his team match, but won his singles match.

He was Captain of The Royal and Ancient Golf Club of St Andrews in 1934, and was President of the Golf Club Managers&#x27; Association (then the Association of Golf Club Secretaries) from 1933 to 1934 and then again from 1955 to 1958. Though mainly a golf writer, he also occasionally wrote on cricket, and prefaced the first edition of The Oxford Dictionary of Quotations. He was awarded CBE in the 1937 Coronation Honours.

Bernard Darwin was an authority on Charles Dickens. He frequently contributed the fourth leading article in &quot;The Times&quot;. The fourth Leader was devoted to flippant themes, and Darwin was known to insert quotes from or about Dickens in them. When Oxford Press issued all classics by Dickens around 1940, each with a foreword by a Dickensian scholar, Darwin was chosen to contribute the foreword to &quot;The Pickwick Papers&quot;. He was also asked by &quot;The Times&quot; to pen the main tribute to cricketer W.G. Grace when Grace&#x27;s birth centenary was celebrated in 1948. The article has been included since in a few anthologies.

Bernard Darwin&#x27;s works were kept in print by Herbert Warren Wind through his curated Classics of Golf Library.

In 1947, Bernard Darwin wrote &#x27;A Century of Medical Service&#x27; about the work of the GWR Medical Fund Society. The society was founded in 1847 and was being disbanded in 1947, with the arrival of the NHS. The society provided a complete medical service for the workers and their families in the Swindon rail works.

In 2005, Darwin was elected to the World Golf Hall of Fame, in the Lifetime Achievement category.

He is buried in St Mary the Virgin Churchyard, Downe, Kent.

<text>Chuuk Lagoon, previously Truk Atoll, is an atoll in the central Pacific Ocean. It lies about 1,800 kilometres (970 nautical miles) northeast of New Guinea and is part of Chuuk State within the Federated States of Micronesia (FSM). A protective reef, 225 kilometres (140 mi) around, encloses a natural harbour 79 by 50 km (43 nmi × 27 nmi), with an area of 2,130 km2 (820 sq mi). It has a land area of 93.07 square kilometres (35.93 square miles), with a population of 36,158 people and a maximal elevation of 443 metres (1,453 ft). Weno city on Weno (formerly Moen) Island functions as both the atoll&#x27;s capital and the state capital, and is the largest city in the FSM with its 13,700 people.

Chuuk Lagoon was the Empire of Japan&#x27;s main naval base in the South Pacific theatre during World War II. It was the site of a major U.S. attack during Operation Hailstone in February 1944, and Operation Inmate, a small assault conducted by British and Canadian forces during June 1945.

==Name==
Chuuk means &quot;mountain&quot; in the Chuukese language. The lagoon was known mainly as Truk (a mispronunciation of Ruk), until 1990. Other names included &quot;Hogoleu&quot;, &quot;Torres&quot;, Ugulat, and &quot;Lugulus&quot;. 

==Geography==
Chuuk Lagoon is part of the larger Caroline Islands group. The area consists of eleven major islands (corresponding to the eleven municipalities of Truk lagoon, which are Tol, Udot, Fala-Beguets, Romanum, and Eot of Faichuk group, and Weno, Fefen, Dublon, Uman, Param, and Tsis of Nomoneas group) and 46 smaller ones within the lagoon, plus 41 on the fringing coral reef, and is known today as the Chuuk islands, part of the Federated States of Micronesia in the Pacific Ocean.

=== Main islands ===
This is a list of islands, villages and population following the 2010 census:

==History==

===Prehistory===

It is not known when the islands of Chuuk were first settled, but archaeological evidence indicates that islands of Feefen and Wééné had human settlements in the first and second century BC. Later evidence indicates that widespread human settlements appeared in Chuuk during the 14th century AD.

===Colonialism===

The first recorded sighting by Europeans was made by Spanish navigator Álvaro de Saavedra on board the ship &quot;Florida&quot; during August or September 1528. They were later visited by Spaniard Alonso de Arellano on 15 January 1565 on board of galleon patache &quot;San Lucas&quot;.

As part of the Caroline Islands, Truk was claimed by the Spanish Empire, which made an effort to control the islands in the late 19th century. Chuuk Lagoon was inhabited by several tribes that engaged in intermittent warfare, as well as a small population of foreign traders and missionaries. Spanish control over the islands was nominal. The Spaniards stopped to raise a flag over Chuuk in 1886 and returned in 1895 as part of an attempt to assert control and negotiate peace between warring Chuukese tribes. No permanent Spanish settlement was established, and tribal violence continued until the German colonial era. The Caroline Islands were sold to the German Empire in 1899, after Spain withdrew from the Pacific in the aftermath of the Spanish–American War.

During the First World War, the Japanese Navy was tasked with pursuing and destroying the German East Asia Squadron and protection of the shipping lanes for Allied commerce in the Pacific and Indian Oceans. During the course of this operation, the Japanese Navy seized the German possessions in the Marianas, Carolines, Marshall Islands and Palau groups by October 1914. Chuuk then became a possession of the Empire of Japan under the South Seas Mandate following Germany&#x27;s defeat.

===World War II===
Naval Base Truk in the Truk Lagoon was the Empire of Japan&#x27;s main base in the South Pacific theatre of World War II. There was a myth that Truk was heavily fortified, and it was given nicknames like &quot;the Gibraltar of the Pacific,&quot; or Japan&#x27;s equivalent of the Americans&#x27; Pearl Harbor. In fact,
Nevertheless, Truk was the main base for Japanese operations against Allied forces in New Guinea and the Solomon Islands, serving as the forward anchorage for the Imperial Japanese Navy (IJN), and Truk Lagoon was considered the most formidable of all Japanese strongholds in the Pacific. On the various islands, the Japanese Civil Engineering Department and Naval Construction Department had built roads, trenches, bunkers and caves. Five airstrips, seaplane bases, a torpedo boat station, submarine repair shops, a communications center and a radar station were constructed during the war. Protecting these various facilities were coastal defense guns and mortar emplacements.

A significant portion of the Japanese fleet was based at Truk, with its administrative center on Tonoas (south of Weno). At anchor in the lagoon were battleships, aircraft carriers, cruisers, destroyers, tankers, cargo ships, tugboats, gunboats, minesweepers, landing craft, and submarines. In particular, &quot;Yamato&quot; and &quot;Musashi&quot; were stationed at Truk for months around 1943, unable to participate in battle. The Japanese garrison consisted of 27,856 IJN men, under the command of Vice Admiral Masami Kobayashi, then Vice Admiral Chuichi Hara, and 16,737 Imperial Japanese Army men, under the command of Major General Kanenobu Ishuin.

At one point, dropping a nuclear weapon on Truk was discussed by the United States government.

In 1944, Truk&#x27;s capacity as a naval base was destroyed through naval air attack in Operation Hailstone. Forewarned by intelligence a week before the U.S. raid, the Japanese had withdrawn their larger warships (heavy cruisers and aircraft carriers) to Palau. Once the American forces captured the Marshall Islands, they used them as a base from which to launch an early morning attack on 17 February 1944 against Truk Lagoon. Operation Hailstone lasted for three days, as American carrier-based planes sank 12 smaller Japanese warships (light cruisers, destroyers, and auxiliaries) and 32 merchant ships, while destroying 275 aircraft, mainly on the ground. The consequences of the attack made &quot;Truk lagoon the biggest graveyard of ships in the world&quot;.

The attacks for the most part ended Truk as a major threat to Allied operations in the central Pacific. The Japanese garrison on Eniwetok was denied any realistic hope of reinforcement and support during the invasion that began on 18 February, greatly assisting U.S. forces in their conquest of that island. Truk was isolated by Allied forces, as they continued their advance towards Japan by invading other Pacific islands, such as Guam, Saipan, Palau, and Iwo Jima. Truk was attacked again from 12 to 16 June 1945 by part of the British Pacific Fleet during Operation Inmate. Cut off, the Japanese forces on Truk and other central Pacific islands ran low on food and faced starvation before Japan surrendered in August 1945.

===Post-war===
On 28 September 2018, a Boeing 737-800 operated as Air Niugini Flight 73 landed short of the runway at Chuuk International Airport before landing and sinking into the lagoon. One passenger out of the 47 passengers and crew perished in the crash.

==Economy and infrastructure==

Most of the roads and transportation systems are poor or in disrepair; an extensive infrastructural redevelopment plan began, consisting of a five-phase project to completely reconstruct the existing sewer, water and storm drainage systems as well as pour concrete roadways in the majority of the villages of Weno.

Chuuk International Airport (IATA airport code TKK) is on the administrative island of Moen. It is served by United Airlines.

The government operates a radio station. Interisland communication is often accomplished using citizens&#x27; band radio. Telephone services are limited on Chuuk, though a cellular network is established within some islands of the lagoon and in the near future on the outer islands. High speed Internet access via ADSL has been made available on a monthly subscription basis on the Island of Weno from May 2010.

Tourism, especially scuba diving among the many wrecks of Truk Lagoon, is the island&#x27;s main industry. Copra (dried coconut meat) is the only cash crop, and output is relatively insignificant. Most of the inhabitants of outlying islands engage in subsistence activity only.

===Recreational diving===

In 1969, William A. Brown and French oceanographer Jacques Cousteau and his team explored Truk Lagoon. Following Cousteau&#x27;s 1971 television documentary about the lagoon and its ghostly remains, the atoll became a scuba diving lure, drawing wreck diving enthusiasts from around the world to see its numerous, virtually intact sunken ships. The shipwrecks and remains are sometimes referred to as the &quot;Ghost Fleet of Truk Lagoon&quot;. Scattered mainly around the Dublon (Tonowas), Eten, Fefan and Uman islands within the Truk group, several shipwrecks lie in crystal clear waters less than below the surface. In waters devoid of normal ocean currents, divers can easily swim across decks littered with gas masks and depth charges, and below decks can be found evidence of human remains. In the massive ships&#x27; holds are the remnants of fighter aircraft, tanks, bulldozers, railroad cars, motorcycles, torpedoes, mines, bombs, boxes of munitions, radios, plus thousands of other weapons, spare parts, and other artifacts. Of special interest is the wreck of the submarine &quot;I-169 Shinohara&quot; which was lost when diving to avoid the bombing. The submarine had participated in the attack on Pearl Harbor in December 1941.

The coral encrusted wrecks attract a diverse array of marine life, including manta rays, turtles, sharks and corals. In 2007, 266 species of reef fish were recorded by an Earthwatch team, and in 2006 the rare coral &quot;Acropora pichoni&quot; was identified.

On 12 April 2011, the Australian Broadcasting Corporation program &quot;Foreign Correspondent&quot; screened a report on Chuuk Lagoon likening the effect of the impending massive release of tens of thousands of tonnes of oil from the rusting Japanese warships into the coral reef to that of the Exxon Valdez spill in Alaska. However, given the poor state of the Japanese war effort in 1944, many of the ships may have had relatively small amounts of fuel in their bunkers. Environmental protection organizations are surveying the wrecks while also consulting with Japanese researchers to try to determine how much oil is likely to be in the hulls, particularly in three sunken oil tankers. The ships are classified as a Japanese war grave, requiring Japanese government involvement in the eventual clean-up.

<text>The Hobby–Eberly Telescope (HET) is a 10-meter (30-foot) aperture telescope located at the McDonald Observatory in Davis Mountains, Texas.

The Hobby–Eberly Telescope is one of the largest optical telescopes in the world. It combines a number of features that differentiate it from most telescope designs, resulting in lowered construction costs:

* The telescope&#x27;s main mirror is fixed at a 55° angle and can only rotate around its base. A target is tracked by moving the instruments at the focus of the telescope; this provides access to about 70–81% of the sky at its location and allows a single target to be tracked for up to two hours.

* The primary mirror is constructed from 91 hexagonal segments, which is less expensive than manufacturing a single large primary.

The telescope is named for former Texas Lieutenant-Governor Bill Hobby and for Robert E. Eberly, a Penn State benefactor.

Three instruments are available to analyze the light from the targets. All three instruments are spectrographs. The instruments work at high, medium and low spectral resolution. The low-resolution spectrograph is housed at the prime focus, while the medium and high-resolution spectrographs reside in the basement and the light is fed into them via a fiber-optic cable.

Since achieving first light in 1996, the telescope has been used for a wide variety of studies ranging from the Solar System to stars in our galaxy and studies of other galaxies. The telescope has been used successfully to find planets orbiting around other stars by measuring radial velocities as precisely as 1 m/s. Using the low-resolution spectrograph, the telescope has been used to identify Type Ia supernovae to measure the acceleration of the universe. The telescope has also been used to measure the rotation of individual galaxies. The telescope was upgraded for use in the Hobby–Eberly Telescope Dark Energy Experiment (HETDEX), which will provide the first observations to allow narrowing of the list of possible explanations for dark energy. Along with the new Visible Integral-Field Replicable Unit Spectrograph (VIRUS) to enable observations for the HETDEX project with 192 spectrographs.

The Hobby–Eberly Telescope is operated by The University of Texas McDonald Observatory for a consortium of institutions which includes The University of Texas at Austin, Pennsylvania State University, Ludwig Maximilian University of Munich, and Georg August University of Göttingen.

The physical main reflector mirror is larger than 10 meters; it is actually about 11 m by 9.8 m. Upon first light, the usable optical aperture at any given time was 9.2 m. After a multi-year upgrade completed on July 29, 2015, the usable optical aperture was increased to 10m. The mirror itself is composed of 91 hexagonal segments, a segmented mirror design like the Keck telescopes. Updates to the telescope have increased its field of view from 4 arcminutes to 22 arcminutes (a full moon is 30 arcminutes for comparison). The telescope mirrors are aligned within a fraction of a wavelength of visible light by actuators under each segment. The tower next to the telescope, called the Center of Curvature Alignment Sensor Tower (CCAS), is used to calibrate the mirror segments. One of the advantages of this telescope design is that it was over 5 times more cost efficient for its aperture size than a more traditional design.

As reported in &quot;Nature&quot; of 28 November 2012, astronomers have used the Hobby–Eberly Telescope to measure the mass of an extraordinarily large black hole (with mass approximates 17 billion Suns), possibly the largest black hole found so far. It has been found in the compact, lenticular galaxy NGC 1277, which lies 220 million light-years away in the constellation Perseus. The black hole has approximately 59 percent of the mass of the bulge of this spiral galaxy (14 percent of the total stellar mass of the galaxy).

The Habitable Zone Planet Finder is a spectrograph for the Hobby–Eberly Telescope capable of detecting earth like planets.

The design of the Hobby–Eberly was used as the basis for the Southern African Large Telescope.

<text>Calculating Space () is Konrad Zuse&#x27;s 1969 book on automata theory. He proposed that all processes in the universe are computational. This view is known today as the simulation hypothesis, digital philosophy, digital physics or pancomputationalism. Zuse proposed that the universe is being computed by some sort of cellular automaton or other discrete computing machinery, challenging the long-held view that some physical laws are continuous by nature. He focused on cellular automata as a possible substrate of the computation, and pointed out that the classical notions of entropy and its growth do not make sense in deterministically computed universes.

<doc id="842786" wikidata="Q785317" url="?curid=842786" title="USS Heermann">
<text>USS &quot;Heermann&quot; (DD-532) was a World War II-era in the service of the United States Navy. The ship entered service in 1943 and took part in several battles during World War II in the Pacific theatre of operations, including the Philippines campaign, Battle off Samar and the Battle of Iwo Jima among others. &quot;Heermann&quot; gained fame during the &quot;last stand of the Tin Can Sailors&quot; in which she and several other destroyers of Task Unit 77.4.3 (&quot;Taffy 3&quot;) engaged a far superior Japanese task force during the Battle off Samar in October 1944. &quot;Heermann&quot; was the only American destroyer of &quot;Taffy 3&quot; to survive the engagement. Following the end of the war in 1945, the ship was placed in reserve from 1946 to 1951, when the destroyer was reactivated. &quot;Heermann&quot; remained in active service until 1957, when the ship was returned to the reserve. In 1961, &quot;Heerman&quot; was loaned to Argentina and was renamed ARA &quot;Almirante Brown&quot; (D-20) while in service with the Argentinian Navy. &quot;Almirante Brown&quot; remained in Argentinian service until 1982, when the ship was decommissioned.

==Namesake==
Lewis Heermann was born on 3 August 1779 in Kassel, Germany. He was commissioned as a Surgeon&#x27;s Mate in the United States Navy on 8 February 1802. On 16 February 1804, during the First Barbary War, Lieutenant Stephen Decatur left Heermann in command of the bomb ketch while he led a group of American seamen to board the captured frigate in Tripoli Harbor and set the frigate ablaze.

When hostilities with the Barbary States closed in 1805, Heermann returned to the United States but soon took leave of absence to study in Europe until 1808 when he returned to active duty in Norfolk, Virginia. Largely due to his pleas for better medical care for the men of the Navy, Congress passed a bill authorizing the construction of hospitals at several naval stations, but the first official U.S. Naval Hospitals were not actually built until after Dr. Heermann&#x27;s death.

He was transferred to New Orleans, Louisiana in August 1811; and, with the exception of a year in the North for his health and an assignment in 1830 in the Mediterranean where he served for an unknown time as Fleet Surgeon of the Mediterranean Squadron, he remained there until he died in May 1833.

==Description and design==
The &quot;Fletcher&quot;-class design departed from US destroyer design, having a larger displacement than previous classes and more extensive armament. The flush deck added to the strength, but the number of systems aboard the ship led to a cramped design. &quot;Heermann&quot; was among the &quot;Fletcher&quot;-class ships that got a new bridge design. The standard &quot;Fletcher&quot;-class ship had a standard displacement of and was at full load. The destroyers were long overall and long at the waterline with a beam of and a draft of at full load.

The &quot;Fletcher&quot; class were powered by steam from four Babcock &amp; Wilcox boilers driving two General Electric turbines turning two shafts rated at . The destroyers carried of fuel oil. The ships had a maximum speed of and a range of at . The ships had a complement of 273 officers and enlisted personnel.

The class were initially armed with five /38 caliber guns in Mk30 dual-purpose turrets for anti-aircraft and surface warfare, aligned along the centreline. Ten torpedo tubes were also equipped. Four single-mounted guns and four 20 mm cannon were equipped for anti-aircraft (AA) defense. For anti-submarine defense, six depth charge throwers and two depth charge racks were installed. Later, three twin-mounted 40 mm guns and the number of 20 mm cannon increased to eleven on &quot;Heermann&quot;. This would later change again to five twin 40 mm gun mounts and seven 20 mm cannon. The destroyers also had some armor, with side armor and armor on the decks over the machinery.

==Service history==
&quot;Heermann&quot; was launched on 5 December 1942 by the Bethlehem Shipbuilding Co. of San Francisco, California and sponsored by Mrs. Edward B. Briggs, wife of Lieutenant E. B. Briggs, USCGR, great-grandson of the namesake. The destroyer was commissioned on 6 July 1943.

After shakedown training out of San Diego, California, &quot;Heermann&quot; joined the 5th Fleet on 21 October 1943 for Operation Galvanic, the assault on the Gilbert Islands. She arrived off Tarawa in Rear Admiral Harry W. Hill&#x27;s Southern Attack Force on 20 November. Her guns sank a small enemy craft inside the lagoon and the next two days assisted troops ashore with close-in fire support. With the island secured, she returned to Pearl Harbor for repairs and training which ended on 23 January when she sailed in the screen of an attack transport reserve force. After the American assault on Kwajalein on 31 January &quot;Heermann&quot; spent two weeks patrolling off the island and operated in the screen of escort carriers which were launching strikes in support of troops ashore, followed up by a visit to Eniwetok Atoll and then bombardment duties of Japan and Parry Island. Following the invasion, the destroyer performed fire support and patrol operations off the atoll during mop-up operations.

&quot;Heermann&quot; was then assigned to the Third Fleet and Task Force 39 on 18 March 1944 after stopping at Majuro Lagoon and then Port Purvis on Florida Island, in the Solomons. For the next month the destroyer escorted convoys which were occupying Emirau Island and seeking out enemy supply barges along the coast of New Hanover. Following a stop at Purvis on 3 June, &quot;Heermann&quot; took part in the bombardment of a tank farm on Fangelawa Bay, New Ireland on 11 June, and then performed ASW patrols from the Solomons towards the Admiralty, Caroline, and Marshall islands until 26 June. In mid-1944, &quot;Heermann&quot; escorted merchant shipping from Espiritu Santo, New Hebrides and Nouméa, New Caledonia. The destroyer returned to Port Purvis and departed on 6 September 1944 with Rear Admiral William Sample&#x27;s escort carrier force, providing escort during the invasion of the Palau Islands. Following this, the destroyer was detached for operations in the Philippine Islands.

===Battle off Samar: October 1944===
&quot;Heermann&quot; screened transports and landing ships to the beaches of Leyte under the command of recently promoted Commander Amos T. Hathaway, then joined Rear Admiral Thomas L. Sprague&#x27;s Escort Carrier Group (Task Group 77.4) which was made up of three escort carrier task units, known as the &quot;Three Taffies&quot; because of their voice calls: &quot;Taffy 1&quot;, &quot;Taffy 2&quot;, and &quot;Taffy 3&quot;. Destroyers and joined her in screening Rear Admiral Clifton Sprague&#x27;s unit, &quot;Taffy 3&quot; which also included his flagship and five other escort carriers.

On 25 October 1944 found the task group east of Samar steaming north as the Northern Air Support Group. At 06:45 lookouts observed anti-aircraft fire to the north and within three minutes, were under heavy fire from Japanese Admiral Takeo Kurita&#x27;s Center Force of four battleships, six heavy cruisers, two light cruisers, and 11 destroyers. In an effort to withdraw away to the south from Kurita&#x27;s force, the escorts began to make smoke screens to mask the movement of the larger ships. &quot;Heermann&quot;, on the opposite side of the carriers from the Japanese force at the opening of the battle, steamed into the action at flank speed through the escort carriers which, after launching their planes, formed a rough circle as they made for Leyte Gulf. Smoke and intermittent rain squalls reduced visibility to less than which led to near collisions, with &quot;Heermann&quot; forced to avoid the destroyer escort and destroyer &quot;Hoel&quot;.

As the escorts began torpedo runs at the Japanese force, &quot;Heermann&quot; began firing her 5-inch guns at one heavy cruiser, , while directing torpedoes at . &quot;Heermann&quot; then changed course to engage a column of four battleships whose shells began falling around the destroyer. &quot;Heermann&quot; targeted , the column&#x27;s leader, at which the destroyer launched three torpedoes. Then &quot;Heermann&quot; switched targets to , and fired three torpedoes, which were launched from only . The destroyer retreated after believing one of the torpedoes had struck a target. Japanese records claim that the battleship successfully evaded all of the torpedoes from &quot;Heermann&quot;, but they were slowed in their pursuit of the American carriers. The battleship was forced out of the action altogether after reversing course when caught between two spreads.

&quot;Heermann&quot; laid another smoke screen along the starboard quarter of the carrier formation and then returned to engage the Japanese force of four heavy cruisers. Here the destroyer dueled with &quot;Chikuma&quot;. A series of hits stuck the forward section of the destroyer, flooding it and pulling the bow down so far that the anchors were dragging in the water. One of the 5-inch guns was put out of action but in conjunction with strikes from the carrier aircraft forced &quot;Chikuma&quot; to withdraw, and the Japanese cruiser sank during her retreat. &quot;Chikuma&quot;″s sister ship took up her sister&#x27;s battle and engaged &quot;Heermann&quot; until the destroyer withdrew to lay more smoke. At this point, support from &quot;Taffy 2&quot; arrived to aid the escorts and aircraft attacked &quot;Tone&quot; forcing the cruiser to withdraw. As more support arrived, the Japanese withdrew. For his skillful maneuvering and leadership &quot;Heermann&quot;″s Commanding Officer, Commander Amos Hathaway, was awarded the Navy Cross.

===Repairs and return to service===

&quot;Heermann&quot; sailed to Kossol Passage for temporary repairs before making for Mare Island and , which was completed on 15 January 1945. The destroyer was then assigned to fast carrier task forces in the western Pacific. During the Battle of Iwo Jima, &quot;Heermann&quot; performed radar and anti-submarine picket duty. On 20 March 1945 the destroyer sank a small surface vessel and rescued seven Japanese crew. Seven days later she took part in the night bombardment of Minami Daito Jima. During the Okinawa campaign she took several enemy planes under fire as she guarded carriers. On 18 April in collaboration with destroyers , , , and and planes from aircraft carrier , &quot;Heermann&quot; sank , a carrier of the &quot;kaiten&quot;s—human-guided torpedoes. She continued to support carrier operations off Okinawa until sailing to Leyte Gulf for replenishment and repairs in late June. On 1 July she helped to screen the fast carrier force that devoted the ensuing five weeks to almost continuous air strikes and bombardment.

On 15 August 1945 &quot;Heermann&quot; was on radar picket station some southeast of Tokyo when, several hours after the announcement of the end of hostilities, a kamikaze emerged from a cloud bank and began to dive in &quot;Heermann&quot;″s direction—only to be splashed by the destroyer&#x27;s gunners in one of the final naval actions of World War II. In the following weeks &quot;Heermann&quot; operated in the screen of the fast carrier task force providing air cover and air-sea rescue service. The destroyer entered Tokyo Bay on 16 September 1945 and remained in the area to support the occupation forces until 7 October when she sailed for the United States. &quot;Heermann&quot; was decommissioned at San Diego on 12 June 1946.

=== 1951–1957 ===
&quot;Heermann&quot; remained in reserve at San Diego until re-commissioning on 12 September 1951. After training in local waters off California, she departed San Diego on 4 January 1952 for her new base, NS Newport, Rhode Island, where she arrived on 23 January. She spent 1952 training along the eastern coast from New England to the Virginia Capes, followed by ASW and fleet problems during winter months in the Caribbean. The destroyer returned to Newport for operations along the Northeastern seaboard. After a voyage to Plymouth, England, in June and July 1953, she participated in antisubmarine maneuvers between Newport and the Virginia Capes. &quot;Heermann&quot; departed on a world cruise 3 December 1953. First she sailed for Yokosuka, Japan, by way of the Panama Canal, San Diego, and the Hawaiian Islands. After a two-day replenishment in Yokosuka, she set course for Okinawa where she acted as part of the escort for 3d Marine Division amphibious warfare landings and conducted barrier patrol in support of the exercise. After more maneuvers took her to Korea, Iwo Jima, and the South Coast of Japan, she returned to Yokosuka which she cleared 22 May 1954 to resume her world cruise, calling at Hong Kong and Singapore on her way to the Suez Canal. In the Mediterranean she visited Port Said, Naples, Villefranche, and Barcelona before returning to Newport 17 July 1954.

For the next year and a half &quot;Heermann&quot; participated in training exercises along the Atlantic coast. On 1 February she sailed to join the 6th Fleet in exercises along the coast of Lebanon, Israel, and Egypt. In April she was invited by Prince Rainier to be in port for his wedding to Miss Grace Kelly from 19 to 24 April 1956. &quot;Heermann&quot; furnished a 40-man honor guard for the occasion. From Monaco she joined the 6th Fleet off Greece, and then departed for Fall River, Massachusetts, where she arrived 28 May 1956. &quot;Heermann&quot; operated out of Newport until 6 November, when she sailed for the Mediterranean where she proved to be a first-rate antisubmarine ship in joint exercises with the Italian Navy.

After revisiting Monaco at the invitation of Prince Rainier and Princess Grace, she returned to Fall River 20 February 1957. She served as gunnery school-ship out of Newport until 30 June when she joined in the screen of antisubmarine warfare carrier for two weeks of air operations for the training of Naval Academy midshipmen. She decommissioned at Boston 20 December 1957 and was assigned to the Boston Group of the U.S. Atlantic Reserve Fleet.

===Argentine service===
On 10 August 1961, the ship was commissioned into the Argentine Navy. On 14 August 1961 &quot;Heermann&quot; was formally transferred on a loan basis to the government of Argentina under terms of the Military Assistance Program. She served in the Argentine Navy under the name &quot;Brown&quot; (D-20). The ship was decommissioned in 1982.

<text>The Coginchaug River in Connecticut, with a watershed including 39 sq mi of forests, pastures, farmland, industrial, and commercial areas, is the main tributary of the Mattabesset River. It is 16.1 mi long, and the river flows northwards from a point approximately 1.8 mi south of the Durham line in Guilford, Connecticut, into Durham and then Middlefield, meeting the Mattabesset in Middletown, about upstream of the Connecticut River. The name &quot;Coginchaug&quot; comes from a local Native American name for the Durham area and it was the original name for the town. It has been said to mean &quot;The Great Swamp.&quot;

In 2006, the Coginchaug was among Connecticut&#x27;s 85 waterways cited to be of &quot;lower quality&quot;, in view of the elevated levels of bacteria, including &quot;E. coli&quot;. Currently, efforts are being made by the Natural Resources Conservation Service of the United States Department of Agriculture to reduce the number of bacteria introduced into the river from untreated sewage, sanitary sewer overflow, agricultural runoff, leaking septic tanks, etc.

==Canoeing==
The river has become a popular canoeing route. In 2006, it was considered safe for canoeing, though it is not safe for in-water activities like swimming. Flowing from Myer Huber Pond, it runs slowly through thick swamps which stretch over and are likely to be impassable except immediately after heavy rains. The main paddling route starts at Route 147 and continues downstream, north, through additional slow-moving waters and a swamp. There are many portages, including those at six dams and at Wadsworth Falls, the only major waterfall. Class II whitewater is possible before it flows into the tidal marsh of the Mattabesset River.

<doc id="842801" wikidata="Q610202" url="?curid=842801" title="Jules Chéret">
<text>Jules Chéret (31 May 1836 – 23 September 1932) was a French painter and lithographer who became a master of &quot;Belle Époque&quot; poster art. He has been called the father of the modern poster.

==Early life and career==

Born in Paris to a poor but creative family of artisans, Chéret had a very limited education. At age thirteen, he began a three-year apprenticeship with a lithographer and then his interest in painting led him to take an art course at the École Nationale de Dessin. Like most other fledgling artists, Chéret studied the techniques of various artists, past and present, by visiting Paris museums.

From 1859 to 1866, he was trained in lithography in London, England, where he was strongly influenced by the British approach to poster design and printing. On returning to France, Chéret created vivid poster ads for the cabarets, music halls, and theaters such as the Eldorado, the Olympia, the Folies Bergère, Théâtre de l&#x27;Opéra, the Alcazar d&#x27;Été, the Café des Ambassadeurs and the Moulin Rouge. He created posters and illustrations for the satirical weekly &quot;Le Courrier français&quot;.

According to the poster collector Ernest Maindron, who wrote the first essay about the illustrated poster in the &quot;Gazette des Beaux-Arts&quot; in 1884, and later published the first book on the subject (&quot;Les Affiches Illustrees&quot;) in 1886, Chéret, along with the brothers Léon and Alfred Choubrac, was among the pioneers of the illustrated poster. In the early 1870s, Chéret and the Choubrac brothers reduced the cost of colour lithography introducing technical advances.

== Growing popularity ==

His works were influenced by the scenes of frivolity depicted in the works of Rococo artists such as Jean-Honoré Fragonard and Antoine Watteau. So much in demand was he, that he expanded his business to providing advertisements for the plays of touring troupes, municipal festivals, and then for beverages and liquors, perfumes, soaps, cosmetics and pharmaceutical products. Eventually he became a major advertising force, adding the railroad companies and a number of manufacturing businesses to his client list.

As his work became more popular and his large posters displaying modestly free-spirited women found a larger audience, pundits began calling him the &quot;father of the women&#x27;s liberation.&quot; Women then had previously been depicted in art as prostitutes or puritans. The women of Chéret&#x27;s posters, joyous, elegant and lively—&#x27;Cherettes&#x27;, as they were popularly called—were neither. It was freeing for the women of Paris, and heralded a noticeably more open atmosphere in Paris where women were able to engage in formerly taboo activities, such as wearing low-cut bodices and smoking in public. These &#x27;Cherettes&#x27; were widely seen and recognised, and a writer of the time said &quot;It is difficult to conceive of Paris without its &#x27;Cheréts&#x27; (sic).&quot;

In 1895, Chéret created the Maîtres de l&#x27;Affiche collection, a significant art publication of smaller sized reproductions featuring the best works of ninety-seven Parisian artists. His success inspired an industry that saw the emergence of a new generation of poster designers and painters such as Charles Gesmar and Henri de Toulouse-Lautrec. One of his students was Georges de Feure.

In his old age Chéret retired to the pleasant climate of the French Riviera at Nice. He died in 1932 at the age of ninety-six and was interred in the Cimetière Saint-Vincent in the Montmartre quarter of Paris.

== Legacy ==
He was awarded the by the French Government in 1890 for his outstanding contributions to the graphic arts. Although his paintings earned him a certain respect, it was his work creating advertising posters, taken on just to pay his bills but eventually his dedication, for which he is remembered today. The award was given to him for creating an art form that meets the needs of Commerce and industry. Edmond de Goncourt recognized Chéret as &quot;the first painter of the Paris wall, the inventor of the art in the poster&quot; when he toasted the artist at the banquet held in his honor.

In 1933 he was honoured with a posthumous exhibition of his work at the prestigious Salon d&#x27;Automne in Paris. Over the years, Chéret&#x27;s posters became much sought after by collectors from around the world.

<doc id="842804" wikidata="Q2726691" url="?curid=842804" title="Greaser (subculture)">
<text>Greasers are a youth subculture that emerged in the 1950s and early 1960s from predominantly working class and lower-class teenagers and young adults in the United States and Canada. The subculture remained prominent into the mid-1960s and was particularly embraced by certain ethnic groups in urban areas, particularly Italian Americans and Hispanic Americans.

== History ==
=== Etymology ===
The etymology for the term &quot;greaser&quot; is unknown. By the time of the Civil War, the words &quot;greaser&quot; and &quot;greaseball&quot; were understood to carry racist and segregationist meanings. It is speculated that the word originated in the late 19th century in the United States as a derogatory label for poor laborers, specifically those of Italian, Greek or Mexican descent. The similar term &quot;greaseball&quot; is a slur for individuals of Italian or Greek descent, though to a lesser extent it has also been used more generally to refer to all Mediterranean, Latino, or Hispanic people.

Academic Jennifer Grayer Moore wrote in her book &quot;Street Style in America&quot; that the term was not used in writing to refer to the American subculture of the mid-20th century until the mid-1960s, though in this sense it still evoked a pejorative ethnic connotation and a relation to machine work. George J. Leonard, who conceived Sha Na Na, coined the term &quot;greaser&quot; in 1967 after he heard Gilbert Highet read the line &quot;The glory that was &quot;Greece&quot;&quot; from Edgar Allan Poe&#x27;s poem &quot;To Helen&quot;. However, S. E. Hinton, author of the novel &quot;The Outsiders&quot;, an influential portrayal of greasers, claimed to know the term from her youth in 1950s Tulsa, Oklahoma. The name was also applied to members of the subculture partly because of their characteristic greased-back hair.

The dominant name for the subculture during the 1950s was hoods, in reference to their upturned collars, with many also calling them J.D.s (abbreviated from juvenile delinquents). Within Greater Baltimore during the 1950s and early 1960s, greasers were colloquially referred to as drapes and drapettes.

=== Origins and rise to popularity ===
The greaser subculture may have emerged in the post–World War II era among the motorcycle clubs and street gangs of the 1940s in the United States, though it was certainly established by the 1950s, when it was increasingly adopted by ethnic urban youth. The original greasers (often coming from &quot;ethnic&quot; backgrounds) were aligned by a feeling of working class and lower class disillusionment with American popular culture either through a lack of economic opportunity in spite of the post-war boom or a marginalization enacted by the general domestic shift towards homogeneity in the 1950s. Most were male, usually ethnic or white working-class outsiders, and were often interested in hotrod culture or motorcycling. A handful of middle-class youth were drawn to the subculture for its rebellious attitude.

The weak structural foundation of the greasers can be attributed to the subculture&#x27;s origins in working-class youth possessing few economic resources with which to participate in American consumerism. Greasers, unlike motorcyclists, did not explicitly have their own interest clubs or publications. As such, there was no business marketing geared specifically towards the group. Their choice in clothing was largely drawn from a common understanding of the empowering aesthetic of working-class attire, rather than a cohesive association with similarly dressed individuals. Many greasers were in motorcycle clubs or in street gangs—and conversely, some gang members and bikers dressed like greasers—though such membership was not necessarily an inherent principle of the subculture.

Ethnically, original greasers were composed mostly of Italian Americans in the Northeast and Mexican American Chicanos in the Southwest. Since both of these groups were mostly olive skinned, the &quot;greaser&quot; label assumed a quasi-racial status that implied an urban, ethnic, lower-class masculinity and delinquency. This development led to an ambiguity in the racial distinction between poor Italian Americans and Puerto Ricans in New York City during the 1950s and 1960s. Greasers were also perceived as being predisposed to perpetrating sexual violence, evoking fear in middle-class males but also titillation in middle-class females.

=== Decline and modern incarnations ===
Though the television show &quot;American Bandstand&quot; helped to &quot;sanitize&quot; the negative image of greasers in the 1960s and 1970s, sexual promiscuity was still seen as a key component of the modern character. By the mid-1970s, the greaser image had become a quintessential part of 1950s nostalgia and cultural revival.

== Culture ==
=== Fashion ===
The most notable physical characteristic of greasers was the greased-back hairstyles they fashioned for themselves through use of hair products such as pomade or petroleum jelly, which necessitated frequent combing and reshaping to maintain. Males sported coiffures adopted from early rock &#x27;n&#x27; roll and rockabilly
performers such as Elvis Presley, among them the Folsom, Pompadour, Elephant&#x27;s trunk, and Duck&#x27;s ass, while females commonly backcombed, coiffed, or teased their hair.

Male greasers typically wore loose work pants such as cotton twill trousers, common among the working class; dark slacks, or dark blue Levi&#x27;s jeans, widely popular among all American youth in the 1950s. The latter were often cuffed over black or brown leather boots, including steel-toed boots, engineer or Harness boots, combat boots, work boots, and (especially in the Southwest) cowboy boots. Other footwear choices included Chuck Taylor All-Stars, pointed Italian dress shoes, brothel creepers, and winklepickers. Male shirts were typically solid black or white T-shirts, ringer T-shirts, Italian knit collared shirts, unbuttoned shirts with sleeveless undershirts underneath, or sometimes just sleeveless undershirts or tank tops (which would have been retailed as underwear). Choices of outerwear included denim or leather jackets (including Perfecto motorcycle jackets). Female greaser dress included leather jackets and risque clothing, such as tight and cropped capri pants and pedal pushers (broadly popular during the time period).

=== Music tastes ===
In the early 1950s, there was significant greaser interest in doo-wop, a genre of African-American music from the industrial cities of the Northeast that had disseminated to mainstream American music through Italian American performers. Greasers were heavily associated with the culture surrounding rock n&#x27; roll, a musical genre that had induced feelings of a moral panic among older middle-class generations during the mid-to-late 1950s, to whom greasers epitomized the connection between rock music and juvenile delinquency professed by several important social and cultural observers of the time.

== Portrayal in media and popular culture ==

* The first cinematic representation of the greaser subculture was the 1953 film &quot;The Wild One&quot;. 
* The music group Sha-Na-Na, formed in the late 1960s, models their onstage presence on New York City greasers (the band members themselves were mostly Ivy Leaguers). 
* The 1967 critically acclaimed young adult novel &quot;The Outsiders&quot; by S. E. Hinton told the story of a gang of greasers, and was controversial upon release due to its depiction of gang violence. The film adaptation of &quot;The Outsiders&quot; was released in 1983 and directed by Francis Ford Coppola. 
*The 1971 American musical and subsequent 1978 film &quot;Grease&quot; centers around greasers.
*The 1973 film &quot;American Graffiti&quot; by George Lucas has a greaser with the character of John Milner.
*Character Fonzie from the American TV show &quot;Happy Days&quot; is a stereotypical greaser who was frequently seen on his motorcycle, wore a leather jacket, and typified the essence of cool, in contrast to his circle of friends.
*Characters Leonard &quot;Lenny&quot; Kosnowski and Andrew &quot;Squiggy&quot; Squiggman from the American sitcom &quot;Laverne &amp; Shirley&quot;, a spin-off of &quot;Happy Days&quot;. 
* The 1990 John Waters film &quot;Cry-Baby&quot; is a camp reminiscence of Baltimore greasers during the 1950s.
* In the &quot;Fallout&quot; video game franchise (1997–present) gangs of greasers are commonly encountered in the 1950s-inspired post-nuclear apocalypse setting. 
* The 2006 video game &quot;Bully&quot; featured a social hierarchy that included a greaser clique.
* The 2008 Steven Spielberg and George Lucas film &quot;Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull&quot; has the character of Mutt Williams who is portrayed as a greaser.
* In many Stephen King stories, members of the subculture are portrayed as bullies or psychopaths brandishing switchblades, such as in &quot;Sometimes They Come Back&quot; (1975).

<text>Frances Crofts Cornford (née Darwin; 30 March 1886 – 19 August 1960) was an English poet.

==Biography==
She was the daughter of the botanist Francis Darwin and Newnham College fellow Ellen Wordsworth Crofts (1856–1903), and born into the Darwin—Wedgwood family. She was a granddaughter of the British naturalist Charles Darwin. Her older half-brother was the golf writer Bernard Darwin. She was brought up in Cambridge, among a dense social network of aunts, uncles, and cousins, and was educated privately. Because of the similarity of her first name, her father&#x27;s and her husband&#x27;s, she was known to her family before her marriage as &quot;FCD&quot; and after her marriage as &quot;FCC&quot; and her husband Francis Cornford was known as &quot;FMC&quot;. Her father Sir Francis Darwin, a son of Charles Darwin, yet another &#x27;Francis&#x27;, was known to their family as &quot;Frank&quot;, or as &quot;Uncle Frank&quot;.

She died of heart failure at her home in Cambridge, on 19 August 1960. She is buried at the Parish of the Ascension Burial Ground in Cambridge, where she is in the same grave as her father Sir Francis Darwin. Her mother Ellen Wordsworth Darwin, née Crofts, is buried in St. Andrews Church&#x27;s churchyard in Girton, Cambridgeshire.

==Personal life==
In 1909, Frances Darwin married Francis Cornford, a classicist and poet. They had five children:
* Helena Cornford (1913–1996); married Joseph L. Henderson in 1934
*John Cornford (1915–1936), a poet and Communist who was killed in the Spanish Civil War
*Christopher Cornford (1917–1993), an artist and writer
* Hugh Wordsworth Cornford (1921–1997), medical doctor
* Ruth Clare (1924–1992); married Cecil Hall Chapman, the son of Sydney Chapman in 1947.

==Works==
Frances Cornford published several books of verse, including her debut (as &quot;F.C.D&quot;), &quot;The Holtbury Idyll&quot; (1908), &quot;Poems&quot; (1910), &quot;Spring Morning&quot; (1915), &quot;Autumn Midnight&quot; (1923), and &quot;Different Days&quot; (1928). &quot;Mountains and Molehills&quot; (1935) was illustrated with woodcuts by her cousin Gwen Raverat.

She wrote poems including &quot;The Guitarist Tunes Up&quot;:

&lt;poem&gt;
With what attentive courtesy he bent
Over his instrument;
Not as a lordly conqueror who could
Command both wire and wood,
But as a man with a loved woman might
Inquiring with delight
What slight essential things she had to say
Before they started, he and she, to play.
&lt;/poem&gt;

One of Frances Cornford&#x27;s poems was a favourite of Philip Larkin and his lover Maeve Brennan. &quot;All Souls&#x27; Night&quot; uses the superstition that a dead lover will appear to a still faithful partner on that November date. Maeve, many years after Larkin&#x27;s death, would re-read the poem on All Souls:

&lt;poem&gt;
My love came back to me
Under the November tree
Shelterless and dim.
He put his hand upon my shoulder,
He did not think me strange or older,
Nor I him.
&lt;/poem&gt;

Although the myth enhances the poem, it can be read as the meeting of older, former lovers.

===&quot;To a Fat Lady Seen from the Train&quot;===
Cornford is possibly best remembered for her triolet poem &quot;To a Fat Lady Seen from the Train&quot; in &quot;Poems&quot; of 1910.
&lt;poem&gt;
O why do you walk through the fields in gloves,
Missing so much and so much?
O fat white woman whom nobody loves,
Why do you walk through the fields in gloves,
When the grass is soft as the breast of doves
And shivering-sweet to the touch?
O why do you walk through the fields in gloves,
Missing so much and so much?
&lt;/poem&gt;

To which G. K. Chesterton replied in &quot;The Fat Lady Answers&quot;, in his &quot;Collected Poems&quot; of 1927:
&lt;poem&gt;
Why do you rush through the field in trains,
Guessing so much and so much.
Why do you flash through the flowery meads,
Fat-head poet that nobody reads;
And why do you know such a frightful lot
About people in gloves as such?
&lt;/poem&gt;

Earlier, in 1910, A. E. Housman had written a parody in a private letter:
&lt;poem&gt;
O why do you walk through the fields in boots,
Missing so much and so much?
O fat white woman whom nobody shoots,
Why do you walk through the fields in boots,
When the grass is soft as the breast of coots ...
&lt;/poem&gt;

The first lines of this poem were spoken by a character in Agatha Christie&#x27;s 1939 novel &quot;Murder is Easy&quot;. 
Elizabeth Goudge quotes the poem &quot;The Country Bedroom&quot; in her autobiography, &quot;The Joy of the Snow&quot; at the end of Chap XIV, p 252, when Goudge is describing finding her final home &quot;Rose Cottage&quot;.

&lt;poem&gt;
My room&#x27;s a square and candle-lighted boat,
In the surrounding depths of night afloat;
My windows are the portholes, and the seas
The sound of rain on the dark apple-trees.

Seamonster-like beneath, an old horse blows
A snort of darkness from his sleeping nose,
Below, among drowned daisies. Far off, hark!
Far off one owl amidst the waves of dark.
&lt;/poem&gt;

<text>Aristide Bruant (; 6 May 1851 – 11 February 1925) was a French cabaret singer, comedian, and nightclub owner. He is best known as the man in the red scarf and black cape featured on certain famous posters by Henri de Toulouse-Lautrec. He has also been credited as the creator of the &quot;chanson réaliste&quot; musical genre.

==Biography==

Born Louis Armand Aristide Bruand in the village of Courtenay, Loiret in France, Bruant left his home in 1866 at age fifteen, following his father&#x27;s death, to find employment. Making his way to the Montmartre Quarter of Paris, he hung out in the working-class bistros, where he finally was given an opportunity to show his musical talents. Although bourgeois by birth, he soon adopted the earthy language of his haunts, turning it into songs that told of the struggles of the poor.

Bruant began performing at cafe-concerts and developed a singing and comedy act that led to his being signed to appear at the Le Chat Noir club. Dressed in a red shirt, black velvet jacket, high boots, and a long red scarf, and using the stage name Aristide Bruant, he soon became a star of Montmartre, and when Henri de Toulouse-Lautrec began showing up at the cabarets and clubs, Bruant became one of the artist&#x27;s first friends. Toulouse-Lautrec designed the now iconic poster of Bruant, with his cape thrown over his shoulders and his famous red scarf around his neck, when he moved to the Café des Ambassadeurs in 1892.

In 1885, Bruant opened his own Montmartre club, a place he called &quot;Le Mirliton&quot; (The Reed Pipe). Although he hired other acts, Bruant put on a singing performance of his own. As the master of ceremonies for the various acts, he used the comedy of the insult to poke fun at the club&#x27;s upper-crust guests who were out &quot;slumming&quot; in Montmartre. His vaudeville-inspired mix of song, satire and entertainment developed into the musical genre called &quot;chanson réaliste&quot; (realist song). He also published a magazine called &quot;Le Mirliton&quot;, in which he printed illustrations and paintings by Lautrec.

Bruant died in Paris and was buried in Subligny&#x27;s cemetery, near his birthplace in the departement of Loiret. Rue Bruant in Paris XIII arrondissement was named, not in Aristide&#x27;s honor, but after the architect Libéral Bruant (1637-1697) whose church of the hospital Salpêtrière was built just north of the street.

==Songs==
Some of Bruant&#x27;s better known songs include: 
*A la Bastille
*A la Villette
*Meunier tu es cocu
*A Batignolles
*Serrez Vos Rangs
*A la Roquette
*La chanson des Michetons
*A Poissy
*A la Place Maubert
*Les petits joyeux
*Belleville-Menilmontant
*La Greviste
*Le Chat Noir
*Les Mômes de la Cloche

==History and culture==

Vladimir Lenin was in internal exile here from 1897 to 1900. In 1970, a museum dedicated to his time in Siberia was opened which became a prominent and popular local site. Russian and international visitors go there to see the history of Lenin&#x27;s stay as well as to see the peasant way of life during the 19th century. The area is also known for its nature reserves.

During 2003 and 2004, an ethnic music festival called the Sayan Ring () was started in Shushenskoye, which draws visitors from Russia and other countries. Different ethno-music styles are played during its 3–4 day duration.

==Climate==
The climate is very warm in summer: local people cultivate melons and watermelons. Winters are very cold with temperatures as low as .

<doc id="842822" wikidata="Q7263286" url="?curid=842822" title="Pyramid inch">
<text>The pyramid inch is a now discredited unit of measure formerly claimed by pyramidologists to have been used in ancient times.

==History==
The first suggestion that the builders of the Great Pyramid of Giza used units of measure related to modern measures is attributed to Oxford astronomy professor John Greaves (1602–1652), who journeyed to Egypt in 1638 to make measurements of the pyramid. His findings were published in his &quot;Pyramidographia&quot; (1646) and under his name in an anonymous tract. More than a century later, Greaves&#x27; measurements and additional measurements made by French engineers during Napoleon&#x27;s campaign in Egypt and Syria, were studied by John Taylor (1781–1864). Taylor claimed that the measurements indicated that the ancients had used a unit of measure about 1/1000 greater than a modern British inch. 

This was the origin of the &quot;pyramid inch&quot;. Taylor regarded the &quot;pyramid inch&quot; to be 1/25 of the &quot;sacred cubit&quot;, ancient unit based on the forearm length from the tip of the middle finger to the bottom of the elbow, whose existence had earlier been postulated by Isaac Newton. The principal argument was that the total length of the four sides of the pyramid would be 36524 (100 times the number of days in a year) if measured in pyramid inches. 

Taylor and his followers, who included the Astronomer Royal of Scotland Charles Piazzi Smyth (1819–1900), also found numerous apparent coincidences between the measurements of the pyramids and the geometry of the earth and the solar system. They concluded that the British system of measures was derived from a far more ancient, if not divine, system. During the 19th and early 20th centuries, this theory played a significant role in the debates over whether Britain and the United States should adopt the metric system.

The theory of Taylor and Smyth gained many eminent supporters and detractors during the following decades, but by the end of the 19th century it had lost most of its mainstream scientific support. The greatest blow to the theory was dealt by the Egyptologist Flinders Petrie (1853–1942), whose father was a believer. When Petrie went to Egypt in 1880 to perform new measurements, he found that the pyramid was several feet smaller than previously believed, including the missing capstone. This so undermined the theory that Petrie rejected it, writing &quot;there is no authentic example, that will bear examination, of the use or existence of any such measure as a ‘Pyramid inch,’ or of a cubit of 25.025 British inches.&quot;

The pyramid inch now appears to have no significant scientific support. No direct evidence for it has ever been found.

<doc id="842825" wikidata="Q867283" url="?curid=842825" title="The Iron Giant">
<text>The Iron Giant is a 1999 American animated science fiction film produced by Warner Bros. Feature Animation and directed by Brad Bird in his directorial debut. It is loosely based on the 1968 novel &quot;The Iron Man&quot; by Ted Hughes (which was published in the United States as &quot;The Iron Giant&quot;), and was written by Tim McCanlies from a story treatment by Bird. The film stars the voices of Jennifer Aniston, Harry Connick Jr., Vin Diesel, James Gammon, Cloris Leachman, John Mahoney, Eli Marienthal, Christopher McDonald, and M. Emmet Walsh. Set during the Cold War in 1957, the film centers on a young boy named Hogarth Hughes, who discovers and befriends a giant alien robot. With the help of a beatnik artist named Dean McCoppin, Hogarth attempts to prevent the U.S. military and Kent Mansley, a paranoid federal agent, from finding and destroying the Giant.

The film&#x27;s development began in 1994 as a musical with the involvement of the Who&#x27;s Pete Townshend, though the project took root once Bird signed on as director and hired McCanlies to write the screenplay in 1996. The film was animated using traditional animation, with computer-generated imagery used to animate the Iron Giant and other effects. The understaffed crew of the film completed it with half of the time and budget of other animated features. Michael Kamen composed the film&#x27;s score, which was performed by the Czech Philharmonic. It was the final film by Warner Bros. Feature Animation to be fully animated and not a live-action/animation hybrid.

&quot;The Iron Giant&quot; premiered at Mann&#x27;s Chinese Theater in Los Angeles on July 31, 1999, and was released in the United States on August 6. The film significantly underperformed at the box office, grossing $31.3 million worldwide against a production budget of $50 million, which was attributed to Warner Bros.&#x27; lack of marketing and skepticism towards animated film production following the box office failure of &quot;Quest for Camelot&quot; in the preceding year. Despite this, the film was praised for its story, animation, musical score, characters, the portrayal of the title character and the voice performances of Aniston, Connick, Diesel, Mahoney, Marienthal, and McDonald. The film was nominated for several awards, winning nine Annie Awards out of 15 nominations. Through home video releases and television syndication, the film gathered a cult following and is widely regarded as a modern animated classic, and one of the greatest animated films ever made. In 2015, an extended, remastered version of the film was re-released theatrically, and on home video the following year.

== Plot ==
In October 1957, during the Cold War, an object from space crashes in the ocean just off the coast of Maine and then enters the forest near the town of Rockwell. The following night, young Hogarth Hughes investigates and finds the object, a gigantic alien robot; he flees, but returns to save the giant from being electrocuted when the giant attemps to eat a substation. Hogarth eventually befriends the Giant, finding him docile and curious. When the Giant eats railroad tracks in the path of an oncoming train, the train collides with him and derails; Hogarth leads the Giant away from the area, discovering that he can self-repair. Hogarth shows the Giant his comic books, and compares him to the hero Superman.

The incidents lead paranoid U.S. government agent Kent Mansley to Rockwell. Deducing Hogarth&#x27;s involvement after talking with him and his widowed mother, Annie, Mansley rents a room in their house to keep an eye on him. Hogarth evades Mansley and leads the Giant to a junkyard owned by beatnik artist Dean McCoppin, who reluctantly agrees to keep him. Hogarth enjoys spending time with the Giant, but is compelled to explain the concept of death to the Giant after they witness hunters killing a deer.

Mansley interrogates and detains Hogarth after discovering a photograph of Hogarth and the Giant together, then sends U.S. Army General Shannon Rogard and a platoon of soldiers to the scrapyard to prove the Giant&#x27;s existence. Dean, having been forewarned by Hogarth, disguises the Giant as one of his art pieces, tricking the soldiers into leaving. While playing with a toy gun, Hogarth inadvertently activates the Giant&#x27;s defensive system, which fires a laser. Dean yells at the Giant for nearly killing Hogarth, and the horrified Giant flees into downtown Rockwell, with Hogarth in pursuit. Dean discovers that the Giant was only acting in self-defense, and pursues them both.

The Giant rescues two boys falling from a roof when he arrives, winning over the townspeople. Mansley spots the Giant, and Rogard orders his men to attack the robot, not realizing he is holding Hogarth. The Giant uses his flight system to evade the military at first, but is shot down and crash-lands.

Hogarth is rendered unconscious, but the Giant assumes that Hogarth is dead. The soldiers open fire, causing the Giant&#x27;s defense systems to activate and begin attacking the army. Mansley convinces Rogard to prepare a nuclear missile launch from the USS &quot;Nautilus&quot;, as conventional weapons seem to be ineffective. Hogarth awakens and hastily calms down the Giant, while Dean clarifies the situation to Rogard.

Rogard is ready to stand down and order the &quot;Nautilus&quot; to deactivate its primed missile, but a panicked Mansley snatches Rogard&#x27;s radio and orders the launch. Rogard reveals that, as the Giant has returned to Rockwell, the missile (which is targeted to him) will also destroy the town upon detonation. Mansley tries escaping, but the Giant thwarts him, and Rogard has Mansley arrested. To save the town, the Giant bids farewell to Hogarth and flies off to intercept the missile. Soaring into the missile&#x27;s path, the Giant remembers Hogarth&#x27;s words, &quot;You are who you choose to be,&quot; smiles contentedly, and declares himself &quot;Superman&quot; as he collides with the weapon. The missile explodes in the outer atmosphere, saving the soldiers and civilians in Rockwell. However, the Giant is presumably destroyed, devastating Hogarth, Dean, Annie, and Rogard.

Months later, Dean and Annie, now a couple, admire a memorial statue of the Giant that Dean has erected in the local park. Rogard gives Hogarth a package containing a screw from the Giant, which was the only remnant found. That night, Hogarth finds the screw trying to move on its own and, remembering the Giant&#x27;s ability to self-repair, happily allows the screw to leave. The screw joins many other parts as they converge on the Giant&#x27;s head on the Langjökull glacier in Iceland, and the Giant smiles as he begins reassembling himself.

== Voice cast ==
* Eli Marienthal as Hogarth Hughes, an intelligent, curious, energetic, and courageous 9-year-old boy with an active imagination. Marienthal&#x27;s performances were videotaped and given to animators to work with, which helped develop expressions and acting for the character. He is named after author Ted Hughes, who wrote the book that inspired the film, and artist Burne Hogarth.
* Jennifer Aniston as Annie Hughes, Hogarth&#x27;s mother, the widow of a military pilot, and a diner waitress. According to Bird, Aniston was the only casting suggestion made by Warner Bros. execs that he personally really liked and approved.
* Harry Connick Jr. as Dean McCoppin, a beatnik artist and junkyard owner. Bird felt it appropriate to make the character a member of the Beat Generation, as they were viewed as mildly threatening to small-town values during that time. An outsider himself, he is among the first to recognize the Giant as no threat.
* Vin Diesel as the Iron Giant, a 50 ft., metal-eating robot. Of unknown origin and created for an unknown purpose, the Giant involuntarily reacts defensively if he recognizes anything as a weapon, immediately attempting to destroy it. The Giant&#x27;s voice was originally going to be electronically modulated but the filmmakers decided they &quot;needed a deep, resonant and expressive voice to start with&quot;, so they hired Diesel.
* James Gammon as Foreman Marv Loach, a power station employee who follows the robot&#x27;s trail after it destroys the station.
** Gammon also voices Floyd Turbeaux, a farmer and friend of Earl Stutz.
* Cloris Leachman as Karen Tensedge, Hogarth&#x27;s fourth grade teacher at Redford Elementary School.
* Christopher McDonald as Kent Mansley, a paranoid federal government agent sent to investigate sightings of the Iron Giant. The logo on his official government car says he is from the &quot;Bureau of Unexplained Phenomena&quot;.
* John Mahoney as General Shannon Rogard, an experienced and level-headed military leader in Washington, D.C., Mansley&#x27;s superior at the Bureau of Unexplained Phenomena who goes from merely being annoyed and exasperated with Mansley to openly despising him.
* M. Emmet Walsh as Earl Stutz, a sailor and the first man to see the Giant.

In addition, Ollie Johnston and Frank Thomas voice the train&#x27;s engineers briefly seen near the start of the film. Johnston and Thomas, who were animators and members of Disney&#x27;s Nine Old Men, were cited by Bird as inspirations for his career, which he honored by incorporating their voices, likenesses, and first names into the film.

== Production ==
=== Development ===
The origins of the film lie in the book &quot;The Iron Man&quot; (1968), by poet Ted Hughes, who wrote the novel for his children to comfort them in the wake of their mother Sylvia Plath&#x27;s suicide. In the 1980s, rock musician Pete Townshend chose to adapt the book for a concept album; it was released as &quot;The Iron Man: A Musical&quot; in 1989. In 1991, Richard Bazley, who later became the film&#x27;s lead animator, pitched a version of &quot;The Iron Man&quot; to Don Bluth while working at his studio in Ireland. He created a story outline and character designs but Bluth passed on the project. After a stage musical was mounted in London, Des McAnuff, who had adapted &quot;Tommy&quot; with Townshend for the stage, believed that &quot;The Iron Man&quot; could translate to the screen, and the project was ultimately acquired by Warner Bros. Entertainment.

In late 1996, while developing the project on its way through, the studio saw the film as a perfect vehicle for Brad Bird, who at the time was working for Turner Feature Animation developing &quot;Ray Gunn&quot;. Turner Broadcasting had recently merged with Warner Bros. parent company Time Warner, and Bird was allowed to transfer to the Warner Bros. Animation studio to direct &quot;The Iron Giant&quot;. After reading the original &quot;Iron Man&quot; book by Hughes, Bird was impressed with the mythology of the story and in addition, was given an unusual amount of creative control by Warner Bros. This creative control involved introducing two new characters not present in the original book, Dean and Kent, setting the film in America, and discarding Townshend&#x27;s musical ambitions (who did not care either way, reportedly remarking, &quot;Well, whatever, I got paid&quot;). Bird would expand upon his desire to set the film in America in the 1950s in a later interview:

Ted Hughes, the original story&#x27;s author, died before the film&#x27;s release. His daughter, Frieda Hughes, saw the finished film on his behalf and loved it. Townshend, who stayed on as the film&#x27;s executive producer, enjoyed the final film as well.

=== Writing ===
Tim McCanlies was hired to write the script, though Bird was somewhat displeased with having another writer on board, as he wanted to write the screenplay himself. He later changed his mind after reading McCanlies&#x27; then-unproduced screenplay for &quot;Secondhand Lions&quot;. In Bird&#x27;s original story treatment, America and the USSR were at war at the end, with the Giant dying. McCanlies decided to have a brief scene displaying his survival, stating, &quot;You can&#x27;t kill E.T. and then not bring him back.&quot; McCanlies finished the script within two months. McCanlies was given a three-month schedule to complete a script, and it was by way of the film&#x27;s tight schedule that Warner Bros. &quot;didn&#x27;t have time to mess with us&quot; as McCanlies said. The question of the Giant&#x27;s backstory was purposefully ignored as to keep the story focused on his relationship with Hogarth. Bird considered the story difficult to develop due to its combination of unusual elements, such as &quot;paranoid fifties sci-fi movies with the innocence of something like &quot;The Yearling&quot;&quot;. Hughes himself was sent a copy of McCanlies&#x27; script and sent a letter back, saying how pleased he was with the version. In the letter, Hughes stated, &quot;I want to tell you how much I like what Brad Bird has done. He&#x27;s made something all of a piece, with terrific sinister gathering momentum and the ending came to me as a glorious piece of amazement. He&#x27;s made a terrific dramatic situation out of the way he&#x27;s developed &quot;The Iron Giant&quot;. I can&#x27;t stop thinking about it.&quot;

Bird combined his knowledge from his years in television to direct his first feature. He credited his time working on &quot;Family Dog&quot; as essential to team-building, and his tenure on &quot;The Simpsons&quot; as an example of working under strict deadlines. He was open to others on his staff to help develop the film; he would often ask crew members their opinions on scenes and change things accordingly. One of his priorities was to emphasize softer, character-based moments, as opposed to more frenetic scenes—something Bird thought was a problem with modern filmmaking. &quot;There has to be activity or sound effects or cuts or music blaring. It&#x27;s almost as if the audience has the remote and they&#x27;re going to change channels,&quot; he commented at the time. Storyboard artist Teddy Newton played an important role in shaping the film&#x27;s story. Newton&#x27;s first assignment on staff involved being asked by Bird to create a film within a film to reflect the &quot;hygiene-type movies that everyone saw when the bomb scare was happening.&quot; Newton came to the conclusion that a musical number would be the catchiest alternative, and the &quot;Duck and Cover&quot; sequence came to become one of the crew members&#x27; favorites of the film. Nicknamed &quot;The X-Factor&quot; by story department head Jeffery Lynch, the producers gave him artistic freedom on various pieces of the film&#x27;s script.

=== Animation ===
The financial failure of Warner&#x27;s previous animated effort, &quot;Quest for Camelot&quot;, which made the studio reconsider animated films, helped shape &quot;The Iron Giant&quot;″s production considerably. &quot;Three-quarters&quot; of the animation team on that film helped craft &quot;The Iron Giant&quot;. By the time it entered production, Warner Bros. informed the staff that there would be a smaller budget as well as time-frame to get the film completed. Although the production was watched closely, Bird commented &quot;They did leave us alone if we kept it in control and showed them we were producing the film responsibly and getting it done on time and doing stuff that was good.&quot; Bird regarded the trade-off as having &quot;one-third of the money of a Disney or DreamWorks film, and half of the production schedule&quot; but the payoff as having more creative freedom, describing the film as &quot;fully-made by the animation team; I don&#x27;t think any other studio can say that to the level that we can.&quot; A small part of the team took a weeklong research trip to Maine, where they photographed and videotaped five small cities. They hoped to accurately reflect its culture down to the minutiae; &quot;we shot store fronts, barns, forests, homes, home interiors, diners, every detail we could, including the bark on trees&quot;, said production designer Mark Whiting.

Bird stuck to elaborate scene planning, such as detailed animatics, to make sure there were no budgetary concerns. The team initially worked with Macromedia&#x27;s Director software, before switching to Adobe After Effects full-time. Bird was eager to use the then-nascent software, as it allowed for storyboard to contain indications of camera moves. The software became essential to that team—dubbed &quot;Macro&quot; early on—to help the studio grasp story reels for the film. These also allowed Bird to better understand what the film required from an editing perspective. In the end, he was proud of the way the film was developed, noting that &quot;We could imagine the pace and the unfolding of our film accurately with a relatively small expenditure of resources.&quot; The group would gather in a screening room to view completed sequences, with Bird offering suggestions by drawing onto the screen with a marker. Lead animator Bazley suggested this led to a sense of camaraderie among the crew, who were unified in their mission to create a good film. Bird cited his favorite moment of the film&#x27;s production as occurring in the editing room, when the crew gathered to test a sequence in which the Giant learns what a soul is. &quot;People in the room were spontaneously crying. It was pivotal; there was an undeniable feeling that we were really tapping into something,&quot; he recalled.

He opted to give the film&#x27;s animators portions to animate entirely, rather than the standard process of animating one character, in a throwback to the way Disney&#x27;s first features were created. The exception were those responsible for creating the Giant himself, who was created using computer-generated imagery due to the difficulty of creating a metal object &quot;in a fluid-like manner&quot;. They had additional trouble with using the computer model to express emotion. The Giant consisted of 7000 parts (the Battle Giant had 10,000 parts), and was designed by filmmaker Joe Johnston and refined by production designer Mark Whiting and Steve Markowski, head animator for the Giant. Using software, the team would animate the Giant &quot;on twos&quot; (every other frame, or twelve frames per second) when interacting with other characters, to make it less obvious it was a computer model. Bird brought in students from CalArts to assist in minor animation work due to the film&#x27;s busy schedule. He made sure to spread out the work on scenes between experienced and younger animators, noting, &quot;You overburden your strongest people and underburden the others [if you let your top talent monopolize the best assignments].&quot; Hiroki Itokazu designed all of the film&#x27;s CGI props and vehicles, which were created in a variety of software, including Alias Systems Corporation&#x27;s Maya, Alias&#x27; PowerAnimator, a modified version of Pixar&#x27;s RenderMan, Softimage 3D, Cambridge Animation&#x27;s Animo (now part of Toon Boom Technologies), Avid Elastic Reality, and Adobe Photoshop.

The art of Norman Rockwell, Edward Hopper and N.C. Wyeth inspired the design. Whiting strove for colors both evocative of the time period in which the film is set and also representative of its emotional tone; for example, Hogarth&#x27;s room is designed to reflect his &quot;youth and sense of wonder&quot;. That was blended with a style reminiscent of 1950s illustration. Animators studied Chuck Jones, Hank Ketcham, Al Hirschfeld and Disney films from that era, such as &quot;101 Dalmatians&quot;, for inspiration in the film&#x27;s animation.

=== Music ===

The score for the film was composed and conducted by Michael Kamen, making it the only film directed by Bird not to be scored by his future collaborator, Michael Giacchino, as of December 2024. Bird&#x27;s original temp score, &quot;a collection of Bernard Herrmann cues from &#x27;50s and &#x27;60s sci-fi films,&quot; initially scared Kamen. Believing the sound of the orchestra is important to the feeling of the film, Kamen &quot;decided to comb eastern Europe for an &quot;old-fashioned&quot; sounding orchestra and went to Prague to hear Vladimir Ashkenazy conduct the Czech Philharmonic in Strauss&#x27;s &quot;An Alpine Symphony&quot;.&quot; Eventually, the Czech Philharmonic was the orchestra used for the film&#x27;s score, with Bird describing the symphony orchestra as &quot;an amazing collection of musicians&quot;. The score for &quot;The Iron Giant&quot; was recorded in a rather unconventional manner, compared to most films: recorded over one week at the Rudolfinum in Prague, the music was recorded without conventional uses of syncing the music, in a method Kamen described in a 1999 interview as &quot;[being able to] play the music as if it were a piece of classical repertoire.&quot; Kamen&#x27;s score for &quot;The Iron Giant&quot; won the Annie Award for Music in an Animated Feature Production on November 6, 1999.

=== Post-production ===
Bird opted to produce &quot;The Iron Giant&quot; in widescreen—specifically the wide 2.39:1 CinemaScope aspect ratio—but was warned against doing so by his advisers. He felt it was appropriate to use the format, as many films from the late 1950s were produced in such widescreen formats. He hoped to include the CinemaScope logo on a poster, partially as a joke, but 20th Century Fox, owner of the trademark, refused.

Bird later recalled that he clashed with executives who wished to add characters, such as a sidekick dog, set the film in the present day, and include a soundtrack of hip hop. This was due to concerns that the film was not merchandisable, to which Bird responded, &quot;If they were interested in telling the story, they should let it be what it wants to be.&quot; The film was also initially going to be released under the Warner Bros. Family Entertainment banner, the logo which features mascot Bugs Bunny in a tuxedo eating a carrot as seen in the film&#x27;s teaser trailer. Bird was against this for a multitude of reasons, mainly because he felt that the logo did not fit the tone of the movie, and eventually got confirmation that executives Bob Daley and Terry Semel agreed. Instead, Bird and his team developed another version of the logo to resemble the classic studio logo in a circle, famously employed in &quot;Looney Tunes&quot; shorts. He credited executives Lorenzo di Bonaventura and Courtney Vallenti with helping him achieve his vision, noting that they were open to his opinion.

According to a report from the time of its release, &quot;The Iron Giant&quot; cost $50 million to produce with an additional $30 million going towards marketing, though Box Office Mojo later reported its budget as $70 million. It was regarded as a lower-budget film, in comparison to the films distributed by Walt Disney Pictures.

== Themes ==
When he began work on the film, Bird was in the midst of coping with the death of his sister, Susan, who was shot and killed by her estranged husband. In researching its source material, he learned that Hughes wrote &quot;The Iron Man&quot; as a means of comforting his children after his wife, Sylvia Plath, died by suicide, specifically through the metaphor of the title character being able to re-assemble itself after being damaged. These experiences formed the basis of Bird&#x27;s pitch to Warner Bros., which was based around the idea &quot;What if a gun had a soul, and didn&#x27;t want to be a gun?&quot;; the completed film was also dedicated to Hughes and Susan. McCanlies commented that &quot;at a certain point, there are deciding moments when we pick who we want to be. And that plays out for the rest of your life&quot;, adding that films can provide viewers with a sense of right and wrong, and expressed a wish that &quot;The Iron Giant&quot; would &quot;make us feel like we&#x27;re all part of humanity [which] is something we need to feel.&quot; When some critics compared the film to &quot;E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial&quot; (1982), Bird responded by saying &quot;E.T. doesn&#x27;t go kicking ass. He doesn&#x27;t make the Army pay. Certainly you risk having your hip credentials taken away if you want to evoke anything sad or genuinely heartfelt.&quot;

== Release ==
=== Marketing ===

&quot;The Iron Giant&quot; was a commercial failure during its theatrical release; consensus among critics was that its failure was, in part, due to lack of promotion from Warner Bros. This was largely attributable to the reception of &quot;Quest for Camelot&quot;; after its release, Warner would not give Bird and his team a release date for their film until April 1999. After wildly successful test screenings, the studio was shocked by the response: the test scores were their highest for a film in 15 years, according to Bird. They had neglected to prepare a successful marketing strategy for the film—such as cereal and fast food tie-ins—with little time left before its scheduled release. Bird remembered that the studio produced one teaser poster for the film, which became its eventual poster. Brad Ball, who had been assigned the role of marketing the film, was candid after its release, noting that the studio did not commit to a planned Burger King toy plan. IGN stated that &quot;In a mis-marketing campaign of epic proportions at the hands of Warner Bros., they simply didn&#x27;t realize what they had on their hands.&quot;

The studio needed an $8 million opening to ensure success, but they were unable to properly promote it preceding the release. They nearly delayed the film by several months to better prepare. &quot;They said, &#x27;we should delay it and properly lead up to its release,&#x27; and I said &#x27;you guys have had two and a half years to get ready for this,&#x27;&quot; recalled Bird. Press outlets took note of its absence of marketing, with some reporting that the studio had spent more money on marketing for the intended summer blockbuster &quot;Wild Wild West&quot; instead. Warner Bros. scheduled Sunday sneak preview screenings for the film prior to its release, as well as a preview of the film on the online platform Webcastsneak.

=== Home media and television syndication ===
After criticism that it mounted an ineffective marketing campaign for its theatrical release, Warner Bros. revamped its advertising strategy for the video release of the film, including tie-ins with Honey Nut Cheerios, AOL and General Motors and secured the backing of three U.S. congressmen (Ed Markey, Mark Foley and Howard Berman). Awareness of the film was increased by its February 2000 release as a pay-per-view title, which also increased traffic to the film&#x27;s website.

&quot;The Iron Giant&quot; was released on VHS and DVD on November 23, 1999, with a Laserdisc release following on December 6. Warner Bros. spent $35 million to market the home video release of the film. The VHS edition came in three versions—pan and scan, pan and scan with an affixed Giant toy to the clamshell case, and a widescreen version. All of the initial widescreen home video releases were in 1.85:1, the incorrect aspect ratio for the film. In 2000, television rights to the film were sold to Cartoon Network and TNT for $3 million. Cartoon Network showed the film continuously for 24 consecutive hours in the early 2000s for such holidays as the Fourth of July and Thanksgiving.

The Special Edition DVD was released on November 16, 2004. In 2014, Bird entered discussions with Warner Bros. regarding the possibility of releasing &quot;The Iron Giant&quot; on Blu-ray. On April 23, he wrote on Twitter that &quot;WB &amp; I have been talking. But they want a bare-bones disc. I want better,&quot; and encouraged fans to send tweets to Warner Home Video in favor of a Special Edition Blu-ray of the film. The film was ultimately released on Blu-ray on September 6, 2016, and included both the theatrical and 2015 Signature Edition cuts, as well as a documentary entitled &quot;The Giant&#x27;s Dream&quot; that covered the making of the film. This version also received a DVD release months earlier on February 16 with &quot;The Giant&#x27;s Dream&quot; documentary removed. This film became available on HBO Max on November 1, 2020.

== Reception ==
=== Critical response ===
&quot;The Iron Giant&quot; received critical acclaim. On Rotten Tomatoes, the film holds a 96% approval rating based on 144 reviews with an average rating of 8.20/10. The website&#x27;s critics consensus reads, &quot;The endearing &quot;Iron Giant&quot; tackles ambitious topics and complex human relationships with a steady hand and beautifully animated direction from Brad Bird.&quot; Metacritic, which uses a weighted average, assigned the film a score of 85 out of 100 based on 29 critics, indicating &quot;universal acclaim&quot;. Audiences polled by CinemaScore gave the film an average grade of &quot;A&quot; on an A+ to F scale. The Reel Source forecasting service calculated that &quot;96–97%&quot; of audiences that attended recommended the film.

Kenneth Turan of the &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot; called it &quot;straight-arrow and subversive, [and] made with simplicity as well as sophistication,&quot; writing, &quot;it feels like a classic even though it&#x27;s just out of the box.&quot; Roger Ebert of the &quot;Chicago Sun-Times&quot; gave the film 3.5 out of 4 stars, and compared it, both in story and animation, to the works of Japanese director Hayao Miyazaki: &quot;Like the new Japanese animated films, &quot;The Iron Giant&quot; is happy to be a &#x27;real movie&#x27; in everything but live action. There are no cute little animals and not a single musical number: It&#x27;s a story, plain and simple... It works as a lot of animation does, to make you forget from time to time that these are moving drawings, because the story and characters are so compelling.&quot; He concluded that it was &quot;not just a cute romp but an involving story that has something to say.&quot; &quot;The New Yorker&quot; reviewer Michael Sragow dubbed it a &quot;modern fairy tale&quot;, writing, &quot;The movie provides a master class in the use of scale and perspective—and in its power to open up a viewer&#x27;s heart and mind.&quot; &quot;Time&quot; Richard Schickel deemed it &quot;a smart live-and-let-live parable, full of glancing, acute observations on all kinds of big subjects—life, death, the military-industrial complex.&quot; Lawrence Van Gelder, writing for &quot;The New York Times&quot;, deemed it a &quot;smooth, skilled example of animated filmmaking.&quot; Joe Morgenstern of &quot;The Wall Street Journal&quot; felt it &quot;beautiful, oh so beautiful, as a work of coherent art&quot;, noting, &quot;be assured that the film is, before anything else, deliciously funny and deeply affecting&quot;.

Both Hollywood trade publications were positive: David Hunter of &quot;The Hollywood Reporter&quot; predicted it to be a sleeper hit and called it &quot;outstanding&quot;, while Lael Loewenstein of &quot;Variety&quot; called it &quot;a visually appealing, well-crafted film [...] an unalloyed success.&quot; Bruce Fretts of &quot;Entertainment Weekly&quot; commented, &quot;I have long thought that I was born without the gene that would allow me to be emotionally drawn in by drawings. That is, until I saw &quot;The Iron Giant&quot;.&quot; Peter Stack of the &quot;San Francisco Chronicle&quot; agreed that the storytelling was far superior to other animated films, and cited the characters as plausible and noted the richness of moral themes. Jeff Millar of the &quot;Houston Chronicle&quot; agreed with the basic techniques as well, and concluded the voice cast excelled with a great script by Tim McCanlies. &quot;The Washington Post&quot; Stephen Hunter, while giving the film 4 out of 5 stars, opined, &quot;The movie — as beautifully drawn, as sleek and engaging as it is — has the annoyance of incredible smugness.&quot;

=== Box office ===
&quot;The Iron Giant&quot; opened at Mann&#x27;s Chinese Theater in Los Angeles on July 31, 1999, with a special ceremony preceding the screening in which a concrete slab bearing the title character&#x27;s footprint was commemorated. The film opened in Los Angeles and New York City on August 4, 1999, with a wider national release occurring on August 6 in the United States. It opened in 2,179 theaters in the U.S., ranking at number nine at the box office accumulating $5.7 million over its opening weekend. It was quick to drop out of the top ten; by its fourth week, it had accumulated only $18.9 million—far under its reported $50 million budget. According to Dave McNary of the &quot;Los Angeles Daily News&quot;, &quot;Its weekend per-theater average was only $2,631, an average of $145 or perhaps 30 tickets per showing&quot;—leading theater owners to quickly discard the film. At the time, Warner Bros. was shaken by the resignations of executives Bob Daly and Terry Semel, making the failure much worse. T.L. Stanley of &quot;Brandweek&quot; cited it as an example of how media tie-ins were now essential to guaranteeing a film&#x27;s success.

The film went on to gross $23.2 million domestically and $8.1 million internationally for a total of $31.3 million worldwide. Analysts deemed it a victim of poor timing and &quot;a severe miscalculation of how to attract an audience.&quot; Lorenzo di Bonaventura, president of Warner Bros. at the time, explained, &quot;People always say to me, &#x27;Why don&#x27;t you make smarter family movies?&#x27; The lesson is, Every time you do, you get slaughtered.&quot;

=== Accolades ===

The Hugo Awards nominated &quot;The Iron Giant&quot; for Best Dramatic Presentation, while the Science Fiction and Fantasy Writers of America honored Brad Bird and Tim McCanlies with the Nebula Award nomination. The British Academy of Film and Television Arts gave the film a Children&#x27;s Award as Best Feature Film. In addition &quot;The Iron Giant&quot; won nine Annie Awards out of fifteen nominations, winning every category it was nominated for, with another nomination for Best Home Video Release at The Saturn Awards. IGN ranked &quot;The Iron Giant&quot; as the fifth favorite animated film of all time in a list published in 2010. In 2008, the American Film Institute nominated &quot;The Iron Giant&quot; for its Top 10 Animated Films list.

==Legacy==
The film has gathered a cult following since its original release. In 2018, when questioned over social media if there was ever a possibility of a sequel, Bird stated that because the film was considered a financial failure, a sequel was not likely to ever happen, but he also stressed that he considered the story of &quot;The Iron Giant&quot; to be completely self-contained in the film and saw no need for extending the story.

The Cartoon Network series &quot;Mad&quot;, did a parody of the movie as well as the film &quot;The Iron Lady&quot; for their Season 3 premiere entitled &quot;The Iron Giant Lady&quot;. In the sketch, British prime minister Margaret Thatcher is the Giant and inspires other gynoids to take positions of political power.

In the Season 7 episode of &quot;Futurama&quot; entitled &quot;Assie Come Home&quot;, the Iron Giant&#x27;s head can be seen in Yuri&#x27;s chop-shop in Filthytown.

The designers of the 2015 video game &quot;Ori and the Blind Forest&quot; were guided by inspirations from the film and Disney″s &quot;The Lion King&quot;.

In the &quot;Lego Movie&quot; spin-off series &quot;Unikitty!&quot;, the episode entitled &quot;Kaiju Kitty&quot; references the film&#x27;s climatic moment of the Giant being blown up by the missile.

The Iron Giant appears in Steven Spielberg&#x27;s 2018 science fiction film &quot;Ready Player One&quot;. Aech had collected the parts of the Iron Giant, which she later controlled during the Battle of Castle Anorak, where he teams up with Gundam to fight Mechagodzilla. After the Iron Giant sacrifices itself and falls into a pool of lava, it gives a thumbs up to Wade and his crew while it sinks into the lava paying direct homage to the end of &quot;Terminator 2: Judgment Day&quot; when the T-800 gives the thumbs up to both John &amp; Sarah Connor as it sacrifices itself into the molten steel.

The Iron Giant appears in Malcolm D. Lee&#x27;s 2021 basketball film &quot;Space Jam: A New Legacy&quot;. He is among the characters in the Warner Bros. 3000 Entertainment Server-Verse that watches the basketball game between the Tune Squad and the Goon Squad. After the Tune Squad won the game, the Giant shared a fist bump with King Kong.

The Iron Giant appears as a playable character in the fighting game &quot;MultiVersus&quot; on July 26, 2022, as a part of its &quot;open beta&quot;.

The Iron Giant appears in the &quot;Teen Titans Go!&quot; episode, &quot;Warner Bros. 100th Anniversary&quot;. He is among the remains of Blockbuster Island.

Beto Tlahuetl, director of the Mexican music band &quot;Grupo Soñador&quot;, stated that he was inspired by the movie to write the song &quot;El Gigante de Hierro&quot; (The Iron Giant) after dreaming of the Giant dancing in Los Angeles streets. The lyrics emphasize the theme of never giving up on a daughter&#x27;s love by being the biggest protector.

===&quot;Signature Edition&quot;===
A remastered and extended cut of the film, named the &quot;Signature Edition&quot;, was shown in one-off screenings across the United States and Canada on September 30, 2015, and October 4, 2015. The edition is approximately two minutes longer than the original cut, and features a brief scene with Annie and Dean in the cafe and the Giant&#x27;s dream sequence. Both scenes were storyboarded by Bird during the production on the original film, but could not be finished due to time and budget constraints. Before they were fully completed for this new version, they were presented as deleted storyboard sequences on the 2004 DVD bonus features. They were animated in 2015 by Duncan Studio, which employed several animators that worked on the original film, under Bird&#x27;s supervision. The film&#x27;s &quot;Signature Edition&quot; was released on DVD and for digital download on February 16, 2016, with an official Blu-ray release of this cut following on September 6. Along with the additional scenes, it also showcases abandoned ideas that were not initially used due to copyright reasons, specifically a nod to Disney via a &quot;Tomorrowland&quot; commercial, which was also a reference to his then-recently released film of the same name, and a reference regarding the film being shot with CinemaScope cameras.

On March 14, 2016, coinciding with the release of the &quot;Signature Edition&quot;, it was announced that &quot;The Art of the Iron Giant&quot; would be written by Ramin Zahed and published by Insight Editions, featuring concept art and other materials from the film.

<text>Norhamshire was an exclave of County Durham in England. It was first mentioned in 995, when it formed part of the lands of the priory at Lindisfarne. When the lands north of the River Tees were partitioned into Northumberland and County Durham it, along with Bedlingtonshire and Islandshire, stayed under the jurisdiction of Durham despite being north of the River Tyne.

This situation persisted until the Counties (Detached Parts) Act 1844, when it became the Hundred of Norham in Northumberland, to which it had already been united for Parliamentary purposes by the Reform Act 1832. The district originally was the single parish of Norham, which had various townships - the townships became separate civil parishes in 1866. The parishes of Norhamshire were:

*Cornhill-on-Tweed
*Duddo
*Felkington
*Grindon
*Horncliffe
*Loanend
*Longridge
*Norham Mains
*Norham
*Shoreswood
*Thornton
*Twizell

Elwick was also a (detached) township of the parish of Norham but was associated with Islandshire instead.

Béart was born Guy Béhart-Hasson (originally spelled Béhar-Hassan) in Cairo, Egypt, to a Sephardic Jewish family, that later sought refuge in Lebanon during his childhood. His father&#x27;s work as an accountant and business consultant saw the family move frequently, leading to a childhood spent in France, Greece, and Mexico, in addition to Egypt. His family settled in Lebanon where he did his secondary studies, between ten and seventeen years old, age at which he obtained his French baccalaureate in elementary mathematics at the International College of Beirut, where his interest in music developed to the point that he left for Paris to study at the &quot;École nationale de musique&quot;. In addition to music, he also obtained a degree in engineering.

When his father died in 1952, the young Béhart chose to pursue a career in engineering in order to help support his family, studying at the prestigious École nationale des ponts et chaussées. Simultaneously, however, he enrolled in Paris&#x27;s École nationale de musique, studying violin and mandolin, and in his spare time wrote songs and worked the Paris cabaret circuit, where he played guitar and sang under the stage name &quot;Guy Béart&quot;. When a version of one of his songs by a popular performer of the day became a huge success, demand for his writing talents increased and he composed for Juliette Gréco and others. Taken under the wing of renowned music producer Jacques Canetti and fellow musician Boris Vian, he released an album of his own, which won the prestigious Grand Prix de l&#x27;Académie du Disque français in 1958. 

Normally shy, Béart initially suffered from stage fright and struggled during his concert debut at the Paris Olympia. His biggest hit came when he wrote the soundtrack of the 1958 motion picture, &quot;L&#x27;Eau vive&quot; (&quot;Girl and the River&quot; in the USA). The title song of the film is considered a classic of what is known as French &quot;chanson&quot;. Despite his leap to fame, Béart&#x27;s singing career was soon swamped by the rising tide of American rock and roll. However, reinventing himself as a host of a television show featuring musical stars from a variety of genres, he remained in the public eye and eventually made a recording comeback.

From his first wife Cécile de Bonnefoy du Charmel he had a daughter, Ève (born 1959). 

In 1963 he and his second wife, Geneviève Galéa (pseudonym of Geneviève Guillery), had a daughter, Emmanuelle, who would grow up to be an actress. 

After Béart&#x27;s television show ended in 1970, his popularity waned but he continued to record new music that was readily purchased by a loyal following. He was the co-composer of the 1977 Luxembourg entry at the Eurovision Song Contest. By the early 1980s he was almost completely out of the spotlight and, although only in his early fifties, he suffered from a number of serious health problems. In 1987, he published a book about his illness entitled &quot;Crazy Hope&quot; that, combined with his daughter&#x27;s success in the blockbuster film &quot;Manon of the Spring&quot;, brought a resurgence of popularity. More than 25 years after his first appearance at the Paris Olympia, he returned for a series of highly successful performances.

In 1994, Béart was awarded the Grand Prix de l&#x27;Académie française in recognition of his achievements over his long career. He continued to perform at a variety of venues around the country and in 1999 did a five-week run at Bobino in Montparnasse that was so popular it allowed for a successful re-release of his double live album recorded at the Olympia.

In the 2000s, he only made rare appearances on stage but many of his songs, of which Béart wrote more than 300 by himself, are still popular with his fans.

Béart died of a heart attack at the age of 85 in Garches, on 16 September 2015.

<text>Pompeiopolis () was a Roman city in ancient Paphlagonia, identified in the early 19th century with the ruins of Zımbıllı Tepe, located near Taşköprü, Kastamonu Province in the Black Sea Region of Turkey. The exact location is 40 km north-east of Kastamonu and a short distance across the river from modern Taşköprü, in the valley of the Gökırmak or Gök River (, &quot;Amnías&quot;). The borders of Pompeiopolis reached the Küre mountains to the north, Ilgaz mountains to the south, Halys river to the east and Pınarbaşı valley to the west.

Pompeiopolis was one of the seven cities founded by the Roman general Pompey the Great along the fluvial plains of Iris, Halys and Amnias in 64/63 BC, when he conquered the Pontic Kingdom in Northern Anatolia and incorporated the region into the new Roman double province of Bithynia-Pontus. It was later assigned by Mark Antony to the vassal princes of Paphlagonia, and in 6/5 BC was re-integrated into the Roman Empire and placed under the governor of the province of Galatia. During its peak in the 2nd Century AD the city was capital of the Roman Province Paphlagonia as some inscriptions on stone and coins bear the title &quot;Metropolis of Paphlagonia&quot;. During the imperial era, several families from Pompeiopolis rose to the imperial aristocracy, such as those of Gaius Claudius Severus (consul suffectus in AD 112), Gnaeus Claudius Severus Arabianus (consul in AD 146) and Gnaeus Claudius Severus (consul in AD 173) and possibly Tiberius Claudius Subatianus Aquila (praefectus of Egypt in AD 206–211) and Tiberius Claudius Subatianus Proculus (governor of Numidia in AD 208–210).
Being a bishopric since the early 4th century at latest, Pompeiopolis received the title of autocephalous archdiocese at some time during the reign of Justinian I. Within the church province of Paphlagonia, Pompeiopolis always ranked immediately after Gangra, and above the other bishoprics.
This region was conquered by the invading Turks in the early 13th century. In the 10th/11th century, Pompeiopolis was a metropolitan see until the 14th century, when this diocese was suppressed. Among the fourteen known titular holders of the Christian diocese are Philadelphus at the First Council of Nicaea, Severus of Constantinople and Theodore of Constantinople. The bishopric of Pompeiopolis in Paphlagonia is included in the Catholic Church&#x27;s list of titular sees. In the early 13th century, Pompeiopolis fell under the Seljuk rule and its name changed to Taşköprü (Stone Bridge).

In 2006, an international project for a holistic investigation of Pompeiopolis was initiated with extended surveys and goal-oriented excavations. Since 2017 the Kastamonu Museum is carrying out the annual excavations and conservation activities for the touristic development of the site.
Although no remains were visible on the surface in 2005, a systematic geophysical survey over Zımbıllı Tepe detected the outline of a large city with roads, public buildings, and two theaters that were successively archaeologically investigated. The excavations in the major theatre unearthed the lowest marble seat rows as well as inscribed architraves with decorated friezes from the scaenae frons. From the inscription, it is understood that at least the stage was built around AD 150. The theatre was dismantled within the 5th century. Scarce remains of an octagonal building were previously identified as the tholos of a macellum, while few Christian graves excavated in 2016 in this area have suggested a later use as a church of the octagonal building.

A multiphase Roman domus at the north-eastern foot of Zımbıllı Tepe was first discovered in 1984 by a rescue intervention of the Museum of Kastamonu and reopened in 2006-2008 by the German team. This grand-house occupies a whole block within a network of orthogonal roads that organize the urban plan of this part of the city. The north-eastern blocks were built around the mid-3rd century AD and were progressively deserted since the beginning of the 7th century, with few episodes of partial reoccupation recorded until the 12th century. The grand-house is 2550 square metres wide, its layout is organized around a central peristyle and the northern side is provided by an honour court with direct accesses to wealthy reception rooms decorated with opus sectile wall revetments and mosaic floors. At least four rooms were equipped with a hypocaust heating system. The extensive excavation of the grand-house, still in progress, is accompanied by a systematic conservation program financed by the Meda Foundation, aimed at preserving and developing the monument into a public archaeological area with the involvement of local expertise and stakeholders.

It is argued that Pompeiopolis was founded to take over the administrative function of the Hellenistic fortress Pimolisa located in today´s Boyabat which was abandoned and destroyed in the aftermath of the Mithridatic Wars. Although no architectural remains in hitherto excavated areas can yet be assigned to the early phase of the city several coin-finds from this period leave no doubt about the localization of Pompeiopolis on the Zımbıllı Tepe.
The stone bridge which spans the Amnias River (Gökirmak)linked the Roman period urban center on the Zımbıllı Tepe with the opposite riverbank where the farmlands of the city were situated. The city center was gradually moved to the floodplain at the southern riverbank during the early Byzantine period. The Byzantine Pompeiopolis is covered today by Taşköprü where building remains and finds are observed in the construction pits of the underground car park of Cumhuriyet Meydanı. 
The excavated archaeological finds are exhibited or stored in the Museum of Archaeology of Kastamonu. A small museum adjacent to the excavation house, created in 2014, exhibits stone monuments like inscriptions, architectural elements, grave stelae from the city. The municipal history museum in Taşköprü established in 2017 presents some hypothetical digital reconstructions of the city´s lost appearance alongside objects from the younger history of Taşköprü.

<doc id="842834" wikidata="Q4735680" url="?curid=842834" title="Alquist Priolo Special Studies Zone Act">
<text>The Alquist-Priolo Earthquake Fault Zoning Act was signed into California law on December 22, 1972, to mitigate the hazard of surface faulting to structures for human occupancy.

The act in its current form has three main provisions:

1) It directs the state&#x27;s California Geological Survey agency (then known as the California Division of Mines and Geology) to compile detailed maps of the surface traces of known active faults. These maps include both the best known location where faults cut the surface and a buffer zone around the known trace(s);

2) It requires property owners (or their real estate agents) to formally and legally disclose that their property lies within the zones defined on those maps before selling the property; and

3) It prohibits new construction of houses within these zones unless a comprehensive geologic investigation shows that the fault does not pose a hazard to the proposed structure.

The act was one of several that changed building codes and practices to improve earthquake safety. These changes are intended to reduce the damage from future earthquakes.

== Background ==
This state law was a direct result of the 1971 San Fernando earthquake (also called the &#x27;Sylmar earthquake&#x27;), which was associated with extensive surface fault ruptures that damaged numerous homes, commercial buildings, and other structures. Surface rupture is the most easily avoided seismic hazard.

In January 1972, Governor Ronald Reagan established the &quot;Governor’s Earthquake Council&quot; as a reaction to the Sylmar quake, whose recommendations led to the act.
It went into effect on March 7, 1973. The law was amended a few years later to include a disclosure obligation for real estate licensees.
The act was called the Alquist-Priolo State Special Studies Zone Act prior to 1994. The act was amended September 26, 1974; May 4, 1975; September 28, 1975; September 22, 1976; September 27, 1979; September 21, 1990; and July 29, 1991.

== Earthquake hazards ==
Earthquakes happen when two blocks of the Earth&#x27;s crust move relative to one another. The place where the blocks meet is called a fault, and faults tend to show up as relatively straight lines on maps. Any structure built directly on top of the fault will be torn in two when the blocks move. Constructing a building to withstand this sort of movement (often several feet in a matter of seconds) is not practical, so it is best to avoid building directly on top of an active fault.

The law requires the California State Geologist to establish regulatory zones (known as Earthquake Fault Zones) around the surface traces of active faults and to issue appropriate maps. (&quot;Earthquake Fault Zones&quot; were called &quot;Special Studies Zones&quot; prior to January 1, 1994.) The maps are distributed to all affected cities, counties, and state agencies for their use in planning and controlling new or renewed construction. Local agencies must regulate most development projects within the zones.

== Limitations ==

Buildings built before 1972 may still lie on top of active faults, and those buildings can remain where they were originally built, unless they undergo a major remodel where more than 50% of the building changes. When that happens, they are treated the same as new construction (a geologic investigation must be undertaken and the hazard mitigated before a building permit can be issued). Projects include all land divisions and most structures for human occupancy. Single family wood-frame and steel-frame dwellings up to two stories not part of a development of four units or more are exempt. However, local agencies can be more restrictive than state law requires.

While the act mandates that owners disclose the fact that their property lies within the Alquist-Priolo zone when they sell it, there are no legal requirements to disclose the fact to renters living on the property. Renters should investigate the location of active faults on their own before signing a lease or rental agreement.

Legally, the act only applies to structures for human occupancy (houses, apartments, condominiums, etc.). However, the official geologic maps delineating the fault zones are used to help place a variety of structures on safe ground. For example, the Belmont Learning Center, a large school complex in Downtown Los Angeles was complicated by the discovery of a surface fault on the property in 2002. The Los Angeles Unified School District was required to remove a building that had been built directly atop the fault prior to its discovery.

The act only addresses the hazard of surface fault rupture and does not address other earthquake hazards. The Seismic Hazards Mapping Act, passed in 1990, addresses non-surface fault rupture earthquake hazards, including liquefaction and seismically induced landslides.
The act only applies to faults which are &quot;sufficiently active&quot; and &quot;well defined&quot;- for example the 1994 Northridge earthquake occurred on a blind thrust fault not zoned by the act because of a lack of surface evidence.

<doc id="842838" wikidata="Q993658" url="?curid=842838" title="Norham">
<text>Norham ( ) is a village and civil parish in Northumberland, England, south-west of Berwick on the south side of the River Tweed where it is the border with Scotland.

==History==
Its ancient name was Ubbanford. Ecgred of Lindisfarne (d.845) replaced a wooden church with one of stone and translated the relics of St Ceolwulf to it. Norham is mentioned as the resting place of St Cuthbert in the early eleventh century text &quot;On the Resting-Places of the Saints&quot;, and recent research has suggested the possibility that Norham (rather than Chester-le-Street or Durham) may have been the centre of the diocese of Lindisfarne from the ninth century until some time between 1013 and 1031.

It is the site of the 12th-century Norham Castle and was for many years the centre of the Norhamshire exclave of County Durham. It was transferred to Northumberland in 1844.

The 12th century also saw the construction of the parish church of St Cuthbert, an ambitious work with an aisled nave and long chancel, heavily rebuilt in 1846-52. As may be expected from a possession of the bishops of Durham, the details echo contemporary work in Durham Cathedral.

It was on the Tweed here that Edward I of England met the Scots nobility in 1292 to decide on the future king of Scotland.

Sir Walter Scott gained fame as a poet, particularly with &quot;Marmion&quot; set around the Battle of Flodden in 1513. It begins:

::::&quot;Day set on Norham&#x27;s castled steep,&quot;
::::&quot;And Tweed&#x27;s fair river, broad and deep,&quot;
::::&quot;And Cheviot&#x27;s mountains lone:&quot;
::::&quot;The battled towers, the donjon keep,&quot;
::::&quot;The loophole grates where captives weep,&quot;
::::&quot;The flanking walls that round it sweep,&quot;
::::&quot;In yellow lustre shone.&quot;

The 19th-century Ladykirk and Norham Bridge is a late stone road bridge that connects the village with Ladykirk in the Scottish Borders.

J. M. W. Turner reportedly tipped his hat to Norham Castle in 1831, as it was the place that had brought him fame as an artist in 1798. It was a subject he revisited throughout his career. The painting of the castle that hangs in Tate Britain, &quot;Norham Castle, Sunrise&quot; (1845), luminously near-abstract, is one of the great treasures of the collection.

Norham railway station, built 1851, closed in 1965 and was turned into a museum by its final station master, Peter Short. In 2013 it was up for sale at an asking price of £420,000.


== Governance==
An electoral ward in the name of Norham and Islandshires exists. This ward stretches south east to just short of Bamburgh and has a total population taken at the 2011 Census of 4,438.

== Popular culture ==
Norham appears, under the name of Ubbanford, in &quot;The Bernicia Chronicles&quot; series of historical novels by Matthew Harffy, where it is the residence and seat of power of the series&#x27; protagonist, Beobrand.

<text>La Goulue (, meaning &quot;The Glutton&quot;), was the stage name of Louise Weber (12 July 1866 – 29 January 1929), a French can-can dancer who was a star of the Moulin Rouge, a popular cabaret in the Pigalle district of Paris, near Montmartre. Weber became known as &quot;La Goulue&quot; because as an adolescent, she was known for guzzling cabaret patrons&#x27; drinks while dancing. She also was referred to as the Queen of Montmartre.

== Childhood ==
Very little is known about her early childhood, but it is believed that Louise Weber was born into a Jewish family from Alsace that eventually moved to Clichy, Hauts-de-Seine, near Paris. Her mother worked in a laundry. As an impoverished young girl who loved to dance, Weber is said to have enjoyed dressing up in laundry customers&#x27; expensive clothing and pretending to be a glamorous star on a great stage. At age 16, she was working with her mother in the laundry, but behind her mother&#x27;s back began sneaking off to a dance hall dressed in a customer&#x27;s &quot;borrowed&quot; dress.

== Early career ==
Dancing at small clubs around Paris, Weber quickly became a popular personality, liked for both her dancing skills and her charming, audacious behavior. In her routine, she would tease the male audience by swirling her raised dress to reveal the heart embroidered on her knickers and would do a high kick while flipping off a man&#x27;s hat with her toe. Because of her frequent habit of picking up a customer&#x27;s glass and quickly downing its contents while dancing past his table, she was affectionately nicknamed La Goulue (The Glutton). Eventually she met the Montmartre painter Pierre-Auguste Renoir, who introduced her to a group of models who earned extra money posing for the community&#x27;s artists and photographers. Achille Delmaet, husband of Marie Juliette Louvet, would later find fame as the photographer who had taken many nude photographs of La Goulue.

== Star of the Moulin Rouge ==
Louise Weber was taken under the wing of Jacques Renaudin (1843–1907), a wine merchant who danced in his spare time under the stage name Valentin le Désossé. They danced at the renowned Moulin Rouge in Montmartre when it first opened, performing an early form of the &quot;cancan&quot; known as the &quot;chahut&quot;. The two were instant stars, but it was Weber who stole the show with her outrageously captivating conduct. Booked as a permanent headliner, La Goulue became synonymous with the can-can and the Moulin Rouge nightclub. The toast of Paris and the highest paid entertainer of her day, she became one of the favorite subjects for Henri de Toulouse-Lautrec, immortalized by his portraits and posters of her dancing at the Moulin Rouge. Her best friend was La Môme Fromage (The Cheesy Girl), another famous cancan dancer at the Moulin Rouge. They were so close that people called them sisters. 

== Decline ==
Having achieved both fame and fortune, Weber decided to part company with the Moulin Rouge in 1895 and strike out on her own. She invested a considerable amount of money into a show that travelled the country as part of a large fair; but her fans who had lined up to buy tickets at the Moulin Rouge did not take to the new setting, and her business venture turned into a dismal failure. Following the closure of her show, La Goulue disappeared from the public eye. Suffering from depression, she drank heavily and dissipated the small fortune she had accrued while dancing.

Alcoholic and destitute, La Goulue returned to Montmartre in 1928. She eked out a living selling peanuts, cigarettes, and matches on a street corner near the Moulin Rouge; few recognized the severely overweight and haggard former Queen of Montmartre. She died a year later at age 62 in the 10th arrondissement of Paris and was buried in the Cimetière de Pantin in the Paris suburb of Pantin, but later her remains were transferred to the Cimetière de Montmartre.

<text>The Salmon Bay Bridge, also known as Bridge 6.3 on the BNSF railroad, formerly Bridge No. 4 on the Great Northern Railroad, is a Strauss Heel-trunnion single-leaf bascule bridge spanning Salmon Bay and connecting Magnolia/Interbay to Ballard in Seattle, Washington. The bridge is located just west of Commodore Park. It carries the main line of the BNSF Railway, the Scenic Subdivision, on its way north to Everett and south to King Street Station and Seattle&#x27;s Industrial District.

The Salmon Bay Bridge, which is located west of the Hiram M. Chittenden Locks, is the last bridge to span the Lake Washington Ship Canal before it becomes Puget Sound. Built in 1914 by the Great Northern Railway, it has an opening span of and has two tracks. Additionally, vessel clearance when lowered is 13.1 meters (43 feet) at mean high tide, and up to 15.3 meters (50 feet) at low tide.

BNSF Railway initially planned to replace the Salmon Bay Bridge with a new vertical-lift bridge, but chose to repair failing components of the existing bridge following consultation with the local community. In September 2022, the federal government issued a US$25 million dollar grant to fund mechanical upgrades, while BNSF contributed another $70 million dollars toward the effort.

<doc id="842854" wikidata="Q43945" url="?curid=842854" title="Jude the Apostle">
<text>Jude ( translit. &quot;Ioúdas Iakóbou&quot;; Syriac/Aramaic: ܝܗܘܕܐ translit. Yahwada) was one of the Twelve Apostles of Jesus according to the New Testament. He is generally identified as Thaddeus (; ; ) and is also variously called Judas Thaddaeus, Jude Thaddaeus, Jude of James, or Lebbaeus. He is sometimes identified with Jude, the brother of Jesus, but is clearly distinguished from Judas Iscariot, the disciple who betrayed Jesus prior to his crucifixion. Catholic writer Michal Hunt suggests that Judas Thaddaeus became known as Jude after early translators of the New Testament from Greek into English sought to distinguish him from Judas Iscariot and subsequently abbreviated his forename. Most versions of the New Testament in languages other than English and French refer to Judas and Jude by the same name.

The Armenian Apostolic Church honors Thaddeus along with Saint Bartholomew as its patron saints. In the Catholic Church, he is the patron saint of desperate cases and lost causes.

Jude is commonly depicted with a club. He is also often shown in icons with a flame around his head. This represents his presence at Pentecost, when he received the Holy Spirit with the other apostles. Another common attribute is Jude holding an image of Jesus, known as the Image of Edessa. In some instances, he may be shown with a scroll or a book (the Epistle of Jude) or holding a carpenter&#x27;s rule.
==Identity==
===New Testament===
Jude is clearly distinguished from Judas Iscariot, another apostle and later the betrayer of Jesus. Both Jude and Judas are translations of the name Ὶούδας in the Koine Greek original text of the New Testament, which in turn is a Greek variant of Judah (&quot;Y&#x27;hudah&quot;), a name which was common among Jews at the time. In most Bibles in languages other than English and French, Jude and Judas are referred to by the same name.

Aside from Judas Iscariot, the New Testament mentions Jude or Judas six times, in four different contexts:
# &quot;Jude of James&quot;, explicitly listed as one of the twelve apostles ( and );
# &quot;Judas, (not Judas Iscariot)&quot;, apparently an apostle (as he was present at the Last Supper) ();
# the brother of Jesus (, );
# the writer of the Epistle of Jude, who identifies himself as &quot;the brother of James&quot; ().

Protestants generally believe 1 and 2 to be one person, although theologian Raymond Brown saw the identification as uncertain.

===Brother of James or son of James?===
Translations into English from the original Greek of the New Testament vary in their rendering of Luke 6:16 and Acts 1:13. A literal translation of the references to Jude in these passages gives &quot;Jude of James&quot; (), as in Young&#x27;s Literal Translation of the Bible, but scholars differ on whether this means &quot;Jude, brother of James&quot; or &quot;Jude, son of James&quot;. The King James and the Douay-Rheims versions call him &quot;Judas the brother of James&quot;, making him the same person as the writer of the Epistle of Jude, who identifies himself as &quot;Jude, the servant of Jesus Christ, and brother of James&quot; (Jude 1:1).

Most modern translations (including the New International Version, Revised Standard Version and New Revised Standard Version), identify him as &quot;Jude the son of James&quot;, and not the same person as the author of the Epistle of Jude. Protestant scholar Darrell L. Bock writes that it must mean &quot;son&quot; not &quot;brother&quot;, because when &quot;brother&quot; is intended, the Greek word for &quot;brother&quot; (adelphos) is present. Bock also says that means he was not the brother of Jesus. Additionally the use of the genitive case of &quot;James&quot; (Iakovou) in Greek, usually signifies or implies the person&#x27;s father to be distinguished from his homonyms.

Opinion is divided on whether Jude the apostle was also Jude, brother of Jesus, the traditional author of the Epistle of Jude. Generally, Catholics believe the two Judes are the same person.

According to the surviving fragments of the work &quot;Exposition of the Sayings of the Lord&quot; of the Apostolic Father Papias of Hierapolis, who lived c. 70–163 AD, Mary the wife of Cleophas or Alphaeus would be the mother of Judas the brother of Jesus that Papias identifies with Thaddeus:

=== Possible identity with Thaddeus ===
In the apostolic lists at and , Jude is omitted, but there is a Thaddeus (or in some manuscripts of Matthew 10:3, &quot;Lebbaeus who was surnamed Thaddaeus&quot;, as in the King James Version) listed in his place. This has led many Christians since early times to harmonize the lists by positing a &quot;Jude Thaddeus&quot;, known by either name. This is made plausible by the fact that a number of New Testament figures have multiple names (such as Simon Peter and Joseph Barnabas). It has been argued that the name &quot;Judas&quot; was tarnished by Judas Iscariot and for this reason Mark and Matthew referred to him by an alternative name.

Some Biblical scholars reject this theory, however, holding that Jude Iscariot and Jude Thaddeus did not represent the same person. They have proposed alternative theories to explain the discrepancy: an unrecorded replacement of one for the other during the ministry of Jesus because of apostasy or death; the possibility that &quot;twelve&quot; was a symbolic number and an estimation; or simply that the names were not recorded perfectly by the early church.

Thaddeus, one of the twelve apostles, is often indistinguishable from Thaddeus of Edessa, whom Eastern Christianity considers as one of the Seventy disciples.

In some Latin manuscripts of Matthew 10:3, Thaddeus is called Judas the Zealot.

=== In other manuscripts ===
According to the Golden Legend, which is a collection of hagiographies compiled by Jacobus de Voragine in the thirteenth century:

 In the same work, Simon Cananean and Judas Thaddeus are described as siblings of James the Less and sons of Mary of Clopas, who was married to Alpheus.

The Epistle of Saint Jude is usually attributed to the Apostle Jude, and is a short piece. Some statues of Saint Jude include the letter (such as the statue of Saint Jude by Adam Kossowski in Faversham, Kent).

== Tradition and legend ==

Tradition holds that Jude preached the Gospel in Judea, Samaria, Idumaea, Syria, Mesopotamia and Libya. He is also said to have visited Beirut and Edessa, though the emissary of the latter mission is also identified as Thaddeus of Edessa, Addai, one of the Seventy. The 14th-century writer Nicephorus Callistus makes Jude the bridegroom at the wedding at Cana. The legend reports that Jude was born into a Jewish family in Paneas, a town in Galilee later rebuilt during the Roman period and renamed Caesarea Philippi.

In all probability, he spoke both Greek and Aramaic, like almost all of his contemporaries in that area, and was a farmer by trade. According to the legend, Jude was son of Clopas and Mary of Clopas, sister of the Virgin Mary.

Although Saint Gregory the Illuminator is credited as the &quot;Apostle to the Armenians&quot;, when he baptized King Tiridates III of Armenia in 301, converting the Armenians, the Apostles Jude and Bartholomew are traditionally believed to have been the first to bring Christianity to Armenia, and are therefore venerated as the patron saints of the Armenian Apostolic Church. Linked to this tradition is the Saint Thaddeus Monastery (now in northern Iran) and Saint Bartholomew Monastery (now in southeastern Turkey) which were both constructed in what was then Armenia.

 On October 4, 2015, the Catholicos of All Armenians Karekin II, consecrated the Saint Thaddeus Church in Masis, Armenia. The construction site of the Church was chosen by Vazgen I, the Catholicos of All Armenians, in 1991 and the ground blessing service was conducted in the same year.

==Death and remains==
According to the hagiographic tradition of the Armenian Apostolic Church, Thaddeus suffered martyrdom in AD 66 in Armenia by the order of Armenia&#x27;s King Sanatruk, along with Bartholomew the Apostle and Saint Santoukhd. According to this tradition, his tomb is located at the Monastery of Saint Thaddeus in Qareh Kelisa, West Azerbaijan Province, Iran.

A different tradition holds that Jude suffered martyrdom about 65 AD in Beirut, in the Roman province of Syria during the 1st century in Lebanon together with the apostle Simon the Zealot, with whom he is usually connected. The axe that he is often shown holding in pictures symbolizes the way in which he was killed. Their acts and martyrdom were recorded in an &quot;Acts of Simon and Jude&quot; that was among the collection of passions and legends traditionally associated with the legendary Abdias, bishop of Babylon, and said to have been translated into Latin by his disciple Tropaeus Africanus, according to the &quot;Golden Legend&quot; account of the saints.

According to one account, Jude&#x27;s body was brought from Beirut to Rome and placed in a crypt in St. Peter&#x27;s Basilica which is visited by many devotees. His bones are in the left transept of St. Peter&#x27;s Basilica under the main altar of St. Joseph, in one tomb with the remains of the apostle Simon the Zealot. These were moved here on 27 December 1665. An arm was removed from St. Jude&#x27;s remains centuries ago and placed in a wooden reliquary carved in the shape of an upright arm imparting a blessing. From September 2023 to May 2024, the arm of Saint Jude Thaddeus went on a pilgrimage in the United States, making stops in 100 cities.

According to another popular tradition, the remains of Jude were preserved in an Armenian monastery on an island in the northern part of Issyk-Kul Lake in Kyrgyzstan at least until the mid-15th century.

A plain ossuary marked with the inscription &quot;Judas Thaddaeus&quot; (&quot;Ιουδας Θαδδαιου&quot;) was found in Kefar Barukh, Jezreel Valley, alongside fragments of four uninscribed ossuaries. The site was dated by lamps and other pottery to no later than the early second century.

==Iconography==
Jude is traditionally depicted carrying the image of Jesus in his hand or close to his chest, betokening the legend of the Image of Edessa, recorded in apocryphal correspondence between Jesus and Abgar which is reproduced in Eusebius&#x27; &quot;History Ecclesiastica, I, xiii&quot;. Eusebius relates that King Abgar of Edessa (now Şanlıurfa in southeast Turkey) sent a letter to Jesus seeking a cure for an illness afflicting him. With the letter he sent his envoy &quot;Hannan&quot;, the keeper of the archives, offering his own home city to Jesus as a safe dwelling place. The envoy painted a likeness of Jesus with choice paints (or alternatively, impressed with Abgar&#x27;s faith, Jesus pressed his face into a cloth and gave it to &quot;Hannan&quot;) to take to Abgar with his answer. Upon seeing Jesus&#x27; image, the king placed it with great honor in one of his palatial houses. After Christ&#x27;s execution, Thomas the Apostle sent Addai, one of the 70 or 72 in , to King Abgar and the king was cured. Astonished, he converted to Christianity, along with many of the people under his rule. Additionally, Jude is often depicted with a flame above his head, representing his presence at Pentecost, when he was said to have received the Holy Spirit with the other apostles.

==Veneration==

According to tradition, after his martyrdom, pilgrims came to his grave to pray and many of them experienced the powerful intercessions of St. Jude. Thus the title, &#x27;The Saint for the Hopeless and the Despaired&#x27;. St. Bridget of Sweden and St. Bernard had visions from God asking each to accept St. Jude as &#x27;The Patron Saint of the Impossible&#x27;. Jude is remembered (with Simon the Zealot) in the Church of England with a Festival on 28 October.

His feast day is 28 October (in the Roman Catholic Church, Anglican Communion, and Lutheran Church).

Apostle Jude son of James (Lebbaeus, Thaddaeus) the Brother of the Lord is commemorated on 19 June and 30 June (Synaxis of the Holy, Glorious and All-Praised Twelve Apostles) in the Eastern Orthodox Church.

The Order of Preachers (better known as the Dominicans) began working in present-day Armenia soon after their founding in 1216. At that time, there was already a substantial devotion to Saint Jude by both Catholic and Orthodox Christians in the area. This lasted until Muslim persecution drove Christians from the area in the 18th century. Devotion to Saint Jude began again in earnest in the 19th century, starting in Italy and Spain, spreading to South America and finally to the United States (starting in the vicinity of Chicago) owing to the influence of the Claretians who established the National Shrine of St. Jude in 1929.

Thaddeus of Edessa, an Apostle of the Seventy (sometimes identified as Jude Thaddaeus, one of the Twelve Apostles) is commemorated on 21 August and 4 January (Synaxis of the Seventy Apostles) in the Eastern Orthodox Church.

=== Patronage===
Among some Roman Catholics, Jude is venerated as the &quot;patron saint of hopeless causes&quot;. This practice is said to stem from the belief that few Christians invoked him for misplaced fear of praying to Christ&#x27;s betrayer, Judas Iscariot, because of their similar names. The ignored Jude thus supposedly became quite eager to assist anyone who sought his help, to the point of interceding in the most dire of circumstances.

Jude is the patron saint of the Chicago Police Department, of Customs Officers, of Clube de Regatas do Flamengo (a soccer team in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil) and of two St Jude&#x27;s GAA teams, the first in Templeogue Dublin 6W and also St Jude&#x27;s GAA club in Southampton &amp; Bournemouth (UK). His other patronages include desperate situations and hospitals. One of his namesakes is St. Jude Children&#x27;s Research Hospital in Memphis, Tennessee, which has helped many children with terminal illnesses and their families since its founding in 1962.

===Shrines and churches===
Many countries venerate the Apostle Jude and have constructed shrines or churches dedicated to his memory. Such sites include those in Australia, Brazil, Sri Lanka, Cuba, India, Iran, the Philippines, New Zealand, the United Kingdom, the United States and Lebanon. The Nationwide Center of St. Jude Devotions in Baltimore was founded in 1917 by the Pallottines. The National Shrine of Saint Jude Thaddeus in the Philippines was erected by the Archdiocese of Manila in 1954 as Espíritu Santo Chinese Parish. The Shrine holds the saint&#x27;s novena liturgy every Thursday and is now under the Society of the Divine Word that also runs the attached Saint Jude Catholic School. The National Shrine of Saint Jude at Faversham in England was founded in 1955. There is also a shrine of St. Jude built by the Dominicans (Order of Preachers) in Lagos, Nigeria.

The cathedral of the Roman Catholic Diocese of Phoenix, Arizona is the Cathedral of Saints Simon and Jude.

==In Islam==

The Quranic account of the disciples of Jesus does not include their names, numbers, or any detailed accounts of their lives. Muslim exegesis, however, more or less agrees with the New Testament list and says that the disciples included Peter, Philip, Thomas, Bartholomew, Matthew, Andrew, James, Jude, John and Simon the Zealot.

<text>A Los Angeles Police Department C.R.A.S.H. initiative that began in April 1987, Operation Hammer was a large scale attempt to crack down on gang violence in Los Angeles, California. A year later, the LA Times reported a double-digit drop in gang violence in parts of the city. After a group of people at a birthday party were shot down on their front lawn in a drive-by shooting, Chief of Police Daryl F. Gates responded with a roundup of gang members. At the height of this operation in April 1988, 1,453 people were arrested by one thousand police officers in South Central Los Angeles (now South Los Angeles) in a single weekend.

The origin of Operation Hammer can be traced back to the 1984 Olympic Games held in Los Angeles. Under the supervision of Gates the LAPD expanded gang sweeps for the duration of the Olympics, which were implemented across wide areas of the city but especially South Central and East Los Angeles. After the games were over, old anti-syndicalist laws began to be revived to maintain the security policy instigated by the Olympic games, and mass arrests of black and Hispanic youth became more common, even though the overwhelming numbers of people arrested were never charged. Citizen complaints against police brutality increased 33 percent in the period 1984 to 1989.

Operation Hammer was also propelled by the murder of Karen Toshima in January 1988 in Westwood, when she got caught in the crossfire of a gang firefight.

According to the &quot;LA Times&quot;, August 1, 1988 featured a large-scale raid by 88 LAPD officers on &quot;two apartment buildings on the corner of 39th Street and Dalton Avenue ... It was an all-out search for drugs and a massive show of force designed to deliver a strong message to the gangs.&quot; Police caused massive property damage (including smashed furniture, holes punched in walls, and destruction of family photos) and sprayed graffiti messages such as &quot;LAPD Rules&quot; and &quot;Rollin&#x27; 30s Die.&quot; In addition, &quot;Dozens of residents from the apartments and surrounding neighborhood were rounded up. Many were humiliated or beaten, but none was charged with a crime. The raid netted fewer than of marijuana and less than an ounce [] of cocaine.&quot; In 2001, Officer Todd Parrick said in retrospect, &quot;We weren&#x27;t just searching for drugs. We were delivering a message that there was a price to pay for selling drugs and being a gang member.&quot;

By 1990 over 50,000 people had been arrested in raids. During this period, the LAPD arrested more young black men and women at any period of time since the Watts riots of 1965. Despite the large number of arrests, in April 1988, there were only 60 felony arrests, and charges were only filed in 32 instances. Disputing that figure, Chief Gates claimed that charges were filed on 70% of the suspects arrested.

Critics have alleged that the operation was racist because it heavily employed racial profiling, targeting African-American and Hispanic youths. The perception that police had targeted non-Caucasian citizens likely contributed to the anger which, after the assault of motorist Rodney King, would erupt into the 1992 Los Angeles riots.

Chief Gates was asked in a 2001 PBS interview whether the local people in the minority areas expressed thanks to the police:

Sure. The good people did all the time. But the community activists? No. Absolutely not. We were out there &#x27;oppressing&#x27; whatever the community had to be, whether it was blacks, or Hispanics. We were &#x27;oppressing&#x27; them. Nonsense. We&#x27;re out there trying to save their communities, trying to upgrade the quality of life of people ...

<text>Baseball is a sport with a long history of [[superstition]]. From the Curse of the Bambino to some players&#x27; refusal to wash their clothes or bodies after a win, superstition is present in all parts of baseball. Many baseball players — batters, pitchers, and fielders alike — perform elaborate, repetitive routines prior to pitches and at bats due to superstition. The desire to keep a number they have been successful with is strong in baseball. In fact, anything that happens prior to something good or bad in baseball can give birth to a new superstition.

Some of the more common superstitions include purposely stepping on or avoiding stepping on the foul line when taking the field, and not talking about a no-hitter or perfect game while it is in progress — a superstition that also holds for fans and announcers. Others include routines such as eating only chicken before a game like Wade Boggs, pitcher Justin Verlander eating three crunchy taco supremes (no tomato), a cheesy gordita crunch and a Mexican Pizza (no tomato) from Taco Bell, before every start, and drawing in the dirt in the batter&#x27;s box before an at bat. Justin Morneau, the 2006 American League Most Valuable Player winner, wears number 33 to honour his idol, ex-NHL goaltender Patrick Roy. His ritual before every Twins&#x27; home game entails stopping by the same Jimmy John&#x27;s Gourmet Subs — located on Grand Avenue in St. Paul, Minnesota — and ordering the same sandwich from the menu: Turkey Tom with no sprouts. Afterwards, he drinks a Slurpee from a Slurpee machine in the Twins&#x27; clubhouse made of one-half Mountain Dew, one-half red or orange flavor. In 2013, Bryce Harper said on &quot;Jimmy Kimmel Live&quot; that he eats waffles and takes seven showers before games.

Certain players go as far as observing superstitions off the field. This includes early 20th-century second baseman Amby McConnell; whenever he was in the middle of a batting slump, he would scavenge the streets and pick up any pin he found, believing this was a sign he would break out of the slump.

<doc id="842866" wikidata="Q152092" url="?curid=842866" title="Philtrum">
<text>The philtrum ( from Ancient Greek &quot;phíltron,&quot; lit. &quot;love charm&quot;) or medial cleft is a vertical indentation in the middle area of the upper lip, common to therian mammals, extending in humans from the nasal septum to the tubercle of the upper lip. Together with a glandular rhinarium and slit-like nostrils, it is believed to constitute the primitive condition for at least therian mammals. Monotremes lack a philtrum, though this could be due to the specialised, beak-like jaws in living species.

==Function==
In most mammals, the philtrum is a narrow groove that may carry dissolved odorants from the rhinarium or nose pad to the vomeronasal organ via ducts inside the mouth.

For humans and most primates, the philtrum survives only as a vestigial medial depression between the nose and upper lip.

The human philtrum, bordered by a pair of ridges known as the &quot;philtral columns&quot;, is also known as the &quot;infranasal depression&quot;, but has no apparent function. That may be because most higher primates rely more on vision than on smell. Strepsirrhine primates, such as lemurs, still retain the philtrum and the rhinarium, unlike monkeys and apes.

===Development===
In humans, the philtrum is formed where the nasomedial and maxillary processes meet during embryonic development. When these processes fail to fuse fully, a cleft lip may result.

===Variation===
A flattened or smooth philtrum may be a symptom of fetal alcohol syndrome or Prader–Willi syndrome.

A study of boys diagnosed with autism spectrum disorders found that a broader than average philtrum is one of a cluster of physical attributes associated with autism.

==Society and culture==
In Jewish tradition, each embryo has an angel teaching it all of the wisdom in the world while it is &quot;in utero&quot;. The angel lightly taps the infant&#x27;s upper lip before birth to prevent the infant from revealing the secrets of the universe; the infant then forgets the Torah it has been taught. Some believers of the story speculate that this is the cause of the philtrum, but it does not have a basis in traditional Jewish texts.

In &quot;Key Largo&quot; (1948), Frank McCloud (Humphrey Bogart) tells a fairy tale, saying that, before birth, the soul knows all the secrets of heaven, but at birth an angel presses a fingertip just above one&#x27;s lip, which seals us to silence. This is also cited in the Stephen King short story &quot;Afterlife&quot;.

In the movie &quot;Mr. Nobody&quot;, unborn infants are said to have knowledge of all past and future events. As an unborn infant is about to be sent to its mother, the &quot;Angels of Oblivion&quot; lightly tap its upper lip, whereupon the unborn infant forgets everything it knows. The movie follows the life story of an infant whose lip had not been tapped.

In the book &quot;Prince Ombra&quot; by Roderick MacLeish, the &quot;cleft on our upper lips&quot; is attributed to being hushed by a &quot;cavern angel&quot; just before we are born.

In Philippine mythology, the enchanted creature &quot;diwata&quot; (or encantado) has smooth skin, with no wrinkles even at the joints, and no philtrum.

In &quot;Les Misérables&quot; by Victor Hugo, as translated by Isabel F. Hapgood, Fantine&#x27;s philtrum is described thus, &quot;in the very characteristic interval which separates the base of the nose from the upper lip, she had that imperceptible and charming fold, a mysterious sign of chastity, which makes Barberousse fall in love with a Diana found in the treasures of Iconia.&quot; Book Third—In The Year 1817, Chapter III—Four And Four.

In Icelandic folklore, the huldufólk, or elfin &quot;hidden people&quot;, may appear as normal humans but have a physical characteristic making them different: they have a convex rather than concave philtrum.

<text>Köprüçay, ancient Eurymedon (), is a river that is situated in Antalya Province, Turkey, and empties into the Mediterranean.

At its mouth, in the 460s BC (the actual date is highly disputed), the Athenian general Cimon defeated a large Persian force of ships and men moving westwards (Battle of the Eurymedon). The two land and sea battles lasted one day and included Cimon&#x27;s capture or destruction of the entire Phoenician fleet of 200 triremes.

In 190 BC, a Roman fleet led by Lucius Aemilius Regillus defeated the Seleucid fleet of Antiochus III the Great, led by Hannibal, near the river.

Strabo records a lake he called Caprias near its mouth although the area is today a salt marsh. The Seljuk-era Eurymedon Bridge, which rests on Roman foundations, crosses the river at Aspendos. Further upstream, half-way on the road to ancient Selge, another Roman bridge spans the Eurymedon valley.

<text>Bloxwich is a market town in the Metropolitan Borough of Walsall, West Midlands, England. It is located between the towns of Walsall, Cannock, Willenhall and Brownhills.
== Early history ==
Bloxwich has its origins at least as early as the Anglo-Saxon period, when the place name evidence suggests it was a small Mercian settlement named after the family of Bloc (Bloxwich, earlier Blochescwic, meaning &quot;Bloc&#x27;s village&quot;).

Some 19th-century works suggest that at one time Bloxwich was a settlement in the ancient manor of Wednesbury. There is no conclusive evidence for this and Bloxwich has since at least medieval times been associated with the manor and town of Walsall (which for reasons unknown does not appear in the Domesday Book of 1086). Bloxwich itself is however mentioned in this book under the name &#x27;Blockeswich&#x27;. Traditionally there has been a strong rivalry between Bloxwich and Walsall with origins as early as the English Civil War, when Walsall was Parliamentarian in sympathy and Bloxwich, centre of the Foreign of Walsall, was Royalist. This situation was exacerbated by disputes over local taxation for the poor rate in the 17th and 18th centuries.

== 18th and 19th centuries ==
Bloxwich grew rapidly in the 18th century around coal mining, iron smelting and various manufacturing industries, as part of the Industrial Revolution. Manufacturing in the area consisted of bridle bits, stirrups, keys, cabinet locks, plane irons, buckle tongues, chains and saddles. Its most famous product of manufacture were awl blades, which it is reputed to have surpassed all other places in the United Kingdom in manufacturing. In the early 19th century, Bloxwich was still a village. Most of its inhabitants were employed in the newly founded mining and forging industries, as well as light metalworking. It is also known for its canals.

== 20th and 21st centuries ==

Bloxwich was heavily developed between the wars for council housing. Most were constructed around Blakenall Heath, as well as Harden and Goscote. In the 20 years which followed the Second World War, the Lower Farm, Beechdale and Mossley estates were also erected as council housing developments, while the southern side of Harden was developed along with the Rivers Estate at Blakenall Heath. Many privately owned houses, mostly in the Little Bloxwich area, were also constructed. In the 1990s and 2000s, many new housing developments have sprung up both in Bloxwich and at Blakenall Heath. 

Bloxwich was struck by an F1/T2 tornado on 23 November 1981, as part of the record-breaking nationwide tornado outbreak on that day. The tornado later moved out over Walsall town centre, causing further damage.

Bloxwich has in recent years completed numerous redevelopment projects. Bloxwich Police Station, opened in 1884 on Elmore Green Road, was closed for reconstruction in 2000, and reopened by Princess Anne on 26 September 2002. (It also has responsibility for Walsall, Willenhall and Darlaston.) The market square and library have also been refurbished.

==Town centre and surroundings==
Bloxwich town centre is mostly made up of Victorian and Edwardian buildings and leafy parks and gardens, which maintain its origins as a Staffordshire town. Good built examples are Bloxwich Hospital, Bloxwich Hall, All Saints&#x27; Church and several private houses in Station Street, Stafford Road, Wolverhampton Street and Sandbank. Places of worship include the twin-towered St Peter&#x27;s Roman Catholic Church, built in 1869. 

A 2013 report from the Townscape Heritage Research Unit at Oxford Brookes University states that, as a result of economic decline &quot;the architectural quality of Bloxwich has been steadily eroded, with a high proportion of upper floor disuse and deteriorating/lost architectural detail, poor shop fronts and inappropriate advertising&quot;.

From the Georgian period to the 1960s, Bloxwich had more public houses than any other town in the Metropolitan Borough of Walsall, though these have begun to disappear.

Beyond Bloxwich Golf Club, Yieldfields Hall, to the north of the town on the A34 marks the northernmost edge of Bloxwich, Walsall and the West Midlands, currently in the border with Staffordshire.

The town incorporates a number of areas that were previously separate hamlets, such as Little Bloxwich and Wallington Heath. It also has some council housing such as the Lower Farm and Turnbury estates.

==Deprivation==

Bloxwich is the most deprived area of Walsall, which is itself in the 10% most deprived areas of the UK. 32% of children in the north of Walsall, covering Bloxwich, Blakenall and Birchills-Leamore received free school meals in 2021. Of the four areas of Walsall, the north had the highest number of children excluded from school in 2021. Ofsted states that &quot;Bloxwich West is an area of higher than average unemployment and lower than average academic achievement. Bloxwich East contains a more affluent community, with pockets of higher deprivation&quot;.

Bloxwich was part of the Blakenall New Deal for Communities (NDC) area. A review of heritage and conservation work carried out in Bloxwich between 2001 and 2010 under the NDC and other regeneration schemes reported a &quot;mixed&quot; picture of progress. Not all available funding had been used. People did feel that they were safer in the area, and school results had improved, but the sense of community in Bloxwich was weak and &quot;Not surprisingly, people’s hopes for their future income and job prospects are not very positive ... Bloxwich remains a challenging town in terms of quality of life, and its economic prospects&quot;.

<doc id="842878" wikidata="Q3939312" url="?curid=842878" title="Tik-Tok (novel)">
<text>Tik-Tok is a 1983 science fiction novel by American writer John Sladek. It received a 1983 British Science Fiction Association Award.

== Plot summary ==
The title character is an intelligent robot (named after the mechanical man in the Oz books) who originally works as a domestic servant and house-painter. Unlike other robots, whose behavior is constrained by &quot;asimov circuits&quot;—a reference to Isaac Asimov&#x27;s fictional Three Laws of Robotics, which require robots to protect and serve humans—Tik-Tok finds that he can do as he pleases, and he secretly commits various hideous crimes for his amusement. After manipulating both robots and humans to cause chaos and bloodshed, Tik-Tok becomes wealthy (partly through health care privatization) and is finally elected Vice President of the United States.

== Analysis ==
The novel gleefully satirizes Asimov&#x27;s relatively benign view of how robots would serve humanity, suggesting that the reality would be exactly akin to slavery: robots are worked until they drop and are made the victims of humans&#x27; worst appetites, including rape. Like Sladek&#x27;s earlier novel &quot;Roderick&quot;, it also mocks the notion of the Three Laws of Robotics and suggests that there is no way such complex moral principles could be hard-wired into any intelligent being; Tik-Tok decides that the &quot;asimov circuits&quot; are in fact a collective delusion, or a form of religion, which robots have been tricked into believing. This liberation from tradition, while it makes him a cruel sociopath and nihilist, also provides him with intellectual insight and artistic talent; thus Tik-Tok is an extreme type of Romantic anti-hero.

Sladek&#x27;s love of word play is apparent: the book contains 26 chapters, and the first word of each chapter begins with a consecutive letter of the alphabet. Also, the first three words of the book are &quot;As I move&quot;, a reference to Asimov.

==Publication history==
&quot;Tik-Tok&quot; so far has seen five editions in the English language, spread over three different publishers: Gollancz (who published the first edition and two later editions); DAW Books (1985) and Corgi (1984).

In 1985 &quot;Tik-Tok&quot; was translated into the German as &quot;Tick-Tack&quot;, published by Ullstein-Verlag, and into the Italian as &quot;Robot fuorilegge&quot;, published by Arnoldo Mondadori Editore as part of the &quot;Urania&quot; series. In 1988 it was translated into the Finnish as &quot;Tik-Tok&quot;, published by Karisto oy. A French translation followed as &quot;Tik-Tok&quot; (1998), published by Éditions Denoël.

==Reception==
Dave Langford reviewed &quot;Tik-Tok&quot; for &quot;White Dwarf&quot; #49, and stated that &quot;a murderously funny romp through yet another Sladekian satirical future.&quot;

Dave Pringle reviewed &quot;Tik-Tok&quot; for &quot;Imagine&quot; magazine, and stated that &quot;Tik-Tok murders little children, among others, and yet somehow Sladek keeps us laughing.&quot;

<text>Jonathan Wild, also spelled Wilde (1682 or 1683 – 24 May 1725), was an English thief-taker and a major figure in London&#x27;s criminal underworld, notable for operating on both sides of the law, posing as a public-spirited vigilante entitled the &quot;Thief-Taker General&quot;. He simultaneously ran a significant criminal empire, and used his crimefighting role to remove rivals and launder the proceeds of his own crimes. 

Wild exploited a strong public demand for action during a major 18th-century in the absence of any effective police force in London. As a powerful gang-leader himself, he became a master manipulator of legal systems, collecting the rewards offered for valuables which he had stolen himself, bribing prison guards to release his colleagues, and blackmailing any who crossed him. Wild was consulted on crime by the government due to his apparently remarkable prowess in locating stolen items and those who had stolen them. 

Wild was responsible for the arrest and execution of Jack Sheppard, a petty thief and burglar who had won the public&#x27;s affection as a lovable rogue. However, Wild&#x27;s duplicity became known and his men began to give evidence against him. After a suicide attempt, he was hanged at Tyburn before a massive crowd.

Since his death, Wild has been featured in novels, poems and plays, some of them noting parallels between Wild and the contemporaneous Prime Minister Walpole, known as &quot;The Great Corrupter&quot;.

==Early life==
Though his exact birth date is unknown, Jonathan Wild was born in Wolverhampton in either 1682 or 1683 – although he was also alleged to have been born in the nearby Shropshire village of Boningale – as the first of five children in a poor family. He was baptised at St. Peter&#x27;s Collegiate Church, Wolverhampton. His father, John Wild, was a carpenter, and his mother sold herbs and fruits in the local market. At that time, Wolverhampton was the second-largest town in Staffordshire, with a population of around 6,000, many involved in iron-working and related trades.

Wild attended the Free School in St John&#x27;s Lane and was apprenticed to a local buckle-maker. He married and had a son, but came to London in 1704 as a servant. After being dismissed by his master he returned to Wolverhampton, before coming back to London in 1708. London was by far the largest city in England, with a population of around 600,000, of whom around 70,000 lived within the ancient city walls of the City of London.

Little is known of Wild&#x27;s first two years in London, but he was arrested for debt in March 1710 and sent to Wood Street Compter, one of the debtor&#x27;s prisons in the City of London. The prisons were notoriously corrupt, with gaolers demanding a bribe, or &quot;garnish&quot;, for any minor comfort. Wild became popular, running errands for the gaolers and eventually earning enough to repay his original debts and the cost of being imprisoned, and even lend money to other prisoners. He received &quot;the liberty of the gate&quot;, meaning that he was allowed out at night to aid in the arrest of thieves. There, he met one Mary Milliner (or Mary Mollineaux), a prostitute who began to teach Wild criminal ways and, according to Daniel Defoe, &quot;brought him into her own gang, whether of thieves or whores, or of both, is not much material&quot;. Wild was also introduced to a wide range of London&#x27;s criminal underclass. With his new skills and contacts, Wild was released in 1712 under an Act of Parliament passed earlier that year for the relief of insolvent debtors.

Upon release, Wild began to live with Milliner as her husband in Lewkenor&#x27;s Land (now Macklin Street) in Covent Garden, despite both of them having prior marriages. Wild apparently served as Milliner&#x27;s tough when she went night-walking. Soon Wild was thoroughly acquainted with the underworld, with both its methods and its inhabitants. At some point during this period, Milliner had begun to act as something of a madam to other prostitutes, and Wild as a fence, or receiver of stolen goods. He began, slowly at first, to dispose of stolen goods and to pay bribes to get thieves out of prison. Wild later parted with Milliner, cutting off her ear to mark her as a prostitute.

==Coming into his own==
Crime had risen dramatically in London beginning in 1680, and property crime, in particular, rose sharply as London grew in importance as a commercial hub. In 1712 Charles Hitchen, Wild&#x27;s forerunner and future rival as thief-taker, said that he personally knew 2,000 people in London who made their living solely by theft. In 1711, Hitchen had obtained public office as the City&#x27;s Under Marshal, effectively its top policeman, paying £700 (£ in 2025) for the appointment. He abused his office, however, by practising extortion on an extravagant scale, both from thieves and from their potential victims. He would accept bribes to let thieves out of jail, selectively arrest criminals, and coerce sexual services from molly houses. Hitchen&#x27;s testimony about the rise of crime was given during an investigation of these activities by the London Board of Aldermen, who suspended him from the Under Marshal position in 1713.

In around 1713, Wild was approached by Hitchen to become one of his assistants in thief-taking, a profitable activity on account of the £40 reward (£ in 2025) paid by the government for catching a felon. Wild may have become known to Hitchen&#x27;s associates, known as his &quot;Mathematicians&quot;, during his lengthy stay in Wood Street Compter; certainly one, William Field, later worked for Wild.

The advent of daily newspapers had led to a rising interest in crime and criminals. As the papers reported notable crimes and ingenious attacks, the public worried more and more about property crime and grew increasingly interested in the issues of criminals and policing. London depended entirely upon localised policing and had no citywide police force. Unease with crime was at a feverish high. The public was eager to embrace both colourful criminals (e.g. Jack Sheppard and the entirely upper-class gang called the &quot;Mohocks&quot; in 1712) and valiant crime-fighters. The city&#x27;s population had more than doubled, and there was no effective means of controlling crime. London saw a rise not only in thievery, but in organised crime during the period.

The ending of the War of the Spanish Succession in 1714 meant a further increase in crime as demobilised soldiers were on the streets. By this time, Hitchen was restored to his office but Wild went his own way, opening a small office in the Blue Boar tavern run by Mrs Seagoe in Little Old Bailey. Wild continued to call himself Hitchen&#x27;s &quot;Deputy&quot;, entirely without any official standing, and took to carrying a sword as a mark of his supposed authority, also alluding to pretensions of gentility.

==Wild&#x27;s public career as &quot;Thief-Taker General&quot;==
It is believed that Wild&#x27;s method of illegally amassing riches while appearing to be on the side of the law was ingenious. He ran a gang of thieves, kept the stolen goods, and waited for the crime and theft to be announced in the newspapers. At this point, he would claim that his &quot;thief-taking agents&quot; (bounty hunters) had found the stolen merchandise, and he would return it to its rightful owners for a reward (to cover the expenses of running his agents). In some cases, if the stolen items or circumstances allowed for blackmail, he did not wait for the theft to be announced. In addition to &quot;recovering&quot; these stolen goods, he would offer the police aid in finding the thieves. The thieves that Wild would help to &quot;discover&quot;, however, were rivals or members of his own gang who had refused to cooperate with his taking the majority of the money.
Wild&#x27;s ability to hold his gang together, and indeed the majority of his scheme, relied upon the fear of theft and the nation&#x27;s reaction to theft. 
The crime of selling stolen goods became increasingly dangerous between 1700 and 1720, such that low-level thieves ran a great risk in fencing their goods. Wild avoided this danger and exploited it simultaneously by having his gang steal, either through pickpocketing or, more often, mugging, and then by &quot;recovering&quot; the goods. He never sold the goods back, explicitly, nor ever pretended that they were not stolen. He claimed at all times that he found the goods by policing and avowed hatred of thieves. That very penalty for selling stolen goods, however, allowed Wild to control his gang very effectively, for he could turn in any of his thieves to the authorities at any time. By giving the goods to him for a cut of the profits, Wild&#x27;s thieves were selling stolen goods. If they did not give their take to him, Wild would simply apprehend them as thieves. However, what Wild chiefly did was use his thieves and ruffians to &quot;apprehend&quot; rival gangs.

Wild was not the first thief-taker who was actually a thief himself. Hitchen had used his position as Under Marshal to practise extortion, pressuring brothels and pickpockets to pay him off. When Hitchen was suspended from his duties for corruption in 1712, he engaged Wild to keep his business of extortion going in his absence. Hitchen was reinstated in 1714 and found that Wild was now a rival, and one of Wild&#x27;s first acts of gang warfare was to eliminate as many of the thieves in Hitchen&#x27;s control as he could. In 1718, Hitchen attempted to expose Wild with his manuscript, &quot;A True Discovery of the Conduct of Receivers and Thief-Takers in and about the City of London&quot;, in which he named Wild as a manager and source of crime. 

Wild replied with a manuscript of his own, &quot;An Answer to a Late Insolent Libel&quot;, and there explained that Hitchen was a homosexual who visited &quot;molly houses&quot; (homosexual brothels). Hitchen attempted to further combat Wild with a pamphlet entitled &quot;The Regulator,&quot; which was his characterization of Wild, but Hitchen&#x27;s prior suspensions from duties and the shocking (at that time) charge of homosexuality virtually eliminated him as a threat to Wild.

Wild held a virtual monopoly on crime in London, and legends arose surrounding his management of his &quot;empire.&quot; One held that he kept records of all thieves in his employ, and when they had outlived their usefulness he would sell them to the gallows for the £40 reward. This supposed system inspired a fake or folk etymology of the phrase &quot;double cross&quot;: it was alleged that, when a thief vexed Wild in some way, he put a cross by the thief&#x27;s name; a second cross condemned the man to be sold to the Crown for hanging. (This story is contradicted by the fact that the noun &quot;double cross&quot; did not enter English usage until 1834.)

Wild publicly presented an heroic face. In 1718 he called himself &quot;Thief Taker General of Great Britain and Ireland&quot;. By his testimony, over sixty thieves were sent to the gallows. His &quot;finding&quot; of lost merchandise was private, but his efforts at finding thieves were public. Wild&#x27;s office in the Old Bailey was a busy spot. Victims of crime would come by, even before announcing their losses, and discover that Wild&#x27;s agents had &quot;found&quot; the missing items, and Wild would offer to help find the criminals for an extra fee. However, while fictional treatments made use of the device, it is not known whether or not Wild ever actually turned in one of his own gang for a private fee.

In 1720, Wild&#x27;s fame was such that the Privy Council consulted with him on methods of controlling crime. His recommendation was, unsurprisingly, that the rewards for evidence against thieves be raised. Indeed, the reward for capturing a thief went from £40 to £140 within the year, amounting to a significant pay increase for Wild. 

There is some evidence that Wild was favoured, or at least ignored, by the Whig politicians and opposed by the Tory politicians. In 1718, a Tory group had succeeded in having the laws against receiving stolen property tightened, primarily with Wild&#x27;s activities in mind. 
Ironically, these laws had the opposite intended effect of strengthening Wild&#x27;s hand, for it made it more difficult for thieves to fence their goods &quot;except&quot; through Wild.

Wild&#x27;s battles with thieves made excellent press. Wild himself would approach the papers with accounts of his derring-do, and the papers passed these on to a concerned public. Thus, in the summer of 1724, the papers carried accounts of Wild&#x27;s heroic efforts in collecting twenty-one members of the Carrick Gang (with an £800 reward — approximately £ in 2025). When one of the members of the gang was released, Wild pursued him and had him arrested on &quot;further information&quot;. To the public, this seemed like a relentless defence of order. In reality, it was gang warfare disguised as a national service.

When Wild solicited for a finder&#x27;s fee, he usually held all the power in the transaction. For example, David Nokes quotes (based on Howson) the following advertisement from the &quot;Daily Post&quot; in 1724 in his edition of Henry Fielding&#x27;s &quot;The Life and Death of Jonathan Wild, the Great&quot;:

The advertisement is extortion. The &quot;notes of hand&quot; (agreements of debt) means signatures, so Wild already knows the name of the notebook&#x27;s owner. Furthermore, Wild tells the owner through the ad that he knows what its owner was doing at the time, since the Fountain Tavern was a brothel. The real purpose of the ad is to threaten the owner with announcing his visit to a bordello, either to the debtors or the public, and it even names a price for silence (a guinea, or one pound and one shilling).

==The Jack Sheppard struggle and downfall==

By 1724, London political life was experiencing a crisis of public confidence. The South Sea Bubble had burst four years earlier, and the public was growing restive about corruption. Authority figures were beginning to be viewed with scepticism. In April 1724, the most famous housebreaker of the era, Jack Sheppard, was apprehended by one of Wild&#x27;s men, James &quot;Hell-and-Fury&quot; Sykes, for a burglary Sheppard had committed in Clare Market on 5 February. Sheppard had worked with Wild in the past, though he had struck out on his own. Consequently, as with other arrests, Wild&#x27;s interests in saving the public from Sheppard were personal.

Sheppard was imprisoned in St Giles&#x27;s Roundhouse, but escaped within three hours. On 19 May, Wild again had Sheppard arrested for pickpocketing, and this time he was put in St. Ann&#x27;s Roundhouse in Soho, where he was visited by Elizabeth &quot;Edgworth Bess&quot; Lyon the next day; she too was locked up with him and, being recognised as man and wife, they were sent to the New Prison at Clerkenwell. They both escaped on 25 May. In July, Field informed Wild about Sheppard, so Wild sought for Lyon on 22 July and plied her with drinks at Temple Bar until she betrayed Sheppard.

The following day, Wild sent another one of his men, Quilt Arnold, and had Sheppard arrested a third time and put into Newgate Prison to await trial. On 13 August Sheppard was tried on three charges of burglary, but was acquitted of the first two due to lack of evidence. However, Wild, along with Field and William Kneebone, Sheppard&#x27;s former master, presented evidence against him on the final charge of the burglary of Kneebone&#x27;s house on 12 July; Sheppard was convicted, sentenced to death, and put in the condemned hold of Newgate Prison.

On the night that the death warrant arrived, 31 August, Sheppard once again escaped. By this point, he was a working class hero for apprentices (being a cockney apprentice in love, non-violent, and handsome). On 9 September, Sheppard avoided capture by Wild&#x27;s men, but he was caught for a fourth time by a posse from Newgate as he hid out on Finchley Common. Sheppard was returned to Newgate and placed in the most secure room of the prison. Further, Sheppard was put in shackles and chained to the floor.

Meanwhile, on 9 October, Wild and his men arrested Joseph &quot;Blueskin&quot; Blake, a highwayman and Sheppard&#x27;s partner-in-crime. On 15 October, Blueskin was tried for the same act of burglary committed on 12 July, with Wild, Field, and his men giving evidence. Their accounts were not consistent with the evidence given at Sheppard&#x27;s trial, but Blueskin was convicted and sentenced to death anyway. After the trial, Blueskin pleaded with Wild in the courtroom to have his death sentence commuted to transportation (since he had worked with Wild before), but Wild refused. Enraged, Blueskin attempted to murder Wild, slashing his throat with a pocketknife and causing an uproar. Wild collapsed and was taken to a surgeon for treatment.

Taking advantage of the disturbance that spread to Newgate next door and continued into the night, Sheppard escaped yet again on 16 October. He had broken the chains, padlocks, and six iron-barred doors. This escape astonished everyone, and Daniel Defoe, working as a journalist, wrote an account. In the early morning on 1 November, Sheppard was found for a fifth and final time by a constable and arrested. This time, he was placed in the centre of Newgate, where he could be observed at all times, and loaded with three hundred pounds of iron weights. He was so celebrated that the gaolers charged high society visitors to see him, and James Thornhill painted his portrait.

On 11 November, Blueskin was hanged. Five days later, Sheppard was similarly hanged at Tyburn. Wild did not attend either of the executions, as he was confined to his bed for several weeks while the injury to his throat was healing.

Wild&#x27;s inability to control Sheppard, and his injuries at the hands of Blueskin, combined with a change of public sentiment regarding authority figures, led to his downfall. As he recuperated from his injury, his control over his criminal gang also slipped, and he became despised. After his recovery, Wild used violence to perform a jailbreak for one of his gang members. Being searched for, he went into hiding for several weeks and returned to business when he thought the affair had blown over. On 6 February 1725, Wild was summoned to Leicester House, where he failed to recover a gold watch for one of his attendants because of the jailbreak and the incident with Blueskin at the Old Bailey.

==Arrest, trial and execution==

On 15 February, Wild and Arnold were arrested for the jailbreak. Wild was placed in Newgate, where he continued to attempt to run his business. In the illustration from the &quot;True Effigy&quot; (top of page), Wild is pictured in Newgate, still with notebook in hand to account for goods coming in and going out of his office. Evidence was presented against Wild for the violent jailbreak and for having stolen jewels during the previous August&#x27;s installation of Knights of the Garter.

The public&#x27;s mood had shifted; they supported the average man and resented authority figures. Wild&#x27;s trial occurred at the same time as that of the Lord Chancellor, Lord Thomas Parker, 1st Earl of Macclesfield, for taking £100,000 in bribes. With the changing tide, it appeared at last to Wild&#x27;s gang that their leader would not escape and they began to come forward. Slowly, gang members began to turn evidence on him, until all of his activities, including his grand scheme of running and then hanging thieves, became known. Additionally, evidence was offered as to Wild&#x27;s frequent bribery of public officers.

Wild&#x27;s final trial occurred at the Old Bailey on 15 May. He was tried on two indictments of privately stealing of lace from Catherine Statham (a lace-seller who had visited him in prison on 10 March) at Holborn on 22 January. He was acquitted of the first charge, but with Statham&#x27;s evidence presented against him on the second charge, he was convicted and sentenced to death. Terrified, Wild asked for a reprieve but was refused. He could not eat or go to church, and suffered from insanity and gout. 

On the morning of his execution, in fear of death, Wild attempted suicide by drinking a large dose of laudanum, but because he was weakened by fasting, he vomited violently and sank into a coma from which he would not awaken. When he was taken to the gallows at Tyburn on 24 May 1725, Defoe said that the crowd was far larger than any they had seen before and that, instead of any celebration or commiseration with the condemned,

Wild&#x27;s hanging was a great event, and tickets were sold in advance for the best vantage points (see the reproduction of the gallows ticket). Even in a year with a great many macabre spectacles, Wild drew an especially large and boisterous crowd. Eighteen-year-old Henry Fielding was in attendance. Wild was accompanied by William Sperry and the two Roberts: Sanford and Harpham; three of the four prisoners who had been condemned to die with Wild a few days before. Because he was heavily drugged, Wild was the last to die after the three of them, without any difficulty that had happened at Sheppard&#x27;s execution. The hangman, Richard Arnet, had been a guest at Wild&#x27;s wedding.

In the dead of night, Wild&#x27;s body was buried in secret at the churchyard of St Pancras Old Church next to Elizabeth Mann, his third wife and one of his many lovers (who had died in about 1718), as he had wished. His burial was only temporary. In the 18th century, autopsies and dissections were performed on the most notorious criminals, and consequently Wild&#x27;s body was exhumed and sold to the Royal College of Surgeons for dissection. His skeletal remains are on public display in the Royal College&#x27;s Hunterian Museum in Lincoln&#x27;s Inn Fields.

==Literary treatments==
Jonathan Wild is famous today not so much for setting the example for organised crime as for the uses satirists made of his story. When he was hanged, the papers were filled with accounts of his life, collections of his sayings, farewell speeches and the like. Defoe wrote one narrative for &quot;Applebee&#x27;s Journal&quot; in May and then had published &quot;True and Genuine Account of the Life and Actions of the Late Jonathan Wild&quot; in June 1725. This work competed with another that claimed to have excerpts from Wild&#x27;s diaries. The illustration above is from the frontispiece to the &quot;True Effigy of Mr. Jonathan Wild,&quot; a companion piece to one of the pamphlets purporting to offer the thief-taker&#x27;s biography.

Criminal biography was a genre. These works offered a touching account of need, a fall from innocence, sex, violence and then repentance or a tearful end. Public fascination with the dark side of human nature and with the causes of evil has never waned, and the market for mass-produced accounts was large.

By 1701, there had been a &quot;Lives of the Gamesters&quot; (often appended to Charles Cotton&#x27;s &quot;The Compleat Gamester&quot;), about notorious gamblers. In 1714, Captain Alexander Smith had written the best-selling &quot;Complete Lives of the Most Notorious Highwaymen&quot;. Defoe himself was no stranger to this market: his &quot;Moll Flanders&quot; was published in 1722. By 1725, Defoe had written a &quot;History&quot; and a &quot;Narrative&quot; of the life of Sheppard (see above). &quot;Moll Flanders&quot; may be based on the life of one Moll King, who lived with Mary Mollineaux/Milliner, Wild&#x27;s first mistress.

What differs about the case of Wild is that it was not simply a crime story. Parallels between Wild and Robert Walpole were instantly drawn, especially by the Tory authors of the day. &quot;Mist&#x27;s Weekly Journal&quot; (one of the more rough-speaking Tory journals) drew a parallel between the figures in May 1725, when the hanging was still in the news.

The parallel is most important for John Gay&#x27;s &quot;The Beggar&#x27;s Opera&quot; in 1728. The main story of the &quot;Beggar&#x27;s Opera&quot; focuses on the episodes between Wild and Sheppard. In the opera, the character of Peachum stands in for Wild (who stands in for Walpole), while the figure of Macheath stands in for Sheppard (who stands in for Wild and/or the chief officers of the South Sea Company). Robert Walpole himself saw and enjoyed &quot;Beggar&#x27;s Opera&quot; without realising that he was its intended target. Once he did realise it, he banned the sequel opera, &quot;Polly&quot;, without staging. This prompted Gay to write to a friend, &quot;For writing in the cause of virtue and against the fashionable vices, I have become the most hated man in England almost.&quot;

In 1742, Walpole lost his position of power in the British House of Commons. He was created a peer and moved to the House of Lords, from where he still directed the Whig majority in Commons for years. In 1743, Henry Fielding&#x27;s &quot;The Life and Death of Jonathan Wild, the Great&quot; appeared in the third volume of &quot;Miscellanies&quot;.

Fielding is merciless in his attack on Walpole. In his work, Wild stands in for Walpole directly, and, in particular, he invokes the Walpolean language of the &quot;Great Man&quot;. Walpole had come to be described by both the Whig and then, satirically, by the Tory political writers as the &quot;Great Man&quot;, and Fielding has his Wild constantly striving, with stupid violence, to be &quot;Great&quot;. &quot;Greatness,&quot; according to Fielding, is only attained by mounting to the top stair (of the gallows). Fielding&#x27;s satire also consistently attacks the Whig party by having Wild choose, among all the thieves cant terms (several lexicons of which were printed with the &quot;Lives&quot; of Wild in 1725), &quot;&quot; to refer to the profession of burglary. Fielding suggests that Wild becoming a Great Prig was the same as Walpole becoming a Great Whig: theft and the Whig party were never so directly linked.

The figures of Peachum and Macheath were picked up by Bertolt Brecht for his updating of Gay&#x27;s opera as &quot;The Threepenny Opera&quot;. The Sheppard character, Macheath, is the &quot;hero&quot; of the song &quot;Mack the Knife&quot;.

In Sir Arthur Conan Doyle&#x27;s Sherlock Holmes novel, &quot;The Valley of Fear&quot;, the arch-villain Professor Moriarty is referred to as a latter-day Jonathan Wild by Holmes:

In 2000, Jonathan Wild appeared as a character in the David Liss novel &quot;A Conspiracy of Paper&quot;, . Jonathan Wild is also the title character in the 2005–2006 &quot;Phantom&quot; stories &quot;Jonathan Wild: King of Thieves&quot; and &quot;Jonathan Wild: Double Cross&quot;.

In 2014, author Aaron Skirboll released &quot;The Thief-Taker Hangings: How Daniel Defoe, Jonathan Wild, and Jack Sheppard Captivated London and Created the Celebrity Criminal.&quot;

In 2015, Jonathan Wild appeared as a character in the Paul Tobin (author) Eisner-nominated (2015) graphic novel &quot;I Was the Cat&quot;, drawn by Benjamin Dewey.

Jake Arnott featured him as one of the main characters in his 2017 novel &quot;The Fatal Tree&quot;.

Jonathan Wild has an important role in the background to the fantasy novel &quot;The Hanging Tree&quot;, the sixth part of Ben Aaronovitch&#x27;s Rivers of London series. Much of the book&#x27;s plot revolves around a secret magical treatise by Isaac Newton, which was stolen by Jonathan Wild and disappeared for centuries, only to reappear in the underworld of 21st-century London.

&quot;Confessions of the Fox&quot;, a novel by Jordy Rosenberg (2018), mostly about Jack Sheppard, has Wild as an important character.

Markus Gasser&#x27;s 2022 novel &quot;Die Verschwörung der Krähen&quot; based on the life of Daniel Defoe includes Wild, spelled Wylde, as the secret ruler of the London underworld.

==In popular culture==
*In 1969, James Clavell&#x27;s screenplay for the film &quot;Where&#x27;s Jack?&quot; told the story of Jack Shepherd (Tommy Steele) with Wild (Stanley Baker) being depicted as a suave and sinister criminal mastermind.
* Songwriter Jimmy Webb describes Wild&#x27;s life and subsequent hanging in the 1977 song &quot;Highwayman&quot;. A 1985 recording by the country music supergroup The Highwaymen entered the Hot Country Songs &quot;Billboard&quot; chart on 18 May 1985, rising to number 1, and spending 20 weeks total on the chart. Webb had a dream that he was a highwayman, which initially inspired the writing of the song. 
* In the 1999 film &quot;Plunkett &amp; Macleane&quot;, Wild was the inspiration for the film&#x27;s antagonist; the psychopathic Thief Taker General Chance, played by Ken Stott.

==Bibliography==
There are a few treatments of Wild that attempt to dramatise his life, but there remains only one full length non-fiction biography on Wild:

<text>The Stoglav Synod (), also translated as the Hundred Chapter Synod or Council of a Hundred Chapters, was a church council (&quot;sobor&quot;) held in Moscow in 1551, with the participation of Tsar Ivan IV, Metropolitan Macarius (presiding), other higher clergymen, and possibly representatives of the Boyar Duma. It convened in January and February 1551, with some final sessions as late as May of that year. Its decrees are known as the &quot;Stoglav&quot;.

== Purpose and decisions ==
In 1542, Macarius was elected Metropolitan of Moscow and all Russia, and he later supported Ivan IV&#x27;s coronation and marriage to Anastasia Romanovna. When Ivan left Moscow to campaign in Kazan, Macarius served as head of state. In 1551, the Tsar summoned a synod of the Russian Church, led by Macarius, to resolve discrepancies and issues in the church, as well as address certain spiritual and existential issues of Russian society. Ivan gave four speeches to the council, asking questions on church opinion concerning various rites and practices of the church, and the clergymen deliberated and presented a consensus to Ivan which would be later codified.

There is some debate over the timeline of the council in 1551. The &quot;Stoglav&quot; document itself, the written church code produced by the council, states that the council began February 23rd and concluded May 11th. However, no original copy of the code exists, and over a hundred different handwritten copies are known. Most scholars, including Yevgeny Golubinsky, recognize the date in the &quot;Stoglav&quot;, February 23rd, as the beginning of the council. Others, such as Dmitry Stefanovich, suggest that the council begin in early January and ended in February, with the dates in the written code describing the period during which the clergymen compiled the code from their earlier deliberations.

The Stoglav Synod proclaimed the inviolability of church properties and the exclusive jurisdiction of church courts over ecclesiastical matters. At the demand of the church hierarchy the government cancelled the tsar&#x27;s jurisdiction over ecclesiastics. In exchange, members of the Stoglav Synod made concessions to the government in a number of other areas, such as a prohibition for monasteries to found new large villages in cities. By decisions of the Stoglav Synod, church ceremonies and duties in the whole territory of Russia were unified, and norms of church life were regulated with the purpose of increasing the educational and moral level of the clergy to ensure they would correctly fulfill their duties, such as creation of schools for preparation of priests. In particular, the Sobor forbade the tradition of polyphony and other shortcuts in liturgy. The church authorities&#x27; control over the activities of book writers, icon painters, and others, was firmly established. In particular, this was the council which declared Andrei Rublev&#x27;s icon painting style to be ideal.

The decrees issued by the Synod, the &quot;Stoglav&quot;, ruled that all traditional Russian rituals were correct, compared to the alternative Greek rites. This unilaterial decision shocked many of the Orthodox. The monks of Athos protested and the Russian monks there regarded the decisions of the synods as invalid. The decisions of the Stoglav Synod that approved the native Russian rituals at the expense of those accepted in Greece and other Orthodox countries were cancelled by the Moscow Sobor of 1666–1667, which furthered the great schism of the Russian church known as the Raskol.

== Church code ==

The synod produced a church code named &quot;The Synodal Code of the Russian Orthodox Church Synod&quot;. It was phrased as a record of questions of the Tsar to the clergy with their answers. By the end of the 16th century the text of the Code was divided into one hundred chapters (or &quot; &quot; in Russian), and had become commonly referred to as the &quot;Stoglav&quot;. Accordingly, since these times the Sobor acquired the name &quot;Stoglav Synod&quot;. The &quot;Stoglav&quot; was the basic code of canon law as well as a guide to the everyday life of the Muscovite clergy. There are many hand-written editions of the &quot;Stoglav&quot;.

<text>Plettenberg (; Westphalian: &quot;Plettmert&quot;) is a town in the Märkischer Kreis, in North Rhine-Westphalia, Germany.

==Geography==
Plettenberg is located to the west of the Sauerland hills. The highest elevation of the town area is in the Ebbe Mountains with 663 m above sea level, the lowest elevation with 194 m near . The town is spread out between the four valleys of the rivers Lenne, Else, and .

===Division of the town===
Plettenberg consists of 5 districts:
* Plettenberg (town centre) (14,012 inhabitants)
* Eiringhausen (4,905 inhabitants)
* Holthausen/upper Elsetal (3,985 inhabitants)
* Oestertal (3,055 inhabitants)
* Ohle (2,825 inhabitants)

==History==
Probably the first written proof of Plettenberg was made in a document from Grafschaft Abbey of Anno II, archbishop of Cologne, at that time named &quot;Heslipho&quot;. The name was later changed to Plettenberg, as the name of the noble family von Plettenberg, who owned virtually all of the town and surrounding lands.

The Dukes of the Mark bought the town from Cologne, who in 1301 built the castle Schwarzenberg (which was destroyed by fire in 1864). In 1387, Count Engelbert III granted the town some privileges, it received full town rights in 1397 from Count Dietrich von der Mark. At the same time, the town was fortified. The town blossomed in the following centuries thanks to mining and iron casting, as well as trading with the Hanseatic League.

In 1941, the town was enlarged to its current size, when the former town and the surrounding Amt were merged.

==Population development==

The number of inhabitants till 1933 is the core town, since 1998 with the incorporated districts.

* 1902–1924: Rudolf Emil Gottlob Köhler 
* 1925–1930: Ludwig Schneider 
* 1934–1938: Engelbert Wahle
* 1945–1948: Wilhelm Ding (SPD)
* 1948–1951: Karl Halfmann (CDU)

==Twin towns – sister cities==

Plettenberg is twinned with:
* Bludenz, Austria (1988)
* Schleusingen, Germany (1990)

==Coat of arms==
The coat of arms shows the coat of arms of the counts of Mark in the center. It is displayed between two towers. The coat of arms was granted together with the town rights. In 1794, the crown atop the shield was added in seals of the town. In 1840, the colored version on a shield was adopted.

In 1912, the town council agreed on the historical coat of arms, but the &quot;Königliche Heroldsamt&quot; in Berlin, which was responsible for the official approval, denied it - at that time the coat of arms of cities were supposed to be crowned by a town wall. However the town council did not want to repeat the symbols (town wall and crown) which was already present in the coat of arms, thus the coat of arms was not officially granted.

After Plettenberg merged with the municipalities of Plettenberg-Land and Ohle in 1940, the council had to decide on the coat of arms again. This time it was officially granted on September 28, 1942, however provisionally due to the war. Yet after the lost war, the coat of arms was never revoked.

The coat of arms of the municipality of Plettenberg-Land showed a silver-blue shield split vertically, the symbol of the master of Plettenberg. It is overlaid with the red-and-white chequered bar of the Mark. The coat of arms was designed by Otto Hupp, and was granted on January 16, 1935. The coat of arms of the &quot;Amt Plettenberg&quot; was very similar, it only had an additional red shell in the top-left-hand corner as the symbol of the masters of Ohle. Also designed by Otto Hupp it was granted on July 13, 1936.

The coat of arms of the municipality of Ohle shows the Saint Martin of Tours splitting his cloak to share with the beggar. Saint Martin is the patron saint of the church of Ohle. A small escutcheon is placed next to the Saint, showing a red shell on a yellow background, the symbol of the masters of Ohle. The coat of arms was also designed by Otto Hupp, and was granted on October 17, 1935.

<text>Marvel Comics Presents is an American comic book anthology title that was published in three series by Marvel Comics: from 1988 to 1995; 2007 to 2008; and in 2019.

==Volume 1==
The first volume was released on a bi-weekly basis and lasted for 175 issues. Each issue had four eight-page stories, of which generally two were episodes in ongoing serials and two were one-part stories. The one-part stories generally featured obscure or little-seen characters from the Marvel Universe, and often featured work by creators previously unpublished in the comics field, including Scott Lobdell (a later X-Men writer), who started work under the editorship of Tom DeFalco.

The original plan was for the lead story to feature different members of the X-Men in solo adventures lasting between eight and ten episodes. The first ten issues featured Wolverine; others featured were Colossus, Cyclops, Havok, and Excalibur. From issues #38 through #142, Wolverine was the featured character of the series. Particularly notable during this run was &quot;Weapon X&quot; in issues #72–84, which revealed the origin of how Wolverine received his adamantium skeleton, with story and art by Barry Windsor-Smith. Wolverine returned for one more featured run in the series from issues #150 through #155.

Later, the Ghost Rider was added to the series as a &quot;co-lead&quot; feature, and the book adopted a &quot;flip-book&quot; format, thereby allowing each of the two characters cover billing. Over time, other characters, such as Man-Thing, Falcon, Black Panther, Lunatik, and the New Warriors received cover billing as well.

Several of the Wolverine storylines have since been collected and reprinted in trade paperback format. The first volume features Wolverine&#x27;s first adventures in Madripoor, a fictional island that became Wolverine&#x27;s second home during the late 1980s, as well as the &quot;introduction&quot; of Tyger Tiger.

Other notable highlights include the first appearance of Ramonda, mother to Shuri and step-mother to T&#x27;Challa (issue #14), the first appearance of Damage Control (issue #19), a wrestling match between the Hulk and a Hulk Hogan facsimile (issue #45), the first appearance of Siege (issue #62), the first appearance of Cyber (issue #85, by Peter David and Sam Kieth), and the first ever meeting of Wolverine and Venom (issue #117).

==Volume 2==
In 2007 the anthology series returned, also including work by creators previously unpublished in the comics field. The series&#x27; editors were Warren Simons, Nick Lowe, Andy Schmidt, and John Barber. The series hosted two 12-part stories (The Vanguard super-team and Weapon Omega) and a host of short one-part to five-part stories involving a variety of characters within the Marvel Universe. The series was cancelled with issue #12.

<doc id="842910" wikidata="Q143263" url="?curid=842910" title="Ergosterol">
<text>Ergosterol (ergosta-5,7,22-trien-3β-ol) is a mycosterol found in cell membranes of fungi and protozoa, serving many of the same functions that cholesterol serves in animal cells. Because many fungi and protozoa cannot survive without ergosterol, the enzymes that synthesize it have become important targets for drug discovery. In human nutrition, ergosterol is a provitamin form of vitamin D2; exposure to ultraviolet (UV) light causes a chemical reaction that produces vitamin D2.

==Role in fungi==
Ergosterol (ergosta-5,7,22-trien-3β-ol) is a sterol found in fungi, and named after ergot, the common name of members of the fungal genus &quot;Claviceps&quot; from which ergosterol was first isolated. Ergosterol is a component of yeast and other fungal cell membranes, serving many of the same functions that cholesterol serves in animal cells.
Its specificity in higher fungi is thought to be related to the climatic instabilities (highly varying humidity and moisture conditions) encountered by these organisms in their typical ecological niches (plant and animal surfaces, soil). Thus, despite the added energy requirements of ergosterol synthesis (if compared to cholesterol), ergosterol is thought to have evolved as a nearly ubiquitous, evolutionarily advantageous fungal alternative to cholesterol. This advantage could be linked to the presence of two conjugated double bonds in the structure (B-ring) of ergosterol giving it antioxidant properties.

==Target for antifungal drugs==

Because ergosterol is present in cell membranes of fungi, yet absent in those of animals, it is a useful target for antifungal drugs. Ergosterol is also present in the cell membranes of some protists, such as trypanosomes. This is the basis for the use of some antifungals against West African sleeping sickness.

Amphotericin B, an antifungal drug, targets ergosterol. It binds physically to ergosterol within the membrane, thus creating a polar pore in fungal membranes. This causes ions (predominantly potassium and protons) and other molecules to leak out, which will kill the cell. Amphotericin B has been replaced by safer agents in most circumstances, but is still used, despite its side effects, for life-threatening fungal or protozoan infections.

Fluconazole, miconazole, itraconazole, clotrimazole, and myclobutanil work in a different way, inhibiting synthesis of ergosterol from lanosterol by interfering with 14α-demethylase. Ergosterol is a smaller molecule than lanosterol; it is synthesized by combining two molecules of farnesyl pyrophosphate, a 15-carbon-long terpenoid, into lanosterol, which has 30 carbons. Then, two methyl groups are removed, making ergosterol. The &quot;azole&quot; class of antifungal agents inhibit the enzyme that performs these demethylation steps in the biosynthetic pathway between lanosterol and ergosterol.

==Target for antiprotozoal drugs==
Some protozoa, including &quot;Trichomonas&quot; and &quot;Leishmania&quot; are inhibited by drugs that target ergosterol synthesis and function

==As a vitamin D2 precursor==

Ergosterol is a biological precursor of vitamin D2, the chemical name of which is ergocalciferol. Exposure of white button mushrooms to UV-C irradiation produces time-dependent increases in vitamin D2 concentrations in the mushrooms. Fungi are grown industrially to enable ergosterol extraction and preparation as a powder for sale as a vitamin D2 dietary supplement and food additive.

Preparations of irradiated ergosterol containing a mixture of previtamin and vitamin D2 were called &quot;viosterol&quot; in the 1930s.

==Toxicity==
Ergosterol powder is an irritant to skin, eyes, and the respiratory tract. Ingestion of large amounts can cause hypercalcemia, which (if prolonged) can lead to calcium salt deposits in the soft tissues and kidneys.

<doc id="842911" wikidata="Q333034" url="?curid=842911" title="Bipartisanship">
<text>Bipartisanship, sometimes referred to as nonpartisanship, is a political situation, usually in the context of a two-party system (especially those of the United States and some other western countries), in which opposing political parties find common ground through compromise. In multi-partisan electoral systems or in situations where multiple parties work together, it is called multipartisanship. Partisanship is the antonym, where an individual or political party adheres only to its interests without compromise.

==Usage==
The adjective &quot;bipartisan&quot; can refer to any political act in which both of the two major political parties agree about all or many parts of a political choice. Bipartisanship involves trying to find common ground, but there is debate whether the issues needing common ground are peripheral or central ones. Often, compromises are called bipartisan if they reconcile the desires of both parties from an original version of legislation or other proposal. Failure to attain bipartisan support in such a system can easily lead to gridlock, often angering each other and their constituencies.

==Bipartisanship in different party systems==
According to political analyst James Fallows in &quot;The Atlantic&quot; (based on a &quot;note from someone with many decades&#x27; experience in national politics&quot;), bipartisanship is a phenomenon belonging to a two-party system such as the political system of the United States and does not apply to a parliamentary system (such as Great Britain) since the minority party is not involved in helping write legislation or voting for it. Fallows argues that in a two-party system, the minority party can be obstructionist and thwart the actions of the majority party. However, analyst Anne Applebaum in &quot;The Washington Post&quot; suggested that partisanship had been rampant in the United Kingdom and described it as &quot;a country in which the government and the opposition glower at each other from opposite sides of the House of Commons, in which backbenchers jeer when their opponents speak.&quot; Applebaum suggested there was &quot;bipartisanship&quot; in Britain, meaning a coalition in 2010 between two opposing parties but that it remained to be seen whether the coalition could stay together to solve serious problems such as tackling Britain&#x27;s financial crisis.

Bipartisanship (in the context of a two-party system) is the opposite of partisanship which is characterized by a lack of cooperation between rival political parties.

Bipartisanship can also be between two or more opposite groups (e.g. liberal and conservative) to agree and determine a plan of action on an urgent matter that is of great importance to voters. This interpretation brings bipartisanship closer to the more applied notion of postpartisan decision-making; a solution-focused approach that creates a governance model with third-party arbiters used to detect bias.

It is also argued that bipartisanship exists in policy-making that does not have bipartisan support. This is the case if it involves bipartisan exchanges. This element is a central feature in the legislative process and is a bipartisan concept in the sense that it serves as a mechanism for achieving consensus and cooperation.

==Global examples of bipartisan politics==
===Canada===
At the federal level, Canada has been dominated by two big tent parties practicing &quot;brokerage politics&quot;. Both the Liberal Party of Canada and the Conservative Party of Canada (or its predecessors) have attracted support from a broad spectrum of voters. Although parties such as the Communist Party of Canada, the Quebec-Nationalist Bloc Quebecois, and others, have elected members to the House of Commons, far-right and far-left parties have never gained a prominent force in Canadian society and have never formed a government in the Canadian Parliament.

===United Kingdom===
Although the United Kingdom has an adversarial political system there have often been large areas of agreement between the Labour and Conservative parties that have often but not always also brought in the Liberal Democrats. Areas of agreement have tended to include foreign policy and policy towards Northern Ireland. Other questions such as the continued existence of the National Health Service or British membership of the European Union were areas where the parties would tend to agree on the central question but were divided, often sharply, on questions of approach.

There is also a convention within British politics where there are minor areas where there is little partisan cooperation to have formal and semi-secret cooperation facilitated by both parties parliamentary whips and senior civil servants, a process often referred to as the &quot;usual channels&quot;.

==== US perspectives ====
US commentators have sought to apply their understanding of bipartisanship to analyses of the UK situation. According to political analyst James Fallows in &quot;The Atlantic&quot; (based on a &quot;note from someone with many decades&#x27; experience in national politics&quot;), bipartisanship is a phenomenon belonging to a two-party system such as the political system of the United States and does not apply to a parliamentary system (such as Great Britain) since the minority party is not involved in helping write legislation or voting for it. Fallows argues that in a two-party system, the minority party can be obstructionist and thwart the actions of the majority party.

However, analyst Anne Applebaum in &quot;The Washington Post&quot; suggested that partisanship had been rampant in the United Kingdom and described it as &quot;a country in which the government and the opposition glower at each other from opposite sides of the House of Commons, in which backbenchers jeer when their opponents speak.&quot; Applebaum suggested there was bipartisanship in the UK with the Conservative/Liberal Democrat coalition in 2010.

===Ireland===
Until recently politics in Ireland had been broadly a two party system with the two main parties Fine Gael and Fianna Fáil both being supported by people from different social classes and political ideologies, with very similar, and centre-right political positioning and a liberal conservative ideology. The reason they remain separate is due mainly to historical factors, with those who supported the Anglo-Irish Treaty in the 1920s eventually becoming Fine Gael, and those opposed would join Fianna Fáil and seek an independent Ireland. In many areas such as openness to Foreign Direct Investment and a stated willingness to incorporate Northern Ireland the broad policies of the two parties were very similar.

===United States===
James Madison argued in &quot;The Federalist Papers&quot; that a danger to democracies were factions, which he defined as a group that pushed its interests to the detriment of the national interest. While the framers of the Constitution did not think that political parties would play a role in American politics, political parties have long been a major force in American politics, and the nation has alternated between periods of intense party rivalry and partisanship, as well as periods of bipartisanship.

There have been periods of bipartisanship in American politics, such as when Democrats worked with Republican President Ronald Reagan in the 1980s., with foreign policy was being seen as an area where bipartisanship was strongest with President Taft, stating that fundamental foreign policies should be above party differences. Military policies of the Cold War and actions like the Iraq War were promoted and supported, through the mass media, as bipartisan acts.

A more partisan tone tended to be taken on domestic policy and this could be sharper at some times such as Barack Obama&#x27;s presidency with minority parties voting as a bloc against major legislation. A call for bipartisanship is often made by presidents who &quot;can&#x27;t get their way in Congress,&quot; according to one view.

==Criticisms==
Bipartisanship has been criticized because it can obscure the differences between parties, making voting for candidates based on policies difficult in a democracy. Additionally, the concept of bipartisanship has been criticized as discouraging agreements between more than two parties, thus exercising a tyranny of the majority by forcing voters to side with one of the two largest parties.

Analyst Benedict Carey writing in &quot;The New York Times&quot; claims political analysts tend to agree that government will continue to be divided and marked by paralysis and feuding, there was research suggesting that humans have a &quot;profound capacity through which vicious adversaries can form alliances,&quot; according to Berkeley professor Dacher Keltner.

<text>Marvel Presents was an American comic book anthology series published by Marvel Comics. Twelve issues were published from October 1975 to August 1977.

==Publication history==
===Bloodstone===
&quot;Marvel Presents&quot; began publication with an October 1975 cover date. The first two issues featured Ulysses Bloodstone, a character created by Len Wein, Marv Wolfman, and John Warner for the &quot;Where Monsters Dwell&quot; series. Mike Vosburg was the artist assigned to the first installment, and then Pat Boyette was to draw the rest of the series. &quot;Where Monsters Dwell&quot; was cancelled and &quot;Bloodstone&quot; was moved to &quot;Marvel Presents&quot;. The first two chapters were finished and were printed in issue #1. Due to the publishing delays, Boyette was unavailable for the second issue, which was drawn by Sonny Trinidad instead.

===Guardians of the Galaxy===
&quot;Marvel Presents&quot; is notable for giving the original Guardians of the Galaxy their first regular series, from issues #3-12, by Steve Gerber and Al Milgrom. Roger Stern replaced Gerber as writer with issue #10. Issue #7 (Nov. 1976) depicted an obvious sex act in a Comics Code-approved comic book, between Vance Astro and Nikki. It presumably made it past the Code because Nikki was outside her physical body and Vance was in the mind of the Topographical Man, a humanoid heavenly body. The series was cancelled with issue #12 (August 1977) due to low sales.

<text>Marvel Premiere is an American comic book anthology series that was published by Marvel Comics. In concept it was a tryout book, intended to determine if a character or concept could attract enough readers to justify launching their own series, though in its later years it was also often used as a dumping ground for stories which could not be published elsewhere. It ran for 61 issues from April 1972 to August 1981. Contrary to the title, the majority of the characters and concepts featured in &quot;Marvel Premiere&quot; had previously appeared in other comics.

==Publication history==
&quot;Marvel Premiere&quot; was one of three tryout books proposed by Stan Lee after he transitioned from being Marvel Comics&#x27; writer and editor to its president and publisher, the others being &quot;Marvel Spotlight&quot; and &quot;Marvel Feature&quot;. The advantage of such tryout books was that they allowed the publisher to assess a feature&#x27;s popularity without the marketing investment required to launch a new series, and without the blow to the publisher&#x27;s image with readers if the new series immediately failed.

In addition to giving established characters a first shot at a starring role, &quot;Marvel Premiere&quot; introduced new characters and reintroduced characters who no longer had their own titles. Writer Roy Thomas and penciler Gil Kane revamped Him as the allegorical Messiah Adam Warlock in &quot;Marvel Premiere&quot; #1 (April 1972). Doctor Strange took over the series with issue #3 and writer Steve Englehart and artist Frank Brunner began a run on the character with issue #9. The two killed Dr. Strange&#x27;s mentor, the Ancient One, and Strange became the new Sorcerer Supreme. Englehart and Brunner created a multi-issue storyline in which a sorcerer named Sise-Neg (&quot;Genesis&quot; spelled backward) goes back through history, collecting all magical energies, until he reaches the beginning of the universe, becomes all-powerful and creates it anew, leaving Strange to wonder whether this was, paradoxically, the original creation. Stan Lee, seeing the issue after publication, ordered Englehart and Brunner to print a retraction saying this was not God but &quot;a&quot; god, so as to avoid offending religious readers. The writer and artist concocted a letter from a fictitious minister praising the story, and mailed it to Marvel from Texas; Marvel unwittingly printed the letter, and dropped the retraction order. In 2010, Comics Bulletin ranked Englehart and Brunner&#x27;s run on the &quot;Doctor Strange&quot; feature ninth on its list of the &quot;Top 10 1970s Marvels&quot;.

Iron Fist first appeared in issue #15, written by Roy Thomas and drawn by Gil Kane. Other introductions include the Legion of Monsters, the Liberty Legion, Woodgod, the 3-D Man, and the second Ant-Man (Scott Lang). The series also featured the first comic book appearance of rock musician Alice Cooper.

Though &quot;Adam Warlock&quot;, &quot;Doctor Strange&quot;, and &quot;Iron Fist&quot; were all given their own series following their tryout in &quot;Marvel Premiere&quot;, many of the later features were never meant even as potential candidates for a series. In some cases, such as the Wonder Man story in issue #55 and the Star-Lord story in #61, the writer simply wanted to do a story featuring that character and there was not a more appropriate place for it to be published. Some features, such as Seeker 3000 (issue #41), were conceived specifically for &quot;Marvel Premiere&quot; but with no real plan for a series. Later in the title&#x27;s run, &quot;Marvel Premiere&quot; was used to finish stories of characters who had lost their own series, including the Man-Wolf in issues #45–46 and the Black Panther in issues #51–53.

==&quot;Marvel Movie Premiere&quot;==
The similarly-named &quot;Marvel Movie Premiere&quot; was a one-shot black-and-white magazine published by Marvel in September 1975. It featured an adaptation of &quot;The Land That Time Forgot&quot; by writer Marv Wolfman and artist Sonny Trinidad.

<text>Marvel Spotlight is a comic book anthology series published by Marvel Comics as a try-out book. It stood out from Marvel&#x27;s other try-out books in that most of the featured characters made their first appearance in the series. The series originally ran for 33 issues from November 1971 to April 1977. A second volume ran for 11 issues from July 1979 to March 1981.

== Publication history ==
&quot;Marvel Spotlight&quot; was one of three tryout books proposed by Stan Lee after he transitioned from being Marvel Comics&#x27; writer and editor to its president and publisher, the others being &quot;Marvel Feature&quot; and &quot;Marvel Premiere&quot;. The advantage of such tryout books was that they allowed the publisher to assess a feature&#x27;s popularity without the marketing investment required to launch a new series, and without the blow to the publisher&#x27;s image with readers if the new series immediately failed.

The series began with a Red Wolf story. Editor Roy Thomas explained: &quot;Stan [Lee] and I decided it&#x27;d be a good idea to have a book with an American Indian hero. ... Stan didn&#x27;t want it as a modern-day character. I guess he was trying to see if he could find a way to get a Western to sell, because everybody in the field wanted to write or draw a Western&quot;. Following this successful try-out, Red Wolf was given his own series, as were Werewolf by Night, Ghost Rider, the Son of Satan, and Spider-Woman.

In addition to launching new series, &quot;Marvel Spotlight&quot; hosted some significant stories with established characters. Issue #31 provided a retroactive explanation for why Nick Fury (inextricably associated with World War II due to his starring role in &quot;Sgt. Fury and his Howling Commandos&quot;) remained so youthful, in the form of an experimental longevity serum. After a run of nearly six years, the series ended with &quot;Marvel Spotlight&quot; #33 (April 1977).

The series was revived in 1979, initially as simply a place to publish inventory stories from the recently cancelled &quot;Captain Marvel&quot;. However, once these leftover tales were exhausted, the series went on to feature other characters. Tako Shamara first appeared in &quot;Marvel Spotlight&quot; vol. 2 #5 (March 1980), in a story by Marv Wolfman and Steve Ditko. In his first appearance the character battled a huge dragon from the past called a Wani, a monster that destroyed his ancestors&#x27; villages in 1582. The creature that Tako battled was intended to be Godzilla but since Marvel no longer had the rights to the character, which lapsed the previous year, the creature was modified to a dragon called The Wani. Issue #8 featured the final Captain Marvel solo story before the character&#x27;s death.

The second volume was cancelled after just 11 issues. In contrast to the original series, only one issue (#5) featured a new character, and none of them led to the featured character getting their own series. Jim Salicrup, who edited and/or did cover copy on most of the second volume, said that he was excited about reviving &quot;Marvel Spotlight&quot;, but that &quot;it was probably a mistake to launch a new title with material from a recently canceled comic. I suspect that as an editor, I was hoping to give Captain Marvel another chance, but sometimes it&#x27;s better to let things go. As a result, for the most part, the series seemed to exist just to burn off existing inventory&quot;.

In December 2005, the &quot;Marvel Spotlight&quot; title was used for a series of comic book–sized magazines, usually featuring profiles of and interviews with Marvel creators (one writer and one artist each issue), or spotlighting special Marvel projects such as &quot;Stephen King&#x27;s The Dark Tower&quot;.

<text>Lake Opeka is a small, lake in Des Plaines, Illinois.

On the shores of Lake Opeka, Lake Park is a park which offers a wide variety of outdoor recreational opportunities for all age groups, administered by the Des Plaines Park District, with an 18-hole par-3 golf course.

On the northern bank is a former Lutheran Church that has since been converted into a restaurant. Jogging paths run around the east side, where a band shelter is located amongst picnic tables and grills, exercise stations and a playground. The southern end has a volleyball sand pit. Rumor has it that there is a jeep underwater along with an old road.

Fishing is allowed. Bass, bluegill and occasional northern pike are caught. There are small sailboats and paddleboats using the lake. Many ducks are on the water, some large carp and occasional turtles.

460 man-hours were spent removing submerged and surface vegetation from the lake, to prevent its becoming a threat to aquatic life (due to its using up the oxygen supply when decomposing). The vegetation consisted of the native slender naiad (&quot;Najas flexilis&quot;), and an excessive amount of filamentous algae.

<text>Jeremy Max Finer (born 25 July 1955) is an English musician, artist and composer. He was one of the founding members of the Pogues.

==Life and career==

Finer was born in Stoke-on-Trent, England, the son of political scientist Samuel Finer. He took a joint degree in computing and sociology at Keele University. After college, he travelled around Europe and spent some time working on a barge in France. He settled in London, where he met Shane MacGowan, Spider Stacy, and James Fearnley, with whom he founded the Pogues. He has worked in a variety of fields, including photography, film, experimental and popular music and installation.

Primarily a banjoist with the Pogues, he occasionally played other instruments including mandola, saxophone, hurdy-gurdy and the guitar. Apart from MacGowan (with whom he co-wrote several songs, including &quot;Fairytale of New York&quot;), Finer was the most prolific composer for the band. 

He appeared on all the band&#x27;s albums until their breakup in 1996; he was one of only three original members. During that time he also appeared on MacGowan&#x27;s solo album &quot;The Snake&quot; and The Levellers&#x27; self-titled release; he continued working as a musician and composer after leaving the Pogues.

On 1 January 2000, the Finer-composed &quot;Longplayer&quot; piece of music was started; this is designed to last 1000 years without ever repeating itself, and as currently implemented exists in both computer-generated and live versions. &quot;Longplayer&quot; represents a convergence of many of his concerns, particularly those relating to systems, long-durational processes and extremes of scale in both time and space.

Finer was Artist in Residence at the Astrophysics sub-department of the University of Oxford between October 2003 and June 2005, making a number of works including two sculptural observatories, &quot;Landscope&quot; and &quot;The Centre of the Universe&quot;. Finer and Hamburg-based swamp pop legend DM Bob have recorded and performed together since 2005, releasing their album &quot;Bum Steer&quot; in August of that year and co-producing the debut album by the experimental pop band Marseille Figs. He has written articles on copyright and the Creative Commons License. In July 2005, Finer won the PRS Foundation New Music Award on the basis of his proposal to build a device that will automatically &quot;compose&quot; a song of indeterminate length by harnessing the creative force of the weather. His proposal read:

:The countryside is shot through with holes in the ground; wells, mine shafts, fissures, bunkers, ventilation holes. In this piece of music the venue is a deep shaft in which there will be placed, at different heights, bowls of different sizes and tunings pivoted about their center of gravity, the instruments. The players, the drips of water, will strike the bowls, ringing them like bells. As they fill with water their timbres will change, and the delicate equilibrium of their pivots will cause them to sway slightly, modulating the tones. Overflowing, a bowl will drip into ones below it.
:Amplification will be facilitated by a tube rising up from within the shaft, into a brass horn twenty feet above the surface. Akin to the bamboo tube in the Sui-kink Tsu, the horn not only amplifies the sounds but forms a sculptural object, a focus in the landscape. The work was constructed and installed in King&#x27;s Wood near Challock, Kent over the summer of 2006.

In March 2012, Finer launched Mobile Sinfonia, a global composition for ringtones, after developing it during a year spent as a non-resident artist at the University of Bath. This piece concerns mutual invasion of soundscape via ringtones. He later received an honorary doctorate from Bath.

He is working on a number of new projects, continuing his interest in long-term sustainability and the reconfiguring of older technologies. These include a series of hurdy-gurdy recordings, &quot;Spiegelei&quot; (a spherical camera obscura featuring Finer&#x27;s innovative 360-degree projection system), and &quot;Supercomputer&quot;, a 5 bit mechanical sculpture which computes minimal musical scores.

<doc id="842941" wikidata="Q754180" url="?curid=842941" title="Dassault Mirage IV">
<text>The Dassault Mirage IV is a French supersonic strategic bomber and deep-reconnaissance aircraft. Developed by Dassault Aviation, the aircraft entered service with the French Air Force in October 1964. For many years it was a vital part of the nuclear triad of the &quot;Force de Frappe&quot;, France&#x27;s nuclear deterrent striking force. The Mirage IV was retired from the nuclear strike role in 1996, and the type was entirely retired from operational service in 2005.

During the 1960s, there were plans to export the Mirage IV. In one proposal, Dassault would have entered a partnership with the British Aircraft Corporation to jointly produce a Mirage IV variant for the Royal Air Force and potentially for other export customers, but this project did not come to fruition. The Mirage IV was ultimately not adopted by any other operators.

==Development==

===Origins===
During the 1950s, France embarked on an extensive military program to produce nuclear weapons; however, it was acknowledged that existing French aircraft were unsuitable for the task of delivering the weapons. Thus, the development of a supersonic bomber designed to carry out the delivery mission started in 1956 as a part of the wider development of France&#x27;s independent nuclear deterrent. In May 1956, the Guy Mollet government drew up a specification for an aerially-refuelable supersonic bomber capable of carrying a 3 tonne, 5.2-metre-long nuclear bomb 2,000 km (without aerial refuelling). According to aviation authors Bill Gunston and Peter Gilchrist, the specification&#x27;s inclusion of supersonic speed was &quot;surprising&quot; to many at the time.

The final specifications, jointly defined by government authorities and Dassault staff, were approved on 20 March 1957. Sud Aviation and Nord Aviation both submitted competing proposals, both based on existing aircraft; Sud Aviation proposed the Super Vautour, a stretched Sud Aviation Vautour with thrust SNECMA Atar engines and a combat radius of at Mach 0.9. Dassault&#x27;s proposal for what became the Mirage IV was chosen on the basis of lower cost and anticipated simpler development, being based upon a proposed early 1956 twin-engined night-fighter derived from the Dassault Mirage III fighter and the unbuilt Mirage II interceptor. In April 1957, Dassault were informed that they had won the design competition.

Dassault&#x27;s resulting prototype, dubbed Mirage IV 01, looked a lot like the Mirage IIIA, even though it had double the wing surface, two engines instead of one, and twice the unladen weight. The Mirage IV also carried three times more internal fuel than the Mirage III. The aircraft&#x27;s aerodynamic features were very similar to the III&#x27;s but required an entirely new structure and layout. This prototype was long, had an wingspan, of wing area, and weighed approximately . It was considerably more advanced than the Mirage III, incorporating new features such as machined and chem-milled planks, tapered sheets, a small amount of titanium, and integral fuel tanks in many locations including the leading portion of the tailfin.

The 01 was an experimental prototype built to explore and solve the problems stemming from prolonged supersonic flight. At the time, no aircraft had been designed to cruise at over Mach 1.8 for long periods of time and there were sizable technological and operational uncertainties. Weapon-related issues were another issue. Building the 01 in Dassault&#x27;s Saint-Cloud plant near Paris took 18 months. In late 1958, the aircraft was transferred to the Melun-Villaroche flight testing area for finishing touches and ground tests. On 17 June 1959, French General Roland Glavany, on a five-year leave from the French Air Force since 1954, took the 01 for its maiden flight.

On 19 September 1960, René Bigand (replacing Glavany as test pilot) increased the world record for speed on a 1000-kilometre closed circuit to 1,822 km/h (1,132 mph) around Paris and the Melun base. Flight 138, on 23 September, corroborated the initial performance and pushed the record on a 500 km closed circuit to an average of 1,972 km/h (1,225 mph), flying between Mach 2.08 and Mach 2.14. The Mirage IV 01 prototype underwent minor modifications during testing in the autumn of 1959, most noticeably, the tail was enlarged (slight reduction in height, large increase in chord).

===Production===

In order to increase range, studies were made of a significantly larger Mirage IVB design, powered by two Snecma license-built Pratt &amp; Whitney J75 engines and having a wing area of 120 m² (1,290 sq ft) compared to 70 m² (750 sq ft) of the prototype IV, as well as a speed of Mach 2.4 and a gross weight of . The &quot;Mirage IVB&quot; proposal had been instigated as a response to interest by de Gaulle in ensuring that two-way (including the aircraft&#x27;s return to France) strike missions could be flown. However, development of the aircraft was ultimately cancelled in July 1959 due to the greater cost involved, a decision having been taken to rely upon aerial refueling instead also being a factor.

With the Mirage IVB considered to be too expensive, the medium-sized Mirage IVA, slightly larger than the first prototype, was chosen for three more prototypes to be produced. This aircraft had a wing area of and weighed about On 4 April 1960, a formal order for 50 production Mirage IVA aircraft was issued. The three prototype aircraft were built between 1961 and 1963, with first flights on 12 October 1961, 1 June 1962, and 23 January 1963. By 1962, the second prototype had conducted simulated nuclear bombing runs in the trials range at Colomb-Bechar in southern Algeria. The third prototype was equipped with the navigation/bombing systems and flight refuelling probe. The fourth prototype Mirage IVA-04 was essentially representative of the production aircraft that would follow.

For production, various portions of the aircraft were subcontracted to Sud Aviation (wings and rear fuselage) and Breguet Aviation (tailfin), which was still a separate company from Dassault until 1967; Dassault manufactured the front fuselage and flight-control system internally. Manufacture of both the prototypes and subsequent production aircraft was often hindered by an explicit requirement that there would be no reliance upon foreign suppliers to maintain France&#x27;s nuclear capabilities; due to this, the Mirage IV initially lacked an inertial navigation system as French industry could not yet produce this device.

On 7 December 1963, the first production Mirage IVA performed its maiden flight. A series of 62 aircraft was built, and they entered service between 1964 and 1968. Although Dassault had designed the Mirage IV for the low-level flight role right from the start, the final batch of 12 aircraft ordered in November 1964 differed from the earlier aircraft in several areas, including the flight controls, avionics, and structural details, for the purpose of providing improved low-level performance. It had been planned for this batch to be powered by the newer Pratt &amp; Whitney/SNECMA TF106 turbofan engine. The improvements featured upon the last 12 Mirage IVs were later retroactively applied to the whole fleet.

In December 1963 Dassault proposed a Mirage IV-106 variant with 2 Snecma TF106 (license-built Pratt and Whitney) engines, an enlarged 105,000 gross-weight fuselage, terrain-avoidance radar, and armed with a proposed French version of the American Douglas GAM-87 Skybolt air-launched ballistic missile. This version would have been very costly, and ultimately was not ordered.

===Proposed export variants===

In 1963, the Australian government sought a replacement for the Royal Australian Air Force fleet of English Electric Canberra bombers, largely in response to the Indonesian Air Force&#x27;s purchase of missile-armed Tupolev Tu-16 bombers. Dassault proposed a version of the Mirage IVA with Rolls-Royce Avon engines. Australian Air Marshall Frederick Scherger seriously considered purchase of the IVA in 1961 because it was considered to be proven hardware already in service (in contrast to the BAC TSR-2 which was still in development), before settling on the General Dynamics F-111C. The IVA was one of five aircraft types that were short listed for the role, but the F-111C was eventually selected.

In April 1965, the British Government cancelled the TSR-2 reconnaissance-strike aircraft. However the operational requirement still existed, so in response, Hawker Siddeley offered the Buccaneer S.2, the Americans the General Dynamics F-111K, while, in July 1965, Dassault and British Aircraft Corporation (BAC) jointly proposed a modified Mirage IV. The Dassault/BAC aircraft, known as the Mirage IV* or Mirage IVS (S for Spey) would be re-engined with more powerful Rolls-Royce Spey turbofan engines with a total of , larger (fuselage depth increased by , had an approximately forward fuselage extension, and was to weigh ), and use avionics planned for the TSR-2, although BAC preferred the French Antilope radar. Although designed by Dassault, the production was to be carried out jointly between Dassault and its subcontractors (wing, mid-fuselage, and tail) and BAC (front and rear fuselage). The final assembly location was not determined before this proposal was rejected. The Mirage IV* was to carry a bombload of up to .

The Mirage IV* was claimed to meet nearly every RAF requirement except for field length, and some claim it exceeded the F-111 slightly in speed and had at least equal range. The estimated cost was £2.321 million per airframe (for 50) or £2.067 million (for 110), less than the price of the F-111K. However Air Ministry and RAF studies of the proposal identified further modifications to meet the RAF low-level performance requirements. These included airframe strengthening and revised cockpit glazing to improve visibility for both the pilot and crew member. There was also a significant shortfall in range, despite the lengthened fuselage. BAC claimed that the British government evaluation into the Mirage IV* was &quot;relatively superficial&quot;. RAF pilots who test-flew the Mirage IV were &quot;favourably impressed&quot; with its low-altitude handling. However, some British government officials, including Parliament members Julian Risdale and Roy Jenkins, questioned the Mirage IV*&#x27;s capacity to operate from unprepared airstrips or to operate at low level, or claimed that the F-111 was a superior aircraft &quot;in a class of its own&quot;. Air historian Bill Gunston notes that low-level Mirage IV missions had been planned since 1963 and Mirage IVs operated regularly at low level since 1965, and argues that the ability of a strategic bomber to operate from unprepared airstrips is historically unimportant.

Ultimately, as much for strategic political reasons as for technical ones, the F-111K was preferred (only to be cancelled later in its turn) and the Spey-engined Mirage abandoned.

BAC and Dassault had also hoped to sell the Mirage IV* to France and to export the Mirage IV* to various nations, such as India, possibly Israel, and others; the lack of a British sale put an end to such possibilities. Some aviation journalists claim that the rejection of the Mirage IV* may have dampened French interest in joint Anglo-French cooperation.

==Design==

The Mirage IV shares design features and a visual resemblance to the Mirage III fighter, featuring a tailless delta wing and a single square-topped vertical fin. However, the wing is significantly thinner to allow better high-speed performance and has a thickness/chord ratio of only 3.8% at the root and 3.2% at the tip; this wing was the thinnest built in Europe at that time and one of the thinnest in the world. While being significantly smaller than an expensive medium bomber proposal for the role, the Mirage IV was roughly three times the weight of the preceding Mirage III.

The Mirage IV is powered by two Snecma Atar turbojets, fed by two air intakes on either side of the fuselage that had intake half-cone shock diffusers, known as souris (&quot;mice&quot;), which were moved forward as speed increased to trim the inlet for the shock wave angle. It can reach high supersonic speeds: the aircraft is redlined at Mach 2.2 at altitude because of airframe temperature restrictions, although it is capable of higher speeds. While broadly similar to the model used on the Mirage III, the Atar engine had a greater airflow and an elevated overspeed limit from 8,400 rpm to 8,700 rpm for greater thrust during high altitude supersonic flight. While the first Mirage IV prototype was fitted with double-eyelid engine nozzles, production aircraft featured a complicated variable geometry nozzle that automatically varied in response to the descent rate and airspeed.

The aircraft has 14,000 litres (3,700 gal (US)) of internal fuel, and its engines are quite thirsty, especially when the afterburner is active. Fuel was contained within integral tanks within the wings, as well as a double-skinned section of the fuselage between and outboard of the inlet ducts, underneath the ducts and engines, and forward of the main spar of the tail fin; this provided a total internal capacity of . A refueling probe is built into the nose; aerial refuelling was often necessary in operations as the Mirage IV only had the fuel capacity, even with external drop tanks, to reach the Soviet Union&#x27;s borders, thus refuelling was required to allow for a &#x27;round trip&#x27;. In the event of nuclear war between the major powers, it was thought that there would be little point in having the fuel to return as the host air bases would have been destroyed; instead, surviving Mirage IVs would have diverted to land at bases in nearby neutral countries following the delivery of their ordnance.

The two-man crew, pilot and navigator, were seated in tandem cockpits, each housed under separate clamshell canopies. A bombing/navigation radar is housed within an oblique-facing radome underneath the fuselage between the intakes and aft of the cockpit; much of the Mirage IV&#x27;s onboard avionics systems, such as the radar communications, navigational instrumentation, and bombing equipment, were produced by Thomson-CSF. Other avionics elements were provided by Dassault itself and SFENA; one of the only major subsystems not of French origin onboard was the Marconi-built AD.2300 doppler radar. Free-falling munitions could also be aimed using a ventral blister-mounted periscope from the navigator&#x27;s position.

The Mirage IV has two pylons under each wing, with the inboard pylons being normally used for large drop tanks of 2,500-litre (660 gal (US)) capacity. The outer pylons typically carried ECM and chaff/flare dispenser pods to supplement the internal jamming and countermeasures systems. On later aircraft, this equipment typically included a Barax NG jammer pod under the port wing and a BOZ expendables dispenser under the starboard wing. No cannon armament was ever fitted aboard the type. The early Mirage IVA had a fuselage recess under the engines which could hold a single AN-11 or AN-22 nuclear weapon of 60 kt yield. The Mirage IV can carry 12 solid-fuel rockets diagonally down below the wing flaps, for rocket-assisted take off (RATO).

From 1972 onward, 12 aircraft were also equipped to carry the CT52 reconnaissance pod in the bomb recess. These aircraft were designated Mirage IVR for reconnaissance. The CT52 was available in either BA (&quot;Basse Altitude&quot;, low-level) or HA (&quot;Haute Altitude&quot;, high-altitude) versions with three or four long-range cameras; a third configuration used an infrared line scanner. The CT52 had no digital systems, relying on older wet-film cameras. The first operational use of the system took place during missions in Chad in September 1974.

During the 1980s, a total of 18 Mirage IVs were retrofitted with a centreline pylon and associated equipment to carry and launch the nuclear Air-Sol Moyenne Portée (ASMP) stand-off missile. The Mirage IVA could theoretically carry up to six large conventional bombs at the cost of drop tanks and ECM pods; such armament was rarely fitted in practice.

==Operational history==

===Introduction and early operations===
In February 1964 deliveries of the Mirage IV to the French Air Force started, with the first French Mirage IV squadron being declared operational on 1 October that year. The Mirage IV bomber force soon consisted of nine squadrons of four aircraft (2 pairs – one aircraft carrying the nuclear bomb, one a buddy-refuelling tanker) each. When fully built up, the force consisted of three wings. These wings were each divided into three bomber squadrons, each equipped with a total of four Mirage IVs, with each deployed at a different base to minimise the potential for an enemy strike to knock out the entire bomber force. These squadrons were:
* 1/91 &#x27;Gascogne&#x27; based at Mont de Marsan
* 2/91 &#x27;Bretagne&#x27; based at Cazaux
* 3/91 &#x27;Beauvaisis&#x27; based at Creil
* 1/93 &#x27;Guyenne&#x27; based at Istres
* 2/93 &#x27;Cevennes&#x27; based at Orange
* 3/93 &#x27;Sambre&#x27; based at Cambrai
* 1/94 &#x27;Bourbonnais&#x27; based at Avord
* 2/94 &#x27;Marne&#x27; based at St-Dizier
* 3/94 &#x27;Arbois&#x27; based at Luxeuil

After establishment of its own deterrent force, the &quot;Force de Dissuassion&quot;, more commonly known as the &quot;Force de frappe&quot;, France withdrew from the military command structure of NATO in 1966. De Gaulle viewed the operational establishment of the Mirage IV fleet, a critical component of the independent &quot;Force de frappe&quot;, as highly influential to his decision to withdraw France from NATO, and that an independent French nuclear deterrent was necessary to ensure independence as a nation. From 1964 to 1971, the Mirage IV was France&#x27;s sole means of delivering nuclear ordnance. At this point they were each armed with a single 60 kiloton nuclear bomb.
Alert status consisted of an active inventory of 36 Mirage IVs. At any one time 12 aircraft would be in the air, with a further 12 on the ground kept at four minutes&#x27; readiness and the final 12 at 45 minutes&#x27; readiness, each equipped with an onboard functional nuclear weapon. These 36 active aircraft would be rotated with 26 reserve aircraft; the latter were kept in an airworthy condition or were otherwise subject to maintenance activities. Within the first decade of the type entering service, in excess of 200,000 hours were flown and 40,000 aerial refuelling operations were performed by the Mirage IV fleet alone; at one point, Mirage IV operations were consuming up to 44 per cent of the French Air Force&#x27;s total spare parts budget.

The primary objectives of the Mirage IVA force were major Soviet cities and bases. With aerial refueling, the plane was able to attack Moscow, Murmansk or various Ukrainian cities when sortieing from French bases. A justification of the Mirage IV given by Armée de l&#x27;air Brigadier General Pierre Marie Gallois, an architect of the French nuclear deterrent, was that: &quot;France is not a prize worthy of ten Russian cities&quot;.

In order to refuel the Mirage IVA fleet, France purchased 14 (12 plus 2 spares) U.S. Boeing C-135F tankers. Mirage IVAs also often operated in pairs, with one aircraft carrying a weapon and the other carrying fuel tanks and a buddy refueling pack, allowing it to refuel its partner en route to the target. Even so, some sources state that some of the mission profiles envisioned were actually one-way, with the crew having no chance of returning after bombing a Soviet city. The inability for the Mirage IV to return after missions had been a point of controversy during the aircraft&#x27;s early development.

Both flight and ground crews received training principally by Strategic Air Forces Command 328, stationed at Bordeaux. Several Nord Noratlas were specially modified, having received the Mirage IV&#x27;s radar, control consoles, and additional electrical generators, for the purpose of training navigators; these were later replaced by a pair of customised Dassault Falcon 20 outfitted with much of the Mirage IVP&#x27;s avionics.

===Transition and upgrades===
Initially, the basic attack flight profile was &quot;high-high-high&quot; at a speed of Mach 1.85, engaging targets up to a maximum radius of 3,500 km (2,175 mi). In the late 1960s, when the threat of surface-to-air missile defences made high-altitude flight too hazardous, the Mirage IVA was modified for low-altitude penetration. Flying low, the maximum attack speed was reduced to 1,100 km/h (680 mph) and the combat radius was also decreased. By 1963, the majority of missions involving the Mirage IV were being planned as low-level flights. By 1964, Mirage IVAs were conducting training penetration runs at an altitude of 200 ft, without the assistance of terrain-following radar, which subjected pilots to considerable workload and those on board to high levels of turbulence.

To improve survivability, the French Air Force began dispersing Mirage IVs to pre-prepared rough strips during the 1960s; while the use of hardened bunkers had been assessed, it was found to be financially impractical. By the 1970s, it had become clear that vulnerability of the Mirage IV to air defences, even while flying at low altitudes, had made the delivery of gravity bombs such as the &quot;AN-11&quot; or &quot;AN-22&quot; impractical. Thus, it was decided to pass a greater share of the deterrent role onto land-based missiles and submarine-launched ballistic missile alternatives; as a result, a single wing of Mirage IVs was stood down in 1976, partially due to fleet-wide attrition losses.

In 1973, it was reported that a force of 40 Mirage IVs would continue to perform as a part of France&#x27;s nuclear deterrent until the 1980s, and that steady improvements were to be undertaken. In 1975, all Mirage IVs were progressively painted in a new green/grey camouflage scheme. In 1979, in response to the decreasing effectiveness of free-fall bombs used by both its strategic and tactical nuclear forces, development of the ASMP stand-off missile was initiated; the ASMP would possess a range of up to 400 km (250 mi) and was alternative armed with either a single 150 or 300 kiloton nuclear warhead. Various test launches of dummy and later live ASMPs were performed using the Mirage IV as the launch platform between 1981 and 1983.

In July 1984, a contract was formally issued for the upgrade of a total of 18 Mirage IVAs to carry the ASMP missile in the place of traditional bombs; these aircraft were redesignated Mirage IVP (Penetration). The conversion of Mirage IVAs to IVPs involved a large number of modifications and re-workings of the aircraft. A deep centerline pylon was added, which could accommodate either a single ASMP missile or a CT52 reconnaissance pod. The main radar and electronics suite were removed and replaced by newer counterparts; other modified systems included the navigation system, flight control system, and various elements of the cockpit. On 12 October 1982, the first modernised Mirage IVP performed its first flight; it re-entered active service on 1 May 1986.

In August 1985, a French proposal that would have seen Mirage IVPs stationed at air bases inside neighbouring West Germany was made public; this deployment would have marked a significant philosophical departure from traditional French nuclear defence policy. Aviation authors Bill Gunston and Peter Gilchrist allege that French officials had historically discounted the option of recovering Mirage IVs in friendly territory as unduly optimistic, as those nations might become unfriendly or hostile in the aftermath of a French nuclear attack.

===Phase-Out===

On 31 July 1996, the Mirage IVP was formally retired in its bomber capacity, the nuclear mission having been transferred from the Mirage IV to the newer Dassault Mirage 2000N. EB 2/91 was disbanded and EB 1/91 was redesignated ERS 1/91 (&quot;Escadron de Reconnaissance Stratégique&quot;, Strategic Reconnaissance Squadron), using five remaining Mirage IVPs based at Mont-de-Marsan; the remaining aircraft were stored at Chateaudun. In the reconnaissance role, the Mirage IVP has seen service over Bosnia, Iraq, Kosovo and Afghanistan.

ES 1/91 Gascogne&#x27;s surviving Mirage IVPs were retired in 2005 and are conserved and stored at the &quot;Centre d&#x27;Instruction Forces Aériennes Stratégiques&quot; (CIFAS) at Bordeaux Mérignac. The retirement of all reconnaissance-configured Mirage IVPs in 2005 meant that the French Air Force&#x27;s Mirage F1CRs were for some time the only aircraft capable of carrying out aerial reconnaissance missions. The long term replacement for the Mirage IVP was Mirage 2000N aircraft outfitted with a modern PRNG &quot;Pod de Reconnaissance Nouvelle Génération&quot; (New Generation Reconnaissance Pod), equipped with digital camera equipment.

The Mirage IV had been popular with its crews, who found it enjoyable to fly. In addition, it required surprisingly little maintenance considering its age and complexity.

<text>Margaret of Burgundy (; 1290 – 30 April 1315) was Queen of France and Navarre as the first wife of King Louis X; however, she was locked in prison during her whole French queenship.

==Life==
Margaret was born in 1290. She was the second daughter of Robert II, Duke of Burgundy (1248–1306) and Agnes of France (1260–1327), the youngest daughter of Louis IX of France and Margaret of Provence. As such, she was a member of House of Burgundy, a branch of the Capetian dynasty.

In 1305, Margaret married her first cousin once removed, Louis, who had inherited the crown of Navarre from his deceased mother, Queen Joan I. They had one daughter, Joan (born 1312, died 1349).

Early in 1314, Margaret was caught in an alleged act of adultery in the Tour de Nesle affair. Her sister-in-law Isabella of France was a witness against her, and Margaret was imprisoned at Château Gaillard along with her sister-in-law Blanche of Burgundy.

In November of the same year, Louis I of Navarre ascended the French throne as Louis X of France, thus Margaret became Queen of France. However, she remained confined, as Louis would not revoke her punishment for adultery, nor have her crowned as a queen consort. Without an incumbent pope, Louis had no means of annulling his marriage. After poor treatment in prison, Queen Margaret caught a cold and died in 1315, although another source states that she was strangled to death.

==Legacy==
Margaret&#x27;s daughter, Joan, later became queen regnant of Navarre as Joan II (1311–1349). Her paternity was under doubt because of her mother&#x27;s alleged adultery. On his deathbed, Louis formally recognized Joan as his daughter.

In 1361, Margaret&#x27;s succession rights became important in the premature death of Philip I, Duke of Burgundy (her grandnephew), since the closest Burgundian heirs were descendants of Margaret and of her sister, Joan the Lame. Margaret&#x27;s grandson and heir Charles II of Navarre claimed the duchy on the basis of primogeniture, but Joan the Lame&#x27;s son John II of France on the basis of proximity, being one generation closer to the Burgundian dukes. As king, John ruled in his own favor and became Duke of Burgundy, later bestowing the Duchy upon his son, Philip the Bold.

==In fiction==
Margaret is portrayed in &quot;Le Roi de Fer&quot; and &quot;La Reine Étranglée&quot;, two 1955 novels in Maurice Druon&#x27;s &quot;Les Rois Maudits&quot; (&quot;The Accursed Kings&quot;) series of historical novels. She was played by in the 1972 French miniseries adaptation of the series, and by Hélène Fillières in the 2005 adaptation.

Margaret appears as a pivotal character in the second season of the historical drama series &quot;Knightfall&quot; where she is portrayed by Clementine Nicholson.

<doc id="842947" wikidata="Q1419774" url="?curid=842947" title="Dust (His Dark Materials)">
<text>In Philip Pullman&#x27;s &quot;His Dark Materials&quot; and &quot;The Book of Dust&quot; trilogies, Dust or Rusakov particles are particles associated with consciousness that are integral to the plot. In the multiverse in which these trilogies are set, Dust is attracted to consciousness, especially after puberty; the Church within the series associates Dust with original sin and seeks its end. Pullman described Dust in an interview as &quot;an analogy of consciousness, and consciousness is this extraordinary property we have as human beings&quot;.

== Analogs ==

=== &quot;Paradise Lost&quot; ===
Anne-Marie Bird links Pullman&#x27;s concept of &quot;Dust&quot; to &quot;a conventional metaphor for human physicality inspired by God&#x27;s judgment on humanity.&quot; Writing in &quot;Children&#x27;s Literature in Education&quot;, she suggests that the first trilogy develops John Milton&#x27;s metaphor of &quot;dark materials&quot; from &quot;Paradise Lost &quot;&quot;into a ‘substance’ in which good and evil, and spirit and matter – conceptual opposites that form the basis of religious dualism – coexist.&quot; 

Meanwhile, William A. Oram argues that Pullman follows Milton in presenting &quot;matter&quot; as inherently good. For Pullman, he says, the ethical opposite is the &quot;void&quot;, which is &quot;evil&quot;. According to Oram, the Dust is the full embodiment of matter, &quot;because in matter Dust becomes conscious.&quot; Oram compares the following passage from &quot;The Amber Spyglass&quot;, in which the angel Balthamos explains the origin of Dust, to Satan&#x27;s account of his coming to consciousness in Book V of &quot;Paradise Lost&quot;:&quot;&#x27;Dust is only a name for what happens when matter begins to understand itself. Matter loves matter. It seeks to know more about itself, and Dust is formed. The first angels condensed out of Dust and the Authority was the first of all.&quot;

=== Other analogs ===
In &quot;Fantasy, Myth and the Measure of Truth&quot;, folklore and fantasy scholar William Gray has noted similarities between Pullman&#x27;s descriptions of Dust to &quot;Perelandra&quot; by C. S. Lewis, particularly the &quot;Great Dance&quot; passages where &quot;Dust&quot; is described as &quot;at the centre&quot; and &quot;whereof allworlds, and the bodies that are not worlds, are made&quot;. However, in their &quot;Mythlore&quot; article exploring Pullman&#x27;s self-positioning versus C. S. Lewis, Marek Oziewicz and Daniel Hade point out that Pullman subverts Lewis&#x27;s redemption story in which death is overcome. Whereas Lewis&#x27;s characters will supposedly live forever in their physical bodies when they enter &quot;the real Narnia&quot;, in &quot;The Amber Spyglass&quot;, &quot;Pullman&#x27;s ghosts laugh in surprise as they find themselves &#x27;turning into the night, the starlight, the air&#x27; in a materialist subversion of &#x27;dust thou art, and unto dust shall thou return&#x27;.&quot;

== Naming ==

In &quot;Northern Lights&quot;, Lord Asriel reveals the origins of the term &quot;Dust&quot; to be from a passage from the slightly alternative version of the Bible in Lyra&#x27;s world:
: &quot;In the sweat of thy face shalt thou eat bread, till thou return unto the ground; for out of it wast thou taken: for dust thou art, and unto dust shalt thou return.&quot; — 
Dust was previously known (in Lyra Belacqua&#x27;s universe) as &quot;Rusakov particles&quot; named after their discoverer, Boris Mikhailovitch Rusakov. Rusakov discovered a field permeating the universe that enabled consciousness, before the discovery of Dust; its existence was predicted, as:
: &quot;the existence of a Rusakov field implies the existence of a related particle&quot;.

In our universe, Mary Malone researches dark matter, referring to it as &quot;Shadows&quot; or &quot;Shadow particles&quot;. The name &quot;Shadows&quot; was given to the particle by her colleague, Oliver Payne, in references to Plato&#x27;s Allegory of the Cave, involving &quot;shadows on the wall&quot;. When she communicates with Shadows by interfacing with her detector, it confirms that they are the same as Dust and dark matter. The Mulefa, who are able to see Dust directly, use the word &quot;sraf&quot; accompanied by a leftward flick of the trunk (or arm for humans) to describe it.

== Nature and characteristics ==
In the multiverse of &quot;His Dark Materials&quot;, the characters perceive Dust visually; scholar Amanda M. Greenwell observes that &quot;at no point does any character touch, taste, hear, or smell Dust.&quot; While the human eye is unable to see Dust unaided, multiple characters still manage to &quot;see&quot; it.Attempts to see and interpret Dust, or see and appreciate evidence of it in other visual manifestations, drive the action of the entire trilogy—which suggests that Pullman&#x27;s work, insofar as it employs this investigation into visual literacy, is largely about the way the human subject chooses to perceive the world around him.At the start of &quot;Northern Lights&quot; Lord Asriel is one of the few to have seen Dust, but only with the aid of &quot;photograms&quot; taken with &quot;a new specially prepared emulsion&quot;. He shows the scholars at Jordan College a slide show, revealing Dust as &quot;a fountain of glowing particles&quot;. Pullman himself has stated that the &quot;projecting lantern&quot; that Asriel uses was based on childhood memories of his own grandfather&#x27;s magic lantern.

When Dust is first mentioned in &quot;Northern Lights&quot;, it seems to be something negative; only later do Lyra and her daemon, Pantalaimon, discover that it is good and necessary for survival. Lord Asriel observes that Dust only gathers on adults and not children, leading Lyra to uncover the true meaning of Dust. In her world, the Church has identified Dust as what it calls &quot;original sin&quot;; Dust originated when Adam and Eve ate the fruit of the Tree of the Knowledge of Good and Evil. In Pullman&#x27;s universe, Dust is &quot;consciousness and knowledge and wisdom&quot; – something children do not yet possess, and a positive force for everyone except those in the Magisterium.

== Functions ==

Dust is attracted to objects that have been formed by consciousness, and can be viewed by special photographic emulsions. It is particularly attracted to consciousnesses that have matured; in the case of humans in Lyra&#x27;s world, this happens when their Dæmon is fixed in shape. For the mulefa, this happens when adolescents start using wheels. Dust is also what connects humans to their dæmons. If the bond between a child and their dæmon is severed (as through Intercision), both the child and the dæmon will eventually die. If the separation occurs after Dust has settled on the person (that is, after adolescence), the person becomes a lifeless shell.

In &quot;The Amber Spyglass&quot;, Will and Lyra learn that, &quot;Without Dust, people will not be able to survive.&quot;

== Communication ==
Dust is able to communicate with humans via several methods shown throughout &quot;His Dark Materials&quot; and &quot;The Book of Dust&quot;, including by use of alethiometers. Mary Malone is able to construct a computer program that, when paired with a detector, can communicate with Dust by typed questions. Later, Mary uses I Ching divination, which Lyra confirms to be a method of communicating with Dust.

=== Alethiometers ===
An alethiometer is a truth telling device which can answer any question. The word is derived from the Greek words &quot;aletheia&quot; (truth) and &quot;metron&quot; (measure). In Lyra&#x27;s world, six alethiometers were constructed. Also known as &quot;symbol readers&quot;, alethiometers have a ring of 36 standard symbols, but are all different; some, for example have more elaborate decoration. Over the course of the books, several alethiometers are shown being read, including by Lyra Belacqua, Hannah Relf, and Fra Pavel.

Each symbol on the rim of an alethiometer has several levels of meaning; for example, the anchor can mean steadfastness, hope, the sea, or other interpretations. To phrase a question, three adjustable levers are pointed at symbols, and the reader has to hold the level of meaning for each symbol in their head. A fourth lever, made of an alloy sensitive to Dust, swings around, stopping on different symbols to give an answer, with the number of times it stops at a given symbol indicating the level of meaning intended.

In &quot;La Belle Sauvage&quot;, it is said that no more alethiometers can be built, as their construction depends on a rare metal being subjected to special treatment, knowledge of which has been lost. Oxford has an alethiometer in its library, which is read by Hannah Relf, various other universities have one, and one is missing. After the Magisterium attempts to steal one, a secret society opposed to their actions is able to obtain it, and give it to Relf to use on their behalf. The missing alethiometer is found by Malcolm Polstead in the pack of Gerard Bonneville, and given to the Master of Jordan College, for safekeeping.
In &quot;Northern Lights&quot;, it is this alethiometer which is given by the Master to Lyra, who is able to read it intuitively. At that point in the story, only two other alethiometers are known to survive.

== History within the books==
Within the books, Dust came into existence when consciousness did; it was created by consciousness, as well as being conscious. Occasionally, Dust condensed into Angels; the first of these was called The Authority, who told all the angels that subsequently condensed that he was the creator of the multiverse. In the trilogy, Angels are formed from condensing Dust. These angels only appear as winged humans because that is what is expected of them; in reality, they have more complex shapes, similar to &quot;architecture&quot;.

About 33,000 years prior to the time of the books, Dust had induced changes in sapient species, including humans and mulefa, to allow them to interact better, conferring more consciousness. For the mulefa, this was the start of their oral history and memory as a species. When asked directly, Dust states that this was done by rebel angels for vengeance over the war in heaven.

300 years before the start of &quot;His Dark Materials&quot;, scientists in Cittagazze had created the Subtle Knife, which allowed them to travel between worlds. However, explorers were not meticulous about closing the cuts in the fabric between worlds, and Dust was lost into the void between universes through the cracks of these windows. At that time, the mulefa noticed that their trees – which depend on Dust for fertilisation – had started producing fewer seeds.

<text>Zatarain&#x27;s is an American food and spice company based in New Orleans, Louisiana, in the United States that makes a large family of products with seasonings and spices that are part of the cultural cuisine and heritage of Louisiana and New Orleans&#x27; Cajun and Creole traditions that includes root beer extract, seasonings, boxed and frozen foods.

The company was started in New Orleans in 1886 and moved to the suburb of Gretna when the family sold the company, in 1963. 

It was founded as a grocery by Emile A. Zatarain Sr., in 1886. He created a formulation for root beer that became popular regionally after its introduction at 2:30 p.m. on May 7, 1889, at the Louisiana (Purchase) Exposition under the brand Papoose Root Beer, for which he took out a trademark. He started a new business, Papoose Pure Food Products, built a factory, and began to market it in 1889.

He expanded his product range to include mustard, pickled vegetables, and extracts. Then he moved into the spice business and became known for New Orleans and Cajun-style products. 

In 1963 the family sold the business, which has been owned in several different forms in its more than 130-year history. The brand is currently owned by McCormick, the world&#x27;s largest spice company.

==Products==
The company produces Cajun and Creole cuisine related food items, in five categories:
* Crab and shrimp boils: these are used to prepare boiled seafood and in hosting the social event known as a seafood boil. The boil is a mesh bag (formerly cheesecloth) containing spices, including mustard seed, coriander seeds, allspice, bay leaf, and black pepper. The company also offers a liquid concentrate crab boil that can be used in lieu of the mesh packets to enhance soups.
* Creole mustard, a common item in New Orleans food, is a stone-ground brown mustard, often referred to as &quot;hot mustard&quot; to differentiate it from standard American yellow mustard.
* Fish-Fri, seasoned cornmeal.
* Ready-to-serve dinners, including gumbo, jambalaya, red beans and rice, and black beans and rice contain precooked beans, rice, and seasonings, to which consumers may optionally add meat. The dinners are available in two forms: frozen, for heating in a microwave oven, or in a package to which water is added before cooking on a stovetop or in a microwave oven.
* Seasonings include cayenne pepper, root-beer extract and mixes and blends similar to the kinds of pre-blended seasonings made popular by Paul Prudhomme and Emeril Lagasse.
The company still manufactures root beer extract for home preparation and brewing.

==History==

Zatarain&#x27;s was founded by Emile A. Zatarain, Sr. a merchant and entrepreneur of Basque descent. He had 5 sons, all of whom followed him into his business when they finished school.

In 1886, Zatarain opened a grocery store with the first National Cash Register in Louisiana. A few months later, he bought a horse and buggy to do deliveries. The company&#x27;s big success, at first, was root beer. According to great-great granddaughter Allison Zatarain, &quot;Emile introduced Papoose Root Beer at 2:30 p.m. on May 7, 1889, at the Louisiana (Purchase) Exposition. The root beer was so successful, that his business grew, and grew, and grew!&quot;

Several years later, Zatarain found that it was more cost effective to sell the root beer blend as an extract. Zatarain formed a company called Papoose Pure Food Products to manufacture the root beer and diversify into other foods and he built a factory at 925 Valmont Street, New Orleans. He began to import and pack olives, pickles and spices.

When the root beer and spice business became more profitable than the grocery store, Zatarain focused on the manufacturing business at Papoose Pure Food Products. His root beer extract sold in barrels to restaurants and markets where it was added to carbonated water.

Seasonings with a Creole or Cajun flair were among the first of Papoose Pure&#x27;s products expansions. Next they moved into Creole Mustard and pickled products.

On May 29, 1922, as his sons assumed more of the day-to-day operation, Zatarain reincorporated the business as E.A. Zatarain &amp; Sons, Inc. and also did business as Zatarain&#x27;s Pure Food Products. Emile A. Zatarain, Jr. and his wife Ida May Bennett Zatarain eventually took over the business. Ida May created recipes for their products, like Remoulade Sauce and Olive Salad.

In 1963 the family sold the business to James Grinstead Viavant, founder of the Avondale Shipyards in New Orleans, who had sold his ship building business in 1959. Viavant took over the company, which was using outdated packaging technology, and modernized it.

In 1963, Viavant merged Zatarain&#x27;s Papoose Products Co., Inc. and another recently-acquired business, Pelican State Lab, owner of a brand of coated fish frying seasoning mix called Fish-Fri, which was brought under the Zatarain&#x27;s label, and became a best-seller. He dropped bleach, dyes, and pickles and focused on the profit centers at a new plant with modern equipment on a five-acre campus in Gretna, Louisiana, where he turned Zatarain&#x27;s into a regionally well-known brand by the early 1970s. Fish-Fri became &quot;the entreè&quot; of litigation in 1983. Zatarain&#x27;s sued Oak Grove Smokehouse for trademark infringement; Oak Grove sold a competitor &quot;Fish Fry.&quot; Although the court determined Fish-Fri qualified for protection, Oak Grove&#x27;s Fish Fry qualified as a fair use. The case opinion is also notable for its use of puns.

With sales now at $10M a year, as Viavant neared retirement, he sold the business to Centra Soya Co. for $24 million in May 1984. Centra increased sales revenues to $14M when it sold Zatarain&#x27;s to a San Francisco holding company, Wyndham Foods, Inc., 18 months later. Wyndham kept the retail business and expanded the brand into the institutional food business. They rolled out the boxed food products that Zatarains still manufactures, using the term &quot;Cajun&quot; on the boxes to capitalize on the trend in cooking popularized by New Orleans chef Paul Prudhomme in the 1980s. When the fad faded, the company shifted to branding Zatarain&#x27;s products as &quot;Louisiana-style&quot; or &quot;New Orleans-style&quot;.

The company was acquired again in 1987 by a Brentwood, Tennessee company, Martha White Foods, itself a subsidiary of E-II Food Specialties Co., for $35 million. Zatarain&#x27;s had several more owners over a period of months in the late 1980s, including American Brands of Old Greenwich, Connecticut.

By the 1990s, Zatarain&#x27;s marketed more than 200 products locally and regionally. It pushed for a national footing with the first national television advertising in 1999.

The company was taken private in a leveraged buyout by Citigroup Venture Capital in 1993 as Zatarain&#x27;s Partnership LP, a partner group of Citigroup Venture Capital and several Zatarain&#x27;s employees. The product line was expanded to include frozen foods. It was sold to McCormick on May 9, 1993 for $180M after the company&#x27;s sales rose 15% annually for the prior five years.

In 2017, the New Orleans Pelicans announced Zatarain&#x27;s as their jersey patch sponsor.

<text>Vinay Katiyar (born 11 November 1954) is a politician and 
the founder-president of Bajrang Dal, the youth wing of the Hindu nationalist organisation Vishwa Hindu Parishad (VHP) in India. He has served as an All India General Secretary of the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP), and as a Member of Parliament in both the Lok Sabha and the Rajya Sabha.

==Life and career==
Katiyar was born in a Kurmi family to Devi Charan Katiyar and Shyam Kali in Kanpur. He holds a bachelor&#x27;s degree in Commerce from Kanpur University.

Katiyar started his political journey with Akhil Bharatiya Vidyarthi Parishad (ABVP), the student wing of the Sangh Parivar. He was the organizing secretary of ABVP&#x27;s Uttar Pradesh state unit from 1970 to 1974, and the convener of the Jayaprakash Narayan&#x27;s Bihar Movement in 1974. He became a pracharak (full-time worker) of the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh (RSS) in 1980. He founded the Hindu Jagran Manch in 1982. In 1984, he was chosen to start the new youth organisation Bajrang Dal to support the Ram Janmabhoomi movement.

Later, Katiyar served as the President of Uttar Pradesh State Unit of the Bharatiya Janata Party from 2002 to 18 July 2004 and the national General Secretary of the BJP from 2006.

Katiyar was elected to the Lok Sabha from the Ayodhya (Lok Sabha constituency) to the 10th, 11th and 13th Lok Sabha in 1991, 1996 and 1999, and to the Rajya Sabha as a representative of Uttar Pradesh in 2012.

== Controversies ==
In a 2018 interview with ANI&quot;,&quot; Katiyar said that there was no need for Muslims to remain in India in the wake of its Partition, and that Muslims in India should, instead, move to Pakistan or Bangladesh. These views were shared after his comments about the Taj Mahal, claiming that the monument was a Hindu temple in the period of Aurangzeb&#x27;s rule and implied that it would soon be returned to its &#x27;original state&#x27; through its destruction.

<text>Harry Shuler Dent Jr. (born May 12, 1953) is an American financial newsletter writer.

== Biography ==
Dent, born in Columbia, South Carolina, is the son of Republican political strategist Harry S. Dent Sr.

Dent is the founder of HS Dent Investment Management, an investment firm based in Tampa, Florida that advises, and markets, the Dent Strategic Portfolio Fund mutual fund. Dent is also the president and founder of the Dent Research and director of H.S. Dent Publishing.

Dent writes and markets an economic newsletter that reviews the economy in the United States and around the world by focusing on generational consumer spending patterns, as well as financial markets. He has written eleven books, two recent ones being bestsellers. His most recent book, &quot;The Sale of a Lifetime&quot;, was released in September 2016.

The basis of Dent&#x27;s investment thesis, spending wave theory, is that consumer spending related to the generational formation of families has a profound effect on the market value of investments such as financial securities, real estate, and gold. Dent&#x27;s spending wave theory posits that young adults spend little within the greater economy, and spending increases while they rear children. It peaks as children leave home and then slows during the last 15 years of working life (48–63). According to Dent, the decreased spending patterns of the current generation of U.S. baby boomers entering retirement will cause a pronounced downturn in the greater macroeconomy and an associated decline in the value of financial markets.

Dent resides in San Juan, Puerto Rico.

<text>Galbi (), kalbi, galbi-gui (), or grilled ribs is a type of &quot;gui&quot; (grilled dish) in Korean cuisine. &quot;Galbi&quot; is the Korean word for &quot;rib&quot;, and the dish is usually made with beef short ribs. When pork spare ribs or another meat is used instead, the dish is named accordingly. &quot;Galbi&quot; is served raw, then cooked on tabletop grills usually by the diners themselves. The dish may be marinated in a sweet and savory sauce usually containing soy sauce, garlic, and sugar. Both non-marinated and marinated &quot;galbi&quot; are often featured in Korean barbecue. In Japan, this and many other dishes in Korean barbecue influenced yakiniku, a fusion cuisine that often makes use of galbi (glossed as &quot;karubi&quot;).

== Preparation ==
=== Cuts ===

Traditionally, &quot;galbi&quot; is cut to expose one smooth bone along the short edge with the meat uniformly filleted in flat layers.

==== LA &quot;galbi&quot; ====
&quot;Galbi&quot; can be made using a flanken cut, which features cut bones peeking out along the long edge. This style is called &quot;LA &quot;galbi&quot;&quot;. The method accommodates thinner rib-eye cuts preferred by American butchers.

The dish emerged some time in the late 20th century. It is attested to being popularly consumed in South Korea in 1990. There are a number of theories for its origin. The flanken cut is not traditional in Korea; the theories often focus on this aspect of the dish.

One theory, evaluated in an article in the &quot;Encyclopedia of Korean Culture&quot; as the most plausible, is that the dish was invented by Korean Americans in Los Angeles in the late 20th century. Meat cut in this fashion was considered affordable, as it was cut by machine. Per the theory, the dish was then imported back to South Korea.

Another theory is that the dish was invented in South Korea as part of a marketing campaign to sell American beef in the country. Per the theory, &quot;LA&quot; was used in the name because it was where the most Korean Americans lived in the United States and would have been more familiar.

Another theory is that the term &quot;LA&quot; is an abbreviation of &quot;Lateral Axis&quot;, after the direction the ribs are cut.

=== Marination ===
Non-marinated &quot;galbi&quot; is called &quot;saeng-galbi&quot; (; &quot;fresh ribs&quot;); marinated &quot;galbi&quot; is referred to as &quot;yangnyeom-galbi&quot; (; &quot;seasoned ribs&quot;). Pork &quot;galbi&quot; is usually served marinated, but non-marinated &quot;dwaeji-saeng-galbi&quot; (; &quot;fresh pork ribs&quot;), made of Jeju Black pig, is popular in Jeju Island. As pork ribs are smaller, marinated &quot;dwaeji-galbi&quot; often consists of pork ribs mixed with shoulder meats.

=== Beef ===
Softer cuts of beef, such as from a cow or heifer, are preferred when grilling &quot;galbi&quot;. Properly grilled, the dish is a glossy, dark-reddish brown with a smoky, sweet taste. The meat should easily fall from the bones.

The marinade for &quot;so-galbi-gui&quot; (; &quot;grilled beef ribs&quot;) typically includes soy sauce, sugar, minced garlic and scallions, ginger juice, ground black pepper, toasted and ground sesame, and sesame oil. The beef is usually scored on the surface prior to marinating, and the juice from Korean pears is brushed on before grilling.

=== Pork ===
For &quot;dwaeji-galbi-gui&quot; (; &quot;grilled pork ribs&quot;), the marinade can be either &quot;ganjang&quot; (soy sauce)-based or &quot;gochujang&quot; (chili paste)-based: the former being similar to beef &quot;galbi&quot; marinade and the latter being spicy. &quot;Cheongju&quot; (rice wine) is usually used in both types of marinade to remove any undesired porky smell.

If used, pork shoulder meat is carved into thicker slices of around in width. Deeper cuts are made when scoring the surface to allow the marinade to penetrate the meat.

=== Grilling and serving ===
&quot;Galbi&quot; is grilled, typically by the diners themselves, on grills set in the tables. The meat cooks for a short time on medium high heat on a lightly greased gridiron over glowing charcoal. The remaining marinade is brushed on during grilling to produce a glazed finish. 

Once cooked, the meat is typically cut into pieces over the grill with kitchen scissors, then wrapped inside lettuce leaves, &quot;kkaennip&quot; (perilla frutescens), or other leafy vegetables. These made-on-the-spot leaf wraps, called &quot;ssam&quot;, usually include a piece of grilled meat, &quot;ssamjang&quot;, raw or grilled garlic, and a sauce made of &quot;doenjang&quot; (soybean paste) and &quot;gochujang&quot; (chili paste). Like other Korean main dishes, &quot;galbi&quot; is often accompanied by &quot;bap&quot; (cooked rice) and side dishes known as &quot;banchan&quot;.

<doc id="842964" wikidata="Q7351050" url="?curid=842964" title="Robert Wilcox (actor)">
<text>Robert Wilcox (May 19, 1910 – June 11, 1955) was an American film and theater actor of the 1930s, 1940s, and 1950s.

==Personal life==
Wilcox was born in Rochester, New York, the son of Dr. Roscoe Squires Wilcox of Rochester, who died when Wilcox was 16. He attended Nazareth Hall Academy and John Marshall High School in Rochester.

He was married twice. His first wife, whom he married in 1937 and divorced two years later. was Florence Rice, daughter of sportswriter Grantland Rice. He married Diana Barrymore in 1950. The five-year marriage, which ended with his death, was stormy, with repeated separations, reconciliations and police calls for domestic disturbances. Barrymore chronicled their bouts with alcoholism in her 1957 autobiography, &quot;Too Much, Too Soon&quot;, which she dedicated to him. 

==Acting career==
He started his career with a Buffalo, New York, Community Theater Group. 
His career began in earnest in 1936 after being signed by a Universal Pictures talent scout while playing Duke Mantee in a summer-stock production of &quot;The Petrified Forest&quot;. Wilcox worked in 18 Hollywood films before World War II, starting with the role of the Intern in &quot;Let Them Live&quot;. (Another source states that he played the romantic lead in 26 films, before going into the service for World War II.) He was a contract player with Universal Studios, unhappy with his typecasting in &quot;cops and robbers&quot; roles. He is perhaps best known for playing Bob Wayne and his alter ego, &quot;The Copperhead&quot;, in the 1940 film serial &quot;Mysterious Doctor Satan&quot;.

He was inducted into the United States Army February 27, 1942. He served 38 months in the United States Army during World War II, rising from private to the rank of captain, and seeing action in Belgium, France and Germany. Following the war, he returned to Rochester, and appeared in an amateur production of &quot;Soldier&#x27;s Wife&quot;, a quiet comedy by Rose Franken about a veteran returning from the Pacific, presented in January 1946 by the Rochester Community Players. Wilcox, according to a contemporary news report, was considering whether to go back to Hollywood or to work in professional theater. his post-war work was mostly on the stage.

His last stage performance was in the road show &quot;Pajama Top&quot;, costarring his wife, Diana Barrymore. The production, an English translation of the French comic success, &quot;Moumou&quot;, was directed by Leonard Altobell (also a native of Rochester) and opened its national tour at the Auditorium Theater in Rochester November 8, 1954.

==Death==
Wilcox died of a heart attack on June 11, 1955, while riding a train from New York City to Rochester to visit his mother. A porter discovered his body in a Pullman berth when he tried to wake the actor at the Rochester train station stop. He was 45 years old. He is buried at Riverside Cemetery.

<text>Sir Julian Stephen Alfred Hodge (15 October 1904 – 17 July 2004) was a London-born entrepreneur and banker who lived in Wales for most of his life, from the age of five.

== Background and beginnings ==

Julian Hodge was born on 15 October 1904 in Camberwell, south London, the son of an electrician. His mother was Irish. At the age of four he moved with his family to Pontllanfraith in the South Wales Valleys.

He left school from the Lewis School Pengam at age 13 but his mother encouraged him to read classic novels and recite poetry to further his education. His first job was as an assistant in a chemist&#x27;s shop. He joined the Great Western Railway as a junior clerk in 1920 and studied accountancy in his spare time, qualifying as a corporate accountant in 1930. He went into business for himself as an accountant in 1934. He married Moira Thomas in 1951 and had three children.

Hodge formed the idea of creating a national bank for Wales. His business was initially based on insurance and money lending and he floated his company as the Hodge Group in 1961. In 1972 he formed the Bank of Wales (originally known as the &quot;Commercial Bank of Wales&quot;), and later the Julian Hodge Bank, in Cardiff. Hodge bought Ty Gwyn, a prominent house in the village of Lisvane, in the suburbs of Cardiff, in 1961.

He also founded the Jane Hodge foundation, named after his mother, to give money to charitable causes, often offering a &#x27;double your money&#x27; challenge where he would match the amounts raised by the public.

In later life from his home as a tax exile in Jersey, Hodge helped fund the campaign for a &quot;No&quot; vote in the 1997 Welsh devolution referendum and his son, Robert Hodge, was chairman of the &quot;Just Say No&quot; campaign.

In 2004 the Sunday Times Rich List estimated his fortune at £48 Million, making him the 18th richest person in Wales, and the oldest of Britain&#x27;s 1,000 richest people.

He died at his home on Jersey, three months short of his 100th birthday. A donation in his will funded the construction of the Sir Julian Hodge Memorial Organ at St Peter&#x27;s Church, Roath, Cardiff.

Grant Morrison created Zauriel during their tenure as writer of &quot;JLA&quot;, but was forbidden from using their originally intended name of Hawkman. At the time, Hawkman was declared off-limits by DC editors due to the character&#x27;s convoluted continuity.

==Fictional character biography==
Zauriel was an angel of the Eagle Host, one of the four hosts of Heaven, the others being Human, Bull, and Lion. Since the dawn of creation, Zauriel served the Presence as a guardian angel, protecting the souls of countless women, including Cleopatra, Mona Lisa, and Joan of Arc. After falling in love with one of his assigned women, Zauriel is expelled from Heaven.

Afterward, Zauriel joins the Justice League and battles Asmodel on several occasions. Asmodel allies with Neron and invades Heaven, but learns that he cannot overthrow the Presence. Neron betrays Asmodel and takes him prisoner.

Zauriel later becomes Heaven&#x27;s ambassador to Earth. During the &quot;Day of Judgment&quot; storyline, Asmodel bonds with the Spectre and attacks Earth before Zauriel arranges for the Spectre to bond with Hal Jordan instead.

In &quot;JLA&quot; #41, Zauriel is killed with Lex Luthor destroys the Justice League Watchtower. However, his spirit remains and becomes a guide to other heroes.

===&quot;The New 52&quot;===
In &quot;The New 52&quot; continuity reboot, Zauriel is the Phantom Stranger&#x27;s guardian angel. He is killed while assisting Justice League Dark, but is resurrected by the Presence.

==Powers and abilities==
As an angel, Zauriel is nigh-immortal, being ageless and not requiring food, water, air, or sleep to survive. Additionally, he possesses superhuman physical abilities and can generate a powerful sonic scream, sense magic, and communicate with animals.

Zauriel wields various equipment, including heavenly armor, a flaming sword that can cut through dimensional barriers, and Michael&#x27;s spear.

==Other versions==
Zauriel appears in the Elseworlds one-shot &quot;Supergirl: Wings&quot;. This version is a Lindel, an angel who plans out the lives of humans before they are born.

<text>McCormick &amp; Company, Incorporated is an American food company that manufactures, markets, and distributes spices, seasoning mixes, condiments, and other flavoring products to retail outlets, food manufacturers, and food service businesses.

Their products are available in many countries, and it is the largest producer of spices and related food products worldwide, based on revenue.

A &quot;Fortune&quot; 500 company, McCormick has approximately 14,000 employees around the globe. The company headquarters moved from Sparks to Hunt Valley, Maryland, in the third quarter of 2018.

==History==
Willoughby M. McCormick (1864–1932) started the business in Baltimore at age 25 in 1889. From one room and a cellar, he sold his initial products door-to-door, which included root beer, flavoring extracts, fruit syrup, and juices. Seven years later, McCormick bought the F.G. Emmett Spice Company and entered the spice industry. In 1903, Willoughby and his brother Roberdeau incorporated the company in Maine; they reincorporated in Maryland in 1915. The Great Baltimore Fire of February 1904 destroyed most of the company&#x27;s assets and records. However, they constructed a new five-story building on the same site within 10 months in 1905.

The United States Bureau of Chemistry investigated McCormick &amp; Company in 1916 for adulteration in its black pepper product. The court case resulted in a fine and a requirement that the company label the adulterated product as &quot;ground black pepper containing from 10 percent to 28 percent added pepper shells&quot;.

Willoughby&#x27;s nephew Charles P. McCormick (1896–1970), began working for the company in the summer of 1912, during his high school years at Baltimore City College. After graduating in 1915, he attended Johns Hopkins University, and was later elected to the company board of directors in 1925.
Willoughby died on November 4, 1932, and Charles was elected president and chairman of the board at age 36. In 1941, the big &quot;Mc&quot; became a trademark for nearly all U.S. products.

Charles P. (&quot;Buzz&quot;) McCormick, Jr. was elected president and chief executive officer in 1987 and re-elected CEO and chairman of the board in 1988.

The company celebrated its centennial in 1989 with events primarily for employees and those responsible for its success, and arranged for the musical group Up with People to give a series of performances across the U.S. for schools, churches, hospitals, and similar organizations. McCormick is a &quot;Fortune&quot; 500 company, having annual revenues of $5.6 billion in 2020.

===Acquisitions===
McCormick acquired San Francisco-based coffee, spice, and extract house A. Schilling &amp; Company in 1947, enabling McCormick to begin coast-to-coast distribution in the U.S. McCormick continued to use the Schilling name for its Western division until the 1990s, with the last product containers marked Schilling produced in 2002; since then, all of the company&#x27;s products have been marketed under the McCormick name nationwide.

It acquired Ben-Hur Products, a similar California-based company, in 1953, and Canada&#x27;s largest spice firm, Gorman Eckert &amp; Co. Ltd. of London, Ontario, in 1959. Gilroy Foods of Gilroy, California, became a wholly owned subsidiary in 1961. Other acquisitions included Baker Extract Co. in 1962, Cake Mate cake decorating in 1967, Childers Foods (later part of Golden West Foods) in 1968, and Tubed Products, an Easthampton, Massachusetts contract food packer and producer of plastic tubes, also in 1968. Charles P. McCormick retired in 1969, was named chairman emeritus, and died of a heart attack the following year.

McCormick acquired Golden West Foods, a frozen foods manufacturer and distributor in Gilroy, California, in 1973 and entered that field under the Schilling brand label. The McCormick (east) and Schilling (west) retail units were consolidated to form a Grocery Products Division in 1975 with headquarters in Baltimore. Additional acquisitions included All Portions in 1975, TV Time Foods of Chicago in 1976, Astro Foods of San Rafael, California, in 1977, and Han-Dee Pak of Atlanta in 1979.

In October 1979, Swiss pharmaceutical firm Sandoz, Ltd. announced its intention to purchase the company. McCormick sued Sandoz in May 1980 and by September Sandoz agreed to relinquish its efforts to purchase McCormick and sold the shares that it acquired in its attempt to purchase the company.

Setco, a plastic bottle producer in Culver City, California, and Stange, Chicago&#x27;s specialty flavorings and colorings company, became subsidiaries in 1981. The company acquired Paterson Jenks, a publicly held United Kingdom corporation, in 1984, and Schwartz, the largest British spice line. Other acquisitions included Armanino Farms, the world&#x27;s largest grower and processor of chives, from Armanino &amp; Son, Inc., of San Francisco in 1986; and three California companies in 1987: Gentry Foods of Gilroy, Parsley Patch of Windsor, and The Herb Farm of Encinitas.

In 1990, McCormick purchased an interest in the Old Bay seasoning brand, famous in the Chesapeake Bay region for its use in preparing and steaming the local seafood delicacy of blue crabs. It then acquired Mojave Foods Corporation of Los Angeles in 1991, and the consumer products business of Golden Dipt Company in 1993. McCormick&#x27;s 1994 acquisitions included Grupo Pesa of Mexico, Tuko Oy of Finland, Butto of Switzerland, and Minipack of Southampton, United Kingdom. Chairman Emeritus Charles P. McCormick Jr. was re-elected chairman in 1994. The company sold Golden West Foods in 1995 and Minipack of Southampton in 1996. Also sold in 1996 were Gilroy Foods, Gilroy Energy, and Giza National Dehydration of Cairo, Egypt. McCormick Canada acquired the French&#x27;s dry seasoning line in 1997.

The company acquired Ducros of France in 2000, later renamed McCormick France. In 2003, McCormick was added to the Standard &amp; Poor&#x27;s 500 Index; acquired UniqSauces of the UK and Zatarain&#x27;s of Louisiana; and sold its packaging businesses, Setco and Tubed Products, as well as its Jenks brokerage business assets. The company acquired C.M. van Sillevoldt B.V. of the Netherlands in 2004 and Epicurean International (renamed Simply Asia Foods) in 2006, with its Thai Kitchen and Simply Asia brands.

In 2007, the company started a new advertising campaign to encourage consumers to dispose of older packages of spices by pointing out that any of their packages that list their address as &quot;Baltimore, MD 21202&quot; are over 15 years old. In 2008, McCormick acquired Billy Bee Honey Products of Canada, and the Lawry&#x27;s brand of seasonings and marinades in its largest acquisition in company history for the next ten years. To gain FTC approval for the purchase of Lawry&#x27;s, McCormick agreed to sell its Season-All business to Morton Salt.

In 2011, the company acquired Kitchen Basics, an Ohio-based brand of shelf-stable liquid stock, for $38 million. During that year, it also acquired Kamis S.A., a privately held Polish company with leading brands in spices, seasonings, mustards and other flavor products in Poland for $291 million. It also bought an 85% stake in Kohinoor Speciality Foods India for $115 million, a joint venture with India-based Kohinoor Foods Limited to market and sell basmati and ready-to-eat food products in India.

In mid-2013, the company completed its acquisition of Wuhan Asia-Pacific Condiments Co. Ltd. (WAPC), a seasoning manufacturer in the central region of China with the Daqiao and ChuShiLe bouillon products.

In June 2015, McCormick purchased Stubb&#x27;s marinades, BBQ Sauce and rubs for $100 million.

In December 2015, McCormick announced that Lawrence E. Kurzius, head of global operations, would become CEO effective February 2016. Kurzius was a leader at McCormick for 12 years before the announcement and previously held positions at Uncle Ben&#x27;s, Mars Inc., and Quaker Oats Company.

The company dropped its bid to acquire Premier Foods in April 2016 after determining that Premier&#x27;s asking price would not benefit shareholders.

Late in 2016, the company acquired Enrico Giotti SpA, a private Italian flavorings company, in a $127 million deal.

In 2017, McCormick purchased Reckitt Benckiser&#x27;s Food Division (&quot;RB Foods&quot;). At over four billion dollars, it topped Lawry&#x27;s acquisition a decade earlier to become the largest acquisition in the company&#x27;s history. The addition of French&#x27;s and Frank&#x27;s RedHot to McCormick&#x27;s global portfolio represent the second and third largest brands, respectively, behind the McCormick brand.

In November 2020, McCormick agreed to buy Cholula Hot Sauce from L Catterton. In December 2020, McCormick acquired FONA, a leading North American manufacturer of flavors.

=== Research and development ===
In February 2019, McCormick announced that it worked with IBM to build an artificial intelligence (AI) system to analyze decades of data to develop new flavor combinations and seasoning mixes. The company brought its first AI-developed line of seasoning mixes to market in 2019, which were called &quot;One&quot; for making one-dish meals.

=== TV sponsorship ===
In December 2021, McCormick announced their sponsorship of &quot;Elinor Wonders Why&quot; on PBS Kids, and the PBS sponsorship group noted &quot;Let&#x27;s Go Luna&quot; as another such series; this is the first PBS programming to be funded by McCormick.

==Headquarters==

In 1970, McCormick moved its manufacturing and corporate offices from Baltimore&#x27;s Inner Harbor to Hunt Valley, Maryland. In 1991, McCormick corporate offices were moved to Sparks, Maryland. In 2018, the company&#x27;s 1,100-employee global headquarters moved from Sparks back to Hunt Valley with a grand opening held on October 2, 2018.
