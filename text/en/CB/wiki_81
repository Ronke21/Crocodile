<text>Kodi (formerly XBMC) is a free and open-source media player and technology convergence software application developed by the Kodi Foundation, a non-profit technology consortium. Kodi is available for multiple operating systems and hardware platforms, with a software 10-foot user interface for use with televisions and remote controls. It allows users to play and view most streaming media, such as videos, music, podcasts, and videos from the Internet, as well as all common digital media files from local and network storage media, or TV gateway viewer.

Kodi was initially designed as a multi-platform home-theater PC (HTPC) application that has grown to become a multi-purpose technological convergence platform. It is customizable: skins can change its appearance, and plug-ins allow users to access streaming media content via online services such as Amazon Prime Video, Crackle, Pandora, Napster, Spotify, and YouTube. The later versions also have a personal video-recorder (PVR) graphical front end for receiving live television with electronic program guide (EPG) and high-definition digital video recorder (DVR) support.

The software was originally created in 2002 as an independently developed homebrew media player application named Xbox Media Player for the first-generation Xbox game console, changing its name in 2004 to Xbox Media Center (abbreviated as XBMC, which was adopted as the official name in 2008) and was later made available under the name XBMC as a native application for Android, Linux, BSD, macOS, iOS/tvOS, and Microsoft Windows-based operating systems. Then the project was renamed again from XBMC to &quot;Kodi&quot; in July 2014 with the release of Kodi 14 (instead of the expected XBMC 14 release), while still keeping &quot;XBMC Foundation&quot; as the name for its legal entity that owns Kodi&#x27;s code as well as directly related trademarks and logos.

Because of its open source and cross-platform nature, with its core code written in C++, modified versions of Kodi XBMC together with JeOS have been used as a software appliance suite or software framework in a variety of devices, including smart TVs, set-top boxes, digital signage, hotel television systems, network connected media players and embedded systems based on armhf platforms like Raspberry Pi. Derivative applications such as MediaPortal and Plex have been spun off from XBMC or Kodi, as well as just enough operating systems like LibreELEC.

Kodi has attracted negative attention from the news media and law enforcement agencies due to some add-ons as plug-ins made available by third parties for the software that facilitates unauthorized access and playback of media content by different means of copyright infringement, as well as sellers of digital media players that pre-load them with third-party add-ons for the express purpose of making piracy easy. The XBMC Foundation have expressed that they do not endorse the use of third-party add-ons that are designed for the purpose of piracy, and it takes active steps to disassociate and distance the Kodi project from third-party add-ons that violate copyright. These steps include blocking such add-ons and banning all discussions about piracy in their community forums, as well as threatening legal action against those using the Kodi trademarks or logos to promote add-ons and digital media players that come with them pre-installed with such add-ons.

==Overview==
Kodi supports many common audio, video, and image formats, playlists, audio visualizations (FishBMC, Goom, Matrix, MilkDrop, Shadertoy), slideshows, weather forecast reporting, and third-party plugins. It is network-capable (internet and home network shares). Unlike other media center applications such as Windows Media Center, MediaPortal and MythTV, Kodi does not include its own internal digital TV-tuner code for Live TV or DVR/PVR recording functionality, as instead it acts as a unified DVR/PVR front-end with an EPG TV-Guide graphical user interface (GUI) interface which, via a common application programming interface (API), abstracts and supports multiple back-ends via PVR client add-ons from third parties, with those running either locally on the same machine or over the network.

Plug-ins, using either C/C++ programming languages to create binary add-ons or the Python scripting language to create Script Addons, expand Kodi to include features such as television program guides, YouTube, Hulu, Netflix, Veoh, online movie trailer support, and Pandora Radio and podcast streaming. Kodi also functions as a game launcher on any operating system.

Kodi&#x27;s source code is distributed as open source under the GNU General Public License (GPL-2.0-or-later), it is governed by the tax-exempt registered non-profit US organization, XBMC Foundation, and is owned and developed by a global free software community of unpaid volunteers.

Even though the original XBMC project no longer develops or supports XBMC for the Xbox, XBMC on the Xbox is still available via the third-party developer spin-off project &quot;XBMC4Xbox&quot;, which forked the Xbox version of the software and completely took over the development and support of XBMC for the old Xbox. The ending of Xbox support by the original project was also the reason that it was renamed &quot;XBMC&quot; from the old &quot;Xbox Media Center&quot; name, and why it later was renamed &quot;Kodi&quot;. The Xbox version of XBMC had the ability to launch console games, and homebrew applications such as emulators. Since the XBMC for Xbox version was never distributed, endorsed, or supported by Microsoft, it always required a modchip or softmod exploit to run on the Xbox game-console.

===Hardware requirements===
Kodi has greater basic hardware requirements than traditional 2D style software applications: it needs a 3D capable graphics hardware controller for all rendering. Powerful 3D GPU chips are common today in most modern computer platforms, including many set-top boxes, and XBMC, now Kodi, was from the start designed to be otherwise very resource-efficient, for being as powerful and versatile a framework as it is. It runs well on what (by Intel Atom standards) are relatively underpowered OpenGL 1.3 (with GLSL support), OpenGL ES 2.0 or Direct3D (DirectX) 9.0 capable systems that are IA-32/x86, x86-64, ARM (AArch32 and AArch64), RISC-V, or PowerPC G4 or later CPU based.

When software decoding of a full HD 1080p high-definition and high bit-rate video is performed by the system CPU, a dual-core 2Â GHz or faster CPU is required in order to allow for perfectly smooth playback without dropping frames or giving playback a jerky appearance. Kodi can, however, offload most of the video decoding process onto graphics hardware controller or embedded video processing circuits that support one of the following types of hardware-accelerated video decoding: Google&#x27;s MediaCodec API for Android, Intel&#x27;s VAAPI, Nvidia&#x27;s VDPAU API, AMD&#x27;s XvBA API, Microsoft&#x27;s DXVA API, Apple&#x27;s VDADecoder/VideoToolbox APIs, and the Khronos Group&#x27;s OpenMAX API, AMLogic VPU, Freescale&#x27;s i.MX6x series VPU, and Raspberry Pi&#x27;s GPU MMAL. By taking advantage of such hardware-accelerated video decoding, Kodi can play back most videos on many inexpensive, low-performance systems, as long as they contain a supported VPU or GPU.

==Core features==

===Live TV with EPG and PVR/DVR frontend===

The TV feature allows users to watch some TV broadcasts that may be transmitted by a digital terrestrial television, asymmetric digital subscriber line (ADSL), cable, or Internet streaming, depending on the chosen add-on.

From version 12.0 (Frodo), Kodi has a native Live TV with EPG (Electronic Program Guide) and DVR (Digital Video Recorder) features with a PVR (Personal Video Recorder) frontend GUI, which enables video capture and playback to and from a hard disk drive with PVR Client Addons for most popular PVR backends (TV tuner card server). These addons can be installed separately as plugins in Kodi.

The PVR backend can either be a DVR set-top box connected to the network or a PC with a digital video recorder software. This software can run on the same computer or on other computers on the same network. The PVR software can turn computers or other appliances into DVRs. The operating system can be Linux, macOS, Microsoft Windows, and Android devices.

Several types of PVR Client Addons are available:
* addons used for many PVR software and hardware such as Argus TV, DVBLogic DVBLink, DVBViewer, ForTheRecord, Tvheadend, MediaPortal, MythTV, NextPVR (formerly GB-PVR), VDR, Windows Media Center,
* addons used for Enigma2-based DVR set-top boxes such as Dreambox, DBox2, and Vu+.,
* addons used for direct LAN connection to network-attached TV-Tuners such as HDHomeRun, PCTV Systems Broadway, VBox Home TV Gateway, and Njoy Digital AnySee N7 DVB-S2 Network-Tuner.
* addons used for the Internet-based television providers FilmOn (FilmOn.TV Networks), and Stalker Middleware,
* addons used for IPTV in general, e.g. the simple PVR client addon.

===Video playback===

====Video Library====
The Video Library, one of the Kodi metadata databases, is a key feature of Kodi. It allows the organization of video content by information associated with the video files (e.g., movies and recorded TV shows) themselves. This information can be obtained in various ways, like through scrapers (e.g., web scraping sites like IMDb, TheMovieDB, TheTVDB), and nfo files. Automatically downloading and displaying movie posters and fan art backdrops as background wallpapers. The Library Mode view allows users to browse their video content by categories; Genre, Title, Year, Actors and Directors.

====Video player cores====
Kodi uses one multimedia video player &quot;core&quot; for video-playback. This video-player &quot;core&quot; for video-playback is an in-house developed cross-platform media player, &quot;DVDPlayer&quot;, which was designed to play back DVD-Video movies, and this includes support native for DVD-menus, (based on the free open source libraries code libdvdcss and libdvdnav). This FFmpeg based video-player &quot;core&quot; today supports all widespread mainstream formats. One relatively unusual feature of this DVD-player core is the capability to on-the-fly pause and play DVD-Video movies that are stored in ISO and IMG DVD-images or DVD-Video (IFO/VOB/BUP) images (even directly from uncompressed RAR and ZIP archives), from either local harddrive storage or network-share storage.

===Audio playback===

====Music Library====
The Music Library, one of the Kodi metadata databases, is another key feature of Kodi. It allows the organization of a music collection to allow searching, and creating smart playlists by information stored in music file ID meta tags, like title, artist, album, production year, genre, and popularity. Automatically downloading and displaying album covers and fan art backdrops as background wallpapers.

===Digital picture/image display===
Kodi handles all common digital picture/image formats with the options of panning/zooming and slideshow with the Ken Burns effect, with the use of CxImage open source library code. XBMC can handle CBZ (ZIP) and CBR (RAR) comic book archive files, this feature lets users view/read, browse and zoom the pictures of comics pages these contain without uncompressing them first.

===Games Manager and game console emulators===
Development was in progress on new core features integrating a built-in Games Manager and Game Launcher front-end GUI with a Games Library, and Game Console Emulator API into XBMC. The code for all was being developed in a separate branch to be incorporated into the mainline tree.

The Games Manager, once integrated into Kodi, provides a unified games manager library and GUI front-end launcher with online metadata web scraping support for information about the games. It also introduces Game Addons as new type of addon with just-in-time emulator installation. Adding a Games Library for Game Metadata, exposing info (current level, number of lives, number of coins earned, etc.) to GUI, as well as extending the Addon API to support Game Client Addons, supporting Kodi&#x27;s VFS (Virtual File System). It also provides a joystick and gamepad abstraction layer for common joystick API and input clients.

====RetroPlayer====
Also under development is the RetroPlayer video game console emulator (ROMs) interface, supporting the libretro API and emulator cores (from the RetroArch project, which is its reference front-end). Libretro itself is a modular multi-system game/emulator system designed to be fast, lightweight, and portable.

RetroPlayer supports emulators for popular retro game consoles, including Atari 2600, Lynx, Jaguar, Nintendo Entertainment System, Super NES, Nintendo 64, Game Boy, PlayStation, Master System, Genesis, Sega CD, and Game Gear, plus multiple arcade video games via MAME and Final Burn Alpha, as well as ScummVM and MS-DOS based games.

From version 18 Kodi supports a player core, Retroplayer, to play games using game emulator addons available for libretro.

===Audio, video, and pictures media formats===
Kodi can play media from CD/DVD media using an internal DVD-ROM drive. It can play media from an internal built-in hard disk drive and SMB/SAMBA/CIFS shares (Windows File-Sharing), NFS, or stream them over ReplayTV DVRs/PVRs, Universal Plug and Play (UPnP) or Digital Living Network Alliance (DLNA) shares, or stream iTunes-shares via Digital Audio Access Protocol (DAAP). Kodi can take advantage of a broadband Internet connection if available to stream Internet-video-streams like YouTube, Hulu, Netflix, and Veoh, and play Internet-radio-stations (such as Pandora Radio). Kodi includes the option to submit music usage statistics to Last.fm and Libre.fm. It has music/video-playlist features, picture/image-slideshow functions, an MP3+CDG karaoke function and many audio-visualizations and screensavers. Kodi can upscale/upconvert all standard-definition resolution videos and output them to 720p, 1080i, and 1080p high-definition resolutions.

Under Microsoft Windows, Kodi supports Directsound and WASAPI; since WASAPI performs no mixing or resampling, it provides best audio quality.

====Format support====
Kodi can be used to play/view all common multimedia formats through its native clients and parsers. It can decode these audio and video formats in software or hardware, and optionally pass-through AC3/DTS audio, or encode to AC3 in real time from movies directly to S/PDIF digital output to an external audio-amplifier/receiver for decoding.

===Addons Manager, addons and plugins===
Kodi features several open APIs to enable third-party developers to create capabilities which extend Kodi with a multitude of addons, such as audio and video streaming plugins for online sources, screensavers, skins and themes, visualizations, weather forecasts, web interfaces, web scrapers, widget scripts, and more. Kodi developers encourage users to make and submit their own addons to expand media content and value-added services accessible from within Kodi.

Kodi/XBMC features, since version 10.0 (codename: &quot;Dharma&quot;), an Addons Framework architecture and an Addons Manager GUI client that connects to a decentralized digital distribution service platform that serves add-on apps and plug-ins which among other things provide online content to Kodi, the &quot;Addons Manager&quot; (or &quot;Addons Browser&quot;) inside Kodi allows users to browse and download new addons directly from Kodi&#x27;s GUI.

Many of these online content sources are in over-the-top content high definition services and use video streaming site as sources for the media content that is offered. Kodi has extensibility and integration with online sources for free and premium streaming content, and offers content from everything from commercial video to free educational programming, and media from individuals and small businesses. Not all content sources on add-ons are available in every country, however. Due to rights agreements, many content sources are geo-restricted to prevent users in outside countries from accessing content, although some have taken to bypassing the regional restrictions in order to unblock these sources, disregarding the usage rights.

====Plugins and scripts====
Kodi features an integrated Python Scripts interpreter for addon extensions, and WindowXML application framework (a XML-based widget toolkit engine for creating a GUI for apps and widgets) in a similar fashion to Apple macOS Dashboard Widgets and Microsoft Gadgets. Python widget scripts allow normal users to add new functionality to Kodi themselves, using Python scripting language. Current plugin scripts include functions like Internet-TV and movie-trailer browsers, cinemaguides, weather forecast, over-the-top content video streaming services like YouTube, BBC iPlayer, Hulu, Netflix, Veoh, MLB.tv, Internet-radio-station browsers such as Pandora Radio, online picture sharing sites like Flickr, TV guides such as TVShow Time, e-mail clients, instant messaging, different timetables, home automation scripts to front-end control PVR software and hardware, P2P file-sharing downloaders (BitTorrent), IRC, also casual games such as &quot;Tetris&quot;.

====Metadata extraction and web scrapers====
Kodi has the built-in optional function to automatically download metadata information, cover art and other related media artwork online through its web scrapers that looks for media in the user&#x27;s audio and video folders and their sub-directories. These &quot;scrapers&quot; are used as importers to obtain detailed information from various Internet resources about movies and television shows. It can get synopses, reviews, movie posters, titles, genre classification, and other similar data. XBMCGUI then provides a rich display for audio and video files that the scrapers have identified.

Scrapers use sites like The Movie Database (TMDb) or IMDb.com to obtain thumbnails and information on movies, thetvdb.com for TV show posters and episode plots, CDDB for audio CD track listings, and Allmusic (AMG) and MusicBrainz for album thumbnails, reviews, and metadata.

Fanart.tv has been added to the list of information sources and XBMC can use it to retrieve logos, backgrounds, CDs with transparent backgrounds, album covers and banners among other image types for music artists, TV shows and movies, the popularity of which contributed to XBMC being able to handle new image types.

===Skins and themes===
Like the majority of applications that originated from a &#x27;homebrew&#x27; scene, modification and customization of the interface using skins is very popular among Kodi users and hundreds of skins and themes are available for users to install. The Kodi skinning engine&#x27;s flexibility is also advantageous to third parties wanting to create derivative works, as it facilitates rebranding the environment and making deeper changes to the look and feel of the user interface.

As of Kodi version 17, the official default skins for new installs are &quot;Estuary&quot;, for typical home-theater usage, and &quot;Estouchy&quot; for touchscreens. These newly designed skins replace the longtime default skin &quot;Confluence&quot;, and are intended to present more content on the homescreen, be easier for new users, and bring &quot;Kodi into the present day of UI design.&quot;

Users can also create their own skin (or simply modify an existing skin) and share it with others via public websites that are used for Kodi skin trading and development. Many such third-party skins exist that are well maintained by the community, and while some skins are originals with unique designs, most begin as a clone or an exact replica of other multimedia software interfaces, such as Apple Front Row, Windows Media Center Edition (MCE), MediaPortal, Wii Channel Menu (Xii), Xbox 360 interface, and others.

In addition to skins and themes users can create a themed package called a &#x27;build&#x27;. Within this package homebrew developers are able to distribute a skin and multiple addons. The delivery mechanism used within the Kodi scene is called a wizard with the Replicant Wizard being the most prominent.

===Web Interfaces===
Web Interface addons for Kodi normally allow browsing a media library remotely, to handle music playlists from a computer instead of television. Others allow remotely controlling the navigation of XBMC like a remote for remote controlling of an installed and concurrently active Kodi session running on a computer if it runs on an internet tablet or similar device with a touch interface. Others act like a media manager to allow modifying metadata and artwork in XBMC&#x27;s video and music libraries.

===Application launcher===
Kodi has a &quot;My Programs&quot; section which is meant to function as an application launcher for third-party software such as computer games and video game emulators, all from a GUI with thumbnail and different listings options. However, while this feature was fully functioning on the Xbox version of XBMC, it is still in its infant stage on Android, iOS, Linux, macOS, and Windows, thus requiring third-party launcher plugins to function properly.

==Mobile remotes and second screen apps==
There are many companion apps for mobile devices available for and associated with Kodi. Some of these mobile apps work as simple remote controls, while others function as more advanced second screen companion apps, offering additional information about what users are viewing or listening to on Kodi, such as metadata about movie actors and music artists, with links to other works available from those persons in their collection or online.

&quot;XBMC Remote for Android&quot; and &quot;XBMC Remote for iOS&quot; are free and open source official apps for mobile devices released by Team-Kodi/Team-XBMC on Google Play for Android devices and the App Store for iOS Devices, such as iPad, iPhone, and iPod Touch. These applications act as a second screen and remote control solution which allows for fully browsing the media library and for remote controlling of an installed and concurrently active XBMC session running on a computer via the handheld touchscreen user interface of these device.

Several third-party developers have also released multiple other unofficial Kodi remote control apps for iOS, Android, BlackBerry, Symbian, Ubuntu Touch, Windows Mobile, and Windows Phone devices. Some of these remote control apps are made specifically for controlling Kodi, while some universal remote control apps are capable of controlling many different media center and media player applications, and some of these third-party remote apps cost money while others are free.

==Official versions==
Due to the dated hardware of the first-generation Xbox game console that Kodi-XBMC was designed for, and a desire to expand the project&#x27;s end-user and developer-base, many official ports of XBMC to computer operating-systems and hardware platforms have been created. Through the processing power of more recent computer hardware, XBMC can decode high-definition video up to and beyond 1080p resolutions, bypassing hardware limitations of the Xbox version of XBMC.

In recent releases of Kodi-XBMC there is hardware accelerated video decoding for DXVA, VDPAU, VA-API GPU hardware video decoding, as well as hardware accelerated video decoding via ARM NEON, and OpenMAX, Broadcom Crystal HD. The source code for XBMC is actively updated by developers in a public Git repository, which may contain features and functionality not yet incorporated into the most recent &quot;stable&quot; releases.

===Native applications===
&quot;Kodi for Linux&quot; (formerly &quot;XBMC for Linux&quot;) is primarily developed for Ubuntu Linux and Kodi&#x27;s developers&#x27; own Kodibuntu (formerly &quot;XBMCbuntu&quot;). Third-party packages for most other Linux distributions are also available, and it is possible to compile XBMC Media Center from scratch for any Linux distribution, as long as the required dependency libraries are installed first. Hardware accelerated video decoding is achieved via the VDPAU API on Nvidia&#x27;s GPUs, the VAAPI API for AMD/ATI Radeon, S3 Graphics, and Intel&#x27;s newer Integrated Graphics Processors, as well as hardware accelerated video decoding via OpenMAX, ARM NEON, and Broadcom Crystal HD on systems with supporting hardware. Development version of Kodi/XBMC for Linux is available at Launchpad as PPA (Personal Package Archive) for the standard Ubuntu Desktop version 8.04 and later, as well as DEB packages for Debian.

&quot;Kodi for OS X&quot; (formerly &quot;XBMC for Mac&quot;) runs natively on Mac OS X Tiger and later, as well as on the Apple TV. 1080p playback can be achieved on Apple computers either via software decoding on the CPU, if it is powerful enough, or by hardware-accelerated video decoding for hardware supporting Apple&#x27;s VDA API or video decoders such as the Broadcom Crystal HD.

1080p playback on the first-generation Apple TV (a.k.a. &quot;ATV1&quot;) can only be achieved by hardware accelerated video decoding via Broadcom Crystal HD; the user must replace the ATV&#x27;s internal WiFi adapter with a Broadcom Crystal HD PCI Express Mini (mini-PCIe) card in order to activate this functionality.

&quot;Kodi for Windows&quot; (formerly &quot;XBMC for Windows&quot;) runs natively on Windows 7, Windows 8, and Windows 10 as a 32-bit or 64-bit application. 1080p and Ultra HD (4K) playback can be achieved on Windows computers either via software decoding on the CPU, if it&#x27;s powerful enough, or by hardware accelerated video decoding.

Hardware video decoding via DirectX Video Acceleration is supported, although this enhancement only runs on Windows 7 (or later?) since it uses the DXVA 2.0 API, which was not supported in Windows XP.

&quot;Kodi for iOS&quot; (formerly &quot;XBMC for iOS&quot;), a full port of Kodi to Apple&#x27;s iOS operating system, was released publicly on 20 January 2011. It supported both 720p and 1080p hardware accelerated video decoding of H.264 videos, and was compatible with Apple&#x27;s iDevices that use Apple A4 or Apple A5 (ARM-based) processors with a jailbroken iOS operating system.

In late 2017 &quot;MacWorld UK&quot; described how to install on iOS devices before iOS 11 without jailbreak.

&quot;Kodi for Android&quot; (formerly &quot;XBMC for Android&quot;) is a full port of the complete Kodi/XBMC application to Google&#x27;s Android operating system, officially compatible with Android 4.0 (Ice Cream Sandwich) and later versions supporting API Level 14. It was first announced and its source code released publicly on 13 June 2012. This is a full port of Kodi&#x27;s and C source code with all its dependencies to Android with a build-system that was designed to handle multiple processor architectures, like ARM, MIPS, and x86 with the Android NDK (Native Development Kit for Android) without using a single line of Java, and the XBMC.APK is running natively under Android as a NativeActivity application. Hardware accelerated video decoding on Android is currently only officially available for some specific hardware platforms, such as the Amlogic SoC based Pivos XIOS series which have been used as the reference hardware platform during the development so far. XBMC source code must be compiled with Google&#x27;s official Android NDK revision 10d or later, and be built for the &quot;android-17&quot; toolchain (Android API Level 17) using GCC version 4.8, which Kodi for Android code currently requires to compile correctly but is not supported by Google&#x27;s Android NDK. This is also the real reason why XBMC for Android does not support the original Google TV; since the Android NDK was not made available for older Google TV devices it means that Kodi/XBMC could not be compiled for it today.

===Xbox (first-generation)===

XBMC 9.04 (codename: &quot;Babylon&quot;) point-release version of XBMC for Xbox, now obsolete, was released on 6 May 2009 as the last official version of XBMC for Xbox. The original developers of XBMC have since issued a statement stating they will no longer develop or support XBMC for Xbox as part of the XBMC project as of 27 May 2010. The development of XBMC for Xbox ended because the focus for all Team XBMC developers has completely shifted to the Linux, Mac, and Windows versions of XBMC instead.

Even though the original XBMC project no longer develops or supports XBMC for the Xbox, an XBMC version for the Xbox is still available via the third-party developer spin-off project &quot;XBMC4Xbox&quot;, who have completely taken over the development and support of XBMC for the original Xbox.

XBMC for Xbox was never an authorized/signed Microsoft product, therefore a modification of the Xbox is required in order to run XBMC on an Xbox game-console. XBMC for Xbox can be run as an application (like any Xbox game), or as a dashboard that appears directly when the Xbox is turned on. Since XBMC for Xbox was part of an open source software program, its development source code was stored on a publicly accessible subversion repository. Accordingly, unofficial executable builds from the subversion repository are often released by third parties on sites unaffiliated with the official XBMC project.

===Xbox One===
On 29 December 2017, Kodi developers announced via the news section of their official website that a Kodi app had been released for the Xbox One. It is noted that the UWP version will retain the characteristic Kodi appearance, however, many core features are missing or broken.

==Commercial systems==

The developers of Kodi (formerly &quot;XBMC&quot;) state that as long as the GPL licensing of the Kodi software is respected they would love Kodi to run on as many third-party hardware platforms and operating systems as possible, as &quot;Powered by Kodi&quot; (or &quot;Powered by XBMC&quot;) branded devices and systems. They envision Kodi being pre-installed as a third-party software component that commercial and non-commercial ODMs and OEMs and systems integrator companies can use royalty-free on their own hardware, hardware such as set-top boxes from cable-TV companies, Blu-ray Disc and DVD players, game-consoles, or embedded computers and SoC (System-on-a-Chip) built into television sets for web-enabled TVs, and other entertainment devices for the living room entertainment system, home cinema, or similar uses.

Below is a list of third-party companies that sell hardware bundled with Kodi or XBMC software pre-installed, or sell uninstalled systems that specifically claim to be Kodi- or XBMC-compatible. Many of these third-party companies help submit bug fixes and new features back upstream to the original Kodi-XBMC project.

===Computer hardware===
ARCTIC is a company based in Germany best known for their cooling solutions working in partnership with the OpenELEC team. On 5 February 2013, together they released a fully passively cooled entertainment system: the MC001 media centre (US and EU version), equipped with the latest XBMC 12 (OpenELEC 3.0) platform. OpenELEC and ARCTIC are planning on their next release, aim to provide a more dedicated builds for the ARCTIC MC001 media centre systems.

AIRIS Telebision, sold by Telebision in Spain and designed specifically for the Spanish market, is a nettop based on Nvidia Ion chipset, pre-installed Ubuntu base with XBMC for Linux and a customized AEON skin and Spanish plugins. Other than the modified skin, what is unique with the AIRIS Telebision&#x27;s XBMC build is that it comes with a digital distribution service platform that they call their &quot;App Store&quot; which lets users download new Spanish plugins and updates for existing plugins. Telebision also lets users download a Live CD version of their software as freeware, which lets users install their Telebision distribution on any Nvidia Ion based computer.

Lucida TV II, made by LUCIDQ inc, is a nettop based on Nvidia Ion chipset which can be ordered with Xubuntu and XBMC software installed.

Pulse-Eight Limited sells both custom and off-the-shelf hardware primarily designed for Kodi-XBMC, such as remote controls, HTPC systems and accessories, including a custom HTPC PVR set-top-box pre-installed with XBMC that they call &quot;PulseBox&quot; Pulse-Eight also offers free performance tuned embedded versions of XBMC that they call &quot;Pulse&quot; which is based on OpenELEC and a custom PVR-build of XBMC that is meant to run on a dedicated HTPC system.

Xtreamer Ultra and Xtreamer Ultra 2, manufactured by the South Korean company Unicorn Information Systems, are nettops based on Nvidia graphics and Intel Atom processors which come with OpenELEC and Kodi-XBMC software pre-installed. The first-generation Xtreamer Ultra uses Nvidia Ion chipset with a 1.80Â GHz dual-core Intel Atom D525 CPU, while the Xtreamer Ultra 2 uses discrete GeForce GT 520M graphics with a 2.13Â GHz dual-core Intel Atom D2700 CPU.

Since 10 September 2010, ZOTAC has been shipping a software bundle that they call ZOTAC Boost XL with all their new motherboards and Mini-PCs, such as Zotac&#x27;s ZBOX and MAG series of Nettops which Zotac also does demos of with XBMC. This ZOTAC Boost XL software bundle consist of the software applications; Auslogics BoostSpeed, Cooliris, Kylo (HDTV-optimized Web Browser), and XBMC Media Center.

Zotac&#x27;s ZBOX and MAG series of small mini-PCs are nettops based on Intel, AMD, or Nvidia graphics, and they are all sold in both as complete ready-to-use computer and as barebone computers (without memory and hard drive). Zotac Zbox ID33, ID34, ID81, ID80 and AD04 are all specifically marketed towards the HTPC market, with some coming with slot-loading Blu-ray Disc optical disc drive, and some with a remote control.

The mintBox by the Linux Mint team is an OEM version of the Israeli company CompuLab&#x27;s fit-PC, which comes pre-installed with Linux Mint open source operating-system and software, MATE desktop, and XBMC. Available in two fanless models, both with AMD APUs, HDMI output port, eight USB slots, two eSATA ports, Gigabit Ethernet, 802.11 b/g/n Wi-Fi, built-in Bluetooth, and an infrared media center remote control.

===Dedicated devices===
PrismCube Ruby by Marusys is a DVB-S2 twin-tuner high-definition DVR-PVR set-top-box running XBMC as its main interface on-top of embedded Linux.

==Derivatives and forks==

Kodi/XBMC media center source code have over the years become a popular software to fork and to use as an application framework platform for others to base their own media player or media center software on, as if Kodi were a GUI toolkit, windowing system, or window manager. And today at least Boxee, Plex, Tofu, MediaPortal, LibreELEC, OpenELEC, OSMC, GeeXboX, Voddler, DVDFab Media Player, and Horizon TV are all separate derivative products that are all openly known to at least initially have forked the graphical user interface (GUI) and media player part of their software from XBMC&#x27;s source code. Many of these third-party forks and derivative work of Kodi-XBMC are said to still assist with submitting bug fixes upstream and sometimes help getting new features backported to the original Kodi-XBMC project so that others can utilize it as well, shared from one main source. However some which was initially a fork of XBMC have since fully or partially been rewritten to use closed source proprietary software. For more information see the main &quot;List of software based on XBMC&quot; article.

Some examples on building on Kodi-XBMC are LibreELEC, OSMC, OpenELEC and GeeXboX which are free and open source embedded operating systems providing complete media center software suite that comes with a preconfigured version of Kodi/XBMC and DVR/PVR plugins. They are both designed to be extremely small and very fast booting embedded Linux-based distributions, primarily optimized to be booted from flash memory or a solid-state drive, and specifically targeted to a minimum set-top box hardware setup based on ARM SoC&#x27;s or Intel x86 processor and graphics.

Similar embedded Linux distributions to LibreELEC/OpenELEC/GeeXboX are the professionally made E2BMC and OpenPCTV which are commercial Kodi/XBMC-based software platform for DVR/PVR set-top boxes, with both being designed as a hybrid integration between Kodi media center software and Dreambox&#x27;s Enigma2 PVR software scripts.

Another example is XBMC4Xbox, which is a third-party developer spin-off project of XBMC, with still active development and support of the Xbox platform. This project was created as a fork of XBMC as a separate project to continue having a version of XBMC for the Xbox hardware platform. It was not started by official members of the official XBMC project, nor will it be supported by the official Team Kodi in any way. It started when support for the Xbox branch was officially dropped by Team XBMC, which was announced on 27 May 2010.

==Programming and developing==
Kodi is a non-profit and free software community driven open-source software project that is developed only by volunteers in their spare time without any monetary gain. XBMC Foundation and the team of developers leading the development of Kodi/XBMC, &quot;&quot;Team-Kodi&quot;/&quot;Team-XBMC&quot;&quot;, encourage anyone and everyone to submit their own source code patches for new features and functions, improve existing ones, or fix bugs to the Kodi/XBMC project.

The online user manual is wiki-based and community driven, and it also works as a basic developers&#x27; guide for getting a good overview of Kodi&#x27;s architecture. However, as with most non-profit software projects, to delve deeper into programming, looking at the actual source code and the Doxygen formatted &quot;code documentation&quot; comments inside that code is needed.

===Architecture===

Kodi is a cross-platform software application whose core is mainly programmed in . Kodi uses OpenGL (or OpenGL ES) graphics rendering under Kodi for both Linux and macOS, while Kodi for Windows uses Microsoft DirectX multimedia framework and Direct3D rendering, as the Xbox version of XBMC did. Some of Kodi&#x27;s own libraries, as well as many third-party libraries that Kodi depends on, are written in the C programming-language, instead of as Kodi&#x27;s core, but they are then mostly used with a wrapper and, through Kodi&#x27;s core monolithic nature, are loaded via a dynamic linker loader for on-demand loading and unloading at run time. Kodi also still partially uses the SDL (Simple DirectMedia Layer) multimedia framework for input on Linux, but its developers are working on completely removing that small remaining dependency on SDL.

Because of Kodi/XBMC&#x27;s origin with the resource constraints on the hardware and environment of the first-generation Xbox game-console platform, all software development of Kodi/XBMC has always been focused on reserving the limited resources that existed on embedded system hardware, like the original Xbox (which was only a 733Â MHz Intel Pentium III and 64Â MB of RAM in total as shared memory), as well as the still relatively low resources of embedded system devices today, of which the main hindrance has always been the amount of available system RAM and graphics memory at any one time. This means that Kodi/XBMC is purposely programmed to be very resource- and power-efficient and can therefore run on very low-end and relatively non-expensive hardware, especially when compared to other media center software design for HTPC use.

But because of its origins from the Xbox game-console, Kodi/XBMC&#x27;s legacy graphics renderer still runs in a more game-loop rendering environment rather than using a fully event-driven and on-demand rendering, meaning that it is almost constantly re-drawing the GUI and refreshing the frames as fast as it can, even when nothing is changing on the screen. This results in very high CPU and high GPU usage, which can be observed on embedded systems and low-end machines, and hence cause high temperatures, high fan activity, and high power consumption unless capped at a maximum frame per second configuration for that specific platform build. Work is however constantly ongoing by the developers to make Kodi/XBMC run using much fewer resources on low-power and embedded systems, which will indirectly benefit all non-embedded systems as well. Efficiency improvements in this area are however being worked on in order to move away from that old style game-loop environment in order to reduce high CPU/GPU usage by the GUI, especially as XBMC usage on embedded platforms with limited CPU/GPU resources keeps growing in popularity. XBMC 11.0 (Eden) introduced Dirty-Regions rendering option for texture support to the XBMC skinning engine as an option, and XBMC 12.0 (Frodo) enabled Dirty Regions rendering to redraw the whole screen on a single dirty region by default on all platforms. Work is also in progress for XBMC 14.0 to introduce an abstracted scene-graph deferred rendering for GUI renderer abstraction.

====Portability====
Kodi has a portable code base, with its trunk (mainline source code tree) officially available for IA-32/x86, x86-64, PowerPC, and ARM-based platforms. The Kodi GUI does require 3D hardware accelerated graphics (GPU) that support OpenGL ES, OpenGL, or EGL, or Direct3D with device drivers that support OpenGL ES 2.0, or OpenGL 1.3 or later with GLSL, or DirectX in order to render the GUI at an acceptable frame rate.

Kodi is thus officially not yet available for MIPS upstream in mainline source code repository from Team-Kodi, nor does it as yet support DirectFB or DRI (Direct Rendering Infrastructure) rendering without OpenGL/GLES hardware accelerated graphics support. The combination of MIPS, DirectFB, and DRI is a popular architecture used today by simpler set-top boxes like digital broadcasting (cable/satellite) boxes and low-end digital media players, such as those based on MIPS architecture chipsets from Sigma Designs or Realtek. Kodi ports to MIPS is, however, currently being actively worked on by several independent development teams.

Kodi for Linux supports toolchain building systems for embedded development such as Yocto, Buildroot (uClibc), and the Linaro set of Makefiles and patches for easing the generation of cross-compilation toolchains as well as the creation of a file system on embedded Linux systems across a wide range of hardware, kernel platforms, and CPU architectures (x86, x86-64, ARM, MIPS, PowerPC, etc.).

===Python scripts as plugins and addons (widgets and gadgets)===
Kodi allows developers to create addons using a built-in Python interpreter) and its own WindowXML application framework, which together form an XML-based widget toolkit for which they can extend the capability of Kodi by creating a GUI for widgets. Python widget scripts allow non-developers to themselves create new add-ons for Kodi, using Python.

===Application programming interface (API)===
Other than the application programming interfaces (APIs) available to third-party Python scripts and addon plugins, Kodi features several other APIs for controlling Kodi remotely or from an external application. These APIs includes a JSON-RPC server, D-Bus Server, Web server, UPnP AV media server (with UPnP MediaServer ControlPoint, UPnP MediaRenderer DCP, UPnP RenderingControl DCP, and UPnP Remote User Interface server), and a custom multi-protocol Event Server for remote controls.

===GUI-engine and skinning (themes)===
Kodi/XBMC is noted as having a very flexible GUI toolkit and robust framework for its GUI. With its underlying complex graphical design and layout library (named libGUI in Kodi/XBMC), it provides a simple abstraction layer between the application code and the interface, while allowing extremely flexible dynamic layouts and animations that are easy to work with and makes it possible to create completely unique skins for XBMC. The skin files are written in XAML, using a standard XML base, making theme-skinning and personal customization very accessible.

==Software limitations==
Kodi&#x27;s own internal cross-platform video and audio players (DVDPlayer and PAPlayer) cannot officially play any audio or video files that are protected or encrypted with digital rights management (DRM) technologies for access control, meaning audio files purchased from online music stores such as iTunes Music Store, Audible.com, Windows Media Player Stores, and video files protected with Windows Media DRM or DivX proprietary DRM. Such files can be played only by using another media player supporting DRM, or by removing the DRM protection from the file.

==Reception==
Kodi won a Lifehacker Award in 2014 for &quot;Best Media Player&quot; in their entertainment selection. Kodi won two SourceForge 2006 Community Choice Awards. In the 2007 Community Choice Awards, Kodi was nominated finalist in six categories. Also in the 2008 Community Choice Awards Kodi won an award for Best Project for Gamers. With Microsoft&#x27;s decision to discontinue Windows Media Center (WMC) starting Windows 10, htpcBeginner.com voted Kodi not only as the best WMC alternative but also in many ways better than WMC.

==History==
On 13 December 2003, Xbox Media Player (XBMP) development stopped, by which time its successor, Xbox Media Center (XBMC), was ready for its debut, renamed as it was growing out of its &#x27;player&#x27; name and into a &#x27;center&#x27; for media playback. 

On 29 June 2004, the first stable release of XBMC was out, with the official release of Xbox Media Center 1.0.0. This announcement also encouraged everyone using XBMP or XBMC Beta release to update, as all support for those previous versions would be dropped, and they would only support version 1.0.0. Not featured in XBMP, the addition of embedded Python was given the ability to draw interface elements in the GUI, and allowed user and community generated scripts to be executed within the XBMC environment.

In the middle of 2004, with the release of 1.0.0, work continued on the XBMC project to add more features, such as support for iTunes features like DAAP and Smart Playlists, as well as many improvements and fixes.

On 18 October 2004, the second stable release of XBMC, 1.1.0, was out. This release included support for more media types, file types, container formats, as well as video playback of Nullsoft streaming videos and karaoke support (CD-G).

On 29 September 2006, after two years of heavy development, XBMC announced a stable point final release of XBMC 2.0.0. Even more features were packed into the new version with the addition of RAR and zip archive support, a brand new player interface with support for multiple players. Such players include PAPlayer, the new audio/music player with crossfade, gapless playback and ReplayGain support, and the new DVDPlayer with support for menu and navigation support as well as ISO/img image parsing. Prior to this point release, XBMC just used a modified fork of MPlayer for all of its media needs, so this was a big step forward. Support for iTunes 6.x DAAP, and UPnP Clients for streaming was also added. A reworked Skinning Engine was included in this release to provide a more powerful way to change the appearance of XBMC. The last two features include read-only support for FAT12/16/32 formatted USB mass storage devices, and a &quot;skinnable&quot; 3D visualizer.

On 12 November 2006, the release of XBMC 2.0.1 contained numerous fixes for bugs that made it through the 2.0.0 release. This also marked the change from CVS to SVN (Subversion) for the development tree.

On 29 May 2007, the team behind XBMC put out a call for developers interested in porting XBMC to the Linux operating system. A few developers on Team-XBMC had already begun porting parts of XBMC over to Linux using SDL and OpenGL as a replacement for DirectX, which XBMC was using heavily on the Xbox version of XBMC.

On 27 May 2010, the team behind XBMC announced the splitting of the Xbox branch into a new project; &quot;XBMC4Xbox&quot; which will continue the development and support of XBMC for the old Xbox hardware platform as a separate project, with the original XBMC project no longer offering any support for the Xbox.

On 2 January 2011, XBMC moved the source code repository from subversion to git, hosted at GitHub.

Development on the Git codebase is continuing and the versioning scheme has been changed to reflect the release year and month, e.g., 8.10, 9.04, 9.11, 10.05.

On 1 August 2014, an announcement was made of release 14 and name change to Kodi.

On 19 February 2021, version 19 of Kodi is released.

== Organization and licensing ==
The XBMC Foundation is the organization behind the Kodi and XBMC projects. It is legally represented by the Software Freedom Law Center (SFLC), which assists the Kodi/XBMC project and its developers in legal matters such as intellectual property. It also assists with economic issues such as handling donations and sponsors that help the project with expenses for dedicated hosting service and activities such as going to developer conferences, trade fairs and computer expos to tech demo Kodi, meeting with potential new developers, and marketing the software.

Kodi&#x27;s source code is primarily licensed under GNU General Public Licenses, XBMC core is specifically released as &quot;GPL-2.0-or-later&quot;, and is hosted through publicly available Git repositories. Add-ons, plug-ins and additional extensions such as skins that are released as official resources made by the Kodi project members are released under various free and open source licenses.

==Controversies==
=== Use for illegal streaming ===
Third-party add-ons allow users to stream copyrighted content without the permission of its copyright holder. Some Kodi distributions and hardware devices, often marketed as &quot;fully loaded&quot;, are pre-loaded with the software and such add-ons. As a result, some users have incorrectly associated these products and add-ons as being affiliated with the Kodi project. In June 2015, Amazon Appstore pulled Kodi, as it can be &quot;used to facilitate the piracy or illegal download of content&quot;, even though the software is not bundled with such content. XBMC Foundation president Nathan Betzen disagreed with the assumption, stating that &quot;We always say we don&#x27;t care what our users do with the software, and we stand by that position. But we sure do hate it when companies destroy the name of our software in order to make a profit.&quot; He also considered it ironic that Amazon would ban the app, given that it, in his opinion, helped to bolster the popularity of Amazon Fire TV products. In December 2015, the Amazon Fire TV Stick experienced a stock shortage in the United Kingdom that was speculated to have been associated with its use with Kodi. It was also pointed out that Amazon still distributed Kodi distributions with infringing add-ons via the same storefront. As of February 2019 the ban still appears to be in effect.

In February 2016, the XBMC Foundation reiterated its stance on third-party Kodi products meant for the streaming of unlicensed content; Betzen explained that the reputation of the Kodi project had been hurt by its association with third-party products whose sellers &quot;make a quick buck modifying Kodi, installing broken piracy add-ons, advertising that Kodi lets you watch free movies and TV, and then vanishing when the user buys the box and finds out that the add-on they were sold on was a crummy, constantly breaking mess.&quot; Betzen warned that although it is open source software, the name &quot;Kodi&quot; and its logos are registered trademarks of the XBMC Foundation, and that the foundation intended to strictly enforce its trademark rights to prevent their unauthorized use, especially in association with information and devices meant to enable access to unlicensed content.

In April 2017, following an April Fools&#x27; Day stunt where the Kodi website was taken down and replaced with a fake domain seizure notice, Kodi&#x27;s developers stated that they were considering working with legal third-party content providers to officially support their services within Kodi, to counter the perception that the software is primarily used for piracy.

In March 2018, Google removed &quot;Kodi&quot; from its autocomplete search query, citing that the term was associated with copyright infringement, but failed to remove autocomplete terms for modified, piracy-focused versions of Kodi (that, unlike Kodi, are illegal).

<text>Gregory Ellis Mathis (born April 5, 1960), also known as Judge Mathis, is an American former court judge for Michigan&#x27;s 36th District, who is now a television court show arbitrator, author, television producer, and motivational speaker. 

For 24 seasons from September 13, 1999 to May 25, 2023, Mathis starred in his NAACP Image Award and Daytime Emmy winning, syndicated reality courtroom show, &quot;Judge Mathis&quot;, for which he is best known. His program entered its milestone 20th season on Monday, September 3, 2018. Mathis is also the second longest-serving television arbitrator ever, behind only Judith Sheindlin of &quot;Judge Judy&quot; and &quot;Judy Justice&quot; by three seasons. 

Mathis engages in outreach and philanthropy for the state of Michigan, such as for the Flint water crisis. On May 4, 2022, Mathis was honored with a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame.

A spiritually inspired play, &quot;Been there, Done that&quot;, based on his life toured twenty-two cities in the U.S. in 2002. In addition, &quot;Inner City Miracle&quot;, a memoir, was published by Ballantine Books. On June 19, 2022, a new E! reality program, &quot;Mathis Family Matters&quot;, premiered, starring Greg Mathis as the paternal head of household along with his family and their various loved ones as they encounter various domestic ups and downs.

==Early life==
Mathis was born in Detroit, Michigan, to Charles Mathis, a Detroit native, and his wife, Alice Lee Mathis, a devoted Seventh-day Adventist, nurse&#x27;s aide, and housekeeper. Alice (then divorced from Charles) raised Mathis alone in Detroit during the turbulent 1960s and 1970s. Mathis moved to Herman Gardens in 1964 and resided with family until roughly 1970. They moved away from the housing complex to avoid rising drug use and rates of violent crime. Mathis was arrested several times as a juvenile delinquent, mainly for purse-snatching, breaking-and-entering, and robbery. He would eventually be arrested and put behind bars at age 17 for nine months for a concealed-weapons charge. While he was incarcerated in Wayne County Jail, his mother visited him and revealed she had colon cancer so the judge overhearing his case would subsequently give him an ultimatum of G.E.D or jail time along with early probation.

==Education==
Once out of jail, Mathis began working at McDonald&#x27;s, a job he needed to keep to maintain his release on probation. A close family friend helped Mathis get admitted to Eastern Michigan University, and he discovered a new interest in politics and public administration. He became a campus activist and worked for the Democratic Party, organizing several demonstrations against South African Apartheid policies. He graduated with a B.S. in Public Administration from the Ypsilanti campus and began to seek employment in Detroit&#x27;s City Hall. He also became a member of Alpha Phi Alpha fraternity.

==Career==
===Television===
Mathis&#x27;s biggest claim to fame is his television court show, &quot;Judge Mathis&quot;, which ran for 24 seasons from 1999 to 2023. The program is one of the longest-running shows in the court programming genre, 4th in place behind only &quot;Divorce Court&quot;, &quot;The People&#x27;s Court&quot; and &quot;Judge Judy&quot; (now out of production), respectively. As &quot;Divorce Court&quot; and &quot;The People&#x27;s Court&quot; have suffered temporary cancellations/re-installments/judge-role recasting, Mathis and &quot;Judge Judy&quot; boasts the longest single-production runs as well as runs with a single presiding judge. With &quot;Judge Judy&quot; out of production after 25 seasons as of July 2021, &quot;Judge Mathis&quot; became the longest-running active single-production court show until its end in 2023. Mathis is also the second-longest-reigning arbitrator in courtroom television history.

Following the success of his ongoing court show, Mathis also stars in another program entitled &quot;Mathis Family Matters&quot; which revolves around himself, his family, and their loved ones as they face domestic highs and lows.

===Outside of television===
Mathis began his political career as an unpaid intern, and then became an assistant to Clyde Cleveland, a city council member. It was at this time Mathis took the LSAT and applied to law schools; he was conditionally admitted to the University of Detroit School of Law, which was located in downtown Detroit, walking distance from city hall. He passed a summer course and was officially admitted to the night program, which took four years to complete.

Mathis was denied a license to practice law for several years after graduating from law school because of his criminal past. He received his J.D. from the University of Detroit Mercy in 1987. In 1995, he was elected a district court judge for Michigan&#x27;s 36th District, making him the youngest person in the state to hold the post. During the five years he was on the bench, he was rated in the top five of all judges in the 36th District; there are about thirty judges each year.

Mathis was appointed head of Jesse Jackson&#x27;s Presidential campaign in the state of Michigan in 1988. Mathis later became head of Mayor Coleman Young&#x27;s re-election campaign and after the victory was appointed to run the city&#x27;s east side city hall.

Mathis has continued to be involved in politics after rising to national entertainment prominence through his television show. Urban politics and African-American movements have been his focus. Most recently, Mathis was invited by the Obama administration to be a part of &quot;My Brothers Keeper&quot;, a White House Initiative to empower boys, and men of color.

On June 4, 2011, Detroit-area drivers lined up for blocks as Mathis offered up to $92 worth of free gasoline apiece to the first 92 drivers to show up at a northwest Detroit Mobil station. He told the &quot;Detroit Free Press&quot; it was a gift to the people who elected him to District Court despite his youthful criminal record. &quot;LA didn&#x27;t elect me judge,&quot; he said. &quot;Chicago didn&#x27;t elect me judge. Detroiters took a chance on me. It&#x27;s just the right thing to do. And when you&#x27;re blessed, you have to look out for the rest.&quot; The giveaway took place near the Mathis Community Center, which he funds. Its activities include self-improvement classes, food and clothing assistance, and training for ex-convicts. &quot;No matter what international fame he&#x27;s achieved, he&#x27;s still a hometown guy,&quot; said WMXD-FM&#x27;s Frankie Darcell, who announced the location on the air. &quot;Everybody&#x27;s happy. I&#x27;m happy,&quot; said gas station owner Mike Safiedine. &quot;The people need it, especially (because) the price is very high.&quot;

In September 2008, Mathis wrote a novel called &quot;Street Judge&quot;, based on the life of a judge who solves murders. It was co-written by Zane, a well-known erotic series writer of &quot;Zane&#x27;s Sex Chronicles&quot;. Mathis also wrote a book entitled &quot;Of Being a Judge to Criminals and Such&quot;.

== Activism ==
Following his time spent in the Herman Gardens mixed-income housing, Mathis remained devoted to aiding families in the area. In 2003, he lobbied city officials on the behalf of former Herman Gardens residents, imploring lawmakers to allow these individuals their first chance to move into new apartments built where Herman Gardens once stood.

==Personal life==
Mathis met his wife, Linda, a fellow Eastern Michigan University alumnus, shortly after his mother&#x27;s death. They married in June 1985 and have four children together: a daughter Jade, born May 1985, a daughter Camara, born October 1987, a son Greg Jr. born January 1989 and a son Amir, born July 1990. Mathis, who is a member of the City Temple Seventh-day Adventist Church, was awarded the Black History Achievement Award from Oakwood University, which he says is the most meaningful award he has received.

On August 22, 2024, his wife Linda filed for divorce after 39 years of marriage. In court papers, Linda listed their date of separation as July 17, 2024 and also stated that she filed for divorce due to &quot;irreconcilable differences.&quot;

On November 1, 2024, TMZ announced that Mathis and his wife have reconciled.

<doc id="838801" wikidata="Q328945" url="?curid=838801" title="Thomism">
<text>Thomism is the philosophical and theological school which arose as a legacy of the work and thought of Thomas Aquinas (1225â1274), the Dominican philosopher, theologian, and Doctor of the Church.

In philosophy, Thomas&#x27;s disputed questions and commentaries on Aristotle are perhaps his best-known works. In theology, his &quot;Summa Theologica&quot; is amongst the most influential documents in medieval theology and continues to be the central point of reference for the philosophy and theology of the Catholic Church. In the 1914 motu proprio &quot;Doctoris Angelici&quot;, Pope Pius X cautioned that the teachings of the Church cannot be understood without the basic philosophical underpinnings of Thomas&#x27;s major theses: 

== Overview ==
Thomas Aquinas held and practiced the principle that truth is to be accepted no matter where it is found. His doctrines drew from Greek, Roman, Islamic and Jewish philosophers. Specifically, he was a realist (i.e. unlike skeptics, he believed that the world can be known as it is). He often affirmed Aristotle&#x27;s views with independent arguments, and largely followed Aristotelian terminology and metaphysics. He wrote comprehensive commentaries on Aristotle, and respectfully referred to him simply as &quot;the Philosopher&quot;.

He also adhered to some neoplatonic principles, for example that &quot;it is absolutely true that there is first something which is essentially being and essentially good, which we call God, [...] [and that] everything can be called good and a being, inasmuch as it &quot;participates&quot; in it by way of a certain assimilation&quot;.

== Metaphysics ==
Aquinas says that the fundamental axioms of ontology are the principle of non-contradiction and the principle of causality. Therefore, any being that does not contradict these two laws could theoretically exist, even if said being were incorporeal.

=== Predication ===

Aquinas noted three forms of descriptive language when predicating: univocal, analogical, and equivocal.
* Univocality is the use of a descriptor in the same sense when applied to two objects or groups of objects. For instance, when the word &quot;milk&quot; is applied both to milk produced by cows and by any other female mammal.
* Analogy occurs when a descriptor changes some but not all of its meaning. For example, the word &quot;healthy&quot; is analogical in that it applies both to a person or animal which enjoys good health and to some food or drink which promotes health.
* Equivocation is the complete change in meaning of the descriptor and is an informal fallacy, for example when the word &quot;bank&quot; is applied to river banks and financial banks. Modern philosophers call it ambiguity.

Further, the usage of &quot;definition&quot; that Aquinas gives is the genus of the being, plus a difference that sets it apart from the genus itself. For instance, the Aristotelian definition of &quot;man&quot; is &quot;rational animal&quot;; its genus being animal, and what sets apart man from other animals is his rationality.

=== Being ===

In Thomist philosophy, the definition of a being is &quot;that which is&quot;, a principle with two parts: &quot;that which&quot; refers to its &quot;quiddity&quot; (literally &quot;whatness&quot;), and &quot;is&quot; refers to its &quot;esse&quot; (Latin &quot;to be&quot;). &quot;Quiddity&quot; means an essence, form, or nature which may or may not exist; whereas &quot;esse&quot; refers to existence or reality. That is, a being is &quot;an essence that exists.&quot;

Being is divided in two ways: that which is &quot;in itself&quot; (substances), and that which is &quot;in another&quot; (accidents). Substances are things which exist &quot;per se&quot; or in their own right. Accidents are qualities that apply to other things, such as shape or color: &quot;[A]ccidents must include in their definition a subject which is outside their genus.&quot; Because they only exist in other things, Aquinas holds that metaphysics is primarily the study of substances, as they are the primary mode of being.

&quot;The Catholic Encyclopedia&quot; pinpoints Aquinas&#x27; definition of &quot;quiddity&quot; as &quot;that which is expressed by its definition.&quot; The &quot;quiddity&quot; or form of a thing is what makes the object what it is: &quot;[T]hrough the form, which is the actuality of matter, matter becomes something actual and something individual&quot;, and also, &quot;the form causes matter to be.&quot; Thus, it consists of two parts: &quot;prime matter&quot; (matter without form), and substantial form, which is what causes a substance to have its characteristics. For instance, an animal can be said to be a being whose matter is its body, and whose soul is its substantial form. Together, these constitute its &quot;quiddity&quot;/essence.

All real things have the transcendental properties of being: , truth, goodness (that is, all things have a final cause and therefore a purpose), etc.

=== Causality ===
Aristotle categorized causality into four subsets in the &quot;Metaphysics&quot;, which is an integral part of Thomism:

:* (a) refers to the material cause, what a being&#x27;s matter consists of (if applicable).
:* (b) refers to the formal cause, what a being&#x27;s essence is.
:* (c) refers to the efficient cause, what brings about the beginning of, or change to, a being.
:* (d) refers to the final cause, what a being&#x27;s purpose is.

Unlike many ancient Greeks, who thought that an infinite regress of causality is possible (and thus held that the universe is uncaused), Aquinas argues that an infinite chain never accomplishes its objective and is thus impossible. Hence, a first cause is necessary for the existence of anything to be possible. Further, the First Cause must continuously be in action (similar to how there must always be a first chain in a chain link), otherwise the series collapses:

Thus, both Aristotle and Aquinas conclude that there must be an uncaused Primary Mover, because an infinite regress is impossible.

However, the First Cause does not necessarily have to be temporally the first. Thus, the question of whether or not the universe can be imagined as eternal was fiercely debated in the Middle Ages. The University of Paris&#x27;s condemnation of 1270 denounced the belief that the world is eternal. Aquinas&#x27; intellectual rival, Bonaventure, held that the temporality of the universe is demonstrable by reason. Aquinas&#x27; position was that the temporality of the world is an article of faith, and not demonstrable by reason; one could reasonably conclude either that the universe is temporal or that it is eternal.

=== Goodness ===
As per the &quot;Nicomachean Ethics&quot; of Aristotle, Aquinas defines &quot;the good&quot; as what all things strive for. E.g., a cutting knife is said to be good if it is effective at its function, cutting. As all things have a function/final cause, all real things are good. Consequently, evil is nothing but &quot;privatio boni&quot;, or &quot;lack of good&quot;, as Augustine of Hippo defined it.

Commentating on the aforementioned, Aquinas says that &quot;there is no problem from the fact that some men desire evil. For they desire evil only under the aspect of good, that is, insofar as they think it good. Hence their intention primarily aims at the good and only incidentally touches on the evil.&quot;

As God is the ultimate end of all things, God is by essence goodness itself. Furthermore, since love is &quot;to wish the good of another&quot;, true love in Thomism is to lead another to God. Hence why John the Evangelist says, &quot;Whoever is without love does not know God, for God is love.&quot;

=== Existence of God ===

Thomas Aquinas holds that the existence of God can be demonstrated by reason, a view that is taught by the Catholic Church. The &quot;quinque viae&quot; (Latin: five ways) found in the &quot;Summa Theologica&quot; (I, Q.2, art.3) are five possible ways of demonstrating the existence of God, which today are categorized as:
: 1. &quot;Argumentum ex motu&quot;, or the argument of the unmoved mover;
: 2. &quot;Argumentum ex ratione causae efficientis&quot;, or the argument of the first cause;
: 3. &quot;Argumentum ex contingentia&quot;, or the argument from contingency;
: 4. &quot;Argumentum ex gradu&quot;, or the argument from degree; and
: 5. &quot;Argumentum ex fine&quot;, or the teleological argument.
Despite this, Aquinas also thought that sacred mysteries such as the Trinity could only be obtained through revelation; though these truths cannot contradict reason:

Aquinas responds to the problem of evil by saying that God allows evil to exist so that good may come of it (for goodness done out of free will is superior than goodness done from biological imperative), but does not personally cause evil Himself.

=== View of God ===

Aquinas articulated and defended, both as a philosopher and a theologian, the orthodox Christian view of God. God is the sole being whose existence is the same as His essence: &quot;what subsists in God is His existence.&quot; (Hence why God names himself &quot;I Am that I Am&quot; in Exodus 3:14.) Consequently, God cannot be a body (that is, He cannot be composed of matter), He cannot have any accidents, and He must be simple (that is, not separated into parts; the Trinity is one substance in three persons). Further, He is goodness itself, perfect, infinite, omnipotent, omniscient, happiness itself, knowledge itself, love itself, omnipresent, immutable, and eternal. Summing up these properties, Aquinas offers the term &quot;actus purus&quot; (Latin: &quot;pure actuality&quot;).

Aquinas held that not only does God have knowledge of everything, but that God has &quot;the most perfect knowledge&quot;, and that it is also true to say that God &quot;is&quot; His understanding.

Aquinas also understands God as the transcendent cause of the universe, the &quot;first Cause of all things, exceeding all things caused by Him&quot;, the source of all creaturely being and the cause of every other cause. Consequently, God&#x27;s causality is not like the causality of any other causes (all other causes are &quot;secondary causes&quot;), because He is the transcendent source of all being, causing and sustaining every other existing thing at every instant. Consequently, God&#x27;s causality is never in competition with the causality of creatures; rather, God even causes some things through the causality of creatures.

Aquinas was an advocate of the &quot;analogical way&quot;, which says that because God is infinite, people can only speak of God by analogy, for some of the aspects of the divine nature are hidden (&quot;Deus absconditus&quot;) and others revealed (&quot;Deus revelatus&quot;) to finite human minds. Thomist philosophy holds that we can know &quot;about&quot; God through his creation (general revelation), but only in an analogous manner. For instance, we can speak of God&#x27;s goodness only by understanding that goodness as applied to humans is similar to, but not identical with, the goodness of God. Further, he argues that sacred scripture employs figurative language: &quot;Now it is natural to man to attain to intellectual truths through sensible objects, because all our knowledge originates from sense. Hence in Holy Writ, spiritual truths are fittingly taught under the &quot;likeness&quot; of material things.&quot;

In order to demonstrate God&#x27;s creative power, Aquinas says: &quot;If a being participates, to a certain degree, in an &#x27;accident,&#x27; this accidental property must have been communicated to it by a cause which possesses it essentially. Thus iron becomes incandescent by the action of fire. Now, God is His own power which subsists by itself. The being which subsists by itself is necessarily one.&quot;

== Anthropology ==

In addition to agreeing with the Aristotelian definition of man as &quot;the rational animal&quot;, Aquinas also held various other beliefs about the substance of man. For instance, as the essence (nature) of all men are the same, and the definition of being is &quot;an essence that exists&quot;, humans that are real therefore only differ by their specific qualities. More generally speaking, all beings of the same genus have the same essence, and so long as they exist, only differ by accidents and substantial form.

=== Soul ===

Thomists define the soul as the substantial form of living beings. Thus, plants have &quot;vegetative souls&quot;, animals have &quot;sensitive souls&quot;, while human beings alone have &quot;intellectual&quot; â rational and immortal â souls.

The appetite of man has two parts, rational and irrational. The rational part is called the will, and the irrational part is called passion.

=== Ethics ===
Aquinas affirms Aristotle&#x27;s definition of happiness as &quot;an operation according to perfect virtue&quot;, and that &quot;happiness is called man&#x27;s supreme good, because it is the attainment or enjoyment of the supreme good.&quot; Aquinas defines virtue as a good habit, which is a good quality of a person demonstrated by his actions and reactions over a substantial period of time. He writes:

Aquinas ascertained the cardinal virtues to be prudence, temperance, justice, and fortitude. The cardinal virtues are natural and revealed in nature, and they are binding on everyone. There are, however, three theological virtues: faith, hope, and charity (which is used interchangeably with love in the sense of &quot;agape&quot;). These are supernatural and are distinct from other virtues in their object, namely, God.

In accordance with Roman Catholic theology, Aquinas argues that humans can neither wish nor do good without divine grace. However, &quot;doing good&quot; here refers to doing good per se: man &quot;can&quot; do, moved by God even then but &quot;only&quot; in the sense in which even his nature depends on God&#x27;s moving, things that happen to be good in some respect, and are not sinful, though if he has not grace, it will be without merit, and he will not succeed in it all the time. Therefore, happiness is attained through the perseverance of virtue given by the Grace of God, which is not fully attained on earth; only at the beatific vision. Notably, man cannot attain true happiness without God.

Regarding emotion (used synonymously with the word &quot;passion&quot; in this context), which, following John Damascene, Aquinas defines as &quot;a movement of the sensitive appetite when we imagine good or evil&quot;, Thomism repudiates both the Epicurean view that happiness consists in pleasure (sensual experiences that invoke positive emotion), and the Stoic view that emotions are vices by nature. Aquinas takes a moderate view of emotion, quoting Augustine: &quot;They are evil if our love is evil; good if our love is good.&quot; While most emotions are morally neutral, some are inherently virtuous (e.g. pity) and some are inherently vicious (e.g. envy).

Thomist ethics hold that it is necessary to observe both circumstances and intention to determine an action&#x27;s moral value, and therefore Aquinas cannot be said to be strictly either a deontologicalist or a consequentialist. Rather, he would say that an action is morally good if it fulfills God&#x27;s antecedent will.

Of note is the principle of double effect, formulated in the &quot;Summa&quot;, II-II, Q.64, art.7, which is a justification of homicide in self-defense. Previously experiencing difficulties in the world of Christian philosophy, the doctrine of Just War was expounded by Aquinas with this principle. He says:

=== Law ===

Thomism recognizes four different species of law, which he defines as &quot;an ordinance of reason for the common good, made by him who has care of the community, and promulgated&quot;:
# Eternal law, which is &quot;the type of Divine Wisdom, as directing all actions and movements;&quot;
# Natural law, &quot;whereby each one knows, and is conscious of, what is good and what is evil&quot;, which is the rational being&#x27;s participation in the eternal law;
# Human or temporal law, laws made by humans by necessity; and
# Divine law, which are moral imperatives specifically given through revelation.

The development of natural law is one of the most influential parts of Thomist philosophy. Aquinas says that &quot;[the law of nature] is nothing other than the light of the intellect planted in us by God, by which we know what should be done and what should be avoided. God gave this light and this law in creation... For no one is ignorant that what he would not like to be done to himself he should not do to others, and similar norms.&quot;

Aquinas argues that the Mosaic covenant was divine, though rightfully only given to the Jews before Christ; whereas the New Covenant replaces the Old Covenant and is meant for all humans.

=== Free will ===
Aquinas argues that there is no contradiction between God&#x27;s providence and human free will:

Aquinas argues that God offers man both a prevenient grace to enable him to perform supernaturally good works, and cooperative grace within the same. The relation of prevenient grace to voluntariness has been the subject of further debate; the position known here as &quot;Thomist&quot; was originated by Domingo BÃ¡Ã±ez and says that God gives an additional grace (the &quot;efficient grace&quot;) to the predestined which makes them accept, while Luis de Molina held that God distributes grace according to a middle knowledge, and man can accept it without a different grace. Molinism is a school that is part of Thomism in the general sense (it originated in commentaries to Aquinas), yet it must be borne in mind that, here, Thomism and Molinism oppose each other. (The question has been declared undecided by the Holy See.)

== Epistemology ==
Aquinas preceded the existence of the discipline of epistemology, which began among modern thinkers whose positions, following in the wake of Descartes, are fundamentally opposed to Aquinas&#x27;. Nonetheless, a Thomistic theory of knowledge can be derived from a mixture of Aquinas&#x27; logical, psychological, metaphysical, and even Theological doctrines. Aquinas&#x27; thought is an instance of the correspondence theory of truth, which says that something is true &quot;when it conforms to the external reality.&quot; Therefore, any being that exists can be said to be true insofar that it participates in the world.

Aristotle&#x27;s &quot;De anima&quot; (&quot;On the Soul&quot;) divides the mind into three parts: sensation, imagination and intellection. When one perceives an object, his mind composites a sense-image. When he remembers the object he previously sensed, he is imagining its form (the image of the imagination is often translated as &quot;phantasm&quot;). When he extracts information from this phantasm, he is using his intellect. Consequently, all human knowledge concerning universals (such as species and properties) are derived from the phantasm (&quot;the received is in the receiver according to the mode of the receiver&quot;), which itself is a recollection of an experience. Concerning the question of &quot;Whether the intellect can actually understand through the intelligible species of which it is possessed, without turning to the phantasms?&quot; in the &quot;Summa Theologica&quot;, Aquinas quotes Aristotle in the &quot;sed contra&quot;: &quot;the soul understands nothing without a phantasm.&quot; Hence the peripatetic axiom. (Another theorem to be drawn from this is that error is a result of drawing false conclusions based on our sensations.)

Aquinas&#x27; epistemological theory would later be classified as empiricism, for holding that sensations are a necessary step in acquiring knowledge, and that deductions cannot be made from pure reason.

== Impact==
Aquinas shifted Scholasticism away from neoplatonism and towards Aristotle. The ensuing school of thought, through its influence on Catholicism and the ethics of the Catholic school, is one of the most influential philosophies of all time, also significant due to the number of people living by its teachings.
Before Aquinas&#x27; death, Stephen Tempier, Bishop of Paris, forbade certain positions associated with Aquinas (especially his denial of both universal &quot;hylomorphism&quot; and a plurality of substantial forms in a single substance) to be taught in the Faculty of Arts at Paris. Through the influence of traditional Augustinian theologians, some theses of Aquinas were condemned in 1277 by the ecclesiastical authorities of Paris and Oxford (the most important theological schools in the Middle Ages). The Franciscan Order opposed the ideas of the Dominican Aquinas, while the Dominicans institutionally took up the defense of his work (1286), and thereafter adopted it as an official philosophy of the order to be taught in their &quot;studia&quot;. Early opponents of Aquinas include William de la Mare, Henry of Ghent, Giles of Rome, and Jon Duns Scotus.

Early and noteworthy defenders of Aquinas were his former teacher Albertus Magnus, the ill-fated Richard Knapwell, William Macclesfeld, Giles of Lessines, John of Quidort, Bernard of Auvergne and Thomas of Sutton.
The canonization of Aquinas in 1323 led to a revocation of the condemnation of 1277. Later, Aquinas and his school would find a formidable opponent in the &quot;via moderna&quot;, particularly in William of Ockham and his adherents.

Thomism remained a doctrine held principally by Dominican theologians, such as Giovanni Capreolo (1380â1444) or Tommaso de Vio (1468â1534). Eventually, in the 16th century, Thomism found a stronghold on the Iberian Peninsula, through for example the Dominicans Francisco de Vitoria (particularly noteworthy for his work in natural law theory), Domingo de Soto (notable for his work on economic theory), John of St. Thomas, and Domingo BÃ¡Ã±ez; the Carmelites of Salamanca (i.e., the Salmanticenses); and even, in a way, the newly formed Jesuits, particularly Francisco SuÃ¡rez, and Luis de Molina.

The modern period brought considerable difficulty for Thomism.

Pope Leo XIII attempted a Thomistic revival, particularly with his 1879 encyclical &quot;Aeterni Patris&quot; and his establishment of the Leonine Commission, established to produce critical editions of Aquinas&#x27; &quot;opera omnia&quot;. This encyclical served as the impetus for the rise of Neothomism, which brought an emphasis on the ethical parts of Thomism, as well as a large part of its views on life, humans, and theology, are found in the various schools of Neothomism. Neothomism held sway as the dominant philosophy of the Roman Catholic Church until the Second Vatican Council, which seemed, in the eyes of &quot;Homiletic and Pastoral Review&quot; writer Fr. Brian Van Hove, SJ, to confirm the significance of Ressourcement theology.

Thomism remains a school of philosophy today, and influential in Catholicism, though &quot;The Church has no philosophy of her own nor does she canonize any one particular philosophy in preference to others.&quot;

In recent years, the cognitive neuroscientist Walter Freeman proposes that Thomism is the philosophical system explaining cognition that is most compatible with neurodynamics, in a 2008 article in the journal &quot;Mind and Matter&quot; entitled &quot;Nonlinear Brain Dynamics and Intention According to Aquinas.&quot;

==Connection with Jewish thought==
Aquinas did not disdain to draw upon Jewish philosophical sources. His main work, the &quot;Summa Theologica&quot;, shows a profound knowledge not only of the writings of Avicebron (Ibn Gabirol), whose name he mentions, but also of most Jewish philosophical works then existing.

Aquinas pronounces himself energetically against the hypothesis of the eternity of the world, in agreement with both Christian and Jewish theology. But as this theory is attributed to Aristotle, he seeks to demonstrate that the latter did not express himself categorically on this subject. &quot;The argument&quot;, said he, &quot;which Aristotle presents to support this thesis is not properly called a demonstration, but is only a reply to the theories of those ancients who supposed that this world had a beginning and who gave only impossible proofs. There are three reasons for believing that Aristotle himself attached only a relative value to this reasoning...&quot; In this, Aquinas paraphrases Maimonides&#x27; &quot;Guide for the Perplexed&quot;, where those reasons are given.

==Scholarly perspectives==

===RenÃ© Descartes===
Thomism began to decline in popularity in the modern period, which was inaugurated by RenÃ© Descartes&#x27; works &quot;Discourse on the Method&quot; in 1637 and &quot;Meditations on First Philosophy&quot; in 1641. The Cartesian doctrines of mindâbody dualism and the fallibility of the senses implicitly contradicted Aristotle and Aquinas:

===G. K. Chesterton===
In describing Thomism as a philosophy of common sense, G. K. Chesterton wrote:
==History==
J. A. Weisheipl emphasizes that within the Dominican Order the history of Thomism has been continuous since the time of Aquinas:
An idea of the longstanding historic continuity of Dominican Thomism may be derived from the list of people associated with the Pontifical University of St. Thomas Aquinas.

Outside the Dominican Order, Thomism has had varying fortunes leading some to periodize it historically or thematically. Weisheipl distinguishes &quot;wide&quot; Thomism, which includes those who claim to follow the spirit and basic insights of Aquinas and manifest an evident dependence on his texts, from &quot;eclectic&quot; Thomism which includes those with a willingness to allow the influence of other philosophical and theological systems in order to relativize the principles and conclusions of traditional Thomism. John Haldane gives an historic division of Thomism including 1) the period of Aquinas and his first followers from the 13th to 15th centuries, a second Thomism from the 16th to 18th centuries, and a Neo-Thomism from the 19th to 20th centuries.

One might justifiably articulate other historical divisions on the basis of shifts in perspective on Aquinas&#x27; work including the period immediately following Aquinas&#x27; canonization in 1325, the period following the Council of Trent, and the period after the Second Vatican Council. Romanus Cessario thinks it better not to identify intervals of time or periods within the larger history of Thomism because Thomists have addressed such a broad variety of issues and in too many geographical areas to permit such divisions.

===First Thomistic School===
The first period of Thomism stretches from Aquinas&#x27; teaching activity beginning in 1256 at Paris to Cologne, Orvieto, Viterbo, Rome, and Naples until his canonization in 1325. In this period his doctrines &quot;were both attacked and defended&quot; as for example after his death (1274) the condemnations of 1277, 1284 and 1286 were counteracted by the General Chapters of the Dominican Order and other disciples who came to Aquinas&#x27; defense.

===1325 to the Council of Trent===
After Aquinas&#x27; canonisation, commentaries on Aquinas increased, especially at Cologne which had previously been a stronghold of Albert the Great&#x27;s thought. Henry of Gorkum (1386-1431) wrote what may well be the earliest commentary on the Summa Theologiae, followed in due course by his student Denis the Carthusian.

===Council of Trent to &quot;Aeterni Patris&quot;===
Responding to prevailing philosophical rationalism during the Enlightenment Salvatore Roselli, professor of theology at the College of St. Thomas, the future Pontifical University of Saint Thomas Aquinas, &quot;Angelicum&quot; in Rome, published a six volume &quot;Summa philosophica&quot; (1777) giving an Aristotelian interpretation of Aquinas validating the senses as a source of knowledge. While teaching at the College Roselli is considered to have laid the foundation for Neothomism in the nineteenth century. According to historian J.A. Weisheipl in the late 18th and early 19th centuries &quot;everyone who had anything to do with the revival of Thomism in Italy, Spain and France was directly influenced by Roselliâs monumental work.

===&quot;Aeterni Patris&quot; to Vatican II===

The Thomist revival that began in the mid-19th century, sometimes called &quot;neo-scholasticism&quot; or &quot;neo-Thomism&quot;, can be traced to figures such as &quot;Angelicum&quot; professor Tommaso Maria Zigliara, Jesuits Josef Kleutgen, and Giovanni Maria Cornoldi, and secular priest Gaetano Sanseverino. This movement received impetus from Pope Leo XIII&#x27;s encyclical &quot;Aeterni Patris&quot; of 1879. Generally the revival accepts the interpretative tradition of Aquinas&#x27; great commentators such as CaprÃ©olus, Cajetan, and John of St. Thomas. Its focus, however, is less exegetical and more concerned with carrying out the program of deploying a rigorously worked out system of Thomistic metaphysics in a wholesale critique of modern philosophy. Other seminal figures in the early part of the century include Martin Grabmann (1875-1949) and Amato Masnovo (1880-1955). The movement&#x27;s core philosophical commitments are summarized in &quot;Twenty-Four Thomistic Theses&quot; approved by Pope Pius X.

In the first half of the twentieth century &quot;Angelicum&quot; professors Edouard Hugon, RÃ©ginald Garrigou-Lagrange among others, carried on Leo&#x27;s call for a Thomist revival. Their approach is reflected in many of the manuals and textbooks widely in use in Roman Catholic colleges and seminaries before Vatican II.

While the Second Vatican Council took place from 1962 to 1965 Cornelio Fabro was already able to write in 1949 that the century of revival with its urgency to provide a synthetic systematization and defense of Aquinas&#x27; thought was coming to an end. Fabro looked forward to a more constructive period in which the original context of Aquinas&#x27; thought would be explored. Carol Jackson Robinson wrote popular articles and books in the service of Thomism after Vatican II. 

==Recent schools and interpretations==
A summary of some recent and current schools and interpretations of Thomism can be found, among other places, in &quot;La Metafisica di san Tommaso d&#x27;Aquino e i suoi interpreti&quot; (2002), by Battista Mondin, &quot;Being and Some 20th Century Thomists&quot; (2003), by John F. X. Knasas as well as in the writing of Edward Feser.

===Neo-Scholastic Thomism===

Neo-Scholastic Thomism identifies with the philosophical and theological tradition stretching back to the time of St. Thomas. In the nineteenth century authors such as Tommaso Maria Zigliara focused not only on exegesis of the historical Aquinas but also on the articulation of a rigorous system of orthodox Thomism to be used as an instrument of critique of contemporary thought.

Due to its suspicion of attempts to harmonize Aquinas with non-Thomistic categories and assumptions, Neo-Scholastic Thomism has sometimes been called &quot;strict observance Thomism.&quot; A discussion of recent and current Neo-Scholastic Thomism can be found in &quot;La Metafisica di san Tommaso d&#x27;Aquino e i suoi interpreti&quot; (2002) by Battista Mondin, which includes such figures as Martin Grabmann, Reginald Garrigou-Lagrange, Sofia Vanni Rovighi (1908â1990), Cornelio Fabro (1911â1995), Carlo Giacon (1900â1984), TomÃ¡Å¡ TÃ½n (1950â1990), Abelardo Lobato (1925â2012), Leo Elders (1926â2019) and Giovanni Ventimiglia (b. 1964) among others. Fabro in particular emphasizes Aquinas&#x27; originality, especially with respect to the &quot;actus essendi&quot; or act of existence of finite beings by participating in being itself. Other scholars such as those involved with the &quot;Progetto Tommaso&quot; seek to establish an objective and universal reading of Aquinas&#x27; texts.

===Cracow Circle Thomism===
Cracow Circle Thomism (named after KrakÃ³w) has been called &quot;the most significant expression of Catholic thought between the two World Wars.&quot; The Circle was founded by a group of philosophers and theologians that in distinction to more traditional Neo-Scholastic Thomism embraced modern formal logic as an analytical tool for traditional Thomist philosophy and theology.

Inspired by the logical clarity of Aquinas, members of the Circle held both philosophy and theology to contain &quot;propositions with truth-valuesâ¦a structured body of propositions connected in meaning and subject matter, and linked by logical relations of compatibility and incompatibility, entailment etc.&quot; &quot;The Cracow Circle set about investigating and where possible improving this logical structure with the most advanced logical tools available at the time, namely those of modern mathematical logic, then called &#x27;logistic&#x27;.&quot;

===Existential Thomism===
Ãtienne Gilson (1884â1978), the key proponent of existential Thomism, tended to emphasize the importance of historical exegesis but also to deemphasize Aquinas&#x27;s continuity with the Aristotelian tradition, and like Cornelio Fabro of the Neo-scholastic school, to highlight the originality of Aquinas&#x27;s doctrine of being as existence. He was also critical of the Neo-Scholastics&#x27; focus on the tradition of the commentators, and given what he regarded as their insufficient emphasis on being or existence accused them of &quot;essentialism&quot; (to allude to the other half of Aquinas&#x27;s distinction between being and essence). Gilson&#x27;s reading of Aquinas as putting forward a distinctively &quot;Christian philosophy&quot; tended, at least in the view of his critics, to blur Aquinas&#x27;s distinction between philosophy and theology. Jacques Maritain (1882â1973) introduced into Thomistic metaphysics the notion that philosophical reflection begins with an &quot;intuition of being&quot;, and in ethics and social philosophy sought to harmonize Thomism with personalism and pluralistic democracy. Though &quot;existential Thomism&quot; was sometimes presented as a counterpoint to modern existentialism, the main reason for the label is the emphasis this approach puts on Aquinas&#x27;s doctrine of existence. Other proponents include Joseph Owens, Eugene Fairweather, and John F. X. Knasas.

===River Forest Thomism===
According to River Forest Thomism (named after River Forest, Illinois), the natural sciences are epistemologically prior to metaphysics, preferably called metascience. This approach emphasizes the Aristotelian foundations of Aquinas&#x27;s philosophy, and in particular the idea that the construction of a sound metaphysics must be preceded by a sound understanding of natural science, as interpreted in light of an Aristotelian philosophy of nature. Accordingly, it is keen to show that modern physical science can and should be given such an interpretation. Charles De Koninck, Raymond Jude Nogar, James A. Weisheipl, William A. Wallace, and Benedict Ashley, are among its representatives. It is sometimes called &quot;Laval Thomism&quot; after the University of Laval in Quebec, where De Koninck was a professor. The alternative label &quot;River Forest Thomism&quot; derives from a suburb of Chicago, the location of the Albertus Magnus Lyceum for Natural Science, whose members have been associated with this approach. It is also sometimes called &quot;Aristotelian Thomism&quot; (to highlight its contrast with Gilson&#x27;s brand of existential Thomism) though since Neo-Scholastic Thomism also emphasizes Aquinas&#x27;s continuity with Aristotle, this label seems a bit too proprietary. (There are writers, like the contemporary Thomist Ralph McInerny who have exhibited both Neo-Scholastic and Laval/River Forest influences, and the approaches are not necessarily incompatible.)

===Transcendental Thomism===
Unlike the first three schools mentioned above, transcendental Thomism, associated with Joseph MarÃ©chal (1878â1944), Karl Rahner (1904â84), and Bernard Lonergan (1904â84), does not oppose modern philosophy wholesale, but seeks to reconcile Thomism with a Cartesian subject-centered approach to knowledge in general, and Kantian transcendental philosophy in particular. To Feser, &quot;It seems fair to say that most Thomists otherwise tolerant of diverse approaches to Aquinas&#x27;s thought tend to regard transcendental Thomism as having conceded too much to modern philosophy genuinely to count as a variety of Thomism, strictly speaking, and this school of thought has in any event been far more influential among theologians than among philosophers.&quot;

===Lublin Thomism===
Lublin Thomism, which derives its name from the Catholic University of Lublin in Poland where it is centered, is also sometimes called &quot;phenomenological Thomism.&quot; Like transcendental Thomism, it seeks to combine Thomism with certain elements of modern philosophy. In particular, it seeks to make use of the phenomenological method of philosophical analysis associated with Edmund Husserl and the ethical personalism of writers like Max Scheler in articulating the Thomist conception of the human person. Its best-known proponent is Karol Wojtyla (1920â2005), who went on to become Pope John Paul II.

However, unlike transcendental Thomism, the metaphysics of Lublin Thomism places priority on existence (as opposed to essence), making it an existential Thomism that demonstrates consonance with the Thomism of Ãtienne Gilson. The phenomenological concerns of the Lublin school are not metaphysical in nature as this would constitute idealism. Rather, they are considerations which are brought into relation with central positions of the school, such as when dealing with modern science, its epistemological value, and its relation to metaphysics.

===Analytical Thomism===

Analytical Thomism described by John Haldane, its key proponent, as &quot;a broad philosophical approach that brings into mutual relationship the styles and preoccupations of recent English-speaking philosophy and the concepts and concerns shared by Aquinas and his followers&quot; (from the article on &quot;analytical Thomism&quot; in &quot;The Oxford Companion to Philosophy&quot;, edited by Ted Honderich). By &quot;recent English-speaking philosophy&quot; Haldane means the analytical tradition founded by thinkers like Gottlob Frege, Bertrand Russell, G. E. Moore, and Ludwig Wittgenstein, which tends to dominate academic philosophy in the English-speaking world. Elizabeth Anscombe (1919â2001) and her husband Peter Geach are sometimes considered the first &quot;analytical Thomists&quot;, though (like most writers to whom this label has been applied) they did not describe themselves in these terms, and as Haldane&#x27;s somewhat vague expression &quot;mutual relationship&quot; indicates, there does not seem to be any set of doctrines held in common by all analytical Thomists. What they do have in common seems to be that they are philosophers trained in the analytic tradition who happen to be interested in Aquinas in some way; and the character of their &quot;analytical Thomism&quot; is determined by whether it tends to stress the &quot;analytical&quot; side of analytical Thomism, or the &quot;Thomism&quot; side, or, alternatively, attempts to emphasize both sides equally.

== 24 Thomistic theses of Pius X ==
With the decree &quot;Postquam sanctissimus&quot; of 27 July 1914, Pope Pius X stated that 24 theses formulated by &quot;teachers from various institutions [...] clearly contain the principles and more important thoughts&quot; of Aquinas.

On March 7, 1916, the Congregation of Studies, which in the meantime had become the Sacred Congregation of Seminaries and Universities, while confirming that the twenty-four theses did in fact express the authentic teaching of Saint Thomas, replied by ordering only that they be proposed by the professors to their students as safe rules of guidance.

=== Ontology ===
# Potency and Act divide being in such a way that whatever is, is either pure act, or of necessity it is composed of potency and act as primary and intrinsic principles.
# Since act is perfection, it is not limited except through a potency which itself is a capacity for perfection. Hence in any order in which an act is pure act, it will only exist, in that order, as a unique and unlimited act. But whenever it is finite and manifold, it has entered into a true composition with potency.
# Consequently, the one God, unique and simple, alone subsists in absolute being. All other things that participate in being have a nature whereby their being is restricted; they are constituted of essence and being, as really distinct principles.
# A thing is called a being because of &quot;esse&quot;. God and creature are not called beings univocally, nor wholly equivocally, but analogically, by an analogy both of attribution and of proportionality.
# In every creature there is also a real composition of the subsisting subject and of added secondary forms, i.e. accidental forms. Such composition cannot be understood unless being is really received in an essence distinct from it.
# Besides the absolute accidents there is also the relative accident, relation. Although by reason of its own character relation does not signify anything inhering in another, it nevertheless often has a cause in things, and hence a real entity distinct from the subject.
# A spiritual creature is wholly simple in its essence. Yet there is still a twofold composition in the spiritual creature, namely, that of the essence with being, and that of the substance with accidents.
# However, the corporeal creature is composed of act and potency even in its very essence. These act and potency in the order of essence are designated by the names &quot;form&quot; and &quot;matter&quot; respectively.

=== Cosmology ===
# Neither the matter nor the form have being of themselves, nor are they produced or corrupted of themselves, nor are they included in any category otherwise than reductively, as substantial principles.
# Although extension in quantitative parts follows upon a corporeal nature, nevertheless it is not the same for a body to be a substance and for it to be quantified. For of itself substance is indivisible, not indeed as a point is indivisible, but as that which falls outside the order of dimensions is indivisible. But quantity, which gives the substance extension, really differs from the substance and is truly an accident.
# The principle of individuation, i.e., of numerical distinction of one individual from another with the same specific nature, is matter designated by quantity. Thus in pure spirits there cannot be more than one individual in the same specific nature.
# By virtue of a body&#x27;s quantity itself, the body is circumscriptively in a place, and in one place alone circumscriptively, no matter what power might be brought to bear.
# Bodies are divided into two groups; for some are living and others are devoid of life. In the case of the living things, in order that there be in the same subject an essentially moving part and an essentially moved part, the substantial form, which is designated by the name soul, requires an organic disposition, i.e. heterogeneous parts.

=== Psychology ===
# Souls in the vegetative and sensitive orders cannot subsist of themselves, nor are they produced of themselves. Rather, they are no more than principles whereby the living thing exists and lives; and since they are wholly dependent upon matter, they are incidentally corrupted through the corruption of the composite.
# On the other hand, the human soul subsists of itself. When it can be infused into a sufficiently disposed subject, it is created by God. By its very nature, it is incorruptible and immortal.
# This rational soul is united to the body in such a manner that it is the only substantial form of the body. By virtue of his soul a man is a man, an animal, a living thing, a body, a substance and a being. Therefore, the soul gives man every essential degree of perfection; moreover, it gives the body a share in the act of being whereby it itself exists.
# From the human soul there naturally issue forth powers pertaining to two orders, the organic and the non-organic. The organic powers, among which are the senses, have the composite as their subject. The non-organic powers have the soul alone as their subject. Hence, the intellect is a power intrinsically independent of any bodily organ.
# Intellectuality necessarily follows upon immateriality, and furthermore, in such manner that the further the distance from matter, the higher the degree of intellectuality. Any being is the adequate object of understanding in general. But in the present state of union of soul and body, quantities abstracted from the material conditions of individuality are the proper object of the human intellect.
# Therefore, we receive knowledge from sensible things. But since sensible things are not actually intelligible, in addition to the intellect, which formally understands, an active power must be acknowledged in the soul, which power abstracts intelligible likeness or species from sense images in the imagination.
# Through these intelligible likenesses or species we directly know universals, i.e. the natures of things. We attain to singulars by our senses, and also by our intellect, when it beholds the sense images. But we ascend to knowledge of spiritual things by analogy.
# The will does not precede the intellect but follows upon it. The will necessarily desires that which is presented to it as a good in every respect satisfying the appetite. But it freely chooses among the many goods that are presented to it as desirable according to a changeable judgment or evaluation. Consequently, the choice follows the final practical judgment. But the will is the cause of it being the final one.

=== God ===
# We do not perceive by an immediate intuition that God exists, nor do we prove it &quot;a priori&quot;. But we do prove it &quot;a posteriori&quot;, i.e., from the things that have been created, following an argument from the effects to the cause: namely, from things which are moved and cannot be the adequate source of their motion, to a first unmoved mover; from the production of the things in this world by causes subordinated to one another, to a first uncaused cause; from corruptible things which equally might be or not be, to an absolutely necessary being; from things which more or less are, live, and understand, according to degrees of being, living and understanding, to that which is maximally understanding, maximally living and maximally a being; finally, from the order of all things, to a separated intellect which has ordered and organized things, and directs them to their end.
# The metaphysical motion of the Divine Essence is correctly expressed by saying that it is identified with the exercised actuality of its own being, or that it is subsistent being itself. And this is the reason for its infinite and unlimited perfection.
# By reason of the very purity of His being, God is distinguished from all finite beings. Hence it follows, in the first place, that the world could only have come from God by creation; secondly, that not even by way of a miracle can any finite nature be given creative power, which of itself directly attains the very being of any being; and finally, that no created agent can in any way influence the being of any effect unless it has itself been moved by the first Cause.

==Criticism==
In 1277, Ãtienne Tempier, the bishop of Paris who had condemned the studying of Aristotelian logic by Christian theologians in 1270, issued another more extensive condemnation. One aim of this condemnation was to clarify that God&#x27;s absolute power transcended any principles of logic that Aristotle or Averroes might place on it. More specifically, it contained a list of 219 propositions, including twenty Thomistic propositions, that the bishop had determined to violate the omnipotence of God. However Tempier&#x27;s condemnation of Thomism was withdrawn after the canonization of Thomas Aquinas. 

Thomism has also been criticised in the Eastern Orthodox Church. Prochoros Kydones, a Greek scholar from the monastic brethren of Great Lavra who opposed the teachings of Gregory Palamas on the basis of Thomism, was condemned at a Patriarchal Synod of 1368 organised by the Patriarch of Constantinople Philotheos Kokkinos, where Thomism itself was also condemned. 

Speaking on the Thomistic interpretation of transubstantiation, Eastern Orthodox theologian Vladimir Lossky states

In his &quot;Against Henry, King of the English&quot;, Luther criticized a perceived use of the proof by assertion and a reliance on style over substance in the Thomist form of disputation, which he alleged as being, &quot;It seems so to me. I think so. I believe so.&quot; Luther also argued that the Thomist method led to shallowness among theological debates in England at the time.

Thomism was criticized by Bertrand Russell in &quot;A History of Western Philosophy&quot; (1946). Neo-Thomism has been criticized by Catholic modernists such as George Tyrell and by supporters of the &quot;Nouvelle thÃ©ologie&quot;.

<text>The &quot;JÃ¤ger March&quot; (, originally &quot;JÃ¤Ã¤kÃ¤rien marssi&quot;), , is a military march by Jean Sibelius. He set in 1917 words written by the Finnish JÃ¤ger, &quot;HilfsgruppenfÃ¼hrer&quot; Heikki Nurmio who served in Libau, in the Royal Prussian 27th JÃ¤ger Battalion of the Imperial German Army. This unit was fighting against the Russian Empire, of which the Grand Duchy of Finland still was a part. The words were smuggled into Finland to Sibelius, who composed the song in JÃ¤rvenpÃ¤Ã¤.

Sibelius wrote the &quot;JÃ¤ger March&quot; originally for men&#x27;s chorus and piano, and later arranged it for men&#x27;s chorus and symphony orchestra. The first public performance of &quot;JÃ¤ger March&quot; was in Helsinki on 19 January 1918 by the choir Akademiska sÃ¥ngfÃ¶reningen, led by Olof Wallin. The Finnish Civil War began on the same day between the White and the Red troops. The march is the honorary march of many army detachments such as the Lapland Military Band from Rovaniemi.

<text>Judge Mathis is an American arbitration-based reality court show presided over by Judge Greg Mathis, a former judge of Michigan&#x27;s 36th District Court and Black-interests motivational speaker/activist.

The series ran for 24 seasons from September 13, 1999, to May 25, 2023. The series ran in first-run syndication during its active years. The series saw Judge Greg Mathis adjudicating small claims disputes from his studio courtroom set. The series is NAACP Image Award winning, as well as the first court show featuring an African American jurist to win Daytime Emmy Award for Outstanding Legal/Courtroom Program.

The series was produced by Telepictures Productions and AND Syndicated Productions, while distributed by Warner Bros. Domestic Television Distribution. The courtroom series was filmed in front of a studio audience at the NBC Tower in Chicago, but included cases and litigants from other U.S. jurisdictions. As &quot;Divorce Court&quot; and &quot;The People&#x27;s Court&quot; faced numerous judge-role casting changes, Mathis is the second longest reigning judge in television court show history, behind only Judy Sheindlin (&quot;Judge Judy&quot; and &quot;Judy Justice&quot;) by 3 years.

In February 2023, late into its final season, it was confirmed that the 24th season would be its last. Shortly after, Byron Allen&#x27;s Allen Media Group had ordered a new series starring Mathis and his son Amir as bailiff. His subsequent court show is entitled &quot;Mathis Court with Judge Mathis&quot;, which began in syndication by September 11, 2023 on Justice Central.

&quot;Judge Mathis&quot; currently continues to air in reruns.

== Judge Greg Mathis ==
===Case handling and adjudicating approach===
Mathis typically began proceedings by immediately giving the plaintiff the floor, having him/her expound on their side of the dispute in its entirety to gain insight into the matters. Mathis subsequently granted the defendant the same opportunity. Cases on &quot;Judge Mathis&quot; tended to go deeper and to more revealing places than those of most other court shows. He called attention to peculiarities or juicy details exposed throughout the proceedings as a means of making the cases more stimulating to viewers. More open and unreserved in his personal beliefs than other judges, Mathis never hesitated to tackle serious, topical societal issues, political and mental health matters, and any other touchy subjects that emerged during the proceedings. Not one to shy away from disclosing his liberal mindset, Mathis tied in his social justice and rehabilitation perspectives into the cases.

While hearing the testimonies, Mathis took on a relaxed, attentive, understanding, and open-minded nature. Rarely missing an opportunity to jest or poke fun, however, Mathis was given to wit, joking and humor, also good-natured ridicule and ribbing of the parties, often rousing his audience to uproarious amusement. He sometimes cut the tensionâeven tension he had fosteredâwith wisecracks or playfully taunting remarks. Mathis had bantered directly at audience members on occasion, also resulting in audience amusement. A trademark, Mathis sporadically used a rather high-pitched voice to stultify litigants in a manner that suggests they&#x27;ve acted foolishly or have not recognized the obvious.

Combined with his teasing and comedic tendencies on the bench, Mathis was known for his ; urban expressions; and, once he had closely observed, reasoned back and forth and taken a stance on the litigants and matters brought before him, his stern, shaming and firmly lecturing side as well. Occasionally, Mathis left the courtroom to deliberate and then returned with his verdict. Upon final judgment, he would briefly explain the legal principle guiding his verdict, especially if his ruling was based on a particular state&#x27;s law. Reportedly, Mathis&#x27;s rulings conformed to the laws of the state where the case was originally filed. In recent years, the show began to conduct paternity testing in disputes about child custody, and drug testing if applicable. Mathis often offered or compeled drug treatment and family counseling for those parties in need.
In 2024, Judge Mathis Net worth is $25 Million. He is well known for his successful profession in motivational speaker, judge, actor, qadi, author, and TV producer.

===Coming-of-age journey fused with court show===
As a child and teenage delinquent, Mathis found himself embroiled in frequent legal woes. He was a member of a street gang in Detroit, and he was arrested and sentenced to jail for illegally carrying a firearm when he was 17 years old.

Mathis was brought up in one of the worst housing projects in Detroit while raised by a single mother. During his youth, he was involved with gangs (most notably the Errol Flynns gang), dropped out of school and spent time behind bars. Growing up as a gang member and heroin dealer in the mean streets of Detroit, Michigan, Mathis had done plenty of time in juvenile detention centers before age 17. All this changed when a judge gave him an ultimatumâeither get a G.E.D. or go to jail. At the same time, Mathis found out his mother was dying of cancer. Rushing to her side, he promised her he&#x27;d turn his life around, which he did: he attended college, attended law school, earned a Juris Doctor degree, and passed the bar.

Mathis had frequently used his courtroom series to highlight his troubled-youth-turned-success story as a way of motivating and inspiring his audience (especially the youth audience) that there&#x27;s no adversity that they can&#x27;t pick themselves up from. It was from his background that Mathis derived much of his arbitration formula and television show theme. For example, the court show&#x27;s title sequence music video throughout the early seasons of the program consisted of a brief dedication to Mathis&#x27;s life story, Mathis narrating with the lines: &quot;Where I grew up, life was rough; we had to make do. And I was arrested several times as a juvenile delinquent. My mom told me she was about to die. I made my commitment that I would change my life. I bring a sense of tough life and compassion to the courtroom.&quot; Mathis later shared that he took the job as television arbitrator on the condition that his life story was shared as part of the opening for each episode.

In the same likeness of his experience, Mathis took a distinct admiration for litigants who had seen the error of their troubled ways and had made efforts to improve and better their lives. Mathis also made efforts to promote treatment and programs for individuals struggling with drug and alcohol addictions.

==Veteran court show status and honors==
===Outlasting other court shows and TV judges===
By the 2014â15 television season, &quot;Judge Mathis&quot; made it to its 16th season, making Mathis the longest-serving African American and Black court show arbitrator, surpassing Joe Brown (&quot;Judge Joe Brown&quot;), whose program lasted 15 seasons. Moreover, Mathis held the record for second-longest serving court show arbitrator ever, just behind Judge Judy Sheindlin, the presiding judge of the court show &quot;Judge Judy&quot; and its spin-off series &quot;Judy Justice&quot;.

&quot;Judge Mathis&quot; entered its milestone 20th season on Monday, September 3, 2018, and the 24th season of the program was its last. (2022â23). The success of &quot;Judge Mathis&quot; was particularly noteworthy in that, generally speaking, court show programming had a very limited shelf life. The programs in this genre are lucky to make it past a few seasons. &quot;Judge Mathis&quot; was the fourth longest-running courtroom series behind &quot;Judge Judy&quot;, &quot;The People&#x27;s Court&quot; (2nd longest running), and &quot;Divorce Court&quot; (longest running). Though both &quot;Divorce Court&quot; and &quot;The People&#x27;s Court&quot; have experienced a series of cancellations/revival reincarnations and shifting arbitrators, &quot;Judge Mathis&quot; had not. Consequently, of the court shows with a single production life, &quot;Judge Mathis&quot; was the second longest-running (second only to &quot;Judge Judy&quot; by three seasons).

During its final 2 seasons, it reigned as one of the longest running court shows (having premiered in 1999) with only 2 other programs: &quot;Divorce Court&quot; (1957) and &quot;The People&#x27;s Court&quot; (1981). Of these three court shows, only &quot;Judge Mathis&quot; had not suffered temporary cancellations amid its series run. Also of the three, Mathis was the only arbitrator to have hosted his program for the entirety of its series run.

===Court show success vs. congressional run opportunity===
From 2017 into early 2018 during the program&#x27;s 19th season, Mathis considered ending his courtroom series as he was heavily encouraged by his hometown community to run for congressman of Detroit, Michigan. Due to the successful direction and longevity of his television series, Mathis eventually opted against the congressional opportunity in favor of carrying on the &quot;Judge Mathis&quot; program. Mathis stated he would like to do his court show for as long as he can. In Mathis&#x27;s words, âItâs really not up to me. Itâs up to the viewers. I enjoy what we do, particularly the last several years, when we were able to focus a lot more and put more resources, thanks to Warner Brothers and Telepictures, toward changing lives.&quot; Mathis expressed value in his court show&#x27;s influence on drug and alcohol addicts to enroll in rehabilitation, its offering of paternity test results to litigators and providing counseling to troubled parties.

===20th season anniversary===
Mathis had stated that from the beginning, he only expected his court show to last 3 seasons. &quot;Judge Mathis&quot; was one of the longest-running, successful programs in the court show genre. Since the 2018â19 television season, it was one of two courtroom programs to have existed for two decades under one arbitrator. As of fall 2021 with the departure of &quot;Judge Judy&quot;, &quot;Judge Mathis&quot; was the only program currently still in production to have existed for over two decades under one arbitrator.

===Awards===
Judge Greg Mathis&#x27;s &quot;inspirational and positive messages to young people&quot; won the court show a PRISM Commendation in May 2002. The court show went on to win an &quot;NAACP Image Award for Outstanding News/Information â Series&quot; in 2004. In April 2018, the court show won a Daytime Emmy Award for Outstanding Legal/Courtroom Program, just ahead of making its milestone 20th season.

When &quot;Judge Mathis&quot; was crowned the winner of the Daytime Emmy Award in 2018, it became the first courtroom series with an African American jurist to win the award. In his acceptance speech for his first-ever Emmy win, he credited his diverse staff of females and minorities:

:&quot;We are very proud and honored to have been awarded this Emmy. And after 20 years, I&#x27;m so happy for my staff in particular and the diversity that they represent. The majority of our staff are females and minorities. And in this day of the Me Too movement, I think this shows that if you hire more women and have a more diverse staff, you&#x27;ll win.&quot;

On May 4, 2022, Mathis was honored with a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame.

==Production and broadcast specifics==
===On-air format, broadcast schedule, execution methods===
Each episode ran for one hour and typically consisted of 4 cases. The show is broadcast five days a week in every U.S. state, as well as Canada through Omni Television.

The cases on &quot;Judge Mathis&quot; were classified as tort law civil disputes with a maximum $5,000 claim, a typical amount for small claims court. The producers of the show selected the cases. To acquire cases, the show solicited real-life litigants with pending disputes or individuals with potential disputes.

If litigants agreed to be on the show, they were paid a talent fee ranging from $150 to $300, and they received travel accommodations. Mathis had prior knowledge of the cases. In all cases, litigants gave their prospective case managers all evidence in advance. Any outside legal case pending had to be dismissed by both parties.

Typically, Mathis&#x27;s producers only looked for cases that they deemed juicy and sensational enough for television.

===Location===
Each case&#x27;s litigators entered the second-floor studio at the NBC Tower separately and pled their case in front of a studio audience. The show paid for the litigants&#x27; travel and hotel fees, provided by a small stipend for those selected to appear before Mathis, standard practice for courtroom television programming.

Mathis, which filmed from the NBC Tower in Chicago, Illinois, reported that production consulted him about shooting the court show from Los Angeles, California. Production had expressed interest in Mathis being closer to the rest of the celebrity industry. Although he considered this suggestion, Mathis vehemently denied the option. In Mathis&#x27;s words, &quot;I didn&#x27;t want to interrupt the success. I felt that it was working well, so why disturb that? Secondly, I just love Chicago a lot more than Los Angeles.â

===COVID-19 precautionary updates for season 22===
Like most television program seasons premiering in the fall of 2020 amid the COVID-19 pandemic, &quot;Judge Mathis&quot; was forced to enter into a new season (its 22nd) in resourceful fashion. As &quot;Judge Mathis&quot; cases were pre-taped well in advance of airing for editing purposes, the program had to shoot cases during the height of the pandemic.

Unlike other courtroom programs, Greg Mathis, Doyle, the litigators and the audience all initially presented in person (as opposed to virtually). That being said, by September 7, 2020, when the series premiered its 22nd season, there were a host of on-set precautionary measures in place: a significantly depopulated courtroom audience; all members of the audience widely distanced from one another; all audience members wearing clear plastic face shields; Bailiff Doyle wearing a disposable surgical face mask; a structure bearing a large window placed between Judge Mathis and his litigators; etc. In this manner, Mathis and his litigators all remained unmasked throughout the court proceedings.

These COVID-19 measures were later updated that same season: the litigants, along with their witnesses if necessary, presented testimony from remote locations through webcam. Video monitors were set up in Mathis&#x27;s courtroom on the litigant podiums. Mathis himself along with Baliff Doyle presented to the courtroom in person, however.

== Bailiffs and supporting roles ==
&quot;Judge Mathis&quot;â³s final bailiff, Doyle Devereux had been with the program for most of its series run, since January 2003, midway into the court show&#x27;s 4th season. It was revealed in an &quot;Hour Detroit&quot; news publication that Devereux was never a real-life bailiff, however, rather an actor cast by the program to play the role of one. In Doyle&#x27;s words, &quot;The show is real, the cases are real, you guys are real. If thereâs something that could be a little fake about this show, itâs me.&quot;

Before Devereux, Kevin Lingle was the court show&#x27;s bailiff for a short duration during the show&#x27;s 4th season as well.

The court show&#x27;s first bailiff, Brendan Anthony Moran, died on December 19, 2002, after he fell to his death from the balcony of his 24th-floor Chicago condo. His death was ruled a suicide, although Mathis and Moran&#x27;s family thought differently.

In the first season of the &quot;Judge Mathis&quot; show, Leslie Merrill, a former news anchor for WPGH Pittsburgh became the show&#x27;s court reporter. Her role was to interview the litigants after Judge Mathis passed judgment and rendered his verdict on each case. She left the show after season 1. For the reminder of the series&#x27; run, &quot;Judge Mathis&quot; did not have a court reporter.

== Crossovers and other media personalities ==

* In a September 2014 &quot;Rickey Smiley Morning Show&quot; interview, Judge Mathis expressed praise towards his courtroom rivals. In the interview, he was asked what three other court show judges he&#x27;d most enjoy sharing a meal with. For his first choice, he answered &quot;Are you kidding? It would be Judge Judy at the head of the table. Oh, my goodness, that Judge Judy is something else.&quot; His second choice was Judge Marilyn Milian, and his third was Judge Mills Lane.
* On October 29, 2015, during a 17th season episode of &quot;Judge Mathis,&quot; &quot;People&#x27;s Court&quot; arbitrator Judge Marilyn Milian made a surprise appearance on &quot;Judge Mathis&quot;, interrupting one of Mathis&#x27;s courtroom proceedings. In the episode, she entered through the door to the left of the bench that Judge Mathis uses to enter and exit the courtroom and states, &quot;Hey, hey, hey! Excuse me! Let a real judge do this.&quot; Following that, she exchanged greetings and hugs with Judge Mathis, who responded, &quot;That&#x27;s right. She taught me all I know, the best judge on &quot;The People&#x27;s Court.&quot; I&#x27;m going to get some consultation from her in the back.&quot; In response, Judge Milian stated, &quot;The realest [sic] judge I know.&quot;
* In a January 2018 interview, Mathis suggested that he tried emulating Judge Judy early on and received input that his gender and race made this approach short-lived. In speaking in the early days of his courtroom series, Mathis stated:I tried to be like Judge Judy. And she was mean all the time. And then ultimately [my] producers said, âWell, no, an older white woman can talk to white folks like that, but a young black man can&#x27;t.â So I learned that lesson early on. White folks love to see black people sing and dance. So instead I decided to just be myself.
:Judge Mathis also took care to note of his high opinion of &quot;Judge Judy&quot;. He stated that he did not deserve Sheindlin&#x27;s salary, that her salary is owed to her because of her impressive ratings, and that she even &quot;ran Oprah off television&quot; with ratings that surpassed even &quot;The Oprah Winfrey Show&quot; at various points of that show&#x27;s run, such as Oprah&#x27;s final season.

<doc id="838825" wikidata="Q5102261" url="?curid=838825" title="Chito MartÃ­nez">
<text>Reyenaldo Ignacio &quot;Chito&quot; MartÃ­nez (born December 19, 1965) is a former Major League Baseball player and the first in MLB history to be born in the country of Belize.

==Career==
Born in Belize City, he emigrated to New Orleans with his family at two years old. After struggling in the minors, he contemplated going into business with his father whose company sells and services air conditioners. Martinez played minor league baseball for the Kansas City Royals organization, but never came close to the major leagues with them. The outfielder was signed to the Baltimore organization in the winter of 1990. By July 1991, Martinez had the most home runs in the International League (20) and he was called up from the Class AAA Rochester Red Wings to the Orioles.

He spent parts of three seasons (1991 to 1993) with the Baltimore Orioles, hitting 13 home runs in his rookie season and posting a slugging percentage of .514 in 216 at bats. He was also the first Orioles player to record a hit in each of his first six MLB games. It would be the high point of his career. After his power dropped dramatically in 1992, MartÃ­nez quickly faded away. He appeared in eight games in 1993 before leaving the major leagues.

==Personal==
Martinez has a son who plays minor league baseball. Drew Martinez attended the University of Memphis. He was selected by the New York Mets in the 2010 MLB draft after his sophomore year, but returned to Memphis for another year. He was selected by the Los Angeles Angels in the 10th round of the 2011 Major League Baseball draft and played in the minor leagues from 2011 to 2016.

<doc id="838826" wikidata="Q628191" url="?curid=838826" title="Industrial action">
<text>Industrial action (British English) or job action (American English) is a temporary show of dissatisfaction by employeesâespecially a strike or slowdown or working to ruleâto protest against bad working conditions or low pay and to increase bargaining power with the employer and intended to force the employer to improve them by reducing productivity in a workplace. Industrial action is usually organized by trade unions or other organised labour, most commonly when employees are forced out of work due to contract termination and without reaching an agreement with the employer. Quite often it is used and interpreted as a euphemism for strike or mass strike, but the scope is much wider. Industrial action may take place in the context of a labour dispute or may be meant to effect political or social change. This form of communication tends to be their only means to voice their concerns about safety and benefits.

== Types ==
* Blue flu
* General strike (mass strike)
* Occupation of factories
* Overtime ban
* Picketing
* Slowdown (or Go-slow)
* Strike
* Work-to-rule

<text>The High Level Architecture (HLA) is a standard for distributed simulation, used when building a simulation for a larger purpose by combining (federating) several simulations. The standard was developed in the 1990s under the leadership of the US Department of Defense and was later transitioned to become an open international IEEE standard. It is a recommended standard within NATO through STANAG 4603. Today the HLA is used in a number of domains including defense and security and civilian applications.

The purpose of HLA is to enable interoperability and reuse. Key properties of HLA are:
* The ability to connect simulations running on different computers, locally or widely distributed, independent of their operating system and implementation language, into one Federation.
* Ability to specify and use information exchange data models, Federation Object Models (FOMs), for different application domains.
* Services for exchanging information using a publish-subscribe mechanism, based on the FOM, and with additional filtering options.
* Services for coordinating logical (simulation) time and time-stamped data exchange.
* Management services for inspecting and adjusting the state of a Federation.

HLA forms the basis for developing standardized and extendable FOMs in different communities, for example in aerospace and defense.

The architecture specifies the following components.

* A Run-time Infrastructure (RTI) that provides a standardized set of services through different programming languages. These services include information exchange, synchronization and federation management
* Federates that are individual simulation systems using RTI services.
* A Federation Object Model (FOM) that specifies the Object Classes and Interaction Classes used to exchange data. The FOM can describe information for any domain.

Together the above components form a Federation.

The HLA standard consists of three parts:

# IEEE Std 1516-2010 Framework and Rules, which specifies ten architectural rules that the components or the entire federation shall adhere to.
# IEEE Std 1516.1-2010 Federate Interface Specification, which specifies the services that shall be provided by the RTI. The services are provided as C++ and Java APIs as well as Web Services.
# IEEE Std 1516.2-2010 Object Model Template Specification, which specifies the format that HLA object models, such as the FOM, shall use.

== History and versions ==
HLA was initiated in the early 1990s when Dr. Anita K. Jones, the Director of Defense Research and Engineering within the US Department of Defense, gave the Defense Modeling and Simulation Office (DMSO) the task of âassuring interoperability and reusability of defense models and simulationsâ. In 1995 DMSO formulated a vision for modeling and simulation and established a modeling and simulation masterplan, which included the High Level Architecture.

Two protocols for M&amp;S interoperability already existed: Distributed Interactive Simulation (DIS), focusing on real-time platform level simulation with a fixed object model, and Aggregate Level Simulation Protocol (ALSP) focusing on simulation of aggregate with time management, ownership management and flexible object models, called confederation models. The purpose of HLA was to provide one unified standard that would meet the simulation interoperability requirements of all US DoD components.

The development of HLA was based on four prototypical federations: the Platform Prototype Federation, the Joint Training Protofederation, the Analysis Protofederation and the Engineering Prototype Federation. The HLA specification was prototyped and refined, until HLA 1.3 was finally released. To facilitate usage outside of the defense community, HLA was then transitioned into an IEEE standard, maintained by Simulation Interoperability Standards Organization (SISO). To facilitate the migration for DIS users, a Federation Object Model corresponding to the fixed object model of DIS was also developed as the Real-time Platform Reference FOM (RPR FOM).

The following HLA versions exist:

=== HLA 1.3 ===
HLA 1.3 was published in March 1998 by DMSO. It consists of: 
* U.S. Department of Defense, Rules Version 1.3
* U.S. Department of Defense, High Level Architecture Interface Specification Version 1.3
* U.S. Department of Defense, High Level Architecture Object Model Template Version 1.3

The US DoD also published interpretations for HLA 1.3:
* U.S. Department of Defense, Interpretations of the High Level Architecture Interface Specification Version 1.3, Release 3

=== HLA 1516-2000 ===
HLA IEEE 1516-2000 was published in 2000 by IEEE. It consists of:
* IEEE Std 1516â2000 â Standard for Modeling and Simulation High Level Architecture â Framework and Rules
* IEEE Std 1516.1â2000 â Standard for Modeling and Simulation High Level Architecture â Federate Interface Specification
* IEEE 1516.1â2000 Errata (2003-oct-16)
* IEEE 1516.2-2000 â Standard for Modeling and Simulation High Level Architecture â Object Model Template (OMT) Specification

Major improvements in IEEE 1516-2000 included an XML-based FOM with detailed data type specifications, as well as an improved DDM design.

The IEEE 1516-2000 standard was also complemented by a recommended development process as well as a recommended VV&amp;A process:
* IEEE 1516.3-2003 â Recommended Practice for High Level Architecture Federation Development and Execution Process (FEDEP). This standard would later become IEEE Std 1730-2010 Distributed Simulation Engineering and Execution Process (DSEEP)
* IEEE 1516.4-2007 â Recommended Practice for Verification, Validation, and Accreditation of a Federation an Overlay to the High Level Architecture Federation Development and Execution Process

It was soon found that the 1516-2000 standard had APIs that were slightly different for each RTI implementation. SISO produced a standard with alternate, dynamic link compatible (DLC) C++ and Java APIs:

* SISO-STD-004.1-2004: Standard for Dynamic Link Compatible HLA API Standard for the HLA Interface Specification (IEEE 1516.1 Version)
* SISO-STD-004-2004: Standard for Dynamic Link Compatible HLA API Standard for the HLA Interface Specification (v1.3)

The DLC APIs were later merged into the main standard.

=== HLA 1516-2010 (HLA Evolved) ===
The IEEE 1516-2010 standard was published in August 2010 by IEEE and is commonly known as HLA Evolved. It consists of:
* IEEE 1516â2010 â Standard for Modeling and Simulation High Level Architecture â Framework and Rules
* IEEE 1516.1â2010 â Standard for Modeling and Simulation High Level Architecture â Federate Interface Specification
* IEEE 1516.2-2010 â Standard for Modeling and Simulation High Level Architecture â Object Model Template (OMT) Specification

Major improvements in IEEE 1516-2010 include Modular FOMs, incorporation of the DLC APIs in C++ and Java, a Web Services API and Fault Tolerance.

Machine-readable parts of this version of HLA, such as XML Schemas, C++, Java and WSDL APIs as well as FOM/SOM samples can be downloaded from the IEEE 1516 download area of the IEEE web site. The full standards texts are available at no cost to SISO members or can be purchased from the IEEE shop.

=== HLA 1516-20XX (HLA 4) ===
The development of a new version of HLA started in January 2016 by SISO and is currently ongoing.

== Technical overview ==
The HLA standard consists of three parts:

* Framework and Rules, which specifies ten architectural rules that federates or the entire federation shall adhere to.
* Federate Interface Specification, which specifies the services that shall be provided by the RTI. The services are provided as C++ and Java APIs as well as Web Services.
* Object Model Template Specification which specifies the format that HLA object models, such as the FOM, shall use.

=== Common HLA terminology ===

* Run-time Infrastructure (RTI): Software that provides a standardized set of services, as specified in the HLA Federate Interface Specification. There are seven service groups.
* Federate: A system, such as a simulation, a tool or an interface to live systems, that connects to the RTI. Examples of tools are data loggers and management tools. A federate uses the RTI services to exchange data and synchronize with other federates.
* Federation: A set of federates that connect to the same RTI together with a common FOM.
* Federation Execution: A session, where a set of federates execute together in a federation with a specific objective, using the same RTI and FOM.
* Federation Object Model (FOM): A document that specifies object classes, interaction classes, data types and additional data that is used for the information exchange in a federation. A FOM is an XML file that follows the format of the HLA Object Model Template and the associated XML Schema. Different FOMs are used for exchanging data for different application domains. There are standardized FOMs, called reference FOMs, that are commonly used as a starting point for FOM development. A FOM can be developed and extended in a modular way using FOM modules.
* Simulation Object Model (SOM): A document that specifies object classes, interaction classes, data types and additional data that a particular simulation publishes and/or subscribes to in a federation. A SOM is also an XML file that follows the format of the HLA Object Model Template and the associated XML Schema. SOMs can also be developed and extended in a modular way using SOM modules.
* Object: Objects are used to represent data that is persistent over some period of time and that have attributes that can be updated. They are defined in the FOM/SOM using an Object Class.
* Interaction: Interaction are used to represent instantaneous events with parameters. An interaction that has been sent cannot be updated (as opposed to object classes). They are defined in the FOM/SOM using an Interaction Class.
* Datatypes: The representation and interpretation of attribute and parameter data is specified in the FOM/SOM using HLA Datatypes.
* Publish: A federate that publishes an object class with a set of attributes can register and delete instances of that object class and update its attribute values. A federate that publishes an interaction class can send interactions of that interaction class, together with associated parameter values.
* Subscribe: A federate that subscribes to an object class with a set of attributes will discover registrations and deletions of instances of that object class and receive updates of subscribed attributes. A federate that subscribes to an interaction class will receive interactions of that interaction class, together with associated parameter values.

== Interface specification ==
The RTI services are defined in the HLA Interface Specification. They are grouped into seven service groups. In addition to these services, the Management Object Model (MOM) provides services that makes it possible to inspect and adjust the state of the federation programmatically.

Most RTIs consist of a Central RTI Component (CRC), which is an executable and Local RTI Components (LRCs), which are libraries that are used by the federates. Services are provided through a C++ or Java API and also using Web services. In the C++ and Java APIs, services are invoked using calls to an instance of the RTI Ambassador class. The RTI delivers information to a federate using callbacks, which are delivered using calls to an instance of the Federate Ambassador class. In the Web Services API, defined using WSDL, calls are made, and callbacks are fetched, by the federate using Web Services requests and responses.

The service group descriptions below focus on key services. Exceptions and advisories are not included.

===Federation Management Services===
The purpose of Federation Management services, described in chapter 4 of the HLA Interface Specification, is to manage Federation Executions as well as federation-wide operations such as Synchronization Points and Save/Restore.

One set of Federation Management services manages the connection to the RTI, the federation execution and the set of joined federates. Key services are:

* Connect and Disconnect from the RTI
* CreateFederationExecution and DestroyFederationExecution that are used to create and destroy a federation execution
* JoinFederationExecution and ResignFederationExecution that are used by a federate to join and resign a federation execution.
* ConnectionLost, that is used by the RTI to inform a federate that it has lost its connection to the federation execution due to a fault
* ListFederationExecutions that is used to retrieve a list of available federation executions for an RTI

Another set of services relates to synchronization points. These are federation-wide events where all, or selected federates are required to complete an operation, such as initializing a scenario, before the execution can continue. Key services are:

* RegisterFederationSynchronizationPoint that is used to register a synchronization point 
* AnnounceSynchronizationPoint that is used by the RTI to inform federates that a synchronization point has been registered
* SynchronizationPointAchieved that is used by a federate to indicate that it has achieved a synchronization point
* FederationSynchronized that is used by the RTI to Inform federates that the federation is synchronized, i.e. all federates have achieved the synchronization point.

Yet another set of service relates to saving and restoring a federation execution. A save operation requires both the RTI and each federate to perform a save of their internal state. A restore operation requires both the RTI and each federate to perform a restore of their internal state. Key services are:

Save:
* RequestFederationSave that is used to initiate a save of a federation
* InitiateFederateSave that is used by the RTI to notify federates to start saving its state
* FederateSaveComplete that shall be called by a federate when it has completed saving its state.
* FederationSaved that is used by the RTI to notify federates that the federation is saved

Restore:
* RequestFederationRestore that is used to initiate a restore of a federation
* InitiateFederateRestore that is used by the RTI to notify federates to start restoring its state
* FederateRestoreComplete that shall be called by a federate when it has completed restoring its state.
* FederationRestored that is used by the RTI to notify federates that the federation is restored

===Declaration Management Services===
The purpose of Declaration Management services, described in chapter 5 of the HLA Interface Specification, is to enable federates to declare what information they wish to publish (send) and subscribe to (receive) based on object and interaction classes in the FOM. The RTI uses this information to route updates and interactions to subscribing federates. For an object class, publishing and subscribing are performed for a specific set of attributes. For interaction classes, the entire interaction, including all parameters, is published and subscribed. Key services are:

* PublishObjectClassAttributes that is used to publish a set of attributes for a given object class.
* SubscribeObjectClassAttributes that is used to subscribe to a set of attributes for a given object class.
* PublishInteractionClass that is used to publish an interaction class including all parameters
* SubscribeInteractionClass that is used to subscribe to an interaction class including all parameters

===Object Management Services===
The purpose of Object Management services, described in chapter 6 of the HLA Interface Specification, is to enable federates to share information about object instances and to exchange interactions.

Object instance names can be reserved or be automatically generated. Federates can register object instances of specified object classes, that are then discovered by subscribing federates. Attributes of these object instances can be updated. These updates will be reflected to subscribing federates. Interactions can be sent. These interactions will be delivered to subscribing federates. Key services are:

Objects:
* ReserveObjectInstanceName that is used to reserve a name to be used for an object instance
* RegisterObjectInstance that is used to register an object instance of a particular object class, either with a reserved name or an automatically generated name.
* DiscoverObjectInstance that is used by the RTI to notify federates subscribing to particular object class that a new object instance has been registered.
* DeleteObjectInstance that is used to delete an object instance
* RemoveObjectInstances that is used by the RTI to notify federates that an object instance has been removed

Attributes:
* UpdateAttributeValues that is used to provide updated attribute values for an object instance
* ReflectAttributeValues that is used by the RTI to notify federates subscribing to particular attributes of updated values.

Interactions:
* SendInteraction that is used to send an interaction of a particular interaction class, including parameter values.
* ReceiveInteraction that is used by the RTI to deliver an interaction, including parameter values, to federates subscribing to a particular interaction class

===Ownership Management Services===
The purpose of Ownership Management services, described in chapter 7 of the HLA Interface Specification, is to dynamically manage what federate that simulates what aspect of an object instance. In HLA, only one federate is allowed to update a given attribute of a given object instance. That federate is considered the owner of the attribute. A federate that registers a new object instance will automatically be the owner of all attributes it publishes. In some cases, attributes of an object instance may become unowned, i.e. not owned by any federate.

Ownership management provides services for transferring ownership of one or several attributes at runtime, which can include a federate Divesting the attribute and another federate Acquiring the attribute. There are two main patterns: âpullâ that are initiated by the acquiring federate and âpushâ that are initiated by the divesting federate.

Key services for initiating âpullâ ownership are:
* AttributeOwnershipAcquisitionIfAvailable which is used by a federate that wishes to acquire ownership of unowned attributes. 
* AttributeOwnershipAcquisition which is used by a federate that wishes to request ownership of a potentially owned attribute

Key services for initiating âpushâ ownership are:
* AttributeOwnershipDivestitureIfWanted which is used by a federate that wishes to divest attributes only if there is some other federate that is standing by to acquire ownership of these attributes. 
* NegotiatedAttributeOwnershipDivestiture, which is similar but may also cause the RTI to try to find a new owner. 
* UnconditionalAttributeOwnershipDivestiture, which is used by a federate that wishes to give up ownership, even if no new owner can be found.

All object instances have a predefined attribute called HLAPrivilegeToDeleteObject. Only the owner of this attribute for an object instance is allowed to delete the object instance. Ownership of this attribute can be transferred at runtime using the above operations.

===Time Management Services===
The information exchange in an HLA federation takes place in real-time with immediate (Receive Order, RO) delivery of messages, unless HLA Time Management has been enabled. The purpose of HLA Time Management, described in chapter 8 of the HLA Interface Specification, is to guarantee causality and a correct and consistent exchange of time stamped messages (updates and interactions) in Time Stamp Order (TSO), no matter if the federation executes in real-time, faster-than-real-time, slower-than-real-time or as-fast-as-possible.

Some important concepts in HLA Time Management are:

Logical time: A time axis in HLA, starting at zero. Logical time is used for Time Management timestamps and operations. The logical time axis can be mapped to the scenario time of the federation. An example of such a mapping is to let zero represent the scenario time 8:00 of the 1-Jan-1066 and let an increment by one represent one second of the scenario.

Lookahead: A time interval specifying the lowest time in the future for which a federate will produce messages. For a federate with a fixed time step, this is usually the length of the time step.

Granted: A federate is granted (allowed to advance) to a particular logical time by the RTI, when all time-stamped messages up to that time have been delivered. The federate can then safely start calculating messages with a timestamp in the future. This timestamp may not be earlier than the granted time plus the federates lookahead.

Advancing: When a federate has finished producing data for the granted time plus the lookahead, it may request to be advanced to a later time, which also means that it promises not to produce any more messages with a time stamp less than the requested time plus the lookahead. The federate is now in the advancing state.

Time Regulating: A federate that sends time stamped events is considered Time Regulating since the time advance by other federates may be regulated by this.

Time Constrained: A federate that receives time managed events is considered Time Constrained since the reception of time stamped messages, constrains its time advance.

The main principles of HLA Time Management are that:
* Each time-regulating federate assigns a time stamp to messages (updates and interactions) when they are sent, indicating the scenario time at which the message is valid. 
* The RTI manages delivery of messages to time-constrained federates, with messages from time-regulating federates delivered at the appropriate time using a Time Stamp Order queue.
* Time-constrained federates request permission from the RTI to advance their time.
* The RTI grants a time advance to a time-constrained federates when it is sure that the federate cannot receive a message with a time stamp in its past.

Example of Lookahead, granted and advancing:
# A federate uses a fixed time step of 10 and has a Lookahead of 10.
# The federate is granted to logical time 50 by the RTI. The RTI thus guarantees that all messages with time step less or equal to 50 have been delivered to the federate.
# The federate now has all the necessary data to correctly calculate and send messages for the granted time plus Lookahead, i.e. 60. 
# When the federate has sent all messages with timestamp 60, it requests to be advanced to time 60. It thereby promises not to send any messages with a timestamp less than 70. 
# The RTI delivers all messages with timestamp less or equal to 60 to the federate. It then grants the federate to time 60.
# Etc.

If at least one federate in the federation performs pacing, i.e. correlates their time advance requests with a real time clock, the federation may run in real time or scaled real time. Without pacing, the federation will run as fast as possible (e.g., federations that do not require human interaction at runtime nor interfaces with systems that depend upon a real-time clock can run as fast as computing resources will allow).

Key services include:
* EnableTimeConstrained and EnableTimeRegulating that enables theses modes for a federate
* TimeAdvanceRequest whereby a federate requests to be advanced to a specified logical time
* TimeAdvancedGrant whereby the RTI informs a federate that it is granted to a specified logical time.
* EnableAsynchronousDelivery that enables delivery of Receive Order messages both when a federate is in the granted and advancing state.

For event driven simulation it is also possible for a federate to request to be advanced to the next event using the following service:

* NextMessageRequest whereby a federate requests to be advanced to the timestamp of the next message due for delivery to the federate, or a specified logical time, whichever has a lower timestamp.

Another important concept is Greatest Available Logical Time (GALT). The greatest time that each federate can be granted to, depends on the time that other federates have been granted to as well as their lookahead. The GALT for a federate specifies how far a federate can be granted, without having to wait for other federates to be granted. This is particularly interesting for a federate that joins late into a time managed federation.

Key services for GALT are:
* QueryGALT that returns the GALT for the calling federate.

More advanced services include:
* FlushQueueRequest whereby a federate can request delivery of all queued, timestamped messages, no matter how far in the future their timestamp is.
* Retract whereby a federate can request that an already sent message is retracted. This is useful in optimistic simulation.

===Data Distribution Management Services (DDM)===
The purpose of DDM, described in chapter 9 of the HLA Interface Specification, is to increase scalability of federations by performing additional filtering of subscribed data beyond class and attribute subscriptions. Filtering can be based on continuous values (like latitude and longitude) or discrete values (like car brand).

Key concepts of DDM are:

Dimension: a named interval (0..n) used for filtering, with values starting with 0 and ending with an upper bound n. Data in the simulation domain is mapped to one or more dimensions. For example, dimensions for geographical filtering could be LatitudeDimension and LongitudeDimension. A dimension for filtering based on car brand could be CarBrandDimension.

Normalization function: a function that maps input values to integer values to be used in a dimension. An example is that a normalization function for the LatitudeDimension could map a latitude value ranging from -90.0 to +90.0 to an integer in the range 0..179. A normalization function for the CarBrandDimension could map a set of car brands Kia, Ford, BMW and Peugeot to an integer in the range 0..3.

Range: an interval on a dimension, specified by a lower bound (inclusive) and an upper bound (exclusive).

Region: a set of ranges, each one relating to a particular dimension. In the above example, a region could consist of the range (3..5) for LatitudeDimension (55..65) for LongitudeDimension and (0..1) for the CarBrandDimension. At runtime Region Realizations (objects) are instantiated to represent regions. The ranges of a region can be modified over time.

Region overlap: two regions overlap if, for all dimensions that they have in common, their ranges overlap.

At runtime, a federate can provide Regions when subscribing to object class attributes and interactions. Regions are also used when sending attribute updates and interactions. When DDM is used, attribute updates and interactions will only be delivered if there is a region overlap.

Key services for Regions are:
* CreateRegion that is used to create a region with a specified set of Dimensions.
* DeleteRegion that is used to delete a region.
* CommitRegionModifications that is used to change the ranges of a dimension for a Region.

Key services for exchanging attribute updates with DDM are:
* RegisterObjectInstanceWithRegions that is used to register an object instance with regions associated with its attributes.
* AssociateRegionsForUpdates that is used to associate regions with attributes of an object instance.
* SubscribeObjectClassAttributesWithRegions that is used to subscribing to attributes of objects where the regions used for subscription overlaps with the regions of the attributes.

Key services for exchanging interactions with DDM are:
* SubscribeInteractionClassWithRegions that is used to subscribe to interactions where the regions used for subscription overlaps with the regions of the interactions.
* SendInteractionsWithRegions that is used to send interactions with associated regions.

===Support services===
The HLA Support Services, described in chapter 10 of the HLA Interface Specification, provide a number of supporting services. These include:
* Getting Handles (references) to be used in the above service calls.
* Setting various runtime switches, in particular for advisories (notifications).
* Controlling the delivery of callbacks.

=== Management Object Model===
The purpose of the Management Object Model, described in chapter 11 of the HLA Interface Specification, is to provide services for managing a federation. This is performed using the MOM object and interaction classes. MOM objects are defined in a special FOM module called the MIM, that is automatically loaded by the RTI. Key MOM features include:
* List and inspect properties of federates.
* Inspect properties of the federation.
* Get the content of the current FOM and FOM modules.
* Inspect the state of Time management.
* Inspect and modify publications and subscriptions of federates.
* Inspect certain performance figures.
* Inspect which federate that calls which HLA services.
* Inspect status of synchronization points.

==Object model template (OMT)==
The OMT is a template used for describing Federation Object Models (FOMs) and Simulation Object Models (SOMs). FOMs and SOMs can be represented in a tabular format or using XML. The latter format is used when a FOM is loaded into the RTI.

In earlier versions of HLA, FOMs were monolithic, but the current version of the standard supports modular FOMs, i.e. several modules, covering different aspects of the information exchange, can be provided to the RTI.

A number of predefined classes, datatypes, dimensions and transportation types are provided in the standard. These are provided in the HLAstandardMIM.xml FOM module. Predefined concepts are prefixed with HLA, for example HLAobjectRoot and HLAunicodeString.

There are three different XML Schemas for the OMT:
* The OMT DIF XML Schema, that verifies that an OMT document follows the basic OMT format, but not that it is complete and has referential integrity.
* The OMT FDD XML Schema, that verifies that an OMT document contains enough information to be useful by an RTI. Note that this schema is provided in the Interface Specification.
* The OMT Conformance Schema that verifies that an OMT document is complete and has referential integrity.

===Identification Table===
The purpose of the identification table is to provide meta-data about the model, to facilitate reuse of the FOM/SOM or federates. 

The following fields are specified:

* General: Name, Type (FOM/SOM), Version, Modification date, Security classification, Release restriction, Purpose, Application domain, Description, Use limitation and Use history
* Keywords: Keyword values and Taxonomy used
* Point of contacts (POC): Type (Primary author/Contributor/Proponent/Sponsor/Release Authority/Technical POC), POC name, POC organization, POC telephone, POC email
* References: Type (Text document/Spreadsheet/Powerpoint file/Standalone FOM/Dependency FOM/Composed from FOM), Identification (document name or FOM name)
* Other
* Glyph (Icon)

===Object Classes Structure Table===
The purpose of the object class structure table is to specify the class hierarchy (subclass/superclass) of the object classes that are used to instantiate objects in an HLA federation. Object class attributes are inherited from superclasses to subclasses based on this hierarchy. The root of the object class tree is known as HLAobjectRoot. An example of a fully qualified name of an object class is HLAobjectRoot.Car.ElectricCar
The following fields are specified for an object class in the hierarchy:
* Name
* Publication (Publish/Subscribe/PublishSubscribe/Neither)

===Attribute Table===
The purpose of the attribute table is to specify the attributes that are available for a given object class. Since attributes are inherited, an object class will have the union of all attributes that are locally defined on the object class or specified on any direct or indirect superclass. 
The following fields are specified for an attribute
* Object class name, for which it is defined
* Attribute name
* Datatype, defined in the Datatypes Table (see below)
* Update type (Static/Periodic/Conditional/NA)
* Update condition
* D/A (Divest/Acquire/NoTransfer/DivestAcquire): Whether the attribute can be divested and or acquired using the HLA Ownership Services
* P/S (Publish/Subscribe/PublishSubscribe/Neither): Whether the attribute can be published and/or subscribed. In a SOM, this information relates to the Federate described, in a FOM it relates to the entire federation.
* Available Dimensions
* Transportation (Reliable/BestEffort/other transportations described in the Transportation table)
* Order (Receive/TimeStamp): Delivery order for attribute updates.

===Interaction Class Structure Table===
The purpose of the interaction class structure table is to specify the class hierarchy (subclass/superclass) of the interaction classes that are used to exchange interactions in an HLA federation. Interaction class parameters are inherited from superclasses to subclasses based on this hierarchy. The root of the interaction class tree is known as HLAinteractionRoot. An example of a fully qualified name of an interaction class is HLAinteractionRoot.CarCommand.Start.
The following fields are specified for an interaction class in the hierarchy:
* Name
* Publication (Publish/Subscribe/PublishSubscribe/Neither)

===Parameter Table===
The purpose of the parameter table is to specify the parameters that are available for a given interaction class. Since parameters are inherited, an interaction class will have the union of all parameters that are locally defined on the interaction class or specified on any direct or indirect superclass.

===Dimensions table===
The purpose of the dimensions table is to specify the DDM dimensions, used for attributes and interaction classes.

===Time representation table===
The purpose of the time representation table is to specify the datatypes used by the Time Management services.

===User-supplied tag table===
A user-supplied tag can be supplied when calling certain HLA services. The purpose of the user-supplied tag table is to specify the datatypes of these tags.

===Synchronization table===
The purpose of the synchronization table is to specify the synchronisation points used in a federation.

===Transportation type table===
The purpose of the transportation type table is to specify the available transportation types. There are two predefined transportation types: HLAreliable and HLAbestEffort.

===Update rate table===
The purpose of the update rate table is to specify the available maximum update rates.

===Switches table===
The runtime behaviour of the RTI can be controlled using a number of predefined switches. The purpose of the switches table is to provide initial values for these switches. Some of the switches can also be updated at runtime.

===Datatypes===
The purpose of the datatype tables is to provide specifications of the datatypes used for attributes, parameters, dimensions, time representation, user supplied tag and synchronization points. There are six categories of datatypes, with a separate tabular format for each of them.

====Basic Data Representation Table====
The purpose of the basic data representation table is to provide binary representations for use in other tables. A number of predefined basic datatypes are provided in the HLA standard: HLAinteger16BE, HLAinteger32BE, HLAinteger64BE, HLAfloat32BE, HLAfloat64BE, HLAoctetPairBE, HLAinteger16LE, HLAinteger32LE, HLAinteger64LE, HLAfloat32LE, HLAfloat64LE, HLAoctetPairLE and HLAoctet. The set of basic datatypes is usually not extended with user defined basic datatypes.

====Simple Datatypes Table====

The purpose of the simple datatypes table is to describe simple scalar data items. A number of predefined simple datatypes are provided in the HLA standard: HLAASCIIchar, HLAunicodeChar, HLAbyte, HLAinteger64time and HLAfloat64time. It is common to include user defined simple datatypes in a FOM.

====Enumerated Datatypes Table====

The purpose of the enumerated datatypes table is to describe data elements that can take on a finite discrete set of values. One predefined enumerated datatype is provided in the standard: HLAboolean. It is common to include user defined enumerated datatypes in a FOM.

====Array Datatypes Table====

The purpose of the enumerated datatypes table is to describe arrays of data elements (simple, enumerated, arrays, fixed records or variant records). A number of predefined simple datatypes are provided in the HLA standard: HLAASCIIstring, HLAunicodeString, HLAopaqueData and HLAtoken. It is common to include user defined array datatypes in a FOM.

====Fixed Record Datatypes Table====

The purpose of the fixed record datatypes table is to describe records with a fixed set of data elements (simple, enumerated, arrays, fixed records or variant records).

====Variant Record Datatypes Table====
The purpose of the variant record datatypes table is to describe records that may contain different, predefined sets of data elements. The different sets are called Alternatives. Which alternative that applies for a given variant record is indicated by a data element called the Discriminant.

===Notes table===
The purpose of the notes table is to provide annotations and additional descriptions of items in other tables.

==HLA rules==
The HLA rules describe the responsibilities of federations and the federates that join.

# Federations shall have an HLA federation object model (FOM), documented in accordance with the HLA object model template (OMT).
# In a federation, all representation of objects in the FOM shall be in the federates, not in the run-time infrastructure (RTI).
# During a federation execution, all exchange of FOM data among federates shall occur via the RTI.
# During a federation execution, federates shall interact with the run-time infrastructure (RTI) in accordance with the HLA interface specification.
# During a federation execution, an attribute of an instance of an object shall be owned by only one federate at any given time.
# Federates shall have an HLA simulation object model (SOM), documented in accordance with the HLA object model template (OMT).
# Federates shall be able to update and/or reflect any attributes of objects in their SOM and send and/or receive SOM object interactions externally, as specified in their SOM.
# Federates shall be able to transfer and/or accept ownership of an attribute dynamically during a federation execution, as specified in their SOM.
# Federates shall be able to vary the conditions under which they provide updates of attributes of objects, as specified in their SOM.
# Federates shall be able to manage local time in a way that will allow them to coordinate data exchange with other members of a federation.

==HLA Evolved==
The IEEE 1516 standard has been revised under the SISO HLA-Evolved Product Development Group and was approved 25-Mar-2010 by the IEEE Standards Activities Board. The revised IEEE 1516â2010 standard includes current DoD standard interpretations and the EDLC API, an extended version of the SISO DLC API. Other major improvements include:

* Extended XML support for FOM/SOM, such as Schemas and extensibility
* Fault tolerance support services
* Web Services (WSDL) support/API
* Modular FOMs
* Update rate reduction
* Encoding helpers
* Extended support for additional transportation (such as QoS, IPv6...)
* Standardized time representations

==Federation Conformance==
In order to ensure the proper interaction between simulations, a way of testing federate conformance is defined. This involves ensuring that every class and interaction listed in the SOM for a particular federate is used according to the usage described, &quot;PublishSubscribe&quot;, &quot;Publish&quot;, &quot;Subscribe&quot; or &quot;None&quot;.

== STANAG 4603==
HLA (in both the current IEEE 1516 version and its ancestor &quot;1.3&quot; version) is the subject of the NATO standardization agreement (STANAG 4603) for modeling and simulation: &quot;Modeling And Simulation Architecture Standards For Technical Interoperability: High Level Architecture (HLA)&quot;.

The Base Object Model (BOM), SISO-STD-003-2006 is a related standard by SISO to provide better reuse and composability for HLA simulations. It provides a way to specify conceptual models and how to map them to an HLA FOM.

==Alternatives==
In regards to the Distributed Modeling and Simulation (DM&amp;S) industry the most often used alternative to the HLA, for real-time simulation of military platforms, is Distributed Interactive Simulation (DIS), IEEE 1278.1-2012, a simulation protocol. Most HLA RTI vendors also feature DIS in their products. As for middleware applications that most closely match HLA features, such as
the publish and subscribe feature (P&amp;S) see Data Distribution Service (DDS) which shares many of the same characteristics but having an open on-the-wire protocol for system interoperability.

==Criticism==
HLA is a Message-oriented middleware that defines as a set of services, provided by a C++ or Java API. There is no standardized on-the-wire protocol. Participants in a federation must use RTI libraries from the same provider and usually also of the same version, which in some cases is perceived as a drawback. Most current tools also provide interconnectivity through sockets.

<doc id="838840" wikidata="Q745175" url="?curid=838840" title="Spilsby">
<text>Spilsby is a market town and civil parish in the East Lindsey district of Lincolnshire, England. The town is adjacent to the main A16, east of Lincoln, north-east of Boston and north-west of Skegness. It lies at the southern edge of the Lincolnshire Wolds and north of the Fenlands.

The town has been a rural market town for more than 700 years. It has changed little in size since the beginning of the 19th century. The town centre includes a range of small supermarkets, banks, traditional newsagents, baker, butchers, jewellers and clothing stores, together with public houses, cafes and fast-food takeaways.

At the centre of town is an open square or traditional market place, from which the four main town streets radiate. Markets take place on a Monday. As Spilsby is located within a predominantly agricultural area, much of the market produce consists of locally grown vegetables and meat.

The population of the town was 2,336 in the 2001 census, increasing to 3,045 at the 2011 Census.

==History==

===Early history===
The area has been occupied by humans since prehistoric times. Evidence for this can be found at nearby West Keal, where an Iron Age hill fort and defensive terraced earthworks were built at the tip of the Wolds promontory, overlooking the present town.

The Spilsby area was visited and occupied by the Romans during the 1st century and held by them until the 4th century AD. During the 1960s, an archaeological dig and field walk at nearby Keal Cotes, in a large field south of the village (where the A16 meets Hagnaby Lane), discovered tessellated mosaic floor tiles and roof tiles. These indicated that a substantial Roman villa or high-status Romano-British farmhouse once stood on the site. The recorded finds from the site are stored at the Museum of Lincolnshire Life in Lincoln, Lincolnshire. In 1849 six Roman funeral urns were dug up in nearby Fulletby.

Spilsby was probably named before or no later than the 9th-century period of Danish rule, which had extended for centuries. It derives from the term &quot;Spila&#x27;s-by&quot;, where &quot;by&quot; is old Old Norse for &quot;place of dwelling&quot;. Hence, it meant &quot;Spila&#x27;s village&quot;, Spila (pronounced &quot;Spiller&quot;) having been the local Viking warlord or chieftain, who acted as head of the immediate area. The town was recorded in the Domesday Book of 1086 as &quot;Spilesbei&quot;. In 1082 it was not much more than a large farmstead and few surrounding crofts under the squireship of the Bishop of Durham.

In 1255 a charter was granted to a John de Beke (or John Beck) to hold a weekly market in Spilsby each Monday and a three-day annual fair in July. Four years later, in 1259, the same John de Beke was granted a further charter to hold a three-day Christmas fair from 5â8 December. The next recorded charter to hold a weekly Monday market in the town and an annual fair in July was granted in 1302 to the Lord of the Manor, Norman noble Robert de Willoughby. A copy of this charter is in the parish church.

At the east end of the town centre&#x27;s marketplace stands a medieval buttercross monument. The architectural historian Nikolaus Pevsner suggests that the Spilsby Buttercross dates from as early as the 14th and certainly no later than the 16th century. The stepped bases of these monuments were used by early traders on market day to display their goods, usually milk, cheeses and butter.

Standing in the centre of the marketplace is the Old Town Hall. More recently it has been used as a store and petrol station. In the 18th century the town civic offices, a small courtroom, and the town gaol, were in the upstairs level supported by the arches. The ground level was an open covered space used as the local corn exchange and for stalls by market traders that were protected from the weather.

===The Manor of Eresby===
An oft-repeated historical myth is that the Manor of Eresby, including the lands and parish of Spilsby, was awarded to Walter de Beke, sometime after 1083, by William the Conqueror. This myth is one of several generated in the writings of William Dugdale. However, the Domesday Book of 1086 shows that the manor of Spilsby was held in 1086 by the Bishop of Durham (St Cuthbert&#x27;s) as both Lord and tenant-in-chief. The only Domesday entry for Walter of Bec is as Lord of Singleborough, under Walter Giffard, the tenant-in-chief.

Other sources indicate that another Walter de Bec, who may or may not be related to the aforementioned Walter, married Agnes of Tattershall, daughter of Hugh, son of Pinco FitzEudo. She brought Spilsby, and the Manor of Eresby, with her, those lands being gifted to her by William I.

The manor was held by the Beke family until the male line died out, leaving Alice, the daughter of John Beke, 1st Baron Beke of Eresby, and the sole heiress of Walter, 2nd Baron Beke de Eresby, her brother who died in about 1310. The manor passed to Robert de Willoughby by way of his father William de Willoughby&#x27;s marriage to Alice de Beke in about 1254. The Willoughby family originated in nearby Willoughby in the Marsh. In 1313, Robert was summoned to parliament as the first Baron Willoughby de Eresby, a family line that continues to the 28th Baroness Willoughby de Eresby.

The original manor house from the 14th century stood near the site of the later mansion. It was probably demolished when the new manor was built. During excavations in the mid-1960s, fragments of the earlier dwelling were discovered. Many examples of medieval and post-medieval pottery shards were recovered from the site of the Eresby Manor&#x27;s moat by archeologist E. H. Rudkin in 1966.
The new Eresby manor house was built by Charles Brandon, 1st Duke of Suffolk, in 1535. He acquired the property after marrying his ward, the fifteen-year-old Catherine Willoughby, daughter and heiress of the William, 11th Baron Willoughby de Eresby.

In 1769, the Manor House was destroyed by fire during the stewardship of the 19th Baron, who was also Duke of Ancaster and Kesteven. It is believed that a carpenter accidentally started a fire with his candle while he was working in the roof space. A 1771 plan shows that the house was built in an &#x27;H&#x27; shape. The plan also shows details of the grounds, which included an orangery, cherry orchard, bowling green, dovecote, and an ash grove, all near to the house. The Manor House had originally been moated, but by 1771 the moat had been adapted as an ornamental fishing lake.

The Church of England parish church of St James is built of the local Spilsby green sandstone. Parts of it date from the late 14th century, although it has been much added to over the centuries. The church has important funerary monuments. The greenstone is a soft and porous stone that absorbs water. The church was recased in Lancaster stone. It can seat a congregation of around 750. The parish churchyard was closed to further burials when it ran out of available space in 1884.

To mark his inheritance of the title in 1349, the 3rd Baron, Sir John de Willoughby, built a private chapel on his estate. Dedicated to the Holy Trinity, it was endowed with collegiate status, with a master and up to twelve priests. When the head of the family founded the King Edward VI Grammar School in 1550, the school initially had no school building. The twenty or so children were taught in the Eresby chapel building for the next sixty years.

The Willoughby family provided a school house in 1611, by converting an agricultural building on the edge of the estate. In 1839 the school house of 1611 was replaced by a new school building that was constructed on its current site, with funds provided by the 25th Baron, who was the first Earl of Ancaster.

The site of the Manor House was partially excavated in the mid 20th century by archaeologist and folklorist Ethel Rudkin.

===Bolingbroke Castle===
Bolingbroke Castle was built in the nearby parish of Bolingbroke after 1220 by Ranulph de Blondeville, Earl of Chester and Earl of Lincoln. Henry de Bolingbroke, later to become King Henry IV at the age of thirty-two, was born at Bolingbroke Castle in 1366.

The castle was much damaged during the English Civil War and, after the nearby Battle of Winceby in October 1643, only the lower sections of the outer walls remained. The last standing section of the castle, the gatehouse, collapsed in 1815.
Bolingbroke&#x27;s original walls, also constructed of Spilsby greenstone, were in an irregular hexagon, with round towers on five of the corners. The gatehouse consists of two towers built about 3 yards apart. Leading to a portcullis further inside was a drawbridge that spanned the moat. The moat encircled an area about 87 yards in diameter. The six walls were 6Â½ feet wide and varied in length from 16 to long. There was a small priest door in the rear wall just above the moat water line. The castle garrison was supported and supplied by an important market village outside the castle walls. It included several small farms, a friary and salmon lakes, two mills, and the chantry church of St. Peter &amp; St. Paul.

===Gunby Hall===

According to the dated keystone on the west doorway, Gunby Hall was built in 1700 by Sir Henry Massingberd. The mansion still stands in several acres of landscaped and wooded parkland, including gardens containing a blue gazebo. Locally born Poet Laureate Alfred, Lord Tennyson described it as &quot;an English home... all things in order stored and a haunt of peace&quot;. The original words, written in his own hand, are framed and preserved in the hall&#x27;s library.

During the Second World War, the Air Ministry attempted to build an airfield at Gunby that would have covered the estate and necessitated demolishing the mansion. The then-owner, Field Marshal Sir Archibald Montgomery-Massingberd, personally appealed to King George VI. The Air Ministry relented, redrawing the plans that resulted in building RAF Spilsby further south at Great Steeping. The runway eventually ended only a few yards short of the Gunby estate boundary hedge.

Gunby Hall was one of the first major British mansion houses and estates to be presented to the National Trust in 1944. It is open to the public on limited days of the week during the summer, while remaining a private family residence for the remainder of the year.

===Hundleby===
Hundleby was an ancient parish that fell within Spilsby. It has not changed greatly in size or layout for the past two hundred years. The village population in 1801 was 218, and in 1901 it reached a peak of 528, mostly agricultural farm workers and their families. By 1971 the population had fallen to 439. It has remained fairly stable ever since with only minor fluctuations.

Hundleby&#x27;s Anglican St Mary&#x27;s parish church was rebuilt between 1853 and 1855, and seated around two hundred parishioners. The parish had a long-standing right to send three children to the Raithby parish free school. Hundleby&#x27;s elementary school was built around 1860 and was enlarged in 1884 to accommodate up to 120 children.

Grace Swan Memorial Cottage Hospital was built in Hundleby during the late 19th century as a 25-bed in-patient facility. It was split between charity and private fee-paying wards, with its own operating theatre, maternity unit and resident surgeon. Closed by the local health authority as part of a rationalisation programme during the 1990s, the building is now a local health centre.

Spilsby Poor Law Union group of parishes had a workhouse in Hundleby, built in 1838. The workhouse was recorded in 1870 as having 280 residents. The workhouse was later converted into Spilsby&#x27;s Gables Hospital, which was demolished in the early 21st century for the construction of new housing.

===Spilsby in the 19th century===
In 1833 a new cemetery of approximately one acre was established on Boston Road. &quot;White&#x27;s 1842 Directory&quot; described Spilsby as being &quot;a small, but thriving and well-built market town, pleasantly seated on an eminence, which overlooks an extensive tract of marshes and fens. Eresby is a small hamlet just south of town.&quot;

In 1839 the King Edward VI Grammar School had moved from its original 17th-century school building to a new school built on its current site in Spilsby. The grammar school building was abandoned during the 1990s after the two Spilsby secondary schools had amalgamated as Spilsby High School.

In the mid-19th century, several chapels for nonconformist Methodism were built in the town, including Wesleyan Methodist, Primitive Methodist and Independent Methodists. When the Independents built a new chapel in 1866, they converted their original chapel to a Sunday school. The Wesleyans built a chapel opposite the Buttercross, in Market Place, during 1878.

A prison for the area was built in Spilsby between 1824 and 1826. It occupied a site where Spence Street and West End now stand. The prison covered just over surrounded by a high brick wall and fronted by a courthouse. It was enlarged in 1869 to provide 85 single cells. The prison was demolished in 1876, except for the small front area. This contained the sessions house with a Greek Doric-pillared portico, police station and town lockup. The Sessions House of 1826, where court quarter sessions for the district of Lindsey were held until 1878, is now home to the Spilsby Theatre and Arts Centre.

The town&#x27;s gasworks were constructed in 1853, opening in 1854 on Ashby Road, bringing street and house lighting to the town for the first time. In 1908 the North East Lincolnshire Water Company opened a pumping station in Hundleby, with a 75,000-gallon reservoir on Raithby Hill. It brought tap water to homes in Spilsby for the first time.

In 1892 Spilsby Pavilion opened, with a further room opened in 1896, each room accommodating 300 to 400 people. At the time, the Pavilion was advertised as providing accommodation for &quot;dancing parties and smoking concerts&quot;. The Masonic Lodge and Hall opened on Halton Road in 1913.

The parish had set aside as &quot;poor land&quot;, owning many tenements and the Red Lion public house. Annual rental revenue from these properties, Â£76-5s-0d (Â£76.25) in 1842, was distributed half-yearly among any poor in the parish who did not receive any other financial aid from the town&#x27;s poor rates. As a result of the 1834 Poor Law Amendment Act, the parish became part of the Spilsby Poor Law Union, which covered 33 local parishes.

===Railway connections===

A small local railway company built a branch line from Firsby junction to Spilsby, which opened on 1 May 1868. The branch was just over long and connected Spilsby to the King&#x27;s Cross, London to Cleethorpes main line. The only other railway station on the branch line was Halton Holegate Halt. The necessary parliamentary permission had been obtained by an Act in July 1865 which incorporated the Spilsby &amp; Firsby Railway Company with an authorised capital of Â£20,000 and loans of Â£8,333 for the construction of the , single-track branch.

Construction of the railway began in March 1867. The ceremonial cutting of the first turf was performed by the local rector, the Reverend Rawnsley, who was standing in for the railway company&#x27;s chairman Lord Willoughby de Eresby the 25th Baron. The railway was expected to be opened quickly but disputes with the contractors arose over the quality of their work, and several lengths of track had to be replaced. The Great Northern Railway bought out the Spilsby &amp; Firsby Railway Company for Â£20,000 through an Act of Parliament on 25 July 1890.

Passenger services were suspended in 1939. A goods service for grain, potatoes, livestock and other agricultural products continued for nearly 20 years. Goods including petrol, paraffin and coal continued to come into Spilsby via the rail link up to its final closure on 30 November 1958.

The main station building was demolished in 1965. The engine shed has been used by agricultural suppliers as a shop and store, with new sections added. The original trackbed within the town has been built on, with most of it covered by the Vale Industrial Estate. Outside the town, most of the old track route to Firsby can still be seen in aerial photographs, marked by the avenue of trees and bushes.

===Military connections===
The Seventh Spilsby Rifle Volunteer Corps, an early part-time army detachment, part of the Volunteer Force, was formed in the town during 1860. At its height, the corps contained about 100 members. In 1872, Captain J. W. Preston was the officer in charge, supported by Lt George Walker, Ensign Robert MacKinder and drill-master Sergeant Thomas Ward.

In 1889 the Rifle Volunteer Corps, renamed as F Company of the First Volunteer Battalion, was based in Spilsby. Its commandant was the now-promoted Major George Walker. He was aided by Lt G. B. Walker and Lt W. Hoff, Acting Surgeon Lieutenant Francis John Walker and the acting chaplain Rev. Pownoll Kendall.

In 1899 Spilsby&#x27;s Territorial Force Drill Hall was completed in Halton Road, built of solid red brick. The site also contained housing and quarters for the resident professional army sergeant instructors.

In 1912, C Company of the 5th Battalion Lincolnshire Regiment (Territorial Force) was formed in the town. The company&#x27;s commandant was Captain H. S. Scorer (killed in action at Hohenzollern Redoubt on 13 October 1915 during the First World War), Surgeon Colonel Francis John Walker was the chief medical officer, and the regular army drill instructor was Colour Sergeant Wallace Cowling.

===Royal Air Force in Spilsby===

During the Second World War, RAF Spilsby, a bomber airfield designed for Lancaster bombers, was built at Great Steeping. It opened for operations on 20 September 1943. Later used by the United States Air Force as a strategic bomber base until 1958, the airfield was finally demolished in the late 1970s. The runways and perimeter track were torn up, with most of the crushed aggregate being used in the construction of the new Humber Bridge.

RAF Spilsby is commemorated by an airfield memorial standing just outside Great Steeping and by plaques in All Saints&#x27; Church, Great Steeping. Cropmarks showing the airfield&#x27;s runway layout are still visible in aerial photographs.

Spilsby Air Training Corps formed in 1950 initially as a detached flight of the established Skegness squadron, becoming the 2266 Spilsby Squadron ATC in 1952. Falling membership resulted in the squadron&#x27;s disbandment in 2005.

RAF Spilsby was rebuilt in the 1950s as a standby base in case of war. It was designated as a standby base for escort fighters only and never used, and there is no record of any aircraft ever landing here. The new runway was weak because of drainage problems.

==Governance==

Spilsby parish was traditionally in the East division of the ancient Bolingbroke Wapentake in the East Lindsey district in the parts of Lindsey. The parish was also in the Bolingbroke Soke. &quot;Kelly&#x27;s&quot; 1913 Directory of Lincolnshire places the parish in the South Lindsey division of the county.

Spilsby, governed locally by Spilsby Town Council, is under East Lindsey District Council based at Manby.

Spilsby falls under the Louth and Horncastle Westminster parliamentary constituency. The sitting MP is Victoria Atkins.

==Geography==
The town is situated upon slightly elevated ground at the southwestern rim of the Lincolnshire Wolds. Spilsby has an extensive south-east view of a tract of marsh and fen land, bounded by Boston Deeps and the North Sea. It is within inland from Skegness.

The Wolds comprise a series of low hills and steep valleys, underlain by calcareous chalk, green limestone and sandstone rock, laid down in the Cretaceous period under a shallow warm sea. The characteristic open valleys of the Wolds were created during the last ice age through the action of glaciation and meltwater.

Geographically, the Lincolnshire Wolds are a continuation of the Yorkshire Wolds, which run up through the East Riding of Yorkshire. The Wolds as a whole were bisected by the erosion of the waters of the River Humber. The fenlands, which stretch down as far as Norfolk, are former wetlands, consisting both of peat bogs and tidal silt marshes. They were nearly all drained by the end of the 19th century, when Spilsby had its longest period of Victorian expansion.

The drainage was organised into river drainage, the passing of upland water through the region, and internal drainage of the land between the rivers. The internal drainage was designed to be organised by levels or districts, each of which includes the fen parts of one or several parishes. Spilsby falls within the Witham Fourth District: East, West and Wildmore Fens; and the Townland, from Boston to Wainfleet.

The Battle of Britain Memorial Flight at nearby RAF Coningsby contains a flying collection, with a Lancaster bomber plus five Spitfire and two Hurricane fighters, plus a DC47 Dakota transport and two Chipmunk trainers. Lincolnshire Aviation Heritage Centre is in East Kirkby, Spilsby on the site of RAF East Kirkby. The museum commemorates the RAF&#x27;s presence in Lincolnshire during the Second World War, with airfields such as RAF Scampton being in the flat Lincolnshire countryside. The museum contains one of the world&#x27;s three remaining Lancaster bombers still capable of flying, although it does not currently fly. Plans were announced in March 2008 to raise the funds necessary to get the Lancaster into the air again.

Snipe Dales Nature Reserve and Country Park is next to the historic Civil War battlefield at nearby Winceby.

===Secondary education===
King Edward VI Academy, is a coeducational bi-lateral secondary school and specialist Humanities College for children between the ages of 11 and 18. The bilateral status is unusual, with less than five similar arrangements in the whole of England and Wales, permitting those who have passed the 11+ examination and those that fail the exam to study separately but under the same roof.

The school is an amalgamation of two separate institutions, the King Edward VI Grammar School opened in 1550 and the Sir John Franklin Secondary Modern School, which opened in 1954. These schools were originally combined in 1991 as Spilsby High School, initially retaining both sites and renaming twice. In September 2008 a sixth form college was established that provides education for over-16s, with provision for study towards a BTEC National Diploma Studies in Business Studies.

The original 1837 grammar school building was abandoned and stood empty for several years, but could not be demolished due to its Grade II listing status. In 2007 the front portion of the old school was adapted as a community facility providing meeting rooms and access to IT use. The rear of the school was demolished and has been developed for new residential housing.

<text>A concept inventory is a criterion-referenced test designed to help determine whether a student has an accurate working knowledge of a specific set of concepts. Historically, concept inventories have been in the form of multiple-choice tests in order to aid interpretability and facilitate administration in large classes. Unlike a typical, teacher-authored multiple-choice test, questions and response choices on concept inventories are the subject of extensive research. The aims of the research include ascertaining (a) the range of what individuals think a particular question is asking and (b) the most common responses to the questions. Concept inventories are evaluated to ensure test reliability and validity. In its final form, each question includes one correct answer and several distractors.

Ideally, a score on a criterion-referenced test reflects the degrees of proficiency of the test taker with one or more KSAs (knowledge, skills and/abilities), and may report results with one unidimensional score and/or multiple sub-scores. Criterion-referenced tests differ from norm-referenced tests in that (in theory) the former report level of proficiency relative pre-determined level and the latter reports relative standing to other test takers. Criterion-referenced tests may be used to determine whether a student reached predetermined levels of proficiency (i.e., scoring above some cutoff score) and therefore move on to the next unit or level of study. 

The distractors are incorrect or irrelevant answers that are usually (but not always) based on students&#x27; commonly held misconceptions. Test developers often research student misconceptions by examining students&#x27; responses to open-ended essay questions and conducting &quot;think-aloud&quot; interviews with students. The distractors chosen by students help researchers understand student thinking and give instructors insights into students&#x27; prior knowledge (and, sometimes, firmly held beliefs). This foundation in research underlies instrument construction and design, and plays a role in helping educators obtain clues about students&#x27; ideas, scientific misconceptions, and &quot;didaskalogenic&quot; (&quot;teacher-induced&quot; or &quot;teaching-induced&quot;) confusions and conceptual lacunae that interfere with learning.

==Concept inventories in use==
Concept inventories are education-related diagnostic tests. In 1985 Halloun and Hestenes introduced a &quot;multiple-choice mechanics diagnostic test&quot; to examine students&#x27; concepts about motion. It evaluates student understanding of basic concepts in classical (macroscopic) mechanics. A little later, the Force Concept Inventory (FCI), another concept inventory, was developed. The FCI was designed to assess student understanding of the Newtonian concepts of force. Hestenes (1998) found that while &quot;nearly 80% of the [students completing introductory college physics courses] could state Newton&#x27;s Third Law at the beginning of the course, FCI data showed that less than 15% of them fully understood it at the end&quot;. These results have been replicated in a number of studies involving students at a range of institutions (see sources section below). That said, there remain questions as what exactly the FCI measures. Results using the FCI have led to greater recognition in the science education community of the importance of students&#x27; &quot;interactive engagement&quot; with the materials to be mastered. 

Since the development of the FCI, other physics instruments have been developed. These include the &quot;Force and Motion Conceptual Evaluation&quot; concept and the &quot;Brief Electricity and Magnetism Assessment&quot;. For a discussion of how a number of concept inventories were developed see Beichner.

In addition to physics, concept inventories have been developed in statistics, chemistry, astronomy, basic biology, natural selection, genetics, engineering, geoscience. and computer science.

In many areas, foundational scientific concepts transcend disciplinary boundaries. An example of an inventory that assesses knowledge of such concepts is an instrument developed by Odom and Barrow (1995) to evaluate understanding of diffusion and osmosis. In addition, there are non-multiple choice conceptual instruments, such as the &quot;essay-based approach&quot; and the essay and oral exams concept to measure student understanding of Lewis structures in chemistry.

==Caveats associated with concept inventory use==
Some concept inventories are problematic. The concepts tested may not be fundamental or important in a particular discipline, the concepts involved may not be explicitly taught in a class or curriculum, or answering a question correctly may require only a superficial understanding of a topic. It is therefore possible to either over-estimate or under-estimate student content mastery. While concept inventories designed to identify trends in student thinking may not be useful in monitoring learning gains as a result of pedagogical interventions, disciplinary mastery may not be the variable measured by a particular instrument. Users should be careful to ensure that concept inventories are actually testing conceptual understanding, rather than test-taking ability, language skills, or other abilities that can influence test performance.

The use of multiple-choice exams as concept inventories is not without controversy. The very structure of multiple-choice type concept inventories raises questions involving the extent to which complex, and often nuanced situations and ideas must be simplified or clarified to produce unambiguous responses. For example, a multiple-choice exam designed to assess knowledge of key concepts in natural selection does not meet a number of standards of quality control. One problem with the exam is that the two members of each of several pairs of parallel items, with each pair designed to measure exactly one key concept in natural selection, sometimes have very different levels of difficulty. Another problem is that the multiple-choice exam overestimates knowledge of natural selection as reflected in student performance on a diagnostic essay exam and a diagnostic oral exam, two instruments with reasonably good construct validity. Although scoring concept inventories in the form of essay or oral exams is labor-intensive, costly, and difficult to implement with large numbers of students, such exams can offer a more realistic appraisal of the actual levels of students&#x27; conceptual mastery as well as their misconceptions. Recently, however, computer technology has been developed that can score essay responses on concept inventories in biology and other domains, promising to facilitate the scoring of concept inventories organized as (transcribed) oral exams as well as essays.

<text>Stoddard-Dayton was a high quality car manufactured by Dayton Motor Car Company in Dayton, Ohio, US, between 1905 and 1913. John W. Stoddard and his son Charles G. Stoddard were the principals in the company.

==History==

In 1904, John Stoddard decided to exit the agricultural implement business from which he had earned his fortune and instead to manufacture high quality automobiles for the emerging market in the United States. He sent his son Charles to Europe to tour continental automobile manufacturers. Charles returned convinced that electricity and steam were outmoded forms of propulsion. The earliest cars used Rutenber engines (&quot;Let your steed be worthy of your chariot&quot;) and had 4605 cc engines. Six-cylinder engines appeared in 1907. The final range consisted of three four-cylinder models and a Knight sleeve valve six.

The company adopted a strategy of building the highest quality motor cars with powerful engines. Henry J. Edwards (b. ca 1872 Englandâ) was the auto designer and Chief Engineer of the company. Low-end models were dressed in 15 to 18 coats of paint, each coat hand sanded and rubbed out. The limousine model had 27 or 28 coats of paint, similarly applied. After assembly, each car was driven on public roads for to , then the engine was disassembled, the cylinders re-honed, valves touched up, and then reassembled and road tested again.

Cars began to be delivered in late 1905, sold as 1906 models. Stoddard established a reputation as winning race cars in sprint races, hill climbs and dirt track races all over the Midwest. Because these cars were all stock models, Dayton Motor Car lost no time in letting the motoring public know. In 1909, a two-seater Stoddard-Dayton won the first race at Indianapolis Motor Speedway, averaging . The first pace car ever was a Stoddard-Dayton driven by Carl G. Fisher to start the Indianapolis 500 in 1911.

In 1906 there were three models:
* Runabout, $1,250, equipped with &quot;T&quot;-head engine
* Touring car, $2,250
* Limousine, $3,200, equipped with engine (and 28 coats of paint)

Frank Lloyd Wright&#x27;s first car was a 1908 Stoddard-Dayton Model K roadster.

In 1909, Stoddard-Dayton formed the Courier Car Co in Dayton to produce a smaller, lighter, and lower-priced version of the Stoddard-Dayton, called the Courier.

By 1911, Stoddard-Dayton offered twenty models with four different enginesâlimousines, landaulets, coupes, touring, torpedoes, roadsters, trucks, taxicabs, delivery wagons. Examples include:
* &quot;Savoy,&quot; $1,350, equipped with engine
* &quot;Stratford,&quot; equipped with engine
* &quot;Saybrook,&quot; equipped with engine
* &quot;Special,&quot; equipped with engine
* &quot;Stoddard-Dayton-Knight limousine,&quot; $6,250, with six-cylinder engine

In 1912, about 25,000 automobiles in twenty-six models were manufactured. In June 1912, Stoddard-Dayton became part of the United States Motor Company, which advertised the Stoddard-Dayton line with the simple statement: &quot;None can go farther. None can go faster.&quot; They made an advance purchase of a large volume of engines from Atlas Engine Works (Indianapolis, Indiana) and made commitments for 30,000 chassis, factors that contributed to financial instability. In February 1912, Charles Stoddard resigned as Vice President of United States Motor Company, and Henry Edwards resigned as Chief Designer to form the Edwards Motor Car Company. Stoddard remained a Director of USMC and continued his financial holdings. However, United States Motor Company went into receivership in late 1912 and failed in bankruptcy in 1913. The Stoddard-Dayton went down with it.

The assets of the Dayton Motor Car Company were purchased by the reorganized Maxwell where parts were manufactured for assembly at New Castle, Indiana and later Detroit, Michigan. In 1913, Maxwell continued to offer the Stoddard-Dayton models 30, 38 and 48 (Savoy, Stratford and Saybrook), although these may have been leftover 1912 models. The 1913 model 48 offered a self-starter and electric lighting for an additional $200. When Maxwell later was itself reorganized, it became part of Chrysler Corporation and the Dayton division became Chrysler AirTemp.

Stoddard-Dayton was slow to react to the emergence of a mass market and maintained a high-quality strategy after automobiles ceased to be exclusively rich men&#x27;s status symbols. They were building cars as good as possible while Ford and General Motors were building as cheap as possible. Stoddard-Dayton continued to expand model offerings at all price points, but never changed fundamental manufacturing methods. The classic example of this was the 11-part radiator cap on the limousineâbody, two pins, gasket, gasket retainer, screws, and latch. It was permanently attached to the radiator so that it could not be lost or stolen and could be opened with a flip of the locking lever, even when the engine was hot. Meanwhile, in Detroit, a Ford punch press was punching out caps and then an operation applied threads. True, the threads sometimes stuck and it could not be removed when the radiator was hotâbut the Model T was selling for $399.

Svein Rosseland was born in Kvam, in Hardanger, Norway. Rosseland grew up the youngest of nine siblings. He went to his final exams in Haugesund in 1917 and then went to the University of Oslo. After only three semesters at the university, he left in 1919 to work as an assistant professor with the meteorologist Vilhelm Bjerknes at the Bergen School of Meteorology. In 1920 he went to the Institute of Physics (now the Niels Bohr Institute) in Copenhagen, where he met Niels Bohr and other prominent physicists, and where he wrote two seminal papers. He spent 1924â1926 as a Rockefeller Fellow at the Mount Wilson Observatory in Pasadena, California.

In 1927, Rosseland earned a PhD. from the University of Oslo. As a professor at the University of Oslo from 1928 to 1964, he built up and headed academics at the Institute of Theoretical Astrophysics (&quot;Institutt for Teoretisk Astrofysikk&quot;). Rosseland was a key participant when the University of Oslo built the Institute of Theoretical Astrophysics in 1934, using funding from the Rockefeller Foundation. Between 1929-30 he was a guest professor at the Harvard College Observatory. In 1934 he founded the journal &quot;Astrophysics Norvegica&quot;, published by the Norwegian Academy of Science and Letters. In 1936 he published his textbook &quot;Theoretical Astrophysics&quot;, which contained numerous original contributions. Rosseland was instrumental in the effort behind the building of the Oslo Analyzer, finished in 1938 and for four years the world&#x27;s most powerful differential analyzer.

With the German occupation of Norway in World War II, he fled the country and went to the United States, where he was appointed a professor at Princeton University. In 1943 he went to London to work with the development of radar by the British Air Defense Ministry and later at the Admiralty, where he worked on underwater explosions. He was also a consultant for the U.S. Time Corporation, a company that later evolved into the Norwegian-owned company Timex Group USA. In the war&#x27;s final years, he worked on military research at Columbia University.

Rosseland returned to Norway in 1946. In the postwar period he was involved in the development of the Norwegian research policy and was among those involved in the creation of the Institute for Energy Technology which was established in 1948 and Norwegian Academy of Technological Sciences which was founded during 1955. He was also the driving force behind the creation of Harestua Solar Observatory located at Gunnarshaugen in Oppland, which was inaugurated in 1954.

Rosseland was Norwegian delegate to the CERN Council in the early days of the organization.

== Legacy ==
In 1957 he was decorated Commander of the Royal Norwegian Order of St. Olav. The minor planet 1646 Rosseland and the lunar crater &quot;Rosseland&quot; are named after him, as is the Rosseland mean opacity. The Institute of Theoretical Astrophysics at the University of Oslo is housed in &quot;Svein Rosseland&#x27;s House&quot;. In honor of the 100th anniversary of his birth, the Svein Rosseland Centenary Symposium was held at the Norwegian Academy of Science and Letters in Oslo during June 1994. A bust of him was also erected at Steinsdalsfossen near his home in Norheimsund.

<text>Abbey (2021 population: ) is a village in the Canadian province of Saskatchewan within the Rural Municipality of Miry Creek No. 229 and Census Division No. 8. This village is in the south-western region of the province, north-west of the city of Swift Current. Abbey is serviced by Highway 32 near Highway 738.

== History ==
In 1910, the first post office used by area residents was Longworth, located in the home of Cassie Baldwin. The townsite of Abbey was originally owned by a man named D.F. Kennedy. In 1913, the Canadian Pacific Railway (CPR) bought a quarter section of land from him to build a rail line. The CPR gave Mr. Kennedy the honour of naming the community, giving it the name Abbey - the name of the Kennedy farm in Ireland. Abbey incorporated as a village on September 2, 1913.

===Abbey Fire Hall===

Abbey has one municipal heritage property on the Canadian Register of Historic Places, the Abbey Fire Hall. Constructed in 1919 in response to a large fire that threatened the community in September 1918, the fire station was part of an upgrade to fire protection in Abbey. The station remained in service until a new fire station was constructed in 1975. The station is currently not in use, however the siren on the station tower is still used to signal emergencies in the community.

<doc id="838858" wikidata="Q5756555" url="?curid=838858" title="High School Proficiency Assessment">
<text>The High School Proficiency Assessment (HSPA, pronounced &quot;hess-pah&quot; (/ËhÉspÉ/) or sometimes just &quot;H-S-P-A&quot;) was a standardized test that was administered by the New Jersey Department of Education to all New Jersey public high school students in March of their junior year until 2014-2015 when it was replaced by the PARCC. Together with the New Jersey Assessment of Skills and Knowledge (NJ ASK), which was administered in grades 3â8, the HSPA was part of a battery of tests used to assess student performance in New Jersey&#x27;s public schools.

== Assessment ==
The HSPA was administered over a course of three days simultaneously in all public high schools throughout the state of New Jersey. The exam tests students&#x27; proficiency in a variety of academic subjects including mathematics and language arts literacy. Beginning on September 1, 2001, state law in New Jersey required that all students pass the HSPA for high school graduation.

Students who did not pass the exam on their first try were given two opportunities to retake it during their senior (and final) year. Additionally, for those who were still unable to pass the exam or felt that they were &quot;not good test-takers,&quot; the state department of education gave students the option of participating in a &quot;Special Review Assessment&quot; process (SRA) to demonstrate their academic abilities.

== History ==
The exam, first administered in 1989, was originally called the High School Proficiency Test (abbreviated as HSPT) and was taken during the freshman year. If the examination was failed, it could be taken each year until it was passed. In 1993, only students who were in eleventh grade (Grade 11) were allowed to take the exam, and thus in 2001 the name was changed to HSPT-11 to reflect that policy alteration.

Students with severe disabilities who were unable to participate in the standardized assessment tests were given an Alternate Proficiency Assessment (APA). An APA was a portfolio-based assessment method used to measure academic progress. The APA was given to a student in each content area where the student&#x27;s disability was so severe that the student was not receiving instruction in the skill being measured and the student could not complete any of the types of questions on the assessment in a content area even with appropriate changes and accommodations.

<doc id="838873" wikidata="Q32145" url="?curid=838873" title="Ripuarian language">
<text>Ripuarian ( ) or Ripuarian Franconian is a German dialect group, part of the West Central German language group.
Together with the Moselle Franconian which includes the Luxembourgish language, Ripuarian belongs to the larger Central Franconian dialect family and also to the linguistic continuum with the Low Franconian languages.

It is spoken in the Rhineland south of the Benrath line â from northwest of DÃ¼sseldorf and Cologne to Aachen in the west and to WaldbrÃ¶l in the east.

The language area also comprises the north of the German-speaking Community of Belgium as well as the southern edge of the Limburg province of the Netherlands, especially Kerkrade (&quot;Kirchroa&quot;), where it is perceived as a variety of Limburgish and legally treated as such.

The name derives from the Ripuarian Franks (&quot;Rheinfranken&quot;), who settled in the area from the 4th century onward.

The most well known Ripuarian dialect is &quot;KÃ¶lsch&quot;, the local dialect of Cologne. Dialects belonging to the Ripuarian group almost always call themselves &quot;Platt&quot; (spelled in the Netherlands) like &quot;Ãcher Platt&quot; (of Aachen), &quot;BÃ¶nnsch Platt&quot; (of Bonn), &quot;Eischwiele Platt&quot; (of Eschweiler), &quot;KirchrÃ¶adsj plat&quot; (of Kerkrade), or &quot;Bocheser plat&quot; (of Bocholtz). Most of the more than one hundred Ripuarian dialects are bound to one specific village or municipality. Usually there are small distinctive differences between neighbouring dialects (which are, however, easily noticeable to locals), and increasingly bigger differences between the more distant dialects. These are described by a set of isoglosses called the Rhenish fan in linguistics. The way people talk, even if they are not using Ripuarian, often allows them to be traced precisely to a village or city quarter where they learned to speak.

==Number of speakers==
About a million people speak a variation of Ripuarian dialect, which constitutes about one quarter of the inhabitants of the area. Penetration of Ripuarian in everyday communication varies considerably, as does the percentage of Ripuarian speakers from one place to another. In some places there may only be a few elderly speakers left, while elsewhere Ripuarian usage is common in everyday life. Both in the genuine Ripuarian area and far around it, the number of people passively understanding Ripuarian to some extent exceeds the number of active speakers by far.

==Geographic significance==
Speakers are centred on the German city of KÃ¶ln (Cologne). The language&#x27;s distribution starts from the important geographic transition into the flat-lands coming down from the Middle Rhine. The Ripuarian varieties are related to the Moselle Franconian languages spoken in the southern Rhineland (Rhineland-Palatinate and Saarland) in Germany, to the Luxembourgish language in Luxembourg, and to the Low Franconian Limburgish language in the Dutch province of Limburg. Most of the historic roots of Ripuarian languages are in Middle German, but there were other influences too, such as Latin, Low German, Dutch, French and Southern Meuse-Rhenish (Limburgish). Several elements of grammar are unique to Ripuarian and do not exist in the other languages of Germany.

The French Community of Belgium as well as the Netherlands officially recognise some Ripuarian dialects as minority languages, and the European Union likewise follows.

==Varieties==
Varieties are or include:
* West Ripuarian (), around Aachen and a small area in East Belgium and the Netherlands
* Central Ripuarian ()
** City Colognian ()
** Country Colognian ()

== Grammar ==

=== Numerals ===
The transcription from MÃ¼nch, in which the grave accent (`) and macron (Â¯) represent, respectively, accent 1 and 2 in the Central/Low Franconian pitch accent.
=== Pronouns ===
Ripuarian (excluding City-Colognian) emphasised personal pronouns:

<text>Gilbert Layton (November 5, 1899 â May 29, 1961) was a Canadian politician and businessman in Quebec, Canada.

== Background ==
Born in Montreal, Quebec, Layton, the son of Philip Edward David Layton and Alice Marion Gilbert, was a merchant and business executive in the family firm of Layton Brothers (founded 1887, now as Layton Audio) from 1918 to 1932. His father was a blind activist who led a campaign for disability pensions in the 1930s. Gilbert married Norah Lestelle England (daughter of Arthur John England and Florence Louise Grimmett) on February 18, 1921.

== Member of the legislature ==
Gilbert Layton was elected to Quebec&#x27;s legislative assembly in the riding of MontrÃ©alâSaint-Georges in 1936 as a member of the &quot;Union Nationale&quot;, a conservative party. He served as minister without portfolio in the government of Maurice Duplessis until resigning in 1939 to protest the Quebec government&#x27;s opposition to conscription in World War II. He ran for re-election to the legislature as an independent candidate that year and was defeated.

== Federal politics ==
In the 1945 federal election, he ran as an Independent Progressive Conservative for the Mount Royal seat in the House of Commons of Canada, but was defeated. He placed fourth behind the Liberal victor, the official Progressive Conservative Party of Canada candidate and the Co-operative Commonwealth Federation (CCF) candidate.

== Death ==
Layton died in Montreal and is buried at Mount Royal Cemetery.

== Descendants ==

Gilbert Layton&#x27;s son, Robert Layton, served as a federal Progressive Conservative cabinet minister in the 1980s. His grandson, Jack Layton, was the leader of the federal New Democratic Party from 2003 to 2011, and was Leader of the Official Opposition for a short time in 2011 until he died in office. His great-grandson is Toronto City Councillor Mike Layton.

<doc id="838886" wikidata="Q8030711" url="?curid=838886" title="Woman at Point Zero">
<text>Woman at Point Zero (, ) is a novel by Nawal El Saadawi written in 1975 and published in Arabic in 1977. The novel is based on Saadawi&#x27;s meeting with a female prisoner in Qanatir Prison and is the first-person account of Firdaus, a murderess who has agreed to tell her life story before her execution. The novel explores the themes of women and their place within a patriarchal society.

==Background==
At the end of 1972 Saadawi was removed from her position as the Director of Health Education and the Editor-in-Chief of &quot;Health&quot; magazine after the publication of &quot;Women and Sex&quot;. She began research on neurosis in Egyptian women, during which she met a doctor at Qanatir Prison who talked to her about the inmates, including a female prisoner who had killed a man and had been sentenced to hanging. Saadawi was interested in meeting the woman and visiting the prison, and her colleague arranged for her to conduct her research at Qanatir Prison in the autumn of 1974. Saadawi visited many women in the cell block and in the mental clinic and was able to conduct twenty-one in-depth case studies for her 1976 publication, &quot;Women and Neurosis in Egypt&quot;, but Firdaus remained &quot;a woman apart.&quot; Firdaus was executed in 1974, but she left a lasting impact on Saadawi, who said she could not rest until she had written about Firdaus&#x27; story and finished the novel in one week. Saadawi describes Firdaus as a martyr and says she admires her because, &quot;Few people are ready to face death for a principle.&quot; Later, when Saadawi was imprisoned in Qanatir in 1981 for political offenses, she reflected that she would find herself looking for Firdaus among the prison population, unable to believe that the woman who had inspired her so much was truly dead.

===Publication history===
Initially, Egyptian publishers rejected the book and the first edition was published by Dar al-Adab in Beirut in 1977 (with a second edition in 1979). &quot;Woman at Point Zero&quot; has subsequently been published in twenty-two languages. The English-language translation was originally published in 1983 by Zed Books in London.

== Plot summary ==

The novel opens with a psychiatrist who is researching inmates at a women&#x27;s prison. The prison doctor speaks of a woman, Firdaus, who is unlike any of the murderers in the prison: she rarely eats or sleeps, she never talks, she never accepts visitors. She feels certain the woman is incapable of murder, but she has refused to sign any appeals on her behalf. The psychiatrist makes several attempts to speak with her, but Firdaus declines. The rejections cause the psychiatrist to have a crisis of self-confidence. She becomes consumed with the idea that Firdaus is better than herself, and possibly better than even the president, whom she has refused to send an appeal to. As the psychiatrist is leaving the warder comes to her with an urgent message: Firdaus wants to speak to her. Upon meeting, Firdaus promptly tells her to close the window, sit down, and listen. She explains that she is going to be executed that evening and she wants to tell her life story.

Firdaus describes a poor childhood in a farming community. She recalls that she was confused by the disparity between her father&#x27;s actions, such as beating her mother, and his dedication to the Islamic faith. Those days were relatively happy days, as she was sent out to the fields to work and tend the goats. She enjoys the friendship of a boy named Mohammadain, with whom she plays &quot;bride and bridegroom&quot;, and describes her first encounters with clitoral stimulation. One day Firdaus&#x27;s mother sends for a woman with a knife, who mutilates her genitals. From that point on Firdaus is assigned work in the home. Firdaus&#x27; uncle begins to take a sexual interest in her and she describes her new lack of clitoral sensitivity, noting, &quot;He was doing to me what Mohammadain had done to me before. In fact, he was doing even more, but I no longer felt the strong sensation of pleasure that radiated from an unknown and yet familiar part of my body. ... It was as if I could not longer recall the exact spot from which it used to arise, or as though a part of me, of my being, was gone and would never return.&quot;

After the death of her parents, Firdaus is taken in by her uncle, who sends her to primary school, which she loves. She maintains a close relationship with her uncle, who continues to take an interest in her sexually. After Firdaus receives her primary school certificate a distance grows between uncle and niece, and her uncle marries and withdraws all affection and attention. Tensions between Firdaus and her aunt-in-law build until Firdaus is placed in boarding school, where Firdaus falls in love with a female teacher named Miss Iqbal, whom she feels a mutual connection to, but Iqbal keeps her at an arm&#x27;s length and never allows her to get close.

Upon graduation, Firdaus&#x27; aunt convinces her uncle to arrange her marriage with Sheikh Mahmoud, a &quot;virtuous man&quot; who needs an obedient wife. Firdaus considers running away but ultimately submits to the marriage. Mahmoud repulses herâhe is forty years older and has a sore on his chin that oozes pus. He stays home all day, micromanaging Firdaus&#x27; every action, and begins to physically abuse her.

Firdaus runs away and wanders the streets aimlessly until she stops to rest at a coffee shop. The owner, Bayoumi, offers her tea and a place to stay until she finds a job, which she accepts. After several months, Firdaus tells him she wants to find a job and her own place to live. Bayoumi immediately becomes violent and beats her savagely. He starts locking her up during the day and allows his friends to abuse, insult, and rape her. Eventually, Firdaus is able to enlist the aid of a female neighbor, who calls a carpenter to open the door, allowing her to escape.

While on the run, Firdaus meets the madame Sharifa Salah el Dine, who takes her into her brothel as a high-class prostitute. She tells Firdaus that all men are the same and that she must be harder than life if she wants to live. In exchange for working in Sharifa&#x27;s brothel Firdaus is given beautiful clothes and delicious food, but she has no pleasure in life. One evening she overhears an argument between Sharifa and her pimp, Fawzy, who wants to take Firdaus as his own. They argue, and Fawzy overpowers Sharifa and rapes her. Firdaus realizes that even Sharifa does not have true power and she runs away.

Wandering in the rainy night, Firdaus is picked up by a stranger who takes her back to his home. He sleeps with her, but he is not as disgusting as the other men she has dealt with in her profession, and after they are done he gives her a 10-pound note. This is a moment of awakening for Firdaus, and she recalls that it, &quot;solved the enigma in one swift, sweeping moment, tore away the shroud that covered up a truth I had in fact experienced when still a child, when for the first time my father gave me a coin to hold in my hand, and be mine&quot;. Firdaus realizes that she can exert her power over men by rejecting them, and can force men to yield to her will by naming her own price; she gains self-confidence and soon becomes a wealthy and highly sought prostitute. She employs a cook and an assistant, works whatever hours she wishes, and cultivates powerful friendships. One day, her friend Di&#x27;aa tells her she is not respectable. This insult has a jarring and immediate impact on Firdaus, who comes to realize that she can no longer work as a prostitute.

Firdaus takes a job at a local office and refuses to offer her body to the higher officials for promotions or raises. Although she believes that her new job will bring respect, she makes significantly less money than when working as a prostitute, and lives in squalid conditions. Furthermore, her office job gives her little autonomy or freedom which she values so highly. She eventually falls in love with Ibrahim, a coworker and revolutionary chairman, with whom she develops a deep emotional connection. But when Ibrahim announces his engagement to the chairman&#x27;s daughter, which has clearly been engineered to help his career, Firdaus realizes he does not reciprocate her feelings and only used her for sex.

Crushed and disillusioned, Firdaus returns to prostitution, and once again amasses great wealth and becomes highly influential. Her success attracts the attention of the pimp Marzouk, who has many political connections and threatens her with police action. He repeatedly beats Firdaus and forces her to give him larger percentages of her earnings. Firdaus decides to leave and take up another job, but Marzouk blocks her way and tells her she can never leave. When he pulls a knife, Firdaus takes it and stabs him to death.

High with the sense of her new freedom, Firdaus walks the streets until she is picked up by a high-profile Arabian prince, who she refuses until he agrees to her price of 3,000 pounds. As soon as the transaction is over, she tells him that she killed a man. He does not believe her, but she scares him to the point that he is convinced. The prince has her arrested and Firdaus is sentenced to death. Firdaus says that she has been sentenced to death because they were afraid to let her live, for: &quot;My life means their death. My death means their life. They want to live.&quot; As she is finishing her story, armed policemen come for her, and the psychiatrist sits, stunned, as Firdaus is taken to be executed, and realizes that Firdaus has more courage than her.

==Literary significance and reception==
Critics have praised Saadawi for exposing the subjugation of women in Middle Eastern societies, but Wen-Chin Ouyang notes that Saadawi&#x27;s work and its popularity in Western countries is regarded with suspicion by Arab critics, who contend that Saadawi perpetuates negative Western stereotypes of Arab-Islamic male violence and domination and that her work has been neglected due to its literary shortcomings.

<doc id="838893" wikidata="Q570043" url="?curid=838893" title="Folsom Street Fair">
<text>Folsom Street Fair (FSF) is an annual kink, leather subculture, and alternative sexuality street fair, held in September that concludes San Francisco&#x27;s &quot;Leather Pride Week&quot;. The Folsom Street Fair, sometimes referred to simply as &quot;Folsom&quot;, takes place on the last Sunday in September, on Folsom Street between 8th and 13th Streets, in San Francisco&#x27;s South of Market district.

The event started in 1984, and is California&#x27;s third-largest single-day, outdoor spectator event and the world&#x27;s largest leather event and showcase for BDSM products and culture. It has grown as a non-profit charity, and local and national non-profits benefit with all donations at the gates going to charity groups as well as numerous fundraising schemes within the festival including games, beverage booths and even spanking for donations to capitalize on the adult-themed exhibitionism.

==Origin of the leather subculture==

Although sadomasochism has been practiced for many centuries, the modern gay leather scene in the United States developed beginning in 1945 when thousands of gay servicemen were given blue discharges from service after World War II and came to the major port cities of the United States to live in gay ghettos. In 1953, the Marlon Brando film &quot;The Wild One&quot; appeared, and some butch gays began to imitate Brando by wearing black leather jackets, a black leather cap, black leather boots and jeans and, if they could afford it, by also riding motorcycles. In the 1950s, the magazine &quot;Bizarre&quot; familiarized people with sexual fetishism.

==History of the leather community in San Francisco==
The first proto-leather bar in San Francisco was the Sailor Boy Tavern, which opened in 1938 near the Embarcadero YMCA and catered to U.S. Navy Sailors looking for same-sex sexual encounters.

Folsom Street has been the center of San Francisco&#x27;s men&#x27;s leather community since the mid-1960s. Before centering in the South of Market neighborhood, leather friendly bars were located in the Embarcadero (Jack&#x27;s On The Waterfront at 111 Embarcadero 1952â1963, On The Levee ?â1972), and the Tenderloin (The Spur Club at 126 Turk â raided and closed in 1959, The Why Not at 518 Ellis â opened and closed in 1960, The Hideaway at 438 Eddy â raided and closed in 1961). The first leather bar in SOMA was the Tool Box, a gay leather bar which opened in 1961 at 339 4th St and closed in 1971. It was made famous by the June 1964 Paul Welch &quot;Life&quot; article entitled &quot;Homosexuality In America&quot;, the first time a national publication reported on gay issues. &quot;Life&quot;â³s photographer was referred to the Tool Box by Hal Call, who had long worked to dispel the myth that all homosexual men were effeminate. The article opened with a two-page spread of the mural of life size leathermen in the bar, painted by Chuck Arnett, a patron and employee. The article described San Francisco as &quot;The Gay Capital of America&quot; and inspired many gay leathermen to move there.

The first leather bar on Folsom Street was Febe&#x27;s, on the southwest corner of 11th and Folsom, which opened July 25, 1966. The Stud bar, which opened in 1966 at 1535 Folsom St., was a gay leather bar that was also originally a Hells Angels hangout; by 1969 it had become a dance bar for hippies on the margins of the leather scene and had a psychedelic black light mural by Chuck Arnett (in 1987, it moved to 399 9th St. at Harrison). In 1967 A Taste of Leather, one of the first in-bar leather stores, was established at Febe&#x27;s by Nick O&#x27;Demus. As of late 2009, A Taste of Leather announced it would be going out of business after 43 years.

In 1971, the modern bandana code came into use among leather people. Many leather people went to the Embarcadero YMCA (at this YMCA, doing weight training while wearing nothing but gym shoes and a jockstrap as well as nude swimming were both allowed until 1975, when women could become members of the YMCA). Leather people who worked out at the Embarcadero YMCA took advantage of the opportunity to get together with sailors when they came into town and rented rooms at the adjacent Embarcadero YMCA Hotel.

By the late 1970s Folsom&#x27;s &quot;Miracle Mile&quot; had featured nearly 30 different leather bars, sex clubs, and merchants, most within walking distance of each other. These establishments included, in the order they were established:

* 1968 â Off the Levee (by the same owner of On The Levee), The Ramrod.
* 1971 â The In Between (later renamed The No Name), The Bootcamp.
* 1972 â The Barracks at 72 Hallam St., off Folsom between 7th and 8th Streets (a gay bathhouse for people into hardcore BDSMâeach room was arranged like a stage set to cater to a different fetish fantasy).
* 1973 â The Red Star Saloon (connected to the Barracks) (which featured new artwork by Chuck Arnett), the End Up (not a leather bar but a dance bar; however, many leather people who liked to dance went there), Folsom Prison, The Ambush, Big Townâa gay leather shopping mall on the south side of Folsom between 6th and 7th Streets.
* 1975 â Hombre, The Catacombs (for those into hard core fisting), The Emporium.
* 1976 â The Trading Post, The Slot (for those into hardcore flagellation), The hotel (later renamed The Handball Express â a place for those into hardcore fisting).
* 1977 â The Brig, The Balcony.
* 1978 â The Arena, The Roundup (later renamed The Watering Holeâa place for those into urolagnia), The Quarters, Black &amp; Blue, Folsom Street Baths at 1015 Folsom (a BDSM gay bathhouse, later renamed The Sutro Baths in 1980âthe slogan of the Sutro Baths was &quot;A rainbow of sexual preferences&quot;, which was inscribed on a banner above the orgy room, located where the main dance floor of 1015 Folsom now is. The Sutro Baths also admitted women and trans people).
* 1979 - The Stables at 1123 Folsom (for those who liked to dress as cowboys), The Trench (for those into hardcore urolagnia), The Hothouse on the northwest corner of 5th and Harrison (another BDSM gay bathhouse), Tailor of San Francisco, Mister S Leath.
* 1980 â The Plunge â a gay BDSM bathhouse with swimming pool on the northwest corner of 11th and Folsom (in 1983 the swimming pool was covered over and became the surface of the dance floor of the popular bisexual dance club The Oasis).
* 1981 â The Eagle at 398 12th St., as of 2010, is San Francisco&#x27;s oldest leather bar, as well as its largest with its extensive outdoor patio, and it has hosted many popular barbecues and beer busts to benefit charitable organizations.

The predecessor of the Folsom Street Fair was the &quot;CMC Carnival&quot; (&quot;California Motorcycle Club Carnival&quot;), a gay leather BDSM dance (with DJs and a rock band) and fair, with vendors and a back room for casual sex. It was held on the second Sunday of November every year from 1966 to the last one in 1986 at various indoor venues including most often at the Seafarer&#x27;s International Union Hall (referred to as &quot;Seaman&#x27;s Hall&quot; for short) at 350 Fremont Street in the Embarcadero area of SOMA. In the early 1970s, the CMC Carnival was attended by a few hundred people and by the time of the last large CMC Carnival in 1982 at what was then the Yellow Cab Building at Jones and Turk in the Tenderloin, it was attended by over 4,000 people.

The &quot;CMC Carnival&quot; was organized by one of the leather motorcycle clubs, the &quot;California Motorcycle Club&quot;, with the help of other gay motorcycle clubs. The members of these gay motorcycle clubs rode mostly Harley-Davidson motorcycles and on periodic weekends rode their motorcycles to outings at picnic grounds in the Sierra Nevada. The first gay motorcycle club in the United States was the Satyrs, founded in Los Angeles in 1954. The first gay motorcycle club in San Francisco was the Warlocks, which was founded in 1960, followed by the California Motorcycle Club, also founded in 1960 later in the year. By the mid-1960s, San Francisco&#x27;s South of Market district had become the center of the gay motorcycle club scene and was home to motorcycle clubs such as the Barbary Coasters (founded in 1966) and the Constantines and the Cheaters (both founded in 1967). Some leather people of the 1960s and 1970s felt that one was not really a leather person but just a poseur unless one owned an actual motorcycle, preferably a Harley-Davidson.

Gay motorcycle clubs in San Francisco also organized many benefits for charity at various leather bars. During the 1970s and early 1980s one could see many dozens of motorcycles belonging to people who were members of these clubs parked up and down the length of Folsom Street on the &quot;Miracle Mile&quot;. The membership of these motorcycle clubs was decimated by the AIDS crisis beginning in 1982.

In 1979 the newly formed San Francisco lesbian motorcycle club, Dykes on Bikes, led what was then called the San Francisco Gay Freedom Day Parade for the first time and has done so ever since (since 1994, the event has been called the &quot;San Francisco Pride Parade&quot;). By the mid-1980s, lesbian motorcycle enthusiasts in other cities began to form motorcycle clubs. In the 1980s and early 1990s, lesbian leatherwomen were often involved in helping to care for gay leathermen who had been stricken with AIDS.

In 1984 the Folsom Street Fair began in San Francisco; it is the world&#x27;s largest leather event and showcase for BDSM products and culture.

In 2008 and 2012, Folsom Street Events received the Large Nonprofit Organization of the Year award as part of the Pantheon of Leather Awards, although in 2012 it tied with Cleveland Leather Awareness Weekend. In 2013, the San Francisco Leathermen&#x27;s Discussion Group received the Small Nonprofit Organization of the Year award as part of the Pantheon of Leather Awards. Then in 2015 Folsom Street Events received the Nonprofit Organization of the Year award as part of the Pantheon of Leather Awards.

The San Francisco South of Market Leather History Alley consists of four works of art along Ringold Alley honoring leather culture; it opened in 2017. The four works of art are: A black granite stone etched with a narrative by Gayle Rubin, an image of the &quot;Leather David&quot; statue by Mike Caffee, and a reproduction of Chuck Arnett&#x27;s 1962 mural from the Tool Box, a gay leather bar, engraved standing stones that honor community leather institutions including the Folsom Street Fair, leather pride flag pavement markings through which the stones emerge, and metal bootprints along the curb which honor 28 people who were an important part of the leather communities of San Francisco.

==Beginnings of the Folsom Street Fair==

The community had been active in resisting the city&#x27;s ambitious redevelopment program for the South of Market area throughout the 1970s. City officials had wanted to &quot;revitalize&quot; the historically blue-collar, warehouse, industrial district by continuing successful high-rise development already underway on Rincon Hill.

But as the AIDS epidemic unfolded in the 1980s, the community&#x27;s relative autonomy from City Hall was dramatically weakened. The crisis became an opportunity for the city (in the name of public health) to close bathhouses and regulate bars, which they did beginning in 1984.

As these establishments for the leather community were rapidly closing, a coalition of housing activists and community organizers decided to start a street fair. The fair would enhance the visibility of the community, provide a means for much-needed fundraising, and create opportunities for members of the leather community to connect to services and vital information (e.g., regarding safer sex) that bathhouses and bars might otherwise have been situated to distribute.

Thanks to the success of the first Folsom Street Fair, the organizers created the Up Your Alley Fair on Ringold Street in 1985. This fair moved to Dore Street (&quot;Dore Alley&quot;) between Howard and Folsom in 1987.

Street photographer Michael Rababy says that a century of artists and poets are being replaced by algorithmics and trust-fund hipsters, but as the millennium tower sinks, the Folsom Street Fair stands its ground.

Due to the COVID-19 pandemic, there was no fair in 2020.

==Atmosphere==
As one of the few occasions when sadomasochistic activities are encouraged and performed in public, it attracts a considerable number of sightseers and those who enjoy the attention of onlookers as well as hundreds of photographers and videographers. Although the costumes and activities are frequently transgressive, many people come together at the food court, many attendees find the event &quot;eye-opening&quot; and positive. On the other hand, the event has at times drawn public and internal criticism for its bawdy atmosphere and broad tolerance of lewd behavior, and it is a regular target for anti-gay organizations such as Americans for Truth about Homosexuality.

The fair claims it draws 250,000 visitors annually, including leather fetishists from around the world, and is the third-largest street event in California, after the Tournament of Roses Parade and San Francisco Pride parade. Each year, net proceeds from Folsom Street Fair, including gate donations and beverage sales, are given to qualified local charities (&quot;beneficiaries&quot;). These include charities working in public health, human services, and the arts, as well as beverage partners, and the Sisters of Perpetual Indulgence who lead the organizing effort at the gates. The event regularly generates over $300,000 annually for charity. Money raising events also include a charity spanking booth, live BDSM demonstrations and a twister stage.

Fair organizers present one or two live stages for alternative bands and artists. Previous headlining live acts have included Austra, Little Boots, Miami Horror, Ladytron (DJ Team), Dragonette, Imperial Teen, Berlin, the Presets, Monarchy, the English Beat, Missing Persons, MNDR, Light Asylum, Shiny Toy Guns, Natalie Portman&#x27;s Shaved Head, Nitzer Ebb, MEN (featuring JD Samson of Le Tigre), My Life With The Thrill Kill Kult, the Limousines, Ladyhawke, Adult., and Yacht. Over time, the fair is becoming more and more well known as a venue for top-notch, international underground musical talent. There are one or two dance areas with DJs and cage dancers, featuring DJ sets from the likes of Tony Moran, Manny Lehman, The Cucarachas featuring Tom Stephan, and Mark Moore of S&#x27;Express.

In 2006, Folsom Street Fair introduced a women&#x27;s area, dubbed &quot;Bettie Page&#x27;s Secret&quot; for the first year, then &quot;Venus&#x27; Playground&quot; and as of 2016 the current area is called the Playground. The Playground is open to &quot;women of every kind and all trans and non-binary folks.&quot; The Playground also hosts the Queer Commons, a space for all genders of queer folks. In 2007, an erotic artists&#x27; area was established as well with a performance art stage appearing in 2013 in honor of the 30th fair.

===Folsom Street East===
Since 1997, a smaller event called Folsom Street East has been organized in New York City by GMSMA. There is no affiliation between Folsom Street East (NYC) and Folsom Street Events (SF).

===Folsom Europe===
Folsom Europe was established in Berlin, Germany, in 2003 in order to bring the non-profit leather festival concept pioneered by the Folsom Street Fair in San Francisco to Europe.

===Folsom Fair North (FFN)===
The Toronto version of Folsom Street Fair was dubbed &quot;Folsom Fair North&quot;, FFN or FFNTO, and was held annually in July from 2003 until it was canceled permanently in 2008.

==2007 poster controversy==
For the 24th annual event held on September 30, 2007, the official poster artwork was a photo featuring well-known LGBT and BDSM community members in festive and fetish attire including Sister Roma &quot;as players in an innovative version of the culturally iconographic&quot; &quot;The Last Supper&quot; by Leonardo da Vinci, complete with a table draped with the Leather Pride flag and &quot;cluttered with sex toys, whips, and various (BDSM) restraints&quot;. The image by FredAlert was used on the official event guide and produced as collector&#x27;s posters that were displayed throughout the city as advertising for the event. Some conservative religious groups criticized the image as anti-Christian and blasphemous, although media outlets noted that parodies and homages of the &quot;Last Supper&quot; painting like RenÃ©e Cox&#x27;s &quot;Yo Mama&#x27;s Last Supper&quot; are numerous, including ones by &quot;The Simpsons&quot;, &quot;The Sopranos&quot;, Phish, &quot;That &#x27;70s Show&quot;, Robert Altman (in the film &quot;MASH&quot;) and the Boston Red Sox. Chris Glaser, a gay clergyman and interim senior pastor at San Francisco&#x27;s Metropolitan Community Church opined that &quot;they are just having fun&quot; with both the painting and the notion of &#x27;San Francisco values,&#x27; and called the poster &quot;tastefully and cleverly done&quot;.

In a press release, Andy Copper, Board President of Folsom Street Events asserted that there was &quot;no intention to be particularly pro-religion or anti-religion with this poster; the image is intended only to be reminiscent of the &quot;Last Supper&quot; painting. It is a distinctive representation of diversity with women and men, people of all colors and sexual orientations&quot; and added &quot;we are going to produce a series of inspired poster images over the next few years. Next year&#x27;s poster ad may take inspiration from &quot;American Gothic&quot; by Grant Wood or Edvard Munch&#x27;s &quot;The Scream&quot; or even &quot;The Sound of Music&quot;!&quot; He also called those offended by the poster &quot;extreme members of the global community&quot;.

The Catholic League, Concerned Women for America and the Family Research Council targeted the largest mainstream sponsor of the event, Miller Brewing Company, threatening to boycott their products for the company&#x27;s support of the event and allowing its logo to appear in the ad. Miller asked for its logo to be removed from the poster: &quot;we take exception to the poster the organizing committee developed this year. We understand that some individuals may find the imagery offensive.&quot;
Subsequently, the Catholic League ended the boycott. Nancy Pelosi, congresswoman for San Francisco and then Speaker of the U.S. House of Representatives, opined at a press conference: &quot;I do not believe Christianity has been harmed by the Folsom Street Fair.&quot;

== Books ==
In 2017, Fair Page Media published &quot;The Mayor of Folsom Street&quot;. The biography of Alan Selby includes insights into the early days of the Folsom Street Fair.

In 2018, Delancey Street Press published the &quot;Folsom Street Food Court&quot;, with images captured by Michael Rababy. The book is a documentary photography monograph that captures San Francisco&#x27;s Folsom Street Fair. The unguarded images feature people in various states of dress and undress in the rarely photographed street fair food court. The book documents two years shot a decade apart, 2007 and 2017, to demonstrate that although the city of San Francisco has gentrified over time, the Folsom Street Fair seems to maintain its authenticity.

<text>Living Sacrifice is an American Christian metal band formed in Little Rock, Arkansas, in 1989. The band has released eight studio albums, out of which the first three were recorded under R.E.X. Records with their original vocalist Darren Johnson, starting off as thrash metal, followed by death metal. The band evolved into a groove metal and metalcore style beginning with &quot;Reborn&quot; (1997) under Solid State Records with the original guitarist Bruce Fitzhugh on vocals. In 2003, the group disbanded due to other projects and later their label, Solid State, released their best-of album, &quot;In Memoriam&quot; (2005). In 2008, Living Sacrifice reformed and released a two-song digital only single called &quot;Death Machine&quot;. They then began working on &quot;The Infinite Order&quot; which was released on January 26, 2010. Lance Garvin and Bruce Fitzhugh are the two remaining original members.

== History ==

Living Sacrifice was one of the first Christian death metal bands along with Sacrament and Mortification. The band, whose name is derived from , formed in 1989 by Darren &quot;D.J.&quot; Johnson (bass, vocals), Bruce Fitzhugh (guitar), and Lance Garvin (drums); Jason Truby later joined in on guitar. The band would perform their debut show on December 1, 1989, in front of a hall of nurses. They released a three-song demo in 1990, &quot;Not Yielding to Ungodly&quot;, which got into the hands of Kurt Bachman and Joey Daub from Believer, who signed them to R.E.X. Records.

In 1991, Living Sacrifice&#x27;s self-titled debut album was released on R.E.X. Records. The album was recorded at Catamount Recording Studio in Iowa with Kurt Bachman acting as a producer. The album received many comparisons to thrash metal groups of the time, especially Slayer. On November 17, 1992, Living Sacrifice released their second album, &quot;Nonexistent&quot;. On this album, Living Sacrifice switched from thrash metal to down-tuned death metal, and D.J. started experimenting with a death growl in his vocal approach. The members have said that they were disappointed with the experience of making this album and that the producer was to blame. The producer had no prior experience with working on metal albums and did not know how to work with the band. The band had initially reached out to Scott Burns of Morrisound Recording (Death, Atheist, Obituary), but the label stated the band had to have the album out before Cornerstone Festival of 1992, which did not work with Burns&#x27; schedule. Since the engineer was unaware of the proper techniques, Johnson and Garvin attempted to work on the engineering side themselves.

In 1994, the band released a third album, &quot;Inhabit&quot;, which is considered by some to be the heaviest of all Living Sacrifice albums. On &quot;Inhabit&quot;, D.J. returned to a more thrash-oriented vocal approach, deeper and lower in tone than his vocals on the band&#x27;s debut. To support the album, the band embarked on a tour with Malevolent Creation. After this recording R.E.X. went bankrupt, and Living Sacrifice signed onto Solid State Records seeking to widen their audience.

After this, D.J. left the band to follow non-musical ministry, and Bruce took over vocals. Jason&#x27;s brother, Chris, also joined on bass. With this new lineup, Living Sacrifice recorded &quot;Reborn&quot;, their Solid State debut, in 1997. The band started to play a mix of groove metal and metalcore. &quot;Reborn&quot; is considered the most influential of all Living Sacrifice records and earned them a larger non-Christian fanbase. After this record, Chris and Jason left the band and close and longtime friend Jay Stacy filled in on bass while Cory Brandan Putman played on guitar. Stacy has lived down the street from Garvin and had known the band for a longtime. The band embarked on a few tours with the line of Fitzhugh, Garvin, Stacy, and Putman, including a tour with Cannibal Corpse and Angelcorpse. In 1999, Stacy stepped down from the band to focus on his family and was replaced by Arthur Green, formerly of Eso-Charis. Cory played guitar for a tour through Norway and Sweden but was then replaced by Rocky Gray (who would go on to play drums in Evanescence and We Are the Fallen and guitar in Soul Embraced.) At the end of 1999, Matthew Putman joined Living Sacrifice as a percussionist.

In 2000, Living Sacrifice recorded their fifth full-length album, &quot;The Hammering Process&quot;, with a more rhythmical soundâmore oriented towards groove metal. Bruce also sang in one Evanescence song, &quot;Lies&quot;. In 2001, &quot;A Tribute to Living Sacrifice&quot; was released. The album contains covers of many Living Sacrifice songs by other metal bands and former members, and a Living Sacrifice song from a split EP, &quot;Metamorphosis&quot;, released in 1993. In 2002, Living Sacrifice entered the studio again, resulting in the album &quot;Conceived in Fire&quot;. In June 2003, Living Sacrifice canceled the rest of one of their tours and announced that Living Sacrifice was disbanding.

Each of the band members had other commitments, such as Lance Garvin and Rocky Gray&#x27;s Soul Embraced, and felt it was time to move on. According to several interviews, it was only supposed to be Bruce Fitzhugh&#x27;s final tour, and after he left, Cory Brandan Putman was supposed to take over Lead Vocals and Rhythm Guitar, and Bryan Gray, formerly of The Blamed was to take over Lead Guitar.

In March 2005, &quot;In Memoriam&quot; was released by Solid State Records. It is a &quot;best of&quot; album, containing three &quot;newly written and recorded songs by Lance Garvin, Rocky Gray and Bruce Fitzhugh&quot;, two songs from each Living Sacrifice album, plus &quot;Enthroned&quot;, a 1998 cover of a song originally released on 1992&#x27;s &quot;Nonexistent&quot;. The three new songs are &quot;In Christ&quot;, &quot;Killers&quot;, and &quot;The Power of God&quot;.
In 2007, Bruce Fitzhugh was featured on the song &quot;Sixteen&quot;, on Demon Hunter&#x27;s fourth album &quot;Storm the Gates of Hell&quot;.

On February 4, 2008, a newly created official MySpace page was updated to announce the reformation of the band. They also announced their support of Demon Hunter in the &quot;Stronger Than Hell&quot; tour from May 26 through July 5, 2008. On June 10, 2008, Living Sacrifice released a two-song, online-only sampler, &quot;Death Machine&quot;. On the same day at the Dallas, Texas date of the &quot;Stronger Than Hell&quot; tour, vocalist and rhythm guitarist Bruce Fitzhugh announced that the band was working on a new CD which they hoped to release in 2009. The album release was delayed by Solid State and eventually came out on January 26, 2010. A music video for their lead single off &quot;The Infinite Order&quot;, &quot;Rules of Engagement&quot;, was aired December 22.

The band&#x27;s seventh studio album, &quot;The Infinite Order&quot;, was released January 26, 2010, via Solid State Records. The album features the voices of David Bunton from The Showdown, Joe Musten from Advent and Beloved, and guitarist Jason Truby. The album was mixed and mastered by Andy Sneap, Hell guitarist. Track three references the phrase &quot;God is dead&quot; by Friedrich Nietzsche. Released in November, the deluxe edition contained three additional tracks, two live songs and a new track.

In 2013, after three years of touring, Living Sacrifice recorded their eighth album, &quot;Ghost Thief&quot;, released November 12, 2013, on Solid State Records. The first song named &quot;The Reaping&quot; was premiered on October 17, 2013, on the Solid State YouTube page. The album features the guest voices of Ryan Clark from Demon Hunter on &quot;Screwtape&quot;, and Dave Peters from Throwdown on &quot;Despair&quot;. The title song, &quot;Ghost Thief&quot;, premiered November 6, 2013, on &quot;Revolver&quot; magazine website. Living Sacrifice is featured on the &quot;Killing Floor 2 Soundtrack&quot;. The band performed their first shows of 2017 on the ShipRocked cruise alongside bands such as Pop Evil, Breaking Benjamin, Papa Roach, Sevendust and Lacey Sturm.

According to former vocalist DJ Johnson, a friend of the band&#x27;s is developing a documentary of the band. In 2017, the band released &quot;New Day&quot; on a benefit compilation, &quot;We Bear the Scars&quot;. The track was originally supposed to be a part of &quot;The Hammering Process&quot;, but the band and producer Barry Poynter lost the track during the mixing process. The band&#x27;s documentary, &quot;30 Years of Sacrifice&quot;, was to debut at the band&#x27;s 30th anniversary show on March 28, 2020, and feature The Blamed, and former members Darren Johnson, Jason and Chris Truby, as well as Embodyment and The Famine drummer Mark Garza on percussion. Due to COVID-19, however, the premiere of the documentary was postponed.

In 2021, Nordic Mission released a remaster of Living Sacrifice&#x27;s self-titled debut album for its 30th anniversary. In 2022, Nordic Mission release a remixed and remaster of Nonexistent on Vinyl and CD. The second album by the band.

<text>William Henry Steeves (May 20, 1814 â December 9, 1873) was a merchant, lumberman, politician and Father of Canadian Confederation.

== Early life and education ==
William Henry Steeves was born on May 20, 1814, in Hillsborough, New Brunswick, the eldest son born to parents Joseph Steeves and Martha Gross. His great-grandparents, Heinrich and Regina Stief, were German immigrants who settled in the area after initially migrating to Pennsylvania; they founded the surname &quot;Steeves&quot; in North America. Steeves was educated in public school, where he later recounted receiving &quot;much more education than was usually acquired in New Brunswick by persons attending only public school,&quot; which he attributed to being as a result of being taught by Duncan Shaw, a Scottish-born University of Edinburgh alumnus.

== Business career ==
Steeves initially ran a small store before joining his brothers, James and Gilbert, in their Hillsborough-based lumber exporting business partnership known as Steeves Brothers. After moving to Saint John, Steeves furthered the business and established himself as a prominent figure in the city&#x27;s financial community. Gilbert, his brother, also expanded business operations in Liverpool, England.

== Political career ==
In 1846, Albert County was created; this saw the additional creation of its corresponding electoral district, Albert, and Steeves was elected to the New Brunswick assembly as one of the district&#x27;s first representatives. During his second term, he attended just one session after his re-election in 1850. Steeves supported government reform as well as requirements for Legislative Council members to be elected rather than appointed; he voted to pass a bill for such legislation in 1851, though it did not pass. In December 1851, he was appointed to the position. Given his location in Saint John, he may have been sought the following year by Sir Edmund Walker Head, the Lieutenant Governor, to serve as Surveyor General, which was ultimately taken by Robert Duncan Wilmot after Steeves chose not to take the position.

In 1854, the compact government that had ruled the colony was finally defeated by a reform administration and Steeves became Surveyor General in the new government. He resigned the appointment later that year due to opposition to an unelected person from the Legislative Council being appointed rather than an elected member of the House of Assembly.

In 1855, Steeves became the first chairman of the Department of Public Works. He left government in 1856 when the reform administration of Samuel Leonard Tilley was defeated over prohibition, but he returned to office with Tilley in 1857 and remained commissioner of public works until 1861. He continued in Tilley&#x27;s government as minister without portfolio until 1865 when the government fell due to its support for Canadian Confederation.

Steeves was a representative for New Brunswick at the Charlottetown Conference and Quebec Conference in 1864 to discuss the merging of the eastern British colonies of North America into a confederation of Canada. As a result of participating in these conferences, he holds the status of being one of the Fathers of Confederation. Steeves was not recorded making any significant speeches during these conferences, though he did support Samuel Leonard Tilley.

Following the July 1867 creation of the Senate of Canada, Steeves was appointed for New Brunswick as a Liberal. In that body, he acted as an advocate for the better care of the mentally ill. He served in the Senate until his death.

== Personal life and death ==
Steeves married his second cousin, Mary Steeves, in his early 20s; they had seven children, six of whom survived to adulthood.

In his later years, Steeves had worked as a ship broker and managed various ships, and had spent time in Liverpool, England. He died in his home in Saint John on December 9, 1873, and his funeral was held three days later. He was buried at Fernhill Cemetery; his grave bears a plaque, given his designation as a National Historic Person. Steeves is also the maternal great-granduncle of Jack Layton, a prominent left-wing academic and politician who led the New Democratic Party to its most successful point in the party&#x27;s history.

<doc id="838942" wikidata="Q6047872" url="?curid=838942" title="Internal improvements">
<text>Internal improvements is the term used historically in the United States for public works from the end of the American Revolution through much of the 19th century, mainly for the creation of a transportation infrastructure: roads, turnpikes, canals, harbors and navigation improvements. This older term carries the connotation of a political movement that called for the exercise of public spirit as well as the search for immediate economic gain. Improving the country&#x27;s natural advantages by developments in transportation was, in the eyes of George Washington and many others, a duty incumbent both on governments and on individual citizens.

==Background==
While the need for inland transportation improvements was universally recognized, there were great differences over the questions of how these should be planned, funded, developed, and constructed. Also, with various routes available, questions of where these improvements should be made, and by whom (the federal government, the individual states, or local jurisdictions), became the basis of political and regional contention. Federal assistance for &quot;internal improvements&quot; evolved slowly and haphazardly; it became the product of contentious congressional factions and an executive branch generally concerned with avoiding unconstitutional federal intrusions into state affairs.

Late project successes, both European and pre-revolutionary, demonstrated the time and cost savings as well as greater potential commerce and profit which these improvements created, but the early inability of Congress to develop a system of appropriations hobbled federal efforts; this threw responsibility for internal improvements on the states, following the veto of the Bonus Bill of 1817. New York scored fabulous success in 1825 with completion of its Erie Canal, but other state programs sank due to a combination of excessive ambition, shaky financing, and internal squabbling. One early government-funded project was the Cumberland Road, which Congress approved in 1806 to build a road between the Potomac River and the Ohio River; it was later pressed on through Ohio and Indiana and halfway through Illinois, as well along what is now U.S. Route 40. It became the National Road and was the single largest project of the antebellum era, with nearly US$7 million in federal dollars spent between 1806 and 1841. The debates on Ohio statehood and on the Cumberland Road apparently included no significant discussion of the Constitutional questions involved.

The issue of government subsidies for internal improvements was a key point of contention between the two major political factions in America for the first sixty years of the 19th century, specifically the mercantilist Hamiltonian Federalists and the more-or-less &quot;laissez faire&quot; Jeffersonian Democratic-Republicans. Political support began with Alexander Hamilton and his Report on Manufactures at the turn of the 19th century, and continued with the Whig Party, led by Henry Clay from 1832 until its demise in 1852, and then by the Republican Party from its formation in 1856. Support for internal improvements became a part of the economic plan, and the economic school of thought that would develop, but it would not come easily.

While the Federalist strand of republicanism defended internal improvements as agents of the &quot;general welfare&quot; or &quot;public good&quot;, another strand unraveled from the republican tapestry to denounce such schemes as &quot;corruption&quot;, taxing the many to benefit the few. Critics of internal improvement schemes did not have to dig deep under the veneer of &quot;public good&quot; to uncover self-interest. Washington&#x27;s scheme for Potomac River improvement also happened to pass conveniently by his Mount Vernon estate and extend westward toward some of undeveloped land in his possession. By the end of the 1790s, leaders of the emerging Democratic-Republican Party regularly assaulted the &quot;monied gentry&quot; and their improvement plans as visionary and extravagant, and gradually eroded public confidence in government action and authority. In their assaults on the Federalists&#x27; national agenda, Old Republicans perfected a language of opposition that provided the template for almost all future critiques of federal power: fear of centralized power, burdening taxpayers, taxing one locale for the benefit of another, creating self-perpetuating bureaucracies, distant governments undermining local authority, and subsidizing the schemes of the wealthy at public expense.

==Early development==
The federal role in funding and constructing internal improvements was one of the most persistent and contentious issues of American politics in the years after the revolution. With independence, elites based in the various regional economies of the American coastal plain did share an interest in developing the transportation infrastructure of the country. Unlike Europe, they were isolated from one another by poor inland transportation links and the legacy of their colonial trading patterns, and separated from their interior lands by formidable geographic obstacles. George Washington repeatedly pressed his vision of a network of canals and highways to be created and overseen through the auspices of wise leaders at the head of an active republican government. This initial thrust for internal improvements fell victim to what Washington considered the narrow-minded and provincial outlook of the individual states, and federal authority hamstrung by the Articles of Confederation to the point of impotence.

The fledgling government, however, set historic precedent and broad transportation policy in 1787 concerning new lands west of the original colonies in the Northwest Ordinance; it established free usage of its inland waterways and their connecting portages, and expressed this intent for any other lands and resources in future states. While some consider that Washington watched as rivalries between the states of Maryland and Virginia gradually rendered his Potomac Company null and void by withholding public monies, out of fear that a rival state might derive greater benefit from their own appropriations, others consider these events in a different light. The preliminary report of the Inland Waterways Commission issued in 1908, provides a unique topical perspective on these and other concurrent historical events on-going at the time. It notes: &quot;The earliest movement toward developing the inland waterways of the country began when, under the influence of George Washington, Virginia and Maryland appointed commissioners primarily to consider the navigation and improvement of the Potomac; they met in 1785 in Alexandria and adjourned to Mount Vernon, where they planned for extension, pursuant to which they reassembled with representatives of other States in Annapolis in 1786; again finding the task a growing one, a further conference was arranged in Philadelphia in 1787, with delegates from all the States. There the deliberations resulted in the framing of the Constitution, whereby the thirteen original States were united primarily on a commercial basis âthe commerce of the times being chiefly by water.&quot;

Although the country already had an extensive coastline, inland river systems, and the largest freshwater lake system in the world, the 1803 Louisiana Purchase greatly enhanced the area claimed, as well as the need for developmental improvement. The acquisition brought the combined lands of the Missouri, Ohio, and Mississippi River basins all under federal control.

Many Americans also shared the belief that increased inter-regional communications would strengthen the fragile union by fostering shared economic interests. The case for federally funded internal improvements was thus strong, because such a program could serve both local and national economic interests as well as a critical nation-building role. Promoters furthermore made a convincing case that only the federal government could effect the desired projects, since the federal budget typically operated in surplus while the states lacked adequate resources, and the states faced difficult coordination problems best solved through national political institutions. Secretary of the Treasury Albert Gallatin&#x27;s 1808 &quot;Report on the Subject of Public Roads and Canals&quot; was one such early plan.

==Later efforts==
Henry Clay&#x27;s &quot;American System&quot;, devised in the burst of nationalism that followed the War of 1812, remains one of the most historically significant examples of a government-sponsored program to harmonize and balance the nation&#x27;s agriculture, commerce, and industry. This &quot;System&quot; consisted of three mutually reinforcing parts: a tariff to protect and promote American industry; a national bank to foster commerce; and federal subsidies for roads, canals, and other &quot;internal improvements&quot; to develop profitable markets for agriculture. Funds for these subsidies would be obtained from tariffs and sales of public lands. Clay argued that a vigorously maintained system of sectional economic interdependence would eliminate the chance of renewed subservience to the free-trade, laissez-faire &quot;British System.&quot; In the years from 1816 to 1828, Congress enacted programs supporting each of the American System&#x27;s major elements. After the 1829 inauguration of Andrew Jackson, with his administration&#x27;s emphasis on a limited role for the federal government and sectional autonomy, the American System became the focus of anti-Jackson opposition that coalesced into the new Whig Party under the leadership of Henry Clay.

<doc id="838947" wikidata="Q7590184" url="?curid=838947" title="St Mary's Church, Rotherhithe">
<text>St Mary&#x27;s Church, Rotherhithe, is the local Church of England parish church in Rotherhithe, formerly in Surrey and now part of south east London. The parish is now within the diocese of Southwark and under the jurisdiction of the Bishop of Fulham. The 18th-century church is in &quot;StÂ Marychurch Street&quot; and is dedicated to Mary, mother of Jesus, and it is particularly proud of its connections with the Pilgrim Fathers. It remains a living and working church, supported by local people and serving a broad community.

==History==
There is documentary evidence that a church has existed on this site since at least 1282. However, Roman bricks were found when the tower was underpinned in 1913, so it is probable that there were even earlier buildings on the site.

The area was eventually served by Catholic priests from Bermondsey Abbey. Following the break with Rome under Henry VIII in 1538, the vestments, silver and gold plate and other gifts of the cathedral were sold to provide money to repair the mediaeval church.

Some remains of the mediaeval building can still be seen, for example the stone blocks incorporated into the walls on each side of the organ. In the crypt, parts of the old church walls of chalk and flint are visible, and some later Tudor brickwork. A drawing made of this building in 1623 has survived. Although the artist had difficulty representing the perspective of the old church, this drawing is the only remaining evidence of its appearance. A few memorials from the old church have survived.

In 1710, the parishioners of St Mary&#x27;s petitioned parliament for a grant to rebuild their church &#x27;which standing very low and near the banks of the Thames, is often overflowed, whereby the foundation of the church and tower is rotted and in great danger of falling&#x27;. The petition was not successful but the parishioners went on to collect subscriptions and the local craftsmen, of which there were many, turned their hands and feet to church building.

It was rebuilt in 1714â15, to a design by John James, a major architect of his day (and an associate of Sir Christopher Wren). As money was short, the tower &quot;(above right)&quot; was not finished until 1747, when Lancelot Dowbiggin, a City joiner and surveyor, completed it, perhaps to his own design, following the general plan of James.

Since then, the external appearance of the church has remained almost unchanged. It is set in a narrow street close to the Thames, surrounded by former warehouses and facing the charity school house which was built in 1703.

In 1760, Birmingham industrialist Matthew Boulton wed his second wife, Anne, here. The two had journeyed far from home to evade ecclesiastical difficulties; she was his first wife&#x27;s sister, and the marriage was forbidden by canon law, but not void if no one objected when the banns were read.

In 1838, when the well-known ship Temeraire was broken up, some of her timbers were used to build a communion table and two bishop&#x27;s chairs in the Rotherhithe church.

The interior of the church was much altered in 1876.

Between 1996 and 1999, the bells were restored and re-hung, and essential repairs made to the spire. The bells are regularly rung by members of the Docklands Ringing Centre.

===Present day===
St Mary&#x27;s Church is within the Anglo-Catholic tradition of the Church of England. As the parish rejects the ordination of women, it receives alternative episcopal oversight from the Bishop of Fulham (currently Jonathan Baker).

==The organ==

St Mary&#x27;s Church, Rotherhithe is fortunate to possess a fine pipe-organ dating from 1764 installed by the organ builder John Byfield II.

Despite several alterations in the intervening years the present-day instrument retains much of its original character and its magnificent organ case.

A history of the instrument can be found at https://alanjohnphillips.weebly.com/rotherhithe.html#history

==Maritime connections==

As befits a church near the merchant activity on the river, there are several maritime connections. The communion table in the Lady Chapel and two bishop&#x27;s chairs are made from salvaged timber from the warship HMS &quot;Temeraire&quot;. The ship&#x27;s final journey to the breaker&#x27;s yard at Deptford was made famous by Turner in his evocative painting &quot;The Fighting Temeraire&quot;, now in the National Gallery.

In the church a memorial marks the final resting place of Christopher Jones, captain of the &quot;Mayflower&quot;, which took the Pilgrim Fathers to North America in 1620.

It is also the burial place of Prince Lee Boo of Palau, a Pacific Island prince, and Vice Admiral Sir Thomas Teddeman (c.1620â1668).

Nearby are some of London&#x27;s Nordic churches and missions to seafarers.

<doc id="838950" wikidata="Q158957" url="?curid=838950" title="Priyanka Chopra">
<text>Priyanka Chopra Jonas (; Chopra; born 18 July 1982) is an Indian actress and producer. The winner of the Miss World 2000 pageant, Chopra is one of India&#x27;s highest-paid actresses and has received numerous accolades, including two National Film Awards and five Filmfare Awards. In 2016, the Government of India honoured her with the Padma Shri, and &quot;Time&quot; named her one of the 100 most influential people in the world. In the next two years, &quot;Forbes&quot; listed her among the World&#x27;s 100 Most Powerful Women, and in 2022, she was named in the BBC &quot;100 Women&quot; list.

Chopra accepted offers to join the Indian film industry following her pageant wins. Her acting debut came in the Tamil film &quot;Thamizhan&quot; (2002), followed by her first Bollywood feature in &quot;The Hero: Love Story of a Spy&quot; (2003). She played the leading lady in the box-office hits &quot;Andaaz&quot; (2003) and &quot;Mujhse Shaadi Karogi&quot; (2004) and had her breakout role in the 2004 romantic thriller &quot;Aitraaz&quot;. Chopra established herself with starring roles in the top-grossing productions &quot;Krrish&quot; and &quot;Don&quot; (both 2006), and later reprised her role in their sequels. For playing a troubled model in the drama &quot;Fashion&quot; (2008), Chopra won a National Film Award and a Filmfare Award for Best Actress. Chopra gained further praise for portraying a range of characters in the films &quot;Kaminey&quot; (2009), &quot;7 Khoon Maaf&quot; (2011), &quot;Barfi!&quot; (2012), &quot;Mary Kom&quot; (2014), &quot;Dil Dhadakne Do&quot; (2015), and &quot;Bajirao Mastani&quot; (2015).

From 2015 to 2018, Chopra starred as Alex Parrish in the ABC thriller series &quot;Quantico&quot;, becoming the first South Asian to headline an American network drama series. Founding the production company Purple Pebble Pictures in 2015, she produced several films under it, including the Marathi films &quot;Ventilator&quot; (2016) and &quot;Paani&quot; (2019), and the self-starring Hindi biopic &quot;The Sky Is Pink&quot; (2019). Chopra has also appeared in Hollywood films, such as &quot;Baywatch&quot; (2017), &quot;Isn&#x27;t It Romantic&quot; (2019), &quot;The White Tiger&quot; (2021), and &quot;The Matrix Resurrections&quot; (2021), and starred in the action thriller series &quot;Citadel&quot; (2023âpresent).

Chopra ventured into music by releasing three singles and into writing with her memoir &quot;Unfinished&quot; (2021), which reached &quot;The New York Times&quot; Best Seller list. Her other ventures include tech investments, a haircare brand, a restaurant, and a homeware line. She promotes social causes such as environment and women&#x27;s rights and is vocal about gender equality, the gender pay gap, and feminism. She has worked with UNICEF since 2006 and was appointed as the national and global UNICEF Goodwill Ambassador for child rights in 2010 and 2016, respectively. Her namesake foundation for health and education works towards providing support to underprivileged Indian children. Despite maintaining privacy, Chopra&#x27;s off-screen life, including her marriage to American singer and actor Nick Jonas, is the subject of substantial media coverage. The couple has one daughter.

== Early life ==
Chopra was born on 18 July 1982 in Jamshedpur, Bihar (present-day Jharkhand), to Ashok and Madhu Chopra, both physicians in the Indian Army. Her father was a Punjabi Hindu from Ambala. Her mother is a Bihari-Magahi Hindu from Jharkhand and is the eldest daughter of Dr. Manohar Kishan Akhouri, a former Congress veteran, and Madhu Jyotsna Akhouri, a former member of Bihar Legislative Assembly. Chopra&#x27;s maternal grandmother, Mrs. Akhouri, was a Malayalee Jacobite Syrian Christian originally named Mary John, who belonged to the Kavalappara Nair family in Kumarakom, Kerala. Chopra has a brother, Siddharth, who is seven years her junior. Bollywood actresses Parineeti Chopra, Meera Chopra, and Mannara Chopra are her cousins.

Owing to Chopra&#x27;s parents&#x27; professions as military physicians, the family was posted in a number of places in India, including Delhi, Chandigarh, Ambala, Ladakh, Lucknow, Bareilly, and Pune. Among the schools she attended were La Martiniere Girls&#x27; School in Lucknow and St. Maria Goretti College in Bareilly. In an interview published in &quot;Daily News and Analysis&quot;, Chopra said that she did not mind travelling regularly and changing schools; she welcomed it as a new experience and a way to discover India&#x27;s multicultural society. Among the many places that she lived, Chopra has fond memories as a child of playing in the valleys of Leh, in the cold northwestern Indian desert region of Ladakh. She had said, &quot;I think I was in Class 4 when I was in Leh. My brother was just born. My dad was in the army and was posted there. I stayed in Leh for a year, and my memories of that place are tremendous. We were all army kids there. We weren&#x27;t living in houses, we were in bunkers in the valley and there was a stupa right on top of a hill which used to overlook our valley. We used to race up to the top of the stupa&quot;. She now considers Bareilly her home town, and maintains strong connections there.

At 13, Chopra moved to the United States to study, living with her aunt, and attending schools in Newton, Massachusetts, and Cedar Rapids, Iowa, after a stop in Queens, New York, as her aunt&#x27;s family also moved frequently. While in Massachusetts, she participated in several theatre productions, and studied Western classical music, and choral singing. During her teenage years in the United States, Chopra sometimes faced racial issues and was bullied for being Indian by an African-American classmate. She has said, &quot;I was a gawky kid, had low self-esteem, came from a modest middle-class background, had white marks on my legs. But I was damn hard working. Today, my legs sell 12 brands.&quot; After three years, Chopra returned to India, finishing the senior year of her high-school education at the Army Public School in Bareilly.

During this period, Chopra won the local May Queen beauty pageant, after which she was pursued by admirers; her family equipped their home with bars for her protection. Her mother entered her in the Femina Miss India contest of 2000; she finished second, winning the Femina Miss India World title. Chopra next won the Miss World pageant, where she was crowned Miss World 2000 and Miss World Continental Queen of BeautyAsia &amp; Oceania at the Millennium Dome in London on 30 November 2000. Chopra was the fifth Indian contestant to win Miss World, and the fourth to do so within seven years. She had enrolled in college, but left after winning the Miss World pageant. Chopra said that the Miss India and Miss World titles brought her recognition, and she began receiving offers for film roles. In 2001, the bridge of Chopra&#x27;s nose collapsed during nasal surgery to remove a polyp. She fell into depression over her &quot;completely different&quot; appearance, but was satisfied with the results of corrective surgeries.

== Acting career ==
=== Career beginnings and breakthrough (2002â2004) ===

After winning Miss India World, Chopra was cast as the female lead in AbbasâMustan&#x27;s romantic thriller &quot;Humraaz&quot; (2002), in which she was to make her film debut. However, this fell through for various reasons: she stated the production conflicted with her schedule, while the producers said they recast because Chopra took on various other commitments. Her screen debut occurred in the 2002 Tamil film &quot;Thamizhan&quot; as the love interest of the protagonist, played by Vijay. A review published in &quot;The Hindu&quot; was appreciative of the film for its wit and dialogue; however it felt that Chopra&#x27;s role was limited from an acting viewpoint.

In 2003, Chopra made her Bollywood film debut as the second female lead opposite Sunny Deol and Preity Zinta in Anil Sharma&#x27;s &quot;The Hero: Love Story of a Spy&quot;. Set against the backdrop of the Indian Army in Kashmir, the film tells the story of an RAW agent&#x27;s fight against terrorism. She later recounted her experience, admitting she was very nervous and &quot;shaking&quot; when she first met Deol. Despite rumors that she was not a good actress and discussions about possibly removing her from the film, Deol recognized her potential and insisted on giving her a chance to prove herself. &quot;The Hero&quot; emerged as one of the highest-grossing Bollywood films that year, but received mixed reviews from critics. Derek Elley from &quot;Variety&quot; said that &quot;mega-looker Chopra makes a solid screen debut.&quot; Later that year she appeared in Raj Kanwar&#x27;s box-office success &quot;Andaaz&quot; with Akshay Kumar, sharing the female lead with debutante Lara Dutta. Chopra played a vivacious young woman who falls in love with Kumar&#x27;s character. The &quot;Hindustan Times&quot; noted the glamour that she brought to the role; Kunal Shah of Sify praised her performance and stated she had &quot;all the qualities to be a star.&quot; Her performance earned her the Filmfare Award for Best Female Debut (along with Dutta) and a Best Supporting Actress nomination.

Chopra&#x27;s first three releases in 2004â&quot;Plan&quot;, &quot;Kismat&quot;, and &quot;Asambhav&quot;âperformed poorly at the box office. Chopra was typically cast during this earlier period as a &quot;glamour quotient&quot;, in roles that were considered forgettable by film critic Joginder Tuteja. Later that year she starred with Salman Khan and Akshay Kumar in David Dhawan&#x27;s romantic comedy &quot;Mujhse Shaadi Karogi&quot;, which opened to commercial success and emerged the third-highest-grossing film of the year in India.

In late 2004, she starred opposite Kumar and Kareena Kapoor in AbbasâMustan&#x27;s romantic thriller &quot;Aitraaz&quot;. Chopra considers her first role as an antagonist, portraying Soniya Roy, an ambitious woman who accuses her employee of sexual harassment, as the &quot;biggest learning experience of her career&quot;. The film was a critical and commercial success, and Chopra&#x27;s performance received critical acclaim. The &quot;Hindustan Times&quot; cited it as the film that changed her career significantly. A reviewer writing for the &quot;BBC&quot; said, &quot;&quot;Aitraaz&quot; is Chopra&#x27;s film. As the deliciously wicked, gold digging, scheming seductress, she chews up every scene she is in with her magnetic screen presence.&quot; She won a Filmfare Award for Best Performance in a Negative Role, becoming the second and final actress to win the award after Kajol (the category was discontinued in 2008). Chopra also received a nomination for the Filmfare Award for Best Supporting Actress, and the Producers Guild Film Award for Best Actress in a Supporting Role.

=== Rise to prominence (2005â2006) ===
In 2005, Chopra appeared in 6 films. Her first two releases, the action thrillers &quot;Blackmail&quot; and &quot;Karam&quot;, were critically and commercially unsuccessful. Shilpa Bharatan-Iyer of &quot;Rediff.com&quot; considered &quot;Blackmail&quot; to be a very predictable film and believed that her role as a police commissioner&#x27;s wife was very limited from an acting point of view. Her performance in &quot;Karam&quot; was better received, Subhash K. Jha wrote that Chopra &quot;with her poised interpretation of high drama, flies high creating a character whose vulnerability and beauty are endorsed by both the inner and outer worlds created for her character.&quot; Later that year Chopra played the wife of Akshay Kumar in Vipul Amrutlal Shah&#x27;s family drama &quot;&quot;, the story of a small businessman (played by Amitabh Bachchan) who, hiding his illness, wants to teach his irresponsible son some lessons before he dies. During production, Chopra revisited Leh, a favourite childhood haunt, for the shooting of the song &quot;Subah Hogi&quot;. She suffered an accident during the filming for the song &quot;Do Me A Favour Let&#x27;s Play Holi&quot; when she electrocuted herself, spending a day recovering in hospital. The film was well received by critics, and was a commercial success.

She next starred opposite Arjun Rampal in the romantic mystery thriller &quot;Yakeen&quot;, portraying the role of a possessive lover. Critical reaction towards the film was mixed, but her performance received praise. Taran Adarsh wrote that Chopra &quot;is bound to win laurels yet again [...] the actor is emerging as one of the finest talents in these fast-changing times&quot;. Her next release was Suneel Darshan&#x27;s romance &quot;Barsaat&quot;, co-starring Bobby Deol and Bipasha Basu. The film was a critical and commercial failure in India, but fared better in the overseas market. Chopra&#x27;s performance received mixed reviews, with Bollywood Hungama describing it as &quot;mechanical&quot;. However, Rediff.com considered Chopra to be an &quot;epitome of calm intelligence, who underplayed her role to perfection&quot;. Later that year, Rohan Sippy cast her alongside Abhishek Bachchan, Ritesh Deshmukh and Nana Patekar in the comedy &quot;Bluffmaster!&quot;. Chopra played independent working woman Simran Saxena, Bachchan&#x27;s love interest. The film proved to be a box-office success.

After starting 2006 with special appearances in three films, Chopra starred in Rakesh Roshan&#x27;s superhero film &quot;Krrish&quot; (a sequel to the 2003 science-fiction film &quot;Koi... Mil Gaya&quot;). Co-starring with Hrithik Roshan, Rekha and Naseeruddin Shah, Chopra played a young television journalist who schemes to take advantage of an innocent young man with remarkable physical abilities, but eventually falls in love with him. The film was the second-highest-grossing film of the year in India and grossed over worldwide attaining a blockbuster status. Her next film was Dharmesh Darshan&#x27;s romantic comedy &quot;Aap Ki Khatir&quot;, co-starring Akshaye Khanna, Ameesha Patel and Dino Morea. Neither the film nor Chopra&#x27;s performance were well received. Sukanya Verma of Rediff.com stated that Chopra&#x27;s portrayal of Anu was &quot;erratically sketched&quot; and that her character was never consistent: &quot;first flaky, then cool, and later, sensitive&quot;.

Chopra&#x27;s final release of 2006 was Farhan Akhtar&#x27;s action-thriller &quot;Don&quot; (a remake of the 1978 film of the same name), with Shah Rukh Khan. Chopra portrayed Roma (played by Zeenat Aman in the original film), who joins the underworld to avenge Don for killing her brother. Chopra received martial-arts training for her role in the movie, and performed her own stunts. The film was declared a box-office success in India and overseas, with revenues of . Raja Sen of Rediff.com found Chopra to be film&#x27;s &quot;big surprise&quot;; he believed that Chopra convincingly portrayed Roma, &quot;looking every bit the competent woman of action&quot; and wrote &quot;This is an actress willing to push herself, and has definite potential for screen magic. Not to mention a great smile.&quot;

=== Setbacks and resurgence (2007â2008) ===
In 2007, Chopra had two leading roles. Her first film was Nikhil Advani&#x27;s &quot;Salaam-e-Ishq: A Tribute to Love&quot;, a romantic comedy-drama in six chapters with an ensemble cast. She was featured opposite Salman Khan in the first chapter as Kamini, an item girl and aspiring actress who tries to land the lead role in a Karan Johar film with a publicity gimmick. Film critic Sukanya Verma praised her flair for comedy, especially her impressions of Meena Kumari, Nargis and Madhubala. Both &quot;Salaam-e-Ishq: A Tribute to Love&quot; and her next film, &quot;Big Brother&quot;, proved unsuccessful at the domestic box office.
In 2008, Chopra starred opposite Harman Baweja in his father&#x27;s &quot;Love Story 2050&quot;. Chopra played a double role, so she colored her hair twice; once red to portray the girl from the future and then black for the girl of the past. Her performance was poorly received; Rajeev Masand was unimpressed with Chopra&#x27;s chemistry with her co-star, remarking that her character &quot;fails to inspire either affection or sympathy&quot;. She next appeared in the comedy &quot;God Tussi Great Ho&quot;, portraying a TV anchor opposite Salman Khan, Sohail Khan and Amitabh Bachchan. Chopra next starred as a kindergarten teacher in &quot;Chamku&quot; opposite Bobby Deol and Irrfan Khan, and played the role of Sonia in Goldie Behl&#x27;s fantasy superhero film &quot;Drona&quot; opposite Abhishek Bachchan and Jaya Bachchan. &quot;Drona&quot;, widely criticized for its extensive use of special effects, marked Chopra&#x27;s sixth film in succession which had failed at both the box-office and critically, although Sukanya Verma of &quot;Rediff.com&quot; stated that Chopra displayed convincing action heroine skills. Critics generally perceived at this time that her career was over.

The string of poorly received films ended when Chopra starred in Madhur Bhandarkar&#x27;s &quot;Fashion&quot;, a drama about the Indian fashion industry which followed the lives and careers of several fashion models. She portrayed the ambitious supermodel Meghna Mathur, a role which she initially thought was out of her depth, but after six months&#x27; consideration she accepted the role, inspired by Bhandarkar&#x27;s confidence in her. For the role, Chopra had to gain and steadily shed the weight during the production as the character progressed in the film. Both the film and her performance received critical acclaim, proving to be a major turning point in her career. Rajeev Masand felt that she &quot;turns in a respectable performance, one that will inevitably go down as her best.&quot; For her performance, she won several awards, including the National Film Award for Best Actress, the Filmfare Award for Best Actress, the IIFA Award for Best Actress, the Screen Award for Best Actress, and the Producers Guild Film Award for Best Actress in a Leading Role. With a worldwide revenue of , &quot;Fashion&quot; emerged as a commercial success, and was listed by Subhash K. Jha as one of the best films of the decade with women protagonists. It was noted for being commercially successful despite being a women-centric film with no male lead. Chopra said in 2012: &quot;I think actually &quot;Fashion&quot; kick startedÂ ... the process of female dominated films. Today you have so many other films which have done well with female leads.&quot;

Chopra&#x27;s final film of the year was Tarun Mansukhani&#x27;s romantic comedy &quot;Dostana&quot;, with Abhishek Bachchan and John Abraham. Set in Miami, the film tells the story of a friendship between her character and two men who pretend to be gay to share an apartment with her. Chopra played a stylish young fashion-magazine editor Neha Melwani, who is trying to deal with professional pressures in her life. Produced by Dharma Productions, the film was a financial success with worldwide revenues of over . Chopra&#x27;s performance and look in the film were praised. For her performances in both &quot;Fashion&quot; and &quot;Dostana&quot;, she jointly won the Stardust Award for Actor of the Year â Female.

=== Experiment with unconventional roles (2009â2011) ===
In 2009, Chopra played a feisty Marathi woman named Sweety in Vishal Bhardwaj&#x27;s caper thriller &quot;Kaminey&quot; (co-starring Shahid Kapoor), about twin brothers and the journey in their life linked with the underworld. The film received critical acclaim and became successful at the box-office with the worldwide gross earnings of . Nikhat Kazmi of &quot;The Times of India&quot; thought that Chopra&#x27;s role completely reinvented her, and Rajeev Masand wrote: &quot;Springing a delightful surprise in a smaller part is [Chopra], who sprinkles her lines with a smattering of fluent Marathi and emerges one of the film&#x27;s most lovable characters.&quot; Raja Sen of &quot;Rediff.com&quot; named Chopra&#x27;s performance as the best by an actress that year. Her role earned her several awards and nominations, including a second consecutive Producers Guild Film Award for Best Actress in a Leading Role after &quot;Fashion&quot; and Best Actress nominations at the Filmfare, Screen and IIFA awards.
Chopra subsequently appeared in Ashutosh Gowariker&#x27;s romantic comedy &quot;What&#x27;s Your Raashee?&quot;, based on the novel &quot;Kimball Ravenswood&quot; by Madhu Rye. The film depicts the story of a US-based Gujrati NRI in search of his soulmate among 12 girls (all played by Chopra) associated with the 12 zodiac signs. She received a nomination for the Screen Award for Best Actress for her performance in the film. She was considered for inclusion in the &quot;Guinness World Records&quot; book for being the first film actress to portray 12 distinct characters in one film. Chopra&#x27;s heavy workloadfilming for several productions, travelling for endorsements and performing at live shows (including the Miss India pageant)took its toll; she fainted during filming, and was admitted to hospital. In 2010, Chopra starred with Uday Chopra in Jugal Hansraj&#x27;s romantic comedy &quot;Pyaar Impossible!&quot; as Alisha, a popular college girl (and later a working mother) who falls in love with a socially inept man. Later that year, she starred with Ranbir Kapoor in Siddharth Anand&#x27;s romantic comedy-drama &quot;Anjaana Anjaani&quot;. Set in New York and Las Vegas, the film follows the story of two suicidal strangers who fall in love with each other. The film received mixed-to-positive reviews from critics and was a commercial success at the box office.

She starred as a femme fatale in her first film of 2011, Vishal Bhardwaj&#x27;s black comedy &quot;7 Khoon Maaf&quot;. Based on the short story &quot;Susanna&#x27;s Seven Husbands&quot; by Ruskin Bond, &quot;7 Khoon Maaf&quot; centers on Chopra&#x27;s Susanna Anna-Marie Johannes, an Anglo-Indian woman who murders her husbands in an unending quest for love. The film and her performance received acclaim from critics. Nikhat Kazmi labelled the film &quot;a milestone in Chopra&#x27;s career graph&quot;, complimenting her &quot;exquisite command over a complex character that is definitely a first in Indian cinema&quot;. Rachel Saltz of &quot;New York Times&quot; felt that Susanna was more conceit than a character and that Chopra &quot;though charming as always, can&#x27;t make her cohere&quot;. Chopra&#x27;s performance earned her the Filmfare Award for Best Actress (Critics) and a nomination for the Filmfare Award, IIFA Award, Producers Guild Film Award, and Screen Award for Best Actress.

Chopra&#x27;s final release of the year saw her reprising her role as Roma in the second installment of the &quot;Don&quot; franchise, &quot;Don 2&quot;. Although the film received mixed reviews, Chopra&#x27;s performance earned positive feedback from critics. According to &quot;The Express Tribune&quot;, &quot;ChopraÂ ... seems to be the perfect choice for an action heroine. As you watch her effortlessly beat up some thugs in the movie, you come to the realization that she may be the first proper female action hero in Bollywood.&quot; &quot;Don 2&quot; was a major success in India and overseas, earning over worldwide.

=== Further success (2012â2014) ===
Chopra&#x27;s first film of 2012 was Karan Malhotra&#x27;s action drama &quot;Agneepath&quot;, in which she starred with Hrithik Roshan, Sanjay Dutt and Rishi Kapoor. Produced by Karan Johar, the film is a remake of his father&#x27;s 1990 production of the same name. In one of several accidents to happen during production, Chopra&#x27;s &quot;lehenga&quot; (a traditional skirt) caught fire while filming a sequence for an elaborate Ganpati festival song. She featured as Kaali Gawde, Roshan&#x27;s loquacious love interest in the film. Mayank Shekhar noted how much Chopra stood out in the male-dominated film. &quot;Agneepath&quot; broke Bollywood&#x27;s highest opening-day earnings record, and had a worldwide gross of . Chopra next co-starred with Shahid Kapoor in Kunal Kohli&#x27;s romance, &quot;Teri Meri Kahaani&quot;. The film relates the stories of three unconnected couples (each played by Kapoor and Chopra), born in different eras.
Anurag Basu&#x27;s &quot;Barfi!&quot;, with Ranbir Kapoor and Ileana D&#x27;Cruz, was her final appearance of 2012. Set in the 1970s, the film tells the story of three people, two of whom are physically disabled. Chopra played Jhilmil Chatterjee, an autistic woman who falls in love with a deaf, mute man (Kapoor). Director Rituparno Ghosh considered it a &quot;very, very brave&quot; role to accept given how demanding it is for an actor to convincingly portray a woman with autism. To prepare for the role, Chopra visited several mental institutions and spent time with autistic people. The film received critical acclaim and was a major commercial success, earning worldwide. Rachit Gupta of &quot;Filmfare&quot; found Chopra to be the film&#x27;s &quot;surprise package&quot; and found her performance to be &quot;the best representation of [autism] on Indian celluloid&quot;. Pratim D. Gupta of &quot;The Telegraph&quot; highly praised Kapoor and Chopra, although he found her to be a &quot;tad showy&quot; in her part. Chopra received Best Actress nominations at the Filmfare, Screen, IIFA and Producers Guild Film Awards. The film was chosen as India&#x27;s entry for the 85th Academy Awards. &quot;Agneepath&quot; and &quot;Barfi!&quot; ranked among the highest grossing Bollywood films to that point.

In 2013, she lent her voice to the character of Ishaani, the reigning Pan-Asian champion from India and the love interest of the main protagonist in the Disneytoon Studios film &quot;Planes&quot;, a spinoff of Pixar&#x27;s &quot;Cars&quot; franchise. Chopra, a fan of Disney films, had fun voicing the character saying &quot;The closest I could come to being a Disney princess, I think, was Ishaani&quot;. The film was a commercial success, grossing approximately US$240Â million worldwide. She played an NRI girl in the Apoorva Lakhia&#x27;s bilingual action drama &quot;Zanjeer&quot; (&quot;Thoofan&quot; in Telugu), a remake of the 1973 Hindi film of the same name, which met with poor reactions from critics and was unsuccessful at the box office. Chopra next reprised her role of Priya in Rakesh Roshan&#x27;s &quot;Krrish 3&quot;a sequel to the 2006 superhero film &quot;Krrish&quot;with Hrithik Roshan, Vivek Oberoi and Kangana Ranaut. Critics felt that Chopra had very little to do in the film. Saibal Chatterjee of NDTV writing that she &quot;is saddled with a sketchily written role and is reduced to the status of a hanger-on waiting for things to unfold&quot;. The feature became a box-office success, earning over worldwide, to become Chopra&#x27;s biggest commercial success to that point and her fourth major hit in two years. She danced a contemporary mujra in the song &quot;Ram Chahe Leela&quot; for Sanjay Leela Bhansali&#x27;s &quot;Goliyon Ki Raasleela Ram-Leela.&quot;

In 2014, Chopra played the lead female role in Yash Raj Films&#x27;s romantic action drama &quot;Gunday&quot; directed by Ali Abbas Zafar, alongside Ranveer Singh, Arjun Kapoor and Irrfan Khan. She portrayed Nandita, a cabaret dancer in Calcutta. Set in the 1970s, the film tells the story of two best friends who fall in love with Nandita. &quot;Gunday&quot; proved to be a box-office success, grossing over worldwide. Chopra next starred as the title character in &quot;Mary Kom&quot;, a biographical film of the five time world boxing champion and Olympic bronze medalist Mary Kom. To prepare for the role, she spent time with Kom and received four months of boxing training. The film premiered at the 2014 Toronto International Film Festival, received positive reviews from critics, and her performance received critical acclaim. Sudhish Kamath from &quot;The Hindu&quot; criticized the film&#x27;s screenplay but praised Chopra&#x27;s &quot;knockout&quot; performance, writing &quot;The spirited actress rises above the material and makes us invest in her and does full justice to the spirit&quot; of the boxer. The Indo-Asian News Service review noted the actress for expressing every shade of the character with &quot;a pitch-perfect bravado&quot;. &quot;Mary Kom&quot; emerged as a commercial success, with revenues of at the box office. She won the Screen Award for Best Actress, the Producers Guild Film Award for Best Actress in a Leading Role, and received another nomination for the Filmfare Award for Best Actress.

=== Expansion into American film and television (2015â2019) ===
In 2015, Chopra starred in Zoya Akhtar&#x27;s &quot;Dil Dhadakne Do&quot;, an ensemble comedy-drama, featuring Anil Kapoor, Shefali Shah, Ranveer Singh and Anushka Sharma. The film tells the story of a dysfunctional Punjabi family (the Mehras), who invite their family and friends on a cruise trip to celebrate the parents&#x27; 30th wedding anniversary. She portrayed the role of Ayesha Mehra, a successful entrepreneur and the eldest child. Pratim D. Gupta from &quot;The Telegraph&quot; wrote of Chopra, &quot;From the propah body language to the measured speech [...] shows the kind of depth she is able to bring to her lines and characters these days. Conversely, Shubhra Gupta of &quot;The Indian Express&quot; commented that it was time for her &quot;to being a little messy: all these not-a-hair-out-place roles are making her constrained.&quot; The cast of &quot;Dil Dhadakne Do&quot; won the Screen Award for Best Ensemble Cast, and Chopra was nominated for a Screen Award, IIFA Award, and Producers Guild Film Award for Best Actress. In 2016, she dubbed for Kaa, a female python, in the Hindi version of the film &quot;The Jungle Book&quot;.
Chopra signed a talent holding deal with ABC Studios and was later cast in the American thriller series &quot;Quantico&quot; as the character Alex Parrish. The series premiered in 2015 on ABC, making Chopra the first South Asian to headline an American network drama series. The series received positive reviews from television critics and Chopra was praised for her performance. Rob Lowman of the &quot;Los Angeles Daily News&quot; applauded her &quot;dynamic screen presence&quot; and James Poniewozik of &quot;The New York Times&quot; named Chopra as the &quot;strongest human asset&quot; of the show, and added that &quot;she is immediately charismatic and commanding.&quot; She received the People&#x27;s Choice Award for Favourite Actress In A New TV Series for her role in &quot;Quantico&quot;, becoming the first South Asian actress to win a People&#x27;s Choice Award. The following year, Chopra won a second People&#x27;s Choice Award for Favorite Dramatic TV Actress. &quot;Quantico&quot; was cancelled after three seasons in 2018. Chopra later said that her move to America was prompted by disagreements with people in Bollywood: &quot;I had people not casting me, I had beef with people, I am not good at playing that game so I kind of was tired of the politics and I said I needed a break.â

Chopra next portrayed Kashibai, the first wife of the Maratha general Peshwa Bajirao I, in Sanjay Leela Bhansali&#x27;s epic historical romantic drama &quot;Bajirao Mastani&quot;, alongside Ranveer Singh and Deepika Padukone. The feature opened to highly positive reviews, and Chopra received widespread praise for her portrayal which several reviewers regarded as her best performance to date. Rajeev Masand wrote &quot;the film benefits from a nice touch of playfulness and humor in Priyanka Chopra&#x27;s Kashibai. Chopra brings grace to the character, and practically steals the film.&quot; Film critic Raja Sen thought that Chopra, despite not being in the title role, owned the film, and wrote &quot;Chopra&#x27;s terrific in the part, her intelligently expressive eyes speaking volumes and her no-nonsense Marathi rhythm bang-on.&quot; A major commercial success, &quot;Bajirao Mastani&quot; grossed at the box office, becoming one of the highest-grossing Indian films of all time. For her performance, she won the Filmfare Award, IIFA Award, and Screen Award for Best Supporting Actress, and received a nomination for the Producers Guild Film Award for Best Actress in a Leading Role.

In 2016, Chopra starred as a police officer in Prakash Jha&#x27;s social drama &quot;Jai Gangaajal&quot;. Writing for &quot;The Hindu&quot;, Namrata Joshi thought that she &quot;looks off-colour, disinterested and uninvolved with the goings on through most of the film&quot;. It did not perform well commercially. The following year, Chopra made her Hollywood live-action film debut by playing the antagonist Victoria Leeds in Seth Gordon&#x27;s action comedy &quot;Baywatch&quot; opposite Dwayne Johnson and Zac Efron. The feature received unfavorable reviews. IGN declared Chopra as the highlight of the film, noting she &quot;outshines pretty much anyone she&#x27;s in a scene with&quot; and wrote &quot;Chopra&#x27;s engaging and interesting and is the only character that speaks with any kind of distinctive cadence.&quot; Scott Mendelson of &quot;Forbes&quot; wrote &quot;Chopra has fun as the baddie, but she stays in the background until the end of the movie and really only gets one big scene at the end of the picture.&quot; &quot;Baywatch&quot; was not a commercial success in North America but the film performed well in the overseas markets, grossing approximately $178 million at the worldwide box office. The 2018 Sundance Film Festival marked the release of Chopra&#x27;s next American film, &quot;A Kid Like Jake&quot;, a drama about gender variance, starring Jim Parsons and Claire Danes. Amy Nicholson of &quot;Variety&quot; commended her &quot;charming presence&quot; but thought that her role added little value to the film. In early 2019, she had signed on to play the leading lady opposite Salman Khan in &quot;Bharat&quot;, but opted out days before filming her scenes. Nikhil Namit, a producer of the film, said that she quit due to her engagement to Nick Jonas and accused her of being &quot;a little unprofessional&quot;.

In 2019, Chopra had another supporting part, as a yoga ambassador, in Todd Strauss-Schulson&#x27;s comedy &quot;Isn&#x27;t It Romantic&quot;, which starred Rebel Wilson. The film was well received by critics and grossed approximately $49 million at the North American box office. Dana Schwartz of &quot;Entertainment Weekly&quot; considered her to be &quot;perfectly cast&quot; but Benjamin Lee of &quot;The Guardian&quot; thought that she was &quot;not quite interesting enough&quot;. She returned to Hindi cinema (as Priyanka Chopra Jonas) later in 2019 with Shonali Bose&#x27;s biographical drama &quot;The Sky Is Pink&quot;, in which she played mother to Aisha Chaudhary, a teenager suffering from a terminal illness. She also produced the project, and connected with the story for its blend of humour and tragedy. Kate Erbland of IndieWire found her to be &quot;extraordinary&quot; as &quot;the film&#x27;s driving force, a tough-talking mama bear&quot;, and Anna M. M. Vetticad took note of the &quot;simmering restraint&quot; in her performance. The film did not do well at the box office. She received another nomination for the Filmfare Award for Best Actress.

=== Streaming projects (2020âpresent) ===
In 2020, Chopra Jonas signed a multimillion-dollar first-look TV deal with Amazon Prime Video to back content by first time BIPOC and female filmmakers. Her only release that year was the Netflix children&#x27;s superhero film &quot;We Can Be Heroes&quot; directed by Robert Rodriguez. She starred as Ms. Granada, the director of a superhero organisation called Heroics. The feature received generally positive reviews; Richard Roeper from the &quot;Chicago Sun-Times&quot; praised the actress for &quot;livening up the proceedings&quot; as the strait-laced Ms. Granada, and Ian Freer of the &quot;Empire&quot; magazine felt that she did the &quot;kids&#x27; film acting to the hilt&quot;. Her first film of 2021 was Ramin Bahrani&#x27;s &quot;The White Tiger&quot;, an adaptation of Aravind Adiga&#x27;s satirical novel of the same name. She starred alongside Adarsh Gourav and Rajkummar Rao, and also executive produced this Netflix production. Critical reviews towards the film and her performance were positive. Writing for &quot;The Times&quot;, film critic Kevin Maher deemed Chopra Jonas&#x27; performance &quot;impressive&quot; and &quot;The Hollywood Reporter&quot;â³s David Rooney commended her for bringing &quot;emotional depth&quot; to her role. The film received a Best Adapted Screenplay nomination at the 93rd Academy Awards. Later that year, Chopra Jonas had a supporting role in the science fiction film &quot;The Matrix Resurrections&quot;.

Chopra Jonas next starred alongside Richard Madden in Amazon Prime Video&#x27;s action thriller series &quot;Citadel&quot; (2023). With a production budget of US$300 million, the six-episode first season ranks as one of the most-expensive television shows. It marked the first time in her career when she received equal pay with her male co-star. She performed many of her own stunts, and suffered a permanent scar from an injury on her eyebrow. Critics had mixed opinions on the series, but Jasper Rees of &quot;The Daily Telegraph&quot; was particularly impressed by Chopra Jonas&#x27; potential as a female James Bond, finding her &quot;flirty and funny and hard as a bag of nine-inch nails&quot;. She then led the romantic comedy &quot;Love Again&quot;, opposite Sam Heughan and Celine Dion, which was panned by critics.

Chopra Jonas will next star alongside John Cena and Idris Elba in the action film &quot;Heads of State&quot; and alongside Karl Urban in the action film &quot;The Bluff&quot;.

== Music career ==
Chopra&#x27;s main vocal influence was her father, who helped develop her interest in singing. She used her vocal talent early in her pageantry career. Her first recording, the song &quot;Ullathai Killathe&quot; in the Tamil film &quot;Thamizhan&quot; (2002), was made at the urging of her director and co-star, Vijay (who had noticed her singing on the set). She declined to sing playback for &quot;Tinka Tinka&quot; in her film &quot;Karam&quot; (2005), preferring to concentrate on her acting career, but later sang the song live on the television programme &quot;Sa Re Ga Ma Pa&quot;. Chopra recorded an unreleased song for &quot;Bluffmaster!&quot; (2005). In August 2011, Universal Music Group signed Chopra to a worldwide recording agreement with DesiHits. The deal indicated that her first studio album would be released by Interscope Records in North America and by Island Records elsewhere.
In July 2012, Chopra became the first Bollywood star signed by Creative Artists Agency, an entertainment and sports agency based in Los Angeles. The album was produced by RedOne. Her first single, &quot;In My City&quot;, debuted in the US on 13 September 2012 in a TV spot for the NFL Network&#x27;s Thursday Night Football; a shortened version of the song was used to open each show of the season. &quot;In My City&quot; features rapper will.i.am; according to Chopra, a co-writer, the song was inspired by her unsettled childhood and her journey from a small-town girl to a celebrity. The song received mixed reviews from critics, and was a commercial success in India; it sold more than 130,000Â copies in its first week, topped the Hindi pop chart and was certified triple platinum. In the United States the single was unsuccessful, with 5,000Â digital downloads in its first week according to Nielsen SoundScan, and did not receive radio play.

The single also entered at number 74 on the Canadian Hot 100 chart. &quot;Exotic&quot; debuted at number 44 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot Dance Club Songs chart and peaked at number 12. Her third single, a cover of Bonnie Raitt&#x27;s &quot;I Can&#x27;t Make You Love Me&quot; was released in April 2014. The song peaked at number 28 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot Dance/Electronic Songs chart.

Chopra&#x27;s first song as a playback singer in Bollywood was &quot;Chaoro&quot;, a lullaby from &quot;Mary Kom&quot; (2014). In 2015, she sang the title song, a duet with Farhan Akhtar, for &quot;Dil Dhadakne Do&quot;.

In 2017, Chopra collaborated with the Australian DJ Will Sparks for &quot;Young and Free&quot;, an EDM song which she also wrote. Chopra later said that her music career &quot;was not living up to my standards&quot; and that it would have been &quot;futile&quot; to have kept pursuing it.

== Philanthropy ==
Chopra supports various causes through her foundation &quot;The Priyanka Chopra Foundation for Health and Education&quot;, which works towards providing support to unprivileged children across the country in the areas of Education and Health. She donates ten percent of her earnings to fund the foundation&#x27;s operations, and pays for educational and medical expenses for seventy children in India, fifty among whom are girls. She often speaks out on women&#x27;s issues: against female infanticide and foeticide, and in support of education for girls. A believer in feminism, Chopra has always been vocal about women&#x27;s rights, gender equality, and gender pay gap. In 2006, a &quot;day with Chopra&quot; was auctioned on eBay; the proceeds were donated to an NGO, Nanhi Kali, which helps educate girls in India. She has made appearances in support of other charities, such as the 2005 HELP! Telethon Concert to raise funds for the victims of the 2004 Indian Ocean earthquake.

She has worked with UNICEF since 2006, recording public-service announcements and participating in media panel discussions promoting children&#x27;s rights and the education of girls, and also participated in celebrating the 20th anniversary of the Convention on the Rights of the Child. She was appointed as the national UNICEF Goodwill Ambassador for Child Rights on 10 August 2010. UNICEF Representative Karin Hulshof said of the appointment: &quot;She is equally passionate about her work on behalf of children and adolescents. We are proud of the work she has done with us so far on child rights, and, we are thrilled about all what we will be doing together so that no child gets left behind.&quot; In 2009, she shot a documentary for the organisation Alert India to increase understanding of leprosy. She modelled for designer Manish Malhotra and Shaina NC&#x27;s charity fashion show to raise funds for the Cancer Patients Aid Association NGO. In 2010 Chopra was one of several celebrities who created promotional messages for Pearls Wave Trust, which campaigns against violence and abuse of women and girls. Chopra also launched the &quot;Save the Girl Child&quot; campaign, which aims to change the attitudes of Indians towards girls. In 2012 Chopra spoke at the launch of Awakening Youth, an anti-addiction programme.

At a public event in 2019, an activist criticised Chopra for a tweet in which she hailed India&#x27;s military forces while tensions amid Pakistan and India were escalating. The main line of argument was that she was warmongering and that was incompatible with her job as UN Peace Ambassador. Chopra&#x27;s response at the event was that she is patriotic; she was also fast to silence the activist criticising her. Pakistan asked for Chopra being sacked from her UN job but UN supported Chopra&#x27;s right to talk for herself.
Chopra is a supporter of environmental charities and is brand ambassador for NDTV Greenathon, an initiative to support eco-friendliness and provide solar power to rural villages without electricity supplies. She appeared with children in an animated video to support the cause, and removed rubbish from the banks of the Yamuna river in Agra to increase awareness of environmental issues. During the third and fourth editions of Greenathon, She adopted up to seven villages to provide with a regular supply of electricity. She adopted a tigress in 2011 and a lioness in 2012 at the Birsa biological park, paying for both animals upkeep for a year. To promote organ donation, Chopra pledged to donate her own organs after death and was co-keynote speaker at the University of Pittsburgh Medical Center&#x27;s Bollywood-themed 20th-anniversary celebration of its liver-transplant programme in 2012.

Chopra also lent her voice to a music video of John Lennon&#x27;s &quot;Imagine&quot;. The video featuring her along with other singers, including Katy Perry, and The Black Eyed Peas was created as part of a global campaign by UNICEF to celebrate the 25th anniversary of the Convention on the Rights of the Child.

Indian prime minister Narendra Modi selected Chopra as one of his nine nominees called &quot;Navratna&quot; in 2014 for the Swachh Bharat Abhiyan, a national cleanliness campaign by the Government of India. She lent her support to the campaign by working as a sanitation worker for a day, cleaning and rehabilitating a garbage-laden neighbourhood in Mumbai, and urged people to maintain the cleanliness.

In 2015, she voiced People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals (PETA&#x27;s) life-size robotic elephant named &quot;Ellie&quot;, who visited schools across the United States and Europe to educate kids about elephants and captivity, and to urge people to boycott circuses. Chopra was appointed as the global UNICEF Goodwill Ambassador in December 2016. In 2017, &quot;Variety&quot; honoured her with the Power of Women award for her philanthropic work with UNICEF and she received the Mother Teresa Memorial Award for Social Justice for her contribution towards social causes. Two years later, Chopra was awarded the Danny Kaye Humanitarian Award by UNICEF for her &quot;philanthropic work and dedication towards the welfare of the society&quot; at the UNICEF Snowflake Ball 2019.

In December 2019, Chopra teamed-up with the United Nations Children&#x27;s Fund and the Crocs Company to donate 50,000 pairs of shoes to deserving school children in the Central American country, Belize.

In late April 2021, due to the COVID-19 pandemic in India, Chopra along with husband Nick opened a fundraiser along with NGO GiveIndia to get donations for oxygen supply, COVID-19 care centers, testing, and vaccination efforts. The fundraiser had achieved USD 400,000 in the first few days. Chopra&#x27;s brother-in-law Kevin Jonas also urged his followers to help donate to the fundraiser. By 13 May 2021, the fundraiser had achieved the $1 million landmark and put its newer target at $3 million for COVID-19 relief.

== Other works ==
=== Film production and entrepreneurship ===
Chopra set up her production company Purple Pebble Pictures with an aim to produce small budget films and introduce and promote new talent in the Indian film industry, particularly regional Indian films. Her first Marathi film, the 2016 comedy-drama &quot;Ventilator&quot;, was a box office success and went on to win three awards at the 64th National Film Awards. She went on to produce several Indian regional language films, including &quot;&quot; (2018) and &quot;Paani&quot; (2019), which won the National Film Award for Best Film on Environment Conservation/Preservation at the 66th National Film Awards. In 2025, she attached herself as an executive producer on the short film &quot;Anuja&quot;.

Chopra started investing in tech companies in 2018 by investing in a coding education startup called Holberton School and the dating and social media app Bumble. The Bumble app was launched in India with the help of Chopra in October 2018. In 2021, it was reported that she had invested in the US-based rental marketplace Apartment List. At the Startup India Prarambh event 2021, Chopra said that &quot;ideas are the currency of the present&quot; and that she was looking forward to further invest in a mix of beauty and tech startups. The same month, she launched a haircare line called &quot;Anamoly Haircare&quot; which became available exclusively in Target stores in the United States on 1 February 2021 and was planned to be available internationally later that year. In March 2021, Chopra opened her new restaurant &quot;Sona&quot; in Manhattan, featuring haute-couture Indian cuisine.

=== Television presenting and stage performances ===

In 2007, Chopra was on the judges&#x27; panel of the Miss India pageant. She stated, &quot;Miss India will always remain special. That&#x27;s where it all started for me. And maybe that&#x27;s where it would&#x27;ve ended if I hadn&#x27;t won the crown.&quot; She also served as a judge at Miss World 2009. She visited Jawan troops in Tenga, in eastern India, for a special episode of the NDTV show &quot;Jai Jawan&quot; celebrating the 60th anniversary of India&#x27;s independence.

In 2010, she hosted the third season of the reality show &quot;Fear Factor: Khatron Ke Khiladi&quot; on the Colors channel, taking over from previous host Akshay Kumar. According to contestants, in hosting the series, Chopra had &quot;transformed into quite a whip-wielding dictator&quot;, relentlessly pushing the contestants to work. She performed most of her own stunts, adamant to prove that she could rival Akshay Kumar, who had hosted the previous two seasons. The opening ratings of the show topped those of the two previous seasons. The show was praised by critics, and earned her the Indian Telly Award for Most Impactful Debut on Television. In February 2016, Chopra presented the award for Best Film Editing at the 88th Academy Awards.

Chopra has participated in a number of world tours and concerts. She took part in a world concert tour, &quot;Temptations 2004&quot;, and performed with other Bollywood actors (including Shah Rukh Khan, Saif Ali Khan, Rani Mukerji, Preity Zinta and Arjun Rampal) in 19 stage shows.

In 2021, Chopra along with her husband Nick Jonas, announced the nominees for the 93rd Academy Awards.

=== Writing ===
Chopra began writing an opinion column for the &quot;Hindustan Times&quot; in 2009. She wrote a total of 50 columns for the newspaper. She said after her first year of writing: &quot;I&#x27;m a private person and never thought that I could express my feelings. But strangely enough, whenever I sat down to write this column, my inner most thoughts came to the fore.&quot; In March 2009, she met several readers who had submitted feedback on her weekly column. She continued to write sporadically for newspapers. In August 2012 she wrote a column published in &quot;The Times of India&quot; titled &quot;No woman in Mumbai feels safe any longer&quot;, discussing the murder of 25-year-old Pallavi Purkayastha, whom she met while working on &quot;Don&quot;. In the article, Chopra expressed her views about the safety of women in cities. In a July 2014 article published in &quot;The Guardian&quot;, Chopra criticised female genital mutilation and child marriage.

Later that year, Chopra wrote an op-ed for &quot;The New York Times&quot; titled &quot;What Jane Austen Knew&quot; about the importance of education for girls. She praised and quoted Nobel Peace Prize winners Malala Yousafzai and Kailash Satyarthi, and described how her desire to help others was triggered when, at 9, she joined her parents while they volunteered their spare time to offer modern health care to the rural poor. In late 2014, Chopra began writing a monthly column, &quot;Pret-a-Priyanka&quot;, for &quot;Elle&quot;. In an article published in January 2015, she expressed her views on diversity and being a global citizen. Released by Penguin Random House, Chopra published her first memoir titled &quot;Unfinished&quot; on 9 February 2021. In a rave review, Associated Press&#x27;s Molly Sprayregen termed the book &quot;deeply open and honest account&quot; and wrote &quot;Chopra Jonas&#x27; writing is open, engaging, and full of energy. She writes, it seems, to connect. The experience feels intimate, like Chopra Jonas is exchanging stories with a friend over coffee. Her stories are exceedingly personal, and despite being an international movie star, many of them even feel relatable.&quot; &quot;Unfinished&quot; reached &quot;The New York Times&quot; Best Seller list in the United States.

== Personal life ==

Chopra has maintained a strong relationship with her family, including her younger brother, Siddharth, and lives in an apartment on the same floor as her family. She was especially close to her father, who died in June 2013; in 2012, she got a tattoo reading &quot;Daddy&#x27;s lil girl&quot; in his handwriting. Having not come from a film background, she describes herself as a self-made woman. Her mother, a well-established gynaecologist in Bareilly, gave up her practice to support Chopra as she embarked upon a film career.

A practising Hindu, Chopra performs a puja every morning at a small shrine consisting of various murtis of Hindu deities in her home, which she even travels with. Although she is known for her media-friendly attitude, Chopra is publicly reticent about her personal life. Chopra started dating American singer and actor, Nick Jonas in May 2018. Jonas proposed to her on 19 July 2018, a day after her birthday in Crete, Greece. Chopra and Jonas became engaged in August 2018 in a Punjabi Roka ceremony in Mumbai. In December 2018, the couple married at Umaid Bhawan Palace, Jodhpur in traditional Hindu and Christian ceremonies. Following the marriage, Chopra legally changed her full name to &quot;Priyanka Chopra Jonas&quot;. In January 2022, the couple had a girl child named Malti Marie Chopra Jonas, via surrogacy.

Remarking upon her role choices, CNN-IBN described Chopra as a powerful modern actress unafraid of experimenting with roles. Analysing Chopra&#x27;s career, Bollywood Hungama noted her constant growth as a performer despite career fluctuations. &quot;The Times of India&quot; called her a &quot;game changer&quot; for changing &quot;the age-old demarcation between a hero and heroine&quot;. In 2012, film critic Subhash K. Jha labelled her &quot;the best actress in the post-Sridevi generation&quot; and listed her character in &quot;Barfi!&quot; as being &quot;one of the finest inwardly ravaged characters in Bollywood.&quot; Chopra has often featured on Rediff.com&#x27;s annual listing of &quot;Bollywood&#x27;s Best Actresses&quot;, ranking first in 2009, and was featured in their list of &quot;Top 10 Actresses of 2000â2010&quot;.

She ranks highly on various beauty listings in the world. The UK magazine &quot;Eastern Eye&quot; ranked her first on their list of &quot;World&#x27;s Sexiest Asian Women&quot; for a record five times (2006, 2012, 2014, 2015 and 2017). Chopra also topped the &quot;Maxim India&quot;â³s Hot 100 list in 2011, 2013, 2016 and 2018. In 2017, Buzznet named her the world&#x27;s second most beautiful woman after BeyoncÃ©. Chopra was named one of &quot;People&quot; magazine&#x27;s Most Beautiful Women in the World in 2017 and 2019.

She has featured in the Indian edition of &quot;Celebrity 100&quot; every year since its inception in 2012, ranking under top fifteen each year except 2018. Chopra ranked as the highest earning Indian female celebrity in 2016 and 2017 with respective earnings of and , peaking at the seventh position in 2017.

<text>The alula , or bastard wing, (plural &quot;alulae&quot;) is a small projection on the anterior edge of the wing of modern birds and a few non-avian dinosaurs. The word is Latin and means &quot;winglet&quot;; it is the diminutive of &quot;ala&quot;, meaning &quot;wing&quot;. The alula is the freely moving first digit, a bird&#x27;s &quot;thumb&quot;, and typically bears three to five small flight feathers, with the exact number depending on the species. There also are minor covert feathers overlying the flight feathers. Like the larger flight feathers found on the wing&#x27;s trailing edge, these alula feathers are asymmetrical, with the shaft running closer to anterior edge.

==Function==

In most situations, the alula is held flush against the wing; however, it can be manipulated. When flying at slow speeds or landing, the bird moves its alula slightly upwards and forward, which creates a small slot on the wing&#x27;s leading edge. This functions in the same way as the slats on the leading edge of the wing of an aircraft, allowing the wing to achieve a higher than normal angle of attack â and thus lift â without resulting in a stall. The tip of the alula forms a tiny vortex, acting similar to a vortex generator, that forces the airflow over the wing to better bind to it. During stretching of the wing down toward the ground, the alula is abducted from the wing and can be clearly viewed.

In falcons, the alula is more prominent, and provides a degree of control when the wing is cupped or tucked in a dive/stoop. The alulae are particularly notable in peregrine falcons.

==In ancient birds==
The presence of an alula has been confirmed in several now-extinct ancient relatives of modern birds, including &quot;Eoalulavis hoyasi&quot; (an enantiornithine from the mid-Cretaceous, 115 mya) and the earlier &quot;Protopteryx fengningensis&quot;. Since these species are not closely related to modern birds, either the alula evolved twice, or it did so more than 130 million years ago.

==Biography==
Chopra was born on 22 April 1914 in Rahon, Shaheed Bhagat Singh Nagar district (formerly Nawanshahr district) to Vilayati Raj Chopra, an employee of the PWD. He later shifted to Lahore. He was the second of several siblings; his youngest brother was filmmaker Yash Chopra.

Chopra received an M.A. in English literature from University of the Punjab in Lahore. He started his career in 1944 as a film journalist with &quot;Cine Herald&quot;, a film-monthly published in Lahore, he later took over the magazine and ran it until 1947. In the same year, he launched a film with a story by I. S. Johar, &quot;Chandni Chowk&quot;. Naeem Hashmi was hero of this movie and Erika Rukhshi was the heroine. Just as the production of film was to start, riots broke out in Lahore and he and his family had to flee from the city. After the partition of India into India and Pakistan in 1947, he moved to Delhi. He later moved to Mumbai, where his first production, &quot;Karwat&quot;, began in 1948, though it turned out to be a flop. His first film as a director, &quot;Afsana&quot;, was released in 1951 and featured Ashok Kumar in a double roleÂ â the film was a hit and established his name in Bollywood. Chopra made &quot;Chandni Chowk&quot;, with Meena Kumari as a lead, in 1954. In 1955, Chopra formed his own production house, &quot;B.R Films&quot;. His first movie for this production house was &quot;Ek Hi Raasta&quot; (1956) which was highly successful. He followed it up with &quot;Naya Daur&quot; (1957) starring Dilip Kumar and Vyjayantimala Bali, the film became a golden jubilee hit. His subsequent releases like &quot;Kanoon&quot;, &quot;Gumrah&quot;, &quot;Hamraaz&quot; were major hits in the sixties. In 1963, he was a member of the jury at the 13th Berlin International Film Festival. His second film with actor Dilip Kumar was &quot;Dastaan&quot; which became a flop in 1972.

He directed successful film across genres after 1972, with films like suspense thriller &quot;Dhund&quot; (1973), drama &quot;Karm&quot; (1977), comedy film &quot;Pati Patni Aur Woh&quot; (1978), crime film in (1980), Muslim social in &quot;Nikaah&quot; (1982) and the political thriller &quot;Awam&quot; (1987).

He was the producer for the films &quot;Dhool Ka Phool&quot; (1959), &quot;Waqt&quot; (1965), &quot;Aadmi Aur Insaan&quot; (1969) and &quot;Ittefaq&quot; (1969) directed by his younger brother Yash Chopra, and he also produced &quot;The Burning Train&quot; (1980), &quot;Mazdoor&quot; (1983), (1984), (2003), &quot;Baabul&quot; (2006), &quot;Bhoothnath&quot; (2008) which were directed by Ravi Chopra.

Chopra forayed into television with &quot;Mahabharat&quot;, whose become the most successful TV serials with 92% viewers record in Indian television history, where Nitish Bharadwaj played the role of Krishna and Mukesh khanna portrayed the role of Bhism pitamah and this was co-directed by him with his son. He also produced TV Series on &quot;Bahadur Shah Zafar&quot;, &quot;Kanoon&quot;, &quot;Vishnu Puran&quot;, &quot;Aap Beeti&quot; and &quot;Maa Shakti&quot;.

He died in Mumbai at the age of 94 on 5 November 2008, survived by his son, Ravi Chopra, and two daughters Shashi and Bina.

<doc id="838965" wikidata="Q7062364" url="?curid=838965" title="Notable American Women">
<text>Notable American Women is a novel written by Ben Marcus and published in March 2002.

==Plot introduction==
The novel, written as a follow-up to Marcus&#x27;s literary debut, &quot;The Age of Wire and String&quot;, deals with an abstruse Ohio family, which shares the author&#x27;s surname. The Marcus family, owning four members, lives on a farm outside of an unnamed town; the reader encounters narration from three of those members, and is led through a seemingly implausible and temporally confusing description of the life events of the protagonist: a young Ben Marcus.

==Plot summary==

Michael Marcus (the father of Ben Marcus, the character) opens &quot;Notable American Women&quot; with several warningsÂ â most notably, that his own offspring, Ben, may very well be mentally handicappedÂ â and ponders reflectively, &quot;How can one word from Ben Marcus&#x27;s rotten, filthy heart be trusted?&quot;

With that, Ben Marcus (the author) launches into a lengthy first-person narration with Ben Marcus as guide, allowing the reader to decide if, and how, any of the words can be trusted. Playing with the English language in such a manner that his work has drawn comparison&#x27;s to Anthony Burgess&#x27;s &quot;A Clockwork Orange&quot;, among other novels, Marcus describes the cultish, recondite practises of his mother, her enigmatic mentor Jane Dark, and their legion of disciples as they attempt to create perfect stillness in the world by eliminating the &quot;wind violence&quot; of speech and, ultimately, physical movement. Dark, witty, and depressing in its ironic hilarity, &quot;Notable American Women&quot; allows the reader to delve into the mind of a well-meaning but obtuse young man, to glimpse into his turbulent upbringing full of radical experimentation and forced-breeding (among other things) and, possibly, to become attached.

In the end, the feminist Silentist group, to which Ben&#x27;s mother Jane Marcus belongs, is facing issues of endangerment due to the largely unsuccessful breeding procedures involving Ben and the growing number of its member that are reaching a stillness level, which makes them obsolete. Jane Marcus, too, is nearing complete and utter emotional obliteration, using a complex system of body contortions, and takes the opportunity to address the reader. Like her estranged husband before her (whom she purportedly assisted in relegating to a hole in her backyard), Jane takes a turn at narration, providing for the novel&#x27;s conclusion; addressing her husband with ultimatums and effrontery, the reader sees life from the last member of the core Marcus-family trinity, at which point the reader is left to draw her or his own conclusions.

==Literary significance and criticism==
Widely applauded not just for his imaginative story but his ingenious wordplay, Ben Marcus&#x27;s first novel received acclaim despite little mainstream attention. Since producing Notable American Women, Marcus has authored &quot;The Father Costume&quot;, a collaborative work with painter/illustrator Matthew Ritchie, and edited &quot;The Anchor Book of New American Short Stories&quot;.

==Autobiographical content==
When asked about his sharing a name with the main character and if the book was supposed to be autobiographical, Marcus responded &quot;My family was very loving and I&#x27;ve never been to Ohio.&quot;

<doc id="838973" wikidata="Q1320911" url="?curid=838973" title="ICC Intercontinental Cup">
<text>The ICC Intercontinental Cup was a first-class cricket tournament organised by the International Cricket Council (ICC) as part of its cricket development programme. It was designed to allow Associate Members of the ICC the chance to play first-class cricket matches over four days against teams of similar skill in a competition environment and prepare them for eventual promotion to Test cricket status. First run in 2004, two of the most successful teams in the history of the tournament, Ireland and Afghanistan were promoted to Full Member and Test status, in 2017.

In October 2018, the ICC issued a media release asking for an expression of interest from teams who have competed in previous editions of the tournament. However, since no further news regarding a new edition have emerged since then, the future of the tournament was put into doubt. In April 2021, the ICC looked at the possibility of multi-day matches between Associate Members with One Day International (ODI) status, and Test teams who are not part of the ICC World Test Championship.

==Tournament history==

===2004 ICC Intercontinental Cup===

The inaugural ICC Intercontinental Cup was completed on 22 November 2004 when Scotland won the title in Sharjah, United Arab Emirates. Scotland beat Canada by an innings and 84 runs in the final. The competition included 12 teams, divided by geographical region into four groups of three. Each team played the other two teams in its group once each. The top team in each group then progresses to the semi-finals, and the winners of those to the final. In order to encourage competitive play and avoid deadlocks, a point system including bonus points was used.

===2005 ICC Intercontinental Cup===
Hong Kong came in to replace Malaysia, and the Cayman Islands replaced the United States who were ejected from the competition by the ICC because of then ongoing political problems within cricket in the US. The points system was also modified so that teams could score unlimited batting points in the first innings and a maximum of 4 points in the second innings.

The tournament was won by Ireland who defeated Kenya in the final.

===2006â2007 ICC Intercontinental Cup===
The tournament was cut from 12 to eight teams, with Hong Kong, the Cayman Islands and Uganda losing the right to participate, while Namibia knocked out Nepal in a play off for the eighth place. The match length was extended from three to four days, and each team was scheduled to play at least three matches. The teams were divided into two groups of four, with each team playing the other once and the top two teams qualifying for the final, and the points system has also been changed: 14 points are now awarded for a win, and six for a first-innings lead. Due to preparations for the 2007 World Cup and the longer tournament, the final was played in May 2007, where Ireland defeated Canada to defend their title.

===2007â2008 ICC Intercontinental Cup===
The 2007â08 tournament was played as a single round-robin league of eight teams, so that each team played seven matches. The teams ranked first and second at the end of the pool stage contested the final.

Namibia topped the pool stage but faced a defeat in the final against Ireland in late October in Port Elizabeth, South Africa. Ireland secured their third consecutive Intercontinental Cup victory by remaining unbeaten throughout the competition. They sealed the title by winning three successive crucial away matches in Africa, defeating Namibia twice and Kenya in between.

===2009â10 ICC Intercontinental Cup===
The 2009â10 tournament was expanded to two divisions and 11 teams. Ireland, the Netherlands, Scotland, Canada, Kenya, and Afghanistan played in the top division, joined by Zimbabwe A. Meanwhile, United Arab Emirates, Namibia, Bermuda and Uganda played in the Intercontinental Shield.
Afghanistan won their first title, beating Scotland in the final.

===2011â13 ICC Intercontinental Cup===
In December 2010, the ICC announced that the 2011â13 tournament would revert to the 8 team, single division format of the 2007â08 season and that the Intercontinental Shield would be scrapped. The sixth staging of the Cup ran from June 2011 to October 2013. and included the top six associate and affiliate teams with One Day International status (ICC World Cricket League Division 1); Afghanistan, Canada, Ireland, Kenya, Netherlands and Scotland. The remaining two places were allotted to UAE and Namibia who finished in the top two of the ICC Intercontinental Shield and ICC World Cricket League Division 2. Later the ICC Development Committee decided to select the 3rd and 4th placed teams from the ICC World Cricket League Division 2 (Bermuda and Uganda) and two qualifiers to proceed from WCL Division 3 (Hong Kong and Papua New Guinea) bringing the total to 12 teams. A 50-over tournament was run alongside the re-expanded Intercontinental Cup.

The final of the 2011-13 competition was held in December 2013 between Ireland and Afghanistan, with Ireland winning their 4th Intercontinental Cup title.

===2015â17 ICC Intercontinental Cup===
In the wake of changes announced by ICC following its revamp in January 2014 when India, Australia and England Cricket Boards gained more control it was declared that the next winner of the Intercontinental Cup would get an opportunity to play 4 tests (2 home and 2 away) against the bottom ranked test nation and if the associate nation wins that series they would then gain Test status until the next Intercontinental Cup. However, with Ireland and Afghanistan gaining test status in June 2017 the Test challenge was not held. Ireland, Afghanistan, Scotland, United Arab Emirates, Hong Kong, PNG, The Netherlands and Namibia qualified based on the results from 2011â13 ICC World Cricket League Championship, 2014 Cricket World Cup Qualifier and the 2015 ICC World Cricket League Division Two. It ran in parallel with the 2015â17 ICC World Cricket League Championship but with slightly different teams. As Ireland and Afghanistan had qualified for the ICC One-Day International Championship ranking qualification process, they were replaced by Kenya and Nepal in the limited over event; however they continued to play the four-day event. Afghanistan won the tournament after defeating UAE during the final round.

<doc id="838975" wikidata="Q7043346" url="?curid=838975" title="No. 2 Squadron RAF">
<text>Number 2 Squadron, also known as No. II (Army Co-operation) Squadron, is the most senior squadron of the Royal Air Force. It is currently equipped with the Eurofighter Typhoon FGR4 at RAF Lossiemouth, Moray, since reforming there on 12 January 2015.

No. 2 Squadron&#x27;s traditional army co-operation role is reflected in the &quot;AC&quot; of its title, its motto &#x27;Hereward â Guardian of the Army&#x27;, and the symbol of a wake knot on its crest. Its unofficial nickname is &quot;Shiny Two&quot;.

==History==

===Early years and First World War (1912â1918)===

No. 2 Squadron was formed at Farnborough, Hampshire on , on the founding of the Royal Flying Corps as one of the first three squadrons of the new force. It was formed from a detachment of No. 2 (Aeroplane) Company of the Royal Engineers Air Battalion. Both No. 2 Squadron and No. 3 Squadron were equipped with fixed wing aeroplanes, while No. 1 Squadron was equipped with airships. The Squadron&#x27;s first commander was Major C J Burke. The Squadron was equipped with a mixture of aircraft types, including the prototype Royal Aircraft Factory B.E.2.

From 26 February 1913, the squadron was based at Montrose Air Station in Angus, Scotland, the first operational Royal Flying Corps base in the UK. This was established on the instructions of the First Lord of the Admiralty, Winston Churchill, to protect the Royal Navy. At Montrose the ghost story of Desmond Arthur spread around the flying corps. In May 1914, when the Squadron was transferring south from Montrose, five aircraft crashed when they hit a bank of fog just south of the River Tees. Six of the aircraft had to land, with five of them crash landing, resulting in many injuries and two deaths (a Lieutenant and a First Class Mechanic) in a field near Hutton Bonville in the North Riding of Yorkshire.

No. 2 Squadron was the first to fly the English Channel into France at the start of the First World War with H.D. Harvey-Kelly being the first pilot to land his aircraft. The squadron spent the war on reconnaissance duties in France flying, amongst other aircraft, the B.E.2.

Although its principal role was not air-to-air combat, it still had one flying ace among its ranks in Arthur William Hammond. It also numbered the first aviation Victoria Cross winners in its ranks, in Second Lieutenant Rhodes-Moorhouse and Lieutenant Alan Arnett McLeod.

=== Interwar period (1919â1938) ===
The squadron gained the &#x27;AC&#x27; in its title in the inter-war years, flying army co-operation (AC) sorties during the partition of Ireland in the early 1920s. After time in China during 1927, the squadron re-equipped with the Armstrong Whitworth Atlas again on army co-operation work.

===Second World War (1939â1945)===
At the outbreak of the Second World War the unit was flying Westland Lysanders. In France until the Dunkirk evacuation. It was then based at RAF Sawbridgeworth in Hertfordshire as the principal squadron in that location. Over time the squadron equipped with fighters â the Curtiss Tomahawk in 1941, the North American Mustang in 1942. In July 1944, assigned to the 2nd Tactical Air Force, the squadron returned to France in the reconnaissance role. It was re-equipped with Supermarine Spitfire Mk.XIVs in November 1944. &quot;Shiny Two&quot; relocated to RAF Celle in June 1945 after the war in Europe was won as part of the British Air Forces of Occupation.

===Cold War (1946â1988)===

The squadron spent much of the Cold War in West Germany as part of RAF Germany, flying various fighter types, including the Supermarine Swift FR.5 and Hawker Hunter FR.10. No. II (AC) Squadron began to convert to the McDonnell Douglas Phantom FGR.2 in December 1970, when they received &quot;XV485&quot; at RAF BrÃ¼ggen. The Hunter No. II (AC) Squadron at RAF GÃ¼tersloh continued to operate in tandem with the Phantom No. II Squadron at BrÃ¼ggen until 1 March 1971 when conversion to the Phantom was completed. &quot;Shiny Two&quot; flew their first Phantom reconnaissance sortie on 8 January with &quot;XV485&quot;. The Phantom-equipped No. II (AC) Squadron relocated to RAF Laarbruch on 3 May 1971. &quot;Shiny Two&quot; began to convert to the SEPECAT Jaguar GR1 in 1976, with &quot;XZ101&quot; being delivered on 26 February 1976, with the Phantom FGR.2s being replaced by October the same year.

===Tornado era (1988â2015)===
No. II (AC) Squadron began to convert to the Panavia Tornado GR1 on 16 December 1988, when their first Tornados were delivered to RAF Laarbruch. Elements of the squadron were deployed to the 1991 Gulf War. Along with much of the RAF, No. 2 Squadron withdrew from Germany after returning from the Gulf War â moving to RAF Marham in Norfolk flying the Panavia Tornado GR1A coming under the control of RAF Strike Command. These were upgraded to the latest GR4 standard, with which the Squadron deployed at part of Operation Telic in Iraq during 2003. For this operation the squadron received a battle honour with the right of emblazonment on the Squadron Standard.

In September 2012, a memorial dedicated to all those who served on No. 2 Squadron and to those that gave their lives whilst serving on the squadron was unveiled at the National Memorial Arboretum in Staffordshire. The design, planning and fund-raising for the memorial took three years and it features a Roman numeral &#x27;II&#x27; carved from black granite. A service was held at the memorial which involved a flypast by a Supermarine Spitfire of the Battle of Britain Memorial Flight and No. 2 Squadron Tornado GR4. The service was attended by Air Chief Marshal Lord Jock Stirrup and The Venerable (Air Vice-Marshal) Ray Pentland, RAF Chaplain in Chief.

The squadron has deployed on several occasions to maintain the Tornado GR4 detachment in Afghanistan. It also saw action over Libya during Operation Ellamy/Operation Unified Protector for which it received a further battle honour. The Squadron also operated eight aircraft from RAF Akrotiri in Cyprus as part of Operation Shader, the coalition strikes against the extremist group ISIS.

In August 2014, the squadron deployed three Tornados equipped with the RAPTOR reconnaissance pod and the Litening III targeting pod to N&#x27;Djamena in Chad for Operation Turus, to take part in the search for Nigerian schoolgirls kidnapped by Boko Haram.

===Eurofighter Typhoon (2015âpresent)===
In December 2013, it was announced that following the squadron&#x27;s scheduled 2014 deployment to Afghanistan as part of Operation Herrick, it was to stand down on 31 March 2015 as a Tornado squadron at Marham, and reactivate the following day (1 April 2015) as a Eurofighter Typhoon squadron at RAF Lossiemouth in Scotland. However, in October 2014, Prime Minister David Cameron said that the squadron&#x27;s disbandment and reformation would be put on hold to allow Tornados to continue supporting strikes against ISIS.

As a consequence of this new plan, the new No. 2 Squadron formed at Lossiemouth on 12 January 2015, with the old No. 2 Squadron at Marham being re-designated as No. 12 Squadron on 9 January.

During October and November 2016, four No. 2 Squadron Typhoons and support personnel deployed to the Far East to take part in exercises with Japan and South Korea. The Squadron operated from the Japan Air Self Defense Force base at Misawa on Honshu, to take part in &quot;Exercise Guardian North 16&quot;. Subsequently, the Squadron was based at Osan Air Base in South Korea and took part in &quot;Exercise Invincible Shield,&quot; alongside the Republic of Korea Air Force and United States Air Force. It was the first time either Japan or South Korea had hosted exercises with a foreign nation other than the United States.

The squadron was awarded the Freedom of Angus on 26 July 2019, marking 106 years since it was first stationed at Montrose Air Station as part of the Royal Flying Corps. A parade took place in Montrose, which included a flypast of the squadron&#x27;s Typhoons.

== Heritage ==
=== Badge and motto ===
The squadron&#x27;s badge features the RAF roundel (three concentric circles) over a wake knot.It was approved by King Edward VIII in May 1936. The circles represent the RAF and the wake knot is derived from the coat of arms of Anglo-Saxon nobleman Hereward the Wake who defended the Isle of Ely during the 11th century Norman Conquest. The badge indicates the basic role of the squadron as a guardian of the army. 

The squadron has two mottos, the first &#x27;Hereward â Guardian of the Army&#x27;, reflects the unit&#x27;s historic army cooperation role. The second motto is &#x27;second to none&#x27;.

=== Markings ===
The squadron&#x27;s aircraft were first painted with black triangles in 1916, as a method of identification for friendly ground forces. The triangle was then incorporated into the squadron&#x27;s aircraft markings.

<text>&quot;The Immortal&quot; (original Spanish title: &quot;El inmortal&quot;) is a short story by Argentine writer Jorge Luis Borges, first published in February 1947, and later in the collection &quot;El Aleph&quot; in 1949. The story tells about a character who mistakenly achieves immortality and then, weary of a long life, struggles to lose it and writes an account of his experiences. The story consists of a quote, an introduction, five chapters, and a postscript. &quot;The Immortal&quot; has been described as &quot;the culmination of Borges&#x27; art&quot; by critic Ronald J. Christ.

== Plot summary ==
Borges begins by quoting Francis Bacon&#x27;s &quot;Essays&quot;, LVIII. &quot;Salomon saith, There is no new thing upon the earth. So that as Plato had an imagination, that all knowledge was but remembrance; so Salomon giveth his sentence, that all novelty is but oblivion.&quot;

The introduction takes place in London in the first part of June 1929. Herein the following five chapters are purported to have been found in the last of six volumes in small quarto (1715â20) of Alexander Pope&#x27;s &quot;Iliad&quot;, given to the Princess of Lucinge by a seller of rare books named Joseph Cartaphilus.

The story is an autobiographical tale told by a Roman soldier, Marcus Flaminius Rufus, during the reign of the emperor Diocletian. During a sleepless night in Thebes, Egypt, a mysterious man, exhausted and wounded, seeks refuge in his camp. Just before dying, he tells Rufus about a river whose waters bestow immortality on whoever drinks from it. The river is next to a place called the City of the Immortals. Determined to find it, Rufus sets out for Africa with his soldiers. The harsh conditions of the trip cause many of his men to desert. After hearing that the remaining soldiers are planning his death, Rufus flees and wanders through the desert.

Rufus wakes up from a nightmare to find himself tied up in a small recess on the side of a mountain inhabited by Troglodytes. Down below, he spots a polluted stream and jumps down to drink from it; wounded, he falls asleep. Over the next few days, he recovers and, seeing the City of the Immortals in the distance, is able to walk there, followed by a Troglodyte.

The City of the Immortals is an immense labyrinth with dead-end passages, inverted stairways, and many chaotic architectural structures. Rufus, horrified and repulsed by the city, describes it as &quot;a chaos of heterogeneous words, the body of a tiger or a bull in which teeth, organs and heads monstrously pullulate in mutual conjunction and hatred&quot;. He eventually escapes the city and finds the Troglodyte who followed him there waiting outside; he names him Argos (after the dog of Odysseus), and decides to teach him language. Soon after, though, Argos reveals that he is Homer, and that the Troglodytes are the Immortals, having destroyed the original City of the Immortals and (on the advice of Homer) replaced it with the labyrinth Rufus encountered.

Rufus spends centuries living with the Immortals, mostly immersed in thought, until the notion of the existence of a river with the powers to &quot;take away&quot; immortality causes the group to scatter in search of it in the tenth century. Rufus wanders the world, fighting at Stamford Bridge, transcribing the voyages of Sindbad the Sailor, and buying the aforementioned edition of Pope&#x27;s &quot;Iliad&quot; in 1714. In 1921, Rufus&#x27; ship runs aground in Eritrea while &quot;en route&quot; to Bombay, and he drinks from a spring, losing his immortality.

In the end, Rufus realizes that he has incorporated the experiences and words of Homer into his tale, but concludes that &quot;I have been Homer; soon, like Ulysses, I shall be Nobody; soon, I shall be all menâI shall be dead.&quot; Rufus is, in fact, the bookseller Cartaphilus, who, we learn at the beginning of the story, dies in October 1929 while returning to Smyrna.

The story ends with a brief postscript which discusses the fictional book &quot;A Coat of Many Colours&quot; by Dr. Nahum Cordovero, which argues that the tale of Rufus/Cartaphilus is apocryphal, on the basis of its interpolations of texts by Pliny, Thomas De Quincey, RenÃ© Descartes and George Bernard Shaw. The postscript ends with the unknown author of the postscript rejecting Cordovero&#x27;s claim.

== Analysis ==
&quot;The Immortal&quot; deals with several themes which are present throughout much of Borges&#x27; writing; one such theme is immortality. Borges&#x27; conception of immortality assumes various manifestations throughout his writing and even in this clearly titled piece of work, it is not clear exactly who is meant to be the immortal. On one hand, Rufus is clearly searching for the city of the immortals and therefore the being that he finds there must in fact be the immortal. However, it could also be said that Rufus becomes the immortal once he embarks upon his journey. In this sense, Borges&#x27; immortality has to do with a Nietzsche-inspired humanist immortality which revolves around the super-abundant development of the person as an individual. This theme is also developed in &quot;The Circular Ruins&quot;, &quot;The Garden of Forking Paths&quot;, &quot;The Sect of the Phoenix&quot; and, in a sense, throughout all of Borges&#x27; writing.

Another theme present is the infinite, which can also be found in much of Borges&#x27; writing. The constant symbol of the infinite is the labyrinth, which represents a dynamic of personal choice within the infinite permutations of existence. The troglodyte who makes patterns in the sand and the hero (Rufus) who finds himself questing after and achieving immortality should be seen as synonymous, all-encompassing representations of the choosing individual within the infinite flux of the universe&#x27;s permutations. As such, the infinite represents complete contradiction of the individual and also its validation.

&quot;The Immortal&quot; has been described as a fictional exploration of Nietzsche&#x27;s theory of eternal recurrence, in which infinite time has wiped out the identity of individuals. The story can be compared to Homer&#x27;s &quot;Odyssey&quot;, in the sense that it is a tribute to the universal, mythical proportion of Homer&#x27;s work. &quot;The Immortal&quot; displays Borges&#x27; literary irony, fusing Swiftian satire, George Bernard Shaw&#x27;s creative evolution in &quot;Back to Methusela&quot;, and the dream visions of Thomas De Quincey in a single work. Borges also comments on literary idealism in which the identities of component authors Homer, Shakespeare and Borges himself appear to merge into one another.

<text>The Member of Parliament for [[Ipswich (UK Parliament constituency)|Ipswich]] in Suffolk, Jamie Cann, of the Labour Party died on 15 October 2001.

The [[by-election]] was held on 22 November that year, and was the first of six by-elections which took place during the 53rd Parliament (2001â05). It was also the only British parliamentary by-election to take place in 2001.

With Labour still basking in the glow of their landslide general election victory just five months earlier, no opposition party was able to mount an effective challenge. The Liberal Democrats improved their position somewhat but remained in third place, and the Labour candidate Chris Mole was returned with a majority of over 4,000 votes.

The declaration broke with tradition by using live computer images, club music and lasers after the result was announced.

<doc id="838989" wikidata="Q4994879" url="?curid=838989" title="Code (cryptography)">
<text>In cryptology, a code is a method used to encrypt a message that operates at the level of meaning; that is, words or phrases are converted into something else. A code might transform &quot;change&quot; into &quot;CVGDK&quot; or &quot;cocktail lounge&quot;. The U.S. National Security Agency defined a code as &quot;A substitution cryptosystem in which the plaintext elements are primarily words, phrases, or sentences, and the code equivalents (called &quot;code groups&quot;) typically consist of letters or digits (or both) in otherwise meaningless combinations of identical length.&quot; A &quot;codebook&quot; is needed to encrypt, and decrypt the phrases or words.

By contrast, ciphers encrypt messages at the level of individual letters, or small groups of letters, or even, in modern ciphers, individual bits. Messages can be transformed first by a code, and then by a cipher. Such multiple encryption, or &quot;superencryption&quot; aims to make cryptanalysis more difficult.

Another comparison between codes and ciphers is that a code typically represents a letter or groups of letters directly without the use of mathematics. As such the numbers are configured to represent these three values: 1001 = A, 1002 = B, 1003 = C, ... . The resulting message, then would be 1001 1002 1003 to communicate ABC. Ciphers, however, utilize a mathematical formula to represent letters or groups of letters. For example, A = 1, B = 2, C = 3, ... . Thus the message ABC results by multiplying each letter&#x27;s value by 13. The message ABC, then would be 13 26 39.

Codes have a variety of drawbacks, including susceptibility to cryptanalysis and the difficulty of managing the cumbersome codebooks, so ciphers are now the dominant technique in modern cryptography.

In contrast, because codes are representational, they are not susceptible to mathematical analysis of the individual codebook elements. In the example, the message 13 26 39 can be cracked by dividing each number by 13 and then ranking them alphabetically. However, the focus of codebook cryptanalysis is the comparative frequency of the individual code elements matching the same frequency of letters within the plaintext messages using frequency analysis. In the above example, the code group, 1001, 1002, 1003, might occur more than once and that frequency might match the number of times that ABC occurs in plain text messages.

(In the past, or in non-technical contexts, &quot;code&quot; and &quot;cipher&quot; are often used to refer to any form of encryption).

==One- and two-part codes==
Codes are defined by &quot;codebooks&quot; (physical or notional), which are dictionaries of codegroups listed with their corresponding plaintext. Codes originally had the codegroups assigned in &#x27;plaintext order&#x27; for convenience of the code designed, or the encoder. For example, in a code using numeric code groups, a plaintext word starting with &quot;a&quot; would have a low-value group, while one starting with &quot;z&quot; would have a high-value group. The same codebook could be used to &quot;encode&quot; a plaintext message into a coded message or &quot;codetext&quot;, and &quot;decode&quot; a codetext back into plaintext message.

In order to make life more difficult for codebreakers, codemakers designed codes with no predictable relationship between the codegroups and the ordering of the matching plaintext. In practice, this meant that two codebooks were now required, one to find codegroups for encoding, the other to look up codegroups to find plaintext for decoding. Such &quot;two-part&quot; codes required more effort to develop, and twice as much effort to distribute (and discard safely when replaced), but they were harder to break. The Zimmermann Telegram in January 1917 used the German diplomatic &quot;0075&quot; two-part code system which contained upwards of 10,000 phrases and individual words.

==One-time code==
A one-time code is a prearranged word, phrase or symbol that is intended to be used only once to convey a simple message, often the signal to execute or abort some plan or confirm that it has succeeded or failed. One-time codes are often designed to be included in what would appear to be an innocent conversation. Done properly they are almost impossible to detect, though a trained analyst monitoring the communications of someone who has already aroused suspicion might be able to recognize a comment like &quot;Aunt Bertha has gone into labor&quot; as having an ominous meaning. Famous example of one time codes include:

*In the Bible, Jonathan prearranges a code with David, who is going into hiding from Jonathan&#x27;s father, King Saul. If, during archery practice, Jonathan tells the servant retrieving arrows &quot;the arrows are on this side of you,&quot; it&#x27;s safe for David to return to court, if the command is &quot;the arrows are beyond you,&quot; David must flee. 
*&quot;One if by land; two if by sea&quot; in &quot;Paul Revere&#x27;s Ride&quot; made famous in the poem by Henry Wadsworth Longfellow
*&quot;Climb Mount Niitaka&quot; - the signal to Japanese planes to begin the attack on Pearl Harbor
*During World War II the British Broadcasting Corporation&#x27;s overseas service frequently included &quot;personal messages&quot; as part of its regular broadcast schedule. The seemingly nonsensical stream of messages read out by announcers were actually one time codes intended for Special Operations Executive (SOE) agents operating behind enemy lines. An example might be &quot;The princess wears red shoes&quot; or &quot;Mimi&#x27;s cat is asleep under the table&quot;. Each code message was read out twice. By such means, the French Resistance were instructed to start sabotaging rail and other transport links the night before D-day.
*&quot;Over all of Spain, the sky is clear&quot; was a signal (broadcast on radio) to start the nationalist military revolt in Spain on July 17, 1936.

Sometimes messages are not prearranged and rely on shared knowledge hopefully known only to the recipients. An example is the telegram sent to U.S. President Harry Truman, then at the Potsdam Conference to meet with Soviet premier Joseph Stalin, informing Truman of the first successful test of an atomic bomb. 
:&quot;Operated on this morning. Diagnosis not yet complete but results seem satisfactory and already exceed expectations. Local press release necessary as interest extends great distance. Dr. Groves pleased. He returns tomorrow. I will keep you posted.&quot;

==Idiot code==

An &quot;idiot code&quot; is a code that is created by the parties using it. This type of communication is akin to the hand signals used by armies in the field.

Example: Any sentence where &#x27;day&#x27; and &#x27;night&#x27; are used means &#x27;attack&#x27;. The location mentioned in the following sentence specifies the location to be attacked.
*&quot;Plaintext:&quot; Attack X.
*&quot;Codetext:&quot; We walked day and night through the streets but couldn&#x27;t find it! Tomorrow we&#x27;ll head into X.

An early use of the term appears to be by George Perrault, a character in the science fiction book &quot;Friday&quot; by Robert A. Heinlein:

:The simplest sort [of code] and thereby impossible to break. The first ad told the person or persons concerned to carry out number seven or expect number seven or it said something about something designated as seven. This one says the same with respect to code item number ten. But the meaning of the numbers cannot be deduced through statistical analysis because the code can be changed long before a useful statistical universe can be reached. It&#x27;s an idiot code... and an idiot code can never be broken if the user has the good sense not to go too often to the well.

Terrorism expert Magnus Ranstorp said that the men who carried out the September 11 attacks on the United States used basic e-mail and what he calls &quot;idiot code&quot; to discuss their plans.

==Cryptanalysis of codes==
While solving a monoalphabetic substitution cipher is easy, solving even a simple code is difficult. Decrypting a coded message is a little like trying to translate a document written in a foreign language, with the task basically amounting to building up a &quot;dictionary&quot; of the codegroups and the plaintext words they represent.

One fingerhold on a simple code is the fact that some words are more common than others, such as &quot;the&quot; or &quot;a&quot; in English. In telegraphic messages, the codegroup for &quot;STOP&quot; (i.e., end of sentence or paragraph) is usually very common. This helps define the structure of the message in terms of sentences, if not their meaning, and this is cryptanalytically useful.

Further progress can be made against a code by collecting many codetexts encrypted with the same code and then using information from other sources 
*spies
*newspapers
*diplomatic cocktail party chat
*the location from where a message was sent
*where it was being sent to (i.e., traffic analysis)
*the time the message was sent, 
*events occurring before and after the message was sent
*the normal habits of the people sending the coded messages
*etc.

For example, a particular codegroup found almost exclusively in messages from a particular army and nowhere else might very well indicate the commander of that army. A codegroup that appears in messages preceding an attack on a particular location may very well stand for that location.

Cribs can be an immediate giveaway to the definitions of codegroups. As codegroups are determined, they can gradually build up a critical mass, with more and more codegroups revealed from context and educated guesswork. One-part codes are more vulnerable to such educated guesswork than two-part codes, since if the codenumber &quot;26839&quot; of a one-part code is determined to stand for &quot;bulldozer&quot;, then the lower codenumber &quot;17598&quot; will likely stand for a plaintext word that starts with &quot;a&quot; or &quot;b&quot;. At least, for simple one part codes.

Various tricks can be used to &quot;plant&quot; or &quot;sow&quot; information into a coded message, for example by executing a raid at a particular time and location against an enemy, and then examining code messages sent after the raid. Coding errors are a particularly useful fingerhold into a code; people reliably make errors, sometimes disastrous ones. Planting data and exploiting errors works against ciphers as well.

* The most obvious and, in principle at least, simplest way of cracking a code is to steal the codebook through bribery, burglary, or raiding parties â procedures sometimes glorified by the phrase &quot;practical cryptography&quot; â and this is a weakness for both codes and ciphers, though codebooks are generally larger and used longer than cipher keys. While a good code may be harder to break than a cipher, the need to write and distribute codebooks is seriously troublesome.

Constructing a new code is like building a new language and writing a dictionary for it; it was an especially big job before computers. If a code is compromised, the entire task must be done all over again, and that means a lot of work for both cryptographers and the code users. In practice, when codes were in widespread use, they were usually changed on a periodic basis to frustrate codebreakers, and to limit the useful life of stolen or copied codebooks.

Once codes have been created, codebook distribution is logistically clumsy, and increases chances the code will be compromised. There is a saying that &quot;Three people can keep a secret if two of them are dead,&quot; () and though it may be something of an exaggeration, a secret becomes harder to keep if it is shared among several people. Codes can be thought reasonably secure if they are only used by a few careful people, but if whole armies use the same codebook, security becomes much more difficult.

In contrast, the security of ciphers is generally dependent on protecting the cipher keys. Cipher keys can be stolen and people can betray them, but they are much easier to change and distribute.

== Superencipherment ==
It was common to encipher a message after first encoding it, to increase the difficulty of cryptanalysis. With a numerical code, this was commonly done with an &quot;additive&quot; - simply a long key number which was digit-by-digit added to the code groups, modulo 10. Unlike the codebooks, additives would be changed frequently. The famous Japanese Navy code, JN-25, was of this design.

<text>Special Vehicle Operations (SVO) is a term used throughout Ford Motor Company&#x27;s global operations as a performance group, first used in America as Ford&#x27;s own &quot;speed shop&quot;, with a separate budget from Ford&#x27;s regular operations. In 1993, the group was renamed Special Vehicle Team (SVT). As of 2015, SVO had been owned by Jaguar Land Rover, creating high performance versions of models such as the Jaguar F-Type and Range Rover Sports.

==SVO America==

In 1981, Ford formed the SVO group to design and develop performance parts and accessories related to the company&#x27;s racing programs. SVO was involved motorsports programs, expanding Ford racing, establishing a performance parts business, and producing road cars.

===Racing===

SVO turned its attention to building Mustangs for the Sports Car Club of America (SCCA) Trans-Am and International Motor Sports Association (IMSA) GT series. With engine builder Jack Roush now involved the factory-backed SVO Mustangs dominated Trans-Am, winning 17 of 34 contests in 1985-86, and by &#x27;89, Ford had scored 46 Trans-Am victories, more than all other manufacturers combined. SVO also helped end 9 years of Chevrolet NASCAR dominance, with Ford drivers finishing 1-2-3 in NASCAR&#x27;s final Winston Cup standings.

===Mustang SVO===

The group&#x27;s sole production car, the Ford Mustang SVO, was designed to compete directly with European sports sedans like BMW&#x27;s 3 Series. To reduce costs, they used the existing 2.3Â L turbocharged four-cylinder engine and Borg-Warner T-5 five-speed manual transmission from the Ford Thunderbird Turbo Coupe. The car had a different computer and air meter and added an intercooler, a Hurst shifter, KONI Group shock absorbers, and 16Â inch wheels, a novelty at the time. The car produced 175Â hp (130Â kW) for the 1984 model year (MY) and the first part of the 1985 MY, 205Â hp (152Â kW) after mid-1985 MY, and 200Â hp (149Â kW) for the 1986 model year. In total, 9,844 were built.

==SVO Australia==

SVO (Special Vehicle Operations) name was used in the 1990s by Southside Ford in Brisbane which was the only Ford Motorsport parts importer of the time. They released a limited run of EL Falcons to showcase what could be done with Ford Motorsport Parts. (Special Vehicle Options) Was established in Australia by Australian motor racing driver and engineer Mick Webb in the late 1980s. Dick Johnson had also used the SVO nameplate, originally on a prototype Turbo XF Falcon. Webb and Johnson both claimed ownership of the acronym, however it was Webb whom first registered its usage. Mick Webbâs SVO are still enhancing and modifying Ford products today. He owns and operates a factory in Ringwood, Victoria.

===Mick Webb&#x27;s SVO===

====EA Falcon SVO====
 
SVO first road car was based the then new Ford Falcon EA, starting with a &quot;S Pac&quot; or &quot;Fairmont Ghia&quot; trim levels. SVO added customised ROH 16&quot; wheels, Recaro seats, MOMO steering wheels, suspension upgrades including Bilstein shock absorbers, engine modifications, spoilers and two tone grey paint work. SVO had hoped that these cars would lead to a relationship with Ford Australia as a factory backed performance arm, however, at this Ford were not investing in performance or racing. The relationship didn&#x27;t evolve any further, but selected Ford dealers sold the SVO product.

SVO originally produced 600 Falcon Sedans, 100 Utes, 600 Fairlanes and 280 Capris.

====Other Models====

Melbourne and Sydney dealership records indicate that 5 SVO Fairlane NL models were produced between 1997 - 1998. Several Falcon (EL) XR8 and Fairmont (EL) Ghia&#x27;s were also produced by Southside Ford in Brisbane to showcase what imported Ford Motorsport parts branch in the U.S could be used to improve the Falcon. These were reviewed in Motor and Wheels magazines in 1997 and available in either a 195kW or a 215kW. The AU Falcon was also available with SVO enhancements, including a 185Â kW 6-cylinder engine.

====Motorsport====

SVO was successful in building (and racing) Falcons in the AUSCAR category.

<doc id="838991" wikidata="Q1638907" url="?curid=838991" title="Quadratojugal bone">
<text>The quadratojugal is a skull bone present in many vertebrates, including some living reptiles and amphibians.

== Anatomy and function ==
In animals with a quadratojugal bone, it is typically found connected to the jugal (cheek) bone from the front and the squamosal bone from above. It is usually positioned at the rear lower corner of the cranium. Many modern tetrapods lack a quadratojugal bone as it has been lost or fused to other bones. Modern examples of tetrapods without a quadratojugal include salamanders, mammals, birds, and squamates (lizards and snakes). In tetrapods with a quadratojugal bone, it often forms a portion of the jaw joint.

Developmentally, the quadratojugal bone is a dermal bone in the temporal series, forming the original braincase. The squamosal and quadratojugal bones together form the cheek region and may provide muscular attachments for facial muscles.

=== In reptiles and amphibians ===

In most modern reptiles and amphibians, the quadratojugal is a prominent, straplike bone in the skull and provides structural integrity in the postorbital region of the skull. In many reptiles, the inner face of the quadratojugal also connects to the quadrate bone which forms the cranium&#x27;s contribution to the jaw joint. Early in their evolution, diapsid reptiles evolved a lower temporal bar which was composed of the quadratojugal and jugal. The lower temporal bar forms the lower border of the infratemporal fenestra, one of two holes in the side of the head and a hallmark of a diapsidan skull. However, many diapsids, including modern squamates (lizards and snakes), have lost the lower temporal bar. Crocodilians and rhynchocephalians (the latter represented solely by the tuatara, &quot;Sphenodon&quot;) retain a quadratojugal. Turtles also seem to possess a quadratojugal. Among living amphibians, a quadratojugal is known to be present in some frogs and caecilians. However, it is notably absent in salamanders.

=== In birds ===
In modern birds, the quadratojugal bone is a thin and rodlike element of the skull. Upon ossification, the jugal and quadratojugal bones fuse to form the jugal bar, which is homologous to the lower temporal bar of other diapsids. The sections of the jugal bar derived from the jugal and quadratojugal articulate with the postorbital and squamosal bones, respectively. This facilitates cranial kinesis, by allowing the quadrate bone to rotate during opening of the upper jaw.

=== In mammals ===
Advanced cynodonts, including the mammaliaforms, have lost the quadratojugal, with the diminutive quadrate connecting to the stapes to function as a hearing structure. In modern mammals, the quadrate bone evolves to become the incus, one of the ossicles of the middle ear. This is an apomorphy of the mammalian clade, and is used to identify the fossil transition to mammals.

== Evolution ==

=== Origin ===
The quadratojugal likely originated within the clade Sarcopterygii, which includes tetrapods and lobe-finned fish. Although a tiny bone similar in position to the quadratojugal has been observed in the placoderm &quot;Entelognathus&quot; and some early actinopterygiians (&quot;Mimipiscis&quot;, &quot;Cheirolepis&quot;), it is unclear whether this bone was homologous to the quadratojugal. A quadratojugal is absent in actinians (coelacanths) and onychodonts, but it was clearly present in Porolepiformes, distant relatives of modern dipnoans (lungfish). Many paleontologists argue that the quadratojugal was formed by a division of the preoperculum, although a few believe that it was present before the preoperculum formed. All tetrapodomorph fish had a quadratojugal, retained by their tetrapod descendants. Elpistostegalians such as &quot;Panderichthys&quot;, &quot;Tiktaalik&quot;, and other very tetrapod-like fish were the first vertebrates to have contact between the quadratojugal and jugal. Before the elpistostegalians, the jugal was small and isolated from the quadratojugal by the squamosal and maxilla.

Amphibians (in the broad sense) typically had long, roughly rectangular quadratojugals that contacted the maxilla, jugal, squamosal, and quadrate. In several lineages, most of them traditionally considered &quot;Reptiliomorpha&quot;, the jugal expands downwards to reduce the amount of contact between the quadratojugal and maxilla. This is exemplified in reptiles, which have completely lost the contact. Most urodelans (salamanders) lack quadratojugals, except the Miocene genus &quot;Chelotriton&quot;. A quadratojugal is also missing in the caecilian-like Triassic stereospondyl &quot;Chinlestegophis&quot; as well as the lysorophians, a group of long-bodied Paleozoic microsaurs. Many other microsaurs had heavily reduced quadratojugals.

=== Synapsids ===

In synapsids (mammals and their extinct relatives), the quadratojugal undergoes significant transformation during the evolution of the group. Early synapsids such as eothyridids and caseids retained long quadratojugals and in some cases even reacquire quadratojugal-maxilla contact. In most therapsids, including gorgonopsians, therocephalians, and dicynodonts, the quadratojugal is tiny, having lost its contact with the jugal. It usually fuses with the equally small quadrate to form the quadrate-quadratojugal complex. Oddly enough, the cynodont &quot;Thrinaxodon&quot; retains a separate quadratojugal. In other cynodonts such as &quot;Cynognathus&quot;, the quadrate-quadratojugal complex remains hidden within the skull, obscured from the side by the large squamosal bone which loosely articulates with it.

=== Sauropsids ===
Sauropsids, the group containing reptiles and birds, had completely lost the contact between the quadratojugal and maxilla. In diapsids, the quadratojugal and jugal form the lower temporal bar, which defines the lower border of the infratemporal fenestra, one of two holes in the side of the head. In early diapsids such as &quot;Petrolacosaurus&quot; and &quot;Youngina&quot;, the quadratojugal is long as in amphibians, early synapsids, and &quot;anapsid&quot; reptiles. It forms most of the length of the lower temporal bar. However, significant transformation of the temporal region of the skull occurs in many more &quot;advanced&quot; members of Diapsida, with implications for the structure of the quadratojugal.

Numerous diapsids have an incomplete lower temporal bar, where the quadratojugal and jugal fail to contact each other. This leaves the infratemporal fenestra with an arch-like structure, open from below. An incomplete (or absent) lower temporal bar is first seen in the Permian genus &quot;Claudiosaurus&quot;, and is retained by most other Permian and Triassic diapsids. In many cases, the quadratojugal is lost completely. This loss occurs in several Triassic marine reptiles such as tanystropheids, thalattosaurs, pistosaurs, and plesiosaurs. Squamates, the group containing modern lizards and snakes, also lack a quadratojugal, but early squamate relatives such as &quot;Marmoretta&quot; do retain the bone. Ichthyosaurs, a group without a lower temporal bar, have a quadratojugal that is taller than it is long, stretching above (rather than below) the open infratemporal fenestra to contact the postorbital bone (rather than the jugal). Early turtles such as &quot;Proganochelys&quot; also have a tall quadratojugal, which contacts the jugal without any trace of the infratemporal fenestra.

Several Triassic reptiles reacquire the lower temporal bar, albeit with the jugal forming most of the bar&#x27;s length. In these reptiles, the quadratojugal is a small L- or T-shaped bone at the rear edge of the skull. Although early rhynchocephalians such as &quot;Gephyrosaurus&quot; have an incomplete lower temporal bar and a quadratojugal fused to the quadrate, later members of the group such as the modern tuatara (&quot;Sphenodon&quot;) do have a complete lower temporal bar, albeit with the quadratojugal still fused to the quadrate. All members of the group Archosauriformes, which contains archosaurs such as crocodilians and dinosaurs, have a complete lower temporal bar. This is also the case in placodonts, &quot;Trilophosaurus&quot;, some rhynchosaurs, and choristoderes.

Modern birds have a quadratojugal which is assimilated into the thin, splint-like jugal. However, a separate quadratojugal is retained by several Mesozoic avialans, such as &quot;Archaeopteryx&quot; and &quot;Pterygornis&quot;. Non-avialan dinosaurs also have a separate quadratojugal.

<text>The articular bone is part of the lower jaw of most vertebrates, including most jawed fish, amphibians, birds and various kinds of reptiles, as well as ancestral mammals. 

== Anatomy ==
In most vertebrates, the articular bone is connected to two other lower jaw bones, the suprangular and the angular. Developmentally, it originates from the embryonic mandibular cartilage. The most caudal portion of the mandibular cartilage ossifies to form the articular bone, while the remainder of the mandibular cartilage either remains cartilaginous or disappears.

=== In snakes ===
In snakes, the articular, surangular, and prearticular bones have fused to form the compound bone. The mandible is suspended from the quadrate bone and articulates at this compound bone.

== Function ==

=== In amphibians and reptiles ===
In most tetrapods, the articular bone forms the lower portion of the jaw joint. The upper jaw articulates at the quadrate bone. 

=== In mammals ===
In mammals, the articular bone evolves to form the malleus, one of the mammalian ossicles of the middle ear. This is an apomorphy of the mammalian clade, and is used to determine the fossil transition to mammals. It is analogous to, but not homologous to the articular process of the lower jaw.

After the loss of the quadrate-articular joint, the squamosal and dentary bones form the new jaw joint in mammals.

<text>Chak Chak or Chek Chek (, ), also called ChÄhak-e ArdakÄn (, ) or PÄ«r-e Sabz (, ), is a village in the Yazd Province of Iran. Located near the city of Ardakan, its existence was noted in the 2006 Iranian census, but its population was not reported.

The village consists of a &quot;pir&quot; (a pilgrimage site for Zoroastrians) perched beneath a towering cliff face in the desert of central Iran. It is the most sacred of the mountain shrines of Zoroastrianism, which was formerly the majority and official religion of the Iranian nation. Each year, from 14 to 18 June, thousands of Zoroastrians from Iran and India, among other countries, flock to the site&#x27;s fire temple.

== In Zoroastrian tradition ==

Among some Zoroastrians, it is believed that Chak Chak is where Nikbanou, the second daughter of the Iranian king Yazdegerd III, was cornered by the Rashidun army in 640 CE, during the Arab conquest of Iran. Fearing that she would be captured, she prayed to Ahura Mazda for protection, prompting the mountain to miraculously open up and provide her with shelter.

Notable features of Chak Chak include the mountain&#x27;s ever-dripping spring, which are said to be tears of grief that are shed in remembrance of Nikbanou. Growing beside the holy spring is an immense and ancient tree that is said to be Nikbanou&#x27;s cane. Legend also has it that a petrified colorful cloth from Nikbanou was also visible in the rocks, although pilgrims have since removed it.

== Temple of Chak Chak ==
The actual temple of Chak Chak is a man-made grotto sheltered by two large bronze doors. The shrine enclosure is floored with marble and its walls are darkened by fires eternally burning in the sanctuary. In the cliffs below the shrine are several roofed pavilions constructed to accommodate pilgrims.

<text>The surangular or suprangular is a jaw bone found in most land vertebrates, except mammals. Usually in the back of the jaw, on the upper edge, it is connected to all other jaw bones: dentary, angular, splenial and articular. It is often a muscle attachment site.

<text>The Trans-Mississippi Issue is a set of nine commemorative postage stamps issued by the United States to mark the 1898 Trans-Mississippi Exposition held in Omaha, Nebraska. The finely engraved stamps depict various scenes of the West and are presently valued much by collectors. This was only the second commemorative issue offered by the U.S. Post Office and closely followed the pattern of its predecessor, the Columbian Exposition series of 1893: both sets appeared in conjunction with important international world&#x27;s fairs; both offered a wide range of stamp denominations; both adopted the double-width stamp format to accommodate pictorial tableaux.

An important factor in the creation of this series was that the Director of Publicity for the ExpositionâEdward Rosewater, publisher of the &quot;Omaha Daily Bee&quot;âwas something of an expert in stamps. Rosewater, nationally prominent in Republican politics, had been selected by President McKinley to preside over the U.S. delegatation at the 1897 Congress of the Universal Postal Union (the international convention responsible for securing efficiency in the flow of mail from country to country, tasked that year with securing cheaper international postage). On December 13, 1897, Rosewater suggested that the Post Office issue special stamps commemorating the Trans-Mississippi Exposition (as it had for the Columbian Exposition), and 10 days later Postmaster General James A. Gary agreed, promising a series with five denominations ranging from one cent to one dollar. Gary asked Rosewater for his ideas about stamp subjects, and the latter, in response sent handsome wash drawings on tracing paper for the five values: 1Â¢, bison herd (dusky orange); 2Â¢, Indian on horseback (deep orange-red); 5Â¢, ploughman and plough horse (dark yellow); 10Â¢, train rounding a steep mountain pass (dusky blue); $1, torchbearing goddess (Columbia) perched upon a globe (deep orange yellow). These stamps would have been of the large Columbian size but rotated in orientation, with the short sides at the top and bottom. (Curiously, the U.S. would not issue a &quot;vertical commemorative&quot; of this sort until 1926, when the Erickson Memorial appeared.)

Gary&#x27;s announcement of the series prompted protests from stamp collectors, who were still unhappy about the high price of the Columbian Issue of 1893 ($16.34, a princely sum at the time), but the Postmaster said he decided on the issue &quot;because I wanted to help the people of the West.&quot; Indeed, Gary subsequently made the set even more expensive by adding four more stamps to the series, including a $2 denomination, raising its price to $3.80.

Design concepts solicited from various artists won out over Rosewater&#x27;s suggestions; indeed, the officials of Bureau of Engraving and Printing deemed it imperative for their institutional reputation to produce a series of unquestioned artistic distinction, given that their only previous stamp release, the definitive issue of 1894, had merely been a utilitarian revamping of the 1890 series designed by the American Banknote Company. The new set would have to compare favorably withâor even betterâthe preceding, privately produced Columbian commemoratives. The resulting planâmore ambitious than the Columbians in one respectâwas to print the Trans-Mississippi stamps with colored frames and black centers, which would have required two separate stages of printing (the Columbians had all been monocolored). During April 1898, however, the SpanishâAmerican War began, and the Bureau of Engraving and Printingânow required to produce large numbers of revenue stampsâchose to save labor and press time by printing the Trans-Mississippi designs in single colors after all. This, however, meant that the dies designed for two-toned production had to be retooled (white space surrounding the vignettes had to be filled in with shading that reached the edge of the frames), a process that delayed the release of the stamps until June 17, more than two weeks after the Exposition opened.

Philatelic protests notwithstanding, they were received favorably by the general public. They were sold until the end of the year, and postmasters were directed to return unsold stock, which was then incinerated. (Although the numbers printed are known, the numbers returned were not recorded, and so the numbers of existing stamps are unknown.)

The stamps, designed by Raymond Ostrander Smith, all have the same shape of frame (a legacy of the bicolor plan); the numerals of value and &quot;UNITED STATES OF AMERICA&quot; at the top; and &quot;POSTAGE&quot; with a spelled-out value at the bottom up through the 50c denomination, the dollar values being in numerals. Ears of wheat and corn appear in odd corners of the frame. Each center design is inscribed with its title:
* 1Â¢ dark green â &quot;Marquette on the Mississippi&quot;
* 2Â¢ copper red â &quot;Farming in the West&quot;
* 4Â¢ orange â &quot;Indian Hunting Buffalo&quot;
* 5Â¢ dark blue â &quot;Fremont on Rocky Mountains&quot;
* 8Â¢ violet brown â &quot;Troops Guarding Train&quot;
* 10Â¢ slate â &quot;Hardships of Emigration&quot;
* 50Â¢ olive â &quot;Western Mining Prospector&quot;
* $1 black â &quot;Western Cattle in Storm&quot;
* $2 orange brown â &quot;Mississippi River Bridge&quot; (the Eads Bridge) 

The designs were adapted from various photographs, drawings, and paintings; both the 8Â¢ and 50Â¢ values reproduced drawings by Frederic Remington. While all have been praised for their quality, the $1 value, commonly called the &quot;Black Bull&quot;, stands out from the rest. Ironically, it does not reproduce a Western American scene, but was taken from a painting of cattle in the Scottish Highlands by John A. MacWhirter (see also Western Cattle in Storm).

The vignettes of the issue were executed by three engravers: Marcus Baldwin (2Â¢, 5Â¢, 10Â¢, $1), George Smillie (1Â¢, 4Â¢, 50Â¢, $2) and Robert Ponickau (8Â¢). Baldwin also engraved all the frames except that of the 2Â¢ stamp, which was the work of Douglas Ronaldsonâwho in addition engraved all of the numerals and lettering of the Trans-Mississippi series.

The 2Â¢ stamp violates the convention of the time that no living person could be depicted on a U.S. Postal issue. In the photograph of North Dakota harvesting that served as the basis for the engraved vignette, the three figures in the foreground have been identified as the farm worker Ed Nybakken, the field boss Elihu Barber and the foreman Sam White.

During 1998, to commemorate the 100th anniversary of the issue, the United States Postal Service issued a miniature sheet of the nine, each printed in two colors, and a sheet of nine of the &quot;Black Bull&quot;. In most of the images, the original color scheme was preserved, but for the &quot;Black Bull&quot; the hue of the frame was changed from violet-brown to bright red. The designs are reproductions; each has a small &quot;1998&quot; in the lower left corner. In a revival of the original designs, the pictures in the 2Â¢ and $2 stamps were swapped, and &quot;Farming&quot; was changed back to &quot;Harvesting.&quot;

<doc id="839011" wikidata="Q3178594" url="?curid=839011" title="Jugal bone">
<text>The jugal is a skull bone found in most reptiles, amphibians and birds. In mammals, the jugal is often called the malar or zygomatic. It is connected to the quadratojugal and maxilla, as well as other bones, which may vary by species.

== Anatomy ==
The jugal bone is located on either side of the skull in the circumorbital region. It is the origin of several masticatory muscles in the skull. The jugal and lacrimal bones are the only two remaining from the ancestral circumorbital series: the prefrontal, postfrontal, postorbital, jugal, and lacrimal bones.

During development, the jugal bone originates from dermal bone.

=== In dinosaurs ===
This bone is considered key in the determination of general traits in cases in which the entire skull has not been found intact (for instance, as with dinosaurs in paleontology). In some dinosaur genera the jugal also forms part of the lower margin of either the antorbital fenestra or the infratemporal fenestra, or both. Most commonly, this bone articulates with the quadratojugal, the postorbital, the lacrimal, and the maxilla. In horned dinosaurs, like &quot;Pentaceratops&quot;, the jugal bone is thick and comes to a point, which has led paleontologists to refer to it as the &quot;jugal horn&quot;.

== Function ==
=== In reptiles ===
The earliest reptiles primitively had a lower temporal bar (also referred to as a temporal arcade) where the posterior of the jugal bone contacts the quadratojugal. This structure has been repeatedly lost and regained in various groups.

=== In birds ===
While the jugal bone is thick and straplike in most other reptiles, the jugal bone is thin and strutlike in birds. This is thought to reduce the weight of the skull and facilitate cranial kinesis.

=== In mammals ===

In mammals, including humans, the jugal bone is more commonly referred to as the zygoma. It assists in constructing the facial contour, protecting the eye from damage, and providing attachment sites for facial muscles. The zygoma provides important functions as the origin of the masseter muscle and as a point of resistance for masticatory forces. Preliminary studies also indicate that variation in zygomatic structure may be useful in determining ancestral origins of modern human populations.

<text>Iron(II) fumarate, also known as ferrous fumarate, is the iron(II) salt of fumaric acid, occurring as a reddish-orange powder, used to supplement iron intake. It has the chemical formula . Pure ferrous fumarate has an iron content of 32.87%, therefore one tablet of 300Â mg iron fumarate will contain 98.6Â mg of iron (548% Daily Value based on 18Â mg RDI).

==Iron supplement==
Ferrous fumarate is often taken orally as an iron supplement to treat or prevent iron deficiency anemia. Mixtures of ferrous fumarate and potassium iodate, &quot;double fortified salt&quot;, are used to address both iron and iodine deficiencies.

<text>LGA 775 (land grid array 775), also known as Socket T, is an Intel desktop CPU socket. Unlike PGA CPU sockets, such as its predecessor Socket 478, LGA 775 has no socket holes; instead, it has 775 protruding pins which touch contact points on the underside of the processor (CPU).

Intel started selling LGA 775 (Socket T) CPUs with the 64-bit version of their 90 nm &quot;Prescott&quot;-based Pentium 4 HT.

The socket had an unusually long life span, lasting 7 years until the last processors supporting it ceased production in 2011. The socket was superseded by the LGA 1156 (Socket H) and LGA 1366 (Socket B) sockets.

== LGA 775 processors ==

(Note: Some of the processors listed here might not work on newer Intel based chipsets; see &quot;LGA 775 compatibility&quot; below.) 

* Pentium 4
* Pentium 4 Extreme Edition
* Pentium D
* Celeron/Celeron D
* Pentium Dual-Core
* Pentium Extreme Edition
* Core 2 Duo/Core 2 Quad
* Core 2 Extreme

== Heatsink design ==
For LGA 775, the distance between the screw-holes for the heatsink is 72 mm. Such heat-sinks are not interchangeable with heatsinks for sockets that have a distance of 75 mm, such as LGA 1156, LGA 1155, LGA 1150, LGA 1151 and LGA 1200.

==Chipsets==

LGA 775 was the last Intel socket for desktops for which third-party companies manufactured chipsets. Nvidia was the last third-party manufacturer of LGA 775 chipsets (its final product was MCP7A family, marketed as GeForce 9300/9400, launched in October 2008), as other third-parties discontinued their products earlier. All chipsets for superseding sockets were exclusively designed and manufactured by Intel, a practice later also adopted by AMD when they first launched APUs in 2011 (Socket AM3+ processors, also launched in 2011, were usually paired with motherboard with AMD chipsets, but some motherboards using third-party chipsets were also manufactured, usually with Nvidia chipsets, as the Socket AM3+ design was directly extended from the earlier Socket AM3 design).

==Improvements in heat dissipation==
The force from the load plate ensures that the processor is completely level, giving the CPU&#x27;s upper surface optimal contact with the heat sink or cold-water block fixed onto the top of the CPU to carry away the heat generated by the CPU. This socket also introduces a new method of connecting the heat dissipation interface to the chip surface and motherboard. With LGA 775, the heat dissipation interface is connected directly to the motherboard on four points, compared with the two connections of Socket 370 and the &quot;clamshell&quot; four-point connection of Socket 478. This was done to avoid the reputed danger of the heat sinks/fans of pre-built computers falling off in transit. LGA 775 was announced to have better heat dissipation properties than the Socket 478 it was designed to replace, but the Prescott core CPUs (in their early incarnations) ran much hotter than the previous Northwood-core Pentium 4 CPUs, and this initially neutralized the benefits of better heat transfer. However, the later Core 2 processors run at much lower temperatures than the Prescott CPUs they replaced. 

Processors with lower TDP and clock speeds only used Thermal Interface Compound in between the die and the integrated heat spreader (IHS), while processors with higher TDP and clock speeds have the die soldered directly to the IHS, allowing for better heat transfer between the CPU and the integrated heat spreader. 

==LGA 775 mechanical load limits==

All LGA 775 processors have the following mechanical maximum load limits which should not be exceeded during heat sink assembly, shipping conditions, or standard use. Load above those limits could crack the processor die and make it unusable. The limits are included in the table below.

The transition to the LGA packaging has lowered those load limits, which are smaller than the load limits of Socket 478 processors but they are bigger than Socket 370, Socket 423 and Socket A processors, which were fragile. They are large enough to ensure that processors will not crack.

==LGA 775 compatibility==
Compatibility is quite variable, as earlier chipsets (Intel 915 and below) tend to support only single core NetBurst Pentium 4 and Celeron CPUs at an FSB of 533/800 MT/s.

Intermediate chipsets (e.g. Intel 945) commonly support both single core Pentium 4-based CPUs as well as dual core Pentium D processors. Some motherboards using the 945 chipset could be given a BIOS upgrade to support 65nm Core-based processors. Other chipsets have varying levels of CPU support, generally following the release of contemporary CPUs, as LGA 775 CPU support is a complicated mixture of chipset capability, voltage regulator limitations and BIOS support. For example, the newer Q45 chipset does not support NetBurst-based CPUs such as the Pentium 4, Pentium D, Pentium Extreme Edition, and Celeron D.

== Virtualization capabilities ==
Some Core 2 and other LGA 775 processors are capable of hardware-accelerated virtualization. However, more recent hypervisors might not be compatible with these CPUs because they lack support for Extended Page Tables.

<text>The Yakovlev Yak-3 (Russian: Ð¯ÐºÐ¾Ð²Ð»ÐµÐ² Ð¯Ðº-3) is a single-engine, single-seat World War II Soviet fighter. Robust and easy to maintain, it was much liked by both pilots and ground crew. One of the smallest and lightest combat fighters fielded by any combatant during the war, its high power-to-weight ratio gave it excellent performance and it proved to be a formidable dogfighter.

==Origins==
The origins of the Yak-3 went back to 1941 when the I-30 prototype was offered along with the I-26 (Yak-1) as an alternative design. The I-30, powered by a Klimov M-105P engine, was of all-metal construction, using a wing with dihedral on the outer panels. Like the early Yak-1, it had a ShVAK cannon firing through the hollow-driveshaft nose spinner as a &quot;motornaya pushka&quot; (Ð¼Ð¾ÑÐ¾ÑÐ½Ð°Ñ Ð¿ÑÑÐºÐ° - Literally: &#x27;Motor Cannon&#x27;), twin synchronized ShKAS machine guns in cowling mounts and a ShVAK cannon in each wing.

During the Battle of Stalingrad, Luftwaffe fighters exhibited significant speed, climb rate, and armament advantages over those of the VVS. The Yak-1 then in service was understood to be in urgent need of a modernization were it to fight on equal footing against the latest models of German fighters, as well as better energy retention and higher firepower.

Then, in 1943, a group of designers headed by Alexander Sergeyevich Yakovlev designed the Yak-3, a further development of the proven Yak-1 aimed at improving survivability, flight characteristics and firepower, which required a lower weight, a higher-power engine and therefore, faster speed.

==Design and development==

The first of two prototypes had a slatted wing to improve handling and short-field performance while the second prototype had a wooden wing without slats in order to simplify production and save aluminium. The second prototype crashed during flight tests and was written off. Although there were plans to put the Yak-3 into production, the scarcity of aviation aluminium and the pressure of the Nazi invasion led to work on the first Yak-3 being abandoned in late 1941.

In between 1942 and 1943, Yakovlev built the Yak-1M, a prototype that would ultimately lead to the Yak-3, coupled with the VK-105PF2, the latest iteration of the VK-105 engine family, where &quot;P&quot; indicated support for a &quot;motornaya pushka&quot; - an autocannon that fires between the engine banks, through the hollow propeller shaft - mounting. It incorporated a wing of similar design but with smaller surface area (), and had further aerodynamic refinements, like the new placement of the oil radiator, from the chin to the wing roots (one of the visual differences with the Yak-1, -7, -9). A second Yak-1M (originally meant as a &quot;backup&quot;) prototype was constructed later that year, differing from the first aircraft in that it had plywood instead of fabric covering of the rear fuselage, mastless radio antenna, reflector gunsight and improved armour and engine cooling.

After the VK-105PF2 engine received a boost from a manifold pressure of 1050 mmHg to 1100 mmHg, additional tests were needed to determine how it impacted the flight characteristics of the Yak-3. State trials revealed that this boost reduced the time needed to reach by 0.1 seconds, the takeoff run by , altitude gain in a combat loop by , and speed below by .

The chief test pilot for the project Petr Mikhailovich Stefanovskiy was so impressed with the new aircraft that he recommended that it should completely replace the Yak-1 and Yak-7 with only the Yak-9 retained in production for further work with the Klimov VK-107 engine. The new fighter, designated the Yak-3, entered service in 1944, later than the Yak-9 despite the lower designation number, and by mid-1946 4,848 had been built.

The designation Yak-3 was also used for other Yakovlev projects â a proposed but never built, heavy twin-engine fighter and the Yakovlev Yak-7A.

The first 197 Yak-3 were lightly armed with a single &quot;motornaya pushka&quot;-mount ShVAK cannon and one UBS synchronized machine gun, with subsequent aircraft receiving a second UBS for a weight of fire of per second using high-explosive ammunition. All armament was installed close to the axis of the aircraft with a cannon mounted in the engine &quot;vee&quot; firing through the propeller boss, synchronised machine guns in the fuselage, helping accuracy and leaving wings unloaded.

==Operational history==

Lighter and smaller than the Yak-9 but powered by the same engine, the Yak-3 was a forgiving, easy-to-handle aircraft loved by both novice and experienced pilots. It was robust, easy to maintain and a highly successful dog-fighter. It was used mostly as a tactical fighter, flying low over battlefields and engaging in dogfights below .

The new aircraft began to reach frontline units during summer 1944. Yak-3 service tests were conducted by 91st IAP of the 2nd Air Army, commanded by Lt Colonel Kovalyov, in JuneâJuly 1944. The regiment had the task of gaining air superiority. During 431 sorties, 20 &quot;Luftwaffe&quot; fighters and three Junkers Ju 87s were shot down while Soviet losses amounted to two Yak-3s shot down. A large dogfight developed on 16 June 1944, when 18 Yak-3s clashed with 24 German aircraft. Soviet Yak-3 fighters shot down 15 German aircraft for the loss of one Yak destroyed and one damaged. The following day, &quot;Luftwaffe&quot; activity over that section of the front had virtually ceased.
On 17 July 1944, eight Yaks attacked a formation of 60 German aircraft, including escorting fighters. In the ensuing dogfight, the Luftwaffe lost three Ju 87s and four Bf 109Gs, for no loss. The &quot;Luftwaffe&quot; issued an order to &quot;avoid combat below five thousand metres with Yakovlev fighters lacking an oil cooler intake beneath the nose!&quot; &quot;Luftwaffe&quot; fighters in combat with the Yak-3 tried to use surprise tactics, attacking from above.

Unresolved wartime problems with the Yak-3 included plywood surfaces delaminating when the aircraft pulled out of a high-speed dive, short range and poor engine reliability. The pneumatic system for actuating landing gear, flaps and brakes, typical for all Yakovlev fighters of the time, was troublesome. Though less reliable than hydraulic or electrical alternatives, the pneumatic system was preferred owing to the weight saving.

In 1944, the Normandie-Niemen Group re-equipped with the Yak-3, scoring the last 99 of their 273 air victories against the &quot;Luftwaffe&quot;.

Total Yak-3 losses in combat were 210, 60 in 1944 and 150 in 1945.

==Variants==

; Yak-3: main production version
; Yak-3 (VK-107A): Klimov VK-107A engine with and 2 Ã Berezin B-20 cannons with 120 rpg. After several mixed-construction prototypes, 48 all-metal production aircraft were built in 1945â1946 during and after WW2. Despite excellent performance ( at ), it saw only limited squadron service with the 897th IAP. Though the problems with the VK-107 overheating were eventually mitigated, it was decided to leave the engine for the better-suited Yak-9.
; Yak-3 (VK-108): Yak-3 (VK-107A) modified with VK-108 engine with , and armed a single Nudelman-Suranov NS-23 cannon with 60 rounds of ammunition. The aircraft reached at in testing but suffered from significant engine overheating. Another Yak-3 with 2 Ã Berezin B-20 cannons was also fitted with the engine with similar results.
; Yak-3K: Armed with a Nudelman-Suranov NS-45 cannon, only a few built because Yak-9K was a better match for the weapon
; Yak-3P: Production started after war armed with 3 Ã Berezin B-20 cannon with 120 rounds for the middle cannon and 130 rpg for the side weapons. A total of 596 being built, none of them took part in combat. The three-cannon armament with full ammunition load was actually lighter than that of a standard Yak-3, and the one-second burst mass of was greater than that of most contemporary fighters.
; Yak-3PD: high-altitude interceptor with Klimov VK-105PD engine and a single Nudelman-Suranov NS-23 cannon with 60 rounds of ammunition, reached in testing but did not enter production due to unreliability of the engine.
; Yak-3RD (Yak-3D): experimental aircraft with an auxiliary Glushko RD-1 liquid-fuel rocket engine with of thrust in the modified tail, armed with a single Nudelman-Suranov NS-23 cannon with 60 rounds of ammunition. On 11 May 1945, the aircraft reached at . During the 16 August test flight, the aircraft crashed for unknown reasons, killing the test pilot V.L. Rastorguev. Like all mixed powerplant aircraft of the time, the project was abandoned in favor of turbojet engines.
; Yak-3T: tank destroyer version armed with 1 Ã Nudelman N-37 cannon with 25 rounds and 2 Ã Berezin B-20S cannons with 100 rpg. Cockpit was moved back to compensate for the heavier nose. Engine modifications required to accept the weapons resulted in serious overheating problems which were never fixed and the aircraft did not advance beyond the prototype stage.
; Yak-3T-57: single Yak-3T with a OKB-16-57 cannon
; Yak-3TK: powered by a VK-107A engine, and fitted with an exhaust turbocharger.
; Yak-3U: Yak-3 fitted with Shvetsov ASh-82FN radial engine with in an attempt to increase performance while avoiding the overheating problems of VK-107 and VK-108. Wingspan increased by , wings moved forward, cockpit raised by . Armament of 2 Ã Berezin B-20 cannons with 120 rpg. The prototype reached at and while successful did not enter production because it was completed after the war.
; Yak-3UTI: two-seat conversion trainer based on Yak-3U powered by Shvetsov ASh-21 radial piston engine. The aircraft became the prototype for the Yak-11.

==Reproductions==

From 1991 to 2002 there were 21 Yakovlev Yak-3, Yak-7 and Yak-9 aircraft produced in the former Soviet Union using the original plans and dies. These aircraft are powered by the American Allison V-1710 or the Pratt &amp; Whitney R-1830 Twin Wasp engine in place of the Klimov V-12s used during the war. Several of these aircraft are airworthy, mostly based in the United States with others in Germany, Australia and New Zealand. Others have been converted to &quot;Yak-3U&quot; status from original Yak-11 trainers for private owners and museums.

Flying a modified modern production Yak-3UPW powered by a Pratt &amp; Whitney R-2000 engine, William Whiteside set an official international speed record for piston-engined aircraft in the under- category on 10 October 2011, reaching over a course at the Bonneville Salt Flats in Utah in the United States, greatly exceeding the previous record of set in 2002 by Jim Wright. The following day, Whiteside used the same aircraft to set an unofficial speed record for aircraft in the category of over the same 3-km (1.863-mile) course.

<text>Socket 423 is a 423-pin CPU socket used by Intel&#x27;s first generation of Pentium 4 processors based on the Willamette core.

This socket was short-lived, as it became apparent that its electrical design proved inadequate for raising clock speeds beyond 2.0Â GHz. Intel produced chips using this socket for less than a year, from November 2000 to August 2001.

Socket 423 was replaced by Socket 478 in 2001. Socket 478, being microPGA, was cheaper to manufacture than Socket 423.

==Technical specifications==
Socket 423 was designed to house any processor in the Socket 423 package.

All processors using this socket have a locked multiplier, meaning that they are not overclockable unless the front side bus frequency is increased. Doing this, however could push other buses out of spec, causing erratic behaviors such as system instability and premature failure.

The &quot;PowerLeap PL-P4/N&quot; is a device developed in the form of a socket adapter that allows the use of Socket 478 processors in Socket 423 motherboards.

<text>Evagoras or Euagoras () was the king of Salamis (411â374 BC) in Cyprus, known especially from the work of Isocrates, who presents him as a model ruler.

==History==

He claimed descent from Teucer, the son of Telamon and half-brother of Ajax, and his family had long been rulers of Salamis, although during his childhood, Salamis came under Phoenician control, which resulted in his exile. While in Cilicia, Evagoras gathered the support of 50 followers and returned secretly in 410 BC, to gain possession of the throne. Expecting an eventual Persian response to recapture Cyprus, he cultivated the friendship of the Athenians, and after Conon&#x27;s defeat at the Battle of Aegospotami he provided him with a refuge. For a time, he also maintained friendly relations with the Achaemenid Empire, and secured the aid of Artaxerxes II for Athens against Lacedaemon. He took part in the Battle of Cnidus of 394 BC which he provided most of the resources for and in which the Lacedaemonian fleet was defeated thanks to his efforts, and for this service his statue was placed by the Athenians side by side with that of Conon in the Ceramicus. However, relations between Evagoras and the Persians became strained. From 391 BC, they were virtually at war. Aided by the Athenians and the Egyptian king Hakor (Achoris), Evagoras extended his rule over the greater part of Cyprus, crossed over to Asia Minor, took several cities in Phoenicia (including Tyre), and persuaded the Cilicians to revolt.
One result of the Peace of Antalcidas (387 BC), to which Evagoras refused to agree, was that the Athenians withdrew their support, since by its terms they recognized the lordship of Persia over Cyprus. The following years Evagoras carried on hostilities single-handed, except for occasional aid from Egypt, which was likewise threatened by the Persians. While Evagoras was in Egypt asking for help, his younger son Pnytagoras was in charge of Salamis. The Persian generals Tiribazus and Orontes at last invaded Cyprus in 385 BC, with an army far larger than what Evagoras could command. However, Evagoras managed to cut off this force from being resupplied, and the starving troops rebelled. The war then turned in the Persian favor when Evagoras&#x27; fleet was destroyed at the Battle of Citium, and he was compelled to flee to Salamis. Here, although closely blockaded, Evagoras managed to hold his ground, and took advantage of a quarrel between the two Persian generals to conclude peace (376 BC). Evagoras was allowed to remain nominally king of Salamis, but in reality a vassal of Persia, to which he was to pay a yearly tribute. The chronology of the last part of his reign is uncertain. In 374 BC, he was assassinated by a eunuch from motives of private revenge. He was succeeded by his son, Nicocles.

According to Isocrates&#x27;s &quot;Panegyricus&quot;, Evagoras was a model ruler, whose aim was to promote the welfare of his state and of his subjects by the cultivation of Greek refinement and civilization. Isocrates also states that many people migrated from Greece to Cyprus because of the noble rule of Evagoras. Other sources of this periodâDiodorus Siculus 14.115, 15.2-9; Xenophon, &quot;Hellenica&quot; 4.8âare not as unrestrainedly complimentary. Lysias in his &quot;Against Andocides&quot; 6.28 addresses him as the king of Cyprus.

Although Cypriots were Greeks and their language a dialect of Greek, the Arcadocypriot, they used to write in an older and more difficult system, called the Cypriot syllabary. Evagoras has been called a pioneer of the adoption of the Greek alphabet in Cyprus in place of the older Cypriot syllabary.

<text>In ancient Greek philosophy,  () refers to the type of wisdom or intelligence concerned with practical action. It implies good judgment and excellence of character and habits. In Aristotelian ethics, the concept is distinguished from other words for wisdom and intellectual virtues (such as and ) because of its practical character.

==Ancient Greek Philosophy==
===Socrates===
In some of Socrates&#x27; dialogues, he proposes that is a necessary condition for all virtue, and that to be good is to be an intelligent or reasonable person with intelligent and reasonable thoughts. In Plato&#x27;s &quot;Meno&quot;, Socrates writes that is the most important attribute to learn, although it cannot be taught and is instead gained through the understanding of one&#x27;s own self.

===Aristotle===
In the sixth book of Aristotle&#x27;s &quot;Nicomachean Ethics&quot;, he distinguished the concepts of (wisdom) and , and described the relationship between them and other intellectual virtues. He writes that is a combination of , the ability to discern reality, and , things that &quot;could not be otherwise&quot;.He then writes that involves not only the ability to decide how to reach a certain end, but the ability to reflect upon and determine &quot;good ends&quot; as well.

Aristotle also writes that although is higher and more serious than , the pursuit of wisdom and happiness requires both, as facilitates . According to Aristotle&#x27;s theory of rhetoric, is one of the three types of appeals to character ().

Aristotle claims that gaining phronesis requires gaining experience, as he writes:

==Modern Philosophy==
According to philosophers KristjÃ¡nsson, Fowers, Darnell and Pollard, &quot;phronesis&quot; means making decisions in regards to moral events or circumstances. This four-component philosophical account became known as the &quot;Aristotelian Phronesis Model&quot;, or &quot;APM&quot;. There is recent work to return the virtue of practical judgement to overcome disagreements and conflicts in the form of Aristotle&#x27;s &quot;phronesis&quot;.

In Aristotle&#x27;s work, is the intellectual virtue that helps turn one&#x27;s moral instincts into practical action. He writes that moral virtues help any person to achieve the end, and that is what it takes to discover the means to gain that end. Without moral virtues, degenerates into an inability to make practical actions in regards to genuine goods for man.

==In Social Sciences==
In Alasdair MacIntyre&#x27;s book After Virtue, he called for a phronetic social science. He writes that for every prediction made by social scientific theory there are usually counter-examples, meaning that the unpredictability of human beings and human life requires focus on practical experiences.

In psychologist Heiner Rindermann&#x27;s book &quot;Cognitive Capitalism&quot;, he uses the term to describe a rational approach to thinking and acting, &quot;a circumspect and thoughtful way of life in a rational manner&quot;.

Critiques of the &quot;APM&quot;&#x27;s empirical limitations led to McLoughlin, Thoma, and KristjÃ¡nsson developing the &quot;neo-Aristotelian Phronesis Model (neo-APM)&quot;, which refines the construct using contemporary psychometric techniques. This updated model empirically identified ten distinct components and employed network analysis to highlight the interconnectedness and centrality of key elements, such as aspired moral identity and moral deliberation. The neo-APM thus provides a more nuanced and empirically valid framework for understanding practical wisdom in psychological and educational contexts.

<text>A sequin () is a small, typically shiny, generally disk-shaped ornament.

Sequins are also referred to as paillettes, spangles, or &quot;diamantÃ©&quot; (also spelled &quot;diamante&quot;). Although the words sequins, paillettes, lentejuelas, and spangles can be used interchangeably, &quot;diamantÃ©&quot; (literally &quot;set with diamonds&quot;) is both an adjective and a plural-only noun, which specifically refers to diamond-shaped sequins and can also be used to mean &quot;artificial diamonds&quot;, which serve the same purpose as sequins.

In costuming, sequins have a center hole, while spangles have the hole located at the top. Paillettes are typically very large and flat. Sequins may be stitched flat to the fabric, so they do not move, and are less likely to fall off; or they may be stitched at only one point, so they dangle and move easily, catching more light. Some sequins are made with multiple facets, to increase their reflective ability, while others are stamped out with lobes resembling flower petals.

== Etymology ==
The name &quot;sequin&quot; originates from the Venetian colloquial noun (), meaning a Venetian ducat coin, rendered into French as (). The ducat stopped being minted after the Napoleonic invasion of Italy, and the name sequin was falling out of use in its original sense. It was then that the name was taken up in France to designate what it means today, as 19th century sequins were made of shiny metal.

==History==
Historically across many parts of the world, attaching metal coins and ornaments to clothes was done to display wealth or status or to keep the item tightly secured.

Sequins made with nautilus shell were found dating back 12,000 years in Indonesia. Evidence exists that gold sequins were being used as decoration on clothing or paraphernalia in the Indus Valley as early as 2500 BC, during the Kot Diji phase. Solid gold sequins sewn into royal garments were found inside the tomb of Tutankhamun.

By the 17th century, the modern sequin consisting of a small thin metal disk, known as spangle, appeared in Europe. These were made by punching out the desired shape from a thin metal sheet. Spangles (mainly made out of reflective bits of metals) sewn into jackets, bonnets, and dresses were popular among the european nobility and upper class from the 17th to 19th centuries.

During the Edwardian era, the usage of spangles became increasingly popular and haute-couture designers like Callot Soeurs designed evening dresses fully covered in sequins, often times using sequins of different colors to form intricate patterns.

During the 1920s, after the discovery of the Tomb of Tutankhamun, sequins witnessed renewed popularity as a consequence of Egyptomania. The usage of sequins (typically made out of metal) was widely popularized as a fashion statement by flapper girls during this period.

In the 1930s, lightweight electroplated gelatin sequins were produced, which were significantly less heavy than their metal counterparts. However, the gelatin sequins would melt if they got wet or too warm. Algy Trimmings Co. (an apparel manufacturing company), working with Kodak, produced clear plastic sequins, although it often suffered from brittleness. Polyester film was later used to surround the plastic sequin to safely wash it. Eventually, vinyl plastic mostly replaced film and clear plastic because of its durability and cost effectiveness.

In the late 1960s, sequins began to be widely used by popular musicians such as The Supremes. Sequins continued to be popular into the 1970s and early 1980s.

For example, she is called the &quot;Nana Bukuu&quot; among the Yoruba people and the &quot;Olisabuluwa&quot; among Igbo people but described differently, with some actively worshiping her while some do not worship her and worship the gods originating from her.

In Dahomey mythology, Nana Buluku is the mother supreme creator who gave birth to the moon spirit Mawu, the sun spirit Lisa, and all of the universe. After giving birth to these, she retired and left the matters of the world to Mawu-Lisa. She is the primary creator, Mawu-Lisa the secondary creator, and the theology based on these is called Vodun, Voodoo or Vodoun.

According to Maya Deren, some Vodouwizan believe that Nanan-bouclou is both male and female.

==Observance==
===Africa===
The Vodoun religion of the Fon people has four overlapping elements: public gods, personal or private gods, ancestral spirits, and magic or charms. In this traditional religion of West Africa, creation starts with a female supreme being called Nana Buluku, who gave birth to Mawu and Lisa and created the universe. After giving birth, the mother supreme retired and left everything to Mawu-Lisa (Moon-Sun, female-male), deities, spirits, and inert universe. Mawu-Lisa created numerous minor imperfect deities. In Fon belief, the feminine deity Mawu had to work with the trickster Legba and the snake Aido Hwedo to create living beings, a method of creation that imbued the good, the bad, and a destiny for every creature including human beings. Only by appeasing lesser deities and Legba, in Fon theology, can one change that destiny. This appeasing requires rituals and offerings to the lesser gods and ancestral spirits, who are believed to have the ability to do favors for human beings.

=== Americas ===
As millions of West Africans were captured and enslaved during the colonial era, then shipped across the Atlantic to work on sugarcane, cotton, and tobacco plantations, they brought with them their religious ideas, including those about Nana Buluku. She is celebrated as &quot;NanÃ£&quot; in CandomblÃ© JejÃ© and Tambor de Mina and as &quot;Nana BurukÃº&quot; in CandomblÃ© Ketu, where she is pictured as a very old woman, older than creation itself. She is found in French, Dutch, and British West Indies in particular, such as among the African heritage communities of French Guiana, Suriname, Guyana, Brazil, Trinidad, Martinique, Haiti, and other Caribbean islands.

==Other info==
* There is a song that was made in the Tamil language with the title &quot;Nana Buluku&quot; (Youtube) and was shown in the movie &quot;Pichaikaran 2&quot; released in the year 2023. The lyrics also mention Nana Buluku as a god and refer to the dancer having a friendship with the god.

<text>Lady Macbeth of the Mtsensk District (, &quot;Ledi Makbet Mtsenskogo uyezda&quot;) is an 1865 novella by Nikolai Leskov. It was originally published in Fyodor Dostoyevsky&#x27;s magazine &quot;Epoch&quot;.

Among its themes are the subordinate role expected from women in 19th-century European society, adultery, provincial life (thus drawing comparison with Flaubert&#x27;s &quot;Madame Bovary&quot;) and the planning of murder by a woman, hence it having a title inspired by the Shakespearean character Lady Macbeth from his play &quot;Macbeth&quot;, and echoing the title of Turgenev&#x27;s story &quot;Hamlet of the Shchigrovsky District&quot; (1859).

==Plot summary==
;Chapter 1
The Ismailov family is introduced: Boris, the father of Zinovy, the husband of Katarina Lvovna for the past five years. Boris and Zinovy are merchants, ruling an estate with many serfs. Katerina is bored in their empty home, and tired of Boris&#x27; constant orders and scolding of her for not producing any children. She would actually welcome a child, and Zinovy&#x27;s previous wife of twenty years fared no better.

;Chapter 2
A dam bursts at a mill owned by Boris, and Zinovy leaves town to oversee its repair. Aksinya, the female cook, and Sergei, a newly arrived farmhand, are introduced. Katerina flirts somewhat innocently with Sergei. Aksinya tells Katerina, who has become bored enough to venture out amongst the peasants, of Sergei&#x27;s reputation as a womanizer.

;Chapter 3
Sergei comes into Katerina&#x27;s room, and after some dialogue about romance, moves to kiss her roughly. She protests at first, but then gives in; after an implied sexual encounter, she tells Sergei to leave because Boris will be coming by to lock her door. He stays, saying he can use the window instead.

;Chapter 4
After a week of the continued affair, Boris catches Sergei and accuses him of adultery. Sergei will neither admit nor deny it, so Boris whips him until his own arm hurts from the exertion, and locks Sergei in a cellar. Katerina seems to come alive from her boredom, but Boris threatens to beat her as well when she asks for Sergei&#x27;s release.

;Chapter 5
Katerina poisons Boris by putting arsenical rat poison in a dish of mushrooms and kasha, and he is buried in the absence of his son - without incurring suspicion, because many have died from mistaking poisonous mushrooms for edible ones. She then takes charge of the estate and begins to order people around, openly being around Sergei every day.

;Chapter 6
Katerina has a strange dream about a cat. Some dialogue occurs with Sergei, which by its end reveals his worry over Zinovy&#x27;s return and desire to marry her.

;Chapter 7
Katerina again dreams of the cat, which this time has Boris&#x27;s head rather than a cat&#x27;s. Zinovy returns and takes some time to get around to confronting Katerina with what he has heard about her affair. Finally she calls Sergei in, kisses him in front of her husband, some violence occurs, and the two of them strangle Zinovy.

;Chapter 8
Zinovy dies, and Sergei buries him deep in the walls of the cellar where he himself had been kept.

;Chapter 9
Some convenient circumstances regarding Zinovy&#x27;s return shroud his disappearance in mystery, and while there is an inquiry, nothing is found and no trouble comes to Sergei or Katerina. The latter becomes pregnant. Everything seems to be working out for them, until Boris&#x27;s young nephew Fyodor shows up with his mother, preventing Katerina from inheriting the estate. She has no problem with this and actually makes an effort to be a good aunt, but Sergei complains repeatedly for a time about their misfortune.

;Chapter 10
Fyodor falls ill, and Katerina, while tending to him, has a change of heart because of Sergei&#x27;s earlier complaints.

;Chapter 11
Katerina and Sergei suffocate the boy, but a crowd returning from church storms the house, one of its members having spied the act through the shutters of Fyodor&#x27;s room. Sergei, hearing the windows clattering from the crowd&#x27;s fists, thinks the ghosts of his murder victims have come back to haunt him, and breaks down.

;Chapter 12
Sergei admits to the crime publicly and, in repentance, also tells of where Zinovy is buried and admits to that crime as well. Katerina indifferently admits that she helped with the murders, saying it was all for Sergei. The two are sent to exile in Siberia. During their journey there, Katerina gives birth in a prison hospital, and wants nothing to do with their child.

;Chapter 13
The child is sent to be raised by Fyodor&#x27;s mother and becomes heir to the Ismailov estate. Katerina continues to be obsessed with Sergei, who increasingly wants nothing to do with her. Fiona and &quot;little Sonya,&quot; two members of the prison convoy with Katerina and Sergei, are introduced, the former being known for being sexually prolific, the latter the opposite.

;Chapter 14
Sergei is caught by Katerina being intimate with Fiona. Katerina is mortified, but seeing Fiona&#x27;s indifference to the whole situation, reaches something approaching cordiality with Fiona by writing her off. Sergei then pursues little Sonya, who will not sleep with him unless he gives her a pair of stockings. He then complains to Katerina about his ankle-cuffs. She, being happy that he is talking to her again, readily gives him her last pair of new stockings to ease his pain, which he then gives to Sonya in return for sexual favours.

;Chapter 15
Katerina sees Sonya wearing her stockings; she spits in Sergei&#x27;s eyes, and shoves him. He promises revenge, and later breaks into her cell with another man, giving her fifty lashes with a rope, while her cell-mate Sonya giggles in the background. Katerina, broken, lets Fiona console her, and realizes that she is no better than Fiona, which is her breaking-point: after that she is emotionless. On the road in the prison convoy, Sergei and Sonya together mock Katerina. Sonya offers her stockings to her for sale. Sergei reminisces about both their courtship and their murders in the same airy manner. Fiona and an old man in the convoy, Gordyushka, defend Katerina, but to no avail. The convoy arrives at a river and boards a ferry, and Katerina, repeating some phrases similar to Sergei&#x27;s feigned nostalgia for their life at the estate, sets upon Sonya; they both end up in the river after Katerina has seen the faces of Boris, Zinovy, and Fyodor in the water. The two women briefly resurface, still alive, but Katerina grabs Sonya, and they both drown.

<text>Saint Mirin was born in 565, is also known as Mirren of Benchor (now called Bangor), Merinus, Merryn and MeadhrÃ¡n. The patron saint of the town and Roman Catholic diocese of Paisley, Scotland, he was the founder of a religious community which grew to become Paisley Abbey. The shrine of this saint in the abbey became a centre of pilgrimage.

A contemporary of the better known Columba of Iona and disciple of Saint Comgall, he was prior of Bangor Abbey in County Down, Ireland before making his missionary voyage to Scotland. 

==History and legend==

Much of what is known about Mirin is difficult to separate from fable. However, it is believed that he was of noble birth. While still a young boy, his mother took him to the monastery of Bangor Abbey in County Down in the north east of Ireland, where he was placed under the care of St. Comgall. St Mirin later took oversight of the monastery and thus became the prior of Bangor Abbey, where he accepted visitors and sojourners.

Later, St Mirin travelled to the camp of the High King of Ireland with the purpose of spreading the Christian faith. Having heard of Mirin&#x27;s arrival, the king refused to allow him to enter the camp. Mirin, thus slighted, was said to have prayed to God that the king might feel his wife&#x27;s labour pangs, her time being near. The legend continues that, just as Mirin had prayed, the king fell ill and roared in pain for three days and nights. In desperation, the king sought out Mirin and granted him all he wished, including the right to go out and preach the Gospel to the men of his camp. In response to these concessions, Mirin prayed on his behalf and he was freed from his pain.

Around 580, he was appointed to the west of Scotland and, after a long and difficult journey, arrived where the town of Paisley now stands. The area had recently been abandoned by the Romans and was in the possession of a powerful local chieftain. This chief took a liking to Mirin and the saint was allotted a small field near the river in the southern part of town. This plot was called St Mirin&#x27;s Croft. He founded the first church in Paisley, thought to be at Seedhill and, after his death, the shrine of Saint Mirin became a centre of pilgrimage.

In various charters and Papal Bulls, Mirin is referred to as &quot;The glorious confessor, Saint Mirin&quot;. His image was engraved on the seal of the Abbey, depicting him in the vestments of a bishop. Around the seal was inscribed the prayer &quot;O Mirin, pray for your servants&quot;. In King James IV&#x27;s Charter of 1488 raising Paisley to the status of burgh of barony, one of the reasons cited was &quot;the singular respect we have for the glorious confessor, Saint Mirin&quot;.

==Mirin in modern Scotland==

There is a chapel within Paisley Abbey dedicated to Mirin containing a sculptured stone frieze depicting the life of the saint. The Roman Catholic St Mirin&#x27;s Cathedral is also named in his honour. St Mirren F.C., a football club from Paisley, is named after him. The St Mirin Burn flows into the White Cart Water close to the town centre. He is also commemorated by St Mirren Street which links Paisley Cross to Causeyside Street.

Since the closure of St Mirin&#x27;s and St Margaret&#x27;s High School (formerly St Mirin&#x27;s Academy) in 2001, there has been no school in the town dedicated to the saint. However, there is a St Mirin&#x27;s Primary School in the Simshill area of the neighbouring city of Glasgow.

Elsewhere in Scotland, the island of Inchmurrin (i.e. Mirin&#x27;s Island) in Loch Lomond and a farm called Knockmurran (i.e. Mirin&#x27;s Hill) near Coylton in Ayrshire are named after him. St Mirin&#x27;s Well can be found near Kilsyth in Stirlingshire.

==Statue==
A pedestal of blond sandstone, designed by landscape architect Daniel McKendry, bearing the inscription taken from the Aberdeen Breviary &quot;At Length Full of Sanctity and Miracles, Mirin Slept in the Lord at Paisley&quot; was erected in 2003 opposite St Mirin&#x27;s Cathedral at the junction of Incle Street, Gauze Street and Glasgow Road in Paisley. 

A bronze statue of the saint was mounted on the pedestal and was unveiled on the saint&#x27;s day, 15 September 2007, by the Provost of Renfrewshire Councillor Celia Lawson in the presence of the Bishop of Paisley the Rt Rev Philip Tartaglia, the Minister of Paisley Abbey the Rt Rev Alan Birss, the Rt Hon Douglas Alexander MP, Jim Sheridan MP, Hugh Henry MSP, the Deputy Lord Lieutenant of Renfrewshire James Wardrop and the sculptor Norman Galbraith. The erection and unveiling of the statue were co-ordinated by Daniel McKendry on behalf of the Mirin Project.

<text>George Dekle Busbee Sr. (August 7, 1927 â July 16, 2004) was an American politician who served as the 77th governor of Georgia from 1975 to 1983.

==Early life==
Born in Vienna, Georgia, Busbee attended Georgia Military College and Abraham Baldwin Agricultural College before joining the U.S. Navy. After his discharge, he completed his education at the University of Georgia and its School of Law in Athens, where he was a member of the Phi Delta Theta fraternity and the Phi Kappa Literary Society, having procured a bachelor&#x27;s degree in 1949 and a law degree in 1952.

==Political life==
Establishing a law practice in Albany, Busbee served nine terms in the Georgia House of Representatives and was floor leader for Governor Carl Sanders. In 1967, Busbee was one of thirty Democrats in the legislature who voted for the Republican Howard Callaway in the disputed 1966 gubernatorial race, rather than the Democratic nominee Lester Maddox, a segregationist from Atlanta. The legislature, acting under the 1824 Georgia Constitution, upheld by the United States Supreme Court, chose Maddox 182 to 66.

In 1974, Busbee won the Democratic nomination for governor in Jimmy Carter&#x27;s final year in that office. In the party runoff, he defeated, 551,106 (59.9 percent) to 369,608 (40.1 percent), former governor and sitting Lieutenant Governor Lester Maddox, the man whom Busbee had voted against in the legislative election for governor some seven years earlier. In the fall of 1974, Busbee handily defeated Ronnie Thompson, the first Republican to have served as mayor of Macon.

Two years later voters approved a wholesale revision of the Georgia Constitution. As a result of these changes, Busbee became the state&#x27;s first governor to serve two consecutive four-year terms. Lt. Gov. Zell Miller, who wanted to run for governor in 1978, opposed the constitutional amendment, but it was carried anyway. Busbee won election to his second term in 1978 with an easy victory over Republican Rodney Cook of Atlanta.

==Personal life==
After his service as governor, Busbee joined the Atlanta law firm King &amp; Spalding and moved to the Atlanta suburb of Duluth.

Busbee was married to the former Mary Elizabeth &quot;Mary Beth&quot; Talbot (1927â2012), originally from Ruston in north Louisiana. The sixth child of a country physician, Dr. and Mrs. B. H. Talbot, she graduated from Louisiana Tech University with a Bachelor of Science degree in biological sciences and also did graduate work in pathology at Charity Hospital in New Orleans. She moved to Georgia to work as a medical technician at Athens General Hospital in Athens, where she met George Busbee, then a law student. In 1952, they relocated to Albany, where they remained until his inauguration as governor in January 1975. As First Lady of Georgia, Mrs. Busbee was known for her emphasis on volunteerism. In 1985, she co-authored a cookbook, &quot;Guess Who&#x27;s Coming to Dinner,&quot; about favorite recipes and guests served at the governor&#x27;s mansion during her eight years there. Mrs. Busbee was a 40-year cancer survivor.

The Busbees had four children, Beth Kindt and husband John, Jan Curtis and husband Carlton, George D. Busbee, Jr., and wife Tammy, and Jeff Busbee and wife Kelly. After the governorship, the Busbees started a church in their Duluth home. That congregation is now the Parkway Baptist Church.

==Death and legacy==
Busbee died of a heart attack on July 16, 2004, at the Savannah International Airport in Savannah. George Busbee Parkway and Busbee Drive in the Town Center Area Community Improvement District of Cobb County are named in his honor, as is Busbee Hall at the University of Georgia and the Busbee Center at Gwinnett Technical College.

<text>Golden West Airlines was a commuter airline that operated flights on a high volume schedule in California. It ceased operations in 1983.

== History ==
The original Golden West Airlines, headquartered at Van Nuys, California, was founded in 1968 and operated out of Terminal 4 at Los Angeles International Airport with a fleet of de Havilland Canada DHC-6 Twin Otter STOL capable turboprops and at least one HFB 320 Hansa Jet aircraft, serving Pomona, Riverside, Santa Ana, and Ventura. This airline ceased operations on March 11, 1969.

Aero Commuter, was founded in December 1967 by architect William Pereira, whose son was one of the founders of Air California. Aero Commuter was, in fact, briefly known as Air California Commuter. and based in Long Beach, operated flights between Long Beach, Los Angeles International Airport (LAX), Avalon, Burbank, and Fullerton. Aero Commuter operated de Havilland Canada DHC-6 Twin Otter STOL capable aircraft. It also acquired Catalina Air Lines which had been founded in 1953 as Avalon Air Transport. By 1968 service had expanded to include Apple Valley, Bakersfield, El Monte, Ontario, Oceanside, Palm Springs, Palmdale, San Diego, and Santa Ana. In 1969, it merged with Skymark Airlines (a Sacramento-based charter and commuter airline founded in February 1968 that also operated the DHC-6 Twin Otter) and Cable Commuter Airlines (an Upland general aviation concern based at Cable Airport that had entered the scheduled commuter airline business in 1968 via a hub at Los Angeles International Airport (LAX) with flights to such southern California destinations to Burbank, Colton, Inyokern, Ontario, Oxnard, Palmdale, Palm Springs, Santa Ana (Orange County Airport), Santa Barbara and Santa Maria as well as service to Lake Havasu City in Arizona with all flights operated with DHC-6 Twin Otter aircraft). Upon the demise of the original Golden West Airlines (see above) in early 1969, Aero Commuter acquired several assets from Golden West, including its name. Golden West also briefly operated jet service with the HFB 320 Hansa Jet, a West German manufactured business jet configured with ten passenger seats which the airline flew in scheduled service from Burbank Airport (BUR, now Bob Hope Airport) to Santa Barbara (SBA) and Palm Springs (PSP) in 1969.

As Golden West Airlines it continued to expand aggressively through the 1970s, adding service to San Francisco (SFO), Oakland, Bakersfield, Fresno, Oxnard, Santa Rosa, Merced, Modesto, Monterey, San Jose, Stockton and other smaller airportsâmany of which no longer have commercial serviceâsuch as Van Nuys Airport, Fullerton Municipal Airport, and the Airport in the Sky on Santa Catalina Island. In 1971 it attempted to acquire Los Angeles Airways, a local helicopter commuter airline, but the deal fell through. Golden West did acquire Catalina Air Lines, a seaplane operator that served Catalina Island off the coast of southern California with the Grumman G-21 Goose. These Grumman amphibious aircraft were operated as Catalina Golden West which was a division of Golden West.

Because of California&#x27;s growth and tourist appeal, Golden West was able to become an interline partner with a number of domestic and international airlines. According to the January 1, 1973 Golden West system timetable, these airlines included Aer Lingus, AerolÃ­neas Argentinas, AeromÃ©xico, Air Canada, Air France, Alaska Airlines, Allegheny Airlines, Aloha Airlines, American, Braniff International, Continental Airlines, Delta, Eastern, Finnair, Frontier Airlines, Hawaiian Airlines, Hughes Airwest, Japan Airlines (JAL), Lufthansa, National Airlines, Northeast Airlines, Ozark Air Lines, Pan American World Airways (Pan Am), Piedmont Airlines, Scandinavian Airlines System (SAS), Southern Airways, Trans World Airlines (TWA), United Airlines, Western Airlines, Wien Air Alaska and other air carriers.

By the early 1980s, Golden West was the largest commuter airline in California operating a high frequency shuttle schedule between LAX and Santa Barbara and San Diego. In 1981, Golden West was the only air carrier flying nonstop between Santa Barbara and LAX with up to fourteen round trip flights a day. Its fleet had grown to include larger aircraft such as the Short 330 and de Havilland Canada DHC-7 Dash 7. The 50-passenger seat Dash 7 was the largest aircraft ever operated by the airline. A huge debt service, among other factors, drove Golden West Airlines out of business in April 1983.

In 2000, Pinnacle Air Charter, Inc. acquired the Air Carrier Certificate for Golden West Airlines. It ultimately operated again, under the DBA of Pinnacle Air Charter, and later, Platinum Air Charter, Inc., conducting on-demand air charter and air ambulance operations under FAR Part 135. Its base of operations was located at Pomona&#x27;s Brackett Field, and conducted flight operations primarily out of San Bernardino International Airport. It suspended operations and closed in 2007.

== Fleet ==
The Golden West fleet consisted of the following aircraft models and quantities.

* 4 â Beechcraft Model 99 Airliner 
* 27 â de Havilland Canada DHC-6 Twin Otter 
* 5 â de Havilland Canada DHC-7 Dash 7

<doc id="839074" wikidata="Q7567980" url="?curid=839074" title="Mernda line">
<text>The Mernda line is a commuter railway line on the Melbourne metropolitan railway network serving the city of Melbourne in Victoria, Australia. Operated by Metro Trains Melbourne, the line is coloured red and is one of the two lines that constitute the Clifton Hill group. It is the city&#x27;s eighth longest metropolitan railway line at . The line runs from Flinders Street station in central Melbourne to Mernda station in the north, serving 29 stations via Clifton Hill, Reservoir, Epping, and South Morang.

The line operates for approximately 19 hours a day (from approximately 5:00 am to around 12:00 am) with 24-hour service available on Friday and Saturday nights. During peak hour, headways of up to 7.5 minutes are operated with services every 10â30 minutes during off-peak hours. Trains on the Mernda line run with two three-car formations of X&#x27;Trapolis 100 trainsets.

Services on the line began in 1889 when the section between North Fitzroy (on the now-closed Inner Circle line) and Reservoir was opened, which was extended to Whittlesea in the same year. The line was closed beyond Lalor in November 1959, while the remainder of the line was electrified. The closed section has since been gradually reconstructed and reopened; to Epping in 1964, South Morang in April 2012, and to Mernda in August 2018.

Since the 2010s, due to the heavily utilised infrastructure of the Mernda line, significant improvements and upgrades have been made. Two major upgrades of the corridor have taken place, with the line from Epping extended to South Morang in April 2012, duplicated between Keon Park and Epping, and extended again to Mernda in August 2018. Other works have included replacing sleepers, upgrading signalling technology, the introduction of new rolling stock, the removal of level crossings, and station accessibility upgrades.

== History ==

=== 19th century ===
The early beginning of the Mernda line opened on 8 October 1889, as part of railway extensions into the northern suburbs. What became known as the Inner Circle line was opened from Spencer Street station (now Southern Cross station) via Royal Park station, to a station called Collingwood (now called Victoria Park), and then on to Heidelberg. The Epping line branched off at Fitzroy North to Preston-Reservoir station (later renamed Reservoir) in 1889, with the line extended to Whittlesea a few months later, on 23 December.

=== 20th century ===

Trains on the line operated via Fitzroy and the Inner Circle, until the opening of the current connection between Victoria Park and Princes Bridge stations in 1901. Passenger services were operated in two tiers: a local train to Preston-Reservoir station via Clifton Hill, and a country-bound mixed train to Whittlesea, via Fitzroy. The Epping line was electrified to Reservoir in 1921, with an AEC railmotor providing a shuttle service between Reservoir and the terminus at Whittlesea. Preston-Reservoir station was renamed Reservoir in 1909.

The line had a number of Rail Motor Stopping Places along the line, these being a mere nameboard beside the railway line at a public access point. The first were RMSP 8, 9, and 10, which opened on 10 May 1927; followed by Epping Quarries Siding RMSP in January 1928; RMSP 17 in March 1928; RMSP 26 in January 1930; RMSP 33 in July 1932; RMSP 39 in July 1941; and RMSP 77 in October 1949, which was renamed Lalor station in 1952. Direct trains to Whittlesea from Flinders and Spencer streets were withdrawn from 1948.

Electrification was extended along of single track to Thomastown in 1929, paid for by a land developer, who paid for the works, as well as guaranteeing against operating losses. Keon Park station was opened at the same time, but the Whittlesea shuttle train continued to connect with suburban trains at Reservoir, until 1931. Goods trains to Whittlesea were withdrawn in 1955, and goods trains from Epping ended in 1958.

Electric suburban services were extended to Lalor station in November 1959, in addition to the duplication of the line from Reservoir to Keon Park, services beyond this point (to Whittlesea) were replaced by a bus service, subsequently closing the remaining section of the line. The line to Epping itself was reopened and electrified in 1964, with the remaining line dismantled in the 1970s. However, the right-of-way beyond Epping was retained to allow future expansion of the rail corridor.

=== 21st century ===

==== South Morang extension ====
Proposals for the duplication of the line between Keon Park and Epping have dated as far back as 1974. In 1983, Whittlesea Council made a submission to the Victorian Government supporting the duplication of the line. Following the election of the Bracks Government in 1999, a promise was made to restore the service to South Morang, along the former right-of-way by 2003. In 2003, a &quot;Trainlink&quot; bus service was introduced from Epping to South Morang, meeting every train, but the 2005 Meeting Our Transport Challenges plan postponed construction of the railway until 2021. The restoration of the railway to Mernda was also identified in the Strategic Transportation Study, undertaken by the City of Whittlesea in 2002. In the 2008 State Budget, $10 million was earmarked for planning work on the four-kilometre extension, in addition, to design work for the duplication between Keon Park and Epping stations. 

On 1 May 2009, the State Government announced that they had committed $562.3 million in the 2009 State Budget for the extension of the line to South Morang, covering capital and construction works. Construction would begin the following year in 2010 and was to be completed by 2013. Major construction commenced in October 2010, with works including:

* The duplication of the of existing single track between Keon Park and Epping
* The construction of of new double track from Epping to South Morang
* A rebuilt South Morang station with a bus interchange, 450 car parking spaces, and 29 protected bike spaces
* A rebuilt Thomastown station with a second platform and a pedestrian overpass
* Newly built Epping station
* The upgrade and expansion of the Epping train maintenance facility
* The construction of a new shared use path between Epping and South Morang

The double track between Keon Park and Epping was commissioned on 28 November 2011. A shared use path was opened to the public on 5 February 2012. The three-metre wide path runs the length of the rail extension and provides connections between the existing bicycle network, through to South Morang station. Finally, the extension to South Morang opened on 2 April 2012. No level crossings were built on the new section of the track, with road overpasses provided at Cooper Street, Pindari Avenue, and Civic Drive.

==== Mernda extension ====

Proposals for an extension to Mernda have dated as far back as 1974. In 1983, Whittlesea Council made a submission to the Victorian Government to extend the Epping line to South Morang and Mernda. After many years of extensive community activism, the Andrews government announced in the 2015 State Budget that $9 million was to be allocated to plan the extension of the line to Mernda, with construction commencing in 2016. The announcement included:

* The line to be fully double tracked
* Completely grade separated through a combination of rail bridges and underpasses, with more than 86% of the rail line being built at ground level
* The construction of two new stations (Mernda and Middle Gorge) with an option for an additional one (Hawkstowe) (all three were constructed)&quot;&quot;
** All three stations included bike and car parking as well as bus interchanges
* A new shared use path, connecting to the one constructed at South Morang as part of the South Morang rail extension

Construction began in 2016, with the stations opening six months early on 26 August 2018.&quot;&quot; Prior to the lines official opening, a community open day was held to promote the new stations to the local residents.

== Future ==

=== Level Crossing Removals ===

The Level Crossing Removal Project has removed 6 level crossings on the line, completed in stages from 2019 to 2024. In 2019, the level crossing at High Street, Reservoir was removed by building a rail bridge over the road, along with Reservoir station being rebuilt. In 2022, Bell station and Preston station were both rebuilt with an elevated rail bridge connecting them to remove four crossings, one each at Bell Street, Cramer Street, Murray Road, and Oakover Road. The level crossing at Keon Parade was removed in 2024 by constructing a rail bridge over the road and rebuilding Keon Park station. The Mernda line has 12 remaining level crossings that are not yet proposed for removal.

=== Melbourne Metro 2 ===
The 2012 Network Development Plan identified the need for a new tunnel connecting the Mernda line to the Werribee line and possibly also the Geelong line. The tunnel would run from Clifton Hill, potentially include a new stop somewhere in the inner north, before connecting with Parkville, Flagstaff, and Southern Cross stations. Exiting the CBD, the line would continue in a tunnel stopping at a new station in the suburb of Fishermans Bend, before crossing underneath the Yarra River and arriving at Newport station. The line would then exit the tunnel and travel further west to connect with the Werribee and Geelong lines. The Werribee and Williamstown lines would be reconfigured to provide better and simpler service. This project was initially meant to be completed in the 2020s, however, no funding or planning has taken place, with the revised Victorian Rail Plan stating that the project would be completed under Stage 6 of the plan.

=== Wollert extension ===
Highlighted in the 2018 Victorian Rail Plan, a proposal exists for a spur line to be constructed to the suburb of Wollert, at a cost of up to $300 million. The line would branch off the Mernda line after Lalor station, with new stations at the Pacific Epping shopping centre, and in the suburbs of Epping, Aurora and Wollert. In addition to the new stations, the corridor would be fully grade separated from opening, with the line featuring two tracks, and modern, fully wheelchair accessible stations. In 2017, the State Government announced the acquisition of 6 properties valued at $3.8 million for a future rail corridor. The $3.8 million was sourced from a &#x27;statewide developers&#x27; contribution fund. Since the 2017 acquisitions, there has been little planning developments, with only a small amount of attention given by the local residents, council, and some political parties.

== Network and operations ==

=== Services ===
Services on the Mernda line operate from approximately 5:00 am to around 12:00 am daily. In general, during peak hours, train frequency is 7â10 minutes in the AM peak on the Mernda line while during non-peak hours the frequency is reduced to 20â30 minutes throughout the entire route. Frequencies are doubled between Flinders Street and Clifton Hill in conjunction with the Hurstbridge line. On Friday nights and weekends, services run 24 hours a day, with 60-minute frequencies available outside of normal operating hours.

Train services on the Mernda line are also subjected to maintenance and renewal works, usually on selected Fridays and Saturdays. Shuttle bus services are provided throughout the duration of work for affected commuters.

==== Stopping patterns ====

=== Operators ===
The Mernda line has had a total of 6 operators since its opening in 1888. The majority of operations throughout its history have been government-run: from its first service in 1888 until the 1999 privatisation of Melbourne&#x27;s rail network, four different government operators have run the line. These operators, Victorian Railways, the Metropolitan Transit Authority, the Public Transport Corporation and Hillside Trains have a combined operational length of 111 years. Hillside Trains was privatised in August 1999 and later rebranded Connex Melbourne. Metro Trains Melbourne, the current private operator, then took over the operations in 2009. Both private operators have had a combined operational period of years.
=== Route ===

The Mernda line forms a relatively linear route from the Melbourne central business district to its terminus in Mernda. The route is long and is double track the entire way from Flinders Street to its termnius. The only underground section of the Mernda line is in the City Loop, where the service stops at 3 underground stations. Exiting the city, the Mernda line traverses mainly flat country with few curves and fairly minimal earthworks for most of the line. Despite the otherwise fairly straight line, it does include Melbourne&#x27;s sharpest railway curve, between Rushall and Merri. This curve originally made up the third side of a triangular junction, connecting the two original branches from the now-closed North Fitzroy station. Only this third leg of the triangle remains. Some sections of the line has been elevated or lowered into a cutting to eliminate level crossings. Despite some removals, there are a number of level crossings still present with no current plans to remove them.

The line follows the same alignment as the Hurstbridge line with the two services splitting onto different routes at Clifton Hill. The Mernda line continues on its northern alignment, whereas the Hurstbridge line takes a north-eastern alignment towards its final destination of Hurstbridge station. Most of the rail line goes through built-up suburbs and some industrial areas, but after Middle Gorge, the line gets into more sporadic suburbs and park lands. This outer portion of the line is one of Melbourne&#x27;s main growth corridors, which is rapidly replacing farmland with housing and commercial developments causing a rise in patronage.

=== Stations ===
The line serves 29 stations across of track. The stations are a mix of elevated, lowered, underground, and ground-level designs. Underground stations are present only in the City Loop, with the majority of elevated and lowered stations being constructed as part of level crossing removals or line extension projects. From 2025, Keon Park station will be elevated as part of level crossing removal works.

== Infrastructure ==

=== Rolling stock ===

The Mernda line uses X&#x27;Trapolis 100 electric multiple unit (EMU) trains operating in a two three-car configuration, with three doors per side on each carriage, and can accommodate up to 432 seated passengers in each six-car configuration. The trains were originally built between 2002 and 2004 as well as between 2009 and 2020 with a total of 212 three-car sets constructed. The trains are shared with 7 other metropolitan train lines and have been in service since 2003.

Alongside the passenger trains, Mernda line tracks and equipment are maintained by a fleet of engineering trains. The four types of engineering trains are: the shunting train; designed for moving trains along non-electrified corridors and for transporting other maintenance locomotives, for track evaluation; designed for evaluating track and its condition, the overhead inspection train; designed for overhead wiring inspection, and the infrastructure evaluation carriage designed for general infrastructure evaluation. Most of these trains are repurposed locomotives previously used by V/Line, Metro Trains, and the Southern Shorthaul Railroad.

=== Accessibility ===

In compliance with the Disability Discrimination Act of 1992, all stations that are new-built or rebuilt are fully accessible and comply with these guidelines. Just over half of the stations on the corridor are fully accessible, however, some stations haven&#x27;t been upgraded to meet these guidelines. These stations do feature ramps, however, they have a gradient greater than 1 in 14. Stations that are fully accessible feature ramps that have a gradient less than 1 in 14, have at-grade paths, or feature lifts. These stations typically also feature tactile boarding indicators, independent boarding ramps, wheelchair accessible myki barriers, hearing loops, and widened paths.

Projects improving station accessibility have included the Level Crossing Removal Project, which involves station rebuilds and upgrades, and individual station upgrade projects. These works have made significant strides in improving network accessibility, with more than 67% of Mernda line stations classed as fully accessible. Future station upgrade projects will continue to increase the number of fully accessible stations overtime.

=== Signalling ===
The Mernda line uses three-position signalling which is widely used across the Melbourne train network. Three-position signalling was first introduced on the line in 1921, with the final section of the line converted to the new type of signalling during the extension of the line to Mernda in 2018.

<text>Meghnad Saha (6 October 1893 â 16 February 1956) was an Indian astrophysicist who helped devise the theory of thermal ionisation. His Saha ionisation equation allowed astronomers to accurately relate the spectral classes of stars to their actual temperatures.

==Biography==
Meghnad Saha was born on 6 October 1893 to a Teli Bengali Hindu family in the village of Sheoratali in Gazipur, then part of the Dacca district of the Bengal Presidency (now Bangladesh. He was the fifth of eight children born to Jagannath Saha, a poor shopkeeper, and his wife, Bhubaneshwari Devi. Due to the superstitious religious ideologies of the orthodox haughty Brahmins of the time and his childhood and career experiences of casteism, Saha developed a hatred for Hinduism from a young age.

During his youth, he was forced to leave Dhaka Collegiate School because he participated in the Swadeshi movement. After that he joined K. L. Jubilee High School &amp; College. He earned his Indian School Certificate from Dhaka College. He was also a student at the Presidency College, Kolkata and Rajabazar Science College CU. Saha faced discrimination from other students due to his caste; when he was at the Eden Hindu Hostel, communal students objected to him eating in the same dining hall as them.

He was a professor at Allahabad University from 1923 to 1938, and thereafter a professor and Dean of the Faculty of Science at the University of Calcutta until his death in 1956. He became a Fellow of the Royal Society in 1927. He was president of the 21st session of the Indian Science Congress in 1934.

Amongst Saha&#x27;s classmates were Satyendra Nath Bose, Jnan Ghosh and Jnanendra Nath Mukherjee. In his later life, he was close to Amiya Charan Banerjee.

==Career==

Saha&#x27;s study of the thermal ionisation of elements led him to formulate what is known as the Saha ionisation equation. This equation is one of the basic tools for interpreting the spectra of stars. By studying the spectra of stars, one can find their temperature and using Saha&#x27;s equation determine the ionisation state of the elements making up the star. This was extended by Ralph H. Fowler and Edward Arthur Milne. Saha had previously reached the following conclusion on the subject:

Saha also invented an instrument to measure the weight and pressure of solar rays.

Meghnad Saha helped to establish several scientific institutions, including the Physics Department at Allahabad University in United Provinces (now Uttar Pradesh) and the Institute of Nuclear Physics (now Saha Institute of Nuclear Physics) in Kolkata. He founded the journal &quot;Science and Culture&quot; and was the editor until his death. He was the leading figure in organising several scientific societies, such as the National Academy of Science (1930), the Indian Physical Society (1934), and the Indian Institute of Science (1935). He was the director at Indian Association for the Cultivation of Science from 1953 to 1956. The Saha Institute of Nuclear Physics, founded in 1943 in Kolkata, is named after him.

Saha stood as a candidate for North-West Calcutta in the 1951 Lok Sabha election. He ran as a member of the Union of Socialists and Progressives, but maintained his independence from the party. His goal was to improve the planning of education, industrialisation, healthcare, and river valley development. He was up against Prabhu Dayal Himatsingka. Due to low funding for his campaign, Saha wrote to the publisher of his textbook &quot;Treatise on Heat&quot; to ask for an advance of â¹5000. He was elected by a margin of 16%.

Saha participated in the areas of education, refugees, rehabilitation, atomic energy, multipurpose river projects, flood control, and long term planning. In the book &quot;Meghnad Saha in Parliament,&quot; Saha is described as:&quot;Never unduly critical... forthright, so incisive, so thorough in pointing out lapses that the treasury bench was constantly on the defensive. This is brought out by the way he was accused of leaving his laboratory and straying into a territory not his own. But the reason why he was slowly drifting towards this public role (he was never a politician in the correct sense of the term) was the gradually widening gulf between his dream and the realityâbetween his vision of an industrialised India and the Government implementation of the plan.&quot;Saha was the chief architect of river planning in India and prepared the original plan for the Damodar Valley Project. His own observation with respect to his transition into government projects and political affairs was:


==Personal life==
Saha married Radha Rani Saha on 16 June 1918. They had a total of 7 children: 3 sons and 4 daughters.

Saha was an atheist.

==Death==
Saha died on the way to the hospital on 16 February 1956 after getting cardiac arrest. He was going to the office of the Planning Commission in the Rashtrapati Bhavan. It was reported he had been dealing with hypertension for ten months prior to his death. His remains were cremated at the Keoratola crematorium, Kolkata the following day.

==Tributes==

* &quot;Meghnad Saha&#x27;s ionization equation (c. 1920), which opened the door to stellar astrophysics was one of the top ten achievements of 20th century Indian science [and] could be considered in the Nobel Prize class.&quot; â Jayant Narlikar
* &quot;The impetus given to astrophysics by Saha&#x27;s work can scarcely be overestimated, as nearly all later progress in this field has been influenced by it and much of the subsequent work has the character of refinements of Saha&#x27;s ideas.&quot; â Svein Rosseland
* &quot;He (Saha) was extremely simple, almost austere, in his habits and personal needs. Outwardly, he sometimes gave an impression of being remote, matter of fact, and even harsh, but once the outer shell was broken, one invariably found in him a person of extreme warmth, deep humanity, sympathy and understanding; and though almost altogether unmindful of his own personal comforts, he was extremely solicitous in the case of others. It was not in his nature to placate others. He was a man of undaunted spirit, resolute determination, untiring energy and dedication.&quot; â Daulat Singh Kothari

<text>Samuel Bois Smith (27 December 1756 â 20 October 1826) was a Loyalist British Army officer and politician. He was appointed to the Executive Council of Upper Canada and appointed Administrator of Upper Canada.

Smith was born in Hempstead, New York, the son of Scottish immigrants (James Smith). In 1777, he joined the Queen&#x27;s Rangers during the American Revolutionary War. He surrendered to the Americans after the Battle of Yorktown. Smith moved with the Rangers to Queensbury Parish in the newly created colony of New Brunswick where the Rangers were disbanded. Smith likely met his wife (a native of nearby Maugerville Parish) during this period and then moved to England in 1784 to continue his service in the British Army. He rose to the rank of captain and was sent to Niagara in 1791. He was promoted to the position of lieutenant-colonel of his old regiment (which was recreated in Upper Canada) in 1801 before retiring to 1,000 acres (4Â km2) of land he had bought in Etobicoke and also in what is now in Lakeview, Mississauga. Later some of this land was sold to John Strachan for the original Trinity College campus, now Trinity Bellwoods Park. Smith was appointed 30 November 1813 to the Executive Council of Upper Canada for the town of Etobicoke.

In 1817 he was sworn in as Administrator of Upper Canada in the absence of Lieutenant Governor Francis Gore and served until 1818. He acted again as Administrator in the absence of Lieutenant Governor Sir Peregrine Maitland for three months in 1820.

As Administrator, Smith was advised not grant land to American immigrants until they had taken the oath of allegiance and resided in Upper Canada for seven years. He decided to follow the advice of his Executive Council and not to remove title to the land from those who did not qualify.

Smith was considered a weak official and was the target of complaints by both the reformer Robert Gourlay and the Family Compact member John Strachan, who thought him feeble, inept, and talentless. However, in April 1818, Smith ordered Gourlay arrested when he called an illegal assembly at York (now Toronto).

Smith retired from the Executive Council in October 1825. He died 20 October 1826 in York and left his wife and nine children. His son (Samuel B. Smith Jr.) was Clerk in the Executive Council of the Province of Canada and died in Toronto in 1882.

==Legacy==
The City of Toronto&#x27;s Colonel Samuel Smith Park in Etobicoke was created in the 1970s and opened in 1996 along Lake Ontario is named in his honour. The park lands was part of his property (known as Colonel Smith Tract). The Tract in Mississauga was inherited by his son Samuel and sold off by 1872 in what is now Lakeview, Mississauga.

==Smith Estate==

Following his death, his estate (on Lake Shore Boulevard between 40th and 41st Streets across from Long Branch GO Station) was occupied by his son and later sold. The last owner of the home was James Eastwood and the home was demolished in 1952. It is now a residential community consisting of townhouses, detached homes and apartments.

<doc id="839087" wikidata="Q44886" url="?curid=839087" title="AndrÃ© Vingt-Trois">
<text>AndrÃ© Armand Vingt-Trois (; born 7 November 1942) is a French cardinal of the Catholic Church. He served as Archbishop of Paris from 2005 to 2017, having previously served as Archbishop of Tours from 1999 to 2005. He was elevated to the cardinalate in 2007.

==Early life and ordination==
AndrÃ© Vingt-Trois was born in Paris, France, to Armand Vingt-Trois and Paulette (&quot;nÃ©e&quot; Vuillamy). His surname, which is French for &quot;twenty-three&quot;, is probably from an ancestor who, as a child or baby, was abandoned and found on the 23rd day of the month. Vingt-Trois completed his secondary studies at the LycÃ©e Henri IV and entered the Seminary of Saint-Sulpice at Issy-les-Moulineaux in 1962. He then attended the Institut Catholique de Paris, from where he obtained his licentiate in moral theology. From 1964 to 1965, Vingt-Trois performed his military service in Germany. He was ordained to the diaconate by Bishop Daniel Pezeril in October 1968 and to the priesthood by Cardinal FranÃ§ois Marty on 28 June 1969.

===Pastoral work===
During his priestly ministry, he worked especially in parochial catechetics and the formation of the laity. From 1974 to 1981, Vingt-Trois was vicar at the Parisian parish of Sainte-Jeanne de Chantal. He then served as director of his &quot;alma mater&quot; of the Seminary of Saint-Sulpice until 1988, also teaching moral and sacramental theology there. Vingt-Trois participated in different pastoral movements, including the Centre de prÃ©paration au mariage and the sessions of permanent formation of the clergy. He was later named vicar general of Paris, and was charged with the diocesan formation (the cathedral school and diocesan seminary), of the means of communications (Radio Notre-Dame, Paris Notre-Dame, Centre d&#x27;Information), of the familial pastoral, of the chaplains of public education, and of catechetics.

==Episcopate==

On 25 June 1988, Vingt-Trois was appointed Auxiliary Bishop of Paris and Titular Bishop of Thibilis by Pope John Paul II. He received his episcopal consecration on the following 14 October in Notre-Dame Cathedral from Cardinal Jean-Marie Lustiger, with Bishops PÃ©zeril and Gabriel Vanel serving as co-consecrators. Vingt-Trois was appointed Archbishop of Tours on 21 April 1999, and Archbishop of Paris on 11 February 2005. He was installed in Paris on the following 5 March and additionally appointed Ordinary of French Catholics of the Eastern Rites on 14 March. On 5 November 2007, he was elected President of the French Episcopal Conference for a term of three years.

==Cardinalate==
Pope Benedict XVI created him Cardinal-Priest of S. Luigi dei Francesi in the consistory of 23 November 2007. Vingt-Trois is no longer eligible to participate in papal conclaves, having reached the age of 80 on 7 November 2022.

He has been a member of the Congregation for Bishops and the Pontifical Council for the Family since 12 June 2008 and of the Congregation for the Clergy since 2 February 2010. On 7 March 2012 he was appointed a member of the Congregation for the Oriental Churches. In October 2012, after being appointed a synod father by Pope Francis, he took part in the 13th Ordinary General Assembly of the Synod of Bishops, which concerned itself with the new evangelization for the transmission of the Christian faith.

He was one of the cardinal electors who participated in the 2013 papal conclave that selected Pope Francis. Francis accepted his resignation as Archbishop of Paris on 7 December 2017.

==Opposition to same-sex marriage==
The cardinal has been a vocal opponent of efforts to introduce same-sex marriage in France. In 2013, he warned that it could incite violence and split society in France: &quot;This is the way a violent society develops. Society has lost its capacity of integration and especially its ability to blend differences in a common project.&quot; He insisted that as long as the government is not listening to French citizens, this could lead to more violence.

<text>Harry Frederick Harlow (October 31, 1905 â December 6, 1981) was an American psychologist best known for his maternal-separation, dependency needs, and social isolation experiments on rhesus monkeys, which manifested the importance of caregiving and companionship to social and cognitive development. He conducted most of his research at the University of WisconsinâMadison, where humanistic psychologist Abraham Maslow worked with him for a short period of time.

Harlow&#x27;s experiments were ethically controversial; they included creating inanimate wire and wood surrogate &quot;mothers&quot; for the rhesus infants. Each infant became attached to its particular mother, recognizing its unique face. Harlow then investigated whether the infants had a preference for bare-wire mothers or cloth-covered mothers in different situations: with the wire mother holding a bottle with food, and the cloth mother holding nothing, or with the wire mother holding nothing, while the cloth mother held a bottle with food. The monkeys overwhelmingly chose the cloth mother, with or without food, only visiting the wire mother that had food when needing sustenance.

Later in his career, he cultivated infant monkeys in isolation chambers for up to 24 months, from which they emerged intensely disturbed. Some researchers cite the experiments as a factor in the rise of the animal liberation movement in the United States.&lt;ref name=&quot;Blum2002/225&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; A &quot;Review of General Psychology&quot; survey, published in 2002, ranked Harlow as the 26th most cited psychologist of the 20th century.

Harry Harlow was born on October 31, 1905, to Mabel Rock and Alonzo Harlow Israel. Harlow was born and raised in Fairfield, Iowa, the third of four brothers. Little is known of Harlow&#x27;s early life, but in an unfinished autobiography he recollected that his mother was cold to him and he experienced bouts of depression throughout his life. After a year at Reed College in Portland, Oregon, Harlow obtained admission to Stanford University through a special aptitude test. After a semester as an English major with nearly disastrous grades, he declared himself as a psychology major.

Harlow attended Stanford in 1924, and subsequently became a graduate student in psychology, working directly under Calvin Perry Stone, a well-known animal behaviorist, and Walter Richard Miles, a vision expert, who were all supervised by Lewis Terman. Harlow studied largely under Terman, the developer of the Stanford-Binet IQ Test, and Terman helped shape Harlow&#x27;s future. After receiving a PhD in 1930, he changed his name from Israel to Harlow. The change was made at Terman&#x27;s prompting for fear of the negative consequences of having a seemingly Jewish last name, even though his family was not Jewish.

Directly after completing his doctoral dissertation, Harlow accepted a professorship at the University of WisconsinâMadison. Harlow was unsuccessful in persuading the Department of Psychology to provide him with adequate laboratory space. As a result, Harlow acquired a vacant building down the street from the university, and, with the assistance of his graduate students, renovated the building into what later became known as the Primate Laboratory, one of the first of its kind in the world. Under Harlow&#x27;s direction, it became a place of cutting-edge research at which some 40 students earned their PhDs.

Harlow received numerous awards and honors, including election to the United States National Academy of Sciences (1951), the Howard Crosby Warren Medal (1956), election to the American Philosophical Society (1957), the National Medal of Science (1967), election to the American Academy of Arts and Sciences (1961), and the Gold Medal from the American Psychological Foundation (1973). He served as head of the Human Resources Research branch of the Department of the Army from 1950 to 1952, head of the Division of Anthropology and Psychology of the National Research Council from 1952 to 1955, consultant to the Army Scientific Advisory Panel, and president of the American Psychological Association from 1958 to 1959.

Harlow married his first wife, Clara Mears, in 1932. One of the select students with an IQ above 150 whom Terman studied at Stanford, Clara was Harlow&#x27;s student before becoming romantically involved with him. The couple had two children together, Robert and Richard. Harlow and Mears divorced in 1946. That same year, Harlow married child psychologist Margaret Kuenne. They had two children together, Pamela and Jonathan. Margaret died on August 11, 1971, after a prolonged struggle with cancer, with which she had been diagnosed in 1967. Her death led Harlow to depression once more, for which he was treated with electro-convulsive therapy. In March 1972, Harlow remarried Clara Mears. The couple lived together in Tucson, Arizona, until Harlow&#x27;s death in 1981. He was buried alongside Margaret Kuenne at Forest Hill Cemetery in Madison, Wisconsin.

==Monkey studies==
Harlow came to the University of WisconsinâMadison in 1930 after obtaining his doctorate under the guidance of several distinguished researchers, including Calvin Stone and Lewis Terman, at Stanford University. He began his career with nonhuman primate research. He worked with the primates at Henry Vilas Zoo, where he developed the Wisconsin General Testing Apparatus (WGTA) to study learning, cognition, and memory. It was through these studies that Harlow discovered that the monkeys he worked with were developing strategies for his tests. What would later become known as learning sets, Harlow described as &quot;learning to learn&quot;.

In order to study the development of these learning sets, Harlow needed access to developing primates, so he established a breeding colony of rhesus macaques in 1932. Due to the nature of his study, Harlow needed regular access to infant primates and thus chose to rear them in a nursery setting, rather than with their protective mothers. This alternative rearing technique, also called maternal deprivation, is highly controversial to this day, and is used, in variants, as a model of early life adversity in primates.

Research with and caring for infant rhesus monkeys further inspired Harlow, and ultimately led to some of his best-known experiments: the use of surrogate mothers. Although Harlow, his students, contemporaries, and associates soon learned how to care for the physical needs of their infant monkeys, the nursery-reared infants remained very different from their mother-reared peers. Psychologically speaking, these infants were slightly strange: they were reclusive, had definite social deficits, and clung to their cloth diapers. At the same time in the reverse configuration, babies that had grown up with only a mother and no playmates showed signs of fear or aggressiveness.

Noticing their attachment to the soft cloth of their diapers and the psychological changes that correlated with the absence of a maternal figure, Harlow sought to investigate the motherâinfant bond. This relationship was under constant scrutiny in the early twentieth century, as B. F. Skinner and the behaviorists took on John Bowlby in a discussion of the mother&#x27;s importance in the development of the child, the nature of their relationship, and the impact of physical contact between mother and child.

The studies were motivated by John Bowlby&#x27;s World Health Organization-sponsored study and report &quot;Maternal Care and Mental Health&quot; in 1950, in which Bowlby reviewed previous studies on the effects of institutionalization on child development, and the distress experienced by children when separated from their mothers, such as RenÃ© Spitz&#x27;s and his own surveys on children raised in a variety of settings. In 1953, his colleague James Robertson produced a short and controversial documentary film, titled &quot;A Two-Year-Old Goes to Hospital,&quot; demonstrating the almost-immediate effects of maternal separation. Bowlby&#x27;s report, coupled with Robertson&#x27;s film, demonstrated the importance of the primary caregiver in human and non-human primate development. Bowlby de-emphasized the mother&#x27;s role in feeding as a basis for the development of a strong motherâchild relationship, but his conclusions generated much debate. It was the debate concerning the reasons behind the demonstrated need for maternal care that Harlow addressed in his studies with surrogates. Physical contact with infants was considered harmful to their development, and this view led to sterile, contact-less nurseries across the country. Bowlby disagreed, claiming that the mother provides much more than food to the infant, including a unique bond that positively influences the child&#x27;s development and mental health.

To investigate the debate, Harlow created inanimate surrogate mothers for the rhesus infants from wire and wood. Each infant became attached to its particular mother, recognizing its unique face and preferring it above all others. Harlow next chose to investigate if the infants had a preference for bare-wire mothers or cloth-covered mothers. For this experiment, he presented the infants with a clothed mother and a wire mother under two conditions. In one situation, the wire mother held a bottle with food, and the cloth mother held no food. In the other situation, the cloth mother held the bottle, and the wire mother had nothing.

Overwhelmingly, the infant macaques preferred spending their time clinging to the cloth mother. Even when only the wire mother could provide nourishment, the monkeys visited her only to feed. Harlow concluded that there was much more to the motherâinfant relationship than milk, and that this &quot;contact comfort&quot; was essential to the psychological development and health of infant monkeys and children. It was this research that gave strong, empirical support to Bowlby&#x27;s assertions on the importance of love and motherâchild interaction.

Successive experiments concluded that infants used the surrogate as a base for exploration, and a source of comfort and protection in novel and even frightening situations. In an experiment called the &quot;open-field test&quot;, an infant was placed in a novel environment with novel objects. When the infant&#x27;s surrogate mother was present, it clung to her, but then began venturing off to explore. If frightened, the infant ran back to the surrogate mother and clung to her for a time before venturing out again. Without the surrogate mother&#x27;s presence, the monkeys were paralyzed with fear, huddling in a ball and sucking their thumbs.

In the &quot;fear test&quot;, infants were presented with a fearful stimulus, often a noise-making teddy bear. Without the mother, the infants cowered and avoided the object. When the surrogate mother was present, however, the infant did not show great fearful responses and often contacted the deviceâexploring and attacking it.

Another study looked at the differentiated effects of being raised with only either a wire-mother or a cloth-mother. Both groups gained weight at equal rates, but the monkeys raised on a wire-mother had softer stool and trouble digesting the milk, frequently suffering from diarrhea. Harlow&#x27;s interpretation of this behavior, which is still widely accepted, was that a lack of contact comfort is psychologically stressful to the monkeys, and the digestive problems are a physiological manifestation of that stress.

The importance of these findings is that they contradicted both the traditional pedagogic advice of limiting or avoiding bodily contact in an attempt to avoid spoiling children, and the insistence of the predominant behaviorist school of psychology that emotions were negligible. Feeding was thought to be the most important factor in the formation of a motherâchild bond. Harlow concluded, however, that nursing strengthened the motherâchild bond because of the intimate body contact that it provided. He described his experiments as a study of love. He also believed that contact comfort could be provided by either mother or father. Though widely accepted now, this idea was revolutionary at the time in provoking thoughts and values concerning the studies of love.

Some of Harlow&#x27;s final experiments explored social deprivation in the quest to create an animal model for the study of depression. This study is the most controversial, and involved isolation of infant and juvenile macaques for various periods of time. Monkeys placed in isolation exhibited social deficits when introduced or re-introduced into a peer group. They appeared unsure of how to interact with their conspecifics, and mostly stayed separate from the group, demonstrating the importance of social interaction and stimuli in forming the ability to interact with conspecifics in developing monkeys, and, comparatively, in children.

Critics of Harlow&#x27;s research have observed that clinging is a matter of survival in young rhesus monkeys, but not in humans, and have suggested that his conclusions, when applied to humans, overestimate the importance of contact comfort and underestimate the importance of nursing.

Harlow first reported the results of these experiments in &quot;The Nature of Love&quot;, the title of his address to the sixty-sixth Annual Convention of the American Psychological Association in Washington, D.C., August 31, 1958.

===Partial and total isolation of infant monkeys===
Beginning in 1959, Harlow and his students began publishing their observations on the effects of partial and total social isolation. Partial isolation involved raising monkeys in bare wire cages that allowed them to see, smell, and hear other monkeys, but provided no opportunity for physical contact. Total social isolation involved rearing monkeys in isolation chambers that precluded any and all contact with other monkeys.

Harlow &quot;et al.&quot; reported that partial isolation resulted in various abnormalities such as blank staring, stereotyped repetitive circling in their cages, and self-mutilation. These monkeys were then observed in various settings.

In the total isolation experiments, baby monkeys would be left alone for three, six, 12, or 24 months of &quot;total social deprivation&quot;. The experiments produced monkeys that were severely psychologically disturbed. Harlow wrote:

Harlow tried to reintegrate the monkeys who had been isolated for six months by placing them with monkeys who had been raised normally. The rehabilitation attempts met with limited success. Harlow wrote that total social isolation for the first six months of life produced &quot;severe deficits in virtually every aspect of social behavior&quot;. Isolates exposed to monkeys the same age who were reared normally &quot;achieved only limited recovery of simple social responses&quot;. Some monkey mothers reared in isolation exhibited &quot;acceptable maternal behavior when forced to accept infant contact over a period of months, but showed no further recovery&quot;. Isolates given to surrogate mothers developed &quot;crude interactive patterns among themselves&quot;. Opposed to this, when six-month isolates were exposed to younger, three-month-old monkeys, they achieved &quot;essentially complete social recovery for all situations tested&quot;. The findings were confirmed by other researchers, who found no difference between peer-therapy recipients and mother-reared infants, but found that artificial surrogates had very little effect.

Since Harlow&#x27;s pioneering work on touch, recent researches have found evidence to support that touch during infancy is very important to health and touch deprivation can be harmful.

===Pit of despair===
Harlow was well known for refusing to use conventional terminology, instead choosing deliberately outrageous terms for the experimental apparatus he devised. This came from an early conflict with the conventional psychological establishment in which Harlow used the term &quot;love&quot; in place of the popular and archaically correct term &quot;attachment&quot;. Such terms and respective devices included a forced-mating device he called the &quot;rape rack&quot;, tormenting surrogate-mother devices he called &quot;Iron maidens&quot;, and an isolation chamber he called the &quot;pit of despair&quot;, developed by him and a graduate student, Stephen Suomi.

In the last of these devices, alternatively called the &quot;well of despair&quot;, baby monkeys were left alone in darkness for up to one year from birth, or repetitively separated from their peers and isolated in the chamber. These procedures quickly produced monkeys that were severely psychologically disturbed, which were used as models of human depression.

Harlow tried to rehabilitate monkeys that had been subjected to varying degrees of isolation using various forms of therapy. &quot;In our study of psychopathology, we began as sadists trying to produce abnormality. Today, we are psychiatrists trying to achieve normality and equanimity.&quot;

==Analysis of experiments==

===Sigmund Freud&#x27;s influence===

Sigmund Freud can be credited for providing the foundation of mother and child relationships, that would soon be the inspiration and the starting point for Harlow&#x27;s studies. Freud discovered, after years of observation, that people who lacked consistent mothering were more likely to develop behavioral problems later in life. Freud&#x27;s findings displayed that people who experienced lack of mothering, suffered from hostility, anxiety withdraws, and alcoholism. Freud constructed the foundation for Harry Harlow to continue and be successful in his work.

The Freudian interpretation believed that &quot;it was the focus around the importance of the breast and the instinctive oral, feeding tendencies during the first year of life&quot;. Harlow took this Freudian interpretation and asked &quot;what about that connection is so crucial?&quot; He used what Freud had already determined, and continued to ask questions to further the research in his own studies. The Freudian hypotheses states that a partial component of sexual drives, orality, determines the choice of an object, mother&#x27;s breast, driven by hunger.

===Influences===
Harlow&#x27;s work influenced Bruno Bettelheim, director of the Sonia Shankman Orthogenic School in Chicago. This was a home for &quot;disturbed&quot; children, Bettelheim studied autism in children. He was very fascinated with Harlow and his study with monkeys. He thought that he could use what Harlow learned in his own work.

===Reactive attachment disorder===
====Definition====
Reactive attachment disorder (RAD) forms when a child has experienced maltreatment, sexual and emotional abuse, or other forms of neglect, and manifests as behavioral problems. The treatment for reactive attachment disorder is very complex. By the time a child has been seen and diagnosed with reactive attachment disorder, several different mental health, medical, and developmental conditions need to be treated. While more children are being diagnosed with RAD, most are first mis-diagnosed with other behavioral problems. Children diagnosed with RAD need to be in intensive therapy, and so should their caregivers. The confusing path to a diagnosis often leaves children and families suffering for longer periods of time.

====Harlow&#x27;s contribution====
Harlow believed that the relationship between a mother and child was created by the mother providing tactile comfort, meaning infants have a natural need to touch and cling to something for emotional support. Harry Harlow helped further research that contributed to the discovery of RAD. He believed, and his study results showed, that the bond between mother and child in the first few years of life is extremely important for the mental health and development of the child. The ideas that he put into the psychology field of study helped discover what we know as RAD today.

Many children are misdiagnosed with RAD when they have other behavioral problems, and vice versa. Harlow&#x27;s experiments gave psychologists experimental data for the causes and development of RAD, which helped reduce misdiagnosis.

==Criticism==
Many of Harlow&#x27;s experiments are now considered unethicalâin their nature as well as Harlow&#x27;s descriptions of themâand they both contributed to heightened awareness of the treatment of laboratory animals, and helped propel the creation of today&#x27;s ethics regulations. The monkeys in the experiment were deprived of maternal affection, potentially leading to what are now known as panic disorders. University of Washington professor Gene Sackett, one of Harlow&#x27;s doctoral students, stated that Harlow&#x27;s experiments provided the impetus for the animal liberation movement in the U.S.

William Mason, another one of Harlow&#x27;s students who continued conducting deprivation experiments after leaving Wisconsin, has said that Harlow &quot;kept this going to the point where it was clear to many people that the work was really violating ordinary sensibilities, that anybody with respect for life or people would find this offensive. It&#x27;s as if he sat down and said, &#x27;I&#x27;m only going to be around another ten years. What I&#x27;d like to do, then, is leave a great big mess behind.&#x27; If that was his aim, he did a perfect job.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Blum1994/96&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; Mason also published articles where he attempted to work through the issue between a scientist&#x27;s wish to understand the natural world and the &quot;rights&quot; of animals to life and autonomy.

Stephen Suomi, a former Harlow student and supporter who now conducts maternal deprivation experiments on monkeys at the National Institutes of Health, has been criticized by PETA and members of the U.S. Congress.

Deborah Blum, a science journalist, criticized Harlow&#x27;s work; criticisms by her and by his colleagues, collected by Blum, mentioned almost exclusively the negative impact on the public of his untamed language. Blum reported in her own writing that even Suomi felt that he had to wait until Harlow retired from the University of Wisconsin before he could shut down his unethical &quot;pit of despair&quot; projects; they had been causing him &quot;nightmares&quot;.

Yet another of Harlow&#x27;s students, Leonard Rosenblum, also went on to conduct maternal deprivation experiments with bonnet and pigtail macaque monkeys, and other research, involving exposing monkeys to drugâmaternal-deprivation combinations in an attempt to &quot;model&quot; human panic disorder. Rosenblum&#x27;s research, and his justifications for it, have also been criticized.

E. H. Eyestone, Chief of the Animal Resources Branch of the National Institutes of Health (NIH), expressed the concern of a review committee with the &quot;pits of despair&quot; experiments. Any concerns for welfare and humaneness were reduced to issues of publicity.

Harlow commented to an interviewer in 1974, &quot;The only thing I care about is whether the monkeys will turn out a property I can publish. I don&#x27;t have any love for them. Never have. I really don&#x27;t like animals. I despise cats, I hate dogs. How could you like a monkey?&quot;.

Although Harlow certainly was aware of the animal protection legislation in place in the United Kingdom since 1876, active legislative attempts in the United States did not begin until 1960, where the Animal Welfare Act was passed in 1966.

===Role of the American Psychological Association===
Harry Harlow won a national medal of science based on his work with monkeys, in addition to being named the president of the American Psychological Association (APA). The APA is the governing body for researchers in the field of psychology. The APA offers oversight of researchers&#x27; works, which includes whether ethical principles are being followed in their research.

==In popular culture==
A theatrical play, &quot;The Harry Harlow Project&quot;, based on the life and work of Harlow, has been produced in Victoria and performed nationally in Australia.

Writer and animal-rights proponent Grant Morrison has cited Harry Harlow and his experiments as partial inspiration behind the creation (with Andy Kubert and Frazer Irving) of Batman villain Professor Pyg.

<doc id="839112" wikidata="Q139857" url="?curid=839112" title="Fumaric acid">
<text>Fumaric acid or &quot;trans&quot;-butenedioic acid is an organic compound with the formula HO2CCH=CHCO2H. A white solid, fumaric acid occurs widely in nature. It has a fruit-like taste and has been used as a food additive. Its E number is E297. The salts and esters are known as fumarates. Fumarate can also refer to the ion (in solution). Fumaric acid is the &quot;trans&quot; isomer of butenedioic acid, while maleic acid is the &quot;cis&quot; isomer.

==Biosynthesis and occurrence==
It is produced in eukaryotic organisms from succinate in complex 2 of the electron transport chain via the enzyme succinate dehydrogenase. 

Fumaric acid is found in fumitory (&quot;Fumaria officinalis&quot;), bolete mushrooms (specifically &quot;Boletus fomentarius var. pseudo-igniarius&quot;), lichen, and Iceland moss.

Fumarate is an intermediate in the citric acid cycle used by cells to produce energy in the form of adenosine triphosphate (ATP) from food. It is formed by the oxidation of succinate by the enzyme succinate dehydrogenase. Fumarate is then converted by the enzyme fumarase to malate.

Human skin naturally produces fumaric acid when exposed to sunlight.

Fumarate is also a product of the urea cycle.

==Uses==

===Food===
Fumaric acid has been used as a food acidulant since 1946. It is approved for use as a food additive in the EU, USA and Australia and New Zealand. As a food additive, it is used as an acidity regulator and can be denoted by the E number E297. It is generally used in beverages and baking powders for which requirements are placed on purity. Fumaric acid is used in the making of wheat tortillas as a food preservative and as the acid in leavening. It is generally used as a substitute for tartaric acid and occasionally in place of citric acid, at a rate of 1Â g of fumaric acid to every ~1.5Â g of citric acid, in order to add sourness, similarly to the way malic acid is used. As well as being a component of some artificial vinegar flavors, such as &quot;Salt and Vinegar&quot; flavored potato chips, it is also used as a coagulant in stove-top pudding mixes.

The European Commission Scientific Committee on Animal Nutrition, part of DG Health, found in 2014 that fumaric acid is &quot;practically non-toxic&quot; but high doses are probably nephrotoxic after long-term use.

===Medicine===
Fumaric acid was developed as a medicine to treat the autoimmune condition psoriasis in the 1950s in Germany as a tablet containing 3 esters, primarily dimethyl fumarate, and marketed as Fumaderm by Biogen Idec in Europe. Biogen would later go on to develop the main ester, dimethyl fumarate, as a treatment for multiple sclerosis. 

In patients with relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis, the ester dimethyl fumarate (BG-12, Biogen) significantly reduced relapse and disability progression in a phase 3 trial. It activates the Nrf2 antioxidant response pathway, the primary cellular defense against the cytotoxic effects of oxidative stress.

===Other uses===
Fumaric acid is used in the manufacture of polyester resins and polyhydric alcohols and as a mordant for dyes.

Fumaric acid can be used to make 6-methylcoumarin.

When fumaric acid is added to their feed, lambs produce up to 70% less methane during digestion.
==Synthesis==
Fumaric acid is produced based on catalytic isomerisation of maleic acid in aqueous solutions at low p&quot;H&quot;. It precipitates from the reaction solution. Maleic acid is accessible in large volumes as a hydrolysis product of maleic anhydride, produced by catalytic oxidation of benzene or butane.
===Historic and laboratory routes===
Fumaric acid was first prepared from succinic acid. A traditional synthesis involves oxidation of furfural (from the processing of maize) using chlorate in the presence of a vanadium-based catalyst.

==Reactions==
The chemical properties of fumaric acid can be anticipated from its component functional groups. This weak acid forms a diester, it undergoes bromination across the double bond, and it is a good dienophile.
==Safety==
The oral LD50 is 10g/kg.

<text>Marshal Law is an English-language superhero comic book series created by Pat Mills and Kevin O&#x27;Neill.

&quot;Marshal Law&quot; was first published by Marvel&#x27;s Epic Comics imprint in 1987. The series is a satire on the superhero genre as well as a deconstruction of the superheroes of the Golden Age and Silver Age.

The series is characterized by its extreme graphic violence and nudity, and Mills&#x27; skewering of superhero conventions and US government policy and society.

==Publication history==
Epic Comics launched &quot;Marshal Law&quot; in October 1987 as a six-issue limited series. It was followed by the &quot;Crime and Punishment: Marshal Law Takes Manhattan&quot; one-shot, in which most of Marvel Comics&#x27; major characters were parodied.

In 1991, Mills and O&#x27;Neill took the character to the fledgling Apocalypse Comics for another one-shot, &quot;Toxic! Presents: Marshal Law: Kingdom of the Blind&quot; #1. This was followed by a reprint of &quot;Marshal Law: Takes Manhattan&quot; as #2, after which the series continued as &quot;Apocalypse Presents&quot; for another six issues while the Marshall Law character moved to star in the lead feature of &quot;Toxic!&quot;, a weekly comic started in 1991. &quot;Toxic!&quot; proved to be short-lived and Apocalypse Comics went bankrupt in 1992. Mills and O&#x27;Neill then took Marshal Law to Dark Horse Comics, where the story in &quot;Toxic!&quot; was completed in late 1992. That year also saw the character return to Marvel for a two-issue series pitting Marshal Law against Clive Barker&#x27;s Pinhead character.

Over the next few years, Marshal Law appeared in two more intercompany crossovers, one with the Savage Dragon and another with the Mask. In 2000, Mills and O&#x27;Neill took the character to the Cool Beans World website. The stories here were illustrated novellas, rather than actual comic strips, titled &quot;The Day Of The Dead&quot; (which was later published in a paperback edition) and &quot;Cloak Of Evil&quot;. The website closed in 2002.

==Plot==
The title character, Marshal Law, is the government-sanctioned &quot;super hero hunter&quot; (aka law enforcement officer, or &quot;cape killer&quot;) with superpowers in the city of San Futuro, the near-future metropolis built from the ruins of San Francisco following a massive earthquake. Law&#x27;s job is to take down other superheroes who have gone rogue, which he does with maximum force and great pleasure. Aided by the wheelchair-using &quot;Danny&quot; and his physically imposing (but extremely polite) partner &quot;Kiloton&quot;, the Marshal operates from a secret police precinct hidden below the city, dispensing just enough brutal justice to keep the city&#x27;s many super-powered gangs in a balanced dÃ©tente while safeguarding the ordinary citizenry.

Marshal Law&#x27;s secret identity is Joe Gilmore, a former supersoldier consumed with self-hatred about being a superhero. In this world, superheroes are commonplace thanks to genetic engineering, much of the United States&#x27; armed forces having undergone the process. However, while their bodies may become super-powered, their minds remain exactly as they were, and in many cases the inability to feel pain causes the subjects to compensate by inflicting pain on others. Psychosis of varying degrees is also a common side-effect, and some subjects develop wildly uncontrollable superpowers.

The plot of the original six-issue series revolved around the Marshal&#x27;s attempts to unmask the Sleepman, a serial killer and rapist who preys on women dressed as Celeste, the current girlfriend of the beloved superhero, Public Spirit. Marshal Law&#x27;s loathing of the Public Spirit as standing for everything that is fraudulent and hypocritical about superheroes leads him to suspect the Spirit himself of being responsible for the Sleepman&#x27;s crimes; without any proof, though, the guilty party goes unpunished until a surprising revelation from a former superheroine reveals that the Marshal&#x27;s suspicions may not be too far from the truth.

While in the first series, the Marshal&#x27;s primary nemeses are the Public Spirit and the Sleepman, he later faces off against Private Eye and The Persecutor. A recurring secondary adversary (initially treated seriously, though later becoming comic relief) is Suicida, a psychopathic ex-soldier who leads the murderous Gangreen street gang.

The plot of &quot;Secret Tribunal&quot; revolved around an orbiting incubation center that created and mentally programmed superheroes. It was under attack by a monster called The Incubus, which was defeated by Growing Boy.

==Cast==
* Marshal Law (Joe Gilmore): A violent and uncharismatic lawman, dealing with the twisted superheroes of San Futuro while searching for an actual hero. His public unpleasantness contrasts with a strong internal moral compass. Despite his hatred of superheroes, Marshal Law begrudgingly admits that he is technically one himself, having been given super strength, a healing factor, and the ability to shut off his pain receptors by a military experiment. Like many boys of his generation, Marshal Law was inspired by the Public Spirit to join the military to fight communist insurgents in &quot;The Zone&quot;, an unstable area of South America. The horrors of the war, combined with the atrocities that the deployed superheroes committed made Marshal Law realize that superheroes were as corruptible as anyone else, and upon coming home took a job with the San Futuro police to hunt heroes who stray from the path of justice.
* Public Spirit (Colonel Buck Caine): The world&#x27;s most powerful and popular hero who was a product of US genetic engineering and copious steroid usage. Marshal Law regards him as corrupt and untrustworthy. Following the death of his fiancÃ©e and fellow superheroine, Virago, before he was sent on a space mission, he becomes a suspect behind the murders of strippers dressed like his new love, superheroine Celeste. Eventually, it is revealed that he tried to kill Virago himself, as she was pregnant, which would keep him from being able to participate in the space mission. She survived and took the identity of Mrs Mallon. The Sleepman is actually his son, Danny, and he intends to kill Celeste as revenge for his mother being left to die. At what was supposed to be his wedding to Celeste, the truth about Virago is revealed and he is humiliated. He tries to secretly flee the country, but is discovered at an airport, killing innocent people in his attempt to escape. Public Spirit is eventually killed by McGland after being defeated in a protracted fight with Marshal Law, during which Public Spirit finally admits that he hates his life as a superhero. He felt that responsibilities were foisted onto him that he could never live up to, and that he wanted to go to space to escape the prying eyes of the American public. Against Marshal Lawâs wishes, McGland decides to make it appear that Public Spirit died defending the airport from a terrorist attack, and to hush up his connection to The Sleepman. It is revealed later that most of the world&#x27;s superheroes know the truth, and all but his most ardent followers do not care.
* The Sleepman: A serial killer wearing a metallic costume, black cape, and a brown paper bag over his head under which is a second mask. He rapes and murders women who dress like Celeste. As he is a superhero who can fly, Marshal Law suspects him to be Public Spirit, as flying superheroes are rare. He has a deep-seated loathing of himself and all superheroes, and longs to be stopped by Marshal Law. He rapes and kills Lynn Evans to motivate his idol, with the ultimate goal of goading him into an epic showdown that would go down in history as one of the greatest superhuman battles of all time. It is eventually revealed that he is Marshal Law&#x27;s supposedly crippled friend, Danny. Danny is actually the Public Spirit&#x27;s son with his supposedly dead former fiancÃ©e, Virago, who had inherited both of his parents&#x27; powers and thus is the most powerful superhuman in existence. Virago survived Public Spirit&#x27;s attempt to kill her (he did so because her pregnancy would preclude him from going on a space mission) and raised Danny in secret. While only a few years would pass to Public Spirit and the crew, more than two decades would pass on Earth, hence Danny is roughly the same age as his father. His mother encourages him to kill strippers who look like Public Spirit&#x27;s current fiancÃ©e, Celeste, as practice for when he murders the real Celeste. At the end of the first six issue arc, The Sleepman is believed to have been killed by Marshall Law after being shot and falling into the sea, but was actually taken by Dr. Mendel to be studied and reeducated, as he has severe brain damage due to being submerged for twelve hours.
* Lynn Evans: Marshal Law&#x27;s girlfriend, a college journalist and female rights activist who is openly critical of superheroes. They met when the great earthquake destroyed the wall separating their apartments. She does not know he is a superhero, and openly voices her distaste for Marshal Law as a fascist thug. She is killed by The Sleepman while protesting Celeste, her death affecting Marshal Law greatly. She, along with multiple dead heroes, is eventually revived as a zombie, but the process transformed her into a twisted parody of her former self, turning her into an anarchistic supervillainess before she is put down by Marshal Law, who had decided his love for her wasn&#x27;t enough to justify not ending the danger she now presented.
* Mrs. Mallon: A shopkeeper who resents superheroes but seems to enjoy the company of Marshal Law due to his work as a hunter of heroes. Her only known relative is her son Danny. It is eventually revealed that she is Virago, the first true superheroine and former fiancÃ©e of Public Spirit whom supposedly died more than twenty years before the main events of the series. She and Buck were raised together as children in a lab, growing up as siblings before becoming lovers. She was supposed to have drowned while the two superheroes were flying in a storm. Her pregnancy would have stopped Public Spirit from going into outer space (even though he would have aged only a few years, due to nature of the space travel, more than two decades would have passed on Earth so anyone with a family was ineligible). She raised Danny with a hatred of superheroes and encouraged him to kill women dressed like Celeste, the current lover of Public Spirit, in a plot to humiliate his father. She is killed by Public Spirit after the two began arguing about Danny and her revenge plot.
* Kiloton: The large partner of Marshal Law who watches their base below San Futuro. He is killed and mutilated by Private Eye after discovering his organ trafficking ring. Upon avenging his death, Marshal Law salutes him and calls him the only hero he had ever met, although he later considers Growing Boy to be a potential hero as well.
* Razorhead: A mercenary with the ability to grow blades out of his body. Razorhead was initially hired by the former sidekick of the Black Scarab to kill Marshal Law, but eventually sided with Law against the zombified Black Scarab and became Marshal Law&#x27;s new partner.
* Celeste: The second fiancÃ©e of the Public Spirit and a member of a cult of heroines with sexual powers, often used as spies and assassins. She is killed (and presumably raped) by Sleepman on her wedding day.
* Gangreen Gang: A gang of costumed psychopaths who battle other super teams for the control of the dystopian San Futuro. They dress in matching green costumes and utilize explosive weaponry. Like Marshal Law, they are mostly veterans of the war in the Zone, but the Gangreen Gang have been reduced to petty crime after being unable to cope with civilian life.
* Growing Boy: A naive young hero who appears in &quot;Secret Tribunal&quot;, whose size-increasing power sometimes malfunctions. He is befriended by Marshal Law and grows to look up to him after seeing his hidden moral compass and sense of justice.
* The Private Eye: He appears in &quot;Kingdom of the Blind&quot;. The Private Eye is really Scott Brennan, billionaire and best friends with Public Spirit. Brennan got his inheritance after gunning down his abusive parents in an alley with the help of his butler and now battles the unwashed masses, whom he hates. He styles himself as being a moral doctor, using his father&#x27;s own twisted experimental techniques to &quot;cure&quot; the city of petty crime by torturing and murdering the poor and downtrodden in gruesome ways. He also finances his ventures and keeps himself fighting by stealing the organs of his young orphan sidekicks, selling the parts he doesn&#x27;t need to other heroes. Initially, Law is not suspicious of him due to their similarities, but after Kiloton exposes Private Eye&#x27;s child organ trafficking operation, Marshal Law goes on a warpath to kill him. The Private Eye manages to kill Kiloton before being killed by Marshal Law, who knocks him into an industrial meat grinder.
* The Persecutor (Don Matrione) is a vigilante and an old acquaintance of Marshal Law from his time in the military. The Persecutor was a torture technician, who was employed by the CIA to prop up several South American dictatorships, which were friendly to America. His family was assassinated by vengeful revolutionaries, who had tracked him back to America. In his grief, Matrione was driven insane and after hearing a speech by the Public Spirit, came to believe all of his problems were the result of foreigners and members of the counter-culture, refusing to believe himself to be at fault for anything and thus developing a &quot;persecution complex&quot;. He then became the Persecutor, a violent neo-nazi vigilante, who kills minorities and left-leaning Americans that he blames for all the country&#x27;s ills regardless of whether or not they are committing a crime. He was hounded by Marshal Law in &quot;Marshal Law takes Manhattan&quot; for killing Hispanic protesters and checks himself into a maximum security superhero asylum to try and escape him. Law eventually finds him and, after a drawn-out fight in the burning asylum (during which The Persecutor discovers who Marshal Law is), he is defeated and handcuffed. The Persecutor again attempts to deny any wrongdoing and pleads to be let go, so Marshal Law shoves him out of his vehicle into a district full of homeless cannibals, where he is promptly skinned alive and roasted.
* Black Scarab is one of Marshal Law&#x27;s previous enemies from before the series began. Originally, he was a superhero that Marshal Law killed for running a protection racket with his sidekick. He was revived as a zombie by his former sidekick so that they can kill Marshal Law. However, the undead hero reveals that there is no afterlife, causing him to throw off his nominal claims of heroism and instead plan to spread the &quot;gift&quot; of undeath to the world, freeing humanity of their shackles of mortality and morality. Fashioning himself as the &quot;Pope of No Hope&quot;, he creates an army of undead &quot;heroes&quot; who have been driven insane by the oblivion of death and begin to besiege California in order to collect more soldiers. He is ultimately rekilled by Marshal Law, who obliterates him and his zombie army with his gunship.
* The Jesus Society of America is the first team of superheroes ever assembled during World War II, and is idolized as the pinnacle of patriotic heroism. In actuality, the JSA was completely incompetent, with their bright costumes and lack of combat training making them easy targets on the battlefield and thus prolonging the war by six months. Following the war&#x27;s end, multiple scandals caused the remaining members of the group to be screened by the Committee for Unheroic Activities, leading several to commit suicide after their more unsavory personal lives were dredged up and many more to be sent to prison for crimes ranging from drug use to bestiality. The final remnants of the team then tried to take on the mafia to regain the love of the public, only to be wiped out entirely. Embarrassed, the military had the corpses embalmed and placed in a museum filled with falsified tales of their heroics for propaganda purposes, allowing time to erase the team&#x27;s failures. They were eventually revived by Black Scarab as zombies, and proceeded to torture and murder the German and Asian-American tourists visiting the museum, believing themselves to be in an alternate universe where the Axis won the war. They then fight Marshal Law, who wipes them out with his superior technology and a tank on display at the museum, all while berating them for their hypocrisy and self-absorption. The few remaining members revive the normal soldiers buried on the grounds of the museum to try and get back-up, only to be ripped apart by them, as the vengeful soldiers had died because of the heroes&#x27; cowardice. The only members of the team to survive were the original Public Spirit and his sidekick/lover Private Dick, as they cryogenically froze themselves to be together forever.

<doc id="839134" wikidata="Q151335" url="?curid=839134" title="Butene">
<text>Butene, also known as butylene, is an alkene with the formula . The word &quot;butene&quot; may refer to any of the individual compounds. They are colourless gases that are present in crude oil as a minor constituent in quantities that are too small for viable extraction. Butene is therefore obtained by catalytic cracking of long-chain hydrocarbons left during refining of crude oil. Cracking produces a mixture of products, and the butene is extracted from this by fractional distillation.

Butene can be used as the monomer for polybutene, but this polymer is more expensive than alternatives with shorter carbon chains such as polypropylene. Polybutene is therefore used in more specialized applications. Butenes are more commonly used to make copolymer (mixed with another monomer such as ethylene).

Butenes are major constituents of raffinates, the C4 fractions in oil processing. The raffinates containing butadiene are considered carcinogenic and mutagenic. They can be used as feedstocks for further processing (e. g., on alkylation units), or used as industrial fuel. Their mixing into LPG for nonindustrial uses sometimes occurs but is generally prohibited.

==Isomers==
Among the molecules which have the chemical formula four isomers are alkenes. All four of these hydrocarbons have four carbon atoms and one double bond in their molecules, but have different chemical structures. The IUPAC and common names, respectively, of these chemical compounds are:
In the chemical structures above, the small blue numbers in the structure images are the numbering of the atoms in the main backbone chain of the molecules. Other organic compounds have the formula C4H8, namely cyclobutane and methylcyclopropane, but are not alkenes and do not fall under the name &quot;butene&quot;. There are also cyclic alkenes with four carbon atoms overall such as cyclobutene and two isomers of methylcyclopropene, but they do not have the formula C4H8 and are not discussed here.
