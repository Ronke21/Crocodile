<text>Rupp Arena at Central Bank Center is an arena located in downtown Lexington, Kentucky, United States. Since its opening in 1976, it has been the centerpiece of Central Bank Center (formerly Lexington Center), a convention and shopping facility owned by an arm of the Lexington-Fayette Urban County Government, which is located next to the Lexington Hyatt and Hilton hotels. Rupp Arena also serves as home court to the University of Kentucky men&#x27;s basketball program, and is named after legendary former Kentucky coach Adolph Rupp with an official capacity of 20,500. In 2014 and 2015, in Rupp Arena, the Kentucky Wildcats men&#x27;s basketball team was second in the nation in college basketball home attendance. Rupp Arena also regularly hosts concerts, conventions and shows.

==History==
The arena&#x27;s primary tenant is the Kentucky Wildcats men&#x27;s basketball team, with the Kentucky Wildcats women&#x27;s basketball team hosting rivalry and power program opponent games at the venue in recent years. Rupp Arena was the host of the 1985 NCAA Final Four, won in an upset by eighth-seeded Villanova. It also formerly hosted the Kentucky Thoroughblades (currently the San Jose Barracuda) (capacity 10,011) and the Lexington Men O&#x27; War (capacity 7,500) minor-league hockey teams, and the Lexington Horsemen arena football team (capacity 7,550), numerous concerts (theater capacity 2,300; concert hall 10,000; arena capacity 20,500 approx.), conventions, and other events. It is named after University of Kentucky coaching legend Adolph Rupp, and opened in 1976, a little more than a year before Rupp&#x27;s death in late 1977. Since the 1985 Final Four, Rupp Arena has hosted a number of NCAA Tournament regional games, most recently in 2013 when it hosted second and third round NCAA Tournament games. Rupp Arena is also home to Kentucky&#x27;s high school boys&#x27; basketball Sweet Sixteen, a single-elimination tournament which determines the state champion with sixteen teams representing each of Kentucky&#x27;s regional high school champions.

On January 27, 2020, it was announced that Lexington Center&#x27;s overall naming rights were sold to Central Bank, a local community bank, by the Lexington Center Corporation and JMI Sports, which handles the multimedia rights for both the LCC and the University of Kentucky. The Rupp name will continue to receive primacy in the fourteen-year agreement for the arena portion of the complex, and be known as &quot;Rupp Arena at Central Bank Center&quot;. Floor signage indicating the new naming arrangement was installed on Rupp Arena&#x27;s basketball floor in time for the 2020–21 season.

==Kentucky Basketball at Rupp Arena==

===Fan support===
Enthusiastic fan participation has been central to the Kentucky Basketball experience for decades, both prior to and during the Rupp Arena years. Crowds at Rupp Arena are usually full and enthusiastic, particularly for rivalry games (e.g., Louisville, Tennessee, and formerly, Indiana) and against Blue Blood opponents (e.g., North Carolina, Kansas).

Kentucky fans are passionate in their support, but also have a long-standing tradition of giving standing ovations near the end of games to opponents who turn in exceptional performances. These opponents include David Robinson, Billy Cunningham, Austin Carr, Pete Maravich, Bubba Parnham, Chris Jackson, Shaquille O&#x27;Neal, Elston Turner Jr., Lawrence Roberts, and Freeman Williams.

Fans take pride in never having rushed the court after a Kentucky victory, a nod to their generally lofty expectations of the program and perception that no Kentucky victory is ever truly an upset. Season tickets remain in high demand. Fans report that it can take more than 20 years to improve their seat location by just a few rows. Owing to the constant demand for tickets, seating at Rupp Arena for Kentucky games is notable for having very few students near the floor.

Kentucky fans additionally take pride in the fact that their standard for team banner-hanging is very high. They typically only hang banners for teams who reached the Final Four. They additionally take pride in not hanging banners for non-competitive championships, such as Helms Titles.

Kentucky fans often identify the following contests as being among the loudest in Rupp Arena history:

*1979 vs. Kansas (Dwight Anderson and Kyle Macy spark a miraculous late comeback)
*1981 vs. LSU (Before the game LSU center Greg Cook quipped &quot;Kentucky ain&#x27;t nothin&#x27; but a name.&quot; Legendary play by play announcer Cawood Ledford opened his broadcast saying, &quot;Them&#x27;s fighting&#x27; words.&quot; Kentucky beat #2 LSU on Senior Day, featuring Sam Bowie&#x27;s half-court alley-oop dunk and game saving block; LSU&#x27;s first SEC loss of the season. NBC commentator Al Maguire said the crowd was &quot;so loud, it&#x27;s scary.&quot;)
*1983 vs. Louisville (Regular attendees at Rupp Arena say this and the 1981 LSU contest were the two most frenzied game-time atmospheres in the history of the Rupp Arena; two top-10 teams battled it out, with Kentucky prevailing, avenging their &quot;Dream Game&quot; loss to Louisville the year before).
*1984 vs. Houston (Kentucky beats eventual National Runner-Up Houston and Hakeem Olajuwon)
*1990 vs. LSU (Overmatched, on probation, and scholarship-decimated Kentucky beats an LSU team featuring Chris Jackson, Shaquille O&#x27;Neal, and Stanley Roberts)
*1990 vs. Kansas (Kentucky exacts revenge for a humiliating loss to Kansas the year before; a 20–0 run inside 10 minutes electrified the crowd; ESPN&#x27;s Larry Conley remarked &quot;Now I know what those people felt like when they went up against the lions at the Roman Coliseum.&quot;)
*1992 vs. Tennessee (Senior Day for Kentucky&#x27;s famed &quot;The Unforgettables&quot; and Cawood Ledford&#x27;s final home game; a 3-point barrage by Kentucky and a scuffle between Sean Woods and a Tennessee player energized the fans)
*1998 vs. Maryland (Kentucky rattles hotshot Steve Francis after he and Kentucky&#x27;s Jamaal Magloire traded barbs in the newspapers in the weeks leading up to the game)
*2001 vs. North Carolina (Tayshaun Prince hits five 3-pointers in a row; his fifth basket from near the logo at center court marked what is likely the loudest single moment in Rupp Arena history; Bill Raftery of CBS exclaimed &quot;Tayshaun is not a prince, he&#x27;s a king.&quot;)
*2001 vs. Louisville (A frenzied crowd lays in to Rick Pitino on his return to Rupp as coach of the Cardinals)
*2003 vs. Florida (Kentucky blows out #1 Florida; ESPN&#x27;s Dick Vitale remarked &quot;What a way to be number #1, to come to Rupp Arena.&quot;)
*2011 vs. North Carolina (Anthony Davis blocks John Henson&#x27;s would-be game winner)

===Traditions===
In addition to impassioned support, other Rupp Arena Kentucky Basketball traditions include

*Fans congregating in the lobby area of the adjacent Hyatt Regency Hotel and other downtown restaurants, a basketball variation on football tailgating.
*Cheering extra loudly for Kentucky players who are from Kentucky.
*The famous &quot;C-A-T-S, Cats, Cats, Cats&quot; and &quot;Go Big Blue&quot; cheers.
*The &quot;Y&quot;: After the Kentucky Cheerleaders spell out the &quot;K-E-N-T-U-C-K&quot; of &quot;Kentucky&quot;, a mystery celebrity will come onto the court making the &quot;Y&quot; shape by holding both arms in the air, with enthusiastic applause. Previous &quot;Y&quot; guests have included former Kentucky players, and celebrities, such as LeBron James
*Waking up early and filling Rupp Arena for Big Blue Madness and College Gameday experiences.

===Cheerleading squad===
The Kentucky Cheerleading squad is the most successful in the history of competitive collegiate cheerleading, having won 23 titles and 25 co-ed titles as of 2022. Kentucky has won more UCA Division-1 cheerleading titles than all other universities combined. Their most iconic stunt is the &quot;2001: A Space Odyssey Theme&quot;, a rotating pyramid performed in conjunction with the pep band for decades.

===Pep Band===
The University of Kentucky Pep Band is one of the largest in the nation and is an essential part of the Kentucky basketball gameday experience. The band traditionally plays the opening bars of &quot;The Lone Ranger Theme&quot; leading into &quot;On, On, U of K&quot; (Kentucky&#x27;s official fight song) just prior to tipoff, and a single trumpet player sounding the &quot;Call to the Post&quot; seconds before the jump ball. Kentucky&#x27;s secondary fight song, &quot;Kentucky Fight&quot;, is typically played in the pre-game, during the second half, or, on occasion, when the team is struggling. Other favorites through the years have been covers of &quot;Hold On, I&#x27;m Coming&quot;, &quot;Thriller&quot;, &quot;Back in the &quot;U.S.S.R.&quot;, &quot;Leapfrog&quot;, &quot;Hey Baby&quot;, &quot;Blue Moon of Kentucky&quot;, and &quot;Rock n Roll, Part 2&quot;. At game&#x27;s end, the band always plays Stephen Foster&#x27;s &quot;My Old Kentucky Home&quot;, the Kentucky state song.

==Seating arrangement==
The arena has an official capacity for basketball of 20,545 following a 2019 renovation project that was part of a larger renovation and expansion of Lexington Center. The most significant change to the arena was the installation of chairback seats in about half of the upper seating bowl.

Before the 2019 renovation, the official capacity was 23,500, but because of the former all-bleacher configuration of the upper seating bowl, it was able to pack in more than 24,000 for many UK basketball games. The lower bowl also incorporates a student standing-room area called the &quot;eRUPPtion Zone&quot; behind one goal. Unlike many arenas built in the following years, it has no luxury suites, and has never been renovated to add them. However, in 2001, the arena received some minor renovations including four oversized video boards, new lower bowl seating, new locker rooms, and a new court.

==Milestones==
*The first act to perform at Rupp Arena was Lawrence Welk on October 17, 1976. The performance attracted 20,000 people to the newly opened facility.
*Rupp Arena was set to host Elvis Presley live in concert on August 23, 1977. However, Presley died on August 16, exactly one week before the concert was scheduled.
*The ceremonial first basket in the new facility was sunk by Adolph&#x27;s young grandson Chip (Adolph III), who went on to play college basketball at Southeastern Conference (SEC) rival Vanderbilt.
*Rupp Arena is the home court of the Kentucky Wildcats men&#x27;s basketball team, which boasts an overall record in Rupp Arena of 529-64 (.892) since beginning play there on November 27, 1976. The court itself is named Cawood&#x27;s Court after longtime University of Kentucky football and men&#x27;s basketball radio broadcaster Cawood Ledford.
*Rupp staged three Southeastern Conference men&#x27;s basketball tournaments between 1982 and 1993; it was also the host of the Ohio Valley Conference men&#x27;s basketball tournament in 1992 and 1993.

*The Rupp Arena attendance record was set on January 2, 2010, when 24,480 people watched #3 Kentucky play rival Louisville. The final score was a 71–62 victory by the Kentucky Wildcats. 

*The UK men are the only basketball program in the SEC that plays home games in an off-campus facility. All of the other programs play on campus, including the UK women, who play in the men&#x27;s former home of Memorial Coliseum. However, when the women&#x27;s program expects an unusually large crowd, it will shift an occasional game to Rupp.
*Rupp is also home to the annual KHSAA State Basketball Championship, known and trademarked as the Sweet Sixteen, with 16 boys&#x27; basketball teams from throughout the commonwealth appearing for a shot at the state title.

*On January 28, 2017, with #4 Kentucky hosting #2 Kansas at Rupp Arena, the &quot;Guinness Book of World Records&quot; measured the loudest indoor crowd roar at 126.4 dB. It lasted 17 days before Guinness recorded a roar of 130.4 dB at Allen Fieldhouse when West Virginia played at Kansas.
* The majority of the home games during the 2023-2024 Kentucky women&#x27;s basketball season, as well as all home gymnastics and volleyball matches in 2023–2024, were moved to Rupp Arena. This was due to ongoing renovations to Memorial Coliseum.

<text>John Williams Walker (August 12, 1783April 23, 1823) was an American politician, who served as the Democratic-Republican United States senator from the state of Alabama, the first senator elected by that state.

==Life and career==
Walker was born August 12, 1783, in Amelia County, Virginia, of Scots-Irish heritage, the son of Rev. Jeremiah Walker and Mary Jane Graves. He was educated at the prestigious Willington Academy of Dr. Moses Waddel near Petersburg, Georgia, and received degrees in 1806 and 1809 from Princeton University. He studied law and was admitted to the bar at Petersburg.

In 1808, Walker married Matilda Pope, daughter of LeRoy Pope and Judith Sale, and in 1810, he followed his father-in-law to settle in the new town of Huntsville, Mississippi Territory (now Alabama), and there began the practice of law.

Upon the formation of the Alabama Territory in 1817, Walker served as a representative from Madison County to the first territorial legislature in 1818. In the second session, he served as speaker. In 1819, he was president of the convention that framed Alabama&#x27;s first constitution, which enabled Alabama&#x27;s admission to the United States.

On October 28, 1819, Walker was elected by an almost unanimous vote of the state legislature as the first United States senator from Alabama. He served from December 14, 1819, until his resignation on December 12, 1822, on account of his failing health. He died in Huntsville on April 23, 1823, and is buried in Maple Hill Cemetery. Walker County, Alabama, established December 20, 1824, is named in his honor.

Walker was the father of LeRoy Pope Walker, Confederate secretary of war and brigadier general; Richard Wilde Walker, Confederate States senator; Percy Walker, United States representative; and several other children. He was also the grandfather of Richard Wilde Walker, Jr., Alabama Supreme Court Justice and a judge in the 5th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals, and American diplomat John Walker Fearn, who served as Minister of Serbia, Romania and Greece from 1885 to 1889.

<text>Noah Webster&#x27;s 1833 limited revision of the King James Version, (more commonly called Webster Bible) focused mainly on replacing archaic words and making simple grammatical changes. For example: &quot;why&quot; instead of &quot;wherefore&quot;, &quot;its&quot; instead of &quot;his&quot; when referring to nonliving things, &quot;male child&quot; instead of &quot;manchild&quot;, etc. He also introduced euphemisms to remove words which he found to be offensive: &quot;whore&quot; becomes &quot;lewd woman&quot;. He changed some of the spelling of the 1611 version, some of which had been changed by British usage since 1611 and others that he himself had deliberately changed in his dictionary to reflect an &quot;American&quot; identity over a British one. Overall, very few changes were made, and the result is a book which is almost indistinguishable from the King James Version. It has sometimes been called the Common Version (which is not to be confused with the Common Bible of 1973, an ecumenical edition of the Revised Standard Version).

Modern critics are surprised by just how little Webster changed the King James Version. His revision was very light, as he did not want to make the language wholly contemporary, but rather wanted to correct flaws he disagreed with as an educator. Other, less orthodox Americans were bringing out their own versions of the New Testament, but he had no interest in theologically motivated changes. One notable change that was beyond just revising language flaws was a correction changing the word &quot;Easter&quot; in Acts 12:4 to the word &quot;Passover&quot;.

Throughout Webster&#x27;s Revision of the King James Bible, the lexicographer replaced &quot;Holy Ghost&quot; with &quot;Holy Spirit&quot;. Webster did so because he knew that in the Christians&#x27; Scriptures this expression did not mean &quot;an apparition&quot;. In the preface of his Bible, Webster wrote: &quot;Some words have fallen into disuse; and the signification of others, in current popular use, is not the same now as it was when they were introduced into the version. The effect of these changes is, that some words are not understood by common readers, who have no access to commentaries, and who will always compose a great proportion of readers; while other words, being now used in a sense different from that which they had when the translation was made, present a wrong signification or false ideas. Whenever words are understood in a sense different from that which they had been introduced, and different from that of the original languages, they do not present to the reader the Word of God.&quot;

The problem with the older books was confusion on the part of readers as the language styles had been evolving over the years and a lot of meaning of the text in this Bible was being lost on the average reader. Some passages were misunderstood. Grammar had evolved as well and the above changes made an easier read while purifying the language and making it more delicate.

<text>Steve Young (July 12, 1942 – March 17, 2016) was an American country music singer, songwriter and guitarist, known for his song &quot;Seven Bridges Road&quot; (on &quot;Rock Salt &amp; Nails&quot; &amp; &quot;Seven Bridges Road&quot;). He was a pioneer of the country rock, Americana, and alternative country sounds, and he was also a vital force behind the outlaw movement. 

==Biography==
Born in Newnan, Georgia, United States, he grew up in Texas and Gadsden, Alabama, moving from place to place as his family looked for work. By the time he graduated high school, he was writing and playing songs that incorporated folk, blues, country, and gospel influences he absorbed while travelling throughout the South. In the late 1960s, he worked with Van Dyke Parks and was member of the psychedelic country band Stone Country.

Young wrote many songs, including &quot;Lonesome, On&#x27;ry and Mean&quot; (covered by Waylon Jennings) and &quot;Montgomery In the Rain&quot; (covered by Hank Williams, Jr.).

During the late 1970s, Young became a Buddhist and a vegetarian.

His best-known composition is &quot;Seven Bridges Road&quot;, which became a hit for Eagles after including a cover of it on their 1980 live album. Earlier covers of the song were done by Joan Baez, Tracy Nelson &amp; Mother Earth, Iain Matthews, Dolly Parton, and Rita Coolidge.

In 1984, Young charted the single &quot;It&#x27;s Not Supposed to Be That Way&quot; on RCA Records. It peaked at No. 84 on Hot Country Songs. In 1989, Young did a mini-tour in the Northwest with singer-songwriter Tim Otto, performing in Portland and Seattle. In 1991, Otto took the cover shot for Steve Young&#x27;s &quot;Solo/Live&quot; CD on Watermelon Records. Townes Van Zandt wrote the liner notes. The 1996 concert recording by Van Dyke Parks entitled &quot;&quot; (released in 1998) was headlined by Young, although he did not appear on the recordings.

In 1993, Young played a show in Lichtenvoorde, The Netherlands, with David Olney. This show then was recorded by SCR Productions. Olney&#x27;s track were released on his &quot;Live in Holland&quot; album in 1994. In 2019, an album of Young&#x27;s tracks was released, also titled &quot;Live in Holland&quot;. David Olney took care of the liner notes, and performed on a few tracks on harmonica.

Young suffered a head injury in an October 2015 fall and his health began to deteriorate. He died after a brief stay in a Nashville, Tennessee hospice, on March 17, 2016. He was 73.

<text>Napoleon I, Emperor of the French, has become a worldwide cultural icon generally associated with tactical brilliance, ambition, and political power. His distinctive features and costume have made him a very recognisable figure in popular culture.

He has been portrayed in many works of fiction, his depiction varying greatly with the author&#x27;s perception of the historical character. On the one hand, Napoleon has become a worldwide cultural icon who symbolises military genius and political power. For example, in the 1927 film &quot;Napoléon&quot;, young general Bonaparte is portrayed as a heroic visionary. On the other hand, he has often been reduced to a stock character and has frequently been depicted as a short and &quot;petty tyrant&quot;, sometimes comically so.

==Literature, theatre, and film==
Napoleon plays an indirect yet utterly important part in Alexandre Dumas&#x27; novel &quot;The Count of Monte Cristo&quot;. The novel starts in 1815 with Napoleon exiled on the island of Elba. Here we learn that he hands a letter to the protagonist Edmond Dantès to give to one of his chief (fictional) supporters in Paris - Noirtier De Villefort, the president of a Bonapartist club. Dantès is unaware that Villefort is an agent of the exiled Emperor and that the letter Napoleon handed him contained instructions and plans about Napoleon&#x27;s planned return to Paris. Dantès&#x27; rivals include Mr. Danglars, his long-time unspoken rival and shipmate, who first reports Dantès to the authorities as a Bonapartist, and Gérard De Villefort, the opportunistic son of Noirtier and staunch royalist, who, in order to protect his father from being outed as a Bonapartist, burns the letter and uses its former existence to frame Dantès and have him imprisoned in the Château d&#x27;If until his escape after 14 years and seeks vengeance upon those who wronged him.

Napoleon features prominently in the BBC &quot;Doctor Who&quot; &quot;Past Doctor Adventure&quot; &quot;World Game&quot;, in which the Second Doctor must avert a plot to change history so that Napoleon is victorious. In an alternate timeline created by the assassination of the Duke of Wellington prior to Waterloo, Napoleon is persuaded to march on to Russia after the victory at Waterloo, but he dies shortly afterwards, his empire having become so overextended that the various countries collapse back into the separate nations they were before, thus degenerating into a state of perpetual warfare. (This situation is made worse due to the intervention of the Doctor&#x27;s old enemies the Players).

In 2013, Applied Mechanics produced &quot;Vainglorious&quot;, an epic, 26-actor immersive performance with Mary Tuomanen portraying Napoleon.

==Recurring themes and stereotypes in popular culture==
===Napoleon&#x27;s height===
British political cartoons of the period depicted Napoleon as a short man and the image of him as being short continues to be widespread today. Confusion has sometimes arisen because of different values for the French inch (&quot;pouce&quot;) of the time (2.7 cm) and for the Imperial inch (2.54 cm).; he has been cited as being from , which made him the height of the average French male at that time, and up to tall, which is above average for the period. British Rear-Admiral Frederick Lewis Maitland, who had daily contact with Napoleon on Maitland&#x27;s ship for twenty-three days in 1815, states in his memoirs that he was about . Some historians believe that the reason for the mistake about his size at death came from use of an obsolete French yardstick. Napoleon was a champion of the metric system (introduced in France in 1799) and had no use for the old yardsticks. It is more likely that he was , the height he was measured at on St. Helena, since he would have most likely been measured with an English yardstick rather than a yardstick of the Old French Regime.

Napoleon&#x27;s nickname of &quot;le petit caporal&quot; has added to the confusion, as some non-Francophones have mistakenly interpreted &quot;petit&quot; by its literal meaning of &quot;small&quot;. In fact, it is an affectionate term reflecting on his camaraderie with ordinary soldiers. Napoleon also surrounded himself with the soldiers of his elite guard, required to be 1.83 m (6 ft) or taller, making him look smaller in comparison.

Napoleon&#x27;s name has been lent to the Napoleon complex, a colloquial term describing an alleged type of inferiority complex which is said to affect some people who are physically short. The term is used more generally to describe people who are driven by a perceived handicap to overcompensate in other aspects of their lives.

===The Napoleon Delusion===
Napoleon Bonaparte is one of the most famous individuals in the Western world. As delusional patients sometimes believe themselves to be an important or grandiose figure (see delusion), a patient claiming to be Napoleon has been a common stereotype in popular culture for delusions of this nature.

* In the 1922 film &quot;Mixed Nuts&quot;, Stan Laurel plays a book salesman whose only volume for sale is a biography of Napoleon. When the character receives a blow to the head, he comes to believe that he is Napoleon and is subsequently admitted to a mental institution.
* In the 1925 Fleischer movie &quot;Ko-ko Nuts&quot;, Koko the Clown goes to an asylum, where there is a whole Napoleon department for people who think they&#x27;re Napoleon.

This &quot;cliché&quot; has itself been parodied:
* In the Bugs Bunny film &quot;Napoleon Bunny-Part&quot;, the actual Napoleon is dragged away by psychiatric attendants, who believe he is delusional.
* The song &quot;They&#x27;re Coming to Take Me Away, Ha-Haaa!&quot; was recorded by Jerry Samuels billed as Napoleon XIV. Some other versions of the song were made with lyrics referencing the Napoleon delusion (such as a Spanish version entitled &quot;Soy Napoleon&quot;) or with the artist&#x27;s name referencing a fictitious emperor. 
* In &quot;The Emperor&#x27;s New Clothes&quot;, Ian Holm plays Napoleon who stumbles into the grounds of an asylum and finds himself surrounded by other &quot;Napoleons&quot; - he cannot reveal his identity for fear of being grouped with the deluded. Holm also played a less-than-serious Napoleon in the 1981 film &quot;Time Bandits&quot;.
* The Discworld novel &quot;Making Money&quot; features a character who believes himself to be Lord Vetinari, imitating Vetinari&#x27;s mannerisms and entertaining delusions of grandeur. It is later revealed that the local hospital has an entire ward for people with the same delusion, where they engage in competitions to determine who is the &quot;real&quot; Vetinari.
* In an episode of cult 1960s British TV sci-fi show &quot;The Prisoner&quot; called &quot;The Girl Who Was Death&quot;, which unusually for the series was a light-hearted comedy tale parodying the spy thriller genre, the villain Dr. Schnipps (Kenneth Griffith) believed that he was Napoleon and acted accordingly, at one point asking the protagonist Number Six (Patrick McGoohan), &quot;You&#x27;re not the Duke of Wellington, are you?&quot;
* In the first episode of season 2 of &quot;Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles&quot; titled &quot;Return of the Shredder&quot; (1988), Scientist and Inventor, Baxter Stockman is seen in a jail cell with a man in Napoleonic garb spouting off dialogue in a French accent.
* In an episode of &quot;Night Court&quot;, Judge Harry Stone (Harry Anderson) is placed in a jail cell along with a number of &#x27;mentally disturbed&#x27; inmates all dressed as Napoleon. His court defence attorney (played by Markie Post) sees him and exclaims &quot;Oh sir. They put you in with the little generals&quot;.
* The award-winning video game &quot;Psychonauts&quot; features a mental patient, Fred Bonaparte, locked in an obsessive mind-game with his distant ancestor Napoleon, who is fighting for his mind.
* In the &quot;Futurama&quot; episode &quot;Insane in the Mainframe&quot;, Bender pretends to be a banjo-playing Napoleon in order to stay in a robot asylum.

<doc id="843714" wikidata="Q2860827" url="?curid=843714" title="Arena Manawatu">
<text>Central Energy Trust Arena is the current name of the 180,000 square meter publicly owned recreational complex just west of the Palmerston North city center in the Manawatū-Whanganui region of New Zealand.

It has three linked indoor stadiums with movable tiered seating. Outdoor facilities include football fields and a speedway track with a grandstand.

In June 2015, FMG Insurance chose not to renew the sponsorship deal for the main stadium name.

==History==
Originally founded in 1886 as the Palmerston North Showgrounds, its pavilion burnt down in a fire in 1977. It was replaced with a new stand, and the ground was reopened in 1981 as the Manawatu Sports Stadium. Since 1973 it has been owned by the Palmerston North City Council.

==Arena 1: Central Energy Trust Arena ==
===Capacity===
Central Energy Trust Arena has a capacity of 15,000. Temporary seating is added for major events, allowing the capacity to reach 20,000.

Central Energy Trust Arena is home to Manawatu Rugby. It is the home ground of the Manawatu Turbos, and also generally hosts one club game per week. Playing in the Air New Zealand Cup, crowd attendances at Turbos&#x27; games have been among the highest in the competition, averaging 7,000 per game.

===History===
Central Energy Trust Arena was formerly known as Arena 1 and FMG Stadium. It was the venue for the first ever Super 12 rugby match in 1996, which was played by the Wellington Hurricanes and the Auckland Blues.

The stadium was the host of the 1987 Rugby World Cup game between Wales and Tonga on 29 May. Wales won 29–16.

The ground was a venue for the British &amp; Irish Lions on the 2005 British &amp; Irish Lions tour to New Zealand with a game against Manawatu Turbos on 28 June.

On 28 March 2009, The Highlanders played a Super Rugby &#x27;home&#x27; game at Central Energy Trust Arena against the Bulls. The game attracted a large crowd of over 10,000—one of the Highlanders&#x27; biggest of the 2009 season.

On 4 September 2011, The Manawatu Turbos hosted the Hawkes Bay Magpies in the ITM Championship Cup Final at Central Energy Trust Arena. Crowd attendance was 13,100.

The stadium hosted two pool games in the 2011 Rugby World Cup, in which New Zealand was the host nation. With the city&#x27;s central location, large student population, the stadium&#x27;s close proximity to the CBD, International Pacific College, as well as the New Zealand Rugby Institute (a facility which the All Blacks used to use), the idea of basing a team and having a pool game in Palmerston North was attractive.

On 18 March 2016, The Hurricanes played another Super Rugby &#x27;home&#x27; game at Central Energy Trust Arena against the Western Force. The game attracted a crowd of over 8,000.

===Rugby league===
The stadium hosted its first rugby league test match when New Zealand lost to Great Britain 11–10 on 24 June 1990 in front of 8,073 fans.

The stadium hosted New Zealand Kiwis&#x27; victory in their first rugby league test of the 1992 Great Britain Lions tour of Australia and New Zealand. In front of 11,548 fans, the Kiwis defeated Great Britain 15-14 after a late Daryl Halligan field goal.

Palmerston North also hosted the second game of the 1993 Trans-Tasman series against Australia, played on a water-logged ground after constant rain. Despite the arctic like conditions, an overflow crowd of 19,000 hardy fans saw the Mal Meninga led Aussies run out 16-8 winners.

Overall, the stadium hosted six test matches between 1990 and 1996. Its last test to date saw New Zealand defeat Great Britain 18–15 on 25 October 1996 in front of 12,000 fans.

=== Motorcycle speedway ===
The site has been used as a motorcycle speedway venue for many years. Originally known as Palmerston North Showgrounds speedway track, it hosted several important events, including a qualifying round of the Speedway World Championship in 1976, and the New Zealand Solo Championship in 1949, 1962, 1963, 1969 and 1975.

Today it is called the Robertson Holden International Speedway, with a track encircling the field. The national Teams Championships have been held there, early February, bringing racers from all over the country. The season starts mid-October and finishes by the start of May.

===Other sports===
The YoungHeart Manawatu association football team used to play at the ground, however they have since moved to Memorial Park, Palmerston North.

Central Energy Trust Arena hosted the Wellington Phoenix association football team in a home game against Sydney FC on 12 December 2009 in the Hyundai A-League.

Central Energy Trust Arena was twice host of Te Matatini nationwide Kapa haka competition.

==Arena 2==
Redeveloped in 2004, Arena 2 is a multipurpose indoor sporting facility, capable of holding exhibitions, conventions, and entertainment events. It has been the host of the Central Pulse home matches in Palmerston North and International netball fixtures between New Zealand and Australia; international motor shows; conferences and houses the home court to the Manawatu Jets who play in the New Zealand National Basketball League. The arena has also played host to international basketball, hosting the New Zealand Tall Blacks on occasions, including the FIBA Oceania Championship. For sponsorship reasons, the arena is known as the Fly Palmy Arena.

==Arenas 3, 5, and 6==
Arena 3 has a floor area of 2100 square metres and is an indoor sports centre. It has a capacity of 2,000 persons.

Arena 5 includes Bell Hall, Barber Hall, Waldegrave Lounge and gym.

Arena 6 has the Outdoor No. 2, 3 &amp; 4 sports grounds.

==B&amp;M Centre==
The B&amp;M Centre is a multipurpose indoor stadium.

== Military Use ==
The Palmerston North Showgrounds have had a long military association, which saw it recognised as a Place of Remembrance by the Palmerston North City Council and the New Zealand Poppy Places Trust in 2019.

From the early 1900s, the Palmerston North Showgrounds was the venue for various Military Tournaments, with Boxing Day Military displays popular with the local community. Examples of Military Tournaments held at the Palmerston North Showgrounds were:

* 2 February 1901, the Imperial Representative Corps paraded in the Square with the Manawatu Mounted Rifles and the Palmerston North Rifles.  The parade concluded at the Showgrounds with military displays.
* 9 November 1908, The Wellington Engineer Volunteers participated in a Military Tournament at the show grounds, where they engaged in an improvised bridge-building display.
* 3 January 1911, a large Naval and Military Tournament took place at the Palmerston North Showgrounds with crowds numbering 7,000 to 8,000.

During the 1st World War, the showgrounds were used as a remount depot for the New Zealand Mounted Rifles and as a stop-over location for men passing through Palmerston North as they transited to other various military camps around New Zealand.

On 19 July 1919, the showgrounds were the venue for Palmerston Norths celebrations marking the end of World War One. After a parade around the Square followed by speeches watched by a crowd of about 7,000 including 800 children from all the local schools.

During the Second World War, the Showgrounds were requisitioned for military use for the duration of the war by the New Zealand Army, and was by the following units:

* The 28th (Māori) Battalion was formed at the Showgrounds on 25 January 1940, and after initial training for three months en-trained at the Palmerston North Railway Station on 2 May 1940 for overseas service,
* The Manawatu Mounted Rifles,
* Headquarters 2 Brigade,
* Headquarters 4 Division,
* No 2 Company, New Zealand Army Service Corps, and 
* No 2 Ordnance Sub Depot, New Zealand Army Ordnance Corps from 1942 to 1945.

On 31 December 1944 a large fire occurred in the building occupied by Ordnance Depot, destroying Halls 1, 2, and 3 and causing stock losses of £225,700 ($18,639,824.86 at 2018 value), including around 1500 Charlton Automatic Rifles, a successful New Zealand conversion of obsolete Lee–Metford and Lee–Enfield rifles into an automatic rifle.

<text>Gráinne (), sometimes anglicised Grania, is the daughter of king Cormac mac Airt in the Fianna Cycle of Irish mythology. She is one of the central figures in the Middle Irish text &quot;Finn and Gráinne&quot;, as well as the 17th-century tale &quot;The Pursuit of Diarmuid and Gráinne&quot;, which tells of her betrothal to Fionn mac Cumhaill, leader of the Fianna, and her subsequent elopement with Fionn&#x27;s warrior Diarmuid Ua Duibhne.

==History==
In &quot;The Pursuit of Diarmuid and Gráinne&quot;, Gráinne was promised in marriage to Fionn but, repulsed by his age, she forms a relationship with Diarmuid at their betrothal party. At first he refuses out of loyalty to Fionn but she places a &quot;geis&quot; upon him to run away with her. Their long flight from Fionn is aided by Diarmuid&#x27;s foster-father Aengus Óg. Eventually, Fionn pardons Diarmuid after Aengus intercedes on their behalf; the pair settle in Kerry and produce five children. Years later Diarmuid is wounded by a boar while hunting with Fionn, who stalls in healing him until it is too late; texts vary on Gráinne&#x27;s subsequent actions. In some versions, she mourns her husband until she dies herself; in others, she swears her sons to avenge their father&#x27;s death on Fionn. In still others, she forgives Fionn or even marries him.

According to the historian Peter Berresford Ellis, &quot;[Fionn Mac Cumhail] had many loves during his career but none is better known than his unrequited love for Gráinne. He was elderly when [the High King] Cormac Mac Art gave his daughter Gráinne to him in marriage. But before the ceremony, Gráinne eloped with one of Fionn’s warriors, Diarmuid Ua Duibhne. ‘The Pursuit of Diarmuid and Gráinne’ is one of the classic love tales and a major epic of the Fenian Cycle.&quot; Ellis goes on to say: &quot;Gráinne’s character is always drawn with consistency in the myths. She is a shallow person, wilful, ruthless and passionate, and what in modern terms would be described as a neurotic.&quot;

The story of Gráinne and Diarmuid is one of a number of instances in Irish mythology of a love triangle between a young man, a young woman and an aging suitor, the other most famous instance being between Naoise, Deirdre and Conchobar mac Nessa in the Ulster Cycle. The same theme also shows up in other cultures, notably in the Arthurian legend. &quot;The Pursuit of Diarmuid and Gráinne&quot; shares a number of similarities with the story of Tristan and Iseult, and to a certain extent the love affair of Lancelot and Guinevere.
The LÉ &quot;Gráinne&quot; (CM10), a decommissioned ship in the Irish Naval Service, was named after Gráinne.

In the 1999 Irish dance show &quot;Dancing on Dangerous Ground&quot; Gráinne is played by former Riverdance star Jean Butler.

Rath Gráinne at the Hill of Tara in Ireland is named after her.

<text>Zust (originally Züst) was an Italian car manufacturing company operating from 1905 to 1917.

The company was founded by engineer Roberto Züst, an Italian industrialist of Swiss origin, who owned a precision tool manufacturing plant at Intra, near Lago Maggiore (formerly the Guller &amp; Croff iron foundry). Züst experimented with prototypes of cars from around 1900 on and in Milan in 1905, he founded the Zust company for manufacturing cars and commercial vehicles. His first models were huge and expensive machines propelled by four-cylinder engines from 7432 cc (454cuin) to 11308 cc (690cuin). These were joined by a slightly smaller 5-litre (305cuin) model in 1908. A Zust 28/45 HP participated in the 1908 New York to Paris Race and finished third. Giustino Cattaneo (later of Isotta Fraschini) worked for him.
In 1906 Züst decided to also make smaller cars, so with his five sons he founded a new company known as Brixia-Zust in the city of Brescia. (Zust and Brixia-Zust are often confused). Due to financial problems, Brixia-Zust closed down in 1912; the Milan factory was sold and production of Zust cars concentrated in Brescia, where production continued until 1914. The last new models, the 15/25 HP or 2S 365 (2592 cc/158cuin) and the 25/35 or S305 (4712  cc/288cuin), appeared in 1913.

On October 1, 1917, the company was taken over by Officine Meccaniche of Milan, who continued to make the S305 until 1923 under their own name.

==Brixia-Zust==

Brixia-Zust (originally Brixia-Züst) was an Italian car manufacturer also founded by engineer Roberto Züst, owner of Zust of Milan, and his sons. The company was situated in Brescia, Northern Italy; Brixia is the antique Latin for Brescia. The company made racing cars that participated in Targa Florio, an open road race in Sicily.

The most interesting model was the &quot;10 hp&quot; in 1909, propelled by a three-cylinder 1495 cc engine. Car production ended—due to financial difficulties—in 1912. In 1918, after Officine Meccaniche took over the Zust company, the Brescia facilities were used.

<text>Watershed districts are special government entities in the U.S. state of Minnesota that monitor and regulate the use of water in watersheds surrounding various lakes and rivers in the state. The districts cover the natural regions of the watersheds, rather than politically defined regions and thus may have boundaries that cross jurisdictions. They are run by a board of managers, who are appointed by commissions in the counties within the districts.

The districts were first authorized by Minnesota state legislation in 1955. As of November 2016 there are 45 districts in the state. District boards coordinate activities with the state, as well as with the counties, cities, and soil and water conservation districts within the watershed districts. In comparison with public bodies in other countries, watershed districts are most similar to the internal drainage boards of England and Wales, &quot;Waterschappen&quot; of the Netherlands, and &quot;Consorzi di bonifica e irrigazione&quot; of Italy.

<text>Air Force Special Operations Command (AFSOC), headquartered at Hurlburt Field, Florida, is the special operations component of the United States Air Force. An Air Force major command (MAJCOM), AFSOC is also the U.S. Air Force component command to United States Special Operations Command (USSOCOM), a unified combatant command located at MacDill Air Force Base, Florida. AFSOC provides all Air Force Special Operations Forces (SOF) for worldwide deployment and assignment to regional unified combatant commands.

Before 1983, Air Force special operations forces were primarily assigned to the Tactical Air Command (TAC) and were generally deployed under the control of U.S. Air Forces in Europe (USAFE) or, as had been the case during the Vietnam War, Pacific Air Forces (PACAF). Just as it had relinquished control of the C-130 theater airlift fleet to Military Airlift Command (MAC) in 1975, TAC relinquished control of Air Force SOF to MAC in December 1982.

AFSOC was initially established on 10 February 1983 as Twenty-Third Air Force (23 AF), a subordinate numbered air force of MAC, with 23 AF headquarters initially established at Scott Air Force Base, Illinois. On 1 August 1987, 23 AF headquarters moved to Hurlburt Field, Florida. AFSOC elements include Combat Controllers (CCT), Pararescuemen (PJ), Special Reconnaissance (SR), and Tactical Air Control Party (TACP).

== Personnel and resources ==

AFSOC has about 20,800 active-duty, Air Force Reserve, Air National Guard and civilian personnel.

The command&#x27;s SOF units are composed of highly trained, rapidly deployable airmen who are equipped with specialized aircraft. These forces conduct global special operations missions ranging from precision application of firepower, to infiltration, aviation foreign internal defense, exfiltration, resupply and aerial refueling of SOF operational elements.

In addition to the pilots, combat systems officers, and enlisted aircrew who fly AFSOC&#x27;s aircraft, there is a highly experienced support force of maintenance officers and enlisted aircraft maintenance personnel who maintain these complex aircraft and their support systems, a cadre of premier intelligence officers and enlisted intelligence specialists well versed in special operations, as well as logisticians, security forces and numerous other support officers and personnel.

Another aspect of AFSOC is Special Tactics, the U.S. Air Force&#x27;s special operations ground force. Similar in ability and employment to Marine Special Operations Command (MARSOC), U.S. Army Special Forces and U.S. Navy SEALs, Air Force Special Tactics personnel are typically the first to enter combat and often find themselves deep behind enemy lines in demanding, austere conditions, usually with little or no support.

The command&#x27;s Special Tactics Squadrons are led by Special Tactics Officers (STOs). Special Tactics Squadrons combine Combat Controllers, Tactical Air Control Party (TACP), Air Force Special Reconnaissance, Pararescuemen (PJs) and Combat Rescue Officers (CROs) to form versatile SOF teams. AFSOC&#x27;s unique capabilities include airborne radio and television broadcast for psychological operations, as well as combat aviation advisors to provide other governments military expertise for their internal development.

Due to the rigors of the career field, Special Tactics&#x27; year-long training is one of the most demanding in the military, with attrition rates between 80 and 90 percent. In an attempt to reduce the high attrition, Special Tactics is very selective when choosing their officers. Special Tactics Officers (STO) undergo a highly competitive process to gain entry into the Special Tactics career field, ensuring only the most promising and capable leaders are selected. STO leadership and role modeling during the difficult training reduces the attrition rate for enlisted trainees.

STO selection is a two-phase process. Beginning with Phase One, a board of veteran STOs reviews application packages consisting of letters of recommendation, fitness test scores, and narratives written by the applicants describing their career aspirations and reasons for applying. Based on Phase One performance, about eight to 10 applicants are invited to the next phase. Phase Two is a weeklong battery of evaluations, ranging from physical fitness and leadership to emotional intelligence and personality indicators. At the end of Phase Two, typically two to four applicants are selected to begin the year-plus Special Tactics training pipeline.

=== Future ===
New AC-130J and MC-130J aircraft based on the Lockheed Martin KC-130J Super Hercules tanker variant are being acquired and sent to certain AFSOC units. MC-130J aircraft have already entered service while the AC-130J continues developmental testing in preparation for an Initial Operational Capability (IOC) with AFSOC projected for FY 2017

==History==
=== Twenty-Third Air Force (23 AF) ===
In December 1982, the Air Force transferred responsibility for Air Force special operations from Tactical Air Command (TAC) to Military Airlift Command (MAC). Consequently, in March 1983, MAC activated Twenty-Third Air Force (23 AF) at Scott Air Force Base, Illinois. This new numbered air force&#x27;s responsibilities included worldwide missions of special operations, combat rescue, weather reconnaissance and aerial sampling, security support for intercontinental ballistic missile sites, training of USAF helicopter and HC-130 crewmen, pararescue training, and medical evacuation.

====Operation Urgent Fury====
In October 1983, 23 AF helped rescue Americans from the island nation of Grenada. During the seven-day operation, centered at Point Salines Airport, 23 AF furnished MC-130s, AC-130s, aircrews, maintenance, and support personnel. An EC-130 from the 193rd Special Operations Wing of the Air National Guard (ANG) also played a psy-war role. Lieutenant Colonel (later Major General) James L. Hobson Jr., an MC-130 pilot and commander of the 8th Special Operations Squadron, was later awarded the Mackay Trophy for his actions in leading the air drop on the Point Salines Airport.

====U.S. Special Operations Command====
In May 1986, the Goldwater-Nichols Department of Defense Reorganization Act led to the formation of the United States Special Operations Command. Senators William Cohen and Sam Nunn introduced the Senate bill, and the following month Congressman Dan Daniel introduced a like measure in the House of Representatives. The key provisions of the legislation formed the basis to amend the 1986 Defense Authorizations Bill. This bill, signed into law in October 1986, in part directed the formation of a unified command responsible for special operations. In April 1987, the DoD established the United States Special Operations Command (USSOCOM) at MacDill Air Force Base, Florida, and Army GEN James J. Lindsay assumed command. Four months later, 23 AF moved its headquarters from Scott AFB to Hurlburt Field, Florida.

In August 1989, Gen Duane H. Cassidy, USAF, CINCMAC, divested 23 AF of its non-special operations units, e.g., search and rescue, weather reconnaissance, etc. Thus, 23 AF served a dual role: still reporting to MAC, but also functioning as the air component to USSOCOM.

====Operation Just Cause====
From late December 1989 to early January 1990, 23 AF participated in the invasion of the Republic of Panama during Operation Just Cause. Special operations aircraft included both active duty AC-130H and Air Force Reserve AC-130A Spectre gunships, EC-130 Volant Solo psychological operations aircraft from the Air National Guard, HC-130P/N Combat Shadow tankers, MC-130E Combat Talons, and MH-53J Pave Low and MH-60G Pave Hawk helicopters. Special tactics Combat Controllers and Pararescuemen provided important support to combat units.

Spectre gunship crews of the 1 SOW earned the Mackay Trophy and Tunner Award for their efforts, with an Air Force Reserve AC-130A Spectre crew from the 919th Special Operations Group (919 SOG) earning the President&#x27;s Award. An active duty 1st SOW MC-130 Combat Talon crew ferried the captured Panamanian President, Manuel Noriega, to prison in the United States. Likewise, the efforts of the 1 SOW maintenance people earned them the Daedalian Award.

On 22 May 1990, General Larry D. Welch, USAF, the Chief of Staff of the Air Force, redesignated Twenty-Third Air Force as Air Force Special Operations Command (AFSOC). This new major command consisted of three wings: the 1st, 39th and 353rd Special Operations Wings as well as the 1720th Special Tactics Group (1720 STG), the U.S. Air Force Special Operations School, and the Special Missions Operational Test and Evaluation Center.

Currently, after major redesignations and reorganizations, AFSOC direct reporting units include the 16th Special Operations Wing, the 352nd Special Operations Group, the 353rd Special Operations Group, the 720th Special Tactics Group (720 STG), the USAF Special Operations School and the 18th Flight Test Squadron (18 FLTS). During the early 1990s a major reorganization occurred within AFSOC. The 1720 STG became the 720 STG in March 1992; the transfer of ownership of Hurlburt Field from Air Mobility Command (AMC, and formerly MAC) to AFSOC in October 1992, followed by the merger of the 834th Air Base Wing (834 ABW) into the 1 SOW, which assumed host unit responsibilities. A year later the 1 SOW became the 16 SOW in a move to preserve Air Force heritage.

Meanwhile, the Special Missions Operational Test and Evaluation Center (SMOTEC), which explored heavy lift frontiers in special operations capabilities, while pursuing better equipment and tactics development, was also reorganized. In April 1994, the Air Force, in an effort to standardize these types of organizations, redesignated SMOTEC as the 18th Flight Test Squadron (18 FLTS).

====Gulf War====
From early August 1990 to late February 1991, AFSOC participated in Operation Desert Shield and Operation Desert Storm, the protection of Saudi Arabia and liberation of Kuwait. Special tactics personnel operated throughout the theater on multiple combat control and combat rescue missions.
Special operations forces performed direct action missions, combat search and rescue, infiltration, exfiltration, air base ground defense, air interdiction, special reconnaissance, close air support, psychological operations, and helicopter air refuelings. Pave Low crews led the helicopter assault on radars to blind Iraq at the onset of hostilities, and they also accomplished the deepest rescue for which they received the Mackay Trophy.

MC-130E/H Combat Talons dropped the BLU-82, the largest conventional bombs of the war and, along with MC-130P Combat Shadows, dropped the most psychological warfare leaflets, while AC-130A and AC-130H Spectre gunships provided valuable fire support and armed reconnaissance. However, the AC-130 community also suffered the single greatest combat loss of coalition air forces with the shoot down of an AC-130H, call sign &quot;Spirit 03&quot;, by an Iraqi SA-7 Grail surface-to-air missile. All fourteen crew members aboard &quot;Spirit 03&quot; were killed.

====Post-Gulf War====
In December 1992, AFSOC special tactics and intelligence personnel supported Operation Restore Hope in Somalia. In late 1994, AFSOC units spearheaded Operation Uphold Democracy in Haiti, and in 1995 Operation Deliberate Force in the Balkans.

====Operation Enduring Freedom====

The terrorist attacks on the World Trade Center in New York City, and the Pentagon, Washington D.C., on 11 September 2001 pushed the United States special operations forces to the forefront of the war against terrorism. By the end of September 2001, AFSOC deployed forces to southwest Asia for Operation Enduring Freedom – Afghanistan to help destroy the al Qaeda terrorist organization and remove the Taliban regime in Afghanistan. AFSOC airpower delivered special tactics forces to the battle ground and they in turn focused U.S. airpower and allowed Afghanistan&#x27;s Northern Alliance ground forces to dispatch the Taliban and al Qaeda from Afghanistan. AFSOC personnel also deployed to the Philippines to help aid that country&#x27;s efforts against terrorism.

US Air Force Special Operations had a long-term presence in the Philippines during Operation Enduring Freedom – Philippines.

==== Operation Iraqi Freedom ====
In March 2003, AFSOC again deployed forces to southwest Asia this time in support of what would become Operation Iraqi Freedom – the removal of Saddam Hussein and his Baathist government. The command&#x27;s personnel and aircraft teamed with SOF and conventional forces to quickly bring down Saddam Hussein&#x27;s government by May 2003. AFSOC forces continued to conduct operations in support of the new Iraqi government against insurgents and terrorists.

==== Interoperability and Multinational trainings ====
The USAFSOC takes part in the multinational trainings at the King Abdullah II Special Operations Training Centre in which it trains in multiple scenarios with partner nations in order to increase interoperability between partner forces.

<doc id="843746" wikidata="Q1163136" url="?curid=843746" title="The Voyage of Máel Dúin">
<text>The Voyage of Máel Dúin (Old Irish: Immram Maele Dúin, Modern Irish: &#x27;Iomramh Maoile Dhúin&#x27;) is the tale of a sea voyage written in Old Irish around the end of the 1st millennium AD. The protagonist is Máel Dúin, the son of Ailill Edge-of-Battle, whose murder provides the initial impetus for the tale.

Alternative transliterations of the name include Maildun (Patrick Joyce&#x27;s translation) and Maeldune (Tennyson&#x27;s poem).

==Sources==
The story belongs to the group of Irish romances, the &quot;Navigations&quot; (&quot;Imrama&quot;), the common type of which was possibly drawn in part from the classical tales of the wanderings of Jason, Ulysses, and Aeneas.

The text exists in an 11th-century redaction, by a certain Aed the Fair, described as the &quot;chief sage of Ireland,&quot; but it may be gathered from internal evidence that the tale itself dates back to the 8th century. &quot;Imram Curaig Mailduin&quot; is preserved, in each case imperfectly, in the &quot;Lebor na hUidre&quot;, a manuscript in the Royal Irish Academy, Dublin; and in the &quot;Yellow Book of Lecan&quot;, MS. H. 216 in the Trinity College Library, Dublin; fragments are in Harleian MS. 5280 and Egerton MS. 1782 in the British Museum.

==Narrative==
===Early life===
Máel Dúin was the son of warrior chieftain Ailill Ochair Aghra. His mother was a nun raped by Ailill. Shortly after, Ailill was killed by marauders from Leix who burned a church down on him. His mother then fostered Máel Dúin with the Queen of Eoganacht. He grew into an attractive warrior who was &quot;victorious over everyone in every game they used to play, both in running and leaping and spear casting and casting stones and racing horses.&quot; A jealous youth exposed to him the truth of his unknown kindred, saying to Máel Dúin &quot;whose clan and kindred no one knows, whose mother and father no one knows, vanquish us in every game.&quot; All this time Máel Dúin thought he was the son of the king and queen. He refused to eat or drink with the king and queen until he was told who his birth mother was. The queen sent him to his biological mother who told him about the death of his father (Ch. I–).

He travelled to the graveyard of the church of Dubcluain where Briccne, a poison-tongued man of the community of the church, tells him that it is Máel Dúin&#x27;s duty to go out and avenge his father&#x27;s murder. Máel Dúin seeks the advice of a druid named Nuca at Corcomroe, who tells him how to find the murderers.

===Máel Dúin and his foster brothers===
Shortly after Máel Dúin and his crew set off on their voyage, they came across the harbour of his three stepbrothers. They call out to Máel Dúin, in hopes that Máel Dúin would allow them to enter his boat. Knowing he could not exceed the number of people on his boat per the druid&#x27;s advice, Máel Dúin responds, &quot;Get you home, for even though we should return (to land), only the number we have here shall go with me.&quot; Upon hearing Máel Dúin&#x27;s call, his foster brothers cried out, &quot;We will go after thee into the sea and be drowned therein, unless thou come unto us.&quot; Suddenly the foster brothers jumped out into the sea and began swimming far from land. Máel Dúin turned his boat around and allowed them on board, violating the number of allotted people on his boat.
They first encounter two bare islands with forts on them. From the forts can be heard &quot;noise and the outcry of drunkenness.&quot; Máel Dúin then hears one man say, &quot;It was I who slew Ailill Ochair of Agha and burned Dubcluain on him and no evil has been done to me for it yet by his kindred...&quot; Máel Dúin and his crew cannot venture to the island due to wind. He suggests that God will bring the boat where it needs to go. However, the boats sails into the limitless ocean. The presence of the foster brothers are blamed for the unfavorable winds.

===Islands encountered===
* The island of ants, from which the men flee because the ants&#x27; intention is to eat their boat
* The island of tame birds
* The island of the horse-like beast who pelts the crew with the beach
* The island of horses and demons
* The island of salmon, where they find an empty house filled with a feast and they all eat, drink, and give thanks to Almighty God.
* The island with the branch of an apple tree, where they are fed with apples for 40 nights

==Intertextuality==
Intertextuality is the relationship between texts, in the way similar or related texts influence, reflect, or differ from each other. The Voyage of Máel Dúin, contains motifs elected in other immrama such as: &quot;The Voyage of Bran&quot; and the Voyage of Saint Brendan.

*The Island of Joy in paragraph 61 of The Voyage of Bran may have inspired &quot;Máel Dúin&quot;&#x27;s Island of Uncontrollable Laughter.
* In both &quot;Máel Dúin&quot; and the &quot;Voyage of Brendan&quot; three additional people join the crew. Máel Dúin is joined by his foster brothers; Brendan by three extra monks. In both instances these additions upset the equilibrium of the voyage, and it is when the extra persons are no longer on board, can each voyage be completed. 
*Chapter 11 of Máel Dúin: On the island the crew finds a great fort and tall white pillars. The crew goes into the largest of the houses and finds it empty except for a cat playing on four stone pillars, leaping from one pillar to the next. They see many gold artifacts in the house, including golden necklets. One of the three foster brothers asks to take a golden necklet, to which Máel Dúin replies no. Nevertheless, he steals one anyway. “The cat followed them and leapt through him like a fiery arrow and burns him so that he became ashes.” This is similar to chapter 7 of The Voyage of Brendan when one of the late-coming monks takes a silver brooch despite Brendan&#x27;s warning and to paragraph 65 of The Voyage of Bran when one of the crew leaps from the ship and turns to ash once he touches dry land.
* Chapter 18 of Máel Dúin: The crew hears &quot;a great cry and chant&quot; coming from the north-east direction after they sail away from an island. They row for almost two days to find the sound, which is described as sounding like psalms being sung. Eventually, they locate the source, and discover a mountainous island full of colorful birds making loud noises. This event is similar to an event in the &quot;Voyage of Saint Brendan&quot;. Brendan and his crew also hear sounds like psalms being sung, and also discover an island full of birds. A major difference between the two events is that in Brendan&#x27;s tale, these birds are described as praising the Lord directly, whereas in Máel Dúin&#x27;s tale, the birds are initially described as making psalm like sounds, but ultimately are determined to be just &quot;shouting and speaking loudly&quot;. There is less of a religious influence found in the Máel Dúin version of the event compared to Brendan&#x27;s rendition.

==Christian elements==
Hans Oskamp suggests that &quot;Máel Dúin&quot; is the earliest imramm to use Christian and non-Christian elements indiscriminately. Elva Johnston pointed out that the delay caused by the extra passengers gives Máel Dúin time to reconsider his intended revenge, and is therefore instrumental in his salvation. Mael Dúin&#x27;s gratitude to God for preserving him in the face of the many dangers encountered on the voyage transcends his need for vengeance.

==Adaptions and derivative works==

*Tennyson&#x27;s &quot;Voyage of Maeldune&quot;, suggested by the Irish romance, borrows little more than its framework.
*Thomas Wentworth Higginson loosely adapted the tale into a short story &quot;Maelduin&#x27;s Voyage&quot; with &#x27;Maelduin&#x27; as an Irish Knight sent on a voyage by a wizard.
*Joseph Jacobs edited a faithful version of the tale suitable for children, illustrated by John D. Batten, in the &quot;Book of Wonder Voyages&quot;.
*&#x27;James&#x27; (John Morris) Reeves adapted and abridged Patrick W. Joyce&#x27;s 19th-century translation as a short children&#x27;s novel, &quot;Maildun the Voyager&quot; (Hamish Hamilton, 1971), illustrated by John Lawrence.
*Irish writer Patricia Aakhus created a novelised account of the story, &quot;The Voyage of Mael Duin&#x27;s Curragh&quot;, published 1989.
*&quot;A Celtic Odyssey&quot; by Michael Scott is a modern retelling of this story.
* Máel Dúin is the inspiration of &quot;Maeldun&quot;, a sorcerer mentioned in the &quot;Myth&quot; series of computer games.

<text>The Leopard ( ) is a novel by Italian writer Giuseppe Tomasi di Lampedusa, which chronicles the changes in Sicilian life and society during the &quot;Risorgimento&quot;. Published posthumously in 1958 by Feltrinelli, after two rejections by the leading Italian publishing houses Mondadori and Einaudi, it became the top-selling novel in Italian history and is considered one of the most important novels in modern Italian literature. In 1959, it won Italy&#x27;s highest award for fiction, the Strega Prize. In 2012, &quot;The Guardian&quot; named it as one of &quot;the 10 best historical novels&quot;. The novel was made into an award-winning 1963 film of the same name, directed by Luchino Visconti and starring Burt Lancaster, Claudia Cardinale and Alain Delon.

Tomasi was the last in a line of minor princes in Sicily. He had long contemplated writing a historical novel based on his great-grandfather, Don Giulio Fabrizio Tomasi, another Prince of Lampedusa. The Lampedusa Palace in Palermo, like the palace in the novel, was bombed during the Allied invasion of Sicily in 1943.

== Origins ==

Although Giuseppe Tomasi di Lampedusa was a prolific reader, until the last few years of his life he had written almost nothing for publication. He first conceived the book that became &quot;The Leopard&quot; in the 1930s but did not follow through on the idea at that time. According to Tomasi&#x27;s widow, Tomasi first conceived the novel as a story to take place over the course of one day in 1860, similar to James Joyce&#x27;s modernist 1922 novel &quot;Ulysses&quot;. In the end, only the first chapter conformed to this plan.

In 1954 Tomasi traveled with his cousin Lucio Piccolo, another late-in-life author, to a literary conference in San Pellegrino Terme. Piccolo had been invited on the basis of his recently published poetry, and brought Tomasi as a guest. Also attending were Eugenio Montale, and Emilio Cecchi, Shortly after this, he began writing; as he wrote in 1955, &quot;Being mathematically certain that I was no more foolish [than Lucio], I sat down at my desk and wrote a novel.&quot;

By June 1955 he completed a version of the first chapter, conforming to his original intention of a story set in a single 24-hour period in 1860. At this time, few people around him were aware that he was writing: he had always spent large amounts of time alone; those periods were now spent at his writing desk. He finally showed a four-chapter work in progress to close associates in early 1956, corresponding roughly to the first, second, seventh, and eight chapters of the eventual novel.

In May 1956, Tomasi sent a four-chapter typescript to Mondadori in Milan. That summer he wrote two more chapters (drafts of the third and fourth in the final version) and in October he sent these to Mondadori as well. Mondadori rejected the novel in December 1956, although their rejection left open the possibility of considering a future version of the same work. In early 1957 he wrote two more chapters (the eventual fifth and sixth), revised those he had already written, and sent typescripts to several people. With Tomasi&#x27;s permission, his student Francesco Orlando sent a copy to literary agent , daughter of Benedetto Croce, leaving the author anonymous. Another recipient, bookseller and publisher Fausto Flaccovio, liked the book but was not in the business of publishing fiction; he suggested sending it to Elio Vittorini; unsurprisingly, this rather traditional novel did not appeal to modernist Vittorini, who found it &quot;rather old-fashioned&quot; and &quot;essayish&quot;.

Eventually, the copy sent to Croce bore fruit, but not in Tomasi&#x27;s lifetime. In 1957, he was diagnosed with lung cancer; he died on 23 July 1957 in Rome. Elena Croce sent the manuscript to the writer Giorgio Bassani, who brought it to the publisher Feltrinelli. On 3 March 1958, Feltrinelli contacted Tomasi di Lampedusa&#x27;s widow to make arrangements to publish the novel. It was published in November 1958 and became a bestseller, going through 52 editions in less than six months. &quot;Il Gattopardo&quot; was quickly recognized as a great work of Italian literature. In 1959 Tomasi di Lampedusa was posthumously awarded the prestigious Strega Prize for the novel.

== Plot summary ==

Most of the novel is set during the time of the &quot;Risorgimento&quot;, specifically during the period when Giuseppe Garibaldi, the leader of the famous Redshirts, swept through Sicily with his proletarian army known as The Thousand.

As the novel opens in May 1860, Garibaldi&#x27;s Redshirts have landed on the Sicilian coast and are pressing inland; they will soon overthrow the Kingdom of the Two Sicilies and incorporate it into the unified Italian Kingdom under Victor Emmanuel. The plot focuses upon the aristocratic Salina family, which is headed by Prince Fabrizio. Don Fabrizio is the patriarch of the family as well as the keeper of its strict code of conduct and Roman Catholic ritual. Prince Fabrizio finds marriage with his overly puritanical wife to be physically unsatisfying, and thus keeps a series of mistresses and courtesans. He also indulges in his hobby of amateur astronomy, when he&#x27;s not out hunting with his beloved Great Dane, Bendico. He is drawn to his nephew Prince Tancredi Falconeri whom he sees as having noble qualities. This affection is somewhat diminished when he discovers that Tancredi has joined Garibaldi&#x27;s Redshirts. On a trip to the Salina estate in the town of Donnafugata the Prince learns that the mayor, Don Calogero Sedara, has become wealthy through dodgy business transactions and political influence and that his wealth now rivals that of the Salinas. When Sedara introduces his extraordinarily beautiful daughter, Angelica, Tancredi is smitten with her, to the dismay of the Prince&#x27;s daughter Concetta, who loves Tancredi. Although aware of his daughter&#x27;s feelings, the Prince accepts the inevitable and helps arrange Tancredi&#x27;s betrothal to Angelica. The two pass a blissfully innocent period of engagement.

Fabrizio is offered the position of a senator in the new Italian state but turns it down. Angelica is introduced to Palermo society at a sumptuous ball and despite her background slips easily into the role of future countess. The narrative then jumps forward by two decades and finds Prince Fabrizio on his deathbed, surrounded by family. While suffering a series of strokes, the Prince considers that he will be the last true prince of the Salinas, the last leopard. 

The final chapter takes place in 1910. Concetta, now seventy, is still living in the Salina estate with two of her sisters. The Vicar-General and a priest named Don Pacchiotti visit to examine the relics in the estate’s small chapel. Most of them are determined to be forgeries, and Don Pacchiotti asks Concetta to discard them. Along with the fakes, Concetta asks a servant to dispose of the taxidermy body of Bendico, the long-dead Great Dane. The dusty carcass is thrown out of a window. As it falls, it appears momentarily lifelike.

== Reception ==

The novel was met by criticism from people of different political views. The novelist Elio Vittorini, who had rejected an earlier draft of the book for his own press, the author Alberto Moravia, and the poet Franco Fortini, among others, condemned the book as &quot;right-wing&quot;. Moravia wrote that it expressed ruling-class &quot;ideas and view of life&quot;. The equally leftist Louis Aragon vehemently disagreed, seeing it as a &quot;merciless&quot; criticism of that class; many among the surviving Sicilian nobility certainly saw it as such, and were scandalized that one of their own could write such a thing.

The book embodies multiple opinions. The Savoyard Piedmontese are presented as naive about Southern Italy, full of plans that will never match the reality of the region, while the book&#x27;s main representative of the old Bourbon regime, Don Fabrizio&#x27;s brother-in-law Màlvica, is a fool. In his biography of Tomasi, David Gilmour sees Tomasi as criticising the Risorgimento (Unification of Italy) &quot;from both sides, from the viewpoints of both Gramsci ...,&quot; describing the failure of the revolutionaries to truly ally with the peasants, &quot;... and the Bourbons,&quot; describing a unified Italy&#x27;s substitution of even worse elements into the island&#x27;s elite. Despite or because of this controversy, &quot;The Leopard&quot; ultimately gained great critical acclaim. In 1959, it won Italy&#x27;s highest award for fiction, the Strega Prize.

== Analysis ==

=== Historical and autobiographical elements ===

The novel contains both historical and autobiographical elements. During the time he was writing, Tomasi stated in a letter to his friend Baron Enrico Merlo di Tagliavia that Don Fabrizio, the &quot;&#x27;Prince of Salina is the Prince of Lampedusa, my great-grandfather Giulio Fabrizio&quot;, but also (in a letter to Guido Lajolo) &quot;friends who have read it say that the Prince of Salina bears an awful resemblance to myself.&quot; While Don Fabrizio&#x27;s circumstances and many of his traits are clearly those of di Tomasi&#x27;s great-grandfather, this is not necessarily so true of his opinions. In a further letter to Lajolo, after he had written more of the novel, Tomasi doubled down on the autobiographical aspect of the character: &quot;Don Fabrizio expresses my ideas completely.&quot; David Gilmour, in his biography of Tomasi, sees the character as mainly autobiographical but adds that there is also a fair amount of &quot;the person the writer would like to have been&quot; in Salina&#x27;s &quot;arrogant confidence, his overt sensuality, his authority over others...&quot;

Similarly, Tomasi wrote to Merlo di Tagliavia that that &quot;Tancredi is, physically and in his behavior, Giò [Tomasi&#x27;s adopted son Gioacchino Lanza Tomasi]; morally a blend of Francesco Lanza Spinelli di Scalea and his son Pietro.&quot; To Lajolo, he wrote, that in terms of appearance and habits, Tancredi is &quot;a portrait of Giò; as for his morals, however, Giò is fortunately very much better than him.&quot; In his circumstances and actions, Tancredi also owes a lot to Giulio Fabrizio&#x27;s nephew, Corrado Valguarnera, and to some of the latter&#x27;s friends and associates. Some of the reaction against the book by Sicilian aristocrats came from their taking Tancredi and his wife Angelica as &quot;portraits of Corrado Valguarnera and his wife Maria Favara,&quot; then being unhappy that they were not accurate portraits. Gilmour remarks that the discrepancies from these historical figures are &quot;not surprising because [Tomasi] had not tried to make them very similar.&quot;

Some of the strongest historical and autobiographical elements of &quot;The Leopard&quot; are in the portraits of the places of Tomasi&#x27;s life, especially his childhood. The town of Donnafugata is certainly Santa Margherita di Belice (near Palma di Montechiaro) and the palace there the Palazzo Filangeri-Cutò, though considerably larger and more elaborate than the original. Villa Salina outside Palermo is the Villa Lampedusa in Lorenzo outside Palermo. The Palazzo Lampedusa in Palermo does not appear in the novel, although several of its rooms do.

Despite being universally known and published in English as &quot;The Leopard&quot;, the original Italian title for the novel is &quot;Il Gattopardo&quot;, meaning &quot;The Serval&quot;, which refers to a much smaller species of wild cat found in sub-Saharan Africa. The symbol on the Tomasi di Lampedusa coat of arms is a serval.

<text>The Regroupement des militants syndicaux or RMS (in English: &quot;Trade-Union Militants Grouping&quot;) was a political organization founded in 1974 by members of the Groupe socialiste des travailleurs du Québec involved in the three main trade-unions in Quebec (FTQ, CSN and CEQ) to rally trade unionists into political action.

On the political scene, the RMS was deeply involved in the creation of a left-of-centre political party in Montreal, the Rassemblement des citoyens de Montréal (Montreal Citizens Movement) in 1974. It also initiated with the Nouveau Parti démocratique du Québec a coalition that contested seats in the 1976 Quebec general election.

The RMS ended its activities in 1981.

<text>Alfred Uhl (5 June 1909 – 8 June 1992) was an Austrian composer, violist, music teacher and conductor.

==Biography==
Uhl was born in Vienna and studied with Franz Schmidt at the Vienna Music Academy, receiving a diploma in composition with honours in 1932. He subsequently worked as Kapellmeister of the Swiss Festspielmusik in Zürich. While there he composed scores for a variety of cultural and industrial films. He returned to Vienna in 1938 and in 1940 was drafted into the Austrian Army. From 1940 to 1942 he commanded a French prison camp in Neumarkt. He joined the faculty of the Vienna Music Academy in 1945, where he taught theory, orchestration and composition until his retirement in 1980. One of his notable students was Alfred Prinz. He was the recipient of the Vienna Schubert Prize (1943), the Austrian State Prize (1960), the Vienna Music Prize (1961), the Viennese Gold Medal of Honour (1969) and the Austrian Badge of Honour for Service and Arts (1980). He also served as the president of the Austrian Gesellschaft der Autoren, Komponisten und Musikverleger (1970) and the Künstler-Union (1976).

As a composer, Uhl synthesized elements from neo-classicism, atonality, serialism and traditional tonal and contrapuntal idioms. His vibrant style combined technical sophistication and musical charm with wit and humour, rhythmic inventiveness, thematic development and advanced harmonic language. He wrote eight film scores, one opera, several choral works, and multiple symphonic and chamber music pieces. He wrote extensively for the clarinet, including educational material and works that are still common repertoire. His most famous educational pieces are the two volumes which comprise &quot;48 Studies&quot;. His &quot;Divertimento for Three Clarinets and Bass Clarinet&quot; is one of the most performed works for the medium. Written in 1942 for clarinettists from the Vienna Philharmonic, it is a demanding three-movement work structured similarly to a conventional concerto.

== &quot;48 Studies&quot; for clarinet ==

Two volumes of 24 studies each, first published in 1940 by Schott Music, were designed to familiarise the advancing clarinettist with some of the more difficult possibilities being written in modern instrumental music. This is stated by Uhl himself in a foreword to some, but not all editions. As such, they occasionally include intervals which require sliding over keys on the French system of clarinet, a technique that is generally frowned upon unless, as in these cases, it cannot be avoided.

The studies are characterized by their extensive use of neo-romantic chromaticism and rhythmic complexity. Occasionally viewed as less musical and more technical than most studies, some clarinetists consider it a second goal to bring out the musicality of each piece, which may be hidden behind technical complexities.

Uhl was assisted by Leopold Wlach of the Vienna Philharmonic Orchestra, who made suggestions and revisions throughout the writing process.

<text>Bloomingdale&#x27;s Inc. is an American luxury department store chain founded in 1861 by Joseph Bloomingdale and Lyman Bloomingdale. It was acquired by Federated Department Stores in 1930, which purchased the Macy’s department store chain in 1994, when they became sister brands. Ultimately, Federated itself was renamed Macy’s, Inc. in 2007.

As of 2024, the chain had a total of 32 owned department stores in the U.S. and 3 franchised stores in Dubai and Kuwait; 21 outlet stores (all in the U.S.), and 4 &quot;Bloomie&#x27;s by Bloomingdales&quot; concept stores.

Its headquarters and flagship store are located at 59th Street and Lexington Avenue in the New York City borough of Manhattan.

==History==
===19th century===
====Founding (1861)====
The first Bloomingdale&#x27;s was founded in New York City by Benjamin Bloomingdale and his son Lyman Bloomingdale in 1861 in its Lower East Side area, originally under the name Bloomingdale&#x27;s Hoopskirts, initially focused on selling hoop skirts and European fashions. The brothers quickly identified opportunities for growth and expansion in the dynamic retail landscape of the time.In 1872, Lyman and his brother Joseph opened a second location called Bloomingdale&#x27;s Great East Side Bazaar in Midtown Manhattan at 965 Third Avenue, between 56th &amp; 57th Sts. The Bazaar later moved into three adjacent buildings further up the block before finally moving into a building at 59th St. and Third Avenue, where its flagship store remains today.

====Relocations and expansion (1860s-1890s)====
In the subsequent years, Bloomingdale&#x27;s underwent a series of relocations and expansions. The brothers moved the store from its original location to a larger space on 59th Street and Third Avenue. As the business flourished, necessitating more significant retail space, the store moved once again to its iconic location at 59th Street and Lexington Avenue in 1886. This move marked a turning point, solidifying the store&#x27;s position as a prominent retail destination.

In 1872, the store changed its name to &quot;Bloomingdale&#x27;s&quot;, reflecting the family name but also symbolized the flourishing and growth of their business.

Joseph Bloomingdale retired from the company in 1896, giving his brother Lyman full control, and Lyman&#x27;s sons Hiram and Samuel inherited his shares upon his death in 1905.

===20th century===
As the 20th century dawned, Bloomingdale&#x27;s embraced innovative retail practices. The introduction of the department store window display in the late 19th century set a trend, making the store more visually appealing and attracting attention from passersby. This approach contributed to the store&#x27;s reputation for being fashion-forward.

By 1902, the store grew to occupy 80 percent of the city block between 58th St. and 59th St. to the north and south, and Third Avenue and Lexington Avenue to the east and west.

After the New York City Subway debuted, the store&#x27;s primary entrance was shifted to its Lexington Avenue side in 1918 to draw customers coming from the nearby IRT Lexington Avenue Line stop at 59th Street and Lexington Avenue. Given that the U.S. was involved in World War I, Samuel Bloomingdale gave the American Red Cross free use of an entire floor there until the war ended. By 1927, after acquiring all the remaining portions along it, Bloomingdale&#x27;s controlled 100 percent of the block, expanding the store&#x27;s size to 84,000 square feet (later nearly quadrupled via newly added floor space).

Like most publicly traded companies, Bloomingdale&#x27;s faced severe financial problems following the Black Tuesday stock market crash in 1929, and it merged with the newly created Federated Department Stores in early 1930, which helped it survive the Great Depression.

====1945–1959: American designers and fashion influence====
After World War II, Bloomingdale&#x27;s played a crucial role in shaping post-war American fashion. The store actively engaged with European designers and trends, as well as promoting American designers, and was an influencer in fashion trends and the evolution of American fashion sensibilities. This period marked a phase of continued growth and influence for Bloomingdale&#x27;s, solidifying its status as a premier department store. By the 1950s, Bloomingdale&#x27;s had become an established and influential retail institution. The store&#x27;s commitment to offering a wide range of high-quality merchandise and its role in shaping fashion trends laid the foundation for its continued growth and legacy in the decades to come.

====First branch stores====
In 1947, and tandem with America&#x27;s economic boom after World War II, Bloomingdale&#x27;s opened its first store outside of Manhattan in New Rochelle, a New York City suburb, where it assumed control of the former Ware&#x27;s Department Store. After concluding that using pre-existing buildings could have been a better fit with its tried-and-true floor layouts, the company debuted its first custom-built store in 1949, located in the Fresh Meadows neighborhood across the East River in Queens. Over 25,000 people visited on its first day of business. A store in Stamford, Connecticut followed, and then in 1959, Bloomingdale&#x27;s opened its store in Hackensack, New Jersey, along the banks of the Hackensack River. The store was designed by architect William T. Snaith of the firm Loewy Associates. In 1977, a mall now called The Shops at Riverside was constructed along the southern and eastern facades of the Bloomingdale&#x27;s store, which was also enlarged.

====1960-1975====
During the 1960s, Bloomingdale&#x27;s shifted its merchandise mix to incorporate haute couture fashions imported from Paris and home furnishings from Italy. It also launched its first single designer-specific department in 1969, for Halston, one that was quickly followed later that year by a dedicated Polo Ralph Lauren boutique in its men&#x27;s store. By the early 1970s, Bloomingdale&#x27;s had begun embracing avant-garde European design, and following the United Nations recognition of China in 1971, it became the first American retailer to sell products from Communist-era China. Its iconic rounded logo debuted in 1972, followed a year later by its &quot;Big Brown Bag&quot; and &quot;Little Brown Bag,&quot; all of which remain in use today. Bloomingdale&#x27;s continued to thrive throughout the 1970s, despite New York City&#x27;s turbulence at the time, partly via continued expansions into the suburbs. Its largest branch opened in White Plains, New York in 1975, with 260,000 square feet of floor space, and shortly after that, Bloomingdale&#x27;s shuttered its original, but much smaller, New Rochelle branch.

====Expansion beyond New York area====
In 1976, Bloomingdale&#x27;s launched its first full-line department store outside of the New York City area in Tysons, Virginia, a suburb of Washington, D.C.. The First Lady at the time, Betty Ford, attended its opening as its guest of honor.

In 1981, Bloomingdale&#x27;s opened a branch at the King of Prussia Mall in suburban Philadelphia, then the largest mall in the world. Other new stores opened as well, along the East Coast, Florida, Chicago, and in Dallas, Texas. In 1988, Canadian real estate developer Robert Campeau launched a hostile takeover attempt of the company, successfully acquiring it for $6.6 billion: it was the largest non-oil corporate merger ever at the time.

====Economic challenges (1990s)====
Bloomingdale&#x27;s faced continued economic challenges in the early 1990s, resulting in the closures of its Dallas, Fresh Meadows, and Stamford, Connecticut locations. In 1994, Federated Stores acquired the entire Macy&#x27;s chain, which had been in bankruptcy for two years. In November 1996, Bloomingdale&#x27;s expanded to California, converting four former stores of The Broadway. Bloomingdale&#x27;s continued growth and shuttering of duplicative locations stemming from Macy&#x27;s merger.

===21st century===

In 2004, the company returned once again to downtown Manhattan, opening an 82,000-square-foot store – featuring an &quot;edited&quot; selection of the flagship store&#x27;s offerings – in SoHo.

In 2007, Bloomingdale’s expanded into San Diego (Fashion Valley) and Costa Mesa (South Coast Plaza), once again by replacing former Robinsons-May stores that closed in 2006, in each case because there were already existing Macy&#x27;s stores in each mall. In 2006, Bloomingdale&#x27;s opened its largest store save its Manhattan flagship in San Francisco&#x27;s Union Square, in area.

On June 1, 2007, Federated Stores changed its corporate name to Macy&#x27;s, given its more robust name recognition, but left its Bloomingdale&#x27;s store names intact.

On February 14, 2008, parent company Macy&#x27;s, Inc. announced plans to enter the Phoenix market with a 180,000-square-foot store by 2009. Arizona would have been the thirteenth state to have a Bloomingdale&#x27;s store location, with this store being the tenth in the western U.S. and 41st throughout the chain. This store never materialized as a result of the Great Recession in 2008 and 2009.

In May 2008, Bloomingdale&#x27;s began the phase-out of its Bloomingdale&#x27;s By Mail catalog to greater emphasize its rapidly growing online presence at bloomingdales.com. On September 10, 2008, Macy&#x27;s announced plans to open three new Bloomingdale&#x27;s stores, two modeled after its SoHo store. One was intended to be a three-level anchor store at The Shops at Georgetown Park in Washington, D.C., but the plan collapsed after the mall&#x27;s parent company declared bankruptcy. The other two stores were completed, including a new branch at Westfield Valley Fair in San Jose, California, and a store in Santa Monica Place, in Santa Monica, CA. The latter debuted in early 2010. San Jose&#x27;s debut was delayed until 2020, primarily due to the Great Recession, and Santa Monica closed in 2021 due to subpar performance.

In February 2010, Macy&#x27;s launched Bloomingdale&#x27;s first international location in Dubai. As is the case for rival Saks Fifth Avenue, the global presence for Bloomingdale&#x27;s is operated under license by a local interest: in this case, Al Tayer Group LLC, a leading UAE-based conglomerate. Bloomingdale&#x27;s CEO announced that the Dubai store would most likely be the only store outside of the U.S. (The company&#x27;s leaders later had a change of heart, and opened a branch in Kuwait in 2017.) Later in 2010, the company launched its first outlet store at Potomac Mills, located outside of Washington, D.C.

In 2012, Macy&#x27;s Inc. closed four Bloomingdale&#x27;s stores, one each in the Minneapolis (Mall of America), Atlanta (Perimeter), Washington DC (White Flint), and Chicago (Oak Brook) areas.

In late 2019, Macy&#x27;s announced that fur would no longer be sold in any of its stores, including Bloomingdale&#x27;s department &amp; outlet stores, as of the end of the 2020 fiscal year.

As part of an initiative to better establish its New York flagship store as a &quot;retail destination,&quot; designed to allure shoppers who primarily purchase department store goods online, Bloomingdale&#x27;s introduced new departments and offerings throughout the decade, including a branch of Magnolia Bakery and a boutique for Sarah Jessica Parker&#x27;s SJC Collection shoe line. It was the first department store in New York to offer the latter. In 2018 and 2019, Bloomingdale&#x27;s remodeled nearly 200,000 square feet inside the store, wholly revamping its denim, cosmetics, shoes, and women&#x27;s contemporary clothing departments.

In March 2020, Macy&#x27;s, Inc. announced that it would temporarily close all Bloomingdale&#x27;s and Macy&#x27;s locations as a result of the rapidly spreading COVID-19 pandemic. Its original plan to reopen at the end of March quickly evaporated due to the pandemic&#x27;s rapid spread, as did its intent to do so by the end of April 2020: as was the case with most brick-and-mortar retailers, Macy&#x27;s ended up closing some of its stores for a year or more, with reopening days that varied depending on their locations. Some did not reopen until late 2021.

On September 9, 2022, Bloomingdale&#x27;s celebrated its 150th anniversary, featuring a variety of special events and unique merchandise offerings through the end of the year at its Manhattan flagship location.

<text>Henry H. Chambers (October 1, 1790January 24, 1826) was an American politician, who served as the Jacksonian U.S. senator from the state of Alabama from March 4, 1825 until his death. He was replaced by Israel Pickens until a replacement, John McKinley, could be elected.

==Biography==

Henry Chambers was born on October 1, 1790, in Lunenburg County, Virginia. He attended and graduated from the College of William &amp; Mary in 1808 and from the University of Pennsylvania School of Medicine in Philadelphia in 1811. Chambers moved to Madison, Alabama and began practicing medicine. After serving in the American Indian Wars as a surgeon, he returned to Alabama, settling in Huntsville. He served as a member of the Alabama Constitutional Convention in 1819 and in the Alabama House of Representatives in 1820.

After unsuccessfully running for Governor of Alabama in 1821 and 1823, Chambers was elected as a Jacksonian to represent the state in the United States Senate. He assumed office on March 4, 1825, until his death. He died on January 24, 1826, at Flat Rock near Kenbridge, Virginia, while en route to Washington, D.C. Chambers was interred in the family burial ground at Flat Rock.

<text>WBUR-FM (90.9 FM) is a public radio station located in Boston, Massachusetts, owned by Boston University. Its programming is also known as WBUR News. The station is the largest of three NPR member stations in Boston, along with WGBH and WUMB-FM and produces nationally distributed programs, including &quot;On Point&quot; and &quot;Here and Now.&quot; WBUR previously produced &quot;Car Talk&quot;, &quot;Only a Game&quot;, &quot;Open Source,&quot; and &quot;The Connection&quot; (which was cancelled on August 5, 2005). &quot;Radio Boston&quot;, launched in 2007, is its only purely local show. WBUR&#x27;s positioning statement is &quot;Boston&#x27;s NPR News Station&quot;. The station&#x27;s transmitter is located in Needham, while its studio is located on the Boston University campus.

WBUR also carries its programming on two other stations serving Cape Cod and the Islands: WBUH (89.1 FM) in Brewster, and WBUA (92.7 FM) in Tisbury. The latter station, located on Martha&#x27;s Vineyard, uses the frequency formerly occupied by WMVY. In 1998, the station helped launch WRNI in Providence, Rhode Island—the first NPR station within that state&#x27;s borders. It has since sold the station to a local group.

According to Ken Mills, a Minneapolis broadcast consultant and Nielsen data, the number of WBUR listeners has grown since 2012, increasing from 409,000 to 534,400. In 2017, WBUR was named the sixth-most popular NPR news station in the United States.

==Programming==

WBUR programs &quot;On Point&quot; and &quot;Here and Now&quot; are carried nationwide in the US on hundreds of public radio stations and on XM Radio&#x27;s public radio station, XM Public Radio. In total, WBUR produces more than 25 hours of news and programming each week.

&quot;On Point&quot; is a one-hour discussion show formerly hosted by Tom Ashbrook, currently hosted by Meghna Chakrabarti, broadcast weekdays. It began as &#x27;special programming&#x27; in the aftermath of the 9/11 attacks, originally airing from 7 to 9 p.m. It took over the time slot of the similar &quot;The Connection&quot; when that show was cancelled in 2005.

&quot;Here and Now&quot; is a news and culture digest show hosted by Scott Tong, Robin Young, and Deepa Fernandes normally consisting of several interview segments with reporters, authors, artists and statesmen. It began as a regional and local show but soon expanded to cover national and international issues. The show is syndicated nationally by more than 400 other NPR member stations.

&quot;Open Source&quot; is a weekly show hosted by Christopher Lydon, former &quot;New York Times&quot; journalist and original host of &quot;The Connection&quot;. The show focuses on the arts, literature, and foreign affairs.

In 2007, WBUR launched &quot;Radio Boston&quot;, a weekly radio show featuring longtime Boston journalist David Boeri. The show was later hosted by Jane Clayson Johnson as a one-hour discussion and interview, though Boeri still introduced each show with a report from the field. In 2010, Radio Boston expanded to broadcast Monday through Friday. In the fall of 2010, new host Meghna Chakrabarti went on maternity leave and was temporarily replaced by WBUR reporter Sacha Pfeiffer. Chakrabarti returned to co-host the show with Anthony Brooks until she was elevated to host O&quot;n Point&quot;. In June 2019, the station announced that Tiziana Dearing, a longtime commentator and contributor at the station, would be the permanent host of the program.

&quot;Only A Game&quot; was a weekly sports program broadcast twice on Saturdays. The show was hosted by Bill Littlefield until 2018 and was syndicated to about 210 affiliate stations by National Public Radio. The wide-ranging program described itself as &quot;irreverent&quot; and often covered sports from a human interest angle, rather than appealing directly to a particular fan base.

On Sunday evenings, WBUR-FM also broadcasts a show entitled &quot;Boston University&#x27;s World of Ideas&quot;. The show features academics and intellectuals presenting lectures and answering questions on issues of national or global importance.

The 3-minute comedy sketch series &quot;11 Central Ave&quot;, broadcast on WBEZ in Chicago, was for a time recorded at WBUR.

WBUR began producing podcasts in 2014. Current productions include &quot;Dear Sugar Radio&quot;, an advice podcast with Cheryl Strayed and Steve Almond; and &quot;Modern Love&quot;, a partnership with &quot;The New York Times&quot;.

==History==
WBUR first went on the air March 1, 1950, with studios and transmitter located at 84 Exeter Street in Boston. Initially, most of WBUR&#x27;s staff were Boston University students, with the station broadcasting primarily classical, jazz and BU sporting events. In the early 1960s, the station moved from Exeter Street to the newly renovated School of Communications building at 640 Commonwealth Avenue. By the 1970s, WBUR began receiving funding from the Corporation For Public Broadcasting and became a &quot;public radio station&quot; with a professional staff. Volunteer BU students continued local programming on WTBU using unlicensed low-power carrier-current AM transmitters serving the BU residence halls. In 1997 the WBUR offices and studios moved to a new facility on the BU campus at 890 Commonwealth Avenue in Boston.

During the 1970s and 1980s, the station had several jazz music and classical music programs. The disc jockeys demonstrated a broad knowledge of composers, performers, and the execution of jazz, demonstrating familiarity with such matters as improvisation and shared this with listeners.&#x27; Noteworthy jazz and classical disc jockeys included Dennis Boyer (classical: &quot;FM in the PM&quot;), Steve Elman (jazz: &quot;Spaces&quot;), Tony Cennamo (jazz: &quot;New Morning&quot; and subsequently, a night-time show), James Isaacs (jazz), and Jose Masso (Latin: &quot;Con Salsa&quot;). One exception to this was the expansion of overnight programming, most notably the 2-to-6 Shift hosted By Kevin Vandenbroek and Bob King. It lasted about nine months when it was cancelled by the Station Manager Bonnie Cronin. This act led to the Director of Programming Victor S. Wheatman to resign.

At the end of the 1980s, WBUR began replacing many of its music programs with news and information programming from NPR, Public Radio International (which was merged into Public Radio Exchange in 2019) and the BBC. This brought WBUR into head-on competition with another major Boston-area NPR station, WGBH. WGBH eventually decided to retain a mostly music (classical music daytime/jazz nights) and cultural programming format (WBUR&#x27;s former territory), although WGBH did broadcast NPR&#x27;s &quot;Morning Edition&quot; and &quot;All Things Considered&quot;.

By the early 1990s, with the exception of &quot;Con Salsa&quot; on Saturday nights, WBUR had adopted an around-the-clock news and information format. Numerous NPR member stations have since followed WBUR&#x27;s lead and eliminated music programming in favor of news and information programming (including rival WGBH, which transferred classical music programming to WCRB following its acquisition in 2009, though WGBH continued to program jazz at night until July 2012 and still airs a few hours of jazz on weekends). By 2009, the majority of NPR member stations were programming 24/7 news and information formats.

WBUR&#x27;s main transmitter operates at 8,600 watts, which on paper is somewhat modest for a full NPR member on the FM band. However, due to its antenna&#x27;s height (1,174 feet) and configuration, WBUR broadcasts with an effective radiated power of 60,000 watts. It decently covers much of eastern Massachusetts, though it does not penetrate nearly as far to the south and north as WGBH-FM penetrates.

===Cape Cod===
During the 1990s, WBUR began expanding onto Cape Cod. In 1992, it partnered with Cape Cod Regional Technical High School to air WBUR programming over its WCCT-FM (90.3) when students were not on the air. The following year, WBUR reached similar arrangements with WSDH (91.5 FM) at Sandwich High School and WKKL (90.7 FM) at Cape Cod Community College. In 1997, auto dealer Ernie Boch Sr. donated WUOK (1240 AM) in West Yarmouth, which had been simulcasting WXTK, to Boston University, which changed its call letters to WBUR and made it a full-time satellite of WBUR-FM (which added the &quot;-FM&quot; suffix to accommodate the West Yarmouth station as AM stations always have the base callsign). WBUR programming was then dropped from WKKL in 1999, as the 1240 AM signal can be heard in much of WKKL&#x27;s coverage area.

On November 27, 2012, WBUR announced that it would acquire WMVY (92.7 FM) in Tisbury (on Martha&#x27;s Vineyard) to serve as an additional satellite, under the call letters of WBUA. The transaction was completed on February 8, 2013; at midnight that night, WBUA began to carry the WBUR schedule. WMVY&#x27;s adult album alternative programming continued through an online stream and eventually they acquired a new FM facility on 88.7 and expanded it into the current incarnation of WMVY. The acquisition of WBUA rendered the 1240 AM facility redundant; on August 5, 2013, BU announced that it would be sold to Alex Langer, who would program it with Portuguese-language programming similar to that of another Langer station, WSRO. The call letters of 1240 AM were changed to WBAS on February 1, 2014, two days after BU and Langer agreed to a time brokerage agreement. Soon afterward, WSDH also dropped WBUR&#x27;s programming. WBUR added another Cape Cod satellite on May 23, 2014, with the sign-on of WBUH in Brewster; this station broadcasts at a higher power than other noncommercial stations on Cape Cod, allowing it to serve the majority of the region (the exception is the Falmouth area, which is within WBUA&#x27;s coverage area). BU had sought to build a station on Cape Cod since 2004 and applied for the 89.1 facility in Brewster in 2007, but in March 2011 the Federal Communications Commission issued the construction permit to Home Improvement Ministries, who subsequently sold the permit to BU. WBUR ended its agreement with WCCT-FM on September 30, 2014.

===Rhode Island===
In 1998, WBUR helped to found Rhode Island&#x27;s NPR station WRNI. At the time Rhode Island was one of two states lacking an NPR station. WBUR decided to partner with the newly formed Foundation for Ocean State Public Radio to build a state-of-the-art facility at historic Union Station in downtown Providence. Initially, WBUR invested heavily in WRNI&#x27;s local programming, but several of these programs were soon canceled, and its schedule became almost identical to that of WBUR. In 2004, WBUR announced suddenly that it planned to drop WRNI by selling it, raising a number of questions. Rhode Islanders were angry at the thought that they would be forced to buy a station they had invested greatly in creating. It was later revealed that the WBUR management believed WRNI was a financial drain and wished to get rid of it. The resulting management turmoil caused the departure of longtime WBUR station manager Jane Christo. Eventually, the Foundation for Ocean State Public Radio, renamed Rhode Island Public Radio, bought the station in 2008; it has since rebranded as The Public&#x27;s Radio.

===Pro-Israel boycott===

Between 2001 and June 2002, WBUR estimated that it lost between $1–2 million due to the loss of at least six underwriters and a number of small donors. This was the result of a boycott launched by Jewish groups who charged that NPR coverage of the Middle East was biased against Israel. Boston is a major center for the American Jewish community and this made Israel a particularly sensitive subject. The boycott started in October 2001, when two Boston-area businesses ended contracts: WordsWorth Books (now defunct) in Cambridge, Massachusetts, and Cognex Corp. in nearby Natick, Massachusetts. The two businesses were reportedly tied with the advocacy group Committee for Accuracy in Middle East Reporting in America (CAMERA), a persistent critic of NPR&#x27;s coverage for almost a decade. CAMERA has demonstrated outside National Public Radio (NPR) stations in 33 cities in the United States.

The CAMERA boycott also extended to &quot;The New York Times&quot; and &quot;The Washington Post&quot;. Fairness and Accuracy in Reporting and explicitly pro-Palestinian organizations have made contradictory accusations of pro-Israel bias in NPR&#x27;s coverage or imbalance in particular stories. NPR&#x27;s ombudsman and an independent reviewer appointed by the agency found &quot;lack of completeness but strong factual accuracy and no systematic bias&quot; in reporting on the controversial issue.

===2020 layoffs and cost cuts===
In mid-June 2020, WBUR laid off 29 employees, more than 10 percent of the station&#x27;s staff, and ended the &quot;Only A Game&quot; syndicated program due to the ongoing COVID-19 recession. In an email to all staff members, the station announced a spending cut of 13 percent, elimination of wage increases, a hiring freeze, and a 10 percent pay cut for Margaret Low, the current chief executive.

===2024 layoffs and cost cuts===
In April 2024, CEO Margaret Low announced layoffs and buyouts amid a financial crisis. The station is eliminating seven positions, and 24 employees, including four senior leadership team members, are taking voluntary buyouts. These cuts come as WBUR faces a $7 million decline in on-air sponsorship income and aims to reduce its budget by $4 million. In addition to staff reductions, the station is implementing cost-saving measures such as eliminating unfilled positions, reducing travel expenses, and negotiating lower rates for contracted services.

To further save costs, Low will take a ten percent pay cut as part of the cutback, Peet&#x27;s coffee will no longer be purchased for the station, and cell phones will not be covered for any non-represented colleagues.

<text>Jambonet is a Kenyan internet service provider. Until June 30, 2004, it operated as the sole carrier of international internet traffic to and from Kenya. Its monopoly partially ended on that date under terms of which the government of Kenya began licensing other companies to compete in the field of internet telephony. Jambonet currently uses four VSAT satellites to carry the country&#x27;s internet traffic.

Jambonet is a subsidiary of Telkom Kenya.

<doc id="843813" wikidata="Q2140842" url="?curid=843813" title="Venetian polychoral style">
<text>The Venetian polychoral style was a type of music of the late Renaissance and early Baroque eras which involved spatially separate choirs singing in alternation. It represented a major stylistic shift from the prevailing polyphonic writing of the middle Renaissance, and was one of the major stylistic developments which led directly to the formation of what is now known as the Baroque style. A commonly encountered term for the separated choirs is &quot;cori spezzati&quot;—literally, &quot;broken choruses&quot; as they were called, added the element of spatial contrast to Venetian music. These included the echo device, so important in the entire baroque tradition; the alternation of two contrasting bodies of sound, such as chorus against chorus, single line versus a full choir, solo voice opposing full choir, instruments pitted against voices and contrasting instrumental groups; the alternation of high and low voices; soft level of sound alternated with a loud one; the fragmentary versus the continuous; and blocked chords contrasting with flowing counterpoint.

Principle of duality, or opposing elements, is the basis for the concertato or concerted style, both words being derived from concertare, meaning &quot;to compete with or to strive against.&quot; The word appears in the title of some works Giovanni published jointly with his uncle Andrea Gabrieli in 1587: Concerti...per voice at stromenti (&quot;Concertos...for voices and instruments&quot;). The term later came to be widely used, with such titles as Concerti Ecclesiastici (Church Concertos) appearing frequently.

== History of the style ==

The style arose in Northern Italian churches in the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries, and proved to be a good fit for the architectural peculiarities of the imposing Basilica San Marco di Venezia in Venice. Composers such as Adrian Willaert, the &quot;maestro di cappella&quot; of St. Mark&#x27;s in the 1540s, wrote antiphonal music, in which opposing choirs sang successive, often contrasting phrases of the music from opposing choir lofts, from specially constructed wooden platforms, and from the octagonal &quot;bigonzo&quot; across from the pulpit. This was a rare but interesting case of the architectural peculiarities of a single building encouraging the proliferation of a style which had become popular all over Europe, and helped define the shift from the Renaissance to the Baroque era. The idea of different groups singing in alternation contributed to the evolution of the concertato style, which in its different instrumental and vocal manifestations eventually led to such diverse musical ideas as the chorale cantata, the concerto grosso, and the sonata.

The peak of development of the style was in the late 1580s and 1590s, while Giovanni Gabrieli was organist at San Marco and principal composer, and while Gioseffo Zarlino was still &quot;maestro di cappella&quot;. Gabrieli seems to have been the first to specify instruments in his published works, including large choirs of cornetti and sackbuts; he also seems to be one of the earliest to specify dynamics (as in his &quot;Sonata pian&#x27; e forte&quot;), and to develop the &quot;echo&quot; effects for which he became famous. The fame of the spectacular, sonorous music of San Marco at this time spread across Europe, and numerous musicians came to Venice to hear, to study, to absorb and bring back what they learned to their countries of origin. Germany, in particular, was a region where composers began to work in a locally modified form of the Venetian style—most notably Heinrich Schütz—though polychoral works were also composed elsewhere, such as the many masses written in Spain by Tomás Luis de Victoria.

After 1603, a basso continuo was added to the already considerable forces at San Marco—orchestra, soloists, choir—a further step toward the Baroque cantata. Music at San Marco went through a period of growth and decline, but the fame of the institution spread far. Although the repertoire eventually included music in the concertato style, as well as the conservative stile antico, works in the polychoral style maintained a secure place in the San Marco repertoire into the 1800s.

<doc id="843815" wikidata="Q7697349" url="?curid=843815" title="Telkom Kenya">
<text>Telkom Kenya is an integrated telecommunications provider in Kenya. It was previously a part of the Kenya Posts and Telecommunications Corporation (KPTC) which was the sole provider of both postal and telecommunication services. The company was established as a telecommunications operator in April 1999, after the split of KPTC into the Communications Commission of Kenya (CCK), the Postal Corporation of Kenya (POSTA) and Telkom Kenya. As of 2023, the company is fully owned the Government of Kenya.

==Services==
The company operates and maintains the infrastructure over which Kenya&#x27;s various internet service providers operate. As of 2004, most internet service was provided via dial-up service. Jambonet, an important Kenyan ISP, is a subsidiary of Telkom Kenya. It also offers mobile GSM voice and high speed internet services under the Telkom brand, in which it is the 3rd in market share after Safaricom and Airtel Kenya. In 2018, it was announced that Airtel Kenya was considering a merger with Telkom Kenya. In March 2018, the company resumed a mobile-money service that it had dropped in 2017. Referred to as T-kash, the service is a direct competitor to the M-pesa service, offered by market-leader Safaricom.

==History==
In 2007 France Télécom (now Orange S.A.) acquired 51% of Telkom Kenya&#x27;s shares at a cost of US$390 million. In November 2012, the shareholding structure changed due to a decision by the Kenyan government to convert its shareholder loans at that time, into equity in order to ease Telkom Kenya&#x27;s debt burden. It was subsequently confirmed that the Kenya government would retain 40% shareholding down from 49% with the remaining shares held by France Télécom. In January 2013, France Télécom increased its stake in Telkom Kenya to 70% as a consequence of the government&#x27;s failure to provide its full portion of the 2012 funding. In June 2017, the firm was re-branded from &quot;Orange Kenya&quot; to &quot;Telkom Kenya&quot;.

==Past shareholding==
On November 9, 2015, Helios Investment Partners announced that they were going to purchase France Télécom&#x27;s entire stake in Telkom Kenya.

Subsequent to the agreement to buy, Helios negotiated with the Kenyan government to own 40 percent in the new joint venture, with the investment firm retaining 60 percent. In June 2016, final regulatory approval was received for the deal to proceed. In October 2022, the Kenyan government acquired the remaining 60% of Telkom Kenya from Helios in a $50.4 million USD deal. At that time, the Kenyan government owned 100 percent of Telkom Kenya.

==Current shareholding==
In October 2023, Infrastructure Corporation of Africa LLC (ICA), based in the United Arab Emirates was selected to acquire the 60 percent shareholding, previously owned by Helios Investment Partners. Subject to all the approvals and documentation, the shareholding will look as depicted in the table below.

<text>The Groupe socialiste des travailleurs du Québec or GST (in English: &quot;Quebec Socialist Workers&#x27; Group&quot;) was a far left political movement founded in 1973 by militants of the Fourth International in the province of Quebec, Canada. Involved in trade-unions, the GST worked for the creation, in 1974, of the Regroupement des militants syndicaux and, on the municipal scene in the city of Montreal, of the Montreal Citizens&#x27; Movement (Rassemblement des citoyens de Montréal). The GST was also at the origin of the electoral coalition of the Nouveau Parti démocratique du Québec (NPD-Québec) and the Regroupement des militants syndicaux that contested seats in the 1976 Quebec general election. The GST also ran independent candidates in the 1981 Quebec general election.

The GST was disbanded in 1987. Most of its members joined the NPD-Québec.

While most of the GST&#x27;s political existence and history were within Quebec, there was also a small English-language group centred in Toronto which worked in the New Democratic Party and some union locals. The proper name of the group during most of its existence time was &quot;Groupe socialiste des travailleurs&quot; (in English: &quot;Socialist Workers&#x27; Group&quot;), reflecting the fact that it was pan-Canadian in aspiration. The Toronto cell had developed around a split in the Toronto group of the Workers&#x27; League, and came to the Organising Committee for the Reconstruction of the Fourth International independently of the Quebec group.

<doc id="843835" wikidata="Q117226378" url="?curid=843835" title="Adpositional case">
<text>In grammar, the prepositional case (abbreviated ) and the postpositional case (abbreviated ) - generalised as &quot;adpositional cases&quot; - are grammatical cases that respectively mark the object of a preposition and a postposition. This term can be used in languages where nouns have a declensional form that appears &quot;exclusively&quot; in combination with certain prepositions.

Because the objects of these prepositions often denote locations, this case is also sometimes called the &quot;locative case&quot;: Czech and Slovak //, in Polish. This is in concord with its origin: the Slavic prepositional case hails from the Proto-Indo-European locative case (present in Armenian, Sanskrit, and Old Latin, among others). The so-called &quot;second locative&quot; found in modern Russian has ultimately the same origin.

In Irish and Scottish Gaelic, nouns that are the objects of (most) prepositions may be marked with prepositional case, especially if preceded by the definite article. In traditional grammars, and in scholarly treatments of the early language, the term &quot;dative&quot; case is incorrectly used for the prepositional case. This case is exclusively associated with prepositions. However, not all prepositions trigger prepositional case marking, and a small group of prepositions which are termed &quot;compound&quot; mark their objects with genitive case, these prepositions being historically derived from the fusion of a preposition plus a following noun which has become grammaticalised. (Compare English &quot;in front of&quot;, &quot;because of&quot;.) Note however that many nouns no longer exhibit distinct prepositional case forms in the conversational language.

In the Pashto language, there also exists a case that occurs only in combination with certain prepositions. It is more often called the &quot;first oblique&quot; than the prepositional.

In many other languages, the term &quot;prepositional case&quot; is inappropriate, since the forms of nouns selected by prepositions also appear in non-prepositional contexts. For example, in English, prepositions govern the objective (or accusative) case, and so do verbs. In German, prepositions can govern the genitive, dative, or accusative, and none of these cases are exclusively associated with prepositions.

Sindhi is a language which can be said to have a postpositional case. Nominals in Sindhi can take a “contracted” oblique form which may be used in ergative, dative, or locative constructions without a postposition, or a “full” oblique case ending expressed when forming a postpositional phrase. Differences in these forms are only observed in the plural.

<text>The East Texas Musical Convention, now usually called the &quot;East Texas Sacred Harp Convention&quot;, is an annual gathering of shape note singers. Songs are sung a cappella from the Sacred Harp tunebook. The Convention was organized in 1855, and is the oldest Sacred Harp convention in Texas, and the second oldest in the United States. The East Texas Convention was modeled after the older (now defunct) &quot;Southern Musical Convention&quot; established in 1845 by Benjamin Franklin White, the compiler of &quot;The Sacred Harp&quot;.

The East Texas Convention has a continuous history from 1868, the earliest year notated in its minutes. William Russell Adams, President of the Convention in 1874, 1884, and 1885, wrote to Aldine S. Kieffer, explaining that the convention missed a few years of meeting because of the American Civil War. Re-established after the war, a large influx of Georgia and Alabama settlers added to its strength. In its early years it was generally considered a forum of Christian worship. Today many are attracted to its folk music aspect.

Throughout its history, the East Texas Musical Convention has convened annually in six East Texas counties: Gregg, Harrison, Panola, Rusk, Smith and Upshur. The Convention presently meets for two days in Henderson, Texas on the weekend of the second Sunday in August. The current &quot;textbook&quot; of the Convention is &quot;The Sacred Harp (2012 Revised Cooper Edition)&quot;, first revised by W. M. Cooper and others in 1902.

<doc id="843837" wikidata="Q2734120" url="?curid=843837" title="Intermedio">
<text>The intermedio (also intromessa, introdutto, tramessa, tramezzo, intermezzo, intermedii), in the Italian Renaissance, was a theatrical performance or spectacle with music and often dance, which was performed between the acts of a play to celebrate special occasions in Italian courts. It was one of the important precursors to opera, and an influence on other forms like the English court masque. Weddings in ruling families and similar state occasions were the usual occasion for the most lavish intermedi, in cities such as Florence and Ferrara. Some of the best documentation of intermedi comes from weddings of the House of Medici, in particular the 1589 Medici wedding (between Christina of Lorraine and Ferdinando I de&#x27; Medici, Grand Duke of Tuscany), which featured what was undoubtedly both the most spectacular set of intermedi, and the best known, thanks to no fewer than 18 contemporary published festival books and sets of prints that were financed by the Grand Duke.

Intermedi were written and performed from the late 15th century through the 17th century, although the peak of development of the genre was in the late 16th century. After 1600 the form merged with opera, for the most part, though intermedi continued to be used in non-musical plays in certain settings (for example in academies), and also continued to be performed between the acts of operas.

==Development==
The first intermedii were not in Florence but in Ferrara at the end of the 15th century between the five acts of plays by the classical authors Plautus and Terence. Writing of the &quot;intermezzi&quot; at the wedding of Lucrezia Borgia in 1502, Isabella d&#x27;Este said that they were more interesting than the boring &quot;commedia&quot;, &quot;a remark destined to be often repeated&quot;. Ferrara intermezzi at this period were short and without a unifying theme; they included choruses, recitations and &quot;moresca&quot; dances. But by 1513 there was a unifying allegory, explained at the end. It was for Florentine public celebrations that Intermedii came into their own; several were organised by Machiavelli when he was part of the government of the Republic of Florence in the early 16th century, and the returning Medici adopted a policy of keeping the aristocracy occupied by involving them in productions.

As the intermedio developed in the 16th century, it grew more and more elaborate, often becoming a &quot;play within a play&quot;; for example during a five-act play, an intermedio would consist of four parts, which might be presented as a four-part metaphor of time passing in the play. This stage begins with &quot;Il commodo&quot;, from the Medici wedding in Florence of Cosimo I and Eleanor of Toledo in 1539, where the four parts were morning, noon, afternoon, and night, represented with an elaborate mechanical artificial sun, with singing and dancing appropriate to each time. Some critics of the time noted that the intermedi had become so elaborate that the play had begun to serve as intermedi to the intermedi.

==Mature intermedio==
Originally intermedi had used the sets already on the stage from the main play, typically fairly simple ones for a comedy, with a few extra pieces, but later they had their own sets, which a mythological subject required to be more elaborate. Vasari&#x27;s production for yet another Medici wedding in 1565 &quot;embodied stupendous advances in engineering technique&quot; with all the elaborate movements of scenery done without a curtain in full view of the audience. According to Roy Strong: &quot;the designs for the 1589 intermezzi are crucial, for they are the earliest mass-disseminated illustrations of what became a norm throughout Europe for theatrical visual experience for the next three hundred years, the proscenium arch behind which receded ranks of side wings, the vista closed by a back-shutter.&quot; Eventually the form acquired a tradition and cohesiveness that allowed it to stand on its own, and it was thus a logical development to combine the existing features with sung, acted parts, and be absorbed into the new artform of opera, which also drew from the traditions of monody and madrigal comedy. Jacopo Peri, the composer of &quot;Dafne&quot;, the first opera, was one of the composers, and almost certainly performers, in the 1589 Medici intermezzi, and the librettist for both, Ottavio Rinuccini, seems to have recycled in &quot;Dafne&quot; some of the material from the 1589 Delos scene (illustrated at top).
&quot;Festival books&quot;, produced as souvenirs of lavish festivities, contain detailed descriptions of many important intermedi, such as those for the Medici wedding of 1589, for which 286 costumes were made. Although music written specially for this occasion survives (see discography below), this is usually not the case, and music written for other occasions, for example madrigals and instrumental pieces, was often used in intermedi. The subject matter of the intermedio was usually a mythological or pastoral story, which could be told in mime, by costumed singers or actors, or by dance, or any combination of these. There was invariably a political message, even if this was limited to general glorification of the ruling family; at times more specific messages were intended. Some thematic connection with the main play might be made, though intermedii could be repeated with different plays from the one they were written for.

Numerous drawings and engravings of the stage sets survive, as well as texts of the libretti and descriptions of the music and action; the 1589 Medici intermezzi were especially well recorded, and &quot;were to be the fount of Italian baroque scenography as well as influencing the development of the stage north of the Alps, above all the Stuart court masques designed by Inigo Jones&quot;. The actual content in terms of staging, music, instrumentation, presence of singers, actors, dancers, or mime was highly variable throughout the period, and sometimes all of these features were present. The 1589 intermedi were performed in the recently completed theatre in the Uffizi Palace before an audience of about three thousand, and three further performances were given some days after the end of the wedding festivities. 
Further significant sets of Medici intermedi were produced for the weddings in 1600 of Henry IV of France and Marie de&#x27; Medici, and then in 1608 of Grand Duke Cosimo II and a Habsburg princess, Maria Magdalena of Austria. However the 1600 celebrations also included a portent of things to come in the form of performances of Jacopo Peri&#x27;s opera &quot;Euridice&quot;, the earliest surviving example of the form.

==Music of the Medici intermedi==

Of the various intermedi that were performed, only the music to some parts of &quot;Il commodo&quot; (1539) and, through a 1591 printed edition by Cristofano Malvezzi, an almost complete version of &quot;La Pellegrina&quot; (1589) are known to have survived.

In 1539 most of the pieces are in four and five parts so much of this music is suitable for domestic playing. The 1589 music is very different being largely big set pieces for 6, 12, 18 or even 30 parts; 41 instrumentalists were required in all, some hidden around the stage as there was not room for them all in one place. Smaller scale pieces are often difficult florid monody of the Caccini &quot;new music&quot; variety.

Of the surviving intermedi only two numbers were &quot;a cappella&quot;, (not counting the madrigals which were sung at the banquet in 1539 which of course are not intermedi). This means we have surviving descriptions of precise instrumentation.

Classical humanist dramatic theory says a play should have action taking place during one entire day. These intermedi do not follow what were believed to be the classical instructions, having an overture item, &quot;Vattene almo riposo&quot;, and a night time ending for tenor voice accompanied by four sackbuts and an extra coda the bacchanale, &quot;Baccho, Baccho, E U O E&quot;.

==Similar forms outside Italy==

The similar form which developed in France at the same time was called the intermède; it was more reliant on dance than the Italian version. The French court under Catherine de&#x27; Medici was also staging court festivities of increasing lavishness – Catherine&#x27;s granddaughter was the Medici bride in 1589. The masque in England also had many similarities to the intermedio, although it did not originate as a &quot;filler&quot; between acts in a play in the same way. The later 18th century intermezzo in opera showed a reversal of the Renaissance scheme; now a single short comic intermezzo was inserted between the acts of a heroic opera seria.

<text>Cambodian cuisine is the national cuisine of Cambodia. It reflects the varied culinary traditions of different ethnic groups in Cambodia, central of which is Khmer cuisine (, ), the nearly-two-thousand-year-old culinary tradition of the Khmer people. Over centuries, Cambodian cuisine has incorporated elements of Indian, Chinese (in particular Teochew), French, and Portuguese cuisines. Due to some of these shared influences and mutual interaction, Cambodian cuisine has many similarities with the cuisines of Central Thailand, and Southern Vietnam and to a lesser extent also Central Vietnam, Northeastern Thailand and Laos.

Cambodian cuisine can be categorized into three main types: rural, elite and royal cuisine. Although there is some distinction between royal and popular cuisine, it is not as pronounced as in Thailand and Laos. Cambodian royal dishes tend to feature a wider variety of higher-quality ingredients and contain more meat.

== Historical influences ==
=== 1st–9th century ===
Archaeological evidence shows that by the 1st and 2nd centuries, the region&#x27;s inhabitants had already settled in small communities that cultivated rice and raised animals. As early as the 1st century, the communities along the Mekong and the Tonlé Sap were growing rice and gathering seafood and fish from the sea, rivers, and lakes.

Around the 2nd century, Indian merchants introduced many spices to Khmer cuisine. The Indian influence on cuisine among other aspects of Khmer culture was already noted by a Chinese visitor around 400 AD. From South India through Java, Khmer royal cuisine adopted the preparation of curry pastes, adding lemongrass and galangal to the recipe. According to Cambodian anthropologist Ang Choulean, the influence of Indian cuisine on rural Cambodian cuisine has been limited or even non-existent.

A passage in the &quot;Book of Sui&quot; describes the diet of 7th-century Chenla inhabitants, noting that it &quot;includes a lot of butter, milk-curds, powdered sugar, rice, and also millet, from which they make a sort of cake which is soaked in meat juices and eaten at the beginning of the meal.&quot;

=== 9th–15th century ===

Between 9th and 15th century the culinary influence of the growing Khmer Empire spread beyond the borders of modern-day Cambodia into what is now Thailand, Laos, Vietnam, and Indonesia. According to Chinese diplomat Zhou Daguan&#x27;s account, onions, mustard, chives, eggplants, watermelons, winter gourds, snake gourds, amaranth and many other vegetables, as well pomegranates, sugarcane, lotus flowers, lotus roots, Chinese gooseberries, bananas, lychees, oranges, and many other fruits were available in the Khmer Empire in late 13th century.

Food crops and other plants were actively cultivated and harvested in tropical gardens both in and around cities and temples of the Khmer Empire. Archaeobotanical investigations at Angkor Wat and Ta Prohm have identified macroremains of rice, sesame, mung beans, crepe ginger, black peppers, long peppers, and either citron or kaffir lime rind, as well as phytoliths from plants of &quot;Cucurbitaceae&quot;, &quot;Mus&quot;, &quot;Arecaceae&quot;, and &quot;Canarium&quot; families, while archaeobotanical investigations at 14th–15th century Angkor Thom have identified macroremains of rice, sesame, mung beans, pigeon peas, hyacinth beans, and yardlong beans.

For centuries, Khmer Empire was the dominant Indianized civilization in the region and its influence extended to the culinary arts. The Khmer Empire played a mediating role in transferring the Indian culinary influence now fundamental to Central Thai cuisine. The close affinity between Cambodian and Central Thai cuisine has been attributed to the extensive, centuries-long contact between the Khmer Empire and Ayutthaya Kingdom. The flavour principles of many Cambodian dishes, such as sour fish soups, stews and coconut-based curries—including steamed curries—share very similar flavour profiles with Central Thai cuisine. However, Cambodian dishes tend to use less chili and sugar, instead emphasizing aromatic spices such as cardamom, star anise, cloves, and nutmeg, along with lemongrass, ginger, galangal, coriander, and wild lime leaves.

Khmer cuisine has also influenced Thailand&#x27;s Isan cuisine and Khmer cuisine is very popular in the region&#x27;s lower southern provinces of Surin, Sisaket and Buriram that have a large Northern Khmer population. Khmer-influenced dishes of the Surin province include &quot;sanlo chek&quot;, &quot;salot rao&quot; or &quot;kaeng phueak&quot;, &quot;ang kaep bop&quot;, and &quot;som jruk&quot;. As Thai tribes migrated southwards they were influenced by the Khmer practice of fermenting fish and adopted local ingredients, including &quot;prahok&quot;, which became imbedded in the Isan (as &quot;pla ra&quot;) and Lao cuisine (as &quot;padaek&quot;) from the time both Isan and Laos were part of the Khmer Empire.

Lao cuisine also was influenced from Cambodia cuisines through Lao migration into the country. Khmer cuisine has much less in common with Isan and Lao cuisines than with Central Thai cuisine.

=== 16th–18th century ===
In the beginning of 16th century, Portuguese merchants and explorers arrived in Cambodia, introducing a variety of fruits and vegetables from South America, Europe and other parts of Asia. These included papayas, tomatoes, pineapples, peanuts, cashews, avocados, vanilla, apples, passion fruit and sweet potatoes. However, the Portuguese influence on Cambodian cuisine extended beyond just ingredients. The traditional Khmer dessert &quot;krob knor&quot; () is a direct descendant of Portuguese &quot;fios de ovos&quot;, and Cambodian egg cakes &quot;num barang&quot; () are also believed to have Portuguese origins.
From the 18th century onwards, the ingredients and dishes of Mekong Delta&#x27;s indigenous Khmer Krom, most notably spices (cardamom, cinnamon, star anise, clove, ginger, turmeric and ground coriander), curries and fermented food have influenced the cuisine of modern-day Southern Vietnam as large numbers of Vietnamese began settling in the area. Khmer Krom dishes, such as &quot;&quot;, &quot;bún mắm&quot; and &quot;canh xiêm lo&quot; have been adopted by the region&#x27;s Vietnamese and Chinese people, while Khmer Krom have adopted the Vietnamese &quot;lẩu mắm&quot; and &quot;canh chua&quot; and Chinese Yang Chow fried rice into their cuisine. Khmer specialties from the Sóc Trăng province, such as &quot;cốm dẹp&quot; and &quot;nom kapong&quot; () have gained popularity throughout the Mekong Delta and other parts of Vietnam. Khmer-style crepes known as &quot;ọm chiếl&quot; are commonly sold in food stalls around the Mekong Delta, especially in Trà Vinh province. Conversely, the Vietnamese influence on Cambodian cuisine intensified during two centuries of Vietnamese rule in Cambodia. Dishes that Cambodian cuisine is believed to have been borrowed from the Vietnamese include beef lok lak and &quot;nem noeung&quot;.

=== 19th–20th century ===

From 1863 to 1953, Cambodia was a French protectorate, which led to the adoption of French culinary elements into Cambodian cuisine. Baguettes, or more often demi-baguettes, have become common in Cambodia, often used to make sandwiches with butter, sardines in oil or with pâté. They are also eaten with curries as an alternative to fresh rice noodles or rice. For breakfast, slices of baguette topped with melted cheese, pork liver pâté, or sardines in oil are sometimes served alongside fried eggs or omelettes. The French introduced several ingredients to Cambodian cooking, such as potatoes, onions, butter, margarine, and carrots. Fried potatoes are featured in the so-called &quot;English&quot; version of &quot;lok lak&quot;, carrots are added to soups, lettuce leaves or sliced onions are incorporated in other Cambodian dishes. Butter and margarine have become preferred fats in Cambodian cuisine. Other Khmer adoptions from the French cuisine include coffee, condensed milk, chocolate, beer and wine. The French influence is shared with Vietnamese and Lao cuisine as Vietnam, Laos and Cambodia were all part of French Indochina.
In the decades following World War II, many Cambodian urban middle-class and elite families employed cooks trained in French cuisine, and the children of these households often did not learn cooking themselves. The transmission of Cambodian culinary knowledge was further disrupted by the Cambodian Civil War and Cambodian genocide in the 1970s and 1980s. During the rule of Khmer Rouge, Cambodian cuisine was reduced to a plain rice gruel and Cambodians were forced to start catching and eating insects, frogs, snakes, snails and other small animals to avoid starvation. A lingering remnant of this era is the practice of eating fried spiders (&quot;a-ping&quot;), which are now sold as street food to tourists and still consumed by some locals, particularly in Skuon, for which it has earned the nickname Spiderville.

=== 21st century ===
Nowadays, more and more Asian fast food chains (such as The Pizza Company, Lotteria, Pepper Lunch, Yoshinoya and Bonchon) and Western fast food chains (such as Burger King, KFC, Krispy Kreme and Carl&#x27;s Jr.) have entered the Cambodian market, especially in Phnom Penh, and fast food has become increasingly integrated into the Cambodian food scene, particularly among the younger generation.

Since the early 2010s, an emerging grassroots culinary movement in Siem Reap, called &quot;New Cambodian Cuisine&quot;, has gained momentum. It loosely consists of six Cambodian chefs and restaurateurs—Pola Siv, Sothea Seng, Pol Kimsan and Sok Kimsan, Mengly Mork and Pheak Tim—who are experimenting with and modernizing traditional Cambodian dishes. More recently, mobile applications dedicated to Khmer traditional recipes have also been developed, such as &quot;Khmer Cooking Recipe&quot; downloaded more than 100,000 times on Google Play and &quot;Khmer Cooking&quot;.

==== In the United States (20th–21st century) ====
Since the late 1970s, approximately 200,000 Cambodians have settled in the United States of America, nearly half in Southern California, fleeing the Khmer Rouge and the following economic and political turmoil in Cambodia. Cambodian Americans own about 9,000 businesses, predominantly restaurants and grocery stores catering to the local Cambodian American community. Cambodian Americans own around 90% of the 5,000 independently owned doughnut shops in California. The most successful of them was Ted Ngoy who at the peak of his success owned about 70 doughnut shops in California and was nicknamed &quot;The Donut King&quot;.

Over time the food cooked by Cambodians in the United States developed into a distinct Cambodian American variety. Meat, especially beef and chicken, plays a much more central role in Cambodian American meals, which also make much more extensive use of tomatoes and corn. Unhealthy eating habits, such as consumption of fatty meat, and obesity rates are higher for the Cambodian Americans who experienced more severe food deprivation and insecurity in the past. The food of second- and third-generation Cambodian Americans has become more Americanized. Cambodian cuisine is not well known in the United States and is usually compared to Thai food by many Americans. Most Cambodian restaurants are located in cities with a significant Cambodian population, such as Lowell, Massachusetts, Long Beach, California and Seattle, Washington. Some of the Cambodian-owned restaurants, however, served other Asian cuisines, especially Thai and Chinese, whereas in the ones that serve Cambodian cuisine Chinese, Thai and Vietnamese-influenced dishes usually dominate over Khmer dishes.

Long Beach, California has the most Cambodian restaurants in the U.S.: twenty-two, including Phnom Penh Noodle Shack and Sophy&#x27;s. Some Cambodian-owned restaurants in the city, such as Little La Lune Cuisine and Crystal Thai Cambodian, serve Thai food, while others, such as Hak Heang or Golden Chinese Express, serve Chinese food. Lowell, Massachusetts, has at least twenty Cambodian restaurants, among them Tepthida Khmer and Simply Khmer. Other notable Cambodian restaurants include Sok Sab Bai in Portland, as well as Phnom Penh Noodle House and Queen&#x27;s Deli in Seattle. The most famous Cambodian restaurant in the U.S. is the Elephant Walk, serving French-inspired Khmer cuisine. It was opened in 1991 in Cambridge, Massachusetts by Longteine de Monteiro. The restaurant also created a cookbook of the same name, which is the first Cambodian American cookbook.

In 2000, a part of Central Long Beach was officially designated as Cambodia Town, where since 2005 an annual parade and culture festival takes place that also features Cambodian cuisine. Since the late 2010s there has been an emerging wave of second-generation Cambodian American chefs and restaurants in the U.S. focusing on Cambodian cuisine. Among them is the award-winning restaurant Nyum Bai, opened in Fruitvale, Oakland, California in 2018 by chef Nite Yun.

In Cambodia&#x27;s coastal regions, dishes with saltwater fish are more common. Kampot was once renowned for its deep-fried pomfret with garlic, sugar, lime juice and chilies. The colonial resort town of Kep historically hosted numerous fine dining seafood restaurants along the promenade that after the city&#x27;s destruction by Khmer Rouge in the 1970s have been replaced by individual vendors offering simpler seafood dishes, such as crabs sauteed with onions and black pepper, or pieces of dried squid, pounded or grilled over a wood fire served with pickled papaya and cucumbers.

In the northern part of the country, along the Cambodia–Thailand border, dishes are influenced by Thai cuisine and contain an increased amount of coconut milk, chillies and sugar. In northern Cambodia, dishes also include game meats, such as venison and wild bird meat, and bamboo shoots, popular in Lao cuisine, are more frequently used. In northwest Cambodia, remnants of the Khmer imperial cuisine are present, particularly in its steamed curries. In Cambodia&#x27;s upland areas, the availability of wild vegetables is decreasing due to the enclosure of common forests and indigenous Khmer Loeu households are increasingly adopting Khmer-style cooking and meat-heavy diet introduced by Khmer migrants.

The differences between rural and urban cuisines are more pronounced than regional variations. Rural cuisine tends to be simpler, relying largely on ingredients that locals can grow or gather themselves. Beef is rare and while pigs and chickens are commonly raised, meat is used sparingly. Due to the high cost of spices and the labour-intensive process of grating meat and extracting coconut milk, curries are typically reserved for special occasions and holidays. In contrast, the ingredients in urban cuisine are more diverse and the dishes more developed, though there remains a notable difference between the food eaten by the poor and the wealthy. Some of the haute cuisine in urban areas originates in the imperial court.

== Kitchen and eating utensils ==
In the Khmer Empire, kitchens earthenware pots were used to cook rice, and sometimes an earthenware stove was used to make sauces. Hearths were formed by burying three stones in the ground and ladles were made from coconut shells. Pottery dishes imported from China or copperware were used for serving rice, while sauce containers were made from leaves. &quot;Chiao&quot; leaves were also used to make single use spoons for carrying liquid to the mouth.

The south wall of the 12th/13th century Bayon temple depicts a Khmer kitchen, including its utensils, many of which are still used throughout modern Cambodia. According to local villager stories passed down by generations, the 12th century Wat Athvea once housed an Angkorean-era royal open-air kitchen. They describe the temple&#x27;s loose fallen stones as &quot;kraya cham-en&quot; meaning &quot;the preparation of the royal meal&quot; and talk about once-standing brick stoves and a wall where meat, baskets of ingredients, and utensils were hung. However, French archaeologist Claude Jacques contends that there is no archaeological evidence of a surviving Khmer Empire kitchen from that period. He believes the Bayon temple’s bas-reliefs and the writings of the Chinese diplomat Zhou Daguan are the only surviving records of ancient Khmer kitchens.

Nowadays, Khmer rural kitchens are usually placed in an airy location, close, but separate from the main house to avoid smoke from firewood and undesirable odours from disturbing the main household. The most important Khmer kitchen utensils are:
* A mortar and pestle for making &quot;kroeung&quot;;
* A bamboo sieve for filtering &quot;prahok&quot; and ripe tamarind juice;
* Earthen stoves with varying heat intensity for cooking different dishes;
* A coconut grater;
* Earthen pots for cooking rice and soup, as well as storing water;
* Jars for storing &quot;prahok&quot;, &quot;kapi&quot; and other ingredients.
* Loose bamboo baskets for storing vegetables.

In many kitchens, aluminium pots have replaced earthenware. Utensils are usually hung on the walls of the kitchen for easier access. With frying adopted from the Chinese, frying pans are also often found in modern Khmer kitchens. Although usually not considered part of the kitchen utensils, some houses may also have a larger mortar for grinding rice, and flat round bamboo trays for separating husk from the grain.

==Ingredients==
===Rice===

Because of Cambodia&#x27;s geographic location, rice together with fish, especially freshwater fish, are the two most important sources of nutrients in the Cambodian diet. Rice is a staple food generally eaten at every meal.

Rice is believed to have been cultivated by the ancestors of the Khmers in the territory of Cambodia since 5,000 to 2,000 B.C. The advanced hydraulic engineering developed during the Khmer Empire allowed the Khmer to harvest rice and other crops three to four times a year. According to the International Rice Research Institute, there are approximately 2,000 rice varieties indigenous to Cambodia bred over the centuries by the Cambodian rice farmers. One of them – &quot;Malys Angkor&quot; (, ) – has been regarded as the world&#x27;s best rice.

===Fermented sauces===
In Khmer, a distinction is made between fermented seafood depending on its consistency and the ingredient. () is the general term for seafood fermented with a special technique and usually includes more solid pieces of the fermented ingredient, whereas &quot;prahok&quot; (, ) and &quot;kapi&quot; (, ) have more homogeneous consistency than &quot;mam&quot;.

 is prepared by adding a mixture of salt, roasted red sticky rice, and palm sugar to snakehead fillets and fermenting them for more than a year. The palm sugar and rice give &quot;mam&quot; an earthier and sweeter flavour and a reddish tone. &quot;Prahok&quot;, on the other hand, can either be made from small fish with all the bones and less salt (called &quot;prahok chhoeung&quot;) or large deboned fish and more salt (called &quot;prahok sach&quot; (, )), which in turn can be made from larger fish (such as the striped snakehead ()) or smaller fish (such as &quot;trei kamplienh&quot;), with or without roe. Roe can be removed from the fish, cleaned, drained, and fermented separately. &quot;Kapi&quot; is made by pounding cleaned, dried, and salted shrimp into a homogeneous paste, sun-drying it for one day, pounding the paste again, sun-drying it for two more days, and pounding the paste for the final time to attain a viscous consistency.

&quot;Prahok&quot; is used as flavouring for almost every Khmer dish, mixed with rice or served as a dipping sauce (, ). It can also be prepared into dishes of its own, such as &quot;prahok k&#x27;tis&quot; (, ), &quot;prahok kap&quot; (, ), &quot;teuk khreung&quot;, &quot;teuk prahok&quot; &quot;prahok ang&quot; (, ), and &quot;prahok chien&quot; (, ). Fermented roe (, ) is primarily eaten with steamed eggs, omelettes, and other hen or duck egg dishes. &quot;Kapi&quot; is often mixed with sugar, garlic, lime juice, chili, and crushed peanuts and used as a dipping sauce for vegetables, fruit, meat, and fish.

Other sauces used in the Cambodian cuisine include fish sauce (, ), oyster sauce (, ), soy sauce (, ; , ; , or , ), tamarind sauce (, ) and hoisin sauce (). Fish sauce is an important ingredient in Khmer cooking, used to add saltiness to soups and noodle dishes, marinate meats, or as a dipping sauce for fish. Mixed with ingredients, such as garlic, ginger, and lime juice, it is used as a sauce for spring rolls, salads, and noodles.
 Oyster sauce was introduced by Chinese immigrants and has become a common ingredient in Cambodian cooking used to add a tangy-sweet flavour to meats and stir-fried vegetables. Oyster sauce, along with fish sauce and soy sauce, is commonly used together when seasoning foods. Soy sauce is also a common ingredient and condiment, mixed with garlic or aged radish to be eaten with primarily high-protein dishes, as well as used to add saltiness when fish sauce is not used. Tamarind sauce is made from tamarind paste mixed with fish sauce, garlic, chili peppers, lime juice, palm sugar, and vinegar.

===Herbs and spices===
The most common herbs and spices in Cambodian cuisine are sweet basil (, ), coriander (, ), hot mint (, ), turmeric (, ), garlic, ginger (, ), galangal (, ), kaffir lime leaves (ស្លឹក, ), neem leaves (ស្លឹក, ), peppermint (, ), lemongrass (, ), chives (, ), scallions, saw leaf herb (, ), fingerroot (, ), and rice paddy herb.

Certain regions in Cambodia are known for their spices. Kampot pepper and Kampong Speu palm sugar (, ) have been granted Geographical Indications in Cambodia and protected geographical indication in the European Union. Cardamom Mountains in Southwest Cambodia are famous for their large population of wild cardamom plants.

The cultivation of peppercorns in Cambodia dates back to at least the 13th century, and because of its &quot;uniquely strong yet delicate aroma&quot; and &quot;slightly sweet eucalyptus taste,&quot; Kampot pepper is often regarded as the world&#x27;s best pepper.

====&quot;Kroeung&quot;====
&quot;Kroeung&quot; (, – &#x27;ingredients&#x27;) is a Khmer fresh flavouring paste commonly used in curries, soups, and stir-fries, one of the essential ingredients of Cambodian cuisine. The base of the paste consists of pounded lemongrass, galangal, garlic, shallots, kaffir lime leaves, and turmeric. There are five common types of &quot;kroeung&quot;: yellow &quot;kroeung&quot; (&quot;kroeung samlor m’chu&quot;), green &quot;kroeung&quot; (&quot;kroeung samlar kako&quot;), and red &quot;kroeung&quot; (&quot;kroeung samlor kari&quot;), as well as &quot;k’tis kroeung&quot; (&quot;kroeung samlor k’tis&quot;), and &quot;saraman kroeung&quot; (&quot;kroeung samlor saraman&quot;), each with different uses.

===Vegetables===
Vegetables are a major component in Cambodian cooking and the second highest quantity of foodstuff consumed after rice, making up 70–80% of a dish. The Cambodian diet consists heavily of leaf vegetables, such as water morning glory (, ), cabbage (, ), Chinese kale (, ), betel (ស្លឹក, ), vine spinach (, ), and watercress (, ), which are used in soups, stir-fries (, ), and salads.

Cambodian cuisine also uses different squashes, such as bitter melon (, ), winter melon (, ), kabocha, and luffa (, ); root vegetables, such as carrots (, ), cassava (, ), lotus rhizomes (, ), potatoes (, ), radish (, ), sweet potatoes (, ), and jicama (, or , ); and other vegetables, such as cucumbers (, ), eggplants (, ), tomatoes (, ), cauliflower (, ), chayotes (, ), shallots (, ), yardlong beans (, ), and maize (, ). Many unripe fruits, such as papaya, green banana, and mango, are also used as vegetables.

===Fruits===
Fruits in Cambodia are so popular that they have their own royal court. Durian (, ) is considered the &quot;king&quot;, mangosteen the &quot;queen&quot;, sapodilla () the &quot;prince&quot;, and milk fruit (, ) the &quot;princess&quot;. Other popular fruit include kuy fruit (, ), romduol, pineapple (, ), rose apple, jackfruit (ផ្លែ; ), papaya (, ), watermelon (, ), banana (, ), mango (, ), rambutan (, ), guava (, ), longan (, ), and tamarind (, ).

Although fruits are usually considered desserts, some, such as ripe mangoes, watermelon, and pineapples, are commonly eaten with heavily salted fish with plain rice. Fruits are also made into smoothies (, ). Popular fruits for smoothies are durian, mangos, and bananas. Sun-dried limes boiled in sugar and salt water are used in chicken and duck soups, sauces with fish, as well as beverages.

Since 2018, Koh Trong pomelos (, ) are recognized as one of the geographical indications in Cambodia. Pomelos grown in the Kratié Province&#x27;s Koh Trong commune are known for their sweeter taste and the absence of seeds after ripening.

===Fish and meat===

There are more than 900 different freshwater and saltwater fish species found in Cambodia. Approximately 475,000 tons of fish (, ) are caught in Cambodia every year, and a Cambodian annually consumes 63 kg of fish on average. They are fried, dried, smoked, and fermented into &quot;prahok&quot; and fish sauce. Fish and fish-based products are eaten two to three times a day. Popular fish are snakeheads, snappers, catfishes (, ), and mackerels. Cambodian chef Luu Meng has estimated that approximately 40–50% of Cambodian dishes are made with fish.

In the late-13th-century Khmer Empire, cows were only used for pulling carts, and geese had been recently introduced by the Chinese sailors. Since the 1980s, the role of meat in the Cambodian diet has increased significantly, and nowadays the consumption of meat, such as beef (, ), pork (, ), and poultry, has become common, especially in the capital region. In Siem Reap, ground pork or beef is made into spicy or sweet and savoury sausages (, (pork); , (beef)) that are eaten with steamed white rice, congee, or baguettes.

Other seafood includes an array of shellfish such as crabs (, ), clams, cockles (, ), crayfish (, ), shrimp, and squid (, ). Boiled or fried cockles seasoned with salt, chili, and garlic are sold as a popular street food. Giant freshwater prawns are usually only eaten by middle- and upper-class Cambodians because of their price. More unusual varieties of meat include frogs (, ; most commonly eaten are East Asian bullfrogs, rice field frogs, balloon frogs, banded bullfrogs, yellow frogs, and Asian common toads), turtles (, ), and arthropods (such as tarantulas (, ), fire ants, grasshoppers (, ), giant water bugs, and crickets (, )). Crickets, water bugs, and tarantulas are seasoned with salt, sugar, and oil, deep-fried, and sold as street food.

===Noodles===

Cambodian noodles are made out of rice, wheat, and tapioca flour (, ) in varying thickness. Wheat noodles, such as the hand-pulled noodles ( (), a loanword from Teochew 面) and the thinner wheat vermicelli (, ), have been adopted from the Chinese cuisine and incorporated into distinct Cambodian noodle soups and stir-fries. Rice noodles include the indigenous lightly fermented &quot;num banhchok&quot; (), as well as rice vermicelli (, ), &quot;banh sung&quot; (, ), silver needle noodles (, ), and &quot;banh hoi&quot; ().

==Food stalls==

In Khmer, &quot;haan bai&quot; ( ) is a generic term for food stalls serving both made-to-order and pre-prepared food (usually from large aluminum pots). In Phnom Penh, &quot;haan bai&quot; account for nearly four fifths of all meals eaten outside the house, with pre-prepared food venues or soup-pot restaurants accounting for nearly three-quarters of meals eaten at a &quot;haan bai&quot;. Soup-pot restaurants are the most popular dining format among Cambodians and their popularity is inversely correlated with socioeconomic status.

The Khmer word &quot;haan&quot; () is a borrowing from Chinese &quot;háng&quot; (&quot;store&quot;, &quot;business&quot;). More specifically the stalls are referred to by the main food served, for example, rice noodle stalls (, ) or coffee stalls (, ).

==Dishes==
===Stews and curries===

The Khmer term &quot;samlor&quot; () encompasses a wide variety of stews and curries, which are staples in Cambodian cuisine. These curries are typically served with rice, fresh noodles, or a baguette. and often include seafood, chicken, beef, or pork. Vegetarian Cambodian curries are less common. Popular Cambodian curries are fish amok, &quot;num banhchok&quot;, &quot;kari sach moan&quot;, sour beef curry and curry leaf chicken. The word &quot;kari&quot; (, ) specifically refers to an Indian-style curry and is believed to be a loanword from Tamil. Curries play an important role in ceremonial occasions in Cambodia and are distinctive for their use of sweet potatoes, setting them apart from other Asian curries.

=== Stir-fries ===
Cambodian stir-fries combine aromatic ingredients with strong flavours, such as lemongrass, galangal, holy basil and garlic. An essential component of Cambodian stir-fry dishes is fish sauce and oyster sauce, which provide a pungent, umami-rich base, balanced by lime juice, palm sugar and other milder ingredients. The Khmer term &quot;cha&quot; (), borrowed from Chinese, refers to the method of sautéing or stir-frying, which has been integrated into Cambodian cuisine from Chinese cuisine. The Khmer verb &quot;kha&quot; (), on the other hand, refers to the technique of stewing in soy sauce and could be ascribed to Vietnamese &quot;kho&quot;.

=== Salads ===
Vegetables and fruits are the foundation of many Cambodian salads, for example, green cabbage form the basis of &quot;neorm&quot; salads. Fruits, especially unripe ones, are also frequently used, such as green papaya in &quot;bok lahong&quot; and green mango in &quot;neorm svay&quot;. Common herbs in Cambodian salads include lemongrass, mint, Asian basil, and cilantro. Popular spices that add pungency to these dishes are garlic, ginger, shallots, and Kampot pepper. Dressings and favouring, such as fish or soy sauce, lime juice, vinegar, and white or palm sugar are often used to balance saltiness, acidity, and sweetness. Sugar is used to counterbalance the intensity of lime juice or other sour ingredients. Almost all Cambodian salads include some form of animal protein, such as beef, chicken, pork, or seafood, and sometimes even raw or marinated meat. Some of the most popular Cambodian salads are &quot;neorm svay&quot; (), &quot;pleah sach ko&quot; (), &quot;neorm trasak&quot;, &quot;neorm masour&quot;, &quot;neorm kroch thlong&quot; and &quot;larb&quot; (which can be made with chicken, pork, or beef).

===Desserts===
Desserts are eaten at the end of a meal or throughout the day as a snack by Cambodians. There are four main types of Cambodian desserts: rice-based desserts, fruit-based desserts, puddings (, ), and custards. Steaming and grilling are the most common cooking techniques for Cambodian desserts, whereas deep-frying is often used to make pastries as baking is not very widespread in Cambodia outside of commercial bakeries. For rice-based desserts, glutinous rice and rice flour are most frequently used. Popular Cambodian rice-based desserts are &quot;num ansom chek&quot;, &quot;num plae ai&quot; () and &quot;num chak chol&quot; (). In fruit-based desserts, fruit, such as mango, jackfruit, papaya, and guava, are often combined with pandan leaf extract, banana leaves, coconut milk, cream, or shavings. &quot;Bey dom neib&quot; is an essential fruit-based Khmer dessert that blends the fragrance and sweetness of ripe mangoes and coconut. Cambodian puddings are generally made with coconut milk or cream and tapioca pearls, and are eaten either hot or chilled, with ice cubes. Two common Cambodian puddings are with sweetcorn (, ) and mung beans (, ).

== Beverages ==
Water is the most popular drink. As drinking water sources are not always easily accessible in rural areas water is boiled at home and consumed hot. In urban areas bottled water, as well as soda and sweetened fruit beverages, are available. Green tea (, ) is consumed throughout the day. It is believed to have been introduced in the Khmer Empire by the Chinese, but despite the growing consumption and suitable climate nowadays most green tea is imported and very little is grown locally. &quot;Camellia sinensis cambodiensis&quot;, a local strain of the tea plant, grows in the Kirirom National Park, in the remnants of a former 300-hectare tea plantation established in the 1960s by the King Norodom Sihanouk, and the area around Chamkar Te village in Mondulkiri Province. Recently, there have been efforts to revive the Cambodian tea production. Sweet tea (, ) is also prepared and consumed.

In urban areas coffee (, ) is also popular and is usually served with sweetened condensed milk rather than black. Coffee can be consumed either iced (, ) or hot. It is sold in coffee carts, coffeehouse chains and specialty coffee shops. More than 90% of all coffee in Cambodia is imported from other countries, such as Vietnam, Laos, and Thailand.

Smoothies (, ) are made out of mixed fruit juice and are sold in food markets. Soy milk (, ) is sold in the morning by street vendors; the green version is sweetened and thicker than the unsweetened white. Served either hot or cold, sweetened or unsweetened. Sugarcane juice (, ) is also a popular street drink made by pressing the juice out of sugarcane stalks with a special machine. Served with ice and sometimes flavoured with citrus to balance the sweetness. Pandan juice (, ) is made from the extract of pandan leaves and usually sold in Cambodian food stalls.

=== Fermented beverages ===

Five fermented alcoholic beverages were produced in the late-13th century Khmer Empire: mead, &quot;pengyasi&quot; made from the leaves of an unidentified plant, &quot;baolengjiao&quot; made from rice hulls and rice leftovers, &quot;sugar-shine wine&quot; made from sugar and palm starch wine made from the starch of the leaves of a palm growing on the riverbank.

Nowadays, the most popular alcoholic beverage is beer (, ). The first domestically brewed beer was produced in the 1930s during the French Indochina period by the &quot;Brasseries &amp; Glacières de L&#x27;Indochine&quot; company in Phnom Penh. In 1995, the annual beer consumption per capita was only around two liters, but by 2004 it began to rise significantly and in 2010 beer overtook spirits as the most popular alcoholic beverage in Cambodia. Currently, the four biggest beer producers in Cambodia are the Cambrew Brewery, Cambodia Brewery, Khmer Brewery and Kingdom Breweries. Recently, there has also been a quickly growing craft beer scene with 12 brewpubs or microbreweries operating in Cambodia in 2019.

In rural areas, rice wine (, ) and palm wine (, ) are the most consumed alcoholic beverages. Rice wine is produced by fermenting boiled and dried rice with a natural fermentation starter (&quot;dom bai&quot;) for at least 24 hours and distilling the resulting mixture. Modern distillation methods were introduced during the French Indochina period. Occasionally, there have been instances of methanol poisoning from low quality home-made rice wine. Rice wine can be infused with various herbs, roots, bark and insects to create medicinal rice wines (&quot;srah tinum&quot;). A popular drink infused with deer antlers and different herbs is the Special Muscle Wine manufactured since 1968 by Lao Hang Heng Wine. The company also produces popular Golden Muscle Liquor and Wrestler Red Wine, whereas Sombai manufactures a line of premium infused rice wines.

Palm wine is a lower-prestige alcoholic beverage. It might have become popular during the French Indochina period as a cheap alternative to other wines. Palm wine is produced by fermenting Asian palmyra palm sap either through spontaneous fermentation by adding several plants to the sap and hanging the containers on trees or through the addition of a fermentation starter (, ) made from fermented palm sap and various dried plant xylems and bark. Confirel in Pou Senchey District uses the Champagne method to produce sparkling palm wine under the name &quot;Thnot Sparkling Mekong Wine&quot;.

A regional beverage of the Mondulkiri province is yellow and purple passion fruit wine, while wine from jambolan is produced by a company in Takéo province. Samai Distillery, Cambodia&#x27;s first rum distillery, produces rum and even uses Kampot peppercorns in one of its products. Cambodia&#x27;s first and only winery Chan Thai Choeung In Battambang has been commercially producing grape wine since 2005.

== Meals and eating etiquette ==
In Cambodia, meals are usually freshly prepared three times a day (for breakfast, lunch and dinner), although in rural areas only breakfast and dinner may be eaten. Due to a general lack of refrigeration, leftovers are usually eaten the same day or reheated for the next day. A typical Cambodian breakfast consists of rice porridge with dried salted fish, rice with dried salted fish and vegetables, baguette with condensed milk or rice/egg noodles with meat and leaf vegetables. For lunch and dinner, Cambodians usually eat steamed rice, soup with meat (fish, pork, chicken or beef) and leaf vegetables, fried fish or other meat and fruit. In the wet season, Cambodian meals contain considerably more rice, vegetables, starchy root vegetables and tubers, as well as condiments and spices.

In Cambodian meals just like the rest of Southeast Asia, all dishes are served and eaten simultaneously, as opposed to the European course-based meal format or the Chinese meal with overlapping courses. The only exception is if the meal contains French-style dishes, in which case the dishes are served in courses. A number of side dishes are usually served alongside the main dishes. In addition to that, a variety of condiments, such as chili jam, pickled green chillies, sugar, garlic flakes, fish sauce and soy sauce, are also available. While steamed rice and soups are usually served hot, side dishes may be served at room temperature. The balance of flavours and satisfaction of individual preferences are achieved by combining the individual dishes and rice. For example, a Cambodian meal may consist of a sour soup, a salty fish, fried vegetables and plain rice, which is different from Thai food where sourness, saltiness, sweetness and spiciness are usually contained within a single dish.

Khmer food is traditionally eaten with hands, but nowadays spoons, forks and chopsticks are also used. Knives are rarely used as the majority of Cambodian food is already cut into bite-sized pieces. Forks and spoons were introduced by the French and are used for eating rice and/or soup-based dishes, whereas chopsticks were introduced by the Chinese and are used only for eating noodle dishes.

== International popularity ==
Cambodian cuisine is not very known across the world. Food Republic has described Cambodian as &quot;The Greatly Underappreciated Outlier In Asian Cooking&quot;. Fodor&#x27;s Travel has called Cambodian cuisine &quot;the most underrated in Southeast Asia&quot; and Siem Reap &quot;SE Asia’s Most Underrated Food Destination&quot;, while the magazine &quot;Time Out&quot; has named Kep one of &quot;18 of the world’s most underrated food cities&quot;

Outside of Cambodia, Cambodian cuisine can generally be found in countries with sizeable Cambodian diaspora, such as the United States, France, Australia and Canada, especially in the Little Cambodia ethnic enclaves, but it is often aimed towards the local Cambodian community. Due to commercial considerations and the ethnic composition of the Cambodian diaspora many Cambodian-owned restaurants have chosen to serve the better-known Thai, Chinese and Vietnamese food instead.

== Culinary diplomacy ==
In December 2020, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and International Cooperation launched an official &quot;Food Diplomacy 2021–2023&quot; campaign as part of a larger economic diplomacy strategy. At the launch Minister of Foreign Affairs and International Cooperation Prak Sokhonn listed &quot;prahok&quot;, fish amok, &quot;neorm kroch thlong&quot;, &quot;samlor kako&quot;, &quot;samlor ktis&quot;, &quot;prahok ktis&quot; and &quot;num banhchok&quot; as some of the Khmer dishes to be promoted in the campaign. The ministry also established a program to train Cambodian cooks for serving in Cambodian embassies and a program for providing ambassador spouses with knowledge about the Khmer cuisine.

In February 2021, the ministry published a cookbook &quot;The Taste of Angkor&quot; as a culinary promotion tool for Cambodian diplomatic missions abroad. A 1960 Cambodian cookbook and culinary guide &quot;The Culinary Art of Cambodia&quot; by Princess Norodom Rasmi Sobbhana republished in May 2021 by Angkor Database was also included in the campaign. In June 2021, a series of promotional videos under the slogan &quot;Taste Cambodia&quot; featuring Khmer foods and culinary activities in different Cambodian regions commissioned by the Ministry of Tourism of Cambodia were released. In May 2022, culinary training and representation facilities under the name of &quot;Angkor Kitchen&quot; were unveiled at the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and International Cooperation.

<text>Jean-Sébastien Giguère (; born May 16, 1977) is a Canadian former professional ice hockey goaltender. He played with the Halifax Mooseheads in the Quebec Major Junior Hockey League (QMJHL), and was drafted 13th overall by the Hartford Whalers in the 1995 NHL Entry Draft. He played in the Calgary Flames organization for three seasons before joining the Mighty Ducks of Anaheim in 2000.

In the 2003 NHL playoffs, Giguère anchored the seventh-seeded Mighty Ducks into the Stanley Cup Finals, where he became the fifth player in NHL history to win the Conn Smythe Trophy despite not winning the Stanley Cup in the same season. Giguere ultimately won the Stanley Cup with the Ducks in 2007.

His later career included stints in Toronto and Colorado. Giguère holds the Anaheim Ducks&#x27; franchise record for career wins and shutouts and was the last active NHL player who had played for the Hartford Whalers.

==Playing career==

===Early career===
As a youth, Giguère played in the 1990 and 1991 Quebec International Pee-Wee Hockey Tournaments with a minor ice hockey team from the Mille Îles area of Laval, Quebec.

After his four-year major junior career that included QMJHL Second Team All-Star honours in 1997, the Hartford Whalers drafted Giguère 13th overall in the 1995 NHL Entry Draft with a pick acquired from the New York Rangers in exchange for Pat Verbeek. Giguère made his NHL debut with the Whalers, playing eight games at the end of the 1996–97 season.

On August 25, 1997 (by which time the Whalers had relocated to become the Carolina Hurricanes), Giguère was traded to the Calgary Flames, along with centre Andrew Cassels, for forward Gary Roberts and goaltender Trevor Kidd. Giguère then played the entirety of the 1997–98 season in the American Hockey League (AHL) with Calgary&#x27;s minor league affiliate, the Saint John Flames. He recorded a 2.46 goals against average (GAA) and a .926 save percentage in 31 games in his professional rookie season with Saint John. Giguère spent a total of four seasons in the Flames organization, making brief 15- and seven-game appearances with Calgary in 1998–99 and 1999–2000, respectively, while spending most of his time in the AHL.

===Anaheim Ducks (2000–2010)===
On June 10, 2000, Giguère was traded to the Mighty Ducks of Anaheim in exchange for a second-round pick in 2000 (later traded to the Washington Capitals; the Capitals selected Matt Pettinger). He began the 2000-01 season with the Mighty Ducks&#x27; farm team, the Cincinnati Mighty Ducks, until he was recalled from the AHL. Giguère eventually took over Dominic Roussel&#x27;s backup position to starter Guy Hebert. Due to only brief stints in the NHL during his tenures with Hartford and Calgary, the 2000–01 season qualified as Giguère&#x27;s rookie NHL season. He played in 34 games, posting a 2.57 GAA and .911 save percentage.

In the off-season, he was re-signed by the Mighty Ducks on August 17, 2001. Giguère continued to improve in 2001–02, his first full season with the Ducks, recording a 2.13 GAA and .920 save percentage in 53 games. In the 2002–03 season, he posted his first winning season with a 34–22–6 record, as well as a career-high eight shutouts.

Giguère&#x27;s first winning season in the NHL helped the Mighty Ducks enter the 2003 playoffs as the seventh seed in the Western Conference. From that point, Giguere delivered one of the greatest playoff performances in NHL history as he helped lead the team on a Cinderella run to their first Stanley Cup Finals. Facing the defending Stanley Cup champions and second-seeded Detroit Red Wings in the opening round, Giguère set an NHL record for most saves by a goaltender in their playoff debut with 63 in the Mighty Ducks&#x27; 2–1 triple overtime win in Game 1, surpassing Toronto Maple Leafs goaltender Jiří Crha&#x27;s mark by two saves. This record would later be broken by the Vancouver Canucks&#x27; Roberto Luongo, who stopped 72 shots in his playoff debut against the Dallas Stars in 2007. The Ducks would proceed to shock the hockey world by sweeping the Red Wings in four games, with Giguère labelled as the star of the series. The Mighty Ducks then faced Dallas. Giguère stopped 60 of 63 Dallas shots in the series opener, a five-overtime Anaheim win. He recorded his first shutout of the playoffs in Game 4, stopping 28 shots. The Mighty Ducks eventually eliminated the Stars in six games, and moved on to the Western Conference Finals to face the Minnesota Wild. Giguère held the Wild to an all-time, best-of-seven-series low of one goal in the entire series, which included a franchise-record shutout streak of 217 minutes and 54 seconds (later surpassed by Ilya Bryzgalov in 2006).

However, the Mighty Ducks&#x27; dream of hoisting the Stanley Cup was stopped by the New Jersey Devils, to whom Anaheim lost in a seven-game series. Giguère finished the playoffs undefeated in seven overtime games, setting a record for the longest playoff overtime shutout streak at 168 minutes and 27 seconds. He finished with a 15–6 record overall, a 1.62 GAA and .945 save percentage, as well as fewer losses than Finals counterpart Martin Brodeur. He was the fifth player to receive the Conn Smythe Trophy as playoff MVP as part of the losing team and the first since Philadelphia Flyers goaltender Ron Hextall won in 1987. Along with the Conn Smythe, he received the 2003 ESPY award for Best Hockey Player. The only other goalie ever to do so is Dominik Hašek.

Giguère&#x27;s playoff MVP performance was rewarded in the off-season with a four-year contract extension, signed on September 10, 2003. However, his performance was inconsistent throughout much of the 2003–04 season as the Mighty Ducks missed the 2004 playoffs. Giguère posted a 17–31–6 record and his GAA increased to 2.62. Due to the 2004–05 NHL lock-out that cancelled the entire 2004–05 NHL season, Giguère went overseas to play for the Hamburg Freezers in Germany.

Giguère returned to an improved Mighty Ducks squad as NHL play resumed in 2005–06. Anaheim returned to the playoffs and made it to the Western Conference Finals, where they were eliminated by the Edmonton Oilers. Giguère, however, appeared in just four games, as Russian rookie backup Ilya Bryzgalov took over the starting position during the post-season. Giguère missed the first game of the opening round against Calgary due to injury, but returned for Games 2 through 5. During Game 5, Giguère was pulled after allowing three goals on eight shots, where Bryzgalov took over and subsequently reeled off three-straight shutouts spanning the first and second rounds against Calgary and the Colorado Avalanche, tying an NHL playoff record and breaking Giguère&#x27;s 2003 club record of consecutive playoff shutout minutes.

Entering the final season of his contract in 2006–07, Giguère reclaimed the starter&#x27;s role. In the first month of the season, October 2006, he did not lose a single game in regulation. He proceeded to put up a career-high 36 wins in 56 games. Prior to the beginning of the 2007 playoffs, Giguère and his wife welcomed a newborn son. Giguère missed the Ducks&#x27; last three regular season games as well as the first three games of their opening round matchup with Minnesota, with Bryzgalov taking over in Giguère&#x27;s absence. Giguère returned late in the series and was the Ducks&#x27; starter the rest of the way. During the second round against Vancouver, his eight-game overtime winning streak in the playoffs was snapped on April 27, 2007, in a 2–1 defeat in Game 2. Nevertheless, Giguère and the Ducks went on to eliminate the Canucks en route to the 2007 Stanley Cup Finals, where they won their first-ever Stanley Cup championship in a 6–2 Game 5 win over the Ottawa Senators on June 6.

On June 21, 2007, the Ducks announced that they had re-signed Giguère to a multi-year contract. Giguère posted a 35–17–6 record with a career-best 2.12 GAA in the 2007–08 season. Despite his personal numbers, however, the defending champion Ducks were defeated in the first round of the 2008 playoffs by the Dallas Stars in six games.

Giguère recorded sub-par numbers during the 2008–09 season, going 19–18–6 with a 3.10 GAA, sharing an increased amount of playing time to his backup Jonas Hiller. This did not deter him from being voted into the 2009 NHL All-Star Game in his hometown of Montreal. As Hiller outplayed Giguère throughout the season, he was chosen over Giguère to start during the 2009 playoffs. Giguère&#x27;s only appearance for the Ducks in the playoffs was in relief of Hiller in the third period of Game 4 of the Ducks&#x27; second round series with the Detroit Red Wings, to whom the Ducks would eventually fall in seven games.

Giguère suffered a groin strain early in the 2009–10 season on October 24, 2009. With Hiller&#x27;s continued emergence as a bona fide starter, Giguère publicly told &quot;L.A. Daily News&quot; on November 10 that he &quot;would rather retire than be a backup goalie,&quot; fuelling a goaltending controversy on the team. Losing his starting position to Hiller, he did not record his first win of the season until November 23 in a 3–2 shootout victory over the Calgary Flames.

===Toronto Maple Leafs (2010–2011)===

Giguère was traded to the Toronto Maple Leafs on January 31, 2010, in exchange for goaltender Vesa Toskala and forward Jason Blake. Three days later, Giguère played his first game for the Maple Leafs and recorded a 30-save shutout against the New Jersey Devils. He registered another shutout in his next game against Ottawa on February 6 to become the first goalie in franchise history to record shutouts in his first two games. This accomplishment led Giguère to be named the NHL&#x27;s Second Star of the Week on February 8. After having recorded a 3.14 GAA and .900 save percentage in 20 games with the Ducks before being traded, he improved to a 2.49 GAA and .916 save percentage in 15 games with Toronto.

The following season, Giguère suffered a groin injury in mid-November 2010, sidelining him for three weeks. Upon his return, he played in several games before re-injuring his groin. During that time, the Leafs were in need of a goaltender, forcing them to call-up James Reimer from the AHL&#x27;s Toronto Marlies, who took over the starter&#x27;s position in Giguère&#x27;s absence.

===Colorado Avalanche (2011–2014)===
On July 1, 2011, free agent Giguère signed a two-year, $2.5 million contract with the Colorado Avalanche. He embraced his role in the Colorado locker room as the veteran mentor, especially for young starting goaltender Semyon Varlamov. Giguère&#x27;s leadership was key in a four-game home stand in mid-December when Varlamov was sidelined with a back ailment; Giguère started all four games and won them all, securing the Avalanche a team-record, eight-straight wins at home. It was the most consecutive home wins the franchise had seen since the Quebec Nordiques won ten-straight in 1995 before the club moved to Denver later that year to become the Avalanche. Giguère was named one of the three NHL&#x27;s three stars of the week for late December. A groin pull on February 15, 2012, during a losing effort to the Vancouver Canucks, however, sidelined Giguère, allowing Varlamov the opportunity to redeem himself and reclaim the starting position in net for the remainder of the race to the 2012 playoffs, which Colorado ultimately did not qualify for. On August 13, 2012, Giguère signed a one-year, US$1.5 million contract extension through the 2013–14 season.

==Post-playing career==

On May 26, 2014, reports surfaced that Giguère was prepared to retire, and had likely played in his final NHL game, amidst much speculation. In what proved to be his final NHL start, Colorado&#x27;s regular season finale in Anaheim, he received a video tribute and warm ovation from the crowd. At the end of the game, Giguère shared a victory lap with former teammate Teemu Selänne, who had already confirmed his own retirement and was playing in his final regular season game. On August 21, Giguère formally announced his retirement. He was the last active NHL player to have played for the Hartford Whalers.

==Personal life==
Giguère was born in Montreal, Quebec, but grew up in Blainville, Quebec. Giguère&#x27;s father died of cancer on December 15, 2008, and this greatly affected his performance for the rest of the season. Giguère went into the All-Star Game that year with a very weak record, with only one win in his last nine games. Giguère&#x27;s mother died in late February 2013.

Giguère suffers from a rare gastric condition that causes his body to take in too much air when he drinks fluids. As a result, his body has difficulty absorbing water, leading to severe dehydration when he sweats. He would drink from a water bottle fitted with a straw while playing hockey.

<text>The Supreme Court of Pakistan (; &quot;Adālat-e-Uzma Pākistān&quot;) is the apex court in the judicial hierarchy of the Islamic Republic of Pakistan.

Established in accordance with Part VII of the Constitution of Pakistan, it has ultimate and extensive appellate, original, and advisory jurisdictions on all courts (including the high courts, district, special and Shariat court), involving issues of laws and may act on the verdicts rendered on the cases in context in which it enjoys jurisdiction. In the court system of Pakistan, the Supreme Court is the final arbiter of legal and constitutional disputes as well as final interpreter of constitutional law, and the highest court of appeal in Pakistan.

Currently, the Supreme Court is incorporated of Chief Justice of Pakistan, twenty-one justices, one Acting judge, two &quot;ad hoc&quot; judges and two ad-hoc appointments for Shariat Appellate Bench. Once appointed, justices are expected to complete a designated term and then retire at 65 years old, unless their term is terminated through resignation or impeachment by the supreme judicial committee resulted in a presidential reference in regards to the misconduct of judge(s). In their discourse judgement, the justices are often categorized as having the conservative, textual, moderate, and liberal philosophies of law in their judicial interpretation of law and judgements.

The Supreme Court has a permanent seat in Islamabad and meets at the Supreme Court Building at the Red Zone.

==History==


In 1861, the British government in India enacted the Indian High Courts Act that created the high courts in all over the Indian subcontinent in various provinces while abolishing the supreme courts Calcutta, Bombay, Madras, Lahore, and also the &quot;Panchayati&quot; system in autonomous presidencies.

Until the enactment of the Government of India Act 1935 in 1935 that created the Federal Court, these new high courts had the distinctionary powers of being the highest Courts for all cases. The Federal Court had wide range of jurisdictions to resolve disputes between the provinces, presidencies, and the Government of India Act 1935, often hearing appeals against judgements of the High Courts.

After the partition of India in 1947, the Federal Court was also partitioned between India and Pakistan as Justice Sir Harilal Kania became the first Chief Justice of India and Justice Sir Abdul Rashid becoming the first Chief Justice of Pakistan.

While the tradition of British law culture continues to remain an integral part of the judiciary, the modern existence of the Supreme Court of Pakistan came when the first set of the Constitution of Pakistan was promulgated on 23 March 1956. The ratification of the Constitution of Pakistan reestablished the Supreme Court in 1956, replacing the name &quot;Federal Court&quot; to &quot;Supreme Court&quot;, initially had its seat in Karachi where the Sindh High Court exists now. In successive years, the Supreme Court was moved to Lahore High Court until the Supreme Court was permanently moved into its new building constructed in Islamabad in 1964.

==Constitutional composition==
===Constitution of the court===

Although the Supreme Court was established pursuant to the Government of India Act 1935, the modern structure of the court was reestablished by the second set in 1956, and restructured by the Constitution of Pakistan in 1973 where a significant part of the Constitution is dedicated towards the restructuring of the Supreme Court.

The Part VII of the Constitution, ranges from articles 176 through 191, deals with the powers, composition, rules, and responsibilities of the Supreme Court.

These articles concern:
* Article 176 – Composition of the Court
* Article 177 – Appointment and qualifications of the Chief Justice
* Article 178 – Oath of office
* Article 179 – Retirement
* Article 180 – Vacancy, absence, or inability of the Chief Justice
* Article 181 – Vacancy, absence, or inability of other justices
* Article 182 – Ad hoc appointments of justices
* Article 183 – Location of Court
* Article 184 – Jurisdiction in a dispute between two or more governments
* Article 185 – Jurisdiction to hear and determine appeals
* Article 186 – If requested, advise the President on important matters of law
* Article 186A – Authority to transfer venue
* Article 187 – Orders and subpoenas
* Article 188 – Power to review its own judgements and orders
* Article 189 – Binding nature of Supreme Court&#x27;s decisions on all other Pakistani Courts
* Article 190 – All executive and judicial authorities in Pakistan bound to aid the Supreme Court

===Size of Court===
The Part VII of the Constitution of Pakistan reconstituted the composition of Supreme Court and the high courts but it does not specify the number of justices to be served in the Supreme Court. Qualifications to be served as a supreme court justice are strictly imposed that are based on merit, personal intellectualism, and experiences as a judge in the high courts.

In 1947, the Supreme Court consisted of a Chief Justice and six senior judges from Sindh, Punjab, NWFP, Balochistan, and East Bengal. Over the several successive years, the work of the Court increased and cases began to accumulate, leading the Supreme Court requesting the Parliament to increase the number of judges. As the number of the justices has increased, they sit in smaller benches of two or three (referred to as a &quot;division bench&quot;), however, coming together in larger benches of five or more (referred to as a constitution bench) when required to settle fundamental questions of law.

===Eligibility, nomination and confirmation===

The nomination of justices in the Supreme Court comes from an executive selection made by the Prime Minister based on judges&#x27; merited qualifications, personal intellectualism, and experiences as judge in high courts. The President then confirms the nomination summary and eventually appoints the Chief Justice and judges in the Supreme Court.

The Constitution states that a nominee is not eligible unless they are:

*A citizen of Pakistan who:
**has for a period of, or for periods aggregating, not less than five years been a judge of a High Court (including a High Court which existed in Pakistan at any time before the commencing day); or
**has for a period of, or for periods aggregating not less than fifteen years been an advocate of a High Court (including a High Court which existed in Pakistan at any time before the commencing day).
Since the 1990s, the nomination and confirmation process has attracted considerable attention from the print press and electronic media, as news media often comments on the executive&#x27;s selection for the appointment. Appointments of Chief Justices Saeeduzzaman Siddiqui, S.A. Shah, Iftikhar Chaudhry, Faisal Arab, and T.H. Jillani Saqib Nisar and Asif Saeed Khosa have gain prominent attention from media in all over the country, mainly due to their ideological and philosophical leanings.

Furthermore, the major and influential recommendations for judges to be elevated at the Supreme Court as justices comes from the Judicial Commission that is chaired by the Chief Justice of Pakistan who prepares the qualification summary before the nomination sent to executive.

====Ad–hoc appointments and removal====
There has been &quot;Ad hoc&quot; appointment in the Supreme Court made when the quorum of Judges is not possible to complete the sitting number of justices in the court, or if it is necessary to increase the number of justices in the Supreme Court. The nomination comes directly from the Judicial Commission chaired by the Chief Justice who prepares the nomination summary as President confirms their appointments.

As of current, there are two justices are on the &quot;ad hoc&quot; appointment that are from the Federal Sharia Court.

A judge of the Supreme Court can be removed under the Constitution only on grounds of proven misconduct or incapacity and by an order of the President of Pakistan. A written reference has to be sent to the Supreme Judicial Council that will conduct the hearings of allegations of misconduct that would determine the removal of judge.

===Tenureship, salaries and post-retirement===
The Judicial Commission determines the salary, other allowances, leave of absence, pension, etc. of the Supreme Court justices. A Supreme Court justice gets ₨. 558,907.00 ($5,333.85) with additional allowances of ₨. 259,009.00 ($2471.81). Other benefits include the free housing and medical treatment as well as tax-free electricity bills. A judge who has retired as a justice of the Supreme Court is debarred from practising in any court of law or before any other authority in Pakistan.

==Judicial independence==
The Supreme Court has the explicit &quot;de jure&quot; powers and enjoys the powerful judicial independence to block the exercise of certain Prime Minister&#x27;s executive powers or Parliament&#x27;s legislative powers that repugnant to Constitution. The Supreme Court has maintained its institutional integrity and has been able to maintain its authority to some degree in the face of martial law in Pakistan in last decades.

In another example of a &quot;de jure power&quot; granted to the Court, article 17 of the Constitution states:

The Supreme Court thus provides, in principle, an important safeguard against the abuse of laws that could potentially have politically repressive consequences or in clear violation of human rights.

The Constitution also allows the Supreme Court to exercise powers and take &quot;sua sponte&quot; actions against the person, regardless of its statue, or the authority, of being disobedient to or disrespectful towards the Supreme Court, its justices, and its officers in the form of behavior that opposes or defies the Supreme Court&#x27;s institutional integrity and popular authority.

In 1997, Chief Justice S.A. Shah found Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif of contempt of court but the order itself was voided by the Supreme Judicial Council. In 2012, Chief Justice Iftikhar Chaudhry retroactively barred Prime Minister Yousaf Raza Gillani of holding the office after the latter was found of in charges of court of contempt and refusing to follow the court&#x27;s orders.

In 2013, the Supreme Court took &quot;suo motu&quot; actions against populist Imran Khan of criticising against the judgement of the Supreme Court&#x27;s senior judges in regards to the elections. The case was later dropped when Attorney-General assured the Supreme Court justices that Imran Khan did not insubordinate the judiciary.

=== 26th constitutional amendment controversy ===
Pakistani politicians have historically voiced concerns over judicial involvement in governance, often calling for a recalibration of power between the judiciary and the legislature. On 21 October 2024, the National Assembly passed the 26th Amendment in an hours-long, overnight session. Previously, the senior-most judge in the Supreme Court would automatically succeed as Chief Justice upon the retirement of the incumbent at age 65. Under the new amendment, the Chief Justice of Pakistan will now be nominated by a Special Parliamentary Committee from among the three most senior judges of the Supreme Court, with a fixed term of three years.

The government, led by the Pakistan Muslim League (N) (PML-N) and supported by its coalition partner, the Pakistan People&#x27;s Party (PPP), has argued that the amendment is necessary to curb what it views as judicial overreach. Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif described the amendment as an assertion of legislative authority and a step toward restoring balance in Pakistan&#x27;s constitutional structure. Supporters claim that the judiciary&#x27;s previous involvement in political matters had, at times, led to decisions undermining elected governments and democracy itself.

The change prompted criticism and concern over its potential impact on judicial independence. Former Sindh High Court Bar Association president Salahuddin Ahmed shared a statement from the Karachi Bar Association that criticised the amendment&#x27;s passage, calling it a &quot;dark day in the democratic history&quot; of the country due to its approval in a &quot;non-transparent and hasty manner without any debate.&quot; In contrast, Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif referred to the amendment as a &quot;historical achievement,&quot; asserting that it reinforced &quot;parliamentary sovereignty.&quot; Interior Minister Mohsin Naqvi also lauded the legislation, claiming it would ensure &quot;speedy justice&quot; and facilitate &quot;positive reforms.&quot; While significant concerns about the amendment&#x27;s implications for judicial independence have been raised, supporters maintain that the changes aim to create a more efficient, accountable, and transparent judicial appointment process.

Lawmakers from the opposition party the Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI), criticised the amendments as an effort to weaken the judiciary and called it a &quot;black day&quot; in Pakistan&#x27;s constitutional history. United Nations Human Rights chief Volker Turk also expressed concern that the 26th Constitutional Amendment could significantly undermine the judiciary&#x27;s independence, stating that &quot;Constitutional reforms must be in line with international human rights law.&quot; The International Commission of Jurists (ICJ) similarly criticised the amendment, describing it as a &quot;blow to judicial independence.&quot; However, it also acknowledged that some reforms to the judicial system were needed to enhance efficiency and accountability.

===Court demographics===
In practice awarded by Constitution, judges of the supreme court have been selected so far, mostly from amongst judges of the high courts. The Constitution allows the judges to be appointed at the Supreme Court regardless of colour, race, and religious sect. Justices A.S.M. Akram, Fazal Akbar, Amin Ahmed, Abdus Sattar, Hameedur Rahman, and Hamoodur Rahman (Chief Justice) were the Bengali/Bihari jurists who served as senior justices in the Supreme Court. In 1960, Justice Alvin Robert Cornelius became the first Christian to be served as Chief Justice, while George Constantine also served in the Court.

In the 1970s–1980s, Justice Dorab Patel was the first Zorastrian, followed by Justice Rustom Sidwa who served as Supreme Court justice from 1989 until 1993. Justice Rana Bhagwandas was the first Hindu jurist who has distinction being the Chief Justice of Pakistan in 2007. Justice Qazi Faez Isa is of the Hazara descent who is currently serving as the Chief Justice of the Supreme Court.

In January 2022, Ayesha Malik was sworn in as the first female Supreme Court judge.

===Judicial and philosophical leanings===
The jurists/judges do not represent or receive the official political endorsements from the nation&#x27;s political parties which is an acceptable professional practice in the executive branch of the government. As their American counterparts in the U.S. Supreme Court, the Jurists philosophical leanings in the Supreme Court are often categorized as conservative, moderate, liberal, and textualist that reflected in their judicial interpretation of the judgements in the impending cases of importance.

In 1947, Governor-General Muhammad Ali Jinnah confirmed the nomination of Justice Sir Abdul Rashid, at the behest of Prime Minister Liaquat Ali-Khan, was said to be a national conservative leanings in his judgement. His successor, Chief Justice Muh&#x27;d Munir, was a liberal in his jurisprudence but sided with conservative judgement when validated dissolution of the first Constituent Assembly in 1954 and the National Assembly in 1958 in the light of doctrine of necessity. Under the Chief Justice Muh&#x27;d Shahabuddin, the Supreme Court had the conservative leanings in regards to the constitutionalism and their judgements in the cases of important issues. Chief Justice Shahabuddin plays a crucial role in drafting the second set of the Constitution of Pakistan which incorporated the liberal ideas with the important Islamic provisions.

In 1960, President Ayub Khan appointed Justice Alvin Robert Cornelius who took much liberal approach in his jurisprudence when deciding cases on fundamental rights against the executive overreach. Justice Cornelius led Supreme Court&#x27;s verdicts on many constitutional cases were carefully sided with the Islamic ideas but provided much broader role of liberal ideas to safeguard the fundamental rights of the ordinary citizens while being critical of the state emergency.

In 1968, the Supreme Court was greatly divided when Chief Justice Hamoodur Rahman presided the case hearings after President Yahya Khan declared martial law and suspended the writ of the constitution. In the views of Chief Justice Rahman, the martial law was invalid and notably ruled that Yahya Khan&#x27;s assumption of power was &quot;illegal usurpation&quot;. The Supreme Court also overruled and overturned its convictions that called for validation of martial law in 1958. Despite rulings, there was a split decision between the moderate justices, including Chief Justice Rahman, and conservative leaning justices of the Supreme Court who &quot;condoned&quot; the actions in the light of &quot;doctrine of necessity&quot;. The &quot;de jure&quot; powers of the Supreme Court have increased since presiding the War Enquiry Commission in 1974, intervening in the events that Supreme Court justices viewed as violation of human rights by the executive authorities.

In 1977, the Supreme Court had again legalized the martial law in the light of &quot;doctrine of necessity&quot; and denied taking petitions to review its decision. During this time, Supreme Court justices were described as notoriously conservative and only a few moderates, appointed by Prime Minister Zulfikar Ali Bhutto as his role as President in 1971–73. The Supreme Court, however, did take the petitions to review the case of Zulfikar Ali Bhutto, after his counsels filed an appeal against the verdict of Lahore High Court. The Constitution Bench formed under Chief Justice Sh. Anwarul Haq, had contained Justice Muhammad Akram, Justice Dorab Patel, Justice Mohammad Haleem, Justice Nasim Hasan Shah, Justice Ghulam safdar Shah, Justice Kareem Illahi, Justice Waheedudin Ahmad, and Justice Kaisar Khan. By 1979, the Supreme Court greatly divided with Justice Dorab Patel, Justice G.S. Shah, and Justice Moh&#x27;d Haleem, who had the moderate and liberal leanings in their jurisprudence strongly disagreed with Bhutto&#x27;s sentence of Capital punishment. On the other hand, Chief Justice Haq, Justice N.H. Shah, Justice Waheedudin Ahmad, and Justice Kaisar Khan, were described as having conservative/texualist ideology in their rulings and found Bhutto suitable for capital punishment; hence, marking a split decision by 4:3.

In 1993, Prime Minister Benazir Bhutto controversially elevated the Supreme Court jurist, SA Shah, who had known for his liberal jurisprudence, as Chief Justice over two senior ranking jurists at the Supreme Court. However, Justice Shah&#x27;s judicial leanings did not protected the Benazir&#x27; administration when it was dismissed by President Farooq Leghari over allegations on corruption. In 1997, judicial crises reached its peak when Supreme Judicial Council took up the case against Justice Shah&#x27;s appointment who eventually resigned from his office and succeeded by conservative jurist Ajmal Mian, only to be replaced with conservative jurist Saeeduzzaman Siddiqui as the new Chief Justice.

On 12 October 1999, the Supreme Court partially validated the martial law in the light of &quot;doctrine of necessity&quot; on the technicality but Chief Justice Saeeduzzaman Siddiqui decided to hear the petitions over the legality of the martial law. Although, the Supreme Court had only validated the martial law for three-years only, the Supreme Court&#x27;s jurists and Justice Saeeduzzaman Siddiqui in clear view of this coup as a &quot;violation of constitution&quot; as Sharif&#x27;s lawyers made a ground base for finding Musharraf of treason.

General Musharraf, acting as Chief Executive, forcefully retired the conservative leaning jurists and elevated the judges who had known to have libertarian views in their jurisprudence at the Supreme Court, including Justice Irshad Hasan as Chief Justice. In 2002, The Supreme Court supervised the general elections successfully oversaw the transition of power from the office of Chief Executive to Prime minister. The legalization of Contempt of court act further strengthened the judicial independence of the Supreme Court in 2004 when Shaukat Aziz became prime minister.

In a lecture in November 2022, Justice Ayesha A. Malik observed an increasing tendency to bring political and social issues to court that would be more suited for resolution within parliament or by the executive. Noting that this is the point at which balancing of power, judicial restraint (refraining from undue interference in other branches of government) and legal clarity become relevant, Malik expressed the view that courts should not act solely on compassion but instead prioritize upholding the rule of law.

==Court composition==
The justices and jurists of the supreme court are set to retire at the age of 65, unless the jurists sooner resign or are removed from office, or records written reasons for deviating from this rule in accordance with the Constitution. By an act of parliament of 1997, the number of judges was fixed at 17. However, in 2024, strength of Supreme Court was increased to 25 judges. Currently, there are sixteen judges and nine positions are vacant. There are two ad hoc appointment of the jurists from the Federal Shariat Court to assist with religiosity concerned cases.

===Chief Justice of Pakistan and justices===
As of current formation, Yahya Afridi is tenuring as the Chief Justice of Pakistan, having been appointed on 26 October 2024. The Supreme Court is currently composed of the following justices (in order of seniority), that included the sixteen regular judges including the Chief Justice and two ad hoc judges who were reappointed again after their retirement.

The ad hoc appointments are due to fill the Shariat Appellate Bench that is composed on legal scholars that has expertised on Islamic jurisprudence since its establishment in 1980. The ad hoc appointments for this bench are drawn either from the Federal Shariat Court or from among the Clergy. Decisions made the Federal Shariat Court may be appealed to the Appellate Bench, as the Appellate Bench of Supreme Court is the final authority on Islamic interpretation of law in Pakistan.





===Registry and officers===

The registry of the Supreme Court is its appointed officers who is assisted by registrars, several additional and deputy registrars, gazetted officers, and other law clerks. The registry branches provides speedy justice of all nature of crimes and disputes to the people living in remote areas in the country, while keeping the civil registry of the people.

There are five registry of the supreme court: Islamabad, Karachi, Lahore, Peshawar, and Quetta.

The Officers and Registrars are appointed by the supreme court with the approval from the chief justices of High Courts and the President and may make rules providing for the appointment by for their terms and conditions of employment that is granted by the Constitution.

===Law clerks and supreme court advocates===

The Supreme Court has an extensive competitive program for the appointment of the law clerks and research associates at the Supreme Court Library. The Supreme Court hires the law clerks based on the recommendations provided by their professors from their respected universities and colleges. Law clerks reviews the petitions for writ of certiorari, research them, prepare bench memorandums, and draft opinions, and reported back to the supreme court&#x27;s administrative registrar. As of current, the supreme court has 10 law clerks for the 2016–17 year.

The Pakistan Bar Council provides qualification for senior advocates, barristers, lawyers, and selected civil court judges to be elevated as Advocate Supreme Court (ASC) based on individual experience, qualifications, and selected invitations.

==Court campus and facilities==
The Supreme Court Building is located at the Constitution Avenue in Islamabad, flanked by the Prime Minister&#x27;s Office to the south, the Presidential Palace and the Parliament Building to the north.

Initially, the Supreme Court met in Karachi and later moved to Lahore/Rawalpindi on various location until 1960 after the government moved to Islamabad. The Supreme Court building is within the ambit of the Islamabad Police, maintaining the law and order as well as campus security of the court.

The Supreme Court Building is designed by the renowned Japanese architect, Kenzo Tange, in a modernist style complementing the Parliament Building. The CDA Engineering and the Environmental Protection Agency supervised the engineering the Supreme Court&#x27;s monument and civil works infrastructure throughout its lengthy construction since the 1960s. In the 1980s–90s, CDA Engineering later expanded infrastructure of the Supreme Court especially when building the Supreme Court&#x27;s law library.|

The Court Complex is comprised on Main Central Block, Judges Chamber&#x27;s block, and Administrative Block, covering 339,861sq. ft2. Administration of the Court is supervised by the Chief Justice who exercise the powers through the Registrars, Law clerks, Librarians, and private secretaries to run the judicial functions in proper manner.

The Court complex judges&#x27; chambers, a separate building consisting of the law library, various meeting spaces, and auxiliary services including a lecture auditorium. There is an Elizabethan-styled Entrance Hall, cafeteria, conference rooms, and a vintage Dining hall, that resembles the Victorian era. The Supreme Court Library contains the collection of 72,000 law books, reports and journals is situated in the basement.

=== Supreme Court Museum ===
The Supreme Court Museum serves as an invaluable repository for preserving the Judicial History of Post and pre-Independence era for future generation. The Museum&#x27;s collections include fine arts, oral histories, photographs, personal belongings of judges and chief justices and an archival collection of rare documents. These collections are displayed in the permanent exhibit gallery of the Museum, as well as in temporary exhibits; surely in future these archival materials will be assets to the researchers. The idea of Supreme Court Museum was dreamt in year 2010 by Chief Justice Tassaduq Hussain Jillani and completed in the June 2016.

==Jurisdiction==
The Supreme Court has all the original, appellate, and advisory jurisdiction on all of the country&#x27;s courts – hence, the Supreme Court is the final arbitrator of all cases where the decision has been reached. In 1976, the jurisdiction of the Supreme Court was constrained and limited by the passing of the Fifth Amendment to the Constitution but its powers were originally restored in 1985 through the Eighth Amendment, which further expanded the jurisdiction of the Supreme Court.

The Supreme Court enjoys a powerful jurisdiction in the country including on the federal government, provincial governments, governmental agencies, NGOs, and where the government and governmental agencies fails to perform its mandated duty to protect the basic human rights or deviating from the law in light of taking the &quot;Suo motu&quot; notice.

From 2008 to 2013, the Supreme Court repeatedly exercise its &quot;suo motu&quot; power in a view of check and balance on the governmental authorities to prevent abuse of human rights and to prevent the miscarriage of justice.

The independent jurisdiction of the Supreme Court is taken as positive by the legal observers as an attempt of providing a fair, speedy, and public trial of authorities accused of abusing the basic human rights. Commenting of the issue of suo motu, Justice K.M. Sharif critically opined: &quot;[Supreme Court]&#x27;s jurisdiction will take notice of every matter in which the executive is showing slackness.&quot; The Supreme Court is the only federal court that has jurisdiction over the direct appeals from high courts decisions, as powers granted by the Constitution as an appellate jurisdiction.

The Supreme Court also has an original jurisdiction in any dispute between any two or more provincial governments or the Government of Pakistan itself where the Supreme Court may pronounce declaratory judgments only to settle the disputes. However, almost all cases are brought to the Supreme Court on appeal, making the cases considered based on original jurisdiction rarely. On events involving the legal and technical issues concerning the implementation of law and the writ of constitution, Supreme Court has an advisory jurisdiction to answer questions and provides written opinions on public importance as consulted by the President upon the request from the Prime Minister.

The Supreme Court also enjoys the plenary jurisdiction and may exercise its plenary powers for passing appropriate orders to ensure the completion of its orders and to complete the justice at all levels of commands.

==Rules and process==

===Rulings and transfer of cases===
The Supreme Court is empowered to frame its own rules for the purpose of regulating the practice and procedure of the Court. When the cases are determined as their final rulings, the jurists deliver their rulings in an open court, either at once or by announcing a future date to the concerned parties through their advocates upon writing their opinions during their recesses.

All cases that come before the supreme court through the writs of certiorari that are processed through the law clerks and advocates. The Supreme Court has powers to transfer any case, appeals, or other pendings proceedings before any High Courts to any subordinated court if the supreme court considers it expedient to do so in the interest of justice and speedy trial. The Supreme Court may issues advisory directions, orders, and decrees in any case or matter pending in the high courts necessary for doing the complete justice, including an order for the purpose of securing the attendance of any person or the discovery or production of any document. The directions and orders issued by the Supreme Court are finals despite questions are arises during the hearings in the High Court for the directions provided the Supreme court.

===Oral arguments and decisions===
When the certiorari petitions are granted by the Supreme Court, the case is then set for the oral arguments, issuing orders to advocates of concerning parties in the case of importance. If the parties, despite the opportunity granted by the
court to make oral submissions, do not avail the same, the court is not bound to wait indefinitely for them and keep on adjourning the matter. During the time of the orality by either sides of the parties, the justices may interrupt the advocate and ask questions. The petitioner gives the first presentation, and may reserve some time to rebut the respondent&#x27;s arguments after the respondent has concluded.

At the conclusion of oral argument, the case is submitted for the final judgements where cases are decided by majority vote of the justices. It is possible that, through recusals or vacancies, the Court divides evenly on a case, as such happened on the case &quot;Nusrat Bhutto v. Federation of Pakistan (1977–78)&quot;.

===Review Petition and actions===

Despite its final rulings, the Supreme Court may review any case upon the filing of review petition of any party to any civil and criminal case of any decisions, judgements/rulings have been pronounced by the Supreme Court. The party that filed an appealed through the supreme court advocates to the Supreme Court is the &quot;Appellant&quot; and the non-mover is the &quot;respondent&quot;, where all case names before the Supreme Court are styled &quot;petitioner/appellant vs. defendants/respondent&quot;.

All decisions that are pronounced by the supreme court, after hearing the review petitions, are considered as final rulings that are to be binding on all other courts in Pakistan. The constitution also empowers the Supreme Court to call upon any authority, either an executive or judicial, to act in aid of the Supreme Court to ensure its rulings are delivered to complete justice.

===Published opinions and citations===
The Supreme Court of Pakistan Press is the official authority that publishes the reportable Supreme Court&#x27;s decisions and opinions, as well as judicial supplements, law reports, and bibliographies. The Supreme Court&#x27;s opinions are first published and is made available on the Court&#x27;s web site, in form of &quot;press release.&quot; Secondly, comprehensive opinions and orders are bound together in paperback form in which the final version of the Court&#x27;s opinions appears which is called a preliminary print of &quot;Annual Report&quot;.

About a year after the paperbacks are published, a final and more cited volume of decision of supreme court volume of Annual Report is published and numbered whereas the researchers may cite the works in their reports.

===Supreme Court Bar Association===
Supreme_court_Bar.png
All supreme court advocates are required to be members of the Supreme Court Bar Association in order to plead the cases before the court. Formed and established in 1989, the Bar comprises the supreme court lawyers who are elected from all over the country and is aimed to uphold the rule of law, cause of justice and protect the interest of the legal profession as well as that of public.

The Bar is governed by an executive council consisting of 22 elected members with an elected president and a secretary. Advocates can be admitted as either individuals or groups and their admission is approved by the elected president of the Bar. Members of the Supreme Court Bar Association are also granted access to the Supreme Court Library&#x27;s research collection and law periodicals.

==Institutional &quot;de jure&quot; powers==

The Supreme Court has played an influential and pivotal role in the political history of the country since its inception in 1947, and has taken constitutional role for protecting the rights in the light of &quot;doctrine of necessity&quot;. The &quot;de jure&quot; institutional powers of the Supreme Court as outlined in the Constitution can only be understood as an exemplary of constitutional cases involving the actions of the Pakistan&#x27;s military turning over the civilian government in an attempt to restore law and order to prevent chaos in the society.

In 1954, the Court under Chief Justice Moh&#x27;d Munir exercised its institutional power in a supreme court case (&quot;Maulvi Tamizuddin Khan vs. Federation of Pakistan&quot;) when it validated the dismissal of Constituent Assembly, whereas M.A. Bogra continued to serve as Prime Minister under Governor-General Sir Malik Ghulam. There were three constitutional cases overheard by the Supreme Court:

#&quot;Federation of Pakistan et al. v. Maulvi Tamizuddin Khan&quot;
#&quot;Usif Patel v. Two others v. The Crown&quot;
#&quot;Special Reference made by the Governor-General of Pakistan&quot;

First, the Supreme Court validated the Governor-General&#x27;s actions in case 1 but soon considered such powers as &quot;Ultra vires&quot; in case 2 and case 3. However, the Court found it legal in its jurisdiction in thrice cases when it validated the actions under the impression of &quot;doctrine of necessity&quot;. Despite its rulings, the Court maintained its institutional authority over the Governor-General&#x27;s actions and ultimately supervised the election of the Constituent Assembly which was transformed into National Assembly of Parliament that promulgated the first set of Constitution of Pakistan.

In 1969, Supreme Court justices again heard the petitions against the suspension of the second set of the Constitution when army chief General Yahya Khan took over the presidency amid the resignation of President Ayub Khan. This constitutional case cited as, &quot;Asma Jillani v. Government of the Punjab&quot;, evenly divided the justices on this issue but bitterly approved such actions in the light of &quot;necessity doctrine&quot;, with Chief Justice Hamoodur Rahman critically opined against this actions as he notably ruled that Yahya Khan&#x27;s assumption of power was &quot;illegal usurpation&quot;. In doing so, the Supreme Court also overruled and overturned its convictions that called for validation of martial law in 1958.

The institutional influence of Supreme Court on the political events in the country grew since 1971 after the conclusion of the War Enquiry Commission that provided far reaching insightful recommendations to prevent foreign intervention. In 1975, the institutional powers of the Supreme Court were constraint after the passing of the fifth amendment that ultimately disturbed the &quot;checks and balances&quot; system in the country, that eventually strain the executive and judiciary relations. In 1977, the Supreme Court courted by Chief Justice S. Anwarul Haq used the institutional powers to provide a legality to justify the actions resulted in martial law to dismiss the Prime Minister Zulfikar Ali Bhutto but decided to hear a petition to review the death sentence awarded by the Lahore High Court after the murder trial reached its conclusion. In a controversial leanings of 4:3, the Supreme Court upheld the death sentence and Zulfikar Ali Bhutto but it maintained its institutional integrity while taking many cases involving the Zia administration. The institutional &quot;de jure&quot; powers of the Supreme Court were restored to its original position after the passing of the Eighth Amendment in 1985.

After the military takeover of the civilian government, the pro-democracy organizations and PML(N)&#x27;s lawyers challenged the legality of the military takeover, asking the supreme court to review its rulings. After the lengthy court battle between Sharif&#x27;s and Musharraf&#x27;s lawyers, the Supreme Court was in a clear view of the military take over as &quot;unconstitutional&quot; but favoured the legality on necessity grounds that was viewed as very limited, on 12 May 2000.

Widely publicised case, the &quot;Nawaz Sharif vs. Federation&quot;, the supreme court relied its judgement based on the principle of &quot;salus populi est suprema lex&quot; and rejected the options of &quot;complete surrender&quot; to the regime or total opposition which, in its judgement, would have led to the &quot;closure of the courts&quot;. Due to the Thirteenth Amendment removed the effective check and balance of branches of the government, the supreme court marked its reference using the &quot;Necessitas facit licitum quod alias non-est licitum&quot; and asserted on the right of the Superior Courts to review the orders, proceedings, acts, and legislative measures of the Musharraf regime. In addition, the situation was termed by the supreme court as a &quot;case of constitutional deviation for a transitional period&quot;, and accepted Musharraf&#x27;s argument for holding the national elections within two-to-three years, giving Musharraf until 12 May 2002 to hold new elections. While issuing a lengthy judgement, the supreme court effectively established its institutional authority on Musharraf as it reserved for its right to review and re-examine the continuation of Musharraf&#x27;s emergency powers.

Before this judgement, Musharraf did not hint a timetable for the restoration of democracy – having argued that it needed an indefinite and possibly prolonged time to reform the country – Musharraf publicly submitted to the Court&#x27;s judgement. Several of Pakistani legal theorists have posited that Pakistan&#x27;s &quot;grundnorm&quot;, the basis for its Constitutional convention and system of laws, continues in effect (and the Supreme Court therefore retains its authority) even when the written constitution is suspended by the imposition of a military dictablanda.

===Contempt of court===

The Constitution empowers the Supreme Court to exercise its powers of contempt of court to punish any person or an authority found of scandalizing, abusing, interfering, and obstructing the procedures of the court or its rulings. In 2001–2002, there were additional amendments made that further empowers the Supreme Court and its institutional powers to struck any federal authority found on the charges of contempt of court.

In a much publicized case, the Supreme Court effectively used its constitutional powers when it ceased Prime Minister Yousaf Raza Gillani from running the government when the court found him guilty of contempt of court charges– hench disqualified the prime minister from holding any public offices in the country.

==Literary criticism of the Supreme Court==

The Supreme Court has been given literary criticism by historians and authors of history of Pakistan for validating the martial law against the elected governments of Pakistan by the military interventions.

===Lawyer&#x27;s movement, long march, and judicial activism===
In 2007, it was reported widely by the Pakistani news media that the Military Intelligence officials, acting under then-President and army chief General Pervez Musharraf, were using photographs of the justices involved with prostitutes to blackmail and pressurize the supreme court justices to take the oath of allegiance and make rulings favorable to the then-President Musharraf.

The Lawyer&#x27;s movement, allied with the rule of Law movement led by PML(N), eventually called for a successful long march to have to justices of the supreme court restored before the state of emergency imposed in 2007. Led under the direction of PML(N)&#x27;s President Nawaz Sharif, now the Prime Minister, the long march effectively restored the supreme court justices when Prime Minister Yousuf Raza Gilani appeared on national television, only to announce unconditional restoration of the judiciary.

With immediate effect on 17 March 2009, Justices Javaid Iqbal, Ijaz Ahmed, K. R. Ramday, and Fayaz Ahmad were restored to their position as of 2 November 2007 with Justice Iftikhar Mohammad Chaudhry assuming the post of Chief Justice on 22 March 2009. The news media pundits eventually noted that it was General Tariq Majid, then-Chairman joint chiefs, and General Ashfaq Pervez Kiani, then-army chief, had played an ambiguous role in intervening and encouraging a rapprochement between the government and the opposition. Neither side acknowledged this role, however, until lawyers&#x27; movement leader Aitezaz Ahsan publicly admitted Kayani&#x27;s role. There were mass speculations that protestors and law enforcement agencies would have violently collided otherwise had they not intervened.

The restoration of the justices that resulted from the immense public pressure led to the judiciary to begin a quest for independence with an aim to ensure a strong and efficient judicial system that could quickly deliver justice to the public. The Supreme Court took notice of several important constitutional and other cases in the period that related to the public interest. These cases of importance included the constitutional petitions and judgements on:
**&quot;Constitution Petition No. 8 &amp; 9 of 2009&quot;
**&quot;Dr. Mubashir Hussain vs. Federation of Pakistan&quot;
**&quot;Missing Person vs. the Federation of Pakistan et al.&quot;
**&quot;Petitioners vs. Federation of Pakistan et al.&quot;
** &quot;Steel Workers Union vs. Federation of Pakistan et al.&quot;
**&quot;Applicants vs. NICL et al.&quot;

The Supreme Court rendered its judgement declare the appointments based upon PCO on 3 November 2007 as null and void as well as declaring the NRO as also null and voided that ultimately opened the investigations and cases against then-President Asif Ali Zardari and Prime Minister Gillani.
The Supreme Court became extremely vigilant on corruption cases related to the Gillani administration, effectively led to the government shutdown and critics noted that the judicial activism slowed of government productivity without corruption has created a tension between the Chaudhry Court and the Gillani administration in 2008 till 2013.

===Constitutional petitions No. 8 and 9 of 2009===
Of the 14 justices that rendered a verdict related to taking an oath under the PCO, 12 had taken the oath themselves. However, they controversially did not apply the judgement to themselves.

As a result of the 31 July 2009 decision handed down in the case of Constitutional Petitions 8 and 9 of 2009, the following justices resigned before their cases were referred to Supreme Judicial Council:

In addition to the above justices, the following justices were removed from the Supreme Court of Pakistan on the ground that their appointment to the court was made without consultation with the &quot;de jure&quot; Chief Justice of Pakistan.

====Controversial aspect of the decision====
The decision of the Court summarily removed all justices of the higher judiciary who were not part of it as of 2 November 2007. Their removal was ordered on the grounds that the &quot;de jure&quot; Chief Justice was not allowed to advise in these cases. In the same decision the court held that the &quot;de jure&quot; Chief Justice from 3 November 2007 to 22 March 2009 was Justice Chaudhry.

There were three groups of removed justices:
* Those elevated to higher courts who initially took oath under the PCO
* Those who were elevated to higher courts after restoration of the Constitution and were appointed by Musharraf
* Those who were elevated to higher courts after restoration of the Constitution and were appointed by Asif Ali Zardari

The Supreme Court bench that rendered the decision consisted entirely of justices who had taken oath under the PCO of 1999 themselves, but were already sitting justices of the higher judiciary at the time and had taken a constitutional oath. The 1999 PCO and decisions made under it were given constitutional protection by Seventeenth amendment.

This decision has resulted in situations where:
# newly appointed justices who never took any sort of oath under any PCO have been removed
# sitting justices who took an oath under the 2007 PCO are still acting as justices, though their cases will be sent to Supreme Judicial Council
# sitting justices who were reappointed and took oath under Justice Dogar are still acting as justices with no action
# justices who took oath under the PCO of 1999 are still functioning as justices of higher judiciary

Critics of the decision question the fact that some PCO judges are still working and some non-PCO judges have been sacked.

====Review petition filed by Lahore High Court non-PCO removed judges====
Removed ad hoc judges of the Lahore High Court have filed several petitions in the Supreme Court in Lahore for review of its judgment, which sent 76 judges of Supreme Courts and High Courts immediately home.

These judges argue that they were qualified to be appointed as judges of the High Court in accordance with the requirements of Article 193(2)of the 1973 Constitution and were offered to serve as ad hoc judges following the consultation required under the Constitution. They accepted the offer and took oath when the state of emergency was lifted. They never took oath under a PCO and continued performing the functions of judges of the High Court until judgement was rendered against them.

These judges were appointed by Lahore High Court Chief Justice Justice Zahid Hussain, who is still a justice of the Supreme Court of Pakistan and is not being tried before the Supreme Judicial Counsel.

The petition also noted that none of the sacked judges were made parties to the decision against them, nor were they able to comment in the hearing or in some cases aware that the hearing was taking place. They also allege that no copy of the decision was sent to the High Court or to the judges concerned.

====Key controversial points====
According one news article,
the Supreme Court applied its judgement retroactively, having effect from 3 November 2007. The 14-member Supreme Court bench did not, however, apply the sanction to judges who took oath under the 1999 PCO. Some of these are current justices, and some have not yet taken a constitutional oath.

Critics of the decision also argue that it is inconsistent with the principles laid down in Malik Asad Ali&#x27;s case where it was held that the Chief Justice was bound by the Court&#x27;s judgement. Chief Justice Sajjad Ali Shah was removed from office based on this case.

Inconsistently with the decision, the present Chief Justice Chaudhry accepted the stance of the government that Justice Dogar was the Chief Justice until his retirement.

Following the decision, the official website of the Supreme Court was hacked by an unknown person. The hacked website made derogatory remarks about Chief Justice Chaudhry.

<text>Prittlewell is an inner city area and former civil parish in Southend-on-Sea, in the ceremonial county of Essex, England. Historically, Prittlewell is the original settlement of the city, Southend being the &quot;south end&quot; of Prittlewell. The village of Prittlewell was originally centered at the joining of three main roads, East Street, West Street, and North Street, which was extended south in the 19th century and renamed Victoria Avenue. The principal administrative buildings in Southend are located along Victoria Avenue, although Prittlewell is served by Prittlewell railway station.

==History==

===Prehistoric===
People first settled by the Prittle Brook at least 10,000 years ago in the late Stone Age. Little appears to have affected life in Prittlewell as its population gradually evolved from their original character as hunter-gatherers to a more settled existence during the Bronze and Iron Ages.

===Roman===
The Roman occupation began to influence the area with the construction of a Roman-style dwelling, probably a farmhouse or villa, close to the brook in what is now Priory Park. The introduction of new ideas, new skills and social structures under this Roman influence would have brought significant change to the area. The discovery of Roman burial sites during road and rail construction in the 1920s and 1930s indicated that the settlement was well developed and of some significance, although no prominent buildings were preserved.

===Saxons and Vikings===

Following the decline of Roman Britain, the area came under the influence of Saxon raiders, over time becoming established as part of the kingdom of the East Saxons. During this time (largely the 5th and 6th centuries), the historic Saxon name of &quot;Prittleuuella&quot; came into being. Part of a blocked archway built of Roman tiles survives in the north wall of the chancel of St Mary&#x27;s church, and it has long been assumed that it represents part of a small Anglo-Saxon chapel built in the 7th century, possibly as early as the reign of King Sæberht of Essex. However, more recent study and comparison with surviving architectural remains elsewhere suggest instead that the arch may date as late as the 10th or early 11th century, and that this is the date of the first church to be built on the site.

====Royal Saxon tomb====

The construction works of 1923 and 1930 that revealed Roman burials also unearthed evidence of numerous Anglo-Saxon burials, a significant number of which were high-status or warrior burials containing weapons, imported goods, jewellery and decorative beads, some of which were made out of glass. The high status of the area during the Anglo-Saxon period was confirmed by the discovery of a substantial and undisturbed 7th-century chamber tomb in 2003. The burial site was uncovered by archaeologists from Museum of London Archaeology, who had been commissioned to prepare the site in advance of a road widening scheme. In 2009, following local opposition, the scheme was dropped and the traffic congestion eased by works to a different road location.

The unusually rich contents and their condition have excited archaeologists, being described as &quot;unique&quot; by the Museum of London. A fuller description of the excavation and the artefacts of the burial chamber, originally thought to be of Sæberht of Essex, can be seen at the dedicated Museum of London website. The story of the excavation was also thought so significant as to be the subject of a special documentary titled &quot;King of Bling&quot;, as part of the &quot;Time Team&quot; series.

===Medieval===
At the time of the Domesday Book in 1086, the two manors in the area that is now Prittlewell were Prittlewell and Milton, the former owned by Swein of Essex and the latter by the Priory of Holy Trinity, Canterbury (now Canterbury Cathedral). In the 12th century, Robert de Essex, also known as Robert FitzSwein, founded Prittlewell Priory as a cell of the Cluniac Priory of St Pancras, Lewes. The foundation charter included the manor and church of Prittlewell. At this time, the lands of the priory extended to the seafront. Due to this, when a fishing settlement was set up two miles (3 km) south of the priory in the 14th century, it was still regarded as part of Prittlewell and as such was named &quot;Stratende&quot;, &quot;Sowthende&quot; or &quot;South-End&quot;. From this settlement, the modern town of Southend-on-Sea grew. Over a period of around two hundred years, the Parish Church, St. Mary&#x27;s, was substantially enlarged, reaching its present size with the addition of its tower in the mid-15th century. At the time of the Tudor Dissolution of the Monasteries by Henry VIII, the priory, which had by this time developed into a sprawling complex, was closed and the lands seized by the crown.

===19th century===

Southend was developed as a bathing resort in the 18th century, and by the 19th, Prittlewell was regarded by visitors to Southend as &quot;an attractive village in the hinterland&quot;. In 1848, Prittlewell was described in the White&#x27;s Directory of Essex as &quot;a neat and well built village with many modern houses overlooking the estuary of the Thames, 1½ miles North West of Southend, and 3 miles South of Rochford&quot;. Links between Prittlewell and Southend were improved in 1889 when a road, named Victoria Avenue, was built between the village crossroads by the church to Southend and in 1892 when Prittlewell railway station was built on the Great Eastern Railway, linking Southend and London. 1892 also saw the foundation of the Municipal Borough of Southend-on-Sea, which took over responsibility for Prittlewell from an earlier local board.

===20th century===
The old priory, which had been in ownership of the Scratton family, was bought by local jeweller and benefactor R. A. Jones and was given to the people of Southend as Priory Park. In 1901, Eric Kingham Cole was born in Prittlewell and went on to form EKCO, a radio, TV and plastic manufacturer, in 1924. In 1930, he built a large factory opposite Priory Park, but by 1966 the electrical side of the factory was closed (except for the car radio repair department, which closed in 1977). The Access (credit card) business moved into the factory in 1972, but with the business changing in the 1990s, Royal Bank of Scotland moved out, leaving the EKCO (now Linpac) plastic factory the only operative on the site. This closed down in 2007, and the whole site was demolished in 2012, with a combined housing and commercial development (and a new Havens Hospice) being given planning permission on 14 January 2015.

In 1911 the parish had a population of 58,759. On 9 November 1913 the parish was abolished to form &quot;Southend on Sea&quot;.

==Geography==
Modern-day Prittlewell stretches from the crossroads by St Mary&#x27;s Church to London Southend Airport on the boundary between Southend and Rochford.

== Demography ==
At the 2001 UK census, the Prittlewell electoral ward had a population of 9,478. The ethnicity was 95.1% white, 1% mixed race, 2.8% Asian, 0.5% black and 0.6% other. The place of birth of residents was 93.9% United Kingdom, 0.8% Republic of Ireland, 1.2% other Western European countries, and 4.1% elsewhere. Religion was recorded as 71.2% Christian, 0.3% Buddhist, 1.2% Hindu, 0% Sikh, 1.1% Jewish, and 1.7% Muslim. 16.2% were recorded as having no religion, 0.3% had an alternative religion and 8.0% did not state their religion.

The economic activity of residents aged 16–74 was 39.5% in full-time employment, 12.6% in part-time employment, 9.6% self-employed, 3.3% unemployed, 2.3% students with jobs, 2.9% students without jobs, 16.5% retired, 6.3% looking after home or family, 4.5% permanently sick or disabled and 2.6% economically inactive for other reasons.

Of the ward&#x27;s residents aged 16–74, 14.4% had a higher education qualification or the equivalent, compared with 19.9% nationwide. According to Office for National Statistics estimates, during the period of April 2004 to March 2005 the average gross weekly income of households was £590, compared with an average of £650 in South East England.

==Landmarks==
Only a small proportion of the historical village of Prittlewell remains standing; the ruins and standing remains of the Priory, visible in Priory Park; St. Mary&#x27;s Church; A building recently restored following fire damage, though more recently a bakery, now an estate agent appropriately named Tudor Estates; as well as a number of public houses, the most famous of which is the Blue Boar. This is famous as being where Southend United F.C. were formed, however the building that currently stands there is of Victorian construction, as the original building was destroyed by fire. Since 1955, Prittlewell has been the home to Southend United F.C. at their ground Roots Hall, and has been since the 1960s home to a weekly market which takes place on a Thursday. Southend are planning to move from this location, and Sainsbury&#x27;s currently have planning permission to build a supermarket on the site of Roots Hall, St Mary&#x27;s flats, the former Eastern National Bus Garage/former Prospects College and the shops on the corner of Victoria Avenue and Fairfax Drive.

==Transport==
The area is served by Prittlewell railway station on the Shenfield–Southend line.
==Sports==
Prittlewell is home to football teams Ekco Whitecaps and Prittlewell Badgers.

<doc id="843865" wikidata="Q469660" url="?curid=843865" title="Tubercle">
<text>In anatomy, a tubercle (literally &#x27;small tuber&#x27;, Latin for &#x27;lump&#x27;) is any round nodule, small , or warty outgrowth found on external or internal organs of a plant or an animal.

==In plants==
A tubercle is generally a wart-like projection, but it has slightly different meaning depending on which family of plants or animals it is used to refer to.

In the case of certain orchids and cacti, it denotes a round nodule, small , or warty outgrowth found on the lip. They are also known as podaria (singular &quot;podarium&quot;). When referring to some members of the pea family, it is used to refer to the wart-like excrescences that are found on the roots.

==In fungi==
In mycology, a tubercle is used to refer to a mass of hyphae from which a mushroom is made.

==In animals==
When it is used in relation to certain dorid nudibranchs such as &quot;Peltodoris nobilis&quot;, it means the nodules on the dorsum of the animal. The tubercles in nudibranchs can present themselves in different ways: each tubercle in a single, rounded, conical or angular form; in a compound form of two or more levels; tubercles in amalgamated clusters; or as tubercles forming, or joined by a ridge.

Tubercles found on the leading edge of humpback whales&#x27; flippers were demonstrated to improve fluid flow over the flipper&#x27;s surface, exhibiting the tubercle effect of fluid dynamics.

In dinosaurs, a tubercle is a general term for the scales seen in skin impressions. In duck-billed dinosaurs, for example, three main types of tubercles are defined: small tubercles with no definite arrangement (ground tubercles); larger, polygonal tubercles (pavement tubercles) up to in diameter, which are grouped into clusters separated by ground tubercles; and limpet-shaped conical scutes.

In fish, nuptial tubercles are formed on males for breeding. Nuptial pads on frogs also comprise keratinised tubercles.

==In humans==
Within the human body, there are numerous sites where tubercles develop. On bones, they are usually eminences used for muscle connections. Larger tubercles are also known as &quot;tuberosities&quot;.

===Mouth===
Tubercles are usually found behind the last molar in the upper jaw, covered by the gum. Surgery can be done to make tubercles less prominent.

===Bones===

In the human skeleton, a &quot;tubercle&quot; or &quot;tuberosity&quot; is a protrusion that serves as an attachment for skeletal muscles. The muscles attach by tendons, where the enthesis is the connective tissue between the tendon and bone. For example, the tibial tuberosity creates an attachment point for the ligamentum patellae, or patellar ligament.

===Lungs===

Tubercles are nodules that contain caseous necrosis, which form in the lungs as a result of an infection with &quot;Mycobacterium tuberculosis&quot; in the patients with tuberculosis. Granulomas form in the infected tissue and undergo necrosis in the centre. Tubercles are also known as tuberculous nodules, or tuberculomas. The affected parts develop lesions in the form of small nodules called tubercles, from which the disease gets its name.

===Ears===
Around the sixth week of gestation, six swellings of tissue, called the &quot;hillocks of His&quot;, arise around the area that will form the ear canal. These eventually coalesce to form the outer ear. Darwin&#x27;s tubercle is a minor malformation of the junction of the fourth and fifth hillocks of His. It is found in a substantial minority of people and takes the form of a cartilaginous node or bump on the rim of their outer ear, which is thought to be the vestige of a joint that allowed the top part of the ancestral ear to swivel or flop down over the opening to the ear.

===Genitals===
The genital tubercle is a small bump that eventually develops into a penis or a clitoris on a human fetus.

===Brain===
The septotubercular tract can be found in the human, as well as in the sheep brain. It is found nearby the septohypothalamic tract. Its function to the brain is ambiguous at this point.

Also, the tuberculum sellae is found at the base of the skull, which holds the hypophysis.

<doc id="843882" wikidata="Q5282275" url="?curid=843882" title="Disjunctive pronoun">
<text>A disjunctive pronoun is a stressed form of a personal pronoun reserved for use in isolation or in certain syntactic contexts.

==Examples and usage==
Disjunctive pronominal forms are typically found in the following contexts. The examples are taken from French, which uses the disjunctive first person singular pronoun &quot;moi&quot;. The (sometimes colloquial) English translations illustrate similar uses of &quot;me&quot; as a disjunctive form.
*in syntactically unintegrated disjunct (or &quot;dislocated&quot;) positions
:&quot;Les autres s&#x27;en vont, mais moi, je reste.&quot;
:: The others are leaving, but me, I&#x27;m staying.
*in elliptical constructions (often &quot;sentence fragments&quot;) with no verb (e.g. short answers)
:&quot;Qui veut du gâteau ? Moi.&quot;
:: Who wants cake? Me. (cf. &quot;I do&quot;)
:&quot;Il est plus âgé que moi.&quot;
:: He is older than me. (cf. &quot;I am&quot;)
*in the main clause of a cleft sentence
:&quot;C&#x27;est moi que vous cherchez.&quot;
:: It&#x27;s me that you&#x27;re looking for.

Disjunctive pronouns are often semantically restricted. For example, in a language with grammatical gender, there may be a tendency to use masculine and feminine disjunctive pronouns primarily for referring to animate entities.
:&quot;Si l&#x27;on propose une bonne candidate, je voterai pour elle.&quot;
:: If someone proposes a good candidate, I&#x27;ll vote for her.
:&quot;Si l&#x27;on propose une bonne loi, je voterai pour elle.&quot;
:: If someone proposes a good law, I&#x27;ll vote for her (it).

== &quot;It&#x27;s me&quot; ==

In some languages, a personal pronoun has a form called a disjunctive pronoun, which is used when it stands on its own, or with only a copula, such as in answering the question &quot;Who wrote this page?&quot; The natural answer for most English speakers in this context would be &quot;me&quot; (or &quot;It&#x27;s me&quot;), parallel to &quot;moi&quot; (or &quot;C&#x27;est moi&quot;) in French. Unlike in French, however, where such constructions are considered standard, English pronouns used in this way have caused dispute. Some grammarians contend that the correct answer should be &quot;I&quot; or &quot;It is I&quot; because &quot;is&quot; is a linking verb and &quot;I&quot; is a predicate nominative, and up until a few centuries ago spoken English used pronouns in the subjective case in such sentences. However, since English has lost noun inflection and now relies on word order, using the objective case &quot;me&quot; after the verb &quot;be&quot; like other verbs seems natural to modern speakers.

&quot;It is I&quot; developed from the Old and Middle English form &quot;It am I&quot;. &quot;It&quot; was used as the complement of &quot;am&quot;, but in modern English &quot;it&quot; is the subject.

<doc id="843884" wikidata="Q3294074" url="?curid=843884" title="Mark Farina">
<text>Mark Farina is an American disc jockey and musician, known for his Chicago house, acid jazz and downtempo works. His notable releases include &quot;Mood&quot; (KMS Records, 1989) and the &quot;Mushroom Jazz&quot; series (Om Records, 1996–2011). He is primarily identified with the house music scenes in his hometown of Chicago, and San Francisco, California.

==Biography==
Shortly after Farina became friends with Derrick Carter in 1988 at a record store in Chicago, he developed an interest in house music. Farina experimented with a deeper style, dropping De La Soul, disco classics and other styles not being played in the main rooms of nightclubs. While exploring purist forms of house music, Farina developed his trademark style, known as &quot;mushroom jazz&quot;: acid jazz infused with the West Coast&#x27;s jazzy, organic productions along with urban beats.

Fans embraced Farina&#x27;s downtempo style, and he started in 1992 a weekly Mushroom Jazz club night in San Francisco with Patty Ryan. In 3 years at the club, Farina and Mushroom Jazz established a following. When the club closed, Farina continued the tradition by releasing a series of CDs under the same name, &quot;Mushroom Jazz&quot;. His house sets have been described as the jazzy side of Chicago House mixed San Francisco style. &quot;URB&quot;, &quot;MUZIK&quot; and &quot;BPM&quot; magazines have all had him on their &#x27;Top DJs in the World&#x27; lists. In 2000, Farina was ranked at number 72 on the &quot;DJ Mag&quot; Top 100 DJs list.

<doc id="843889" wikidata="Q6392684" url="?curid=843889" title="Kenya Posts and Telecommunications Corporation">
<text>Kenya Posts and Telecommunications Corporation (KPTC) was a government company that provided telecommunication and postal services across Kenya. In 1999, the KPTC was separated into three separate entities - Telkom Kenya, Kenya Postal Corporation and the Communication Commission of Kenya,(CCK) the licensing and regulatory authority of the government.

==History==
From 1948 to 1977, postal service in Kenya, Tanzania and Uganda was provided by the East African Posts and Telecommunications Corporation. The dissolution of the first East African Community since that era forced Kenya to establish its own monopoly communications company, KPTC.

New government economic policies in the mid 1990s were developed and adopted, supported by the International Monetary Fund (IMF) and World Bank. Recommendations of that process included separation of the postal and telecommunication operations. An IMF loan arrangement also depended on privatisation of KPTC, but IMF suspended this in July 1997 over reported concerns of government corruption.

Controversy over IMF telecommunications privatisation policies continued. KPTC&#x27;s Board of Directors was terminated by the Kenyan government in February 1999 prior to an IMF visit to the country.

In 1999, the corporation was broken up into three entities:

# Telkom Kenya providing telecommunications services,
# Postal Corporation of Kenya to offer postal services,
# Communications Commission of Kenya (CCK), a separate national regulatory authority.

==Service provision and quality==
Telephone service quality in Kenya remained problematic at times. Official waiting lists of customers seeking telephone service increased almost fourfold to almost 79 000 between 1977 and 1983, but had been reduced to less than 50 000 by 1986. These waiting lists only applied to areas where telephone service is available.

In 2003, years after the division of KPTC, CCK Board Chairman Peter Kariuki noted the total number of people remaining to be connected to telephone service in Kenya stood at 7 million. Emerging private mobile telephone companies provide service capacity, but remained too expensive for many citizens.

<text>Lumidee Cedeño (born October 13, 1984), known mononymously as Lumidee, is an American singer-songwriter and rapper. She is best known for her 2003 single &quot;Never Leave You (Uh Oooh, Uh Oooh)&quot;, which peaked at number three on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100 and led her to sign with Universal Records. The song preceded the release of her debut studio album &quot;Almost Famous&quot; (2003), which saw mixed to negative critical reception and moderate commercial performance. Her second album, &quot;Unexpected&quot; (2007) saw a critical improvement despite a commercial decline, and was supported by the cover single &quot;She&#x27;s Like the Wind&quot; (featuring Tony Sunshine).

==Early life==
Cedeño was born in the East Harlem neighborhood of Upper Manhattan, New York City, of Puerto Rican descent. 
After her father died in 1995, she and her four siblings were raised by their grandparents. She began singing and rapping at the age of twelve. She was diagnosed with rheumatoid arthritis at the age of fourteen, after she was misdiagnosed with lupus.

==Career==
===2003–2006: &quot;Almost Famous&quot;===
After graduating high school, she collaborated with a local neighborhood producer named DJ Tedsmooth to record her debut single for an independent record label called Straight Face. She signed with Universal Records, where she released her debut album titled &quot;Almost Famous&quot; on June 24, 2003. Her debut single, &quot;Never Leave You (Uh Oooh, Uh Oooh)&quot;, peaked at number 3 in the United States and number 2 in the United Kingdom, but it was her only hit until the 2007 release of &quot;She&#x27;s Like the Wind&quot;. According to Nielsen SoundScan, &quot;Almost Famous&quot; sold 276,000 copies in the U.S.

For the next few years, Lumidee was not in the mainstream music industry in the U.S., instead veering more towards reggaeton and dancehall music. After her hit single &quot;Never Leave You (Uh Oooh, Uh Oooh)&quot; faded, Lumidee went overseas to continue her musical career in Belgium, Germany, France, and the Netherlands. She released multiple mixtapes during the years, which was a mixtape consisting of new material, freestyles, and tracks from Lumidee was also featured on several tracks in this area, having some success in Europe.

In 2006, Lumidee released a song for the FIFA World Cup album soundtrack entitled &quot;Dance!&quot;. It featured a sample of Whitney Houston&#x27;s song, &quot;I Wanna Dance with Somebody (Who Loves Me)&quot;. The song was a club hit around Europe, successfully entering the charts in the countries where it was officially released. In the summer of 2006, Lumidee was featured on Frankie Cutlass&#x27; 2006 remix of his classic club hit anthem, &quot;Puerto Rico&quot; (featuring Joell Ortiz, Voltio, and Yomo Toro).

===2007: &quot;Unexpected&quot;===
In 2007, Lumidee was named youth ambassador of the New York Arthritis Foundation&#x27;s Arthritis Walk. On April 17, she released her second album, &quot;Unexpected&quot;, under TVT Records. In an interview with &quot;Vibe&quot;, Lumidee spoke about signing with TVT stating, &quot;TVT Records is the perfect way for me to come back and again I&#x27;m coming out of left field, just like with &quot;Never Leave You (Uh Oh),&quot; Nobody ever thought of me coming back on a street credible label like TVT, alongside acts like Pitbull, Lil Jon and the Ying Yang Twins. Actually, nobody ever thought of me really even coming back, period.&quot; The U.S. single, &quot;She&#x27;s Like the Wind&quot;, peaked at 43, but it was not released in Europe. There, the label released the single &quot;Crazy&quot; (featuring Pitbull), which had moderate chart success in Germany, Austria, and the United Kingdom. Lumidee made an appearance on &quot;MTV Cribs&quot;, showing her New Jersey home, which aired on August 6, 2007.

===2009–present===
On May 13, 2009, Lumidee released a mixtape called &quot;I&#x27;m Up, Vol. 1&quot; from her label, Logy Music Entertainment. In late 2009, Lumidee worked on another mixtape entitled &quot;Luminadee&quot;, which was released exclusively on Coast2CoastMixtapes.com in early January 2010. Lumidee was working on an album which was set to be released sometime in 2010, but ultimately it did not materialize. In 2011, she appeared in a re-work of Remady&#x27;s dance hit &quot;No Superstar&quot;. In 2011, she collaborated with rapper Somaya Reece on the single &quot;Dale Mami&quot;. The video debuted on mun2&#x27;s &quot;The Urban Tip&quot; on January 11, 2012. Universal Australia, Toughstuff Germany, and Sony Scandinavia signed &quot;Ring My Bell&quot; by Michael Fall (featuring Lumidee, Rick Elback, and Aziza) for release in 2014. On June 24, 2014, in an interview with Kevin Apaza of Directlyrics.com, Lumidee mentioned starting her own label Logy Music Entertainment. After leaving her previous major label, she will release her EP &quot;La Luz&quot; through her label Logy Music Entertainment.

==Artistry==
Lumidee cites Lauryn Hill, Missy Elliott, MC Lyte, and Mary J. Blige as her major influences.

<doc id="843897" wikidata="Q3931415" url="?curid=843897" title="Red Bee (character)">
<text>Red Bee is the name of two fictional superheroes appearing in American comic books.

The first Red Bee debuted in &quot;Hit Comics&quot; #1, published in July 1940 by Quality Comics. The character was obtained by DC Comics in 1956 and has since fallen into public domain. 

The second, written as the grandniece or granddaughter of the original, first appeared in &quot;Uncle Sam and the Freedom Fighters&quot; #5. 

==Fictional character biography==
===Richard Raleigh===

The Red Bee&#x27;s secret identity is Rick Raleigh, assistant district attorney in Superior City, Oregon. His superhero &quot;modus operandi&quot; is to put on a red and yellow costume and, with his trained bees and &quot;stinger gun&quot;, fight Nazis and gangsters. His favorite bee is named Michael and lives inside his belt buckle for use in special circumstances. He has a series of adventures which lasts until issue #24 (Oct 1942).

According to &quot;Jess Nevins&#x27; Encyclopedia of Golden Age Superheroes&quot;, &quot;he fights enemies like the evil spiritualist Dr. Marah, the Swordsmen (who use electrified swords), and Yellow Peril hatchet men&quot;.

Red Bee proved to be unpopular and was largely forgotten before reappearing in DC Comics&#x27; &quot;All-Star Squadron&quot;. In the &#x27;Squadron&#x27;, it is learned he was killed by the Nazi supervillain Baron Blitzkrieg while saving the lives of Hourman and other allies. The group Freedom Fighters was formed out of the Squadron and the Red Bee was made an honorary member.

Red Bee appears as a ghost in the pages of &quot;Starman&quot;, attending a dinner party alongside many other deceased heroes.

Other post-Crisis appearances include a cameo in &quot;Animal Man&quot; in which the character resides in a canceled characters&#x27; &quot;limbo&quot;, and in &quot;Bizarro World&quot;, where he and his agent attempt to improve his marketability.

During the &quot;Dark Nights: Death Metal&quot; storyline, Batman revives Red Bee using a Black Lantern ring.

&quot;The New Golden Age&quot; revealed that Red Bee had a sidekick named Ladybug before she was erased from existence following Doctor Manhattan&#x27;s alterations to the universe and rescued by the Time Masters. However, she is eventually rescued by Stargirl and Hourman and transported to the present day.

===Jenna Raleigh===
Rick&#x27;s grandniece, Jenna, takes up the mantle of the Red Bee. She uses a mechanized battle suit and two robotic bees that can fire electricity. She assists the group in fighting S.H.A.D.E., an evil governmental organization. She soon learns that the leader of the Freedom Fighters Uncle Sam has assisted with the development of her technology. She decides to stay and fight with the group. Moments after this, she sees the death of the Invisible Hood, another ally, killed by a S.H.A.D.E.-influenced Ray.

Over the course of &quot;Uncle Sam and the Freedom Fighters&quot; vol. 2 (2007), Jenna is mutated by an alien insect colony into a human/bee hybrid, with enhanced physical abilities, pheromone production capabilities, and antennae on her head.

However, her mind is later completely circumvented by the mutation. After trying to colonize the entire Earth, she is cured of her affliction when Lanford Terrill uses his new Neon powers to destroy the insect influence. By the series&#x27; end, Jenna feels guilt over her actions, and she eschews the superhero life to continue her work in the research field.

==Powers and abilities==
Richard Raleigh had no superpowers but carried a special &quot;Stinger Gun&quot; and he specialized in the use of trained bees.

Jenna Raleigh possesses a human/insect biology which grants her enhanced physical attributes (i.e. superhuman strength), pheromone production, and the ability to &quot;mark&quot; people for later tracking.

Jenna formerly wore a mechanized battle suit which granted her enhanced strength, flight, and used two large robotic bees that could fire electricity blasts.

==Reception==
In &quot;American Comic Book Chronicles: 1940-1944&quot;, comics historian Kurt Mitchell calls the Golden Age strip &quot;inane&quot;, and describes it in a dismissive way: &quot;... a masked mystery-man aided by the trained bees he stored in his belt buckle. No, that&#x27;s not a typo. Bees. &quot;Trained&quot; bees. In his belt buckle&quot;.

==In other media==

* The Richard Raleigh and Jenna Raleigh incarnations of Red Bee appear as character summons in &quot;Scribblenauts Unmasked: A DC Comics Adventure&quot;.
* The Richard Raleigh incarnation of Red Bee appears in &quot;Teen Titans Go!&quot; #3.

<text>Richard Scott Bakker (born February 2, 1967) is a Canadian fantasy author. He grew up on a tobacco farm in the Simcoe area.

==Works==
=== Fiction ===

==== The Second Apocalypse ====
&quot;The Second Apocalypse&quot; is a fantasy series that includes three sub-series titled &quot;The Prince of Nothing&quot;, &quot;The Aspect-Emperor&quot;, and &quot;The No-God&quot;. The series was originally planned as a trilogy, but when Bakker began writing the series in the early 2000s he found it necessary to split each of the three novels into its own sub-series to incorporate all of the characters, themes and ideas he wished to explore.

&quot;The&quot; &quot;Prince of Nothing&quot; trilogy was published between 2004 and 2006, while &quot;The Aspect-Emperor series&quot; was published between 2009 and 2017. &quot;The No-God&quot; has not been published at this time, and Bakker has not confirmed a release date.

==== Neuropath ====
While working on the &quot;Prince of Nothing&quot; series, Bakker was prompted by a crux of events to write a thriller dealing with the cognitive sciences. He produced a near future science fiction novel involving a serial killer whose knowledge allows them to influence and control the human brain. This book is called &quot;Neuropath&quot; and was published in 2008.

==== &quot;The Disciple of the Dog&quot; ====
Shortly before &quot;The Aspect-Emperor&quot;&#x27;s second book, &quot;The White-Luck Warrior&quot;, was published, Bakker released a second novel outside of his main fantasy series. Titled &quot;Disciple of the Dog&quot;, it features the private investigator, Disciple Manning, who suffers from a condition reminiscent of hyperthymesia. The story revolves around Disciple&#x27;s recounting of a case involving a missing girl, a cult, and the small-town drama of Ruddick. It was published in November 2010. Bakker has planned a number of follow up novels to &quot;Disciple of the Dog&quot;, including &quot;The Enlightened Dead,&quot; but due to the first novel&#x27;s poor reception and very few reviews the sequels have not been pursued.

==== Other works ====
Bakker also has a number of unreleased works in progress, aside his fantasy opus, most notably &quot;Light, Time, and Gravity&quot; as well as an eventual anthology of short stories, &quot;Atrocity Tales&quot;, set within &quot;The Second Apocalypse&quot; fantasy narrative. A draft of &quot;Light, Time, and Gravity&quot; was released serially on Bakker&#x27;s blog, Three Pound Brain, but has since been removed. It is described by a defunct Amazon.ca link as a &quot;novel told from the perspective of a suicidal English professor, recalling his experiences as a seventeen-year-old working on a Southwestern Ontario tobacco farm in the summer of 1984. Part essay, part narrative, part present, part history, Light, Time, and Gravity is a kind of Notes from the Canadian Underground, a portrait of our culture’s abject failure to create a genuine Canadian identity, as well as a stinging indictment of Canada’s literary and intellectual elites.&quot;

Two other unreleased works of fiction in progress include the SF novellas &quot;Semantica&quot; and &quot;The Lollipop Factory.&quot; The former has been referenced by Bakker a number of times on his blog and is described by fans as a &quot;rumoured title set in a world where nootropic and neurocosmetic techniques have created a class division between those with enhancements and those without, where superhuman Tweakers rebel and are hunted like animals by an oppressive government.&quot; The latter, &quot;The Lollipop Factory&quot;, has only been mentioned once by Bakker in a Reddit r/Fantasy AMA in 2017. Aside that it is a &quot;short SF novel,&quot; nothing is yet known about this title.

==== Philosophy ====
As &quot;The Prince of Nothing&quot; trilogy was being published in 2003-06 and Bakker experienced his initial rise in popularity, he participated frequently with fans at the now read-only Three-Seas forum. During this time Bakker consistently began to formulate and popularize what would eventually become the foundation for his Blind Brain Theory and Heuristic Neglect Theory then focusing on how studies of human cognitive biases generally and eventually on their impact on academic Philosophy and the greater humanities.

==== Blind Brain Hypothesis ====
In 2008, Bakker published &quot;Neuropath&quot;, a near future SF psychothriller which thematically continued Bakker&#x27;s elucidation of human cognitive biases and their implications regarding human meaning, purpose, and morality, whatever form they may take. While the narrative events of the book make for a compelling thought experiment, Bakker included as an Author Afterword a short essay regarding the blending of factual and fictive premises therein and the eventual advent of the narrative&#x27;s villain in our own world. The essay marks Bakker first formal mention of his Blind Brain Hypothesis&quot;,&quot; beyond its use in the narrative proper.

Narrative aside, in the Author Afterword Bakker sources two real world examples concerning illusory consciousness, the inner human experience of temporality and the imperceptible limits of field of vision. In the essay, as in the book via the character Thomas, Bakker argues that the human sense of the &quot;Now,&quot; this very moment, might be symptomatic of perceptual thresholds akin to the human inability to perceive beyond the field of vision, certain colours outside within that field, or the perceptual blind spot caused by the lack of receptors in a portion of the back of the eye. Bakker cites the inability of consciousness to experience and perceive but a sliver of all the brain&#x27;s processing as indicative of consciousness experience being totally illusory, rather than only sometimes in some contexts. As per the world of &quot;Neuropath&#x27;s&quot; narrative, Bakker also argues that in time non-invasive brain scanning, via something like the narrative conceit of &quot;low-field fMRI,&quot; may result in an entirely new scale of institutional manipulation, moving beyond efforts of associative conditioning given the wealth of data prevalent real-time brain imaging could provide. Finally, central to the essay is Bakker&#x27;s assertion that the scientific method and its progress would eventually yield unfathomable insights into human behavior and cognition such that the existence of the narrative&#x27;s villain and his futuristic brain–computer interface are inevitable in real life as well.

==== The Semantic Apocalypse ====
Shortly thereafter in 2008, Bakker presented &quot;The End of the World As We Know It: Neuroscience and the Semantic Apocalypse&quot; at Western University&#x27;s Centre for the Study of Theory and Criticism, which was rebutted by then students Nick Srnicek and Ali McMillan. The title of Bakker&#x27;s lecture, familiar to readers of &quot;Neuropath&quot;, references the Semantic Apocalypse, a theory attributed to one of the protagonist&#x27;s professors.

Bakker begins the talk with a call to writers in the audience to reach beyond the confines of academia and their peers and instead write to challenge audiences who don&#x27;t share the author&#x27;s values and attitudes. He then summarizes again the narrative underpinnings of &quot;Neuropath&quot;&#x27;s world where the technologies of neuroscience have reached technical and social maturity and prevalence.

&quot;The Semantic Apocalypse&quot; continues with a number of secondary arguments concerning pessimistic induction and what Bakker calls &quot;Cognitive Closure FAPP.&quot; Regarding the former, Bakker explains that in all arenas historically science has replaced &quot;intentional [or folk] explanations of natural phenomena with functional explanations.&quot; For Bakker it follows that this will inevitably extend to the brain and human cognition. On the latter, Bakker suggests that human culture and society have continually ignored the facts of our cognitive biases without due consideration of their impact. This gives rise to what Bakker refers to as the &quot;Magical Belief Lottery:&quot; the ignorance of a growing battery of confirmation biases concerning how humans rationalize behaviour and thought leading to conviction in long-held intentional or folk explanations of humans and their place in the world.

Building on his elucidations from &quot;Neuropath&quot;&#x27;s Author Afterword, Bakker presents the metaphor of the Blind Brain Hypothesis as a magician&#x27;s coin trick. By Bakker&#x27;s argument the brain has evolved to process a prodigious amount of perceptual information regarding its local environment tracking natural objects with causal histories. Coin tricks through sleight of hand or misdirection exploit the brain&#x27;s need for that causal history, confounding the brain&#x27;s ability to process the coin&#x27;s causal history. Given the central assumption of Blind Brain Hypothesis, that &quot;information that finds its way to consciousness represents only a small fraction of the brain’s overall information load,&quot; humans are likely likewise unable to account for the causal history of thoughts and behaviours. It supposes that our conscious awareness of information processed by the brain is preceded by what Bakker calls here information horizons. Again Bakker draws upon the analogy of the eye&#x27;s perceptual thresholds, this time highlighting that half of all the retinal nerves process information exclusively from the receptor rich fovea, and also extends that metaphor to speculate about the information horizons of our temporal field and the experience of the &quot;Now.&quot;

Finishing his lecture and corresponding transcript, Bakker speaks on the money invested into using the advances in neuroscience to improve marketing techniques. Bakker also uses a metaphor on alien cognition describing beings whose brains and nervous systems had evolved to track their brain&#x27;s causal history.

==== The Last Magic Show ====
In April 2012, Bakker added to &quot;Three Pound Brain&quot; a link to a draft of a paper he called &quot;The Last Magic Show: A Blind Brain Theory for the Appearance of Consciousness.&quot; &quot;The Last Magic Show&quot; was the first cumulative result of Bakker&#x27;s efforts on &quot;Three Pound Brain&quot; and consolidated many terms invented or cited and appropriated across the previous two years of philosophic inquiry and analysis. The draft marked the first formal mention of &quot;Blind Brain Theory&quot;, as evolved from the &quot;Blind Brain Hypothesis.&quot; In his abstract Bakker describes the paper as addressing &quot;[p]uzzles as profound and persistent as the now, personal identity, conscious unity, and most troubling of all, intentionality, could very well be kinds of illusions foisted on conscious awareness by different versions of the informatic limitation expressed, for instance, in the boundary of your visual field.&quot;

The title of Bakker&#x27;s paper, &quot;A Blind Brain Theory for the Appearance of Consciousness&quot;, reflects his assertion therein that the &quot;Blind Brain Theory&quot; serves as a vehicle to describe and distinguish the features of how conscious experience appears to self-reflection rather than the actual specific systems and functioning underlying consciousness. To begin, Bakker imagines an explanatory vehicle he refers to as a Recursive System, the brain architecture which has evolved to track even more the basic architecture of itself, possibly akin to the relationship between the frontal cortex to the rest of the brain. Bakker suggests two parts to a Recursive System, the system &quot;open,&quot; all the information processed by the brain, and the system &quot;closed,&quot; referring to the information accessible to consciousness. The basic assumption regarding the existence of a Recursive System implies a limit on the information available to the RS-closed, conscious awareness, which Bakker dubs Informatic Asymmetry and its Asymptotic Limit. As specific examples Bakker refers to the cognitive psychology literature citing change blindness and inattentional bias (cognitive bias), wherein there are clear divergences between the information processed by the brain and information from the self-reports of perception.

As Bakker continues he expands on Informatic Asymmetry and the Asymptotic Limits of different Recursive Systems writing of information horizons, &quot;the boundaries that delimit the recursive neural access that underwrites consciousness.&quot; Describing consciousness as encapsulated by the global limit of information horizons, Bakker highlights consciousness&#x27; inability to perceive any absence of information, that is processing outside of the RS-closed, as in some anosognosias. The information provided to consciousness is perceived as sufficient because the RS-closed is unable to track the discrepancy of the information processed by the whole brain. Bakker returns to the Coin Trick analogy from &quot;Neuropath&#x27;s&quot; Author Afterword, using the magician as an extended explanatory metaphor to further elucidate Asymptotic Limits of specific Recursive Systems and the Asymptotic Complex of encapsulation regarding the experience of persistent global sufficiency, from where the paper almost certainly gets the former part of its title.

As before, Bakker builds on previous exposition reframing the experience of &quot;the Now,&quot; with a portion of the draft directly referencing an older blog post. Likewise, he again uses the example of the visual field to propose a similar temporal explanation for the conscious experience the Now. &quot;Blind Brain Theory&quot;, Bakker writes, argues seemingly natural occurring anosognosias but maintains that this becomes ultimately problematic for our experience of identity and intentions.

Further elaborating, Bakker cites the phenomenon in psychophysics known as flicker fusion (or flicker fusion threshold), the point at which consciousness perceives a light as steady. This phenomenon is widely exploited in the modern human environment from light bulbs to screened devices and brings about similar explanatory power akin to Bakker&#x27;s use of the visual field metaphor.

Nearing the close of &quot;The Last Magic Show&quot;, Bakker delves into the highly speculative implications of &quot;Blind Brain Theory&quot;&#x27;s argument for the appearance of consciousness regarding the use and reference of Intentionality in academic philosophy, as well as, the very underpinnings of humanity&#x27;s scientific and philosophic endeavours, logic and math, the latter of which might reference an earlier essayistic work posted to &quot;Three Pound Brain.&quot; He also writes of the &quot;First-person Perspective Show,&quot; which almost definitely precedes his draft paper, &quot;The Introspective Peep Show&quot;. In the footnotes of &quot;The Last Magic Show&quot;, Bakker mentions that threads of his consideration have found themselves in every novel he&#x27;s written, but that specifically &quot;[o]nly Neuropath deals with the theory in any sustained manner.&quot; Bakker also takes care to distinguish &quot;Blind Brain Theory&quot; from eliminativism generally, in that, his theory &quot;allows for a systematic diagnosis of the distortions and illusions belonging to the first person perspective.&quot;

==== Through the Brain Darkly ====
A proposed anthology of &quot;Three Pound Brain&quot;&#x27;s essays and articles named for a fictional book that appears in &quot;Neuropath&quot;, mentioned on &quot;Three Pound Brain&quot; in April 2013. Later in September, 2013, Bakker later posted a draft essay possibly serving as the last piece to be included in &quot;Through the Brain Darkly.&quot;

==== Back to Square One ====
An essay published on &quot;Scientia Salon,&quot; November 2014.

==== Crash Space ====
A near future SF short announced on &quot;Three Pound Brain&quot;, November 2015, and released in &quot;Midwest Studies in Philosophy&quot;.

==== The Digital Dionysus ====
An anthology of essays published in September 2016 examining &quot;the importance of Nietzsche&#x27;s thought for decoding the vicissitudes of our digital age&quot; (Keith Ansell-Pearson); Bakker contributed a chapter based on the talk that he presented to the annual &quot;Nietzsche Workshop @ Western&quot; -- a conference which he had regularly attended in London, the final year of which took place at The New School in New York City..

==== From Scripture to Fantasy ====

<doc id="843901" wikidata="Q7553984" url="?curid=843901" title="Soft independent modelling of class analogies">
<text>Soft independent modelling by class analogy (SIMCA) is a statistical method for supervised classification of data. The method requires a training data set consisting of samples (or objects) with a set of attributes and their class membership. The term soft refers to the fact the classifier can identify samples as belonging to multiple classes and not necessarily producing a classification of samples into non-overlapping classes.

==Method==
In order to build the classification models, the samples belonging to each class need to be analysed using principal component analysis (PCA); only the significant components are retained. 

For a given class, the resulting model then describes either a line (for one Principal Component or PC), plane (for two PCs) or hyper-plane (for more than two PCs). For each modelled class, the mean orthogonal distance of training data samples from the line, plane, or hyper-plane (calculated as the residual standard deviation) is used to determine a critical distance for classification. This critical distance is based on the F-distribution and is usually calculated using 95% or 99% confidence intervals.

New observations are projected into each PC model and the residual distances calculated. An observation is assigned to the model class when its residual distance from the model is below the statistical limit for the class. The observation may be found to belong to multiple classes and a measure of goodness of the model can be found from the number of cases where the observations are classified into multiple classes. The classification efficiency is usually indicated by Receiver operating characteristics.

In the original SIMCA method, the ends of the hyper-plane of each class are closed off by setting statistical control limits along the retained principal components axes (i.e., score value between plus and minus 0.5 times score standard deviation).

More recent adaptations of the SIMCA method close off the hyper-plane by construction of ellipsoids (e.g. Hotelling&#x27;s T2 or Mahalanobis distance). With such modified SIMCA methods, classification of an object requires both that its orthogonal distance from the model and its projection within the model (i.e. score value within the region defined by the ellipsoid) are not significant.

==Application==
SIMCA as a method of classification has gained widespread use especially in applied statistical fields such as chemometrics and spectroscopic data analysis.

<doc id="843904" wikidata="Q415538" url="?curid=843904" title="Tetrahedrane">
<text>Tetrahedrane is a hypothetical platonic hydrocarbon with chemical formula and a tetrahedral structure. The molecule would be subject to considerable angle strain and has not been synthesized . However, a number of derivatives have been prepared. In a more general sense, the term &quot;tetrahedranes&quot; is used to describe a class of molecules and ions with related structure, e.g. white phosphorus.

==Organic tetrahedranes==
In 1978, Günther Maier prepared tetra-&quot;tert&quot;-butyl-tetrahedrane. The bulky &quot;tert&quot;-butyl (&quot;t&quot;-Bu) substituents envelop the tetrahedrane core. Maier suggested that bonds in the core are prevented from breaking because this would force the substituents closer together (corset effect) resulting in Van der Waals strain. Tetrahedrane is one of the possible platonic hydrocarbons and has the IUPAC name tricyclo[1.1.0.02,4]butane.

Unsubstituted tetrahedrane () remains elusive, although it is predicted to be kinetically stable. One strategy that has been explored (but thus far failed) is reaction of propene with atomic carbon. Locking away a tetrahedrane molecule inside a fullerene has only been attempted &quot;in silico&quot;. Due to its bond strain and stoichiometry, tetranitrotetrahedrane has potential as a high-performance energetic material (explosive). Some properties have been calculated based on quantum chemical methods.

===Tetra-&quot;tert&quot;-butyltetrahedrane===
This compound was first synthesised starting from a cycloaddition of an alkyne with &quot;t&quot;-Bu substituted maleic anhydride, followed by rearrangement with carbon dioxide expulsion to a cyclopentadienone and its bromination, followed by addition of the fourth &quot;t&quot;-Bu group. Photochemical cheletropic elimination of carbon monoxide of the cyclopentadienone gives the target. Heating tetra-&quot;tert&quot;-butyltetrahedrane gives tetra-&quot;tert&quot;-butylcyclobutadiene. Though the synthesis appears short and simple, by Maier&#x27;s own account, it took several years of careful observation and optimization to develop the correct conditions for the challenging reactions to take place. For instance, the synthesis of tetrakis(&quot;t-&quot;butyl)cyclopentadienone from the tris(&quot;t&quot;-butyl)bromocyclopentadienone (itself synthesized with much difficulty) required over 50 attempts before working conditions could be found. The synthesis was described as requiring &quot;astonishing persistence and experimental skill&quot; in one retrospective of the work. In a classic reference work on stereochemistry, the authors remark that &quot;the relatively straightforward scheme shown [...] conceals both the limited availability of the starting material and the enormous amount of work required in establishing the proper conditions for each step.&quot; 

Eventually, a more scalable synthesis was conceived, in which the last step was the photolysis of a cyclopropenyl-substituted diazomethane, which affords the desired product through the intermediacy of tetrakis(&quot;tert&quot;-butyl)cyclobutadiene: This approach took advantage of the observation that the tetrahedrane and the cyclobutadiene could be interconverted (uv irradiation in the forward direction, heat in the reverse direction).

===Tetrakis(trimethylsilyl)tetrahedrane===

Tetrakis(trimethylsilyl)tetrahedrane can be prepared by treatment of the cyclobutadiene precursor with tris(pentafluorophenyl)borane and is far more stable than the &quot;tert&quot;-butyl analogue. The silicon–carbon bond is longer than a carbon–carbon bond, and therefore the corset effect is reduced. Whereas the &quot;tert&quot;-butyl tetrahedrane melts at 135 °C concomitant with rearrangement to the cyclobutadiene, tetrakis(trimethylsilyl)tetrahedrane, which melts at 202 °C, is stable up to 300 °C, at which point it cracks to bis(trimethylsilyl)acetylene. 

The tetrahedrane skeleton is made up of banana bonds, and hence the carbon atoms are high in s-orbital character. From NMR, sp-hybridization can be deduced, normally reserved for triple bonds. As a consequence the bond lengths are unusually short with 152 picometers.

Reaction with methyllithium with tetrakis(trimethylsilyl)tetrahedrane yields tetrahedranyllithium. Coupling reactions with this lithium compound gives extended structures.

A bis(tetrahedrane) has also been reported. The connecting bond is even shorter with 143.6 pm. An ordinary carbon–carbon bond has a length of 154 pm.

==Tetrahedranes with non-carbon cores==
In tetrasilatetrahedrane features a core of four silicon atoms. The standard silicon–silicon bond is much longer (235 pm) and the cage is again enveloped by a total of 16 trimethylsilyl groups, which confer stability. The silatetrahedrane can be reduced with potassium graphite to the tetrasilatetrahedranide potassium derivative. In this compound one of the silicon atoms of the cage has lost a silyl substituent and carries a negative charge. The potassium cation can be sequestered by a crown ether, and in the resulting complex potassium and the silyl anion are separated by a distance of 885 pm. One of the Si−–Si bonds is now 272 pm and the tetravalent silicon atom of that bond has an inverted tetrahedral geometry. Furthermore, the four cage silicon atoms are equivalent on the NMR timescale due to migrations of the silyl substituents over the cage.

The dimerization reaction observed for the carbon tetrahedrane compound is also attempted for a tetrasilatetrahedrane. In this tetrahedrane the cage is protected by four so-called supersilyl groups in which a silicon atom has 3 &quot;tert&quot;-butyl substituents. The dimer does not materialize but a reaction with iodine in benzene followed by reaction with the tri-&quot;tert&quot;-butylsilaanion results in the formation of an eight-membered silicon cluster compound which can be described as a dumbbell (length 229 pm and with inversion of tetrahedral geometry) sandwiched between two almost-parallel rings.

In eight-membered clusters of in the same carbon group, tin and germanium the cluster atoms are located on the corners of a cube.

There are a wide variety of pnictogen-substituted tetrahedranes.

==Inorganic and organometallic tetrahedranes==

The tetrahedrane motif occurs broadly in chemistry. White phosphorus (P4) and yellow arsenic (As4) are examples. Several metal carbonyl clusters are referred to as tetrahedranes, e.g. tetrarhodium dodecacarbonyl.

Metallatetrahedranes with a single metal (or phosphorus atom) capping a cyclopropyl trianion also exist.

<text>Edward Augustine Walsh (May 14, 1881 – May 26, 1959) was an American pitcher and manager in Major League Baseball, nicknamed &quot;Big Ed&quot;. From 1906 to 1912, he had several seasons where he was one of the best pitchers in baseball. Walsh holds the record for lowest career earned run average, 1.82. He is one of two modern (post-1901) pitchers to win 40 or more games in a single season, and the last pitcher to do so. He is the last pitcher from any team to throw more than 400 innings in a single season, a feat he accomplished in 1907 and 1908. Though injuries shortened his career, he was inducted into the Baseball Hall of Fame in 1946.

==Early life==
Walsh was born in Plains Township, Pennsylvania, to Michael and Jane Walsh. He worked in the Luzerne County coal mines when he was young. Walsh started his professional baseball career with the 1902 Meriden Silverites of the Connecticut State League. After playing the 1903 season with the Meriden Silverites and Newark Sailors of the Eastern League, the Chicago White Sox purchased Walsh&#x27;s contract for $750 ($ in today&#x27;s dollars).

==MLB career==

===Peak years===
Walsh made his major league debut in 1904 with the Chicago White Sox and pitched his first full season in 1906, going 17–13 with a 1.88 ERA and 171 strikeouts. In Game Three of that year&#x27;s World Series, which the White Sox won over the Chicago Cubs in six games, Walsh struck out a then-World Series record 12 batters. He also struck out at least one batter each inning of that game; this feat has since been duplicated only once, by Bob Gibson in the 1968 World Series opener. From this season through 1912, Walsh averaged 24 victories and 220 strikeouts and posted an ERA below 2.00 five times. He also led the league in saves five times in this span. His finest individual season came in 1908 when he went 40–15 with 269 strikeouts, 6 saves and a 1.42 ERA, leading the American League in wins and strikeouts. In 1910, he posted the lowest ERA (1.27) for a pitcher with at least 20 starts and a losing record. Walsh also set an American League record by pitching 464 innings in a season. On August 27, 1911, Walsh no-hit the Boston Red Sox 5–0.
Interviewed for the 1966 book &quot;The Glory of Their Times&quot;, Hall of Famer Sam Crawford referred to Walsh&#x27;s use of a pitch that was later outlawed: &quot;Big Ed Walsh. Great big, strong, good-looking fellow. He threw a spitball. I think that ball disintegrated on the way to the plate, and the catcher put it back together again. I swear, when it went past the plate, it was just the spit went by&quot;.

In 1910, the White Sox opened White Sox Park, which was soon nicknamed Comiskey Park by the press in honor of team owner Charles Comiskey. The name was officially changed to Comiskey Park in 1913. An apocryphal story goes that architect Zachary Taylor Davis consulted Walsh in setting the park&#x27;s field dimensions. Choosing a design that favored himself and other White Sox pitchers, rather than hitters, Walsh made Comiskey Park a &quot;pitcher&#x27;s park&quot; for its entire 80-year history.

===Later career===

Walsh was a workhorse who pitched an average of 375 innings annually during the six seasons of 1907 through 1912. After the 1912 season, Walsh reportedly requested a full year off to rest his arm. Nevertheless, he showed up for spring training the following season, contending, &quot;The White Sox needed me—implored me to return—so I did&quot;. Walsh inherited 24 runners in 1912 and allowed none of them to score, setting a Major League record that stands .

Walsh&#x27;s playing time began dwindling in 1913. It has been claimed that he came into spring training in poorer physical shape than other members of the White Sox pitching staff, and his pride led him to try to keep up with the other pitchers in terms of pitch speed before getting into adequate shape, thereby causing damage to his pitching arm. &quot;I could feel the muscles grind and wrench during the game, and it seemed to me my arm would leap out of my socket when I shot the ball across the plate&quot;, Walsh later recalled. &quot;My arm would keep me awake till morning with a pain I had never known before&quot;. He pitched only 16 games during the 1913 season, and a meager 13 games over the next three years.

By 1916, Walsh&#x27;s arm was dead. He wanted a year off, but Charles Comiskey released him instead. He attempted a comeback with the Boston Braves in 1917, but was let go, ending his major league career. He later did some pitching in the Eastern League, and gave umpiring a try (he umpired 87 American League games during the 1922 season), after which he was a coach for the White Sox for several seasons (1923–1924, 1928–1929).

Walsh retired with 195 wins, 126 losses, and 1736 strikeouts. His career ERA of 1.82 is the lowest major league ERA ever posted. He has the third-lowest career WHIP in MLB history (1.00) and the lowest ever for someone with 10 or more seasons pitched.

As a hitter, Walsh posted a .194 batting average (210-for-1,085) with 92 runs, 3 home runs, 68 RBI, 14 stolen bases and 46 bases on balls.

==Managerial record==
==Later life and legacy==
Walsh was inducted into the Baseball Hall of Fame in 1946. He died on May 26, 1959, 12 days after his 78th birthday.

In 1999, Walsh was ranked number 82 on &quot;The Sporting News&quot;&#x27; list of the 100 Greatest Baseball Players, and was nominated as a finalist for the Major League Baseball All-Century Team. In 2011, he was inducted into the Irish American Baseball Hall of Fame.

Walsh&#x27;s son Ed Walsh Jr. played for the White Sox from 1928 to 1932.

<text>Jada Rowland (born February 23, 1943) is an American actress.

==Early life==
A native of Staten Island, Rowland was born into a family of actors and artists. Rowland is the sister of actor Jeffrey Rowland and actress Gigi Anderson. Her brother played her husband on &quot;As the World Turns&quot; (Dr. Dan Stewart), although they appeared on the show in different years. Rowland&#x27;s sister appeared on &quot;The Secret Storm&quot; as Peggy Bennett during the time Rowland was working on the show.

== Career ==
She has appeared on Broadway and television daytime soap operas. She has appeared as Dr. Susan Stewart on &quot;As the World Turns&quot; and Carolee Simpson Aldrich, R. N. #2 on &quot;The Doctors&quot; starting September 7, 1976, until the final episode on December 31, 1982. She later appeared on the prime-time serial &quot;The Hamptons.&quot; She was offered an audition for the Dustin Hoffman film &quot;Tootsie,&quot; since that feature film incorporated a fictional soap opera, &quot;Southwest General,&quot; but she rejected it.

In her signature role, Rowland portrayed Amy Ames Britton Kincaid on &quot;The Secret Storm&quot; for most of its 20-year run. This character grew up in real time instead of the common soap-opera &quot;rapid aging&quot;, where a young actor is replaced by an older one to age the character more quickly.

Published children&#x27;s books she has illustrated include &quot;Bringing the Farmhouse Home&quot; (by Gloria Whelan, Simon &amp; Schuster Books for Young Readers, 1992); &quot;Miss Tizzy&quot; (by Libba Moore Gray, Simon &amp; Schuster Books for Young Readers, 1993); &quot;The Statue of Liberty&quot; (by Lucille Recht Penner, Random House, 1995); and &quot;Raising the Roof&quot; (by Ronald Kidd, Habitat for Humanity International, 1995).

<doc id="843911" wikidata="Q4689581" url="?curid=843911" title="Africa Online">
<text>Africa Online Holding Ltd., sometimes abbreviated to AFOL, is the largest Internet Service Provider (ISP) in Africa. Based in Nairobi, Kenya, it offers Internet access and operates in ten African countries, including Côte d&#x27;Ivoire, Ghana, Namibia, Eswatini, Tanzania, Uganda and Zimbabwe. Services provided by Africa Online include dial-up Internet access, leased line services, e-mail accounts, VSAT connectivity, DSL, WAN and VPN for private and business customers. In 2007 it has become a subsidiary of Telkom South Africa.

==History==

The company was started in 1994 by Ayisi Makatiani, Karanja Gakio and Amolo Ng&#x27;weno, three Kenyans who met each other while students in Cambridge, Massachusetts. Makatiani and Gakio were at MIT while Ng&#x27;weno was at Harvard. The basic idea for an online news service for Kenyans developed from an online community hosted at MIT called KenyaNet. KenyaNet was one of several Africa-focused online communities (the others were Okyeame in Ghana, Naijanet in Nigeria, and Salonet in Sierra Leone) formed and run by MIT students and hosted on MIT servers.

With the commercialization of the internet, Africa Online moved its focus away from providing news to connecting Africans on the continent to the Internet. In 1995, the company was bought by International Wireless of Boston, which ultimately became Prodigy. During this period, Africa Online began operating as the first Kenyan ISP, and later expanded to Côte d&#x27;Ivoire (1995) to Ghana, Tanzania, Uganda, Zambia, Zimbabwe and Swaziland, with the three Kenyans continuing to manage the operation. In the process, Africa Online acquired several ISPs, such as Pipex Internet Solution (Swaziland), Net2000 (Kenya), UUNET (Namibia) and Swift Global (Uganda).

In 1998, Prodigy sold the company to the African Lakes Corporation. African Lakes had been listed on the London Stock Exchange since 1877 and was now moving away from its traditional background in agriculture and mining. For a while the company enjoyed favor from investors, listing on the Nairobi Stock Exchange in 2001, but its stock subsequently lost ground and it was delisted in both London and Nairobi in 2003. By that time, the 3 founders had departed Africa Online. 

Africa Online was bought by Telkom South Africa in 2007.

<text>Serotta is an American bicycle builder located in Saratoga Springs, New York. Named after founder Ben Serotta, the company was founded in 1972.

Serotta built frames for the Coors, Crest and 7-Eleven pro teams, although Team 7-Eleven bikes were branded as Murray and later Huffy. Serotta also built bikes for the 1984 Los Angeles Olympic Games. Serotta was known in the industry for its proprietary tube designs and revolutionary titanium bicycle building. Serotta sold the company in 1989 to Archibald Cox Jr., son of Watergate special prosecutor Archibald Cox Jr. Cox later purchased Fat City Cycles and merged it with Serotta in response to growing interest in mountain biking. In 1997, Ben Serotta and his wife Marcie bought the company back from Cox.

Serotta also has a bicycle-fitting system. The Serotta Fit School, started in 1998, trains retailers, coaches and clinicians in a system that incorporates the rider&#x27;s life, goals, fitness, body, flexibility, motion, experience, injuries, surgeries and physical concerns. In the past, a fitting system that included a Size Cycle with quick release levers on all adjustable parts of a bicycle frame. The customer would come prepared for a cycling workout. As the cyclist pedaled, the fitter would measure and adjust the frame, based on the factors listed above. When the workout was over, the frame measurements were taken and the bicycle was custom-ordered for the cyclist. Today, Serotta runs the Serotta International Cycle Institute where his staff teaches bicycle fit concepts that are now significantly more advanced than the days of the Size Cycle.

In June 2013, Serotta merged with Blue Competition Cycles and Mad Fiber Wheels under the name of Divine Cycling Group. In July 2013, Serotta ceased manufacturing bicycles, but Ben Serotta resumed sales of own-brand bicycles in 2017 and launched a direct-to-consumer business in 2020.

== History ==

=== 2015 ===
Ben Serotta helped redesign the Citi Bike for New York City&#x27;s bike sharing system.

=== 2017 ===
Ben Serotta returned to selling bicycles under the name of Serotta Design Studio.

=== 2020 ===
Ben Serotta announced the return of Serotta branded bicycles. The new Serotta re-launch is built upon on a direct-to-consumer strategy, as opposed to its former small network of bicycle shops throughout the country. Serotta&#x27;s focus on fit and custom-built frames is still at the core of what the company is built upon.

Available bicycles include Duetti for road cycling, Modomio for pavement, dirt, and gravel, and Scappero, mainly for dirt, gravel, and trail. Serotta plans to launch a new offering to their line every six months and Ben Serotta has said that this plan will inevitably include an e-bike.

Boganda was born into a family of farmers, and was adopted and educated by Roman Catholic missionaries after the death of his parents. In 1938, he was ordained as a Roman Catholic priest. During World War II, Boganda served in a number of missions and afterwards was persuaded by the Bishop of Bangui to enter politics. In 1946, he became the first Oubanguian elected to the National Assembly of France, where he spoke out against racism and the abuses of the colonial regime. He then returned to Oubangui-Chari to form a political organisation, culminating in the 1949 foundation of the Movement for the Social Evolution of Black Africa (MESAN), which became popular among villagers and the peasantry. Boganda was laicized from the priesthood after developing a relationship with and eventually marrying Michelle Jourdain, a parliamentary secretary. Nonetheless, he continued to advocate for equal treatment and fundamental rights for blacks in the territory well into the 1950s. As France conceded measures of representation to its colonies, MESAN won local elections and he gained influence in Oubangui-Chari&#x27;s government, though his reputation suffered when he backed an unsuccessful economic scheme.

In 1958 French Prime Minister Charles de Gaulle proposed the creation of a French Community through which France&#x27;s colonies could associate with the metropole. After being assured that Oubangui-Chari&#x27;s membership in the community would not preclude it from securing independence at a later time, Boganda supported joining it. He sought to do so as part of a federation with other territories in French Equatorial Africa as a &quot;Central African Republic&quot;, which he believed would bolster the financial situation of the member states. He hoped this would serve as the basis for a United States of Latin Africa, a conglomeration including other countries in central Africa. This never came to fruition, and on 1 December, Boganda declared the establishment of the Central African Republic for only Oubangui-Chari. Boganda became the autonomous territory&#x27;s first premier as the President of the Council of Government, and began drawing up administrative reforms and preparing for the next election. He was killed in a plane crash on 29 March 1959, while en route to Bangui. Experts found a trace of explosives in the plane&#x27;s wreckage, but a full report on the incident was never published, and the possibility of an assassination remains unresolved. The Central African Republic attained formal independence from France in 1960. Boganda&#x27;s death is annually commemorated in the country, and his presence in the national collective memory remains politically potent.

==Early life==
Little is known about Boganda&#x27;s early life. He was born around the year 1910 to a family of farmers in Bobangui, a large M&#x27;Baka village in the Lobaye basin located at the edge of the equatorial forest some southwest of Bangui. His father, Swalakpé, was a village head and the wealthy owner of several palm plantations who had taken numerous wives. Boganda&#x27;s mother, Siribé, was Swalakpé&#x27;s third wife. French commercial exploitation of Central Africa had reached an apogee around the time of Boganda&#x27;s birth, and although interrupted by World War I, activity resumed in the 1920s. The French consortia used what was essentially a form of slavery—the &quot;corvée&quot;—and one of the most notorious was the Compagnie Forestière de la Haute Sangha-Oubangui (CFSO), involved in rubber gathering in the Lobaye district. Coercive labour practices, violence, and disease had severely disrupted traditional society by the time Boganda was born. Bobangui was particularly affected by these elements. His uncle, whose son, Jean-Bédel Bokassa, would later crown himself as the Emperor of the Central African Empire, was beaten to death at a colonial police station as a result of his alleged resistance to work.

Both of Boganda&#x27;s parents died when he was young; his father was reportedly killed in a punitive campaign conducted by colonial forces shortly after his birth. His mother died before 1915, probably having been murdered by a CFSO militiaman for not having met a rubber collection quota. Boganda was then given to the care of a guardian who joined the French Army during World War I and was killed at the Battle of Verdun. He was subsequently placed in the tutelage of other relatives, and in 1920 he contracted smallpox. In June his brother was instructed to take him to an uncle, and along the way they encountered a French patrol led by a Lieutenant Mayer. His brother fled out of fear. Left alone, Boganda said, &quot;Gboganda&quot;. This was probably a Ngbaka phrase meaning &quot;I am [from] elsewhere&quot;, and he was probably hoping to explain that he was lost. The soldiers believed this was his name, rendering it &quot;Boganda&quot;, and the name was used for the rest of his life. Mayer took him to the orphanage in the nearby town of Mbaïki. Once there, a Spiritan missionary touring the area decided to take him to the mission station of Saint Jean Baptiste in Bétou, a town further south on the Ubangi River which was home to a school.

At Bétou, Boganda was instructed in reading and writing in Lingala. Most accounts concur that he was an excellent student. In December 1921 he was taken to the main Spiritan mission of Saint Paul des Rapides in Bangui, the capital of Oubangui-Chari. He was baptised there under the name Barthélemy in late 1922. He later wrote, &quot;To be a Christian meant for me to free myself from ancestral customs, to become a brother of humanity&quot;. At Saint Paul he learned French, the catechism, and agricultural labour. By mid-1924 Boganda had completed his primary education and had indicated his desire to become a priest. In November he was sent to the Jesuit &quot;petit séminaire&quot; in Lemfu, Belgian Congo. The school&#x27;s curriculum included Latin, French, mathematics, history, and philosophy and was scheduled to take six years to complete, though Boganda had left by 1928/1929. After failing to enroll in a school in France due to lack of money, he entered the Spiritian &quot;petit séminaire&quot; in Brazzaville. He spent his final year of studies in Bangui, where he was tutored by Monsignor Marcel Grandin, the head of the Catholic Church in Oubangui-Chari. Once this was completed, Grandin enrolled Boganda in the Saint Laurent &quot;grand séminaire&quot; in Mvolyé, Yaoundé, French Cameroon, in 1931. The first African student at the school, he learned history, Latin, philosophy, theology, and other subjects.
On 17 March 1938 Boganda was ordained. He was subsequently posted to the new Saint Marcel &quot;petit séminaire&quot; in Bangui as a teacher. In 1939 his bishop denied his request to join the French Army, deeming it necessary for him to remain, as many persons involved with the church had been recalled to the metropole to fight in World War II. He was posted in the Grimari region from 1941 to 1946 to evangelize the resident Banda population. Boganda was enthusiastic about his work and was angered by local resistance to some of his teachings and practices. This especially included his efforts which contravened local cultural norms, such as his encouragement to abandon polygamy and fetishism and work to enroll girls in school. His response to such hesitation sometimes included violence, and he was accused of beating people and once suggesting a recalcitrant chief be shot with a cartridge of salt. Despite this, he showed a measure of appreciation for some indigenous culture, and was particularly proud that some locals fearfully dubbed him &quot;mourou&quot;, or leopard, a traditional symbol of power and violence. Boganda believed that the church was providing him with insufficient support and, by the mid-1940s, was in conflict with the local government administrator and felt he was facing racial discrimination from colonial officials, settlers, and some missionaries. Further strain on his position was incurred when he fathered a child in the Bakala region, an action his missionary colleagues saw as scandalous. As a result of these tensions, in 1946 Boganda was transferred to a mission at Bangassou.

== Political career ==
=== National Assembly of France ===
After World War II, Boganda was urged by Grandin to involve himself in politics. In particular, Grandin hoped he would seek election to the National Assembly of France. Some Oubanguians had already indicated that they would support Boganda if he contested a seat in the assembly, and Grandin hoped that Boganda could preserve the interests of the Catholic Church from the local growth of Protestantism and increasing leftist and anti-colonial thought in both France and its colonies. Boganda decided to compete, and on 10 November 1946, he was elected deputy for Oubangui-Chari, becoming the first native Oubanguian to join the assembly after winning 10,846 votes—almost half of the total votes cast—and defeating three other candidates, including the incumbent, François Joseph Reste, who had formerly served as the Governor-General of French Equatorial Africa. Formally, Boganda identified with the Popular Republican Movement (MRP). His election was confirmed on 20 December and he was made a member of the Assembly&#x27;s Overseas Territories Commission and the Supply Commission. He arrived in Paris attired in his clerical garb and introduced himself to his fellow legislators as the son of a polygamous cannibal, probably in a deliberate attempt to project a personal aura of omnipotence. Grandin sought to maintain influence over his former pupil and had requested that the Spiritans in France welcome him, provide lodging, and introduce him to Catholic politicians and keep him away from left-leaning groups. They did not do this, and Boganda expressed disappointment at the lack of a reception upon his arrival and the weak support from French deputies for his proposals to help his constituents in Oubangui-Chari.

Boganda left the MRP in 1950 and served as an independent thereafter. He was reelected to the National Assembly in 1951 and 1956. He made only two parliamentary interventions during his tenure, in August 1947 on the abuses of colonialism and in June 1950 on the lack of social justice in French Equatorial Africa. After 1956, he largely stopped attending the Paris parliament, though he remained a deputy until 1958. Frustrated by the faults of colonial rule in Oubangui-Chari and an unwillingness on the part of local officials to accept reforms, he quickly resorted to vocal criticism of French administration in the colony. He paid particular attention to racism and highlighted incidents of settler violence against black Africans to boost his own political following. Among his complaints were instances of arbitrary arrest, low wages, compulsory cotton cultivation, and the barring of blacks from restaurants and cinemas. In April 1947, Grandin complained to the governor of Oubangui-Chari that Boganda had &quot;escaped from his cage&quot; and was &quot;flying like an idiot&quot;. While his rhetoric was anti-colonial, Boganda nominally supported French political ideals and did not oppose continuing connections between France and Oubangui-Chari. He also identified as a staunch anti-communist and accused colonial administrators of being &quot;anti-French&quot; and &quot;worthy sons of Stalin&quot;, making it difficult for them to criticise him. He proposed several measures aimed at reforming communal land ownership and ensuring the prohibition of forced labour, but his serious attacks on French colonial policy upset the other deputies and as a result his ideas were never incorporated into the parliamentary agenda.

=== Political organising in Oubangui-Chari ===
Feeling as though his actions in the National Assembly were engendering little substantive change in Oubangui-Chari, Boganda grew disenchanted with parliamentary politics and decided to seek direct political action within the territory. In an attempt to improve Oubanguian farmers&#x27; incomes, spur colonial reform, and form a political organisation for himself, in 1948 he launched a co-operative project, the Société Coopérative Oubangui, Lobaye, Lesse (SOCOULOLE), which aimed to provide food, clothing, lodging, medical care, and education. Boganda hastily established the organization without regard for the competence of its staff or the standards of trading goods, though he made sure to include communal healers in its management. Initially operating with a French subsidy, over time the co-operative became embroiled with allegations of financial improprieties and ran low on money. Boganda attempted to fund it with his parliamentary salary, but its deficits rapidly increased.

On 28 September 1949, at Bangui, Boganda established the Movement for the Social Evolution of Black Africa (MESAN), a mass political party. He wrote its founding code, which stipulated that the organisation sought &quot;to develop and liberate the black race by progressive and pacific evolution, achieved by the combined efforts of all negroes throughout the world&quot;. Politically, the party supported liberty and equality for Africans, while economically it endorsed the use of co-operative ventures. Framing his political programme as a matter of fundamental rights, Boganda coined the Sango phrase &quot;zo kwe zo&quot;, which translated to &quot;every human being is a person&quot;. He praised &quot;peasant virtues&quot; and the rustic life before colonialism, and these messages resonated with rural farmers. Furthermore, Oubanguians appreciated his willingness to angrily confront colonial officials. Boganda deliberately strived to instill his rhetoric with a sense of religiosity and mysticism, and he frequently used Latin in his speeches. Rumours began to circulate of his supposed invulnerability and supernatural powers, and at one point later in his career a large crowd waited on the shore of the Ubangi River to see him walk over the water (he did not appear).

MESAN&#x27;s activities angered the French administration and the companies trading in cotton, coffee, diamonds, and other commodities. The Bangui Chamber of Commerce was controlled by these companies, and its members resented the end of forced labour and the resultant rise of black nationalism. They despised Boganda, viewing him as a dangerous revolutionary demagogue and a threat to their &quot;free enterprise&quot;, and they resolved to get rid of him. French colonists and administrators established local Gaullist Rally of the French People (RPF) branches to counter MESAN. Drawing on the support of government workers, clerks, and Free French veterans of World War II, the party sought to take credit for colonial reforms, but failed to generate popular traction. The presence of the African Democratic Rally (RDA) in the other three territories of French Equatorial Africa posed some threat to MESAN, but they were eventually reduced to minor groups.

Boganda was not particularly concerned with his religious mission once he entered politics, but he used the enormous popular respect for the Catholic Church to his advantage, manipulating religious symbols for political purposes. Boganda&#x27;s attachment to the clergy weakened when he met and fell in love with a young Frenchwoman, Michelle Jourdain, who was employed as a parliamentary secretary. By 1949 they were cohabitating and Boganda wrote a letter to his Catholic superiors, pointing out that clerical celibacy was a rule created by the Catholic Church and had no biblical basis. On 25 November he was expelled from the priesthood. Despite this, Boganda remained a devout Catholic and sympathetic to missionary interests. The couple was married on 13 June 1950, and would later have two daughters and a son.

On 10 January 1951, SOCOULOLE agents in the village of Bokanga became involved in a heated dispute with local Portuguese merchants, with the former objecting to the latter&#x27;s practice of forming a coalition amongst themselves. The co-operative agents insisted that the village market be closed until Boganda could arrive to represent their case. By the time he arrived, SOCOULOLE members had blocked the roads leading out of the locale with trees to prevent the merchants&#x27; trucks from leaving. Fearing a loss of law and order, the head of the district of Mbaïki arrested Boganda (along with his accompanying wife) and held him in detention for two days. He was charged with &quot;endangering the peace&quot; and on 29 March the local court sentenced him to two months in prison (his wife was condemned to two weeks incarceration for aiding him). Since he was arrested &quot;in flagrante delicto&quot;, his parliamentary immunity offered him no protection. Boganda terminated SOCOULOLE later that year due to financial difficulties. Boganda&#x27;s arrest occurred five months before the next round of French National Assembly elections, and he framed it as a campaign issue. He ultimately won re-election, defeating challengers from the RPF and RDA, and the colonial administration acceded to his return to office.

=== Co-operation with the French ===
In 1952, the French government appointed more reform-oriented officials in French Equatorial Africa, allowing for a relaxation in tensions between Boganda and the local administration. In March 1953 RPF leader Charles de Gaulle visited Bangui. Boganda refused to see him due to his leadership of the party, but de Gaulle refrained from taking a public stance on the politics in Oubangui-Chari, a move which was interpreted as an expression of disapproval of the local RPF&#x27;s tactics.

On 30 April 1954, disorder erupted in Berbérati when news emerged that two Africans who worked for a European—who was known for his abusive treatment of the locals—had died. The families of the deceased demanded the European&#x27;s arrest, and a crowd gathered in the town and began rioting and assaulting public officials. Once word reached Brazzaville, the colonial authorities began mobilising troops to march on Berbérati, and Oubangui-Chari Governor Louis Sanmarco pleaded with Boganda to accompany him to the locale and intervene. The following day Boganda appeared before the crowd and told them that &quot;the same justice would be administered to white as to black&quot;. Thus assured, the crowd dispersed and order was restored. The riot deeply worried the administration, which acknowledged in its own reports that Europeans&#x27; racism towards Africans was pervasive in the territory.

No substantial violence succeeded the Berbérati riot, and in the following months the RPF increasingly struggled as MESAN continued to grow. Boganda praised the educational and health work done by the colonial administration before the French National Assembly, saying &quot;doctors, administrators, and colonists are our friends [...] We are not as ungrateful as we are black. We know how much has been done for our country&quot;. Addressing the Grand Council of French Equatorial Africa, he complimented Sanmarco and declared, &quot;Oubangui-Chari has embarked on a positive undertaking at last, after years of negative grievances and sterile struggles, and a better future is ahead&quot;. With the assistance of the colonial administration, Boganda established his own coffee plantation and encouraged rural residents to follow suit if possible. Meanwhile, district councils were established, and he attended their meetings in Boda and Mbaïki, urging the MESAN members to collaborate with the European district heads.

=== Internal autonomy and MESAN government ===
In June 1956 the French National Assembly passed the &quot;Loi-cadre Defferre&quot;, an act which conceded a measure of internal autonomy to French colonies. The Europeans in Oubangui-Chari politically organised themselves to seize control of the new local institutions, particularly the office of Mayor of Bangui. René Naud—the European president of the Bangui Chamber of Commerce—and other white merchants offered themselves as candidates in the November election, but Boganda entered the race and quickly became the favourite to win. On 18 November he won the election and became the first Mayor of Bangui.
On 4 February 1957, in accordance with the &quot;loi-cadre&quot;, the French government formally decreed the semi-autonomous status of each of the four territories of French Equatorial Africa, including Oubangui-Chari. Collectively, the four territories constituted a federation led by a General High Commissioner with the assistance of a Grand Council. Within Oubangui-Chari, the former French governor became the High Commissioner, who was to preside over a Council of Government, with its members to be chosen by the newly created Territorial Assembly. On 31 March, MESAN won all seats in the Assembly and, at Boganda&#x27;s request, Hector Rivierez was elected its presiding officer. He also arranged for Abel Goumba, the territory&#x27;s only African doctor and a former catechism student of his, to become Vice President of the Council of Government. The council was installed on 17 May without Boganda as a member, since he did not want to participate in a government presided over by a French commissioner, and was also increasingly concerned with political organising at a federal level. Instead, he became President of the Grand Council.

The only European minister in the Council of Government was Roger Guérillot, who had previously secured the confidence of Boganda and worked as MESAN&#x27;s treasurer. He was given charge of the portfolio for economic and administrative affairs. Guérillot sought to increase Africanisation of the administration, since there was a lack of trained Oubanguians and such a change would weaken the government and strengthen the position of the French colonists. He encouraged Boganda to go on a rhetorical offensive against French officials, whom he dubbed &quot;the saboteurs of the &quot;loi-cadre&quot;&quot;. In a speech before the Territorial Assembly, Boganda suggested that the French administrators should leave and Oubanguians could &quot;curse their shameful memory for ever&quot;, but also noted that it would take several years to train African personnel to replace them. He softened his stance a few days later while addressing the Grand Council, suggesting the colonies needed &quot;a new form of administration&quot; and proposing the transformation of districts into &quot;rural communities&quot; with trusted officials from the existing bureaucracy serving as directors of each.

In the mid-1950s a Bangui study group had proposed the construction of a rail line from Bangui to Chad. This was both to secure Oubangui-Chari&#x27;s commercial relations with southern Chad—which was facing strain due to competition from Cameroon—and to satisfy private firms that sought a large state contract to make up for the decline in foreign investment driven by uncertainties in the territory&#x27;s political future. Boganda believed that it would only be reasonable to embark on the railway project if Oubanguian economic output was greatly increased, so he requested that Guérillot draw up a programme for improving production and raising the standard of living.

Guérillot proposed a large scheme totaling four billion Central African CFA francs in expenditures to greatly increase the cultivation of coffee trees, cotton, and ground-nuts. As a part of this, he conceived a Committee of Economic Safety, which would consist of more regional bodies of European merchants and MESAN officials who would oversee peasants&#x27; production efforts. On 30 December, Boganda praised the committee as &quot;the union of capital and Oubanguian labour&quot; and convinced the Territorial Assembly to allow Guérillot to proceed. French colonists found the project risky and did not invest in it, and were followed in their abstention by banks and French economic aid organizations. Goumba also thought the proposal demanded too much of peasants and began formulating his own economic platform. Meanwhile, Guérillot recruited unemployed whites in Bangui as &quot;inspectors&quot; with African auxiliaries to directly manage cultivation. Peasants regarded the scheme as a return to the concessionary system and began publicly protesting it. Facing skepticism in the press and a measure of isolation for earlier excluding Antoine Darlan—Oubangui-Chari&#x27;s representative to the French Union—from MESAN, Boganda traveled throughout the territory to try to allay peasants&#x27; fears and exhort them to work. He stressed that increased agricultural production was the only way for Oubangui-Chari to become economically viable without French aid. Angered by public criticism, he proposed banning all political activity. The economic scheme ultimately failed to achieve its goals and damaged Boganda&#x27;s reputation, as well as tarnishing the view of the Council of Government both domestically and in the French and Belgian governments.

=== De Gaulle and the French Community ===
Following the failure of the Algiers putsch in May 1958, de Gaulle reassumed power in France as Prime Minister and prepared to draft a new French constitution, stressing the importance of re-examining a federal relationship between France and its colonies. Boganda was not included in the new constitutional commission, to his dismay. De Gaulle hosted him in Paris in July, and upon his return to Oubangui-Chari he expressed to the Territorial Assembly that the &quot;loi-cadre&quot; was insufficient for the territory and the rest of Sub-Saharan Africa. He told the body he wanted assurance of &quot;the people&#x27;s right to self-determination and a voluntary freely-consented independence. The ways of introducing it are to be examined&quot;. The Assembly passed a motion repeating Boganda&#x27;s demands.

De Gaulle proposed the creation of a new federal French Community that would encompass the African colonies. Boganda opposed Oubangui-Chari joining the community, fearing it would forestall independence. In August a meeting was held in Brazzaville between de Gaulle and political leaders in French Equatorial Africa. Boganda presented a petition signed by the leaders which requested that the new French constitution recognise the right of its colonies to declare independence. De Gaulle assured him that Oubangui-Chari&#x27;s membership in the community would not preclude it from securing independence at a later time. A referendum was to be held in each colony in order to determine its support for the new constitution and joining the community; de Gaulle warned that while a negative vote would grant a territory immediate independence, it would also lead to the termination of all French aid. On 30 August Boganda told MESAN leaders he supported an affirmative vote in favour of the constitution, and he subsequently traveled around Oubangui-Chari to tell the people that the French would remain slightly longer &quot;to set right the ravages of colonisation&quot;. The referendum was held on 28 September and 98% of voters chose to support the new constitution.

=== Regional unity and the United States of Latin Africa ===
While the French constitution had placed political responsibility upon each territorial assembly in Africa and expected them to ratify the results of their referendums, it left open the possibility of federations. Boganda had been worried about balkanisation in Africa for some time, and believed that independence of Oubangui-Chari as a single state would be disastrous. He used his position as President of the Grand Council to encourage the formation of a united state in Central Africa. He wrote a tract which stated, &quot;A united state with a united government and united parliament would reduce our expenses considerably. We could restrict the administrative budget and devote more of our resources to developing the welfare of our countries, so that all citizens would benefit, not just one privileged category. It is obvious that such an arrangement would encourage investment&quot;.

Boganda articulated a new framework for the states of French Equatorial Africa whereby there would be a central government and legislature. There would be an annually rotating presidency in which each former territory would take turns supplying the officeholder. The territories would become departments under the supervision of ministers of state and be divided into urban sections and rural communes. Due to the geographic span of such a federation—which would include Oubangui-Chari, Congo, Gabon, and Chad—he proposed that the state would be known as the &quot;Central African Republic&quot;. He stressed the urgency of accomplishing this as quickly as possible, saying, &quot;The Central African Republic must be built today, for tomorrow it will be too late [...] Chad and Oubangui-Chari will surely be solicited by other voices and other means&quot;. In a speech, Boganda revealed he envisioned the Central African Republic as a step in creating a larger United States of Latin Africa:

Next we have to examine the question of the right bank of the Congo [river]. Since the official historical frontier is the Congo and not the Oubangui [river], we must regard that area from now on as belonging to the Central African Republic. Thirdly, we must work towards re-uniting the two Congos. The fourth stage will be to create the United States of Latin Africa, including the Central African Republic, the so-called Belgian Congo, Ruanda-Urundi, Angola, and Cameroon.

Boganda dispatched Rivierez and David Dacko to Gabon, Chad, and the Congo to explore their interest in a united state. The two were unable to secure a meeting with authorities in Gabon, while Chadian leaders rejected the idea. Jacques Opangault, the leader of the government in the Congo, was enthusiastic about the proposal, but his majority in the Congolese legislature was slim and his position weak. Gabon was the richest of the states, and its refusal to engage with the proposal made the French hesitant to sanction the federation. In late November the French High Commissioner convened a meeting of the equatorial leaders in Brazzaville and told them that each territorial assembly was to independently ratify its referendums and finalise its decision to adhere to the new constitution. By 28 November, all the other territories had decided to join the French Community as separate entities. Disheartened, Boganda resigned himself to proclaiming only Oubangui-Chari as the Central African Republic on 1 December.

=== Central African Republic ===
The Central African Republic adopted a design drawn up by Boganda for its flag, including a star, the French tricolour, and colors of other African flags. He also penned the lyrics for the national anthem, &quot;La Renaissance&quot;. On 6 December, the CAR&#x27;s first government was established with Boganda as President of the Council of Government (premier), though a French High Commissioner was retained. Frustrated with Guérillot&#x27;s economic failures and political maneuverings to be elected to the French Senate, he sent Guérillot to France as a diplomat and replaced him at the Ministry of Interior and Economic Affairs with Dacko. He made several other changes to the composition of the original council, but retained Goumba as Minister of State and &quot;de facto&quot; vice president of the council.

The new government&#x27;s first action was to adopt a law banning nudity and vagrancy. Its main objective, however, was to draw up a constitution. Democratic in nature, the document provided for a unicameral parliament with a five-year term and a prime minister for the same period. The text was largely borrowed from the French constitution, though Boganda had some influence over the wording of the preamble and pushed for the inclusion of a provision that allowed the country to cede its sovereignty to a wider union. The draft was approved by the assembly on 16 February 1959. Boganda then set about creating extensive administrative reforms, including the establishment of rural and urban municipalities, the creation of district councils with broad authority, and the institution of mutual development societies. The government also drafted new electoral constituencies and scheduled elections for the Legislative Assembly on 5 April. Boganda personally oversaw the selection of MESAN&#x27;s candidates and agreed to include five Frenchmen on its lists. The government also created a new electoral law which stipulated that civil servants could not run for office unless they had been on leave of absence for at least six months prior to the polling date. Furthermore, the law required all parties to nominate their candidates in lists instead of individually, and if one candidate was disqualified, the whole list would be dismissed. As a result, all opposition lists were thrown out by the courts, leaving MESAN unopposed. Opposition politicians were infuriated, and when asked about the impending lack of a parliamentary opposition, Boganda told the press, &quot;We will create our own opposition within our party&quot;.

==Death==
=== Plane crash ===
On 29 March 1959 Boganda boarded a Nord Noratlas plane at Berbérati, where he had been campaigning, for a flight to Bangui. The plane was owned by Union Aéromaritime de Transport, which transported the mail between the two cities. The plane went missing, and its wreckage was discovered the following day in the district of Boda. All four crew and five passengers, including the government&#x27;s information chief and a member of the Assembly, were found dead. Boganda&#x27;s body was recovered from the pilot&#x27;s cabin.

The French General Secretariat of Civil Aviation ordered an inquiry and sent a team to investigate the crash site. A report was never published, but shortly afterwards the Paris weekly &quot;L&#x27;Express&quot; revealed that investigators had identified traces of explosive in the wreckage. The French High Commissioner ordered all copies of the reporting edition suppressed in the Central African Republic. No cause for the crash has ever been definitively determined. Many Central Africans believed that the crash was an assassination; in particular, many suspected that expatriate businessmen from the Bangui Chamber of Commerce, possibly aided by the French secret service, played a role. Michelle Jourdain was also suspected of being involved; by 1959, relations between Boganda and his wife had deteriorated, and he thought of leaving her and returning to the priesthood. She had a large insurance policy on his life, taken out just days before the accident. Historian Gérard Prunier wrote that &quot;the probability of foul play was very high&quot;, noting, &quot;The whites who worked for what was left of the Grandes Compagnies Concessionaires hated Boganda, who had been instrumental in finally getting compulsory labor outlawed in 1946. They also hated his intelligence, which was unsettling to their view of black inferiority&quot;.

=== Political consequences ===

Aside from some minor disorder in Mbaïki, the country received Boganda&#x27;s death in relative calm. Some of his followers suggested that he had not died and would return to the public in the future. His funeral was held on 3 April outside of the Notre-Dame Cathedral in Bangui and attended by thousands, with Robert Lecourt representing the French government and Raymond Janot representing the French Community. Charles Féraille, a priest who had been personally acquainted with Boganda, declared that he had been &quot;chosen by God&quot; to lead the country. Goumba replaced him as interim President of the Council of Government, while Étienne Ngounio took over the office of Mayor of Bangui and the MESAN party presidency. Boganda&#x27;s parliamentary constituency was declared vacant in the elections held on 5 April, which were handily won by MESAN, though with a sharp drop in voter turnout. With its founder gone, MESAN substantively ceased to exist aside as a label.

Dacko, with the backing of the French High Commissioner, the Bangui Chamber of Commerce, and Jourdain, offered himself as a candidate to lead the Council of Government. Goumba was hesitant to divide the populace, and after a month in power conceded the presidency to Dacko. Dacko became consumed with administrative work and, though he had initially retained Goumba as Minister of State, dismissed him after several months. In 1960 Goumba founded a new political party, the Democratic Evolution Movement of Central Africa (MEDAC), and claimed it carried the ideals of Boganda and MESAN. Frightened by its rapid growth, Dacko declared his intent to revive MESAN. Under his government, political focus moved away from the peasantry and was drawn to the creation of a new moneyed elite, mostly favouring officials who received large salaries. The Central African Republic received its full independence from France on 13 August 1960. Dacko pushed several measures through the Assembly which invested him as President of the Republic and head of state, and gave the government wide authority to suppress political opposition. By 1962 he had arrested Goumba and declared MESAN the sole party of the state.

==Legacy==
=== Commemoration and political legacy ===
The Legislative Assembly declared Boganda the &quot;Father of the Nation&quot; in June 1959. He was posthumously awarded Knight of the Legion of Honour, Grand Cross of the Order of Central African Merit, and Commander of the Order of Agricultural Merit. The Boganda National Museum, named for the former premier and hosted in his former Bangui residence, was opened in 1966. A secondary school and an avenue were also named in his honour, while a statue of him was erected at an independence memorial in the capital. Jean-Bédel Bokassa, leader of the Central African Republic between 1966 and 1979, promoted a cult of personality for Boganda as the founder of MESAN and the republic. Boganda Day is observed annually on 29 March to commemorate his death.

Mythical perceptions of Boganda&#x27;s invulnerability persisted after his death, and his presence in Central African collective memory remains politically potent, serving as a unifying element among both the country&#x27;s elite and the general populace. His phrase, &quot;zo kwe zo&quot;, was incorporated into the state&#x27;s coat of arms. The preamble of the republic&#x27;s 2004 constitution read, in part: &quot;Animated by the wish of assuring to man his dignity with respect to the principle of &#x27;ZO KWE ZO&#x27; enunciated by the Founder of the Central African Republic Barthélemy BOGANDA&quot;. Despite this, his political ideas have generally not been studied by successive Central African leaders. Historian Klaas van Walraven wrote, &quot;his contemporary significance may lie precisely in the memory of his comportment and the widespread ignorance of his ideas&quot;.

=== Historiography ===
Historian Georges Chaffard described Boganda as &quot;the most prestigious and the most capable of Equatorial political men&quot;, while Prunier called him &quot;probably the most gifted and most inventive of French Africa&#x27;s decolonization generation of politicians&quot;. Historian Brian Titley suggested that Boganda&#x27;s death &quot;robbed the country of a charismatic leader&quot; able to maintain legitimacy and in the long term facilitated General Bokassa&#x27;s overthrow of Dacko and subsequent military takeover in 1966.

Boganda&#x27;s life has some presence in French language histography, but much of what has been written about his biographical details, especially by Central African authors, is hagiographic in nature. His ideas and speeches have been more thoroughly incorporated into general analyses of political philosophies. Boganda is rarely mentioned in English historiography, and where he is included it is generally within the context of his Pan-African project of the United States of Latin Africa.

<text>Roberto Francisco Ávila González (April 2, 1924 – October 26, 2004), known as &quot;Beto&quot; in Mexico and as &quot;Bobby&quot; in the United States, was a Mexican professional baseball second baseman.

A native of Veracruz, Mexico, Ávila began his career playing for the Puebla Angeles of the Mexican League from 1943 to 1947. He played 10 seasons in Major League Baseball for the Cleveland Indians from 1949 to 1958 before dividing the 1959 season between the Baltimore Orioles, Boston Red Sox, and Milwaukee Braves.

Ávila won the 1954 American League batting championship with a .341 batting average. He also received &quot;The Sporting News&quot; American League Player of the Year award in 1954 and was named to the American League All-Star team in 1952, 1954, and 1955.

After retiring as a player, Ávila owned a Mexican baseball team and became president of the Mexican League. He became mayor of Veracruz in 1980 and later served two terms in the Mexican national legislature. He was inducted into the Mexican Professional Baseball Hall of Fame in 1971 and the Latino Baseball Hall of Fame in 2010.

==Early years==
Ávila was born in 1924 in Veracruz, Mexico, to Maria Gonzalez and Jorge Ávila.

Ávila played baseball and soccer as a youth. He began playing professional soccer as a teenager. He then switched to baseball, playing for the semi-professional Cordoba club. He began as a pitcher, but later converted to second base.

==Professional baseball player==
===Mexican League (1943–1947)===
Ávila began his baseball professional baseball career at age 19 with the Puebla Angeles of the Mexican League. He played for Puebla from 1943 to 1947. In 1947, he led the Mexican League with a .346 batting average.

===Initial seasons in US (1948–1950)===
The Cleveland Indians signed Avila in 1948 for a $17,500 bonus and assigned him to the Baltimore Orioles, the Indians&#x27; farm team in the International League. He missed two months during the 1948 season after undergoing surgery for a hernia. He appeared in 56 games for the Orioles and compiled a .220 batting average.

In September 1948, the Orioles sold Ávila to the Cleveland Indians. He made his major league debut on April 30, 1949, but with Hall of Famer Joe Gordon starting 145 games as the Indians&#x27; second baseman, Ávila appeared in only 31 games and had only 14 at bats during the 1949 season.

An injury to Joe Gordon finally gave Ávila the opportunity to play during the 1950 season. He appeared 80 games, 52 as the Indians&#x27; starting second baseman. He compiled a .299 batting average and a .390 on-base percentage.

===Peak years (1951–1955)===
In 1951, Ávila began a string of five consecutive seasons in which he started at least 135 games as the Indians&#x27; second baseman. During those five seasons, which were the peak of Ávila&#x27;s career, he appeared in 716 games and compiled a .301 batting average, .374 on-base percentage, and 839 hits.

In 1952, Ávila appeared in a career-high 150 games and ranked among the American League leaders with 11 triples (first), 28 errors (first), 179 hits (second), 19 sacrifice hits (second), 431 assists (third), and a .300 batting average (eighth). He was also selected as the American League&#x27;s starting second baseman for the 1952 Major League Baseball All-Star Game. He had one hit and an RBI in two at bats in the All-Star Game.

In 1953, Ávila had one of his best defensive seasons. He led American League second basemen in fielding percentage (.986), assists (445), and range factor per nine innings (5.86).

In 1954, Ávila had the best season of his career despite breaking his right thumb on June 2 when Hank Bauer slid into him at second base. His batting average, which stood at .392 at the time of the injury, fell precipitously after the injury but then rebounded. He ended the season with career highs in batting average (.341), on-base percentage (.402), home runs (15), RBIs (67), and runs (112). He won the American League batting championship and received &quot;The Sporting News&quot; Player of the Year award.

The 1954 Cleveland team, loaded with talent that included Ávila, Bob Lemon, Larry Doby, and Al Rosen, won 111 games and the American League pennant. The 1954 World Series matched the two leagues&#x27; batting champions, Ávila and Willie Mays. Ávila had only two hits in 15 at bats during the World Series.

Ávila was selected as an All-Star for a second time in 1954 and for a third time in 1955. In the 1954 All-Star Game, he had three hits in three at bats, scored a run, and had two RBIs. Ávila was the first Mexican-born player to play in an All-Star Game and the first to win a batting championship.

===Final years as a player (1956–1960)===
Ávila&#x27;s offensive production declined after the 1955 season. His batting average fell in his final three years in Cleveland to .224, .268, and .253 respectively. In 1957, Harry Grayson wrote a syndicated column on &quot;The Sudden Fall of Bobby Avila&quot;, a matter that was &quot;a national calamity in Mexico.&quot; Cleveland manager Kerby Farrell observed: &quot;They just pitch Avila close to the hands and nothing happens. The ball no longer travels when he hits it.&quot;

In his final season in the major leagues, he played for three different teams. He was traded by the Indians on December 2, 1958, to the Baltimore Orioles in exchange for Russ Heman and $30,000. He was shifted to right field by the Orioles, starting nine games at the position. He compiled a .170 batting average in 47 at bats.

On May 21, 1959, the Orioles sold Ávila to the Boston Red Sox. He returned to second base and hit .244 in 45 at bats for Boston.

On July 21, 1959, the Red Sox sold Ávila to the Milwaukee Braves. In his first game for the Braves, he hit a two-run home run in the ninth inning for a Milwaukee victory. He started 45 games at second base for the Braves and hit .238 in 172 at bats.

Dealt three times in the last season of his career, Ávila returned to Mexico for the 1960 season. In his final season as a professional baseball player, he played for the Mexico City Tigers, compiled a .333 batting average and set a Mexican League record with 124 walks.

===Career statistics===

In 11 major league seasons, Ávila compiled a .281 batting average and a .359 on-base percentage with 1,296 hits, 80 home runs, 467 RBIs, 725 runs, 185 doubles, 35 triples, and 78 stolen bases in 1,300 games.


==Later years and legacy==
As the first Mexican-born player to have success in Major League Baseball, Ávila became a national hero in Mexico. Fernando Valenzuela said: &quot;Everyone knows who Avila was in Mexico. He was an inspiration, of course, for Mexican ballplayers to follow to the States and play in the major leagues.&quot; Hall of Fame broadcaster called Ávila &quot;a tremendous source of pride for the Mexican ballplayers.&quot; 

The Estadio Universitario Beto Ávila in Veracruz, and the Estadio de Béisbol Beto Ávila in Cancun were named in his honor.

After retiring from baseball, Ávila purchased the Veracruz Eagles and later became president of the Mexican League.

In 1971, he was inducted into the Mexican Professional Baseball Hall of Fame.

In 1980, Ávila was elected as the mayor of his home city of Veracruz. He later served two three-year terms in the Mexican national legislature.

In 1999, &quot;The Sporting News&quot; chose Ávila as the second baseman on its All-Star Latin American team.

In 2004, Ávila died at age 80 in Veracruz. The cause of death was complications from diabetes and a lung ailment.

In 2010, Ávila was posthumously inducted in the Latino Baseball Hall of Fame.

In 2020, Ávila was selected as the starting second baseman on the Mexican League Historic Ideal Team by a committee of baseball journalists and historians.

<doc id="843920" wikidata="Q415302" url="?curid=843920" title="Cyclobutadiene">
<text>Cyclobutadiene is an organic compound with the formula . It is very reactive owing to its tendency to dimerize. Although the parent compound has not been isolated, some substituted derivatives are robust and a single molecule of cyclobutadiene is quite stable. Since the compound degrades by a bimolecular process, the species can be observed by matrix isolation techniques at temperatures below 35 K. It is thought to adopt a rectangular structure.

==Structure and reactivity==
The compound is the prototypical antiaromatic hydrocarbon with 4 pi electrons (or π electrons). It is the smallest [&quot;n&quot;]-annulene ([4]-annulene). Its rectangular structure is the result of a pseudo- (or second order) Jahn–Teller effect, which distorts the molecule and lowers its symmetry, converting the triplet to a singlet ground state. The electronic states of cyclobutadiene have been explored with a variety of computational methods. The rectangular structure is consistent with the existence of two different 1,2-dideutero-1,3-cyclobutadiene valence isomers. This distortion indicates that the pi electrons are localized, in agreement with Hückel&#x27;s rule which predicts that a π-system of 4 electrons is not aromatic.

In principle, another situation is possible. Namely, cyclobutadiene could assume an undistorted square geometry, &quot;if it&quot; &quot;adopts a triplet spin state&quot;. While a theoretical possibility, the triplet form of the parent cyclobutadiene and its substituted derivatives remained elusive for decades. However, in 2017, the square triplet excited state of 1,2,3,4-tetrakis(trimethylsilyl)-1,3-cyclobutadiene was observed spectroscopically, and a singlet-triplet gap of &quot;E&quot;ST = 13.9 kcal/mol (or 0.6 eV per molecule) was measured for this compound.

==Synthesis==
Several cyclobutadiene derivatives have been isolated with steric bulky substituents. Orange tetrakis (&quot;tert&quot;-butyl)cyclobutadiene arises by thermolysis of its isomer tetra-&quot;tert&quot;-butyltetrahedrane. Although the cyclobutadiene derivative is stable (with respect to dimerization), it decomposes upon contact with .

==Trapping==
Samples of cyclobutadiene are unstable since the compound dimerizes at temperatures above 35 K by a Diels-Alder reaction. By suppressing bimolecular decomposition pathways, cyclobutadiene is well-behaved. Thus it has been generated in a hemicarceplex. The inclusion compound is generated by photodecarboxylation of bicyclopyran-2-one. When released from the host–guest complex, cyclobutadiene dimerizes and then converts to cyclooctatetraene.

After numerous attempts, cyclobutadiene was first generated by oxidative degradation of cyclobutadieneiron tricarbonyl with ammonium cerium(IV) nitrate. When liberated from the iron complex, cyclobutadiene reacts with electron-deficient alkynes to form a Dewar benzene:
The Dewar benzene converts to dimethyl phthalate on heating at 90 °C.

One cyclobutadiene derivative is also accessible through a [2+2]cycloaddition of a di-alkyne. In this particular reaction, the trapping reagent is &quot;2,3,4,5-tetraphenylcyclopenta-2,4-dienone&quot; and one of the final products (after expulsion of carbon monoxide) is a cyclooctatetraene:

<doc id="843942" wikidata="Q1248656" url="?curid=843942" title="Marcus Welby, M.D.">
<text>Marcus Welby, M.D. is an American medical drama television series that aired on ABC from September 23, 1969, to May 4, 1976. It starred Robert Young as the title character, a family practitioner with a kind bedside manner, who made house calls and was on a first-name basis with many of his patients; James Brolin as his partner Steven Kiley, a younger doctor; and Elena Verdugo as Consuelo Lopez, Welby and Kiley&#x27;s dedicated and caring nurse/office manager.

&quot;Marcus Welby, M.D.&quot; was produced by David Victor and David J. O&#x27;Connell through Universal Television, which was then an MCA company. The pilot, titled &quot;A Matter of Humanities&quot;, had aired as an &quot;ABC Movie of the Week&quot; on March 26, 1969.

==Overview==
As with most medical dramas of the day, the plots often concerned a professional conflict between well-meaning physicians. Here, Welby&#x27;s unorthodox way of treating patients was pitted against the more straight-laced methods of Kiley (Brolin). The catch with this particular program was that the roles were reversed in that Kiley was much younger than Welby. The opening credits of each episode reminded viewers of the generation gap between the two doctors, Welby driving his sedan and Kiley riding a motorcycle. Welby had served in the US Navy as a doctor during the war, and was a widower.

The doctors worked alongside each other in their private practice in Santa Monica, California, regularly working in conjunction with the nearby Lang Memorial Hospital. (This was later revealed in exterior shots to be the real-life Saint John&#x27;s Hospital and Health Center in Santa Monica.) At the office, their loyal secretary-nurse and friend was Consuelo Lopez (Verdugo). Other characters that appeared throughout the series included Dr. Welby&#x27;s frequent girlfriend Myra Sherwood (Anne Baxter), his daughter Sandy (originally Christine Belford, and later Anne Schedeen) and her son Phil (Gavin Brendan), and Kathleen Faverty (Sharon Gless), an assistant program director at the hospital, who worked closely with Welby and Kiley. Kiley met and married public relations director Janet Blake (played by Pamela Hensley) in 1975, at the beginning of the show&#x27;s final season on the air.

In the episode &quot;Designs&quot;, which aired on March 12, 1974, Young was reunited with his &quot;Father Knows Best&quot; co-star, Jane Wyatt; she played a fashion designer whose marriage to an embittered paraplegic led her to fall in love with the doctor while keeping her marriage a secret most of the episode.

==Medical features==

Its handling of many varied medical cases – some common, some uncommon – made it an instant hit for ABC. Story lines included impotence, depression, brain damage, breast cancer, mononucleosis, teenaged obesity, juvenile diabetes, sexually transmitted diseases, epilepsy, learning disabilities, leukemia, haemophilia, paraplegia, dysautonomia, rape, Alzheimer&#x27;s disease, and addiction to painkillers, among others. At its second season (1970–1971), it ranked number one in the Nielsen ratings, becoming the first ABC show to top the list. The same year, both Young and Brolin won Emmy Awards for their work, as did the show for Outstanding Dramatic Series. Young won a Golden Globe in 1972 for his performance. Members of the American Academy of Family Physicians served as technical advisers for the series and reviewed every script for medical accuracy.

==Politics==
The 1973 episode &quot;The Other Martin Loring&quot; was about a middle-aged man whom Welby advised to resist his homosexual impulses. The Gay Activists Alliance (GAA) zapped ABC, occupied its New York headquarters and picketed. The next year, &quot;The Outrage&quot; was a story of a teenaged student who was sexually assaulted by his male teacher, associating homosexuality with pedophilia. Seven sponsors refused to buy television advertising time, and 17 television network affiliates refused to air the episode. This was the first known instance of network affiliates refusing a network episode in response to protests.

In addition, an episode dealing with abortion was refused by San Diego area ABC affiliate XETV, a station licensed to Tijuana across the border in Mexico, due to that country&#x27;s stance on the practice at the time.

==Episodes==


===Crossovers with &quot;Owen Marshall, Counselor at Law&quot;===
During its run, &quot;Marcus Welby, M.D.&quot; had two crossover stories with its legal spin-off series, &quot;Owen Marshall, Counselor at Law&quot;.

In &quot;Men Who Care&quot;, Marshall defends the father of Welby&#x27;s patient when the man is accused of murdering his daughter&#x27;s boyfriend. In &quot;I&#x27;ve Promised You a Father&quot;, Marshall defends Kiley in a paternity suit filed by a nurse claiming that Kiley is the father of her child.

==Nielsen ratings==
It was the first show in ABC&#x27;s history to become the number-one show on television.

==Ending of the series==
By the mid-1970s, the popularity of medical dramas began to wane. Ratings for both &quot;Marcus Welby, M.D.&quot; and CBS&#x27;s &quot;Medical Center&quot; began to drop, as did the ratings for daytime dramas &quot;General Hospital&quot; and &quot;The Doctors&quot;. Previous episodes initially went into syndication in the fall of 1975 as &quot;Robert Young, Family Doctor&quot; (to avoid confusion with the first-run episodes still airing on ABC). The show ended its run in 1976 after 169 episodes were made. On an awards show that year, Young joked publicly, &quot;I knew that it was time to quit when I started taking time off to play golf!&quot;

==Television movies==
In 1984, the reunion movie &quot;The Return of Marcus Welby, M.D.&quot; aired, with Young and Verdugo reprising their roles. The major conflict, aside from interactions with patients, centered around Welby being accused of being too old to retain his medical license safely. Though Brolin was unavailable to reprise his role as Kiley, a statement described as being from him was read before the board that would decide Welby&#x27;s fate. Another movie was made in 1988, &quot;Marcus Welby, M.D.: A Holiday Affair.&quot; This last made-for-television film was the last acting role of Robert Young&#x27;s career.

==Home media==
Shout! Factory (under license from Universal Studios) has released the first two seasons of &quot;Marcus Welby, M.D.&quot; on DVD in Region 1.

Mill Creek Entertainment released a 10-episode best-of set entitled &quot;Marcus Welby, M.D.: The Best of Season One&quot; on March 22, 2011.

<text>Theodora &quot;Dora&quot; Bakoyanni (, ; née Mitsotaki, ; born May 6, 1954) is a Greek politician. From 2006 to 2009 she was Minister of Foreign Affairs of Greece, the highest position ever to have been held by a woman in the Cabinet of Greece at the time; she was also Chairperson-in-Office of the Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe in 2009. Previously she was the Mayor of Athens from 2003 to 2006, the first female mayor in the city&#x27;s history, and the first woman to serve as mayor of a city hosting the Olympic Games. She also served as Minister for Culture of Greece from 1992 to 1993.

Bakoyannis has been serving as an independent member of the Hellenic Parliament representing unofficially Democratic Alliance, the political party she founded in 2010, having been expelled from the opposition New Democracy party due to voting against the party line. In May 2012, due to the critical situation in Greece before the elections and given the established electoral law, Democratic Alliance decided to cooperate with New Democracy, based on a specific framework of values and to suspend its activities. Dora Bakoyannis rejoined New Democracy on 21 May 2012, ahead of the parliamentary election in June, where she headed the state deputies&#x27; ballot.

==Early life and education==
Bakoyannis was born in Athens in 1954 to a prominent Greek family in the field of politics. She is the eldest of four children of the veteran Greek politician Konstantinos Mitsotakis, former Prime Minister of Greece and former leader of country&#x27;s main centre-right political party New Democracy, and Marika Mitsotakis (née Giannoukou). Her family originates from Chania, Crete, and has a long tradition in the politics of Greece. Besides her father and herself, other members of the family include prominent politicians such as her grandfather, Kyriakos, and his brother Aristomenis, while her younger brother Kyriakos, is the current Prime Minister of Greece. She is also a great-granddaughter of Eleftherios Venizelos&#x27; sister. This decade-long involvement has been reprehended as attestation for family-rule in Greek political life.

During her early school years, she attended the German School of Athens. Her family was exiled to Paris by the Greek military junta in 1968, thus she completed her secondary schooling at the German School of Paris. She then studied political science and communication at the Ludwig Maximilian University of Munich without graduating. After the collapse of the junta, she returned to Greece and continued her academic studies in public law at the National and Kapodistrian University of Athens. In addition to Greek, Bakoyannis is fluent in English, French and German.

==Political career==

===Minister for Culture, 1992–1993===
In the November 1989 election, Bakoyannis successfully contested her late husband&#x27;s seat in the Evrytania constituency and was re-elected a member of the Hellenic Parliament in the 1990 election and served as a Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State, following the election of her father as Prime Minister of Greece. From September 1991 to August 1992, she served in the General Secretariat of International Affairs for New Democracy and represented the party at the European Democrat Union and the International Democrat Union. From December 1992, she served as Minister for Culture of Greece until the 1993 election, when she was re-elected a member of Parliament for New Democracy as the main opposition party.

===Years in opposition===
On 29 April 1994, Bakoyannis was elected in the Central Committee of New Democracy by the party&#x27;s Third Congress. In the 1996 election Bakoyannis was a candidate for a first time in the Athens A&#x27; electoral district and was elected again as member of Parliament, coming first of all the candidates in it, something that was repeated in the 2000 election. Meanwhile, on 22 March 1997, she was elected again to the Central Committee of New Democracy by the party&#x27;s Fourth Congress. She also served for two terms as the chairperson of the party&#x27;s Executive Committee later. In September 1997 she was appointed by New Democracy leader Kostas Karamanlis in the party&#x27;s Department for Development and as Shadow Minister of Foreign Affairs and Defence in May 2000.

===Mayor of Athens, 2002–2006===
On 29 March 2002, Bakoyannis was picked to run for Mayor of Athens in the 2002 local elections, both a choice of Kostas Karamanlis who was looking for a way to demonstrate New Democracy&#x27;s growing strength against the ruling Panhellenic Socialist Movement and a chance for Bakoyannis to earn prestige by this office in advance of the city hosting the Olympic games. She was elected what was aired as Athens&#x27; first female mayor in the city&#x27;s 3,500-year history, defeating her socialist opponent Christos Papoutsis and receiving a percentage of 60.6% in the runoff. As mayor, she was heavily involved in the preparation of the 2004 Athens Olympic Games, the first woman to serve as mayor of a city hosting the Olympic Games, and passed the Olympic flag to the mayor of Beijing, Wang Qishan. In 2005 she was awarded the World Mayor Prize.

In 2003, upon the invitation of Romano Prodi, then President of the European Commission, Bakoyannis joined a group of 12 high-level independent figures from Europe, as a member of a prestigious round-table conference, contributing proposals on the social character, cultural identity and economic future of new Europe.

===Minister of Foreign Affairs, 2006–2009===

Bakoyannis left the office of Mayor before the end of her term, replaced by acting mayor Fotini Pipili, to become Minister of Foreign Affairs of Greece on 15 February 2006 and thus the highest-ranking woman in the history of the Cabinet of Greece. She also retained the position after the 2007 election, managing to be elected as a member of the Hellenic Parliament first among all the candidates in the Athens A&#x27; constituency once more. As Minister of Foreign Affairs, Bakoyannis assumed the rotating Greek presidency of the United Nations Security Council in September 2006, while at a time of international tensions over nuclear programs in Iran and North Korea and amidst a fragile United Nations brokered cease-fire in Lebanon.

During her incumbency, she promoted the cooperation in the Balkans, where Greek companies are heavily investing, traveled through the Middle East to help outline solutions to problems and attended meetings of the Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe to discuss developments in the region. She also promoted the ratification of the Treaty of Lisbon by the Hellenic Parliament and supported Nicolas Sarkozy&#x27;s plan about the Union for the Mediterranean, but did not reach a conciliation with Turkey and the Republic of Macedonia over the Cyprus dispute and the Macedonia naming dispute respectively.

===OSCE Chairperson-in-Office===
Bakoyannis served as the Chairperson-in-Office of the Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe from January 2009 to 6 October 2009. As the political leader of the OSCE, she was responsible for the external representation and the appointments of the Organization. She also oversaw the activities of the OSCE in conflict prevention, crisis management and post-conflict rehabilitation. During her chairmanship, she was assisted by her staff and Marc Perrin de Brichambaut, the Secretary General of the OSCE, as well as by her predecessor Alexander Stubb and successor Marat Tazhin, who both formed along with Bakoyannis the OSCE Troika.

==Later political role==
Bakoyannis was expelled from New Democracy on May 7, 2010, on the grounds of having defied New Democracy&#x27;s line and voting &quot;in favor&quot; of a salient piece of legislation introducing the harsh austerity measures that were required for European Union-International Monetary Fund backed lending. She continued to hold her parliamentary seat, originally secured by New Democracy, as an independent. On November 21, 2010, she founded her own political party called the Democratic Alliance.

A member of the Greek delegation to the Parliamentary Assembly of the Council of Europe since 2012, Bakoyannis serves as chairwoman of the Sub-Committee on relations with the OECD and the EBRD. She is also a member of the Committee on Political Affairs and Democracy, which she chaired from 2014 to 2016; a member of the Committee on the Honouring of Obligations and Commitments by Member States of the Council of Europe (Monitoring Committee); co-rapporteur for the monitoring of Russia (alongside Liliane Maury Pasquier); and rapporteur on the Syrian Civil War. In 2019, she announced her candidacy to succeed Thorbjørn Jagland as Secretary General of the Council of Europe. The position was ultimately won by Croatia&#x27;s Foreign Minister Marija Pejčinović Burić.

In 2015, Bakoyannis was named a member of the OSCE Panel of Eminent Persons on European Security as a Common Project, chaired by Wolfgang Ischinger.

==Other activities==
* Centre for European Policy Studies (CEPS), Member of the Board of Directors
* European Council on Foreign Relations (ECFR), Member of the Council

==Recognition==
In March 1992, the International Centre for Women awarded Bakoyannis the International Leadership Award, and in June 1993, she was recognised by the 14th International Symposium Fontana di Roma for her valuable contribution to culture.

Bakoyannis received the honor of being elected World Mayor in 2005, an annual internet-based project organized by City Mayors in order to honor the mayors who have served their communities well. Her efforts to get Athens ready to host the 2004 Summer Olympics successfully, her actions to transform the city for the benefit of its residents and her fight against terrorism helped Bakoyannis win the award. During the contest she was strongly supported by the Greek community and also received thousands of votes from several countries around Europe, North America and Australia. She had also been continuously included in the Forbes Magazine&#x27;s List of The World&#x27;s 100 Most Powerful Women from 2006 to 2008. In 2008, she was awarded the Emperor Maximilian Award-European Award for Regional Policy and Local Government by the State of Tyrol and the city of Innsbruck. In 2009, she was named as the first female foreign associate of the French Academy in Humanities and Political Sciences. The same year, she was also awarded the title of Honorary Senator by the European Academy of Sciences and Arts in Salzburg. In 2010, Dora Bakoyannis has been awarded the National Order of the Chevalry of the Legion of Honour of the French Republic (Ordre Nationale de Chevalier de la Legion d&#x27; Honneur).

On 21 March 2008 she received a copy of the key of the city of Tirana on the occasion of her official visit to Albania.

==Remarkable incidents==
On December 13, 2002, two months after taking office as mayor of Athens, an assassination attempt was made on her by a perpetrator who was considered mentally disturbed.

In March 2021, the driver of her guard team killed a 23 year old man outside the Hellenic Parliament and the driver fled so as not to be found. The police drove the eyewitnesses away from the scene of the accident.

==Personal life==
In December 1974, she married journalist Pavlos Bakoyannis and later gave birth to their two children, Alexia and Kostas. In 1977, she took examinations at the Ministry of Economic Coordination and was appointed in the Department of European Economic Community Affairs. When her father was elected leader of New Democracy in 1984, she served as chief of staff until 1989. On 26 September 1989, her husband, who had been elected a member of the Hellenic Parliament in the June 1989 election and was the chief architect for the Andreas Papandreou indictment for Koskotas scandal, was assassinated by members of the terrorist group Revolutionary Organization 17 November, as he entered his office building. She later married businessman Isidoros Kouvelos in 1998, but retains her late husband&#x27;s surname. Her second husband is currently the president of the Hellenic Olympic Committee.

On October 18, 2021 she revealed that she had been diagnosed with multiple myeloma - a type of cancer of white blood cells.

<doc id="843975" wikidata="Q7444329" url="?curid=843975" title="Secretary of state (Canada)">
<text>In Canada from 1993 to 2003 and again from 2007 to 2008, secretary of state was a title given to junior ministers of state in the Government of Canada that sat outside Cabinet. Because it was a position that was assigned to assist Cabinet ministers, a secretary of state was legally a minister of state; the distinction is that, unlike a minister, a secretary is not a full cabinet portfolio itself and thus not considered a member of Cabinet. (They were hence considered junior to ministers of state.) The Secretary of State (Training and Youth), for instance, would assist the Minister for Human Resources and Development. This usage is opposite to that in the United Kingdom, where junior ministers generally report to more senior secretaries of state. Secretaries of state were, however, members of the ministry and the Queen&#x27;s Privy Council for Canada.

This generic usage should not be confused with the former cabinet positions of Secretary of State for Canada (1867–1996), Secretary of State for the Provinces (1867–1873), and Secretary of State for External Affairs (1909–1995).

== History ==
These positions were first used by Jean Chrétien as a way to decrease the size of the Cabinet without substantially decreasing the size of the ministry. When Paul Martin became Prime Minister in 2003, this usage ended, and he instead appointed ministers of state and increased the powers of parliamentary secretaries to act in junior policy positions.

Martin&#x27;s successor, Stephen Harper, resumed the use of secretaries of state in a cabinet shuffle on 4 January 2007, but went back to ministers of state in his October 2008 cabinet.

==List of secretaries of state in Canada==

=== External affairs ===
Between 1993 and 2003, there were at least three junior Minister of State positions within the Department of External Affairs (renamed in 1995 to the Department of Foreign Affairs and International Trade) responsible for assisting the Minister of Foreign Affairs (known until 1993 as the Secretary of State for External Affairs).

* the Secretary of State (Asia-Pacific) — relations within the Asia-Pacific
* the Secretary of State (Latin America and Africa) — relations with Latin America and Africa.
* the Secretary of State (Central and Eastern Europe and Middle East) — relations with Central &amp; Eastern Europe and the Middle East (introduced by Order-in-Council in 2002).

Between 2007 and 2008, the Conservative Harper government included a less narrow position to assist with the Foreign Affairs minister, called the Secretary of State (Foreign Affairs and International Trade).
=== Heritage ===
Several Secretaries of State assisted the Minister of Canadian Heritage (and antecedents) with the various portfolios of the Department of Canadian Heritage (formerly Department of Communications), including multiculturalism, which at one point fell under the Minister of Multiculturalism and Citizenship.
=== Industry ===
The Secretary of State (Science, Research and Development) was a position introduced in 1993 to assist the Minister of Industry within Industry Canada.

The Secretary of State (Science, Research and Development) (Western Economic Diversification) was introduced in 1996 to provide assistance to the Minister of Western Economic Diversification within their department.
Under Prime Minister Stephen Harper, the office of Secretary of State (Small Business and Tourism) was introduced. On 2008 October 30, a ministerial position was established by Harper as the Minister of State (Science &amp; Technology).

=== Labour ===
The Secretary of State (Training and Youth) assisted the Minister of Labour for the Department of Labour until July 1996, when the labour ministry was abolished and transferred to the Human Resources Development. In 1997, the secretarial position was changed to Secretary of State (Children and Youth).

Between 2007 and 2008 during the conservative Harper government, Human Resources Development included a Secretary of State (Seniors) to assist with the seniors portfolio.

<doc id="843978" wikidata="Q714126" url="?curid=843978" title="Guccio Gucci">
<text>Guccio Giovanbattista Giacinto Dario Maria Gucci (26 March 1881 – 2 January 1953) was an Italian businessman and fashion designer and founder of the fashion house Gucci.

== Early life ==
Guccio Gucci was born in Florence, Tuscany on 26 March 1881. He was the son of Tuscan parents, Gabriello Gucci, a leather craftsman from San Miniato, and Elena Santini, from Lastra a Signa.

As a teenager, in 1899, Guccio Gucci worked at the Savoy Hotel in London. Little is known about his early life circumstances and what influenced his move to London. Gucci was inspired by the elegant upper-class hotel guests and by luggage companies such as H.J. Cave &amp; Sons. He returned to Florence and started making luxury luggage and accessories. He initially worked for the Italian luggage brand Franzi, where he gained experience in leather craftsmanship before establishing his own business.

== Career ==
In 1921, he founded the House of Gucci in Florence as a small family-owned leather shop. He began selling saddles, leather bags and other accessories to horsemen in the 1920s. During the 1930s League of Nations sanctions on Italy, which led to leather shortages, he innovated by developing a specially-woven hemp fabric from Naples. In 1938, Gucci expanded his business to a second location in Rome at the insistence of his son Aldo. His one-man business eventually turned into a family business when his sons joined the company. Aldo, the eldest son who joined in 1925, proved particularly innovative in developing new products, including the company&#x27;s first pigskin bag.

In 1947, responding to post-war material scarcity, Gucci created the Bamboo Bag, using lightweight bamboo for handles, which became one of the brand&#x27;s signature designs.

In 1951, Gucci opened their store in Milan. He wanted to keep the business small, and for nearly the entirety of his life, the company remained only in Italy. Two weeks before Guccio Gucci&#x27;s death, the New York Gucci boutique was opened by his sons Aldo, Rodolfo, and Vasco.

== Death and legacy ==
Gucci died on 2 January 1953 in Milan. After his death, the business was left to his four remaining sons. With the change in leadership the Gucci brand expanded to opening international locations and a diversification of product line.

The Gucci Museum (also called Gucci Garden) in Florence, is a fashion museum centered around the history of the company and Guccio Gucci.

== Personal life ==
Gucci and his wife, Aida Calvelli, married in 1901 and had six children, five sons and one daughter. His son Ugo Calvelli Gucci (1899–1973) was adopted, born from his mother Aida Calvelli&#x27;s previous relationship. His son Enzo (1904–1913) died in childhood. His sons Ugo, Aldo, Vasco, and Rodolfo Gucci held prominent roles in his company, but his daughter was not given a role. There was a lot of sibling rivalry to hold power within the company, and by the 1980s, this became a serious issue dividing the family.

In his final years, he lived near Rusper, in West Sussex, England.

==Arms==

Guccio Gucci; his eldest biological son, Aldo Gucci; Aldo Gucci&#x27;s sons, Giorgio Gucci, Paolo Gucci, and Roberto Gucci; and grandson Uberto Gucci claimed the right to use an inherited, ancestral coat of arms after the Kingdom of Italy, which was ruled by the House of Savoy, transitioned to the Italian Republic in 1946.

Guccio Gucci adapted, or incorporated, the Gucci coat-of-arms, as recorded in the Archives of Florence, into the Gucci company&#x27;s knight logo, which was trademarked by the Gucci company on 4 February 1955.

The blazon recorded in the Florence Archives is as follows: &quot;Azure, three red poles bordered argent (white); a chief or, loaded to the right (dexter) of a wheel of azure, and to the left (sinister) of a rose of red.&quot; (&quot;D&#x27;azzurro, a tre pali di rosso bordati d&#x27;argento; e al capo d&#x27;oro caricato a destra di una ruota d&#x27;azzurro, e a sinistra di una rosa di rosso.&quot;)

Translation: &quot;Family of San Miniato; Giacinto Gucci and his brothers were admitted to the nobility of San Miniato in 1763 (on that occasion it is declared that the family had come from Cremona in 1224); Giuseppe di Gaetano Gucci, on the other hand, was admitted to the nobility of Fiesole in 1839. Francesco di Benedetto Gucci obtained Florentine citizenship in 1601, for the Golden Lion banner; Giovanni Battista by Giovan Piero Gucci obtained it in 1634, in the Scala banner.&quot;

Court documents, records, and subsequent rulings indicate that, because the Gucci family trademarked the coat-of-arms in 1955, the trademark transferred with the sale of the Gucci company by Maurizio Gucci to Investcorp, and subsequent company owners, in 1993. However, Uberto Gucci (b. 1960), the son of Roberto Gucci, and the grandson of Aldo Gucci, claims that the Gucci family still has the right to use the ancestral Gucci coat-of-arms.

<text>Annulenes are monocyclic hydrocarbons that contain the maximum number of non-cumulated or conjugated double bonds (&#x27;&#x27;). They have the general formula C&quot;n&quot;H&quot;n&quot; (when &quot;n&quot; is an even number) or C&quot;n&quot;H&quot;n&quot;+1 (when &quot;n&quot; is an odd number). The IUPAC accepts the use of &#x27;annulene nomenclature&#x27; in naming carbocyclic ring systems with 7 or more carbon atoms, using the name &#x27;[&quot;n&quot;]annulene&#x27; for the mancude hydrocarbon with &quot;n&quot; carbon atoms in its ring, though in certain contexts (e.g., discussions of aromaticity for different ring sizes), smaller rings (&quot;n&quot; = 3 to 6) can also be informally referred to as annulenes. Using this form of nomenclature 1,3,5,7-cyclooctatetraene is [8]annulene and benzene is [6]annulene (and occasionally referred to as just &#x27;annulene&#x27;).

The discovery that [18]annulene possesses a number of key properties associated with other aromatic molecules was an important development in the understanding of aromaticity as a chemical concept. 

In the related annulynes, one double bond is replaced by a triple bond.

== Aromaticity ==
Annulenes may be &quot;aromatic&quot; (benzene, [6]annulene and [18]annulene), &quot;non-aromatic&quot; ([8] and [10]annulene), or &quot;anti-aromatic&quot; (cyclobutadiene, [4]annulene). Cyclobutadiene is the only annulene with considerable antiaromaticity, since planarity is unavoidable. With [8]annulene, the molecule takes on a tub shape that allows it to avoid conjugation of double bonds. [10]Annulene is of the wrong size to achieve a planar structure: in a planar conformation, ring strain due to either steric hindrance of internal hydrogens (when some double bonds are &quot;trans&quot;) or bond angle distortion (when the double bonds are all &quot;cis&quot;) is unavoidable. Thus, it does not exhibit appreciable aromaticity.

When the annulene is large enough, [18]annulene for example, there is enough room internally to accommodate hydrogen atoms without significant distortion of bond angles. [18]Annulene possesses several properties that qualify it as aromatic. However, none of the larger annulenes are as stable as benzene, as their reactivity more closely resembles a conjugated polyene than an aromatic hydrocarbon.

In general, charged annulene species of the form (; ; ) are aromatic, provided a planar conformation can be achieved. For instance, , , and are all known aromatic species.

<text>Johann Nepomuk Hiedler (19 March 1807 – 17 September 1888) was the maternal great-grandfather and possibly also the paternal grandfather of Adolf Hitler.

His first two names are the same as the name of the Bohemian Saint Johann von Nepomuk. Some people consider this name as evidence that Nepomuk (and therefore his great-grandson Adolf Hitler) had Czech ancestry. However, Johann von Pomuk / Johann Nepomuk, was an important saint for Bohemians of both Czech and German ethnicity, and thus Nepomuk may only indicate an association with Bohemia in general, or to someone else named Johann Nepomuk, because there is no evidence that Hitler&#x27;s ancestors were of Czech ancestry.

Nepomuk became a relatively prosperous farmer and married Eva Maria Decker (16 December 1792 – 28 December 1873). The couple had three children together: Johanna Hiedler (19 January 1830 – 8 February 1906), Walburga Hüttler (11 April 1832 – 30 November 1900), Josefa Hüttler (15 February 1834 – 13 May 1859).

On 15 September 1848, Johanna married Johann Baptist Pölzl, a peasant farmer. The couple would eventually have five sons and six daughters, and only three of these children would survive to adulthood. Walburga married Josef Romeder (born in 1835) on 25 January 1853, but had no children. Josefa married Leopold Seiler (born 14 November 1832) on 1 March 1859, but had no children and died soon after on 13 May 1859.

Johann Nepomuk&#x27;s wife, Eva Maria, died 28 December 1873, at the age 81 in Spital, Weitra. Johanna&#x27;s daughter, Nepomuk&#x27;s granddaughter, Klara Pölzl, would eventually become the third wife of Alois Hitler. Alois was the illegitimate son of Maria Schicklgruber, who had married Johann&#x27;s older brother, Johann Georg Hiedler on 10 May 1842, who may in fact have been Alois&#x27; natural father. Alois would claim in his later life that Johann Georg Hiedler was not his stepfather, but in fact his biological father, since Johann Nepomuk informally adopted Alois during Alois&#x27; childhood. In June 1876, Johann and Alois both returned to Weitra and Johann testified before a Catholic notary that Johann Georg was Alois&#x27; biological father, who had abandoned the child and handed over his fatherhood responsibilities to Johann Nepomuk. On 6 January 1877, Alois was legitimized as &#x27;Alois Hitler&#x27; and the priest then changed the details on the baptismal certificate from &quot;Catholic, Male, Illegitimate&quot; to &quot;Johann Georg Hitler&quot; under his father&#x27;s name. However, it is also possible that Johann Nepomuk himself was, in fact, Alois&#x27; natural father but could not acknowledge this publicly due to his marriage.

Nepomuk willed Alois a considerable portion of his life savings. Nepomuk&#x27;s granddaughter, Klara, had a protracted affair with Alois before marrying him on 7 January 1885 in Braunau Am Inn after Alois&#x27; second wife, Franziska Matzelsberger had died on 10 August 1884 from tuberculosis. Klara had six children with Alois, and gave birth to Adolf Hitler on 20 April 1889.

<text>Igor Nikolaevich Smirnov (; born 23 October 1941) is a Russian-born Transnistrian politician who served as the first president (1991–2011) of the internationally unrecognized Pridnestrovian Moldovan Republic.

==Childhood==
Igor Smirnov was born in Petropavlovsk-Kamchatsky, Russian SFSR, Soviet Union during World War II. He was the son of Nikolai Stepanovich Smirnov, a worker within the Soviet Communist Party apparatus and Zinaida Grigor&#x27;evna Smirnova, a journalist and newspaper editor. As the Party promoted Nikolai Stepanovich to ever more important positions, the family moved from Petropavlovsk to the Ukrainian SSR, where the Red Army had recently expelled the Nazi German military. The Smirnovs initially benefited from Nikolai Stepanovich&#x27;s successes—he reached the position of First Secretary of the Hola Prystan Raion committee in Soviet Ukraine.

In the summer of 1952, Nikolai Stepanovich was arrested for corruption. He was sentenced to fifteen years in the Soviet forced labor camps with a following period of five years&#x27; internal exile. As the family of an enemy of the people, life was difficult for Zinaida Grigor&#x27;evna and her three sons, Vladimir, Oleg, and Igor. In the wake of Joseph Stalin&#x27;s death in 1953, Nikolai Stepanovich was released together with many Soviet inmates. The Smirnov family was reunited in central Russia near the Ural Mountains, where Nikolai Stepanovich directed a primary school and Zinaida Grigor&#x27;evna worked as the editor of a local Komsomol newspaper.

==Professional life==
In 1959, Igor Smirnov began work at the Zlatoust Metallurgical Factory at the age of eighteen. Soon, however, he moved back to Ukraine to work on the construction of a new hydroelectric power station in the town of Nova Kakhovka in the Kherson Oblast.

Smirnov displayed a great enthusiasm for Soviet life, pursuing higher education in the evenings and weekends after work and participating in a number of athletic and cultural activities. He met and married a young engineer named Zhannetta Nikolaevna Lotnik in the early 1960s and served in the Soviet Army from 1963 to 1966 as a Second Lieutenant. In 1963, Smirnov joined the Communist Party of the Soviet Union and served as a Komsomol organizer (&quot;komsorg&quot;) after returning to civilian life.

Once back from the military, Smirnov also continued the correspondence courses he had begun in the early 1960s, receiving a degree from the Zaporizhzhia Machine-Building Institute in 1974. Meanwhile, he worked his way up from the shop floor to be an assistant director of one of the shops of the Nova Kakhovka Machine-Building Factory. With his college diploma, Smirnov continued to be promoted. He soon became the shop director, then assistant to the factory&#x27;s chief industrial upgrades and new technologies engineer and finally an assistant director.

While he was not made director in 1987 when that position&#x27;s erstwhile occupant retired, he was given the directorship of the &quot;Elektromash&quot; Electronics Concern in the nearby Moldovan city of Tiraspol. This was just over two years before Smirnov led the city&#x27;s municipal government as the chairman of the Tiraspol city soviet and just under three before he held the most powerful position in the embryonic, and unrecognized, Pridnestrovian Moldovan Soviet Socialist Republic.

==The strike campaign==
As communist states began to collapse at the end of the 1980s, people in some areas of the Soviet Union began to demand sovereignty for separate national identities. As the citizens of the Moldavian SSR debated the merits of introducing Moldovan as the official language of the republic—at first with Russian as a second official language and later without—the republic was divided over the issue of nationalizing Moldova. One side believed that Moldova should be independent from the Moscow Kremlin and turned into a nation-state, possibly in a union with Romania where a virtually identical language is spoken. The other believed that Moldova should remain a part of the supranationalist USSR, possibly in a post-communist, but still united country.

Smirnov and many of his colleagues were suspicious of the possibility of language laws from the beginning, they suspected this to be the first step towards &quot;nationalization&quot; of the republic at the expense of &quot;their country&quot;, the Soviet Union. However, in August 1989, when it was leaked that Moldovan would be made the only official language, Smirnov and other industrial workers in Tiraspol banded together to create the United Work Collective Council (OSTK – Объединенный Совет трудовых коллективов) and called an immediate strike that eventually led to the shutdown of most major industrial activity (concentrated in the Transnistrian region) throughout the SSR.

==Entry into politics==
When the strike campaign, from 16 August to 22 September 1989, failed to produce much of an effect in Chişinău, the OSTK re-examined its tactics. Smirnov and others saw the upcoming Moldovan elections as an opportunity to effect change through different means. Smirnov won two seats in the elections of February 1990, the 32nd district seat for the city soviet (municipal government) of Tiraspol and the 125th district seat for the Supreme Soviet of MSSR (republican government) in the 1990 Moldovan parliamentary election. Once in the city soviet, Smirnov ran for chairmanship of that body. In a dramatic demonstration of how much the Communist Party&#x27;s power had waned, Smirnov beat his challenger, the First Secretary of the city&#x27;s Party Committee, Leonid Tsurkan, by a 2-to-1 margin. From this time forward, Tiraspol was an OSTK-controlled city.

Things did not go quite as smoothly for Igor Smirnov in the Moldovan Supreme Soviet. The OSTK candidates, mostly from Transnistria in the country&#x27;s eastern periphery, were a small fraction of the body&#x27;s overall membership—approximately 15 percent. In May 1990, these Transnistrian Supreme Soviet deputies were attacked and beaten by pro-independence protesters and quickly left the body for their homes in the East. Unable to affect the course of events in Chişinău, these deputies acted to establish their own Soviet republic, a republic that would remain a part of the Soviet Union and not secede with the rest of the Moldova. Many Moldovans reacted with outrage at this infringement of their sovereignty and the Soviet central government publicly rebuked the separatists for making the situation worse and pushing Moldova further toward independence.

==Proclamation of independence==
Igor Smirnov emerged as a leader of the OSTK on a regional level as Transnistrian politicians and activists worked towards sovereignty from the Moldovan SSR in the summer and autumn of 1990. When the First All-region Congress of Transnistrian Deputies created a self-contained Transnistrian economic zone in June 1990, Smirnov was elected chair of a coordinating council charged with carrying momentum forward to sovereignty. A second congress held on September 2 proclaimed the creation of the Pridnestrovian Moldavian Soviet Socialist Republic (PMSSR) and deputies elected him to chair the Provisional Supreme Soviet of the PMSSR.

In 1991, Smirnov was arrested in a secret operation by special forces of the Moldovan Ministry of Internal Affairs in Kyiv, accused of &quot;the intentional territorial dismemberment of the Republic of Moldova&quot; and brought to Chișinău. He was released shortly thereafter after reported pressure from Russia.

In his new role as chairman of the PMSSR Supreme Soviet, and later, president of the Pridnestrovian Moldovan Republic (PMR), Smirnov worked to gain recognition for the state. While this was never a likely outcome, Smirnov was successful at securing the cooperation of a locally stationed Soviet Army unit; as the conflict grew increasingly violent at the end of 1991 and into 1992, Soviet Army leaders and enlisted men, often themselves from Transnistria, gave moral support, weapons and ammunition to PMR separatists. Eventually a number of Soviet Army soldiers joined the PMR Army.

In December 1991 Smirnov beat Grigorii Marakutsa, his successor as chairman of the PMSSR Supreme Soviet and another challenger in an election for president of the Pridnestrovian Moldovan Soviet Socialist Republic. He won with 64% of the vote.

==Smirnov after the war==
Igor Smirnov won three further elections after 1991. On 23 December 1996, he took 72% of the vote against 20% for Vladimir Malakhov and on December 9, 2001, he took 81.9% of the vote against 6.7% for Tom Zenovich and 4.6% for Alexander Radchenko. On December 10, 2006, Smirnov was re-elected for a third time with 82.4% of the vote. His Communist Party opponent, Nadezhda Bondarenko got only 8.1% of the vote. Andrey Safonov, owner and editor of the Opposition newspaper Novaia gazeta got 3.9% and Renewal Party MP Peter Tomaily, standing as an independent candidate, got 2.1%. 1.6% voted for &quot;none of the above&quot; and 1.9% of the ballot papers were blank or spoiled. Turnout was 66.1%. None of these elections were recognized by the international community, which does not recognize the legality of the Transnistrian authorities and called for democratic elections for a self-governing territory within the boundaries of Moldova.

He organized a referendum on 17 September 2006 where the Transnistrian population was asked whether Transnistria should be reintegrated into Moldova (which was rejected) or remain independent and join Russia in the future (which was approved). Smirnov did more references to a possible accession of Transnistria into Russia during his rule.

In the December 2011 elections, Igor Smirnov came in third with 24.82% of the vote. He trailed the chairman of the Supreme Soviet, Anatolii Kaminskii, and the former chairman of that body, Evgenii Shevchuk. In the election, leaders of United Russia, the ruling political party of Russia, voiced a lack of confidence in Smirnov and supported the campaign of Anatolii Kaminskii.

Smirnov has announced that he will retire from politics when the Pridnestrovian Moldovan Republic obtains international recognition as a sovereign state and has called this goal his life&#x27;s work.

His last vice president was Aleksandr Ivanovich Korolyov.

<text>Rochester New York FC, formerly known as the Rochester Raging Rhinos and later the Rochester Rhinos, was an American soccer team based in Rochester, New York, United States. In 2023, the club withdrew from the professional level in MLS Next Pro. The club won the 1999 U.S. Open Cup, marking the only time a non-MLS team has won the U.S. Open Cup since MLS started play in 1996.

Founded in 1996 as the Rochester Raging Rhinos, they changed their name to Rochester Rhinos to start the 2008 season. The club began a four-year hiatus after the 2017 USL season in the second tier of the United States soccer league system. The team then rebranded as Rochester New York FC and played its first and only season in MLS Next Pro in 2022, but departed before the beginning of the 2023 season.

The club was affiliated with the youth club Empire United Soccer Academy, which rebranded as Rochester New York FC Youth and continues to operate as a separate club. The youth club currently has a team in the United Premier Soccer League.

==History==
===1996–2017===
Rochester Raging Rhinos was founded in 1996 and played in the now-defunct original A-League until it merged with the USISL for the 1997 season, creating the new A-League. After reaching the championship game in 1996 they won their first league championship in 1998.

In 1999 the club made it to the final of the U.S. Open Cup, where they defeated MLS club Colorado Rapids 2–0, becoming the first team from outside MLS to win the national cup since MLS&#x27;s inception. This win was followed by two further A-League titles in 2000 and 2001.

A year after the A-League&#x27;s renaming to the USL First Division in 2005, the Rhinos moved into the newly completed PAETEC Park, a 13,768-seat soccer-specific stadium now known as Rochester Community Sports Complex Stadium, and again made the championship game. The Rhinos were considered a candidate to be an MLS expansion team when PAETEC Park was in the planning stages.

The team was declared insolvent in 2008 after defaulting on their stadium agreement, and PAETEC Park was seized by the city of Rochester. After a brief search for a new owner and investor who could improve the team&#x27;s financial outlook, in March 2008 the club was taken over by Utica businessman Rob Clark. Clark changed the team&#x27;s name to the &quot;Rochester Rhinos,&quot; and assured that the financial situation of the team was stable and it would be able to play the next year. After two seasons under Clark the club joined the new NASL for its 2010 season. The United States Soccer Federation refused the NASL&#x27;s application for sanctioning, and instead operated its own temporary second-division league for 2010. The Rhinos were part of that temporary USSF Division 2 Professional League. The Rhinos switched leagues again before the 2011 season to the then third-division USL Pro league, who considered themselves equally competitive with the second-division NASL.

The 2011 season ended with the Rhinos first in their division followed by a playoff season that lasted two games. The Rhinos saw off the Pittsburgh Riverhounds 4–0 in first round of the playoffs and then lost 2–1 at home to the Harrisburg City Islanders to finish the season. At the end of the season, head coach Bob Lilley was replaced by Jesse Myers, most recently an assistant coach of the Richmond Kickers.

In January 2013, the Rhinos became the official USL Pro affiliate of the New England Revolution. On May 19, Following a 1–6–1 start to the 2013 season, Myers was dismissed and Pat Ercoli named head coach. They missed the playoffs for the first time ever, finishing with a 6–10–10 record.

The league revoked the Clark family&#x27;s ownership of the club in January 2016, citing the revocation of the lease on Rochester Rhinos Stadium by the City of Rochester. The league took over operations of the club until it could be sold to a new ownership group. David and Wendy Dworkin, minority owners of the Sacramento Kings basketball team, were identified as the Rhinos&#x27; new owners later in the month. The Dworkins were officially announced as the new owners on March 10, 2016.

===2017–2023===
On November 30, 2017, the Rhinos announced that they would go on hiatus. After almost a year of silence the team announced that it planned to move to the new third division league USL League One and return to the field in 2020. Moreover, the team announced that it had reached a deal with the City to vacate Marina Auto Stadium and stated it would be searching a site to build a new stadium. Towards the end of the first USL League One season, the Rhinos&#x27; President Pat Ercoli announced on Uncle Sam&#x27;s Soccer Podcast that due to delays and pacing of the development of the Rhinos&#x27; new stadium that the team would likely sit out the 2020 season and relaunch in 2021.

On November 30, 2017, the team announced that they would not play in 2018 while additional funding was sought. On August 22, 2018, it was announced that the club would pursue a new stadium location and attempt to join USL League One.

In June 2021, Jamie Vardy was announced as co-owner of the franchise and intends to field a team for the 2022 season. Lee Tucker, who was the project leader at Vardy’s successful V9 Academy – which gave opportunities to non-league players in England seeking to break into the professional game, will be appointed Sporting Director.

On September 1, 2021, it was announced that the club had gone through an extensive makeover as part of the club’s rebirth, the Rhinos had a complete rebrand to Rochester New York FC or RNYFC for short, and had a new logo introduced. The new club badge features an abstract rendering of Rochester&#x27;s High Falls waterfall.

The club returned to play in 2022, and were the only independent club in the new MLS Next Pro league. They made the playoffs but were eliminated in the quarterfinals. On March 10, 2023, Rochester New York FC withdrew from MLS Next Pro and ceased operations citing an &quot;unsustainable business model&quot;.

==Stadiums==

* Fauver Stadium; Rochester, New York (1996)
* Frontier Field; Rochester, New York (1996–2005)
* Marina Auto Stadium; Rochester, New York (2006–2017)
* John L. DiMarco Field; Brighton, New York (2022)

The Raging Rhinos first began play in 1996 at Fauver Stadium, a soccer venue at the University of Rochester. They then played at Frontier Field, a Minor League Baseball park, from 1996 to 2005.

Starting in 2006, the team played in Marina Auto Stadium, a soccer-specific stadium built for their use. When the Rhinos went on hiatus at the end of 2017, they originally sought to remain at the stadium, scheduling neutral-site USL matches during the 2018 season to meet the terms of their lease. However, in August 2018 the team announced they would be seeking a new venue.

In June 2021, when the team announced a new co-owner ahead of a planned return to play in 2022, they indicated they would play at Empire United Soccer Complex in Henrietta, New York. However, Empire United&#x27;s field had no stands, concessions, or other amenities, and would have required upgrades for professional soccer use. In order to be ready for a March 2022 kickoff in MLS Next Pro, the team announced in December 2021 that they would instead play at John L. DiMarco Field, a 1,500-capacity soccer and lacrosse venue at Monroe Community College in Brighton, New York.

<text>Laban (Aramaic: ܠܵܒܵܢ; ), also known as Laban the Aramean, is a figure in the Book of Genesis of the Hebrew Bible. He was the brother of Rebekah, the woman who married Isaac and bore Jacob. Laban welcomed his nephew, and set him the stipulation of seven years&#x27; labour before he permitted him to marry his daughter Rachel. Laban tricked Jacob into marrying his elder daughter Leah instead. Jacob then took Rachel as his second wife, on condition of serving an additional seven years&#x27; labour.

Laban and his family were described as dwelling in Paddan Aram, in Mesopotamia.

==Hebrew Bible==

Laban first appears in the Hebrew Bible in as the grown spokesman for his father Bethuel&#x27;s house; he was impressed by the gold jewelry given to his sister on behalf of Isaac, and played a key part in arranging their marriage. Twenty years later, Laban&#x27;s nephew Jacob was born to Isaac and Rebekah.

When grown, Jacob comes to work for Laban. The biblical narrative provides a framework for dating these events: Jacob begat Joseph 14 years after his flight to Laban; Joseph entered Pharaoh&#x27;s service at age 30; and from that point, after seven years of plenty and two years of famine, Jacob met Pharaoh and stated his age as 130. Subtracting yields an age of 77 (Jacob at his flight to Laban). Laban was more than 30 years older than Jacob, and employed him for 20 years.

Laban promised his younger daughter Rachel to Jacob in return for seven years&#x27; service, only to trick him into marrying his elder daughter Leah instead. Jacob then served another seven years in exchange for the right to marry his choice, Rachel, as well (). Laban&#x27;s flocks and fortunes increased under Jacob&#x27;s skilled care, but there was much further trickery between them. Six years after his promised service has ended, Jacob, having prospered largely by proving more cunning than his father-in-law, finally left. Laban pursued him, but they eventually parted on good terms ().

==Interpretations==
Though the biblical text itself does not attest to this, rabbinic sources also identify Laban as the father of Bilhah and Zilpah, the two concubines with whom Jacob also has children. According to Seder HaDoroth, Laban&#x27;s wife and the mother of Leah and Rachel was Adinah. Sefer haYashar reports that Laban was also the father of Beor the father of Balaam and Balaam&#x27;s sons were Jannes and Jambres. Other Jewish traditions identify Laban as Kushan Rishatayim, king of Aram Nahariyim who oppressed the Jews in the era of the Judges and another Jewish tradition identifies Laban and Balaam as the same person—indeed, both were known for their sorcery. According to the Midrash, the wall against which Balaam&#x27;s leg was crushed by his donkey was the very mound of stones from Laban and Jacob&#x27;s covenant. By plotting to harm the Jews, Balaam was violating the covenant he had made to never harm Jacob&#x27;s descendants

Laban can be seen as symbolizing those whose concern for the welfare of their immediate family, nominally a virtue, is taken to the point where it has lasting negative ramifications. Laban&#x27;s urge to ensure his older daughter not be left unmarried can be interpreted as leading to the Exile in Egypt; his anxiety over seeing his son-in-law throw away his family&#x27;s comfortable position in Aram in search of a risky new beginning back in Canaan leads him to oppose the return of the Children of Israel to the Promised Land. His name can also be seen as symbolic in this matter: it means &quot;white&quot;, the visual representation of purity, without visible stain, symbolizing those without apparent evil motives whose actions nevertheless result in undesirable outcomes.

==Laban and Passover==
Laban is referenced significantly in the Passover Haggadah, in the context of the answer to the traditional child&#x27;s question, &quot;Why is this night different from all other nights?&quot; The prescribed answer begins with a quote from : &quot;arami oved avi&quot;: normally translated as &quot;a wandering Aramean was my father&quot;, alluding either to Abram or Jacob, but here interpreted unusually as &quot;ibbed Arami et-avi&quot;, &quot;an Aramean &quot;destroyed&quot; my father&quot;, as made clear by the rabbinical exegesis read in the Seder:
:Come and learn what Laban the Aramean sought to do our father Jacob. For Pharaoh issued his edict against only the males, but Laban sought to uproot all, as it is said, &#x27;An Aramean would have destroyed my father, and he went down to Egypt and he became there a nation, great, mighty and populous.&#x27;

There may also be a play on words here, using &quot;arami&quot; in two senses – as both &quot;arami&quot;, &quot;an Aramean&quot;, and &quot;rama′i&quot;, &quot;a deceiver&quot;, since Laban cheated Jacob (Genesis Rabbah 70:19). In this interpretation, &quot;arami&quot; personifies the Israelite peoples’ bitter enemy.

The question of what the connection is between the apparently disjoint tales of Laban and Pharaoh is interpreted in several ways by rabbinical authorities.

Rabbi Azriel Hildesheimer explains in his &quot;Hukkat HaPesach&quot; that Laban was, in fact, the driving force of the entire Exile and Exodus saga. Rachel was Jacob&#x27;s divinely intended wife and could hypothetically have given birth to Joseph as Jacob&#x27;s firstborn with rights of primogeniture. In this counterfactual, Jacob&#x27;s favoring Joseph&#x27;s succession as the leader of the fledgling nation of Israel would have been seen as perfectly normal and fitting, given the customs of the time. No older brothers would have felt cheated and jealous, and Joseph would not have been sold into slavery. Thus, there would have been no need for Jacob&#x27;s family to be sent to Egypt to unite with Joseph.

In actuality, Laban married Jacob to Leah first, causing Leah&#x27;s sons to precede Joseph in birth order, so that they felt justifiably outraged when their father seemed to violate societal norms by treating his second-youngest son as his heir, in preference to his older sons&#x27; natural and legal rights. In this way, Laban can be seen as &quot;seeking to uproot all&quot;, by attempting to sever the family tree of the Patriarchs between Jacob and Joseph before the Children of Israel could become more than a single small family.

Devora Steinmetz, assistant professor of Talmud at the Jewish Theological Seminary of America, says that the story of Jacob and Laban also resonates with the covenant with Abraham, more frequently interpreted as applying to the Exodus: &quot;your seed shall be a stranger in a land that is not theirs, and shall serve them and they shall afflict them ... Afterward they shall come out with great wealth&quot; (Genesis 15:13–16). Jacob lived in the strange land of Aram, served Laban, and was afflicted by him; then he left with great wealth and returned to the Promised Land. The story thus serves to reinforce one of the central messages of the Passover Haggadah; that the Old Testament cycle of exile, persecution and return recurs again and again, and links the observant Jew in the Diaspora to the Land of Israel.

<text>Laban () is a figure in the First Book of Nephi, near the start of the Book of Mormon, a scripture of the Latter Day Saint movement. Although he only makes a brief appearance in the Book of Mormon, his brass plates play an important role when they are taken by Laman and Nephi (often referred to as the &quot;sons of Lehi&quot;) and are used by the Nephites.

==Narrative==

Laban appears in First Nephi as a wealthy and politically influential military commander who may be a distant kinsman of Lehi. Laban owns brass plates which are held in high esteem. Lehi sends his sons Laman and Nephi to retrieve these plates, but Laban rebuffs them. He then attempts to kill the brothers two times, and the second time he steals the Lehi family fortune. Later, Nephi sneaks into Jerusalem and discovers Laban lying drunk in the road. Directed by the Spirit of the Lord, Nephi decapitates Laban. He then puts on Laban&#x27;s clothing and armor and retrieves the plates.

==Interpretations==
===Brass Plates===
Brant Gardner identified five ways that the brass plates of Laban were &quot;extremely important&quot;, both in the immediate context of their retrieval by the sons of Lehi and in later Nephite, Lamanite, and Mulekite society. For Gardner, the plates function as a symbol of political authority, as a &quot;social anchor&quot; for the Nephites, a doctrinal source text, a prototype for Nephite recordkeeping, and as a &quot;sacred object.&quot; The last point, indicating that the brass plates function as royal insignia, is also discussed in depth by Stephen D. Ricks, a Latter-day Saint Hebraist and apologist. Ricks associated the brass plates with the &quot;protocol&quot; that was used as a prop in Josiah&#x27;s coronation, citing Rashi&#x27;s interpretation of the Hebrew word &quot;edût&quot; as the Torah in 2 Kings 11:12.

James Strang, like Joseph Smith, claimed to translate scripture from metal plates. The resulting scripture, the Book of the Law of the Lord, claims to contain at least part of Laban&#x27;s plates.

===Death===

Nephi&#x27;s killing of Laban has been argued over by believers and others engaging with the narrative on its own terms. Some say that the killing was legally justified as self defense, that it was a political act, that it was specifically one of &quot;sovereignty,&quot; and that it functioned similarly to the biblical Akedah as a test of Nephi&#x27;s faith. Commentators have suggested that the story was a way for Joseph Smith to deal with repressed childhood trauma and symbolically sever of the Book of Mormon narrative from the established biblical canon as the Spirit of the Lord ordered Laban&#x27;s murder. Steven L. Peck, a Latter-day Saint novelist wrote a Deleuzean treatment of the sword of Laban as emblematic of climate change and of power structures, referring to it as symptomatic of the &quot;Jerusalem-machine.&quot;

==Popular culture==
In &quot;The Book of Mormon Movie&quot;, adapted from First and Second Nephi, Laban was portrayed by the actor Michael Flynn. The film was widely panned by Latter-day Saint and secular critics. The &quot;Austin Chronicle&quot; wrote of &quot;Michael Flynn turning in a ripping good Edward G. Robinson impersonation as the villainous Laban.&quot;

<text>Sapadbizes (Σαπαδβιζης), also Sapalbizes or Sapaleizis, was a ruler of western Bactria, sometimes linked to the Yuezhi. He is known only from his coins, which are rather rare, and are dated to circa 20 BC - 20 AD. Two clues provide an approximate date for this ruler. He is believed to have overstruck the coins of Phraates IV of Parthia, secondly his coins are of good silver. This places him after Phraates IV (40 BC) and before the debasement of coinage in Northwest India (AD 20). He is not the only ruler of his dynasty known. Several other coins imply that Sapadbizes was preceded by at least one, and possibly two other rulers. It is likely that Sapadbizes and these other rulers were descendants of tribes who had invaded Bactria and imitated the coins of the last Greco-Bactrian kings. Though it is clear from the coins, and the evidence of Chinese chroniclers that at this time Sapadbizes was an ally or dependent of Parthia, nothing is known of the succession after Sapadbizes. However, scholars surmise that his kingdom was conquered by Kujula Kadphises, during the latter&#x27;s war with Parthia, and absorbed into the Kushan Empire, probably about the year 30 AD.

A coin of Sapadbizes was discovered in the burial site of Tillya Tepe.

<text>KFNZ-FM (96.5 MHz) is a commercial radio station in Kansas City, Missouri. It simulcasts a sports radio format with sister station KFNZ (610 AM), except during conflicting sports programming. The stations are owned by Audacy, Inc., with studios on Squibb Road in Mission, Kansas. KFNZ-AM-FM air local sports shows on weekdays, with Fox Sports Radio programming heard nights and weekends. They are the flagship radio stations for the Kansas City Chiefs and the Kansas City Royals.

KFNZ-FM is a Class C0 station, and has an effective radiated power (ERP) of 100,000 watts. The station&#x27;s transmitter is off East 56th Street near Bennington Avenue in Kansas City. KFNZ-FM broadcasts using HD Radio technology.

== History ==
===Classical KXTR===
The station began broadcasting on September 3, 1959. For four decades, it was classical music station KXTR, first owned by Telesound Broadcasting, and initially operating at 58,500 watts. Stereo Broadcasters, Inc. bought the station in 1962, and Senthesound Broadcasting bought it three years later. Robert Ingram took over the station in 1976, and KXTR upgraded to 100,000 watts in 1981.

Ingram sold the station to Heritage Media (and then Sinclair Broadcast Group) in 1997. Sinclair then sold it to Entercom (the forerunner to the present-day Audacy) in 2000. By the mid-1990s, KXTR replaced much of its live, local air staff with satellite-fed national programming. Only mornings were local, as well as &quot;Night on the Town&quot; on Saturdays (which would become syndicated).

In the spring of 2000, KXTR&#x27;s ratings were tied for 12th place, with a 3.8 share of the market. (It was ranked even lower in the 25-54 demographic, though ranked 9th in the 35-64 demographic.)

===96.5 The Buzz===
On August 17, 2000, at 10 a.m., KXTR was moved to 1250 AM, displacing sports talk station KKGM (now Regional Mexican station KYYS). At that point, 96.5 began stunting with a ticking clock. At noon, 96.5 flipped to a Top 40 format that emphasized modern rock hits (sometimes called &quot;Rock 40&quot;), taking aim at rival contemporary station KMXV, and was branded as &quot;96.5 The Buzz&quot;. The first song played on &quot;The Buzz&quot; was &quot;Learn To Fly&quot; by Foo Fighters. The call sign changed to KRBZ on August 25, 2000.

By 2002, KRBZ moved towards a hot adult contemporary format. However, the move failed, as the station fell to a 3.1 share of the market (15th place) by the spring of 2002.

On April 1, 2002, the station stunted as &quot;K-Gay 96.5&quot;, playing mostly dance music. The next day, it refocused as a modern AC station, as well as introducing a new morning show, &quot;The Kenny &amp; Afentra Showgram&quot;. Scott Geiger, known on the radio as Lazlo, was also hired in September 2002 to work nights. &quot;The Kenny &amp; Afentra Showgram&quot; morning show lasted until July 2003, when Kenny Holland was let go, and the show was re-branded as &quot;Afentra&#x27;s Big Fat Morning Buzz.&quot;

===Alterative rock===
By September 2003, the station completely shifted to a full-fledged alternative rock format, returning the format to the market for the first time since 1999, when KLZR shifted to Top 40/CHR and when KNRX dropped its alternative format for urban oldies.

Also in 2003, KRBZ was nearly pulled off the air when plans for sports station KCSP forced longtime country music station WDAF to look for an FM home. Fans gathered to &quot;Save The Buzz&quot;, showing a huge turnout and solidifying the station&#x27;s alternative format. Instead, WDAF moved to 106.5 FM, displacing KCIY, a smooth jazz station.

===Staff changes===
On June 1, 2006, afternoon host/program director Lazlo announced he was leaving the station to become program director of sister station KNDD in Seattle. His then-wife, Afentra, host of morning show &quot;Afentra&#x27;s Big Fat Morning Buzz,&quot; worked her last day from the studios in Kansas City on August 4, but continued to host mornings at KRBZ via satellite from her home in Seattle until November. Her co-hosts remained in Kansas City. Operations Manager Greg Bergen took over as program director in the wake of Lazlo&#x27;s exit. On September 8, morning co-host Danny Boi announced plans to leave the show and the station. He was replaced as co-host by Slimfast.

On November 10, 2006, it was announced that Lazlo, Afentra, and Slimfast would reunite on-air for &quot;The Church of Lazlo&quot;, which broadcast from Seattle on KNDD and simulcast on KRBZ. On February 12, 2007, &quot;The Dick Dale Show with Jessica Chase&quot; debuted as the station&#x27;s new morning show. Less than a month later, Chase quietly departed the station, ultimately being replaced by Kevin Quinn. On July 9, 2008, the morning show was disbanded with Dick Dale being let go from the station.

On July 17, 2008, Lazlo, Afentra, and Slimfast announced plans to end The Church of Lazlo&#x27;s run on KNDD. This came shortly after the announcement that former KRBZ Program Director Mike Kaplan would take over programming duties at KNDD.

On August 25, 2008, both &quot;Afentra&#x27;s Big Fat Morning Buzz&quot; and &quot;The Church of Lazlo&quot; returned live to Kansas City.

===Morning show controversy===
In 2014, the station was forced to pay $1 million in a defamation lawsuit that spawned from comments made on the morning show.

Afentra abruptly left the station on August 1, 2018, due to her contract not being renewed. Her co-hosts, Danny Boi and Mark Van Sickle, continued the morning show as &quot;Danny and Mark in the Morning&quot;. In 2022, Afentra would file an Equal Pay and Discrimination lawsuit against KRBZ for her termination.

On September 24, 2018, Jordin Silver joined Danny Boi and Mark on the morning show, and it was renamed &quot;Mornings with Jordin Silver and Friends&quot;. Silver previously worked at KYSR in Los Angeles and KNDD. Danny Boi and Mark eventually left the station.

===Alt 96.5===
On September 14, 2020, KRBZ rebranded as &quot;Alt 96.5.&quot; The move came after Entercom initiated airstaff cuts at their country and alternative formatted stations nationwide, which included morning host Jordin Silver (who would return to the station in April 2022 to host middays remotely from Los Angeles) and night host/&quot;The Church of Lazlo&quot; producer Hartzell Gray (who has since returned to Audacy) being let go. KRBZ began airing Stryker &amp; Klein (later renamed Klein &amp; Ally) and Megan Holiday from sister KROQ in Los Angeles for mornings and middays, and Kevan Kenney and Bryce Segall from WNYL in New York City for nights and overnights, respectively. In addition, &quot;The Church of Lazlo&quot; remained in afternoons, though it would be syndicated to sister stations in Dallas, Detroit, and Las Vegas; also, former midday host Jeriney became a co-host (she has since left the station, and has been replaced by former &quot;Church of Lazlo&quot; co-host Snowcone). In addition, longtime specialty programs such as &quot;Homegrown Buzz&quot;, &quot;Resurrection Sunday&quot;, &quot;Lazlo&#x27;s Hardrive&quot;, and &quot;Sonic Spectrum&quot; were dropped.

On November 15, 2021, KRBZ dropped Klein &amp; Ally, as the show ended syndication to focus on their local audience in Los Angeles. Mornings would run jockless until January 3, 2022, when KRBZ became an affiliate for &quot;Elliot in the Morning&quot;, based at Washington, D.C.&#x27;s WWDC. In August 2022, &quot;The Church of Lazlo&quot; stopped airing in syndication, but continues to air in afternoons on KRBZ. At the end of 2022, KRBZ dropped &quot;Elliot in the Morning&quot;; mornings would remain jockless for the remainder of the alternative format&#x27;s run.

===96.5 The Fan===
On August 8, 2024, at 10 a.m., Audacy announced that co-owned AM sports talk station KCSP would begin simulcasting on KRBZ beginning August 15, with the station rebranding as &quot;96.5 The Fan&quot;. Concurrent with the flip, KRBZ would take on new call sign KFNZ-FM. (In addition, KCSP would also adopt the KFNZ call letters to match.) With the move, KFNZ-FM became the exclusive FM home of the Kansas City Royals and would eventually add the Kansas City Chiefs, which had been on WDAF-FM. WDAF-FM will continue to air Chiefs games during the 2024 season, and some Royals games would remain solely on KFNZ (AM). The &quot;Church of Lazlo&quot; would immediately move to co-owned KQRC, with the show airing on both stations in the interim week as a transitionary move.

At 6 p.m. on August 14, following the end of that day&#x27;s &quot;Lazlo&quot; broadcast (and after playing &quot;Last Goodbye&quot; by Jeff Buckley; the last song as an alternative station prior to the Lazlo simulcast was Weezer’s &quot;Say It Ain&#x27;t So&quot;), both KRBZ and KCSP began stunting, running announcements teasing the new format and running podcast-style monologues on notable teams in Kansas City sports history, beginning and ending with the 2023 Chiefs winning Super Bowl LVIII. &quot;The Fan&quot; officially launched at 6 a.m. on August 15 on both 96.5 FM and 610 AM; by this time the KFNZ-FM call sign went into effect.

<doc id="844057" wikidata="Q4733508" url="?curid=844057" title="Alma the Younger">
<text>In the Book of Mormon, Alma, the son of Alma () is a Nephite prophet often referred to as Alma the Younger to distinguish him from his father, who is often referred to as Alma the Elder. These appellations, &quot;the Younger&quot; and &quot;the Elder,&quot; are not used in the Book of Mormon; they are distinctions made by scholars, useful because both individuals were prominent during the same time period in the Book of Mormon&#x27;s story and filled a similar cultural and religious role. Alma is the namesake of the Book of Alma.

==Conversion==

Alma the Younger lived in Zarahemla during the end of the reign of the Nephite King Mosiah. Adherents of the Latter Day Saint movement believe that he was born around 126 BC. As a young man, he, the four sons of Mosiah, and others wanted to destroy the church and actively persecuted its members. After they were visited personally by an angel and rebuked for their actions, Alma fell into an unconscious state where for three days and three nights he lay unable to move until he felt within that he had been forgiven of his sins. He later recounted that he had experienced a vision during unconsciousness, in which he renounced his behavior against the church and subsequently received a glimpse of God sitting on his throne (). He and those who persecuted church members with him abdicated their role as persecutors and became followers of Christ.

== Chief judge and high priest ==
Alma the Younger subsequently became the first elected chief judge of the Nephites as well as their religious leader.

When Amlici leads his followers in an insurrection against Nephite government, Alma as chief judge serves also as military commander and suppresses the Amlicites in the Amlicite Civil War.

== Ministry ==
He observed that the Nephites of the church were becoming increasingly wicked, proud, disdainful of outsiders and neglectful toward the poor and needy (). When the &quot;unbelievers&quot; began to follow their example, Alma feared the entire people were on the path to self-destruction (Alma 4:11). He resigned his post as chief judge and began traveling from city to city to preach to the Nephites. He began in Zarahemla, where his efforts were successful. A thorough purge of the church leadership and membership took place, with those former insiders and leaders who refused to relinquish their pride being &quot;rejected, and their names blotted out&quot; ().

Alma moved on to the cities of Gideon and Melek, where his call to humility was also well received. From Melek he traveled three days journey north to Ammonihah, whose inhabitants proved much more hardened than those of the previous three cities.

In Ammonihah the people were very wicked. They considered themselves superior to outsiders, especially the Lamanites, and gloried in the strength of their city, which they considered indestructible. According to Alma chapter 9, Satan held such control over them that they would not listen to Alma. While trying to speak to them he was abused and thrown out of the city. Commanded by an angel to return, Alma slipped back into the city through a different route from the south. There he met Amulek, a lapsed believer (Alma 10:5-6) of some social prominence who fed Alma and housed him for a time. In the city streets, the two of them joined up and preached to the people, where they were challenged by a lawyer named Zeezrom. After Amulek had silenced Zeezrom through his teaching and aroused his conscience, Alma took his turn, preaching to the people with similar results. When finished, Alma and Amulek were cast into prison and delivered by a miracle. A repentant Zeezrom eventually joined Alma in his missionary work.

Several years later, Alma met up with a man named Korihor, whom the Book of Mormon describes as an anti-Christ. This Korihor tried to lead the Nephites astray. Alma confronted him, confounding his arguments and miraculously removing Korihor&#x27;s power of speech. The stricken Korihor signaled acknowledgement that he had acted maliciously, knowing all along that he was wrong and bringing destruction upon others. He was reduced to begging and was eventually run down and killed in a city of Nephite dissenters called Zoramites.

These same Zoramites were found to practice things that perverted the ways of the Lord. This led Alma to extend his missionary work to these people. While among them, he was most successful with the poor.

Alma&#x27;s final instruction was to his sons, Helaman, Shiblon, and Corianton. He gave each separate lessons, and finally gave the records of the church to Helaman. He then departed, in the 19th year of the reign of the judges (or 73 BC) as if to go to Melek, but was never heard from again. Both Mormon and Helaman believed that he was taken up like Moses of old, and buried by the Lord.

==Descendants==
The Book of Mormon narrative describes several of Alma&#x27;s notable descendants as shown in the following family tree:






==Intertextuality==
Alma&#x27;s conversion is reminiscent of that of Saul of Tarsus, or Paul the Apostle, in the New Testament. Both persecute the Christian church, abruptly encounter divine figures (Jesus appears to Saul; an angel confronts Alma) that physically incapacitate them, and upon physically recovering subsequently convert and commit to Christianity. Literary critic Michael Austin explains that by coexisting, these stories &quot;encourage [readers] to universalize the possibility of conversion&quot; and focus on the role of grace in Christian life.

<text>Fulke Greville, 1st Baron Brooke (; 3 October 1554 – 30 September 1628) was an Elizabethan poet, dramatist, and statesman who served in the House of Commons at various times between 1581 and 1621, when he was raised to the peerage.

Greville was a capable administrator who served the English Crown under Elizabeth I and James I as, successively, treasurer of the navy, chancellor of the exchequer, and commissioner of the Treasury, and who for his services was in 1621 made Baron Brooke, peer of the realm. Greville was granted Warwick Castle in 1604, making numerous improvements. Greville is best known today as the biographer of Sir Philip Sidney, and for his sober poetry, which presents dark and thoughtful views on art, literature, beauty and other philosophical matters.

==Life==

Fulke Greville, born 3 October 1554, at Beauchamp Court, near Alcester, Warwickshire, was the only son of Sir Fulke Greville (1536–1606) and Anne Neville (d. 1583), the daughter of Ralph Neville, 4th Earl of Westmorland. He was the grandson of Sir Fulke Greville (d. 10 November 1559) and Elizabeth Willoughby (buried 15 November 1562), eldest daughter of Robert Willoughby, 2nd Baron Willoughby de Broke, the only other child of the marriage was a daughter, Margaret Greville (1561–1631/2), who married Sir Richard Verney.

He was sent in 1564, on the same day as his lifelong friend, Philip Sidney, to Shrewsbury School. He then went up to Jesus College, Cambridge in 1568.

Sir Henry Sidney, Philip&#x27;s father, and president of the Council of Wales and the Marches, gave Greville in 1576 a post connected with the court of the Welsh Marches, but Greville resigned it in 1577 to go to attend the court of Queen Elizabeth I along with Philip Sidney. There, Greville became a great favourite with the Queen, who valued his sober character and administrative skills. In 1581, he was elected in a by-election as Member of Parliament for Southampton. Queen Elizabeth made him secretary to the principality of Wales in 1583. However, he was put out of favour more than once for leaving the country against her wishes. 

In 1581 at a Whitehall tournament in honour of French ambassadors Greville, Philip Sidney, Philip Howard Earl of Arundel and Frederick Lord Windsor staged an entertainment as the &quot;Four Foster Children of Desire&quot;. The ambassadors were working on plans for Elizabeth&#x27;s marriage to Francis, Duke of Anjou. The &quot;Foster Children&quot; laid siege to the &quot;Fortress of Perfect Beautie&quot;. After two days of challenges the Children admitted defeat. The entertainment was understood to convey the idea that Elizabeth was unattainable, devised by the opposition to the French marriage.

Greville, Philip Sidney and Sir Edward Dyer were members of the &quot;Areopagus&quot;, the literary clique which, under the leadership of Gabriel Harvey, supported the introduction of classical metres into English verse. Sidney and Greville arranged to sail with Sir Francis Drake in 1585 in his expedition against the Spanish West Indies, but Elizabeth forbade Drake to take them with him, and also refused Greville&#x27;s request to be allowed to join Robert Dudley&#x27;s army in the Netherlands. Philip Sidney, who took part in the campaign, was killed on 17 October 1586. Greville memorialized his beloved friend in &quot;A Dedication to Sir Philip Sidney&quot;.

Greville participated in the Battle of Coutras in 1587. About 1591 Greville served further for a short time in Normandy under King Henry III of Navarre in the French Wars of Religion. This was his last experience of war.

Greville represented Warwickshire in parliament in 1592–1593, 1597, 1601 and 1621. In 1598 he was made Treasurer of the Navy, and he retained the office through the early years of the reign of James I.

Greville was granted Warwick Castle—situated on a bend of the River Avon in Warwickshire—by King James I in 1604. The castle was in a dilapidated condition when he took possession of it, and he spent £20,000 to restore it.

In 1614 he became chancellor and under-treasurer of the exchequer, and throughout the reign, he was a valued supporter of James I, although in 1615 he advocated the summoning of Parliament. In 1618 he became commissioner of the treasury, and in 1621 he was raised to the peerage with the title of Baron Brooke, a title which had belonged to the family of his paternal grandmother.

==Death and legacy==
On 1 September 1628 Greville was stabbed at his house in Holborn, London, by Ralph Haywood, a servant who believed that he had been cheated by being left out of his master&#x27;s will. Haywood then turned the knife on himself. Greville&#x27;s physicians treated his wounds by filling them with pig fat. Rather than disinfecting them, the pig fat turned rancid and infected the wounds, and he died in agony four weeks after the attack. His body was brought back to Warwick, and he was buried in the Collegiate Church of St Mary, Warwick, and on his tomb was inscribed the epitaph he had composed:
Greville has numerous streets named after him in the Hatton Garden area of Holborn, London (see Hatton Garden#Street names etymologies).

A line from &quot;Chorus Sacerdotum&quot; from &quot;Mustapha&quot; is quoted by Christopher Hitchens in his book Letters to a Young Contrarian.

In 2018 the first-ever festival dedicated to Greville was launched in his home town, Alcester, Warwickshire.

==Works==
Greville is best known for his biography of Sidney (composed c. 1610–12), which circulated in manuscript with the title &quot;A Dedication to Sir Philip Sidney&quot;. It was published in 1652 as &quot;The Life of the Renowned Sir Philip Sidney&quot;. He includes some autobiographical matter in what amounts to a treatise on government.

Greville&#x27;s poetry consists of closet tragedies, sonnets, and poems on political and moral subjects. His style is grave and sententious.

Greville&#x27;s works include:

A scholarly edition of his prose works, with an authoritative text, together with an introduction, commentary notes, and scholarly apparatus.

The principal repository for Fulke Greville&#x27;s papers is the British Library (Add MSS 54566-54571, the Warwick Manuscripts; letters in the as-yet uncatalogued Earl Cowper mss.). Individual manuscripts of the &quot;Dedication to Sir Philip Sidney&quot; are to be found at the Bodleian Library, Oxford (a manuscript formerly owned by Dr. B. E. Juel-Jensen); Trinity College, Cambridge (MSS R.7.32 and 33); and the Shrewsbury Library (MS 295).

==Critical reception==
Charles Lamb commented on Greville: &quot;He is nine parts Machiavel and Tacitus, for one of Sophocles and Seneca... Whether we look into his plays or his most passionate love-poems, we shall find all frozen and made rigid with intellect.&quot; He goes on to speak of the obscurity of expression that runs through all of Greville&#x27;s poetry.

Andrea McCrea sees the influence of Justus Lipsius in the &quot;Letter to an Honourable Lady&quot;, but elsewhere detects a scepticism more akin to Michel de Montaigne.

A rhyming elegy on Greville, published in Henry Huth&#x27;s &quot;Inedited Poetical Miscellanies&quot;, brings charges of miserliness against him.

Robert Pinsky has asserted that this work is comparable in force of imagination to John Donne.

==Family==
Lord Brooke, who never married, left no natural heirs, and his senior (Brooke) barony passed to his cousin and adopted son, Robert Greville (1608–1643), who took the side of Parliament in the English Civil War, and defeated the Royalists in a skirmish at Kineton in August 1642. 

Robert was killed during the siege of Lichfield on 2 March 1643, having survived the elder Greville by only fifteen years. 

His other barony (Willoughby de Broke) was inherited by his sister Margaret who married Sir Richard Verney. 

He is recently claimed to have been the lover of Philip Sidney, only on the evidence of a plan by Greville for a shared tomb with his lifelong friend.

<text>3-Methylenecyclopropene, also called methylenecyclopropene or triafulvene, is a hydrocarbon with chemical formula . It is a colourless gas that polymerizes readily as a liquid or in solution but is stable as a gas. This highly strained and reactive molecule was synthesized and characterized for the first time in 1984, and has been the subject of considerable experimental and theoretical interest. It is an example of a cross-conjugated alkene, being composed of cyclopropene with an exocyclic double bond attached. 

==Description==
Methylenecyclopropene is the smallest of the fulvenes (a family of unstable, cyclic molecules, conjugated transversally with an odd number of carbon atoms in the ring).

The structure of methylenecyclopropene has two interacting double bonds, which represents the simplest transversally conjugated π-bonding system. It is fundamentally not an alternant hydrocarbon. The value of its dipole moment (which is around four times that of pentafulvene) can be calculated by the Hückel method (HMO).

Its study has involved the use of isotopic isomers.

==Reactivity==
Most fulvenes are typically non-aromatic in nature (based on spectroscopic data), having properties closer to alkenes. In the case of tria- and pentafulvene, the possibility of dipole forms of resonance suggests an aromatic character to the cyclic structure; furthermore, as opposed to pentafulvene, one of the triafulvene resonance structures has a negative charge on the methylidene carbon.
Similarly to heptafulvene (fulvene containing a 7-atom cyclic ring), triafulvene polymerizes easily at −20 °C and is stabilized by electron-accepting groups bonded to the methylidene carbon atom.
