<text>Archie Bunker&#x27;s Place is an American television sitcom produced as a continuation of &quot;All in the Family&quot;. It aired on CBS from September 23, 1979 to April 4, 1983. While not as popular as its predecessor, the show maintained a large enough audience to last four seasons. It performed so well during its first season that it displaced &quot;Mork &amp; Mindy&quot; from its Sunday night time slot; a year earlier, during its first season, &quot;Mork &amp; Mindy&quot; had been the No. 3 show on television.

==Background==
Although the Bunker home, long familiar to viewers, continues to be featured, the scenes are primarily set in the title&#x27;s neighborhood tavern in Astoria, Queens, which Archie Bunker (Carroll O&#x27;Connor) purchased in the eighth-season premiere of &quot;All in the Family&quot;. During the first season as &quot;Archie Bunker&#x27;s Place&quot;, Bunker takes on a Jewish partner, Murray Klein (Martin Balsam), when co-owner Harry Snowden decides to sell his share of the business. Early in the first season, to increase business, Archie and Murray build a restaurant onto the bar: the additions include a separate seating area for the restaurant and a well-equipped kitchen with a service window. Regular patrons include Barney Hefner, Hank Pivnik, and Edgar Van Ranseleer. 

Archie Bunker&#x27;s Place is the sounding board for Archie&#x27;s views, support from his friends, and Murray&#x27;s counterpoints. Later in the series, after Murray remarries and leaves for San Francisco, Archie has one of his attorneys, Gary Rabinowitz (Barry Gordon), take on the role of business manager. Gary&#x27;s views are liberal, in contrast to Archie&#x27;s conservatism.

==Jean Stapleton==

In December 1978, Jean Stapleton announced that she did not want to renew her contract at the end of the ongoing ninth season. She felt her character, Edith Bunker, had run its course on the show. At that time, Norman Lear, the creator of &quot;All in the Family&quot;, wanted the series to end while it was still on top in ratings and critical reception. But Robert Daly, then vice president of CBS Television, persuaded Carroll O’Connor to continue with &quot;All in the Family&quot; for at least another year. Daly felt that since the show was still garnering high ratings, it was still valuable to the network and could run at least another year. Since Lear was insistent on ending the program, Daly asked O’Connor to get Lear to reconsider. After meeting with O’Connor, Lear agreed to let the show&#x27;s characters continue but refused to allow the series to be called &quot;All in the Family&quot; anymore. 

As a result, &quot;Archie Bunker’s Place&quot; was created and the show&#x27;s plots centered less on Archie&#x27;s home life and more on his bar and his colleagues and patrons who frequented it. To help with this transition, Stapleton agreed to play Edith on the newly titled series in five appearances during the 1979–80 season. At the start of the next (1980–81) season, Edith died (off screen) and was written out of the series.

==Characters==
* Carroll O&#x27;Connor as Archie Bunker, a blue-collar worker whose ignorant stubbornness tends to cause his arguments to self-destruct. By the time of &quot;Archie Bunker&#x27;s Place,&quot; however, the character has mellowed somewhat and is no longer as explicitly bigoted as he had been during the first seasons of &quot;All in the Family,&quot; even agreeing to go into business with Murray, who is Jewish, and becoming close friends with him.
* Jean Stapleton continued to play Archie&#x27;s wife Edith Bunker when &quot;Archie Bunker&#x27;s Place&quot; premiered. The show featured Edith five times during the first 14 episodes of the first season, but Stapleton decided to leave the series late in 1979; her character was referred to but unseen during most of the 1979–80 season. The writers and producers addressed Stapleton&#x27;s departure in the Season 2 premiere, explaining that Edith had died of a stroke. Archie reflected on his wife&#x27;s death and eventually began dating again.
* Martin Balsam as Murray Klein (1979–81). Murray was Archie&#x27;s Jewish partner, who held liberal views similar to those of Archie&#x27;s son-in-law Michael Stivic. Unlike Mike, Murray was much more tolerant and patient with Archie&#x27;s views.
* Danielle Brisebois as Stephanie Mills, the Jewish daughter of Edith&#x27;s step-cousin, Floyd Mills. Archie and Edith take Stephanie in after her father, a chronic, unemployed drunk, abandoned her during the final season of &quot;All in the Family.&quot; Stephanie, 10 years old at the start of the series, loved to sing and dance, and her talents were showcased in several episodes.
* Celeste Holm as Estelle Harris (1981–83), Stephanie&#x27;s wealthy maternal grandmother, who would often be at odds with Archie over his rearing of Stephanie.
* Allan Melvin as Barney Hefner, Archie&#x27;s best friend and a regular at the bar. Their friendship was first established in 1972 during an episode of &quot;All in the Family.&quot; Barney was married to a friend of Edith&#x27;s named Blanche (played by Estelle Parsons) (although in earlier seasons she was called Mabel). Blanche left Barney numerous times before the couple divorced in 1979, and Barney was ordered to pay alimony.
* Danny Dayton as Hank Pivnik, another regular. He first appeared in 1976 on &quot;All in the Family.&quot; Hank disappeared without explanation after the 1979–80 season.
* Bill Quinn as Edgar Van Ranseleer (a.k.a. &quot;Mr. Van R&quot;), a former schoolteacher and regular at the bar. He was blind, and usually even-tempered. He was very rarely referred to by his first name—almost everyone called him Mr. Van Ranseleer or Mr. Van R. His first appearance was in 1978 on &quot;All in the Family&quot;.
* Jason Wingreen as Harry Snowden, Archie&#x27;s former business partner, who continued to work at the tavern as a bartender. Another holdover character from &quot;All in the Family&quot;, which Wingreen joined in 1976.
*Abraham Alvarez and Joe Rosario as Jose Perez and Raoul Rosario, two Latin-American immigrants employed as assistant cooks at Archie&#x27;s bar. Archie later learns they are illegal immigrants after they refuse to give a statement to police after having witnessed a mugging.
* Anne Meara as Veronica Rooney (1979–82), the cook at Archie Bunker&#x27;s Place. She often made wisecracks and gave Archie a hard time. She insisted that Archie also hire her openly gay nephew Fred as a waiter to help him pay for law school. She was an alcoholic and privately pined to reconcile with her ex-husband, Carmine (who appeared in a few episodes and was played by Meara&#x27;s real-life husband Jerry Stiller), but knew it wasn&#x27;t going to happen. Meara appeared sporadically throughout the show&#x27;s third season and left the show before the fourth and final season.
* Dean Scofield (1979–80) as Fred Rooney, a gay waiter, and Veronica&#x27;s nephew. Quits because of Archie&#x27;s attitude toward his personal life.
* Barbara Meek as Ellen Canby (1980–82). Ellen was a black housekeeper who was hired by Archie after Edith&#x27;s death. She also took care of Stephanie, and helped keep Archie&#x27;s tongue in check. Though Archie still harbored some prejudice toward black people by the time she arrived on the scene, he deeply respected Ellen and was grateful for the job she did in helping to raise Stephanie.
* Denise Miller, who joined the cast in 1981 as Archie&#x27;s 18-year-old niece, Barbara Lee &quot;Billie&quot; Bunker. Billie—who worked as a waitress at Archie Bunker&#x27;s Place—was the daughter of Archie&#x27;s estranged brother Fred. Her principal love interest was Gary Rabinowitz (see below).
* Barry Gordon (another 1981 addition to the cast) as Jewish lawyer and business manager Gary Rabinowitz. Gary quickly began dating Billie, who was 15 years younger than he. Just like Mike Stivic and Murray Klein before him, Gary&#x27;s liberal beliefs often contrasted with those of staunchly conservative Archie.
* Sally Struthers returned as Archie&#x27;s daughter Gloria Stivic for several episodes. In addition to the 1979 episode &quot;Thanksgiving Reunion,&quot; Struthers returned in the 1982 two-part episode &quot;Gloria Comes Home,&quot; where she returns from California with her son, Joey after divorcing her husband, Mike (who had run off to a commune in Humboldt County, California, with a college student). The character eventually moved on to her own spin-off series, &quot;Gloria&quot;. (Note: The original unaired pilot episode to the TV series, which begins with a short appearance by Carroll O&#x27;Connor as Archie Bunker, was later repackaged as an &quot;Archie Bunker&#x27;s Place&quot; episode.)

==Production==
Unlike &quot;All in the Family&quot;, which took place largely in the Bunker family home, &quot;Archie Bunker&#x27;s Place&quot; was set primarily in the local tavern Archie owned, and was videotaped with the shot of a closed set with multiple cameras, with the best takes being edited together using a laugh track instead of a live studio audience. The finished product was then shown to live audiences attending tapings of &quot;One Day at a Time&quot;, thus providing a laugh track from real laughter for the show.

Production of all seasons of &quot;Archie Bunker&#x27;s Place&quot; took place at Studios 31 &amp; Bob Barker Studio at Television City Studios in Hollywood, the original production home of &quot;All in the Family&quot; for that show&#x27;s first six seasons.

The theme song for &quot;Archie Bunker&#x27;s Place&quot; was a re-scored instrumental version by Ray Conniff of &quot;Those Were the Days,&quot; the long-familiar opening theme to &quot;All in the Family&quot;. The closing theme, &quot;Remembering You,&quot; was a re-scored version of &quot;All in the Family&#x27;s&quot; closing theme. Both versions featured a Dixieland-styled arrangement. The opening credits featured a view of the Queensboro Bridge, which connects Manhattan to Queens, followed by shots taken along Steinway Street in Astoria.

Carroll O&#x27;Connor was frustrated over the cancellation when the show did not have an appropriate closure. He vowed never to work in any type of show with CBS again. He would later work for CBS again when he starred in &quot;In the Heat of the Night&quot;; when NBC decided not to renew the series it moved to CBS who allowed the series to continue for two more years and have a proper ending.

The series was briefly rerun on TV Land in 2002 and 2003, including the unaired &quot;Gloria&quot; pilot. The last episode did air in a marathon along with the final episodes of &quot;All in the Family&quot;, &quot;The Jeffersons&quot; and &quot;Gloria&quot;. The series is currently shown on Antenna TV as of August 2018.

Whereas &quot;All in the Family&quot; had been inspired by a British series, &quot;Till Death Us Do Part&quot;, the British series would later get a sequel; first, the short-lived &quot;Till Death...&quot;, and then &quot;In Sickness and in Health&quot;. Dandy Nichols, who had played Else Garnett (the British inspiration for Edith Bunker), coincidentally died after the first season of &quot;In Sickness and in Health&quot;, and the second-season premiere (strongly paralleling &quot;Archie Alone&quot;) deals with her widower Alf Garnett dealing with grief in much the same way as Archie did with Edith&#x27;s death.

==Episodes==

==Notable episodes==
The series&#x27; most notable episode among critics was &quot;Archie Alone,&quot; which originally aired November 2, 1980, as a one-hour special to open the second season of the series. In that episode, viewers learn that Edith had died of a stroke a month earlier (Jean Stapleton had resigned from her role), and Archie is unable to grieve. His refusal to let go of his emotions takes its toll on Stephanie, until one day Archie finds a single slipper of Edith&#x27;s (overlooked when her clothes were collected for charity) in the bedroom. Holding the shoe, Archie laments aloud that Edith slipped away before he could tell her he loved her, and finally breaks down and cries. Later, after a talk with Stephanie, he agrees to take her to visit Edith&#x27;s grave, fulfilling the request Stephanie had made to Archie at the beginning of the episode. The British TV series &quot;In Sickness and in Health,&quot; the continuation of &quot;Till Death Us Do Part&quot; on which &quot;All in the Family&quot; was based, had a similar episode in which Edith&#x27;s British counterpart, Else Garnett, had died from natural causes. This was not a case of one series copying another; both series were forced to write these deaths due to unexpected departures by the actresses (Stapleton&#x27;s resignation and Dandy Nichols&#x27; death).

The first-season episode &quot;Thanksgiving Reunion&quot; marked the final time the original ensemble from &quot;All in the Family&quot;—O&#x27;Connor, Stapleton, Sally Struthers and Rob Reiner—appeared together. In that episode, Mike announces that he has lost his job as a college professor after his participation in a nude protest of a proposed nuclear power plant became public. This puts a further strain on his already troubled marriage to Gloria (who at the episode&#x27;s end lets it slip to Archie that Mike participated only because Gloria did not want to march alone), and foreshadows the Stivics&#x27; divorce.

Another notable episode was &quot;The Return of Sammy,&quot; when Sammy Davis Jr. comes to the bar and restaurant after Archie calls his talk show. He, like Murray, is surprised that Archie has a Jewish niece. Later, when Sammy chokes on some food, Archie uses the Heimlich maneuver to save Sammy&#x27;s life. At the end of the episode, Archie and Stephanie simultaneously kiss Sammy, contrasting what happened in the parent show&#x27;s episode &quot;Sammy&#x27;s Visit.&quot;

In a special 1982 episode, which aired immediately after the Super Bowl, baseball superstar Reggie Jackson almost sues Archie, but decides not to when Jackson realizes the bad press would hurt his career.

Later, comedian Don Rickles guest-starred as a crusty boarder named Al Snyder, who rented a room from Archie&#x27;s friend and neighbor Barney, whose wife Blanche had left him sometime earlier. Highlights of this episode are exchanges combining Rickles&#x27; insult humor and his character&#x27;s curmudgeonly disposition with Archie&#x27;s sincere but misguided efforts to resolve disputes between Snyder and Barney. Eventually, the Rickles character is exhausted by the constant chatter, takes his medication (again), and decides to rest. The Rickles character drifts off to sleep and dies. The episode ends with Barney pondering whether he will wind up like Mr. Snyder: &quot;Sore at the world, &#x27;cause I&#x27;m all alone.&quot;

=== Archie&#x27;s last appearance ===
The last scene in which Archie Bunker ever appears comes in the episode, &quot;I&#x27;m Torn Here&quot; (season 4, episode 24; airdate April 4, 1983).  He is at the bar with bartender Harry Snowden and regular patron Mr. Van Ranseleer, recounting a dream he had:&quot;Archie:&quot;  &quot;So, at the end of the dream, the president Reagan] ushers me right into the Oval Office.&quot;

&quot;Mr. Van R:&quot;  &quot;What happened?&quot;

&quot;Archie:&quot; &quot;Well, sitting around on the floor is the 20 mules from the &quot;Death Valley Days&quot;.&quot;

&quot;Mr. Van R:&quot;  &quot;Sounds like his Cabinet.&quot;

&quot;Archie:&quot; &quot;Jeez, I guess that&#x27;s who they was because one of &#x27;em takes off his nosebag -- and it&#x27;s [then-vice president] George Bush!  And he says the way to tame El Salvador is to make the damn place into the 49th state.&quot;

&quot;Mr. Van R: &quot;&quot;Was there any music in this dream?&quot;

&quot;Archie:&quot; &quot;No, but there was a toilet flush.  That&#x27;s what woke me up.&quot;

==Home media and streaming==
Sony Pictures Home Entertainment released The Complete First Season of &quot;Archie Bunker&#x27;s Place&quot; on DVD in North America on January 31, 2006. On August 27, 2013, it was announced that Mill Creek Entertainment had acquired the home media rights to various television series from the Sony Pictures library including &quot;Archie Bunker&#x27;s Place&quot;. On July 7, 2015, Mill Creek re-released the first season on DVD. In 2022, the complete series was made available for streaming in Canada on CTV.

As of 2023, reruns of &quot;Archie Bunker&#x27;s Place&quot; have aired on Antenna TV.
==Cultural references==
&quot;Eulogy and Tavern,&quot; the 12th chapter (Chapter 4, Part 3) of Jonathan Lethem&#x27;s novel &quot;Dissident Gardens&quot;, is set within the world of the television show. One of the book&#x27;s main characters, Rose, begins frequenting a bar called Kelcy&#x27;s on Northern Boulevard near her home in Sunnyside Gardens, Queens, where she befriends the owner, Archie Bunker, and eventually tries to seduce him with her old Communist rhetoric. (&quot;Your lifelong dream, Archie, only you don&#x27;t know it. Hump a hot Red.&quot;) The chapter includes appearances by series-regulars Barney Hefner, Hank Pivnik, Edgar Van Ranseleer, Harry Snowden and Stephanie Mills.

<text>Greater Israel (, &quot;Eretz Yisrael HaShlema&quot;) is an expression with several different biblical and political meanings over time. It is often used, in an irredentist fashion, to refer to the historic or desired borders of Israel.

There are two different primary uses of the term– one referring more narrowly to the area internationally recognized as part of the State of Israel along with the Golan Heights, West Bank, and Gaza Strip; and a second definition referring to the much larger region stretching from the river Nile to the Euphrates.

== History ==
=== Promised Land ===

The Bible contains three geographical definitions of the Land of Israel:

# The first definition () seems to define the land that was given to all of the children of Abram (Abraham), including Ishmael, Zimran, Jokshan, Midian, etc. It describes a large territory, &quot;from the brook of Egypt to the Euphrates&quot;.
# A narrower definition ( and ) refers to the land that was divided between the original Twelve tribes of Israel after they were delivered from Egypt.
# A wider definition (, ) indicating the territory that will be given to the children of Israel slowly throughout the years, as explained in and ).

===Land of Israel===
The Land of Israel () is the traditional Jewish name for an area of the Southern Levant. Related biblical, religious and historical English terms include the Land of Canaan, the Promised Land, the Holy Land, and Palestine. The definitions of the limits of this territory vary between passages in the Hebrew Bible, with specific mentions in Genesis 15, Exodus 23, Numbers 34 and Ezekiel 47. Nine times elsewhere in the Bible, the settled land is referred as &quot;from Dan to Beersheba&quot;, and three times it is referred as &quot;from the entrance of Hamath unto the brook of Egypt&quot; (1 Kings 8:65, 1 Chronicles 13:5 and 2 Chronicles 7:8).

These biblical limits for the land differ from the borders of established historical Israelite and later Jewish kingdoms, including the United Kingdom of Israel, the two kingdoms of Israel (Samaria) and Judah, the Hasmonean Kingdom, and the Herodian kingdom. At their heights, these realms ruled lands with similar but not identical boundaries.

Judaism defines the land as where Jewish religious law prevailed and excludes territory where it was not applied. It holds that the area is a God-given inheritance of the Jewish people based on the Torah, particularly the books of Genesis, Exodus, Numbers and Deuteronomy, as well as Joshua and the later Prophets. According to the Book of Genesis, the land was first promised by God to Abram&#x27;s descendants; the text is explicit that this is a covenant between God and Abram for his descendants. Abram&#x27;s name was later changed to Abraham, with the promise refined to pass through his son Isaac and to the Israelites, descendants of Jacob, Abraham&#x27;s grandson.

===Kingdom of Israel===
* The Kingdom of Israel (united monarchy) (1047–931 BCE), was the kingdom established by the Israelites and uniting them under a single king. 
* The Kingdom of Israel (northern kingdom) (930–c.720 BCE), was the kingdom of northern Israel after the breakup of the united monarchy of the Kingdom of Israel.
* The Kingdom of Judah (930–587 BCE), was the southern Jewish kingdom after the breakup of the united monarchy of the Kingdom of Israel.

===Second Temple period===
Return to Zion (, , ) is an event recorded in Ezra–Nehemiah of the Hebrew Bible, in which the Jews of the Kingdom of Judah—subjugated by the Neo-Babylonian Empire—were freed from the Babylonian captivity following the Persian conquest of Babylon. In 539 BCE, the Persian king Cyrus the Great issued the Edict of Cyrus allowing the Jews to return to Jerusalem and the Land of Judah, which was made into a self-governing Jewish province known as Yehud under the new Persian Achaemenid Empire.

The Second Temple period or post-exilic period in Jewish history denotes the approximately 600 years (516 BCE–70 CE) during which the Second Temple stood in the city of Jerusalem. It began with the return to Zion and subsequent reconstruction of the Temple in Jerusalem, and ended with the First Jewish–Roman War and the Roman siege of Jerusalem.

===Palestine under British rule 1917–1948===

====Balfour Declaration====

The Balfour Declaration was a public statement issued by the British Government in 1917 during the First World War announcing its support for the establishment of a &quot;national home for the Jewish people&quot; in Palestine, then an Ottoman region with a small minority Jewish population. The declaration was contained in a letter dated 2November 1917 from the United Kingdom&#x27;s Foreign Secretary Arthur Balfour to Lord Rothschild, a leader of the British Jewish community, for transmission to the Zionist Federation of Great Britain and Ireland. The text of the declaration was published in the press on 9November 1917.

On the military front in Palestine, the Sinai and Palestine campaign was part of the Middle Eastern theatre of World War I, taking place between January 1915 and October 1918. It brought Palestine under British control that ended with the Armistice of Mudros in 1918, leading to the cession of Ottoman Syria that included most of western Palestine.

====During British Mandate for Palestine====

Early Revisionist Zionist groups such as Betar and Irgun Zvai-Leumi regarded the territory of the Mandate for Palestine, including Transjordan, as Greater Israel.

In 1937, the Peel Commission recommended partition of Mandatory Palestine. In a letter to his son later that year, David Ben-Gurion stated that partition would be acceptable but as a first step. Ben-Gurion wrote that 
 The same sentiment was recorded by Ben-Gurion on other occasions, such as at a meeting of the Jewish Agency executive in June 1938, as well as by Chaim Weizmann. Ben Gurion said:

=== During early period of the State of Israel ===
Joel Greenberg writing in &quot;The New York Times&quot; notes: &quot;At Israel&#x27;s founding in 1948, the Labor Zionist leadership, which went on to govern Israel in its first three decades of independence, accepted a pragmatic partition of what had been British Palestine into independent Jewish and Arab states. The opposition Revisionist Zionists, who evolved into today&#x27;s Likud party, sought &quot;Eretz Yisrael Ha-Shlema&quot;—Greater Israel, or literally, the Whole Land of Israel (shalem, meaning complete).&quot; The capture of the West Bank and Gaza Strip from Jordan and Egypt during the Six-Day War in 1967 led to the growth of the non-parliamentary Movement for Greater Israel and the construction of Israeli settlements. The 1977 elections, which brought Likud to power also had considerable impact on acceptance and rejection of the term. Greenberg notes: THE seed was sown in 1977, when Menachem Begin of Likud brought his party to power for the first time in a stunning election victory over Labor. A decade before, in the 1967 war, Israeli troops had in effect undone the partition accepted in 1948 by overrunning the West Bank and Gaza Strip. Ever since, Mr. Begin had preached undying loyalty to what he called Judea and Samaria (the West Bank lands) and promoted Jewish settlement there. But he did not annex the West Bank and Gaza to Israel after he took office, reflecting a recognition that absorbing the Palestinians could turn Israel into a bi-national state instead of a Jewish one.

Yitzhak Shamir was a dedicated proponent of Greater Israel and as Israeli Prime Minister gave the settler movement funding and Israeli governmental legitimisation.

===Movement for Greater Israel===
The Movement for Greater Israel (, &quot;HaTenu&#x27;a Lema&#x27;an Eretz Yisrael HaSheleima&quot;), also known as the Land of Israel Movement, was a political organisation in Israel during the 1960s and 1970s which subscribed to an ideology of Greater Israel. The organization was formed in July 1967, a month after Israel captured the Gaza Strip, the Sinai Peninsula, the West Bank, and the Golan Heights in the Six-Day War. It called on the Israeli government to keep the captured areas and to settle them with Jewish populations.

==Today==
===Inclusion of occupied West Bank and Gaza===

Annexation of the West Bank and Gaza Strip was part of the platform of the mainstream Israeli Likud party, and of some other, often more extreme Israeli political parties. On September 14, 2008, Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Olmert, formerly of Likud, remarked that &quot;Greater Israel is over. There is no such thing. Anyone who talks that way is deluding themselves&quot;, making this statement just two days before privately reaching out to the Palestinian President with Israel&#x27;s broadest ever peace offer.

Meir Kahane, an ultra-nationalist Knesset member, who founded the American Jewish Defense League and the banned Israeli Kach party, worked towards Greater Israel and other Religious Zionist goals. Kach, Tehiya, and the National Religious Party are parties which supported the idea of a Greater Israel.

Currently in Israel, in the debate relating to the borders of Israel, &quot;Greater Israel&quot; is generally used to refer to the territory of the State of Israel and the Palestinian territories, the combined territory of the former Mandatory Palestine without Trans-Jordan (already separated from Palestine by the British in the early 1920s). However, because of the controversial nature of the term, the term Land of Israel is often used instead.

In March 2023, the Israeli Finance Minister Bezalel Smotrich, leader of the far-right National Religious Party–Religious Zionism, spoke at a Paris memorial behind a podium featuring a &#x27;Greater Israel&#x27; map including Trans-Jordan. This speech has led to tensions with Jordan, while his spokesperson attributed the symbol&#x27;s presence to the organizers of the event, which was dedicated to a man connected to the Irgun (see above for Irgun emblem). In response to the diplomatic controversy, Israel&#x27;s Foreign Ministry stated that Israel adheres to the 1994 peace treaty and respects Jordan&#x27;s sovereignty.

===In academia===
Hillel Weiss, a professor at Bar-Ilan University, has promoted the &quot;necessity&quot; of rebuilding the Temple and of Jewish rule over Greater Israel.

== Conspiracy theories ==
=== 10 agorot coin controversy ===

Zionists, and the State of Israel, have been accused of plotting to expand Israel from the Nile to the Euphrates. This so-called 10 agorot controversy is named after the Israeli coin brandished by PLO chairman Yasser Arafat in 1988 as evidence for this accusation. The Bank of Israel denies this conspiracy theory since the coin is a replica of a historical coin dating from 37 to 40 BCE and the alleged &quot;map&quot; is actually the irregular shape of the ancient coin.

=== Israeli flag controversy ===
Conspiracy theorists have suggested the blue strips of the Israeli flag represent the Nile and Euphrates as the boundaries of Eretz Isra&#x27;el as promised to the Jews by God according to religious scripture. This claim was at a time made by Yasser Arafat, Iran and Hamas. However, Danny Rubinstein points out that &quot;Arafat ... added, in interviews that he gave in the past, that the two blue stripes on the Israeli flag represent the Nile and the Euphrates. ... No Israeli, even those who demonstrate understanding for Palestinian distress, will accept the ... nonsense about the blue stripes on the flag, which was designed according to the colours of the traditional tallit (prayer shawl) ...&quot;

<doc id="803754" wikidata="Q404517" url="?curid=803754" title="Kargil War">
<text>The Kargil War, also known as the Kargil conflict, was fought between India and Pakistan from May to July 1999 in the Kargil district of Ladakh (erstwhile Jammu and Kashmir) and elsewhere along the Line of Control (LoC). In India, the conflict is also referred to as Operation Vijay (, ), which was the codename of the Indian military operation in the region. The Indian Air Force acted jointly with the Indian Army to flush out the Pakistan Army and paramilitary troops from vacated Indian positions along the LoC, in what was designated as Operation Safed Sagar (, ).

The conflict was triggered by the infiltration of Pakistani troops—disguised as Kashmiri militants—into strategic positions on the Indian side of the LoC, which serves as the &quot;de facto&quot; border between the two countries in the disputed region of Kashmir. During its initial stages, Pakistan blamed the fighting entirely on independent Kashmiri insurgents, but documents left behind by casualties and later statements by Pakistan&#x27;s Prime Minister and Chief of Army Staff showed the involvement of Pakistani paramilitary forces, led by General Ashraf Rashid. The Indian Army, later supported by the Indian Air Force, recaptured a majority of the positions on the Indian side of the LoC; facing international diplomatic opposition, Pakistani forces withdrew from all remaining Indian positions along the LoC.

The Kargil War is the most recent example of high-altitude warfare in mountainous terrain, and as such, posed significant logistical problems for the combatting sides. It also marks one of only two instances of conventional warfare between nuclear-armed states (alongside the Sino-Soviet border conflict). India had conducted its first successful test in 1974; Pakistan, which had been developing its nuclear capability in secret since around the same time, conducted its first known tests in 1998, just two weeks after a second series of tests by India.

==Location==
Before the Partition of India in 1947, Kargil was a tehsil of Ladakh, a sparsely populated region with diverse linguistic, ethnic and religious groups, living in isolated valleys separated by some of the world&#x27;s highest mountains. The Indo-Pakistani War of 1947-1948 concluded with the Line of Control bisecting the Ladakh district, with the Skardu tehsil going to Pakistan (now part of Gilgit-Baltistan). After Pakistan&#x27;s defeat in the Indo-Pakistani War of 1971, the two nations signed the Simla Agreement promising not to engage in armed conflict with respect to that boundary.

The town of Kargil is located from Srinagar, facing the Northern Areas across the LOC. Like other areas in the Himalayas, Kargil has a continental climate. Summers are cool with frigid nights, while winters are long and chilly with temperatures often dropping to .

An Indian national highway (NH 1) connecting Srinagar to Leh cuts through Kargil. The military outposts on the ridges above the highway were generally around high, with a few as high as . The rough terrain and narrow roads slowed down traffic, and the high altitude, which affected the ability of aircraft to carry loads, made control of NH 1 (the actual stretch of the highway which was under Pakistani fire) a priority for India. From their 130+ covertly occupied observation posts, the occupants had a clear line-of-sight. 

Kargil was targeted partly because the terrain was conducive to the preemptive seizure of several unoccupied military positions. With tactically vital features and well-prepared defensive posts atop the peaks, a defender on the high ground would enjoy advantages akin to that of a fortress. Any attack to dislodge a defender from high ground in mountain warfare requires a far higher ratio of attackers to defenders, and the difficulties would be exacerbated by the high altitude and freezing temperatures.

Kargil is just from the Pakistani-controlled town of Skardu, which was capable of providing logistical and artillery support to Pakistani combatants. A road between Kargil and Skardu exists, which was closed in 1949.

==Background==
After the Indo-Pakistani war of 1971, there had been a long period with relatively few direct armed conflicts involving the military forces of the two neighbours—notwithstanding the efforts of both nations to control the Siachen Glacier by establishing military outposts on the surrounding mountains ridges and the resulting military skirmishes in the 1980s. During the 1990s, however, escalating tensions and conflict due to separatist activities in Kashmir, some of which were supported by Pakistan, as well as the conducting of nuclear tests by both countries in 1998, led to an increasingly belligerent atmosphere. In an attempt to defuse the situation, both countries signed the Lahore Declaration in February 1999, promising to provide a peaceful and bilateral solution to the Kashmir conflict.

During the winter of 1998–1999, some elements of the Pakistani Armed Forces were covertly training and sending Pakistani troops and paramilitary forces, some allegedly in the guise of mujahideen, into territory on the Indian side of the LOC. The infiltration was codenamed &quot;Operation Badr&quot;; its aim was to sever the link between Kashmir and Ladakh, and cause Indian forces to withdraw from the Siachen Glacier, thus forcing India to negotiate a settlement of the broader Kashmir dispute. Pakistan also believed that any tension in the region would internationalise the Kashmir issue, helping it to secure a speedy resolution. Yet another goal may have been to boost the morale of the decade-long rebellion in Jammu and Kashmir by taking a proactive role.

Pakistani Lieutenant General Shahid Aziz, and then head of ISI analysis wing, has confirmed there were no mujahideen but only regular Pakistan Army soldiers who took part in the Kargil War. &quot;There were no Mujahideen, only taped wireless messages, which fooled no one. Our soldiers were made to occupy barren ridges, with hand held weapons and ammunition&quot;, Lt Gen Aziz wrote in his article in &quot;The Nation&quot; daily in January 2013.

Some writers have speculated that the operation&#x27;s objective may also have been retaliation for India&#x27;s Operation Meghdoot in 1984 that seized much of Siachen Glacier.

According to India&#x27;s then army chief (COAS) Ved Prakash Malik, and many scholars, much of the background planning, including construction of logistical supply routes, had been undertaken much earlier. On several occasions during the 1980s and 1990s, the army had given Pakistani leaders (Zia ul Haq and Benazir Bhutto) similar proposals for infiltration into the Kargil region, but the plans had been shelved for fear of drawing the nations into all-out war.

Some analysts believe that the blueprint of attack was reactivated soon after Pervez Musharraf was appointed chief of army staff in October 1998. After the war, Nawaz Sharif, Prime Minister of Pakistan during the Kargil conflict, claimed that he was unaware of the plans, and that he first learned about the situation when he received an urgent phone call from Atal Bihari Vajpayee, his counterpart in India. Sharif attributed the plan to Musharraf and &quot;just two or three of his cronies&quot;, a view shared by some Pakistani writers who have stated that only four generals, including Musharraf, knew of the plan. Musharraf, however, asserted that Sharif had been briefed on the Kargil operation 15 days ahead of Vajpayee&#x27;s journey to Lahore on 20 February.

== Occupation by Pakistan ==
During February 1999, the Pakistan Army sent forces to occupy some posts on the Indian side of the LOC. Troops from the elite Special Services Group as well as four to seven battalions of the Northern Light Infantry (a paramilitary regiment not part of the regular Pakistani army at that time) covertly and overtly set up bases on 132 vantage points of the Indian-controlled region. According to some reports, these Pakistani forces were backed by Kashmiri guerrillas and Afghan mercenaries. According to General Ved Malik, the bulk of the infiltration occurred in April.

Pakistani intrusions took place in the heights of the lower Mushkoh Valley, along the Marpo La ridgeline in Dras, in Kaksar near Kargil, in the Batalik sector east of the Indus River, on the heights above of the Chorbat La sector where the LOC turns North and in the Turtuk sector south of the Siachen area.

== Discovery of infiltration and mobilisation ==
Initially, these incursions were not detected for a number of reasons: Indian patrols were not sent into some of the areas infiltrated by the Pakistani forces and heavy artillery fire by Pakistan in some areas provided cover for the infiltrators. But by the second week of May, the ambushing of an Indian patrol team led by Capt Saurabh Kalia, who acted on a tip-off by a local shepherd in the Batalik sector, led to the exposure of the infiltration. Initially, with little knowledge of the nature or extent of the infiltration, the Indian troops in the area assumed that the infiltrators were jihadis and claimed that they would evict them within a few days. At the time of the discovery of these attacks, COAS of Indian Army Gen V. P. Malik was on a visit to Poland and was receiving information regarding the discoveries. On 12 May, the estimate reported by the DGMO to Gen Malik was &quot;some militants&quot; but by 15 May, the estimate had risen to 250-300. The 8 Mountain Division under the command of Maj Gen Mohinder Puri was mobilized to be ready for engagement. The estimate grew to over a 1000 by 21 May.

The true scale of the incursions was only recognized by the high command after the CCS meeting on 18 May after which heavy mobilization began and division level movement was ordered. Several divisions were ordered to halt counterinsurgency activity and position to engage the infiltrators. The total area seized by the ingress is generally accepted to between .

The clear line of sight provided by the ridges was a serious problem for the Indian Army as the highway was the main logistical and supply route. The Pakistani shelling of the arterial road threatened to cut Leh off, though an alternative (and longer) road to Leh existed via Himachal Pradesh, the Leh–Manali Highway.

The infiltrators, apart from being equipped with small arms and grenade launchers, were also armed with mortars, artillery and anti-aircraft guns. Many posts were also heavily mined, with India later stating to have recovered more than 8,000 anti-personnel mines according to an ICBL report. Pakistan&#x27;s reconnaissance was done through unmanned aerial vehicles and AN/TPQ-36 Firefinder radars supplied by the US.

The Government of India responded with Operation Vijay, a mobilisation of 200,000 Indian troops. However, because of the nature of the terrain, division and corps operations could not be mounted; subsequent fighting was conducted mostly at the brigade or battalion level. In effect, two divisions of the Indian Army, numbering 20,000, plus several thousand from the Paramilitary forces of India and the air force were deployed in the conflict zone. The total number of Indian soldiers that were involved in the military operation on the Kargil-Drass sector was thus close to 30,000. The number of infiltrators, including those providing logistical backup, has been put at approximately 5,000 at the height of the conflict.

The Indian Air Force launched Operation Safed Sagar in support of the mobilisation of Indian land forces on 26 May. The Indian government cleared limited use of Air Power only on 25 May, for fear of undesirable escalation, with the fiat that IAF fighter jets were not to cross the LOC under any circumstance. This was the first time any air war was fought at such high altitudes globally, with targets at altitudes between above sea level. The rarified air at these altitudes affected ballistic trajectories of air to ground weapons, such as rockets, dumb and laser guided bombs. There was no opposition at all by the Pakistani Air Force, leaving the IAF free to carry out its attacks with impunity. The total air dominance of the IAF gave the aircrew enough time to modify aiming indices and firing techniques, increasing its effectiveness during the high altitude war. Poor weather conditions and range limitations intermittently affected bomb loads and the number of airstrips that could be used, except for the Mirage 2000 fleet, which commenced operations on 30 May.

=== Naval action ===
The Indian Navy also prepared to blockade the Pakistani ports (primarily the Karachi port) to cut off supply routes under Operation Talwar. The Indian Navy&#x27;s western and eastern fleets joined in the North Arabian Sea and began aggressive patrols and threatened to cut Pakistan&#x27;s sea trade. This exploited Pakistan&#x27;s dependence on sea-based oil and trade flows. Later, then–Prime Minister of Pakistan Nawaz Sharif disclosed that Pakistan was left with just six days of fuel to sustain itself if a full-scale war had broken out.

==Overview==
=== Indian military operations ===

=== Mushkoh valley sector ===
The task of repelling the Pakistani forces was given to the 15th Corps under the command of Lt Gen Kishan Pal. The Kargil area, before the commencement of the engagement, was primarily enforced by 121 (I) infantry brigade commanded by Brig. Surinder Singh but Brig Singh was dismissed of his position when the infiltrations were discovered. In his place, Brig O. P. Nandrajog took command of the brigade. The 56 Mountain Brigade under the command of Brig A. N. Aul of the 8 Mountain Division was also inducted into the area.

==== Battle of Tololing ====
The Indian Army&#x27;s first priority was to recapture peaks that were in the immediate vicinity of NH 1. This resulted in Indian troops first targeting the Tiger Hill and Tololing complex in Dras, which dominated the Srinagar-Leh route. The Battle of Tololing, amongst other assaults, slowly tilted the combat in India&#x27;s favour. By 22 May, 18 Grenadiers, 1 Naga and Garhwal under the command of Col Kushal Thakur had already begun an assault on Tololing and were awaiting reinforcements. The battle lasted till 14 May. Along with reinforcements from 2 Rajputana Rifles under Lt Col MB Ravindranath and 16 Grenadiers, the Indian forces had to carry out several assaults in difficult terrain. Several senior Indian army officers were killed in action but the Tololing peak and surrounding points like points P4590 were captured. The recapture of Point 4590 on Tololing by Indian troops on 14 June was significant, notwithstanding the fact that it resulted in the Indian Army suffering the most casualties in a single battle during the conflict.

==== Operation Safed Sagar ====

The Indian Air Force was tasked to act jointly with ground troops on 25 May. The code name assigned to their role was Operation Safed Sagar It was in this type of terrain that aerial attacks were used, initially with limited effectiveness. On 27 May 1999, the IAF lost a MiG-27 strike aircraft piloted by Flt. Lt. Nachiketa, which it attributed to an engine failure, and a MiG-21 fighter piloted by Sqn Ldr Ajay Ahuja which was shot down by the Pakistani army, both over Batalik sector.; initially Pakistan said it shot down both jets after they crossed into its territory. According to reports, Ahuja had bailed out of his stricken plane safely but was apparently killed by his captors as his body was returned riddled with bullet wounds. One Indian Mi-8 helicopter was also lost due to Stinger SAMs. French made Mirage 2000H of the IAF were tasked to drop laser-guided bombs to destroy well-entrenched positions of the Pakistani forces and flew its first sortie on 30 May. The effects of the pinpoint non-stop bombing by the Mirage-2000, by day and by night, became evident with almost immediate effect.

By 15 June, India had mobilised a huge portion of its army near the international border and Indian commanders were on order to be ready for crossing the International border. The Pakistani DGMO Tauqir Zia communicated to the Indian DGMO Nirmal Chander Vij that Pakistan was uncomfortable with the escalations. According to then COAS of India VP Malik, Pakistan did not want to escalate further.

==== Capture of point 5140 ====

On 17 June, 13 JnK Rifles was tasked with capturing points 5140. Under the command of Lt Col YK Joshi, the battalion carried the operation out on 20 June and successfully captured the point. Gen Malik called Lt Vikram Batra&#x27;s contribution to the battle and success signal - &quot;Yeh Dil mange More&quot; legendary. Area adjacent to point 5140, namely and Area Rocky and Black tooth were captured by 1 Naga by 22 June.

The infiltrators evicted from 5140 and Tololing had regrouped at point 4700 and 18 Grenadiers were tasked with removing them. This attack was successfully carried out from 28 to 30 June. This attack enabled the Indian forces to finally focus on point 5100 and Area three pimples.

==== Capture of Three Pimples ====

As the operation was fully underway, about 250 artillery guns were brought in to clear the infiltrators in the posts that were in the . The Bofors FH-77B field howitzer played a vital role, with Indian gunners making maximum use of the terrain. However, its success was limited elsewhere due to the lack of space and depth to deploy it.

Area three pimples consisted of the Knoll, Lone Hill and Three Pimples. 2 Rajputana Rifles of Lt. Col. Ravindranath was tasked to recapture it on 28 June. Gen Malik personally talked with Ravindranath before the battle. The battle began 2 hours later and lasted 2 days. Area three pimples was captured on 29 June.

==== Battle of Tiger Hill ====

By last week of June, most of fire power was concentrated to the highest peak in the surrounding, Tiger Hill. 18 Grenadiers was placed under 192 Mountain brigade commanded by Brig. MPS Bajwa and 41 Field regiment was given the primary responsibility of artillery operations. The air force also concentrated its strikes within Tiger hill. This was the first battle in India to be telecasted live. The Battle of Tiger Hill began on 3 July. After 2 days of intense warfare, it was deemed impossible to just conclude the attack with one battalion so 8 Sikh was ordered to move from the west into Tiger Hill. By 5 July, several objectives were completed and major Pakistani commanders were killed. By 8 July the entire Tiger Hill feature was captured by 18 Grenadiers and 8 Sikh and Gen VP Malik addressed the media informing the world.

Two months into the conflict, Indian troops had slowly retaken most of the ridges that were encroached upon by the infiltrators; according to the official count, an estimated 75–80% of the intruded area and nearly all the high ground were back under Indian control.

==== Battle of point 4875 ====

After the battle of Tiger Hill, the next important objective was to capture point 4875 North-West of Mashkoh. The 13 JnK Rifles was assigned to 79 Mountain brigade of Brig. Ramesh Kakar. Lt. Col. Joshi regrouped in the Mashkoh valley on 1 July and the Battle began on 4 July. After hours of intense battle, Lt. Col. Joshi was unable to capture the point due to the fortification disadvantage and two companies of the battalion found themselves stuck in daylight. 

An injured Lt. Vikram Batra volunteered to reinforce the companies and was deployed as a platoon commander. Throughout the night 5 July, the battle raged in close-quatres. &quot;The opposing troops were so close that, besides the staccato of small arms, verbal exchanges carried on throughout the night.&quot; noted Gen Malik. While assaulting the peak, Capt. Naveen Nagappa was injured. It then became clear that the point directly north of 4875 was also to be captured. Capt. Batra led the final assault on this point, rescuing Capt. Nagappa but himself succumbed to Sniper and RPG fire on 7 July. Capt Batra&#x27;s attack ensured an Indian victory at point 4875.

==== First Ceasefire ====
Between 4 and 12 July, 17 Jat and 2 Naga continued to attack peaks adjacent to 4875 and had success. 6 and 7 Para SF attacked point 4700 but had to suspend their operations on 12 July when the ceasefire came into effect. After the Pakistani forces failed to honor the ceasefire and withdraw forces, the Indian forces resumed operations and point 4700 was captured by Para SF.

==== Battle of Zulu Spur ====
After the Pakistani forces refused to withdraw, Indian forces under the command of Brig MPS Bajwa of 192 Mountain Brigade launched an attack on the Zulu Spur on 22 July. The 3 Gurkha Rifles and 9 Para SF carried the operation out and forced the Pakistani forces to retreat by 25 July.

=== Operations in Batalik sector ===

==== Battle of point 5203 ====
On 29 May, operations in Batalik sector began as 1 Bihar regiment from 70 Infantry Brigade captured several posts including point 5203 in the western portion of the frontier but had to eventually retreat. The forces then had to focus on the eastern side. Operations resumed on 1 June when 12 JnK Rifles and 5 Para SF attacked and captured point 5390 and then decided to attack 5203 again. The assault was launched on 6 June. It resulted in an intense battle with heavy casualties. The battled continued till 21 June, when Ladakh Scouts had to join the Indian side and the point was captured. The brigade commander Brig. Devinder Singh was also injured in this assault.

==== Battle of point 4812 ====
The next most important objective was to capture Point 4812, which was an important dominating position of Pakistani forces. Four battalions of the 70 Infantry Brigade was tasked with a multidirectional attack on 30 June. By 6 July, all these forces completed their individual objectives and linked up.

==== Battle of Jubar ====
The final objective in the Batalik frontier was the Jubar peak which was isolated from the neighboring dominating structures. Attack was launched by 1 Bihar on 29 June and with the assistance of Air force and artillery, the peak was captured on 7 July.

=== Final Ceasefire ===
On 27 July, the Pakistani forces requested for a flag meeting and sought permission to collect dead bodies. Maj Gen Mohinder Puri granted this request. At the end of this venture, the Pakistani forces stood down and agreed to abide by the terms of the ceasefire in full.

===Washington Accord and final battles===
Following the outbreak of armed fighting, Pakistan sought American help in de-escalating the conflict. Bruce Riedel, who was then an aide to President Bill Clinton, reported that US intelligence had imaged Pakistani movements of nuclear weapons to forward deployments for fear of the Kargil hostilities escalating into a wider conflict. However, President Clinton refused to intervene until Pakistan had removed all forces from the Indian side of the LOC.

Following the Washington accord of 4 July 1999, when Sharif agreed to withdraw Pakistani troops, most of the fighting came to a gradual halt, but some Pakistani forces remained in positions on the Indian side of the LoC. In addition, the United Jihad Council (an umbrella for extremist groups) rejected Pakistan&#x27;s plan for a climb-down, instead deciding to fight on.

The Indian army launched its final attacks in the last week of July in co-ordination with relentless attacks by the IAF, both by day and night, in their totally successful Operation Safed Sagar; as soon as the Drass subsector had been cleared of Pakistani forces, the fighting ceased on 26 July. The day has since been marked as &quot;Kargil Vijay Diwas&quot; (Kargil Victory Day) in India. In the wake of its successive military defeats in Kargil, diplomatic isolation in the international arena, its precarious economic situation, and the mounting international pressure, the Pakistani establishment was compelled to negotiate a face saving withdrawal from the residual areas on the Indian side of the LoC, thereby restoring the sanctity of the LoC, as was established in July 1972 as per the Simla Agreement.

Pakistan was heavily criticised by other countries for instigating the war, as its paramilitary forces and insurgents had crossed the LOC (Line of Control). Pakistan&#x27;s primary diplomatic response, one of plausible deniability linking the incursion to what it officially termed as &quot;Kashmiri freedom fighters&quot;, was in the end not successful. Veteran analysts argued that the battle was fought at heights where only seasoned troops could survive, so poorly equipped &quot;freedom fighters&quot; would neither have the ability nor the wherewithal to seize land and defend it. Moreover, while the army had initially denied the involvement of its troops in the intrusion, two soldiers were awarded the Nishan-E-Haider (Pakistan&#x27;s highest military honour). Another 90 soldiers were also given awards, most of them posthumously, confirming Pakistan&#x27;s role in the episode. India also released taped phone conversations between the Army Chief and a senior Pakistani general where the latter is recorded saying: &quot;the scruff of [the militants] necks is in our hands&quot;, although Pakistan dismissed it as a &quot;total fabrication&quot;. Concurrently, Pakistan made several contradicting statements, confirming its role in Kargil, when it defended the incursions saying that the LOC itself was disputed. Pakistan also attempted to internationalise the Kashmir issue, by linking the crisis in Kargil to the larger Kashmir conflict, but such a diplomatic stance found few backers on the world stage.

As the Indian counter-attacks picked up momentum, Pakistani prime minister Nawaz Sharif flew to meet US President Bill Clinton on 4 July to obtain support from the United States. Clinton rebuked Sharif, however, and asked him to use his contacts to rein in the militants and withdraw Pakistani soldiers from Indian territory. Clinton would later reveal in his autobiography that &quot;Sharif&#x27;s moves were perplexing&quot; since the Indian Prime Minister had travelled to Lahore to promote bilateral talks aimed at resolving the Kashmir problem and &quot;by crossing the Line of Control, Pakistan had wrecked the [bilateral] talks&quot;. On the other hand, he applauded Indian restraint for not crossing the LOC and escalating the conflict into an all-out war.

G8 nations supported India and condemned the Pakistani violation of the LOC at the Cologne summit. The European Union also opposed Pakistan&#x27;s violation of the LOC. China, a long-time ally of Pakistan, insisted on a pullout of forces to the pre-conflict positions along the LOC and settling border issues peacefully. Other organisations like the ASEAN Regional Forum too supported India&#x27;s stand on the inviolability of the LOC.

Faced with growing international pressure, Sharif managed to pull back the remaining soldiers from Indian territory. The joint statement issued by Clinton and Sharif conveyed the need to respect the LOC and resume bilateral talks as the best forum to resolve all disputes.

==Impact and influence of media==
The Kargil War was significant for the impact and influence of the mass media on public opinion in both nations. Coming at a time of exploding growth in electronic journalism in India, the Kargil news stories and war footage were often telecast live on TV, and many websites provided in-depth analysis of the war. The conflict became the first &quot;live&quot; war in South Asia and it was given such detailed media coverage that one effect was the drumming up of jingoistic feelings.

The conflict soon turned into a news propaganda war, in which press briefings given by government officials of each nation produced conflicting claims and counterclaims. The Indian government placed a temporary News Embargo on information from Pakistan, banning the telecast of the state-run Pakistani channel PTV and blocking access to online editions of the &quot;Dawn&quot; newspaper. The Pakistani media criticised this apparent curbing of freedom of the press in India, while India media claimed it was in the interest of national security. The Indian government ran advertisements in foreign publications including &quot;The Times&quot; and &quot;The Washington Post&quot; detailing Pakistan&#x27;s role in supporting extremists in Kashmir in an attempt to garner political support for its position.

As the war progressed, media coverage of the conflict was more intense in India than in Pakistan. Many Indian channels showed images from the battle zone in a style reminiscent of CNN&#x27;s coverage of the Gulf War (one of the shells fired by Pakistan troops even hit a Doordarshan transmission centre in Kargil; coverage continued, however). Reasons for India&#x27;s increased coverage included the greater number of privately owned electronic media in India compared to Pakistan and relatively greater transparency in the Indian media. At a seminar in Karachi, Pakistani journalists agreed that while the Indian government had taken the press and the people into its confidence, Pakistan had not.

The print media in India and abroad was largely sympathetic to the Indian cause, with editorials in newspapers based in the west and other neutral countries observing that Pakistan was largely responsible for the conflict. Some analysts believe that Indian media, which was both larger in number and more credible, may have acted as a force multiplier for the Indian military operation in Kargil and served as a morale booster. As the fighting intensified, the Pakistani version of events found little backing on the world stage. This helped India gain valuable diplomatic recognition for its position.

==WMDs and the nuclear factor==
Since Pakistan and India each had weapons of mass destruction, many in the international community were concerned that if the Kargil conflict intensified, it could lead to nuclear war. Both countries had tested their nuclear capability in 1998 (India conducted its first test in 1974 while it was Pakistan&#x27;s first-ever nuclear test). Many political pundits believed the tests to be an indication of the escalating stakes in the scenario in South Asia. When the Kargil conflict started just a year after the nuclear tests, many nations desired to end it before it intensified.

International concerns increased when Pakistani foreign secretary Shamshad Ahmad made a statement on 31 May warning that an escalation of the limited conflict could lead Pakistan to use &quot;any weapon&quot; in its arsenal. This was immediately interpreted as a threat of nuclear retaliation by Pakistan in the event of an extended war, and the belief was reinforced when the leader of Pakistan&#x27;s senate noted, &quot;The purpose
of developing weapons becomes meaningless if they are not used when they are needed&quot;. Many such ambiguous statements from officials of both countries were viewed as warnings of an impending nuclear crisis where the combatants would consider use of their limited nuclear arsenals in &quot;tactical&quot; nuclear warfare in the belief that it would not have ended in mutual assured destruction, as could have occurred in a nuclear conflict between the United States and the USSR. Some experts believe that following nuclear tests in 1998, the Pakistani military was emboldened by its nuclear deterrent to markedly increase coercion against India.

The nature of the India-Pakistan conflict took a more sinister turn when the United States received intelligence that Pakistani nuclear warheads were being moved towards the border. Bill Clinton tried to dissuade Pakistan prime minister Nawaz Sharif from nuclear brinkmanship, even threatening Pakistan of dire consequences. According to a White House official, Sharif seemed to be genuinely surprised by this supposed missile movement and responded that India was probably planning the same. In an article published in a defence journal in 2000, Sanjay Badri-Maharaj, a security expert, claimed while quoting another expert that India too had readied at least five nuclear-tipped ballistic missiles.

Sensing a deteriorating military scenario, diplomatic isolation, and the risks of a larger conventional and nuclear war, Sharif ordered the Pakistani army to vacate the Kargil heights. He later claimed in his official biography that General Pervez Musharraf had moved nuclear warheads without informing him. Recently however, Pervez Musharraf revealed in his memoirs that Pakistan&#x27;s nuclear delivery system was not operational during the Kargil war; something that would have put Pakistan under serious disadvantage if the conflict went nuclear.

The threat of WMD included chemical and even biological weapons. Pakistan accused India of using chemical weapons and incendiary weapons such as napalm against the Kashmiri fighters. India, on the other hand, showcased a cache of gas masks as proof that Pakistan may have been prepared to use non-conventional weapons. US official and the Organisation for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons determined that Pakistani allegations of India using banned chemicals in its bombs were unfounded.

==Aftermath==
===India===

From the end of the war until February 2000, the Indian stock market rose by more than 30%. The next Indian national budget included major increases in military spending.

There was a surge in patriotism, with many celebrities expressing their support for the Kargil cause. Indians were angered by media reports of the death of pilot Ajay Ahuja, especially after Indian authorities reported that Ahuja had been murdered and his body mutilated by Pakistani troops. The war had produced higher than expected fatalities for the Indian military, with a sizeable percentage of them including newly commissioned officers. One month after conclusion of the Kargil War, the Atlantique Incident, in which a Pakistan Navy plane was shot down by India, briefly reignited fears of a conflict between the two countries.

After the war, the Indian government severed ties with Pakistan and increased defence preparedness. India increased its defence budget as it sought to acquire more state of the art equipment. Media reported about military procurement irregularities and criticism of intelligence agencies like Research and Analysis Wing, which failed to predict the intrusions or the identity and number of infiltrators during the war. An internal assessment report by the armed forces, published in an Indian magazine, showed several other failings, including &quot;a sense of complacency&quot; and being &quot;unprepared for a conventional war&quot; on the presumption that nuclearism would sustain peace. It also highlighted the lapses in command and control, the insufficient troop levels and the dearth of large-calibre guns like the Bofors. In 2006, retired Air Chief Marshal, A. Y. Tipnis, alleged that the Indian Army did not fully inform the government about the intrusions, adding that the army chief Ved Prakash Malik, was initially reluctant to use the full strike capability of the Indian Air Force, instead requesting only helicopter gunship support. Soon after the conflict, India also decided to complete the project, previously stalled by Pakistan, to fence the entire LOC.

The end of the Kargil conflict was followed by the 13th Indian General Elections to the Lok Sabha, which gave a decisive mandate to the National Democratic Alliance (NDA) government. It was re-elected to power in September–October 1999 with a majority of 303 seats out of 545 in the Lok Sabha. On the diplomatic front, Indo-US relations improved, as the United States appreciated Indian attempts to restrict the conflict to a limited geographic area. Relations with Israel—which had discreetly aided India with ordnance supply and materiel such as unmanned aerial vehicles, laser-guided bombs, and satellite imagery—also were bolstered.

The end and victory of the Kargil War is celebrated annually in India as Kargil Vijay Diwas.

===Kargil Review Committee===
Soon after the war the Atal Bihari Vajpayee government set up an inquiry into its causes and to analyse perceived Indian intelligence failures. The high-powered committee was chaired by eminent strategic affairs analyst K. Subrahmanyam and given powers to interview anyone with current or past associations with Indian security, including former Prime Ministers. The committee&#x27;s final report (also referred to as the &quot;Subrahmanyam Report&quot;) led to a large-scale restructuring of Indian Intelligence. It, however, came in for heavy criticism in the Indian media for its perceived avoidance of assigning specific responsibility for failures over detecting the Kargil intrusions. The committee was also embroiled in controversy for indicting Brigadier Surinder Singh of the Indian Army for his failure to report enemy intrusions in time, and for his subsequent conduct. Many press reports questioned or contradicted this finding and claimed that Singh had in fact issued early warnings that were ignored by senior Indian Army commanders and, ultimately, higher government functionaries.

In a departure from the norm the final report was published and made publicly available. Some chapters and all annexures, however, were deemed to contain classified information by the government and not released. K. Subrahmanyam later wrote that the annexures contained information on the development of India&#x27;s nuclear weapons program and the roles played by Prime Ministers Rajiv Gandhi, P. V. Narasimha Rao and V. P. Singh.

===Pakistan===

Shortly after declaring itself a nuclear weapons state, Pakistan had been humiliated diplomatically and militarily. Faced with the possibility of international isolation, the already fragile Pakistan economy was weakened further. The morale of Pakistan forces after the withdrawal declined as many units of the Northern Light Infantry suffered heavy casualties. The government refused to accept the dead bodies of many officers, an issue that provoked outrage and protests in the Northern Areas. Pakistan initially did not acknowledge many of its casualties, but Sharif later said that over 4,000 Pakistani troops were killed in the operation. Responding to this, Pervez Musharraf said, &quot;It hurts me when an ex-premier undermines his own forces&quot;, and claimed that Indian casualties were more than that of Pakistan. The legacy of Kargil war still continues to be debated on Pakistan&#x27;s news channels and television political correspondents, which Musharraf repeatedly appeared to justify.

Many in Pakistan had expected a victory over the Indian military based on Pakistani official reports on the war, but were dismayed by the turn of events and questioned the eventual retreat. The military leadership is believed to have felt let down by the prime minister&#x27;s decision to withdraw the remaining fighters. However, some authors, including Musharraf&#x27;s close friend and former American CENTCOM Commander General Anthony Zinni, and former Prime minister Nawaz Sharif, state that it was General Musharraf who requested that Sharif withdraw Pakistani troops. In 2012, Musharraf&#x27;s senior officer and retired major-general Abdul Majeed Malik maintained that Kargil was a &quot;total disaster&quot; and bitterly criticised General Musharraf. Pointing out the fact that Pakistan was in no position to fight India in that area; the Nawaz Sharif government initiated the diplomatic process by involving the US President Bill Clinton and got Pakistan out of the difficult scenario. Malik maintained that soldiers were not &quot;Mujaheddin&quot; but active-duty serving officers and soldiers of the Pakistan Army.

In a national security meeting with Prime minister Nawaz Sharif at the Joint Headquarters, General Musharraf became heavily involved with serious altercations with Chief of Naval Staff Admiral Fasih Bokhari who ultimately called for a court-martial against General Musharraf. With Sharif placing the onus of the Kargil attacks squarely on the army chief Pervez Musharraf, there was an atmosphere of uneasiness between the two. On 12 October 1999, General Musharraf staged a bloodless &quot;coup d&#x27;état&quot;, ousting Nawaz Sharif.

Benazir Bhutto, an opposition leader in the parliament and former prime minister, called the Kargil War &quot;Pakistan&#x27;s greatest blunder&quot;. Many ex-officials of the military and the Inter-Services Intelligence (Pakistan&#x27;s principal intelligence agency) also believed that &quot;Kargil was a waste of time&quot; and &quot;could not have resulted in any advantage&quot; on the larger issue of Kashmir.
A retired Pakistan Army&#x27;s Lieutenant-General Ali Kuli Khan, lambasted the war as &quot;a disaster bigger than the East Pakistan tragedy&quot;, adding that the plan was &quot;flawed in terms of its conception, tactical planning and execution&quot; that ended in &quot;sacrificing so many soldiers&quot;. The Pakistani media criticised the whole plan and the eventual climbdown from the Kargil heights since there were no gains to show for the loss of lives and it only resulted in international condemnation.

Despite calls by many, no public commission of inquiry was set up in Pakistan to investigate the people responsible for initiating the conflict. The Pakistan Muslim League (PML(N)) published a white paper in 2006, which stated that Nawaz Sharif constituted an inquiry committee that recommended a court martial for General Pervez Musharraf, but Musharraf &quot;stole the report&quot; after toppling the government, to save himself. The report also claims that India knew about the plan 11 months before its launch, enabling a complete victory for India on military, diplomatic and economic fronts. A statement in June 2008 by a former X Corps commander and Director-General of Military Intelligence (M.I.) that time, Lieutenant-General (retired) Jamshed Gulzar Kiani said that: &quot;As Prime minister, Nawaz Sharif &quot;was never briefed by the army&quot; on the Kargil attack, reignited the demand for a probe of the episode by legal and political groups.

Though the Kargil conflict had brought the Kashmir dispute into international focus, which was one of Pakistan&#x27;s aims, it had done so in negative circumstances that eroded its credibility, since the infiltration came just after a peace process between the two countries had been concluded. The sanctity of the LOC too received international recognition. President Clinton&#x27;s move to ask Islamabad to withdraw hundreds of armed militants from Indian-administered Kashmir was viewed by many in Pakistan as indicative of a clear shift in US policy against Pakistan.

After the war, a few changes were made to the Pakistan armed forces. In recognition of the Northern Light Infantry&#x27;s performance in the war, which even drew praise from a retired Indian Lt. General, the regiment was incorporated into the regular army. The war showed that despite a tactically sound plan that had the element of surprise, little groundwork had been done to gauge the political ramifications. And like previous unsuccessful infiltrations attempts, such as &quot;Operation Gibraltar&quot;, which sparked the 1965 war, there was little co-ordination or information sharing among the branches of the Pakistani Armed Forces. One US Intelligence study is reported to have stated that Kargil was yet another example of Pakistan&#x27;s (lack of) grand strategy, repeating the follies of the previous wars. In 2013, General Musharraf&#x27;s close collaborator and confidential subordinate Lieutenant General (retired) Shahid Aziz revealed to Pakistan&#x27;s news televisions and electronic media, that &quot;[Kargil] adventure&#x27; was India&#x27;s intelligence failure and Pakistan&#x27;s miscalculated move, the Kargil operation was known only to General Parvez Musharraf and four of his close collaborators&quot;.

==Casualties==
Pakistani army losses have been difficult to determine. Pakistan confirmed that 453 soldiers were killed. The US Department of State had made an early, partial estimate of close to 700 fatalities. According to numbers stated by Nawaz Sharif there were over 4,000 fatalities. His PML (N) party in its &quot;white paper&quot; on the war mentioned that more than 3,000 Mujahideens, officers and soldiers were killed. Another major Pakistani political party, the Pakistan Peoples Party, also says that &quot;thousands&quot; of soldiers and irregulars died. Indian estimates stand at 1,042 Pakistani soldiers killed. Musharraf, in his Hindi version of his memoirs, titled &quot;Agnipath&quot;, differs from all the estimates stating that 357 troops were killed with a further 665 wounded. Apart from General Musharraf&#x27;s figure on the number of Pakistanis wounded, the number of people injured in the Pakistan camp is not yet fully known although they are at least more than 400 according to Pakistan army&#x27;s website. One Indian pilot was officially captured during the fighting, while there were eight Pakistani soldiers who were captured during the fighting, and were repatriated on 13 August 1999.
India gave its official casualty figures as 527 dead and 1,363 wounded.

==Kargil War Memorial, India==

The Kargil War memorial, built by the Indian Army, is located in Dras, in the foothills of the Tololing Hill. The memorial, located about 5 km from the city centre across the Tiger Hill, commemorates the martyrs of the Kargil War. A poem &quot;Pushp Kii Abhilasha&quot; (Wish of a Flower) by Makhanlal Chaturvedi, a renowned 20th century neo-romantic Hindi poet, is inscribed on the gateway of the memorial greets visitors. The names of the soldiers who lost their lives in the War are inscribed on the Memorial Wall and can be read by visitors. A museum attached to the Kargil War Memorial, which was established to celebrate the victory of Operation Vijay, houses pictures of Indian soldiers, archives of important war documents and recordings, Pakistani war equipments and gear, and official emblems of the Army from the Kargil war.

A giant national flag, weighing 15 kg was hoisted at the Kargil war memorial on Kargil Vijay Diwas to commemorate the 13th anniversary of India&#x27;s victory in the war.

* Names for the conflict: There have been various names for the conflict. During the actual fighting in Kargil, the Indian Government was careful not to use the term &quot;war&quot;, calling it a &quot;war-like situation&quot;, even though both nations indicated that they were in a &quot;state of war&quot;. Terms like Kargil &quot;conflict&quot;, Kargil &quot;incident&quot; or the official military assault, &quot;Operation Vijay&quot;, were thus preferred. After the end of the war however, the Indian Government increasingly called it the &quot;Kargil War&quot;, even though there had been no official declaration of war. Other less popularly used names included &quot;Third Kashmir War&quot; and Pakistan&#x27;s codename given to the infiltration: &quot;Operation Badr&quot;.

<doc id="803763" wikidata="Q1370415" url="?curid=803763" title="Ātman (Buddhism)">
<text>Ātman (), attā or attan in Buddhism is the concept of self, and is found in Buddhist literature&#x27;s discussion of the concept of non-self (&quot;Anatta&quot;). Most Buddhist traditions and texts reject the premise of a permanent, unchanging &quot;atman&quot; (self, soul).

==Etymology==
Cognates () &quot;ātman&quot;, Pāli &quot;atta&quot;, Old English &quot;æthm&quot;, and German &quot;Atem&quot; derive from the Indo-European root *ēt-men (breath). The word means &quot;essence, breath, soul.&quot;

&quot;Ātman&quot; and &quot;atta&quot; refer to a person&#x27;s &quot;true self&quot;, a person&#x27;s permanent self, absolute within, the &quot;thinker of thoughts, feeler of sensations&quot; separate from and beyond the changing phenomenal world. The term &quot;Ātman&quot; is synonymous with &quot;Tuma&quot;, &quot;Atuma&quot; and &quot;Attan&quot; in early Buddhist literature, state Rhys David and William Stede, all in the sense of &quot;self, soul&quot;. The &quot;Atman&quot; and &quot;Atta&quot; are related, in Buddhist canons, to terms such as &quot;Niratta&quot; (Nir+attan, soulless) and &quot;Attaniya&quot; (belonging to the soul, having a soul, of the nature of soul).

==Early Buddhism==
&quot;Atman&quot; in early Buddhism appears as &quot;all &quot;dhammas&quot; are not-Self (an-atta)&quot;, where &quot;atta&quot; (&quot;atman&quot;) refers to a metaphysical Self, states Peter Harvey, that is a &quot;permanent, substantial, autonomous self or I&quot;. This concept refers to the pre-Buddhist Upanishads of Hinduism, where a distinction is made between the personal self, &quot;jivatman&quot; (impermanent body, personality) and the Real Self, &quot;Atman&quot;. The early Buddhist literature explores the validity of the Upanishadic concepts of self and Self, then asserts that every living being has an impermanent self but there is no real Higher Self. The Nikaya texts of Buddhism deny that there is anything called Ātman that is the substantial absolute or essence of a living being, an idea that distinguishes Buddhism from the Brahmanical (proto-Hindu) traditions.

The Buddha argued that no permanent, unchanging &quot;Self&quot; can be found. In Buddha&#x27;s view, states Wayman, &quot;&quot;eso me atta&quot;, or this is my Self, is to be in the grip of wrong view&quot;. All conditioned phenomena are subject to change, and therefore can&#x27;t be taken to be an unchanging &quot;Self&quot;. Instead, the Buddha explains the perceived continuity of the human personality by describing it as composed of five skandhas, without a permanent entity (Self, soul).

==Pudgalavada==
Of the early Indian Buddhist schools, only the Pudgalavada-school diverged from this basic teaching. The Pudgalavādins asserted that, while there is no ātman, there is a pudgala or &quot;person&quot;, which is neither the same as nor different from the skandhas.

==Buddha-nature==
&quot;Buddha-nature&quot; is a central notion of east-Asian (Chinese) Mahayana thought. It refers to several related terms, most notably &quot;Tathāgatagarbha&quot; and &quot;Buddha-dhātu&quot;. &quot;Tathāgatagarbha&quot; means &quot;the womb of the thus-gone&quot; (c.f. enlightened one), while &quot;Buddha-dhātu&quot; literally means &quot;Buddha-realm&quot; or &quot;Buddha-substrate&quot;. Several key texts refer to the &quot;tathāgatagarbha&quot; or &quot;Buddha-dhātu&quot; as &quot;atman&quot;, Self or essence, though those texts also contain warnings against a literal interpretation. Several scholars have noted similarities between &quot;tathāgatagarbha&quot; texts and the substantial monism found in the atman/Brahman tradition.

The &quot;Tathagatagarbha&quot; doctrine, at its earliest, probably appeared about the later part of the 3rd century CE, and is verifiable in Chinese translations of 1st millennium CE.

=== Mahāyāna Mahāparinirvāṇa Sūtra ===
In contrast to the madhyamika-tradition, the &quot;Mahāparinirvāṇa Sūtra&quot; uses &quot;positive language&quot; to denote &quot;absolute reality&quot;. According to Paul Williams, the &quot;Mahāyāna Mahāparinirvāṇa Sūtra&quot; teaches an underlying essence, &quot;Self&quot;, or &quot;atman&quot;. This &quot;true Self&quot; is the Buddha-nature (&quot;Tathagatagarbha&quot;), which is present in all sentient beings, and realized by the awakened ones. Most scholars consider the &quot;Tathagatagarbha&quot; doctrine in &quot;Mahāparinirvāṇa Sūtra&quot; asserting an &#x27;essential nature&#x27; in every living being is equivalent to &#x27;Self&#x27;, and it contradicts the Anatta doctrines in a vast majority of Buddhist texts, leading scholars to posit that the &quot;Tathagatagarbha Sutras&quot; were written to promote Buddhism to non-Buddhists.

According to Sallie B. King, the &quot;Mahāyāna Mahāparinirvāṇa Sūtra&quot; does not represent a major innovation. Its most important innovation is the linking of the term &quot;buddhadhatu&quot; with &quot;tathagatagarbha&quot;. According to King, the sutra is rather unsystematic, which made it &quot;a fruitful one for later students and commentators, who were obliged to create their own order and bring it to the text&quot;. The sutra speaks about Buddha-nature in so many different ways, that Chinese scholars created a list of types of Buddha-nature that could be found in the text. One of those statements is:
In the &quot;Mahāparinirvāṇa Sūtra&quot; the Buddha also speaks of the &quot;affirmative attributes&quot; of nirvana, &quot;the Eternal, Bliss, the Self and the Pure.&quot; The &quot;Mahāyāna Mahāparinirvāṇa Sūtra&quot; explains:
Edward Conze connotatively links the term &quot;tathagata&quot; itself (the designation which the Buddha applied to himself) with the notion of a real, true self:
It is possible, states Johannes Bronkhorst, that &quot;original Buddhism did not deny the existence of the soul [Ātman, Attan]&quot;, even though a firm Buddhist tradition has maintained that the Buddha avoided talking about the soul or even denied it existence. While there may be ambivalence on the existence or non-existence of self in early Buddhist literature, adds Bronkhorst, it is clear from these texts that seeking self-knowledge is not the Buddhist path for liberation, and turning away from self-knowledge is. This is a reverse position to the Vedic traditions which recognized the knowledge of the self as &quot;the principal means to achieving liberation&quot;.

===&quot;Self&quot; as a teaching method===
According to Paul Wiliams, the &quot;Mahaparinirvana Sutra&quot; uses the term &quot;Self&quot; in order to win over non-Buddhist ascetics. He quotes from the sutra:
In the later &quot;Lankāvatāra Sūtra&quot; it is said that the &quot;tathāgatagarbha&quot; might be mistaken for a self, which it is not.

=== Ratnagotravibhāga ===
The &quot;Ratnagotravibhāga&quot; (also known as &quot;Uttaratantra&quot;), another text composed in the first half of 1st millennium CE and translated into Chinese in 511 CE, points out that the teaching of the &quot;Tathagatagarbha&quot; doctrine is intended to win sentient beings over to abandoning &quot;self-love&quot; (&quot;atma-sneha&quot;) – considered to be a moral defect in Buddhism. The 6th-century Chinese &quot;Tathagatagarbha&quot; translation states that &quot;Buddha has &quot;shiwo&quot; (True Self) which is beyond being and nonbeing&quot;. However, the &quot;Ratnagotravibhāga&quot; asserts that the &quot;Self&quot; implied in &quot;Tathagatagarbha&quot; doctrine is actually &quot;not-Self&quot;.

== Current disputes ==
The dispute about &quot;self&quot; and &quot;not-self&quot; doctrines has continued throughout the history of Buddhism. According to Johannes Bronkhorst, it is possible that &quot;original Buddhism did not deny the existence of the soul&quot;, even though a firm Buddhist tradition has maintained that the Buddha avoided talking about the soul or even denied its existence. French religion writer André Migot also states that original Buddhism may not have taught a complete absence of self, pointing to evidence presented by Buddhist and Pali scholars Jean Przyluski and Caroline Rhys Davids that early Buddhism generally believed in a self, making Buddhist schools that admit an existence of a &quot;self&quot; not heretical, but conservative, adhering to ancient beliefs. In his book, &quot;The Atman-Brahman in Ancient Buddhism&quot;, scholar Kamaleswar Bhattacharya wrote that, while Shakyamuni Buddha did indeed teach against a permanent self within the ever-changing aggregates, both he and early Buddhists believed in an impersonal, universal atman. While there may be ambivalence on the existence or non-existence of self in early Buddhist literature, Bronkhorst suggests that these texts clearly indicate that the Buddhist path of liberation consists not in seeking self-knowledge, but in turning away from what might erroneously be regarded as the self. This is a reverse position to the Vedic traditions which recognized the knowledge of the self as &quot;the principal means to achieving liberation.&quot;

In Thai Theravada Buddhism, for example, states Paul Williams, some modern era Buddhist scholars have said that &quot;nirvana is indeed the true Self&quot;, while other Thai Buddhists disagree. For instance, the Dhammakaya Movement in Thailand teaches that it is erroneous to subsume nirvana under the rubric of &quot;anatta&quot; (non-self); instead, nirvana is taught to be the &quot;true self&quot; or &quot;dhammakaya&quot;. The Dhammakaya Movement teaching that nirvana is atta, or true self, was criticized as heretical in Buddhism in 1994 by Ven. Payutto, a well-known scholar monk, who stated that &#x27;Buddha taught nibbana as being non-self&quot;. The abbot of one major temple in the Dhammakaya Movement, Luang Por Sermchai of Wat Luang Por Sodh Dhammakayaram, argues that it tends to be scholars who hold the view of absolute non-self, rather than Buddhist meditation practitioners. He points to the experiences of prominent forest hermit monks such as Luang Pu Sodh and Ajahn Mun to support the notion of a &quot;true self&quot;. Similar interpretations on the &quot;true self&quot; were put forth earlier by the 12th Supreme Patriarch of Thailand in 1939. According to Williams, the Supreme Patriarch&#x27;s interpretation echoes the &quot;tathāgatagarbha&quot; sutras.

Several notable teachers of the Thai Forest Tradition have also described ideas in contrast to absolute non-self. Ajahn Maha Bua, a well known meditation master, described the citta (mind) as being an indestructible reality that does not fall under &quot;anattā.&quot; He has stated that not-self is merely a perception that is used to pry one away from infatuation with the concept of a self, and that once this infatuation is gone the idea of not-self must be dropped as well. American monk Thanissaro Bhikkhu of the Thai Forest Tradition describes the Buddha&#x27;s statements on non-self as a path to awakening rather than a universal truth. Thanissaro Bhikkhu states that the Buddha intentionally set aside the question of whether or not there is a self as a useless question, and that clinging to the idea that there is no self at all would actually &quot;prevent&quot; enlightenment. Bhikkhu Bodhi authored a rejoinder to Thanissaro, writing that &quot;The reason the teaching of anatta can serve as a strategy of liberation is precisely because it serves to rectify a misconception about the nature of being, hence an ontological error.&quot;

Buddhist scholars Richard Gombrich and Alexander Wynne argue that the Buddha&#x27;s descriptions of non-self in early Buddhist texts do not deny that there is a self. Gethin writes that anatta is often mistranslated as meaning &quot;not having a self&quot;, but in reality meant &quot;not the self&quot;. Wynne say that early Buddhist texts such as the &quot;Anattalakkhana Sutta&quot; do not deny that there is a self, stating that the five aggregates that are described as not self are not descriptions of a human being but descriptions of the human experience. Wynne and Gombrich both argue that the Buddha&#x27;s statements on anattā were originally a &quot;not-self&quot; teaching that developed into a &quot;no-self&quot; teaching in later Buddhist thought. Thanissaro Bhikkhu points to the Ananda Sutta (SN 44.10), where the Buddha stays silent when asked whether there is a &#x27;self&#x27; or not, as a major cause of the dispute.

<doc id="803771" wikidata="Q1758398" url="?curid=803771" title="Picture disc">
<text>Picture discs are gramophone (phonograph) records that show images on their playing surface, rather than being of plain black or colored vinyl. Collectors traditionally reserve the term picture disc for records with graphics that extend at least partly into the actual playable grooved area,
distinguishing them from picture label discs, which have a specially illustrated and sometimes very large label, and picture back discs, which are illustrated on one unplayable side only.
==The beginnings==

A few seven-inch black shellac records issued by the Canadian Berliner Gramophone Company around 1900 had the &quot;His Master&#x27;s Voice&quot; dog-and-gramophone trademark lightly etched into the surface of the playing area as an anti-piracy measure, technically qualifying them as picture discs by some definitions.

Apart from those debatable claimants for the title of &quot;first&quot;, the earliest picture records were not discs, strictly speaking, but rectangular picture postcards with small, round, transparent celluloid records glued onto the illustrated side. Such cards were in use by about 1909. Later, the recordings were pressed into a transparent coating that covered the entire picture side of the card. This novelty product idea proved to have a very long life. In the 1950s and throughout the rest of the vinyl era, picture postcard records, usually oversized and often featuring a garish color photograph of a tourist attraction or typical local scenery, were issued in several countries. These and similar small novelty picture records on laminated paper or thin cardboard, such as were occasionally bound into magazines or featured on the backs of boxes of breakfast cereal, are usually not classed with the larger and sturdier discs that were sold in record stores or used as promotional gifts by record companies, but a few featured famous performers and are now eagerly sought by collectors of those artists&#x27; records.

The first picture discs of substantial size, sold as records meant only to be looked at and played, not put into a mailbox, appeared in the 1920s. Their first wave of significant popularity did not arrive until the start of the 1930s, when several companies in several countries began issuing them. Some were illustrated with photographs or artwork simply designed to be appropriate to the musical contents, but some graphics also promoted films in which the recorded songs had been introduced, and a few were blatant advertising that had little or no connection with the recording. Some politicians and demagogues explored the potential of the discs as a medium for propaganda. Adolf Hitler and British fascist Oswald Mosley were each featured on their own special picture discs.

Most of these records were made of a simple sheet of fairly thin printed cardboard with a very thin plastic coating and their audio quality was substandard. Some were more sturdy and well-made and they equaled or actually surpassed the audio quality of ordinary records, which were still made of a gritty shellac compound that introduced a lot of background noise. In 1933, RCA Victor in the U.S. issued a few typical cardboard-based picture records but was unhappy with their quality and soon began making an improved type. A rigid blank shellac core disc was sandwiched between two illustrated sheets and each side was then topped with a substantial layer of high-quality clear plastic into which the recording was pressed. Like nearly all records being made for the general public, they were recorded at 78 rpm, but one issue was recorded at 33⅓ rpm, a speed already in use for special purposes which Victor was then unsuccessfully attempting to introduce into home use. It was the first 33⅓ rpm picture disc and the only one made until many years later. These were deluxe picture discs, priced much higher than ordinary records, and they sold in very small numbers. In the early 1930s the entire record industry was being devastated by a worldwide economic depression and the proliferation of the new medium of radio, which made a wide variety of music available free of charge. Picture discs of all kinds were among the casualties.

==1946 to 1969==
With the Great Depression and World War II no longer around to interfere with such modest luxuries, the picture disc reemerged in 1946, when Tom Saffardy&#x27;s Sav-Way Industries began issuing Vogue Records. Vogues were a well-made product physically similar to RCA Victor&#x27;s improved 1933 issues except that their core discs were aluminum instead of shellac. The Victor discs had been illustrated in high Art Deco style, often in sober but elegant black-and-white. Vogue&#x27;s discs featured artwork done in the styles typical of 1940s commercial illustration and pin-up art, most of it gaudily colored, some dramatic, some humorous, some very cartoonish. The audio quality was excellent by contemporary standards and they featured professional talent, most with names known to the general public, but Vogue was handicapped by the lack of any big &quot;hit&quot; names. Top-tier talent was usually under exclusive contract to companies such as Mercury Records, for whom Sav-Way manufactured special attention-grabbing, quiet-surfaced picture discs that Mercury distributed only to radio disc jockeys. Vogue records retailed for US$1.05, about fifty percent more than ordinary ten-inch 78 rpm records. The novelty of the colorful discs attracted interest and sales at first, but success proved elusive and Vogue went out of business in 1947 after fewer than 100 catalog items bearing the Vogue logo had been issued.

More commercially successful and long-lived were some of the children&#x27;s picture discs marketed by the Record Guild of America from the late 1940s through the 1950s. Their most popular and well-known issues resembled Vogue records in their general style of illustration and use of high-quality materials, but they were only 7 inches in diameter, had no reinforcing core disc, and sold for a much lower price. Other companies such as Voco also made picture discs for children.

Red Raven Movie Records, introduced in 1956, were a very unusual type of children&#x27;s picture disc. They featured a sequence of sixteen interwoven animation frames arrayed around the center and were to be played at 78 rpm on a turntable with a short spindle, on which a small sixteen-mirrored device, a variety of the praxinoscope, was placed. Gazing into this as the record played, the user saw an endlessly repeating high-quality animated cartoon scene appropriate to the song. Only the earliest Red Raven discs, which were of the coated cardboard type but reinforced with a metal rim and spindle hole grommet, were true picture discs. The more common later issues were larger &quot;picture label discs&quot; made of solid colored opaque, translucent or transparent plastic, with the recording in a band surrounding a very large label that carried the animation graphics. In the 1960s similar products were introduced in several countries under various brand names—Teddy in France and the Netherlands, Mamil Moviton in Italy, etc.

Picture discs of the large and solid Victor-Vogue type were very rarely issued in the U.S. between the demise of Vogue in 1947 and the end of the 1960s, but several lines of picture discs, such as the French Saturnes, were produced in Europe and Japan during these years.

==1970 and beyond==
A new generation of picture discs appeared in the 1970s. The first serious pictures discs, with acceptable but still inferior sound quality, were developed by Metronome Records GmbH, a subsidiary of Elektra Records. These new picture discs were made by creating a five-layer lamination consisting of a core of black vinyl with kiln-dried paper decals on either side and then outer skins of clear vinyl film, manufactured by 3M, on the outsides. In manufacture, one layer of the clear film was first placed on the bed of the press on top of the stamper, then a &quot;puck&quot; of hot black vinyl from the extruder was placed on top of that. Finally the top print and vinyl film layer was added (held by a retracting pin in the upper profile usually employed to retain the upper paper label) and the press closed. Problems with poor vinyl flow caused by the paper texture and air released from the paper (that had not been removed in the kiln drying process) plagued the process.

The first &#x27;modern&#x27; rock picture disc was introduced as an assortment of artists such as the MC5 and The Doors. It was released in 1969 by Metronome of Germany and entitled &quot;Psychedelic Underground - Off 2, Hallucinations&quot;. The second release was the British progressive rock band Curved Air&#x27;s first album, &quot;Air Conditioning&quot;, a UK issue (1970). One commercially issued American picture disc is &quot;To Elvis: Love Still Burning&quot;, a collection of 11 Elvis Presley tribute songs by various artists, issued in May 1978. Both sides of the album (Fotoplay FSP-1001) picture Presley.

Initially picture discs were usually promotional items pressed in small quantities, but by the late 1970s they began to be produced as commercial products in large quantities. In the 1980s numerous commercial picture discs were released, but by the end of the decade, the interest in picture discs had declined as consumers began transitioning away from vinyl records towards newer formats such as cassette tapes and compact discs.

==Types of picture discs==
On some picture discs, the images used were meant to create an optical illusion while the record was rotating on the turntable (as in the B side of Curved Air&#x27;s &quot;Airconditioning&quot;), while others used the visual effect to add to the music — for example, the 1979 picture disc of Fischer-Z&#x27;s &quot;The Worker&quot; featured a train which endlessly commuted around the turntable, reinforcing the song&#x27;s message.

Later picture discs included liquid light show style fluids between the vinyl, Rowlux 3D effect film, diffraction rainbow film, metal flake (&quot;vide&quot; examples here), pressure-sensitive liquid crystals that changed color when the record was picked up, and a real holographic record.

Shaped picture discs became common in the 1980s. These are mostly considered to be collecting items, rather than for listening as the sound quality is inferior to regular vinyl. Shaped picture discs are manufactured at full 12 inch size and then cut in various shapes using a cutting tool. Shaped picture discs are always singles rather than albums and are usually limited to a few thousand copies.

Interview discs are quite commonly pressed as picture discs as well.

In the 1950s, &quot;movie&quot; discs showing a repeating animation were produced, using the Praxinoscope technique, an example here:

<doc id="803783" wikidata="Q77309" url="?curid=803783" title="Friedrich Stromeyer">
<text>Friedrich Stromeyer FRS(For) FRSE (2 August 1776 – 18 August 1835) was a German chemist. He was the discoverer of cadmium.

From 1982, the Friedrich Stromeyer Prize has been awarded for chemical achievement in Germany.

==Biography==
He was born in Göttingen on 2 August 1776 the eldest son of Dr Ernerst Johann Friedrich Stromeyer, professor of medicine at Göttingen University, and his wife, Marie Magdalena Johanne von Blum.

Stromeyer studied Chemistry and Medicine at Göttingen and Paris and received an MD degree from the University of Göttingen in 1800, studying under Johann Friedrich Gmelin and Louis Nicolas Vauquelin. He was then a professor at the university, and also served as an inspector of apothecaries. His students included Robert Bunsen.

In 1817, whilst studying compounds of zinc carbonate, Stromeyer discovered the element cadmium. Cadmium is a common impurity of zinc compounds, though often found only in minute quantities. He was also the first to recommend starch as a reagent for free iodine and he studied chemistry of arsine and bismuthate salts.

In 1819, he was the first scientist to describe the mineral eudialyte.

In 1826, he was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society of Edinburgh his proposer being Edward Turner. As his fellowship was Ordinary (rather than Foreign or Honorary) this means he was physically present in Edinburgh at that time. The following year he was elected a Foreign Fellow of the Royal Society of London.

In 1832, the mineral stromeyerite was named in his honour by mineralogist François Sulpice Beudant.

He died in Göttingen on 18 August 1835, aged 59.

<text>Total Eclipse is a 1995 erotic historical drama film directed by Agnieszka Holland, based on a 1967 play by Christopher Hampton, who also adapted it for the screen. Based on letters and poems, it presents a historically accurate account of the relationship between 19th-century French poets Arthur Rimbaud (Leonardo DiCaprio) and Paul Verlaine (David Thewlis). Warner Bros. has included the film in the catalogue of Warner Archive Collection.

==Plot==

The older Paul Verlaine meets Arthur Rimbaud&#x27;s sister Isabelle in a café in Paris. Isabelle and her mother want Verlaine to hand over any copies he may still have of Rimbaud&#x27;s poems so that they can burn them. Verlaine reflects on the relationship he formed with Rimbaud, beginning when the teenaged Rimbaud had sent his poetry to Verlaine from his home in the provinces in 1871. Verlaine impulsively invited him to his rich father-in-law&#x27;s home in Paris, where he lives with his young, pregnant wife. Rimbaud displays no sense of manners or decency, scandalising Verlaine&#x27;s pretentious, bourgeois in-laws.

The 27-year-old Verlaine is seduced by the 16-year-old Rimbaud&#x27;s physical body as well as by the originality of his mind. The staid respectability of married life and easy, middle-class surroundings had been stifling Verlaine&#x27;s admittedly sybaritic literary talent. Rimbaud acts as sadistically to Verlaine as does Verlaine to his young wife, whom he eventually deserts. A violent, itinerant relationship ensues between the two poets, the climax of which arrives in Brussels when a drunken and enraged Verlaine shoots Rimbaud and is sentenced a fine and two years in prison for sodomy and grievous bodily harm.

In prison, Verlaine converts to Christianity, to his former lover&#x27;s disgust. Upon release he meets Rimbaud in Germany, vainly and mistakenly seeking to revive the relationship. The two men part, never to meet again. Bitterly renouncing literature in any form, Rimbaud travels the world alone, finally settling in Abyssinia (modern day Ethiopia) to run a &quot;trading post&quot;. There he has a mistress. A tumour in his right knee forces him back to France where his leg is amputated. Nevertheless, the cancer spreads and he dies at the age of 37. When he dies, the image of one of his most famous poems, &quot;Le Dormeur du val&quot;, appears.

During her conversation with Verlaine, Isabelle Rimbaud asserts that her brother had accepted confession from a priest right before he died, showing Christian penitence, which is why only the censored versions of his poetry should survive. Verlaine pretends to agree but tears up her card after she leaves. Later, Verlaine, drinking absinthe (to which he has become addicted), sees a vision of the sixteen-year-old Rimbaud. The film ends with the young Rimbaud walking alone on a mountain range, Verlaine proclaiming that they were both happy together, and Rimbaud claiming to have finally found eternity.

==Cast==
==Home media==
In 1999, a DVD edition of the film was released. It features both a widescreen and fullscreen version of the film on the same disc as well as the film trailer.

==Reception==
===Critical response===

&quot;Total Eclipse&quot; has an approval rating of 22% on review aggregator website Rotten Tomatoes, based on 18 reviews, and an average rating of 4.5/10, against a 60% score with audiences. Metacritic gives the film a weighted average score of 42 out of 100 based on 17 critics, indicating &quot;mixed or average reviews&quot;. A Variety review by Todd McCarthy describes Total Eclipse as a &quot;poorly executed biographical film that fails to capture the artistic achievements of poets Arthur Rimbaud and Paul Verlaine, instead focusing excessively on their destructive personal relationship, which detracts from the film&#x27;s intended exploration of their artistic contributions.&quot;

<doc id="803787" wikidata="Q3555387" url="?curid=803787" title="Broad church">
<text>Broad church is latitudinarian churchmanship in the Church of England in particular and Anglicanism in general, meaning that the church permits a broad range of opinion on various issues of Anglican doctrine.

In the American Episcopal Church, the term &quot;broad church&quot; historically denoted latitudinarian churchmanship and connoted theological liberalism and modernism, particularly in the years between 1874 and 1934.

==Church of England==

After the terms high church and low church came to distinguish the tendency toward Anglo-Catholicism on the one hand and evangelicalism on the other, those Anglicans tolerant of multiple forms of conformity to ecclesiastical authority came to be referred to as &quot;broad&quot;. The expression apparently originated with A. H. Clough and was current in the later part of the 19th century for Anglicans who objected to positive definitions in theology and sought to interpret Anglican formularies in a broad and liberal sense. Characteristic members of this group were the contributors to &quot;Essays and Reviews&quot;, 1860, and A. P. Stanley. As the name implies, parishes associated with this variety of churchmanship will mix high and low forms, reflective of the often eclectic liturgical and doctrinal preferences of clergy and laity. The emphasis is on allowing individual parishioners&#x27; choice.

Broad church as an expression is now increasingly replaced by references in the Church of England to liberalism. For example, Rowan Williams, the former archbishop of Canterbury, in his &quot;text of reflection&quot; &quot;The Challenge and Hope of Being an Anglican Today&quot;, released in 2006, described the three &quot;components in our heritage&quot; as &quot;strict evangelical Protestantism&quot;, &quot;Roman Catholicism&quot; and &quot;religious liberalism&quot;, accepting that &quot;each of these has a place in the church&#x27;s life&quot;. These would broadly correspond to the low church, high church and broad church parties in the Church of England. 

It has been suggested that &quot;broad&quot; tended to be used to describe those of middle of the road liturgical preferences who leaned theologically towards liberal Protestantism; whilst &quot;central&quot; described those who were theologically conservative, and took the middle way in terms of liturgical practices, following the rubrics of the Prayer Book closely. Broad churchmen might best be described as those who are generally liberal in theology, sometimes culturally conservative, but also supportive of a broad—that is, comprehensive—Anglican Church including both Charismatic and Evangelical Low Church Anglicans, morderately high &quot;Central Church Anglicans&quot;, liberal or &quot;progressive&quot; Anglicans, and Anglo-Catholic Anglicans (though not puritan on the one extreme nor papists on the other). It is not always possible to draw sharp lines between some of these traditions.

== Episcopal Church (United States) ==
According to Bishop Thomas J. Brown, the term &quot;broad church&quot; is not commonly used today, but &quot;was common throughout much of the 20th century.&quot;

=== Historical connotations of liberalism ===

In the American Episcopal Church (TEC), the term &quot;broad church&quot; traditionally represented a desire to accommodate a range of conservative and liberal theological views under one Episcopal umbrella, as opposed to disputes over ritualism, where the terms &quot;low church&quot;/&quot;evangelical&quot; and &quot;high church&quot; ordinarily applied.

On paper and perhaps in practice, Broad Church institutions like the Church Congress in the United States (founded in 1874) and the Episcopal Theological School (founded in 1867) sought to accommodate &quot;&quot;all&quot; parties and positions.&quot; William Reed Huntington, for example, was described as &quot;Broad in the sense of inclusive, not in the sense of Liberal.&quot; Church historian Robert W. Prichard says that the Church Congress&#x27; emphasis on denominational unity helped TEC &quot;avoid[] the divisions over biblical scholarship that marked some other American denominations,&quot; and largely credits the Congress for the fact that TEC never endured &quot;wholesale inquisitions of seminaries or college faculties.&quot;

However, the practical significance of the Broad Church movement was that it gave theological liberalism a foothold in TEC at a time when the low church and high church factions were both dominated by conservatives. Although ostensibly anti-factional, the Church Congress&#x27; leaders were &quot;all progressive liberals in a basically conservative church.&quot; Until the 1870s, TEC&#x27;s conservative leadership had generally taken a neutral stance towards hot-button issues like abolitionism. Following the Civil War, the Broad Church organized to actively support liberal causes. According to TEC, the movement sought to be &quot;more tolerant and liberal than the views of the existing low church and high church parties,&quot; and emphasized &quot;reason as a mediator of religious truth, as opposed to the exclusive reliance on scripture and tradition in the other parties.&quot;

The Broad Church movement provided a space for liberal and progressive theologians who might have been frozen out of more conservative factions. Episcopal Theological School was &quot;the first Episcopal theological seminary to welcome modern biblical scholarship,&quot; and the Broad Church movement &quot;for nearly three decades held a practical monopoly of modernistic views in the American [Episcopal] Church.&quot; Figures like R. Heber Newton (who was accused of heresy several times), his brother William Wilberforce Newton, and Church Congress chairman Charles Lewis Slattery were commonly identified with the Broad Church, although their views might be described as conventionally liberal years after the fact. Heber Newton is now remembered by TEC as a &quot;leading liberal preacher&quot;; William Newton &quot;called for the church ... to appropriate the truths of evolution and science&quot;; and Slattery chaired the commission that revised the Book of Common Prayer to be more gender-inclusive and to de-emphasize the doctrine of original sin.

Once TEC accepted its progressives, the Broad Church&#x27;s emphasis on tolerance became somewhat anachronistic. The revised Book of Common Prayer was published in 1928, and the Church Congress held its last convention in 1934. Many of the Congress&#x27; leaders migrated to the newly established Liberal Evangelical Congress, which first convened in 1933. (The term &quot;evangelical&quot; is a historical artifact. In the 1860s and 1870s, most conservative evangelicals left TEC, often for the Reformed Episcopal Church; as a result, by the mid-1870s, within TEC, the term &quot;evangelical&quot; was largely synonymous with &quot;low-church liberal.&quot; For example, the TEC dictionary describes Broad Church preacher Phillips Brooks, a theological liberal, as a &quot;broad church evangelical,&quot; and stresses that TEC&#x27;s &quot;liberal evangelical&quot; tendency &quot;accept[ed] a critical stance toward the biblical text.&quot;)

=== Contemporary usage ===
Although the term is no longer in general use, certain modern-day Episcopal churches use &quot;broad church&quot; to describe an attitude towards ritual that is between the low church and the high church, somewhat akin to central churchmanship in the Church of England. A broad church parish might favor Holy Eucharist Rite II in the Book of Common Prayer (1979), which uses more contemporary language than Rite I, whereas a high church parish might favor Rite I and a low church parish might alternate between Holy Eucharist Rite II and the even more informal Morning Prayer.

Today, institutions historically associated with the Broad Church (in the Church Congress sense) may now style themselves as low church. Examples include Trinity Church in Boston, which was considered low church under the leadership of Anne Bonnymann (r. 2006-11) but still &quot;continu[ed] to be a Broad Church parish&quot;; and Groton School, where Morning Prayer is still celebrated.

==In politics==
By way of an analogy, the term &quot;broad church&quot; has been used with regard to political parties, particularly the British Labour Party. It can denote both a wide range of ideological views within a single organisation, as well as describe a party that seeks to attract a wide voter base with differing points of view. &quot;Big tent&quot; is a similar term in American politics, also with religious origins.

<text>Caleb Strong Jr. (January 9, 1745 – November 7, 1819) was an American lawyer, politician, and Founding Father who served as the sixth and tenth governor of Massachusetts between 1800 and 1807, and again from 1812 until 1816. He assisted in drafting the Massachusetts State Constitution in 1779 and served as a state senator and on the Massachusetts Governor&#x27;s Council before being elected to the inaugural United States Senate. A leading member of the Massachusetts Federalist Party, his political success delayed the decline of the Federalists in Massachusetts.

A successful Northampton lawyer prior to 1774, Strong was politically active in the rebel cause during the American Revolutionary War. He played an influential role in the development of the United States Constitution at the 1787 Philadelphia Convention and, as a U.S. Senator, in the passage of its 11th Amendment. He also played a leading role in the passage of the Judiciary Act of 1789, which established the federal court system.

Adept at moderating the sometimes harsh political conflict between Federalists and Democratic-Republicans in Massachusetts, he navigated the state in a Federalist direction through the early years of the 19th century as the rest of the country became progressively more Republican. Although he sought to retire from politics after losing the 1807 governor&#x27;s race, the advent of the War of 1812 brought him back to the governor&#x27;s office as a committed opponent of the war. He refused United States Army requests that state militia be placed under army command and in 1814 sought to engage Nova Scotia Governor John Coape Sherbrooke in peace talks. The state and federal governments&#x27; weak defense of Massachusetts&#x27; northern frontier during Strong&#x27;s tenure contributed to the successful drive for Maine&#x27;s statehood, which was granted in 1820.

==Early years==
Caleb Strong was born on January 9, 1745, in Northampton, one of the principal towns of Hampshire County on the Connecticut River in the Province of Massachusetts Bay. His parents were Phebe Lyman Strong and Caleb Strong, the latter a descendant of early Massachusetts settlers such as John Strong, a 1630 immigrant to Massachusetts who was one of the founders of Northampton and the lead elder of the church for many years. Caleb was their only son. He received his early education from Rev. Samuel Moody and entered Harvard College in 1760, graduating four years later with high honors. He was shortly thereafter afflicted with smallpox, which temporarily blinded him and prevented him from engaging in the study of law for several years. He studied law with Joseph Hawley, was admitted to the bar in 1772, and began the practice of law in Northampton. Hawley was also a political mentor, shaping Strong&#x27;s views on relations between the Colonies and Great Britain.

==American Revolution==
Strong and Hawley were both elected to the Massachusetts Provincial Congress in 1774. When the Revolutionary War broke out in 1775, Strong was unable to serve in the military because of his damaged sight, but he was otherwise active in the Patriot cause. He served on the Northampton Committee of Safety and in other local offices but refused service in the Continental Congress. He was a delegate to the 1779 Massachusetts Constitutional Convention and was elected to the committee that drafted the state constitution, ratified in 1780. He then served on the first governor&#x27;s council and in the state senate from 1780 to 1789.

Strong&#x27;s legal practice thrived during the tumultuous war years and was one of the most successful in Hampshire County. He became a judge of the Court of Common Pleas in 1775 and was appointed county attorney of Hampshire County the following year, a post he held until 1800. On more than one occasion he was offered a seat on the state&#x27;s supreme court but rejected the position on account of its inadequate salary. Strong was described by a contemporary as meticulously detailed in his preparation of legal paperwork and a persuasive advocate when speaking to a jury.

In 1781 Strong was one of the lawyers (another was Worcester lawyer and future United States Attorney General Levi Lincoln Sr.) who worked on a series of legal cases surrounding Quock Walker, a former slave seeking to claim his freedom. One of the cases, &quot;Commonwealth of Massachusetts v. Nathaniel Jennison&quot;, firmly established that slavery was incompatible with the new state constitution.

==Philadelphia Convention and United States Senator==
Strong was elected as a delegate to the Philadelphia Convention that drafted the 1787 Constitution. A committed Federalist, Strong opposed the idea of the Electoral College as a means of electing the president, instead supporting the idea that the legislature should choose him. Although he initially opposed proposals that the number of senators should be equal for all states, he eventually changed his mind, enabling passage of the Connecticut Compromise. To temper the power of the states, he introduced language requiring tax legislation to originate in the House of Representatives. Illness of his wife forced him to return to Massachusetts before the work was completed, so he did not sign the document. He was a vocal supporter of its adoption by the state&#x27;s ratifying convention.

When the Constitution came into force in 1789, Strong was chosen by the state legislature to serve in the United States Senate. As what is now known as a Class 2 Senator he came up for reelection in 1792, when he was again chosen. He was one of the principal drafters of the Judiciary Act of 1789, which established the federal courts. He was also instrumental in 1793 and 1794 in the development and passage by Congress of the 11th Amendment to the United States Constitution. This measure was enacted in response to &quot;Chisholm v. Georgia&quot;, a Supreme Court decision in which a private individual sued the state of Georgia. The amendment expanded the sovereign immunity of states to limit suits against them by private individuals from other states.

Strong was also one of a small group of senators who convinced President George Washington in 1794 that a special envoy should be sent to Britain in order to avert war, and who convinced John Jay to accept that role. Jay ended up negotiating what became known as the Jay Treaty, which resolved a number of issues between the two nations but also angered the leadership of Revolutionary France and was widely disliked, criticized, and opposed by Republicans. Strong resigned his seat in 1796 and returned to private life in Northampton.

==First term as governor==
In the election of 1800, Strong was nominated by the Federalists as their candidate for governor; his principal opponent was Elbridge Gerry, nominated by the Democratic-Republicans. Strong was criticized by his opponents for his lack of military service and for the fact that he was a lawyer; he countered by asserting his patriotism through his association with Joseph Hawley. His popularity in the western part of the state was decisive: the wide margin by which he won there overcame the smaller advantage by which Gerry carried the east. Acting Governor Moses Gill died ten days before Strong took office at the end of May.
Strong won annual reelection to the governor&#x27;s seat until 1807. During this tenure, the state introduced a new penitentiary system and reformed the judiciary, reducing the number of judges. Strong&#x27;s time as governor was also marked by virulent political debate in the state, principally over foreign policy related to British interference with Massachusetts maritime trade. That interference was a consequence of the ongoing Napoleonic Wars engulfing Europe. Over the years of Strong&#x27;s tenure, the Republicans gradually gained in power both nationally and in Massachusetts.

In the 1806 election, the Republicans secured a majority in the Massachusetts assembly, and the gubernatorial election was notably close. Running mainly against James Sullivan, Strong barely received a majority of the votes cast. With fewer than 200 votes in the balance, the Republican-controlled legislature scrutinized the returns in a partisan manner, discarding ballots that had misspelled Strong&#x27;s name while retaining those that misspelled Sullivan&#x27;s and performing tallies in ways that favored their candidate. This process concluded with a finding that Strong in fact lacked a majority of votes, which was required to carry the election, as opposed to the modern plurality requirement. Strong&#x27;s Federalist allies in the legislature were able to publicize the partisan nature of the analysis, resulting in a hostile public backlash. He was proclaimed the winner after further, less biased, analysis corrected the count in his favor. However, in the 1807 election the rising tide of Republicanism swept Strong (along with other New England Federalists) out of office. Federalists asked him to run in 1808, but he refused, noting that he had &quot;done his part&quot; and that his home base in Hampshire County was strongly Federalist.

==Second term and War of 1812==

In 1812 Strong was convinced by Massachusetts Federalist leaders to come out of retirement to run once again for governor. War with Britain was imminent, and the Federalists sought a strong candidate to oppose Elbridge Gerry, who had been victorious against Christopher Gore in the previous two elections. Gerry, who had originally been somewhat moderate, became increasingly partisan during his tenure, and Federalists viewed Strong&#x27;s earlier success in office and relatively modest demeanor as assets. Strong&#x27;s victory in the election, which saw the Federalists also regain control of the legislature, was attributed to several factors: Federalists capitalized on the partisanship of the recent redistricting of the state that resulted in the coining of the term &quot;gerrymander&quot;, and there was strong anti-war sentiment in the state. Strong was reelected by wide margins in the following war years.
Strong took a principled stand against the War of 1812, generally refusing to assist federal government efforts to prosecute the war. Strong was part of a chorus of Massachusetts (and more broadly New England) Federalists who complained that in &quot;Mr. Madison&#x27;s War&quot; the federal government was trampling state and individual rights. He adhered to the view that state militia could not be required to serve under regular army command. When the first such requests were made by U. S. Army General Henry Dearborn, Strong refused and was backed by the Governor&#x27;s Council as well as the Supreme Judicial Court. He argued that there was no need to call out the militia because invasion was not imminent. Because of his stance against regular army command, the state was denied a shipment of arms that was instead diverted to frontier areas and the war theater. Strong also took no particular actions to prevent widespread smuggling along the state&#x27;s frontiers with the neighboring British provinces.

Strong&#x27;s opposition to regular army control was more nuanced than that of neighboring Connecticut Governor John Cotton Smith, who ensured that his militia always remained under state command. Strong was more concerned that the state militia not be used except in defense of the state&#x27;s borders, and he compromised on the issue of command. In 1812, not long after refusing General Dearborn&#x27;s request, he authorized the dispatch of militia companies to the state&#x27;s eastern district (now Maine) under U.S. Army command.

With the British naval blockade tightening and threatening the state&#x27;s coastal communities in early 1814, Strong authorized Brigadier General Thomas H. Cushing to command militia forces in the defenses of Boston Harbor, subject to reasonable limitations. Cushing was transferred to Connecticut, and General Dearborn again commanded the regular army forces in Massachusetts. Dearborn interpreted the agreement Strong had made with Cushing to apply statewide and began reorganizing militia companies to conform to regular army practices. This engendered ill will among the militia, and Strong refused to place additional levies under Dearborn&#x27;s command.
The defense of Maine, however, proved problematic. Strong&#x27;s aide William H. Sumner negotiated an agreement with the Army command for the defense of Portland, but the ironically Republican-dominated district militia objected, first to the idea of serving under any regular army leadership, and then to serving under a relatively low-ranked officer (a lieutenant colonel) who was given command of Portland after the agreement was signed. Several units of local militia refused the perform their assigned duties. One consequence of the dispute was that most militia in the state remained under state control and were thus paid from state coffers at a cost of around $200,000 per month. This further strained the state economy, which was already suffering because of the British blockade.

Following the British seizure of Castine in September 1814, Strong called the legislature into session early in October to respond to the occupation. Given that the federal government was unwilling to fund militia not under its control, the legislature authorized Strong to borrow money to fund a major expansion of the militia, but most of the funds acquired were spent improving Boston&#x27;s defenses. Another result of the special session was a call for a meeting of states opposed to the war, which became known as the Hartford Convention. Around the time of the convention, which was held in Hartford, Connecticut, beginning in December 1814, Strong secretly wrote to Nova Scotia Lieutenant-Governor Sir John Coape Sherbrooke, essentially offering a separate peace in exchange for the return of the seized territory. He also refused to authorize temporary Massachusetts funding for a federally led expedition to recover Castine, leading to further cries of indignation from Maine&#x27;s Republicans. The Treaty of Ghent ended the war before the Nova Scotia negotiations went anywhere. Strong&#x27;s policies during the war are credited as one of the reasons for Maine&#x27;s drive for statehood, which came to a successful conclusion in 1820.

In 1816, with the war at an end, Strong decided once again to retire from politics. Strong died in Northampton on November 7, 1819, and was buried in its Bridge Street Cemetery.

==Family, charity, and legacy==
In 1777 Strong married Sarah Hooker, the daughter of a local pastor and descendant of Thomas Hooker, founder and first governor of Connecticut. They had nine children, four of whom survived the couple. Strong was active in his church and was a leading member of local missionary and Bible societies. He was a founding member of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences and a member of the Massachusetts Historical Society. In 1813, Strong was elected a member of the American Antiquarian Society.

 The town of Strong, Maine, incorporated in 1801, was named for Strong, and Windham Township, Portage County, Ohio was originally named Strongsburg in his honor. The Strongsburg land had been allocated to Strong as part of his ownership share in the Ohio Company and had been sold by him and several minority partners in 1810.

<text>Henry Alvah Strong (August 30, 1838 – July 26, 1919) was an American photography businessman. He was the first president of the Eastman Kodak Company.

==Early life and family==
Henry Strong was born on August 30, 1838, in Rochester, New York. He graduated from Wyoming Academy in 1858. On August 30, 1859, he married Helen Phoebe Griffin. They had three children: Gertrude Achilles, Helen Carter, and Henry G. Strong. After Helen&#x27;s death in 1904 from diabetes, he married Hattie (Corrin) Lockwood on June 14, 1905. He adopted her son, Corrin, and the family returned to Rochester, New York.

==Business ventures==

Strong held a lead position in his family&#x27;s buggy whip manufacturing company prior to meeting George Eastman in 1870. The two entered a partnership in 1880 and the Eastman Dry Plate Company was founded on January 1, 1881, with Strong as president and Eastman as treasurer. It would later become Eastman Kodak Company.

Strong died at his home in Rochester on July 26, 1919.

==Legacy==
Numerous buildings in Rochester, notably Strong Memorial Hospital and Strong Auditorium at the University of Rochester were built from his philanthropy.

<text>In Anglican Christianity, the term low church refers to those who give little emphasis to ritual, often having an emphasis on preaching, individual salvation and personal conversion. The term is most often used in a liturgical sense, denoting a Protestant emphasis, whereas &quot;high church&quot; denotes an emphasis on ritual, often Anglo-Catholic.

The term was initially pejorative. During the series of doctrinal and ecclesiastic challenges to the established church in the 17th century, commentators and others – who favoured the theology, worship, and hierarchical structure of Anglicanism (such as the episcopate) as the true form of Christianity – began referring to that outlook (and the related practices) as &quot;high church&quot;, and by the early 18th century those theologians and politicians who sought more reform in the English church and a greater liberalisation of church structure were in contrast called &quot;low church&quot;.

To an outsider, the difference between high church and low church may not be immediately obvious. There is a strong tradition of spiritual flexibility in Anglicanism, and many churches do not wish to exclude those who prefer one or the other. Most local churches do not identify as one or the other, and may try to accommodate many forms of worship. Churches that are more lax in ritual generally do not advertise as such, and the vast majority of Anglican churches, including most low church congregations, follow some kind of fixed liturgy. Low-church congregations, however, typically have plainer-looking churches, prefer modern language, have some aspects of contemporary worship, and include more roles for laypersons during service. One definite indicator of a low-church parish are infrequent services for performing sacraments such as the Eucharist. Many low-church parishes are strongly influenced by evangelicalism and individual religious experience, resulting in a tradition called Evangelical Anglicanism.

==Historical use==
The term &quot;low church&quot; was used in the early part of the 18th century as the equivalent of the term &quot;Latitudinarian&quot; in that it was used to refer to values that provided much latitude in matters of discipline and faith. The term was in contradistinction to the term &quot;high church&quot;, or high churchmen, which applied to those who valued the exclusive authority of the Established Church, the episcopacy and the sacramental system.

Low churchmen wished to tolerate Puritan opinions within the Church of England, though they might not be in agreement with Puritan liturgical practices. The movement to bring Separatists, and in particular Presbyterians, back into the Church of England ended with the Act of Toleration 1689 for the most part. Though &quot;Low church&quot; continued to be used for those clergy holding a more liberal view of Dissenters, the term eventually fell into disuse.

Both terms were revived in the 19th century when the Tractarian movement brought the term &quot;high churchman&quot; into vogue. The terms were again used in a modified sense, now used to refer to those who exalted the idea of the Church as a catholic entity as the body of Christ, and the sacramental system as the divinely given means of grace. A low churchman now became the equivalent of an evangelical Anglican, the designation of the movement associated with the name of Charles Simeon, which held the necessity of personal conversion to be of primary importance.

At the same time, Latitudinarian changed to &quot;broad church&quot;, or broad churchmen, designating those who most valued the ethical teachings of the Church and minimised the value of orthodoxy. The revival of pre-Reformation ritual by many of the high church clergy led to the designation &quot;ritualist&quot; being applied to them in a somewhat contemptuous sense. However, the terms high churchman and ritualist have often been wrongly treated as interchangeable. The high churchman of the Catholic type is further differentiated from the earlier use of what is sometimes described as the &quot;high and dry type&quot; of the period before the Oxford Movement.

==Modern use==
In contemporary usage, &quot;low churches&quot; place more emphasis on the Protestant nature of Anglicanism than broad or high churches and are usually Evangelical in their belief and (although not necessarily &quot;traditional&quot;) in practice. They may tend to favour liturgy such as the &quot;Common Worship&quot; over &quot;Book of Common Prayer&quot;, services of Morning and Evening Prayer over the Eucharist, and many use the minimum of formal liturgy permitted by church law. The Diocese of Sydney has largely abandoned the Prayer Book and uses free-form evangelical services. 

Some contemporary low churches also incorporate elements of charismatic Christianity.

More traditional low church Anglicans, under the influence of Calvinist or Reformed thought inherited from the Reformation era, reject the doctrine that the sacraments confer grace &quot;ex opere operato&quot; (e.g., baptismal regeneration) and lay stress on the Bible as the ultimate source of authority in matters of faith necessary for salvation. They are often prepared to cooperate with other Protestants on nearly equal terms. Some low church Anglicans of the Reformed party consider themselves the only faithful adherents of historic Anglicanism and emphasise the Thirty-Nine Articles of the Church of England as an official doctrinal statement of the Anglican tradition.

==Ecumenical relationships==

===United churches with Protestants in Asia===
Several provinces of the Anglican Communion in Asia have merged with Protestant churches. The Church of South India arose out of a merger of the southern province of the Church of India, Pakistan, Burma and Ceylon (Anglican), the Methodist Church of South India and the South India United Church (a Congregationalist, Reformed and Presbyterian united church) in 1947. In the 1990s a small number of Baptist and Pentecostal churches joined also the union. 

In 1970 the Church of India, Pakistan, Burma and Ceylon, the United Church of North India, the Baptist Churches of Northern India, the Church of the Brethren in India, the Methodist Church (British and Australia Conferences) and the Disciples of Christ denominations merged to form the Church of North India. Also in 1970 the Anglicans, Presbyterians (Church of Scotland), United Methodists and Lutherans of Churches in Pakistan merged into the Church of Pakistan. The Church of Bangladesh is the result of a merge of Anglican and Presbyterian churches.

===Great Britain and Ireland===
In the 1960s the Methodist Church of Great Britain made ecumenical overtures to the Church of England, aimed at church unity. These formally failed when they were rejected by the Church of England&#x27;s General Synod in 1972. In 1981, a covenant project was proposed between the Church of England, the Methodist Church in Great Britain, the United Reformed Church and the Moravian Church.

In 1982 the United Reformed Church voted in favour of the covenant, which would have meant remodelling its elders and moderators as bishops and incorporating its ministry into the apostolic succession. The Church of England rejected the covenant. Conversations and co-operation continued leading in 2003 to the signing of a covenant between the Church of England and the Methodist Church of Great Britain. From the 1970s onward, the Methodist Church was involved in several &quot;Local Ecumenical Projects&quot; (LEPs) with neighbouring denominations usually with the Church of England, the Baptists or with the United Reformed Church, which involved sharing churches, schools and in some cases ministers.

In the Church of England, Anglo-Catholics are often opposed to unity with Protestants, which can reduce hope of unity with the Roman Catholic Church. Accepting women Protestant ministers would also make unity with the See of Rome more difficult.

In the 1990s and early 2000s the Scottish Episcopal Church (Anglican), the Church of Scotland (Presbyterian), the Methodist Church of Great Britain and the United Reformed Church were all parts of the &quot;Scottish Churches Initiative for Union&quot; (SCIFU) for seeking greater unity. The attempt stalled following the withdrawal of the Church of Scotland in 2003.

In 2002 the Church of Ireland, which is generally on the low church end of the spectrum of world Anglicanism, signed a covenant for greater cooperation and potential ultimate unity with the Methodist Church in Ireland.

<text>The Irish elk (Megaloceros giganteus), also called the giant deer or Irish deer, is an extinct species of deer in the genus &quot;Megaloceros&quot; and is one of the largest deer that ever lived. Its range extended across Eurasia during the Pleistocene, from Ireland (where it is known from abundant remains found in bogs) to Lake Baikal in Siberia. The most recent remains of the species have been radiocarbon dated to about 7,700 years ago in western Russia. Its antlers, which can span across are the largest known of any deer. It is not closely related to either living species called the elk, with it being widely agreed that its closest living relatives are fallow deer (&quot;Dama&quot;).

==Taxonomy==
===Research history===
The first scientific descriptions of the animal&#x27;s remains were made by Irish physician Thomas Molyneux in 1695, who identified large antlers from Dardistown—which were apparently commonly unearthed in Ireland—as belonging to the elk (known as the moose in North America), concluding that it was once abundant on the island. It was first formally named as &quot;Alce gigantea&quot; by Johann Friedrich Blumenbach in his &quot;Handbuch der Naturgeschichte&quot; in 1799, with &quot;Alce&quot; being a variant of &quot;Alces&quot;, the Latin name for the elk. The original Blumenbach&#x27;s description of &quot;Alce gigantea&quot; provides rather scant information about the species, specifying only that this particular kind of &quot;fossil elk&quot; comes from Ireland and is characterized by immense body size. According to Blumenbach, the distance between summits of giant deer antlers may attain . This particular feature mentioned by Blumenbach permitted to Roman Croitor to identify the type specimen of giant deer that was figured and described for the first time in Louthiana of Thomas Wright. The holotype of &quot;Megaloceros giganteus&quot; (Blumenbach, 1799) is a well-preserved male skull with exceptionally large antlers found in Dunleer environs (County Louth, Ireland). The type specimen of giant deer is currently exposed in Barmeath Castle where Thomas Wright first saw and described it.

French scientist Georges Cuvier documented in 1812 that the Irish elk did not belong to any species of mammal currently living, declaring it &quot;le plus célèbre de tous les ruminans fossiles&quot; (the most famous of all fossil ruminants). In 1827 Joshua Brookes, in a listing of his zoological collection, named the new genus &quot;Megaloceros&quot; (spelled &quot;Megalocerus&quot; in the earlier editions) in the following passage:

The etymology being from Greek: &quot;great&quot; + &quot;horn, antler&quot;. The type and only species named in the description being &quot;Megaloceros antiquorum&quot;, based on Irish remains now considered to belong to &quot;M. giganteus&quot;, making the former a junior synonym. The original description was considered by Adrian Lister in 1987 to be inadequate for a taxonomic definition. In 1828 Brookes published an expanded list in the form of a catalogue for an upcoming auction, which included the Latin phrase &quot;Cornibus deciduis palmatis&quot; (meaning &quot;deciduous palmate antlers&quot;) as a description of the remains. The 1828 publication was approved by International Commission on Zoological Nomenclature (ICZN) in 1977 as an available publication for the basis of zoological nomenclature. Adrian Lister in 1987 judged that &quot;the phase &quot;Cornibus deciduis palmatis&quot; constitutes a definition sufficient under the [International Code of Zoological Nomenclature] (article 12) to validate &quot;Megalocerus&quot;.&quot; The original spelling of &quot;Megalocerus&quot; was never used after its original publication.In 1844 Richard Owen named another synonym of the Irish elk, including it within the newly named subgenus &quot;Megaceros&quot;, &quot;Cervus&quot; (&quot;Megaceros&quot;) &quot;hibernicus&quot;. This has been suggested to be derived from another junior synonym of the Irish elk described by J. Hart in 1825, &quot;Cervus megaceros&quot;. Despite being a junior synonym, &quot;Megaloceros&quot; remained in obscurity and &quot;Megaceros&quot; became the common genus name for the taxon. The combination &quot;Megaceros giganteus&quot; was in use by 1871. George Gaylord Simpson in 1945 revived the original &quot;Megaloceros&quot; name, which became progressively more widely used, until a taxonomic decision in 1989 by the ICZN confirmed the priority of &quot;Megaloceros&quot; over &quot;Megaceros&quot;, and &quot;Megaloceros&quot; to be the correct spelling.

Before the 20th century, the Irish elk, having evolved from smaller ancestors with smaller antlers, was taken as a prime example of orthogenesis (directed evolution), an evolutionary mechanism opposed to Darwinian evolution in which the successive species within the lineage become increasingly modified in a single undeviating direction, evolution proceeding in a straight line void of natural selection. Orthogenesis was claimed to have caused an evolutionary trajectory towards antlers that became larger and larger, eventually causing the species&#x27; extinction because the antlers grew to sizes which inhibited proper feeding habits and caused the animal to become trapped in tree branches. In the 1930s, orthogenesis was disputed by Darwinians led by Julian Huxley, who noted that antler size was not grossly large, and was proportional to body size. The currently favoured view is that sexual selection was the driving force behind the large antlers rather than orthogenesis or natural selection.

===Evolution===

&quot;M. giganteus&quot; belongs to the genus &quot;Megaloceros.&quot; &quot;Megaloceros&quot; has often been placed into the tribe Megacerini, alongside other genera often collectively referred to as &quot;giant deer&quot;, like &quot;Sinomegaceros&quot; and &quot;Praemegaceros&quot;.&quot;&quot; The taxonomy of giant deer lacks consensus, with genus names used for species varying substantially between authors. The earliest possible record of the genus is a partial antler from the Early Pleistocene MN 17 (2.5–1.8 Ma) of Stavropol Krai in the North Caucasus of Russia, which were given the name of &quot;M. stavropolensis&quot; in 2016, however this species has been subsequently suggested to belong to &quot;Arvernoceros&quot;. or &quot;Sinomegaceros&quot;. The oldest generally accepted records of the genus are from the late Early Pleistocene. Other species often considered to belong to &quot;Megaloceros&quot; include the reindeer sized &quot;M. savini&quot;, which is known from early Middle Pleistocene (~700,000–450,000 years ago) localities in England, France, Spain and Germany, and the more recently described species &quot;M. novocarthaginiensis&quot;, which is known from late Early Pleistocene (0.9–0.8 Ma) localities in Spain, and the small &quot;M. matritensis&quot; endemic to the Iberian peninsula during the late Middle Pleistocene (~400,000 to 250,000 years ago), which overlaps chronologically with the earliest &quot;M. giganteus&quot; records. Jan van der Made proposed &quot;M. novocarthaginiensis , M. savini&quot; and &quot;M. matritensis&quot; to be sequential chronospecies, due to shared morphological characteristics not found in &quot;M. giganteus&quot; and gradual transition of morphological characters through time. &quot;M. savini&quot; and related species have also been suggested to comprise the separate genus &quot;Praedama&quot; by other authors. While the &quot;M. savini/Praedama&quot; lineage is often suggested to be closely related &quot;to M. giganteus,&quot; most authors agree that this group of deer is unlikely to be directly ancestral to &quot;M. giganteus&quot;. 

The origin of &quot;M. giganteus&quot; remains unclear, and appears to lie outside Western Europe. Jan van der Made has suggested that remains of an indeterminate &quot;Megaloceros&quot; species from the late Early Pleistocene (~1.2 Ma) of Libakos in Greece are closer to &quot;M. giganteus&quot; than the &quot;M. novocarthaginiensis-savini-matritensis&quot; lineage due to the shared molarisation of the lower fourth premolar (P4). Croitor has suggested that &quot;M. giganteus&quot; is closely related to what was originally described as &quot;Dama clactoniana mugharensis&quot; (which he proposes be named &quot;Megaloceros mugharensis&quot;) from the Middle Pleistocene of Tabun Cave in Israel, due to similarities in the antlers, molars and premolars. The earliest possible records of &quot;M. giganteus&quot; comes from Homersfield, England thought to be about 450,000 years ago—though the dating is uncertain. The oldest securely dated Middle Pleistocene records are those from Hoxne, England, which have been dated to Marine Isotope Stage 11 (424,000 to 374,000 years ago), other Middle Pleistocene early records include Steinheim an der Murr, Germany, (classified as &quot;M. g. antecedens&quot;) about 400,000–300,000 years ago and Swanscombe, England. Most remains of the Irish elk are known from the Late Pleistocene. A large proportion of the known remains of &quot;M. giganteus&quot; are from Ireland, which mostly date to the Allerød oscillation near the end of the Late Pleistocene around 13,000 years ago. Over 100 individuals have been found in Ballybetagh Bog near Dublin.

Some authors have proposed that Late Pleistocene &quot;M. giganteus&quot; should be divided into several subspecies including &quot;M. giganteus ruffii&quot; and &quot;M. giganteus giganteus,&quot; based primarily on differences in antler morphology&quot;.&quot;

It has been historically thought that, because both have palmated antlers, the Irish elk and fallow deer (&quot;Dama&quot; spp.) are closely related, this is supported by several other morphological similarities, including the lack of upper canines, proportionally long braincase and nasal bones, and proportionally short front portion of the skull. In 2005, two fragments of mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) from the cytochrome b gene were extracted and sequenced from 4 antlers and a bone, the mtDNA found that the Irish elk was nested within &quot;Cervus,&quot; and were inside the clade containing living red deer (&quot;Cervus elaphus&quot;). Based on this, the authors suggested that the Irish elk and red deer interbred. However, another study from the same year in the journal &quot;Nature&quot; utilising both fragmentary mitochondrial DNA and morphological data found that the Irish elk was indeed most closely related to &quot;Dama&quot;. The close relationship with &quot;Dama&quot; was supported by another cytochrome b study in 2006, a 2015 study involving the full mitochondrial genome, and by a 2017 morphological analysis of the bony labyrinth. The 2006 and 2017 studies also directly suggest that the results of the 2005 cytochrome b paper were the result of DNA contamination.

A study of mitochondrial genomes from &quot;Sinomegaceros&quot; from the Late Pleistocene of East Asia found that the mitochondrial genomes of &quot;Megaloceros giganteus&quot; were nested within those of &quot;Sinomegaceros,&quot; suggesting that the two lineages interbred after their initial split.

== Description ==
The Irish elk stood about tall at the shoulders, and had large palmate (flat and broad) antlers, the largest of any known deer, with the largest specimens reaching over from tip to tip (though it is rare for specimens to exceed across) and in weight. The antlers are considerably larger than those of living moose, being on average over twice the volume of moose antlers. For body size, at about and up to or more, the Irish elk was the heaviest known cervine (&quot;Old World deer&quot;); and tied with the extant Alaska moose (&quot;Alces alces gigas&quot;) as the third largest known deer, after the extinct &quot;Cervalces latifrons&quot; and &quot;Cervalces scotti&quot;. The shape and span of the antlers varied significantly over time and space, likely reflecting some populations adaptation to forested environments. Compared to &quot;Alces&quot;, Irish elk appear to have had a more robust skeleton, with older and more mature &quot;Alces&quot; skeletons bearing some resemblance to those of prime Irish elk, and younger Irish elk resembling prime &quot;Alces&quot;. Likely due to different social structures, the Irish elk exhibits more marked sexual dimorphism than &quot;Alces&quot;, with Irish elk bucks being notably larger than does. In total, Irish elk bucks may have ranged from , with an average of , and does may have been relatively large, about 80% of buck size, or on average. The distinguishing characters of &quot;M. giganteus&quot; include concave frontals, proportionally long braincase, proportionally short front section of the skull (orbitofrontal region), alongside the absence of upper canines and the molarisation of the lower fourth premolar (P4). The skull and mandible of the Irish elk exhibit substantial thickening (pachyostosis), with the early and complete obliteration of cranial sutures.

Based on Upper Palaeolithic cave paintings, the Irish elk seems to have had overall light colouration, with a dark stripe running along the back, a stripe on either side from shoulder to haunch, a dark collar on the throat and a chinstrap, and a dark hump on the withers (between the shoulder blades). In 1989, American palaeontologist Dale Guthrie suggested that, like bison, the hump allowed a higher hinging action of the front legs to increase stride length while running. Valerius Geist suggested that the hump may have also been used to store fat. Localising fat rather than evenly distributing it may have prevented overheating while running or in rut during the summer.

==Habitat==
The Irish elk had a far-reaching range, extending from the Atlantic Ocean in the West to Lake Baikal in the East. Irish elk do not appear have extended northward onto the open mammoth steppe in Siberia, rather keeping to the boreal steppe-woodland environments, which consisted of scattered spruce and pine, as well as low-lying herbs and shrubs including grasses, sedges, &quot;Ephedra, Artemisia&quot; and Chenopodiaceae. The species appears to have had a degree of ecological plasticity, as during interglacial periods prior to the Holocene, the species was present in temperate forested environments in Europe. During these times, the species generally had less broad antlers than during glacial periods, likely as an adaptation to moving through forested environments.

== Palaeobiology ==

=== Physiology ===

In 1998, Canadian biologist Valerius Geist hypothesised that the Irish elk was cursorial (adapted for running and stamina). He noted that the Irish elk physically resembled reindeer. The body proportions of the Irish elk are similar to those of the cursorial addax, oryx, and saiga antelope. These include the relatively short legs, the long front legs nearly as long as the hind legs, and a robust cylindrical body. Cursorial saiga, gnus, and reindeer have a top speed of over , and can maintain high speeds for up to 15 minutes.

===Reproduction===

At Ballybetagh Bog, over 100 Irish elk individuals were found, all small antlered bucks. This indicates that bucks and does segregated during at least winter and spring. Many modern deer species do this partly because males and females have different nutritional requirements and need to consume different types of plants. Segregation would also imply a polygynous society, with stags fighting for control over harems during rut. Because most of the individuals found were juvenile or geriatric and were likely suffering from malnutrition, they probably died from winterkill. Most Irish elk specimens known may have died from winterkill, and winterkill is the highest source of mortality among many modern deer species. Bucks generally suffer higher mortality rates because they eat little during the autumn rut. For rut, a lean stag normally may have fattened up to , and would burn through the extra fat over the next month.

Assuming a similar response to starvation as red deer, a large, healthy Irish elk stag with antlers would have had antlers under poor conditions; and an average sized Irish elk stag with antlers would have had antlers under poorer conditions, similar sizes to the moose. A similar change in a typical Irish elk population with prime stags having antlers would result in antler weights of or less in worsening climatic conditions. This is within the range of present-day wapiti/red deer (&quot;Cervus&quot; spp.) antler weights. Irish elk antlers vary widely in form depending upon the habitat, such as a compact, upright shape in closed forest environments. Irish elk likely shed their antlers and re-grew a new pair during mating season. Antlers generally require high amounts of calcium and phosphate, especially those for stags which have larger structures, and the massive antlers of Irish elk may have required much greater quantities. Stags typically meet these requirements in part from their bones, suffering from a condition similar to osteoporosis while the antlers are growing, and replenishing them from food plants after the antlers have grown in or reclaiming nutrients from shed antlers.

The large antlers have generally been explained as being used for male-male battle during mating season. They may have also been used for display, to attract females and assert dominance against rival males. A finite element analysis of the antlers suggested that during fighting, the antlers were likely to interlock around the middle tine, the high stress when interlocking on the distal tine suggests that the fighting was likely more constrained and predictable than among extant deer, likely involving twisting motions, as is known in extant deer with palmated antlers.

In deer, gestation time generally increases with body size. A doe may have had a gestation period of about 274 days. Based on this and patterns seen in modern deer, last year&#x27;s antlers in Irish elk bucks were potentially shed in early March, peak antler growth in early June, completion by mid-July, shedding velvet (a layer of blood vessels on the antlers in-use while growing them) by late July, and the height of rut falling on the second week of August. Geist, believing the Irish elk to have been a cursorial animal, concluded that a doe would have to have produced nutrient-rich milk so that her calf would have enough energy and stamina to keep up with the herd.

=== Diet and life history ===

The mesodont (meaning neither high (hypsodont) or low (brachydont) crowned) condition of the teeth suggests that the species was a mixed feeder, being able to both browse and graze. Pollen remains from teeth found in the North Sea around 43,000 years old were found to be dominated by &quot;Artemisia&quot; and other Asteraceae, with minor &quot;Plantago&quot;, &quot;Helianthemum&quot;, Plumbaginaceae and willow (&quot;Salix&quot;). Another earlier specimen from the Netherlands (dating to the Eemian interglacial or early in the Last Glacial Period) was found to have pollen of Apiaceae, including cow parsley (&quot;Anthriscus sylvestris&quot;), cow parsnip/hogweed (&quot;Heracleum&quot;), water pennywort (&quot;Hydrocotyle&quot;), Asteraeceae, &quot;Filipendula&quot;, &quot;Symphytum&quot; and grass embedded with its teeth. A stable isotope analysis of the terminal Pleistocene Irish population suggests a grass and forb based diet, supplemented by browsing during stressed periods. Dental wear patterns of specimens from the late Middle and Late Pleistocene of Britain suggest a diet tending towards mixed feeding and grazing, but with a wide range including leaf browsing. Comparisons of &quot;δ&quot;15N between Irish elk and red deer at the Middle Pleistocene site of Schöningen in Germany suggest that grasses were a more important component of the former&#x27;s diet relative to the latter.

Examination of histological sections of their long bones suggests that the species has relatively rapid growth rates, reaching skeletal maturity by around 6 years of age. Analysis of the cementum layers of their teeth suggests that Irish elk reached a maximum lifespan of at least 19 years, comparable to moose.

Based on the dietary requirements of red deer, a lean Irish elk stag would have needed to consume of fresh forage daily. Assuming antler growth occurred over a span of 120 days, a stag would have required 1,372 g (3 lb) of protein daily, as well as access to nutrient- and mineral-dense forage starting about a month before antlers began sprouting and continuing until they had fully grown. Such forage is not very common, and stags perhaps sought after aquatic plants in lakes. After antler growing, stags could probably satisfy their nutritional requirements in productive sedge lands bordered by willow and birch forests.

Gnaw marks on found on Irish elk bones indicates that they were preyed on or scavenged by cave hyenas.

== Relationship with early humans ==
At a number of Middle Paleolithic sites, remains of &quot;M. giganteus&quot; have been found with cut marks indicating butchery by Neanderthals. These include Bolomor Cave in Spain, dating to around 180,000 years ago, and De Nadale Cave and Riparo del Broion in northern Italy, dating to 71-69,000 and 50-44,000 years ago, respectively. Other sites probably resulting from exploitation of Irish elk by Neanderthals include Abri du Maras in southeast France, dating to 55-40,000 years ago. A mandible from Ofatinţi, Moldova dating to either the Eemian or the early Late Pleistocene, has been noted for having &quot;tool-made notches on its lateral side&quot;.

A handful of Irish elk depictions are known from the art of the Upper Paleolithic in Europe. However, these are much less abundant than the common red deer and reindeer depictions. Only a handful of examples of modern human interaction are known. Several &quot;M. giganteus&quot; bones from the Chatelperronian levels of the Labeko Koba site in Spain are noted for bearing puncture marks, which have been interpreted as anthropogenic. A terminal Pleistocene (13,710-13,215 cal BP) skull from Lüdersdorf, Germany is noted to have had the antler and facial part of the skull deliberately removed. A calcaneum from an associated lower hind limb from the early Holocene site of Sosnovy Tushamsky in Siberia is noted to have &quot;two short and deep traces of cutting blows&quot;, which are interpreted as &quot;clear evidence of butchery&quot;. The use of shed antler bases is also known, at the terminal Pleistocene (Allerød) Endingen VI site in Germany, a shed antler base appears to have been used in a way analogous to a lithic core to produce &quot;blanks&quot; for the manufacture of barbed projectile tips. A ring-like mark on a shed antler beam from the similarly aged Paderborn site in Germany has been suggested to be anthropogenic.

==Extinction==
Outside of the Irish Late Pleistocene, remains of Irish elk are uncommon, suggesting that they were usually rare in the areas where they did occur.

Historically, its extinction has been attributed to the encumbering size of the antlers, a &quot;maladaptation&quot; making fleeing through forests especially difficult for males while being chased by human hunters, or being too taxing nutritionally when the vegetation makeup shifted. In these scenarios, sexual selection by does for stags with large antlers would have contributed to decline.

However, antler size decreased through the Late Pleistocene and into the Holocene, and so may not have been the primary cause of extinction. A reduction in forest density in the Late Pleistocene and a lack of sufficient high-quality forage is associated with a decrease in body and antler size. Such resource constriction may have cut female fertility rates in half. Human hunting may have forced Irish elk into suboptimal feeding grounds.

The distribution of &quot;M. giganteus&quot; is thought to have been strongly controlled by climatic conditions. The range of the Irish elk appears to have collapsed during the Last Glacial Maximum (LGM), with few remains known between 27,500 and 14,600 years ago, and none between 23,300 and 17,500 years ago. Known remains substantially increase during the latest Pleistocene Bølling–Allerød Interstadial, where it appears to have re-colonized northern Europe, with abundant remains in the UK, Ireland, and Denmark, though its range contracted again during the following Younger Dryas, disappearing from northern Europe by the end of the period. A 2021 study found that &quot;M. giganteus&quot; saw a progressive decline in mitochondrial genome diversity beginning around 50,000 years ago, which accelerated during the LGM.

By the early Holocene, the range of the species had been dramatically reduced, with the youngest records in the eastern part of its range near Lake Baikal dating to around 10,700–10,400 years Before Present (BP), surviving latest in central part of its range within European Russia and Western Siberia. It is suggested that extinction was contributed to by further climatic changes transforming preferred open habitat into uninhabitable dense forest. The final demise may have been caused by several factors both on a continental and regional scale, including climate change and hunting. The youngest dates in this region from Kamyshlov in Western Siberia and Maloarkhangelsk, Oryol Oblast In European Russia date to around 7,700-7,600 years ago, and it is suggested that it likely became extinct shortly after this time. Lister and Stewart concluded in a study of the extinction of the Irish elk that &quot;it seems clear that environmental factors, cumulatively over thousands of years, reduced giant deer populations to a highly vulnerable state. In this situation, even relatively low-level hunting by small human populations could have contributed to its extinction.&quot;

== Modern significance ==

Due to the abundance of Irish elk remains in Ireland, a thriving trade in their bones existed there during the 19th century to supply museums and collectors. Skeletons and skulls with attached antlers were also prized ornaments in aristocratic homes. The remains of Irish elk were of high value: &quot;In 1865, full skeletons might fetch £30, while particularly good heads with antlers could cost £15.&quot; with £15 being more than 30 weeks&#x27; wages for a low skilled worker at the time. Indeed Leeds Philosophical and Literary Society bought a full skeleton in 1847, from Glennon&#x27;s in Dublin, for £38. This specimen, discovered at Lough Gur near Limerick, is still on display at Leeds City Museum.

<text>A software license is a legal instrument governing the use or redistribution of software. 

Since the 1970s, software copyright has been recognized in the United States. Despite the copyright being recognized, most companies prefer to sell licenses rather than copies of the software because it enables them to enforce stricter terms on redistribution. Very few purchasers read any part of the license, initially shrink-wrap contracts and now most commonly encountered as clickwrap or browsewrap. The enforceability of this kind of license is a matter of controversy and is limited in some jurisdictions. Service-level agreements are another type of software license where the vendor agrees to provide a level of service to the purchaser, often backed by financial penalties.

Copyleft is a type of free license that mandates derivative works to be licensed. The other types of free license lack this requirement: for permissive licenses, attribution is typically the only requirement, and public-domain-equivalent licenses have no restrictions. The proliferation of open-source licenses has compounded license compatibility issues, but all share some features: allowing redistribution and derivative works under the same license, unrestricted access to the source code, and nondiscrimination between different uses—in particular, allowing commercial use.


== Software copyright ==
The source code (or compiled binaries in the form of object code) of a computer program is protected by copyright law that vests the owner with the exclusive right to copy the code. The underlying ideas or algorithms are not protected by copyright law, but are often treated as a trade secret and concealed by such methods as non-disclosure agreements. Software copyright has been recognized since the mid-1970s and is vested in the company that makes the software, not the employees or contractors who wrote it. 

== Proprietary software licenses ==

The tendency to license proprietary software, rather than sell it, dates from the time period before the existence, then the scope of software copyright protection was clear. These licenses have continued in use after software copyright was recognized in the courts, and are considered to grant the company extra protection compared to copyright law. According to United States federal law, a company can restrict the parties to which it sells but it cannot prevent a buyer from reselling the product. Software licensing agreements usually prohibit resale, enabling the company to maximize revenue. 

Traditionally, software was distributed in the form of binary object code that could not be understood or modified by the user, but could be downloaded and run. The user bought a perpetual license to use a particular version of the software. Software as service (SaaS) vendors—who have the majority market share in application software —rarely offer perpetual licenses. SaaS licenses are usually temporary and charged on a pay-per-usage or subscription basis, although other revenue models such as freemium are also used. For customers, the advantages of temporary licenses include reduced upfront cost, increased flexibility, and lower overall cost compared to a perpetual license. In some cases, the steep one-time cost demanded by sellers of traditional software were out of the reach of smaller businesses, but pay-per-use SaaS models makes the software affordable.

===End-user license agreement (EULA)===
Initially, end-user license agreements (EULAs) were printed on either the shrinkwrap packaging encasing the product (see shrink-wrap contract) or a piece of paper. The license often stipulated that a customer agreed if they did not return the product within a specified interval. More recently, EULAs are most commonly found as clickwrap or browsewrap where the user&#x27;s clicks or continued browsing are taken as a sign of agreement. As a result of the end of physical constraints, length increased. Most EULAs have been designed so that it is very difficult to read and understand them, but easy to agree to the licensing terms without reading them. Regardless of how easy it is to access, very few consumers read any part of the license agreement. Most assume the terms are unobjectionable or barely notice agreeing while installing the software. Companies take advantage of consumers&#x27; inattention to insert provisions into EULAs. 

Proprietary software is usually offered under a restrictive license that bans copying and reuse and often limits the purchaser to using the software on one computer. Source code is rarely available. Derivative software works and reverse engineering are usually explicitly prohibited. Many EULAs allow the vendor to collect information about the user and use it in unrestricted ways. Some EULAs restrict the ability of users to exercise copyright over derivative work made using the software, such as creative creations in the virtual worlds of video games.

Most disclaim any liability for harms caused by the product, and prevent the purchaser from accessing the court system to seek a remedy. Furthermore, many EULAs allow the vendor to change the terms at any time and the customer must choose between agreeing or ceasing use of the product, without getting a refund. It is common for EULAs to allow unilateral termination by the vendor for any number of vague reasons or none at all.

EULAs, almost always offered on a take-it-or-leave-it basis as a non-negotiable condition for using the software, are very far from the prototypical contract where both parties fully understand the terms and agree of their own free will. There has been substantial debate on to what extent the agreements can be considered binding. Before 1996 in the United States, clickwrap or browsewrap licenses were not held to be binding, but since then they often have been. Under the New Digital Content Directive effective in the European Union, EULAs are only enforceable to the extent that they do not breach reasonable consumer expectations. The gap between expectations and the content of EULAs is especially wide when it comes to restrictions on copying and transferring ownership of digital content. Many EULAs contain stipulations that are likely unenforceable depending on the jurisdiction. Software vendors keep these unenforceable provisions in the agreements, perhaps because users rarely resort to the legal system to challenge them.

===Service-level agreement (SLA)===

Service-level agreements are often used for enterprise software and guarantee a level of service, such as software performance or time to respond to issue raised by the customer. Many stipulate financial penalties if the service falls short of the agreed standard. SLAs often cover such aspects as availability, reliability, price, and security using quantifiable metrics. Multi-tier SLAs are common in cloud computing because of the use of different computing services that may be managed by different companies. SLAs in cloud computing are an area under active research .

== Free and open-source software licenses ==
Before the open-source movement in the 1980s, almost all software was proprietary and did not disclose its source code. Open-source licensing is intended to maximize openness and minimize barriers to software use, dissemination, and follow-on innovation. 

Open-source licenses share a number of key characteristics:
*Free redistribution: Anyone can redistribute the software, for free or for cost, without the permission of or payment to the copyright holder.
* Unrestricted, public access to the source code—what the term &quot;open source&quot; refers to
* Users may modify the software and release derivative works, either under the same terms as the free software or, in some cases, under a different license.
*Nondiscrimination between different uses, including commercial use.
The Open Source Initiative vets and approves new open-source licenses that comply with its Open Source Definition. 

===Types of open-source licenses===
*If software is in the public domain, the owner&#x27;s copyright has been extinguished and anyone may use the work with no copyright restrictions.
*Non-restrictive licenses allow free reuse of the work without restrictions on the licensing of derivative works. Many of them require attribution of the original creators. The first open-source license was a non-restrictive license intended to facilitate scientific collaboration: the Berkeley Software Distribution (BSD), named after the University of California, Berkeley in 1978.
*Copyleft licenses (also known as &quot;share-alike&quot;), require source code to be distributed with software and require the source code be made available under a similar license. Copyleft represents the farthest that reuse can be restricted while still being considered free software. Strong copyleft licenses, such as the GNU General Public License (GPL), allow for no reuse in proprietary software, while weak copyleft, such as the related GNU Lesser General Public License (LGPL), do allow reuse in some circumstances. Copyleft licenses are perceived by developers as a way of ensuring that their contributions do not create unfair advantages for others. Another motivation for choosing copyleft is to promote open source through its requirements for derivative works: Stallman states that &quot;the central idea of copyleft is to use copyright law, but flip it over to serve the opposite of its usual purpose: instead of a means of privatizing software, [copyright] becomes a means of keeping software free.&quot; 

Outside of software, noncommercial-only Creative Commons licenses have become popular among some artists who wish to prevent others from profiting excessively from their work. However, software that is made available for noncommercial use only is not considered open source. Sun Microsystems&#x27; noncommercial-only Java Research License was rejected by the open-source community, and in 2006 the company released most of Java under the GPL.

===Compatibility===
Since 1989, a variety of open-source licenses for software have been created. Choosing an open-source software license has grown increasingly difficult due to the proliferation of licenses, many of which are only trivially distinct. Many licenses are incompatible with each other, hampering the goals of the free software movement. Translation issues, ambiguity in licensing terms, and incompatibility of some licenses with the law in certain jurisdictions compounds the problem. 

Although downloading an open-source module is quick and easy, complying with the licensing terms can be more difficult. The amount of software dependencies means that engineers working on complex projects must often rely on software license management software in order to help them achieve compliance with the licensing terms of open-source components. Many open-source software files do not unambiguously state the license, increasing the difficulties of compliance. When combining code bases, the original licenses can be maintained for separate components, and the larger work released under a compatible license. This compatibility is often one-way. Public domain content can be used anywhere as there is no copyright claim, but code acquired under any almost any set of terms cannot be waved to the public domain. Permissive licenses can be used within copyleft works, but copyleft material cannot be released under a permissive license. Some weak copyleft licenses can be used under the GPL and are said to be GPL-compatible. GPL software can only be used under the GPL or AGPL.

===Enforceability===

Free and open-source software licenses have been successfully enforced in civil court since the mid-2000s. Courts have found that distributing software indicates acceptance of the license&#x27;s terms. However, developers typically achieve compliance without lawsuits. Social pressures, such as the potential for community backlash, are often sufficient. Cease and desist letters are a common method to bring companies back into compliance, especially in Germany.

A long-debated subject within the FOSS community is whether open-source licenses are &quot;bare licenses&quot; or contracts. A bare license is a set of conditions under which actions otherwise restricted by intellectual property laws are permitted. Under the bare license interpretation, advocated by the Free Software Foundation (FSF), a case is brought to court by the copyright holder as copyright infringement. Under the contract interpretation, a case can be brought to court by an involved party as a breach of contract. United States and French courts have tried cases under both interpretations.

===Value===
More than 90 percent of companies use open-source software as a component of their proprietary software. The decision to use open-source software, or even engage with open-source projects to improve existing open-source software, is typically a pragmatic business decision. When proprietary software is in direct competition with an open-source alternative, research has found conflicting results on the effect of the competition on the proprietary product&#x27;s price and quality.

For decades, some companies have made servicing of an open-source software product for enterprise users as their business model. These companies control an open-source software product, and instead of charging for licensing or use, charge for improvements, integration, and other servicing. Software as a service (SaaS) products based on open-source components are increasingly common. 

Open-source software is preferred for scientific applications, because it increases transparency and aids in the validation and acceptance of scientific results.

<doc id="803813" wikidata="Q2245295" url="?curid=803813" title="In the Bleak Midwinter (film)">
<text>In the Bleak Midwinter (released in the US as A Midwinter&#x27;s Tale) is a 1995 British romantic comedy film written and directed by Kenneth Branagh. Many of the roles in the film were written for specific actors. This was the first film directed by Branagh in which he did not appear.

The film begins with a monologue by out-of-work actor Joe Harper (Michael Maloney) about his slow decline into depression. In an attempt to beat his depression, Joe volunteers to help try to save his sister&#x27;s local church from land developers for the community by putting on a Christmas production of &quot;Hamlet&quot;, somewhat against the advice of his agent Margaretta (Joan Collins). As the cast he assembles are still available even at Christmas and are prepared to do it on a &#x27;profit sharing&#x27; basis (that is, they may not get paid anything), he cannot expect – and does not get – the cream of the cream. But although they all bring their own problems and foibles along, something bigger starts to emerge in the perhaps aptly named village of Hope. This film encapsulates the hilarious and heartbreaking struggle of actor versus situation versus life, and often versus each other. It was shot in black and white.

== Plot ==
Joe Harper, a depressed and down-on-his-luck actor, asks his agent Margaretta D&#x27;Arcy to lend him money to put on a Christmastime production of Shakespeare&#x27;s Hamlet in his hometown of Hope, Derbyshire. Wanting the rendition to be &quot;free and experimental&quot;, Joe holds auditions that attract a variety of performers, most of whom Margaretta thinks are mad. In the end, Joe casts six actors: the well-meaning Nina Raymond; the long-suffering and cynical Henry Wakefield; the flamboyant homosexual Terry DuBois; the vain Tom Newman; alcoholic-in-denial Carnforth Greville; and former child actor Vernon Spatch. Joe casts himself as Hamlet.

Recruiting his sister Molly, Joe transports the actors and props their venue: a decrepit church that is due for demolition by developers. Despite being disheartened that the venue is also their digs, as well as not having expenses paid for them, the actors decide to stay. There, they meet their costume and set designer, the new-age Fadge, who proposes to have some of the audience as cardboard figurines and use only smoke for set design.

Rehearsals begin with a shaky start. Carnforth cannot remember his lines and often turns up drunk, Tom insists on using outrageous accents for each of his roles, Henry hates sharing a room with Terry, Nina&#x27;s bad eyesight causes accidents, and Molly is forced to play Hamlet during rehearsals so Joe can direct. Later, the landlord of the church demands an extra week of rent, which Joe does not have, and the show does not sell a single advance ticket. Four days before the tech run, Joe insists the actors do not lose their nerve, and receives encouragement from Nina, who he learns is a widow.

Vernon comes to Joe&#x27;s rescue by giving out flyers and selling tickets on the streets and at a hotel he is performing a cabaret at. Henry and Terry gradually learn to tolerate each other through their mutual respect of Henry Irving. Terry reveals he has an estranged son, Tim. This makes his role as Gertrude difficult as Joe encourages the actors to be the characters. One night, Tom breaks down from Carnforth&#x27;s mistakes, Joe&#x27;s direction and Vernon&#x27;s insistence in documenting the production. This makes Joe suffer his own breakdown, saying that the production was a mistake, that it has become too personal for them all, that their time has run out and that he has no money to pay for them nor securing the venue for the run of the show. Calming down, Henry and Molly reassure him to continue.

With Joe now acting during the rehearsals, the production improves significantly. Vernon reveals to Joe the company has had a whip-round to improve the financial situation. After the technical rehearsal, Joe receives a call from Margaretta, who tells him that he has been offered a three-picture movie deal from American producer Nancy Crawford, but he has to cut off before she tells him about travel arrangements. On Christmas Eve, the night of the first performance, Margaretta arrives early to tell Joe that he has to leave to catch a flight to Los Angeles with Crawford - meaning he will be absent from the first performance. The company begrudgingly say their farewells to Joe, with Molly filling for Hamlet and Nina tearfully begging for Joe to stay for his well-being, to no avail.

The audience arrives, including Carnforth&#x27;s mother, Nina&#x27;s father and Tim (who Henry contacted, telling him that Terry has cholera). Crawford and Margaretta also arrive along with a national newspaper reporter. During Molly&#x27;s first scene, Joe returns, having been allowed to do the first performance and let Crawford see him act live. The production goes well, and the company meet backstage, where Crawford reveals that she only watched the performance to see why Joe rejected her offer. Instead, she offers Joe&#x27;s role to Tom, who has Fadge brought along as a designer for the film, and Margaretta offers herself as an agent to them.

When the audience leaves, the company starts dancing, and Nina and Joe begin a relationship as Christmas Day begins.

== Reception ==

=== Critical response ===

Roger Ebert, noted critic of the &quot;Chicago Sun-Times&quot;, gave the film three out of four stars, praising the performances and Branagh&#x27;s screenplay. James Berardinelli praised the film, giving it three-and-a-half out of four stars, stating, &quot;No current film maker appears to love and understand Shakespeare as well as Branagh, and never has his affection for the Bard been more apparent than here. This picture succeeds as a comedy, a satire, and even, to a certain extent, as a mild melodrama about choosing between a paycheck and the nourishment of the soul.&quot; Berardinelli concluded, &quot;Anyone who wondered about Branagh&#x27;s future following &quot;Frankenstein&quot; can set their concerns to rest. He&#x27;s back on top in the independent arena with &quot;A Midwinter&#x27;s Tale&quot;, a film that offers ninety-eight minutes of pure fun re-interpreting the phrase &#x27;the play&#x27;s the thing&#x27;.&quot;

===Box office===
In the UK, it grossed £235,302 in its first month of release. In the United States and Canada it grossed $469,571.

=== Accolades ===
As a competitive entry at the 52nd Venice International Film Festival in 1995, &quot;In the Bleak Midwinter&quot; was among the finalists for the Golden Lion award, and Kenneth Branagh received the Golden Osella for Best Director.

<doc id="803814" wikidata="Q5638005" url="?curid=803814" title="Hadlow Castle">
<text>Hadlow Castle was an 18th-century country house in Hadlow, Kent, England, built in the fashionable Strawberry Hill &#x27;Gothic&#x27; style. The house was gradually enlarged and extended during the 19th century and finally demolished in the 20th, apart from a prospect tower and ancillary buildings. The surviving Grade I Listed Hadlow Tower, locally known as May&#x27;s Folly, was restored in 2013.

==History==

Hadlow Castle replaced the manor house of Hadlow Court Lodge. It was built over a number of years from the late 1780s, commissioned by Walter May in an ornate Gothic style. The architect was J. Dugdale. His son, Walter Barton May inherited the estate in 1823, and another inheritance in 1832 from his wife&#x27;s family. He added a octagonal tower in 1838, the architect was George Ledwell Taylor. A octagonal lantern was added in 1840 and another smaller tower was added in 1852. This was dismantled in 1905. Walter Barton May died in 1858 and the estate was sold. Subsequent owners were Robert Rodger, JP, High Sheriff of Kent, in 1865. He died in 1882 and the castle was bought by Dr. MacGeagh, a Harley Street specialist in 1891. He would drive in his carriage to Tonbridge and catch the train to London thus being an early commuter. The castle passed to T E Foster MacGeagh and he sold it in 1919 to Henry Thomas Pearson, whose family occupied it until 1946. During the Second World War it was used as a watchtower by the Home Guard and Royal Observer Corps. The unoccupied castle changed hands several times after the Pearsons left, and was demolished in 1951, except for the servants&#x27; quarters, several stables and the Coach House, which was saved by the painter Bernard Hailstone. The Tower was already a Listed Building, having been listed on 17 April 1951. Now the entrance gateway and lodges of the Castle still stand - a heavy Gothic presence on the street - as does the Stable Court with two turreted pavilions, which are all in private ownerships, and new homes have been built in the grounds.

==Tower==
Hadlow Tower, known locally as May&#x27;s Folly, is a Victorian Gothic tower, and one of the largest in Britain at . The top is an octagonal lantern.

The Grade I listed tower was badly damaged in the Great Storm of 1987, and the lantern was removed in 1996. The tower&#x27;s condition then worsened rapidly. The cost of repairs was estimated at £4 million. In July 2006, Tonbridge and Malling borough council announced that it would issue a compulsory purchase order (CPO) on the tower in an effort to save it. This CPO was confirmed in March 2008 by the Secretary of State for Culture, Media and Sport, with plans for the council to take possession of the Tower and transfer it to the Vivat Trust in late 2009, so that the necessary repair and restoration work can be undertaken; plans included short-term holiday accommodation, with a separate exhibition centre on part of the ground floor.

In January 2011, it was announced that the tower had been compulsorily purchased by Tonbridge and Malling District Council; the council sold it to the Vivat Trust for £1. Restoration of the tower, including the replacement of the lantern commenced in February 2011, with completion then scheduled for September 2012. The project was funded by grants from English Heritage and the Heritage Lottery Fund. The latter granted £2,000,000 of the estimated £4,000,000 restoration cost. After restoration, the tower offered holiday accommodation, with public exhibition space on the ground floor. On 24 February 2011, Hadlow Castle was transferred to the Vivat Trust.

The restoration was completed in February 2013, making it the tallest folly in the United Kingdom. In October 2013, the restoration of the tower was recognised when the Vivat Trust and the Save Hadlow Tower Action Group (SHTAG) won a Lloyd-Webber Angel Award. Work was completed on the interior; the exhibition centre in the tower was open on Thursdays from May to October. Visits are organised by SHTAG. In September 2014, it was shortlisted for the 2014 Kent Design Awards. Following the collapse of Vivat Trust, the tower was offered for sale in May 2016. In 2017 the tower was sold to a private individual for £425,000. The tower was re-listed for sale in 2020 with Sotheby&#x27;s International Realty for £1,475,000.

<doc id="803820" wikidata="Q512143" url="?curid=803820" title="Stephen P. Hempstead">
<text>Stephen P. Hempstead (October 1, 1812February 16, 1883) was the second Governor of Iowa. A Democrat, he served from 1850 to 1854.

==Life==
Hempstead was born on October 1, 1812, in New London, Connecticut. He is the eighth son of Joseph and Celinda Hempstead. At the age of thirteen, Stephen Hempstead&#x27;s family moved to St. Louis and settled a farm. After discovering his dislike of farm life, Hempstead left the farm in 1830 to work in a store in Illinois. Soon after, Stephen was enlisted in the Black Hawk War, where he served in the artillery company until the conflict was resolved.

After the war, Hempstead studied law in Jacksonville. In 1836, he was admitted to the bar, and soon became the first practicing lawyer in Dubuque. In 1837, Hempstead married a woman from Baltimore named Lavinia Moore Lackland, and together they had three sons and three daughters.

==Political life==
Hempstead moved to the Iowa territory, and was active in politics in the years leading up to Iowa&#x27;s gaining statehood. Hempstead represented the northern parts of Iowa in the Territorial Legislature at Burlington, Iowa. Hempstead represented Dubuque County in the Iowa constitutional convention in 1846. Hempstead was subsequently elected as governor in 1850. In 1851, he helped write the laws which would form the basis of the Iowa code. Hempstead was elected to the Legislative Council of the First Legislative Assembly of Territorial Iowa. During this first assembly, Hempstead suggested that Iowa&#x27;s government be located in Johnson County, where Iowa City currently is. In the second assembly, Hempstead is elected to lead the Legislative council as president. He continued to head the Legislative Council until 1848, where Hempstead was elected as one of the three commissioners in charge of revising Iowa&#x27;s laws. These revisions were accepted into Iowa&#x27;s law in 1851.

In 1850, Hempstead ran for governor under the democratic ticket with a strong emphasis on bringing African-American slaves to the Dubuque area. He ran against Whig candidate James L. Thompson, and Hempstead ended up winning the election. Hempstead served as governor from 1850 through 1854. Under Hempstead, Iowa&#x27;s population 
considerably increased after Hempstead strongly encouraged incomers to live in Iowa. Fifty two new counties were also formed while Hempstead was in office, and the state of Iowa practiced financial conservation. Hempstead also strongly opposed banks, which was reflected in his actions while in office. The Iowa Constitution of 1846 prohibited banking in Iowa, and twice Hempstead vetoed any attempt to appeal this law. Temperance was also a large issue under Hempstead. Many prohibition supporters petitioned in favor of prohibition in Iowa, but Hempstead simply took no action, and left this issue up to local authorities.

==Post-gubernatorial career==
When Hempstead&#x27;s term as governor ended on December 9, 1854, he attempted to run for the United States congress, but lost due to his opinion over prohibition. Later, Hempstead was repeatedly elected starting in 1855 and served as Dubuque&#x27;s county judge until 1867. Hempstead also served as an auditor in Dubuque from the year 1869 until 1873, and also was honored as justice of the peace in 1882 until his death in 1883.

The creation of Dubuque&#x27;s city hall was led by Hempstead while he was in office. Hempstead hired the architect John F. Rague to design the city hall. Rague modeled Dubuque&#x27;s city hall after New York&#x27;s Fulton Street Market building and Boston&#x27;s Faneuil Hall. The first floor of the building was intended to be used as a market for the local farmers to sell their goods. The second floor contained the main city court room, offices, and council chamber. The town hall was located on the third floor, where the public could gather to host events. This building still stands today.

In the 1960&#x27;s, a public high school was named after him in Dubuque, Stephen Hempstead High School.

<text>The KHR-1 is a programmable, bipedal humanoid robot introduced in June 2004 by a Japanese company Kondo Kagaku. At the time of its introduction it was one of the least expensive programmable bipedal robots (prices averaging around $1,600 in the United States and ¥128,000 in Japan). The robot is 34 cm high and has 17 degrees of freedom (each joint is powered by individual servomotor). It is capable of a wide range of motions, including quick kung-fu-style fighting moves.

The KHR-1 can be controlled via RF remote control and modified receiver; however, these units do not come with the robot and must be purchased separately. Other accessories/modifications include additional degrees of freedom (waist and leg motion), a high performance motion processor microcontroller capable of real-time master/slave operation, gyros and multi-axis accelerometers, larger foot/sole plates.

The basic robot, as supplied by Kondo, uses simple control application, named HearttoHeart that allows the user to create or capture a sequence of poses and control the transition speeds. The software also has provisions for creating a series of motions into a longer scenario.

Users of the KHR-1 have developed a number of more advanced control, programming and simulation applications making it possible to create and modify the robot&#x27;s movements and scenarios on a personal computer.

The KHR-1 is the most commonly used robotic platform used for ROBO-ONE J class robots in Japan. In 2004 the robot won in the Robo-One Jr category (lightweight robots) in the RoboGames (held in the United States).

The KHR series also includes the KHR-2HV and KHR-3HV robots.

<text>Megaloceros (from Greek: + , literally &quot;Great Horn&quot;; see also Lister (1987)) is an extinct genus of deer whose members lived throughout Eurasia from the Pleistocene to the early Holocene. The type and only undisputed member of the genus, &quot;Megaloceros giganteus&quot;, vernacularly known as the &quot;Irish elk&quot; or &quot;giant deer&quot;, is also the best known. Fallow deer are thought to be their closest living relatives. &quot;Megaloceros&quot; has been suggested to be closely related to other genera of &quot;giant deer&quot;, like the East Asian genus &quot;Sinomegaceros,&quot; and the European &quot;Praemegaceros&quot;.

== Nomenclatural history ==
&quot;Megaloceros giganteus&quot; was originally described in 1799 as &quot;Alce gigantea&quot; by Johann Friedrich Blumenbach based on specimens found in Ireland. With &quot;Alce&quot; being a variant of the genus &quot;Alces&quot; used for elk/moose.&quot;&quot;

In 1827 Joshua Brookes, in a listing of his zoological collection, named the &quot;Megaloceros&quot; (spelled &quot;Megalocerus&quot; in the earlier editions) in the following passage:The etymology being from Greek: &quot;great&quot; + &quot;horn, antler&quot;. The type and only species named in the description being &quot;Megaloceros antiquorum&quot;, based on Irish remains now considered to belong to &quot;M. giganteus&quot;, making the former a junior synonym. The original description was considered by Adrian Lister in 1987 to be inadequate for a taxonomic definition. In 1828 Brookes published an expanded list in the form of a catalogue for an upcoming auction, which included the Latin phrase &quot;Cornibus deciduis palmatis&quot; (&quot;palmate deciduous horns&quot;) as a description of the remains. The 1828 publication was approved by International Commission on Zoological Nomenclature (ICZN) in 1977 as an available publication for the basis of zoological nomenclature. Adrian Lister in 1987 judged that &quot;the phase &quot;Cornibus deciduis palmatis&quot; constitutes a definition sufficient under the [International Code of Zoological Nomenclature] (article 12) to validate &quot;Megalocerus&quot;.&quot; The original spelling of &quot;Megalocerus&quot; was never used after its original publication.

In 1844 Richard Owen named another synonym of the Irish elk, including it within the newly named subgenus &quot;Megaceros&quot;, &quot;Cervus&quot; (&quot;Megaceros&quot;) &quot;hibernicus&quot;. This has been suggested to be derived from another junior synonym of the Irish elk described by J. Hart in 1825, &quot;Cervus megaceros&quot;. Despite being a junior synonym, &quot;Megaloceros&quot; remained in obscurity and &quot;Megaceros&quot; became the common genus name for the taxon. The combination &quot;Megaceros giganteus&quot; was in use by 1871. George Gaylord Simpson in 1945 revived the original &quot;Megaloceros&quot; name, which became progressively more widely used, until a taxonomic decision in 1989 by the ICZN confirmed the priority of &quot;Megaloceros&quot; over &quot;Megaceros&quot;, and &quot;Megaloceros&quot; to be the correct spelling.

== Taxonomic composition ==
Other than the type species &quot;Megaloceros giganteus&quot;, the composition of the genus is contested.&quot;&quot; While considered to be part of the genus &quot;Megaloceros&quot; by many authors, &quot;M. savini&quot; and related taxa (&quot;novocarthaginiensis&quot; and &quot;matritensis)&quot; are split into the separate genus &quot;Praedama&quot; by some scholars.&quot;&quot;

The genus &quot;Megaloceros&quot; is widely agreed to belong the subfamily Cervinae. &quot;Megaloceros&quot; has often been placed in the tribe Megacerini, alongside other &quot;giant deer&quot; genera like &quot;Sinomegaceros&quot; and &quot;Praemegaceros,&quot; though the taxonomy regarding giant deer as whole is uncertain and contested.&quot;&quot; A close relationship with &quot;Sinomegaceros&quot; has been supported by mitochondrial DNA, which found that the mitochondrial sequences of &quot;M. giganteus&quot; are nested within those of &quot;Sinomegaceros&quot;, suggesting that the two lineages interbred with each other after the initial split between them, with all mitochondrial genomes of &quot;Sinomegaceros&quot; more closely related to those of &quot;M. giganteus&quot; than to their closest living relative &quot;Dama&quot;.

=== Species ===
Species ordered from oldest to youngest:
;&quot;M. novocarthaginiensis&quot;
: Described from the latest Early Pleistocene 0.9-0.8 Ma of Cueva Victoria in Spain. Known from antlers, teeth and postcranial material. Related and possibly ancestral to &quot;M. savini&quot;
;&quot;M. savini&quot;
:Middle Pleistocene European species&quot;&quot;, with a temporal range spanning approximately 750-450,000 years ago, slightly larger than a caribou/reindeer, first fossils found near Sainte Savine, France and near Soria, Spain. Its antlers were straight, with thornlike prongs. The lowermost prongs near the base were palmate. Has been suggested to comprise the separate genus &quot;Praedama.&quot;
:It is suggested to have been a mixed feeder or grazer.
;&quot;M. matritensis&quot;
:Mid-Pleistocene species, lived around 400-300,000 years ago near present-day Madrid, Spain, being contemporary with &quot;M. giganteus&quot;. The species had enlarged premolars, very thick molar enamel, and a low mandibular condyle. The species itself formed part of the diet of people which lived in the area. &quot;M. matritensis&quot; fossils are found associated to stone tools of late Acheulean and early Mousterian type. The species is thought to be descended from &quot;M. savini&quot;
;&quot;M. giganteus&quot;
:Largest, best known, and among the last species of the genus that stands about at the shoulders. Lived throughout Eurasia, from Ireland to Siberia during the late Middle Pleistocene to early Holocene.
&quot;Megaceroides algericus&quot; from the Late Pleistocene to Holocene of North Africa has been considered to be closely related and possibly derived from &quot;Megaloceros&quot; by some authors.

&quot;&quot;M&quot;. stravpolensis&quot; from the Early Pleistocene of Southwestern Russia has been subsequently suggested to belong to &quot;Arvernoceros&quot;. The species &quot;&quot;Megaloceros&quot; cretensis&quot; from the island of Crete has been moved to the genus &quot;Candiacervus&quot;.

<text>Bernard Hailstone (6 October 1910 – 27 December 1987) was an English painter, best known for his Second World War portraits of transport and civil defence workers painted in Britain, his portraits of members of the Armed Forces painted overseas and his post-war portraits of the royal family, musicians, stage and film actors.

==Early life==

After education at the Judd School, Tonbridge, Hailstone attended Goldsmiths&#x27; College of Art, under James Bateman, then the Royal Academy Schools, under Walter Westley Russell.

His elder brother, Harold (1897–1982), was an established magazine illustrator and cartoonist.

==World War II==

Hailstone belongs to the group of early 20th-century artists whose best-known work was done during the Second World War. At the beginning of the Second World War, Hailstone felt the need to incorporate his artistic contribution to the war effort with more physical work. He therefore joined the Auxiliary Fire Service, AFS, and witnessed at first hand the destruction caused by bombing during the Blitz. He recorded some of these scenes in his paintings. A number of other artists had joined the AFS and a firemen artists&#x27; committee had been formed which also included Leonard Rosoman, Paul Lucien Dessau, Norman Hepple and Robert Coram alongside Hailstone. The group contributed to both War Artists&#x27; Advisory Committee, WAAC, and specialist civil defence art shows, including several firemen artists&#x27; exhibitions. In 1941 WAAC, commissioned Hailstone to paint civil defence subjects. He supplemented these works with portraits of his colleagues in the fire services and other war workers. His portrait of W. M. Ladbrooke, Able Seaman, Merchant Navy (National Maritime Museum, London), was painted following a visit to the Merchant Navy convalescent home in Limpsfield, Surrey around 1943.
Following his release from the fire services, Hailstone spent time painting portraits of transport and civil defence workers. In 1943 WAAC assigned him to the Ministry of War Transport and he moved to Kingston upon Hull, working mainly around the docks there, where he continued to record the effects of the war from a civilian perspective. One such work is his &quot;Big Ben the Bargee&quot;, showing a bargeman and his wife and completed in June 1943 (National Maritime Museum, London). Throughout the rest of the war Hailstone travelled through Algiers, Malta and southern Italy, recording the activities of the Merchant Navy in a similar, sympathetic vein. In June 1945, Hailstone was transferred to the Ministry of Information to record the work of the South East Asia Command during the Burma Campaign. The paintings he produced of Lord Louis Mountbatten and key members of his staff are now in the Imperial War Museum, London.

==Later life==
After the war Hailstone had a very successful career as a portrait painter. A gregarious, outgoing man, Hailstone went on to paint the last officially commissioned portrait of Sir Winston Churchill in 1955 and members of the royal family, including the 1968 portrait of HM Queen Elizabeth II as Colonel-in-Chief of the 16th/5th Queens’s Royal Lancers, but he as happily painted ordinary members of the public. His work included portraits of Laurence Olivier, Peter Ustinov, Sir John Barbirolli and Paul Mellon. The Mellon portrait led to several commissions in America which provided the funds to save the tower and some ancillary buildings of Hadlow Castle, where Hailstone had lived from 1951, from demolition.

A portrait of South African industrialist Harry Oppenheimer by Hailstone was burned by demonstrators during the Rhodes Must Fall upheaval at the University of Cape Town in February 2016.

<text>Listeria is a genus of bacteria that acts as an intracellular parasite in mammals. As of 2024, 28 species have been identified. The genus is named in honour of the British pioneer of sterile surgery Joseph Lister. &quot;Listeria&quot; species are Gram-positive, rod-shaped, and facultatively anaerobic, and do not produce endospores.

The major human pathogen in the genus is &quot;L. monocytogenes&quot;. Although &quot;L. monocytogenes&quot; has low infectivity, it is hardy and can grow in a refrigerator temperature of 4 °C (39.2 °F) up to the human body temperature of 37 °C (98.6 °F). It is the usual cause of the relatively rare bacterial disease listeriosis, an infection caused by eating food contaminated with the bacteria. The overt form of the disease has a case-fatality rate of around 20–30%. Listeriosis can cause serious illness in pregnant women, newborns, adults with weakened immune systems and the elderly, and may cause gastroenteritis in others who have been severely infected. The incubation period can vary from three to 70 days. The two main clinical manifestations are sepsis and meningitis, often complicated by encephalitis, a pathology unusual for bacterial infections.

&quot;L. ivanovii&quot; is a pathogen of mammals, specifically ruminants, and rarely causes listeriosis in humans.

==Bacteria characteristics==
In the late 1920s, two groups of researchers independently identified &quot;L. monocytogenes&quot; from animal outbreaks, naming it &quot;Bacterium monocytogenes&quot;. They proposed the genus &quot;Listerella&quot; in honour of surgeon and early antiseptic advocate Joseph Lister, but that name was already in use for a slime mould and a protozoan. Eventually, the genus &quot;Listeria&quot; was proposed and accepted. The genus &quot;Listeria&quot; was classified in the family Corynebacteriaceae through the seventh edition (1957) of &quot;Bergey&#x27;s Manual of Systematic Bacteriology&quot;. 16S rRNA cataloging studies demonstrated that &quot;L. monocytogenes&quot; is a distinct taxon within the &quot;Lactobacillus-Bacillus&quot; branch of the bacterial phylogeny constructed by Woese. In 2004 the genus was placed in the newly created family Listeriaceae, of which the only other genus in the family is &quot;Brochothrix&quot;. The first documented human case of listeriosis was in 1929, described by the Danish physician Aage Nyfeldt.

The genus &quot;Listeria&quot; is known to contain 28 species, classified into two groups: &quot;sensu stricto&quot; and &quot;sensu lato&quot;. &quot;Listeria sensu strictu&quot; contains &quot;L. monocytogenes&quot; alongside nine other closely related species: &quot;L. cossartiae&quot;, &quot;L. farberi&quot;, &quot;L. immobilis&quot;, &quot;L. innocua&quot;, &quot;L. ivanovii&quot;, &quot;L. marthii&quot;, &quot;L. seeligeri&quot;, &quot;L. swaminathanii&quot; and &quot;L. welshimeri&quot;. &quot;Listeria sensu lato&quot; contains the remaining 18 species: &quot;L. aquatica&quot;, &quot;L. booriae&quot;, &quot;L. cornellensis&quot;, &quot;L. costaricensis&quot;, &quot;L. fleischmannii&quot;, &quot;L. floridensis&quot;, &quot;L. goaensis&quot;, &quot;L. grandensis&quot;, &quot;L. grayi&quot;, &quot;L. ilorinensis&quot;, &quot;L. newyorkensis&quot;, &quot;L. portnoyi&quot;, &quot;L. riparia&quot;, &quot;L. rocourtiae&quot;, &quot;L. rustica&quot;, &quot;L. thailandensis&quot;, &quot;L. valentina&quot; and &quot;L. weihenstephanensis&quot;. &quot;Listeria dinitrificans&quot;, previously thought to be part of the genus &quot;Listeria&quot;, was reclassified into the new genus &quot;Jonesia&quot;.

All species within the genus &quot;Listeria&quot; are gram-positive, catalase-positive rods and do not produce endospores. Under the microscope, &quot;Listeria&quot; species appear as small rods, sometimes arranged in short chains. In direct smears, they may be coccoid, and can be mistaken for streptococci. Longer cells may resemble corynebacteria. Flagella are produced at room temperature, but not at 37 °C. Hemolytic activity on blood agar has been used as a marker to distinguish &quot;L. monocytogenes&quot; from other &quot;Listeria&quot; species, but it is not a definitive criterion. Further biochemical characterization may be necessary to distinguish between the different species of &quot;Listeria&quot;.

&quot;Listeria monocytogenes&quot; is commonly found in soil, stream water, sewage, plants, and food&quot;. Listeria&quot; in soil can contaminate vegetables, and animals can be carriers. It has been found in uncooked meats, uncooked vegetables, fruits including cantaloupe and apples, pasteurized or unpasteurized milk and milk products, and processed foods. Pasteurization and sufficient cooking kill &quot;Listeria&quot;; however, contamination may occur after cooking and before packaging. For example, meat-processing plants producing ready-to-eat foods, such as hot dogs and deli meats, must follow extensive sanitation policies and procedures to prevent &quot;Listeria&quot; contamination.

==Pathogenesis==
&quot;Listeria&quot; is responsible for listeriosis, a rare but potentially lethal foodborne illness. The case fatality rate for those with a severe form of infection may approach 25%. (&quot;Salmonellosis&quot;, in comparison, has a mortality rate estimated at less than 1%.) Although &quot;L. monocytogenes&quot; has low infectivity, it is hardy and can grow in temperatures from a refrigerator temperature of 4 °C (39.2 °F) up to the human body temperature of 37 °C (98.6 °F). Listeriosis may manifest as meningitis, and can affect newborns due to its ability to penetrate the endothelial layer of the placenta.
&quot;Listeria&quot; uses the cellular machinery to move around inside the host cell. It induces directed polymerization of actin by the ActA transmembrane protein, thus pushing the bacterial cell around.

&quot;Listeria monocytogenes&quot;, for example, encodes virulence genes that are thermoregulated. The expression of virulence factor is optimal at 39 °C, and is controlled by a transcriptional activator, PrfA, whose expression is thermoregulated by the PrfA thermoregulator UTR element. At low temperatures, the PrfA transcript is not translated due to structural elements near the ribosome binding site. As the bacteria infect the host, the temperature of the host denatures the structure and allows translation initiation for the virulence genes.

The majority of &quot;Listeria&quot; bacteria are attacked by the immune system before they are able to cause infection. Those that escape the immune system&#x27;s initial response, however, spread through intracellular mechanisms, which protects them from circulating immune factors (AMI).

To invade, &quot;Listeria&quot; induces macrophage phagocytic uptake by displaying D-galactose in their teichoic acids that are then bound by the macrophage&#x27;s polysaccharides. Other important adhesins are the internalins. &quot;Listeria&quot; uses internalin A and B to bind to cellular receptors. Internalin A binds to E-cadherin, while internalin B binds to the cell&#x27;s Met receptors. If both of these receptors have a high enough affinity to &quot;Listeria&quot;″s internalin A and B, then it will be able to invade the cell via an indirect zipper mechanism. Once phagocytosed, the bacterium is encapsulated by the host cell&#x27;s acidic phagolysosome organelle. &quot;Listeria&quot;, however, escapes the phagolysosome by lysing the vacuole&#x27;s entire membrane with secreted hemolysin, now characterized as the exotoxin listeriolysin O. The bacteria then replicate inside the host cell&#x27;s cytoplasm.

&quot;Listeria&quot; must then navigate to the cell&#x27;s periphery to spread the infection to other cells. Outside the body, &quot;Listeria&quot; has flagellar-driven motility, sometimes described as a &quot;tumbling motility&quot;. However, at 37 °C, flagella cease to develop and the bacterium instead usurps the host cell&#x27;s cytoskeleton to move. Inventively, &quot;Listeria&quot; polymerizes an actin tail or &quot;comet&quot;, from actin monomers in the host&#x27;s cytoplasm with the promotion of virulence factor ActA. The comet forms in a polar manner and aids the bacterial migration to the host cell&#x27;s outer membrane. Gelsolin, an actin filament severing protein, localizes at the tail of &quot;Listeria&quot; and accelerates the bacterium&#x27;s motility. Once at the cell surface, the actin-propelled &quot;Listeria&quot; pushes against the cell&#x27;s membrane to form protrusions called filopods or &quot;rockets&quot;. The protrusions are guided by the cell&#x27;s leading edge to contact adjacent cells, which then engulf the &quot;Listeria&quot; rocket and the process is repeated, perpetuating the infection. Once phagocytosed, the bacterium is never again extracellular: it is an intracellular parasite like &quot;S. flexneri,&quot; &quot;Rickettsia&quot; spp., and &quot;C. trachomatis&quot;.

==Epidemiology==
Some of the foods most commonly implicated in &quot;Listeria&quot; contaminations include ready-to-eat salads and seafood, deli meats, soft and semi-soft cheese, and frozen vegetables.

Cold-cut meats were implicated in an outbreak in Canada in 2008 and a widespread one the US in 2024. Improperly handled cantaloupe was implicated in both the outbreak of listeriosis from Jensen Farms in Colorado in 2011, and a similar listeriosis outbreak across eastern Australia in early 2018. 35 people died across these two outbreaks. The Australian company GMI Food Wholesalers was fined A$236,000 for providing &quot;L. monocytogenes&quot;-contaminated chicken wraps to the airline Virgin Blue in 2011. Caramel apples have also been cited as a source of listerial infections which hospitalized 26 people, of whom five died. 

In 2019, the United Kingdom experienced nine cases of the disease, of which six were fatal, in an outbreak caused by contaminated meat (produced by North Country Cooked Meats) in hospital sandwiches. In 2019, two people in Australia died after probably eating smoked salmon and a third fell ill but survived the disease. In September 2019, three deaths and a miscarriage were reported in the Netherlands after the consumption of listeria-infected deli meats produced by Offerman.

==Prevention==
Preventing listeriosis as a foodborne illness requires effective sanitation of food contact surfaces. Ethanol is an effective topical sanitizer against &quot;Listeria&quot;. Quaternary ammonium can be used in conjunction with alcohol as a food-contact safe sanitizer with increased duration of the sanitizing action.

Keeping foods in the home refrigerated below discourages bacterial growth. Unpasteurized dairy products may pose a risk. Heating of meats (including beef, pork, poultry, and seafood) to a sufficient internal temperature, typically , will kill the food-borne pathogen.

==Treatment==
&quot;Non-invasive listeriosis&quot;: bacteria are retained within the digestive tract. Symptoms are mild, lasting only a few days and requiring only supportive care. Muscle pain and fever can be treated with over-the-counter pain relievers; diarrhea and gastroenteritis can be treated with over-the-counter medications.

&quot;Invasive listeriosis&quot;: bacteria have spread to the bloodstream and central nervous system. Treatment includes intravenous delivery of high-dose antibiotics and hospital in-patient care of (probably) not less than two weeks stay, depending on the extent of the infection. Ampicillin, penicillin, or amoxicillin are typically administered for invasive listeriosis; gentamicin may be added in cases of patients with compromised immune systems. In cases of allergy to penicillin, trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole, vancomycin, and fluoroquinolones may be used. For effective treatment the antibiotic must penetrate the host cell and bind to penicillin-binding protein 3 (PBP3). Cephalosporins are not effective for treating listeriosis.

In cases of pregnancy, prompt treatment is critical to prevent bacteria from infecting the fetus; antibiotics may be given to pregnant women even in non-invasive listeriosis. Mirena Nikolova, &quot;et al.&quot;, states that applying antibiotics is crucial during the third trimester because cell-mediated immunity is reduced during this time. Pfaff and Tillet say that listeriosis can cause long-term consequences—including meningitis, preterm labor, newborn sepsis, stillbirths—when contracted during pregnancy. Oral therapies in less severe cases may include amoxicillin or erythromycin. Higher doses may be given to pregnant women to ensure penetration of the umbilical cord and placenta. Infected pregnant women may receive ultrasound scans to monitor the health of the fetus.

Asymptomatic patients who have been exposed to &quot;Listeria&quot; typically are not treated, but are informed of the signs and symptoms of the disease and advised to return for treatment if any develop.

==Research==
Some &quot;Listeria&quot; species are opportunistic pathogens: &quot;L. monocytogenes&quot; is most prevalent in the elderly, pregnant mothers, and patients infected with HIV. With improved healthcare leading to a growing elderly population and extended life expectancies for HIV infected patients, physicians are more likely to encounter this otherwise-rare infection (only seven per 1,000,000 healthy people are infected with virulent &quot;Listeria&quot; each year). Better understanding the cell biology of &quot;Listeria&quot; infections, including relevant virulence factors, may lead to better treatments for listeriosis and other intracytoplasmic parasite infections.

In oncology, researchers are investigating the use of &quot;Listeria&quot; as a cancer vaccine, taking advantage of its &quot;ability to induce potent innate and adaptive immunity&quot; by activating gamma delta T cells.

Researchers have also been investigating the continuous presence of &quot;Listeria&quot; in food processing plants. The bacteria’s presence has been partially attributed to the formation of biofilms. This increases the likelihood of food contamination and is further complicated by the fact that biofilms are highly resistant to many disinfectants. The detection of these biofilms was made much easier through the use of quantitative techniques such as plate counting and crystalline violet staining. Although the structures and components of these biofilms have been extensively studied, how they are formed at the molecular level remains a subject of contention. This uncertainty surrounding their formation complicates any methods to completely eradicate the biofilms. However, it has been observed that certain antimicrobial agents such as bacteriophages and enzymes have made promising progress in the effort to eradicate the &quot;Listeria&quot; biofilm. The enzymes specifically have been noted to have the capability to disrupt specific chemical components of the biofilms, degrading them in the process. More research and development is needed to make these biofilm elimination processes more affordable and efficient to be used on a larger scale. In another study, scientists isolated a strain of Lactobacillus plantarum that was able to completely eradicate &quot;Listeria&quot; from a sample of sauerkraut.

<text>During the Second World War (1939–1945), India was a part of the British Empire. British India officially declared war on Nazi Germany in September 1939. India, as a part of the Allied Nations, sent over two and a half million soldiers to fight under British command against the Axis powers. India was also used as the base for American operations in support of China in the China Burma India Theater.

Indians fought throughout the world, including in the European theatre against Germany, North African Campaign against fascist Italy, and in the southeast Asian theatre; while also defending the Indian subcontinent against the Japanese forces, including British Burma and the Crown colony of Ceylon. Indian troops were also redeployed in former colonies such as Singapore and Hong Kong, with the Japanese surrender in August 1945, after the end of World War II. Over 87,000 Indian troops, and 3 million civilians died in World War II. Field Marshal Sir Claude Auchinleck, former Commander-in-Chief, India, stated that Britain &quot;couldn&#x27;t have come through both wars [World War I and II] if they hadn&#x27;t had the Indian Army.&quot;

There was pushback throughout India to expending lives supporting the colonial British Empire in Africa and Europe amidst movements for Indian independence. Particularly, Subhas Chandra Bose sought alliance with the Soviet Union and then ultimately with Nazi Germany as a tool for subverting the British empire. Many factions of the Indian Independence Movement did support Nazi Germany during the war, most notably the so-called Indian Legion which Bose was instrumental in creating and which was incorporated for some time as a division of the Waffen-SS. 

Viceroy Linlithgow declared that India was at war with Germany without consultations with Indian politicians. Political parties such as the Muslim League and the Hindu Mahasabha supported the British war effort while the largest and most influential political party existing in India at the time, the Indian National Congress, demanded independence before it would help Britain. London refused, and when Congress announced a &quot;Quit India&quot; campaign in August 1942, tens of thousands of its leaders were imprisoned by the British for the duration. Meanwhile, under the leadership of Indian leader Subhash Chandra Bose, Japan set up an army of Indian POWs known as the Indian National Army, which fought against the British. A major famine in Bengal in 1943 led to between 0.8 and 3.8 million deaths due to starvation, and a highly controversial issue remains regarding Churchill&#x27;s decision not to provide emergency food relief.

Indian participation in the Allied campaign remained strong. The financial, industrial and military assistance of India formed a crucial component of the British campaign against Nazi Germany and Imperial Japan. India&#x27;s strategic location at the tip of the Indian Ocean, its large production of armaments, and its huge armed forces played a decisive role in halting the progress of Imperial Japan in the South-East Asian theatre. The Indian Army during World War II was one of the largest Allied forces contingents which took part in the North and East African Campaign, Western Desert Campaign. At the height of the second World War, more than 2.5 million Indian troops were fighting Axis forces around the globe. After the end of the war, India emerged as the world&#x27;s fourth largest industrial power and its increased political, economic and military influence paved the way for its independence from the United Kingdom in 1947. The Indian servicemen who served in the British Indian Army, the Royal Indian Navy, and the Indian Air Force during World War II and still had service period remaining at the time of India&#x27;s Independence would go on to become serving members of the future armies, navies, and air forces of post-Partition India and Pakistan.

==Quit India movement==

The Indian National Congress, led by Mohandas Karamchand Gandhi, Vallabhbhai Patel and Maulana Azad, denounced Nazi Germany but would not fight it or anyone else until India was independent. Congress launched the Quit India Movement in August 1942, refusing to co-operate in any way with the government until independence was granted. The government, not ready for this, immediately arrested over 60,000 national and local Congress leaders, and then moved to suppress the violent reaction of Congress supporters. Key leaders were kept in prison until June 1945, although Gandhi was released in May 1944 because of his health. Congress, with its leaders incommunicado, played little role on the home front. Unlike the predominately Hindu Congress, the Muslim League rejected the Quit India movement and worked closely with the Raj authorities.

Supporters of the British Raj argued that decolonisation was impossible in the middle of a great war. So, in 1939, the British Viceroy, Lord Linlithgow declared India&#x27;s entry into the War without consulting prominent Indian Congress leaders who were just elected in previous elections.

Subhas Chandra Bose (also called Netaji) had been a top Congress leader. He broke up with the Congress and tried to form a military alliance with Germany or Japan to gain independence. Bose, with the assistance of Germany, formed the Indian Legion from Indian students in Axis occupied Europe and Indian Army prisoners of war. With German reversals in 1942 and 1943, Bose and the Legion&#x27;s officers were transported by U boat to Japanese territory to continue his plans. Upon arrival, Japan helped him set up the Indian National Army (INA) which fought under Japanese direction, mostly in the Burma Campaign. Bose also headed the Provisional Government of Free India, a government-in-exile based in Singapore. It controlled no Indian territory and was used only to raise troops for Japan.

==British Indian Army==

In 1939 the British Indian Army numbered 205,000 men. It took in volunteers and by 1945 was the largest all-volunteer force in history, rising to over 3.35 million men. These forces included tank, artillery and airborne forces.

Over World War II, officers and soldiers of the British Indian Army received 6,000 awards for gallantry. These included a total of 31 Victoria Crosses, the highest award in British and Commonwealth Forces for operational gallantry. British, Indian, Nepalese as well as future Pakistani soldiers and officers of the British Indian Army taken together account for these Victoria Crosses, as well for the other thousands of gallantry awards attributed to the British Indian Army. Indians were also awarded the George Cross, the highest award for non-operational gallantry and equivalent to the Victoria Cross. Significantly, in World War II, several Indian officers also received the Distinguished Service Order (DSO). The DSO was a level 2A order-cum-decoration, second only to the Victoria Cross, that could be bestowed only upon commissioned officers for operational gallantry and leadership under conditions of actual combat. The DSO became available to Indian officers largely following the gradual Indianisation of the officer ranks of the British Indian Army 1923 onwards. A rare exception was Hiraji Cursetji, an Indian military surgeon who was awarded the DSO during World War I. Level 3A decorations awarded to Indian officers in World War II included the Distinguished Service Cross (DSC), the Military Cross (MC), and the Distinguished Flying Cross (DFC). Other high military recognitions included appointments as officers or members of the Order of the British Empire (shortened as OBE and MBE respectively), both of which ranked below the DSO but above the level 3A decorations.

===South-East Asian theatre===

The British Indian Army was the key British Empire fighting presence in the Burma Campaign. The Royal Indian Air force&#x27;s first assault mission was carried out against Japanese troops stationed in Burma. The British Indian Army was key to breaking the siege of Imphal when the westward advance of Imperial Japan came to a halt.

The formations included the Indian III Corps, IV Corps, the Indian XXXIII Corps and the Fourteenth Army. As part of the new concept of Long Range Penetration (LRP), Gurkha troops of the Indian Army were trained in the present state of Madhya Pradesh under their commander (later Major General) Orde Charles Wingate.

These troops, popularly known as &quot;Chindits&quot;, played a crucial role in halting the Japanese advance into South Asia.

====Capture of Indian territory====
By 1942, neighbouring Burma was invaded by Japan, which by then had already captured the Indian territory of Andaman and Nicobar Islands. Japan gave nominal control of the islands to the Provisional Government of Free India on 21 October 1943, and in the following March, the Indian National Army with the help of Japan crossed into India and advanced as far as Kohima in Nagaland. This advance on the mainland of South Asia reached its farthest point on India territory, with the Japanese finally retreating from the Battle of Kohima and near simultaneous Battle of Imphal in June 1944.

====Recapture of Axis-occupied territory====
In 1944–45 Japan was under heavy air bombardment at home and suffered massive naval defeats in the Pacific. As its Imphal offensive failed, harsh weather and disease and withdrawal of air cover (due to more pressing needs in the Pacific) also took its toll on the Japanese and remnants of the INA and the Burma National Army. In spring 1945, a resurgent British army recaptured the occupied lands.

==== Notable Indian recipients of gallantry awards ====
For the highest gallantry in the South East Asian theatre, the Victoria Cross was awarded to Fazal Din, Abdul Hafiz, Karamjeet Judge, Ganju Lama, Bhandari Ram, Sher Shah, Gian Singh, Nand Singh, Parkash Singh, Prakash Singh Chib, Ram Sarup Singh, and Umrao Singh. In the same theatre, the George Cross was awarded to Mateen Ansari, Islam-ud-Din, Abdul Rahman, and Mahmood Khan Durrani (future Pakistan Army officer).

For their gallant leadership and personal bravery in different battles during the Burma Campaign, the DSO was awarded to Kondandera Subayya Thimayya (future COAS, Indian Army), Lionel Protip Sen (future CGS, Indian Army), S.P.P. Thorat (future CGS, Indian Army), Harbans Singh Virk, and Sarbjit Singh Kalha. Siri Kanth Korla, a future division commander of the Indian Army during the 1965 Indo-Pakistani War, was awarded the DSO, the MC, and two Mentions in Dispatches for gallantry in different episodes of this Campaign. The Indian DSO winners in Burma also included Akbar Khan, future leader of Pakistani irregular forces in the Indo-Pakistani War of 1947-48 as well as a future CGS, Pakistani Army.

Gurbakhsh Singh was awarded the DSO and appointed as an OBE for leading a contingent the British Indian Army in Japanese captivity in Singapore, and for preventing defection of his men to the Indian National Army during this internment. Abrar Hussain, a future divisional commander of the Pakistan Army in the 1965 Indo-Pakistani war, was appointed as an MBE for a similar feat with interned personnel of the 2/10 Baluch in Singapore.

K.M. Cariappa, the future second Field Marshall of the Indian Army, was appointed as an OBE for non-combat service in this theatre.

Miyan Hayaud Din, another future CGS, Pakistan Army, was appointed as MBE and awarded the MC for his actions in Burma.

Sam Manekshaw (the future first Field Marshall of the Indian Army) and A.A.K. Niazi, who would go on to lead the Indian and Pakistani armies respectively during the 1971 Indo-Pakistani War, were both awarded the MC in the Burma Campaign. Naveen Chand Rawlley, future VCOAS, Indian Army, was also awarded the MC in Burma.

===Middle East and African theatre===

The British government meanwhile sent Indian troops to fight in West Asia and northern Africa against the Axis. India also geared up to produce essential goods such as food and uniforms.

The 4th, 5th and 10th Indian Divisions took part in the North African theatre against Rommel&#x27;s Afrika Korps. In addition, the 18th Brigade of the 8th Indian Division fought at Alamein. Earlier, the 4th and 5th Indian Divisions took part in the East African campaign against the Italians in Somaliland, Eritrea and Abyssinia capturing the mountain fortress of Keren. In the Battle of Bir Hacheim, Indian gunners played an important role by using guns in the anti tank role and destroying tanks of Rommel&#x27;s panzer divisions.

==== Notable Indian recipients of gallantry awards ====
Premindra Singh Bhagat (future co-author of the Henderson Brooks - Bhagat report), Richhpal Ram, and Chhelu Ram were awarded the Victoria Cross in the Middle East and African Theatre.

PP Kumaramangalam and Rajendrasinjhi Jadeja (both future COAS, Indian Army), and Vidya Dhar Jayal, a future brigade commander of the Indian Army during the 1947-48 Indo-Pakistani War, were awarded the DSO in this theatre.

Jayanto Nath Chaudhari, future COAS, Indian Army, was appointed as an OBE for gallant service in the Middle East.

Muhammad Musa (future head of the Pakistani Army during the 1965 Indo-Pakistani war) was appointed as an MBE for his action in the Middle East.

===Invasion of Italy===

Indian forces played a role in liberating Italy from Nazi control. India contributed the third largest Allied contingent in the Italian campaign after US and British forces. The 4th, 8th and 10th Divisions and 43rd Gurkha Infantry Brigade led the advance, notably at the gruelling Battle of Monte Cassino. They fought on the Gothic Line in 1944 and 1945.

==== Notable Indian recipients of gallantry awards ====
Yashwant Ghadge, Namdeo Jadhav, Kamal Ram, and Ali Haider (future Pakistani Army officer) were awarded the Victoria Cross during the Invasion of Italy. Subramaniam and Ditto Ram were awarded the George Cross for actions in Italy.

Thakur Mahadeo Singh, future first native commandant of the Indian Military Academy, was awarded the DSO for actions in Italy.

Kashmir Singh Katoch, future VCOAS, Indian Army, was awarded the MC in Italy. Bakhtiar Rana, future corps commander of the Pakistan Army in West Pakistan during the 1965 Indo-Pakistan War, was also awarded the MC in this theatre.

== Royal Indian Air Force ==

During World War II, the IAF played an instrumental role in halting the advance of the Japanese army in Burma, where the first IAF air strike was executed. The target for this first mission was the Japanese military base in Arakan, after which IAF strike missions continued against the Japanese airbases at Mae Hong Son, Chiang Mai and Chiang Rai in northern Thailand.

The IAF was mainly involved in strike, close air support, aerial reconnaissance, bomber escort and pathfinding missions for RAF and USAAF heavy bombers. RAF and IAF pilots would train by flying with their non-native air wings to gain combat experience and communication proficiency. Besides operations in the Burma Theatre IAF pilots participated in air operations in North Africa and Europe.


During the war, the IAF experienced a phase of steady expansion. Many Indian airmen in the Royal Air Force were seconded or transferred to the expanding IAF. New aircraft added to the fleet included the US-built Vultee Vengeance, Douglas Dakota, the British Hawker Hurricane, Supermarine Spitfire, Bristol Blenheim, and Westland Lysander.

Subhas Chandra Bose sent Indian National Army youth cadets to Japan to train as pilots. They went on to attend the Imperial Japanese Army Air Force Academy in 1944.

In recognition of the valiant service by the IAF, King George VI conferred the prefix &quot;Royal&quot; in 1945. Thereafter the IAF was referred to as the &quot;Royal Indian Air Force&quot;. In 1950, when India became a republic, the prefix was dropped and it reverted to being the Indian Air Force.

Post war, No. 4 Squadron IAF was sent to Japan as part of the Allied Occupation forces.

=== Notable Indian recipients of gallantry awards ===
In addition to the IAF, many native Indians and some 200 Indians resident in Britain volunteered to join the RAF and Women&#x27;s Auxiliary Air Force (WAAF). One such officer volunteer was Assistant Section Officer Noor Inayat Khan, a pacifist of Indian origin who joined the WAAF, in November 1940, to fight against Nazism. Noor Khan served bravely as a secret agent with the Special Operations Executive (SOE) in France, but was eventually betrayed, captured, and executed by the Nazis. She was posthumously awarded the George Cross.

Mehar Singh, Indian flying prodigy, was awarded the DSO for his actions in Burma.

Karun Krishna Majumdar, the first Indian to reach the rank of Wing Commander, was awarded the DFC &amp; bar. Arjan Singh (future Marshal of the Indian Air Force), Pratap Chandra Lal (future chief of the IAF during Indo-Pakistani War of 1971), and Ramaswamy Rajaram (future VCAS, IAF) were awarded the DFC in Burma. The brothers Aspy Engineer and Minoo Merwam Engineer, who both later became Air Marshalls of the IAF, were also awarded the DFC.

== Royal Indian Navy ==


In 1934, the Royal Indian Marine changed its name, with the enactment of the Indian Navy (Discipline) Act of 1934. The Royal Indian Navy was formally inaugurated on 2 October 1934, at Bombay. Its ships carried the prefix HMIS, for His Majesty&#x27;s Indian Ship.

At the start of the Second World War, the Royal Indian Navy was small, with only eight warships. The onset of the war led to an expansion in vessels and personnel described by one writer as &quot;phenomenal&quot;. By 1943 the strength of the RIN had reached twenty thousand.
During the War, the Women&#x27;s Royal Indian Naval Service was established, for the first time giving women a role in the navy, although they did not serve on board its ships.

During the course of the war six anti-aircraft sloops and several fleet minesweepers were built in the United Kingdom for the R.I.N. After commissioning, many of these ships joined various escort groups operating in the northern approaches to the British Isles. and , each armed with six-high angle 4&quot; guns, were present during the Clyde &quot;Blitz&quot; of 1941 and assisted the defence of this area by providing anti-aircraft cover. For the next six months these two ships joined the Clyde Escort Force, operating in the Atlantic and later the Irish Sea Escort Force where they acted as the senior ships of the groups. While engaged on these duties, numerous attacks against U-boats were carried out and attacks by hostile aircraft repelled. At the time of action in which the Bismarck was involved, the Sutlej left Scapa Flow, with all despatch as the senior member of a group, to take over a convoy from the destroyers which were finally engaged in the sinking of the Bismarck.

Later , , , , also antiaircraft sloops, completed similar periods in the U.K. waters escorting convoys in the Atlantic and dealing with attacks from hostile U-boats, aircraft and glider bombs. These six ships and the minesweepers all eventually proceeded to India carrying out various duties in the North Atlantic, Mediterranean and Cape stations en route. The fleet minesweepers were , , , , , , , , .

HMIS Bengal was a part of the Eastern Fleet during World War II, and escorted numerous convoys between 1942 and 1945.

The sloops and played a role in Operation Husky, the Allied invasion of Sicily by providing air defence and anti-submarine screening to the invasion fleet.

Furthermore, the Royal Indian Navy participated in convoy escort duties in the Indian Ocean and Mediterranean and was heavily involved in combat operations as part of the Burma Campaign, carrying out raids, shore bombardment, naval invasion support and other activities culminating in Operation Dracula and the mopping up operations during the final stages of the war.

=== Royal Indian Naval combat losses ===
The sloop HMIS &quot;Pathan&quot; sunk in June 1940 by the Italian Navy Submarine &quot;Galvani&quot; during the East African Campaign

In the days immediately following the Attack on Pearl Harbor, was patrolling the Laccadive Islands in search of Japanese ships and submarines. At midnight on 9 December 1941, HMS Glasgow sank the RIN patrol vessel HMIS Prabhavati with two lighters in tow en route to Karachi, with 6-inch shells at 6,000 yards (5,500 m). Prabhavati was alongside the lighters and was mistaken for a surfaced Japanese submarine.

 was sunk by Japanese aircraft during Burma Campaign on 6 April 1942.

=== Royal Indian Naval successes ===

 was ordered in 1939, and built by William Denny and Brothers. She was commissioned in 1941, and with World War II underway, was immediately deployed as a convoy escort. &quot;Jumna&quot; served as an anti-aircraft escort during the Java Sea campaign in early 1942, and was involved in intensive anti-aircraft action against attacking Japanese twin-engined level bombers and dive bombers, claiming five aircraft downed from 24 to 28 February 1942.

In June 1942 was involved in the defence of Sydney Harbour during the attack on Sydney Harbour.

On 11 November 1942, &quot;Bengal&quot; was escorting the Dutch tanker &quot;Ondina&quot; to the southwest of Cocos Islands in the Indian Ocean. Two Japanese commerce raiders armed with six-inch guns attacked &quot;Ondina&quot;. &quot;Bengal&quot; fired her single four-inch gun and &quot;Ondina&quot; fired her 102 mm and both scored hits on &quot;Hōkoku Maru&quot;, which shortly blew up and sank.

On 12 Feb 1944, the Japanese submarine RO-110 was depth charged and sunk east-south-east off Visakhapatnam, India by the Indian sloop and the Australian minesweepers HMAS Launceston and HMAS Ipswich (J186). RO-110 had attacked convoy JC-36 (Colombo-Calcutta) and torpedoed and damaged the British merchant Asphalion (6274 GRT).

On 12 August 1944 the German submarine &quot;U-198&quot; was sunk near the Seychelles, in position 03º35&#x27;S, 52º49&#x27;E, by depth charges from and the British frigate HMS Findhorn.

==== Notable Indian recipients of gallantry awards ====
HMS Choudri, the future first native Commander-in-Chief of the Pakistani Navy, was appointed as an MBE for his services in the Royal Indian Navy in 1945.

Nilakanta Krishnan, future commander of the Indian Navy in the Bay of Bengal during the 1971 Indo-Pakistani War, was awarded the DSC in 1941.

==Collaboration with the Axis powers==

Several leaders of the radical revolutionary Indian independence movement broke away from the main Congress and went to war against Britain. Subhas Chandra Bose, once a prominent leader in the Indian National Congress, volunteered to help Nazi Germany and Japan; he claimed in speeches that Britain&#x27;s opposition to Nazism and Fascism was &quot;hypocrisy&quot;, since Britain was itself denying individual liberties to Indians. Moreover, he argued that it was not Germany and Japan but the British Raj which was the enemy, since the British were over-exploiting Indian resources for the war. Bose suggested that there was little possibility of India being attacked by any of the Axis powers provided it did not fight the war on Britain&#x27;s side.

Nazi Germany was encouraging but gave little help. Bose then approached the Japanese Empire at Tokyo, which gave him control of Indian forces it had organised.

The Indian National Army (INA), formed first by Mohan Singh Deb, consisted initially of prisoners taken by the Japanese in Malaya and at Singapore who were offered the choice of serving the INA by Japan or remaining in very poor conditions in POW camps. Later, after it was reorganised under Subhas Chandra Bose, it drew civilian volunteers from Malaya and Burma. Ultimately, a force of under 40,000 was formed, although only two divisions ever participated in battle. Intelligence and special services groups from the INA were instrumental in destabilising the British Indian Army in the early stages of the Arakan offensive. It was during this time that the British Military Intelligence began propaganda work to shield the true numbers who joined the INA, and also described stories of Japanese brutalities that indicated INA involvement. Further, the Indian press was prohibited from publishing any accounts whatsoever of the INA.

As the Japanese offensive opened, the INA was sent into battle. Bose hoped to avoid set-piece battles for which it lacked arms, armament as well as man-power. Initially, he sought to obtain arms as well as increase its ranks from British Indian soldiers he hoped would defect to his cause. Once the Japanese forces were able to break the British defences at Imphal, he planned for the INA to cross the hills of North-East India into the Gangetic plain, where it was to work as a guerrilla army and expected to live off the land, garner support, supplies, and ranks from amongst the local populace to ultimately touch off a revolution.

Prem Kumar Sahgal, an officer of the INA once Military secretary to Subhas Bose and later tried in the first Red Fort trials, explained that although the war itself hung in balance and nobody was sure if the Japanese would win, initiating a popular revolution with grass-root support within India would ensure that even if Japan lost the war ultimately, Britain would not be in a position to re-assert its colonial authority, which was ultimately the aim of the INA and Azad Hind.

As Japan opened its offensive towards India, the INA&#x27;s first division, consisting of four Guerrilla regiments, participated in Arakan offensive in 1944, with one battalion reaching as far as Mowdok in Chittagong. Other units were directed to Imphal and Kohima, as well as to protect Japanese flanks to the south of Arakan, a task it successfully carried out. However, the first division suffered the same fate as did Mutaguchi&#x27;s Army when the siege of Imphal was broken. With little or no supplies and supply lines deluged by the Monsoon, harassed by Allied air dominance, the INA began withdrawing when the 15th Army and Burma Area Army began withdrawing, and suffered the same terrible fate as wounded, starved and diseased men succumbed during the hasty withdrawal into Burma. Later in the war however, the INA&#x27;s second division, tasked with the defence of Irrawaddy and the adjoining areas around Nangyu, was instrumental in opposing Messervy&#x27;s 7th Indian Infantry Division when it attempted to cross the river at Pagan and Nyangyu during the successful Burma Campaign by the Allies the following year. The 2nd division was instrumental in denying the 17th Indian Infantry Division the area around Mount Popa that would have exposed the flank of Kimura&#x27;s forces attempting to retake Meiktila and Nyangyu. Ultimately however, the division was obliterated. Some of the surviving units of the INA surrendered as Rangoon fell, and helped keep order till the allied forces entered the city. The other remnants began a long march over land and on foot towards Singapore, along with Subhas Chandra Bose. As the Japanese situation became precarious, Bose left for Manchuria to attempt to contact the Russians, and was reported to have died in an air crash near Taiwan.

The only Indian territory that the Azad Hind government controlled was nominally the Andaman and Nicobar Islands. However, they were bases for the Japanese Navy, and the navy never relinquished control. Enraged with the lack of administrative control, the Azad Hind Governor, Lt. Col. Loganathan, later relinquished his authority. After the War, a number of officers of the INA were tried for treason. However, faced with the possibility of a massive civil unrest and a mutiny in the Indian Army, the British officials decided to release the prisoners-of-war; in addition, the event became a turning point to expedite the process of transformation of power and independence of India.

==Bengal famine==
The region of Bengal in India suffered a devastating famine from 1943 to 1944. Some of the key reasons for this famine are:

# Japanese invasion of Burma which cut off food and other essential supplies to the region;
# British export of food and material for the war in Europe;
# British denial orders destroying essential food transportation throughout the Eastern region;
# British banned transfer of grain from other provinces, turning down offers of grain from Australia;
# mismanagement by British Indian regional governments;
# constructing 900 airfields (2000 acres each) taking that huge amount of land out of agriculture in a time of dire need;
# price inflation caused by war production
# increase in demand partially as a result of refugees from Burma and Bengal.

The British government denied an urgent request from Leopold Amery, the Indian secretary of state, and Archibald Wavell, the Viceroy of India, to stop exports of food from Bengal in order that it might be used for famine relief. Winston Churchill, then prime minister, dismissed these requests in a fashion that Amery regarded as &quot;Hitler-like,&quot; by asking why, if the famine was so horrible, Gandhi had not yet died of starvation.

Indian Economist Amartya Sen (1976) challenged this orthodoxy, reviving the claim that there was no shortage of food in Bengal and that the famine was caused by inflation.

==Princely states==

During World War II, in 1941, the British presented a captured German BF 109 single-engined fighter to the Nizam of Hyderabad, in return for the funding of 2 RAF fighter squadrons.

There was a campsite for Polish refugees at Valivade, in Kolhapur State, it was the largest settlement of Polish refugees in India during the war. Another such campsite for Polish refugee children was located in Balachadi, it was built by K. S. Digvijaysinhji, Jam Saheb Maharaja of Nawanagar State in 1942, near his summer resort. He gave refuge to hundreds of Polish children rescued from Soviet camps (Gulags). The campsite is now part of the Sainik School.

== 1944–45 Insurgency in Balochistan ==
From 1944 to 1945, Daru Khan Badinzai led an insurgency against the authorities of the Raj. It began in the first half of 1944, when rebels of the Badinzai tribe began interfering with road construction on the British side of the Balochistan border. The insurgency had subsided by March 1945.

== Mazrak Zadran&#x27;s invasion of India ==

In 1944, the Southern and Eastern provinces of Afghanistan entered a state of turmoil, with the Zadran, Safi and Mangal tribes rising up against the Afghan government. Among the leaders of the revolt was the Zadran chieftain, Mazrak Zadran, who opted to invade British India in late 1944. There he was joined by a Baloch chieftain, Sultan Ahmed. Mazrak was forced to retreat back into Afghanistan due to British aerial bombardment.

<text>Arthur Dewey Struble (June 28, 1894 – May 1, 1983) was a United States admiral who served in World War II and the Korean War.

==Biography==
Struble was born in Portland, Oregon. Following graduation from high school in Portland, he entered the United States Naval Academy in 1911 and was commissioned as an ensign in June 1915. Over the next six years, he served in two cruisers, a supply ship and three destroyers. In 1921–23, Struble was an instructor at the Naval Academy, then served in the battleship &quot;California&quot; (BB-44) until 1925, when he was assigned to the Battle Fleet staff. From 1927 until 1940, he served twice in Navy Department billets, twice on seagoing flag staffs, in &quot;New York&quot; (BB-34) and &quot;Portland&quot; (CA-33), and at the 12th Naval District. In 1940-41, he was Executive Officer of &quot;Arizona&quot; (BB-39). Captain Struble next commanded the light cruiser &quot;Trenton&quot; (CL-11) in the Pacific.

Leaving &quot;Trenton&quot; in May 1942, Struble had duty in the Office of the Chief of Naval Operations until late 1943, when he became Chief of Staff to Rear Admiral Alan G. Kirk, who was responsible for U.S. Navy participation in the Normandy Invasion of June 1944. Rear Admiral Struble was assigned to command a Seventh Fleet amphibious group in August 1944, and participated in the invasion of Leyte the following October. Over the next several months, he commanded or participated in landing operations at Ormoc Bay, Mindoro, Luzon and elsewhere in the Philippines. In September 1945, following the end of the Pacific war, Struble commanded the Pacific Fleet&#x27;s mine force as it began the long process of clearing mines from the former combat zone. 

He commanded the Amphibious Force, Pacific Fleet, during 1946–48. Promoted to vice admiral in April 1948, Struble served for two years as Deputy Chief of Naval Operations. 

In May 1950, he took command of the Seventh Fleet, leading that force through the difficult first year of the Korean War, including the landings at Inchon and Wonsan. For a year, beginning in March 1951, Vice Admiral Struble was Commander, First Fleet, then served briefly with the Joint Chiefs of Staff before being assigned successively to head the U.S. Naval and U.S. Military delegations to the United Nations&#x27; Military Staff Committee. From June 1955, he was Commander Eastern Sea Frontier and Commander Atlantic Reserve Fleet. Upon his retirement from active duty in July 1956, he was advanced to the rank of admiral on the basis of his combat awards. 

Admiral Arthur D. Struble died on May 1, 1983.

<text>is an eroge video game developed by ActiveSoft and published on July 14, 2000. Sei Shoujo is the original creator of the game&#x27;s artwork, character design and penned the original script for the game. It received notable critical acclaim for an eroge hentai anime.

Milky Studio has since adapted the game into several adult anime adaptations. The first adaptation, simply titled &quot;Bible Black&quot;, consisted of six episodes covering numerous scenes from the video game. The following year, a two-episode OVA titled &quot;Bible Black: Origins&quot; was released, which served as a prequel to the events of &quot;Bible Black&quot;. In April 2004, Milky Studio produced a sequel series titled &quot;Bible Black: New Testament&quot;, which follows the exploits of the original characters ten years after &quot;Bible Black&quot; takes place. The latest OVA adaptation, &quot;Bible Black Only&quot;, consists of gaiden stories explaining what happened to various characters during the plot of &quot;Bible Black&quot;.

The game was republished in 2006 as &quot;Bible Black Slim&quot; featuring extended scenes, followed by a short sequel named &quot;Bible Black Infection&quot; in 2008. Neither of these games involved the original artist/writer Sei Shoujo as he had left ActiveSoft by this time.

==Synopsis==
===Setting===
The game takes place in an academy rumored to have been the base of operations for a coven, twelve years prior to the premiere installment. This witchcraft club practiced black magic in a storage room of the academy&#x27;s basement.

===Plot===
Taki Minase, a high school student, finds a book of black magic in the isolated storage room of his school. He begins practicing black magic, which has extreme sexual effects that benefit him and his friends, until evil comes forth from the dark craft. Eventually, the origins of the book are revealed, as is the incident on Walpurgis Night twelve years prior, when the evil force was at its strongest. After coming to his senses, Minase struggles to get himself out of the darkness into which he has put himself and his best friend and secret love, Kurumi Imari.

==Characters==
: The main character, a high school student who discovers the magic book (known as &quot;Bible Black&quot;) in a school basement and becomes a pawn of powerful dark magic.
: Minase&#x27;s childhood friend, neighbor and de facto girlfriend. She comes over to wake Minase up every morning. She knows everything about Minase, and tries to help him in every way.

==Visual novel==
The game has twelve different endings, and the storyline often diverges, based on choices made by the player, which influence &quot;neutral&quot; endings, &quot;chaos&quot; endings and &quot;law&quot; endings. However, there is only one outcome regarded by its developers as the &quot;true&quot; ending. &quot;Bible Black&quot; was published in English in 2006, under the name &quot;Bible Black: The Game&quot; after Activesoft ceased operations. A port was released only in Japan for the PlayStation Portable&#x27;s UMD format, where it was not required to receive a CERO rating.

==Anime==
===&quot;Bible Black&quot;===
 is the eponymous first OVA adaptation of the video game.

An academy student, Taki Minase, finds a strange book, the Bible Black, while exploring an abandoned room in the school&#x27;s basement. With the help of his cousin, he translates the Latin-French writings and finds them to be instructions for dark magic, which is actually a form of Kabbalistic satanism (the translation was not mentioned in the OVA).

Using the book&#x27;s magic, Minase is able to make Rika Shiraki fall in love with him, as well as help his friend, Ayumi Murai, get the boy she loves to love her back. Reika Kitami, the school nurse, hears of his magical acts and decides to sway him to her since she needs the book for herself. Twelve years prior on Walpurgis Night, Kitami was used as a sacrifice for the previous Witchcraft Club and only survived after making a deal with Satan, becoming a &quot;futanari&quot; in the process. Kitami now needs a virgin girl to act as a vessel for her reincarnation as the life that Satan has given her is running out. Kaori Saeki, the head of the new Witchcraft Club, also notes Minase&#x27;s magic acts and persuades him to come to one of her meetings with the book. After being seduced by Kitami and possessed by a lesser demon, Minase brings her with him and she rapes Saeki into submission, taking over the Witchcraft Club.

Kitami holds private counseling sessions for girls, trying to find the virgin she needs. She reveals to Minase that the two girls she has had her eyes on were Shiraki and Minase&#x27;s childhood friend, Kurumi Imari. However, since Shiraki is no longer a virgin (thanks to Minase), Kitami pursues Imari, who has been missing school recently after walking in on Minase and Shiraki during intercourse. Kitami also regularly kidnaps the art teacher, Hiroko Takashiro, and performs sexual tortures on her after finding out that Takashiro was the head of the Witchcraft Club that had sacrificed her, even though Takashiro had left the circle prior to the ritual.

After Imari is abducted by Kitami, the lesser demon leaves Minase and he realizes that he loves Imari and must save her. With the help of Takashiro and the Bible Black, he finds a spell Takashiro believes will stop Kitami&#x27;s evil scheme. By this point, it is Walpurgis Night once again, and Kitami plans to reincarnate herself into Imari. Kitami slits her wrists and has sexual intercourse with Imari as the reincarnation ritual demands, but Minase interrupts it and casts his spell on Kitami. This apparently causes the ritual to fail, and Kitami dies from blood loss.

Afterwards, Minase and Imari confess their love for each other and have intercourse. Some time later, Saeki is seen in the Witchcraft Club sanctuary, planning to steal the Bible Black, which was going to be left there before the entrance was sealed. Imari enters the room and destroys the Bible Black with a fire spell, then reveals herself as a &quot;futanari&quot;, showing that Kitami&#x27;s ritual was successful. The series ends with Imari deciding to test her new body out by raping Saeki again.

All six episodes of &quot;Bible Black&quot; have since been re-cut as a 110-minute film titled . The series was also involved in a bit of minor controversy when it was aired as a &quot;midnight movie&quot; at a time when other anime films were being played on Canadian youth station Teletoon, supposedly as an accident of nobody checking what was screened. Only the first 30 minutes were played.

====Cast and characters====
====Episodes====
===&quot;Bible Black: Origins&quot;===
 is the game&#x27;s second OVA adaptation, released on May 25, 2002. Set about twelve years before the events of the original OVA, Hiroko Takashiro and Reika Kitami are now students at the school, and several new characters are also introduced. The first episode opens with two female students, Nami Kozono and her lover Junko Mochida, having sex in a classroom after school. In another classroom, Hiroko Takashiro and her two best friends Rie Morita and Saki Shindou are reading Tarot cards. They receive a fortune reading: &quot;Great change is upon you. Something will change your life, completely.&quot; Nami soon interrupts them and says that they should leave if they are not part of a club. After she berates the group for their interest in Witchcraft, Hiroko warns her to not take Witchcraft lightly. She explains that they are trying to learn the truth about history through Witchcraft, and even asks Nami to join them. Nami is initially intrigued, but quickly brushes it off and mocks them again.

The next day, the school receives a new transfer student, Reika Kitami, a beautiful but naive girl; meanwhile, Rie finds the titular Bible Black in an antique store and shares it with Hiroko and Saki. Here it is also revealed that the girls&#x27; request to start a Witchcraft club has been denied by Nami, who is the head of Student Council.

Nami takes a strong interest in Reika, and flirts with her in the bathroom later that day, though this only seems to make her uncomfortable. When Reika does not return Nami&#x27;s affection, her flirting turns into unwanted sexual advances. After school, Nami offers to tutor Reika in a class she is having trouble with, and uses it as an opportunity to sexually assault her. When a humiliated Reika rejects her, Nami becomes furious—having never been rejected in her life—and storms out.

Hiroko and her friends begin to translate the Franco-Latin-Hebraic text of the Bible Black, and plan to get revenge on Nami for forbidding them to start a Witchcraft club. As a test run, they cast a simple spell on Nami&#x27;s lover, Junko, which is said to make a young woman &quot;dance naked&quot;. Their spell proves successful when the next day Junko becomes aroused while giving a speech for an assembly, causing her to strip down and masturbate in front of the whole school. Nami is horrified by the incident, and becomes suspicious of the group when Saki later threatens that she might &quot;be the next to dance naked&quot;.

After school, Hiratani, an outcast male student who is obsessed with Nami, asks the group to put a spell on Nami to make her fall in love with him. They do this, and when Nami arrives at school the next day, she finds herself hopelessly infatuated with Hiratani. She asks him to meet her in the Student Council room during lunch, where they have sex many times. Hiroko, Rie and Saki look on through a window, amazed that their magic has worked. The group is approached by other students (and a few teachers) to do similar favors, and they make a fair amount of money.

Desperate for even more of Hiratani&#x27;s attention, Nami goes to Hiroko and her friends one day after school and begs them to use their magic to make Hiratani love her forever. Hiroko says she will do this, in exchange for a place where the group can practice their magic. Nami arranges for them to use the school basement, and Hiroko agrees to cast the spell. But instead of carrying out Nami&#x27;s request, she casts a &quot;release spell&quot; on her, causing her to come to her senses and become furious, disgusted that she &quot;fucked that filthy man&quot;, and Nami flees the room in anger.

Returning to school the next day, Nami is disgusted to find that Hiratani is still very much in love with her. She orders a group of thugs to beat him into unconsciousness in a warehouse. With Hiratani gone, Nami begins to pursue Reika again, begging her to have sex with her in order to &quot;purify&quot; her body of Hiratani&#x27;s stench. Reika finally lashes out and slaps Nami in self-defense, calling her crazy.

Eager for revenge on both Reika and Hiroko&#x27;s group, Nami gains the trust of Hiroko and asks to join their club (now called &quot;Rose Cross&quot;). Hiroko allows her in, amused at how eager Nami is to join them after initially mocking them.

The group plans to eventually summon Satan himself, but realize that they need a test before they move onto a full human sacrifice. For their first ritual, they decide to summon a demon, in order to get Satan on their side. For the sacrifice, they slaughter a stray puppy that Reika had befriended upon first coming to school. However, the ritual goes horribly wrong and the demon proceeds to violently rape Hiroko, thus sending her to the hospital.

With Walpurgis Night fast approaching, Nami takes advantage of Hiroko&#x27;s absence and makes herself the leader of Rose Cross. On the day of Walpurgis, she decides to use Reika as a virgin sacrifice that will open the Gates of Hell. She has her thugs kidnap Reika and take her to the warehouse, where they reveal to her the carcass of the sacrificed puppy. Nami gives the thugs permission to gang-rape Reika while she and the group prepare for the ritual, so long as they only engage in anal intercourse with her, thus keeping her virginity intact. One of the thugs ignores her order and takes Reika&#x27;s virginity anyway, unbeknownst to Nami. Meanwhile, Hiroko wakes up in the hospital and, realizing it is Walpurgis night, checks herself out. Upon returning, she urges the group to stop using magic, saying its power is far too strong for them to handle. She fails to convince them, however, and is forcibly ousted by Nami and the rest of the group, and is placed by Rie and Saki in a closet until the ritual ends.

Reika is sacrificed, but since she is no longer a virgin, the Gates of Hell react but do not open. Nami, now delirious and hellbent on getting revenge on the group, goes on a murderous rampage and slaughters the other members, including Hiroko&#x27;s friends, until the Gates finally begin to open. Nami drops her sword on the ground and stands in front of the gates to chant to Satan. Reika—severely injured, but still alive—uses the last of her strength to stab Nami to death. Satan then proposes a contract to the dying Reika: he will allow her several more years to live, if she gives him her soul in return. Reluctant, but quickly dying, Reika accepts the deal.

Moments later, Hiroko, having managed to free herself, hurries down to the basement, only to find that the ritual had ended, and that the members of Rose Cross (Nami, Rie, and Saki included) have all been savagely slaughtered. The series ends with a visibly disturbed Reika, naked and bloodied from head to toe, roaming the town at dawn, looking blissfully towards the sky. The scene fades out with a shot of her still walking through the town, on her way to becoming the woman that Kurumi Imari and Taki Minase would meet twelve years later.

===&quot;New Bible Black&quot;===
, is the third installment of the OVA series. Years have passed since Walpurgis Night, and the girls of the Witchcraft Club have all graduated, and made their way in the world. Both Shiraki and Saeki become teachers at their school, while Takashiro becomes a Buddhist nun. Imari has become a police woman, who serves as a psychic investigator in the Tokken division. Her team is looking into a series of horribly gruesome murder cases, that all seem to have happened during sexual intercourse.

Strangely, witnesses see a ghostly figure at the crime scenes. Saeki restarts the Witchcraft Club with a new crop of girls, but it&#x27;s unclear at first, whether she is fighting or helping Kitami. Meanwhile, Imari and her Tokken subordinate, Aki, are caught up in a bank robbery, conducted by occult robbers. An impromptu ceremony performed at the scene causes Kitami to take over the possessed Imari. In the aftermath, Imari steals the Lance of Longinus that the robbers were after, from the bank vault.

Imari/Kitami has found the virginal &quot;Scarlet Woman&quot; in Aki. She indulges in the sexual ceremony with her, using the Lance of Longinus. Meanwhile, the ghostly figure, identified as Jody Crowley, and Takashiro, both interfere with the ceremony, albeit with different intentions. The Lance becomes permanently lodged within Aki&#x27;s vagina, and she is now targeted by the various forces of black magic.

The final ceremony climaxes with the black magic forces of Imari/Kitami, and Jody Crowley, both competing over the Scarlet Woman. Attacks fly all around, while Takashiro and Captain Yuge struggle to defeat both of them, hoping to end the ceremony. When Jody seems to emerge triumphant, the Lance of Longinus reappears out of Aki, and reanimates the original grimoire, the Bible Black. The devil emerges to take the souls of contract: Reika Kitami and Jody Crowley. A final effort by Takashiro manages to seal the grimoire while Jody&#x27;s soul is taken, and Kitami manages to possess Jody&#x27;s body instead. The final scene seems peaceful, with everybody content with how things turned out to be, but during one of the final shots, Aki&#x27;s laptop screensaver happens to be several images of a menacing Kitami, hinting at a possible future installment to the series.

Most of the characters from Bible Black return in &quot;New Testament&quot;; however, Minase does not appear and is only mentioned once, leaving his fate unclear.

All six episodes of &quot;New Testament&quot; have since been recut as a 120-minute film titled , and in addition contains extended animation.

====Episodes====
===&quot;Bible Black Only&quot;===
 consists of seven short films, which depict sexual side stories that take place around the time of the original series.

<doc id="803852" wikidata="Q358824" url="?curid=803852" title="Field Day (amateur radio)">
<text>Field Day is an annual amateur radio contest, widely sponsored by IARU regions and member organizations, encouraging emergency communications preparedness among amateur radio operators. In the United States, it is typically the largest single emergency preparedness exercise in the country, with over 30,000 operators participating each year. Field Day is always the fourth full weekend of June, beginning at 18:00 UTC Saturday and running through 20:59 UTC Sunday.

Since the first ARRL Field Day in 1933, radio amateurs throughout North America have practiced the rapid deployment of radio communications equipment in environments ranging from operations under tents in remote areas to operations inside Emergency Operations Centers (EOCs). Operations using emergency and alternative power sources are highly encouraged, since electricity and other public infrastructures are often among the first to fail during a natural disaster or severe weather.

To determine the effectiveness of the exercise and of each participant&#x27;s operations, there is an integrated competitive component, and many clubs also engage in concurrent leisure activities (e.g., camping, cookouts). Operations typically last a continuous twenty-four hours, requiring scheduled relief operators to keep stations on the air. Additional contest points are awarded for experimenting with unusual modes, making contacts via satellite, and involving youth in the activity.

==International Field Day events==

Sponsored by the ARRL and RAC (but organized primarily by the ARRL), Field Day is open to all Amateur Radio operators covered by these two IARU member organizations.
====Brazil====
The Scout Movement in Brazil also participates in Scout Field Day with the participation of Amateur Radio Scouts during the second week of June. 
SCOUT FIELD DAY, like what happens around the world, takes young people to the countryside, squares, grounds and public places, other than Scout headquarters, so that they can assemble their equipment, if possible in a sustainable way, to work during a short time in emergency mode, safely, learning details and preparing to save or help save lives.
Scouts Field Day is a camp or excursion with the same preparations as any other scouting activity, however, with the use of radio stations, in VHF, UHF and HF, transmitting and receiving signals via phone and even telegraphy. 

Website: https://www.escoteiros.org.br/radioescotismo-2023/

===IARU Region 3===
There is currently no organized Field Day for all of Region 3, although there is a proposal to create one similar to that of Region 1: Recommendation WG 2-10 (page 7).

====Taiwan====
There is apparently a Biannual Field Day held in Taiwan, by the Chinese Taipei Amateur Radio League.

====New Zealand====
The New Zealand Association of Radio Transmitters (NZART) holds an HF National Field Day contest each February, and a VHF Field Day each December.

====Korea====
The Korean Amateur Radio League holds a field day for two to five days at a regional branch area during summer every year.

====Australia====
The Wireless Institute of Australia (WIA) holds the John Moyle Field Day in March every year.

==Emergency preparedness==
Field Day stresses emergency preparedness. Frequently, entire radio clubs get involved and assemble a portable radio station in a field or park. Some might use quickly deployable portable antennas while other might erect more elaborate radio masts and towers supporting several antennas. Generators or solar power provide electricity to amateur radio transceivers, which may be located in tents, cars, recreational vehicles, or other portable shelters.

==Contest activity and rules==
Officially, field day in the US is an operating event and not a contest. However, it operates exactly like a contest, but without awards.

The competitive aspect of a Field Day operating event is to contact as many stations as possible in the given time period (twenty-four hours, during a weekend, if setup commences before the contest starts, or 27 hours if setup commences at contest start time) using the portable station. Each station will information with other participating stations. For the North American Field Day, the exchange consists of the station call sign, the name of the ARRL-recognized section from which the station is operating, and a class designator which indicates the number of transmitters concurrently used at the station and information about the type of electrical power source being used.

The contest portion of Field Day has two purposes. The primary purpose is to test the group&#x27;s ability to plan operations that can be effective for an entire twenty-four-hour period, including operator endurance and adequate numbers of operators for a shift operation. The secondary portion is to demonstrate the technical proficiency of the station that has been hastily constructed for the purpose; in theory a better station will be capable of emergency operations in dire conditions. Such a station will also be capable of making more contacts during the contest portion of Field Day. Point systems are structured to motivate emergency preparedness activities, such as designating a safety officer for the station or incorporating auxiliary power capabilities.

The rules governing this activity are published by the sponsor of the particular Field Day exercise.

==Promotion of amateur radio==
Field Day is frequently used to attract significant publicity for amateur radio, and some clubs simultaneously demonstrate technologies including single sideband voice, Morse code (commonly called CW), digital modes (such as RTTY, PSK31, and Winlink, among others), and communication via amateur radio satellite.

<doc id="803859" wikidata="Q213794" url="?curid=803859" title="Gustav Struve">
<text>Gustav Struve, known as Gustav von Struve until he gave up his title (11 October 1805 – 21 August 1870), was a German surgeon, politician, lawyer and publicist, and a revolutionary during the German revolutions of 1848–1849 in Baden, Germany. He also spent over a decade in the United States and was active there as a reformer.

==Early years==
Struve was born in Munich the son of a Russian diplomat Johann Christoph Gustav von Struve, whose family came from the lesser nobility. His father Gustav, after whom he was named, had served as Russian Staff Councilor at the Russian Embassy in Warsaw, Munich and The Hague, and later was the Royal Russian Ambassador at the Badonian court in Karlsruhe. The younger Gustav Struve grew up and went to school in Munich, then studied law at universities in Göttingen and Heidelberg. For a short time (from 1829 to 1831) he was employed in the civil service in Oldenburg, then moved to Baden in 1833 where in 1836 he settled down to work as a lawyer in Mannheim.

In Baden, Struve also entered politics by standing up for the liberal members of the Baden parliament in news articles. His point of view headed more and more in a radical democratic, early socialist direction. As editor of the &quot;&quot;, he was repeatedly condemned to imprisonment. He was compelled in 1846 to retire from the management of this paper. In 1845, Struve married Amalie Düsar on 16 November 1845 and in 1847 he dropped the aristocratic &quot;von&quot; from his surname due to his democratic ideals.

He also gave attention to phrenology, and published three books on the subject.

==Pre-revolutionary period==
During &quot;Vormärz&quot;, the years between the Congress of Vienna in 1815 and the revolutions of 1848-49, Struve was strongly against the politics of Metternich, a strict Conservative and reactionary against the democratic movement who ruled Austria at the time and had a strong influence on restoration Germany with his Congress system.

==The revolution begins==
Along with Friedrich Hecker, whom he had met in Mannheim, Struve took on a leading role in the revolutions in Baden (see History of Baden) beginning with the Hecker Uprising, also accompanied by his wife Amalie. Both Hecker and Struve belonged to the radical democratic, anti-monarchist wing of the revolutionaries. In Baden their group was particularly strong in number, with many political societies being founded in the area.

When the revolution broke out, Struve published a demand for a federal republic, to include all Germany, but this was rejected by &quot;Pre-Parliament&quot; (&quot;Vorparlament&quot;), the meeting of politicians and other important German figures which later became the Frankfurt Parliament.

==Dreams of a federal Germany==
Struve wanted to spread his radical dreams for a federal Germany across the country, starting in southwest Germany, and accompanied by Hecker and other revolutionary leaders. They organised the meeting of a revolutionary assembly in Konstanz on 14 April 1848. From there, the &quot;Heckerzug&quot; (Hecker&#x27;s column) was to join up with another revolutionary group led by the poet Georg Herwegh and march to Karlsruhe. Few people joined in the march, however, and it was headed off in the Black Forest by troops from Frankfurt.

Hecker and Struve fled to Switzerland, where Struve continued to plan the struggle. He published &quot;Die Grundrechte des deutschen Volkes&quot; (The Basic Rights of the German People) and made a &quot;Plan for the Revolution and Republicanisation of Germany&quot; along with the revolutionary playwright and journalist Karl Heinzen. On 21 September 1848 he made another attempt to start an uprising in Germany, in Lörrach. Once again it failed, and this time Struve was caught and imprisoned.

==May Uprising in Baden==
Struve was freed during the May Uprising in Baden in 1849. Grand Duke Leopold of Baden fled and on 1 June 1849 Struve helped set up a provisionary republican parliament under the liberal politician Lorenz Brentano. Prince Wilhelm of Prussia, later to become Wilhelm I of Germany, set out for Baden with troops. Afraid of a military escalation, Brentano reacted hesitantly - too hesitantly for Struve and his followers, who overthrew him. The revolutionaries took up arms and, led by Ludwik Mieroslawski, tried to hold off the Prussian troops, who far outnumbered them. On 23 July the revolutionaries were defeated after a fierce battle at Rastatt and the revolution came to an end.

==Post-revolutionary life==
Gustav Struve, along with other revolutionaries, managed to escape execution, fleeing to exile, first in Switzerland and then in 1851 to the US.

In the USA, Struve lived for a time in Philadelphia. He edited &quot;Der Deutsche Zuschauer&quot; (The German Observer) in New York City, but soon discontinued its publication because of insufficient support. He wrote several novels and a drama in German, and then in 1852 undertook, with the assistance of his wife, the composition of a universal history from the standpoint of radical republicanism. The result, &quot;Weltgeschichte&quot; (World History), was published in 1860. It was the major literary product of his career and the result of 30 years of study. From 1858 to 1859, he edited &quot;Die Sociale Republik&quot;.

He also promoted German public schools in New York City. In 1856, he supported John Frémont for U.S. president. In 1860, he supported Abraham Lincoln.
At the start of the 1860s, Struve joined in the American Civil War in the Union Army, a captain under Blenker, and one of the many German emigrant soldiers known as the Forty-Eighters. He resigned a short time later to avoid serving under Blenker&#x27;s successor, the Prussian Prince Felix Salm-Salm. Struve was an abolitionist, and opposed plans to create a colony of freed slaves in Liberia because he thought it would hinder the abolition of slavery in the United States. 

==Return to Germany==
He never became naturalized since he felt his primary objective was to battle the despots of Europe. In 1863, a general amnesty was issued to all those who had been involved in the revolutions in Germany, and Struve returned to Germany. His first wife had died in Staten Island in 1862. Back in Germany, he married a Frau von Centener. Lincoln appointed him U. S. consul at Sonneberg in 1865, but the Thuringian states refused to issue his exequatur due to his radical writings. On 21 August 1870 he died in Vienna where he had settled in 1869.

==Vegetarianism==
Struve was a leading figure in the initial stage of the German vegetarian movement. He had become a vegetarian in 1832 under the influence of Rousseau&#x27;s treatise &quot;Émile&quot;.

Struve authored the first German vegetarian-themed novel, &quot;Mandaras Wanderungen&quot; in 1833. He founded the Vegetarische Gesellschaft Stuttgart (Stuttgart Vegetarian Society) in 1868. He wrote the vegetarian book &quot;Pflanzenkost&quot;, in 1869. Historian Corinna Treitel has noted that Struve linked &quot;vegetarianism to republican self governance.&quot;

<doc id="803864" wikidata="Q1707364" url="?curid=803864" title="Sitcom (film)">
<text>Sitcom is a 1998 French surrealistic satire film written and directed by François Ozon. The story documents the moral decline of a once esteemed suburban family, whose descent into degeneracy begins with the purchase of a small white rat.

The film&#x27;s name is a direct reference to American sitcoms, which are noted for their focus on traditional family values and whimsical humour.

==Plot==
The patriarch (François Marthouret) of a seemingly normal nuclear family returns home one day with a small white rat. The animal soon has an adverse effect on his wife (Évelyne Dandry) and children, influencing them into enacting their darkest, most hidden desires.

The son, Nicolas (Adrien de Van) loudly announces his homosexuality and begins throwing wild orgies, the daughter Sophie, (Marina de Van) deliberately flirts with death and practices sadomasochism on her boyfriend (Stéphane Rideau), while the mother seduces her son so she can &quot;cure&quot; him of his orientation. After the father eventually kills and devours the offending rat, he turns into one himself; when his family discover this, they band together and brutally slay him.

==Cast==
* Évelyne Dandry (billed as Evelyne Dandry) as The mother / La mère
* François Marthouret as The father / Le père
* Marina de Van as Sophie
* Adrien de Van as Nicolas
* Stéphane Rideau as David
* Lucia Sanchez as Maria
* Jules-Emmanuel Eyoum Deido as Abdu
* Jean Douchet as Psychotherapist / Le psychothérapeute
* Sébastien Charles as Boy with the zucchinis / Le garçon aux courgettes
* Vincent Vizioz as Guy with red hair / Le garçon aux cheveux rouges
* Kiwani Cojo as Pierced guy / Le garçon au piercing
* Gilles Frilay as Guy with mustache / L&#x27;homme moustachu
* Antoine Fischer as Gregory / Le petit garçon

==Possible influences==
* In John Schlesinger&#x27;s notorious film &quot;Midnight Cowboy&quot;, a mother and her son&#x27;s deeply concealed sexual frustrations surface after she produces a small, white rubber mouse.
* Another inspiration could be Pier Paolo Pasolini&#x27;s novel, and eventual film, &quot;Teorema&quot;, which depicts the arrival of a mysterious, unnamed stranger in the home of an upper-class Italian family. He systematically seduces every single member of the dysfunctional household, including the mother, who becomes nymphomaniac as a result, the father, the daughter, whom he leaves in a catatonic state, and the son, who subsequently realises his homosexuality and becomes an artist.

<text>Peter (or Pyotr or Petr) Berngardovich Struve (, ; – 22 February 1944) was a Russian political economist, philosopher, historian and editor. He started his career as a Marxist, later became a liberal and after the Bolshevik Revolution, joined the White movement. From 1920, he lived in exile in Paris, where he was a prominent critic of Russian communism.

==Biography==
===Marxist theoretician===
Peter Struve is probably the best known member of the Russian branch of the Struve family. Son of Bernhard Struve (Astrakhan and later Perm governor) and grandson of astronomer Friedrich Georg Wilhelm von Struve, he entered the Natural Sciences Department of the University of Saint Petersburg in 1889 and transferred to its law school in 1890. While there, he became interested in Marxism, attended Marxist and narodniki (populist) meetings (where he met his future opponent Vladimir Lenin) and wrote articles for legally published magazines—hence the term Legal Marxism, whose chief proponent he became. In September 1893 Struve was hired by the Finance Ministry and worked in its library, but was fired on 1 June 1894 after an arrest and a brief detention in April–May of that year. In 1894, he also published his first major book, &quot;Kriticheskie zametki k voprosu ob ekonomicheskom razvitii Rossii&quot; (&quot;Critical Notes on the Economic Development of Russia&quot;) in which he defended the applicability of Marxism to Russian conditions against populist critics.

In 1895, Struve finished his degree and wrote an &quot;Open letter to Nicholas II&quot; on behalf of the Zemstvo. He then went abroad for further studies, where he attended the 1896 International Socialist Congress in London and befriended famous Russian revolutionary exile Vera Zasulich.

After returning to Russia Struve became one of the editors of the successive Legal Marxist magazines &quot;Novoye Slovo&quot; (&quot;The New Word&quot;, 1897), &quot;Nachalo&quot; (&quot;The Beginning&quot;, 1899) and &quot;Zhizn&quot; (1899–1901). Struve was also the most popular speaker at the Legal Marxist debates at the Free Economic Society in the late 1890s—early 1900s in spite of his often impenetrable-to-laymen arguments and unkempt appearance. In 1898 Struve wrote the Manifesto of the newly formed Russian Social Democratic Labour Party. However, as he later explained:

:Socialism, to tell the truth, never aroused the slightest emotion in me, still less attraction... Socialism interested me mainly as an ideological force – which... could be directed either to the conquest of civil and political freedoms or against them

===Leaving Socialism===

By 1900, Struve had become a leader of the revisionist, i.e. compromising, wing of Russian Marxists. Struve and Mikhail Tugan-Baranovsky represented the moderates during the negotiations with Julius Martov, Alexander Potresov and Vladimir Lenin, the leaders of the party&#x27;s radical wing, in Pskov in March 1900. In late 1900, Struve went to Munich and again held lengthy talks with the radicals between December 1900 and February 1901. The two sides eventually reached a compromise which included making Struve the editor of &quot;Sovremennoe Obozrenie&quot; (&quot;Contemporary Review&quot;), a proposed supplement to the radicals&#x27; magazine &quot;Zaria&quot; (&quot;Dawn&quot;), in exchange for his help in securing financial support from Russian liberals. The plan was frustrated by Struve&#x27;s arrest at the famous Kazan Square demonstration on 4 March 1901 immediately upon his return to Russia. Struve was banished from the capital and, like other demonstrators, was offered to choose his own place of exile. He chose Tver, a center of Zemstvo radicalism.

In 1902 Struve secretly left Tver and went abroad, but by then the radicals had abandoned the idea of a joint magazine and Struve&#x27;s further evolution from socialism to liberalism would have made collaboration difficult anyway. Instead he founded an independent liberal semi-monthly magazine &quot;Osvobozhdenie&quot; (&quot;Liberation&quot;) with the help of liberal intelligentsia and the radical part of Zemstvo. The magazine was financed by D. E. Zhukovsky and was at first published in Stuttgart, Germany (1 July 1902 – 15 October 1904). In mid-1903, after the founding of the liberal &quot;Soyuz Osvobozhdeniya&quot; (&quot;Union of Liberation&quot;), the magazine became the Union&#x27;s official organ and was smuggled into Russia, where it enjoyed considerable success. When German police, under pressure from Okhrana, raided the premises in October 1904, Struve moved his operations to Paris and continued publishing the magazine for another year (15 October 1904 – 18 October 1905) until the October Manifesto proclaimed freedom of the press in Russia.

===Liberal Politician===

In October 1905 Struve returned to Russia, and became a co-founder of the liberal Constitutional Democratic party and a member of its Central Committee. In 1907 he represented the party in the Second State Duma.

After the Duma&#x27;s dissolution on 3 June 1907, Struve concentrated on his work at &quot;Russkaya Mysl&quot; (&quot;Russian Thought&quot;), a leading liberal newspaper, of which he had been publisher and de facto editor-in-chief since 1906.

Struve was the driving force behind &quot;Vekhi&quot; (&quot;Milestones&quot;, 1909), a groundbreaking and controversial anthology of essays critical of the intelligentsia and its rationalistic and radical traditions. As &quot;Russkaya Mysl&quot; editor, Struve rejected Andrey Bely&#x27;s seminal novel &quot;Petersburg&quot;, which he apparently saw as a parody of revolutionary intellectuals.

With the outbreak of World War I in 1914 Struve adopted a position of support for the government, and in 1916 he resigned from the Constitutional Democratic party&#x27;s Central Committee over what he saw as the party&#x27;s excessive opposition to the government in a time of war.

===Opponent of Bolshevism===
In May 1917, after the February Revolution of 1917 overthrew monarchy in Russia, Struve was elected as member of the Russian Academy of Sciences, until he was excluded by the Bolshevik-engineered expulsion of 1918.

Immediately after the October Revolution of 1917, Struve went to the South of Russia where he joined the Volunteer Army&#x27;s Council.

In early 1918 he returned to Moscow, where he lived under an assumed name for most of the year, contributed to &quot;Iz Glubiny&quot; (variously translated as &quot;De Profundis&quot;, &quot;From the Deep&quot; or &quot;From the Depths&quot;, 1918), a follow-up to &quot;Vekhi&quot;, and published several other notable articles on the causes of the revolution.

With the Russian Civil War raging and his life in danger Struve had to flee; and after a three-month journey arrived in Finland, where he negotiated with general Nikolai Yudenich and the Finnish leader Carl Gustaf Emil Mannerheim before leaving for Western Europe. Struve represented general Anton Denikin&#x27;s anti-Bolshevik government in Paris and London in 1919, before returning to Denikin-controlled territories in the South of Russia, where he edited a leading newspaper of the White Movement. With Denikin&#x27;s resignation after the Novorossisk debacle and general Pyotr Wrangel&#x27;s rise to the top in early 1920, Struve became foreign minister in Wrangel&#x27;s government.

With the defeat of Wrangel&#x27;s army in November 1920 Struve left for Bulgaria, where he relaunched &quot;Russkaya Mysl&quot; under the aegis of the emigre &quot;Russko-Bolgarskoe knigoizdatel&#x27;stvo&quot; publishing house. Then Struve left for Paris, where he remained until his death in 1944.In Bulgaria, Struve left many followers in the field of economics, especially his students, who emigrated and took academic positions at Bulgarian universities (the most famous of which are Simeon Demostenov and Naum Dolinski).

His children were prominent in the Russian Orthodox Church Outside of Russia.

==Personal life==
===Religion===
Struve&#x27;s father was Russian Orthodox while his mother was Lutheran. During his Marxist years Struve was a religious skeptic. Afterwards, he returned to Orthodoxy, maintaining a strongly individualistic view that was close to Protestantism.

===Descendants===
Peter Struve&#x27;s son Gleb Struve (1898–1985) was one of the most prominent Russian critics of the 20th century. He taught at the University of California, Berkeley and befriended Vladimir Nabokov in the 1920s.

Pyotr&#x27;s grandson, Nikita Struve (1931–2016), was a professor at a Paris university and an editor of several Russian-language periodicals published in Europe.

==Legacy==
Historian Bernard Pares said Struve was one Europe&#x27;s most powerful thinkers. Harold Williams called him the greatest intellect he had ever met.

<text>George Ledwell Taylor (31 March 1788 – 1 May 1873) was an architect and landowner who lived in London.

==Life==
Taylor was born on 31 March 1788 and educated at Rawes&#x27;s academy, Bromley. He became a pupil of the architect James Burton, and on Burton&#x27;s retirement, of Joseph Parkinson, who was then engaged in laying out the Portman estate. While articled to Parkinson, Taylor superintended the building of Montagu and Bryanston Squares (1811), and the neighbouring streets.

In 1816 went on two walking tours of England with his fellow-pupil Edward Cresy. In 1817 he and Cresy set off on a grand tour, visiting France, Switzerland and Italy, before spending a summer in Greece. At Pisa, they made a detailed survey of the Campo Santo and the Leaning Tower; later publishing the drawings in a volume called &quot;Architecture of the Middle Ages in Italy&quot; (1829). On their return to England, Taylor and Cresy set up an office in Furnival&#x27;s Inn. Taylor lived at 52 Bedford Square and, afterwards in Spring Gardens, later moving to a villa at Lee Terrace, Blackheath, one of a group of four he had designed himself.

On 8 June 1820 he married Bella Neufville, by whom he had eleven children.

==Naval Department==

In 1824 he was appointed surveyor of buildings to the naval department. In this capacity he superintended important works in the dockyards at Chatham, Woolwich, and Sheerness, and alterations to the Clarence victualling yard at Gosport. His work at Sheerness include the neoclassical Royal Dockyard Church of 1828. The works he carried out at Chatham included the construction of the Melville Hospital (1827) and the underpinning with concrete of the Long Storehouse, which had been destabilised by decay of the timbers which served as its foundations. He presented a paper on the subject of this “experimental system of undersetting” at a meeting of the Institute of British Architects in 1836. At Woolwich, he built the river wall (1831).

==Private practice==
In 1837 a programme of budget cuts at the Admiralty led to Taylor&#x27;s dismissal. He took up general practice, and qualified as a district surveyor. In 1838 he began the spectacular Gothick tower at Hadlow Castle, a late eighteenth century house in Kent. The tower was based in part on James Wyatt&#x27;s at Fonthill Abbey. It was built of brick rendered in Roman cement to imitate stone, the finer architectural detail built up with the cement. He had previously used the Gothick style at a church in Walham Green, Fulham in 1827-8.

He designed, and developed, as flats, the block of buildings on the east side of Trafalgar Square which later became Morley&#x27;s Hotel. He received some attention from William IV, and claimed to have persuaded the king that the new open space at Charing Cross should be called &quot;Trafalgar Square&quot; rather than ‘King William the Fourth Square&quot;, as originally proposed.

In 1843–8 he laid out large parts of the Bishop of London&#x27;s estate, Westbourne Terrace (where he built a house for himself), Chester Place, and parts of Hyde Park Square and Gloucester Square. Around 1851, Taylor designed William Batty&#x27;s Grand National Hippodrome, also known as Batty&#x27;s Hippodrome, a 14,000 person open-air arena near Kensington Gardens and the Crystal Palace Exhibition.

Taylor was the architect and joint surveyor to the Regent&#x27;s Canal Railway Company, which, in 1845, proposed to fill in the Regent&#x27;s Canal between Paddington and Limehouse and use its route for a railway. In 1849 he undertook the continuation of the North Kent railway from Stroud, through Chatham, and Canterbury to Dover, but the negotiations fell through, at a personal loss to Taylor of £3,000.

After this he abandoned architecture for archæology. In 1856 he revisited Italy with his wife, and stayed at Rome from November 1857 to March 1858, collecting materials for &quot; The Stones of Etruria and Marbles of Antient Rome&quot;, which he published in 1859. He finally returned to England in 1868, and in 1870–2 published a collection of sketches and descriptions of buildings which he had visited during his travels, under the title of &quot;The Auto-Biography of an Octogenarian Architect&quot;.

Taylor died at Broadstairs on 1 May 1873.

<text>Alexander Hugh Holmes Stuart (April 2, 1807 – February 13, 1891) was a Virginia lawyer and American political figure associated with several political parties. Stuart served in both houses of the Virginia General Assembly (1836–1838, 1857–1861 and 1874–1877), as a U.S. Congressman (1841–1843), and as the Secretary of the Interior (1850–1853). Despite opposing Virginia&#x27;s secession and holding no office after finishing his term in the Virginia Senate during the American Civil War, after the war he was denied a seat in Congress. Stuart led the Committee of Nine, which attempted to reverse the changes brought by Reconstruction. He also served as rector of the University of Virginia.

==Early years==
Stuart was born in Staunton, Virginia, one of three sons of judge Archibald Stuart, a protege of Thomas Jefferson, and his wife Eleanor (&quot;nee&quot; Briscoe).

After education by private tutors, Stuart attended the College of William and Mary. He studied law under John Tayloe Lomax and graduated from the University of Virginia in Charlottesville before marrying his cousin Frances Cornelia Baldwin in 1833. They had six daughters and three sons.

==Career==
Stuart was admitted to the Virginia bar in 1828 and soon became active in the National Republican Party. He supported the unsuccessful campaign of Henry Clay in the 1832 U.S. Presidential Election.

===Delegate and Congressman===
Augusta County voters first elected Stuart as one of two men representing them in the Virginia House of Delegates in 1836. Re-elected twice as a Whig to what were then single-year terms (and a position which is still part-time), Stuart served on the Committee for Courts of Justice and also advocated internal improvements (the James River Canal as well as railroads). Although recommendations in his critical report concerning deficiencies in such improvements were not adopted, during 1838 Stuart became a junior member of the Committee on Roads and Internal Navigation.
In 1840 Stuart won election as a Whig to the 27th Congress, as the incumbent Jacksonian Democrat Robert Craig declined to run for re-election. He defeated Democrat and future Virginia governor James McDowell in that election. Stuart served on the committee concerning the Navy Department, and beginning in February 1842 on the Committee on Foreign Affairs. He was one of only two Southern representatives to support former President John Quincy Adams when Adams proposed to end the rule forbidding petitions against slavery. After President William Henry Harrison&#x27;s death, Stuart criticized the new President, fellow Virginian John Tyler for opposing a new national bank, and also supported a tariff to protect American (and Virginia) manufacturers. In 1843, post-census redistricting combined his district with Virginia&#x27;s 11th congressional district held by John Minor Botts; Democrat William Taylor defeated Stuart and won election to the 28th Congress. However, Stuart continued politically active, serving as a presidential elector for the Whig ticket in both 1844 (when it lost) and 1848 (when it won).

Stuart also resumed his legal practice full time. Beginning in 1849, he was one of the attorneys defending the new Wheeling Suspension Bridge, following a lawsuit in the United States Supreme Court brought by Edwin M. Stanton and Cornelius Darragh on behalf of the State of Pennsylvania and Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania interests that complained about obstruction of the Ohio River.

From 1850, Stuart served as United States Secretary of the Interior under new President Millard Fillmore for three years. That Department had been founded on the suggestion of one of his fellow counsel in the Wheeling Bridge case, and neither of his predecessors had lasted long. The department which consolidated the United States General Land Office, the Office of Indian Affairs, and the U.S. Patent Office also worked to resolve the boundary with Mexico. Stuart didn&#x27;t change the culture of political patronage, but at least gave rules and standards to the political appointments and removed some of the administrative chaos until resigning as President Fillmore&#x27;s term ended in 1853.

As the Whig Party disintegrated in 1852, Stuart declined to become its candidate in the U.S. Senate. Instead, he aligned himself with the nativist Know Nothing Party, which some criticized as secretly working against slavery. When Virginia&#x27;s Democratic governor Henry A. Wise criticized the Know Nothings, Stuart (as &quot;Madison&quot;) published twelve long letters on the &quot;American Question&quot; in the &quot;Richmond Whig and Public Advertiser&quot; and later as a combined pamphlet. Neither endorsing nor opposing slavery, Stuart praised American Party&#x27;s proposals to deny some immigrants rights accorded native-born Americans.

===Prelude to secession===
Later that year, Augusta County voters again elected Stuart to the Virginia General Assembly, this time to the Virginia Senate, where he served from 1857 through 1861. He was the senior senator on the committee to investigate John Brown&#x27;s Raid against the arsenal in Harper&#x27;s Ferry (then still in Virginia) in October 1859. The committee&#x27;s report condemned abolitionist agitation, and recommended strengthening local militia units, as well as achieving commercial independence from the North by encouraging Virginia&#x27;s domestic manufactures.

By 1860, Stuart owned nine enslaved persons. At a speech before the Central Agricultural Society of Virginia, Stuart fully accepted slavery as in the best interest of Southern agricultural prosperity and argued it benefited the Northern economy as well as that emancipation would lead to violence.

In the 1860 U.S. Presidential Election, Stuart supported the Constitutional Union Party and its candidate, John Bell (a former Whig who had represented Tennessee in the U.S. Congress). Bell won a majority of Virginia votes, although he ultimately received fewer votes than either major party candidate. As the United States divided into two hostile camps after President Abraham Lincoln&#x27;s election, seven lower Southern states began establishing the Confederacy beginning in December 1860. Augusta County voter elected Unionists Stuart, John Brown Baldwin (his brother-in-law) and George Baylor to represent them in the Virginia Secession Convention of 1861. He voted with the anti-secession majority on the initial vote on April 4. Stuart, William B. Preston and George W. Randolph as a special Virginia delegation traveled to Washington, D.C., and met President Lincoln on April 12 after the surrender of Fort Sumter. Finding Lincoln firm in his resolve to hold the federal forts in the South, the three men returned to Richmond, Virginia on April 15. Two days later, the secession resolution again came before the convention. All three Augusta County delegates again voted against it, but it passed and was ratified by voters. On June 14, 1861, Stuart was among those signing the ceremonial secession ordinance. Stuart then proposed amendments to Virginia&#x27;s Constitution of 1851, which he thought too democratic. Stuart blamed unrestrained democratic practices in free states for Lincoln&#x27;s election and also criticized the North&#x27;s free public schools. However, Virginia voters, on March 13, 1862, rejected the committee&#x27;s proposal, which would have removed the popular election of the governor and reorganized the judiciary.

===American Civil War===
After Virginia seceded, Stuart declined to hold any Confederate or Virginia office after his state senate term ended, and he did not support the Wheeling Convention, which ultimately led to the creation of West Virginia. However, he supported relief for Virginia&#x27;s soldiers. Furthermore, two relatives served as Confederate generals: his brother-in-law John Brown Baldwin and his cousin, J. E. B. Stuart. A. H. H. Stuart also specifically declined appointment to a peace commission in March 1864.

===Post-war===
About a month after Virginia&#x27;s surrender at Appomattox Courthouse, on May 8, 1865, Stuart chaired a mass meeting in Staunton, which adopted resolutions asking the U.S. Army&#x27;s protection and declaring the populace not in rebellion. Stuart also took oaths of allegiance to the United States and to the loyal government of Virginia. Because he had never held Confederate office, Stuart was eligible for election and was again elected U.S. Representative in 1865. However, despite presenting credentials as a member-elect to the 39th Congress in 1865, he was denied a seat as were other newly-elected Southern delegates, because Virginia was not yet readmitted to the Union, pending its adoption of a new state constitution outlawing slavery, among other measures.

As the University of Virginia commencement speaker in June 1866, Stuart lamented the end of Old Virginia. He also opposed Congressional Reconstruction. In 1866, Stuart was a delegate to the National Convention of Conservatives at Philadelphia. In 1867, Stuart criticized the Virginia Constitutional Convention of 1868, which was elected with universal suffrage and included black delegates. Shortly after it convened, Stuart became chairman of the Committee of Nine, which lobbied the new president Ulysses S. Grant, and managed to secure separate votes for the new state constitution, which passed overwhelmingly, and anti-Confederate measures, which failed. Thus, Virginia was restored to the Union in 1870. Augusta County voters again elected Stuart to represent them in the Virginia General Assembly in 1873, and he served on the Committee on Finance. His re-election was contested, but he won the second vote and served from 1874 to 1877.

Stuart also served as rector of the University of Virginia from 1874 to 1882 and from 1886 to 1887, during which he came to accept public education but realized the funding problems (the institution received no funding from 1882 to 1884, and all its officers were forced out). He also served as president of the Virginia Historical Society from 1881 to his death, published a booklet concerning the Committee of Nine at its request, and continued his legal practice.

==Death and legacy==
Stuart died at his home in Staunton in 1891 (six years following his wife&#x27;s death). His papers are held by the Virginia Historical Society and the University of Virginia, which has made some available online. He was the last surviving member of Fillmore&#x27;s cabinet.

His son in law, John M. P. Atkinson (husband of Frances Peyton Stuart) was the tenth president of Hampden–Sydney College from 1857 to 1883.

His home at Staunton, the Stuart House, was added to the National Register of Historic Places in 1972.

<text>Hawaiiloa (alt. Hawaii Loa or Ke Kowa i Hawaii) is a mythical Hawaiian fisherman and navigator who is said to have discovered the island of Hawaii.

==Legend==

Hawaiiloa was an expert fisherman and navigator who was famous for his lengthy fishing expeditions. While on a prolonged voyage, his principal navigator, Makalii, asked Hawaiiloa to steer eastward towards Aldebaran (Hokuula, meaning &quot;red star&quot;) and the Pleiades (near the Cluster of Makalii). After sailing in this direction, he and his crew stumbled upon the island of Hawaii, which was named in Hawaiiloa&#x27;s honor. Hawaiiloa returned to his homeland, &quot;Ka āina kai melemele a Kāne&quot; (&quot;the land of the yellow sea of Kāne&quot;), to bring his family back with him to Hawaii. He then organized a colonizing expedition with his family and eight other skilled navigators. They settled on what is now the Island of Hawaii, named in his honor.

The legend contains reference to his children: Māui (his eldest son), Kauai (son), and Oahu (daughter) who settled on the islands that bear their names.

===Historical accuracy===
The Hawaiiloa legend is popular amongst Hawaiians as a realistic Hawaiian origin story that is consistent with modern anthropological and historical beliefs.

However, there is currently little evidence to support its historical accuracy. The story is attested only by 19th-century sources such as Abraham Fornander and Thomas George Thrum, neither of whom provided their sources.

Hawaiiloa is also unmentioned by earlier Hawaiian historians such as David Malo. Malo chronicled many Hawaiian origin stories, migration tales, and legends of indigenous origin. Samuel Kamakau tells of an alternate legend that the first man (Kumu-Honua) and woman (Lalo-Honua) were created on Oahu.

==Canoe==

&quot;Hawaiiloa&quot; is also the name of a voyaging canoe, built between 1991 and 1994. Named after the legendary navigator, the canoe was built for ocean navigation and has sailed internationally. The canoe &quot;Hawaiiloa&quot; is now docked at Honolulu Harbor. It is often sailed on long voyages throughout the Pacific Ocean, studying voyaging techniques used in Ancient Hawaii.

===Building===
To make the canoe, two Sitka spruce logs were brought to Hawaii from Southeast Alaska, donated by the SeAlaska Corporation (owned by the Tlingit, Haida, and Tshimshian tribes). These came from 400-year-old, 200 feet high trees, a size which could not be found in modern Hawaii. The hulls of the canoe were designed by Rudy and Barry Choy and Dick Rhodes, and also used numerous woods from more local sources. The canoe was made without metal parts, and used three miles of lashing.

&quot;Hawaiiloa&quot; is long, with a beam of . She has two sails, each of . She was initially launched in July 1993, and subsequently modified in dry dock before being re-launched a year later.

===Voyages in 1995===
In 1995, &quot;Hawaiiloa&quot; sailed her maiden voyage to Tahiti, Raiatea, and Nuku Hiva in the Marquesas Islands in company with &quot;Hōkūlea&quot; and a third canoe from Hawaii called &quot;Makalii&quot; together with two canoes from Rarotonga: &quot;Te Au Tonga&quot; and &quot;Takitumu&quot;, and the canoe &quot;Te Aurere&quot;, from New Zealand. Subsequently that year, &quot;Hawaiiloa&quot; was shipped to Seattle and then sailed north to Alaska, visiting twenty native villages on the coastal journey between Vancouver and Juneau.

<doc id="803876" wikidata="Q374737" url="?curid=803876" title="Edwin Sydney Stuart">
<text>Edwin Sydney Stuart (December 28, 1853 – March 21, 1937) was an American politician who served as the Mayor of Philadelphia from 1891 to 1895 and as the 24th governor of Pennsylvania from 1907 to 1911.

==Early life and Philadelphia politics==

Stuart was born in Philadelphia in 1853. At age 13, he ended his formal schooling and took a job as a bookkeeper for the book wholesaler W.A. Leary. He rose to attain a controlling interest in the company. By 1882, Stuart had become president of the state Republican Party. In 1886, he won a seat on Philadelphia City Council.

In 1891, Stuart successfully ran for Mayor of Philadelphia. He quickly gained a reputation as a no-nonsense official who would take a hardline approach against corruption. He uncovered impropriety within the city treasurer&#x27;s office, resulting in the arrest of Treasurer John Bardsley, and a complete overhaul in budgetary control procedures. He also fired the public safety director for accepting bribes and won a hard-fought battle with the private streetcar lines that forced these entities to help defray the cost of street paving. Upon completion of his mayoral term in 1896, he won an election to return to city council.

==Governor of Pennsylvania==

Stuart was known as &quot;The Governor Who Cares&quot; following his investigation of scandals involving the building of the Pennsylvania capitol. The investigation resulted in the prosecution and conviction of four individuals. At that time, the Governor became known as a sharp-eyed overseer of the public good, and had a habit of involving himself in the operations of many state agencies. His reforms included concentrating power in the executive office and abolishing a number of redundant state boards and commissions, replacing them with a single official who was held responsible for results. The &quot;Philadelphia Bulletin&quot; supported the Governor&#x27;s reform efforts stating,
There has probably never been a governor of Pennsylvania who has employed the veto power so extensively in dealing with the bills of a single legislative session as Governor Stuart has in the past thirty days. He has prevented scores of crude, ill-considered ... bills from becoming laws and he has reduced the improvident appropriation to the extent of more than twenty million dollars.

In the midst of all the vetoing it has been difficult for any one to challenge the justice of the governor&#x27;s judgement. Every veto has rested on a sound reason in the public interest.
Among the bills he vetoed was one for the building of a statewide system of state roads, a cause he supported but chose to sacrifice for fiscal prudence and accountability. Stuart was, however, able to achieve several of his central legislative priorities. He secured labor laws that restricted children under age 14 from working in heavy industry. He also improved oversight of the healthcare field and authorized the construction of the Mont Alto Sanitorium to treat tuberculous patients.

Stuart Hall on the campus of Penn State University is named in honor of Governor Stuart.

He is buried at West Laurel Hill Cemetery, Bala Cynwyd, Pennsylvania.

==Legacy==

In 1893 Philadelphia launched a fireboat named after Stuart.

<doc id="803885" wikidata="Q729577" url="?curid=803885" title="Italy in the Eurovision Song Contest">
<text>Italy has participated in the Eurovision Song Contest 49 times since making its debut as one of only seven countries to compete at the first contest in , which took inspiration from the Sanremo Music Festival. The Italian participant broadcaster in the contest is (RAI). It competed at the contest without interruption until , discontinuing its participation on a number of occasions during the 1980s and 1990s. After a 13-year absence starting in , the country returned to the contest in . Italy has won the contest three times, along with an additional 16 top-five finishes. Italy hosted the contest in Naples (), Rome (), and Turin ().

In , &quot; performed by Domenico Modugno finished third. Commonly known as &quot;, the song became a huge international hit, topping the US &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100 and winning two Grammy Awards at its first edition. &quot; by Emilio Pericoli also finished third in , before Italy won for the first time in with &quot; by Gigliola Cinquetti. Cinquetti returned to the contest in and finished second with &quot;&quot;, losing to &quot;Waterloo&quot; by ABBA. Italy then finished third in 1975 with &quot; by Wess and Dori Ghezzi. The country&#x27;s best result of the 1980s was &quot; by Umberto Tozzi and Raf finishing third in . Italy&#x27;s second victory in the contest came in with &quot; by Toto Cutugno. Other good 1990s results were &quot; by Mia Martini in and &quot;&quot; by Jalisse in , which both finished fourth. After 1997, Italy withdrew from the competition.

On 31 December 2010, the European Broadcasting Union (EBU) announced that Italy would be returning to the contest as part of the &quot;Big Five&quot;, thereby granting the country automatic qualification for the final. Italy&#x27;s return to the contest has proved to be successful, finishing in the top ten in 11 of the last 13 contests (2011–24), including second places for &quot;Madness of Love&quot; by Raphael Gualazzi () and &quot; by Mahmood (), and third place for &quot; by Il Volo (). &quot;Grande amore&quot; won the televote, receiving votes from all countries, but came sixth with the juries. This was the first time since the introduction of the mixed jury/televote system in 2009 that the televote winner did not end up winning the contest. Italy achieved its third victory in the contest in , with &quot;Zitti e buoni&quot; by the rock band Måneskin.

==History==
 (RAI) is a full member of the European Broadcasting Union (EBU), thus eligible to participate in the Eurovision Song Contest. It has participated in the contest representing Italy since its in 1956.

=== Absences ===
Italy has withdrawn from the Eurovision Song Contest a number of times. The first withdrawal was in , when RAI stated that interest had diminished in the country. This absence continued through , before Italy returned in . Italy again withdrew in when RAI decided not to enter the contest.
From to , Italy withdrew again, with RAI citing a lack of interest in participating. Italy returned in , before withdrawing again without explanation, and the country did not participate again until .

None of the 20th century Eurovision-winning songs were particularly successful in the Italian charts. &quot;Non ho l&#x27;età&quot; by Gigliola Cinquetti was a hit in February 1964 when the song won the 1964 contest, but according to the official &quot;Hit Parade Italia&quot; website, &quot;Waterloo&quot;, &quot;Ding-a-dong&quot;, &quot;Puppet on a String&quot;, &quot;Save Your Kisses for Me&quot; and even Italy&#x27;s own winning entry of 1990, &quot;&quot;, all failed to enter the top ten of the records sales charts. A notable exception to this rule was the 1984 entry &quot;I treni di Tozeur&quot; by Alice and Franco Battiato, which shared fifth place in the final, but still became a #3 hit in Italy and also placed at #20 on the chart of the best-selling Italian singles in 1984.

=== TV censorship of the 1974 contest ===
RAI refused to broadcast the live because their competing song, sung by Gigliola Cinquetti, coincided with the intense political campaigning for the 1974 Italian divorce referendum which was to be held a month later in May. Despite the Eurovision Song Contest taking place more than a month before the planned vote, Italian censors refused to allow the contest and song to be shown or heard. RAI censors felt that the song, titled &quot;Sì&quot; (&quot;Yes&quot;), and contained lyrics constantly repeating the aforementioned word could be subject to accusation of being subliminal messaging and a form of propaganda to influence the Italian voting public to vote &#x27;yes&#x27; in the referendum (thus to repeal the law that allowed divorce). The song thus remained censored on most Italian state TV and radio stations for over a month. At the contest in Brighton, Cinquetti finished second, losing to ABBA. &quot;Sì&quot; went on to be a UK top ten hit, peaking at number eight. It also reached the German top 20. The contest was broadcast in June.

=== The 2008–2010 period ===
In 2008, two notable Italian musicians, Vince Tempera (who was the conductor for Malta in 1975 and had helped San Marino take part in the ESC in 2008) and Eurovision winner Toto Cutugno expressed their sorrow at Italy&#x27;s non-participation and called for the country to return to the contest.

Contestants from the , starting with the winner Dima Bilan appeared on the Italian show &quot;Carramba! Che fortuna&quot;, hosted by Raffaella Carrà on Rai Uno. Whether this was an initiative by Carrà (who presented three shows in TVE concerning the event) to try to bring Eurovision back to Italy is not clear, but Sietse Bakker, then-Manager Communications &amp; PR of the Eurovision Song Contest, reiterated that &quot;Italy is still very much welcome to take part in the competition.&quot;

Shortly after revealing the list of participants for the , the EBU announced that they would work harder to bring Italy back into the contest, along with former participants Monaco and Austria.

=== Return (2011–present) ===
At a press conference presenting the fourth edition of the Italian &quot;X Factor&quot;, Rai 2 director Massimo Liofredi announced that the winner of the competition might advance to represent Italy in the Eurovision Song Contest, rather than participate in the Sanremo Festival, as in previous years. On 2 December 2010, it was officially announced by the EBU that Italy had applied to compete in the 2011 contest. Their participation was further confirmed on 31 December with the announcement of the official participant list.

Italy&#x27;s return to the contest after a 13-year absence has been successful, finishing in the top ten in 11 of the last 13 contests (2011–24). In 2011, Raphael Gualazzi finished second, then Italy&#x27;s best result since 1990. Italy came first with the jury vote, but only 11th in the televote to place second overall behind eventual winner Azerbaijan. Nina Zilli in 2012 and Marco Mengoni in 2013 placed in the top ten (ninth and seventh, respectively); the latter scored 126 points, exactly doubling the points total of the other &quot;Big Five&quot; countries that year. This trend had a stop in 2014, when internally-selected Emma Marrone finished in 21st place. In 2015, Il Volo finished third with 292 points, behind winner Sweden and runner-up Russia, placing first in the televote but sixth in the jury vote. Since the introduction of the 50/50 split voting system, this was the first time that the televote winner did not win the contest overall. Francesca Michielin, selected among the competitors of Sanremo 2016 after the waiver of the winners Stadio, ended in 16th place. Francesco Gabbani came in sixth place in 2017. The year after, although not initially a big favourite with the bookmakers, Ermal Meta and Fabrizio Moro returned Italy to the top five, aided significantly by finishing third in the televote, which heavily counterbalanced the 17th place by the jury, finishing fifth overall. In 2019, Mahmood placed second with 472 points, Italy&#x27;s best result since 2011, until Måneskin won the contest in 2021 with 524 points. Måneskin&#x27;s victory marked the band&#x27;s breakthrough on the international music scene. Mahmood returned in 2022 as the host entrant alongside Blanco, placing sixth, followed by Mengoni returning in 2023, placing fourth, and Angelina Mango finishing in seventh place in 2024.

== Sanremo Music Festival ==

The Sanremo Music Festival is the most popular Italian song contest and awards ceremony, held annually in the city of Sanremo, Liguria. First held in 1951 and itself the basis and inspiration for the Eurovision Song Contest, the festival has often been used as a method of choosing the Italian entry for the European contest, with some exceptions over the years. Since 2015, the winner of the festival has been given the right of first refusal to represent Italy in the contest.

== Italy and the &quot;Big Five&quot; ==
Since 1999, four countries – , , , and the – have automatically qualified for the Eurovision final regardless of their results in previous contests. The participant broadcasters from these countries earned this special status by being the four biggest financial contributors to the EBU, and subsequently became known as the &quot;Big Four&quot;. In a meeting with OGAE Serbia in 2007, then-executive supervisor of the contest Svante Stockselius stated that, if Italy were to return to the contest in the future, the country would also automatically qualify for the final, becoming part of a &quot;Big Five&quot;. However, with the official announcement of the return of Italy, it was not confirmed whether the country would compete in one of the two semi-finals or be part of the &quot;Big Five&quot;, as RAI, third largest contributor to the EBU, had not applied for &quot;Big Five&quot; membership. On 31 December 2010, it was announced that Italy would take part in the and confirmed that the country would automatically qualify for the final as part of the &quot;Big Five&quot;.

Italy is currently the most successful Big Five country in the Eurovision Song Contest following the introduction of the rule, finishing in the top ten in 11 of the last 13 contests (2011–24), including a victory for Måneskin (), second places for Raphael Gualazzi () and Mahmood (), and third place for Il Volo (). It is one of the only two countries of the Big Five – since it was introduced – to have won, the other being Germany in .

<doc id="803888" wikidata="Q5581" url="?curid=803888" title="Vittore Carpaccio">
<text>Vittore Carpaccio (UK: , US: , Italian: ; born between 1460 and 1465, died ) was an Italian painter of the Venetian school who studied under Gentile Bellini. Carpaccio was largely influenced by the style of the early Italian Renaissance painter Antonello da Messina (), as well as Early Netherlandish painting. Although often compared to his mentor Gentile Bellini, Vittore Carpaccio&#x27;s command of perspective, precise attention to architectural detail, themes of death, and use of bold color differentiated him from other Italian Renaissance artists. Many of his works display the religious themes and cross-cultural elements of art at the time; his portrayal of &quot;Saint Augustine in His Study&quot; from 1502, reflects the popularity of collecting &quot;exotic&quot; and highly desired objects from different cultures.

Carpaccio&#x27;s works ranged from single pieces painted on canvas to altarpieces and large pictorial cycles. Several of the altarpieces, including &quot;St. Thomas Aquinas Enthroned&quot; (1507), &quot;Presentation of Christ in the Temple&quot; (1510), and &quot;Martyrdom of the Ten Thousand&quot; (1515), were commissioned by churches in Venice, while the pieces following the year 1510 were primarily commissioned by individual patrons in Venice. One of his largest pictorial series, &quot;The Legend of Saint Ursula&quot;, was begun in 1490. 

He is perhaps known best for his large urban scenes, such as the &quot;Miracle of the Relic of the Cross at the Ponte di Rialto&quot;. This work offers some of the best impressions of Venice at the height of its power and wealth, illustrating the strong sense of civic pride among its citizens. In other paintings he demonstrates a sense of fantasy that seems to look back to medieval romance, rather than sharing in the pastoral vision of the next generation. 

By about 1510 Carpaccio&#x27;s style was perceived by contemporaries as too conservative, showing little influence from the Humanist trends that transformed Italian Renaissance painting during his lifetime. Scholarship in English dedicated to his biography and works remains meager when compared with the scholarship about his Venetian contemporaries, such as Giovanni Bellini or Giorgione.

== Early life and works==
Carpaccio was born in Venice (between 1460 and 1465), the son of Pietro Scarpaza, a Venetian furrier in the parish of Arcangelo Raffaele. Although Carpaccio&#x27;s precise date of birth remains unknown, various documents have offered clues in order to narrow it down to a particular span of years. In a will from 1472, his uncle Fra Ilario listed him as an inheritor. According to Venetian customs, this would have indicated that he was at least 15 at this time, suggesting a birth year before 1457. However, a closer examination of Venetian law by scholars led to the discovery that children could be regarded as &quot;future&quot; heirs, thus Carpaccio&#x27;s birth year range was raised to to 1465. Another document revealed that Carpaccio continued to live with his father through 1486, signifying late adolescence by this time and confirming this later range of birth years. Peter Humfrey presents the various bits of evidence that scholars have used in order to determine Carpaccio&#x27;s birth years, as well as the dates of his earliest works, and in turn in which workshop he trained in Venice. Ultimately, the most recent research argues for a birth date between 1460 and 1465; he died around 1525 or 1526.

Carpaccio (or Scarpaza, Scarpazza or Scarpanza or Scarpanzo, as the name was variously recorded in the Venetian dialect) came from a family originally from Mazzorbo, an island in the diocese of Torcello. Archival documents trace the family back to at least the thirteenth century, and its members were diffused and established throughout Venice. Carpaccio signed two early works with the Venetian form of his last name: first as VETOR[E] SCHARPAÇO in his &quot;Virgin and Child&quot; () at the Museo Correr (Fondazione Musei Civici di Venezia) and then as VETOR SCARPAZO on the parapet in his &quot;Salvator Mundi with Four Saints&quot; () owned by the Fondazione Luciano Sorlini in Carzago di Calvagese (in Brescia). By 1490, with the painting &quot;Arrival in Cologne&quot; (part of the Life of Saint Ursula cycle; see below), he began to use variants of the Latin Carpatius and Carpathius. It was not until a 1648 publication that one of his biographers, Carlo Ridolifu, referred to the artist as &quot;Carpaccio&quot; the name for which he is known today.

Early twentieth-century scholars Molmento and Ludwig argued that Carpaccio&#x27;s first teacher Lazzaro Bastiani, who, like the Bellini brothers and Vivarini, was the head of a large &quot;atelier&quot; in Venice. In the end, scarce details remain about his early life, leaving scholars to piece together his early artistic training and formation. In the 2022 catalogue raisonné, Humfrey presents the different arguments for why Carpaccio possibly apprenticed in the Venetian studio of the Bellini family, developing his artistry under the guidance of Gentile Bellini and/or Giovanni Bellini.

Carpaccio&#x27;s earliest known solo works are a &quot;Virgin and Child&quot; ( or 1489) at the Museo Correr (Fondazione Musei Civici di Venezia) and the &quot;Salvator Mundi&quot; &quot;with Four Saints&quot; () owned by the Fondazione Luciano Sorlini in Carzago di Calvagese (in Brescia). The Virgin and Child reflects the influence of works from the Bellini workshop (Giovanni Bellini and Giovanni Bellini) – especially the Virgin&#x27;s hands and headdress, along with the figure of the Christ Child. Carpaccio may have also been influenced by the works of Lazzaro Bastiani and Alvise Vivarini, Venetian painters of an older generation. The black backdrop of the &quot;Salvator Mundi&quot; (Savior of the World) was likely influenced by Antonello da Messina&#x27;s &quot;Salvator Mundi&quot; (1475-76). Furthermore, Antonello&#x27;s use of rounded forms and volumes, along with the three-quarter views of the four surrounding saints likely influenced the aspiring, although immature, style of Carpaccio.

Carpaccio&#x27;s &quot;Madonna and Child with Two Saints (&quot;c.1485-1510) was destroyed during World War II. It was stored in a flak tower in Berlin for safe keeping, but in May 1945, the tower was set on fire and most of the objects inside were destroyed.

== Principal works (1490–1520s) ==
Carpaccio&#x27;s principal works were executed between 1490 and 1519, placing him among the early masters of Venetian painting in the Renaissance. 

By 1490, Carpaccio painted &quot;The Legend of Saint Ursula&quot;, a series of paintings for the Scuola di Sant&#x27;Orsola, one of the religious confraternities in Venice (see below &quot;Narrative Cycles&quot; for more on this series). This series elevated his prominence in early Renaissance Venice, allowing him to distinguish himself as a capable, creative painter skilled in artistic narration and lighting.

Around 1501–1507, he worked with Giovanni Bellini, painting in the Sala del Gran Consiglio in the Doge&#x27;s Palace. Like many other major works, the cycle was entirely lost in the fire of 1577.
Shortly after the year 1502, Vittore Carpaccio&#x27;s &quot;Saint Augustine in His Study&quot; was painted and signed with the inscription: VICTOR / CARPATHIVS / FINGEBAT. The artist situates the saint in an idealized interior domestic space, alluding to contemporary practices in the art of collecting during the Renaissance period. This painting showcases how objects associated with collecting are meant to spill out within a space and between the rooms of a house. On the left wall of the painting, sculptures, Etruscan vases, and a Mamluk metalwork candlestick are displayed on a shelf, referencing objects that were highly sought after during that time and valued in Renaissance art collecting.

Carpaccio completed additional narrative cycles and expanded his oeuvre. Between 1502 and 1504, he portrayed episodes from the lives of Saint Jerome and the Virgin Mary.

The legend of Saint George is referenced in his painting, &quot;St. George Baptizing the Selenites&quot; (1507)&quot;.&quot; According to the Golden Legend, George, a Christian knight, rescues a Libyan princess who has been offered in sacrifice to a dragon. Horrified that her pagan family would do such a thing, George brings the dragon back to her town and compels them to be baptized. The legend of St. George was enormously popular during the Renaissance, and the confrontation between the knight and the dragon was painted later by numerous artists, such as Albrecht Altdorfer&#x27;s &quot;St. George and the Dragon&quot; (1510).

From 1507 to 1508, Carpaccio executed the work, &quot;St. Tryphonius Exorcizing the Demon&quot;.

In 1508, he joined a committee established to assess the frescoes painted by Giorgione, which had been commissioned by the Fondaco dei Tedeschi, a trading post for German merchants.

Carpaccio appears to have been influenced by Cima da Conegliano, as evidenced in the &quot;Death of the Virgin&quot; from 1508, at Ferrara. In 1510, Carpaccio executed the panels of &quot;Lamentation on the Dead Christ&quot; and &quot;The Meditation on the Passion&quot;, where the sense of sorrow found in such works by Mantegna is backed by extensive use of symbolism. The theme of death is evident in &quot;The Meditation on the Passion&quot;, as Christ&#x27;s body sits on a throne with pseudo-Hebrew inscriptions. In the background sit leafless trees, crumbling buildings, and a dry, desert ground—all alluding to the theme of death. During the same year, 1510, Carpaccio painted&quot;Young Knight in a Landscape&quot;, now located in the Thyssen-Bornemisza Collection of Madrid.

In the early 1510s, Carpaccio began to experiment with other formats, particularly altarpieces and other devotional works on a smaller scale. However, he experienced less success upon the rise of younger artists, such as Titian, Giorgione, and Lorenzo Lotto, whose innovative styles challenged his conservative values. Nonetheless, he designed various altarpieces for Venetian churches, including &quot;St. Thomas Aquinas Enthroned&quot; (1507), &quot;Presentation of Christ in the Temple&quot; (1510), and &quot;Martyrdom of the Ten Thousand&quot; (1515), while he also continued to paint for a more modest community of provincial patrons.

Between 1511 and 1520 he finished five pictures on the &quot;Life of St. Stephen&quot; for the Scuola di Santo Stefano. One of those paintings, &quot;The Ordination of Saint Stephen&quot; (1511), an oil on canvas, is located today in the Gemäldegalerie, Berlin.

Carpaccio&#x27;s &quot;Saint George and the Dragon (1516)&quot;, an oil on canvas painting located in the Abbazia di San Giorgio Maggiore, Benedicti Claustra Onlus, (Venice), positions St. George as the dragon-slayer to symbolize the triumph of Christian values over the devil (represented as a dragon). Although uncommon in the iconographic depictions of St. George, &quot;St. George Baptizing the Selenites&quot; offers a good example of the type of oriental (eastern) subjects that were popular in Venice at the time: great care and attention is given to the foreign costumes, and hats are especially significant in indicating the European construction of the exotic. In &quot;The Baptism&quot; scene&quot;,&quot; one of the recent converts has placed his elaborate red-and-white, jewel-tipped turban on the ground in order to receive the sacrament. Fortini Brown argues that this increased interest in exotic eastern subject matter was a result of worsening relations between Venice and the Ottoman Turks: &quot;as it became more of a threat, it also became more of an obsession.&quot;

In 1516, he painted a Sacra Conversatione painting in the then-Venetian town of Capo d&#x27;Istria (now Koper in Slovenia), which is hanging in its Cathedral of the Assumption. Carpaccio created several more works in Capo d&#x27;Istria, where he spent the last years of his life and also died.

=== Narrative cycles and Altarpieces ===


==== The Legend of Saint Ursula Cycle ====
In 1490, Carpaccio began &quot;The Legend of Saint Ursula,&quot; a series of paintings executed for the &quot;Scuola di Sant&#x27;Orsola&quot; depicting the life of the confraternity&#x27;s patron saint. The &quot;Scuola di Sant&#x27;Orsola&quot; was a well-established confraternity where many individuals across the social spectrum would come together and engage in civic-oriented work. This cycle has led scholars to describe him as a &quot;master visual storyteller,&quot; since the large-scale paintings were installed in large open spaces, like a reception or audience hall, allowing spectators to take in the scenes, similar to animation storyboards.

The subject of Carpaccio&#x27;s paintings, which are housed in the Gallerie dell&#x27;Accademia, was drawn from the Golden Legend of Jacopo da Varagine. The legend revolves around St. Ursula and her companions in Cologne where tradition relates that in the year 385, a legion of eleven thousand virgins professing their faith to Christ, with Ursula at their head and twenty thousand Christians by their side, would be massacred by the Germans upon their arrival in Cologne after coming from the island of Britain. Carpaccio was greatly inspired by the legend, especially its themes of massacre and chronology that brought the story to life.

The cycle of paintings expresses a fantastical tone that is reminiscent of Giovanni Bellini and Gentile Bellini. It would take Carpaccio about seven years to complete all nine paintings and over the course of the seven years his artistic style would mature. Carpaccio&#x27;s use of perspective, depth, and dimension were key points of improvement throughout his series, as observed by various art historians. One of the most notable paintings in &quot;The Legend of Saint Ursula&quot; series is the &quot;Arrival of St. Ursula at Cologne&quot; (1490), which recalls the work of Jacopo Bellini in its elemental treatment of light and atmosphere. In the &quot;Dream of St. Ursula&quot; (1490), Carpaccio paints the story of heavenly love where St. Ursula is visited by an angel in her dream informing her that she will die and become a martyr of Christ. By 1495, in the &quot;Departure of St. Ursula&quot;, the largest canvas of the series, his treatment of color, geometric perspective, and figural composition would reflect his careful study and mastery over Venetian narrative art form. The piece illustrates a town teeming with people, while simultaneously flaunting splendor by including marbles, expensive fabrics, and architecture inspired by the eastern Mediterranean.

==== The Schiavoni and Albanesi Cycles ====
In the opening decade of the sixteenth century, Carpaccio embarked on works that scholars have argued made him one of the foremost orientalist painters of his age. From 1502 to 1507 Carpaccio executed another notable cycle of panels for the Scuola di San Giorgio degli Schiavoni which served one of Venice&#x27;s immigrant communities (&quot;Schiavoni&quot; meaning &quot;Slavs&quot; in the Venetian dialect). Unlike the use of a continuous narrative sequence found in the &quot;St. Ursula&quot; series, wherein the main characters appear multiple times within each canvas, each work in the &quot;Schiavoni&quot; cycle concentrates on a single episode in the lives of Dalmatia&#x27;s three patron saints: St. Jerome, St. George and St. Trifon. In the painting, &quot;Jerome Leading the Lion into the Monastery&quot; (1509), introduces a humorous, intimate mood. Another painting, &quot;St. George and the Dragon,&quot; explores themes of the Christian night vanquishing the Muslim infidel. These works are thought of as &quot;orientalist&quot; because they offer evidence of a fascination with the Levant: a distinctly Middle Eastern-looking landscape takes an increasing role in the images as the backdrop to the religious scenes. Moreover, several of the scenes deal directly with cross-cultural issues, such as translation and conversion.

The painting cycle of &quot;Life of the Virgin&quot; for Scuola degli Albanesi dates to 1504–1508 and was largely executed by Carpaccio&#x27;s assistants. The images are now divided among the Accademia Carrara of Bergamo, the Pinacoteca di Brera in Milan, and the Ca&#x27; d&#x27;Oro in Venice.

==== Altarpieces ====
In 1491, Carpaccio completed the &quot;Glory of St. Ursula&quot; altarpiece, a large scale detachable wall-painting painted for the hall of one of the Venetian &quot;scuole&quot;, which were charitable and social confraternities. Three years later he took part in the decoration of the Scuola Grande di San Giovanni Evangelista, painting the &quot;Miracle of the Relic of the Cross at the Ponte di Rialto&quot; (1496). Other altarpieces that Carpaccio created, like &quot;St. Thomas Aquinas Enthroned&quot; (1507)&quot;, &quot;Presentation of Christ in the Temple&quot; (1510), and &quot;Martyrdom of the Ten Thousand&quot; (1515), were commissioned by Venice churches. The church-patron of &quot;St. Thomas Aquinas Enthroned&quot; (1507) remains unknown; however, &quot;Presentation of Christ in the Temple&quot; (1510) was commissioned by the church of San Giobbe, and &quot;Martyrdom of the Ten Thousand&quot; (1515) by the church of San Giorgio Maggiore. After 1510, he painted for patrons in his province, sending his altarpieces to patrons in cities across the country. It has been argued that his altarpieces were not his best works, as they appeared unnatural and lacked fluidity when compared to the most influential altarpieces of the time.

== Artistic decline and death (1520s) ==

Towards the end of his life, the quality of his art began to decline, specifically following his &quot;Schiavoni&quot; pieces. The change in quality was remarked upon by the artistic community then and now. By contrast, the Italian Renaissance painter Giorgione made innovations in the field that Carpaccio was simply unable to match. The expectations and artistic demands had changed, resulting in Carpaccio&#x27;s style seeming outmoded in comparison. He never altered his style to keep up with these new innovations. Carpaccio increasingly turned to the assistance of his sons Pietro and Benedetto, his principal pupils. However, he independently completed his final work, which consisted of decorating organ shutters for the Duomo at Capo d&#x27;Istria in 1523.

Carpaccio&#x27;s late works were mostly done in the Venetian mainland territories, and in collaboration with his sons Benedetto and Piero. One of his pupils was Marco Marziale. 
He spent his final years in this Slovenian town, where he died between 1525 and 1526.

== Style ==
Carpaccio was one of the first artists to include a &quot;cartellino&quot; into his paintings; he inserted it into select pieces in a way that made it appear as if the artist had left it there without thought.

In comparison to his mentor Giovanni Bellini, Carpaccio&#x27;s works are overall less defined. Considered untraditional at the time, Carpaccio painted his altarpieces on canvas rather than on wood panel. In addition, he carried out thin priming, which resulted in a bolder look.

Carpaccio was observed to have played with the vanishing point in his works. For example, in &quot;St. Jerome In His Study&quot;, the vanishing point is to the right of the center. While he did still employ the traditional use of having the vanishing point be in the center, at times Carpaccio added a second vanishing point. In &quot;The Death of St. Jerome&quot; (1502), a second vanishing point was included below the primary one on the body of the saint. The effect was that the primary vanishing point broadcast imagery away from the observer, while the vanishing point below brought the imagery towards the observer. 

Carpaccio paid special attention to architecture, depicting buildings precisely and accurately to ensure that his paintings reflected the new architectural elements in Venice.

== Legacy and influence ==

Carpaccio transformed from being a member of a small furrier merchant family to being a prominent artist in Italy, with some scholars comparing his stature to Gentile Bellini. Unlike Bellini, Carpaccio worked mostly in what has been described as a more conservative-style of painting, a contrast to the growing humanist tendencies that were a prominent influence on other painters in Italy during his lifetime. His depiction of Venetian architecture and everyday life has greatly contributed to modern historians&#x27; conception of fifteenth-century Venetian culture. Most of Carpaccio&#x27;s works have been relocated and are now displayed in the Gallerie dell&#x27;Accademia in Venice. Only one complete collection of paintings remains intact, which can be found along the walls of the Scuola di San Giorgio degli Schiavoni.

Later artists produced various works in the aftermath of Carpaccio&#x27;s death and were inspired by his oeuvre. For instance, Paris Bordone&#x27;s &quot;The Presentation of the Ring&quot; (1534), an oil painting, echoed Carpaccio&#x27;s broad compositions, accurate representation of textiles and fabrics, and representation of a gathering of a confraternity. Carpaccio also influenced the glassware industry of sixteenth-century Murano. For instance, collections of milk-glass tumblers, especially those depicting brides to celebrate engagements, drew heavily from his painting &quot;Two Venetian Ladies&quot; ()&quot;.&quot;

== Critical reception: then and now ==

Carpaccio received modest acclaim during his lifetime, only occasionally creating works for the Venetian nobility. While regular employment was scarce, he primarily served a variety of working-class patrons that consisted of sailors, artisans, and tradesmen belonging to the scuole of the Albanesi and Schiavoni. He was also commissioned to create mainland works for Bergamo&#x27;s parish church of Grumello de&#x27; Zanchi and a scuole in Udine. Outside of Venice, he received support from a few distinguished families, such as the della Rovere of Urbino.

While assessments among historians and scholars vary, many identify Carpaccio as one of the most significant contemporaries of Giovanni Bellini. Despite residing in the shadows of his mentors, he received recognition from contemporary scholars, writers, and critics. In his accounts on perspective, the Italian diplomat and architect, Daniele Barbaro, referenced Carpaccio&#x27;s works. Similarly, in Giorgio Vasari&#x27;s 1568 series &quot;Le vite de&#x27; più eccellenti pittori, scultori e architettori&quot; (&quot;The Lives of the Most Excellent Painters, Sculptors, and Architects&quot;), Carpaccio appeared at the forefront of a list of Venetian painters. This decision distinguished his artistic reputation from other painters in northern Italy.

Interest in Carpaccio resurged in the nineteenth century as English writer and art critic John Ruskin celebrated the Venetian painter&#x27;s attention to detail. Ruskin likened Carpaccio&#x27;s works to a &quot;...magic mirror which flashes back instantly whatever it sees beautifully arranged...&quot; The nineteenth-century Italian painter Pompeo Marino Molmenti held a similarly high view, regarding Carpaccio as &quot;...the most truthful chronicler of a people living in the full meridian of their glory.&quot; In the twentieth century, increased recognition of Carpaccio&#x27;s works culminated in the 1963 retrospective exhibition that took place in the Doge&#x27;s Palace in Venice. According to several scholars it was this exhibition in Venice that in turn inspired a local chef, Giuseppe Cipriani (founder of Harry&#x27;s Bar in Venice), to name a dish (thinly sliced raw beef) after the painter and his use of vibrant reds.

The first ever retrospective of his art outside of Italy, &quot;Vittore Carpaccio: Master Storyteller of Renaissance Venice&quot; was exhibited at Washington, D.C.&#x27;s National Gallery of Art, November 20, 2022 – February 12, 2023, with an accompanying exhibition catalog, &quot;Vittore Carpaccio: Paintings and Drawings&quot;. A comprehensive publication with the same title as the exhibition was simultaneously released. The exhibition brought together forty-five paintings and thirty drawings made by Carpaccio, including the NGA&#x27;s &quot;Virgin Reading&quot; (), which had recently undergone conservation work. It is planned for the exhibition to travel to the Palazzo Ducale, Venice, to be on view from March 18 to June 18, 2023.

<text>General elections were held in the Netherlands on 6 March 1888, with a second round in 25 constituencies on 20 March. The Liberal Union emerged as the largest party, winning 46 of the 100 seats in the House of Representatives.

==Background==
This was the first election held after the constitutional revision of 1887, achieved by Minister of the Interior Jan Heemskerk, which had several effects on the parliamentary system. Firstly, this revision fixed the number of seats in the House of Representatives at 100. Secondly, it abolished multi-seat electoral districts except in large cities in favour of single-seat districts, thus allowing for better representation of geographically concentrated political minorities. Thirdly, the revision ensured all members of the House of Representatives would be elected simultaneously every four years, replacing the previous system of staggered elections. Finally, the change greatly extended suffrage and allowed for gradual further extension by law.

The election was won by the confessional parties, leading to the first Coalition government, combining Anti-Revolutionaries and Catholics, led by Æneas, Baron Mackay, thus heralding a period of Antithesis as championed by Abraham Kuyper, in which government alternated between secular liberals on the left and confessional Anti-Revolutionaries and Catholics on the right. The election also saw the first socialist elected into the House of Representatives, with Ferdinand Domela Nieuwenhuis, leader of the Social Democratic League, being elected in a rural Frisian district.

==Results==
===By district===
 Social Democratic  
 Liberal  
 Conservative

<text>The Garrison Chapel is a chapel to the Royal Dockyard at Pembroke Dock in Pembrokeshire, Wales. It was designed by George Ledwell Taylor, Surveyor of Buildings to the Navy Board, in the early 1830s and was completed in 1834–35. Originally, £7,944 was allotted in the 1829–30 Naval Estimates, but this was reduced to £4,000 by the Controller of the Navy Board. A year after it was completed, another £3,500 was provided to build galleries to accommodate the increased numbers attending and to create an additional entrance.

From 1974 until 1986 it was used by the Pembrokeshire Motor Museum, but was then sold to a developer and fell into disrepair. It was compulsorily purchased by the county council in 2003.

It has been rebuilt using Objective One funding from the European Union and now houses the Pembroke Dock Heritage Centre run by Pembroke Dock Sunderland Trust. It is a Grade II* listed building.

<doc id="803894" wikidata="Q3503315" url="?curid=803894" title="Spectral sequence">
<text>In homological algebra and algebraic topology, a spectral sequence is a means of computing homology groups by taking successive approximations. Spectral sequences are a generalization of exact sequences, and since their introduction by , they have become important computational tools, particularly in algebraic topology, algebraic geometry and homological algebra.

== Discovery and motivation ==

Motivated by problems in algebraic topology, Jean Leray introduced the notion of a sheaf and found himself faced with the problem of computing sheaf cohomology. To compute sheaf cohomology, Leray introduced a computational technique now known as the Leray spectral sequence. This gave a relation between cohomology groups of a sheaf and cohomology groups of the pushforward of the sheaf. The relation involved an infinite process. Leray found that the cohomology groups of the pushforward formed a natural chain complex, so that he could take the cohomology of the cohomology. This was still not the cohomology of the original sheaf, but it was one step closer in a sense. The cohomology of the cohomology again formed a chain complex, and its cohomology formed a chain complex, and so on. The limit of this infinite process was essentially the same as the cohomology groups of the original sheaf.

It was soon realized that Leray&#x27;s computational technique was an example of a more general phenomenon. Spectral sequences were found in diverse situations, and they gave intricate relationships among homology and cohomology groups coming from geometric situations such as fibrations and from algebraic situations involving derived functors. While their theoretical importance has decreased since the introduction of derived categories, they are still the most effective computational tool available. This is true even when many of the terms of the spectral sequence are incalculable.

Unfortunately, because of the large amount of information carried in spectral sequences, they are difficult to grasp. This information is usually contained in a rank three lattice of abelian groups or modules. The easiest cases to deal with are those in which the spectral sequence eventually collapses, meaning that going out further in the sequence produces no new information. Even when this does not happen, it is often possible to get useful information from a spectral sequence by various tricks.

== Formal definition ==
=== Cohomological spectral sequence ===
Fix an abelian category, such as a category of modules over a ring, and a nonnegative integer formula_1. A cohomological spectral sequence is a sequence formula_2 of objects formula_3 and endomorphisms formula_4, such that for every formula_5
# formula_6,
# formula_7, the homology of formula_8 with respect to formula_9.
Usually the isomorphisms are suppressed and we write formula_10 instead. An object formula_3 is called &quot;sheet&quot; (as in a sheet of paper), or sometimes a &quot;page&quot; or a &quot;term&quot;; an endomorphism formula_12 is called &quot;boundary map&quot; or &quot;differential&quot;. Sometimes formula_13 is called the &quot;derived object&quot; of formula_8.

=== Bigraded spectral sequence === 
In reality spectral sequences mostly occur in the category of doubly graded modules over a ring &quot;R&quot; (or doubly graded sheaves of modules over a sheaf of rings), i.e. every sheet is a bigraded R-module formula_15
So in this case a cohomological spectral sequence is a sequence formula_2 of bigraded R-modules formula_17 and for every module the direct sum of endomorphisms formula_18 of bidegree formula_19, such that for every formula_5 it holds that:
# formula_21,
# formula_7.
The notation used here is called &quot;complementary degree&quot;. Some authors write formula_23 instead, where formula_24 is the &quot;total degree&quot;. Depending upon the spectral sequence, the boundary map on the first sheet can have a degree which corresponds to &quot;r&quot; = 0, &quot;r&quot; = 1, or &quot;r&quot; = 2. For example, for the spectral sequence of a filtered complex, described below, &quot;r&quot;0 = 0, but for the Grothendieck spectral sequence, &quot;r&quot;0 = 2. Usually &quot;r&quot;0 is zero, one, or two. In the ungraded situation described above, &quot;r&quot;0 is irrelevant.

=== Homological spectral sequence ===
Mostly the objects we are talking about are chain complexes, that occur with descending (like above) or ascending order. In the latter case, by replacing formula_25 with formula_26 and formula_27 with formula_28 (bidegree formula_29), one receives the definition of a homological spectral sequence analogously to the cohomological case.

==== Spectral sequence from a chain complex ====
The most elementary example in the ungraded situation is a chain complex &quot;C•&quot;. An object &quot;C•&quot; in an abelian category of chain complexes naturally comes with a differential &quot;d&quot;. Let &quot;r&quot;0 = 0, and let &quot;E&quot;0 be &quot;C•&quot;. This forces &quot;E&quot;1 to be the complex &quot;H&quot;(&quot;C•&quot;): At the &quot;i&quot;&#x27;th location this is the &quot;i&quot;&#x27;th homology group of &quot;C•&quot;. The only natural differential on this new complex is the zero map, so we let &quot;d&quot;1 = 0. This forces formula_30 to equal formula_31, and again our only natural differential is the zero map. Putting the zero differential on all the rest of our sheets gives a spectral sequence whose terms are:

* &quot;E&quot;0 = &quot;C•&quot;
* &quot;Er&quot; = &quot;H&quot;(&quot;C•&quot;) for all &quot;r&quot; ≥ 1.

The terms of this spectral sequence stabilize at the first sheet because its only nontrivial differential was on the zeroth sheet. Consequently, we can get no more information at later steps. Usually, to get useful information from later sheets, we need extra structure on the formula_8.

== Visualization ==

A doubly graded spectral sequence has a tremendous amount of data to keep track of, but there is a common visualization technique which makes the structure of the spectral sequence clearer. We have three indices, &quot;r&quot;, &quot;p&quot;, and &quot;q&quot;. An object formula_8 can be seen as the formula_34 checkered page of a book. On these sheets, we will take &quot;p&quot; to be the horizontal direction and &quot;q&quot; to be the vertical direction. At each lattice point we have the object formula_35. Now turning to the next page means taking homology, that is the formula_36 page is a subquotient of the formula_34 page. The total degree &quot;n&quot; = &quot;p&quot; + &quot;q&quot; runs diagonally, northwest to southeast, across each sheet. In the homological case, the differentials have bidegree (−&quot;r&quot;, &quot;r&quot; − 1), so they decrease &quot;n&quot; by one. In the cohomological case, &quot;n&quot; is increased by one. The differentials change their direction with each turn with respect to r.

The red arrows demonstrate the case of a first quadrant sequence (see example below), where only the objects of the first quadrant are non-zero. While turning pages, either the domain or the codomain of all the differentials become zero.

== Properties ==
=== Categorical properties ===
The set of cohomological spectral sequences form a category: a morphism of spectral sequences formula_38 is by definition a collection of maps formula_39 which are compatible with the differentials, i.e. formula_40, and with the given isomorphisms between the cohomology of the &quot;r&quot;th step and the &quot;(r+1)&quot;th sheets of &quot;E&quot; and &quot;E&#x27; &quot;, respectively: formula_41. In the bigraded case, they should also respect the graduation: formula_42

=== Multiplicative structure ===
A cup product gives a ring structure to a cohomology group, turning it into a cohomology ring. Thus, it is natural to consider a spectral sequence with a ring structure as well. Let formula_43 be a spectral sequence of cohomological type. We say it has multiplicative structure if (i) formula_8 are (doubly graded) differential graded algebras and (ii) the multiplication on formula_13 is induced by that on formula_8 via passage to cohomology.

A typical example is the cohomological Serre spectral sequence for a fibration formula_47, when the coefficient group is a ring &quot;R&quot;. It has the multiplicative structure induced by the cup products of fibre and base on the formula_48-page. However, in general the limiting term formula_49 is not isomorphic as a graded algebra to H(&quot;E&quot;; &quot;R&quot;). The multiplicative structure can be very useful for calculating differentials on the sequence.

== Constructions of spectral sequences ==
Spectral sequences can be constructed by various ways. In algebraic topology, an exact couple is perhaps the most common tool for the construction. In algebraic geometry, spectral sequences are usually constructed from filtrations of cochain complexes.

=== Spectral sequence of an exact couple ===
Another technique for constructing spectral sequences is William Massey&#x27;s method of exact couples. Exact couples are particularly common in algebraic topology. Despite this they are unpopular in abstract algebra, where most spectral sequences come from filtered complexes.

To define exact couples, we begin again with an abelian category. As before, in practice this is usually the category of doubly graded modules over a ring. An exact couple is a pair of objects (&quot;A&quot;, &quot;C&quot;), together with three homomorphisms between these objects: &quot;f&quot; : &quot;A&quot; → &quot;A&quot;, &quot;g&quot; : &quot;A&quot; → &quot;C&quot; and &quot;h&quot; : &quot;C&quot; → &quot;A&quot; subject to certain exactness conditions:

*Image &quot;f&quot; = Kernel &quot;g&quot;
*Image &quot;g&quot; = Kernel &quot;h&quot;
*Image &quot;h&quot; = Kernel &quot;f&quot;

We will abbreviate this data by (&quot;A&quot;, &quot;C&quot;, &quot;f&quot;, &quot;g&quot;, &quot;h&quot;). Exact couples are usually depicted as triangles. We will see that &quot;C&quot; corresponds to the &quot;E&quot;0 term of the spectral sequence and that &quot;A&quot; is some auxiliary data.

To pass to the next sheet of the spectral sequence, we will form the derived couple. We set:

*&quot;d&quot; = &quot;g&quot; &quot;h&quot;
*&quot;A&#x27;&quot; = &quot;f&quot;(&quot;A&quot;)
*&quot;C&#x27;&quot; = Ker &quot;d&quot; / Im &quot;d&quot;
*&quot;f &#x27;&quot; = &quot;f&quot;|&quot;A&#x27;&quot;, the restriction of &quot;f&quot; to &quot;A&#x27;&quot;
*&quot;h&#x27;&quot; : &quot;C&#x27;&quot; → &quot;A&#x27;&quot; is induced by &quot;h&quot;. It is straightforward to see that &quot;h&quot; induces such a map.
*&quot;g&#x27;&quot; : &quot;A&#x27;&quot; → &quot;C&#x27;&quot; is defined on elements as follows: For each &quot;a&quot; in &quot;A&#x27;&quot;, write &quot;a&quot; as &quot;f&quot;(&quot;b&quot;) for some &quot;b&quot; in &quot;A&quot;. &quot;g&#x27;&quot;(&quot;a&quot;) is defined to be the image of &quot;g&quot;(&quot;b&quot;) in &quot;C&#x27;&quot;. In general, &quot;g&#x27;&quot; can be constructed using one of the embedding theorems for abelian categories.

From here it is straightforward to check that (&quot;A&#x27;&quot;, &quot;C&#x27;&quot;, &quot;f &#x27;&quot;, &quot;g&#x27;&quot;, &quot;h&#x27;&quot;) is an exact couple. &quot;C&#x27;&quot; corresponds to the &quot;E1&quot; term of the spectral sequence. We can iterate this procedure to get exact couples (&quot;A&quot;(&quot;n&quot;), &quot;C&quot;(&quot;n&quot;), &quot;f&quot;(&quot;n&quot;), &quot;g&quot;(&quot;n&quot;), &quot;h&quot;(&quot;n&quot;)).

In order to construct a spectral sequence, let &quot;En&quot; be &quot;C&quot;(&quot;n&quot;) and &quot;dn&quot; be &quot;g&quot;(&quot;n&quot;) &quot;h&quot;(&quot;n&quot;).

==== Spectral sequences constructed with this method ====

* Atiyah–Hirzebruch spectral sequence - used to compute (co)homology of extraordinary cohomology theories, such as K-theory
* Bockstein spectral sequence.
* Spectral sequences of filtered complexes

=== The spectral sequence of a filtered complex ===

A very common type of spectral sequence comes from a filtered cochain complex, as it naturally induces a bigraded object. Consider a cochain complex formula_50 together with a descending filtration, formula_51 . We require that the boundary map is compatible with the filtration, i.e. formula_52, and that the filtration is &quot;exhaustive&quot;, that is, the union of the set of all formula_53 is the entire chain complex formula_54. Then there exists a spectral sequence with formula_55 and formula_56. Later, we will also assume that the filtration is &quot;Hausdorff&quot; or &quot;separated&quot;, that is, the intersection of the set of all formula_53 is zero.

The filtration is useful because it gives a measure of nearness to zero: As &quot;p&quot; increases, formula_53 gets closer and closer to zero. We will construct a spectral sequence from this filtration where coboundaries and cocycles in later sheets get closer and closer to coboundaries and cocycles in the original complex. This spectral sequence is doubly graded by the filtration degree &quot;p&quot; and the complementary degree .

==== Construction ====
formula_59 has only a single grading and a filtration, so we first construct a doubly graded object for the first page of the spectral sequence. To get the second grading, we will take the associated graded object with respect to the filtration. We will write it in an unusual way which will be justified at the formula_60 step:

:formula_61
:formula_62
:formula_63
:formula_64

Since we assumed that the boundary map was compatible with the filtration, formula_65 is a doubly graded object and there is a natural doubly graded boundary map formula_66 on formula_65. To get formula_60, we take the homology of formula_65.

:formula_70
:formula_71
:formula_72
:formula_73

Notice that formula_74 and formula_75 can be written as the images in formula_76 of
:formula_77
:formula_78

and that we then have

:formula_79

formula_80 are exactly the elements which the differential pushes up one level in the filtration, and formula_81 are exactly the image of the elements which the differential pushes up zero levels in the filtration. This suggests that we should choose formula_82 to be the elements which the differential pushes up &quot;r&quot; levels in the filtration and formula_83 to be image of the elements which the differential pushes up &quot;r-1&quot; levels in the filtration. In other words, the spectral sequence should satisfy

:formula_84
:formula_85
:formula_86

and we should have the relationship

:formula_87

For this to make sense, we must find a differential formula_12 on each formula_3 and verify that it leads to homology isomorphic to formula_90. The differential 
:formula_91

is defined by restricting the original differential formula_92 defined on formula_93 to the subobject formula_82. It is straightforward to check that the homology of formula_3 with respect to this differential is formula_90, so this gives a spectral sequence. Unfortunately, the differential is not very explicit. Determining differentials or finding ways to work around them is one of the main challenges to successfully applying a spectral sequence.

==== Spectral sequences constructed with this method ====

* Hodge–de Rham spectral sequence
* Spectral sequence of a double complex
* Can be used to construct Mixed Hodge structures

=== The spectral sequence of a double complex ===

Another common spectral sequence is the spectral sequence of a double complex. A double complex is a collection of objects &quot;Ci,j&quot; for all integers &quot;i&quot; and &quot;j&quot; together with two differentials, &quot;d I&quot; and &quot;d II&quot;. &quot;d I&quot; is assumed to decrease &quot;i&quot;, and &quot;d II&quot; is assumed to decrease &quot;j&quot;. Furthermore, we assume that the differentials &quot;anticommute&quot;, so that &quot;d I d II&quot; + &quot;d II d I&quot; = 0. Our goal is to compare the iterated homologies formula_97 and formula_98. We will do this by filtering our double complex in two different ways. Here are our filtrations:

:formula_99
:formula_100

To get a spectral sequence, we will reduce to the previous example. We define the &quot;total complex&quot; &quot;T&quot;(&quot;C&quot;•,•) to be the complex whose &quot;n&quot;&#x27;th term is formula_101 and whose differential is &quot;d I&quot; + &quot;d II&quot;. This is a complex because &quot;d I&quot; and &quot;d II&quot; are anticommuting differentials. The two filtrations on &quot;Ci,j&quot; give two filtrations on the total complex:

:formula_102
:formula_103

To show that these spectral sequences give information about the iterated homologies, we will work out the &quot;E&quot;0, &quot;E&quot;1, and &quot;E&quot;2 terms of the &quot;I&quot; filtration on &quot;T&quot;(&quot;C&quot;•,•). The &quot;E&quot;0 term is clear:

:formula_104
where .

To find the &quot;E&quot;1 term, we need to determine &quot;d I&quot; + &quot;d II&quot; on &quot;E&quot;0. Notice that the differential must have degree −1 with respect to &quot;n&quot;, so we get a map

:formula_105

Consequently, the differential on &quot;E0&quot; is the map &quot;C&quot;&quot;p&quot;,&quot;q&quot; → &quot;C&quot;&quot;p&quot;,&quot;q&quot;−1 induced by &quot;d I&quot; + &quot;d II&quot;. But &quot;d I&quot; has the wrong degree to induce such a map, so &quot;d I&quot; must be zero on &quot;E&quot;0. That means the differential is exactly &quot;d II&quot;, so we get

:formula_106

To find &quot;E2&quot;, we need to determine

:formula_107

Because &quot;E&quot;1 was exactly the homology with respect to &quot;d II&quot;, &quot;d II&quot; is zero on &quot;E&quot;1. Consequently, we get

:formula_108

Using the other filtration gives us a different spectral sequence with a similar &quot;E&quot;2 term:

:formula_109

What remains is to find a relationship between these two spectral sequences. It will turn out that as &quot;r&quot; increases, the two sequences will become similar enough to allow useful comparisons.

== Convergence, degeneration, and abutment ==
=== Interpretation as a filtration of cycles and boundaries ===
Let &quot;E&quot;&quot;r&quot; be a spectral sequence, starting with say &quot;r&quot; = 1. Then there is a sequence of subobjects
:formula_110
such that formula_111; indeed, recursively we let formula_112 and let formula_113 be so that formula_114 are the kernel and the image of formula_115

We then let formula_116 and
:formula_117;
it is called the limiting term. (Of course, such formula_49 need not exist in the category, but this is usually a non-issue since for example in the category of modules such limits exist or since in practice a spectral sequence one works with tends to degenerate; there are only finitely many inclusions in the sequence above.)

=== Terms of convergence ===
We say a spectral sequence converges weakly if there is a graded object formula_119 with a filtration formula_120 for every formula_121, and for every formula_122 there exists an isomorphism formula_123. It converges to formula_119 if the filtration formula_120 is Hausdorff, i.e. formula_126. We write
:formula_127

to mean that whenever &quot;p&quot; + &quot;q&quot; = &quot;n&quot;, formula_35 converges to formula_129.
We say that a spectral sequence formula_35 abuts to formula_129 if for every formula_132 there is formula_133 such that for all formula_134, formula_135. Then formula_136 is the limiting term. The spectral sequence is regular or degenerates at formula_137 if the differentials formula_138 are zero for all formula_139. If in particular there is formula_140, such that the formula_141 sheet is concentrated on a single row or a single column, then we say it collapses. In symbols, we write:

:formula_142

The &quot;p&quot; indicates the filtration index. It is very common to write the formula_143 term on the left-hand side of the abutment, because this is the most useful term of most spectral sequences. The spectral sequence of an unfiltered chain complex degenerates at the first sheet (see first example): since nothing happens after the zeroth sheet, the limiting sheet formula_144 is the same as formula_60.

The five-term exact sequence of a spectral sequence relates certain low-degree terms and &quot;E&quot;∞ terms.

== Examples of degeneration ==

=== The spectral sequence of a filtered complex, continued ===

Notice that we have a chain of inclusions:

:formula_146

We can ask what happens if we define

:formula_147
:formula_148
:formula_149

formula_129 is a natural candidate for the abutment of this spectral sequence. Convergence is not automatic, but happens in many cases. In particular, if the filtration is finite and consists of exactly &quot;r&quot; nontrivial steps, then the spectral sequence degenerates after the &quot;r&quot;th sheet. Convergence also occurs if the complex and the filtration are both bounded below or both bounded above.

To describe the abutment of our spectral sequence in more detail, notice that we have the formulas:

:formula_151
:formula_152

To see what this implies for formula_153 recall that we assumed that the filtration was separated. This implies that as &quot;r&quot; increases, the kernels shrink, until we are left with formula_154. For formula_155, recall that we assumed that the filtration was exhaustive. This implies that as &quot;r&quot; increases, the images grow until we reach formula_156. We conclude

:formula_157,

that is, the abutment of the spectral sequence is the &quot;p&quot;th graded part of the &quot;(p+q)&quot;th homology of &quot;C&quot;. If our spectral sequence converges, then we conclude that:

:formula_158

==== Long exact sequences ====

Using the spectral sequence of a filtered complex, we can derive the existence of long exact sequences. Choose a short exact sequence of cochain complexes 0 → &quot;A•&quot; → &quot;B•&quot; → &quot;C•&quot; → 0, and call the first map &quot;f•&quot; : &quot;A•&quot; → &quot;B•&quot;. We get natural maps of homology objects &quot;Hn&quot;(&quot;A•&quot;) → &quot;Hn&quot;(&quot;B•&quot;) → &quot;Hn&quot;(&quot;C•&quot;), and we know that this is exact in the middle. We will use the spectral sequence of a filtered complex to find the connecting homomorphism and to prove that the resulting sequence is exact.To start, we filter &quot;B•&quot;:

:formula_159
:formula_160
:formula_161

This gives:

:formula_162
:formula_163

The differential has bidegree (1, 0), so &quot;d0,q&quot; : &quot;Hq&quot;(&quot;C•&quot;) → &quot;H&quot;&quot;q&quot;+1(&quot;A•&quot;). These are the connecting homomorphisms from the snake lemma, and together with the maps &quot;A•&quot; → &quot;B•&quot; → &quot;C•&quot;, they give a sequence:

:formula_164

It remains to show that this sequence is exact at the &quot;A&quot; and &quot;C&quot; spots. Notice that this spectral sequence degenerates at the &quot;E&quot;2 term because the differentials have bidegree (2, −1). Consequently, the &quot;E&quot;2 term is the same as the &quot;E&quot;∞ term:

:formula_165

But we also have a direct description of the &quot;E&quot;2 term as the homology of the &quot;E&quot;1 term. These two descriptions must be isomorphic:

:formula_166
:formula_167

The former gives exactness at the &quot;C&quot; spot, and the latter gives exactness at the &quot;A&quot; spot.

=== The spectral sequence of a double complex, continued ===

Using the abutment for a filtered complex, we find that:

:formula_168
:formula_169

In general, &quot;the two gradings on Hp+q(T(C•,•)) are distinct&quot;. Despite this, it is still possible to gain useful information from these two spectral sequences.

==== Commutativity of Tor ====

Let &quot;R&quot; be a ring, let &quot;M&quot; be a right &quot;R&quot;-module and &quot;N&quot; a left &quot;R&quot;-module. Recall that the derived functors of the tensor product are denoted Tor. Tor is defined using a projective resolution of its first argument. However, it turns out that formula_170. While this can be verified without a spectral sequence, it is very easy with spectral sequences.

Choose projective resolutions formula_171 and formula_172 of &quot;M&quot; and &quot;N&quot;, respectively. Consider these as complexes which vanish in negative degree having differentials &quot;d&quot; and &quot;e&quot;, respectively. We can construct a double complex whose terms are formula_173 and whose differentials are formula_174 and formula_175. (The factor of −1 is so that the differentials anticommute.) Since projective modules are flat, taking the tensor product with a projective module commutes with taking homology, so we get:

:formula_176
:formula_177

Since the two complexes are resolutions, their homology vanishes outside of degree zero. In degree zero, we are left with

:formula_178
:formula_179

In particular, the formula_180 terms vanish except along the lines &quot;q&quot; = 0 (for the &quot;I&quot; spectral sequence) and &quot;p&quot; = 0 (for the &quot;II&quot; spectral sequence). This implies that the spectral sequence degenerates at the second sheet, so the &quot;E&quot;∞ terms are isomorphic to the &quot;E&quot;2 terms:

:formula_181
:formula_182

Finally, when &quot;p&quot; and &quot;q&quot; are equal, the two right-hand sides are equal, and the commutativity of Tor follows.

== Worked-out examples ==
=== First-quadrant sheet ===
Consider a spectral sequence where formula_35 vanishes for all formula_122 less than some formula_185 and for all formula_186 less than some formula_187. If formula_185 and formula_187 can be chosen to be zero, this is called a first-quadrant spectral sequence.
The sequence abuts because formula_190 holds for all formula_191 if formula_192 and formula_193. To see this, note that either the domain or the codomain of the differential is zero for the considered cases. In visual terms, the sheets stabilize in a growing rectangle (see picture above). The spectral sequence need not degenerate, however, because the differential maps might not all be zero at once. Similarly, the spectral sequence also converges if formula_35 vanishes for all formula_122 greater than some formula_185 and for all formula_186 greater than some formula_187.

=== 2 non-zero adjacent columns ===
Let formula_199 be a homological spectral sequence such that formula_200 for all &quot;p&quot; other than 0, 1. Visually, this is the spectral sequence with formula_201-page
:formula_202
The differentials on the second page have degree (-2, 1), so they are of the form
:formula_203
These maps are all zero since they are
:formula_204, formula_205
hence the spectral sequence degenerates: formula_206. Say, it converges to formula_207 with a filtration
:formula_208
such that formula_209. Then formula_210, formula_211, formula_212, formula_213, etc. Thus, there is the exact sequence:
:formula_214.
Next, let formula_199 be a spectral sequence whose second page consists only of two lines &quot;q&quot; = 0, 1. This need not degenerate at the second page but it still degenerates at the third page as the differentials there have degree (-3, 2). Note formula_216, as the denominator is zero. Similarly, formula_217. Thus,
:formula_218.
Now, say, the spectral sequence converges to &quot;H&quot; with a filtration &quot;F&quot; as in the previous example. Since formula_219, formula_220, etc., we have: formula_221. Putting everything together, one gets:
:formula_222

=== Wang sequence ===
The computation in the previous section generalizes in a straightforward way. Consider a fibration over a sphere:
:formula_223
with &quot;n&quot; at least 2. There is the Serre spectral sequence:
:formula_224;
that is to say, formula_225 with some filtration formula_226.

Since formula_227 is nonzero only when &quot;p&quot; is zero or &quot;n&quot; and equal to Z in that case, we see formula_228 consists of only two lines formula_229, hence the formula_201-page is given by
:formula_231
Moreover, since
:formula_232
for formula_229 by the universal coefficient theorem, the formula_201 page looks like
:formula_235
Since the only non-zero differentials are on the formula_236-page, given by
:formula_237
which is
:formula_238
the spectral sequence converges on formula_239. By computing formula_240 we get an exact sequence
:formula_241
and written out using the homology groups, this is
:formula_242
To establish what the two formula_243-terms are, write formula_244, and since formula_245, etc., we have: formula_246 and thus, since formula_247,
:formula_248
This is the exact sequence
:formula_249
Putting all calculations together, one gets:
:formula_250
(The Gysin sequence is obtained in a similar way.)

=== Low-degree terms ===
With an obvious notational change, the type of the computations in the previous examples can also be carried out for cohomological spectral sequence. Let formula_251 be a first-quadrant spectral sequence converging to &quot;H&quot; with the decreasing filtration
:formula_252
so that formula_253
Since formula_254 is zero if &quot;p&quot; or &quot;q&quot; is negative, we have:
:formula_255
Since formula_256 for the same reason and since formula_257
:formula_258.
Since formula_259, formula_260. Stacking the sequences together, we get the so-called five-term exact sequence:
:formula_261

== Edge maps and transgressions ==

=== Homological spectral sequences ===
Let formula_199 be a spectral sequence. If formula_263 for every &quot;q&quot; &lt; 0, then it must be that: for &quot;r&quot; ≥ 2,
:formula_264
as the denominator is zero. Hence, there is a sequence of monomorphisms:
:formula_265.
They are called the edge maps. Similarly, if formula_263 for every &quot;p&quot; &lt; 0, then there is a sequence of epimorphisms (also called the edge maps):
:formula_267.
The transgression is a partially-defined map (more precisely, a map from a subobject to a quotient)
:formula_268
given as a composition formula_269, the first and last maps being the inverses of the edge maps.

=== Cohomological spectral sequences ===
For a spectral sequence formula_251 of cohomological type, the analogous statements hold. If formula_271 for every &quot;q&quot; &lt; 0, then there is a sequence of epimorphisms
:formula_272.
And if formula_271 for every &quot;p&quot; &lt; 0, then there is a sequence of monomorphisms:
:formula_274.
The transgression is a not necessarily well-defined map:
:formula_275
induced by formula_276.

=== Application ===
Determining these maps are fundamental for computing many differentials in the Serre spectral sequence. For instance the transgression map determines the differential
:formula_277
for the homological spectral spectral sequence, hence on the Serre spectral sequence for a fibration formula_47 gives the map
:formula_279.

<text>Micromonospora is a genus of bacteria of the family Micromonosporaceae. The genus name was first proposed in 1923 by Danish physician Jeppe Ørskov in an attempt to classify what at the time was considered &quot;ray fungi&quot; based on morphology. Members of this genus are found throughout natural soil and sediment environments, as well as in association with roots of plants of various species. The genus is well known for its ability to produce a variety of medically relevant products.

They are gram-positive, spore-forming, generally aerobic, and form a branched mycelium; they occur as saprotrophic forms in soil and water. Various species are sources of aminoglycoside antibiotics with spellings that end with &quot;-micin&quot;, such as gentamicin, mutamicin, netilmicin, retymicin, sisomicin, verdamicin, calicheamicin, and the recently found &quot;turbinmicin&quot;. Potent new antifungal drugs discovered in the microbiome of marine animals, unlike most other aminoglycoside names that end with &quot;-mycin&quot; (e.g. neo&quot;mycin&quot; and strepto&quot;mycin&quot; and are produced by &quot;Streptomyces&quot; spp.).

<doc id="803898" wikidata="Q738740" url="?curid=803898" title="The Nomad Soul">
<text>The Nomad Soul (known as Omikron: The Nomad Soul in North America) is an adventure game developed by Quantic Dream and published by Eidos Interactive. It was released for Microsoft Windows in 1999 and Dreamcast in 2000. The player can engage in unarmed and armed combat, explore the three-dimensional environment of Omikron City, and talk with non-player characters to progress the story. It follows an investigation into a case of serial killings, which unravels the supernatural truth behind the city&#x27;s ancient history.

Director David Cage began writing the script in 1994 and signed a publishing deal with Eidos in 1997. David Bowie made the music with Reeves Gabrels, producing ten original songs. The game was finished after two-and-a-half years. Reviewers praised the graphics, soundtrack, story, character models, reincarnation mechanic, voice acting, and combat, but criticised the controls, loading times, and multiple gameplay styles. It was nominated for various awards and sold over 600,000 copies, with low sales in North America. A sequel was planned but cancelled.

==Gameplay==
&quot;The Nomad Soul&quot; is an adventure game played from third-person and side-on perspectives in unarmed combat, and first-person view in armed fighting. The player may explore the three-dimensional environment of Omikron by walking, running, using vehicles known as Sliders, or taking elevators to reach apartments and offices. Combat, speed, dodging, and resistance to damage improve with practice. The fighting controls allow the player to strafe, jump, crouch, punch, and kick. Special moves can be performed through certain combinations. To cross bodies of water, swimming sequences can be triggered, which expends oxygen. Physical exertion depletes energy, which is repleted with Medikits, food, drinks, or special potions. In the event of death (and eventually at will), the player is reincarnated into the body of the first non-player character (NPC) that interacts with them; there are more than forty people to inhabit. Mana levels signify the ability to cast spells and are increased with potions.

Reading messages, talking to NPCs, and collecting items is crucial for the player to progress. They are provided with a computer terminal known as SNEAK, which is mostly used to access character information, call Sliders, open the inventory, and retrieve facts that are vital to story progression. Objects can be used, examined, and stored in the inventory. Magic rings allow the player to save the game at special points and buy advice for key information about NPCs to advance the story. Seteks, Omikronian currency, can be spent on things like consumables, better weapons, and advice. If the SNEAK inventory is full, items can be transferred or deposited into the Multiplan Virtual Locker, a larger inventory.

==Synopsis==
===Setting===
&quot;The Nomad Soul&quot; is set in a futuristic city known as Omikron, which is a densely populated metropolis on the world of Phaenon. Omikron exists beneath an enormous crystal dome, which was constructed to protect against the ice age that Phaenon entered into after its sun&#x27;s extinction. The city is split into different sectors: Anekbah, Qalisar, Jaunpur, Jahangir, and Lahoreh. Because it is forbidden for the inhabitants to leave their respective sectors, each area has developed independently, which is reflected by the divergent lifestyles and architecture.

===Plot===
At the start of the game, the player is asked by an Omikronian police officer named Kay&#x27;l 669 to leave their dimension and enter Omikron within his body. After doing so, the player continues with the investigation of serial killings that Kay&#x27;l and his partner were originally working on. The player begins the investigation in the Anekbah sector, where they uncover information that suggests the serial killer they are looking for is not human, but actually a demon. Members of an apparent underground, anti-government movement contact the player and confirm their suspicions. The investigation deepens and uncovers further information; one of Omikron&#x27;s chief police commanders, Commandant Gandhar, is a demon pretending to be human and luring human souls into Omikron from other dimensions by way of &quot;The Nomad Soul&quot;. Kay&#x27;l 669 asking the player to help him turned out to be a trap: supposedly, if the in-game character dies, the real human playing the video game will lose their soul forever. Despite many assassination attempts on the protagonist&#x27;s life by other demons working behind the scenes, the player destroys Gandhar with supernatural weaponry.

After this brief victory, the anti-government movement is revealed to be named &quot;The Awakened&quot;, who invite the player to join them. They work in tandem with an ancient religious order led by Boz, a mystical being that exists in purely electronic form on the computer networks of Omikron. The Awakened refer to the protagonist as the &quot;Nomad Soul&quot;, since they have the ability to change bodies at will. The Nomad Soul learns afterwards that what is going on in Omikron is merely an extension of an old battle between mankind and demons spearheaded by the powerful Astaroth. Astaroth, who was banished to the depths of Omikron long ago, is slowly regenerating power while using demons to both collect souls and impersonate high members of the government. The Nomad Soul harnesses ancient, magical technology in order to destroy Astaroth. They return to their own dimension, and prevent their soul from being captured by demons.

==Development and release==

Director David Cage, having grown tired of his 15-year-long career as a composer, started writing &quot;The Nomad Soul&quot; in 1994. The script resulted in a 200-page document, which was distributed to his contacts in the music business, who said the idea was &quot;technically impossible&quot;. In an act of defiance, Cage hired a team of friends with development experience and turned one of his isolation booths into an office. They had a deadline of six months until the money ran out, by which time the goal was to have a game engine and prototype. In the last week, Cage travelled to London and called Eidos Interactive, who invited him for a meeting. Eidos was so impressed with the demonstration and script that the publishing deal was signed by noon the next day. &quot;The Nomad Soul&quot; entered full production one month later. Two months after that, a prototype was displayed at the Electronic Entertainment Expo.

With &quot;The Nomad Soul&quot;, Cage wanted to create &quot;a movie-like experience - with total immersion&quot; and mix multiple genres. He was initially hesitant to introduce a first-person perspective as it gave him headaches, but implemented it at Eidos&#x27; request. Cage had written down names of artists he wanted to work with, including Björk, Massive Attack, Archive, and David Bowie. At the behest of Eidos&#x27; senior designer Philip Campbell, Bowie was ultimately solicited for the music, which was done with assistance from guitarist Reeves Gabrels. Bowie produced ten original songs and spent two weeks in Paris for design sessions. He portrayed a character named Boz and the lead singer of an in-game band playing gigs around Omikron City; Gabrels and musician Gail Ann Dorsey also lent their likenesses. Cage spent thirty hours doing motion capture for each concert. Bowie&#x27;s priority was to imbue the game with &quot;emotional subtext&quot; and regarded this as a success. Fashion model Iman, Bowie&#x27;s wife, played a character the player can reincarnate into. Xavier Despas composed ambient and additional tracks. The game took two-and-a-half years to complete.

&quot;The Nomad Soul&quot; was renamed &quot;Omikron: The Nomad Soul&quot; in North America. It was released for Microsoft Windows on 1 November 1999 in North America, on 5 November in Europe, and on 19 November in Australia. The game was ported for the Dreamcast, with release dates reported for 22 June (NA), 23 June (EU), and 30 June 2000 (AU). It sold more than 600,000 copies, between 400,000 and 500,000 of which came from Europe. Cage blamed the low sales in North America on Eidos&#x27; lack of support in that market. A PlayStation version, planned for May 2000, was cancelled after seventy percent of it had been completed. The game was also cancelled for PlayStation 2. After Bowie&#x27;s death in 2016, &quot;The Nomad Soul&quot; was made available at no cost for one week.

==Reception==

&quot;The Nomad Soul&quot; was nominated as the best personal computer adventure game of 1999 by &quot;CNET Gamecenter&quot;, &quot;The Electric Playground&quot;, and &quot;GameSpot&quot;, losing variously to &quot;Gabriel Knight 3&quot;, &quot;Spy Fox 2&quot;, and &quot;Outcast&quot;. It was also nominated for &quot;Outstanding Achievement in Character or Story Development&quot; during the 3rd Annual Interactive Achievement Awards in 2000, losing to &quot;Age of Empires II: The Age of Kings&quot; and &quot;&quot; (both of which tied for the award).

Reviewing the Dreamcast version, Glenn Wigmore of &quot;AllGame&quot; held the game to be &quot;unique&quot;, writing that the execution of its real-time graphics was done well and that, ultimately, &quot;the game looks solid and creates the atmosphere of a giant, dark, and tangible world&quot;. He enjoyed the characters&#x27; varied, fleshed out demeanour, and good voice acting. The combat also appealed to Wigmore, who called it &quot;fun&quot;. &quot;AllGame&quot;″s Chris Couper said in his PC review that &quot;The Nomad Soul&quot; was &quot;by leaps, bounds and great units of measurement, [his] favorite game of 1999&quot;. He regarded the story as &quot;fascinating&quot;, the graphics as &quot;amazing&quot;, and the soundtrack as &quot;breathtaking&quot;. The most innovative part of the game, according to Couper, was that it allowed the player to reincarnate into other characters&#x27; bodies. &quot;Eurogamer&quot; was impressed with Omikron&#x27;s atmospheric, &quot;futuristic cityscape&quot;, thinking well of the general story. &quot;Game Revolution&quot; declared &quot;The Nomad Soul&quot; the first game to approach total immersion, thus calling it the &quot;best single player gaming experience&quot; of 1999. &quot;Game Revolution&quot; termed the story &quot;deeply engaging&quot;, the ability to solve individual problems through multiple paths &quot;refreshing&quot;, the graphical effects &quot;simply gorgeous&quot;, the character models &quot;striking&quot;, and sound effects and voice acting &quot;generally excellent&quot;. The in-game movie sequences were similarly praised. Like Couper, &quot;Game Revolution&quot; liked the musical score, dubbing it &quot;atmospheric&quot;. &quot;GamePro&quot;, evaluating it on the Dreamcast, was pleased with the setting and music. Having played the PC version, &quot;GamePro&quot;″s Nash Werner observed that, at its best, the game was &quot;a fresh approach to a neglected adventure-gaming genre&quot;. He likened the graphics to &quot;Blade Runner&quot; and Tim Burton&#x27;s art style, deemed the score to be &quot;incredible&quot; and key to the atmosphere, and considered the gameplay &quot;smooth&quot;. Ryan Mac Donald, writing the Dreamcast review for &quot;GameSpot&quot;, found the story good enough to maintain the player&#x27;s interest throughout. He saw the controls as &quot;adequate&quot; and agreed that the game boasted &quot;impressive&quot; graphics as well as a &quot;wonderful&quot; soundtrack. Greg Kasavin&#x27;s PC review, also for &quot;GameSpot&quot;, admired the character models, their realistic portrayal of emotion, and voice acting. Kasavin additionally liked the graphics engine for its high-quality rendering of enemies, weapon effects, and architecture in first-person view. &quot;IGN&quot;″s Jeremy Dunham reviewed the Dreamcast version, which he noted as a &quot;unique experience&quot;, saying the graphics looked better than on the PC. He praised the soundtrack, calling it like &quot;something out of a modern-day cyber punk flick&quot;. He also echoed Couper&#x27;s view that the reincarnation mechanic was one of the game&#x27;s most innovative features. Vincent Lopez&#x27;s PC review at &quot;IGN&quot; lauded the &quot;fun, but simple&quot; first-person mode, preferring unarmed combat for its combos and animation. What impressed him the most was the adult manner in which he felt the story was handled. He too saw the graphics as &quot;incredible&quot;; the soundtrack was similarly commended. Greg Vederman of &quot;PC Gamer&quot; thought the gameplay was fun, especially the third-person exploration.

Conversely, Wigmore noted that some details were &quot;a tad rough&quot;, while also faulting the &quot;low&quot; colour palette. He blamed the character&#x27;s lack of agility on &quot;sluggish&quot; controls and deducted the game for its lengthy loading times. &quot;Eurogamer&quot; criticised the uniformity of the NPCs, vehicles, and artificial intelligence. Like Wigmore, &quot;Eurogamer&quot; disliked the controls, which were found to worsen the first-person sequences. Also subject to reproval were the save game system, &quot;pretentious silliness&quot; in the narrative, reincarnation mechanic, substandard graphics, and &quot;blocky and often poorly animated&quot; character models. Despite lauding the story, &quot;Game Revolution&quot; admitted it was &quot;a little clichéd&quot;, while also decrying armed and unarmed combat as &quot;noticeably low on flash&quot; compared to other games. &quot;GamePro&quot; disparaged the execution of the game modes, agreeing with others on the &quot;universally awkward&quot; controls. Loading &quot;hiccups&quot; were also disapproved of. Werner stated that, at its worst, &quot;The Nomad Soul&quot; was &quot;your typical puzzle hunt with non-player characters that can often be annoying&quot;. He thought the models were &quot;blocky&quot; and their textures &quot;murky&quot; or &quot;blurry&quot;. Donald noted that Quantic Dream&#x27;s incorporation of various styles was a failure and became disillusioned with the promise of an immersive world, judging it instead as &quot;little more than a polygonal prop&quot;. The action sequences were criticised for their repetitiveness. Kasavin took the same view as Donald on the implementation of multiple gameplay styles, calling them &quot;ineffective&quot;. He questioned the originality of the world, considered the character animations &quot;stilted and unrealistic&quot;, dismissed the unarmed combat as &quot;silly&quot; compared to other fighting games, and diverged from others on the soundtrack, saying it lacked variety. Dunham wrote that &quot;The Nomad Soul&quot; was best described as &quot;&quot;Messiah&quot; and &quot;Shenmue&quot;″s illegitimate child&quot;, disregarding the Dreamcast version as an &quot;obviously rushed&quot; port. Though initially impressed with the reincarnation mechanic, he grew tired of it near the end. Lopez mentioned the frame rate as one &quot;serious problem&quot; he encountered, especially in first-person mode. Vederman stated that the first-person and side-on segments looked and played &quot;rather poorly&quot;.

==Sequel==
By January 2000, a sequel was in the early stages of development, then scheduled to be released by 2001. It went under the titles &quot;Nomad Soul: Exodus&quot; and &quot;Omikron 2: Karma&quot; and was planned for Microsoft Windows, PlayStation 3, and Xbox 360. After the release of &quot;Fahrenheit&quot;, the project was still in discussion, but ultimately scrapped in favour of &quot;Heavy Rain&quot;.

== Legacy ==
In December 2021, shortly after the emergence of the SARS-CoV-2 Omicron variant, a cutscene featuring David Bowie&#x27;s character encouraging a government uprising went viral on Twitter, leading to a resurgence in popularity thanks to the game&#x27;s North America title, themes, and storyline. Misinformation on Bill Gates&#x27; being involved in the game began to spread in an attempt to connect it with conspiracy theories that he was responsible for the virus.

<text>Kingu, also spelled Qingu (, d kin-gu, ), was a god in Babylonian mythology, and the son of the gods Abzu and Tiamat. After the murder of his father, Apsu, he served as the consort of his mother, Tiamat, who wanted to establish him as ruler and leader of all gods before she was killed by Marduk. Tiamat gave Kingu the Tablet of Destinies, which he wore as a breastplate and which gave him great power. She placed him as the general of her army. However, like Tiamat, Kingu was eventually killed by Marduk. Marduk used Kingu&#x27;s blood to create the first human beings, while Tiamat&#x27;s body created the earth and the skies.

<text>Henry Carter Stuart (January 18, 1855July 24, 1933) was an American businessman and politician from Virginia. Between 1914 and 1918, he served as the 47th Governor of Virginia, a period which encompassed World War I.

==Early and family life==
The eldest of seven sons born to William Alexander Stuart and his wife Mary Taylor Carter Stuart, Henry Carter Stuart was born in Wytheville, Virginia. He also had an elder sister, Eliza, who died in 1862. The family owned thousands of acres of ranch land in southwest Virginia, built over generations, including through marriage alliances. Henry Carter Stuart ultimately lived at East Rosedale, a mansion which a maternal ancestor had purchased from Patrick Henry in 1774, and which had been a fort guarding the Clinch River valley during the American Revolutionary War. His paternal grandfather, Archibald Stuart, a lawyer and U.S. Congressman, had several sons, one of whom (Henry&#x27;s uncle) became Confederate Civil War Cavalry Commander Jeb Stuart.

A graduate of Emory and Henry College (1874), Henry married his cousin, Margaret Bruce Carter in 1896, but they had no children. His nephew of the same name, but nicknamed Harry Carter Stuart, son of this Stuart&#x27;s brother and business partner Dale Carter Stuart, later became a Virginia State Senator and was active in the Massive Resistance movement.

==Career==
Stuart was born to wealth, and became wealthier. Upon their father&#x27;s death in 1893, he and his brothers Alexander (&quot;Zan&quot;) and Dale Carter Stuart took over their father&#x27;s salt company (which by then had become a cattle company). They built Stuart Land &amp; Cattle Company into the largest cattle company east of the Mississippi River, with 50,000 agricultural acres in four counties. Generations of fathers and sons worked for the company, and many lived in its semi-feudal company towns which attempted to control their access to liquor. The cattle company and other Stuart enterprises also controlled extensive coal and timber reserves. Ironically, Henry Stuart&#x27;s only child, Mary Fulton, rebelled against her father&#x27;s country lifestyle and values.

Stuart started his political activity in 1893, after their father&#x27;s death. He organizing a statewide referendum for popular election of senators because his favorite candidate, Fitzhugh Lee (former governor and a nephew of Robert E. Lee) had not been selected for U.S. Senate from Virginia by the Virginia General Assembly, which instead elevated an obscure railroad attorney, Thomas Staples Martin. Over the years, Stuart became more aligned with the Democratic political machine run by Martin, but favored farmers more than railroads. Thus, Stuart at the State Corporation Commission regulated railroads and increased what had been extremely low corporate taxes, all of which were popular statewide.

As Russell County&#x27;s delegate to the Virginia Constitutional Convention of 1901-1902, Stuart helped reform the Reconstruction Era Underwood constitution in many ways. However the new 1902 Constitution also instituted poll taxes and other requirements which disenfranchised many African Americans and poor whites, but facilitated the growth of the Martin political machine, which later became the Byrd Organization. Stuart also served in the State Corporation Commission from 1902 to 1908. Although Stuart wanted to run for governor in 1909, he acceded to Martin&#x27;s advice and instead ran for U.S. Congress, but lost to six-term Republican Campbell Bascom Slemp.

In return for that party loyalty, Martin allowed Stuart to run for governor unopposed. Governor Stuart promoted a statewide referendum that prohibited alcohol sales. He also appointed a commission that in 1919 revised the Virginia Code (for the first time in 1887), as well as enacted legislation which rationalized taxation, so local counties could tax real estate and the state other forms of property. This raised state revenues by almost $750,000. in 1915, Stuart endorsed the state senatorial bid of Harry F. Byrd, who a decade later would control what had been the Martin organization. World War I became the major event in Stuart&#x27;s administration, and he encouraged Virginians to grow food in home gardens to support the national war effort. Stuart also declared martial law in Hopewell, Virginia, a boom town that grew around a munitions plant.

After Stuart&#x27;s gubernatorial term ended, he served on the federal War Industries Board, then in 1921 formed the &quot;Pay as You Go Roads Association&quot; which fought issuance of road construction bonds to build better highways. The bond-financed highway construction of the Virginia Turnpike System in the area before the Civil War had been disastrous, and led to many bankruptcies.

==Election==
1913; Stuart was elected Governor of Virginia with 91.87% of the vote, defeating Socialist C. Campbell and Socialist Labor B.D. Downey.

==Death and legacy==
After Henry Carter Stuart&#x27;s death, the mansion he built in the valley of the Elk Garden River and lived in remained in the Stuart family until 1945. However, &quot;East Rosedale&quot; burned to the ground after a lightning storm in 2002.

<doc id="803916" wikidata="Q2189798" url="?curid=803916" title="Hadlow">
<text>Hadlow is a village and civil parish in the borough of Tonbridge and Malling in Kent, England. It is situated in the Medway valley, north-east of Tonbridge and south-west of Maidstone.

The Saxon name for the settlement was Haeselholte (in the Textus Roffensis). The Domesday Book records it as Haslow and in the Middle Ages it became Hadloe and then Hadlow.

==History==

Evidence of settlement in the Hadlow area dates back to the Stone Age implements, which have been found near the village.
The Domesday entry for the village reads:-
:&quot;Richard de Tonebridge holds of the bishop (of Baieux) Haslow. It was taxed at six sulings. The arable land is twelve carucates. In demesne there are three, and forty-seven villeins, with fifteen borderers, having fifteen carucates. There is a church and ten servants, and two mills of eleven shillings, and twelve fisheries of seven shillings and six-pence, and twelve acres of meadow, Wood for the pannage of sixty hogs. In the time of king Edward the Confessor, and afterwards, and now, it was and is worth thirty pounds. Eddeva held it of king Edward.&quot;

During the Middle Ages the manor of Hadlow was owned by the Knights Hospitallers, then the Earls of Gloucester, followed by the Earls of Stafford, who were elevated to the Dukes of Buckingham in 1444. The third Duke of Buckingham was executed in 1521, and the manor went through a series of ownership changes. Sir Henry Guildford being granted the manor by Henry VIII, and the manor passed back to the Crown on his death, it was then granted to the Duke of Northumberland, and again returned to the Crown. in 1558, Henry Carey, the first Baron Hunsdon, received it from Elizabeth I, later passing to his two sons, one of whom Sir George Carey, owned the manor in 1586 The manor house was called Court Lodge at this time.
Early in the 17th century, it was sold to James Faircloth, a London Physician. He sold it to George Rivers, second son of Sir George Rivers of Chafford. A new manor house, Hadlow Court Lodge was built c.1635. The Rivers family also owned Fish Hall, Tonbridge, which was in the possession of the Fane family during the time of Henry VIII but was later bought by the Rivers. In 1657 the manor was the property of Sir Thomas Rivers. but it was sold, along with Fish Hall, during the reign of Charles II to Jeffrey Amherst. He sold the manor and Fish Hall to John France in 1700. John France had two daughters, Sarah (baptised 1700) and Elizabeth (baptised 1703). They shared the estate upon the death of their father, Elizabeth taking Fish Hall, and Sarah taking Hadlow manor. Sarah married Walter Barton. Their first son, John, was born deaf, blind and dumb. Their second son, Walter, inherited a large fortune from his uncle Richard May in 1763, on condition that he took the surname May. Walter May married Elizabeth Stanford of Strettit Place, East Peckham in 1775. He inherited Hadlow Court Lodge in 1786 and immediately set to work demolishing Hadlow Court Lodge and building Hadlow Castle.
His son Walter Barton May added a high folly in 1835. The folly was damaged in the Great Storm of 1987. Being Grade 1 Listed and previously being included in the 1998 World Monuments Watch List of 100 Most Endangered Sites by the World Monuments Fund, the owner of the folly was issued with a Compulsory Purchase Order by Tonbridge and Malling Borough Council in July 2006.

The main village street is brick-paved and there are several old houses and two Tudor inns. Hadlow Pharmacy on The Square has a history which can be traced back to at least 1856. The River Bourne flows through the parish, and formerly powered a watermill in the village (Bourne mill), which has been the home of Carr &amp; Westley since they moved from London during the blitz and two in Golden Green (Goldhill Mill and Pierce Mill). A set of Hopper huts from North Frith Farm has been dismantled and re-erected at the Museum of Kent Life, Sandling.

The village&#x27;s amateur dramatic society, Hadlow Amateur Dramatic Society (HADS), have been performing pantomimes and dramatic pieces to Hadlow for over 30 years.

==Churches==

The church is dedicated to St. Mary, and was first mentioned in 975, thus it celebrated 1000 years in 1975. Hadlow was given to Eddeva in 1018, and parts of the church date to this time. The tower dates to the thirteenth century or earlier. The main door of the church has the date 1637 on it. This is often misread as 1037 due to most of the upper part of the first 6 being missing. The clock, by John Thwaites of Clerkenwell, dates from 1791. In the churchyard is a 19th-century memorial to the drowning locally of 30 hop-pickers.

Other churches and chapels in Hadlow include a Baptist Chapel in Court Lane, which was built in 1830. The Catholic chapel on Maidstone Road is dedicated to St. Peter. In Golden Green there was a Wesleyan chapel which opened in 1899 and closed in 1956. A tin tabernacle had been built in Golden Green by 1882, as of 2024, it remains standing.

==Breweries==

Hadlow had working breweries between the early eighteenth century and the late 1940s. The earliest reference to a brewery in Hadlow is in 1710 when John Barton, Yeoman of Hadlow is mentioned in connection with a newly erected malthouse in Hadlow Street. In 1840 there was a complaint that the drain leading from the Close Brewery was a nuisance.

In 1851 the brewery was being run by Messrs Harrison &amp; Taylor and in 1858 they sold the business to Edward Kenward of Marden and William Barnett of Willingdon, Sussex . Thomas Simmonds of East Peckham and Nelson Kenward were also parties, part purchasing and part leasing the brewery. in 1859 it was agreed that a new 15 quarter malthouse would be erected. This building being the one nearly parallel to the High Street. In 1868 Edward Kenward was bankrupt, owing £9,500. The partnership was dissolved in that year by mutual consent. Edward and Trayton Kenward then became partners, but this partnership was also dissolved and all properties assigned to Trayton Kenward.
In October 1871, Trayton and Charles Kenward entered into partnership with John Court. The business operating under the name of Kenward &amp; Court. Sometime after this a second maltings was added, this running alongside Carpenters Lane. In 1881 the brewery supplied 68 public houses and was listed as 637th in the list of the first thousand limited companies. Kenward &amp; Court was taken over by Charles Hammerton &amp; Co. Ltd. in 1945. Beer was last brewed in September 1949. In 1952 Hammerton&#x27;s was bought out by Watney&#x27;s, who then sold the brewery to Charrington&#x27;s. Malting continued for several years and the brewery closed in the late 1960s, having been used as a distribution centre towards the end. The buildings gradually became derelict through the 1970s, and the Hadlow Society pressed for the buildings to be listed, which was done in July 1979. There was much debate within the village as to whether the buildings should be demolished or converted. The buildings were converted into flats in 1990.

In 2005, Harvey&#x27;s of Lewes brewed &quot;Hadlow Ale&quot; to commemorate Kenward &amp; Court and celebrate the reopening of the now closed Two Brewers pub (formerly the &quot;Fiddling Monkey&quot; and before that the &quot;Albion&quot;). The buildings are Grade II listed.

Another brewery stood at Style Place, Hadlow. This brewery was started in the 1830s by William Simmons, being in partnership with Henry Simmons in 1852 with William Martin joining them by 1855. The business was sold to Messrs Style &amp; Winch of Chatham in 1863. The brewery buildings have been converted to housing and are now known as &quot;Caxton Place&quot;. The surviving building is Grade II listed.

==Education==
Hadlow College of Agriculture and Horticulture was established in 1968. It is concerned with a wide range of land-based training including agriculture, horticulture, medicinal horticulture, landscape management, garden design, equine management, animal management and sciences, sports fisheries and countryside management.

Hadlow Rural Community School is a secondary school that was established in the village in 2013 as part of the free schools programme.

Hadlow Primary School is located on School Lane and has 7 classes, one form entry, and approx 200 pupils. The school has a large playing field and is currently fundraising for a new community swimming pool.

==Hadlow Cricket Club==
Hadlow Cricket Club dates back to the mid-eighteenth century. Cricket is still played in Hadlow, the ground being located off Common Road, to the north of the village.

==Notable people==

<text>Parthenium argentatum, commonly known as the guayule ( or , as in Spanish), is a perennial woody shrub in the family Asteraceae that is native to the rangeland area of the Chihuahuan Desert; including the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It was first documented by J.M. Bigelow in 1852 through the Mexican Boundary Survey and was first described by Asa Gray. Natural rubber, ethanol, non-toxic adhesives, and other specialty chemicals can be extracted from guayule. An alternative source of latex that is hypoallergenic, unlike the normal &quot;Hevea&quot; rubber, can also be extracted. While &quot;Castilla elastica&quot; was the most widely used rubber source of Mesoamericans in pre-Columbian times, guayule was also used, though less frequently. The name &quot;guayule&quot; derives from the Nahuatl word &quot;ulli/olli&quot;, &quot;rubber&quot;.

==Description and range ==
Guayule grows in rocky, limestone desert areas in full sun. The plant&#x27;s outer branches and leaves are covered in fine silvery hairs called trichomes, and yellow-white flowers grow from stems at the top of the plant. The densely haired leaves are covered with white wax to help prevent drying. The plant has an extensive root system, which lends to its drought resistance. One taproot extends down, while lateral roots extend from the taproot to the side. In some plants, lateral roots are longer than the taproot while in other plants, the opposite is true. U.S. indigenous populations of guayule occur in the Trans Pecos region of southwestern Texas. It can also be found in the low desert regions of Arizona, New Mexico, and some parts of Southern California and the Mexican states of Zacatecas, Coahuila, Chihuahua, San Luis Potosí, Nuevo León, and Tamaulipas and is able to be cultivated in similar climates around the world.

==Breeding and production==
Guayule breeding programs have been facilitated in order to domesticate, commercialize, and develop higher yielding cultivars. Selection of high-yielding guayule is complicated by its breeding system, which is primarily apomixis (asexual cloning via gametes). This breeding system is somewhat variable and considerable genetic variation exists within wild populations. Selection of high-yielding lines has been successful.

&quot;Parthenium argentatum&quot; is adapted for hot desert environments and grows well in well-drained, desert-like soil. It has been cultivated under both dryland and irrigated conditions. It can be grown in areas where annual rainfall ranges between and with temperatures rarely falling below . Due to the guayule plant&#x27;s production of terpene resins, which are natural pesticides, it is resistant to many pests and diseases. Nonetheless, its slow growth from seed means herbicides are needed for stand establishment.

==History==

In the 1920s, the plant saw a brief and intense amount of agricultural research when the Intercontinental Rubber Company in California produced 1400 tons of rubber after South American Leaf Blight decimated the Brazilian rubber industry. Guayule would again become a replacement for &quot;Hevea&quot; tree-produced latex during World War II when Japan cut off America&#x27;s Malaysian latex resources. The war ended before large-scale farming of the guayule plant began, and the project was scrapped, as it was cheaper to import tree-derived latex than to crush the shrubs for a smaller amount of latex.

Currently, PanAridus and Yulex are the only commercial producers of guayule natural rubber in the world. Yulex have partnered with Patagonia who are now making its Yulex wetsuit from Guayule derived plant stems in a 60/40 blend (60% guayule, 40% neoprene), reducing dependence on conventional neoprene.

In 2011, Howard Colvin led a successful $6.9 million DOE-funded Biomass R&amp;D Initiative to produce and test an all-guayule tire.

In October 2015, the Bridgestone Corporation announced the creation of the first tires made entirely of guayule rubber, having built an experimental farm and biorubber research center in Mesa, Arizona the previous year. The guayule is grown in Mesa and Eloy, Arizona.

In 2022, IndyCar announced the use of eco-friendly guayule-derived rubber tires.

=== Hypoallergenic properties ===
In the 1980s, a surge of Type 1 latex allergy coincided with a world-wide increase in demand for latex gloves in response to heightened precautions to prevent the spread of diseases, such as AIDS and Hepatitis B. While &quot;Hevea&quot;-derived rubber contains proteins that can cause severe allergic reactions in some people, guayule does not. Although there are synthetic alternatives for medical device products, they are not as elastic as natural rubber. Guayule performs like &quot;Hevea&quot; but contains none of the proteins related to latex allergies. In 1997, a process to make hypoallergenic guayule latex was licensed by the U.S. Department of Agriculture to the Yulex Corporation.

==Biofuel==
Guayule&#x27;s viability as a potential biofuel has been enhanced recently in light of commentary from a variety of experts, including Lester R. Brown of the Earth Policy Institute, stating that &quot;[food based] biofuels pit the 800 million people with cars against the 800 million people with hunger problems,&quot; meaning that biofuels derived from food crops (like maize) raise world food prices. Guayule can be an economically viable biofuel crop that does not increase the world&#x27;s hunger problem. Guayule has another benefit over food crops as biofuel - it can be grown in areas where food crops struggle.

<text>Ernulf (1040 – 15 March 1124) was a French Benedictine monk who became prior of Christ Church in Canterbury, abbot of Peterborough, and bishop of Rochester in England. A jurist and an architect as well, he was responsible for greatly expanding Canterbury Cathedral during his time there.

==Life==
Ernulf was born in 1040 in Beauvais, France. He studied under Lanfranc at the monastery of Bec, entered the Benedictine Order, and lived at the , Beauvais. At the suggestion of Lanfranc, he went to England some time after 1070 and joined the monks of Canterbury. He studied under Ivo of Chartres and was considered an expert on canon law.

Ernulf was made prior by Archbishop Anselm in 1096 and began the expansion of Lanfranc&#x27;s rebuilt Canterbury Cathedral, taking down the eastern part of the church which Lanfranc had built and erecting a far more magnificent structure. This included the famous crypt (Our Lady of the Undercroft), as far as Trinity Tower. The chancel was finished by his successor Conrad. The chapel of St. Andrew is also part of Ernulf&#x27;s work. In 1107, he was made Abbot of Peterborough, where he was one of the teachers of Hugh Candidus. On 28 September 1114, he was invested as bishop of Rochester by Ralph d&#x27;Escures, the archbishop of Canterbury. He was consecrated on 26 December 1115. At Peterborough and Rochester, Ernulf had the old buildings torn down and erected new dormitories, refectories, chapter houses, etc.

Ernulf is associated with the production of the &quot;Textus Roffensis&quot; (a large collection of documents relating to the early Church of Rochester which also included the early Kentish law code attributed to King Aethelberht); &quot;Collectanea de rebus eccl. Ruffensis&quot;. The collection reflects his interest in and sympathy towards pre-Conquest traditions apparent elsewhere. Aspects of Anglo-Saxon liturgical practice were revived at Canterbury and he may also have influenced the restoration of the shrines and altars to Anglo-Saxon saints to their former prominence during the development of the Cathedral. His abbacy at Peterborough additionally seems to have coincided with renewed interest in the &quot;Anglo-Saxon Chronicle&quot; there. He also authored several canonical and theological treatises.

Ernulf died on 15 March 1124.

<text>The Pima Air &amp; Space Museum is an aerospace museum in Tucson, Arizona, US. It features a display of nearly 400 aircraft spread out over on a campus occupying . It has also been the home to the Arizona Aviation Hall of Fame since 1991.

==Overview==
A large number of the museum&#x27;s aircraft are displayed outside with the remainder located in one of the museum&#x27;s six display hangars. In addition to the display hangars, the museum has a restoration hangar.

Opened to the public in May 1976 with 48 aircraft then on display, the museum&#x27;s main hangar houses an SR-71A Blackbird, an A-10 Warthog, a United States Air Force &quot;Through the Years&quot; exhibit, and a mock-up of a control tower.

The museum is adjacent to Davis-Monthan Air Force Base. The 309th Aerospace Maintenance and Regeneration Group (AMARG), affiliated with the base, also known as the &quot;Graveyard of Planes&quot; or &quot;The Boneyard&quot;, is the largest aircraft storage and preservation facility in the world.

==History==
The museum opened to the public on May 8, 1976. In early 1982 the first hangar on the site was completed. A second was built in 1987, a third in 1992, and a fourth in 1994. After running into difficulty in the late 1990s, the museum recovered and continued expanding.

In 2012, the museum collaborated with artists, in &quot;The Boneyard Project&quot;, to place some abandoned aircraft on display as canvases for art.

During 2015, Boeing donated to the museum a flight test 787 aircraft which is the second built. It is exhibited in the colors of the 787 customer, ANA.

In November 2016, Orbis International donated their first McDonnell-Douglas DC-10 Flying Eye Hospital to the museum, after receiving a second DC-10 from FedEx. The DC-10, which was the oldest flying example of its type and at the time of its donation, while being the oldest surviving example and the second overall built, was restored for display at Davis–Monthan Air Force Base.

The museum acquired in January 2021 for the construction of the Tucson Military Vehicle Museum. The new museum will house a large number of mostly land vehicles, including 50 donated by the Imperial War Museum.

==Selected aircraft on display==
Out of a collection of 400 aircraft, these are the most prominent:
* Boeing 777 (B-HNL)
* Boeing B-17 Flying Fortress
* Boeing B-29 Superfortress
* Consolidated B-24 Liberator
* Convair B-36J Peacemaker
* English Electric Lightning
* Lockheed SR-71 Blackbird

* Martin PBM Mariner
* North American F-107
* Aero Spacelines Super Guppy 
* N747GE (Boeing 747 based engine testbed)
* Boeing 787
* McDonnell Douglas DC-10 (Originally Orbis Flying Eye Hospital)

 B-17G serial number 44-85828 is on display at the 390th Memorial Museum, co-located on the grounds of the Pima Air &amp; Space Museum.

In addition to other ephemera, the museum contains the Shuttle Mission Simulator&#x27;s GNS (Guidance and Navigation Simulator) trainer, and a full-size mockup of the Solid Rocket Booster.

<doc id="803934" wikidata="Q1799161" url="?curid=803934" title="Textus Roffensis">
<text>The &#x27; (Latin for &quot;The Tome of Rochester&quot;), fully titled the Textus de Ecclesia Roffensi per Ernulphum episcopum&quot; (&quot;The Tome of the [[Rochester Cathedral|Church of Rochester]] up to [[Ernulf|Bishop Ernulf]]&quot;) and sometimes also known as theAnnals of Rochester&quot;&#x27;, is a mediaeval manuscript that consists of two separate works written between 1122 and 1124. It is catalogued as &quot;Rochester Cathedral Library, MS A.3.5&quot; and is currently on display in a new exhibition at Rochester Cathedral in Rochester, Kent. It is thought that the main text of both manuscripts was written by a single scribe, although the English glosses to the two Latin entries (items 23 and 24 in table below) were made by a second hand. The annotations might indicate that the manuscript was consulted in some post-Conquest trials. However, the glosses are very sparse and just clarify a few uncertain terms. For example, the entry on f. 67r merely explains that the is called in English, &quot;ofraceth ordel&quot; (insult ordeal = triple ordeal).

There is a clear, digitised version in the Rylands Medieval Collection.

==Contents==
The first part is a collection of laws and other, primarily secular documents, whilst the second is the cartulary of the Cathedral priory. The first part is of fundamental importance to the study of Anglo-Saxon law. It begins with the earliest surviving royal law-code, from King Æthelberht of Kent, dating to c 600, followed by those of two Kentish successors, the joint kings Hlothere and Eadric, c 679–85, and Wihtred, 695. This is the only manuscript source for these three laws, though Wihtred&#x27;s are heavily reliant on the laws of the contemporary West-Saxon King, Ine (see item 6 below). The full contents of the first part are:
The second part of &quot;Textus Roffensis&quot; is just over 100 pages long. It consists of the cartulary for Rochester Cathedral, in Latin. However, its final entry (222r–v) is in English, listing the number of masses to be recited for those institutions in England and Normandy which were in confraternity with Rochester.

==Name==
A &quot;textus&quot; was a book with a decorated cover suitable to be kept in the church by the high altar. The term does not mean a text concerning Rochester Cathedral. A &quot;liber&quot; was a less decorated book, suitable only for the cloister. It is rare that a secular book is a &quot;textus&quot;, and the name given to the &quot;Textus Roffensis&quot; by the cathedral is considered indicative of the book&#x27;s importance during the Middle Ages.

== The &quot;Textus Roffensis&quot; Scribe ==
The unknown scribe was remarkable for his knowledge of old forms of English, and was able to transcribe accurately from a range of original manuscripts written in Anglo-Saxon dialects, including the local Kentish used for the laws of the kings of Kent. Two or more generations after the Norman Conquest, this was distinctly unusual. Few of his records were contemporary and, to read the Laws of Aethelberht, he was looking back at an obsolete dialect of early Anglo-Saxon English, some 500 years old.

He followed standard practice of distinguishing between written English and written Latin. The overall aspect is Protogothic with, for example, narrow letter-forms and forked tops to ascenders. However, he used a modified Insular Minuscule for the English and a modified Caroline Minuscule for the Latin. This was standard practice in the years around 1000, but proficiency in writing Insular Minuscule was in terminal decline by the time of the &quot;Textus Roffensis&quot;.

The double-page opening of f95v and f96r is a good place to examine differences in the two scripts. The left-hand page contains the end of &quot;Hit becƿæð. ond becƿæl &quot; in English and the right-hand page the start of Henry I&#x27;s Coronation Charter, in Latin. It is not only the general letter-shapes which show some differences. In the English, the only abbreviations are the tironian &quot;et&quot; for &quot;ond&quot; and the suspensions on dative endings e.g. &quot;beÞinū/ beminū&quot; for &quot;–um&quot; (concerning yours/ - mine). The number of abbreviations, suspensions and ligatures in the Latin give a different look, accentuated by different letter-forms, such as &quot;g&quot;, &quot;h&quot; and &quot;r&quot; in &quot;gehyrde&quot; (f.95v, line 11) and &quot;erga uos habeo&quot; (f.96r, line 9); the &quot;f&quot; in &quot;forðam&quot; (English, line 10) and in &quot;facio&quot; (Latin, line 10)

The &quot;Roffensis&quot; scribe made remarkably few errors and only some minor edits which lightly modernise the text. This can be seen in the Laws of Ine. The original laws were written in the late seventh century. They were already updated when recorded in Alfred&#x27;s &quot;Domboc&quot; two centuries later. The earliest preserved version is from c. 925. In clause 2, this has &quot;Cild binnan ðritegum nihta sie gefulwad&quot; (&#x27;a child shall be baptised within thirty days&#x27;). The scribe substitutes for the tenth-century term for baptism () the twelfth-century term . Similarly, the scribe substitutes (slave) for Alfred&#x27;s (wealth). There is some dispute whether this reflects the changing position of slaves after the Conquest or whether it is just correcting the term, since slaves were chattels.

Overall, the &quot;Roffensis&quot; scribe treated his sources with respect. He did not, for example, make erroneous &#x27;corrections&#x27; to the Old English law texts, unlike the &quot;incompetent translations of &quot;Quadripartitus&#x27;s&quot; author&quot;.

==History==
The two manuscripts were bound together in around 1300. The first part is a collection of documents which includes the Law of Æthelberht, attributed to Æthelberht of Kent (c. 560–616), and the 1100 coronation charter of Henry I of England. The Law of Æthelberht is the oldest surviving English law code and the oldest Anglo-Saxon text in existence. The second part of the &quot;Textus Roffensis&quot; is the oldest of the Rochester Cathedral registers. The entire volume consists of 235 vellum leaves.

Over the centuries, the &quot;Textus Roffensis&quot; has been loaned, lost and recovered on several occasions and has been in the custody of a variety of different people and places; it was once held at the Medway Archives Office in Strood under reference number DRc/R1 and has since been withdrawn. It is currently held in an airtight case in Rochester Cathedral&#x27;s Crypt. Sometime between 1708 and 1718 the book was immersed for several hours in either the River Thames or the River Medway when the ship transporting it overturned; water damage is apparent on a number of pages.

The book was named &#x27;Britain&#x27;s Hidden Treasure&#x27; by the British Library, and was the subject of a conference at the University of Kent in 2010. It has been digitised and published on line by The University of Manchester&#x27;s Centre for Heritage Imaging and Collection Care. The full digital facsimile is available through Rochester Cathedral&#x27;s website.

A short film was also produced about the book by Rochester Cathedral about its history and digitization process.

<text>Duke Records was an American record label, started in Memphis, Tennessee, in 1952 by David James Mattis (WDIA program director and DJ) and Bill Fitzgerald, owners of Tri-State Recording Company. Their first release was Roscoe Gordon singing &quot;Hey Fat Girl&quot;, issued on Duke R-1, later amended to R-101.

==History==
After forming a partnership with Mattis in the summer of 1952, Don Robey (founder of Houston&#x27;s Peacock Records) took control of Duke. Both labels then headquartered at his Bronze Peacock club at 2809 Erastus Street in Houston, focusing on R&amp;B and gospel music. Robey started a subsidiary, Back Beat Records, in 1957 and this later specialised in soul music, along with Sure Shot Records, whilst Peacock specialised in gospel recordings.

Duke&#x27;s leading artist was Bobby &quot;Blue&quot; Bland who stayed with the label for many years until its demise, mostly recording successfully with arranger/bandleader Joe Scott. Johnny Ace was a major R&amp;B artist in the early years of the label before his death at a young age, with a string of R&amp;B top 10 hits including three that went to number one. Junior Parker was another important presence on Duke, recording a long string of singles for the label between 1953 and 1966, scoring seven top-twenty &quot;Billboard&quot; hits during his tenure.

Robey sold his labels to ABC Dunhill Records on 23 May 1973. The Duke labels were soon closed down with the imprints retained by ABC in their catalog, with only Bobby Bland being retained by the new parent label.

<doc id="803936" wikidata="Q7095324" url="?curid=803936" title="Oolong (rabbit)">
<text>was a domestic rabbit owned by Hironori Akutagawa. Oolong became an Internet phenomenon through his owner, Akutagawa, uploading images of the rabbit with objects balanced on his head because of his skills of balancing items such as dorayaki.

Akutagawa&#x27;s site featured &quot;photo journeys&quot; of Oolong traveling with his master through the house, yard, and other locations. The website became known to a wider audience when it was covered in 2001 by Syberpunk, a site which focuses on odd aspects of Japanese culture.

==History==
Oolong was trained to balance objects on his head, an art called &#x27;Head Performance&#x27; by his owner. The first object balanced on Oolong&#x27;s head was a 35 mm film canister on 25 May 1999. Akutagawa later used tea cups, bread, fruit, dorayaki, and a rabbit skull. Although most reactions on the Internet were positive, there were some complaints by people who believed the practice to be cruel to animals. In response, Akutagawa wrote in a message to website visitors:

Throughout the rabbit&#x27;s lifetime, the photographer continued to document his journeys through natural and not-so-natural environments as well as take hundreds of pictures of the rabbit balancing objects. Oolong was noticed by the media, including the &quot;New York Times&quot;, and became a widespread Internet meme. One of Oolong&#x27;s photographs was used as an image macro called &quot;Bunny Wafflehead&quot; which featured Oolong balancing a dorayaki on his head. Another photograph showed Oolong with a pancake on his head with the caption &quot;I have no idea what you&#x27;re talking about... so here&#x27;s a bunny with a pancake on its head.&quot;

Oolong died on January 7, 2003. Akutagawa took photographs of the rabbit&#x27;s last days alive and included some of them on his website. Oolong was succeeded as Akutagawa&#x27;s pet by another rabbit named Yuebing (tr. &quot;moon cake&quot;), a Netherland Dwarf.

<doc id="803940" wikidata="Q6422331" url="?curid=803940" title="Knightbridge Professor of Philosophy">
<text>The Knightbridge Professorship of Philosophy is the senior professorship in philosophy at the University of Cambridge. There have been 22 Knightbridge professors, the incumbent being Rae Langton.

One of the oldest professorships in Cambridge, the chair was founded in 1683 by John Knightbridge (1619/20–1677), a clergyman and Fellow of Peterhouse. Knightbridge gave money for its foundation on his death in 1677. The terms of his will required the Professor to be a Doctor or Bachelor of Divinity; to be aged fifty or older; and to give five lectures in Latin each term, providing a written copy of these lectures to the Vice Chancellor. If the Professor did not give the required five lectures without a good reason, then their maintenance (£50 per annum) could be withdrawn.

The Will also laid out that the Professor would be chosen by election by the Regius and the Lady Margaret&#x27;s Professors of Divinity, the Master of Peterhouse and the Vice-Chancellor of Cambridge, with the latter having the casting vote. This has given rise to a story that in 1813 Francis Barnes was able to secure his own election to the Professorship, because he was Master of Peterhouse as well as Vice-Chancellor. However, the story is almost certainly apocryphal since Barnes was not Vice-Chancellor at the time.

The trustees of Knightbridge&#x27;s Will were unable to find a suitable person to be elected to the Professorship according to these terms. They therefore appealed to the Court of Chancery to relax and modify the original restrictions. A decree was obtained in 18 July 1682, allowing the Professor to be aged forty or older, and to deliver four lectures in each term rather than five. In 1683 the first election to the chair took place, and Thomas Smoult of St John&#x27;s College was appointed, more than five years after Knightbridge&#x27;s death. Smoult further endowed the Professorship with a bequest upon his death in 1707, leaving £300 to purchase land so that the rents could be used to maintain the Knightbridge Professor. This increased the stipend to around £70 per annum. The requirements for the Professor regarding their age and the number of lectures that they were required to deliver, were repealed in 1861. In 1882, the requirement that the post holder should be a Doctor or Bachelor of Divinity was also repealed.

It is unlikely that any of the holders of the Knightbridge Professorship gave the required lectures until the nineteenth century. William Whewell who was appointed to the Professorship in 1838, gave evidence to the University Commission stating that he was not aware that any predecessor to the post had lectured.

Originally entitled the &quot;Professorship of Moral Theology or Casuisticall Divinity&quot;, with the holder often known as simply the &quot;Professor of Casuistry&quot;, it was subsequently designated the Professorship of Moral Theology, Casuistical Divinity, and Moral Philosophy. In 1896 it became the Professorship of Moral Philosophy. The scope of the professorship was officially broadened from merely moral to general philosophy under its present name in 1965.

<text>In the Kingdom of England, the  (Latin for &quot;Great Council&quot;) was an assembly historically convened at certain times of the year when the English nobles and church leaders outside the &quot;Curia regis&quot; were summoned to discuss the affairs of the country with the king. In the 13th century, the Great Council was superseded by the Parliament of England, which had developed out of the Council. The Great Council was last summoned by Charles I in 1640. 

== Anglo-Saxon assemblies ==
The (Latin for &quot;Great Council&quot;) originated in the 10th century, when several small Anglo-Saxon kingdoms formed a unified Kingdom of England. In Anglo-Saxon England, the king held deliberative assemblies of nobles and prelates, called witans. These assemblies comprised between twenty-five and hundreds of participants, including bishops, abbots, ealdormen, and thegns. Witans met regularly during the three feasts of Christmas, Easter and Whitsun and at other times. Previously, kings interacted with their nobility through royal itineration, but the new kingdom&#x27;s size made that impractical. Having nobles come to the king for witans was an important alternative to maintain control of the realm.

Witans served several functions. They appear to have had a role in electing kings, especially in times when the succession was disputed. They were theatrical displays of kingship in that they coincided with crown-wearings. They were also forums for receiving petitions and building consensus among the magnates. King&#x27;s dispensed patronage, such as granting bookland, and these were recorded in charters witnessed and consented to by those in attendance. Appointments to offices, such as to bishoprics or ealdormanries, were also made during witans. In addition, important political decisions were made in consultation with witans, such as going to war and making treaties. Witans also helped the king to produce Anglo-Saxon law codes and acted as a court for important cases (such as those involving the king or important magnates).

== Norman England ==

After the Norman Conquest of 1066, William the Conqueror () continued the tradition of summoning assemblies of magnates to consider national affairs, conduct state trials, and make laws; although legislation now took the form of writs rather than law codes. These assemblies were called . While kings had access to familiar counsel, this private advice could not replace the need for consensus building, and overreliance on familiar counsel could lead to political instability. Great councils were valued because they &quot;carried fewer political risks, allowed responsibility to be more broadly shared, and drew a larger body of prelates and magnates into the making of decisions&quot;. 

The council&#x27;s members were the king&#x27;s tenants-in-chief. The greater tenants, such as archbishops, bishops, abbots, earls, and barons were summoned by individual writ, but sometimes lesser tenants were also summoned by sheriffs. Politics in the period following the Conquest (1066–1154) was dominated by about 200 wealthy laymen, in addition to the king and leading clergy. High-ranking churchmen (such as bishops and abbots) were important magnates in their own right. According to Domesday Book, the English church owned between 25% and 33% of all land in 1066.

== Plantagenet England ==
Traditionally, the great council was not involved in levying taxes. Royal finances derived from land revenues, feudal aids and incidents, and the profits of royal justice. This changed near the end of Henry II&#x27;s reign (1154–1189) due to the need to finance the Third Crusade, ransom Richard I, and pay for the series of Anglo-French wars fought between the Plantagenet and Capetian dynasties. In 1188, Henry II gained the council&#x27;s consent to levy the Saladin tithe. The precedent of gaining the magnates&#x27; consent in council for taxation was followed thereafter. In the process, the council assumed a more representative role since they were in effect consenting on behalf of the kingdom&#x27;s taxpayers. At the same time, these financial pressures created new political tensions between the baronage and the Crown.

King John () alienated the barons by showing partiality when dispensing justice, heavy financial demands and abusing his right to feudal incidents and aids. In 1215, the barons forced John to abide by a charter of liberties similar to charters issued by earlier kings (see Charter of Liberties). Known as Magna Carta (Latin for &quot;Great Charter&quot;), the document was based on three assumptions important to the later development of Parliament:
# the king was subject to the law
# the king could only make law and raise taxation (except customary feudal dues) with the consent of the &quot;community of the realm&quot;
# that the obedience owed by subjects to the king was conditional and not absolute

While the clause stipulating no taxation &quot;without the common counsel&quot; was deleted from later reissues, it was nevertheless followed. Magna Carta transformed the feudal obligation to advise the king into a right to consent. The liberties guaranteed in the charter were granted to &quot;all the free men of our realm&quot;, but it was the barons in council who would represent them.

During the reign of John&#x27;s son, Henry III (), meetings of the great council began to be called &quot;parliament&quot; from the French first used in the late 11th century with the meaning of parley or conversation. The Parliament of England would continue to develop in the reign of Henry&#x27;s son Edward I ().

== Tudor and Stuart eras ==

According to &quot;The Oxford History of England&quot;, Henry VII summoned the Magnum Concilium half a dozen times in the last years of the fifteenth century, but thereafter it fell into disuse. In the autumn of 1640 Charles I summoned the first Magnum Concilium in generations, having dissolved the Short Parliament and suffered defeats in the Bishops&#x27; Wars against Scotland. The Concilium offered Charles a guaranteed loan of £200,000 sterling to pay the army and attempted unsuccessfully to negotiate with the Scots, but it declined to resume its ancient governing role, and urged Charles instead to summon a new Parliament, which then became a protagonist in the English Civil War. Following the Stuart Restoration, the revived monarchy did not recreate the Magnum Concilium. Since then the Concilium has not met.

== Proposed revival ==
In 2008, Christopher Russell Bailey, 5th Baron Glanusk, suggested that the time had come for a recall of the Magnum Concilium, since hereditary peers had lost their right to sit in the House of Lords under the House of Lords Act 1999.

<text>Cell, a shorthand for Cell Broadband Engine Architecture, is a 64-bit multi-core microprocessor and microarchitecture that combines a general-purpose PowerPC core of modest performance with streamlined coprocessing elements which greatly accelerate multimedia and vector processing applications, as well as many other forms of dedicated computation.

It was developed by Sony, Toshiba, and IBM, an alliance known as &quot;STI&quot;. The architectural design and first implementation were carried out at the STI Design Center in Austin, Texas over a four-year period beginning March 2001 on a budget reported by Sony as approaching US$400 million. The first major commercial application of Cell was in Sony&#x27;s PlayStation 3 game console, released in 2006. In May 2008, the Cell-based IBM Roadrunner supercomputer became the first TOP500 LINPACK sustained 1.0 petaflops system. Mercury Computer Systems also developed designs based on the Cell.

The Cell architecture includes a memory coherence architecture that emphasizes power efficiency, prioritizes bandwidth over low latency, and favors peak computational throughput over the simplicity of program code. For these reasons, Cell is widely regarded as a challenging environment for software development. IBM provided a Linux-based development platform to help developers program for Cell chips.

==History==


In mid-2000, Sony Computer Entertainment, Toshiba Corporation, and IBM formed an alliance known as &quot;STI&quot; to design and manufacture the processor.

The STI Design Center opened in March 2001. The Cell was designed over a period of four years, using enhanced versions of the design tools for the POWER4 processor. Over 400 engineers from the three companies worked together in Austin, with critical support from eleven of IBM&#x27;s design centers. During this period, IBM filed many patents pertaining to the Cell architecture, manufacturing process, and software environment. An early patent version of the Broadband Engine was shown to be a chip package comprising four &quot;Processing Elements&quot;, which was the patent&#x27;s description for what is now known as the &quot;Power Processing Element&quot; (PPE). Each Processing Element would contain 8 &quot;Synergistic Processing Elements&quot; (SPEs) on the chip. This chip package was supposed to run at a clock speed of 4 GHz and with 32 SPEs providing 32 gigaFLOPS each SPE (FP32 Single precision), (Per SPU 4 Flops FPU + 4 Flops by integers Unit: 8 Flops per Cycle Per Spu), the Broadband Engine was meant to have 1 teraFLOPS of raw computing power in theory.

The design with 4 PPEs and 32 SPEs was never realized. Instead, Sony and IBM only manufactured a design with one PPE and 8 SPEs. This smaller design, the Cell Broadband Engine or Cell/BE was fabricated using a 90 nm SOI process.

In March 2007, IBM announced that the 65 nm version of Cell/BE was in production at its plant (at the time, now GlobalFoundries&#x27;) in East Fishkill, New York, with Bandai Namco Entertainment using the Cell/BE processor for their 357 arcade board as well as the subsequent 369.

In February 2008, IBM announced that it would begin to fabricate Cell processors with the 45 nm process.

In May 2008, IBM introduced the high-performance double-precision floating-point version of the Cell processor, the PowerXCell 8i, at the 65 nm feature size.

In May 2008, an Opteron- and PowerXCell 8i-based supercomputer, the IBM Roadrunner system, became the world&#x27;s first system to achieve one petaFLOPS, and was the fastest computer in the world until third quarter 2009. The world&#x27;s three most energy-efficient supercomputers, as represented by the Green500 list, are similarly based on the PowerXCell 8i.

In August 2009 the 45 nm Cell processor was introduced in concert with Sony&#x27;s PlayStation 3 Slim.

By November 2009, IBM had discontinued the development of a Cell processor with 32 APUs but was still developing other Cell products.

===Commercialization===

On May 17, 2005, Sony Computer Entertainment confirmed some specifications of the Cell processor that would be shipping in the then-forthcoming PlayStation 3 console. This Cell configuration has one PPE on the core, with eight physical SPEs in silicon. In the PlayStation 3, one SPE is locked-out during the test process, a practice which helps to improve manufacturing yields, and another one is reserved for the OS, leaving 6 free SPEs to be used by games&#x27; code. The target clock-frequency at introduction is 3.2 GHz. The introductory design is fabricated using a 90 nm SOI process, with initial volume production slated for IBM&#x27;s facility in East Fishkill, New York.

The relationship between cores and threads is a common source of confusion. The PPE core is dual threaded and manifests in software as two independent threads of execution while each active SPE manifests as a single thread. In the PlayStation 3 configuration as described by Sony, the Cell processor provides nine independent threads of execution.

On June 28, 2005, IBM and Mercury Computer Systems announced a partnership agreement to build Cell-based computer systems for embedded applications such as medical imaging, industrial inspection, aerospace and defense, seismic processing, and telecommunications. Mercury has since then released blades, conventional rack servers and PCI Express accelerator boards with Cell processors.

In the fall of 2006, IBM released the QS20 blade module using double Cell BE processors for tremendous performance in certain applications, reaching a peak of 410 gigaFLOPS in Fp32 Single precision per module. The QS22 based on the PowerXCell 8i processor was used for the IBM Roadrunner supercomputer. Mercury and IBM uses the fully utilized Cell processor with eight active SPEs. On April 8, 2008, Fixstars Corporation released a PCI Express accelerator board based on the PowerXCell 8i processor.

Sony&#x27;s high-performance media computing server ZEGO uses a 3.2 GHz Cell/B.E processor.

==Overview==
The Cell Broadband Engine, or &quot;Cell&quot; as it is more commonly known, is a microprocessor intended as a hybrid of conventional desktop processors (such as the Athlon 64, and Core 2 families) and more specialized high-performance processors, such as the NVIDIA and ATI graphics-processors (GPUs). The longer name indicates its intended use, namely as a component in current and future online distribution systems; as such it may be utilized in high-definition displays and recording equipment, as well as HDTV systems. Additionally the processor may be suited to digital imaging systems (medical, scientific, &quot;etc.&quot;) and physical simulation (&quot;e.g.&quot;, scientific and structural engineering modeling). As used in the PlayStation 3 it has 250 million transistors.

In a simple analysis, the Cell processor can be split into four components: external input and output structures, the main processor called the &quot;Power Processing Element&quot; (PPE) (a two-way simultaneous-multithreaded PowerPC 2.02 core), eight fully functional co-processors called the &quot;Synergistic Processing Elements&quot;, or SPEs, and a specialized high-bandwidth circular data bus connecting the PPE, input/output elements and the SPEs, called the &quot;Element Interconnect Bus&quot; or EIB.

To achieve the high performance needed for mathematically intensive tasks, such as decoding/encoding MPEG streams, generating or transforming three-dimensional data, or undertaking Fourier analysis of data, the Cell processor marries the SPEs and the PPE via EIB to give access, via fully cache coherent DMA (direct memory access), to both main memory and to other external data storage. To make the best of EIB, and to overlap computation and data transfer, each of the nine processing elements (PPE and SPEs) is equipped with a DMA engine. Since the SPE&#x27;s load/store instructions can only access its own local scratchpad memory, each SPE entirely depends on DMAs to transfer data to and from the main memory and other SPEs&#x27; local memories. A DMA operation can transfer either a single block area of size up to 16KB, or a list of 2 to 2048 such blocks. One of the major design decisions in the architecture of Cell is the use of DMAs as a central means of intra-chip data transfer, with a view to enabling maximal asynchrony and concurrency in data processing inside a chip.

The PPE, which is capable of running a conventional operating system, has control over the SPEs and can start, stop, interrupt, and schedule processes running on the SPEs. To this end, the PPE has additional instructions relating to the control of the SPEs. Unlike SPEs, the PPE can read and write the main memory and the local memories of SPEs through the standard load/store instructions. Despite having Turing complete architectures, the SPEs are not fully autonomous and require the PPE to prime them before they can do any useful work. As most of the &quot;horsepower&quot; of the system comes from the synergistic processing elements, the use of DMA as a method of data transfer and the limited local memory footprint of each SPE pose a major challenge to software developers who wish to make the most of this horsepower, demanding careful hand-tuning of programs to extract maximal performance from this CPU.

The PPE and bus architecture includes various modes of operation giving different levels of memory protection, allowing areas of memory to be protected from access by specific processes running on the SPEs or the PPE.

Both the PPE and SPE are RISC architectures with a fixed-width 32-bit instruction format. The PPE contains a 64-bit general-purpose register set (GPR), a 64-bit floating-point register set (FPR), and a 128-bit Altivec register set. The SPE contains 128-bit registers only. These can be used for scalar data types ranging from 8-bits to 64-bits in size or for SIMD computations on a variety of integer and floating-point formats. System memory addresses for both the PPE and SPE are expressed as 64-bit values for a theoretic address range of 264 bytes (16 exabytes or 16,777,216 terabytes). In practice, not all of these bits are implemented in hardware. Local store addresses internal to the SPU (Synergistic Processor Unit) processor are expressed as a 32-bit word. In documentation relating to Cell a word is always taken to mean 32 bits, a doubleword means 64 bits, and a quadword means 128 bits.
===PowerXCell 8i===
In 2008, IBM announced a revised variant of the Cell called the PowerXCell 8i, which is available in QS22 Blade Servers from IBM. The PowerXCell is manufactured on a 65 nm process, and adds support for up to 32 GB of slotted DDR2 memory, as well as dramatically improving double-precision floating-point performance on the SPEs from a peak of about 12.8 GFLOPS to 102.4 GFLOPS total for eight SPEs, which, coincidentally, is the same peak performance as the NEC SX-9 vector processor released around the same time. The IBM Roadrunner supercomputer, the world&#x27;s fastest during 2008–2009, consisted of 12,240 PowerXCell 8i processors, along with 6,562 AMD Opteron processors. The PowerXCell 8i powered super computers also dominated all of the top 6 &quot;greenest&quot; systems in the Green500 list, with highest MFLOPS/Watt ratio supercomputers in the world. Beside the QS22 and supercomputers, the PowerXCell processor is also available as an accelerator on a PCI Express card and is used as the core processor in the QPACE project.

Since the PowerXCell 8i removed the RAMBUS memory interface, and added significantly larger DDR2 interfaces and enhanced SPEs, the chip layout had to be reworked, which resulted in both larger chip die and packaging.

==Architecture==

While the Cell chip can have a number of different configurations, the basic configuration is a multi-core chip composed of one &quot;Power Processor Element&quot; (&quot;PPE&quot;) (sometimes called &quot;Processing Element&quot;, or &quot;PE&quot;), and multiple &quot;Synergistic Processing Elements&quot; (&quot;SPE&quot;). The PPE and SPEs are linked together by an internal high speed bus dubbed &quot;Element Interconnect Bus&quot; (&quot;EIB&quot;).

===Power Processor Element (PPE)===
The &quot;PPE&quot; is the PowerPC based, dual-issue in-order two-way simultaneous-multithreaded CPU core with a 23-stage pipeline acting as the controller for the eight SPEs, which handle most of the computational workload. PPE has limited out of order execution capabilities; it can perform loads out of order and has delayed execution pipelines. The PPE will work with conventional operating systems due to its similarity to other 64-bit PowerPC processors, while the SPEs are designed for vectorized floating point code execution. The PPE contains a 32 KiB level 1 instruction cache, a 32 KiB level 1 data cache, and a 512 KiB level 2 cache. The size of a cache line is 128 bytes in all caches. Additionally, IBM has included an AltiVec (VMX) unit which is fully pipelined for single precision floating point (Altivec 1 does not support double precision floating-point vectors.), 32-bit Fixed Point Unit (FXU) with 64-bit register file per thread, Load and Store Unit (LSU), 64-bit Floating-Point Unit (FPU), Branch Unit (BRU) and Branch Execution Unit(BXU).
PPE consists of three main units: Instruction Unit (IU), Execution Unit (XU), and vector/scalar execution unit (VSU). IU contains L1 instruction cache, branch prediction hardware, instruction buffers, and dependency checking logic. XU contains integer execution units (FXU) and load-store unit (LSU). VSU contains all of the execution resources for FPU and VMX. Each PPE can complete two double-precision operations per clock cycle using a scalar fused-multiply-add instruction, which translates to 6.4 GFLOPS at 3.2 GHz; or eight single-precision operations per clock cycle with a vector fused-multiply-add instruction, which translates to 25.6 GFLOPS at 3.2 GHz.

====Xenon in Xbox 360====
The PPE was designed specifically for the Cell processor but during development, Microsoft approached IBM wanting a high-performance processor core for its Xbox 360. IBM complied and made the tri-core Xenon processor, based on a slightly modified version of the PPE with added VMX128 extensions.

===Synergistic Processing Element (SPE)===
Each SPE is a dual issue in order processor composed of a &quot;Synergistic Processing Unit&quot;, SPU, and a &quot;Memory Flow Controller&quot;, MFC (DMA, MMU, and bus interface). SPEs do not have any branch prediction hardware (hence there is a heavy burden on the compiler). Each SPE has 6 execution units divided among odd and even pipelines on each SPE : The SPU runs a specially developed instruction set (ISA) with 128-bit SIMD organization for single and double precision instructions. With the current generation of the Cell, each SPE contains a 256 KiB embedded SRAM for instruction and data, called &quot;Local Storage&quot; (not to be mistaken for &quot;Local Memory&quot; in Sony&#x27;s documents that refer to the VRAM) which is visible to the PPE and can be addressed directly by software. Each SPE can support up to 4 GiB of local store memory. The local store does not operate like a conventional CPU cache since it is neither transparent to software nor does it contain hardware structures that predict which data to load. The SPEs contain a 128-bit, 128-entry register file and measures 14.5 mm2 on a 90 nm process. An SPE can operate on sixteen 8-bit integers, eight 16-bit integers, four 32-bit integers, or four single-precision floating-point numbers in a single clock cycle, as well as a memory operation. Note that the SPU cannot directly access system memory; the 64-bit virtual memory addresses formed by the SPU must be passed from the SPU to the SPE memory flow controller (MFC) to set up a DMA operation within the system address space.
In one typical usage scenario, the system will load the SPEs with small programs (similar to threads), chaining the SPEs together to handle each step in a complex operation. For instance, a set-top box might load programs for reading a DVD, video and audio decoding, and display and the data would be passed off from SPE to SPE until finally ending up on the TV. Another possibility is to partition the input data set and have several SPEs performing the same kind of operation in parallel. At 3.2 GHz, each SPE gives a theoretical 25.6 GFLOPS of single-precision performance.

Compared to its personal computer contemporaries, the relatively high overall floating-point performance of a Cell processor seemingly dwarfs the abilities of the SIMD unit in CPUs like the Pentium 4 and the Athlon 64. However, comparing only floating-point abilities of a system is a one-dimensional and application-specific metric. Unlike a Cell processor, such desktop CPUs are more suited to the general-purpose software usually run on personal computers. In addition to executing multiple instructions per clock, processors from Intel and AMD feature branch predictors. The Cell is designed to compensate for this with compiler assistance, in which prepare-to-branch instructions are created. For double-precision floating-point operations, as sometimes used in personal computers and often used in scientific computing, Cell performance drops by an order of magnitude, but still reaches 20.8 GFLOPS (1.8 GFLOPS per SPE, 6.4 GFLOPS per PPE). The PowerXCell 8i variant, which was specifically designed for double-precision, reaches 102.4 GFLOPS in double-precision calculations.

Tests by IBM show that the SPEs can reach 98% of their theoretical peak performance running optimized parallel matrix multiplication.

Toshiba has developed a co-processor powered by four SPEs, but no PPE, called the SpursEngine designed to accelerate 3D and movie effects in consumer electronics.

Each SPE has a local memory of 256 KB. In total, the SPEs have 2 MB of local memory.

===Element Interconnect Bus (EIB)===
The EIB is a communication bus internal to the Cell processor which connects the various on-chip system elements: the PPE processor, the memory controller (MIC), the eight SPE coprocessors, and two off-chip I/O interfaces, for a total of 12 participants in the PS3 (the number of SPU can vary in industrial applications). The EIB also includes an arbitration unit which functions as a set of traffic lights. In some documents, IBM refers to EIB participants as &#x27;units&#x27;.

The EIB is presently implemented as a circular ring consisting of four 16-byte-wide unidirectional channels which counter-rotate in pairs. When traffic patterns permit, each channel can convey up to three transactions concurrently. As the EIB runs at half the system clock rate the effective channel rate is 16 bytes every two system clocks. At maximum concurrency, with three active transactions on each of the four rings, the peak instantaneous EIB bandwidth is 96 bytes per clock (12 concurrent transactions × 16 bytes wide / 2 system clocks per transfer). While this figure is often quoted in IBM literature, it is unrealistic to simply scale this number by processor clock speed. The arbitration unit imposes additional constraints.

IBM Senior Engineer David Krolak, EIB lead designer, explains the concurrency model:
Each participant on the EIB has one 16-byte read port and one 16-byte write port. The limit for a single participant is to read and write at a rate of 16 bytes per EIB clock (for simplicity often regarded 8 bytes per system clock). Each SPU processor contains a dedicated DMA management queue capable of scheduling long sequences of transactions to various endpoints without interfering with the SPU&#x27;s ongoing computations; these DMA queues can be managed locally or remotely as well, providing additional flexibility in the control model.

Data flows on an EIB channel stepwise around the ring. Since there are twelve participants, the total number of steps around the channel back to the point of origin is twelve. Six steps is the longest distance between any pair of participants. An EIB channel is not permitted to convey data requiring more than six steps; such data must take the shorter route around the circle in the other direction. The number of steps involved in sending the packet has very little impact on transfer latency: the clock speed driving the steps is very fast relative to other considerations. However, longer communication distances are detrimental to the overall performance of the EIB as they reduce available concurrency. 

Despite IBM&#x27;s original desire to implement the EIB as a more powerful cross-bar, the circular configuration they adopted to spare resources rarely represents a limiting factor on the performance of the Cell chip as a whole. In the worst case, the programmer must take extra care to schedule communication patterns where the EIB is able to function at high concurrency levels.

David Krolak explained:
====Bandwidth assessment====
At 3.2 GHz, each channel flows at a rate of 25.6 GB/s. Viewing the EIB in isolation from the system elements it connects, achieving twelve concurrent transactions at this flow rate works out to an abstract EIB bandwidth of 307.2 GB/s. Based on this view many IBM publications depict available EIB bandwidth as &quot;greater than 300 GB/s&quot;. This number reflects the peak instantaneous EIB bandwidth scaled by processor frequency.

However, other technical restrictions are involved in the arbitration mechanism for packets accepted onto the bus. The IBM Systems Performance group explained:
This quote apparently represents the full extent of IBM&#x27;s public disclosure of this mechanism and its impact. The EIB arbitration unit, the snooping mechanism, and interrupt generation on segment or page translation faults are not well described in the documentation set as yet made public by IBM.

In practice, effective EIB bandwidth can also be limited by the ring participants involved. While each of the nine processing cores can sustain 25.6 GB/s read and write concurrently, the memory interface controller (MIC) is tied to a pair of XDR memory channels permitting a maximum flow of 25.6 GB/s for reads and writes combined and the two IO controllers are documented as supporting a peak combined input speed of 25.6 GB/s and a peak combined output speed of 35 GB/s.

To add further to the confusion, some older publications cite EIB bandwidth assuming a 4 GHz system clock. This reference frame results in an instantaneous EIB bandwidth figure of 384 GB/s and an arbitration-limited bandwidth figure of 256 GB/s.

All things considered the theoretic 204.8 GB/s number most often cited is the best one to bear in mind. The &quot;IBM Systems Performance&quot; group has demonstrated SPU-centric data flows achieving 197 GB/s on a Cell processor running at 3.2 GHz so this number is a fair reflection on practice as well.

===Memory and I/O controllers===
Cell contains a dual channel Rambus XIO macro which interfaces to Rambus XDR memory. The memory interface controller (MIC) is separate from the XIO macro and is designed by IBM. The XIO-XDR link runs at 3.2 Gbit/s per pin. Two 32-bit channels can provide a theoretical maximum of 25.6 GB/s.

The I/O interface, also a Rambus design, is known as FlexIO. The FlexIO interface is organized into 12 lanes, each lane being a unidirectional 8-bit wide point-to-point path. Five 8-bit wide point-to-point paths are inbound lanes to Cell, while the remaining seven are outbound. This provides a theoretical peak bandwidth of 62.4 GB/s (36.4 GB/s outbound, 26 GB/s inbound) at 2.6 GHz. The FlexIO interface can be clocked independently, typ. at 3.2 GHz. 4 inbound + 4 outbound lanes are supporting memory coherency.

==Applications==
===Video processing card===
Some companies, such as Leadtek, have released PCI-E cards based upon the Cell to allow for &quot;faster than real time&quot; transcoding of H.264, MPEG-2 and MPEG-4 video.

===Blade server===
On August 29, 2007, IBM announced the BladeCenter QS21. Generating a measured 1.05 giga–floating point operations per second (gigaFLOPS) per watt, with peak performance of approximately 460 GFLOPS it is one of the most power efficient computing platforms to date. A single BladeCenter chassis can achieve 6.4 tera–floating point operations per second (teraFLOPS) and over 25.8 teraFLOPS in a standard 42U rack.

On May 13, 2008, IBM announced the BladeCenter QS22. The QS22 introduces the PowerXCell 8i processor with five times the double-precision floating point performance of the QS21, and the capacity for up to 32 GB of DDR2 memory on-blade.

IBM has discontinued the Blade server line based on Cell processors as of January 12, 2012.

===PCI Express board===
Several companies provide PCI-e boards utilising the IBM PowerXCell 8i. The performance is reported as 179.2 GFlops (SP), 89.6 GFlops (DP) at 2.8 GHz.

===Console video games===
Sony&#x27;s PlayStation 3 video game console was the first production application of the Cell processor, clocked at 3.2 GHz and containing seven out of eight operational SPEs, to allow Sony to increase the yield on the processor manufacture. Only six of the seven SPEs are accessible to developers as one is reserved by the OS.

===Home cinema===

Toshiba has produced HDTVs using Cell. They presented a system to decode 48 standard definition MPEG-2 streams simultaneously on a 1920×1080 screen. This can enable a viewer to choose a channel based on dozens of thumbnail videos displayed simultaneously on the screen.

=== Laptop PCs ===
Toshiba produced a laptop, Qosmio G55, released in 2008, that contains Cell technology embedded into it. Its CPU otherwise is an Intel Core x86-based chip as is common on Toshiba computers.

===Supercomputing===
IBM&#x27;s supercomputer, IBM Roadrunner, was a hybrid of General Purpose x86-64 Opteron as well as Cell processors. This system assumed the #1 spot on the June 2008 Top 500 list as the first supercomputer to run at petaFLOPS speeds, having gained a sustained 1.026 petaFLOPS speed using the standard LINPACK benchmark. IBM Roadrunner used the PowerXCell 8i version of the Cell processor, manufactured using 65 nm technology and enhanced SPUs that can handle double precision calculations in the 128-bit registers, reaching double precision 102 GFLOPs per chip.

===Cluster computing===
Clusters of PlayStation 3 consoles are an attractive alternative to high-end systems based on Cell blades. Innovative Computing Laboratory, a group led by Jack Dongarra, in the Computer Science Department at the University of Tennessee, investigated such an application in depth. Terrasoft Solutions is selling 8-node and 32-node PS3 clusters with Yellow Dog Linux pre-installed, an implementation of Dongarra&#x27;s research.

As first reported by &quot;Wired&quot; on October 17, 2007, an interesting application of using PlayStation 3 in a cluster configuration was implemented by Astrophysicist Gaurav Khanna, from the Physics department of University of Massachusetts Dartmouth, who replaced time used on supercomputers with a cluster of eight PlayStation 3s. Subsequently, the next generation of this machine, now called the &quot;PlayStation 3 Gravity Grid&quot;, uses a network of 16 machines, and exploits the Cell processor for the intended application which is binary black hole coalescence using perturbation theory. In particular, the cluster performs astrophysical simulations of large supermassive black holes capturing smaller compact objects and has generated numerical data that has been published multiple times in the relevant scientific research literature. The Cell processor version used by the PlayStation 3 has a main CPU and 6 SPEs available to the user, giving the Gravity Grid machine a net of 16 general-purpose processors and 96 vector processors. The machine has a one-time cost of $9,000 to build and is adequate for black-hole simulations which would otherwise cost $6,000 per run on a conventional supercomputer. The black hole calculations are not memory-intensive and are highly localizable, and so are well-suited to this architecture. Khanna claims that the cluster&#x27;s performance exceeds that of a 100+ Intel Xeon core based traditional Linux cluster on his simulations. The PS3 Gravity Grid gathered significant media attention through 2007, 2008, 2009, and 2010.

The computational Biochemistry and Biophysics lab at the Universitat Pompeu Fabra, in Barcelona, deployed in 2007 a BOINC system called PS3GRID for collaborative computing based on the CellMD software, the first one designed specifically for the Cell processor.

The United States Air Force Research Laboratory has deployed a PlayStation 3 cluster of over 1700 units, nicknamed the &quot;Condor Cluster&quot;, for analyzing high-resolution satellite imagery. The Air Force claims the Condor Cluster would be the 33rd largest supercomputer in the world in terms of capacity. The lab has opened up the supercomputer for use by universities for research.

===Distributed computing===
With the help of the computing power of over half a million PlayStation 3 consoles, the distributed computing project Folding@home has been recognized by &quot;Guinness World Records&quot; as the most powerful distributed network in the world. The first record was achieved on September 16, 2007, as the project surpassed one petaFLOPS, which had never previously been attained by a distributed computing network. Additionally, the collective efforts enabled PS3 alone to reach the petaFLOPS mark on September 23, 2007. In comparison, the world&#x27;s second-most powerful supercomputer at the time, IBM&#x27;s Blue Gene/L, performed at around 478.2 teraFLOPS, which means Folding@home&#x27;s computing power is approximately twice Blue Gene/L&#x27;s (although the CPU interconnect in Blue Gene/L is more than one million times faster than the mean network speed in Folding@home). As of May 7, 2011, Folding@home runs at about 9.3 x86 petaFLOPS, with 1.6 petaFLOPS generated by 26,000 active PS3s alone.

===Mainframes===
IBM announced on April 25, 2007, that it would begin integrating its Cell Broadband Engine Architecture microprocessors into the company&#x27;s System z line of mainframes. This has led to a gameframe.

===Password cracking===
The architecture of the processor makes it better suited to hardware-assisted cryptographic brute-force attack applications than conventional processors.

==Software engineering==
Due to the flexible nature of the Cell, there are several possibilities for the utilization of its resources, not limited to just different computing paradigms:

===Job queue===
The PPE maintains a job queue, schedules jobs in SPEs, and monitors progress. Each SPE runs a &quot;mini kernel&quot; whose role is to fetch a job, execute it, and synchronize with the PPE.

===Self-multitasking of SPEs===
The mini kernel and scheduling is distributed across the SPEs. Tasks are synchronized using mutexes or semaphores as in a conventional operating system. Ready-to-run tasks wait in a queue for an SPE to execute them. The SPEs use shared memory for all tasks in this configuration.

===Stream processing===
Each SPE runs a distinct program. Data comes from an input stream and is sent to SPEs. When an SPE has terminated the processing, the output data is sent to an output stream.

This provides a flexible and powerful architecture for stream processing, and allows explicit scheduling for each SPE separately. Other processors are also able to perform streaming tasks but are limited by the kernel loaded.

===Open source software development===
In 2005, patches enabling Cell support in the Linux kernel were submitted for inclusion by IBM developers. Arnd Bergmann (one of the developers of the aforementioned patches) also described the Linux-based Cell architecture at LinuxTag 2005. As of release 2.6.16 (March 20, 2006), the Linux kernel officially supports the Cell processor.

Both PPE and SPEs are programmable in C/C++ using a common API provided by libraries.

Fixstars Solutions provides Yellow Dog Linux for IBM and Mercury Cell-based systems, as well as for the PlayStation 3. Terra Soft strategically partnered with Mercury to provide a Linux Board Support Package for Cell, and support and development of software applications on various other Cell platforms, including the IBM BladeCenter JS21 and Cell QS20, and Mercury Cell-based solutions. Terra Soft also maintains the Y-HPC (High Performance Computing) Cluster Construction and Management Suite and Y-Bio gene sequencing tools. Y-Bio is built upon the RPM Linux standard for package management, and offers tools which help bioinformatics researchers conduct their work with greater efficiency. IBM has developed a pseudo-filesystem for Linux coined &quot;Spufs&quot; that simplifies access to and use of the SPE resources. IBM is currently maintaining a Linux kernel and GDB ports, while Sony maintains the GNU toolchain (GCC, binutils).

In November 2005, IBM released a &quot;Cell Broadband Engine (CBE) Software Development Kit Version 1.0&quot;, consisting of a simulator and assorted tools, to its web site. Development versions of the latest kernel and tools for Fedora Core 4 are maintained at the Barcelona Supercomputing Center website.

In August 2007, Mercury Computer Systems released a Software Development Kit for PlayStation 3 for High-Performance Computing.

In November 2007, Fixstars Corporation released the new &quot;CVCell&quot; module aiming to accelerate several important OpenCV APIs for Cell. In a series of software calculation tests, they recorded execution times on a 3.2 GHz Cell processor that were between 6x and 27x faster compared with the same software on a 2.4 GHz Intel Core 2 Duo.

In October 2009, IBM released an OpenCL driver for POWER6 and CBE. This allows programs written in the cross-platform API to be easily run on Cell PSE.

<text>Sir Reginald Edward Stubbs (; 13 October 1876 – 7 December 1947) was a British colonial administrator who served as governor of four British territories during his career, including Hong Kong and Ceylon. 

==Early life and education==
Reginald Edward Stubbs was born on 13 October 1876, the son of William Stubbs, a historian and bishop of Chester and Oxford, consecutively. He was educated at Radley and Corpus Christi College, Oxford. He obtained first class honours in Lit. Hum. in 1899.

==Early Colonial Services==
He entered Colonial Office in 1900 as a second-class clerk, eventually serving as acting first class clerk from 1907 to 1910, when he became a permanent 1st class clerk. In that same year, Stubbs was sent on a special mission to Malay Peninsula and Hong Kong. He was a member of West African Lands Committee in 1912, and became a colonial secretary of Ceylon in from 1913 to 1919.

==Governor of Hong Kong==
He was appointed Hong Kong Governor in 1919, a position he served until 1925.

During Stubbs&#x27; tenure, strikes were frequent, including ones that were very damaging to the Hong Kong economy, such as the Seamen&#x27;s strike of 1922 and the Canton-Hong Kong strike that began in 1925.

Stubbs engaged in cordial talks with Sun Yat-sen and his supporters in Hong Kong prior to Sun&#x27;s triumphal return to Canton in February 1923.

There followed, in 1925, the general strike that involved workers in Hong Kong and Canton, China. The strikers demanded the annulment of the &quot;unequal treaties&quot; (Treaty of Nanking, Treaty of Peking, and New Territories land lease agreement, which, altogether, allowed British control of Hong Kong). The strikers also demanded better treatment of Chinese labourers in Hong Kong.

At first, Stubbs tried to suppress the strikers with legal and forceful means. He regarded the strike as a Bolshevik plot headed by Dr. Sun Yat-sen to overthrow the colonial government, without any attention to the pressing economic grievances at stake. He banned the Chinese Seamen&#x27;s Union, the organizer of the strike and banned Dr. Sun and the Soviet military and political advisers in Canton from entering the colony due to Sun&#x27;s anti-colonial remarks. The efforts backfired and caused an exodus of more than 100,000 Chinese labourers to China.

Stubbs took a conservative stance, in line with his Chinese elite advisors, on the issue of mui-tsai, a form of child slavery then prevalent in the colony. He was criticized by London for acquiescence. 

Stubbs rejected repeated calls among the local European community for direct election of the Legislative Council, fearing the exclusion of local Chinese from similar rights may lead to unrest.
Both Stubbs and his Colonial Secretary Claud Severn were replaced in 1925, having failed to quell the disorder and leaving behind a seriously damaged Hong Kong economy. British Consul General in Canton James Jamieson criticised their leadership, seeing them as out of touch and out of date, unable to converse in Chinese and ignorant of republican China.

Stubbs received an M.A. degree during his tenure, in 1920.

==Jamaica and Cyprus==
After his stormy tenure as Governor of Hong Kong, Stubbs was made Captain-General and Governor-in-Chief of Jamaica a year later, in 1926. He would hold this position until 1932, when he was appointed Governor and Commander-in-Chief of Cyprus. He would serve in this position until 1933.

==Governorship of Ceylon==
In 1933 Stubbs was appointed to his last position in the Colonial Service: Governor and Commander-in-Chief of Ceylon (Sri Lanka).

===Bracegirdle affair===
In 1937, he was prevailed upon by the White planters to become involved in an illegal attempt to deport Mark Anthony Bracegirdle, an Australian planter who had gone over to the side of the workers and joined the Lanka Sama Samaja Party (LSSP). Bracegirdle was served with the order of deportation on 22 April and given 48 hours to leave, but he defied the order, going into hiding instead. The Colonial Government began a man-hunt, but was unsuccessful. The LSSP started a campaign to defend him. At that year&#x27;s May Day rally at Price Park, Colombo placards declaring &#x27;We want Bracegirdle – Deport Stubbs&#x27; were displayed, and a resolution was passed condemning Stubbs, demanding his removal and the withdrawal of the deportation order.

On 5 May, in the State Council, the LSSP members Dr N.M. Perera and Philip Gunawardena moved a vote of censure on the Governor for having ordered the deportation of Bracegirdle without the advice of the acting Home Minister. Even the Board of Ministers had started feeling the heat of public opinion and the vote was passed by 34 votes to 7.

On the same day there was a 50,000-strong rally at Galle Face Green, which was addressed by Dr N.M. Perera, Philip Gunawardena, and S.W.R.D. Bandaranaike, condemning Stubbs. Bracegirdle made a dramatic appearance on the platform at this rally, but the police were powerless to arrest him. They managed to arrest him a couple of days later, but a writ of habeas corpus was served and the case was called before a bench of three Supreme Court judges presided over by Chief Justice Sir Sidney Abrahams. The brilliant H.V. Perera, the county&#x27;s leading civil lawyer, volunteered his services free on behalf of Bracegirdle; he was made a King&#x27;s Counsel (KC) on the day that Bracegirdle appeared in court. On 18 May order was made that he could not be deported for exercising his right to free speech, and Bracegirdle was a free man.

Stubbs retired shortly afterwards.

==Retirement==
A year after his retirement, Stubbs became the vice-chairman of West India Royal Commission (until 1939) and Chairman of Northern Division Appellate Tribunal for Conscientious Objectors from 1941 to 1947.

==Personal life==
Stubbs married Marjory Stubbs in 1909. The couple had two sons and one daughter. He died on 7 December 1947.

<text>Interstate 494 (I-494) is an auxiliary Interstate Highway making up part of a beltway of I-94, circling through the southern and western portions of the Minneapolis–Saint Paul metropolitan area in Minnesota. The road is coupled with I-694 (which circles the northern edge of the Twin Cities metro area) at each end and composes more than half of the major beltway of the region. I-694/I-494 also act as loop routes for I-35E and I-35W.

The speed limit on I-494 is . Interstate Highways outside of the loop in Minnesota may be signed as high as . Most highways inside the loop are signed at speeds of or lower, though a few exceptions were added in September 2005, allowing speeds of up to in some places. Those roads had been signed at or higher up until the 1973 oil crisis.

==Route description==

The exit numbering of I-494 is unusual in that it begins at the Minnesota River heading westbound (between Eagan and Bloomington) and continues clockwise around the entire beltway, continuing clockwise onto I-694. The last exit east of the Minnesota River is exit 71 to Pilot Knob Road. The first exit west of the river is exit 1A, which grants access to eastbound Minnesota State Highway 5 (MN 5) and Minneapolis–Saint Paul International Airport. The most significant landmark on the length of I-494 is Mall of America, just south of the intersection of I-494 and MN 77.

Legally, the route of I-494 is defined as part of unmarked legislative route 393 in Minnesota Statutes § 161.12(5). I-494 is not marked with this legislative number along the actual highway.

==History==
Construction on I-494 first began in the late 1950s, and it was finally completed in 1985. With the most recent expansion completed in November 2016 in Plymouth, I-494 is now at least three lanes in each direction for its entire route.

A major reconstruction/widening project of I-494 was completed in late 2006 between US Highway 212 (US 212)/MN 5 in Eden Prairie and Carlson Parkway at Minnetonka–Plymouth. There were plans for up to six lanes in each direction for parts of I-494 in Bloomington, but the majority of the city only sees four lanes and sees five in only two spots: eastbound at the East Bush Lake Road exit and further eastbound at the point where I-494 and MN 5 separate from each other.

Expansion of the Wakota Bridge between Newport and South St. Paul over the Mississippi River was completed in mid-2010. The bridge is named so because it connects Washington and Dakota counties. Near the end of this effort, I-494 was widened from two to three lanes in each direction between Lake Road and I-94 in Woodbury.

===Traffic===
Since its opening, I-494 has been subjected to numerous traffic problems, both eastbound and westbound. Vehicles eastbound usually start to slow down at the US 169 interchange in Bloomington and continues to slow at the interchange with MN 100, at the Bloomington–Edina city line. However, traffic is the worst at the interchange for I-35W, which is located at the Bloomington–Richfield city line. Currently, information about the study is on the City of Bloomington&#x27;s website, with more information starting to come from the Minnesota Department of Transportation (MnDOT). The plan is scoped between US 169 to the Minneapolis–Saint Paul International Airport. The road sees over 500,000 passengers per day, with it being congested for more than 30 percent of the day. So far, MnDOT has determined to add E-ZPass Minnesota lanes eastbound from France Avenue to MN 77 and westbound from MN 77 to I-35W. They also plan to construct a turbine-style ramp for northbound I-35W from westbound I-494. In an effort to reduce congestion on the highway and on exits as well, MnDOT is planning to close all ramps at Nicollet Avenue and 12th Avenue and construct a full-access interchange at County State-Aid Highway 35 (CSAH 35; Portland Avenue), with two onramps and two offramps to replace the ramps. Problems have been addressed throughout the entire corridor, with all the highways being included. Construction for the Metro Orange Line tunnel began in 2019 and is still currently underway. The rest of the corridor is still being studied, with plans for construction to begin between 2022 and 2024.

==494 Corridor Commission==
The 494 Corridor Commission, also known as 494 Commuter Services, is a nonprofit organization aimed at reducing traffic congestion along the southwest section of the I-494 corridor. In 1988, the cities of Bloomington, Eden Prairie, Edina, Minnetonka, and Richfield joined to address traffic congestion and work toward improving I-494. The organization&#x27;s mission is to promote economic growth and regional prosperity through improved transportation options along the highway, such as carpooling and bus transit. The organization&#x27;s board of directors consists of representatives from each of the five member cities, MnDOT, the Metropolitan Council, and the private business community.

<text>Richard Gordon Kleindienst (August 5, 1923 – February 3, 2000) was an American lawyer, politician, and U.S. Attorney General during the early stages of Watergate political scandal. He resigned his post in disgrace for his involvement in the Watergate cover-up.

==Early life and career==
Kleindienst was born August 5, 1923, in Winslow, Arizona, the son of Gladys (Love) and Alfred R. Kleindienst. He attended the University of Arizona before serving in the United States Army Air Forces from 1943 to 1946. Following his military service, he attended Harvard College and Harvard Law School, graduating from the latter in 1950.

From 1953 to 1954, he served in the Arizona House of Representatives; he followed that with some 15 years of private legal practice. He concurrently was Arizona Republican Party chairman from 1956 to 1960 and 1961 to 1963, and in the 1964 Arizona gubernatorial election, the Republican candidate for Governor of Arizona, losing the general election to Sam Goddard, 53–47%.

==Role in Goldwater campaign==
On January 3, 1964, Barry Goldwater asked his friend Kleindienst to serve as Director of Operations in his presidential campaign. Goldwater stipulated that he would only respond to the &quot;draft Goldwater&quot; movement if the campaign were led by three Republicans close to him: Kleindienst, Denison Kitchel as Campaign Manager, and Dean Burch as Assistant Campaign Manager.

Kleindienst had never worked on a national campaign. Political experts told Goldwater that F. Clifton White, an experienced GOP operative, would be a better choice. Goldwater rejected this change, but did agree to Kleindienst and White sharing the role.

== Nixon administration ==

After Richard Nixon won the 1968 presidential election, John N. Mitchell agreed to serve as United States Attorney General on the condition that Kleindienst serve as Deputy Attorney General. Kleindienst suspended his private practice in 1969 to accept the post of Deputy Attorney General offered him by President Nixon. This gave him responsibilities relating to the government&#x27;s suit against the International Telephone &amp; Telegraph Corporation. Nixon and his aide John Ehrlichman told him to drop the case, which created an impression that they were violating their ethical obligations in favor of ITT, and that, as an attorney himself, Kleindienst was now obligated to report these ethical lapses to the state bars in the jurisdictions involved. But in his official role as Deputy Attorney General, he also repeatedly told Congress that no one had interfered with his department&#x27;s handling of the case, failing to mention either Nixon or Ehrlichman.

On February 15, 1972, Attorney General Mitchell resigned effective March 1 in order to work on the Nixon re-election campaign, with President Nixon nominating Kleindienst to serve as his successor. After having served as Acting Attorney General for a little under three and a half months, his appointment was approved by the Senate on June 12 after an attempt to block the nomination by Ted Kennedy on the grounds of his involvement with ITT failed.

Unknown to Kleindienst, leaders of the Committee to Re-Elect the President (CRP) had tasked Gordon Liddy with arranging various covert operations, one of which was to be a burglary of the Democratic National Committee headquarters at the Watergate complex in Washington, DC. Before dawn on Saturday, June 17, 1972, five days after Kleindienst was sworn in, James McCord and four other burglars operating on Liddy&#x27;s instructions were arrested at the Watergate complex. Later in the morning Kleindienst was officially notified of the arrests. Liddy, after a phone consultation about the arrests with CRP Deputy Director Jeb Magruder (who had managed CRP up until March of that year, and had the most direct organizational authority over Liddy&#x27;s activities), personally approached Kleindienst the same day at the Burning Tree Club golf club in Bethesda, Maryland. Liddy told him that the break-in had originated within CRP, and that Mitchell wanted Kleindienst to arrange the release of the burglars to reduce the risk of exposure of CRP&#x27;s involvement. But Kleindienst refused and ordered that the Watergate burglary investigation proceed like any other case. The top law enforcement officer of the United States, Kleindienst did not share with FBI investigators or his department&#x27;s prosecutor Liddy&#x27;s confession of his own involvement or Liddy&#x27;s claim that Mitchell was seeking to obstruct justice.

Kleindienst ultimately resigned in the midst of the Watergate scandal nearly a year later, on April 30, 1973. This was the same day that John Dean was fired and H. R. Haldeman and John Ehrlichman resigned. In 1974, he pleaded guilty to contempt of Congress for his failing to testify fully to the Senate in a pre-Watergate investigation, involving alleged favoritism shown to ITT during his testimony as part of his Senate confirmation hearings. Kleindienst was one of very few people in modern U.S. history to be convicted of contempt of Congress; G. Gordon Liddy, another figure in the Watergate scandal, also was convicted in the 1970s.

In April 1982, the Arizona Supreme Court unanimously suspended Kleindienst from the practice of law for 1 year due to his unethical conduct, accepting a disciplinary recommendation from the state bar association. The suspension was due to statements he made to a bar investigator probing Kleindienst&#x27;s representation in a 1976 insurance company fraud case. In October 1982, the U.S. Supreme Court, on a unanimous vote, disbarred Kleindienst, blocking him from practicing before the highest court.

== Later life ==
In 1981, Kleindienst was charged with perjury regarding how much he knew about a white-collar criminal he represented; he was subsequently acquitted.

He died at the age of 76, of lung cancer, on February 3, 2000.
