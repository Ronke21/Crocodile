<text>Kinetic art is art from any medium that contains movement perceivable by the viewer or that depends on motion for its effects. Canvas paintings that extend the viewer&#x27;s perspective of the artwork and incorporate multidimensional movement are the earliest examples of kinetic art. More pertinently speaking, kinetic art is a term that today most often refers to three-dimensional sculptures and figures such as mobiles that move naturally or are machine operated (see e.g. videos on this page of works of George Rickey and Uli Aschenborn). The moving parts are generally powered by wind, a motor or the observer. Kinetic art encompasses a wide variety of overlapping techniques and styles.

There is also a portion of kinetic art that includes virtual movement, or rather movement perceived from only certain angles or sections of the work. This term also clashes frequently with the term &quot;apparent movement&quot;, which many people use when referring to an artwork whose movement is created by motors, machines, or electrically powered systems. Both apparent and virtual movement are styles of kinetic art that only recently have been argued as styles of op art. The amount of overlap between kinetic and op art is not significant enough for artists and art historians to consider merging the two styles under one umbrella term, but there are distinctions that have yet to be made.

&quot;Kinetic art&quot; as a moniker developed from a number of sources. Kinetic art has its origins in the late 19th century impressionist artists such as Claude Monet, Edgar Degas, and Édouard Manet who originally experimented with accentuating the movement of human figures on canvas. This triumvirate of impressionist painters all sought to create art that was more lifelike than their contemporaries. Degas’ dancer and racehorse portraits are examples of what he believed to be &quot;photographic realism&quot;;. During the late 19th century artists such as Degas felt the need to challenge the movement toward photography with vivid, cadenced landscapes and portraits.

By the early 1900s, certain artists grew closer and closer to ascribing their art to dynamic motion. Naum Gabo, one of the two artists attributed to naming this style, wrote frequently about his work as examples of &quot;kinetic rhythm&quot;. He felt that his moving sculpture &quot;Kinetic Construction&quot; (also dubbed &quot;Standing Wave&quot;, 1919-1920) was the first of its kind in the 20th century. From the 1920s until the 1960s, the style of kinetic art was reshaped by a number of other artists who experimented with mobiles and new forms of sculpture.

== Origins and early development ==

The strides made by artists to &quot;lift the figures and scenery off the page and prove undeniably that art is not rigid&quot; (Calder, 1954) took significant innovations and changes in compositional style. Édouard Manet, Edgar Degas, and Claude Monet were the three artists of the 19th century that initiated those changes in the Impressionist movement. Even though they each took unique approaches to incorporating movement in their works, they did so with the intention of being a realist. In the same period, Auguste Rodin was an artist whose early works spoke in support of the developing kinetic movement in art. However, Auguste Rodin&#x27;s later criticisms of the movement indirectly challenged the abilities of Manet, Degas, and Monet, claiming that it is impossible to exactly capture a moment in time and give it the vitality that is seen in real life.

=== Édouard Manet ===

It is almost impossible to ascribe Manet&#x27;s work to any one era or style of art. One of his works that is truly on the brink of a new style is &quot;Le Ballet Espagnol&quot; (1862). The figures&#x27; contours coincide with their gestures as a way to suggest depth in relation to one another and in relation to the setting. Manet also accentuates the lack of equilibrium in this work to project to the viewer that he or she is on the edge of a moment that is seconds away from passing. The blurred, hazy sense of color and shadow in this work similarly place the viewer in a fleeting moment.

In 1863, Manet extended his study of movement on flat canvas with &quot;Le déjeuner sur l&#x27;herbe&quot;. The light, color, and composition are the same, but he adds a new structure to the background figures. The woman bending in the background is not completely scaled as if she were far away from the figures in the foreground. The lack of spacing is Manet&#x27;s method of creating snapshot, near-invasive movement similar to his blurring of the foreground objects in &quot;Le Ballet Espagnol&quot;.

=== Edgar Degas ===
Edgar Degas is believed to be the intellectual extension of Manet, but more radical for the impressionist community. Degas&#x27; subjects are the epitome of the impressionist era; he finds great inspiration in images of ballet dancers and horse races. His &quot;modern subjects&quot; never obscured his objective of creating moving art. In his 1860 piece &quot;Jeunes Spartiates s&#x27;exerçant à la lutte&quot;, he capitalizes on the classic impressionist nudes but expands on the overall concept. He places them in a flat landscape and gives them dramatic gestures, and for him this pointed to a new theme of &quot;youth in movement&quot;.

One of his most revolutionary works, &quot;L’Orchestre de l’Opéra&quot; (1868) interprets forms of definite movement and gives them multidimensional movement beyond the flatness of the canvas. He positions the orchestra directly in the viewer&#x27;s space, while the dancers completely fill the background. Degas is alluding to the Impressionist style of combining movement, but almost redefines it in a way that was seldom seen in the late 1800s. In the 1870s, Degas continues this trend through his love of one-shot motion horse races in such works as &quot;Voiture aux Courses&quot; (1872).

It wasn&#x27;t until 1884 with &quot;Chevaux de Course&quot; that his attempt at creating dynamic art came to fruition. This work is part of a series of horse races and polo matches wherein the figures are well integrated into the landscape. The horses and their owners are depicted as if caught in a moment of intense deliberation, and then trotting away casually in other frames. The impressionist and overall artistic community were very impressed with this series, but were also shocked when they realized he based this series on actual photographs. Degas was not fazed by the criticisms of his integration of photography, and it actually inspired Monet to rely on similar technology.

=== Claude Monet ===

Degas and Monet&#x27;s style was very similar in one way: both of them based their artistic interpretation on a direct &quot;retinal impression&quot; to create the feeling of variation and movement in their art. The subjects or images that were the foundation of their paintings came from an objective view of the world. As with Degas, many art historians consider that to be the subconscious effect photography had in that period of time. His 1860s works reflected many of the signs of movement that are visible in Degas&#x27; and Manet&#x27;s work.

By 1875, Monet&#x27;s touch becomes very swift in his new series, beginning with &quot;Le Bâteau-Atelier sur la Seine&quot;. The landscape almost engulfs the whole canvas and has enough motion emanating from its inexact brushstrokes that the figures are a part of the motion. This painting along with &quot;Gare Saint-Lazare&quot; (1877–1878), proves to many art historians that Monet was redefining the style of the Impressionist era. Impressionism initially was defined by isolating color, light, and movement. In the late 1870s, Monet had pioneered a style that combined all three, while maintaining a focus on the popular subjects of the Impressionist era. Artists were often so struck by Monet&#x27;s wispy brushstrokes that it was more than movement in his paintings, but a &quot;striking vibration&quot;.

===Auguste Rodin===
Auguste Rodin at first was very impressed by Monet&#x27;s &#x27;vibrating works&#x27; and Degas&#x27; unique understanding of spatial relationships. As an artist and an author of art reviews, Rodin published multiple works supporting this style. He claimed that Monet and Degas&#x27; work created the illusion &quot;that art captures life through good modeling and movement&quot;. In 1881, when Rodin first sculpted and produced his own works of art, he rejected his earlier notions. Sculpting put Rodin into a predicament that he felt no philosopher nor anyone could ever solve; how can artists impart movement and dramatic motions from works so solid as sculptures? After this conundrum occurred to him, he published new articles that didn&#x27;t attack men such as Manet, Monet, and Degas intentionally, but propagated his own theories that Impressionism is not about communicating movement but presenting it in static form.

== 20th century surrealism and early kinetic art ==
The surrealist style of the 20th century created an easy transition into the style of kinetic art. All artists now explored subject matter that would not have been socially acceptable to depict artistically. Artists went beyond solely painting landscapes or historical events, and felt the need to delve into the mundane and the extreme to interpret new styles. With the support of artists such as Albert Gleizes, other avant-garde artists such as Jackson Pollock and Max Bill felt as if they had found new inspiration to discover oddities that became the focus of kinetic art.

=== Albert Gleizes ===
Gleizes was considered the ideal philosopher of the late 19th century and early 20th century arts in Europe, and more specifically France. His theories and treatises from 1912 on cubism gave him a renowned reputation in any artistic discussion. This reputation is what allowed him to act with considerable influence when supporting the plastic style or the rhythmic movement of art in the 1910s and 1920s. Gleizes published a theory on movement, which further articulated his theories on the psychological, artistic uses of movement in conjunction with the mentality that arises when considering movement. Gleizes asserted repeatedly in his publications that human creation implies the total renunciation of external sensation. That to him is what made art mobile when to many, including Rodin, it was rigidly and unflinchingly immobile.

Gleizes first stressed the necessity for rhythm in art. To him, rhythm meant the visually pleasant coinciding of figures in a two-dimensional or three-dimensional space. Figures should be spaced mathematically, or systematically so that they appeared to interact with one another. Figures should also not have features that are too definite. They need to have shapes and compositions that are almost unclear, and from there the viewer can believe that the figures themselves are moving in that confined space. He wanted paintings, sculptures, and even the flat works of mid-19th-century artists to show how figures could impart on the viewer that there was great movement contained in a certain space. As a philosopher, Gleizes also studied the concept of artistic movement and how that appealed to the viewer. Gleizes updated his studies and publications through the 1930s, just as kinetic art was becoming popular.

=== Jackson Pollock ===
When Jackson Pollock created many of his famous works, the United States was already at the forefront of the kinetic and popular art movements. The novel styles and methods he used to create his most famous pieces earned him the spot in the 1950s as the unchallenged leader of kinetic painters, his work was associated with Action painting coined by art critic Harold Rosenberg in the 1950s. Pollock had an unfettered desire to animate every aspect of his paintings. Pollock repeatedly said to himself, &quot;I am in every painting&quot;. He used tools that most painters would never use, such as sticks, trowels, and knives. He thought of the shapes he created as being &quot;beautiful, erratic objects&quot;.

This style evolved into his drip technique. Pollock repeatedly took buckets of paint and paintbrushes and flicked them around until the canvas was covered with squiggly lines and jagged strokes. In the next phase of his work, Pollock tested his style with uncommon materials. He painted his first work with aluminum paint in 1947, titled &quot;Cathedral&quot; and from there he tried his first &quot;splashes&quot; to destroy the unity of the material itself. He believed wholeheartedly that he was liberating the materials and structure of art from their forced confinements, and that is how he arrived at the moving or kinetic art that always existed. 

=== Max Bill ===
Max Bill became an almost complete disciple of the kinetic movement in the 1930s. He believed that kinetic art should be executed from a purely mathematical perspective. To him, using mathematics principles and understandings were one of the few ways that you could create objective movement. This theory applied to every artwork he created and how he created it. Bronze, marble, copper, and brass were four of the materials he used in his sculptures. He also enjoyed tricking the viewer&#x27;s eye when he or she first approached one of his sculptures. In his &quot;Construction with Suspended Cube&quot; (1935–1936) he created a mobile sculpture that generally appears to have perfect symmetry, but once the viewer glances at it from a different angle, there are aspects of asymmetry. 

== Mobiles and sculpture ==
Max Bill&#x27;s sculptures were only the beginning of the style of movement that kinetic explored. Tatlin, Rodchenko, and Calder especially took the stationary sculptures of the early 20th century and gave them the slightest freedom of motion. These three artists began with testing unpredictable movement, and from there tried to control the movement of their figures with technological enhancements. The term &quot;mobile&quot; comes from the ability to modify how gravity and other atmospheric conditions affect the artist&#x27;s work.

Although there is very little distinction between the styles of mobiles in kinetic art, there is one distinction that can be made. Mobiles are no longer considered mobiles when the spectator has control over their movement. This is one of the features of virtual movement. When the piece only moves under certain circumstances that are not natural, or when the spectator controls the movement even slightly, the figure operates under virtual movement.

Kinetic art principles have also influenced mosaic art. For instance, kinetic-influenced mosaic pieces often use clear distinctions between bright and dark tiles, with three-dimensional shape, to create apparent shadows and movement.

=== Vladimir Tatlin ===
Russian artist and founder-member of the Russian Constructivism movement Vladimir Tatlin is considered by many artists and art historians to be the first person to ever complete a mobile sculpture. The term mobile wasn&#x27;t coined until Rodchenko&#x27;s time, but is very applicable to Tatlin&#x27;s work. His mobile is a series of suspended reliefs that only need a wall or a pedestal, and it would forever stay suspended. This early mobile, &quot;Contre-Reliefs Libérés Dans L&#x27;espace&quot; (1915) is judged as an incomplete work. It was a rhythm, much similar to the rhythmic styles of Pollock, that relied on the mathematical interlocking of planes that created a work freely suspended in air. 

Tatlin&#x27;s Tower or the project for the &#x27;Monument to the Third International&#x27; (1919–20), was a design for a monumental kinetic architecture building that was never built. It was planned to be erected in Petrograd (now St. Petersburg) after the Bolshevik Revolution of 1917, as the headquarters and monument of the Comintern (the Third International).

Tatlin never felt that his art was an object or a product that needed a clear beginning or a clear end. He felt above anything that his work was an evolving process. Many artists whom he befriended considered the mobile truly complete in 1936, but he disagreed vehemently. 

=== Alexander Rodchenko ===

Russian artist Alexander Rodchenko, Tatlin&#x27;s friend and peer who insisted his work was complete, continued the study of suspended mobiles and created what he deemed to be &quot;non-objectivism&quot;. This style was a study less focused on mobiles than on canvas paintings and objects that were immovable. It focuses on juxtaposing objects of different materials and textures as a way to spark new ideas in the mind of the viewer. By creating discontinuity with the work, the viewer assumed that the figure was moving off the canvas or the medium to which it was restricted. One of his canvas works titled &quot;Dance, an Objectless Composition&quot; (1915) embodies that desire to place items and shapes of different textures and materials together to create an image that drew in the viewer&#x27;s focus.

However, by the 1920s and 1930s, Rodchenko found a way to incorporate his theories of non-objectivism in mobile study. His 1920 piece &quot;Hanging Construction&quot; is a wood mobile that hangs from any ceiling by a string and rotates naturally. This mobile sculpture has concentric circles that exist in several planes, but the entire sculpture only rotates horizontally and vertically.

=== Alexander Calder ===

Alexander Calder is an artist who many believe to have defined firmly and exactly the style of mobiles in kinetic art. Over years of studying his works, many critics allege that Calder was influenced by a wide variety of sources. Some claim that Chinese windbells were objects that closely resembled the shape and height of his earliest mobiles. Other art historians argue that the 1920s mobiles of Man Ray, including &quot;Shade&quot; (1920) had a direct influence on the growth of Calder&#x27;s art.

When Calder first heard of these claims, he immediately admonished his critics. &quot;I have never been and never will be a product of anything more than myself. My art is my own, why bother stating something about my art that isn’t true?&quot; One of Calder&#x27;s first mobiles, &quot;Mobile&quot; (1938) was the work that &quot;proved&quot; to many art historians that Man Ray had an obvious influence on Calder&#x27;s style. Both &quot;Shade&quot; and &quot;Mobile&quot; have a single string attached to a wall or a structure that keeps it in the air. The two works have a crinkled feature that vibrates when air passes through it.

Regardless of the obvious similarities, Calder&#x27;s style of mobiles created two types that are now referred to as the standard in kinetic art. There are object-mobiles and suspended mobiles. Object mobiles on supports come in a wide range of shapes and sizes and can move in any way. Suspended mobiles were first made with colored glass and small wooden objects that hung on long threads. Object mobiles were a part of Calder&#x27;s emerging style of mobiles that were originally stationary sculptures.

It can be argued, based on their similar shape and stance, that Calder&#x27;s earliest object mobiles have very little to do with kinetic art or moving art. By the 1960s, most art critics believed that Calder had perfected the style of object mobiles in such creations as the &quot;Cat Mobile&quot; (1966). In this piece, Calder allows the cat&#x27;s head and its tail to be subject to random motion, but its body is stationary. Calder did not start the trend in suspended mobiles, but he was the artist that became recognized for his apparent originality in mobile construction.

One of his earliest suspended mobiles, &quot;McCausland Mobile&quot; (1933), is different from many other contemporary mobiles simply because of the shapes of the two objects. Most mobile artists such as Rodchenko and Tatlin would never have thought to use such shapes because they didn&#x27;t seem malleable or even remotely aerodynamic.

Despite the fact that Calder did not divulge most of the methods he used when creating his work, he admitted that he used mathematical relationships to make them. He only said that he created a balanced mobile by using direct variation proportions of weight and distance. Calder&#x27;s formulas changed with every new mobile he made, so other artists could never precisely imitate the work.

== Virtual movement ==
By the 1940s, new styles of mobiles, as well as many types of sculpture and paintings, incorporated the control of the spectator. Artists such as Calder, Tatlin, and Rodchenko produced more art through the 1960s, but they were also competing against other artists who appealed to different audiences. When artists such as Victor Vasarely developed a number of the first features of virtual movement in their art, kinetic art faced heavy criticism. This criticism lingered for years until the 1960s, when kinetic art was in a dormant period.

=== Materials and electricity ===
Vasarely created many works that were considered to be interactive in the 1940s. One of his works &quot;Gordes/Cristal&quot; (1946) is a series of cubic figures that are also electrically powered. When he first showed these figures at fairs and art exhibitions, he invited people up to the cubic shapes to press the switch and start the color and light show. Virtual movement is a style of kinetic art that can be associated with mobiles, but from this style of movement there are two more specific distinctions of kinetic art.

== Apparent movement and op art ==
Apparent movement is a term ascribed to kinetic art that evolved only in the 1950s. Art historians believed that any type of kinetic art that was mobile independent of the viewer has apparent movement. This style includes works that range from Pollock&#x27;s drip technique all the way to Tatlin&#x27;s first mobile. By the 1960s, other art historians developed the phrase &quot;op art&quot; to refer to optical illusions and all optically stimulating art that was on canvas or stationary. This phrase often clashes with certain aspects of kinetic art that include mobiles that are generally stationary.

In 1955, for the exhibition &quot;Mouvements&quot; at the Denise René gallery in Paris, Victor Vasarely and Pontus Hulten promoted in their &quot;Yellow manifesto&quot; some new kinetic expressions based on optical and luminous phenomenon as well as painting illusionism. The expression &quot;kinetic art&quot; in this modern form first appeared at the Museum für Gestaltung of Zürich in 1960, and found its major developments in the 1960s. In most European countries, it generally included the form of optical art that mainly makes use of optical illusions, such as op art, represented by Bridget Riley, as well as art based on movement represented by Yacov Agam, Carlos Cruz-Diez, Jesús Rafael Soto, Gregorio Vardanega, Martha Boto or Nicolas Schöffer. From 1961 to 1968, GRAV (&quot;Groupe de Recherche d’Art Visuel&quot;) founded by François Morellet, Julio Le Parc, Francisco Sobrino, Horacio Garcia Rossi, Yvaral, Joël Stein and Vera Molnár was a collective group of opto-kinetic artists. According to its 1963 manifesto, GRAV appealed to the direct participation of the public with an influence on its behavior, notably through the use of interactive labyrinths.

==Contemporary work==
In November 2013, the MIT Museum opened &quot;5000 Moving Parts&quot;, an exhibition of kinetic art, featuring the work of Arthur Ganson, Anne Lilly, Rafael Lozano-Hemmer, John Douglas Powers, and Takis. The exhibition inaugurates a &quot;year of kinetic art&quot; at the Museum, featuring special programming related to the artform.

Neo-kinetic art has been popular in China where you can find interactive kinetic sculptures in many public places, including Wuhu International Sculpture Park and in Beijing.

Changi Airport, Singapore has a curated collection of artworks including large-scale kinetic installations by international artists ART+COM and Christian Moeller.

<text>The English Cyclopaedia: A new dictionary of universal knowledge (London, 1854–1862, 4to, 23 vols., 12,117 pages; supplements, 1869–1873, 4 vols., 2858 pages), was published by Charles Knight, based on the &quot;Penny Cyclopaedia&quot;, of which he had the copyright. He was assisted by Alexander Ramsay and James Thorne. It was sometimes popularly referred to as Knights Encyclopedia.

It is in four divisions, each alphabetical, and very unequal:
# Geography (4 volumes and supplement)
# Natural history (4 volumes and supplement)
# Biography (with 703 lives of living persons; 6 volumes and supplement)
# Arts and sciences (8 volumes and supplement)

A supplement in four volumes, one for each section, was published between 1869 and 1873, together with a synoptical index. No further editions of the &quot;English Cyclopaedia&quot;, however, it served as the basis of the &quot;Everyman&#x27;s Encyclopaedia&quot; in 1913.

<doc id="841818" wikidata="Q1197167" url="?curid=841818" title="Wasp (novel)">
<text>Wasp is a 1957 science fiction novel by English author Eric Frank Russell. Terry Pratchett (author of the &quot;Discworld&quot; series of fantasy books) stated that he &quot;can&#x27;t imagine a funnier terrorists&#x27; handbook.&quot; &quot;Wasp&quot; is generally considered Russell&#x27;s best novel.

The title of &quot;Wasp&quot; comes from the idea that the main character&#x27;s actions and central purpose mimic that particular insect; just as something as small as a wasp can terrorise a much larger creature in control of a car to the point of causing a crash and killing the occupants, so the defeat of an enemy may be wrought via psychological and guerrilla warfare by a small, but deadly, antagonist in their midst.

==Plot summary==
Set in the future, the story is about protagonist James Mowry and an inter-planetary war between humans (collectively referred to as &quot;Terrans&quot;) and the Sirians (collectively referred to as the Sirian Empire, from Sirius). The war has been on for nearly a year as the story begins. The Terrans, while technologically more advanced than the Sirians, are outnumbered and out-gunned twelve-to-one.

The Sirians are a humanoid species that share many of the same physical characteristics as their Terran enemies. Some of the more noticeable differences are their purple-faced complexions, pinned-back ears and a bow-legged gait. The Sirian Empire is reminiscent of fascist states that existed in the Second World War; they frequently employ a much-feared secret police force named the Kaimina Tempiti, or Kaitempi; they censor much of their media and they quell opposition to the government or the war through the use of violence and intimidation.

The novel begins by introducing James Mowry as he is being recruited by the Terran government to infiltrate enemy lines; to become a &quot;wasp&quot;, in the sense portrayed in the opening passages of the novel. His recruitment is somewhat less than voluntary: Mowry is offered the alternative of conscription and assignment to the front. His dossier states that he can be counted on to do anything provided the alternative is worse; he accepts the assignment.

Despite being coerced, Mowry is an ideal recruit, having spent the first seventeen years of his life living under the Sirian Empire. After extensive technical training and surgery to make him appear to be Sirian, he is sent to the Sirian outpost world of Jaimec to begin his mission. The first phase of his mission involves placing stickers with subversive slogans, such as &quot;War makes wealth for the few, misery for the many. At the right time, Dirac Angestun Gesept will punish the former, bring aid and comfort to the latter&quot; and &quot;Those who stand upon the platform and openly approve the war will stand upon the scaffold and weepingly regret it. Dirac Angestun Gesept&quot; all over the Jaimecan towns in the hope of beginning to create the first murmurings of confusion and concern in Sirian society.

Mowry begins the second phase: sending letters to people of importance informing them of deaths by a mythical rebel organisation named &quot;Dirac Angestun Gesept&quot; (Sirian Freedom Party). Mowry moves on to phase three, the hiring of Sirian civilians as contract killers to assassinate prominent members of the Kaitempi and other government officials. With the Sirians becoming more concerned about the disruption they believe the &quot;D.A.G.&quot; is causing, Mowry&#x27;s success allows him to move on to phase four.

Mowry plants fake wire tapping devices on several buildings (including the Kaitempi headquarters) to engender paranoia. He also continues to spread rumours via Sirian civilians to plant other seeds of doubt among the populace.

With a Terran invasion imminent, Mowry is told to skip to phase nine, the sabotaging of Jaimecan sea-borne commerce to divert Sirian concern from the real – and approaching – threat. This time, the Terrans strike and the invasion begins. Mowry is captured by a Terran occupation force and is held for a few days before a government man recognises that he is Terran. The novel ends with a government man informing Mowry that a wasp on another world has been captured and that he is the replacement.

==Themes==
The novel portrays the Sirian Empire&#x27;s censorship, suppression and police state as folly and oppression. &quot;Wasp&quot; frequently employs wry, black humour when dealing with these ideas and themes.

==Reception==
Terry Pratchett talks of the ironic nature in Russell&#x27;s storytelling; that &quot;Wasp&quot; is a &quot;fun[ny] terrorists&#x27; handbook&quot;. An example of this humour is found in the protagonist&#x27;s letter to the Sirian Central Bureau of Records in which he mockingly registers the rebel organisation &quot;Dirac Angestun Gesept&quot; as a legitimate organisation:

The novel has also been praised for its gritty realism. Along with the alien culture being more believable by including slang (such as &quot;yar&quot; for yes and &quot;nar&quot; for no), Mowry&#x27;s creative disruption is seen as astute. As Rupert Neethling of &quot;infinity plus&quot; states, &quot;One has to wonder whether Eric Frank Russell applied firsthand knowledge of espionage or sabotage when writing his 1957 classic&quot;, Wasp. &quot;At the very least, he seems to have had access to some kind of saboteur&#x27;s checklist&quot;. As Russell was in the Royal Air Force during the Second World War, he may well have had experience of the operations of the British Special Operations Executive agents who were trained to disrupt the Nazis in occupied Europe in much the same way as Mowry does in &quot;Wasp&quot;.

&quot;Galaxy&quot; reviewer Floyd C. Gale praised the novel, saying &quot;Russell has invested this hard-boiled yarn with plenty of action and authenticity.&quot; Dave Langford reviewed &quot;Wasp&quot; for &quot;White Dwarf&quot; #76 and stated that &quot;Fast and funny - but less so than &quot;Granada&quot;&#x27;s definitive editions, which like Dobson&#x27;s hardback gained much from Russell&#x27;s later (1958) revisions&quot;. James Sallis, writing in &quot;The Boston Globe&quot;, discusses how prescient Russell now seems. &quot;Wasp&quot; &quot;gives off jolts of shock that Russell could not have anticipated&quot;. Sallis quoted Russell,

While letter bombs and small nuclear weapons were not unheard-of in 1957, the book anticipates the bombing campaigns of the Troubles from the late 60s and the fear of nuclear terrorism from the mid-70s.

<text>The European Tour, currently titled as the DP World Tour for sponsorship reasons, and legally the PGA European Tour or the European Tour Group, is the leading men&#x27;s professional golf tour in Europe. The organisation also operates the European Senior Tour (for players aged 50 or older) and the developmental Challenge Tour; the second tier of men&#x27;s professional golf in Europe. The tour&#x27;s headquarters are at the Wentworth Club in Virginia Water, Surrey, England. The European Tour was established by the British-based Professional Golfers&#x27; Association through the 1970s, and responsibility was transferred to an independent PGA European Tour organisation in 1984.

Most tournaments on the PGA European Tour&#x27;s three tours are held in Europe, but starting in the 1980s an increasing number have been held in other parts of the world; in 2015 a majority of the ranking events on the European Tour were held outside Europe, though this included both Majors and World Golf Championship events that are ranking events for multiple tours. Europe-based events are nearly all played in Western Europe, with the most lucrative of them taking place in the United Kingdom, Ireland, Germany, France and Spain.

The PGA European Tour is a golfer-controlled organisation whose primary purpose is to maximise the income of tournament golfers. It is a company limited by guarantee and is run by a professional staff but controlled by its playing members via a board of directors composed of 12 elected past and present tour players and a tournament committee of 14 current players. The Chairman of the Board is Eric Nicoli, who replaced David Williams in 2023. The chairman of the tournament committee is David Howell.

The PGA European Tour is the lead partner in Ryder Cup Europe, a joint venture also including the PGA of Great Britain and Ireland and PGA of Europe that operates the Ryder Cup Matches in cooperation with the PGA of America. The PGA European Tour has a 60% interest in Ryder Cup Europe, with each of its junior partners holding 20%.

In June 2023, it was announced that the PGA Tour, LIV Golf and the European Tour would merge under a single organisation.

==History==
Professional golf began in Europe, specifically in Scotland. The first professionals were clubmakers and greenkeepers who also taught golf to the wealthy men who could afford to play the game (early handmade equipment was expensive) and played &quot;challenge matches&quot; against one another for purses put up by wealthy backers. The first multi-competitor stroke play tournament was The Open Championship, which was introduced in 1860. Over the following decades, the number of golf tournaments offering prize money increased slowly but steadily. Most were in the United Kingdom, but there were also several &quot;national opens&quot; in various countries of Continental Europe.

In 1901, The Professional Golfers&#x27; Association was founded to represent the interests of professional golfers throughout Great Britain and Ireland, and it was this body that ultimately created the European Tour. As the tournament circuit grew, in 1937 the Harry Vardon Trophy was created to be awarded to the member of the PGA with the best stroke average in select major stroke play tournaments of the season. This would later become known as the Order of Merit, and at different times has been calculated using stroke average, a points system and money earned. Each year the PGA would determine which tournaments were to be included for the Order of Merit.

By the post-World War II period prize money was becoming more significant, with sponsors being attracted by the introduction of television coverage, and as such it was becoming more feasible for professional golfers to make a living by playing alone. In the United States a formal organised tour, which later became known as the PGA Tour, had been administered by the PGA of America since the 1930s. However even into the 1960s and 1970s, the majority of tournaments in Europe were still organised separately by the host golf club or association, or a commercial promoter.

In 1972 The Professional Golfers&#x27; Association created an integrated &quot;European tour&quot; with the inclusion of eight major tournaments in Continental Europe on their Order of Merit schedule. These tournaments were the French Open, which was first included in 1970; the Italian, Spanish, German and Swiss Opens, which were included in 1971; and the Dutch Open, the Madrid Open and the Lancia d&#x27;Oro tournament, which were included for the first time. As such the 1972 season is now officially recognised as the first season of the PGA European Tour. For several years, the British PGA and continental circuits continued to run separately, each with their own Order of Merit. Following the example set in the United States, and having been threatened with a breakaway, in 1975 the PGA agreed to amend their constitution giving the tournament side more autonomy with the formation of the &quot;Tournament Players Division&quot;. In 1977 the Tournament Players Division joined with the &quot;Continental Tournament Players Association&quot; to become the European Tournament Players Division, and the following year it was agreed with the European Golf Association that the Continental Order of Merit would be discontinued.

In its early years the season ran for six months from April to October, and was based entirely in Europe, mainly in Great Britain and Ireland. Over the next three decades the tour gradually lengthened and globalised. The first event held outside Europe was the 1982 Tunisian Open. That year, there were 27 tournaments and the season stretched into November for the first time. In 1984, the PGA European Tour became independent of The Professional Golfers&#x27; Association. The following year, the tour became &quot;all-exempt&quot; with the end of pre-qualifying for tournaments.

The European Tour has always been sensitive to the risk that its best players will leave to play on the PGA Tour for many reasons. The PGA Tour usually offers higher purses and European players want to increase their chances of glory in the three majors played in the U.S. by playing on more U.S.-style courses to acclimate themselves. In an attempt to counter this phenomenon, the European Tour introduced the &quot;Volvo Bonus Pool&quot; in 1988. This was extra prize money which was distributed at the end of the season to the most successful players of the year—but only golfers who had played in a high number of the European Tour&#x27;s events could receive a share. This system continued until 1998, after which renewed emphasis was placed on maximising prize money in individual tournaments.

In 1989, the tour visited Asia for the first time for the Dubai Desert Classic. By 1990, there were 38 events on the schedule, including 37 in Europe, and the start of the season had moved up to February. A first visit to East Asia for the Tour occurred at the 1992 Johnnie Walker Classic in Bangkok. This has since proven to be one of the most notable initiatives in the history of the tour, as East Asia is becoming almost its second home. Shortly afterwards the tour also made its debut in the former Soviet Bloc at the 1994 Czech Open, but much less has come of this development as participation in golf in the former Soviet region remains low and sponsors there are unable to compete financially with their Western European rivals for the limited number of slots available on the main tour each summer. However, the second-tier Challenge Tour has visited Central and Eastern Europe somewhat more frequently. In 1995, the European Tour began a policy of co-sanctioning tournaments with other PGA Tours, by endorsing the South African PGA Championship on the Southern African Tour (now the Sunshine Tour). This policy was extended to the PGA Tour of Australasia in 1996, and most extensively to the Asian Tour.

In 1998, the European Tour added the three U.S. majors – the Masters Tournament, the PGA Championship and the U.S. Open – to its official schedule. The leading European Tour players had all been competing in them for many years, but now their prize money counted towards the Order of Merit (a year later for the Masters Tournament), which sometimes made a great deal of difference to the end-of-season rankings. The following year, in 1999, the World Golf Championships were established with the three individual tournaments, also offering substantially more prize money than most European events, added to the European Tour schedule.

Since the minimum number of events that a player must play to retain membership of the European Tour was eleven, the addition of the majors and WGCs meant that players could potentially become members, or retain membership, of the tour by playing just four other events. Players such as Ernie Els and Retief Goosen have taken advantage of this to play the PGA and European Tours concurrently. For the 2009 season, the minimum number of events required for members was increased to twelve; this coincided with the elevation of the HSBC Champions, previously a European Tour event co-sanctioned by three other tours, to World Golf Championships status. The minimum increased to 13 in 2011, but beginning in 2013 team events such as the Ryder Cup and Presidents Cup were allowed to count towards the minimum. In 2016 the 13-event minimum was changed to five events, not counting the four majors and four WGCs; while this change did not affect players eligible for all the majors and WGCs, it made it easier for players not eligible for these to retain European Tour membership while playing a full PGA Tour schedule. The minimum was reduced from five to four in 2018.

In November 2021, the tour was retitled as the DP World Tour as part of a sponsorship agreement with Dubai-based DP World.

===Strategic alliance with the PGA Tour===
In November 2020, the tour entered into a &quot;strategic alliance&quot; with the PGA Tour. As part of the agreement, the PGA Tour acquired a 15% stake in European Tour Productions, the Scottish Open gained a new title sponsor and became co-sanctioned by the PGA Tour, and two regular PGA Tour tournaments also became co-sanctioned by the European Tour: the Barbasol Championship and the Barracuda Championship. There was also a new sponsor and increased prize fund for the Irish Open. In June 2022, in response to the emergence of LIV Golf, the tours announced that the PGA Tour were increasing their stake to 40% and further changes to the tour, including increased prize funds and leading players in the DP World Tour Rankings gaining PGA Tour cards for the following season.

==Status and prize money==
The European Tour is considered the second most important tour in men&#x27;s golf, behind the United States–based PGA Tour, but retains significantly higher standing than other leading golf tours around the world. This status is reflected by the minimum world ranking points available in each tours respective tournaments, and prize money available. The total prize money available on the European Tour is approximately half that of the PGA Tour. However, this includes the majors and World Golf Championships, which are the most lucrative on the schedule, so the difference for regular tournaments is substantially higher. There is also much more variation in prize funds between tournaments on the European Tour than on the PGA Tour. Even though the prize funds of many European Tour events have increased rapidly since the late 1990s, especially with the introduction of the &quot;Race to Dubai&quot; and the &quot;Rolex Series&quot;, on occasion the European Tour has failed to attract as many leading players to its events as in the past, with even some of the top European players staying away.

For many players, the European Tour is seen as a stepping-stone to the PGA Tour. During the late twentieth century, the European Tour was traditionally the first overseas move for outstanding players from non-European countries, particularly in the Commonwealth, long a major source for elite golfers, such as Greg Norman, Nick Price and Ernie Els. These players tended to move to the PGA Tour as a second step. When Continental Europe produced its first global golf stars in the 1970s, such as Seve Ballesteros, and especially when Europe began to notch wins over the United States in the Ryder Cup in the mid-1980s, there was widespread optimism about the future standing of the European Tour relative to the PGA Tour. This has ebbed away as leading players continued to base themselves in the United States and several major European countries, such as Germany and Italy, have not regularly produced high-ranked golfers, as was formerly anticipated. Nonetheless, the number of European countries which have produced winners on the European Tour and PGA Tour has increased, with notable golfing depth developing in the Scandinavian countries.

However, since the late-1990s more young golfers from around the world are starting their careers directly in the United States, often having attended college as amateurs, usually with golf scholarships, before turning professional. Conversely, some young American players have sought to kick-start their professional careers in Europe, having failed to qualify for either PGA Tour or its development tour. For example, former world number one amateur, Peter Uihlein, announced in December 2011 that he would not return for his final semester at Oklahoma State University and would begin professional play in Europe the following month, both through sponsor&#x27;s exemptions on the main European Tour and on the developmental Challenge Tour. It is a route that has been successfully followed, most notably by multiple major winner Brooks Koepka.

It has been claimed that the finances of the European Tour depend heavily on the Ryder Cup. Days before the start of the 2014 Ryder Cup, American golf journalist Bob Harig noted,In simple terms, the European Tour loses money in non-Ryder Cup years, makes a tidy profit in years the event is played in the United States (where the PGA of America, not the PGA Tour, owns the event and reaps the majority of the income), and then hits the lottery in years the tournament is staged in Europe. Earlier this year, &quot;Golfweek&quot; reported that the European Tour made more than 14 million pounds in pre-tax profit in 2010, the last time the Ryder Cup was staged in Europe. A year later, when there was no Ryder Cup, it lost more than 2.2 million pounds. Harig also added that the PGA European Tour extracts significant concessions from Ryder Cup venues. The owners of the 2006 and 2010 venues (respectively Sir Michael Smurfit and Sir Terry Matthews) committed to hosting European Tour events at their venues for more than a decade after winning bidding, and guaranteed the purses for those tour events.

==The structure of the European Tour season==
===A typical season===
Since 2000, with the exception of 2012, the season has actually started late in the previous calendar year, but the seasons are still named by calendar year, rather than for example 2005–06, which would reflect the actual span of play. All of the events up until late March take place outside Europe, with most of these being co-sanctioned with other tours. From then on, the tour plays mainly in Europe, and the events in its home continent generally have higher prize money than those held elsewhere, excluding the major championships, which were added to the tour schedule in 1998; three individual World Golf Championships events, added the following year, most of which take place in the United States; and the HSBC Champions, elevated to World Golf Championships status in 2009.

There are generally only minor variations in the overall pattern from one year to the next. Occasionally tournaments change venue, and quite often change name, particularly when they get a new sponsor, but the principal events have fixed and traditional places in the schedule, and this determines the rhythm of the season.

===Race to Dubai===
In 2009, the Order of Merit was replaced by the Race to Dubai, with a bonus pool of US$7.5 million (originally $10 million) distributed among the top 15 players at the end of the season, with the winner taking $1.5 million (originally $2 million). The new name reflected the addition of a new season ending tournament, the Dubai World Championship, held at the end of November in Dubai. The tournament also had a $7.5 million prize fund (originally $10 million), and was contested by the leading 60 players in the race following the season&#x27;s penultimate event, the Hong Kong Open. The winner of the Race to Dubai also receives a ten-year European Tour exemption, while the winner of the Dubai World Championship receives a five-year exemption. The reduction in prize money, announced in September 2009, was due to the global economic downturn. In 2012, the bonus pool was reduced to $3.75 million with the winner getting $1 million and only the top 10 golfers getting a bonus. The bonus pool was increased to $5 million in 2014 with the top 15 players earning part of the pool. 2019 saw further changes: in 2018 the top 10 finishers on the Race to Dubai shared the bonus pool of $5 million, but as of 2019 the sum was split between only the leading five finishers. Whoever topped the standings received an additional $2 million compared with the $1.25 million won by Francesco Molinari in 2018. In addition, the DP World Tour Championship, Dubai was cut to the top 50 golfers on the Race to Dubai list, the prize fund was kept at $8 million but the winner&#x27;s share was increased to $3 million. This was designed to increase interest and player participation in the event.

In November 2021, the Race to Dubai was renamed the DP World Tour Rankings in line with the tour being retitled as the DP World Tour. However, in November 2022, the tour announced that the Rankings would be reverted to the Race to Dubai, starting from the 2023 season.

===Rolex Series===

For the 2017 season, the European Tour launched the Rolex Series, a series of events with higher prize funds than regular tour events. The series began with eight events, each with a minimum prize fund of $7 million.

==Order of Merit winners==

The European Tour&#x27;s money list was known as the &quot;Order of Merit&quot; until 2009, when it was replaced by the Race to Dubai. It is calculated in euro, although around half of the events have prize funds which are fixed in other currencies, mainly pounds sterling or U.S. dollars. In these instances, the amounts are converted into euro at the exchange rate for the week that the tournament is played. The winner of the Order of Merit receives the Harry Vardon Trophy, not to be confused with the Vardon Trophy awarded by the PGA of America.

==Leading career money winners==
The table below shows the top 10 career money leaders on the European Tour. Due to increases in prize money over the years, it is dominated by current players. The figures are not the players&#x27; complete career earnings as most of them have earned millions more on other tours (especially the PGA Tour) or from non-tour events. In addition, elite golfers often earn several times as much from endorsements and golf-related business interests as they do from prize money.
&quot;As of 10 December 2023.&quot;

==Awards==
===Golfer of the Year===
The European Tour Golfer of the Year was an award handed by a panel comprising members of the Association of Golf Writers and commentators from television and radio. The award was created in 1985 and lasted until 2020, when it merged with the Players&#x27; Player of the Year award in 2021.

===Players&#x27; Player of the Year===
The European Tour Players&#x27; Player of the Year was inaugurated in 2008, with the winner being determined by a vote of tour members. In 2017 the award was renamed as the Seve Ballesteros Award in honour of the legendary Spanish golfer. From 2021 onwards, the Seve Ballesteros Award merged with the Golfer of the Year award, creating one singular honour voted for by the players.

===Rookie of the Year===
The Sir Henry Cotton Rookie of the Year award is named after the English three-time Open Champion Sir Henry Cotton. Originally chosen by Henry Cotton himself, the winner was later selected by a panel consisting of the PGA European Tour, The Royal and Ancient Golf Club of St Andrews and the Association of Golf Writers. It is currently given to the rookie who places highest in the Race to Dubai. The award was first presented in 1960, and thus predates the official start of the tour in 1972. There have been five years when no award was made.

===Graduate of the Year===
The European Challenge Tour Graduate of the Year was inaugurated in 2013 and is awarded to the highest ranked player in the Race to Dubai who graduated from the Challenge Tour in the previous season.

<doc id="841831" wikidata="Q314413" url="?curid=841831" title="Kirk Hinrich">
<text>Kirk James Hinrich ( born January 2, 1981) is an American former professional basketball player. He has also been a member of the USA National Team.

Growing up in Sioux City, Iowa, Hinrich was exposed to basketball at an early age. His father, Jim, coached him from the third grade through high school.

As a high school senior, Hinrich was named the 1999 Co-Iowa Mr. Basketball, along with future college teammate and roommate Nick Collison. Hinrich originally committed to play basketball at Iowa State but when the coach at the time, Tim Floyd, took the head coaching position for the NBA&#x27;s Chicago Bulls, Hinrich changed his mind and decided to attend the University of Kansas.
Hinrich helped Kansas to consecutive Final Fours in 2002 and 2003, his junior and senior seasons. He was drafted by the Chicago Bulls with the seventh pick in the 2003 NBA Draft, where he earned the nickname &quot;Captain Kirk&quot;. Hinrich was the Bulls&#x27; all-time leader in three-point field goals until November 29, 2024 when this was surpassed by Zach LaVine. After seven seasons with the Bulls, he had short stints with the Washington Wizards and Atlanta Hawks before returning to the Bulls in 2012. In 2016, he was traded back to the Atlanta Hawks.

==Early life==
Hinrich was born to Jim and Nancy Hinrich of Sioux City, Iowa. His father played basketball at Briar Cliff College and later became a coach for Sioux City West High School. When Hinrich was about seven years old, Jim Hinrich visited Ray Nacke, his old college coach, and asked if Kirk could enroll in Nacke&#x27;s summer camp for fourth, fifth, and sixth graders. Despite Nacke&#x27;s hesitations, Hinrich was allowed to attend the camp, and played well against the older children. After just two years, Hinrich advanced to Nacke&#x27;s camp for young teenagers, and excelled there, as well.

Hinrich also played football at the quarterback position, and baseball as a pitcher. However, basketball was Hinrich&#x27;s passion. His role model was Seattle SuperSonics star Gary Payton, a player known for his strong defense. With his father as coach, Hinrich&#x27;s basketball team at Sioux City West High School achieved an 82–9 record over four years, and won the Iowa state championship when Hinrich was a senior. When he graduated, Hinrich was West High&#x27;s all-time leader in points, steals, and assists.

==College career==
As a freshman with the University of Kansas Jayhawks, Hinrich tallied 123 assists and received the Clyde Lovellette Most Improved Player Award. The next year, he ranked eighth in the nation in assists per game (6.9), led his team in steals, and set a Kansas Jayhawks record with a .505 three-point shooting mark. Hinrich was also voted onto the Associated Press All-Big 12 Second Team and earned All Third Team status from the NCAA coaches.

In his fourth and final season at Kansas, Hinrich, along with power forward Nick Collison, led the Jayhawks to the Final Four, and was voted onto the All-Big 12 Second Team by coaches and the media. He led his team in free throw shooting and three-point shooting, contributed 5.0 assists per game and received Kansas&#x27; Ted Owens Defensive Player Award. Kansas lost to Syracuse in the championship Game but Hinrich was named the Midwest Region&#x27;s Most Outstanding Player. He ranked second on his team in scoring and led it in three-pointers, while also contributing 3.5 assists per game, 3.9 rebounds per game and 1.9 steals a game. Following the season, he was named a third-team All-American by the Associated Press.

On March 1, 2009, Kansas retired Hinrich&#x27;s number 10 jersey and raised it to the rafters of Allen Fieldhouse. Hinrich&#x27;s was the 25th jersey to be retired by Kansas and is an honor reserved for the highest caliber of player, which includes names like Wilt Chamberlain and Paul Pierce. Hinrich was quoted as saying: 

==Professional career==

===Chicago Bulls (2003–2010)===

====2003 draft====
Hinrich was selected by the Chicago Bulls in the 2003 NBA draft with the seventh overall pick, resulting in mild surprise because he had been expected to be a mid to late first-round draft pick. Some doubted that his college game would translate successfully to the professional league, in part because he played shooting guard for his final two years in college and was considered too small to play that position professionally. Hinrich&#x27;s high selection in the draft is credited to a good workout in front of NBA team scouts. The Bulls needed a point guard, as Jay Williams was severely injured in a motorcycle accident. After being picked by the Bulls, Hinrich said he knew they had a need at point guard: 

====2003–04 season====
Hinrich suffered an acute viral infection shortly before the beginning of his first season, requiring months to fully recover. However, he played well after his recovery, showing a continued good grasp of fundamental skills, solid playmaking, leadership, and a surprising defensive intensity. He solidified his position as the Bulls&#x27; starting point guard and was named to the NBA&#x27;s 2004 All-Rookie first team. He held the distinction for being the only rookie during that season to record a triple-double, with 11 points, 12 rebounds and 10 assists versus the Golden State Warriors on February 28, 2004. During this same season, Hinrich&#x27;s shot accuracy inside the three-point line (38.6 percent on field goals) was actually poorer than from behind it (39.0 percent on three-pointers). Hinrich was named to the NBA&#x27;s &quot;&quot;Got Milk?&quot; All-Rookie First Team&quot; along with Dwyane Wade, LeBron James, Carmelo Anthony, and Chris Bosh. He was also awarded the Bulls&#x27; Most Valuable Player (MVP) Award or Player of the Year award (POY) for the 2003–04 season.

====2004–05 season====
In his second year, Hinrich&#x27;s field goal percentage went up to .397, a marginal improvement. Hinrich is known for his intense on-court demeanor; he was involved in a minor scuffle between the Bulls and the Washington Wizards in the preseason of his second year in the league, for which he was fined $10,000. On a drive to the basket, then Wizards player Larry Hughes head butted Hinrich out of bounds, which prompted Bulls players Antonio Davis and Eddy Curry to get into a small fight with Wizards center Brendan Haywood. Hughes, Haywood, Curry and Davis were all suspended at least one game by the NBA.
The Bulls later met the Wizards in the first round of the playoffs and the possible start of a rivalry was born. Though he began his second year as the team&#x27;s starting point guard, he was moved to the shooting guard spot nine games into the season due to the team&#x27;s 0–9 start. Ben Gordon was moved to the bench, as the Bulls&#x27; sixth man. The player who took over the starting point guard spot was rookie Chris Duhon. After this move was made, the Bulls started to gain team chemistry and the starting line-up was geared more towards defense, with Gordon coming off the bench to spark the team&#x27;s scoring. The Bulls then made a run throughout the rest of the season to finish 47–35, becoming the first team ever to start off 0–9 and reach the playoffs, where they earned the 4th seed in the Eastern Conference. After winning the first two games of their series with the Washington Wizards, they lost the next four, including a last-second loss at home in game 5, and were eliminated. During the off-season the Bulls exercised the fourth-year option on Hinrich&#x27;s contract, making him signed through the 2006–07 season. Hinrich improved in virtually every statistical category in 2004–05, including scoring (15.8 ppg), shooting (just under 40 percent from the field), rebounding (3.9 rpg) and defense (122 steals).

====2005–06 season====
In his third year in the NBA, Hinrich&#x27;s field-goal percentage went up to 41%, although his three-point shooting accuracy fell to 35%. His career free throw shooting average is 80.5%, making him one of the better free throw shooters on the Bulls. The team traded away Antonio Davis and Eddy Curry in the off-season and the team struggled until making a late-season run to gain the seventh seed in the playoffs where they faced the eventual champs, the Miami Heat, in the first round. It was in the third game of the series that the Heat&#x27;s James Posey shoulder tackled Hinrich, as he ran the fastbreak. Hinrich ended the 2005–06 season averaging a career high 15.9 ppg, a team-high 6.4 apg, and 3.6 rpg, while shooting a career high 41.8% from the field and a then career high 81.5% from the free throw line. He was the only member of the Chicago Bulls to average more than one steal per game in the 2005–06 campaign.

Hinrich received a multi-year contract extension on October 31, 2006, which was the deadline for the deal. (Otherwise Hinrich would have become a restricted free agent). Bulls GM John Paxson was quoted as saying, 

====2006–07 season====
Hinrich improved his stats in shooting and scoring during the 2006–07 season, his fourth in the NBA, with career highs in field goal, 3-point field goal, and free throw shooting percentage, as well as a career high 16.6 ppg. However, Hinrich&#x27;s assists average was the lowest of his career and he also grabbed the fewest rebounds per game of his career.

In a game against the Miami Heat, Dwyane Wade injured his wrist while being defended by Hinrich. Heat coach Pat Riley suggested that Hinrich injured Dwyane Wade&#x27;s wrist on purpose. 

Hinrich was then played a recording of what Riley said; his response was candid, as he responded by saying 

When Hinrich&#x27;s teammate Ben Gordon heard Riley&#x27;s comments, he came to his defense stating &quot;I heard him saying something about Kirk. Posey&#x27;s was way more blatant. I don&#x27;t think Kirk did anything. He was just playing aggressive defense. Kirk didn&#x27;t do anything dirty. I don&#x27;t appreciate him taking shots at our guys.&quot; &quot;Sports Illustrated&quot; columnist Chris Mannix called Riley&#x27;s comments &quot;on the border of hypocrisy&quot; while maintaining that Hinrich&#x27;s grab of Wade&#x27;s wrist, while illegal, was not a dirty play. &quot;For starters, the play itself hardly qualifies as dirty. That was not the word Riley chose, but it was certainly what he insinuated. Illegal, yes. But dirty?&quot; &quot;Hinrich had no intention of hurting Wade. He didn&#x27;t grab his wrist and twist it. He didn&#x27;t chop down on it with his other hand.&quot; He went on to describe plays like that commonplace in the NBA, while calling Posey&#x27;s foul on Hinrich during the 2006 playoffs dirty. &quot;Dirty was the cheap shot that James Posey delivered to Hinrich when he leveled the guard with a body check during last season&#x27;s playoffs.&quot;

Riley later had a different view on his comments; the next time the Bulls and Heat played Riley was questioned about the comments he made by a reporter. 

During the Bulls&#x27; first game of the 2007 playoffs against the Miami Heat, Hinrich threw his mouthpiece into the stands after being assessed a charging foul. Hinrich received a technical foul for his actions as well as a $25,000 fine.

Technically Hinrich should have been ejected from the game but he was allowed to stay in. Bulls coach Scott Skiles was quoted as saying &quot;What Kirk did the other (day), that&#x27;s supposed to be an automatic ejection. They didn&#x27;t see it. Hopefully, nothing like that happens again.&quot; The Bulls went on to sweep the Heat, before being eliminated in 6 games by the Detroit Pistons.

Hinrich was named to the NBA&#x27;s All Defensive second team in the 06–07 season. Hinrich received 7 first team votes and 4 second team votes, for a total of 18 points. Hinrich joined teammate Ben Wallace on the 06–07 All Defensive second team.

====2007–08 season====
In the season, Hinrich&#x27;s numbers dropped across the board, averaging then-career lows in points (11.5), assists (6.0), rebounds (3.3), and minutes played (31.7). He only appeared in 75 games and started 72 of them due to minor injuries. The Bulls missed the playoffs in the 2007–08 season finishing with a dismal 33–49 season.

Hinrich scored a career-high 38 points in a win over the Indiana Pacers on January 23, 2008.

====2008–09 season====
Due to the arrival of number one pick Derrick Rose, Hinrich was relegated to a backup role at the point guard position for the 2008–2009 season. Injuries also held him to just 51 games played on the season, with only 4 starts.

During the 2009 NBA Playoffs Hinrich averaged 30.0 minutes per game, 2.9 assists per game, 1.7 steals per game and 12.6 points per game. The Bulls lost to the Celtics in the first round of the playoffs in a thrilling seven-game series.

====2009–10 season====
On February 20, 2010, in a game against the Philadelphia 76ers, Hinrich became the Bulls&#x27; all-time leader in three-point field goals, surpassing Ben Gordon&#x27;s record of 770. On April 13, 2010, Hinrich produced a season high 30 points in a 101–93 win over the Boston Celtics.

Hinrich finished the season averaging 10.9 points per game, 4.5 assists per game, and 1.2 steals per game as the Bulls made the final 8th seed spot in the Eastern Conference playoffs. In the playoffs, Hinrich averaged 12.4 points and 4 assists per game, but the Bulls lost to the Cleveland Cavaliers in five games.

===Washington Wizards (2010–2011)===

On July 8, 2010, Hinrich was traded to the Washington Wizards along with draft rights to forward Kevin Seraphin in exchange for draft rights to Vladimir Veremeenko. Hinrich began to wear glasses during gameplay during his tenure with the Wizards after learning from Wizards optometrist Keith Smithson that he could lose sight in his left eye if he was hit. In his short tenure with the Wizards, he averaged 11.1 points, 4.4 assists and 2.2 rebounds per game.

===Atlanta Hawks (2011–2012)===
On February 23, 2011, Hinrich was traded to the Atlanta Hawks along with Hilton Armstrong in exchange for Mike Bibby, Jordan Crawford, Maurice Evans and a first-round pick in the 2011 NBA draft. At the end of the 2010–11 season, the Hawks made the playoffs as the fifth seed in the Eastern Conference. In Game 6 of the first round against the Orlando Magic, Hinrich injured his hamstring and subsequently missed the entire second round of the playoffs in which the Hawks ended up losing to Hinrich&#x27;s former team, the Chicago Bulls.

Hinrich missed the first eighteen games of the 2011–12 NBA season after undergoing left shoulder surgery. During the season, Hinrich averaged career lows in points per game at 6.6, assists per game at 2.8, and minutes per game at 25.8.

===Return to Chicago (2012–2016)===
On July 23, 2012, Hinrich signed a two-year contract to return to the Chicago Bulls.

In the absence of point guard Derrick Rose, Kirk began the 2012–13 season as the Bulls&#x27; starting point guard. Hinrich struggled with various injuries throughout the campaign, including an elbow infection and a stress reaction in his foot, shooting just 38% from the field. He finished the year averaging 7.7 points, 5.2 assists, 2.6 rebounds, and 1.1 steals in 29 minutes per game. On April 27, 2013, Hinrich played an excellent game in Game 4 of Round 1 of the 2013 NBA Playoffs vs. the Nets, scoring 18 points and dishing out 14 assists in 60 minutes of the action as the Bulls defeated the Nets 142–134 in triple overtime to give the Bulls a 3–1 series lead. However, Hinrich missed the rest of the postseason after rupturing his calf in the second quarter of that game. The Bulls were eliminated in the second round by the Miami Heat.

Hinrich started the 2013–14 season as a bench player backing up Derrick Rose, but when Rose suffered a torn meniscus ending his season just 10 games in, Hinrich again became the starter. While he struggled to start the year, shooting just 36.4% from the field and 28% on 3 pointers, he improved immensely following the All-Star Break, shooting 42.8% from the field and 43.7% from 3 for the remainder of the season. He also enjoyed a much healthier regular season campaign, with his 73 games played being his most since the 2009–10 season. His 9.1 points per game average was also his highest since the 2010–11 season.

On July 21, 2014, Hinrich re-signed with the Bulls to a reported two-year, $5.6 million contract.

On June 29, 2015, Hinrich exercised his player option with the Bulls for the 2015–16 season.

===Return to Atlanta (2016)===
On February 18, 2016, Hinrich was traded to the Atlanta Hawks in a three-team trade involving the Bulls and the Utah Jazz. Hinrich&#x27;s final NBA game was Game 2 of the 2016 Eastern Conference Semifinals on May 4, 2016. In that game, the Hawks would lose 98 – 123 to the Cleveland Cavaliers with Hinrich recording 3 points and 2 rebounds.

==International career==
In July 2006, Hinrich was officially named to the U.S. national basketball team that would compete in the 2008 Summer Olympics in Beijing, China. He was initially invited to participate in February 2006, but declined due to the pressure of making a decision in the midst of a competitive NBA season with the Chicago Bulls. After his 2005–06 season ended, however, Hinrich changed his mind and accepted a spot on the team&#x27;s roster. Hinrich said of the incident:
The roster first fielded more than 20 players, but it was soon cut down to 15 players, among which was Hinrich. When the final roster was announced, Hinrich was chosen as one of the 12 players set to compete in the FIBA World Championship in Japan. After Hinrich learned of his grandfather&#x27;s death, he briefly left the US training camp in Las Vegas early in the morning of July 25 and returned to his hometown of Sioux City, Iowa.

Hinrich started an exhibition game against Lithuania on August 13, 2006, and scored 10 points and 2 steals in a US win. After the game, Hinrich was asked about starting the game. He responded, &quot;We&#x27;re playing in groups right now. I know when I get my time, I just try to make the best of it, make sure our team is successful. It&#x27;s one of those deals when you play in groups in spurts like that, it&#x27;s a little bit tougher. But, you don&#x27;t hold back and give it everything you got because you know you&#x27;ll be rested a lot.&quot;

In the FIBA world Championship semi-final, Team USA played against the Greece national team. With 2:41 to play in the game, Hinrich connected on a three-point shot to bring the US within 5 points, but was then called for an unsportsmanlike foul on Greece center Sofoklis Schortsanitis. With 45 seconds left, he knocked down another three-pointer to pull the US within four. Hinrich was then fouled out when he intentionally hit a Greek player to stop the shot clock. Despite the US effort, the Greek sealed the deal with free throws and won 101–95. The US team then played against the Argentinian team for the bronze medal. In the game, Hinrich played against his former Bulls&#x27; teammate Andrés Nocioni. The US went on to win 96–81, and took home the bronze medal.

Hinrich dropped out of the U.S. training camp for the FIBA Americas Championship in 2007, citing personal reasons.

The &quot;Chicago Tribune&quot; reported that Hinrich dropped out of his commitment to the US national team so that he could focus on his wedding, and to &quot;hitting the weights&quot; hard. In April 2008, Hinrich revealed that he would not play for Team USA in the Beijing Olympics since his wife was expecting a baby. He said of the Olympics, &quot;It wasn&#x27;t like I was upset about anything. It just wasn&#x27;t working out for me.&quot;

==Personal life==
Hinrich was engaged to Jill Fisher in 2006. He married her on July 7, 2007. His wife gave birth to their first child, a daughter named Kenzie, in 2008. Hinrich&#x27;s wife gave birth to their second daughter, Kyla, in September 2011. On September 12, 2014, Hinrich&#x27;s wife gave birth to twins, a boy, Kolton, and a girl, Kinley. During his NBA career, Hinrich lived in Bannockburn, Illinois. Upon retiring from the NBA in 2017, Hinrich and his family moved to Sioux Falls, South Dakota, where Hinrich was hired at Sanford Power as a lead basketball specialist.

<text>The Engineer&#x27;s and Mechanic&#x27;s Encyclopaedia is a book edited by Luke Hebert, a Birmingham patent agent and journalist, and published by Thomas Kelly of Paternoster Row. The first edition appeared in 1836 and 1837. The second edition appeared in 1849. It was in two octavo volumes (Vol. 1, 796 pp and vol. 2, 928 pp), illustrated with woodcuts in the text and a number of full page engravings.

Many of the articles relate to specific processes and machines, and overall the encyclopaedia is not over-concerned with the theoretical aspects. Of particular value are the monograph-length accounts of the progress of rail transport and steamboats.

<text>Kehillas Yaakov Pupa (also &quot;Puppa&quot;; Hebrew/Yiddish: קהלת יעקב פאפא) is a Hasidic dynasty, named after the Yiddish name of the town of its origin (known in Hungarian as Pápa).

Before World War II Pupa had a yeshiva. The whole community was deported to the Auschwitz concentration camp, and only a few survived. There are no longer any Jews there.

The group is based in Williamsburg, Brooklyn, with branches in the Boro Park section of Brooklyn, Monsey, New York, Los Angeles, and Ossining, New York. It is headed by the Pupa rebbe, who has several thousand followers.

Pupa has more than 7,000 students enrolled in its yeshivas, girls schools, summer camps, and kollelim in Williamsburg, Boro Park, Monsey, Westchester County, New York, Montreal, Jerusalem, and elsewhere. In Williamsburg, Pupa is second in size to the Satmar Hasidim, with whom they share many communal facilities.

During his time at secondary school, Kaneshiro began working in television commercials, and he decided to leave school to pursue a full-time career in music and acting. Kaneshiro is multilingual, fluent in Mandarin, Hokkien, Japanese, and to lesser degrees in Cantonese and English. Taiwanese Hokkien was the first language he spoke while growing up in Taiwan.

===Name===
 is a common Okinawan surname, albeit with an unusual pronunciation, as the usual reading is Kinjō, while the traditional Okinawan pronunciation is Kanagusuku or Kanegusuku. His given name is . He appears as in Japanese media.

Since personal names are commonly written in Chinese characters in both Chinese and Japanese naming conventions, following the Eastern name order, and in this particular case the name, in its written form, appears native in both Japanese and Chinese, giving Kaneshiro the freedom to associate himself as a Japanese or Chinese when working in China by preserving or removing the space between his surname and given name.

==Career==

=== 1992 to 1999: Early years and career breakthrough ===
In 1992, Kaneshiro made his singing debut, entering the business with the nickname &quot;Aniki&quot;, meaning &#x27;older brother&#x27; in Japanese. His debut album was &quot;Heartbreaking Night&quot; (1992). Contracted to EMI, he wrote many of his own Mandarin and Cantonese songs. The following year, his popularity propelled him into acting. He no longer produces any commercial music, although certain notable roles, such as those in Peter Chan’s &quot;Perhaps&quot; &quot;Love&quot; (2005) and &quot;See&quot; &quot;You&quot; &quot;Tomorrow&quot; (2016) have required him to sing onscreen.

Kaneshiro made his film debut in &quot;Executioners&quot; (1993) and this was followed by Wong Kar-wai&#x27;s &quot;Chungking Express&quot; (1994), &quot;Fallen Angels&quot; (1995) and a string of other Hong Kong films, such as &quot;Lost&quot; &quot;and&quot; &quot;Found&quot; (1996), and &quot;Anna&quot; &quot;Magdalena&quot; (1998). It was through his collaboration with the auteur director Wong Kar Wai in &quot;Chungking&quot; &quot;Express&quot; that Kaneshiro first developed what would become his onscreen signature, namely quirky, character-driven performances that often played against type and ran counter to his idol image. Later, Kaneshiro starred in the Japanese Drama &quot;God, Please Give Me More Time&quot; (1998), allowing him to branch into Japanese films such as &quot;Returner&quot; (2002), as well as &quot;K-20: Legend of the Mask&quot; (2009) and &quot;Accuracy&quot; &quot;of&quot; &quot;Death&quot; (also titled &quot;&quot;Sweet&quot; &quot;Rain&quot;&quot;), (2010).

=== 2000 to 2010: Mainstream success ===

Kaneshiro’s work, however, is more heavily concentrated in China, Hong Kong, and Taiwan. In 2005, he sang his way through &quot;Perhaps Love&quot;, the first modern musical to be produced in China. It was the first of many collaborations with Hong Kong-based director Peter Chan. In 2008 and 2009 he starred in &quot;Red Cliff&quot;, a high budget film by Hong Kong director John Woo. He has also played the romantic lead in Zhang Yimou&#x27;s &quot;House of Flying Daggers&quot;, and starred alongside Jet Li and Andy Lau in &quot;The Warlords&quot;. He expressed excitement when he received the news that he would have an opportunity to work with Director Zhang Yimou.

Kaneshiro has also become well known in the video game industry portraying the samurai warrior Samanosuke in Capcom&#x27;s &quot;Onimusha&quot;. In a June 2007 article on the film site Ain&#x27;t It Cool News, it was revealed that Kaneshiro was going to be in the &quot;Onimusha&quot; film, reprising his role as Samanosuke and for a 2011 release, but that project was derailed. The producer Samuel Hadida had to delay the filming of &quot;Onimusha&quot;, which has resulted in the film&#x27;s Japanese cast working on other film projects during the delay, and being unavailable to start filming. These factors were enough that French director Christophe Gans will now direct an adaptation of Leo Perutz&#x27;s novel &quot;The Swedish Cavalier&quot; first, taking over the reins from Gilles Mimouni. Satomi Ishihara and Tsuyoshi Ihara remain attached to the project.

In 2003, Kaneshiro was featured in &quot;Time&quot; magazine and was dubbed the Johnny Depp of the East Asian film industry. Moreover, Kaneshiro was interviewed by journalist Hugh Riminton for CNN in the network’s TalkAsia segment in 2006.

=== 2011 to present: Selective films ===
In 2011, Kaneshiro appeared in the historical martial arts thriller &quot;Dragon&quot;, directed by Peter Chan. The film premiered at the 2011 Cannes Film Festival in the Midnight Screenings category.

In 2017, Kaneshiro was the winner of the Best Leading Actor award at the second annual Golden Screen Awards. He won for his starring role in the romantic comedy &quot;This Is Not What I Expected&quot;, which was directed by Derek Hui and produced by Peter Chan.

Kaneshiro became a member of the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences in 2018. In that same year, he completed filming for Juno Mak&#x27;s &quot;Sons of the Neon Night&quot;, with an ensemble cast that includes Tony Leung Ka Fai, Louis Koo, and Sean Lau. It was reported in 2020 that the release of this film will be postponed to 2021. The reasons given involved production issues, including budgeting and tensions between the director and cast. Kaneshiro will act as the spokesperson for the new Paradise 2M mobile multiplayer game launched in March 2021.

==Personal life==
Kaneshiro is a practicing Buddhist, having converted in 1997, and has said his mother is also a devout Buddhist. Throughout his career, Kaneshiro has been given titles such as &quot;heartthrob,&quot; &quot;dream guy,&quot; but he has maintained a steady sense of humility. Kaneshiro is also known for trying to avoid the media spotlight. He has been quoted as saying:

<doc id="841851" wikidata="Q460210" url="?curid=841851" title="Nero Digital">
<text>Nero Digital is a brand name applied to a suite of MPEG-4-compatible video and audio compression codecs developed by Nero AG of Germany and Ateme of France. The audio codecs are integrated into the &quot;Nero Digital Audio+&quot; audio encoding tool for Microsoft Windows, and the audio &amp; video codecs are integrated into Nero&#x27;s &quot;Recode&quot; DVD ripping software.

Nero certifies certain DVD player/recorder devices as Nero Digital compatible, and licenses the codec technology to integrated circuit manufacturers.

The video codecs were developed by Ateme, and according to an interview with Nero AG developer Ivan Dimkovic, the audio codecs are improved versions of Dimkovic&#x27;s older &quot;PsyTEL AAC Encoder&quot;. The audio codec is now available as a free stand-alone package called Nero AAC Codec.

== Functionality ==
Nero Digital can generate streams in the 3GP/MPEG-4 Part 14 () container format and includes two video and two audio codecs:
* ASP (one of about 20 profiles defined in MPEG-4 Part 2)
* AVC (also known as MPEG-4 Part 10 or H.264)
* AAC-LC (the most widely used AAC profile defined in MPEG-4 Part 3)
* HE-AAC (defined in MPEG-4 Part 3, sometimes referenced as &quot;aacPlus&quot; or other, similar trademarks)

The codecs are compliant with the ISO/IEC standard, with the exception of subtitles and chapter information. The video streams generated by Nero Digital can be played back on some stand-alone hardware players and software media players such as the company&#x27;s own Nero Showtime.

Recode cannot rip encrypted DVD movie discs, but is able to import decrypted DVD images for encoding. Nero Digital also does not ship its codecs as stand-alone DirectShow or VfW modules, preventing them from being used for general-purpose video editing. The product is not bundled with a video editor.

== Comparisons with other video codecs (2003-2005) ==
The Nero Digital video codecs have been featured in video compression comparisons: 
* In the 2003 Doom9 codec comparison, the ASP codec was the fastest of all the codecs, but fared relatively poorly in quality.
* The Nero Digital AVC codec was pronounced the winner of the 2004 Doom9 codec comparison. ND ASP did not compete.
* In the 2005 Doom9 codec comparison, the ASP codec was still the fastest and fared better than previously in quality, but not well enough to make it to the finals. The AVC codec came in second overall.
* In May 2005, it won the C&#x27;t magazine video codec quality comparison, competing against other AVC codecs such as x264, VideoSoft&#x27;s codec, the MainConcept codec and the Sorenson codec.
* Nero Digital AVC also won an informal 2005 &#x27;Movie Metric Benchmark challenge,&#x27; with up to a 1dB quality gain over DivX at the same bitrate.

<text>Antoine Raymond Joseph de Bruni, chevalier d&#x27;Entrecasteaux (8 November 1737 – 21 July 1793) was a French Navy officer, explorer and colonial administrator who served as the governor of Isle de France from 1787 to 1789. He is best known for his exploration of the Australian coast in 1792 while searching for Jean-François de Galaup, comte de Lapérouse.

==Early career==

Bruni d&#x27;Entrecasteaux was born to Dorothée de Lestang-Parade and Jean Baptiste Bruny, at Aix-en-Provence in 1739. His father was a member of the &quot;Parlement&quot; of Provence. Antoine Bruni d&#x27;Entrecasteaux was educated at a Jesuit school and reportedly intended to become a priest in the Society of Jesus, but his father intervened and enlisted him in the French Navy in 1754. In the action that secured the Balearic Islands for Spain (and resulted in the execution of Admiral Byng), Bruni d&#x27;Entrecasteaux was a midshipman aboard the 26-gun &quot;Minerve&quot;, and in April 1757 he was commissioned as an ensign. His further naval career as a junior officer was uneventful, and he appears in this period to have done general service in the French Navy.

For a time Bruni d&#x27;Entrecasteaux was assistant director of ports and arsenals, after which (1785) he was transferred to command a French Squadron in the East Indies, comprising &quot;Résolution&quot; and &quot;Subtile&quot;. During this service he opened up a new route to Canton by way of the Sunda Strait and the Moluccas, for use during the south-east monsoon season. In 1787 he was appointed Governor of the French colony of Isle de France (now Mauritius) and the Isle of Bourbon.

==His explorations==
In September 1791, the French Assembly decided to send an expedition in search of Jean-François de La Pérouse, who had not been heard of since leaving Botany Bay in March 1788. Bruni d&#x27;Entrecasteaux was selected to command this expedition. He was given a frigate, (500 tons), with Lieutenant Jean-Louis d&#x27;Hesmity-d&#x27;Auribeau as his second-in-command and Élisabeth Rossel among the other officers. A similar ship, , was placed under Jean-Michel Huon de Kermadec, with de Trobriand as his second-in-command. A distinguished hydrographical engineer, Beautemps-Beaupré, served as the hydrographer of the expedition.
When the expedition left Brest on 28 September 1791, Entrecasteaux was promoted to the rank of rear-admiral. The plan of the voyage was to proceed to New Holland (Australia), to sight Cape Leeuwin at its southwest extremity, then to hug the shore closely all the way to Van Diemen&#x27;s Land (Tasmania), inspecting every possible harbour in a rowing boat, and then to sail for Tonga (aka &quot;the Friendly Islands&quot;) via the northern cape of New Zealand allowing gardener Félix Delahaye to collect live breadfruit plants for transport to the French West Indies. D&#x27;Entrecasteaux was next to follow La Pérouse&#x27;s intended route in the Pacific. It was thought that La Pérouse had meant to explore New Caledonia and the Louisiade Archipelago, to pass through Torres Strait, and to explore the Gulf of Carpentaria and the northern coast of New Holland.

However, when Bruni d&#x27;Entrecasteaux reached Table Bay, Cape Town on 17 January 1792, he heard a report that Captain John Hunter (later to be Governor of New South Wales) had recently seen – off the Admiralty Islands – canoes manned by indigenous people wearing French uniforms and belts. Although Hunter denied this report, and although the Frenchmen heard of the denial, Bruni d&#x27;Entrecasteaux determined to make directly to the Admiralty Islands, nowadays part of Papua New Guinea, taking water and refreshing his crew at Van Diemen&#x27;s Land. On 20 April 1792, that land was in sight, and three days later the ships anchored in a harbour, which he named Recherche Bay. For the next five weeks, until 28 May 1792, the Frenchmen carried out careful boat explorations which revealed in detail the beautiful waterways and estuaries in the area.

Bruni d&#x27;Entrecasteaux was fortunate in having good officers and scientists, most importantly from the exploration point-of-view the expedition&#x27;s first hydrographical engineer, C.F Beautemps-Beaupré, who is now regarded as the father of modern French hydrography. The work this officer did in the field was excellent, and his charts, when published in France as an &quot;Atlas du Voyage de Bruny-Dentrecasteaux&quot; (1807) were very detailed. The atlas contains 39 charts, of which those of Van Diemen&#x27;s Land were the most detailed; they remained the source of the English charts of the area for many years.

Beautemps-Beaupré, while surveying the coasts with Lieutenant Crétin, discovered that Adventure Bay, Tasmania, which had been discovered by Tobias Furneaux and named after his ship in 1773, was on an island which was separated from the mainland by a fine navigable channel. On 16 May, d&#x27;Entrecasteaux commenced to sail the ships through the channel, and this was accomplished by the 28th. Port Esperance, the Huon River, and other features were discovered, named, and charted, the admiral&#x27;s names being given to the channel (D&#x27;Entrecasteaux Channel) and the large island (Bruny Island) separated by it from the mainland.

On 28 May 1792 the ships sailed into the Pacific to search for La Pérouse. On 17 June they arrived off the Isle of Pines, south of New Caledonia. From there, d&#x27;Entrecasteaux sailed northward along the western coast of New Caledonia. (The Bruni d&#x27;Entrecasteaux reefs at the northwestern end of the New Caledonia Barrier Reef are named for him.) He then passed the Solomon Islands along their southern or western coasts, sailed through Saint George&#x27;s Channel between New Ireland and New Britain, and on 28 July sighted the south-east coast of the Admiralty Islands. After three days spent in scrutinizing the eastern and northern coastline, Bruni d&#x27;Entrecasteaux decided that the rumours he had heard in Table Bay must be false, and he therefore set sail for Ambon, in modern-day Indonesia, where his ships replenished their stores.

Leaving Amboina on 14 October, Bruni d&#x27;Entrecasteaux made for Cape Leeuwin, the south-western extremity of Australia, to carry out his original instructions of searching southern New Holland for La Pérouse. On 6 December land was sighted near Cape Leeuwin, and named D&#x27;Entrecasteaux Point. This event was celebrated by feastings and parties, one result of which was that the smith on board &quot;Recherche&quot;, Jean-Marie Marhadour over-indulged and died next day from an apoplectic fit. The weather proved boisterous, and the ships failed to find King George Sound, originally discovered by Vancouver. As they sailed further east, they penetrated numerous islands and dangerous shoals, to which they gave the name &quot;D&#x27;Entrecasteaux Islands&quot; – later changed to the Recherche Archipelago.

While the Frenchmen were still in that dangerous area, on 12 December a violent storm descended upon them, and both ships were nearly wrecked. Fortunately, however, they found an anchorage where they were able to ride out the worst of the gale. Landings took place here on the mainland, and the locality was named in honour of Legrand, who had spotted the anchorage, and of the ship he was on, &quot;Espérance&quot;. Beautemps-Beaupré made a hasty survey of the off-lying islands of the archipelago. No water was found, and on 18 December the ships continued eastward to the head of the Great Australian Bight, but here the coast was found to be even more arid, and the water position more serious.

On 4 January 1793, Bruni d&#x27;Entrecasteaux was forced to leave the coast at a position near Bruni d&#x27;Entrecasteaux Reef and sail direct to Van Diemen&#x27;s Land. In this decision the French explorer was unfortunate, for if he had continued his examination of the southern coast of New Holland, he would have made all the geographical discoveries that fell to the lot of Bass and Flinders a few years later. Then, indeed, a French &quot;Terre Napoléon&quot; might well have become a fact.

The ships anchored in Recherche Bay on 22 January, and the expedition spent a period of five weeks in that area, watering the ships, refreshing the crews, and carrying out explorations into both natural history and geography. Beautemps-Beaupré, in company with other officers, surveyed the northern extensions to Storm Bay – the western extension was found to be a mouth of a river which received the name Rivière du Nord – it was renamed the Derwent River a few months later by the next visitor to this area, Captain John Hayes in &quot;Duke of Clarence&quot; and &quot;Duchess&quot;.

It was probably no coincidence that the d&#x27;Entrecasteaux expedition should have spent time investigating that part of Van Diemen&#x27;s Land, as that region had been recommended for colonization by Henri Peyroux de la Coudrenière in his c.1784–85 &quot;Mémoire sur les avantages qui résulteraient d&#x27;une colonie puissante à la terre de Diémen&quot;. Although Peyroux&#x27;s proposal fell on deaf ears at the time, it may have influenced d&#x27;Entrecasteaux&#x27;s choice of the location to investigate. An inset map of Frederick Henry Bay, the place recommended by Peyroux for a settlement, was included in the map of Van Diemens Land prepared by C. F. Beautemps-Beaupré, the hydrographer with the d&#x27;Entrecasteaux expedition.

On 28 February d&#x27;Entrecasteaux sailed from Van Diemen&#x27;s Land towards Tonga, sighting New Zealand and the Kermadec Islands en route. At Tonga, he found that the local people remembered Cook and Bligh well enough, but knew nothing of La Pérouse. He then sailed back to New Caledonia, where he anchored at Balade. The vain search for La Pérouse then resumed with Santa Cruz, then along the southern coasts of the Solomon Islands, the northern parts of the Louisiade Archipelago, through the Dampier Strait, along the northern coast of New Britain and the southern coast of the Admiralty Islands, and thence north of New Guinea to the Moluccas.

By this time, the affairs of the expedition had become almost desperate, largely because the officers were ardent royalists and the crews equally ardent revolutionaries. Kermadec had died of tuberculosis in Balade harbour, and on 21 July 1793, d&#x27;Entrecasteaux himself died of scurvy, off the Hermit Islands, part of the Bismarck Archipelago in Papua New Guinea.

Commands were re-arranged, with Auribeau taking charge of the expedition, with Rossel in Kermadec&#x27;s place. The new chief took the ships to Surabaya in east Java. Here it was learned that a republic had been proclaimed in France, and on 18 February 1794 Auribeau handed his vessels to the Dutch authorities so that the new French Government could not profit by them. Auribeau died a month later and Rossel sailed from Java in January 1795 on board a Dutch ship, arriving at Table Bay in April 1795. There his ship sailed unexpectedly with the expedition&#x27;s papers, leaving him behind, but this vessel was captured by the British. Rossel then took passage on a brig-of-war, but this too was captured by the British. After the Peace of Amiens in 1802, all the papers of the expedition were returned to Rossel, who was thus enabled to publish a narrative of the whole enterprise.

<text>In chemistry and biochemistry, an oligomer () is a molecule that consists of a few repeating units which could be derived, actually or conceptually, from smaller molecules, monomers. The name is composed of Greek elements &quot;&quot;, &quot;a few&quot; and &quot;&quot;, &quot;parts&quot;. An adjective form is &quot;oligomeric&quot;. 

The oligomer concept is contrasted to that of a polymer, which is usually understood to have a large number of units, possibly thousands or millions. However, there is no sharp distinction between these two concepts. One proposed criterion is whether the molecule&#x27;s properties vary significantly with the removal of one or a few of the units. 

An oligomer with a specific number of units is referred to by the Greek prefix denoting that number, with the ending &quot;-mer&quot;: thus dimer, trimer, tetramer, pentamer, and hexamer refer to molecules with two, three, four, five, and six units, respectively. The units of an oligomer may be arranged in a linear chain (as in melam, a dimer of melamine); a closed ring (as in 1,3,5-trioxane, a cyclic trimer of formaldehyde); or a more complex structure (as in tellurium tetrabromide, a tetramer of with a cube-like core). If the units are identical, one has a &quot;homo-oligomer&quot;; otherwise one may use &quot;hetero-oligomer&quot;. An example of a homo-oligomeric protein is collagen, which is composed of three identical protein chains. 
Some biologically important oligomers are macromolecules like proteins or nucleic acids; for instance, hemoglobin is a protein tetramer. An oligomer of amino acids is called an oligopeptide or just a peptide. An oligosaccharide is an oligomer of monosaccharides (simple sugars). An oligonucleotide is a short single-stranded fragment of nucleic acid such as DNA or RNA, or similar fragments of analogs of nucleic acids such as peptide nucleic acid or Morpholinos.
The units of an oligomer may be connected by covalent bonds, which may result from bond rearrangement or condensation reactions, or by weaker forces such as hydrogen bonds.

The term multimer () is used in biochemistry for oligomers of proteins that are not covalently bound. The major capsid protein VP1 that comprises the shell of polyomaviruses is a self-assembling multimer of 72 pentamers held together by local electric charges.

Many oils are oligomeric, such as liquid paraffin. Plasticizers are oligomeric esters widely used to soften thermoplastics such as PVC. They may be made from monomers by linking them together, or by separation from the higher fractions of crude oil. Polybutene is an oligomeric oil used to make putty. 

Oligomerization is a chemical process that converts monomers to macromolecular complexes through a finite degree of polymerization. Telomerization is an oligomerization carried out under conditions that result in chain transfer, limiting the size of the oligomers. (This concept is not to be confused with the formation of a telomere, a region of highly repetitive DNA at the end of a chromosome.)

==Green oil==
In the oil and gas industry, green oil refers to oligomers formed in all C2, C3, and C4 hydrogenation reactors of ethylene plants and other petrochemical production facilities; it is a mixture of C4 to C20 unsaturated and reactive components with about 90% aliphatic dienes and 10% of alkanes plus alkenes. Different heterogeneous and homogeneous catalysts are operative in producing green oils via the oligomerization of alkenes.

<doc id="841862" wikidata="Q1395716" url="?curid=841862" title="Summer in Paradise">
<text>Summer in Paradise is the twenty-seventh studio album by American rock band the Beach Boys, released on August 3, 1992, by Brother Records. Produced by Terry Melcher, it is the only album not to feature any new contributions from Brian Wilson, and has been regarded as the band&#x27;s critical and commercial low point, failing to chart in either the US or UK and receiving almost unanimously negative reviews. In North America, it was the group&#x27;s first album to be released only on CD and cassette, with a rare vinyl pressing released only in South Korea. The Beach Boys did not record another album of predominantly original material until &quot;That&#x27;s Why God Made the Radio&quot; in 2012. &quot;Summer in Paradise&quot; was left out of Capitol&#x27;s Beach Boys CD reissue campaign of 2000 to 2001, as well as all other reissues for most of the group&#x27;s discography. Both it and its predecessor, &quot;Still Cruisin&#x27;&quot;, are currently out of print. &quot;Summer in Paradise&quot;, along with &quot;Still Cruisin&quot;, were pulled from later re-releases due to poor public reception.

== Composition ==
The conceptual idea behind the album&#x27;s title song, co-written by Mike Love, was environmental protection, but the album was designed, in Love&#x27;s words, to create, &quot;the quintessential soundtrack of summer.&quot; With the exception of a new version of their 1970 track &quot;Forever&quot; and the new composition &quot;Strange Things Happen&quot;, each song on the album deals thematically with the summer season. Of the album&#x27;s twelve tracks, two songs are covers (&quot;Hot Fun in the Summertime&quot;, originally by Sly &amp; the Family Stone, and &quot;Remember (Walking in the Sand)&quot;, originally by The Shangri-Las); two are new versions of older Beach Boys songs (&quot;Surfin&#x27;&quot; and &quot;Forever&quot;, the latter with a vocal by John Stamos); one combines a classic song (&quot;One Summer Night&quot;, originally by The Danleers) with a new Bruce Johnston song (&quot;Slow Summer Dancin&#x27;&quot;); and one takes an old song (&quot;Under the Boardwalk,&quot; originally by The Drifters) and adds new lyrics. The rest are original songs, all containing both titular and lyrical references to summer and/or surfing, with the exception of the Transcendental Meditation-influenced &quot;Strange Things Happen&quot;. The quasi-rap song &quot;Summer of Love&quot; was originally intended to be a duet with Bart Simpson for a planned &quot;Simpsons&quot; movie, but the Simpsons&#x27; producers turned down the offer. The song was instead used in an episode of &quot;Baywatch&quot;. Stamos performed the song &quot;Forever&quot; on several episodes of his sitcom &quot;Full House&quot;.

== Production ==
&quot;Summer in Paradise&quot; was one of the first albums to be recorded using the Pro Tools digital audio workstation, via a Beta version on a Macintosh Quadra computer. Musically, it continued in the vein of previous albums &quot;The Beach Boys&quot; and &quot;Still Cruisin&quot;&#x27; in its use of electronic instrumentation. The entire rhythm section was electronic on most songs, with all the drum parts being programmed (although not credited as such), and most of the bass parts were also synthesized. Former Beach Boys collaborator Van Dyke Parks played accordion on two tracks, and producer Terry Melcher contributed keyboard parts, with Al Jardine&#x27;s son Adam singing backup vocals on the title track. Touring musician Adrian Baker sang backup but other regular members of the contemporary Beach Boys&#x27; touring band did not contribute to the album. Mike Love and Melcher were the main composers on the album, with Johnston being the only other member to contribute a new song. Jardine had allegedly been &quot;suspended&quot; from the band prior to the album&#x27;s recording, supposedly because of a dispute about content; however, he returned during the sessions to sing lead vocals on two of the album&#x27;s songs and contributed to the partial rerecording of tracks for the UK issue on EMI.

Different versions of six tracks appeared on the album&#x27;s 1993 release in the United Kingdom. This included completely re-recorded and partially rewritten versions of &quot;Island Fever&quot; and &quot;Summer in Paradise&quot;, the latter of which featured new lead vocals from Roger McGuinn on one verse. Carl Wilson&#x27;s vocals on &quot;Island Fever&quot; had also been replaced with vocals by Al Jardine. &quot;Strange Things Happen&quot;, &quot;Remember (Walking in the Sand)&quot;, &quot;Under the Boardwalk&quot;, and &quot;Forever&quot; were remixed and shortened, though the bridge of The Drifters&#x27; original version of &quot;Under the Boardwalk&quot; was recorded and added to the track&#x27;s mix.

== Packaging ==
The artwork featured on the cover of this release, as well as the similar pieces that feature throughout the package, were painted by fellow Californian artist Robert Lyn Nelson. The original US front sleeve features the painting &quot;Elements of the Universe&quot;, while the album gatefold includes further Nelson works, notably &quot;Ring of Life&quot; (used for the alternate UK pressing), &quot;Embraced By the Sea&quot;, and &quot;Amethyst Dawn at Kipahulu&quot;. The album packaging art direction and design by Spencer Drate with Judith Salavetz using the artwork of Robert Lyn Nelson on the multi-panels and CD disc.

== Promotion ==
&quot;Hot Fun in the Summertime&quot; was packaged with &quot;Summer of Love&quot; as the first and only commercial single released in promotion of the album, in July 1992. &quot;Forever&quot; was released as a promotional single to radio stations in the United States later in the year. The single provided three different mixes of the track: &quot;AC Mix,&quot; &quot;CHR Mix&quot; and &quot;CD Mix.&quot; The &quot;CHR mix&quot; was remixed by John Stamos and Gary Griffin and is a unique remix which differs from the US and UK album versions. Stamos helped give the album further promotion during the 1993 season of his hit television show, &quot;Full House&quot;; a poster for the album and CD are frequently shown in the studio where he hosts his daily radio show. Additionally, &quot;Summer of Love&quot; was also released as a promotional single in the United States in 1995, to tie in with the band&#x27;s appearance on &quot;Baywatch&quot; that year.

== Reception ==
&quot;Summer in Paradise&quot; was received very poorly commercially and critically. Described by &quot;Blender&quot; as a &quot;train wreck&quot;, the album is the only Beach Boys studio album that failed to make &quot;Billboard&quot;&#x27;s Top Pop Albums chart; it reportedly sold fewer than 1000 copies on its release, making it the Beach Boys album with by far the poorest commercial sales performance. The poor sales of the US release reportedly contributed to independent distributor Navarre becoming bankrupt. Navarre and EMI each only issued one print run of the album on CD. It has been out of print since its initial release and has since become a collectors&#x27; item. A large number of unsold copies of the album were unloaded when the QVC network bundled them with the &quot;Good Vibrations: Thirty Years of the Beach Boys&quot; CD box set in 1993. 

Andrew G. Doe and John Tobler, authors of &quot;The Complete Guide to the Music of The Beach Boys&quot;, described &quot;Summer in Paradise&quot; as, &quot;the absolute nadir of their recording career.&quot; In an online interview, Doe said he had to listen to the album three times while writing the book, &quot;which has probably scarred me for life.&quot; William Ruhlmann of Allmusic said the band had deteriorated under Love&#x27;s leadership to become &quot;a pointless parody of themselves&quot; by &quot;writing bad new songs [and] recording bad covers of old songs&quot;.

== Legacy ==
While the album&#x27;s title track is the only song from the album that has remained a concert staple of the band, &quot;Under the Boardwalk&quot; and the new version of &quot;Surfin&#x27;&quot; have also been performed, and &quot;Summer of Love&quot; and &quot;Strange Things Happen&quot; were each played on one occasion in the 1990s. For two decades, &quot;Summer in Paradise&quot; was the Beach Boys&#x27; last album of predominately original material. An interim album, &quot;Stars and Stripes Vol. 1&quot;, was a compilation of Beach Boys classics performed by country music stars, released in 1996. It featured all the surviving original Beach Boys and was Carl Wilson&#x27;s last album with the band before his passing in 1998. In June 2012, the album &quot;That&#x27;s Why God Made the Radio&quot; was released, featuring all-new material from the surviving members.

<text>Petro Grigorenko or Petro Hryhorovych Hryhorenko (, – 21 February 1987) was a high-ranking Soviet Army commander of Ukrainian descent, who in his fifties became a dissident 
and a writer, one of the founders of the human rights movement in the Soviet Union.

For 16 years, he was a professor of cybernetics at the Frunze Military Academy and chairman of its cybernetic section before joining the ranks of the early dissidents. In the mid-1970s Grigorenko helped to found the Moscow Helsinki Group and the Ukrainian Helsinki Group, before leaving the USSR for medical treatment in the United States. The Soviet government barred his return, and he never again returned to the Soviet Union. In the words of Joseph Alsop, Grigorenko publicly denounced the &quot;totalitarianism that hides behind the mask of so-called Soviet democracy.&quot;

==Early life==
Petro Grigorenko was born in Borysivka village in Taurida Governorate, Russian Empire (in present-day
Zaporizhzhia Oblast, Ukraine).

In 1939, he graduated with honors from the Kuybyshev Military Engineering Academy and the Military Academy of the General Staff of the Armed Forces of Russia. He took part in the battles of Khalkhin Gol, against the Japanese on the Manchurian border in 1939, and in the Second World War. He commanded troops in initial battles following 22 June 1941. During the war, he also commanded an infantry division in the Baltic for three years.

He went on a military career and reached high ranks during World War II. After the war, being a decorated veteran, he left active career and taught at the Frunze Military Academy, reaching the rank of a Major General.

In 1949, Grigorenko defended his Ph.D. thesis on the theme &quot;Features of the organization and conduct of combined offensive battle in the mountains.&quot;

In 1960, he completed work on his doctoral thesis. Over 70 of his scientific works on military science were published.

==Dissident activities==
In 1961, Petro Grigorenko started to openly criticize what he considered the excesses of the Khrushchev regime. He maintained that the special privileges of the political elite did not comply with the principles laid down by Lenin. Grigorenko formed a dissident group—The Group for the Struggle to Revive Leninism. Soviet psychiatrists sitting as legally constituted commissions to inquire into his sanity diagnosed him at least three times—in April 1964, August 1969, and November 1969. When arrested, Grigorenko was sent to Moscow&#x27;s Lubyanka prison, and from there for psychiatric examination to the Serbsky Institute where the first commission, which included Snezhnevsky and Lunts, diagnosed him as suffering from the mental disease in the form of a paranoid delusional development of his personality, accompanied by early signs of cerebral arteriosclerosis. Lunts, reporting later on this diagnosis, mentioned that the symptoms of paranoid development were &quot;an overestimation of his own personality reaching messianic proportions&quot; and &quot;reformist ideas.&quot; Grigorenko was not responsible for his actions and was thereby forcibly committed to a special psychiatric hospital. While there, the government deprived him of his pension despite the fact that, by law, a mentally sick military officer was entitled to a pension. After six months, Grigorenko was found to be in remission and was released for outpatient follow-up. He required that his pension be restored. Although he began to draw pension again, it was severely reduced.

Grigorenko took part in the defense of Andrei Sinyavsky and Yuli Daniel and sharply protested against the arrests of young writers Alexander Ginzburg, Yuri Galanskov, Alexey Dobrovolsky, and others. During the closed political trials of 1965–1969, he was often present at the courthouses, demanding to open the doors of the courtrooms for everyone, explained to the people gathered around the goals of the defendants, expressed his dissatisfaction with the distortions in the internal political life of the country, a demanded a return to &quot;true Leninism&quot;.

He became much more active in his dissidence, stirred other people to protest some of the State&#x27;s actions and received several warnings from the KGB. In 1968, after Grigorenko protested the Soviet invasion of Czechoslovakia, he was expelled from the Communist Party of the Soviet Union, arrested and ultimately committed to a mental hospital until being freed on 26 June 1974 after 5 years of detention. As Grigorenko had followers in Moscow, he was lured to the far-away Tashkent. While there, he was again arrested and examined by a psychiatric team. None of the manifestations or symptoms cited by the Lunts commission were found there by the second examination conducted under the chairmanship of Fyodor Detengof. The diagnosis and evaluation made by the commission was that &quot;Grigorenko&#x27;s [criminal] activity had a purposeful character, it was related to concrete events and facts... It did not reveal any signs of illness or delusions.&quot; The psychiatrists reported that he was not mentally sick, but responsible for his actions. He had firm convictions which were shared by many of his colleagues and were not delusional. Having evaluated the records of his preceding hospitalization, they concluded that he had not been sick at that time either. The KGB brought Grigorenko back to Moscow and, three months later, arranged a second examination at the Serbsky Institute. Once again, these psychiatrists found that he had &quot;a paranoid development of the personality&quot; manifested by reformist ideas. The commission, which included Lunts and was chaired by Morozov, recommended that he be recommitted to a special psychiatric hospital for the socially dangerous. Eventually, after almost four years, he was transferred to a regular mental hospital. On 17 January 1971 Grigorenko was asked whether he had changed his convictions and replied that &quot;Convictions are not like gloves, one cannot easily change them&quot;.

In 1971, Dr. Semen Hluzman wrote an in-absentia psychiatric report on Grigorenko. Hluzman came to the conclusion that Grigorenko was mentally sane and had been taken to mental hospitals for political reasons. In the late 1970s and early 1980s, Hluzman was forced to serve seven years in labor camp for defending Grigorenko against the charge of insanity. Amnesty International declared Grigorenko a prisoner of conscience.

Grigorenko became the key defender of Crimean Tatars deported to Soviet Central Asia. He advised the Tatar activists not to confine their protests to the USSR, but to appeal also to international organizations including the United Nations.

Grigorenko was one of the first who questioned the official Soviet version of World War II history. He pointed out that just prior to the German attack on June 22, 1941, vast Soviet troops were concentrated in the area west of Białystok, deep in occupied Poland, getting ready for a surprise offensive, which made them vulnerable to be encircled in case of surprise German attack. His ideas were later advanced by Viktor Suvorov.

After publishing Abdurakhman Avtorkhanov&#x27;s book &quot;Stalin and the Soviet Communist Party: A Study in the Technology of Power&quot;, Grigorenko made and distributed its copies by photographing and typewriting. In 1976, Grigorenko helped found the Moscow Helsinki Group and the Ukrainian Helsinki Group.

==In the United States==
On 20 December 1977, Grigorenko was allowed to go abroad for medical treatment. His health was ruined during forcible confinement in KGB-run mental hospitals. On 30 November 1977, Grigorenko arrived in the United States and was stripped of his Soviet citizenship. In Grigorenko&#x27;s words, Leonid Brezhnev signed the decree of depriving Grigorenko of Soviet citizenship on the ground that he was undermining the prestige of the Soviet Union. The 1970s marked a peak in the use of external exile as a punitive measure by the Soviet Union (as opposed to the internal type, which was highest between the mid-1930s and early 1950s); often the pattern was that a trip abroad for work or medical treatment was transformed into permanent exile. In the same year, Grigorenko became a U.S. citizen.
Being in USA since 1977, Grigorenko took an active part in the activities of the Ukrainian Helsinki Group foreign affiliate. On 23 July 1978, Grigorenko made a statement condemning the trials of Soviet dissidents Anatoliy Shcharanskyi, Alexander Ginzburg and Viktoras Petkus.

In 1979 in New York, Grigorenko was examined by the team of psychologists and psychiatrists including Alan A. Stone, the then President of American Psychiatric Association. The team could find no evidence of mental disease in Grigorenko and his history consistent with mental disease in the past. Their findings were drawn up and publicized by Walter Reich. Grigorenko&#x27;s case confirmed accusations, Stone wrote, that psychiatry in the Soviet Union was at times a tool of political repression.

Petro Grigorenko described his life and views, and his assessment by Soviet psychiatrists and periods of incarceration in prison hospitals in his 1981 memoirs &quot;V Podpolye Mozhno Vstretit Tolko Krys…&quot; (&quot;In the Underground One Can Meet Only Rats…&quot;). In 1982, the book was translated into English by Thomas P. Whitney under the title &quot;Memoirs&quot; and reviewed by Alexander J. Motyl, Raymond L. Garthoff, John C. Campbell, Adam Ulam, Raisa Orlova and Lev Kopelev.

In 1983, he said he considered the American political-economic system to be &quot;the best that mankind has found to date.&quot; In 1983, a stroke he suffered left him partially paralyzed. Grigorenko died on 21 February 1987 in New York City.

In 1991, a commission, composed of psychiatrists from all over the Soviet Union and led by Modest Kabanov, then director of the Bekhterev Psychoneurological Institute in St Petersburg, spent six months reviewing Grigorenko&#x27;s patient files. They drew up 29 thick volumes of legal proceedings, and in October 1991 reversed the official Soviet diagnosis of Grigorenko&#x27;s psychiatric condition. In 1992, an official post-mortem forensic psychiatric commission of experts met in Ukraine. They removed the stigma of being a mental patient and confirmed that there were no grounds for the debilitating treatment he underwent in high security psychiatric hospitals for many years. The 1992 psychiatric examination of Grigorenko was described by the &quot;Nezavisimiy Psikhiatricheskiy Zhurnal&quot; in its numbers 1–4 of 1992.

==Family==

Petro Grigorenko was married to Zinaida Mikhailovna Grigorenko and they had five sons: Anatoliy, Heorhiy, Oleh, Viktor and Andrew. Two of them died as children.

In 1975, Andrew, an electrical engineer, was declared to have inherited his father&#x27;s insanity. He was expelled from the USSR to the US, two years before Petro and Zinaida Hryhorenko themselves travelled to the United States. Andrew was repeatedly told that since his father was mentally ill, then he was also mad. If he did not stop speaking out in defense of human rights and his father, they told him, he would also be sent to the psikhushka. Subsequently, Andrew Grigorenko became the founder and president of General Petro Grigorenko Foundation, dedicated to the study of his father&#x27;s legacy.

==Name spelling versions==
The different Latin spellings of Grigorenko&#x27;s name exist due to the lack of uniform transliteration rules for the Ukrainian names in the middle of the 20th century, when he became internationally known. The correct modern transliteration would be &quot;Petro Hryhorenko&quot;. However, according to the American identification documents of the late general the official spelling of his name was established as &quot;Petro Grigorenko&quot;. The same spelling is engraved on his gravestone at the Ukrainian Orthodox Church of St. Andrew in South Bound Brook, New Jersey, USA. The same spelling is also retained by his surviving American descendants: son Andrew and granddaughters Tetiana and Olga.

==Honours and awards==

<text>Herbert Kawainui Kāne (June 21, 1928 – March 8, 2011) was an American artist and historian of Hawaiian ancestry. He is considered a significant figure in the renaissance of Hawaiian culture of the 1970s. His work focused on the seafaring traditions of the ancestral peoples of Hawaii.

Kāne contributed to the understanding that Hawaiian culture arose not by accidental seeding of Polynesia, but that Hawaii was reachable by voyaging canoes from Tahiti that were able to make the journey and return. This suggested a more complex concept of the cultures of the Pacific Islands than had previously been accepted. He created imagery of Hawaiian culture prior to contact with Europeans, and especially the period of early European influence, that inspired appreciation of traditional life. He painted views of war, such as The Battle of Nuʻuanu, the potential of conflicts between cultures such as in &quot;Cook Entering Kealakekua Bay&quot;, where British ships were dwarfed and surrounded by Hawaiian canoes, as well as quotidian scenes and images of ceremonial and spiritual life, that helped arouse pride among Hawaiians during a time of cultural awakening.

==Early life and education as an artist==
Kāne was born in Marshfield, Minnesota. His father, also named Herbert, worked in the family poi business, became a paniolo (Hawaiian cowboy), and later traveled across the United States with a Hawaiian band. He also served in the Army and Navy and eventually worked as an optometrist. Kāne’s grandfather immigrated to Waipio Valley from China and built the first poi factory in the Hawaiian Islands, where he cultivated taro and produced poi for the market. Kāne’s mother’s family were farmers of Danish ancestry in Wisconsin. Kāne&#x27;s childhood was divided between Wisconsin and Hawaiʻi.

In his book, &quot;Voyagers&quot;, Kāne describes his early awakening to art. In 1935, as a child in Hilo, Hawaii, his mother took him to an art gallery, which was exhibiting the work of D. Howard Hitchcock. Kāne wrote that he was &quot;stunned, confronted with miracles&quot; upon seeing Hitchcock&#x27;s work and had a brief conversation with him.  Hitchcock, the first Hawaiian-born artist to achieve international recognition, focused on Hawaiian subject matter, especially the volcanic eruptions near Hilo. According to Kāne, in addition to this early exposure to art and his parents&#x27; encouragement of his interest in drawing, his most formative experiences in childhood were in Hawaiʻi, where his father and family passed down the traditional folk tales of the islands.

Kāne later served in the United States Navy, qualifying for veterans&#x27; educational benefits under the G.I. Bill. After his discharge, he used these benefits to attend the School of the Art Institute of Chicago, where he earned a Bachelor&#x27;s Degree and, in 1953, a Master&#x27;s degree. Under an arrangement between the two schools at that time, his master’s degree was awarded by the University of Chicago.

==Early career==

Herb Kāne had his own advertising studio on Chicago&#x27;s Michigan Avenue, also known as &quot;The Magnificent Mile.&quot; As a designer, illustrator, and author, he created advertisements for books, magazines, and television. However, Kāne found advertising work unsatisfying, noting that he grew tired of drawing the Jolly Green Giant, even after winning a campaign featuring the character.

Kāne had been sailing a racing catamaran on Lake Michigan when he began researching Hawaiian canoes at the University of Chicago library and the Field Museum of Natural History. In 1961, the Field Museum installed one of the most extensive collections of Pacific Ocean artifacts on public display at the time. 

In the 1960s, Kāne created a series of fourteen paintings depicting Polynesian canoes. In 1969, these paintings were purchased by the Hawaii State Foundation on Culture and the Arts, which was then headed by its first director, Alfred Preis, the architect of the USS Arizona Memorial in Pearl Harbor, Oahu, Hawaii. Kāne later stated that this purchase enabled him to move to Hawaii, where he lived in Honolulu and continued his study of Polynesian voyaging canoes.

== The &quot;Hōkūleʻa&quot; and its cultural impact ==

In Honolulu, Kāne attracted a group of sailing enthusiasts, including University of Hawaii anthropologist Ben Finney and Tommy Holmes, author of &quot;The Hawaiian Canoe&quot;. Together they founded the Polynesian Voyaging Society and began work on the &quot;Hōkūleʻa&quot;, a voyaging canoe based on historical Polynesian design, capable of sailing between Hawaii and Tahiti. Their purpose was to demonstrate that ancestral Polynesian voyagers could have purposely navigated in vessels of similar type to settle Hawaii. Kāne said his goal was also to spur a revival of cultural identity among Hawaiians and peoples of the Pacific islands. He wrote that in 1973 he, with a number of others at the time, realized that &quot;if a voyaging canoe were built and sailed today, it would function as a cultural catalyst and inspire the revival of almost-forgotten aspects of Hawaiian life.&quot; 

&quot;What intrigued me was to see, if by building this canoe and putting it to active use and taking it out on a cruise throughout the Hawaiian islands, introducing it to the Hawaiian people, training Hawaiians to sail it, if this would not stimulate shock waves or ripple effect throughout the culture- in music and dance and the crafts. And we know it did.&quot;
Kāne designed and named the &quot;Hōkūleʻa&quot;, which was launched on March 8, 1975. Technically, the craft was a full-scale replica of a &quot;waa kaulua,&quot; a Polynesian double-hulled voyaging canoe. The name &quot;Hōkūleʻa&quot; came to Kāne in a dream, he said. It is the Hawaiian term for the star Arcturus, which is important to celestial navigation in the Pacific, and the zenith star of the Hawaiian Islands. He served as the skipper for two years as the canoe sailed trial cruises among the Hawaiian Islands to attract crew and support for its maiden international voyage.

Kāne&#x27;s role in the creation and promotion of the &quot;Hōkūleʻa&quot; helped restore pride to the peoples of the Pacific, and his paintings of traditional Hawaiian scenes and historical events have contributed to restoring lost identity. Tony Jones, the President of the School of the Art Institute of Chicago, stated that Kāne &quot;rewritten the history of the Pacific.&quot; Nainoa Thompson, navigator of the &quot;Hōkūleʻa&quot;, said Kāne was &quot;the visionary, the dreamer, and he was the architect and the engineer. He&#x27;s the one that carried the burden of building, constructing, and sailing Hōkūleʻa.&quot; Thompson also stated that Kāne&#x27;s legacy is &quot;transforming Hawaii&#x27;s society because he brought pride and culture and inspiration back, through the canoe...He is the father of the Hawaiian Renaissance.&quot;

Kāne died on March 8, 2011, the 36th anniversary of the launch of the &quot;Hōkūleʻa&quot;.

==Art works==
 Daniel Inouye, United States Senator from Hawaii, stated that Kāne&#x27;s artwork &quot;captured both ancient and modern-day Hawaii and helped preserve Hawaii&#x27;s unique culture for future generations.&quot; Kāne became one of the most respected figurative painters in Hawaii, with major works on view at the Bishop Museum, the largest museum in the state and the premier natural and cultural history institution in the Pacific. His work has been exhibited at Hawaii Volcanoes National Park, Puukoholā Heiau National Historic Site, and in the Hawaii State Capitol. His paintings of Polynesian sailing have been widely reproduced, appearing as illustrations in books and articles. Among the first of these was a series of seven paintings commissioned by &quot;National Geographic Magazine&quot; and published in the December 1974 issue.

His art is characterized by realistic and precise draftsmanship when depicting historical scenes, such as his series of voyaging canoe paintings and many other paintings of battles, everyday domestic life, and ceremonial occasions, which are extensively researched. When Kāne turned his imagination to the legends of old Hawai I and the spiritual and mythological side of the Hawaiian culture, his work was more expressionistic, with bold brushwork and vivid colors. His expressionistic style is seen in his painting &quot;Pele, Goddess of the Volcano&quot; for the Jaggar Museum at Kīlauea, which depicts the supernatural figure with fire in her eyes and flowing lava as her hair.

Kāne&#x27;s art was often heavily researched to ensure historical accuracy, including details such as weather and cloud coverage. He consulted with contacts in Washington, DC, and around the globe to achieve accuracy in his research, resulting in works based on research rather than imagination. Kāne also uncovered ship plans in the Maritime Museum in London, which he used for some of his paintings. He designed tapestries that reflected the beauty of his paintings.

===Site-specific works===
Kāne&#x27;s paintings include several large canvasses or murals for hotel lobbies and similar public and commercial spaces. His 1973 mural, made of wool, titled &quot;Opening of the Pacific to Man&quot;, was designed for a space above the entrance to the Pacific Trade Center, on Alakea and King Streets in central Honolulu. It measures high and wide, and depicts voyaging canoes and a central male figure holding a paddle. In the corner of the mural is a representation of the wayfarer&#x27;s chart, traditionally made of shells and sticks, in which islands and ocean swell patterns are encoded to assist the training of a navigator. As a design consultant, Kāne worked on resorts and visitor centers in Hawaii and the South Pacific, as well as a cultural center in Fiji. Kāne was commissioned by the National Park Service in 1976 to paint &quot;Keoua&#x27;s Arrival&quot;, which is on permanent display in the Visitor Center at Puukoholā Heiau National Historic Site. Several of his large canvasses are on permanent view at the Outrigger Hotel in Waikiki in Honolulu, where the management dedicated the area as a permanent tribute to Kāne.

One 1973 site-specific mural, painted on a custom-designed wall as part of a history center under construction (and never completed) at Punaluu Beach, gained notoriety twice. The historical mural, titled &quot;Ancient Punaluu, Hawaii Island&quot; measured wide by high. According to a news report, &quot;The mural shows alii, warriors and commoners on the black sandbar, which separates Punaluu Bay from a pond where springs provide fresh water immediately behind the beach...A ceiling of thatch gave the feeling of being inside an old Hawaiian shelter and the thatch hid lighting, which gave a natural, daylight look to the mural. Pebbles and sand at the base of the painting met real pebbles and sand on the floor of the history center.&quot; In 1975 the mural survived a tsunami that destroyed the interior of the building. According to Kāne&#x27;s account on his personal blog, quoting eyewitnesses, the wave pushed all the displays out the far side of the room and left a mud line three or four feet high on the wall—except on the mural, which was dry and undamaged. Then in 2005 the mural was stolen from the site, which was vacant and unfinished. Thieves are believed to have cut out the wall in five sections using a circular saw powered by a portable generator, and in this way stole the painting, which has never been recovered. Kāne responded by recreating a version of the mural in oil paint on canvas, saying, &quot;Now all the thieves have is a preliminary sketch. Vengeance is mine.&quot;

===Stamps===

Kāne designed seven postage stamps for the U.S. Postal Service including stamps commemorating each of the 25th and the 50th anniversaries of Hawaiian statehood. His 1984 stamp for the 25th anniversary of Hawaiian statehood depicts a double-hulled voyaging canoe, a Pacific golden plover (a migratory bird which winters in Hawaii), and a volcano erupting on the flank of Mauna Loa, on the Big Island of Hawaii. On the day of its release, sales of this stamp set a new record for the U.S. Postal Service. His 2009 stamp for the State&#x27;s 50th anniversary depicts a person surfing and people paddling a traditional outrigger canoe, all riding the same wave. This stamp engendered some controversy, as Kāne was critical of the typography in the final design, which he felt mistakenly substituted an apostrophe for the symbol that signals a glottal stop in the word Hawaii and is known by the term &quot;okina.&quot; He also designed postage stamps for several Pacific island nations, including French Polynesia, the Federated States of Micronesia, as well as the Republic of the Marshall Islands.

===Three-dimensional art===
Although best known for his paintings, Kāne also produced a limited-edition bronze sculpture and other three-dimensional works besides the Hōkūleʻa. His monumental bronze figure, &quot;The Young Kamehameha&quot; stands in Wailea, Maui.

===Last commission===

Kāne&#x27;s last commissioned work was for the Royal Hawaiian Hotel, a wall-sized painting of Kamehameha I&#x27;s landing in Oahu. He died before the work could be completed; however, he had left instructions that, should he die before the work was finished, Brook Kapūkuniahi Parker should complete the work. Eventually, the hotel decided to display the work unfinished.

<text>Earthbag construction is an inexpensive building method using mostly local soil to create structures which are both strong and can be quickly built.

==Earthbag development==

===Features===
It is a natural building technique developed from historic military bunker construction techniques and temporary flood-control dike building methods. The technique requires very basic construction materials: sturdy sacks filled with organic material usually available on site.

Standard earthbag fill material has internal stability. Either moist subsoil that contains enough clay to become cohesive when tamped, or a water-resistant angular gravel or crushed volcanic rock is used. Walls are gradually built up by laying the bags in courses—forming a staggered pattern similar to bricklaying.

The walls can be curved or straight, domed with earth or topped with conventional roofs. Curved walls provide good lateral stability, forming round rooms and/or domed ceilings like an igloo.

Buildings with straight walls longer than in length need intersecting walls or bracing buttresses. International standards exist for bracing wall size and spacing for earthen construction in different types of seismic risk areas, most notably the performance-based standards of New Zealand recommended by the ASTM International&#x27;s earth building standards. Static shear testing shows that earthbag can reach similar strengths to New Zealand&#x27;s reinforced adobe standards with specific soil strengths and reinforcement although unreinforced weak soil earthbag can have lower shear strength than unreinforced adobe. 
To improve friction between bags and wall tensile strength barbed wire is usually placed between courses. Twine is also sometimes wrapped around the bags to tie one course to the next, to hold in-progress structures together and keep courses well-seated on barbed wire prongs. Rebar can be hammered into walls to strengthen corners and opening edges and provide resistance against overturning.

The structure is typically finished with plaster, either cement stucco on a strong mesh layer or an adobe or lime plaster, to shed water and prevent fabric UV damage. Finishes can differ from protected interior applications to exposed external applications. 

This construction technique is one of the most versatile natural building methods and can be used for benches, freestanding walls, emergency shelters, temporary or permanent housing, or barns and commercial buildings. Earthbag is frequently chosen for many small-to-medium-sized institutional structures in the developing world. Subgrade structures including underground and bermed dwellings (such as Earthships), cisterns, spring boxes, root cellars, and retaining walls can be built with stabilized soil fill or with additional reinforcement and water-resistant gravel or sand fill.

===Writers=== 
Although Joseph Kennedy probably invented the term earthbag (as well as contained earth), Paulina Wojciechowska wrote the first book on the topic of earthbag building in 2001, &quot;Building with Earth: A Guide to Flexible-Form Earthbag Construction&quot;. Kelly Hart developed a massive online database of earthbag information that encouraged idea sharing. Kaki Hunter and Doni Kiffmeyer worked on a variety of projects after studying with Khalili, calling earthbag &quot;flexible form rammed earth&quot;. Their 2004 book, &quot;Earthbag Building: the Tools, Tricks and Techniques&quot;, is available as an e-book.

Free online booklets have been developed by different authors, including Owen Geiger and Patti Stouter. These include structural research and field testing techniques developed for rural areas.

A 2011 e-book by Geiger, &quot;Earthbag Building Guide: Vertical Walls Step-by-Step&quot;, provides photo illustrations of the process and discussions of new techniques for low-risk areas.

=== Proponents ===
Many like Akio Inoue, from Tenri University in Japan and Scott Howard of Earthen Hand have tested and built buildings. Hart, with Geiger, encouraged earthbag&#x27;s development into different culturally and climatically-appropriate shapes. Robert Shear built an earthship inspired earthbag house in Utah and Morgan Caraway of Sustainable Life School is building a house that incorporates earthship design principles as well.

While Gernot Minke, the German professor of earthen architecture, first developed a technique of using bags filled with pumice to build walls, architect and builder Nader Khalili helped reintroduce earthbag construction as a modern technique called superadobe for humanitarian efforts (particularly for residential buildings) as well as natural flood control.

Dr. John Anderton of South Africa has tested a triple channel bag version that reduces the slumping problems inherent in non-cohesive fill material like sand, and pioneered work in a narrow wall contained sand system which he calls E-khaya.

Fernando Pacheco of Brazil pioneered the use of lighter HDPE mesh tubing for simpler hyperadobe walls.

Rebuilding after natural disasters and in low-income regions around the world has included earthbag. Although heavy earthen walls are usually dangerous in quakes, Nepal&#x27;s spring 2015 earthquakes left earthbag buildings in good condition near destroyed buildings.

Engineer Nabil Taha developed the first general specifications for one type of exterior pinning reinforcement appropriate for the highest seismic risk zones. Several engineering students have tested uncured or low strength earthbag, and Build Simple has tested cured cohesive walls. Organizations building in Nepal are currently working with engineers to improve and refine reinforcement options for seismic-resistant earthbag.

==Construction method==
Construction usually begins by digging a trench to undisturbed mineral subsoil, which is partially filled with stones and/or gravel to create a rubble trench foundation. In high seismic risk regions a reinforced concrete footing or grade beam may be recommended. Earthbag buildings can also be built on conventional concrete slabs (though this is more expensive and uses more embodied energy than a rubble trench foundation) and can have a bermed or underground &quot;floating&quot; foundation like an earthship as well.

Several courses of gravel in doubled woven bags form a water-resistant foundation. Each layer usually has two strands of barbed wire on top, that attaches to the bag to prevent slippage and resists any tendency for the outward expansion of dome or rectangular walls.

Bags on the course above are offset by —half of the wall width—similar to running bond in masonry. Bags can either be pre-filled with material and hoisted up, or bags or tubes are filled in place. The weight of the earthen fill locks the bag in place on the barbed wire below. A light tamping of the bags or tubes consolidates the moist clay-containing fill and creates interlocking bags or tubes anchored on the barbed wire.

===Container types===
Solid-weave polypropylene is most popular, available around the world to transport rice or other grains. Polypropylene is low cost and resists water damage, rot, and insects. Tubes are often available from manufacturers who sew them into bags. Mesh tubes of soft crocheted poly fibers are also used, although stiff extruded mesh or woven mesh bags can also be used.

Organic/natural materials such as hemp, burlap (like &quot;gunny sacks&quot;) can be used. Since these may rot, they should only be used with cohesive fills (containing a significant proportion of clay) that form solid masses when tamped.

===Terminology===

Earthbag is now a varied family of techniques. Each type of fill and container has different strength and reinforcement requirements.

For hazardous locations, accurate terminology is needed. Contained earth (CE) is based on the original technique, but with specific soil strengths and reinforcement chosen for hazard levels. CE uses damp, cohesive, tamped bag fill, which bonds strongly with barbed wire and other reinforcement as the wall cures.

CE is not &quot;sandbags&quot;. Contained sand (CS) uses sand fill or any fill too dry or with poor cohesion that performs structurally like sandbags. CS must be built with solid-weave fabric bags and have good protection from fabric damage, relying on the strength of the bag fabric for wall strength. CS needs more vertical reinforcement for both shear and out-of-plane strength than CE, or may require a structural skin. Some builders use narrow bags of contained sand as wall infill.

Contained gravel (CG) uses fill of any aggregate larger than coarse sand, usually in doubled rice bags, although strong mesh can be used. CG limits dampness transmission from footings.

Modular CE is built in grain bags or similar tubes. Walls rely on attachment between barbed wire barbs and/ or added pins between courses. Solid CE is hyperadobe built in some type of knit raschel mesh tube, so that the damp earthen fill solidifies between courses.

===Bag-fill materials===
Generally inorganic material is used as filler, but some organic material (such as rice hulls) can be used if a strong matrix like wire mesh reinforces the plaster.

Earthen fill may contain 5–50% clay, and can be &quot;reject fines&quot;, &quot;road base&quot;, &quot;engineered fill&quot;, or local subsoil. &quot;Raw&quot; or un-stabilized soils cure as solid units but cannot withstand prolonged soaking. Subsoils with clay mold tightly and attach well to barbed wire prongs and rebar.

Soil fill can contain a high proportion of aggregate, as long as it tamps and cures strongly. Crushed bottles, strong rubble, or plastic trash can be used, but high aggregate mixes may interfere with inserting rebar.

Sands, stone dust and gravels can survive prolonged flood conditions, but most require special bracing during construction as well as some form of structural skin. Sand fill may be appropriate for several courses to provide a vibration damping building base, but becomes unstable in ordinary bags above in height.

Cement, lime or bitumen stabilization can allow clay soil to withstand flooding or allow sands to be used in traditional bags with a non-structural plaster skin. Because earthbag walls are usually thick a large amount of stabilizer is needed.
Thermal insulating properties are important for climates that experience temperature extremes. The thermal insulating value of a material is directly related to both the porosity of the material and the thickness of the wall. Crushed volcanic rock, pumice or rice hulls yield higher insulation value than clay or sand. Untreated organic materials that could decay should not be used as part of a structural wall, although they can be used as infill.

United Earth Builders has tried a light straw clay in the hyperadobe mesh tubing to form a layer 200 mm (8&quot;) thick outside of a dome.
Thermal mass properties of earthen fill moderate temperature swings in climates that experience high temperature fluctuations from night to day. This thermal flywheel effect makes massive earth walls ideal for mild or hot and dry climates. Clay or sand also have excellent heat retention characteristics and, when properly insulated from the home&#x27;s exterior, can serve as thermal mass in a passive solar building design in cool climates, keeping interior temperatures stable year-round.

===Reinforcement and structural performance===
Solid CE may be built with less barbed wire in low-risk areas because walls solidify between courses. Earthbag using woven bags or tubes need barbed wire for any level of natural hazard since the bag-to-bag surfaces are slippery. Pins between courses do not contribute important linear out-of-plane strength. Walls of earthbag with barbed wire are more flexible than adobe and may resist collapse when carefully detailed.

Earthbag of weak soil with no steel can be half the shear strength of unreinforced adobe, which is easily damaged in earthquakes. New Zealand&#x27;s code detailing and plans allow unreinforced adobe walls to survive almost 0.6 g forces (comparable to Ss values for 2% probability of excedance in 50 years), but earthbag needs stronger soil to match this strength. Earthbag in Nepal surpassed this strength slightly by resisting forces above 0.7 g in early 2015. Domes tested in California resisted approximately 1 g forces, due to the stable shape of these less than diameter buildings.

Current earthbag techniques of inserting rebar unattached to base and overlapping without connection may only resist 1.2 g or less, even if using very strong soil. Special reinforcement is needed

Solid CE of strong soil has higher shear and out of plane strength than modular CE. It may also allow the use of mesh for horizontal reinforcement in addition to or in place of barbed wire.

Contained gravel or contained sand may perform best with wire wrapped around the sides of straight wall sections, alternating with the next course having barbed wire gift-wrapped under and over the same straight sections. Base walls of CG in high risk regions may need additional buttresses at the foundation level where builders cannot afford a reinforced concrete (RC) grade beam or footing. A narrower plastic mesh tube often used for erosion control wattle could be filled with gravel to allow a half-width RC ring beam under the wide walls.

===Forming the house===
A roof can be formed by gradually sloping the walls inward to construct a dome. Vaulted roofs can be built on forms. Or a bond beam is used under a traditional roof type. Hip roofs, gable-type trusses or vigas may be needed to reduce outward stress on earthen walls.

Earth domes are inexpensive to build, but waterproofing them is complex or expensive in humid regions.
Windows and doors can be formed with a traditional masonry lintel or with corbeling or brick-arch techniques, on temporary forms. Light may also be brought in by skylights, glass-capped pipes, or bottles placed between bag courses during construction.

===Finishing===
Cover the wall to prevent damage to the bags from UV rays or moisture with cement-based stucco, or lime or earthen plaster. If walls are &#x27;raw&#x27; earth, an infill plaster of earth with straw is used to fill the nooks between bags or courses. A finish plaster is applied on top.

Roof overhangs are helpful to reduce plaster waterproofing requirements, although plaster on lower walls may be stronger and more water-resistant than plaster on upper walls.

Some buildings use a planted-earth &quot;living roof&quot; (&quot;green-roof&quot;) to top the structure, while others use a more conventional framing and roof placed atop earth-bag walls.

==Environmental friendliness==
Earthbag construction uses very little energy compared to other durable construction methods. Unlike concrete, brick or wood, no energy is needed to produce the earthen fill other than gathering soil. If on-site soil is used, little energy is needed for transportation. Unlike rammed earth construction, only human labor energy is required to tamp the soil lightly. The energy-intensive materials that used – plastic (for bags &amp; twine), steel wire, and perhaps the outer shell of plaster or stucco – are used in relatively small quantities compared to other types of construction, often totaling less than 5% of the building materials. Buildings last a long time when maintained. However, if &quot;raw&quot; or unstabilized soil is used as fill, when the building is no longer useful the earthen fill can be recycled into either garden areas, backfill, or new earthen buildings.

==Use in disaster areas==
Earthbag building techniques were also explored in Sri Lanka after the 2004 tsunami. Multiple earthbag construction projects have been completed in Haiti, most of these after the earthquake. First Steps Himalaya and other charities had built more than 50 earthbag buildings in Nepal prior to the April 2015 earthquake. Since then, local builders flocked to ongoing earthbag training opportunities, including those by Good Earth Global, which have led to official Nepal building code acceptance of this technique for residences. International NPOs have built hundreds of contained earth or earthbag buildings in Nepal as well, more residences than larger clinics or schools. NPOs are asking for more structural information to be better able to choose reinforcement types and intensity appropriate to local soil strength and seismic risk. University testing has begun but more is needed.

==Colonization of the Moon and Mars==
Khalili proposed using the techniques of earthbag construction for building structures on the Moon or other planets. Currently, it is quite expensive to lift a positive-mass payload from Earth. Thus, Khalili&#x27;s techniques would seem to be an ideal solution as the requisite supplies would consist of lightweight bags and a few tools to fill them. He specified that such bags would probably have pre-sewn &quot;hook and loop&quot; (i.e. Velcro) fastener strips in lieu of barbed wire.

<text>Tweed Heads is a coastal city at the mouth of the Tweed River in the Northern Rivers region of the state of New South Wales, Australia. Tweed Heads is the northernmost town in New South Wales, and is located in the Tweed Shire local government area. It is situated north of Sydney and south of Brisbane. The town is next to the border with Queensland and is adjacent to its &quot;twin town&quot; of Coolangatta, which is a suburb of the Gold Coast in Queensland. 

==History==
In 1823 John Oxley was the first European to see the Tweed Valley, and he wrote of it:
&quot;A deep rich valley clothed with magnificent trees, the beautiful uniformity of which was only interrupted by the turns and windings of the river, which here and there appeared like small lakes. The background was Mt. Warning. The view was altogether beautiful beyond description. The scenery here exceeded anything I have previously seen in Australia.&quot;

Timber cutters originally moved to the Tweed Valley in 1844. After the timber had been cleared, farmers moved in with bananas, cane and dairy farming dominating the area, while a fishing industry developed. The first school opened in 1871.

In May 1888, 119 subdivided lots of &quot;Boyd Estate&quot; were advertised to be auctioned by W. H. Brett. A map advertising the auction shows that the estate was located next to the Tweed River.

The Tweed Heads and Coolangatta Surf Life Saving Club opened on 13 September 1911.

In April 1916, 69 allotments of &quot;Charles&#x27; Tweed Heads subdivision were advertised to be auctioned by P. Smith &amp; Son. A map advertising the auction shows the location of the estate in proximity to Terranora Creek.

In November 1917, 46 subdivided allotments of &quot;Marks Estate&quot; were advertised for auction by S. A. Thornton. A map advertising the auction illustrates the location of the estate in proximity to Terranora Creek, Coolangatta and the Pacific Ocean and describes the allotments as perfectly flat, large areas with splendid frontages.

The Tweed Shire, inclusive Murwillumbah was declared in 1947.

Tweed Heads was the location of fictional town Porpoise Spit in the 1994 movie &quot;Muriel&#x27;s Wedding&quot;.

In April 2020, checkpoint barriers were established in Tweed streets near the state border to restrict travel into Queensland during the COVID-19 pandemic.

== City and suburbs ==
The urban boundaries of Tweed Heads extend south along the coastline to Hastings Point, and westward along the Terranora Creek encompassing Bilambil Heights and Terranora. This area includes the suburbs and localities of:

* Banora Point
* Bilambil Heights
* Bogangar
* Cabarita Beach
* Casuarina
* Chinderah
* Fingal Head
* Hastings Point
* Kingscliff
* Terranora
* Tweed Heads
* Tweed Heads South
* Tweed Heads West

== Transport ==

=== Rail ===
Tweed Heads was once connected to the Queensland Railways system, with the South Coast line providing a direct connection to Brisbane. The railway opened on 10 August 1903. It had been hoped that the New South Wales government would extend their railway line from Murwillumbah to Tweed Heads, but this did not occur due to cost of resuming the land and the expenses associated with the tunnel and bridge that would be required. The Tweed Heads railway station was located on the western side of Enid Street between Bay Street and Frances Street (). The railway line to Brisbane closed in 1961, and the site of the station has since been converted to parklands and commercial development.

=== Road ===
The Pacific Motorway bisects the urban area, and has been freeway standard since the completion of the section through Banora Point in 2012. Tweed Heads is also the southern terminus for the Gold Coast Highway, which was extended to Tweed Heads West from its former terminus in Tugun following completion of the bypass in 2007. The main arterial roads, Minjungbal Drive and Wharf Street, are the former alignent of the Pacific Highway.

=== Air ===
Tweed Heads is served by Gold Coast Airport, which straddles the state border and is partly located in Tweed Heads West.

=== Public transport ===
Bus services are mostly provided by Kinetic Group on behalf of Transport for NSW, who serve the urban area as well as neighbouring Murwillumbah. Tweed Heads is also the southern terminus for Translink buses, which provide a connection to the Gold Coast railway line at Varsity Lakes and to the tram at Broadbeach South. Intercity coaches run by Greyhound Australia, NSW TrainLink, and Premier Motor Service also link Tweed Heads with Brisbane, Casino, and Sydney.

==Tourism==
Given its proximity to the Gold Coast, Tweed Heads has a shared economy with Coolangatta based heavily on tourism.

Tweed Heads&#x27; most popular tourist destinations include Mount Warning, one of the largest shield volcanoes in the Southern Hemisphere, and the nearby Nightcap, Border Ranges, Springbrook and Lamington National Parks, which abound with sub-tropical fauna and flora.

===Rugby league===
Tweed Heads was once home to several iterations of professional rugby league clubs in the New South Wales Rugby League (NSWRL) competition between 1988 and 1995. The Gold Coast-Tweed Giants were established in 1988 and based out of the Tweed Heads Seagulls premises in west Tweed Heads. The Seagulls ran a very successful social club that turned large profits due to poker machines and by 1990 the club had acquired the Giants&#x27; NSWRL licence and rebranded the team to become the Gold Coast Seagulls, despite remaining based in Tweed Heads. The team pulled off its biggest coup in 1990 when it signed future Rugby League Immortal Wally Lewis. After years of poor on field results and low attendances, the Seagulls sold their NSWRL licence to businessman Jeff Muller who moved the team to Carrara on the Gold Coast.

The Seagulls returned to the Group 18 Rugby League competition in 1996 and were granted entry into the Queensland Cup in 2003. Australian rules football was brought to the area in 1962 when the Coolangatta Tweed Heads Australian Football Club. It was intended to represent the twin towns of Coolangatta and Tweed Heads and competed in the Gold Coast Australian Football League competition. In 1984 the Northern Rivers region established the Summerland Australian Football League that later included the Tweed Coast Football Club. The league was amalgamated into Queensland Australian Football League as its own division in 2012.

<text>Frederick McCubbin (25 February 1855 – 20 December 1917) was an Australian artist, art teacher and prominent member of the Heidelberg School art movement, also known as Australian impressionism.

Born and raised in Melbourne, Victoria, McCubbin studied at the National Gallery of Victoria Art School under a number of artists, notably Eugene von Guerard and later George Folingsby. One of his former classmates, Tom Roberts, returned from art training in Europe in 1885, and that summer they established the Box Hill artists&#x27; camp, where they were joined by Arthur Streeton and Charles Conder. These artists formed the nucleus of what became known as the Heidelberg School, a &quot;plein air&quot; art movement named after Heidelberg, the site of another one of their camps. During this time, he began teaching at the National Gallery school, and later served as president of both the Victorian Artists&#x27; Society and the Australian Art Association.

Concerned with capturing the national life of Australia, McCubbin produced a number of large landscapes that reflect the melancholic themes then popular in literary accounts of European settlers&#x27; interactions with the bush. Several of these works have become icons of Australian art, including &quot;Down on His Luck&quot; (1889), &quot;On the Wallaby Track&quot; (1896) and &quot;The Pioneer&quot; (1904).

During his first and only trip to Europe in 1907, McCubbin gained first-hand exposure to works by J. M. W. Turner and the French impressionists, accelerating a shift in his art towards freer, more abstracted brushwork and lighter colours. Works from this late period, although not as well known as his earlier national narratives, are considered by many critics to be his strongest artistically. &quot;When he died&quot;, wrote Barry Pearce, &quot;McCubbin was one of the very few Australian painters who found an exalted resolution of vision that progressed with age, so that some of his greatest paintings were made in the last ten years of his life.&quot;

==Early years and background==
McCubbin was born in Melbourne, the third of eight children of baker Alexander McCubbin (from Ayrshire, Scotland) and his English wife Anne, &quot;née&quot; McWilliams. McCubbin was educated at William Willmett&#x27;s West Melbourne Common School and St Paul&#x27;s School, Swanston Street. He later worked for a time as solicitor&#x27;s clerk, a coach painter and in his family&#x27;s bakery business while studying art at the National Gallery of Victoria&#x27;s School of Design, where he met Tom Roberts and studied under Eugene von Guerard. He also studied at the Victorian Academy of the Arts and exhibited there in 1876 and again from 1879 to 1882, selling his first painting in 1880. In this period, after the death of his father, he became responsible for running the family business.

==Career==
By the early 1880s, McCubbin&#x27;s work began to attract considerable attention and won a number of prizes from the National Gallery, including a first prize in 1883 in their annual student exhibition. By the mid-1880s he concentrated more on painting the Australian bush, the works for which he became notable.

In 1883, McCubbin received first prize in the first annual Gallery students&#x27; exhibition, for best studies in colour and drawing. That year, while still a student, he joined the bohemian Buonarotti Club whose members painted &quot;en plein air&quot; at their art camps and exhibited the resulting landscapes for critique at Club meetings. Mead argues that such early experience was formative in his Heidelberg School landscape painting. In 1888, he became instructor and master of the School of Design at the National Gallery. In this position he taught a number of students who themselves became prominent Australian artists, including Charles Conder and Arthur Streeton.

McCubbin was exhibiting and perhaps painting in the studio of his friend Tom Roberts in the Grosvenor Chambers in Collins St by May 1888. His son, Louis, would later have a studio in the same building.

McCubbin married Annie Moriarty in March 1889. They had seven children, of whom their son Louis McCubbin became an artist and director of the Art Gallery of South Australia 1936–1950. A grandson, Charles, also became an artist.

In 1901 McCubbin and his family moved to Mount Macedon, transporting a prefabricated English style home up onto the northern slopes of the mountain which they named &quot;Fontainebleau&quot;. It was in this beautiful setting, in 1904, that he painted &quot;The Pioneer&quot;, amongst many other works, and this is the only place that McCubbin ever painted fairies. The house survived the Ash Wednesday fires and stands today as a monument to the artist. It was at Macedon that he was inspired by the surrounding bush to experiment with the light and its effects on colour in nature.

McCubbin continued to paint through the first two decades of the 20th century, though by the beginning of World War I his health began to fail. He traveled to England in 1907 and visited Tasmania, but aside from these relatively short excursions lived most of his life in Melbourne. There he taught at the National Gallery of Victoria Art School, where his students included painters Clarice Beckett, William Beckwith McInnes, Hugh Ramsay, Jessie Traill and Hilda Rix Nicholas, and the photographer Ruth Hollick.

In 1912 he became the founding member of the Australian Art Association.

McCubbin died in 1917 from a heart attack.

==Legacy==

In 1998 McCubbin&#x27;s painting &quot;Bush Idyll&quot; (1893) sold for $2,312,500, a then-record price for an Australian painting at public auction. Widely considered to be amongst the finest paintings in Australian art history, &quot;Bush Idyll&quot; was on long term display in the National Gallery of Australia, Canberra between 2017 and 2020 and between late 2021 and early 2022 it formed part of the key retrospective, &#x27;Frederick McCubbin - Whisperings in wattle boughs&quot; at the Geelong Gallery, Geelong.

On 25 February 2005, the 150th anniversary of his birth, the premiere of &quot;McCubbin: A Musical Biography of Frederick McCubbin&quot; by Peter Burgess was staged at Federation Square, Melbourne.

On 22 March 2016, McCubbin&#x27;s painting &quot;An Old Politician&quot; (1879), resurfaced from a private vault in an Australian bank. The painting has not been viewed in public exhibition since its sale to a private collector in the 1880s.

In 2021, Geelong Gallery presented a survey of McCubbin&#x27;s works in an exhibition titled Frederick McCubbin—Whisperings in wattle boughs. This exhibition celebrated Geelong&#x27;s first major work to enter the collection in 1900: &quot;A bush burial&quot; (1890). The exhibition showed McCubbin’s key ‘pioneer’ subjects and additional paintings that show his fascination with the colour and nature of the bush.

McCubbin&#x27;s letters to Tom Roberts, from the period 1891-1916, are held in the State Library of New South Wales.

==Works==
&quot;McCubbin creates an engulfing, claustrophobic landscape by barely suggesting any horizon and compressing midground and background. In contrast, the bush folk are portrayed as heroic figures.&quot;

<doc id="841890" wikidata="Q2033300" url="?curid=841890" title="Haldane's dilemma">
<text>Haldane&#x27;s dilemma, also known as the waiting time problem, is a limit on the speed of beneficial evolution, calculated by J. B. S. Haldane in 1957. Before the invention of DNA sequencing technologies, it was not known how much polymorphism DNA harbored, although alloenzymes (variant forms of an enzyme which differ structurally but not functionally from other alloenzymes coded for by different alleles at the same locus) were beginning to make it clear that substantial polymorphism existed. This was puzzling because the amount of polymorphism known to exist seemed to exceed the theoretical limits that Haldane calculated, that is, the limits imposed if polymorphisms present in the population generally influence an organism&#x27;s fitness. Motoo Kimura&#x27;s landmark paper on neutral theory in 1968 built on Haldane&#x27;s work to suggest that most molecular evolution is neutral, resolving the dilemma. Although neutral evolution remains the consensus theory among modern biologists, and thus Kimura&#x27;s resolution of Haldane&#x27;s dilemma is widely regarded as correct, some biologists argue that adaptive evolution explains a large fraction of substitutions in protein coding sequence, and they propose alternative solutions to Haldane&#x27;s dilemma.

== Substitution cost ==

In the introduction to &quot;The Cost of Natural Selection&quot; Haldane writes that it is difficult for breeders to simultaneously select all the desired qualities, partly because the required genes may not be found together in the stock; but, he writes,

especially in slowly breeding animals such as cattle, one cannot cull even half the females, even though only one in a hundred of them combines the various qualities desired.

That is, the problem for the cattle breeder is that keeping only the specimens with the desired qualities will lower the reproductive capability too much to keep a useful breeding stock.

Haldane states that this same problem arises with respect to natural selection. Characters that are positively correlated at one time may be negatively correlated at a later time, so simultaneous optimization of more than one character is a problem also in nature. And, as Haldane writes

[i]n this paper I shall try to make quantitative the fairly obvious statement that natural selection cannot occur with great intensity for a number of characters at once unless they happen to be controlled by the same genes.

In faster breeding species there is less of a problem. Haldane mentions the peppered moth, &quot;Biston betularia&quot;, whose variation in pigmentation is determined by several alleles at a single gene. One of these alleles, &quot;C&quot;, is dominant to all the others, and any CC or Cx moths are dark (where &quot;x&quot; is any other allele). Another allele, &quot;c&quot;, is recessive to all the others, and cc moths are light. Against the originally pale lichens the darker moths were easier for birds to pick out, but in areas, where pollution has darkened the lichens, the cc moths had become rare. Haldane mentions that in a single day the frequency of cc moths might be halved.

Another potential problem is that if &quot;ten other independently inherited characters had been subject to selection of the same intensity as that for colour, only formula_1, or one in 1024, of the original genotype would have survived.&quot; The species would most likely have become extinct; but it might well survive ten other selective periods of comparable selectivity, if they happened in different centuries.

== Selection intensity ==

Haldane proceeds to define the &quot;intensity of selection&quot; regarding &quot;juvenile survival&quot; (that is, survival to reproductive age) as formula_2, where formula_3 is the proportion of those with the optimal genotype (or genotypes) that survive to reproduce, and formula_4 is the proportion of the entire population that similarly so survive. The proportion for the entire population that die without reproducing is thus formula_5, and this would have been formula_6 if all genotypes had survived as well as the optimal. Hence formula_7 is the proportion of &quot;genetic&quot; deaths due to selection. As Haldane mentions, if formula_8, then formula_9.

== The cost ==

Haldane writes

I shall investigate the following case mathematically. A population is in equilibrium under selection and mutation. One or more genes are rare because their appearance by mutation is balanced by natural selection. A sudden change occurs in the environment, for example, pollution by smoke, a change of climate, the introduction of a new food source, predator, or pathogen, and above all migration to a new habitat. It will be shown later that the general conclusions are not affected if the change is slow. The species is less adapted to the new environment, and its reproductive capacity is lowered. It is gradually improved as a result of natural selection. But meanwhile, a number of deaths, or their equivalents in lowered fertility, have occurred. If selection at the formula_10 selected locus is responsible for formula_11 of these deaths in any generation the reproductive capacity of the species will be formula_12 of that of the optimal genotype, or formula_13 nearly, if every formula_11 is small. Thus the intensity of selection approximates to formula_15.

Comparing to the above, we have that formula_16, if we say that formula_17 is the quotient of deaths for the formula_10 selected locus and formula_4 is again the quotient of deaths for the entire population.

The problem statement is therefore that the alleles in question are &quot;not&quot; particularly beneficial under the previous circumstances; but a change in environment favors these genes by natural selection. The individuals without the genes are therefore disfavored, and the favorable genes spread in the population by the death (or lowered fertility) of the individuals without the genes. Note that Haldane&#x27;s model as stated here allows for more than one gene to move towards fixation at a time; but each such will add to the cost of substitution.

The total cost of substitution of the formula_10 gene is the sum formula_21 of all values of formula_11 over all generations of selection; that is, until fixation of the gene. Haldane states that he will show that formula_21 depends mainly on formula_24, the small frequency of the gene in question, as selection begins – that is, at the time that the environmental change occurs (or begins to occur).

== A mathematical model of the cost of diploids ==
Let A and a be two alleles with frequencies formula_25 and formula_26 in the formula_27 generation. Their relative fitness is given by


where 0 ≤ formula_28 ≤ 1, and 0 ≤ λ ≤ 1.

If λ = 0, then Aa has the same fitness as AA, e.g. if Aa is phenotypically equivalent with AA (A dominant), and if λ = 1, then Aa has the same fitness as aa, e.g. if Aa is phenotypically equivalent with aa (A recessive). In general λ indicates how close in fitness Aa is to aa.

The fraction of selective deaths in the formula_27 generation then is

: formula_30

and the total number of deaths is the population size multiplied by

: formula_31

== Important number 300 ==
Haldane approximates the above equation by taking the continuum limit of the above equation. This is done by multiplying and dividing it by dq so that it is in integral form

:formula_32
substituting q=1-p, the cost (given by the total number of deaths, &#x27;D&#x27;, required to make a substitution) is given by

: formula_33

Assuming λ &lt; 1, this gives

: formula_34

where the last approximation assumes formula_24 to be small.

If λ = 1, then we have

: formula_36

In his discussion Haldane writes that the substitution cost, if it is paid by juvenile deaths, &quot;usually involves a number of deaths equal to about 10 or 20 times the number in a generation&quot; – the minimum being the population size (= &quot;the number in a generation&quot;) and rarely being 100 times that number. Haldane assumes 30 to be the mean value.

Assuming substitution of genes to take place slowly, one gene at a time over &quot;n&quot; generations, the fitness of the species will fall below the optimum (achieved when the substitution is complete) by a factor of about 30/&quot;n&quot;, so long as this is small – small enough to prevent extinction. Haldane doubts that high intensities – such as in the case of the peppered moth – have occurred frequently and estimates that a value of &quot;n&quot; = 300 is a probable number of generations. This gives a selection intensity of formula_37.

Haldane then continues:

The number of loci in a vertebrate species has been estimated at about 40,000. &#x27;Good&#x27; species, even when closely related, may differ at several thousand loci, even if the differences at most of them are very slight. But it takes as many deaths, or their equivalents, to replace a gene by one producing a barely distinguishable phenotype as by one producing a very different one. If two species differ at 1000 loci, and the mean rate of gene substitution, as has been suggested, is one per 300 generations, it will take 300,000 generations to generate an interspecific difference. It may take a good deal more, for if an allele a1 is replaced by a10, the population may pass through stages where the commonest genotype is a1a1, a2a2, a3a3, and so on, successively, the various alleles in turn giving maximal fitness in the existing environment and the residual environment.

The number 300 of generations is a conservative estimate for a slowly evolving species not at the brink of extinction by Haldane&#x27;s calculation. For a difference of at least 1,000 genes, 300,000 generations might be needed – maybe more, if some gene runs through more than one optimisation.

== Origin of the term &quot;Haldane&#x27;s dilemma&quot; ==
Apparently the first use of the term &quot;Haldane&#x27;s dilemma&quot; was by paleontologist Leigh Van Valen in his 1963 paper &quot;Haldane&#x27;s Dilemma, Evolutionary Rates, and Heterosis&quot;.

Van Valen writes:

Haldane (1957 [= &quot;The Cost of Natural Selection&quot;]) drew attention to the fact that in the process of the evolutionary substitution of one allele for another, at any intensity of selection and no matter how slight the importance of the locus, a substantial number of individuals would usually be lost because they did not already possess the new allele. Kimura (1960, 1961) has referred to this loss as the substitutional (or evolutional) load, but because it necessarily involves either a completely new mutation or (more usually) previous change in the environment or the genome, I like to think of it as a dilemma for the population: for most organisms, rapid turnover in a few genes precludes rapid turnover in the others. A corollary of this is that, if an environmental change occurs that necessitates the rather rapid replacement of several genes if a population is to survive, the population becomes extinct.

That is, since a high number of deaths are required to fix one gene rapidly, and dead organisms do not reproduce, fixation of more than one gene simultaneously would conflict. Note that Haldane&#x27;s model assumes independence of genes at different loci; if the selection intensity is 0.1 for each gene moving towards fixation, and there are &quot;N&quot; such genes, then the reproductive capacity of the species will be lowered to 0.9&quot;N&quot; times the original capacity. Therefore, if it is necessary for the population to fix more than one gene, it may not have reproductive capacity to counter the deaths.

== Evolution above Haldane&#x27;s limit ==

Various models evolve at rates above Haldane&#x27;s limit.

J. A. Sved showed that a threshold model of selection, where individuals with a phenotype less than the threshold die and individuals with a phenotype above the threshold are all equally fit, allows for a greater substitution rate than Haldane&#x27;s model (though no obvious upper limit was found, though tentative paths to calculate one were examined e.g. the death rate). John Maynard Smith and Peter O&#x27;Donald followed on the same track.

Additionally, the effects of density-dependent processes, epistasis, and soft selective sweeps on the maximum rate of substitution have been examined.

By looking at the polymorphisms within species and divergence between species an estimate can be obtained for the fraction of substitutions that occur due to selection. This parameter is generally called alpha (hence DFE-alpha), and appears to be large in some species, although almost all approaches suggest that the human-chimp divergence was primarily neutral. However, if divergence between &quot;Drosophila&quot; species was as adaptive as the alpha parameter suggests, then it would exceed Haldane&#x27;s limit.

<doc id="841902" wikidata="Q7740781" url="?curid=841902" title="The Hub (band)">
<text>The Hub is an American &quot;computer network music&quot; ensemble formed in 1986 consisting of John Bischoff, Tim Perkis, Chris Brown, Scot Gresham-Lancaster, Mark Trayle and Phil Stone. &quot;The Hub was the first live computer music band whose members were all composers, as well as designers and builders of their own hardware and software.&quot;

The Hub grew from the League of Automatic Music Composers: John Bischoff, Tim Perkis, Jim Horton, and Rich Gold. Perkis and Bischoff modified their equipment for a performance at The Network Muse Festival in 1986 at The LAB in San Francisco. Instead of creating an ad-hoc wired connection of computer interaction, they decided to use a hub – a general purpose connection for network data. This was less failure-prone and enabled greater collaborations.

The Hub was the first band to do a telematic performance in 1987 at the Clocktower in New York.

Since this work represents some of the earliest work in the context of the new live music practice of networked music performance, they have been cited as the archetypal network ensemble in computer music. The Hub&#x27;s best-known piece, &quot;Stuck Note&quot; by Scot Gresham-Lancaster has been covered by a number of network music bands, including MiLO – the Milwaukee Laptop Orchestra – and BiLE – the Birmingham Laptop Ensemble.

They have collaborated with Rova Saxophone Quartet, Nick Collins, Phill Niblock, and Alvin Curran. They currently perform around the world after a multi-year hiatus, ending in 2004.

In 2018, The Hub was awarded the Giga-Hertz Prize for lifetime achievement in electronic music by ZKM in Karlsruhe, Germany.

<text>George Mitchell Seabroke FRAS (1 April 1848 – 1 April 1918) was an English amateur astronomer. By profession he was a solicitor.

He took an interest in astronomy while a pupil at Rugby School. Together with the school&#x27;s Mathematics and Science Master, James Wilson (later Canon of Worcester), he observed double stars at the Temple Observatory. He remained at the observatory, carrying out observations and promoting the study of astronomy to the schoolboys of Rugby School. The Observatory boasted an 8¼ inch (210mm) aperture refracting telescope built by Alvan Clark of America.

He was one of the founders of the British Astronomical Association, and served as its Double Star Section Director from 1892 to 1915, its Saturn Section Director from 1899 to 1911, and its national president from 1900 to 1902. He also served as Midland Branch President from 1902 to 1903.

<doc id="841907" wikidata="Q2778755" url="?curid=841907" title="Naval operations in the Dardanelles campaign">
<text>The naval operations in the Dardanelles campaign (17 February 1915 – 9 January 1916) took place against the Ottoman Empire during the First World War. Ships of the Royal Navy, French , Imperial Russian Navy () and the Royal Australian Navy, attempted to force a passage through the Dardanelles Straits, a narrow, waterway connecting the Mediterranean Sea with the Sea of Marmara and the Black Sea further north.

The naval operations were defeated by the Ottoman defenders, mainly through use of naval mines. The Allies conducted the Gallipoli campaign, a land invasion of the Gallipoli peninsula to eliminate the Ottoman artillery along the straits before resuming naval operations. The Allies also passed submarines through the Dardanelles to attack Ottoman shipping in the Sea of Marmara.

==Background==
===Dardanelles Strait===

The mouth of the strait is wide with a rapid current emptying from the Black Sea into the Aegean. The distance from Cape Helles to the Sea of Marmara is about , overlooked by the heights on the Gallipoli peninsula and lower hills on the Asiatic shore. The passage widens for to Eren Keui Bay, the widest point of the strait at , then narrows for to Kephez Point, where the waterway is wide and then broadens as far as Sari Sighlar Bay. The narrowest part of the strait is upstream, from Chanak to Kilid Bahr at , where the channel turns north and widens for to Nagara Point. From the point, the passage turns north-east for the final to the Sea of Marmara. The Ottomans used the term &quot;fortress&quot; to describe the sea defences of the Dardanelles on both sides of the waterway from the Aegean approaches to Chanak. In 1914 only the defences from the entrance of the straits and from the north end of Kephez Bay to Chanak had been fortified. Until late October 1914, the nature of the seaward defences of the Dardanelles was known to the British and French but after hostilities commenced, information on improvements to the Ottoman fortifications became harder to obtain.

===Ottoman entry into the war===


At the beginning of the 20th century, the Ottoman Empire had a reputation as the sick man of Europe. After the Balkan Wars of 1912 and 1913, the French, British and Germans had offered financial aid. In December 1913, the Germans sent a military mission to Constantinople, headed by General Otto Liman von Sanders. The geographical position of the Ottoman Empire meant that Russia, France and Britain had a significant interest in Ottoman neutrality. During the Sarajevo Crisis in 1914, German diplomats offered Turkey an anti-Russian alliance and territorial gains, when the pro-British faction in the Cabinet was isolated, due to the British ambassador&#x27;s absence. On 30 July 1914, two days after the outbreak of the war in Europe, the Ottoman leaders, unaware that the British might enter a European war, agreed to a secret Ottoman-German Alliance against Russia, although it did not require them to undertake military action.

On 2 August, the British requisitioned the modern battleships and which British shipyards had been building for the Ottoman Navy, alienating pro-British elements. The German government offered and as replacements. In the Pursuit of Goeben and Breslau, the ships escaped when the Ottoman government opened the Dardanelles to them, despite international law requiring a neutral party to block military shipping. In September, the British naval mission to the Ottomans was recalled and Rear Admiral Wilhelm Souchon of the Imperial German Navy took command of the Ottoman navy. The German naval presence, and the success of the German armies, gave the pro-German faction in the Ottoman government enough influence to declare war on Russia.

===Closure of the Dardanelles===
In October 1914, following an incident on 27 September, when the British Dardanelles squadron had seized an Ottoman torpedo boat, the German commander of the Dardanelles fortifications ordered the passage closed, adding to the impression that the Ottomans were pro-German. Hostilities began on 28 October, when the Ottoman fleet, including &quot;Goeben&quot; and &quot;Breslau&quot; (flying the Ottoman flag and renamed and but still commanded by German officers and manned by German crews) conducted the Black Sea Raid. Odessa and Sevastopol were bombarded, and a Russian minelayer and gunboat were sunk. The Ottomans refused an Allied demand that they expel the German missions and on 31 October 1914, formally joined the Central Powers. Russia declared war on Turkey on 2 November and the British ambassador left Constantinople the next day.

A British naval squadron bombarded the Dardanelles outer defensive forts at Kum Kale and Seddulbahir; a shell hit a magazine and the explosion knocked the guns off their mounts and killed Britain and France declared war on Turkey on 5 November and the Ottomans declared a &quot;jihad&quot; (holy war) later that month. The Caucasus campaign, an Ottoman attack on Russia through the Caucasus Mountains began in December, leading the Russians to call for aid from Britain in January 1915. The Mesopotamian campaign began with a British landing to occupy the oil facilities in the Persian Gulf. The Ottomans prepared to attack Egypt in early 1915, to occupy the Suez Canal and cut the Mediterranean route to British India and the Far East.

==Prelude==
===Allied strategy===

Field Marshal Lord Kitchener planned an amphibious landing near Alexandretta in Syria in 1914, to sever the capital from Syria, Palestine and Egypt. Vice Admiral Sir Richard Peirse, Commander-in-Chief, East Indies, ordered to Alexandretta on 13 December 1914 as the and the French cruiser &quot;Requin&quot; were performing similar operations. The Alexandretta landing was abandoned because it required more resources than France could allocate, and politically France did not want the British operating in their sphere of influence, a position to which Britain had agreed in 1912. By late 1914, static warfare had begun on the Western Front, with no prospect of a quick decisive victory and the Central Powers had closed the overland trade routes between Britain, France and Russia. The White Sea in the Arctic and the Sea of Okhotsk in the Far East were icebound in winter and the Baltic Sea was blockaded by the &quot;Kaiserliche Marine&quot; (Imperial German Navy). Ottoman belligerence closed the Dardanelles, the remaining supply route to Russia.

In November 1914, the French Minister Aristide Briand proposed an attack on the Ottoman Empire but the idea was rejected and an attempt by the British to buy off the Ottomans also failed. On 2 January 1915, Grand Duke Nicholas of Russia appealed to Britain for assistance against the Ottoman Erzurum Offensive in the Caucasus and planning began for a naval demonstration in the Dardanelles, as a diversion. Winston Churchill, the First Lord of the Admiralty, proposed an invasion of Schleswig-Holstein by sea, drawing Denmark into the war and re-opening the Baltic Sea route to Russia and an attack on the Dardanelles, to control the Mediterranean-Black Sea supply route and to encourage Bulgaria and Romania to join the Allies. The urgency of the Russian appeal and disdain for the military power of the Ottoman Empire made a campaign in the Dardanelles appear feasible.

On 11 January 1915, the commander of the British Mediterranean Squadron, Vice Admiral S. H. Carden proposed a plan for forcing the Dardanelles using battleships, submarines and minesweepers. On 13 February, the British War Council approved the plan and Carden was given more pre-dreadnought battleships, the modern battleship and the battlecruiser . France contributed a squadron including four pre-dreadnoughts and the Russian navy provided the light cruiser &quot;Askold&quot;. In early February 1915, the naval forces were supplemented by contingents of Royal Marines and the 29th Division, the last uncommitted regular division, which joined Australian and New Zealand Army Corps (Anzac) divisions training in Egypt. The infantry were intended for the occupation of Constantinople after the straits had been taken by the Entente navies.

===Dardanelles defences===
In August 1914, the Outer Defences were two fortresses at the end of the Gallipoli peninsula and two on the Asiatic shore. The forts had 19 guns, four with a range of and the remainder with ranges of . Four field howitzers were dug in at Tekke Burnu (Cape Tekke) on the European side, then for the next , there was a gap until the Intermediate Defences at Kephez Point, with four defensive works on the south shore and one on the north shore. The fortresses had been built to cover a minefield, which in August 1914 was a line of mines across the strait from Kephez Point to the European shore. Fort Dardanos was the main work which had two new 6-inch naval guns and the rest contained ten small quick-firing guns with shields. At the Narrows, the Inner Defences had the heaviest guns and some mobile light howitzers and field guns. Five forts had been built on the European side and six on the Asian side with and medium guns. Most of the artillery was obsolescent but there were five long-range guns with a range of and three guns with a range. The remainder of the guns in the Inner Defences were mostly obsolete and unable to shoot beyond .

Of the in the pre-war defences, only modern long-range pieces, the rest being old-fashioned breech loaders on fixed carriages. The gunners were poorly trained, there was little ammunition and scant prospect of replacement. Night illumination consisted of a searchlight at entrance to the Straits and one at the Narrows. The forts were easily visible, there were few gun shields and other protective features for the gun-crews and range-finding, artillery observation and fire-control depended on an telephones linked by wire on telephone poles, vulnerable to artillery-fire. The Ottoman official historian wrote,

===Ottoman strategy===

The Germans secured the appointment of Lieutenant-General Erich Weber as an advisor to the Ottoman GHQ and at the end of August 1914, Vice-Admiral Guido von Usedom, several specialists and were sent to reinforce the forts on the Dardanelles and Bosphorus. In September, Usedom was made Inspector-General of Coast Defences and Mines and Vice-Admiral Johannes Merten relieved Weber at Chanak with a marine detachment to operate the modern guns. By mid-September, the German advisers reported that the guns in the Narrows had been refurbished and were serviceable. By October, most of the guns in the main batteries had German crews, operating as training units but able to man the guns in an emergency. Plans were made to build more defensive works in the Intermediate Zone and to bring in mobile howitzers and quick-firers dismounted from older Ottoman ships. Several heavy howitzers arrived in October but the poor standard of training of the Ottoman gunners, obsolete armaments and the chronic ammunition shortage, which Usedom reported was sufficient only to defend against one serious attack, led him to base the defence of the straits on minefields.

Three more lines of mines had been laid before Usedom arrived and another were searched out, serviced and laid in early November. Cover of the minefields was increased with small quick-firers and four more searchlights. By March 1915, there were ten lines of mines and When the Ottoman Empire went to war on 29 October 1914, the defences of the Straits had been much improved but the Intermediate Defences were still inadequately organised and lacking in guns, searchlights and mines. On 3 November, the outer forts were bombarded by Allied ships, which galvanised the Ottoman defenders into reducing their obstructionism against the German advisers. The fortress commander, Jevad Pasha, wrote later that he had to improve the defences at all costs. The short bombardment had been extraordinarily successful, destroying the forts at Sedd el Bahr with two shots, that exploded the magazine and dismounted the guns. The Ottoman and German defenders concluded that the Outer Defences could be demolished by ships firing from beyond the range of the Ottoman reply. The forts were repaired but not reinforced and the main effort was directed to protecting the minefield and Inner Defences.

==Naval operations==
===Forcing the straits===
On 3 November 1914, Churchill ordered an attack on the Dardanelles following the opening of hostilities between Ottoman and Russian empires. The battlecruisers of the Mediterranean Squadron, and and the obsolete French battleships and , attacked before a formal declaration of war had been made by Britain against the Ottoman Empire. The attack was to test the Ottoman defences and in a twenty-minute bombardment, a shell struck the magazine of the fort at Sedd el Bahr, dismounting ten guns and killing 86 Ottoman soldiers. Total casualties during the attack were 150, of which forty were German. The effect of the bombardment alerted the Ottomans to the importance of strengthening their defences and they began laying more mines.

The outer defences lay at the entrance to the straits, vulnerable to bombardment and raiding but the inner defences covered the Narrows near Çanakkale. Beyond the inner defences, the straits were virtually undefended but the defence of the straits depended on ten minefields, mines laid near the Narrows. On 19 February 1915, two destroyers were sent in to probe the straits and the first shot was fired from Kumkale by the Krupp guns of the Orhaniye Tepe battery at 07:58. The battleships and moved in to engage the forts and &quot;Cornwallis&quot; opened fire at 09:51. The effect of the long-range bombardment was considered disappointing and that it would take direct hits on guns to knock them out. With limited ammunition, indirect fire was insufficient and direct fire would need the ships to be anchored to make stable gun platforms. Ottoman casualties were reported as several men killed on the European shore and three men at Orkanie.
On 25 February the Allies attacked again, the Ottomans evacuated the outer defences and the fleet entered the straits to engage the intermediate defences. Demolition parties of Royal Marines raided the Sedd el Bahr and Kum Kale forts, meeting little opposition. On 1 March, four battleships bombarded the intermediate defences but little progress was made clearing the minefields. The minesweepers, commanded by the chief of staff, Roger Keyes, were un-armoured trawlers manned by their civilian crews, who were unwilling to work while under fire. The strong current in the straits further hampered minesweeping and strengthened Ottoman resolve which had wavered at the start of the offensive; on 4 March, twenty-three marines were killed raiding the outer defences.

&quot;Queen Elizabeth&quot; was called on to engage the inner defences, at first from the Aegean coast near Gaba Tepe, firing across the peninsula and later in the straits. On the night of 13 March, the cruiser led six minesweepers in an attempt to clear the mines. Four of the trawlers were hit and &quot;Amethyst&quot; was badly damaged with nineteen stokers killed from one hit. On 15 March, the Admiralty accepted a plan by Carden for another attack by daylight, with the minesweepers protected by the fleet. Carden was taken ill the same day and was replaced by Rear Admiral John de Robeck. A gunnery officer noted in his diary that de Robeck had already expressed misgivings about silencing the Ottoman guns by naval bombardment and that this view was widely held on board the ship.

===Battle of 18 March===

The event that decided the battle took place on the night of 18 March when the Ottoman minelayer laid a line of mines in front of the Kephez minefield, across the head of Eren Köy Bay, a wide bay along the Asian shore just inside the entrance to the straits. The Ottomans had noticed the British ships turned to starboard into the bay when withdrawing. The new row of 20 mines ran parallel to the shore, were moored at and spaced about apart. The clear water meant that the mines could have been seen through the water by reconnaissance aircraft. The British plan for 18 March was to silence the defences guarding the first five minefields, which would be cleared overnight by the minesweepers. The next day the remaining defences around the Narrows would be defeated and the last five minefields would be cleared. The operation went ahead with the British and French ignorant of the recent additions to the Ottoman minefields. The battleships were arranged in three lines, two British and one French, with supporting ships on the flanks and two ships in reserve.
The first British line opened fire from Eren Köy Bay around 11:00. Shortly after noon, de Robeck ordered the French line to pass through and close on the Narrows forts. The Ottoman fire began to take its toll with &quot;Gaulois&quot;, &quot;Suffren&quot;, &quot;Agamemnon&quot; and &quot;Inflexible&quot; suffering hits. While the naval fire had not destroyed the Ottoman batteries, it had succeeded in temporarily reducing their fire. By 13:25, the Ottoman defences were mostly silent so de Robeck decided to withdraw the French line and bring forward the second British line as well as &quot;Swiftsure&quot; and &quot;Majestic&quot;.

The Allied forces had failed to properly sweep the entire area for mines. Aerial reconnaissance by aircraft from the seaplane carrier had discovered a number of mines on 16 and 17 March but failed to spot the line of mines laid by &quot;Nusret&quot; in Eren Köy Bay. On the day of the attack civilian trawlers sweeping for mines in front of line &quot;A&quot; discovered and destroyed three mines in an area thought to be clear, before the trawlers withdrew under fire. This information was not passed on to de Robeck. At 13:54, &quot;Bouvet&quot;—having made a turn to starboard into Eren Köy Bay—struck a mine, capsized and sank within a couple of minutes, killing 639 crewmen, only being rescued. At first it appeared that the ship had been hit in a magazine and de Robeck thought that the ship had struck a floating mine or been torpedoed.
The British pressed on with the attack. Around 16:00, &quot;Inflexible&quot; began to withdraw and struck a mine near where &quot;Bouvet&quot; had sunk, thirty crew being killed and the ship taking on with of water. The battlecruiser remained afloat, was eventually beached on the island of Bozcaada (Tenedos) and temporarily repaired with a coffer dam. &quot;Irresistible&quot; was the next to be mined and as it began to drift, the crew were taken off. De Robeck told &quot;Ocean&quot; to take &quot;Irresistible&quot; under tow but the water was deemed too shallow to make an approach. At 18:05, &quot;Ocean&quot; struck a mine which jammed the steering gear leaving the ship adrift. The abandoned battleships were still floating when the British withdrew but when a destroyer commanded by Commodore Roger Keyes returned to tow or sink the vessels, they could not be found despite a 4-hour search.

In 1934, Keyes wrote that


For 118 casualties, the Ottomans sank three battleships, severely damaged three others and inflicted seven hundred casualties on the British-French fleet. There were calls amongst the British, particularly from Churchill, to press on with the naval attack and De Robeck advised on 20 March that he was reorganising his minesweepers. Churchill responded that he was sending four replacement ships; with the exception of &quot;Inflexible&quot;, the ships were expendable. It is not correct that the ammunition of the guns was low: they could have repulsed two more attacks. The crews of the sunken battleships replaced the civilians on the trawler minesweepers and were much more willing to keep sweeping under fire. The US Ambassador to Constantinople, Henry Morgenthau, reported that Constantinople expected to be attacked and that the Ottomans felt they could only hold out for a few hours if the attack had resumed on 19 March. Further, he thought that Turkey itself might well disintegrate as a state once the capital fell.

The main minefields at the narrows, over ten layers deep, were still intact and protected by the smaller shore guns that had not seen any action on 18 March. These and other defences further in the strait had not exhausted their ammunition and resources yet. It was not a given that one more push by the fleet would have resulted in passage to Marmara Sea. Churchill had anticipated losses and considered them a necessary tactical price. In June 1915, he discussed the campaign with the war correspondent Ellis Ashmead-Bartlett, who had returned to London to deliver uncensored reports. Ashmead-Bartlett was incensed at the loss of ships and lives but Churchill responded that the ships were expendable. To place the losses into perspective, the Navy had ordered six hundred new ships during the period Admiral Fisher was First Sea Lord, approximately corresponding with the length of the Dardanelles campaign.
De Robeck wrote on 18 March,

The fleet lost more ships than the Royal Navy had suffered since the Battle of Trafalgar; on 23 March, de Robeck telegraphed to the Admiralty that land forces were needed. He later told the Dardanelles Commission investigating the campaign, that his main reason for changing his mind, was concern for what might happen in the event of success, that the fleet might find itself at Constantinople or on the Marmara sea fighting an enemy which did not simply surrender as the plan assumed, without any troops to secure captured territory. With the failure of the naval assault, the idea that land forces could advance around the backs of the Dardanelles forts and capture Constantinople gained support as an alternative and on 25 April, the Gallipoli campaign commenced.

===Further naval plans===
Following the failure of the land campaign up to May, De Robeck suggested that it might be desirable to again attempt a naval attack. Churchill supported this idea, at least as far as restarting attempts to clear mines but this was opposed by Fisher and other members of the Admiralty Board. Aside from difficulties in the Dardanelles, they were concerned at the prospect that more ships might have to be diverted away from the Grand Fleet in the North Sea. This disagreement contributed to the final resignation of Fisher, followed by the need for Asquith to seek coalition partners to shore up his government and the consequential dismissal of Churchill also. Further naval attacks were shelved.

Keyes remained a firm supporter of naval action and on 23 September submitted a further proposal to pass through the Dardanelles to de Robeck. De Robeck disliked the plan but passed it to the Admiralty. Risk to ships had increased since March, due to the presence of German submarines in the Mediterranean and the Sea of Marmara, where the British ships would be inviting targets if the plan succeeded. The Allied minesweeping force was better equipped and some of the ships had nets or mine bumpers, which it was hoped would improve their chances against mines. The Ottoman Empire had regained land communications with Germany since the fall of Serbia and demands on the Anglo-French navies for more ships to support the attempt had to be added to the commitment of ships for the land campaign and operations at Salonica attempting to support Serbia. Kitchener made a proposal to take the Isthmus of Bulair using forty thousand men to allow British ships operating in the Marmara Sea to be supplied across land from the Gulf of Xeros. Admiralty opinion was that another naval attack could not be mounted without support of land forces attacking the Dardanelles forts, which was deemed impractical for lack of troops. Kitchener visited the area to inspect the positions and talk to the commanders concerned, before reporting back advising a withdrawal. The War Committee, faced with a choice either of an uncertain new campaign to break the stalemate or complete withdrawal, recommended on 23 November that all troops should be withdrawn.

The British cabinet as a whole was less keen to abandon the campaign, because of political repercussions of a failure and damaging consequences for Russia. De Robeck had been temporarily replaced by Admiral Rosslyn Wemyss in November 1915 for reasons of ill health. In contrast to De Robeck, Wemyss was a supporter of further action and considerably more optimistic of chances of success. Whereas de Robeck estimated losses at 12 battleships, Wemyss considered it likely to lose no more than three. It was suggested that liquidating the Salonica commitment, where the troops involved never managed to aid Serbia and did little fighting, could provide the reinforcements but this was vetoed by the French. Wemyss continued a campaign promoting the chances of success. He had been present when de Robeck assumed command from Carden and was more senior but had been commanding the base at Mudros whereas de Robeck was with the fleet. Churchill had preferentially chosen de Robeck. On 7 December, it was decided by Cabinet to abandon the campaign.

===Submarine operations===

British submarine attacks had commenced in 1914, before the campaign proper had started. On 13 December, the submarine (Lieutenant-Commander Norman Holbrook) had entered the straits, avoiding five lines of mines and torpedoed the Ottoman battleship , built in 1874, which was anchored as a floating fort in Sari Sighlar Bay, south of Çanakkale. &quot;Mesûdiye&quot; capsized in ten minutes, trapping many of the 673-man crew. Lying in shoal water, the hull remained above the surface so most men were rescued by cutting holes in the hull but 37 men were killed. The sinking was a triumph for the Royal Navy. Holbrook was awarded the Victoria Cross—the first Royal Navy VC of the war—and all twelve other crew members received awards. Coupled with the naval bombardment of the outer defences on 3 November, this success encouraged the British to pursue the campaign.

The first French submarine operation also preceded the start of the campaign; on 15 January 1915, the French submarine negotiated the Narrows, passing the ten lines of mines before running aground at Nagara Point. Various accounts claim she was either mined, sunk by shellfire or scuttled, leaving fourteen crew dead and thirteen prisoners of war. On 17 April, the British submarine attempted to pass the straits but having dived too deep, was caught in a current and ran aground near Kepez Point, the southern tip of Sarı Sıĝlar Bay, under the guns of the Dardanos battery. Seven of the crew were killed and the remainder were captured. The beached &quot;E15&quot; was a valuable prize for the Ottomans and the British went to great lengths to deny it to them and managed to sink it after numerous attempts.
The first submarine to pass the straits was the Australian (Lieutenant-Commander Henry Stoker) which got through on the night of 24/25 April. The army landings at Cape Helles and Anzac Cove began at dawn on 25 April. Although &quot;AE2&quot; sank one Ottoman destroyer, thought to be a cruiser, the submarine was thwarted by defective torpedoes in several other attacks. On 29 April, in Artaki Bay near Panderma, &quot;AE2&quot; was sighted and hit by the Ottoman torpedo boat . Abandoning ship, the crew was taken prisoner.

The second submarine through the straits had more luck than &quot;AE2&quot;. On 27 April, (Lieutenant-Commander Edward Boyle), entered the Sea of Marmara and went on a three-week sortie that was one of the most successful actions of the Allies in the campaign. The quantity and value of the shipping sunk was relatively minor but the effect on Ottoman communications and morale was significant. On his return, Boyle was immediately awarded the Victoria Cross. Boyle and &quot;E14&quot; made a number of tours of the Sea of Marmara. His third tour began on 21 July, when he passed the straits, despite the Ottomans having installed an anti-submarine net near the Narrows. (Lieutenant-Commander Martin Nasmith) also cruised the Sea of Marmara and Nasmith was awarded the VC and promoted to Commander for his achievements. &quot;E11&quot; sank or disabled eleven ships, including three on 24 May at the port of Rodosto on the Thracian shore. On 8 August, during a later tour of the Marmara, &quot;E11&quot; torpedoed the .
A number of demolition missions were performed by men or parties landed from submarines. On 8 September, First Lieutenant H. V. Lyon from swam ashore near Küçükçekmece (Thrace) to blow up a railway bridge. The bridge was destroyed but Lyon failed to return. Attempts were also made to disrupt the railways running close to the water along the Gulf of İzmit, on the Asian shore of the sea. On the night of 20 August, Lieutenant Guy D&#x27;Oyly-Hughes from &quot;E11&quot; swam ashore and blew up a section of the railway line. On 17 July, bombarded the railway line and then damaged two trains that were forced to halt.

French attempts to enter the Sea of Marmara continued. Following the success of &quot;AE2&quot; and &quot;E14&quot;, the French submarine attempted the passage on 1 May but she struck a mine and was lost with all hands. The next attempt was made by on 27 July. &quot;Mariotte&quot; was caught in the anti-submarine net that &quot;E14&quot; had eluded and was forced to the surface. After being shelled from the shore batteries, &quot;Mariotte&quot; was scuttled. On 4 September, the same net caught &quot;E7&quot; as it began another tour.

The first French submarine to enter the Sea of Marmara was but it was forced to turn back and on 30 October, when returning through the straits, ran aground beneath a fort and was captured intact. The crew of twenty-five were taken prisoner and documents detailing Allied operations were discovered, which included a rendezvous with scheduled for 6 November. The rendezvous was kept by the German U-boat which torpedoed and sank &quot;E20&quot; killing all but nine of the crew. &quot;Turquoise&quot; was salvaged and incorporated (but not commissioned) into the Ottoman Navy as the , named after the gunner who had forced the French commander to surrender.

The Allied submarine campaign in the Sea of Marmara was the one significant success of the Gallipoli campaign, forcing the Ottomans to abandon it as a transport route. Between April and December 1915, nine British and four French submarines sank one battleship, one destroyer, five gunboats, eleven troop transports, forty-four supply ships and 148 sailing vessels at a cost of eight Allied submarines sunk in the strait or in the Sea of Marmara.

==Military operations==
===Gallipoli landings===

The Mediterranean Expeditionary Force (General Sir Ian Hamilton) was established on 12 March with about . At a conference on 22 March, four days after the failed attempt by the navy, it was decided to use the infantry to seize the Gallipoli peninsula and capture the forts, clearing the way for the navy to pass through into the Sea of Marmara. Preparations for the landing took a month, giving the Ottoman defenders ample time to reinforce. The British planners underestimated the Ottomans and expected that the invasion would be over swiftly. The initial landings were made at Gaba Tepe by the Australian and New Zealand Army Corps (Anzac). The landing miscarried and the troops went ashore too far north at a place now known as Anzac Cove. In both landings, the covering force went ashore from warships with the exception of V Beach at Helles where the was used as an improvised landing craft for 2,000 men. In the landing at Anzac Cove, the first wave went ashore from the boats of three s, , and . The second wave went ashore from seven destroyers. In support were HMS &quot;Triumph&quot;, &quot;Majestic&quot; and the cruiser as well as the seaplane carrier &quot;Ark Royal&quot; and the kite-balloon ship, , from which a tethered balloon was trailed to provide artillery spotting.
The landing at Cape Helles by the 29th Division was spread over five beaches with the main ones being V and W Beaches at the tip of the peninsula. While the landing at Anzac was planned as a surprise without a preliminary bombardment, the Helles landing was made after the beaches and forts were bombarded by the warships. The landing at S Beach inside the straits was made from the battleship &quot;Cornwallis&quot; and was virtually unopposed. The W Beach force came from the cruiser and the battleship which also carried the troops bound for X Beach. The cruiser and battleship supported the X Beach landing as well as a small landing to the north on the Aegean coast at Y Beach, later abandoned.

The navy was to support the landing, using naval guns as substitutes for field artillery, of which there was a severe shortage. With a few spectacular exceptions, the performance of naval guns on land targets was inadequate, particularly against entrenched positions. The guns lacked elevation and so fired on a flat trajectory which, coupled with the inherently unstable gun platform, resulted in reduced accuracy. The battleships&#x27; guns did prove effective against exposed lines of troops. On 27 April, during the first Ottoman counter-attack at Anzac, the Ottoman 57th Infantry Regiment attacked down the seaward slope of Battleship Hill within view of &quot;Queen Elizabeth&quot; which fired a salvo of six shells, halting the attack. On 28 April, near the old Y Beach landing, &quot;Queen Elizabeth&quot; sighted a party of about one hundred Turks. One 15-inch shrapnel shell containing 13,000 shrapnel bullets was fired at short range and killed the entire party.
On 27 April, an observer on a kite-balloon ship had spotted an Ottoman transport ship moving near the Narrows. &quot;Queen Elizabeth&quot;, stationed off Gaba Tepe, had fired across the peninsula at a range of over , and sank the transport with the third shot. For much of the campaign, the Ottomans transported troops via rail, though other supplies continued to be moved by ship on the Sea of Marmara and Dardanelles. At Helles, which was initially the main battlefield, a series of costly battles only managed to edge the front line closer to Krithia. The navy continued to provide support via bombardments but in May, the battleship &quot;Goliath&quot; was sunk by the Ottoman torpedo boat in Morto Bay on 12 May and torpedoed and sank &quot;Triumph&quot; off Anzac on 25 May and &quot;Majestic&quot; off W Beach on 27 May.

Permanent battleship support was withdrawn with the valuable &quot;Queen Elizabeth&quot; recalled by the Admiralty as soon as the news of the loss of &quot;Goliath&quot; arrived. In place of the battleships, naval artillery support was provided by cruisers, destroyers and purpose-built monitors which were designed for coastal bombardment. Once the navy became wary of the submarine threat, losses ceased. With the exception of the continued activity of Allied submarines in the Dardanelles and Sea of Marmara, the only significant naval loss after May was the destroyer which ran aground off Suvla during a gale on 31 October and was wrecked. The destruction of the stranded ship was accelerated by Ottoman gunfire.

===Troop transports===
Another important aspect of the allied naval operations was transporting thousands of soldiers to and from the Dardanelles over the Mediterranean Sea. The major threats were attacks by German and Austrian-Hungarian submarines and mines. The worst loss during the Dardanelles Campaign was the sinking of on 13 August 1915. The ship sailed from Alexandria, Egypt to Gallipoli with 1,367 officers and men on board and was torpedoed by near the Dodecanese, with 935 lives lost.

<text>Perverted Justice Foundation, Inc., more commonly known as Perverted-Justice (also known as PeeJ), was an American organization based in California and Oregon which investigated, identified, and publicized the conduct of adults who have used chat rooms and other social media in order to solicit online sexual conversations and in-person meetings with minors. Their website serves as an archive of collected data on these investigations, which they make available in order to assist law enforcement and the public in understanding the behavior and child grooming techniques of online hebephiles.

The activity of the Perverted-Justice organization included online volunteers carrying out sting operations by posing as minors (the age range portrayed by the decoys is usually 10–15) on chat sites and waiting for adults to approach them. After obtaining the identifying information of the adults who are seeking sexual contact with minors (the adult seeking the minor may offer their telephone number or other details so that a meeting can be arranged), the organization would then pass the information on to law enforcement. Perverted-Justice&#x27;s methods are controversial, and critics have labeled these actions harassment and possibly legal entrapment. The site additionally attracted media attention, both laudatory and critical, as a result of their collaboration with &quot;Dateline NBC&quot; on a series of televised sting operations called &quot;To Catch a Predator.&quot;

Perverted-Justice also operated a site that targets groups and individuals it identifies as being involved in the pedophile activism community, a site that provides information to abuse victims on their legal recourse, a site that gives advice to minors on dealing with grooming on the internet, and a site that targets organizations that Perverted-Justice believes allow pedophile activists to use their services. The foundation also offers free online training to law enforcement officers and has an intern program for college students.

In late 2018, Perverted-Justice announced that, from the beginning of 2019, they would be formally ending decoy operations, and effectively cease all other operations afterwards. They also announced that they would be converting the official website to an archive of past operations and collected data, and removing other site features such as the forums. The data they proposed to compile and make accessible on the website, including thousands of formerly unseen chat logs, is available for research purposes in order to assist anti-pedophile groups and law enforcement with regard to understanding the behavior and techniques of online pedophiles.

==Background==
Perverted-Justice was set up in 2002 by Frank Fencepost and Xavier Von Erck (born Philip John Eide). The organization says that its online operations have led to 623 convictions as of October 8, 2018, with over 200 more currently awaiting trial, and an average of 25 arrests a month for the year of 2006. In 2006, the organization reported annual income of , with Von Erck earning a salary of .

The site originally started with the posting of chat logs to shame people who engaged in sexual chats with purported children. Some members of the site allegedly went further by harassing the targets of their chats in real life, as well as their friends, neighbors, employers, and family. After a falling-out over a vitriolic chat log with a phone verifier in 2004, Fencepost was dismissed from the site. &quot;Xavier became much more oriented toward getting pedophiles arrested rather than just making them complete social pariahs in their neighborhood,&quot; says Fencepost.

Von Erck said he got the idea for the website while watching people attempt to groom young girls in chat rooms in Oregon. He says Perverted-Justice is a computer agency that works closely with law enforcement agencies. &quot;The media likes to use the term &#x27;vigilante&#x27; because it gets attention, but we don&#x27;t consider ourselves vigilantes. We cultivate cooperation with police and work within the law to get justice, not outside of the law.&quot;

==Methods==
Perverted-Justice functions by supporting volunteers who act as informants in chat rooms where minors can typically be found. The volunteers&#x27; public profiles have youthful-sounding usernames, young ages, and pictures of children. The administrators of the site say they do not initiate online contact with the users, and refuse to act on tips from the public as a result. If a user starts chatting to the volunteer and turns the conversation to sex, the volunteer responds positively and encourages them to divulge personal details, particularly a telephone number, ostensibly needed to verify their identity so that a meeting can be arranged.

In the past, around this point the chatlog and details would be published on the site. Volunteers on the site&#x27;s forums would then engage in &quot;follow-up&quot;, attempting to identify and notify family members, employers, and neighbors. However, in December 2003, the organization set up its &quot;Information First&quot; program, in which interested police departments could contact Perverted-Justice, and any &quot;busts&quot; made within that department&#x27;s jurisdiction would be sent straight to them without being posted to the website. In the early days of the program, Perverted-Justice.com did not initiate contact with the police, professedly because officers were skeptical that its information could be used in a court of law.

Since July 2004 when they facilitated their first conviction, the site&#x27;s operators switched to a policy of cold calling local police with the information they obtained. If a government agency is interested (police, FBI, military CID, etc.) then the chatlog and other information is not posted to the site until after a conviction has been reached.

Before Perverted-Justice&#x27;s &quot;Information First&quot; program and cold-calling policy became standard, logs that received no interest from law enforcement agencies were posted directly to the website. In November 2006, after the site&#x27;s 100th conviction, Perverted-Justice announced that chat logs would no longer be posted unless law enforcement was involved first, as &quot;Information First&quot; agreements were sufficient to cover most U.S. residents caught in a sting. The complete unedited chat logs, which usually contain sexually explicit content and obscenities (and sometimes are annotated with comments from the Perverted-Justice volunteer) are now posted to the website only after the person&#x27;s legal case has been resolved. The current follow-up process consists of notifying a community of the offender&#x27;s status once a person has been arrested and convicted.

To begin the follow-up process, the site&#x27;s volunteers do a reverse-directory lookup to obtain their target&#x27;s name, as well as checking on the Web for any other information they can find about them. They then post the target&#x27;s name, address, and photograph if available, on the website, as well as the chat log: a record of the conversation they had with the volunteer. In a process called &quot;Follow-up,&quot; additional volunteers on the site&#x27;s forums, operating under rules and restrictions set up by Perverted-Justice administrators, will contact the target&#x27;s family, friends, neighbors, and employer to alert them to the website posting.

All telephone numbers are removed from the site&#x27;s main pages after two months (though still available on the site&#x27;s forums), to avoid another case like that of the Milwaukee bank teller, who received a threatening phone call from a man who had obtained her number from the website. The woman had never been online or even owned a computer, and was forced to change her number, which had previously been registered to the subject of a Perverted-Justice sting.

==Media==
Volunteers also take part in what the site&#x27;s operators call &quot;group media busts,&quot; where people are invited to a house by a self-proclaimed minor, who is actually a Perverted-Justice volunteer. When they arrive, they are greeted by a television news reporter. The first of these events were conducted in late 2003, in co-operation with investigative reporter John Mercure at Milwaukee&#x27;s WTMJ-TV, whom the site credits with initially conceiving the concept. Similar events with other local news organizations took place in the following months.

In November 2004, the site teamed up with &quot;Dateline NBC&quot; in New York City to conduct a large sting operation, or &quot;group media bust,&quot; entitled &quot;To Catch a Predator&quot;. &quot;Dateline&quot; rented a house and wired it with hidden cameras, while volunteers posed as minors in chat rooms, telling users who talked to them that they were home alone. &quot;Within hours there were men literally lining up at our door,&quot; &quot;Dateline&quot; reported. In two-and-a-half days, 18 men showed up at the house after making a date with a Perverted-Justice volunteer.

After the third installment of &quot;To Catch a Predator&quot;, Perverted-Justice hired an agent and put the group&#x27;s services out for bid to several television networks. NBC came out ahead and continued the highly rated series. Since then, the &quot;To Catch a Predator&quot; series of reports has grown into a widely recognized phenomenon, with busts all over the United States and numerous references and parodies in the media.

==Convictions==
Perverted-Justice&#x27;s website documents convictions that include disorderly conduct, indecently soliciting a child, attempting to entice a juvenile to travel with intent to engage in sexual act, transporting child pornography, and possession and dissemination of child pornography. According to the official website, Perverted Justice contributed to at least 623 convictions while stating that the actual number is likely closer to 650.

==Other activities==
Perverted Justice formerly ran a website targeting individuals and groups involved in the online pedophile activist community. The site&#x27;s stated objective was to &quot;house our voluminous research regarding the identities and pursuits of those in the pedophile activist community&quot;. It listed a number of arrests of pedophile activists that it stated were based on its profiles.

They have also built a list of &quot;corporate sexual offenders&quot;, which they define as &quot;[a]ny company who is informed of pedophiles using their service to advocate the lifestyle of child/adult rape which then does not remove the pedophiles from their service&quot;, with corresponding lists of pedophiles who make use of the services.

Perverted-Justice volunteers also worked to match up MySpace profiles with convicted sex offenders from state registries and alert MySpace officials to their presence. They say they have identified almost three thousand such profiles, most of which have been deleted.

==Reception==
===Commendation===
Perverted-Justice, as well as its volunteers, have been commended over the years by a number of individuals and organizations, including many active-duty law enforcement officials and child-safety advocates.

*The March 2007 issue of &quot;Law Enforcement Technology&quot; magazine covered Perverted-Justice.com and their operations with law enforcement. &quot;We have 2,000 sworn officers, and there is no way we have the resources to do what Perverted Justice did for the NBC Dateline sting (where 51 offenders were arrested in three days),&quot; says Lt. Chad Bianco of the Riverside County (California) Sheriff&#x27;s Department. &quot;They had 45 people working around the clock.&quot; 
*Those praising the site include the host of &quot;America&#x27;s Most Wanted&quot;, John Walsh. He has said: &quot;Well, I think it&#x27;s great. ... My hat is off to Chris Hansen, to NBC, to the people at Perverted-Justice for showing the American public repeatedly that the creep who preys upon our children could live next door. And he could be a rabbi, a school teacher or a priest or anybody. ... I think they&#x27;ve done a great job. Now that they&#x27;ve partners with law enforcement and they&#x27;re putting these guys away, I think they&#x27;ve provided a tremendous educational tool to the American public.&quot;
*Child-safety advocate Marc Klaas has come out publicly in support of Perverted-Justice and the work they do, suggesting that they go from city to city with their efforts. &quot;I think if you were to take this &#x27;Dateline&#x27; piece and turn it into a regular program, where Perverted-Justice and Chris Hansen or somebody else were to go from city to city to city on a weekly basis, you would create a real deterrent effect that would put some fear into the minds of these perverts.&quot;
*Child-safety advocate Ross Ellis, founder and executive director of Love Our Children USA, sent out a press release praising the efforts of Perverted-Justice, while sending a plaque to the organization. &quot;We owe it to our children to keep them safe. The work that Chris Hansen, Dateline and Perverted Justice are doing should be a wake up call to every parent—because no child is immune from these predators. We are proud to present them with awards and express our gratitude for the courageous work they have done on behalf of children.&quot;
*Internet safety website ChildSeekNetwork set up a webpage praising Perverted-Justice. &quot;The Child Seek Network has come under fire by a Texas Organization because of our link to Perverted-Justice web site. It is our belief that children&#x27;s safety is of the utmost importance. Peej works very hard to see that children are safe on the internet from online predators. Although some of their methods seem harsh or controversial they get results, and have aided the police in getting convictions on those who prey on minors. Every child has a right to be protected and feel safe, we will continue our efforts and applaud Peej for the work they do to assist in that goal.&quot;
*A letter was sent from the office of Senator Orrin Hatch (R-UT) to Perverted-Justice praising their efforts, especially in regards to getting the Adam Walsh Child Protection and Safety Act passed. &quot;The Efforts of Perverted-Justice.com deserve a very special &#x27;Thank you&#x27; from everyone interested in stopping the seduction and sexual attack on our children. NBC&#x27;s Dateline has highlighted your efforts at catching sexual predators, using the internet to hunt the hunters. I believe these shows have directly impacted the timely passage of my bill. So I want to join Senate Majority Leader Bill Frist who acknowledged your efforts from the floor of the United States Senate the day the bill was passed. I want to say &quot;Thank you&quot; for your tireless efforts to stop sexual predators.&quot;

Active-duty law enforcement who have worked with the website on arrests have also gone on record speaking about the organization.

*Detective Mike Burns of the Darke County, Ohio Sheriff&#x27;s Department commented on what Perverted-Justice brought to the table, &quot;It was just a miracle from heaven as far as meeting our needs because we are just struggling so badly to get things going that here it is. Here’s the answers for you.&quot; Sgt. Chad Bianco of the Riverside County Sheriff&#x27;s Department in California said, &quot;We were approached by Perverted-Justice to do this large sting and they told us that &#x27;Dateline&#x27; would be following along. We jumped at the chance.&quot; Police Chief Hilton Daniels of the Fort Myers Police Department wanted his department to learn how to do an online internet predator sting: &quot;We decided &#x27;Well, let&#x27;s get a hold of Perverted-Justice&#x27; and have them teach us how to do this operation.&quot;
*Officer Kevin Pineda of Flagler Beach, Florida was tasked by his department with researching Perverted-Justice prior to using their services. Although the department &quot;was a little wary at first&quot;, Officer Pineda indicates that his research revealed &quot;[nothing but] overwhelming joy from other departments that have actually utilized their services.&quot;
*The Laguna Beach Police Department gave Perverted-Justice administrators Del Harvey and Dennis Kerr an award for the sting they performed in their city.
*Speaking on the possibility of more sting operations, Lt. Matthew Stapleton of the Petaluma, California Police Department said: &quot;[I]f we have the resources in the future, absolutely, we might do one. ... I don&#x27;t think we would do a Dateline sting again, but we established a partnership with Perverted Justice, so they could help us, if necessary.&quot; He also commented, &quot;Perverted Justice did everything, as promised. They were a perfect partner.&quot;

===Criticism===
Perverted-Justice and its volunteers have been criticized over the years by several individuals and organizations. Individuals opposing Perverted Justice see it as an organization that encourages extrajudicial violence and harassment against individuals who have not yet been convicted of any crime in the legal system. Also, NBC journalist Stone Phillips from a Perverted Justice related event conceded that, &quot;in many cases, the decoy is the first to bring up the subject of sex&quot;, leading to claims of illegal entrapment by the targets of Perverted Justices actions.

*One criticism of the site, made before Perverted-Justice began working primarily with law enforcement, was leveled by Tina Schwartz, National Center for Missing &amp; Exploited Children (NCMEC) director of communications. She said: &quot;It&#x27;s really not the safest, most effective way to combat this problem ... From what I&#x27;ve seen ... they embarrass the people, but I don&#x27;t know that complete justice is ever served&quot;.
*Scott Morrow ran &quot;Corrupted-Justice.com&quot;, a now-defunct Canadian-based web site that was critical of Perverted-Justice. Morrow told ABC News in 2005 that, in his opinion, there is currently no way to hold Von Erck or any other administrators, operators, or volunteers at Perverted-Justice accountable for mistakes. &quot;When you&#x27;re running an organization or running a group of people with the potential to do as much damage to people&#x27;s lives as this does, I think there also has to be some accountability.&quot; Morrow suggests many of Perverted-Justice&#x27;s tactics are harassment &quot;designed to destroy a person&#x27;s life.&quot; He points out that even sex offender registries don&#x27;t &quot;list the names and background information of neighbors, employers and family members of the accused&quot;, as the Perverted-Justice website does. Perverted-Justice members are encouraged to spread information about their targets on internal forums and to contact their targets&#x27; families, employers, and neighbors.
*In an October 2007 preliminary hearing for the case of Maurice Wolin, Wolin&#x27;s attorney Blair Berk argued that Perverted Justice&#x27;s founder has a financial incentive to badger suspects. Von Erck testified in the hearing that he is paid an annual salary of $120,000 stemming from Perverted Justice&#x27;s deal with NBC. Said Berk, &quot;Xavier Von Erck had a problem. He had a television show to get on and a fancy cancer doctor to ensnare in his web, and he wouldn&#x27;t let it go.&quot; The prosecutor in the case, Brian Staebell, stated, &quot;The whole business of this preliminary hearing has been an attack on the Petaluma Police Department and Perverted Justice. But every time I go back to the chats and I look at how he was grooming this 13-year-old girl.&quot; After the hearing, Judge Raima Ballinger held Wolin over for trial, ruling that there was sufficient cause to believe Wolin committed the crime.
*Lee Tien, an attorney for the Electronic Frontier Foundation, is quoted as being concerned that the organization could send real predators into hiding. The site&#x27;s operators respond that this is in fact their goal, to have real predators hide away from the places that children go; they liken the site to putting up a Community Watch sign at a local playground, which could be argued to discourage predators from kidnapping children there. Tien also argued that chat transcripts can be easily doctored. In order to bolster credibility, the organization claims it has implemented a number of safeguards to prevent this from happening, including routing all chats through an encrypted proxy server that mirrors the data. However, when pressed to provide the hardware he used to record evidence used in the Dr. Maurice Wolin case, Von Erck refused, claiming that the hard disk drive had &quot;experienced a complete failure&quot;. As of December 2008, Perverted Justice has not produced any of the hardware it alleges to have used in gathering evidence in the Wolin case.
*Before Perverted-Justice began working primarily with law enforcement, child safety advocate Julie Posey described Perverted-Justice&#x27;s tactics as &quot;a gross invasion of privacy.&quot; Posey indicated that she did not feel the methods employed by Perverted-Justice were completely effective. &quot;What it does is embarrass them for the moment... but then they&#x27;ll go and get a different screen name and know to check things out a little more thoroughly next time.&quot; Posey and Perverted-Justice founder Xavier Von Erck appeared on Fox News Channel shortly thereafter, where Posey remarked, &quot;It’s more of an entertainment site, actually. You go there, you click on a link of a picture that takes you to that person’s chat-log and that person has a scale—a sliminess scale as he calls it—and you can rate the pervert from, I think it’s, one to five. To me, that kind of gives a sense of entertainment. Anybody that finds entertainment value in exploiting children, I have a problem with it.&quot;
*Some law enforcement experts have also stated that, while they appreciate the site&#x27;s mission, they do not agree with some of the operators&#x27; and volunteers&#x27; practices. In a December 2004 article in the &quot;New York Sun&quot;, Bradley Russ, the training director for the federal Internet Crimes Against Children Taskforce (which has trained about 200 law enforcement agents nationwide) said that the tactics of Perverted-Justice sometimes run counter to the task force&#x27;s standards. For instance, Russ said, by accepting child pornography from their &quot;busts&quot; to bolster a potential legal case, the volunteers are themselves in possession of unlawful images. He said federal authorities have begun considering whether to seize Perverted-Justice contributors&#x27; computers. &quot;It&#x27;s a noble effort gone too far,&quot; Russ told the newspaper. He also said the site&#x27;s tactics can make it more difficult for law enforcement to prosecute cases they present because those cases can be considered tainted by entrapment claims. According to Russ, &quot;I have a real problem with any citizens&#x27; group conducting any investigation into any crime ... It&#x27;s a mistake for law enforcement to abdicate its responsibility to citizens.&quot; Said Russ, &quot;I think it&#x27;s a huge mistake when law enforcement partners with citizens to do investigations. ... I&#x27;m very concerned about entrapment issues.&quot; Tom Nolan, a Boston University professor and former Boston police officer, echoes Russ&#x27;s criticism, &quot;I have an issue with private citizens engaging in these kinds of investigatory practices. ... Perverted Justice, even though they are in fact acting as agents of law enforcement, are not abiding by the policies. ... This is vigilantism. It&#x27;s sensational vigilantism.&quot;
*Criminal defense attorney Angelyn Gates of Chase Criminal Defense Attorneys raises concern that citizen groups are not subject to the same standards as trained law enforcement officials. She notes that laws are designed to keep police officers from violating citizens&#x27; rights, and that the same rules don&#x27;t apply to citizens who may be violating other citizens&#x27; rights. &quot;Police officers are trained in theory,&quot; Gates said. &quot;[Members of Perverted-Justice] are not watching out for themselves by trying to pretend they&#x27;re a child on the Internet,&quot; she said. &quot;They&#x27;re doing it for the thrill, fun, and notoriety they seem to be getting out of it.&quot; Detective Mike Burns of Darke County asserts that Perverted-Justice sets stricter criteria than many law enforcement agencies do for arrest. He contends that Perverted-Justice subscribes to protocols well within those followed by law enforcement. He does however concede, &quot;Sometimes it was a fine line, but they provided us with 140 people they were chatting with after 10 days with possibilities of showing up for a meeting. There&#x27;s no way a department five times our size could have done that.&quot;
*The site has also been criticized for &quot;disseminating its own brand of child pornography.&quot; Criminal defense attorney Peter D. Greenspun, who represented Rabbi David Kaye (a man convicted after a Perverted-Justice sting operation) argues that the content posted on Perverted-Justice.com could encourage child predators. &quot;They are putting out for unfiltered, unrestricted public consumption the most graphic sexual material that they themselves say is of a perverted nature.&quot; The site&#x27;s operators state that when they or their volunteers are sent child pornography, they &quot;immediately report it to the police and without fail.&quot; Furthermore, they assure that every time this has happened it has resulted in a conviction against the one sending the pornography, not against Perverted-Justice.
*In a Riverside County case, Judge Dallas Holmes commented on the merits of a Perverted-Justice-related case. Said Judge Holmes: &quot;I don&#x27;t like the smell of this case.&quot; Furthermore, he described the Perverted-Justice witness testifying in the case as &quot;odd,&quot; &quot;weird&quot; and &quot;repulsive&quot;. These comments were made after the jury deadlocked 10–2 in favor of acquittal in a case involving U.S. Marine William Lawrence Havey. Linda Dunn, a chief deputy district attorney in Riverside County, said she thought the outcome of the Havey trial had more to do with jurors&#x27; unwillingness to convict a Marine than with negative perceptions of the Perverted Justice witnesses.
*In May 2007, Perverted-Justice was criticized in a now-dismissed employment lawsuit brought by former &quot;Dateline&quot; producer Marsha Bartel. In the filing, Bartel alleges that NBC provides financial incentives to the group to use trickery and to humiliate targets to &quot;enhance the comedic effect of the[ir] public exposure.&quot; According to Bartel, some of the men caught in the &quot;Predator&quot; sting operations have reported that the decoys begged them to come to the sting houses, even after they had decided to walk away. Perverted-Justice responded to the criticism by labeling Bartel a disgruntled former employee motivated by financial gain. The lawsuit was eventually dismissed after the New York Supreme Court ruled that &quot;an employer is free to terminate an employee at any time for any reason or no reason.&quot;
*The father of a man arrested in a July 2006 sting by Perverted-Justice appeared before a Georgia Superior Court judge to seek an arrest warrant for Perverted-Justice founder Xavier Von Erck, stating that Von Erck solicited the commission of a felony from the man. The judge found that probable cause existed to believe Von Erck impersonated a girl and solicited the man with the intent for him to commit a felony, but declined to issue the warrant because when the act occurred, there was no actual girl and thus no crime occurred. The act of soliciting a felony is itself a felony. Attorney Gary Gerrard filed an appeal with the Georgia Court of Appeals, alleging that under Georgia law, solicitation is a felony whether or not a crime occurred. That appeal was ultimately rejected.
*In June 2007, Perverted-Justice was criticized following a sting operation in Collin County, Texas that resulted in the charges against 23 suspected online sex predators being dropped. Collin County Assistant District Attorney Greg Davis said the cases were dropped after Perverted-Justice failed to provide enough usable evidence. &quot;In many cases, we could not prosecute because Perverted Justice refused to answer our questions, refused to participate as witnesses, or refused to turn over potential evidence.&quot; Susan Etheridge, director of the Children&#x27;s Advocacy Center in Plano, Texas, was not surprised the cases were thrown out. She doubts the efficacy of a citizen-based group in conducting such a sting, &quot;I know that law enforcement works very hard to find and prosecute Internet predators. When citizens do it -- I don&#x27;t know whether that can work. Perhaps policing is best left to the police.&quot; Responding to the criticism, members of Perverted-Justice have stated on their website that they were never asked for the relevant evidence, never refused to provide witnesses, and answered all the Murphy Prosecutor&#x27;s questions. They describe the Collin County District Attorney&#x27;s Office as &quot;corrupt&quot;, &quot;inept&quot;, and &quot;incompetent&quot;, while labeling Collin County, Texas DA Greg Davis &quot;the biggest liar we&#x27;ve ever dealt with in our lives.&quot;
*On January 10, 2008, a multi-count &quot;pro se&quot; (self-represented) civil lawsuit was filed in the District Court of Arizona by Jan Kruska seeking a change in current sex offender laws. Kruska is suing the group and a number of others, including Myspace and Go Daddy, claiming defamation, cyber-stalking and cyber-harassment after she was added to the now defunct Wikisposure site. Kruska&#x27;s claims against Perverted-Justice were dismissed on August 9, 2010.

==Notable incidents==
According to Von Erck, Bruce Raisley, a private pilot and software developer made graphic violent threats against Perverted-Justice contributors and volunteers, and threatened to expose the online identities they used when posing as children. Raisley stated that he was a former Perverted-Justice member who left the group after he discovered that Perverted-Justice used a photograph of his son in a Perverted-Justice decoy profile, and failed to get a swift response from law enforcement. Allegations were made that Von Erck had &quot;set out to destroy [Raisley] by posing as a woman, seducing him online with graphic sex chats, posting the transcripts on the web, and threatening to release a purported video of the individual masturbating.&quot; Raisley was lured to an airport waiting area, where he was secretly photographed by associates of Von Erck. The photos were later posted online along with a warning against further threats and attacks. In 2010, Raisley was convicted of orchestrating a DDoS attack against sites carrying the story. Raisley was sentenced to two years in prison and ordered to pay $90,383 in restitution for the attacks.

==Cessation of operations and final mission==
In late 2018, the official site announced that they would end active decoy operations at the start of 2019. In addition to formally ending the chat room decoy operations that they were well known for, Perverted-Justice founder Xavier Von Erck announced that the organization would be suspending all active operations in 2019. The Perverted-Justice website is no longer functional as of June 2024 in terms of viewing predators&#x27; chatlogs.

<doc id="841918" wikidata="Q6462700" url="?curid=841918" title="La Gaceta (Tampa)">
<text>La Gaceta is a weekly newspaper in Tampa, Florida, founded in 1922. Published in English, Spanish, and Italian, it is the only trilingual newspaper in the United States.

The paper was founded by Victoriano Manteiga, a former &quot;lector&quot; in the cigar factories of West Tampa and Ybor City, to serve the needs of the immigrant population of Tampa.

Later, his son Roland Manteiga took over as editor and publisher. Roland was very well connected, and his column &quot;As We Heard It&quot;, became the local mid-20th century version of today&#x27;s political blogs, often breaking stories and predicting events before the area&#x27;s &quot;major&quot; newspapers.

Today, &quot;La Gaceta&quot; is still published weekly under the direction of Roland&#x27;s son, Patrick Manteiga, who has assumed authorship of the &quot;As We Heard It&quot; column. Additional editors are Manuela Ball (Spanish Section) and Giuseppe Maniscalco (Italian Section). Other columnists include Arturo Rivera, Joe O&#x27;Neill, Richard Muga, Emily Carney, Paul Guzzo, Leonardo Venta, Harvey Grajales, Gene Siudut, Kyle Dion and Travis Puterbaugh.

<doc id="841919" wikidata="Q889997" url="?curid=841919" title="High King of Ireland">
<text>High King of Ireland ( ) was a royal title in Gaelic Ireland held by those who had, or who are claimed to have had, lordship over all of Ireland. The title was held by historical kings and was later sometimes assigned anachronously or to legendary figures. 

Medieval and early modern Irish literature portrays an almost unbroken line of High Kings, ruling from the Hill of Tara over a hierarchy of lesser kings, stretching back thousands of years. Modern historians believe this scheme was crafted in the 8th century from the various genealogical traditions of powerful dynasties, and intended to justify their status by projecting it far into the past. John T. Koch explains: &quot;Although the kingship of Tara was a special kingship whose occupants had aspirations towards supremacy among the kings of Ireland, in political terms it is unlikely that any king had sufficient authority to dominate the whole island before the 9th century&quot;.

The concept of national kingship is first articulated in the 7th century, but only became a political reality in the Viking Age, and even then not a consistent one. While the High Kings&#x27; degree of control varied, they never ruled Ireland as a politically unified state, as the High King was conceived of as an overlord exercising suzerainty over, and receiving tribute from, the independent kingdoms beneath him.

==Sacred High Kings==

Early Irish kingship was sacred in character. In some early Irish sources, High Kings can gain their power through a marriage to, or sexual relationship with, a sovereignty goddess. The High King is free from blemish, enforces symbolic &quot;buada&quot; (prerogatives) and avoids symbolic &quot;geasa&quot; (taboos).

According to 7th- and 8th-century law tracts, a hierarchy of kingship and clientship progressed from the &quot;rí tuaithe&quot; (king of a single petty kingdom) through the &quot;ruiri&quot; (a &quot;rí&quot; who was overking of several petty kingdoms) to a &quot;rí ruirech&quot; (a &quot;rí&quot; who was a provincial overking). (See Rí.)

Each king ruled directly only within the bounds of his own petty kingdom and was responsible for ensuring good government by exercising &quot;fír flaithemon&quot; (rulers&#x27; truth). His responsibilities included convening its &quot;óenach&quot; (popular assembly), collecting taxes, building public works, external relations, defence, emergency legislation, law enforcement, and promulgating legal judgment.

The lands in a petty kingdom were held allodially by various &quot;fine&quot; (agnatic kingroups) of freemen. The king occupied the apex of a pyramid of clientship within the petty kingdom. This pyramid progressed from the unfree population at its base up to the heads of noble &quot;fine&quot; held in immediate clientship by the king. Thus the king was drawn from the dominant &quot;fine&quot; within the &quot;cenél&quot; (a wider kingroup encompassing the noble &quot;fine&quot; of the petty kingdom).

The kings of the Ulster Cycle are kings in this sacred sense, but it is clear that the old concept of kingship coexisted alongside Christianity for several generations. Diarmait mac Cerbaill, king of Tara in the middle of the 6th century, may have been the last king to have &quot;married&quot; the land. Diarmait died at the hands of Áed Dub mac Suibni; some accounts from the following century state that he died by the mythic Threefold death appropriate to a sacral king. Adomnán&#x27;s &quot;Life&quot; tells how Saint Columba forecast the same death for Áed Dub. The same Threefold Death is said in a late poem to have befallen Diarmait&#x27;s predecessor, Muirchertach macc Ercae, and even the usually reliable Annals of Ulster record Muirchertach&#x27;s death by drowning in a vat of wine.

A second sign that sacred kingship did not disappear with the arrival of Christianity is the supposed lawsuit between Congal Cáech, king of the Ulaid, and Domnall mac Áedo. Congal was supposedly blinded in one eye by Domnall&#x27;s bees, from whence his byname Cáech (half-blind or squinting), this injury rendering him imperfect and unable to remain High King. The enmity between Domnall and Congal can more prosaically be laid at the door of the rivalry between the Uí Néill and the kings of Ulaid, but that a king had to be whole in body appears to have been accepted at this time.

==Succession order==
The business of Irish succession is rather complicated because of the nature of kingship in Ireland before the Norman take-over of 1171. Ireland was divided into a multiplicity of kingdoms, with some kings owing allegiance to others from time to time, and succession rules (insofar as they existed) varied. Kings were often succeeded by their sons, but often other branches of the dynasty took a turn—whether by agreement or by force of arms is rarely clear. According to Bart Jaski, &quot;historians who have ventured to...discover the rules of succession have disagreed with each other to a remarkable degree.&quot; The king-lists and other early sources reveal little about how and why a particular person became king.

To add to the uncertainty, genealogies were often edited many generations later to improve an ancestor&#x27;s standing within a kingdom, or to insert him into a more powerful kindred. The uncertain practices in local kingship cause similar problems when interpreting the succession to the high kingship.

The High King of Ireland was essentially a ceremonial, pseudo-federal overlord (where his over-lordship was even recognised), who exercised actual power only within the realm of which he was actually king. In the case of the southern branch of the Uí Néill, this would have been the Kingdom of Meath (now the counties of Meath, Westmeath and part of County Dublin). High Kings from the northern branch ruled various kingdoms in what eventually became the province of Ulster.

In 1002, the high kingship of Ireland was wrested from Mael Sechnaill II of the southern Uí Néill by Brian &quot;Boruma&quot; mac Cennédig of the Kingdom of Munster. Some historians have called this a &quot;usurpation&quot; of the throne. Others have pointed out that no one had a strict legal right to the kingship and that Brian &quot;had as much right to the high throne as any Uí Neill and... displayed an ability sadly lacking amongst most of the Uí Néill who had preceded him.&quot;

Brian was killed in the Battle of Clontarf in 1014. Mael Sechnaill II was restored to the High Kingship but he died in 1022. From 1022 through the Norman take-over of 1171, the High Kingship was held alongside &quot;Kings with Opposition&quot;.

==Early Christian High Kings==
Even at the time the law tracts were being written, these petty kingdoms were being swept away by newly emerging dynasties of dynamic overkings. The most successful of these early dynasties were the Uí Néill (encompassing descendants of Niall of the Nine Hostages, such as the Cenél nEógain), who, as kings of Tara, had been conquering petty kingdoms, expelling their rulers, and agglomerating their territories under the direct rule of their expanding kindred since the fifth century.

Gaelic and foreign, pagan and Christian ideas were comingled to form a new idea of Irish kingship. The native idea of a sacred kingship was integrated with the Christian idea in the ceremony of coronation, the relationship of king to overking became one of &quot;tigerna&quot; (lord) to king and &quot;imperium&quot; (sovereignty) began to merge with &quot;dominium&quot; (ownership).

The Church was well disposed to the idea of a strong political authority. Its clerics developed the theory of a high kingship of Ireland and wrote tracts exhorting kings to rule rather than reign. In return, the &quot;paruchiae&quot; (monastic federations) of the Irish church received royal patronage in the form of shrines, building works, land, and protection.

The concept of a high king was occasionally recorded in various annals, such as an entry regarding the death of Máel Sechnaill mac Máele Ruanaid in 862 in the Annals of Ulster, which lists him as
&quot;rí Érenn uile&quot; (king of all Ireland), a title which his successor Aed Finliath apparently never was granted. It is unclear what political reality was behind this title.

==Later High Kings==
By the twelfth century, the dual process of agglomeration of territory and consolidation of kingship saw the handful of remaining provincial kings abandoning the traditional royal sites for the cities, employing ministers and governors, receiving advice from an &quot;oireacht&quot; (a body of noble counsellors), presiding at reforming synods, and maintaining standing armies.

Early royal succession had been by alternation between collateral branches of the wider dynasty, but succession was now confined to a series of father/son, brother/brother and uncle/nephew successions within a small royal &quot;fine&quot; marked by an exclusive surname.

These compact families (the Uí Briain of Munster, the Meic Lochlainn of the North, the Uí Conchubhair of Connacht) intermarried and competed against each other on a national basis so that on the eve of the Anglo-Norman incursion of 1169 the agglomeration/consolidation process was complete and their provincial kingdoms divided, dismembered and transformed into fiefdoms held from (or in rebellion against) one of their number acting as king of Ireland.

<text>Vijay Amritraj (; born 14 December 1953) is an Indian sports commentator, actor and retired professional tennis player from Madras. He was awarded the Padma Shri, the government of India&#x27;s fourth-highest civilian honour, in 1983. In 2022, he was honored for his contributions to tennis in London by the International Tennis Hall of Fame and International Tennis Federation.

==Early life==
Vijay was born in Madras, India to Maggie Dhairyam and Robert Amritraj. He has two brothers, Anand Amritraj and Ashok Amritraj, who were also international tennis players.

==Career==
After playing his first Grand Prix event in 1970, Amritraj achieved his first success in singles in 1973 when he reached the quarterfinals at two Grand Slam events. At Wimbledon, he lost in five sets to the eventual champion Jan Kodeš and later that summer at the US Open, lost to Ken Rosewall after having beaten Rod Laver two rounds earlier.

Amritraj beat Björn Borg in the second round in the US Open in 1974, losing to Rosewall in quarterfinals. In 1979, he lost in the second round of Wimbledon to defending champion Borg after being up two sets to one and leading 4–1 in the fourth set. He reached his career-high ranking in singles of world No. 16 in July 1980. In 1981, he reached the quarterfinals of Wimbledon before losing in five sets to Jimmy Connors. He beat John McEnroe in the first round of Cincinnati Masters in 1984. Overall, he had five career wins over Jimmy Connors in their eleven matches.

<doc id="841931" wikidata="Q288198" url="?curid=841931" title="Barbara Hambly">
<text>Barbara Hambly (born August 28, 1951) is an American novelist and screenwriter within the genres of fantasy, science fiction, mystery, and historical fiction.

She is the author of the bestselling Benjamin January mystery series featuring a free man of color, a musician and physician, in New Orleans in the antebellum years. She also wrote a novel about Mary Todd Lincoln.

Her science fiction novels occur within an explicit multiverse, as well as within previously existing settings (notably as established by &quot;Star Trek&quot; and &quot;Star Wars&quot;).

==Early life and education==
Hambly was born in San Diego, California and grew up in Montclair, California. Her parents, Everett Edward Hambly Jr. and Florence Elizabeth (Moraski) Hambly, are from Fall River, Massachusetts; and Scranton, Pennsylvania (respectively). She has an older sister, Mary Ann Sanders, and a younger brother, Everett Edward Hambly, III. In her early teens, after reading J. R. R. Tolkien&#x27;s &quot;The Lord of the Rings&quot;, she affixed images of dragons to her bedroom door. She became interested in costumery from an early age, and has been a long-time participant in Society for Creative Anachronism activities. In the mid-1960s, the Hambly family spent a year in Australia.

Hambly has a Master&#x27;s in Medieval History from the University of California, Riverside. She completed her degree in 1975 and spent a year in Bordeaux as part of her studies.

==Career==
She chose work that allowed her time to write; all of her novels contain a biography paragraph with a litany of jobs: high school teacher, model, waitress, technical editor, all-night liquor store clerk, and Shotokan karate instructor. Her first published novel was &quot;The Time of the Dark&quot; (1982).

Hambly served as President of the Science Fiction and Fantasy Writers of America from 1994 to 1996. Her works have been nominated for many awards in the fantasy and horror fiction categories, winning a Locus Award for Best Horror Novel &quot;Those Who Hunt the Night&quot; (1989) (released in the UK as &quot;Immortal Blood&quot;) and the Lord Ruthven Award for fiction for its sequel, &quot;Traveling with the Dead&quot; (1996).

==Marriage and personal life==
Hambly was married for some years to George Alec Effinger, a science fiction writer. He died in 2002. She lives in Los Angeles. Hambly speaks freely of suffering from seasonal affective disorder, which was undiagnosed for some time.

==Themes within fantasy==
Hambly&#x27;s work has several themes. She has a penchant for unusual characters within the fantasy genre, such as the menopausal witch and reluctant scholar-lord in the &quot;Winterlands&quot; trilogy, or the philologist secret service agent in the vampire novels.

Her writing is filled with rich descriptions and characters whose actions bear consequences for both their lives and relationships, suffusing her series with a sense of loss and regret. Hambly&#x27;s characters suffer the pain of frustrated aspirations to a degree that is uncommon in most fantasy novels.

Though using many standard clichés and plot devices of the fantasy genre, her works explore the ethical implications of the consequences of these devices, and what their effect is for the characters, were they real people. In avoiding the &quot;...easy consolatory self-identification of genre fantasy&quot; (p. 449) and refusing to let her work be guided more explicitly by conventions and the desires of her audience, Hambly may have missed out on more remunerative success and acclaim.

Although magic exists in many of her settings, it is not used as an easy solution but follows rules and takes energy from the wizards. The unusual settings are generally rationalized as alternative universes.

Hambly heavily researches her settings, either in person or through books, frequently drawing upon her degree in medieval history for background and depth.

===Benjamin January mysteries===
This historical mystery series begins with &quot;A Free Man of Color&quot; (1997) and features Benjamin January, a brilliant, classically educated, free colored surgeon and musician living in New Orleans during the antebellum years of the 1830s. At the time, New Orleans had a large and prosperous population of free people of color. Born a slave, as his mother was enslaved, January was freed as a young child by his mother&#x27;s lover, under the plaçage system. Provided with an excellent education, he gained fluency in several classical and modern languages, and was thoroughly versed in the whole of classical Western learning and arts. He studied medicine in Paris, where he trained as a surgeon. He returned to Louisiana to escape the memory of his late wife, a woman from North Africa. As a free black in Louisiana, he cannot find work as a surgeon. He earns a modest living by his exceptional talent as a musician.

<text>The European Democratic Party (EDP; French: &quot;Parti démocrate européen&quot;, PDE), also known as the European Democrats, is a centrist European political party in favour of European integration. 
Within the European Parliament, its MEPs form the Renew Europe group, together with those of the Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe party and the French Renaissance party. The President is François Bayrou.

The youth wing of the EDP is the Young Democrats for Europe (YDE).

As of 2025, EDP members participate in the national government of three EU member states: EDP President François Bayrou leading the government in France, Les Engagés in Belgium, which participates in the government of Prime Minister Bart De Wever and, EDP individual member Marian Harkin, who participates in the government of Prime Minister Micheál Martin. Two European regions are also led by an EDP politician, with Spain&#x27;s Basque Country being led by Imanol Pradales of the Basque Nationalist Party and with Spain&#x27;s Canary Islands being led by Fernando Clavijo Batlle of the Canarian Coalition; EDP member Free Voters participates as a junior coalition partner in the state government of Bavaria in Germany, as does Italia Viva in Emilia-Romagna, Tuscany, Campania and Basilicata and Les Engagés in Wallonia and the Wallonia-Brussels Federation.

The European Democratic Party is also a member of the European Movement International and was a member of the World Alliance of Democrats until its dissolution in 2012.

== History ==
European Democratic Party was initiated on 16 April 2004 and formally founded on 9 December 2004 in Brussels.

In 2005, the European Democratic Party, together with the United States Democratic Party and the Council of Asian Liberals and Democrats, co-founded the Alliance of Democrats international.

François Bayrou of the Union for French Democracy and later the Democratic Movement (MoDem) and Francesco Rutelli, former leader of the Democracy is Freedom and Alliance for Italy parties, served as the two co-presidents until 2019. Now, François Bayrou serves as the only president.

The EDP was founded in reaction to the rising influence of Eurosceptic parties within European institutions. It drew pro-European centrist parties from the European People&#x27;s Party (EPP) group to form a new centrist multinational bloc. Its co-founder François Bayrou described it as a party for people being &quot;neither conservative nor socialist.&quot; &quot;

Since the beginning of the 6th European Parliament of 2004–2009, the EDP has formed a joint European parliamentary group with the Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe Party called the Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe (ALDE) group. This parliamentary group was renamed in 2019 as Renew Europe.

The European Democratic Party is ideologically centrist and federalist. Some major members and affiliated parties like EAJ-PNV, Free Voters, MoDem, MCC, Canarian Coalition and the disbanded Democracy is Freedom – The Daisy follow a Christian democratic or liberal conservative line.

At its 20th anniversary congress in Brussels in December 2024, the party adopted a new orange brand identity and logo, taking on the short name ‘Democrats’.

==Membership==
Members are national and regional political parties as well as members of the European Parliament, national and regional parliaments.

<doc id="841936" wikidata="Q1815066" url="?curid=841936" title="Leighton Rees">
<text>Leighton Thomas Rees (17 January 1940 – 8 June 2003) was a Welsh professional darts player. He was the first BDO World Professional Darts Champion, having won the inaugural 1978 BDO World Darts Championship, and was a former World No. 1 player. He was one of the sport&#x27;s most successful players throughout the 1970s, and retired from the game in 1991.

==Early life==
Rees was born in hospital in Mountain Ash and grew up in the village of Ynysybwl, Glamorgan, where he spent most of his life. He attended the local Mill Street School in Pontypridd where one of his teachers famously declared on his report card that he would be &quot;good only for reading the sports pages of the South Wales Echo&quot;. After leaving school he found work in the store room of a motor spares company, a job he did for over twenty years until he became a professional darts player in 1976.

It was during his time working as a store man that Leighton found the sport of darts, becoming a regular for his local pub and county, and playing for Wales in 1970. It was not until 1972 though that he gained any real national attention. Sid Waddell, who later became a commentator for the BBC and Sky Sports, was at the time producer of Yorkshire Television&#x27;s &quot;The Indoor League&quot; – a show with pub games tournaments. Waddell and his researchers had heard reports of a trio of great darts players in the South Wales valleys, an area that was quickly becoming a hotbed of talent for the sport. Waddell had already seen Alan Evans of Rhondda play at the Alexandra Palace during the 1972 News of the World Championship, the first darts tournament televised across Britain. The other two names mentioned were Tony Ridler of Newport and Leighton Rees of Ynysybwl.

Waddell quickly offered all three the chance to play on &quot;The Indoor League&quot;, which started being televised across Britain from 1973, and they did not disappoint, Ridler and Evans both scored a number of 180s in their matches, but although he did not perform as well in 1973, it was Leighton Rees who stole the show. Over a lager and a cigar he told presenter Fred Trueman, in his soon to be famous brand of dry humour, stories about himself and Evans hustling the English. Rees went on to have the most success of any darts player in &quot;The Indoor League&quot;, becoming the only player to win the darts tournament twice.

==Darts career==
After twice winning the darts tournament on &quot;The Indoor League&quot; in 1974 and 1976, Rees turned professional in 1976 and reached the final of that year&#x27;s News of the World Darts Championship, losing to Bill Lennard from Manchester. Rees was also part of the 1977 Wales team that won the first World Darts Federation World Cup alongside Alan Evans and David &quot;Rocky&quot; Jones. 

Rees&#x27; finest hour however would come in 1978 at the inaugural Embassy World Professional Darts Championship, in Nottingham. Seeded third he easily dispensed with Australian Barry Atkinson in round one at a score of 6–0 before taking on his close friend, Welsh team-mate and fifth seed Alan Evans in the second round. It turned into a classic with both players averaging over 90 per three darts (almost unheard of in those days). Evans took an early lead with a couple of 180s before Rees recorded the championship&#x27;s first ten-dart finish (also the first televised) before eventually running out a 6–3 victor. At the time the BBC&#x27;s executive producer Nick Hunter proclaimed it as the match that made darts live up to all their expectations and cemented it as a National TV item for years to come.

In the semi-final Rees actually struggled to beat a determined American, Nicky Virachkul 8–7 in the semi-finals but showed a whole different set of battling qualities to pull through into a final against his close friend John Lowe. Rees would again average over 90 with Lowe not far behind in a final that was won 11–7 by Rees, achieving his only World Championship title.

In the defence of his title in 1979, Rees returned to the final, again beating Evans along the way before this time losing to Lowe by 5 sets to 0. A quarter-final in 1980 and a last-16 place in 1981 followed, after which Rees could only manage round one exits in 1982, 1983, 1985 and 1990. Despite this his matches nearly always resulted in full arenas and he remained one of darts most popular competitors.

It is because of this that he is credited alongside the likes of Lowe, Eric Bristow, Bob Anderson, Jocky Wilson, Cliff Lazarenko and now Phil Taylor as bringing darts to the masses via the television screens. He had a good record on &quot;Bullseye&quot;, scoring more than 301 with nine darts on at least six appearances in eight and thus having his charity money doubled.

Rees also wrote an autobiographical account of his life in 1979, titled &quot;On Darts&quot;, which included tips on playing the game.

==Personal life==
In 1980, Rees married Debbie Ryle, a Californian, in Las Vegas while he was competing in a tournament there. Eric Bristow was best man. Despite being the first world champion, it could be argued that Rees missed out on darts&#x27; glory years. The prize for his title was £3,000 and as the prize money rose and tournaments began to spring up all over UK television channels, Rees&#x27; form began to slide and by the 1980s he never managed to match the continued success of Lowe, Bristow and Wilson. Rees was forced to make his living from playing exhibition matches with his compatriot and great friend Alan Evans.

==Death==
Rees quit his exhibition work after having a pacemaker fitted and also had a heart bypass operation in his later life. He returned to the stage of the World Championships to make the draw for the event in the year before his death. He died in his home village, Ynysybwl, in 2003, aged 63. Leighton Rees Close in Ynysybwl is named after him.

<doc id="841941" wikidata="Q7345005" url="?curid=841941" title="Robert Hughes (Conservative politician)">
<text>Robert Gurth Hughes (born 14 July 1951) is a British Conservative Party politician, who was a Government Minister in the 1990s.

==Parliamentary career==
Hughes was unsuccessful as a candidate for Stepney and Poplar in the 1979 general election. In 1980 Hughes was elected to the Greater London Council representing Croydon Central, serving until 1986. He was the Conservative candidate in the 1983 Bermondsey by-election and contested that constituency&#x27;s successor seat of Southwark and Bermondsey at the 1983 general election.

In 1987 he was elected as the Member of Parliament (MP) for Harrow West. He successfully defended his seat at the 1992 election but at the 1997 election his 18,000 majority swung to a Labour majority of 1,240 votes for Gareth Thomas. Hughes&#x27; Parliamentary Aide in the Commons until May 1997 was fellow Harrow politician, Councillor Mark Versallion.

He served as a Government Whip in 1993 when the Maastricht bill went through the House, and was promoted to Parliamentary Under Secretary of State at the Office of Public Service and Science in the Cabinet Office in 1994 with responsibility for the Science Research Councils and the Medical Research Council.

On 6 March 1995, Hughes resigned as Minister responsible for the Citizen&#x27;s Charter over an affair with a constituency worker who had come to him for help from an abusive relationship. Hughes confessed the affair and resigned when he believed that the liaison was about to be exposed in a Sunday newspaper.

He opposed the Conservative party line in 1996 by supporting a total ban on handguns in the wake of the Dunblane Massacre. Robert Hughes is a keen supporter of Land value tax to eliminate income and sales taxes.

== Post-political career ==

Upon leaving the Commons he became General Secretary and then Executive Director of the optical trade body, the Federation of Ophthalmic &amp; Dispensing Opticians. He became the Chief Executive of the Association of Optometrists (AOP) in 2004. In 2011 he left AOP to become the Chief Executive of the Surrey Association for Visual Impairment. As of 2017 he is now the Chairman of the Guildford Conservative Association.

In May 2021 he was elected as a Conservative county councillor for Shere in the Surrey County Council election.

<text>In deliberative bodies, a second to a proposed motion is an indication that there is at least one person besides the mover that is interested in seeing the motion come before the meeting. It does not necessarily indicate that the seconder favors the motion.

==Purpose==
The purpose of requiring a second is to prevent time being wasted by the assembly&#x27;s having to dispose of a motion that only one person wants to see introduced. Hearing a second to a motion is guidance to the chair that they should state the question on the motion, thereby placing it before the assembly. It does not necessarily indicate that the seconder favors the motion.

==Procedure==
The seconder may state &quot;I second the motion&quot; or &quot;second&quot; without first being recognized by the chair. They may remain seated but in larger assemblies, except in those where nonmembers may be seated in the hall, the seconder should stand. After hearing a second, the chair then states the question and the motion is placed before the assembly for discussion.

===When no second is made===
After a motion is proposed, if the motion requires a second and none is immediately offered, the chair of the body will usually ask, &quot;Is there a second?&quot; If no second is obtained within a few moments of proposing the motion, then the motion is not considered by the assembly, and is treated as though it was never offered. Such a motion may be introduced again at any later time.

If a motion which requires a second does not receive one, but is discussed or voted on anyway, it is too late to object to the motion on the grounds that a second was not offered. This is because the purpose of the second has been fulfilled: the assembly is obviously willing to consider the motion.

A point of order that a motion is not in order for lack of a second can only be made before any discussion or vote has taken place on the motion.

===When a second is not necessary===
*in a small board or a committee.
*for motions made by direction of a board or appointed committee.
*once debate has begun on a motion.
*for certain procedural motions.

===Withdrawal of a second===
A second may be withdrawn if the motion is amended by the maker of the motion before it has been stated by the chair. &quot;Demeter&#x27;s Manual&quot; states, &quot;The seconder can also withdraw his second after the Chair has stated the question and before it is voted on, if the body permits it either by silent consent, or by majority vote if put to a formal vote.&quot;

==Parliamentary authorities that discourage seconds==
*Ray Keesey states, &quot;Motions need not be seconded. The requirement of a second is largely a waste of time. What member is so destitute of friends that he can&#x27;t find one willing to second his motion? The traditional justification for requiring a second is that at least two members would support a motion to justify its consideration. ... There is nothing essentially wrong with the practice of seconding. It is simply unnecessary.
*&quot;Tilson&#x27;s Manual&quot; advises against the use of seconds, stating, &quot;It would seem that nothing could be more nearly useless and unnecessary than for some identified voice from the midst of the assembly to boom out, &#x27;I second it&#x27;.&quot;
*&quot;Mason&#x27;s Manual&quot; states that &quot;Parliamentary practice in American governmental bodies does not require seconds to motions, and in Parliament itself, where the practice of seconding motions originated, they have not been required for more than a century.&quot;

==Legislative bodies==
===United States===
While Jefferson&#x27;s &quot;Manual&quot;, which is an authority still used in the US House of Representatives, requires a Second, the House has, by precedent and Standing orders, entirely dispensed with the use of Seconds.

===Australia===
====Federal Parliament====
Seconds are still required in the Australian House of Representatives for motions moved by private members. On the basis that a Minister is assumed to have the backing of the Government, Motions moved by a Minister and, in certain circumstances, the Chief Government Whip, do not require a seconder. Seconds are called for in some special cases, even when moved by a minister, for example condolence motions, when traditionally the Leader of the Opposition will second the motion. Seconds are not used in the Australian Senate however.
====State Parliaments====
Seconds are not required in either house of the Parliament of New South Wales nor in the unicameral Legislative Assembly of the Australian Capital Territory.

In the unicameral parliament of Queensland a seconder is not required in most cases. A seconder is required for any motion or amendment to an Address to the Governor, election of the 
Speaker or condolence. 

====Local Government====
In contrast to the practice in the State Parliament, the Model Code of Meeting Practice for Local Government in New South Wales requires that motions be seconded.

In Queensland the Best Practice Standing Orders for Local Government requires a second for all motions. However, in contrast to NSW, these Standing Orders are not binding on Councils, which may modify them.

==Common Law==
An early document attesting to the need for a second is Scobell&#x27;s &quot;Memorials etc&quot;, which was referenced by Jefferson in his Manual. However the importance of a Second is not clear in Scobell&#x27;s work, and in any event it has been progressively overturned by legislatures since the 19th Century.

It has been held judicially that the Common Law does not demand a Second, except when the &quot;custom and practice&quot; of the organisation requires it. Although a contrary opinion has also been stated.

<doc id="841947" wikidata="Q1809982" url="?curid=841947" title="Mentioned in dispatches">
<text>To be mentioned in dispatches (or despatches, MiD) describes a member of the armed forces whose name appears in an official report written by a superior officer and sent to the high command, in which their gallant or meritorious action in the face of the enemy is described.

In some countries, a service member&#x27;s name must be mentioned in dispatches as a condition for receiving certain decorations.

== United Kingdom, British Empire and Commonwealth of Nations ==
=== United Kingdom ===
Servicemen and women of the United Kingdom or the Commonwealth who are mentioned in despatches are not awarded a medal for their actions, but receive a certificate and wear an oak leaf device on the ribbon of the appropriate campaign medal. A smaller version of the oak leaf device is attached to the ribbon when worn alone. 

Prior to 2014, only one device could be worn on a ribbon, irrespective of the number of times the recipient was mentioned in despatches. Where no campaign medal is awarded, the oak leaf is worn directly on the coat after any medal ribbons. In the British Armed Forces, the despatch is published in the &quot;London Gazette&quot;.

Prior to 1914, no decoration existed to signify a mention in despatches, although sometimes a medal for gallantry could be awarded in its place.

For 1914–1918 and up to 10 August 1920, the device consisted of a spray of oak leaves in bronze worn on the ribbon of the Victory Medal. Those who did not receive the Victory Medal wore the device on the British War Medal. Established in 1919, it was retrospective to August 1914. An example of the frequency of being mentioned in despatches is twenty-five out of 1,000 members of the Royal Newfoundland Regiment were so honored in the First World War. In all, 141,082 mentions were recorded in the &quot;London Gazette&quot; between 1914 and 1920.

From 1920 to 1993, the device consisted of a single bronze oak leaf, worn on the ribbon of the appropriate campaign medal, including the War Medal for a mention during the Second World War. The Canadian Armed Forces still use the bronze oak leaf device.

Since 1993 changes have been made in respect of United Kingdom armed forces:

For awards made from September 1993, the oak leaf has been in silver. The criteria were also made more specific, it now being defined as an operational gallantry award for acts of bravery during active operations.

From 2003, in addition to British campaign medals, the device can be worn on United Nations, NATO and EU medals.

Prior to 1979, a mention in despatches was one of three awards that could be made posthumously, the others being the Victoria Cross and George Cross. The 1979 reform allowed all gallantry decorations to be awarded posthumously.

Examples of soldiers who were mentioned with unusual frequency include the British First World War Victoria Cross recipient John Vereker, later Field Marshal Viscount Gort, a total of nine times, as was the Canadian general Sir Arthur Currie. The Australian general Gordon Bennett was mentioned in despatches a total of eight times during the First World War, as was Field Marshal Sir John Dill.

Below are illustrations of the device being worn on a variety of campaign medal ribbons:
=== Australia ===
Australian service personnel are no longer eligible to be mentioned in dispatches. Since 15 January 1991, when the Australian Honours System was established, the MiD has been replaced by the Australian decorations: the Commendation for Gallantry and the Commendation for Distinguished Service. Similarly, the equivalents of the MiD for acts of bravery by civilians and by soldiers not engaged with the enemy have also been reformed. The reformed and comprehensive system is now as follows:
* The Commendation for Gallantry is now the fourth level decoration for gallantry.
* The Commendation for Brave Conduct recognises acts of bravery carried out by soldiers not directly fighting the enemy and by civilians in war or peace.
* The Commendation for Distinguished Service, a third level distinguished service decoration, recognises distinguished general service, for exemplary performance in fields such as training, maintenance and administration.

=== Canada ===
A mention in dispatches – in French, – gives recognition from a senior commander for acts of brave or meritorious service, normally in the field. The mention in dispatches is among the list of awards presented by the governor general of Canada.
Recipients receive a bronze oak leaf insignia, worn on the ribbon of the relevant mission medal. Historically, MID was awarded during both World Wars and the Korean War, later reintroduced in 1990. , 283 MIDs had been awarded, each accompanied by a citation certificate.
Master Corporal Graham Ragsdale&#x27;s performance during Operation Anaconda in southeastern Afghanistan was mentioned in dispatches.

=== India ===
Mention in dispatches has been used since 1947 to recognize distinguished and meritorious service in operational areas and acts of gallantry which are not of a sufficiently high order to warrant the grant of gallantry awards.

Eligible personnel include all Army, Navy and Air Force personnel including personnel of the Reserve Forces, Territorial Army, Militia and other lawfully constituted armed forces, members of the Nursing Service and civilians working under or with the armed forces.

Personnel can be mentioned in dispatches posthumously and multiple awards are also possible. A recipient of a mention in a dispatch is entitled to wear an emblem, in the form of a lotus leaf on the ribbon of the relevant campaign medal. They are also issued with an official certificate from the Ministry of Defence.

=== Pakistan ===
Under the current Pakistani military honours system, the Imtiazi Sanad is conferred upon any member of the Pakistan Armed Forces who is mentioned in dispatches for an act of gallantry that does not qualify for a formal gallantry award.

=== South Africa ===

In 1920 the Minister of Defence of the Union of South Africa was empowered to award a multiple-leaved bronze oak leaf emblem to all servicemen and servicewomen mentioned in dispatches during the First World War for valuable services in action. The emblem, which was regarded as a decoration, was worn on the ribbon of the Victory Medal (Union of South Africa). Only one emblem was worn, irrespective of the number of times a recipient had been mentioned.

The Afrikaans rendition of &quot;mentioned in dispatches&quot; is .

In 1943, the Union Defence Force confirmed the availability of the British award, the bronze oak leaf, for acts of bravery, in contact with the enemy, which fell just short of the standard required for the granting of a decoration, or for valuable services not necessarily in immediate contact with the enemy.

The mention in dispatches (MiD) was one of only four awards which could be made posthumously. The others were the Victoria Cross, the George Cross, and the King&#x27;s Commendation (South Africa). The oak leaf emblem was worn on the ribbon of the War Medal 1939–1945.

The King&#x27;s Commendation (South Africa) (1939–45) was denoted by a bronze King Protea flower emblem worn on the ribbon of the Africa Service Medal, for valuable services in connection with the Second World War. It could be awarded posthumously and was the equivalent of a mention in dispatches for services rendered away from the battlefield.

The MiD and the King&#x27;s Commendation (SA) were the only decorations that could be approved by the South African Minister of Defence without reference to the King.

==France==

Since the French Revolution, France has had the custom of declaring deserving citizens or groups to have (&quot;well deserved the recognition of the Country&quot;). This sentiment is continued to this day in the formulation of the citations that accompany medals.

In the French military, mentions in dispatches – or more accurately, mention in orders () – are made by senior commanders, from the level of a Regimental commanding officer to the Commander-in-Chief, in the orders they give to their unit, recognizing the gallantry of an action performed some time before. There are two kinds of mentions: mentions with cross, for bravery in presence of the enemy, and mentions without cross, for bravery not in presence of the enemy.

===Mentions with cross===
The citations are given for acts of gallantry by any member of the French military or its allies and are, depending on the degree, roughly the equivalent of the US Bronze Star Medal or Silver Star and the UK Mention in Dispatches or Military Cross and, formerly, the Military Medal.

Mentions made during the two World Wars or colonial conflicts were accompanied with awards of a or a , with attachments on the ribbon depending on the mention&#x27;s degree : the lowest degree is represented by a bronze star while the highest degree is represented by a bronze palm.
* a bronze star for those who had been mentioned at the regiment or brigade level.
* a silver star for those who had been mentioned at the division level.
* a silver gilt star for those who had been mentioned at the corps level.
* a bronze palm for those who had been mentioned at the army level.
* a silver palm represents five bronze ones.
* a silver gilt palm for those who had been mentioned at the Free French Forces level (World War II only).

A unit can also be mentioned in dispatches. The unit standard is then decorated with the corresponding Croix. After two mentions, the men of the unit are entitled to wear a fourragère.

===Mentions without cross===
Since 2004, mentions for bravery not involving actual combat with the enemy are awarded with a gold (National Defence Medal) and with the same attachments as the . Before 2004, these mentions were recorded in the service member record, but not recognized with any decoration.

<doc id="841951" wikidata="Q5460855" url="?curid=841951" title="Florencio Morales Ramos">
<text>Florencio (&quot;Flor&quot;) Morales Ramos (September 5, 1915 – February 23, 1989), better known as Ramito, was a Puerto Rican trovador, and composer who was a native of Caguas, Puerto Rico. Fans of the genre consider him the king of Jíbaro music. Known as &quot;El Cantor de la Montaña&quot; (The Singer from the Mountain), Morales Ramos had two brothers, Luis (&quot;Luisito&quot;) and Juan María (&quot;Moralito&quot;), who also attained major recognition as jíbaro singers.

== Early years ==
Ramito was born on September 5, 1915, in the Bairoa barrio of Caguas, Puerto Rico (very close to where Bairoa Gym, headquarters for many Puerto Rican prizefighters and boxing champions, stands nowadays); &quot;Cagüitas&quot; (Little Caguas) was a boyhood nickname of his, used by his closest friends. He left school in fourth grade (&quot;but an old-time fourth grade at that!&quot;, he mentioned whenever asked) to assist his parents, who were parenting twelve other children (including six of their own), and whose economic situation was precarious. His mother had been an amateur singer and improviser and he would sing her favorite songs at the sugar cane fields where he served, first as a water boy and later as a messenger and sugar cane cutter. Regarded as a good singer by his peers, he was already singing for money at the age of thirteen. In 1932, he began his music career, as a participant at a local trova singers contest in Caguas. That was the beginning of fame for &quot;Ramito&quot;.

== Musical career ==
Ten years later, in 1942, he inaugurated the WIAC radio station, a station with national reach. He also sang in the inaugural broadcast of WKJB-AM in Mayagüez, in 1948. Later he animated the radio show &quot;La Hora del Volante&quot;, from Bayamón. His affable stage presence and reputation as a fast improviser and bright lyricist earned him a large following in Puerto Rico and growing communities of Puerto Rican migrants to the northeastern United States.

&quot;Ramito&quot; was featured in the short musical film &quot;Truya&quot; (1950), along the most reputed Puerto Rican jíbaro singers and musicians of the time, including Jesús Sánchez Erazo &quot;Chuíto El De Bayamón&quot;, Ernestina Reyes, &quot;La Calandria&quot;, Maso Rivera and others. He also appeared on television multiple times and he released a wide number of trova albums, of which many were best sellers in Puerto Rico and other Latin American countries.

Between 1960 and 1972 he nominally moved to New York, where he worked on the radio show &quot;La Montaña Canta&quot; on the WHOM station. He maintained a constant presence in Puerto Rico, however, virtually living between both places.

&quot;Ramito&quot; became an icon to fans of trova music in Puerto Rico, specially those in the mountainside areas of that island. He toured intensely in Latin America and the United States, and had a particularly strong following among the Puerto Rican community in Hawaii, which he visited twice. He also visited Okinawa, where he entertained Puerto Rican troops of the United States military who were stationed there. He sang for president John F. Kennedy at the White House in November 1961, in a showcase of Puerto Rican musical talent that complemented a visit by then governor Luis Muñoz Marín to Washington.

== Musical work ==
Ramito influenced several Puerto Rican musicians and singers, not only within the &quot;canción jíbara&quot; realm, but also in other Puerto Rican music genres, such as plena and salsa. He is credited with inventing the &quot;seis de enramada&quot;, one of the many musical structures to which Puerto Rican country music is sung to (collectively named &quot;seises&quot; after a distantly related genre made popular in Andalusian music). He also popularized the &quot;seis llanera&quot;, a variety of &quot;seis&quot; that incorporated musical influences that are also common to Venezuela.

Willie Colón was so strongly moved by Ramito&#x27;s work that he recorded &quot;Patria y Amor&quot;, one of Ramito&#x27;s &quot;décimas&quot;, as part of his seminal Christmas album &quot;Asalto Navideño&quot; (1971). Héctor Lavoe&#x27;s interpretation of the song, renamed &quot;Canto a Borinquen&quot; for the album, is considered the definitive version of this patriotic song, which has since been versioned by José Feliciano, Lucecita Benítez and other Puerto Rican singers.

=== Que Bonita Bandera ===
Ramito&#x27;s composition &quot;Qué Bonita Bandera&quot; -a &quot;plena&quot; homage to the Puerto Rican flag- deserves a particular mention. During the decade previous to the song&#x27;s inception in 1968, waving a Puerto Rican flag in public was considered taboo in the island (during a brief period in the early 1950s, which coincided with the Jayuya Uprising and the United States Capitol shooting incident of 1954 it was actually outlawed). Ramito wrote the song to demonstrate pride for the flag. In its lyrics, he incorporated the names of José de Diego, Ramón Emeterio Betances and Luis Muñoz Rivera, and manifested his wish to see it &quot;floating freely over my beautiful Borinquen&quot;. It quickly became an unofficial anthem for Puerto Ricans everywhere, and was particularly popular among Puerto Ricans in New York City. Besides Ramito&#x27;s original version, it has been versioned by multiple artists, including Jennifer Lopez, Ricky Martin, Pete Seeger, Yolandita Monge, Tony Croatto, José González y su Banda Criolla, and others. Salvadorean band La Fuerza used the song&#x27;s chorus as the basis for a similarly named song honoring El Salvador.

On March 19, 2009, &quot;Qué Bonita Bandera&quot; was played as part of the wake-up call for Space Shuttle Mission STS-119, in honor of Mission Specialist Joe Acaba, whose ancestry is Puerto Rican.

== Personal life ==
In his early years, Ramito was an agricultural worker; he later served as a prison warden and firefighter before becoming a professional singer. In 1970 the government of Puerto Rico named him a liaison and goodwill ambassador to the Puerto Rican communities in the United States.

Ramito married six times and had eight children. His widow Irma Rodriguez is a jíbaro singer on her own merit, whose nickname is &quot;La Jibarita de Salinas&quot;. Ramito relocated to her hometown, Salinas, after marrying her. On February 23, 1989, Ramito committed suicide by a self-inflicted gunshot wound in his in-law&#x27;s house, after learning that a cancer he was suffering at the time had metastasized. He was buried in the town&#x27;s cemetery.

<doc id="841953" wikidata="Q1431686" url="?curid=841953" title="Spirou (magazine)">
<text>Spirou () is a weekly Belgian comics magazine published by the Dupuis company since April 21, 1938. It is an anthology magazine with new features appearing regularly, containing a mix of short humor strips and serialized features, of which the most popular series would be collected as albums by Dupuis afterwards.

==History==
===Creation===
With the success of the weekly magazine &quot;Le Journal de Mickey&quot; in France, and the popularity of the weekly &quot;Adventures of Tintin&quot; in &quot;Le Petit Vingtième&quot;, many new comic magazines or youth magazines with comics appeared in France and Belgium in the second half of the 1930s. In 1936, the experienced publisher Jean Dupuis put his sons Paul and the 19-year-old Charles in charge of a new magazine aimed at the juvenile market.

First appearing 21 April 1938, it was a large format magazine, available only in French and only in Wallonia. It was an eight-page weekly comics magazine composed of a mixture of short stories and gags, serial comics and short articles. It introduced two new comics, the eponymous &quot;Spirou&quot; drawn by the young Frenchman Rob-Vel, and &quot;Les Aventures de Tif&quot; (later to become &quot;Tif et Tondu&quot;) written and drawn by Fernand Dineur, and printed American comics such as &quot;Superman&quot;, &quot;Red Ryder&quot; and &quot;Brick Bradford&quot;. On 27 October 1938 the Flemish edition named &quot;Robbedoes&quot; appeared as well.

===Second World War===
&quot;Spirou&quot; and &quot;Robbedoes&quot; soon became very popular and the magazine doubled its pages from 8 to 16. After the invasion of the Germans, the magazine gradually had to stop publishing American comics. They were at first continued by local artists and later replaced with new series. When Rob-Vel no longer had the possibility to send his pages from France to Belgium on a regular basis either, his series was continued by Joseph Gillain, a young artist who had previously worked for &quot;Petits Belges&quot; and used the pen name Jijé. Together with Dineur and Sirius (pen name of Max Mayeu), they filled the magazine with a number of new series and increased the popularity of it even further.

Near the end of the war, due to paper shortages, publication had to be stopped anyway, with only a few irregular almanacs to keep the bond with the readers intact and to provide work for the personnel to prevent them being deported to Germany.

===The golden years===
The period 1945–1960 has been described by critics as the golden age of &quot;Spirou&quot; magazine and of Belgian comics in general, partly incited by the 1946 appearance of the successful competitor &quot;Tintin&quot; magazine. &quot;Spirou&quot; resumed publication only weeks after Belgium was liberated, but now on a much smaller format. Jijé was the main author, providing pages from multiple series each week. Some American comics reappeared as well. Jijé started out a studio, where he schooled three talented apprentices, Will, André Franquin and Morris; known as the &quot;Bande à quatre&quot;, &quot;Gang of four&quot;, they began laying the foundation for the Marcinelle school that marked the magazine for decades.

In 1946 and 1947, the team was joined by some of the main contributors to &quot;Spirou&quot; for the next decades, including Victor Hubinon, Jean-Michel Charlier and Eddy Paape. After a few years, these artists started their now classic series like &quot;Buck Danny&quot; by Hubinon and Charlier and &quot;Lucky Luke&quot; by Morris, while Franquin took over &quot;Spirou&quot; from Jijé. Gradually, the American comics and reprints were replaced by new, European productions, and by the 50s, nearly all the content was made especially for the magazine. Charles Dupuis remained editor-in-chief of the magazine until 1955 when he appointed Yvan Delporte to that position, so he could himself focus on his increasing interest in the publication of the magazine&#x27;s series&#x27; albums.

The golden ages culminated in the 1950s with the introduction of more authors and series like Peyo (&quot;Johan and Peewit&quot; in 1952, &quot;The Smurfs&quot; in 1958), René Follet, Marcel Remacle, Jean Roba (with &quot;Boule et Bill&quot;), Maurice Tillieux (with &quot;Gil Jourdan&quot;) and Mitacq. In 1954, Jijé created the realistic western comic &quot;Jerry Spring&quot;, and in 1957 Franquin introduced the anti-hero &quot;Gaston Lagaffe&quot;. The authors of the magazine, many of them pupils of Jijé, were grouped stylistically in the Marcinelle school, the counterpart of ligne claire exhibited by the artists grouped around Hergé in &quot;Tintin&quot; magazine (the main competitor for &quot;Spirou&quot;).

By 1960, the magazine had achieved a fixed structure and had grown to 52 pages, mainly filled with new, European (mainly Belgian) comics, coupled with some text pages (interaction with the readers) and adverts. Most of the comics were long-running series which were regularly published as albums of 44 or 64 pages, generating a constant source of revenue for the artists and the publisher. In the next decades, the sales of albums would become the main focus, reducing the importance of the magazine which became more of a breeding ground for new talent and series.

===Rejuvenation in the 1960s and 1970s===
In the early 1960s, the main changes were the strong editorial work of Delporte, who kept the magazine vibrant despite the more or less fixed series, with numerous supplements, games, and experimental layouts. The magazine demonstrated the pleasure that had gone in creating it, and maintained a strong reader base despite the growing competition from more adolescent and adult French magazines like &quot;Pilote&quot;. Some of the main authors (Jijé, Franquin, Will, and Hubinon) temporarily started working for other magazines, with Morris the only major name who definitely left the magazine. Their replacements, like Berck, had trouble filling the void.

Around 1959–1960, the first &quot;mini-récits&quot; (lit. mini-stories) appeared. This was an experiment in which the middle pages of the magazines could be removed, which the reader (armed with a pair of scissors, a stapler and some patience) could fold into a small comics magazine of its own. Several artists were allowed to hone their skills inside these mini-récits before moving on to larger pages, and until the 1970s, more than 500 mini-récits were produced, series that debuted in this format include &quot;The Smurfs&quot; by Peyo, &quot;Bobo&quot; by Rosy and Deliège, &quot;Flagada&quot; by Degotte among many others.

Only in the early 1970s, did a number of new success series and authors emerge. The main contributor for the next decades was Raoul Cauvin, a lithographer who worked as a cameraman for the Dupuis animation studios and wrote stories for series like &quot;Musti&quot;. He became the main story writer for Dupuis, with major series like &quot;Sammy&quot; with Berck, &quot;Les Tuniques Bleues&quot; with Lambil, and later &quot;Cédric&quot; with Laudec and &quot;Agent 212&quot; with Daniel Kox, among many others. Other important new authors were François Walthery with &quot;Natacha&quot; and Roger Leloup with &quot;Yoko Tsuno&quot;, together with &quot;Isabelle&quot; by Will evidence of the new wave of adventurous female-oriented comics of the decade.

A commercial failure but artistic success came along in 1977, when Delporte created the more adult supplement &quot;Le Trombone Illustré&quot;, which appeared inside &quot;Spirou&quot; for thirty weeks, and showcased new artists like Didier Comès, Enki Bilal, Claire Bretécher, F&#x27;murr, Grzegorz Rosinski, and Frédéric Jannin, next to more established authors like René Hausman, Peyo, Roba, Gotlib, and Franquin, who started his third major series, &quot;Idées Noires&quot;.

===Since 1980===
The early 1980s had &quot;Spirou&quot; and &quot;Robbedoes&quot; searching for a new, appealing identity, with new formulas, more adult comics like &quot;XIII&quot; by William Vance and Jean Van Hamme or &quot;Jeremiah&quot; by Hermann. Most artists of the first generation were no longer active, and the productivity of many artists of the second generation slowed down as well. New talents were Tome and Janry, the new team for the &quot;Spirou et Fantasio&quot; comic, Bruno Gazzotti (&quot;Soda&quot;), François Gilson (&quot;Mélusine&quot;), Bercovici, Zidrou, André Geerts, Bernard Hislaire, Midam (&quot;Kid Paddle&quot;), Frank Pé, Marc Hardy and Luc Cromheecke.

&quot;Robbedoes&quot; had a severe reduction in the number of readers, and was first reduced to 32 pages (with &quot;Spirou&quot; growing to 68), before it finally disappeared in 2005.

==Collections==
From the very start, &quot;Spirou&quot; and &quot;Robbedoes&quot; published collections of 10 to 13 consecutive magazines in hardcover format - originally quarterly, but more frequently with the increased page number of the magazine. This series still continues for &quot;Spirou&quot; with 381 volumes as of January 2025.

==&quot;Spirou&quot; and &quot;Tintin&quot; rivalry==
Since the 1940s, &quot;Spirou&quot; was in constant competition with &quot;Tintin&quot; magazine. If one artist was published by one of the magazines, he would not be published by the other one. This was a gentleman&#x27;s agreement between the two publishers, Raymond Leblanc of Le Lombard and Charles Dupuis of Dupuis. One notable exception was André Franquin, who in 1955, after a dispute with its editor, moved from the more popular &quot;Spirou&quot; to &quot;Tintin&quot;. The dispute was quickly settled, but Franquin had signed an agreement with &quot;Tintin&quot; for five years. He created &quot;Modeste et Pompon&quot; for &quot;Tintin&quot; while pursuing work for &quot;Spirou&quot;. He quit &quot;Tintin&quot; at the end of his contract. Some artists moved from &quot;Spirou&quot; to &quot;Tintin&quot; like Eddy Paape and Liliane &amp; Fred Funcken, while some went from &quot;Tintin&quot; to &quot;Spirou&quot; like Raymond Macherot and Berck.

==Format==
The target audience is between 9 and 16 years, although the magazine appeals to many adults as well. Over the years, &quot;Spirou&quot; has undergone a few format changes and gradually became thicker, eventually averaging 68 pages. It was distributed in most French and Dutch speaking countries, and for some years, editions in other languages appeared as well (notably in Spain and Portugal).

A few pages, apart from the comics and the advertising, are always put aside for text contents and interaction with the readers (games, letters, jokes, etc.). Often a general theme is used to give the magazine some unity instead of being just a collection of unrelated comics, and this also gets reflected in the layout.

Along with &quot;Tintin&quot; magazine (founded in 1946), it was considered the home of the Franco-Belgian comics school until the seventies, when its importance declined. Still in publication, Spirou sells some 100,000 copies every week (as of 2009). &quot;Robbedoes&quot; was eventually shelved in September 2005, after more than 3500 weekly publications.

==Title==
*On 21 April 1938, the magazine was created under the name &quot;Le journal de Spirou&quot;.
*On 1 May 1947, it was renamed &quot;Spirou&quot;.
*On 5 October 1988, it was renamed &quot;Spirou Magaziiiine&quot;
*On 12 January 1994, it was once again named &quot;Spirou&quot;.
*On 25 January 2006, it became &quot;Spirou HeBDo&quot;.
*On 16 April 2008, it again became &quot;Spirou&quot;.

*Jingbei (, meaning &quot;North of Capital&quot;) will be carved from two counties in Zhangjiakou: Huailai and Zhuolu
*Jingnan (, meaning &quot;South of Capital&quot;) will compose of a county-level city in Baoding: Zhuozhou

<text>Liberal conservatism is a political ideology combining conservative policies with liberal stances, especially on economic issues but also on social and ethical matters, representing a brand of political conservatism strongly influenced by liberalism.

The ideology incorporates the classical liberal view of minimal government intervention in the economy, according to which individuals should be free to participate in the market and generate wealth without government interference. However, liberal conservatives also hold that individuals cannot be thoroughly depended on to act responsibly in other spheres of life; therefore, they believe that a strong state is necessary to ensure law and order and that social institutions are needed to nurture a sense of duty and responsibility to the nation. Liberal conservatives also support civil liberties, along with some socially conservative positions. They differ on social issues, with some being socially conservative and others socially liberal, though all liberal conservatives broadly support the rule of law regarding civil rights, social equality and the environment. This is equated with the creation of a cohesive and tolerant society with increased levels of individual responsibility and less inequality.

Liberal conservatism shares the classical liberal tenets of a commitment to individualism, belief in negative freedom, a lightly regulated free market, and a minimal rule of law state. A number of commentators have stated that many conservative currents in the 1980s, such as Thatcherism, were rejuvenated classical liberals in all but name. However, in contrast to classical liberalism, there is a stronger social agenda and support for a greater degree of state intervention, especially in those areas of social life which liberal conservatives believe should not be subject to market forces.

Both &quot;conservatism&quot; and &quot;liberalism&quot; have had different meanings over time in different centuries. The term &quot;liberal conservatism&quot; has been used in quite different ways. It usually contrasts with aristocratic conservatism, which deems the principle of equality as something discordant with human nature and emphasizes instead the idea of natural inequality. As conservatives in democratic countries have embraced typical liberal institutions such as the rule of law, private property, the market economy and constitutional representative government, the liberal element of liberal conservatism became consensual among conservatives. In some countries such as the United Kingdom and the United States, the term &quot;liberal conservatism&quot; came to be understood simply as &quot;conservatism&quot; in popular culture, prompting some conservatives who embraced more strongly classical-liberal values to call themselves &quot;libertarians&quot; instead. However, there are differences between classical liberals and libertarians.

In their embrace of liberal and free market principles, European liberal conservatives are clearly distinguishable from those holding national-conservative, fully socially conservative and/or outright populist views, let alone a right-wing populist posture. Being liberal often involves stressing free market economics and the belief in individual responsibility together with the defense of civil rights and support for a limited welfare state. Compared to other centre-right political traditions such as Christian democracy, liberal conservatives are less socially conservative and more economically liberal, favouring low taxes and minimal state intervention in the economy.

At the European level, Christian democrats and most liberal conservatives are affiliated to the European People&#x27;s Party (EPP), while liberals (including conservative and social liberals) to the Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe Party (ALDE Party). In this context, some traditionally Christian-democratic parties (such as Christian-Democratic and Flemish in Belgium, the Christian Democratic Appeal in the Netherlands, the Christian Democratic Union in Germany and the People&#x27;s Party in Austria) have become almost undistinguishable from other liberal-conservative parties. On the other hand, newer liberal-conservative parties (such as New Democracy in Greece, the Social Democratic Party in Portugal, the People&#x27;s Party in Spain, /The People of Freedom/ in Italy, the Union for a Popular Movement/The Republicans in France and most centre-right parties from countries once belonging to the Eastern Bloc and Yugoslavia) have not adopted traditional labels, but their ideologies are also a mixture of conservatism, Christian democracy and liberalism.

In the modern European discourse, &quot;liberal conservatism&quot; usually encompasses centre-right political outlooks that reject at least to some extent social conservatism. This position is also associated with support for moderate forms of social safety net and environmentalism (see also green conservatism and green liberalism). This variety of liberal conservatism has been espoused by Nordic conservatives (the Moderate Party in Sweden, the Conservative Party in Norway and the National Coalition Party in Finland) which have been fending off competition from right-wing populists to their right and do not include Christian democrats; and at times the British Conservative Party. In an interview shortly after taking office as Prime Minister in 2010, David Cameron introduced himself as a liberal conservative. During his first speech to a party conference in 2006, Cameron had defined this as believing in individual freedom and human rights, but being skeptical of &quot;grand schemes to remake the world&quot;.

=== Relation to American conservatism ===

In the United States, conservatives often combine the economic individualism of classical liberals with a Burkean form of conservatism that emphasizes the natural inequalities between men, the irrationality of human behavior as the basis for the human drive for order and stability and the rejection of natural rights as the basis for government. From a different perspective, American conservatism (a &quot;hybrid of conservatism and classical liberalism&quot;) has exalted three tenets of Burkean conservatism, namely the diffidence toward the power of the state, the preference of liberty over equality and for patriotism while rejecting the three remaining tenets, namely loyalty to traditional institutions and hierarchies, skepticism regarding progress and elitism. Consequently, the term &quot;liberal conservatism&quot; is not used in the United States. Modern American liberalism happens to be quite different from European liberalism and occupies the centre-left of the political spectrum, in contrast to many European countries where liberalism is often more associated with the centre and centre-right while social democracy makes up a substantial part of the centre-left. The opposite is true in Latin America, where economically liberal conservatism is often labelled under the rubric of neoliberalism both in popular culture and academic discourse.

Although libertarian conservatism has similarities to liberal conservatism with both being influenced by classical liberal thought, libertarian conservatism is far more anti-statist than liberal conservatism and is much more hostile to government intervention in both social and economic matters. Combining conservative cultural principles but with less social intervention and a more &quot;laissez faire&quot; economic system. Neoconservatism is sometimes described as the same or similar to liberal conservatism in Europe. However, Peter Lawler has regarded neoconservatism in the United States as conservative liberalism and distinguished it from liberal conservatism.

== Classical conservatism and economic liberalism ==

Historically, conservatism in the 18th and 19th centuries comprised a set of principles based on concern for established tradition, respect for authority and religious values. This form of traditionalist or classical conservatism is often considered to be exemplified by the writings of Joseph de Maistre in the post-Enlightenment age. Contemporaneous liberalism, now recalled as classical liberalism, advocated both political freedom for individuals and a free market in the economic sphere. Ideas of this sort were promulgated by John Locke, Montesquieu, Voltaire, Jean-Jacques Rousseau, Ben Franklin, Thomas Jefferson, Thomas Paine, Edward Gibbon, David Hume, Adam Smith, Jeremy Bentham and John Stuart Mill, who are respectively remembered as the fathers of liberalism, including economic liberalism, the separation of church and state, social liberalism and utilitarianism.
According to scholar Andrew Vincent, the maxim of liberal conservatism is &quot;economics is prior to politics&quot;. Others emphasize the openness of historical change and a suspicion of tyrannical majorities behind the hailing of individual liberties and traditional virtues by authors such as Edmund Burke and Alexis de Tocqueville as the basis of current liberal conservatism which can be seen both in the works of Raymond Aron and Michael Oakeshott. However, there is general agreement that the original liberal conservatives were those who combined conservative social attitudes with an economically liberal outlook, adapting a previous aristocratic understanding of natural inequalities between men to the rule of meritocracy, without directly criticizing privileges of birth as long as individual liberties were guaranteed. Over time, the majority of conservatives in the Western world came to adopt free market economic ideas as the Industrial Revolution progressed and the monarchy, aristocracy and clergy lost their wealth and power, to the extent that such ideas are now generally considered as part of conservatism. Nonetheless, the term &quot;liberal&quot; is used in most countries to describe those with free-market economic views. This is the case in continental Europe, Australia and Latin America.

<text>Martí Joan de Galba (; died 1490) was a Valencian author. He is often considered to be the co-author of the famous Catalan language epic &quot;Tirant lo Blanch&quot;, which he worked on after the death of his friend, Joanot Martorell. But the nature of his contributions have been called into question, based on differences in the manuscript and the first printed edition by . 

David H. Rosenthal, one of the two translators of the work into English, notes a consistency in the portions attributed to Galba; especially place-names and his familiarity with John Mandeville&#x27;s &quot;Travels&quot;. However, the philologist, Joan Coromines, suggests that Galba&#x27;s role was limited to copy editing; such as dividing the book into chapters.

Joan Roís de Corella has been cited as a more likely source for any substantive additions to the text.

<text>Los Ángeles () is the capital of the province of Bío Bío, in the commune of the same name, in Bío Bío, in the center-south of Chile. It is located between the Laja and Biobío rivers. The population is 186,671 inhabitants (census 2012). The municipality (&quot;comuna&quot;) of Los Ángeles has the highest absolute rural population of any Chilean municipality.

To the north of the city is Salto del Laja (Laja Falls), and roughly 100 kilometers to the east is the high Antuco volcano, in the Andes mountain range. The city is a gateway for tourists visiting the nearby Laguna del Laja National Park, the location of the volcano.

Los Ángeles is served by María Dolores Airport.

==History==
Founded as Nuestra Señora de Los Ángeles (Our Lady of the Angels) in 1739 by José Antonio Manso de Velasco, it was originally a Spanish fort as an outpost in the War of Arauco. It received the title of &quot;villa&quot; in 1748. The city underwent numerous rebuildings, due to the Spanish military campaigns against the native Mapuche in their efforts to colonize the area. Its geographic location, just to the north of the Biobío river (the border established by the Spaniards), made it a strategic location.

In 1858, during the process of German immigration in Chile, Colonia Humán was founded, a town colonized by German settlers from Germany and Austro-Hungarian Empire and which was completely conurbated within the current urban limits of the city.

==Demographics==
According to the 2002 census of the National Statistics Institute, Los Ángeles spans an area of and has 166,556 inhabitants (81,863 men and 84,693 women). Of these, 123,445 (74.1%) lived in urban areas and 43,111 (25.9%) in rural areas. The population grew by 18.5% (26,021 persons) between the 1992 and 2002 censuses.

Within the communities of historical immigrants of the city of foreign origin, the Spanish, Arabs, Germans, and Swiss stand out, depending on their number and contributions, from the colonized localities by Europeans in the area, especially from Araucanía.

== Climate ==
This region experiences warm (but not hot) and dry summers, with no average monthly temperatures above 71.6 °F. According to the Köppen Climate Classification system, Los Ángeles has a warm-summer Mediterranean climate, abbreviated &quot;Csb&quot; on climate maps. Most of the annual precipitation of 42 inches (1070 mm) falls during the autumn and winter months of April through September. May is the wettest month, with 10 inches (250 mm) of precipitation on average. Snow is uncommon, and when it falls melts quickly.

==Administration==
As a commune, Los Ángeles is a third-level administrative division of Chile administered by a municipal council, headed by an alcalde who is directly elected every four years. The 2008-2012 alcalde is Joel Rosales Guzmán (UDI).

Within the electoral divisions of Chile, Los Ángeles is represented in the Chamber of Deputies by Juan Lobos (UDI) and José Pérez (PRSD) as part of the 47th electoral district, together with Tucapel, Antuco, Quilleco, Santa Bárbara, Quilaco, Mulchén, Negrete, Nacimiento, San Rosendo, Laja and Alto Bío Bío. The commune is represented in the Senate by Victor Pérez Varela (UDI) and Mariano Ruiz-Esquide Jara (PDC) as part of the 13th senatorial constituency (Biobío-Coast).

==Popular culture==
The author Roberto Bolaño spent much of his childhood here.

The 90s alternative music artist Frank Black wrote a song about a place in &quot;South Patagonia&quot; called Los Angeles on the first track of his eponymous album; while the Chilean Los Angeles lies just north of the northernmost part of Patagonia (demarcated as south of the Huincul Fault according to geographical definitions), it is probable that Black is referring to the Chilean Los Angeles.

<text>Anthriscus (chervils) is a common plant genus of the family Apiaceae, growing in Europe and temperate parts of Asia. It comprises 15 species. The genus grows in meadows and verges on slightly wet porous soils. One species, &quot;Anthriscus cerefolium&quot; is cultivated and used in the kitchen to flavor foods.

&quot;Anthriscus&quot; species are used as food plants by the larvae of some Lepidoptera species including the mouse moth (recorded on cow parsley).

The hollow stem is erect and branched, ending in compound umbels of small white or greenish flowers. The leaves are bipinnate or tripinnate.

<text>Guinevere Jane Turner (born May 23, 1968) is an American actress, screenwriter, and film director. She wrote the films &quot;American Psycho&quot; and &quot;The Notorious Bettie Page&quot; and played the lead role of the dominatrix Tanya Cheex in &quot;Preaching to the Perverted&quot;. She was a story editor and played recurring character Gabby Deveaux on Showtime&#x27;s &quot;The L Word&quot;.

==Early life==
Turner was born in Boston, and is the oldest of six children. Her maternal grandmother, Elizabeth Hobbs Turner, was a member of the United States Marine Corps in 1944 during World War II.

Turner spent the first eleven years of her life as part of the Lyman Family, raised in various communes around the U.S. with over 100 members who were devotees of Mel Lyman. In accordance with the customs of the Lyman Family, Turner was not raised by her mother, but she and her younger sister were eventually ejected from the Family after their mother chose to leave. Turner considered rejoining the group when she was 18, but eventually chose to attend college.

==Career==
Turner co-wrote and co-produced her first film, 1994&#x27;s &quot;Go Fish&quot;, with her then-girlfriend, director Rose Troche. Turner also starred in the film, portraying a young woman named Max whose friends help her find a new girlfriend, Ely, portrayed by VS Brodie. Director Kevin Smith was a fan of the movie, particularly a scene in it wherein, in an imagined sequence, some of a character&#x27;s friends chastise her for &quot;selling out&quot; and sleeping with a man, and used it as an inspiration for his own take on a similar theme in his own film &quot;Chasing Amy&quot;. Turner has cameos in both &quot;Chasing Amy&quot; and Smith&#x27;s later film &quot;Dogma&quot;. Smith also named Joey Lauren Adams&#x27; character in Smith&#x27;s &quot;Mallrats&quot; after Turner. Another early film appearance was in Cheryl Dunye&#x27;s 1996 independent film &quot;The Watermelon Woman&quot;.

Turner and &quot;I Shot Andy Warhol&quot; director Mary Harron wrote the screenplay for the film version of Bret Easton Ellis&#x27; &quot;American Psycho&quot;, which Harron directed. Turner has a small role in the film, in which she delivers the in-joke, &quot;I&#x27;m not a lesbian!&quot;.

A writer and story editor for the first two seasons of &quot;The L Word&quot;, Turner also made several guest appearances on the show as Alice Pieszecki&#x27;s screenwriter ex-girlfriend, Gabby.

In 2005, Turner wrote the script for &quot;BloodRayne&quot;. It was nominated for a Golden Raspberry Award for Worst Screenplay in 2006. In the documentary &quot;Tales from the Script&quot;, she stated in an interview that director Uwe Boll only used about 25% of her screenplay. In 2005, she co-wrote the script for &quot;The Notorious Bettie Page&quot; with Mary Harron, who directed the film. Turner and Harron collaborated again as screenwriter and director, respectively, on the 2018 film &quot;Charlie Says&quot;.

Turner&#x27;s first foray into web television was the 2008 online drama series, &quot;FEED&quot;, directed by Mel Robertson, launched on AfterEllen.com. In 2014, she appeared alongside Nayo Wallace, Candis Cayne and Cathy DeBuono in Jane Clark&#x27;s horror comedy film &quot;Crazy Bitches&quot;.

Turner has directed several short films, such as &quot;Hummer&quot; and &quot;Hung&quot;, which have appeared in many international film festivals.

In 2019, &quot;The New Yorker&quot; published an essay by Turner entitled &quot;My Childhood in a Cult,&quot; about growing up in the Lyman Family. Four years later, Turner published a memoir, &quot;When the World Didn&#x27;t End&quot;, expanding greatly on the story of her youth, and continuing on to her adolescence in an abusive household. &quot;Kirkus Reviews&quot; called the book &quot;a moving portrait of a bizarre childhood written with emotional nuance and bittersweet deliverance ... The author’s prose is reflective, vivid, and confessional, a rich combination full of striking imagery.&quot;

==Personal life==
Turner is openly lesbian. She lives in New York and Los Angeles.

<text>Nümbrecht is a municipality in the state of Oberbergischer Kreis, in North Rhine-Westphalia, Germany. Nümbrecht is a health resort, known for its good climate.

==Geography==
Nümbrecht is located about 40 km east of Cologne.

==History==
The history of Nümbrecht dates back to 1131, when it was first mentioned in a document called the &quot;Papal Possession Confirmation for the Inhabitants of Bonn Saint Cassiusstift&quot; (document firsamingst n of Oberbergischer places by Klaus Pampus). The first written form of the name was &quot;Nuenbret&quot;, while evidence suggests that people have inhabited this area since the Stone Age, the recorded history of the community begins in the early Middle Ages.

Between the year 600 and 700, the first settlements in the Oberberg area started to emerge. It is believed that Nümbrecht already existed as a settlement between the year 768 and 918, with its name meaning &quot;measured district for a new settlement&quot;. The Evangelical Church of Nümbrecht was likely constructed in 955, marking an important milestone in Nümbrecht&#x27;s history.

During the period between the year 900 and 1200, the settlement of Marienberghausen was established. On December 1, 1264, the story of Homburg&#x27;s dominion began with the acquisition of the county of Sayn by Gottfried I. From 1268 to 1276, Gottfried I built &quot;Castle Homburg&quot; as his residence. In 1359, the Count of Sayn married the daughter of the last Count of Wittgenstein, expanding their name to &quot;Count of Sayn-Wittgenstein&quot;.

In 1665, the chapel of Marienberghausen was transformed into a church, which has retained its building to this day. The Homburg dynasty ceased to exist in 1743, and the dominion fell to the House of Sayn-Wittgenstein-Berleburg. In 1792, Christian Heinrich, Count of Sayn-Wittgenstein-Berleburg, gained recognition as a sovereign state.

In 1806, Friedrich Albert, the son of Christian Heinrich, lost his official power as a sovereign due to the establishment of the Rhine Alliance. This marked the end of the Homburgian government after 530 years. In 1808, both Marien Nümbrecht and Marienberghausen were established and incorporated into the Napoleonic Grand Duchy of Berg.

In 1813, French rule in the municipality came to an end, and the Marien municipalities were renamed as mayor&#x27;s offices, falling under Prussian supremacy. In 1845, the Rhine local code was released, leading to the first municipal council elections in Nümbrecht and Marienberghausen.

In 1933, the government fell into the hands of members of the NSDAP, and anxiety and arbitrariness dominated Nümbrecht for 12 years. In 1946, democratic order was restored, and a new municipal council was elected. In 1968, the administrations of both Nümbrecht and Marienberghausen were merged.

In 1969, the current community of Nümbrecht was formed with the implementation of the &quot;Law about the Reorganization of the Oberbergischer Kreis&quot;. In 1973, Nümbrecht received national recognition as an air spa from the Minister of Work, Health, and Social Duties. In 1987, it gained national recognition as a well-being climatic spa. Over the years, numerous health and leisure facilities have been developed and expanded.

The Nümbrecht high school was founded in 1992, followed by the establishment of the Sophie Scholl school in 1994. In 1995, the Rhein-Sieg Clinic, specializing in orthopedics and neurology, was opened on Höhenstrasse in Nümbrecht. In 2003, Nümbrecht became the first local authority district in North Rhine-Westphalia to receive the environmental brand &quot;Viabono,&quot; which signifies environment-friendly tourism. Additionally, Nümbrecht was classified as a premium-class remedial-climatic health resort.

==Coat of arms==
The coat of arms was initially granted on January 4, 1936, and subsequently in 1969. It bears a striking resemblance to the coat of arms of the Homburg Estate, which was owned by the Counts of Sayn-Wittgenstein-Berleburg. Additionally, the castle featured in the coat of arms also represents the district. The Homburg is located within the municipality, and above the left tower, the coat of arms displays the emblem of the Counts themselves.

==Culture==

===Art Society of Nümbrecht===

In 1983, the Nümbrecht Art Association was founded.
Various exhibitions take place in the art gallery in Nümbrecht. The sculptures were a gift from the Nümbrecht Art Association to the municipality of Nümbrecht for the embellishment of the health resort.

==Sights==

===Watchtower===
The 30-metre high watchtower at the &quot;Lindchen&quot; in Nümbrecht has 154 steps; the top of the tower is 371 metres above sea level. From the top, one can see the Rhine, the Siebengebirge mountain range and even as far as the Rothaargebirge mountain range.

===Amiger tunnel===
This iron ore mining tunnel known as the Amiger tunnel is approximately 200 to 300 years old. The Amiger tunnel is situated in a forest area called &quot;In the Goldkaule&quot;, below the &quot;Alfred Lang&quot; hut and the watchtower. The tunnel is approximately 20 metres long. However, according to local legends, the tunnel goes as far as the village Ödinghausen. Today, the entry to the tunnel is covered by a grating and only the bats know where the tunnel leads...

===Benroth===
The &quot;ecovillage&quot; Benroth is about five kilometres from Nümbrecht. The conversion of Benroth into an &quot;ecological village of the future&quot; required some measures, such as the installation of a moist biotope and drystone-wallings. The one-hour tour &quot;ecomile&quot; through the village shares insight into the projects.

===Half timbering===
There are a number of well-preserved half-timbered houses in the small village of Bruch, northeast of Nümbrecht. Most of these date back to the 19th century. Some were built on the foundation walls of the previous houses.

===Remarkable rocks===
Near Nümbrecht, small quartzite monadnocks from the Devonian period (approximately 360 million years ago) were exposed by the erosion of softer sedimentary rock. Crinoids (&quot;sea lily&quot;) and brachiopod fossils have been discovered here. They are neither erratic blocks from the ice age nor meteorites, as was formerly believed.

===Witches&#x27; ponds===

Two ponds below the nearby village of Spreitgen are known as &quot;Hexenweiher&quot; (&quot;witches&#x27; ponds&quot;). It is not known whether the name derives from actual witchcraft trials by dunking during the Middle Ages. During these trials, suspected witches were thrown into a pond with their hands cuffed and their feet tied together. If they went under and drowned, they were considered innocent. If they survived, they were &quot;proven&quot; to be witches and often burnt. Castle Homburg is a historic site of witchcraft trials. During a trial on 14 September 1631, for example, six women were accused of practicing witchcraft. Because they confessed, they were given &quot;mercy&quot; and beheaded instead of being burnt alive.

===Churches===
The 1000-year-old church next to the castle in Nümbrecht is one of the most interesting sacred buildings in the area: the tower was built in Romanesque style, the romanesque part of the interior features massive medieval pillars and reinforcing arches. The ribbed structure of the apses is typical of Gothic style. Flat vaults were added at the end of the 17th century. The top construction of the tower and the altar reflects Baroque architecture.

The church &quot;Bunte Kerke&quot; in Marienberghausen features medieval wall paintings. The building was changed and reconstructed several times and thus lost its original appearance of a typical fortified church. The west tower is all that is left of the original 12th-century building. The late Gothic paintings in the interior are preserved however. The paintings were painted over during the Protestant Reformation period and only resurfaced when the organ was renovated in 1910. Only a couple of gothic wall paintings in the area have been preserved to this day.
===Marienberghausen===

In both 1969 and 1991, Marienberghausen won the German federal competition &quot;Unser Dorf soll schöner werden&quot; (&quot;Our village shall become more beautiful&quot;). It is also the birthplace of the opera &quot;Hänsel and Gretel&quot;, composed here by Engelbert Humperdinck and also first performed here.

===Mail coach===

The &quot;Oberbergische Postkutsche&quot;, a mail coach, runs between Nümbrecht and Wiehl every Friday, Saturday and Sunday from May to the end of October. It is a reproduction of the mail coach of the Imperial Post Office from approximately 1871.

===Homburg Castle===

===Health resort park===

====Column well in the health resort park====

The column well fountain in the health resort park was created by sculptor Michael Schwarze. It was built for the horticultural show (&quot;Landesgartenschau&quot;) held in Nürmbrecht in 1974. The figures of the well symbolize the age-old will of humans to free themselves from obligations of life.
The female figures are the symbols of beauty and fertility, while the fists express force and assertiveness. The hand is an indication of understanding and work. The male leg stands for progress and conquest.

====Berlin place====
The Berlin bear is a present of the Senate of Berlin. He was put up shortly before the land garden show in 1974 in the health resort park. Berlin citizens could spend a free vacation in Nümbrecht, as promoted by the county of North Rhine-Westphalia.
====Special supplies of the health resort====
* Light festival in the health resort park, always on the 2nd week-end in July
* Christmas art market, the last week-end before the 1st Advent
* Health resort concerts in the health resort hall or Rhine Sieg Clinic (Rhein-Sieg-Klinik, named after the two rivers), Sunday 15.00 o&#x27;clock

==Industry==
In the municipality, the three industrial zones are namely in Elsenroth, Gaderoth and Breunfeld. The most different companies reside there.

The biggest employer in municipality is the SARSTEDT Verwaltungs AG with factories in the villages of Rommelsdorf and Winterborn. The company develops, produces and sells machines and consumable materials for medicine and science. It was founded in 1961 and now employs 2,250 people worldwide.

<doc id="841986" wikidata="Q2426218" url="?curid=841986" title="Modernism (music)">
<text>In music, modernism is an aesthetic stance underlying the period of change and development in musical language that occurred around the turn of the 20th century, a period of diverse reactions in challenging and reinterpreting older categories of music, innovations that led to new ways of organizing and approaching harmonic, melodic, sonic, and rhythmic aspects of music, and changes in aesthetic worldviews in close relation to the larger identifiable period of modernism in the arts of the time. The operative word most associated with it is &quot;innovation&quot;. Its leading feature is a &quot;linguistic plurality&quot;, which is to say that no musical language, or modernist style, ever assumed a dominant position.

 Examples include the celebration of Arnold Schoenberg&#x27;s rejection of tonality in chromatic post-tonal and twelve-tone works and Igor Stravinsky&#x27;s move away from symmetrical rhythm.

Authorities typically regard musical modernism as an historical period or era extending from about 1890 to 1930, and apply the term &quot;postmodernism&quot; to the period or era after 1930. For the musicologist Carl Dahlhaus the purest form was over by 1910. However, there are other historians and critics who argue that modernism was revived after World War II. For example, Paul Griffiths notes that, while Modernism &quot;seemed to be a spent force&quot; by the late 1920s, after World War II, &quot;a new generation of composers—Boulez, Barraqué, Babbitt, Nono, Stockhausen, Xenakis&quot; revived modernism&quot;.

==Definitions==

Carl Dahlhaus describes modernism as: an obvious point of historical discontinuity ... The &quot;breakthrough&quot; of Mahler, Strauss, and Debussy implies a profound historical transformation ... If we were to search for a name to convey the breakaway mood of the 1890s (a mood symbolized musically by the opening bars of Strauss&#x27;s &quot;Don Juan&quot;) but without imposing a fictitious unity of style on the age, we could do worse than revert to Hermann Bahr&#x27;s term &quot;modernism&quot; and speak of a stylistically open-ended &quot;modernist music&quot; extending (with some latitude) from 1890 to the beginnings of our own twentieth-century modern music in 1910.

Eero Tarasti defines musical modernism directly in terms of &quot;the dissolution of the traditional tonality and transformation of the very foundations of tonal language, searching for new models in atonalism, polytonalism or other forms of altered tonality&quot;, which took place around the turn of the century.

Daniel Albright proposes a definition of musical modernism as, &quot;a testing of the limits of aesthetic construction&quot; and presents the following modernist techniques or styles: Expressionism, the New Objectivity, Hyperrealism, Abstractionism, Neoclassicism, Neobarbarism, Futurism, and the Mythic Method.

Conductor and scholar Leon Botstein describes musical modernism as &quot;...a consequence of the fundamental conviction among successive generations of composers since 1900 that the means of musical expression in the 20th century must be adequate to the unique and radical character of the age&quot;, which led to a reflection in the arts of the progress of science, technology and industry, mechanization, urbanization, mass culture and nationalism.

Similarly, Eric Pietro defines Modernism in his narrative &quot;Listening In: Music, Mind, and the Modernist&quot; as, “…a desire to find ‘ever more accurate representations of psychological states and processes’ by virtue of its links with the ‘historical crisis of the nineteenth century.’” From what we can understand with this information, there are two distinguishable concepts emphasizing Modernism: the first being music mirroring narrative depictions of the mind; and the second being music as a vocabulary that faces the possibility of describing psychological behaviors in language.

==Other usage==
The term &quot;modernism&quot; (and the term &quot;post-modern&quot;) has occasionally been applied to some genres of popular music, but not with any very clear definition.

For example, the cultural studies professor Andrew Goodwin writes that &quot;given the confusion of the terms, the identification of postmodern texts has ranged across an extraordinarily divergent, and incoherent profusion of textual instances ... Secondly, there are debates within popular music about pastiche and authenticity. &#x27;Modernism&#x27; means something quite different within each of these two fields ... This confusion is obvious in an early formative attempt to understand rock music in postmodern terms&quot;. Goodwin argues that instances of modernism in popular music are generally not cited because &quot;it &quot;undermines&quot; the postmodern thesis of cultural fusion, in its explicit effort to preserve a bourgeois notion of Art in opposition to mainstream, &#x27;commercial&#x27; rock and pop&quot;.

Author Domenic Priore writes that: &quot;the concept of Modernism was bound up in the very construction of the Greater Los Angeles area, at a time when the city was just beginning to come into its own as an international, cultural center&quot;,; it appears that the word is used here as an equivalent of the term &quot;modern&quot;. Priore cites &quot;River Deep – Mountain High&quot; by Ike &amp; Tina Turner (1966) and &quot;Good Vibrations&quot; by the Beach Boys (1966). Desiring &quot;a taste of Modern, avant-garde R&amp;B&quot; for the latter&#x27;s recording, group member and song co-writer Brian Wilson considered the music &quot;advanced rhythm and blues&quot;, but received criticism from his bandmates, who derided the track for being &quot;too Modern&quot; during its making.

==History==

===Early Modernism===


In the final decade leading up to the turn of the 20th century, the Romantic era in music had entered into its late period where great changes were occurring. 
Amongst the biggest changes were with the traditional tonal system, which was now being regularly stretched to its limits by composers such as Gustav Mahler who began incorporating progressive tonality into his pieces. The Impressionists such as Claude Debussy also began experimenting with ambiguous tonality and exotic scales. &quot;The perception of Debussy’s compositional language as decidedly post-romantic/Impressionistic—nuanced, understated, and subtle—is firmly solidified among today’s musicians and well-informed audiences.&quot; Although this isn’t the first time composers began pushing the limits of tonality as can be seen in the works of Richard Wagner in Tristan und Isolde and in the works of Franz Liszt in Bagatelle sans tonalité, these practices became far more commonplace within the late romantic period. This break with tonality finally came to a critical point in 1908 when Arnold Schoenberg composed the second string quartet, Op. 10, with soprano. The last movement of this piece contains no key signature, marking a decisive transition point from Romanticism into Modernism.

Within this newly established Modernist era, several new parallel movements were founded as a reaction against late romanticism. The most prominent of these movements included Expressionism with Arnold Schoenberg and the Second Viennese School being its main promoters, Primitivism with Igor Stravinsky being its most influential composer, and Futurism with Luigi Russolo being one of its main proponents.

Musical expressionism is closely associated with the music of the Second Viennese School during their &quot;free atonal&quot; period from 1908 to 1921. One of the main goals of this movement was to avoid &quot;traditional forms of beauty&quot; to convey powerful feelings in their music. 
In essence, Expressionist music often features a high level of dissonance, extreme contrasts of dynamics, constant changing of textures, &quot;distorted&quot; melodies and harmonies, and angular melodies with wide leaps.

Primitivism was a movement that aimed to rescue the most archaic folklore of certain regions with a modern or modernist language. Similar to nationalism in its eagerness to rescue the local traditions, primitivism also incorporated irregular metrics and accentuations, a greater use of percussion and other timbres, modal scales, and polytonal harmony. Important works of this style include &quot;The Firebird&quot; (1910), &quot;Petrushka&quot; (1911), &quot;The Rite of Spring&quot; (1913), and &quot;The Miraculous Mandarin&quot; (1926). Within this movement, the two giants of this movement were the Russian Igor Stravinsky and the Hungarian Béla Bartók, although the work of both far exceeds the name &quot;primitivist&quot;.

Italian composers such as Francesco Balilla Pratella and Luigi Russolo aided in developing musical Futurism. This genre attempts to recreate everyday sounds and place them within a &quot;Futurist&quot; context. The &quot;Machine Music&quot; of George Antheil (starting with his Second Sonata, &quot;The Airplane&quot;) and Alexander Mosolov (most notoriously his &quot;Iron Foundry&quot;) developed from this. 

The process of extending musical vocabulary by exploring all available tones was pushed further by the use of Microtones. This can be seen in works of composers such as Charles Ives, Julián Carrillo, Alois Hába, John Foulds, Ivan Wyschnegradsky, Harry Partch and Mildred Couper. Microtones are intervals that are smaller than a semitone; human voices and unfretted strings can easily produce them by going in between the &quot;normal&quot; notes, however other musical instruments will have more difficulty in achieving the same result. The piano and organ have no way of producing them at all, aside from retuning or from major reconstruction.

In the United States, Charles Ives began to integrate American and European traditions as well as colloquial and church styles, while using innovative techniques in his harmony, rhythm, and form. His techniques included the use of polyrhythm, polytonality, tone clusters, quarter tones. and aleatoric elements. This new experimental style of composition influenced a number of American composers who came to be collectively known as the American Five.

In the early 1920s, Schoenberg developed the Twelve-tone technique, a method of musical composition which ensures that all 12 notes of the chromatic scale are sounded as often as one another in a composition while preventing the emphasis of any one note through the use of tone rows and the orderings of the 12 pitch classes. This new technique was quickly adopted by members of the Second Viennese School, namely Anton Webern who refined the system and became a massive influence to the development of Serialism.

After the end of World War I, Igor Stravinsky began to return to past Pre-Romantic compositional traditions for inspiration and wrote works that drew elements such as form, harmony, melody, structure from it. This style of music came to be known as Neoclassicism and it came to be the dominent style of composition during the Interwar period. Important works in this style includes; &quot;Pulcinella&quot;, &quot;Classical Symphony&quot;, &quot;Le Tombeau de Couperin&quot;, &quot;El retablo de maese Pedro&quot;, and &quot;&quot;. A prominent group of mostly French composers known as Les Six were especially influenced by this compositional method. 

A similar movement also took hold in Post-War Germany as a reaction against the sentimentality of late Romanticism and the emotional agitation of expressionism. Known as New Objectivity, this model of composition typically harkened back to baroque era models and made use of traditional forms as well as stable polyphonic structures, combined together with modern dissonance and jazz-inspired rhythms. Paul Hindemith was the most prominent composer of this style.

The 1930s proved to be a difficult time for the Modernist music scene in Europe after Adolf Hitler and the Nazi Party took power in Germany and the Austrofascists took power in Austria. As a result, most Modernist music
which featured atonality, dissonance, and “disturbing rhythms” were deemed as degenerate music and banned. The music of Alban Berg, Hans Eisler, Paul Hindemith, Arnold Schoenberg, Anton von Webern, Kurt Weill, and other formerly prominent composers, as well as Jewish composers such as Felix Mendelssohn, Giacomo Meyerbeer, Jacques Offenbach and even George Gershwin and Irving Berlin, were no longer programmed or allowed to be performed. As a result of these new policies, many prominent Modernist composers such as Arnold Schoenberg and Igor Stravinsky were forced to flee to the United States while others such as Anton Webern were forced to compose their works in secret.

===High Modernism===


World War II was devastating for Europe and a new generation of composers had to pick up the pieces and reestablish the art music scene. Through the rediscovery and promotion of pre-war composers such as Anton Webern and Edgard Varèse, as well as the more recent developments initiated by the French composer Olivier Messiaen, Serialism came to be one of the 
dominant methods of composition within the art music establishment for the next few decades. Also influenced by other pioneering works of the Second Viennese School, starting in 1946, the Darmstädter Ferienkurse began an annual summer program in Darmstadt, Germany where Modernist forms of classical music were taught and promoted. Among the most important composers to emerge from these courses included Pierre Boulez, Bruno Maderna, Luigi Nono, and Karlheinz Stockhausen. Together, this group collectivley came to be known as the Darmstadt School. Among their primary goals was to reestablish and expand upon the serialist philosophies established by the likes of Arnold Schoenberg and Anton Webern. Igor Stravinsky was also encouraged to explore serial music and the composers of the Second Viennese School, beginning Stravinsky&#x27;s third and final distinct musical period, which lasted from 1954 until his death in 1971. However, some more traditionally based composers such as Dmitri Shostakovich and Benjamin Britten maintained a tonal style of composition despite the prominent serialist movement.

The United States took a somewhat different direction to Modernism in comparison to their European counterparts in the early post-war era. American composers including John Cage, Morton Feldman, Earle Brown and Christian Wolff formed an informal circle musicians called the New York School. This group was far less concerned in working with serialism but rather focused on experimenting with chance. Their compositions influenced the music and events of the Fluxus group, and drew its name from Abstract Expressionist painters. However, composers such as Milton Babbitt, George Rochberg, and Roger Sessions fashioned their own extensions of the twelve-tone serialism of Schoenberg.

One of the most important and influential developments from the Modernist music scene in America was the concept of indeterminacy in music. Spearheaded by John Cage, this new composition approach left some aspects of a musical work open to chance or to the interpreter&#x27;s free choice. This can be seen in Cage’s Music of Changes (1951), where the composer selects the duration, tempo, and dynamics by using the &quot;I Ching&quot;, an ancient Chinese book which prescribes methods for arriving at random numbers. Another example is Morton Feldman&#x27;s &quot;Intersection No. 2&quot; (1951) for piano solo, written on coordinate paper. Time units are represented by the squares viewed horizontally, while relative pitch levels of high, middle, and low are indicated by three vertical squares in each row. The performer determines what particular pitches and rhythms to play.

In Europe, a similar method of composition developed. Coined as &quot;aleatory music&quot; by Meyer-Eppler and popularized by the French composer Pierre Boulez, this new compositional style did not completely give away its creation and performance to chance but rather the notated events are provided by the composer, but their arrangement is left to the determination of the performer. A prominent example of this style can be seen in Karlheinz Stockhausen&#x27;s work Klavierstück XI (1956) where the nineteen events presented are composed and notated in a traditional way, but the arrangement of these events is determined by the performer spontaneously during the performance. Another example can be seen in Earle Brown&#x27;s &quot;Available forms II&quot; (1962), where the conductor is asked to decide the order of the events at the very moment of the performance.

Major developments were also taking shape in Electronic music shortly after the end of World War II. In the late 1940s, acoustic engineer and radio scientist Pierre Schaeffer created a new style of composition called Musique concrète where recorded sounds are utilized as raw material. These recorded sounds are often modified through the application of audio signal processing and tape music techniques, and may be assembled into a form of sound collage. Schaeffer’s pioneering works attracted and inspired a new generation of composers such as Olivier Messiaen, Karlheinz Stockhausen, Iannis Xenakis, Pierre Boulez, as well as others to try their hands into this new world and develop their own innovations.

Building upon aleatoric elements and electronic components, mathematics and scientific concepts were incorporated to produce Stochastic music. Pioneered by the works of Greek composer Iannis Xenakis, important examples of compositions drawing from concepts in physical science includes; the use of the statistical mechanics of gases in &quot;Pithoprakta&quot;, minimal constraints in &quot;Achorripsis&quot;, Markov chains in &quot;Analogiques&quot;, statistical distribution of points onto a plane in &quot;Diamorphoses&quot;, the use of normal distribution in &quot;ST/10&quot; and &quot;Atrées&quot;, Brownian motion in &quot;N&#x27;Shima&quot;, game theory in &quot;Duel&quot; and &quot;Stratégie&quot;, the group theory in &quot;Nomos Alpha&quot; (for Siegfried Palm), and set theory in &quot;Herma&quot; and &quot;Eonta&quot;. Xenakis also frequently used computers to produce his compositions, such as the &quot;ST&quot; series including &quot;Morsima-Amorsima&quot; and &quot;Atrées&quot;. American composers such as Lejaren Hiller and Leonard Issacson also used generative grammars and Markov chains in their 1957 &quot;Illiac Suite&quot;.

Starting around 1944, Elliott Carter began to incorporate processes into his compositions such as in his Piano Sonata and First String Quartet. Essentially notes through pitch and time were stretched into a long term change with limited transformations of musical events. This new compositional style came to be known as Process music and would become adopted by serialists during the 1960s. Minimalists would also come to embrase this approach in the coming decade. Other prominent examples of works that incorporate processes includes; &quot;Nr. 5, met zuivere tonen&quot; (1953), &quot;Kreuzspiel&quot; (1951), &quot;Plus-Minus&quot; (1963), &quot;Prozession&quot; (1967), &quot;It&#x27;s Gonna Rain&quot; (1965), &quot;Come Out&quot; (1966), and &quot;Reed Phase &quot;(1966).

===Late Modernism and Postmodernism===
In 1977, French composer Pierre Boulez founded the Institut de Recherche et Coordination Acoustique / Musique (IRCAM) whose aims included research into acoustics, instrumental design, and the use of computers in music. Spectralism, which originally arose in France during the early 1970s, had received much of its development and refinement through this institution. The composition of spectral music was often informed by sonographic representations and mathematical analysis of sound spectra, or by mathematically generated spectra. This new style also arose in part as a reaction against and an alternative to the primarily pitch focused aesthetics of the serialist and post-serialist compositions that were commonplace for the time. The two most prominent schools in spectral music were the French Ensemble l&#x27;Itinéraire headed by Gérard Grisey and Tristan Murail and the German Feedback group headed by Péter Eötvös and Claude Vivier. Likewise, spectral techniques would soon be adopted by a wider variety of composers such as Magnus Lindberg and Kaija Saariaho.

In the United Kingdom, a loose group of composers began writing scores in an increasingly complex musical notation that was often atonal, highly abstract, and dissonant in sound. Coined as New Complexity, earliest prominent mention being from Richard Toop’s article &quot;Four Facets of the New Complexity&quot;, this new style gained traction in continental Europe, particularly through the Darmstädter Ferienkurse in the 1980s and 1990s. The most influential figures of this movement were Brian Ferneyhough and Michael Finnissy. 

During the 1960s and 1970s, a backlash began to emerge against the strict serialism promoted by groups such as the Darmstadt School which had essentially taken over the academic musical establishment. In America, a new form of art music called Minimal music had emerged as a reaction against the perceived extreme and unsurpassable complexity of serialism. Instead minimal music focuses on the repetition of slowly changing common chords in steady rhythms, often overlaid with a lyrical melody in long, arching phrases.

Europe also experienced a similar backlash against strict serialism as can be seen in the emergence of the New Simplicity movement spearheaded by composers such as Wolfgang Rihm. In general, these composers strove for an immediacy between the creative impulse and the musical result, which contrasts with the elaborate precompositional planning characteristic of the High Modernists. Some writers argue that Darmstadt School representative Karlheinz Stockhausen, had anticipated this reaction through a radical simplification of his style accomplished between 1966 and 1975, which culminated in his &quot;Tierkreis&quot; melodies.

==Movements and schools==

===Impressionism===


Impressionism was a movement among various composers in Western classical music from about 1890 to 1920, whose music focuses on mood and atmosphere. Just like Impressionism in painting and Impressionism in literature, musical impressionism tries to represent impressions of moments. The most prominent feature of impressionist music is the timbre and instrumentation. Layerings of musical levels are typical but also includes: a profound but not intrusive bass, moving middle voices and a significant motif in the upper voices, and is not subject to the laws of the usual classical-romantic processing (diminution, secession, etc.) but is treated rather associatively. The most noteworthy composers of this movement includes Claude Debussy, Erik Satie, and Maurice Ravel.

===Expressionism===


Expressionism was a movement in music where composers sought a subjective immediacy of expression, drawn as directly as possible from the human soul. To achieve this, a break with tradition in regards to traditional aesthetics and the previous forms was desired. Stylistically, the changed function of dissonances is particularly striking; they appear on an equal footing with consonances and are no longer resolved – what was also called the &quot;emancipation of dissonance&quot;. The tonal system is largely dissolved and expanded into atonality. Musical characteristics include: extreme pitches, extreme dynamic contrasts (from whispering to screaming, from &quot;pppp&quot; to &quot;ffff&quot;), jagged melody lines with wide leaps; metrically unbound, free rhythm and novel instrumentation. Form: asymmetrical period structure; rapid succession of contrasting moments; often very short &quot;aphoristic&quot; pieces. The main representatives of this movement are the composers of the Second Viennese School: Arnold Schoenberg, Anton Webern and Alban Berg.

===Second Viennese School===
The Second Viennese School were a group of composers consisting of Arnold Schoenberg and his pupils, most notably Alban Berg and Anton Webern, as well as close associates in early 20th-century Vienna. Their music was initially characterized by late-Romantic expanded tonality. However their compositional style would evolve to a totally chromatic expressionism without a firm tonal center, often referred to as atonality. Even later on beginning in the early 1920s, this group would adopt Schoenberg&#x27;s serial twelve-tone technique. Greatly promoted by critics and musicologists such as Theodor Adorno, the music of the Second Viennese School would take over in intellectual circles and the art music establishment especially after the conclusion of WW2.

===Primitivism===


Primitivism was a movement that aimed to incorporate the most archaic and often pagan folklore of certain regions in Europe into modernist musical compositions. Similar to nationalism in its eagerness to rescue the local traditions, primitivism also incorporated irregular metrics and accentuations, a greater use of percussion and other timbres, modal scales, and polytonal harmony. Within this movement, the most prominent composers were the Russian Igor Stravinsky and the Hungarian Béla Bartók, although the work of both far exceeds the name &quot;primitivist&quot;.

===Futurism===


Futurism was a movement originating in Italy which rejected tradition and introduced experimental sounds inspired by machinery. Much of this new genre’s origins can be traced to painter and composer Luigi Russolo, who in 1913 published his groundbreaking manifesto, &quot;The Art of Noises&quot;, calling for the incorporation of noises of every kind into music. This inspired fellow Italian composers Francesco Balilla Pratella and Franco Casavola to follow in his footsteps. This new aesthetic also became quickly embraced by the Russian avant-garde creating a parallel movement of Russian Futurists. Among the most prominent Russian composers from this tradition includes Mikhail Matyushin and Nikolai Roslavets.

===American Five===


The American Five were a group of American experimental composers who often implemented polyrhythm, polytonality, tone clusters, quarter tones. and aleatoric elements within their music. Spearheaded by Charles Ives, they were noted for their unusual and often dissonant pieces which broke away from European compositional techniques to create a uniquely American style. The primary members of this group were Charles Ives, John J. Becker, Wallingford Riegger, Henry Cowell, and Carl Ruggles.

===Neoclassicism===


Neoclassicism was a movement, especially prevalent during the interwar period, in which composers sought to return to aesthetic precepts associated with the broadly defined concept of &quot;classicism&quot;, namely order, balance, clarity, economy, and emotional restraint. As such, neoclassicism was a reaction against the unrestrained emotionalism and perceived formlessness of late Romanticism, as well as a &quot;call to order&quot; after the experimental ferment of the first two decades of the twentieth century. The neoclassical impulse found its expression in such features as the use of pared-down performing forces, an emphasis on rhythm and on contrapuntal texture, an updated or expanded tonal harmony, and a concentration on absolute music as opposed to Romantic program music. The main representatives of this movement are Igor Stravinsky and Sergei Prokofiev.

===Les Six===
 

Les Six were a group of six composers, five of them French and one Swiss, who primarily worked in the Montparnasse region of Paris, France. Composing in the neoclassical style of Igor Stravinsky, their music was often seen as a reaction against both the late German Romanticism of Gustav Mahler and the Impressionistic chromaticism of Claude Debussy. They were also heavily inspired by the music of Erik Satie and the poetry of Jean Cocteau. The primary members of this group were Georges Auric, Louis Durey, Arthur Honegger, Darius Milhaud, Francis Poulenc, and Germaine Tailleferre.

===Darmstadt School===


The Darmstadt School refers to a group of composers who were associated with the Darmstädter Ferienkurse from the 1950s and 1960s centered in Darmstadt, Germany. Greatly influenced by Arnold Schoenberg&#x27;s twelve-tone technique, they developed it further to implement Integral Serialism as the foundation to their compositions. They also often applied electroacoustic and aleatoric techniques into their works. Other key influences of the School included the works of Anton Webern, Edgard Varèse, and Olivier Messiaen&#x27;s &quot;Mode de valeurs et d&#x27;intensités&quot; (from the &quot;Quatre études de rythme&quot;). The most prominent composers include Pierre Boulez, Bruno Maderna, Luigi Nono, and Karlheinz Stockhausen.

===New York School===
The New York School was an informal circle of experimental musicians and composers active in the 1950s and 1960s originating from New York City. They often drew inspiration from the Dada and contemporary avant-garde art movements. Their music often displayed indeterminacy, electroacoustic properties, and non-standard use of musical instruments. They were in particular greatly influenced by the pioneering experimental works of Charles Ives, Henry Cowell, and Edgard Varèse. The most prominent composers of this compositional school include John Cage, Earle Brown, Christian Wolff, Morton Feldman, and David Tudor.

==Methods and genres==

===Atonality===
===Twelve-tone technique===


The twelve-tone technique is a method of musical composition developed by Austrian composer Arnold Schoenberg where all 12 notes of the chromatic scale are sounded as often as one another in a piece of music while preventing the emphasis of any one note through the use of tone rows, orderings of the 12 pitch classes. All 12 notes are thus given more or less equal importance, and the music avoids being in a key. Schoenberg’s technique would first be adopted by other members of the Second Viennese School, most notably Alban Berg and Anton Webern. However its usage would greatly expand after WW2 through its promotion by the Darmstadt School, American composers such as Milton Babbitt, and its adoption by Igor Stravinsky after phasing out of his Neoclassical period in the early 1950s.

===Serialism===
Serialism is a method of composition in which a fixed series of notes, usually the twelve notes of the chromatic scale, are used to generate the harmonic and melodic basis of a piece and are subject to change only in specific ways. Serialism began primarily with Arnold Schoenberg&#x27;s twelve-tone technique, though some of his contemporaries were also working to establish serialism as a form of post-tonal thinking. Serialism of the pre-WW2 Second Viennese School was composed in which a recurring series of ordered elements (normally a set—or row—of pitches or pitch classes) is used in order or manipulated in particular ways to give a piece unity. In post-WW2 Europe, Integral serialism which was developed mainly by the Darmstadt School, incorporated use of series for aspects such as duration, dynamics, and register as well as pitch. The most prominent composers of this compositional technique include Arnold Schoenberg, Anton Webern, Alban Berg, Karlheinz Stockhausen, Pierre Boulez, Luigi Nono, Milton Babbitt, Igor Stravinsky, Henri Pousseur, Charles Wuorinen and Jean Barraqué.

===Musique concrète===


Musique concrète (French; &quot;concrete music&quot;), is a form of electroacoustic music that utilises recorded sounds as a compositional resource. The compositional material is commonly modified through the application of audio signal processing and tape music techniques, and can be assembled into a sound collage structure. The theoretical basis of this compositional practice was developed by French composer Pierre Schaeffer beginning in the early 1940s. Other prominent composers who used or were influenced by this compositional technique include Pierre Henry, Luc Ferrari, Pierre Boulez, Karlheinz Stockhausen, Edgard Varèse, and Iannis Xenakis.

===Indeterminacy===
 

Indeterminacy in music is a compositional method in which some or all aspects of a musical work are left either to chance or to the performer’s free choice. Its first significant adoption can be attributed to the works of American composer Charles Ives written in the early 20th century. Ives’s ideas were further developed in the 1930s by Henry Cowell in such works as the Mosaic Quartet (String Quartet No. 3, 1934), which players are allowed to arrange the music fragments in a number of different possible sequences. During the 1950s, development of this technique reached its apex in the works of John Cage and the New York School where chance becomes adopted by a wide range of composers. 

===Aleatoric music===
Aleatoric music is a compositional style in which some element of a composed work is left to indeterminacy, or in other words left to the determination of the performer(s). The term became known to European composers through the lectures of acoustician Werner Meyer-Eppler at the Darmstädter Ferienkurse in the early 1950s. Unlike their American counterparts however, many European composers did not completely leave the performance of their works to chance. Instead, they would compose and notate several separate paths within their music in which the performer is given the freedom to choose the arrangement. The most prominent composers of this style include Pierre Boulez, Karlheinz Stockhausen, and Iannis Xenakis.

===Stochastic music===
 

Stochastic music is a compositional style pioneered by Greek composer Iannis Xenakis in which mathematical processes often found within statistics, probability, and physics are used to generate scores. Stochastic processes can also be used in compositions to create a fixed notation in the piece or alternatively being produced in real time during a performance. Computers were also frequently used to produce this type of music. The most prominent composers of this style includes Iannis Xenakis, Gottfried Michael Koenig, Jean-Claude Risset, and Lejaren Hiller.

===Process music===
Process music is a compositional style in which a score is generated using a process that’s either audible to the audience or deliberately concealed. These processes can involve specific systems of picking and organizing notes through pitch and time, often involving a long term change with a limited amount of musical material, or transformations of musical events that are already relatively complex in an of themselves. Originating in serial compositions, this style also came to be widely adopted later on by the minimalists. Prominent composers of this style includes Karlheinz Stockhausen, Elliott Carter, Karel Goeyvaerts, and Steve Reich.

<doc id="841990" wikidata="Q5419665" url="?curid=841990" title="Exclosure">
<text>An exclosure, in an area being used extensively for grazing, is a limited area from which unwanted browsing animals, such as domestic cattle or wildlife such as deer, are excluded by fencing or other means.

==Environmental protection==
Most commonly, exclosures are areas that are set aside for regreening. Wood harvesting and livestock range are not allowed there. 
=== Effects on environment ===
The establishment of an exclosure has positive effects on:
* biodiversity 
* water infiltration
* protection from flooding
* sediment deposition
* carbon sequestration

=== Economic benefits ===
In developing countries, people commonly have economic benefits from these exclosures through grass harvesting, beekeeping and other non-timber forest products. The local inhabitants also consider it as “land set aside for future generations”. 
=== Carbon credits ===
Exclosures have as an additional benefit that the surrounding communities may receive carbon credits for the sequestered CO2, as part of a carbon offset programme. 
In the Tigray Region, in Ethiopia, several exclosures are managed by the EthioTrees project. The revenues are then reinvested in the villages, according to the priorities of the communities; it may be for an additional class in the village school, a water pond, conservation in the exclosures, or a store for incense. 

==Range management==
Exclosures are sometimes constructed by government agencies that manage livestock use on public lands—a practice in which private owners of cattle pay, though often only a nominal sum, for the right to graze their livestock on the public lands.

==Experimental sites==
One purpose of the exclosure is to determine how the area would develop (in biodiversity, vegetation height, ecological characteristics, etc.) if grazing were not conducted.

==Protection of humans==
Another purpose is to demarcate an area safe for humans by excluding potentially deadly animals. For example, a beach may have a shark net around it to prevent sharks from attacking human swimmers. Another example is at wild animal preserves which provide fenced in areas for humans to safely watch lions, tigers, or other large predators.

<doc id="841991" wikidata="Q970283" url="?curid=841991" title="Ford Zephyr">
<text>The Ford Zephyr is an executive car manufactured by Ford of Britain from 1950 until 1972. The Zephyr and its luxury variants, the Ford Zodiac and Ford Executive, were the largest passenger cars in the British Ford range from 1950 until their replacement by the Consul and Granada models in 1972.

Initially, the four-cylinder version was named Ford Consul, but from 1962, both four- and six-cylinder versions were named Zephyr.

==History==
The Mark I Ford Consul and Zephyr models were first displayed at the Earls Court Motor Show in 1950. They were the first mass-produced British cars to use the MacPherson strut independent front suspension, which is widely used today. Production began with the Consul on 1 January 1951. The Mark I model ran until 1956. From April 1956, the Mark II Consul, Zephyr, and Zodiac went on sale and were known as the Three Graces. The Mark II range was popular, and finished its run in 1962, when from April that year the Mark III Zephyr 4, Zephyr 6, and Zodiac went on sale. The Consul name was dropped, with the car&#x27;s place in the Ford UK line-up being filled by the first four-cylinder Ford Zephyr. While the Mark II Zephyr and Zodiacs had shared the same body (the Consul had shorter front guards and bulkhead), the new Zodiac and Zephyrs launched in 1962 shared few body panels. With the Mark III, Ford finally sorted out problems that had beset previous models (Mark I axles and Mark II gearboxes were particular weaknesses) and the Mark III proved to be popular and the most durable of the range. The model sold at a rate equal to or better than the Mark II, both in the UK and overseas, but was in production for a shorter time. During the last months of production, an upmarket Executive version was added to the Mark III range. The Mk III range was discontinued in January 1966, and the completely new Zephyr/Zodiac Mark IV range was released in April 1966. This car&#x27;s design anticipated the later Consul/Granada range with V-type engines and independent rear suspension, but the development of the model was rushed, which was reflected in its durability. It was one of the first medium-priced cars to feature rear disc brakes.

The Zephyr was the last car to be independently designed by Ford of Britain; closer integration with Ford-Werke of Cologne had already started with both the Transit and Escort, and the replacement Consul/Granada would be a genuine pan-European effort.

Although the Ford Zephyr never saw American production, a very limited number were imported into the U.S., and the name itself has appeared on other American Ford-related cars. The first use of the Zephyr name was in 1936 with the Lincoln Zephyr, a smaller companion to the full-sized Lincoln sedan sold at the time, followed in the late 1970s with the Mercury Zephyr, an upscale version of the Ford Fairmont. The Lincoln Zephyr name was resurrected for a new model in 2006, but was changed to Lincoln MKZ the following year.

==Mark I==

===Zephyr Six (or &quot;Zephyr Mark I&quot;)===

;Model number EOTTA

The first of the Zephyr range was a lengthened version of the four-cylinder Consul, with a six-cylinder engine producing . Like the Consul, the Zephyr came with a three-speed gearbox, controlled by a column-mounted lever (three-on-the-tree). The front suspension design employed what later came to be known as MacPherson struts while a more conventional configuration for the rear suspension used a live axle with half-elliptical springs. The car could reach just over and 23 mpg.

The Ford Zephyr Six was available with four-door saloon, estate, and two-door convertible bodies. The convertible version was made by Carbodies and had a power-operated hood; the estate car was by Abbotts of Farnham and was sold as the Farnham.

In addition to the main British Ford factory in Dagenham, the Consul and Zephyr were assembled at Ford New Zealand&#x27;s Seaview factory in Lower Hutt from knock-down kits. The large Fords competed with the also locally built Vauxhall Wyvern and Velox, and later the Australian Holden. When newly crowned Queen Elizabeth II visited New Zealand as part of a Commonwealth tour in the early 1950s, she was pictured watching Zephyrs being built at the local Ford plant.
The Consul and Zephyr were also assembled at the Cork plant in Ireland from 1951 to 1956.

In 1953, a Ford Zephyr Six driven by Maurice Gatsonides won the Monte Carlo rally, pushing a Jaguar Mark VII into second place in the process. Two years later, a Ford Zephyr Six driven by Vic Preston (Snr) and D P Marwaha won the East African Safari Rally.

A saloon tested by &quot;The Motor&quot; in 1951 had a top speed of and could accelerate from 0– in 20.2 seconds. A fuel consumption of was recorded. The test car cost £842 including taxes, but was fitted with optional leather trim, heater, and radio.

===Zephyr Zodiac (or Zodiac Mark I)===

;Model number EOTTA

The Zephyr Zodiac (or Zodiac Mark I) was an upmarket version of the Zephyr launched at the London Motor Show in autumn 1953. It had two-tone paintwork, leather trim, a heater, windscreen washers, whitewall tyres, and spot lights. The engine had a higher compression ratio – 7.5:1 instead of 6.8:1 – increasing the maximum power to .

A car tested by &quot;The Motor&quot; in 1955 had a top speed of and could accelerate from 0- in 20.2 seconds. A fuel consumption of was recorded. The test car cost £851 including taxes.

No official records exist of Zephyr Zodiac convertibles being produced, but a few estate cars were built.

==Mark II==

===Zephyr Mark II===

;Model number 206E

In 1956, the Consul, Zephyr, and Zodiac were all restyled. The six-cylinder cars&#x27; engines were enlarged to , with power output correspondingly raised to . The wheelbase was increased by to and the width increased to . The weight distribution and turning circle were also improved. Top speed increased to , and the fuel consumption was also improved at .

The Zodiac and Zephyr were also offered in two body styles, the &quot;Highline&quot; and &quot;Lowline&quot;, depending on the year of manufacture — the difference being being cut from the height of the roof panel. The &quot;Highline&quot; variant featured a hemispherical instrument cluster, whereas the &quot;Lowline&quot; had a more rectangular panel.

The performance of the Zephyr and the Zodiac series II models likely was restricted by the rudimentary exhaust system, both the manifold assembly and the exhaust itself. The well-known Raymond Mays complete engine conversion boosted the performance figures to a top speed of 101 mph and 0–60 to 10.0s, with a standing quarter mile of 17.6s, as recorded by &quot;The Autocar&quot; in the issue dated 8 November 1957.

As well as a three-speed manual gearbox, an overdrive was optional, and from 1956 (1959 in Australia), a Borg Warner DG automatic transmission was available. At first, drum brakes were fitted all round (with a larger lining area of ), but front discs became optional in 1960 and standard from mid-1961 (in Australia, only four-wheel drum brakes were available; some dealers fitted servo-assistance from 1961).

A two-door convertible version was offered with power-operated hood. Because of the structural weaknesses inherent in the construction of convertibles, few are known to survive.

A convertible with overdrive tested by &quot;The Motor&quot; in 1961 had a top speed of and could accelerate from 0- in 17.0 seconds. A fuel consumption of was recorded. The test car cost £1193 including taxes.

====Australian production====
In Australia, the Mark II Consul, Zephyr, and Zodiac were built at Ford Australia&#x27;s factory in Geelong. Sedan, coupe utility [more commonly abbreviated to &quot;Ute&quot;], and both four-cylinder Consul and six-cylinder Zephyr station wagon versions were produced. No Zodiac version station wagons were offered. The Australian-developed Mark II Station Wagon differed from its British Estate Car counterpart in having a wind-up rear window, and a straight C pillar, rather than a curved one. A handful of Station Wagons were registered in 1958, but sales did not really commence until about halfway through 1959. Also, the Australian-designed and -developed ute version differed significantly in its cab design and rear panels to that of its British counterpart. Mark II manufacture continued until 1962, when production switched to the assembly of Mark IIIs from imported complete knock-down (CKD) kits. It had originally been planned by Ford Australia to facelift the Mark II as its main competitor to the rival Holden, but due to the exorbitant price being asked for by Ford UK for its now redundant production jigs for the Mark II, Ford Australia chose to instead locally manufacture the newly released North American Ford Falcon, which was significantly cheaper to manufacturer than the Zephyr, with the Mark III being relegated to special order only.

====New Zealand assembly====
New Zealand assembly of the Mark II, also from CKD kits, now included the Zodiac. The big Fords from Britain were now offered alongside the Australian-sourced Ford Falcon and also competed with the Vauxhall Victor and Velox, Holden, and Australia&#x27;s Chrysler Valiant. Supplies were restricted due to strict import licensing rules in place at the time, and demand always exceeded availability; not uncommonly, buyers waited two to three years for their new big Ford.

===Zodiac Mark II===

;Model number 206E

The Mark II Zodiac was slightly altered to distinguish it from the lesser variants, having more elaborate tail-end styling and at the front, a different grille. The auxiliary lamps and wing mirrors were deleted from the Zodiac range, but it retained two-tone paint, whitewall tyres, chrome wheel-trim embellishers, and gold-plated badges.

A car tested by the British magazine &quot;The Motor&quot; in 1956 had a top speed of and could accelerate from 0- in 17.1 seconds. A fuel consumption of was recorded. The test car cost £968 including taxes.
===Abbott (Farnham) Estates===


==Mark III==

===Zephyr 4 Mark III===

;Model 211E

In April 1962, Ford replaced the Consul/Zephyr/ Zodiac range with a dramatically restyled model, although it shared some of its mechanical components, as well as the basic chassis design, with the Mark II models. Rather than continue the Consul name, Ford UK decided to call its replacement Zephyr 4, the 4 indicating that it still used the four-cylinder engine from Consul 375. A four-speed manual gearbox, now with synchromesh on all ratios, was standard, with overdrive or automatic transmission available as options. Front disc brakes were standard.
During the production run, the nose styling was changed and the grille lowered. The Zephyr lettering moved from the front edge of the bonnet to below the bonnet opening and the ‘4’ badge below the grille was eliminated.

===Zephyr 6 Mark III===

;Model numbers 213E, 214E (right- and left-hand drive)

The Zephyr Mark III shared some of its mechanical components, as well as the basic chassis design, with the Mark II, but had a stronger overall body construction. The exterior was designed by Canadian Roy Brown, who had also designed the Edsel and the Cortina, though the rear of the body was inspired by a design proposal by Frua. Unlike the Zephyr 4, the Zephyr 6 had a full-width grille including the headlight surrounds; overall body length and width were the same for both Zephyr III versions. With the same displacement as before, the Mark III model had higher compression ratio, resulting in some higher output, as well as a broader torque range.
Only saloons and estate cars were made, the estate being a conversion by Abbotts of Farnham.

===Zodiac Mark III===

;Model numbers 213E, 214E

The Zodiac was an upmarket version of the Zephyr 6, but differed considerably from that model by the limousine-type rear doors, sharper roofline (with narrower C-pillar) and tail, unique grille (four headlights instead of two), exclusive bumper bars, plusher seating, and up-market upholstery, dashboard, and interior fittings. A choice of individual or bench front seats was available trimmed in leather or cloth. The front doors and bonnet panels were shared with the Zephyr 6. The Executive version had extra luxury fittings again. The 2553 cc, single-carburettor, six-cylinder engine was improved internally to increase the power output to 109 bhp and a new four-speed all synchromesh transmission with column change was fitted. The brakes, servo assisted, use discs at the front and drum at the rear.

A Mk III saloon tested by &quot;The Motor&quot; in 1962 had a top speed of and could accelerate from 0- in 13.4 seconds. A touring fuel consumption of was recorded. The test car cost £1070 including taxes on the UK market.

Ford New Zealand initially built the Zephyr 4 and 6, as well as the Zodiac, locally from CKD kits, offering only the bench front seat option finished in vinyl. Automatic transmission, introduced late in the life of the Mk II, was again available, but were a rare factory option, as most buyers chose manual. As well as the Zephyr 6, Ford NZ built a six-cylinder Zephyr Special (which replaced the 4) with a lower equipment level and deletion of the central vertical grille bar, boot lid trim strip, and other exterior brightwork, which was sold to fleet operators such as the government. The big Fords were unusual in having four-speed manual gearboxes when rivals, including Ford&#x27;s own Falcon, had only three-speed ones. Building the top luxury Zodiac model locally also gave Ford a supply advantage over key rivals such as GM&#x27;s Vauxhall, whose upmarket Cresta was not assembled locally after 1960, and once available only as a fully imported model, was much harder to obtain than the locally assembled Velox.


==Mark IV==

===Zephyr Mark IV===
;Models 3008 / 3010E
In 1961, Ford began a complete redesign on the Zephyr, under the title of &quot;Project Panda&quot;. As the car used the new V-series engines, the then traditional long bonnet concept created a problem until design engineer Harley Copp required that the car was both larger and had more internal space, and came up with the idea of placing the spare wheel ahead of the radiator on an angle. The result was a vehicle of similar dimensions to the North American Ford Fairlane.

The Mk IV range was launched, not at an October motor show, but in early 1966 with new V-format engines, the 4 having a V4 and the V6 unit. The independent suspension was aided by servo-assisted disc brakes on all wheels.

Criticism of the handling of early examples in the UK led to the fitting as standard of radial-ply tyres on the larger-engined version in place of the more conventional (in the UK at that time) cross-ply tyres with which all versions were fitted at the 1966 launch, and the retrofitting of radial-ply tyres to early examples addressed the tendency of the rear wheels to slide uncontrollably in wet weather, justifying in the process Ford&#x27;s investment in a new and relatively sophisticated rear suspension arrangement for the Mark IVs. Even after that, a contemporary nevertheless opined that the ride involved a certain amount of &#x27;float&#x27;, and reported that the nose-heavy handling called for a &#x27;strong driver&#x27;, a problem which the more expensive Zodiac and Executive versions mitigated through the fitting as a standard feature of power assisted steering. Cost constraints precluded adding power assisted steering for the Zephyr, but during its production run the steering ratio was lowered which reduced the strength needed to change direction by increasing the number of turns between locks from 5.5 to an even higher 6.4. Another production modification for the 4-cylinder Zephyr involved redesigning the valve gear in order to eliminate the need on the early Mk IVs for frequent tappet adjustments.

The size of the bonnet was emphasized by square-cut styling of the wings. A practical use was found for some of the extra space in front of the driver; the spare wheel was stored, ahead of the engine, under the bonnet, freeing up space at the other end of the car for more luggage.

Although large, the car, at least in its Zephyr form, was not particularly luxurious. Individual front seats were available at extra cost, but the standard front bench seat was described by one commentator who ran the car on a long-term test as being intended for people no taller than 5 ft 8 in (1.72 m) who have the right leg 3 inches (8 cm) shorter than the left.

An estate version of the Zephyr Mark IV was announced just in time for the London Motor Show in October 1966, though deliveries commenced only in January 1967. As with the earlier Zephyrs, volumes did not justify tooling up for estate production at the Dagenham plant, and the cars were instead built by E.D. Abbott Ltd of Farnham, based on part finished saloons received from Ford. The Mark IV Zephyr estates (like their more expensive Zodiac siblings) came with black vinyl-covered roof, a fashionable distinguishing feature of upmarket vehicles at the time: retention unchanged of the saloon&#x27;s rear light clusters attracted criticism, however, because of the way it narrowed the rear hatch opening at floor level when compared to the arrangements on the cheaper Ford Cortina estates.

====Export models====
In November 1966, the manufacturers announced a plan to introduce an &quot;export special&quot; version of the Zephyr Mk IV combining the 3.0-L engine of the Zodiac with other specifications largely following those of the existing Zephyr. This 3.0-L Zephyr was not offered by Ford on the domestic (UK) market.

This 3.0-litre model was quickly adopted by Ford New Zealand, which had originally launched the Mk IV Zephyr assembled locally from CKD kits with the 2.5-litre V6 (no Zephyr 4 this time) and received complaints it was underpowered for a country where towing boats and caravans was common. Ford New Zealand also introduced optional floor gear shift and bucket seats as an alternative to the standard column shift and bench front seat, and a large number of Zephyrs were built in this form, with other modifications, for New Zealand&#x27;s traffic police.

The Zodiac was also again assembled in New Zealand with both bench and bucket front seats and Zodiacs from about 1967 also had the walnut dashboard from the U.K. market Executive. An automatic transmission was optional with both the Zephyr and Zodiac. The local Mark IV line did not include the Zephyr Deluxe version available in the UK, was not as popular as the Mark III, and was outsold by the now much wider, locally built Australian Falcon range. Production ended in 1972, and the Consul and Granada replacements introduced in the UK were never officially imported into New Zealand.

South African Zephyrs and Zodiacs all received the 3.0-litre &quot;Export&quot; engine beginning with the 1968 model year. This also included replacing the earlier Zephyr Super with the new Zephyr de luxe, which received the dummy grille as on European cars.


=== Zodiac and Executive Mark IV===

;Models 3012E / 3022E

The Zodiac Mark IV and &quot;Executive&quot; had four headlights and an uprated V6 engine. Claimed output was 140 bhp &#x27;net&#x27; at 4,750 rpm, with of torque at 3,000 rpm. The Zodiac featured an alternator instead of a dynamo on the Zephyr, an adjustable steering column, a spare wheel in the engine compartment, a heater and &quot;Aeroflow&quot; ventilation, electric window washers, two-speed wipers, a cigar lighter, rev counter (tachometer), clock, ammeter, and reversing lights as standard.

The Zephyr/Zodiac Mark IVs with their complex independent rear suspension design represented a considerable step up when compared to the Mark III big Fords that they replaced. Ford also determined to widen the price gap between the Zephyr and Zodiac versions. In January 1967, less than a year after the car&#x27;s introduction, Ford announced that production of the Mark IVs was being cut back in response to poor sales. The announcement was accompanied by several pieces of more upbeat news about Cortina sales, and it was stressed that workers taken off Zephyr/Zodiac production would all be redeployed on the Cortina production lines.

An estate version of the Zodiac Mk IV was announced at the same time as the Zephyr equivalent, and built alongside it at Farnham. No &quot;Executive&quot; estate was built.

The &quot;Executive&quot; was an upmarket version, and had the highest specification offered by Ford to UK customers in the 1960s. Automatic transmission (the Zodiac&#x27;s four-speed manual box with overdrive being also available as a &#x27;no cost&#x27; option) along with power steering and a sunroof were standard equipment. Other standard features included fully reclining front seats, walnut fascia, full instrumentation, carpeting throughout, reversing lights, fog lamps, front inertial-reel safety belts, and a radio. The Executive was distinguishable from other models by exterior trim and name badges on the front and rear.

An automatic transmission-equipped Ford Executive was tested by Britain&#x27;s &quot;Autocar&quot; in 1967. It had a top speed of and could accelerate from 0- in 13.1 seconds. An overall fuel consumption of was recorded. By these performance criteria, the Ford betrayed its weight, but nevertheless usefully bettered the similarly sized 3.3-L-engined Vauxhall Viscount. The Ford&#x27;s recommended retail price of £1,567 exceeded the £1,483 sticker price on the Viscount.

<text>Gustav Wilhelm Hamel (25 June 1889 – missing 23 May 1914) was a pioneer British aviator. He was prominent in the early history of aviation in Britain, and in particular that of Hendon airfield, where Claude Graham-White was energetically developing and promoting flying.

==Early life==
Gustav Hamel was the only son of Dr Gustav Hugo Hamel (Royal Physician to King Edward VII) and his wife, Caroline Magdalena Elise. He was actually born in Hamburg, Germany as the oldest child to his parents followed by his sisters Magdalena Augusta Hilda Hamel (21 January 1891) and Dorothea Minna Hamel (February 1893). His youngest sister Anna Elise Bertha Hamel was born in London (6 October 1899). His family moved to England around 1899 to Kingston-upon-Thames and were naturalised as citizens around 1910. He was educated at Westminster School between 1901 and 1907.

==Aviation career==
===1910-11===
He learned to fly at the Blériot school at Pau, France in 1910 : after observing his first flight Louis Blériot commented that he had never seen a pilot with such natural ability. He obtained Aéro-Club de France&#x27;s certificate no. 358 on 3 February 1911 and the Royal Aero Club&#x27;s Aviator&#x27;s certificate no. 64 on 14 February. In March he won first prize in a race from Hendon to Brooklands and back, and on 14 April 1911 he flew from Brooklands to Hendon in a record 17 minutes.

On May 6th, he won a race from Brooklands to Brighton against three other competitors, Howard Pixton Graham Gilmour and Lt. Richard Talbot Snowden-Smith, covering the distance in 57 minutes in a Bleriot monoplane. Also in May, he was one of the pilots who took part in a demonstration of flying to various members of the government, where he demonstrated the usefulness of aircraft for carrying dispatches by flying a message to Aldershot and returning with a reply. The round trip took two hours, much of this time due to difficulty in starting his engine for the return journey.

In July 1911 he was one of the British representatives in the competition for the Gordon Bennett Trophy but crashed shortly after takeoff, fortunately without injury. Later that month he competed in the &quot;Daily Mail&quot; Circuit of Britain race, reaching Thornhill, north of Dumfries, before retiring after a forced landing due to engine problems in which he was slightly injured.

An item in the magazine &quot;Flight&quot;, of 26 August 1911, covered Hamel&#x27;s unsuccessful attempt to convey newspapers from Hendon to Southend the previous Saturday.
It appears that the publisher sponsored this event as a publicity stunt.
However, heavy weather forced his aircraft down at Hammersmith in West London.
On Saturday 9 September 1911 Hamel flew a Blériot XI the 19 miles between Hendon and Windsor in 18 minutes to deliver the first official airmail carried in Great Britain. He carried one bag of mail with 300-400 letters, about 800 postcards and a few newspapers weighing and arrived safely at Windsor around 5.13pm. Included was a postcard he had written en route.

On 12 October 1911 Hamel made his first cross-channel flight when he ferried a new Bleriot monoplane from Boulogne to Wembley. This was the first of 21 cross channel flight that he was to make.

===1912===

Hamel made the first cross-channel flight with a woman as passenger on 2 April 1912, when he flew Eleanor Trehawke Davies from Hendon to Paris, with intermediate stops at Ambleteuse and Hardelot. Later in the month he assisted Harriet Quimby to become the first woman pilot to cross the channel by testing her newly delivered Blériot monoplane before her flight.

Hamel made the first flight from Hedon airfield near Hull on Friday 2 August 1912.
Hamel took part in the first Aerial Derby race, carrying Eleanor Trehawke Davies as a passenger. At first he was credited with the fastest time, since Thomas Sopwith was disqualified for missing one of the control points, but after Sopwith successfully appealed Hamel was relegated to second place.

===1913===
In April 1913 Hamel made the first cross-channel return flight carrying a passenger, the &quot;Evening Standard&quot; journalist Frank Dupree. and later that month flew with Dupree as passenger from Dover to Cologne, the first time that a flight had been made from England to Germany. The flight, sponsored by the &quot;Evening Standard&quot;, was intended to draw attention to Britain&#x27;s need for military aircraft.

In August 1913 a seventy five mile air race around the Midlands was arranged between Bentfield Hucks and Hamel. The take-off point for the contest was the Tally-Ho grounds, adjacent to Cannon Hill Park. Both aviators then flew anti-clockwise around the circuit, landing at Redditch recreation ground, Coventry, Nuneaton, Tamworth and Walsall and finishing at Edgbaston. Hamel won the race by a margin of just twenty seconds.

Following his disappointment the previous year Hamel entered the 1913 Aerial Derby, flying a Morane-Saulnier monoplane. This time he won the competition, completing the course in 1h 15m 49s at a speed of despite a fuel leak which resulted in him having to fly part of the course plugging the leak with his finger.

Hamel was quite active in Worcestershire, visiting Pershore racecourse in October 1913 where he gave exhibitions of flying. He also visited Upton-on-Severn, Worcester Racecourse and Kidderminster cricket ground in October 1913.

===1914===
Late in 1913, looping the loop was perfected and became a popular event during public flying displays. On 2 January 1914, Hamel took Eleanor Trehawke Davies aloft to experience a loop, and she thus became the first woman in the world to do so. On 2 February he gave an exhibition of looping to the royal family at Windsor, making 14 loops before landing on the East Lawn of Windsor Castle. After lunch with the Royal family he gave a second exhibition before returning to Hendon.
In March 1914 Hamel flew to Cardiff to give a public flying display. While there he met Charles Horace Watkins, who was an engineer perfecting his own aircraft called the Robin Gôch, or Red Robin. Contemporary newspaper reports indicate that a few minutes after they met, Hamel flew them both to Watkins&#x27; hangar, where they inspected the Robin Gôch.

In May Hamel announced that he intended to attempt to win the £10,000 prize awarded by the &quot;Daily Mail&quot; for a flight across the Atlantic ocean, flying a specially built Martin-Handasyde monoplane.

==Personal life==
Hamel&#x27;s flying exploits made him a well-known public figure. He was a member of The Coterie, a prominent social set of aristocrats and intellectuals. He was considered popular and good-looking, and was a particular favourite of Lady Diana Manners.

On the 30 September 1911, Hamel was driving his car on the Surbiton Road in Kingston on Thames with one of his sisters as a passenger. The car struck and killed a five-year-old girl called Gladys Storey, who had been playing in the road.

Hamel was a friend of the actress Gladys Cooper; in 1915 she won £1,200 in damages from a newspaper, the &quot;London Mail&quot;, in a libel action over rumours she&#x27;d had adulterous affairs with both Hamel and an actor called Dennis Eadie. Another friend of Hamel&#x27;s was Eleanor Trehawke Davies. Flying as a passenger with him, she became the first woman to fly the English Chanel in 1912 and the first woman to loop-the loop.

==Disappearance==

On 22nd May 1914, Hamel travelled to France to collect a new aircraft, a Morane-Saulnier racing monoplane fitted with a 160 hp Gnome Monosoupape engine. On the 23rd, he intended to fly it from Villacoublay near Paris to Hendon, and then take part in an Aerial Derby that was to be held there later the same day. Although the English Chanel had been first flown only five years before, Hamel had considerable experience of this flight, having flown across it around 20 times.

Hamel took off in good weather at 4:40am and reached Le Crotoy at 5:22am, where he landed and had breakfast. He flew on to Neufchâtel-Hardelot near Boulogne. He landed there at 9:00am to sleep for two hours, refuel his aircraft and have lunch. He took off for the last time at 12:15pm. A presumed last sighting of him was an aircraft seen flying high over the town of Boulogne at 12:30pm.

After Hamal failed to arrive, a large-scale search was begun that evening by the Royal Navy using the cruiser HMS &quot;Pathfinder&quot; and the destroyers &quot;Mallard&quot;, &quot;Bat&quot;, Star and Osprey. Two seaplanes were also deployed in the search but both were destroyed by adverse weather conditions; both pilots were rescued. The search found nothing, and was called-off on the 26th May.

On 1st July, the crew of a French fishing vessel, the &quot;St. Hélène&quot;, found a body in the English Channel around 10 miles off Cap d&#x27;Alprech near Boulogne. They did not retrieve the body, but their description of items of clothing and of finding a road map of southern England on the corpse provided strong circumstantial evidence that the body was Hamel&#x27;s.

Hamal was declared dead in September 1914, after a court heard evidence from Joseph Le Pretre, the skipper of the fishing vessel, and Alexis Longueet, a mechanic who met Hamel at Neufchâtel-Hardelot.

==Legacy==
At this time of high international tension, there was speculation that Hamel might have been the victim of sabotage, but no trace of the aircraft was ever found and the story faded with his memory.
A sculpture bust of him by Lady Kathleen Scott was exhibited in 1914. At least one song featuring Hamel was published as sheet-music in 1913. Alongside aviator Claude Grahame-White, Hamal appeared in the 1914 film &quot;Across the Atlantic&quot; (also titled &quot;Secret of the Air&quot;) that was directed by Herbert Brenon and starred King Baggot.

After the start of World War 1, the circumstances of Hamel&#x27;s disappearance, his German place of birth and popular anti-German sentiment led to rumours that he was still alive and flying in the service of the &quot;Luftstreitkräfte&quot;, the German air force. Or that he had been spying on behalf of the Germans. The rumours required a public denial to be issued on behalf of his family.

Hamel co-authored &quot;Flying; some practical experiences&quot; with Charles Cyril Turner, author, journalist and aviator. This was published in March 1914.

In 2011, Hamel was portrayed on a set of Royal Mail postage stamps, that marked the centenary of his first airmail flight.

<text>A Void, translated from the original French  ( &quot;The Disappearance&quot;), is a 300-page French lipogrammatic novel, written in 1969 by Georges Perec, entirely without using the letter &quot;e&quot;, following Oulipo constraints. Perec would go on to write with the inverse constraint in &quot;Les Revenentes&quot;, with only the vowel “e” present in the work. Ian Monk would later translate &quot;Les Revenentes&quot; into English under the title &quot;The Exeter Text.&quot; 

==Translations==
It was translated into English by Gilbert Adair, with the title &quot;A Void&quot;, for which he won the Scott Moncrieff Prize in 1995. The Adair translation of the book also won the 1996 Firecracker Alternative Book Award for Fiction.

Three other English translations are titled &quot;A Vanishing&quot; by Ian Monk, &quot;Vanish&#x27;d!&quot; by John Lee, and &quot;Omissions&quot; by Julian West.

All translators have imposed upon themselves a similar lipogrammatic constraint to the original, avoiding the most commonly used letter of the alphabet. This precludes the use of words normally considered essential such as (&quot;I&quot;), (&quot;and&quot;), and (masculine &quot;the&quot;) in French, as well as &quot;me&quot;, &quot;be&quot;, and &quot;the&quot; in English. The Spanish version contains no &quot;a&quot;, which is the second most commonly used letter in the Spanish language (first being &quot;e&quot;), while the Russian version contains no о. The Japanese version does not use syllables containing the sound &quot;i&quot; (, , , etc.) at all.

==Plot summary==
&quot;A Void&quot; plot follows a group of individuals looking for a missing companion, Anton Vowl. It is in part a parody of &quot;noir&quot; and horror fiction, with many stylistic tricks, gags, plot twists, and a grim conclusion. On many occasions it implicitly talks about its own lipogrammatic limitation, highlighting its unusual syntax. &quot;A Void&quot; protagonists finally work out which symbol is missing, but find it a hazardous topic to discuss, as any who try to bypass this story&#x27;s constraint risk fatal injury. Philip Howard, writing a lipogrammatic appraisal of &quot;A Void&quot; in his column &quot;Lost Words&quot;, said: &quot;This is a story chock-full of plots and sub-plots, of loops within loops, of trails in pursuit of trails, all of which allow its author an opportunity to display his customary virtuosity as an avant-gardist magician, acrobat and clown.&quot;

==Major themes==
Both of Georges Perec&#x27;s parents perished in World War II: his father as a soldier and his mother in the Holocaust. He was brought up by his aunt and uncle after surviving the war. Warren Motte interprets the absence of the letter &quot;e&quot; in the book as a metaphor for Perec&#x27;s own sense of loss and incompleteness:

<doc id="842002" wikidata="Q1269232" url="?curid=842002" title="Lapin Kulta">
<text>Lapin Kulta (in English, Lapland Gold) is a Finnish beer brand. Lapin Kulta was also the name of the brewery in the Lapland town of Tornio, where the beer was originally brewed. The brewery was founded in 1873 under the name Torneå Bryggeri Aktiebolag (i.e., Tornio Brewery Limited Company). The brand is now owned by Hartwall, which is in turn owned by Royal Unibrew.

The brand name &quot;Lapin Kulta&quot; is used for a variety of lagers of varying strengths. In 2009 the Lapland brewery was closed and since then Lapin Kulta has been brewed in the southern Finnish town of Lahti.

==History==

The brewery was founded in 1873, but the name Lapin Kulta was not adopted until 1963. The brewery had to acquire a gold mining company with an identical name in order to rightfully use the name. The company&#x27;s articles of association still state the line of business to be &quot;prospecting for gold and the manufacture and sales of beer&quot;.

Lapin Kulta&#x27;s focus is on high-quality ingredients (malt barley, clear water, and the company&#x27;s own yeast strain). This, coupled with successful marketing, made it the most popular beer brand in Finland for a long period. In the 21st C., the competitors Karhu and Olvi have overtaken it, leaving Lapin Kulta in 4th place.

After a merger with the Hartwall beverage company in 1980, the brand name entered the export market and eventually became available in most European countries.

In October 2009 Hartwall announced the closure of the Lapin Kulta brewery in Tornio, and moved production to its Lahti brewery.

<doc id="842004" wikidata="Q815421" url="?curid=842004" title="Piano nobile">
<text>&#x27; (Italian for &quot;noble floor&quot; or &quot;noble level&quot;, also sometimes referred to by the corresponding French term, &#x27;) is the architectural term for the principal floor of a &quot;palazzo&quot;. This floor contains the main reception and bedrooms of the house.

The German term is (meaning &quot;beautiful storey&quot;, from the French ). Both date to the 17th century.

==Characteristics==
The &quot;piano nobile&quot; is usually the first floor (in European terminology; second floor in American terms) or sometimes the second storey and contains major rooms, located above the rusticated ground floor containing the minor rooms and service rooms. The reasons were so that the rooms above the ground floor would have finer views and to avoid the dampness and odours of the street level. That is especially true in Venice, where the &quot;piano nobile&quot; of the many &quot;palazzi&quot; is especially obvious from the exterior by virtue of its larger windows and balconies and open loggias. Examples are Ca&#x27; Foscari, Ca&#x27; d&#x27;Oro, Ca&#x27; Vendramin Calergi and Palazzo Barbarigo.

Larger windows than those on other floors are usually the most obvious feature of the &quot;piano nobile&quot;. In England and Italy, the &quot;piano nobile&quot; is often reached by an ornate outer staircase, which avoided for the floor&#x27;s inhabitants of the need to enter the house by the servant&#x27;s floor below. Kedleston Hall is an example of this in England, as is Villa Capra &quot;La Rotonda&quot; in Italy.

Most houses contained a secondary floor above the &quot;piano nobile&quot;, which contained more intimate withdrawing and bedrooms for private use by the family of the house when no honoured guests were present. Above that floor would often be an attic floor containing staff bedrooms.

In Italy, especially in Venetian &quot;palazzi&quot;, the floor above the &quot;piano nobile&quot; is sometimes referred to as the &quot;secondo piano nobile&quot; (second principal floor), especially if the loggias and balconies reflect those below on a slightly smaller scale. In those instances and occasionally in museums, the principal &quot;piano nobile&quot; is described as the primo piano nobile to differentiate it.

The arrangement of floors continued throughout Europe as large houses continued to be built in the classical style. The arrangement was designed at Buckingham Palace as recently as the mid-19th century. Holkham Hall, Osterley Park and Chiswick House are among the innumerable 18th-century English houses that employed the design.

<text>Reality Checkpoint is a large cast-iron lamppost in the middle of Parker&#x27;s Piece, Cambridge, England, at the intersection of the park&#x27;s diagonal paths.

==Origin of the name==
There are three main theories as to the meaning of the name.
* It may mark the boundary between the central university area of Cambridge (referred to as the &quot;reality bubble&quot;) and the &quot;real world&quot; of the townspeople living beyond it. One is warned to check one&#x27;s notions of reality before passing.
* The name arose because the lamppost forms a useful landmark for people crossing the park at night – perhaps intoxicated or in the fog – since it is the only light for more than a hundred metres.
* When drunk, students and the general public are reminded to check that they are able to walk like a sober person before passing the police station at the edge of Parker&#x27;s Piece, hence a &quot;reality check&quot;.

==History==
A lamp at the centre of Parker&#x27;s Piece was first proposed in 1890 and work commenced in January 1894, when a pipe was laid from Parkside, running parallel with the path opposite Melbourne Place. Once the connections were completed, the pillar was erected. This attracted a great deal of interest and was described as a &quot;very handsome ornament to the Piece&quot;. It was made of cast iron by the Sun Foundry of George Smith &amp; Company in Glasgow. It stands on a square-section plinth with waterleaf decoration on the top edges. The base of the shaft of the circular section is encircled with four intertwined heraldic dolphins. The shaft carries four lampholders by means of scrolled wrought iron stays. It is said to be the oldest electrical lamppost in Cambridge.

A photograph from around 1903 shows the lamppost with a single lamp.

The post above the dolphins was torn down in 1945 by U.S. soldiers celebrating Victory over Japan Day, the end of the war with Japan. In September 1946 the lamppost was repaired by a local metalworks firm, George Lister &amp; Sons. The work was done by foreman Sam Mason, assisted by a young apprentice, Tony Challis, who did the scrollwork at the top of the lamppost. Challis still lives in Cambridgeshire and is also responsible for the ornate railings found at Grantchester Meadows. The current design with four pendant lamps dates from 1946.

In 1996 the lamppost was designated as a Grade II listed building.

In 2016–17 Cambridge City Council restored the lamppost, reinstating its earlier colours of moss green, red, white and gold, and casting any new parts as required.

In 2018 anonymous local art installers, Dinky Doors, installed a reality checker &quot;door&quot; on the checkpoint, which was refurbished in 2019.

==Inscription==
One report claims that the name was first painted on the lamppost in the early 1970s by students from Cambridgeshire College of Arts and Technology (now Anglia Ruskin University) under the guidance of one of their teachers. Another claims that it was originated in 1970 by the Emmanuel Liberation Front (ELF), one of whose members first scratched the name onto the lamppost. The ELF was a group of radical students at Emmanuel College between 1969 and 1971 influenced by the Situationists with their slogan &quot;Do not adjust your mind. There is a fault in reality.&quot; Emmanuel adjoins the northwest side of Parker&#x27;s Piece.

Until the early 1970s the lamppost was painted a dishwater grey or discoloured cream. In 2017 two brothers, David and Sandy Cairncross, revealed that they had been responsible for repainting it in bright colours in October 1973, a task undertaken with the written permission of Geoffrey Cresswell, the Cambridge City Engineer. At the time David was a student at King&#x27;s College, Cambridge, and Sandy was a postgraduate research student (he is now a distinguished epidemiologist). The repainting did not involve anyone from Cambridgeshire College of Arts and Technology.

The Cairncrosses confirmed that the name &quot;Reality Checkpoint&quot; had previously been inscribed in marker pen on the pillar &quot;a year or two earlier&quot; and that their painting of the name was initially a placeholder for more sophisticated lettering. On how the lamppost got its name, David acknowledged the influence of Checkpoint Charlie during the Cold War and the popularity of Carlos Castaneda’s memoir &quot;A Separate Reality&quot; (1971).

The Cairncross brothers&#x27; repainting remained throughout the 1970s and into the 1980s. By 1980, however, the lamppost was looking shabby, as is clear in a photograph of the poet Tom Raworth taken next to it in 1980. Eventually Cambridge City Council painted over the decoration with a dull faux verdigris.

Since then the name has been informally inscribed or scratched into the paintwork many times, despite its repeated removal by Cambridge City Council or obliteration by graffiti. At one point in the mid-1990s, according to Graham Chainey writing in &quot;The London Magazine&quot;, &quot;Reality Checkpoint&quot; was scratched on one side of the plinth, while on the opposite side was scrawled &quot;The Comfortably Numb&quot;, a reference to a song on the album &quot;The Wall&quot; by the Cambridge band Pink Floyd.

For the first half of 1998 the lamppost carried an unofficial plaque bearing its name, until it was removed by the council.

The comedian Ben Miller featured the lamppost in his BBC Two physics documentary &quot;What Is One Degree?&quot; for the science series &quot;Horizon&quot;. At that time the lamppost had the words &quot;Reality Checkpoint&quot; scratched into its paintwork in at least two places. The lamppost also features briefly in an episode of the crime drama &quot;Professor T.&quot;, in which Miller plays the eponymous role.

The inscription was restored in June 2017 by the artist Emma Smith, with the approval of the Cambridge City Council, as part of the art project &quot;Hunch&quot; commissioned by the University Arms Hotel.

<text>The Cordillera Paine is a mountain group in Torres del Paine National Park in Chilean Patagonia. The cordillera is located north of Punta Arenas, and about south of the Chilean capital Santiago. It belongs to the Commune of Torres del Paine in Última Esperanza Province of Magallanes and Antártica Chilena Region. No accurate surveys have been published, and published elevations have been claimed to be seriously inflated, so most of the elevations given on this page are approximate. &quot;Paine&quot; means &quot;blue&quot; in the native Tehuelche (Aonikenk) language and is pronounced &quot;PIE-nay&quot;.

==Peaks==

The highest summit of the range is Cerro Paine Grande. For a long time its elevation was claimed to be , but in August 2011 it was ascended for the third time, measured using GPS and found to be .

The three Towers of Paine () form the centrepiece of Parque Nacional Torres del Paine. The South Tower of Paine (about in elevation, is now thought to be the highest of the three, although this has not been definitely established. It was first climbed in 1963 by Armando Aste. The Central Tower (about in elevation) was first climbed in 1963 by Chris Bonington and Don Whillans. In 2017, three Belgian climbers, Nico Favresse, Siebe Vanhee and Sean Villanueva O&#x27;Driscoll, made the first free ascent up the rock face, which is about . The North Tower (about in elevation) was first climbed in 1958 by Guido Monzino.

Other summits include the Cuerno Principal, about in elevation, and Cerro Paine Chico, which is usually quoted at about .

==Geology==

The range is made up of a yellowish granite underlain by grey gabbro-diorite laccolith and the sedimentary rocks it intrudes, deeply eroded by glaciers. The steep, light colored faces are eroded from the tougher, vertically jointed granitic rocks, while the foothills and dark cap rocks are the sedimentary country rock, in this case flysch deposited in the Cretaceous and later folded.

The radiometric age for the quartz diorite at Cerro Paine is 12±2 million years by the rubidium-strontium method and 13±1 million years by the potassium-argon method. More precise ages of 12.59±0.02 and 12.50±0.02 million years for the earliest and latest identified phases of the intrusion, respectively, were achieved using Uranium–lead dating methods on single zircon crystals. Basal gabbro and diorite were dated by a similar technique to 12.472±0.009 to 12.431±0.006 million years. Thus, magma was intruded and crystallized over 162±11 thousand years. High resolution dating and excellent 3-D exposure of the laccolith and its vertical feeding system allow detailed reconstruction of the Torres del Paine fossil magma chamber history.

==Hiking==

The Torres del Paine National Park—an area of —was declared a Biosphere Reserve by the UNESCO in 1978 and receives about 250,000 visitors annually. Trails and some campsites are maintained by Chile&#x27;s National Forest Corporation, and mountain huts provide shelter and basic services.

<text>Titan IV was a family of heavy-lift space launch vehicles developed by Martin Marietta and operated by the United States Air Force from 1989 to 2005. Launches were conducted from Cape Canaveral Air Force Station, Florida and Vandenberg Air Force Base, California.

The Titan IV was the last of the Titan family of rockets, originally developed by the Glenn L. Martin Company in 1958. It was retired in 2005 due to their high cost of operation and concerns over its toxic hypergolic propellants, and replaced with the Atlas V and Delta IV launch vehicles under the EELV program. The final launch (B-30) from Cape Canaveral occurred on 29 April 2005, and the final launch from Vandenberg AFB occurred on 19 October 2005. Lockheed Martin Space Systems built the Titan IVs near Denver, Colorado, under contract to the US government.

Two Titan IV vehicles are currently on display at the National Museum of the United States Air Force in Dayton, Ohio and the Evergreen Aviation and Space Museum in McMinnville, Oregon.

==Vehicle description==
The Titan IV was developed to provide assured capability to launch Space Shuttle–class payloads for the Air Force. The Titan IV could be launched with no third stage, the Inertial Upper Stage (IUS), or the Centaur upper stage.

The Titan IV was made up of two large solid-fuel rocket boosters and a two-stage liquid-fueled core. The two storable liquid fuel core stages used Aerozine 50 fuel and nitrogen tetroxide oxidizer. These propellants are hypergolic, igniting on contact, and are liquids at room temperature, so no tank insulation is needed. This allowed the launcher to be stored in a ready state for extended periods, but both propellants are extremely toxic.

The Titan IV could be launched from either coast: SLC-40 or 41 at Cape Canaveral Air Force Station near Cocoa Beach, Florida and at SLC-4E, at Vandenberg Air Force Base launch sites 55 miles northwest of Santa Barbara California. Launches to polar orbits occurred from Vandenberg, with most other launches taking place at Cape Canaveral.

===Titan IV-A===
Titan IV-A flew with steel-cased solid UA1207 rocket motors (SRMs) produced by Chemical Systems Division.

===Titan IV-B===
The Titan IV-B evolved from the Titan III family and was similar to the Titan 34D.

While the launcher family had an extremely good reliability record in its first two decades, this changed in the 1980s with the loss of a Titan 34D in 1985 followed by the disastrous explosion of another in 1986 due to a SRM failure.
Due to this, the Titan IV-B vehicle was intended to use the new composite-casing Upgraded Solid Rocket Motors. Due to development problems the first few Titan IV-B launches flew with the old-style UA1207 SRMs.

===Upgrades===
====Solid Rocket Motor Upgrade test stand====
In 1988–89, The Ralph M. Parsons Company designed and built a full-scale steel tower and deflector facility, which was used to test the Titan IV Solid Rocket Motor Upgrade (SRMU). The launch and the effect of the SRMU thrust force on the Titan IV vehicle were modeled. To evaluate the magnitude of the thrust force, the SRMU was connected to the steel tower through load measurement systems and launched in-place. It was the first full-scale test conducted to simulate the effects of the SRMU on the Titan IV vehicle.

====Proposed aluminum-lithium tanks====
In the early 1980s, General Dynamics developed a plan to assemble a lunar landing spacecraft in-orbit under the name Early Lunar Access. A Space Shuttle would lift a lunar lander into orbit and then a Titan IV rocket would launch with a modified Centaur G-Prime stage to rendezvous and dock. The plan required upgrading the Space Shuttle and Titan IV to use lighter aluminium-lithium alloy propellant tanks. The plan never came to fruition, but in the 1990s the Shuttle&#x27;s External Tank was converted to aluminum-lithium tanks to rendezvous with the highly inclined orbit of the Russian Mir Space Station.

== Type identification ==
The IV-A (40nA) used boosters with steel casings, the IV-B (40nB) used boosters with composite casings (the SRMU).

Type 401 used a Centaur 3rd stage, type 402 used an IUS 3rd stage. The other 3 types (without 3rd stages) were 403, 404, and 405:

* Type 403 featured no upper stage, for lower-mass payloads to higher orbits from Vandenberg.
* Type 404 featured no upper stage, for heavier payloads to low orbits, from Vandenberg.
* Type 405 featured no upper stage, for lower-mass payloads to higher-orbit from Cape Canaveral.

==History==

The Titan rocket family was established in October 1955 when the Air Force awarded the Glenn L. Martin Company (later Martin-Marietta, now part of Lockheed Martin) a contract to build an intercontinental ballistic missile (SM-68). The resulting Titan I was the nation&#x27;s first two-stage ICBM and complemented the Atlas ICBM as the second underground, vertically stored, silo-based ICBM. Both stages of the Titan I used liquid oxygen and RP-1 as propellants.

A subsequent version of the Titan family, the Titan II, was a two-stage evolution of the Titan I, but was much more powerful and used different propellants. Designated as LGM-25C, the Titan II was the largest missile developed for the USAF at that time. The Titan II had newly developed engines which used Aerozine 50 and nitrogen tetroxide as fuel and oxidizer in a self-igniting, hypergolic propellant combination, allowing the Titan II to be stored underground ready to launch. Titan II was the first Titan vehicle to be used as a space launcher.

Development of the space launch only Titan III began in 1964, resulting in the Titan IIIA, eventually followed by the Titan IV-A and IV-B.

===CELV===
By the mid-1980s the United States government worried that the Space Shuttle, designed to launch all American payloads and replace all unmanned rockets, would not be reliable enough for military and classified missions. In 1984 Under Secretary of the Air Force and Director of the National Reconnaissance Office (NRO) Pete Aldridge decided to purchase Complementary Expendable Launch Vehicles (CELV) for ten NRO payloads; the name came from the government&#x27;s expectation that the rockets would &quot;complement&quot; the shuttle. Later renamed Titan IV, the rocket would only carry three military payloads paired with Centaur stages and fly exclusively from LC-41 at Cape Canaveral. However, the Challenger accident in 1986 caused a renewed dependence on expendable launch systems, with the Titan IV program significantly expanded. At the time of its introduction, the Titan IV was the largest and most capable expendable launch vehicle used by the USAF.

The post-Challenger program added Titan IV versions with the Inertial Upper Stage (IUS) or no upper stages, increased the number of flights, and converted LC-40 at the Cape for Titan IV launches. As of 1991, almost forty total Titan IV launches were scheduled and a new, improved SRM (solid rocket motor) casing using lightweight composite materials was introduced.

===Program cost===
In 1990, the Titan IV Selected Acquisition Report estimated the total cost for the acquisition of 65 Titan IV vehicles over a period of 16 years to US$18.3 billion (inflation-adjusted US$ billion in ).

===Cassini–Huygens launch===
In October 1997, a Titan IV-B rocket launched &quot;Cassini–Huygens&quot;, a pair of probes sent to Saturn. It was the only use of a Titan IV for a non-Department of Defense launch. &quot;Huygens&quot; landed on Titan on January 14, 2005. &quot;Cassini&quot; remained in orbit around Saturn. The Cassini Mission ended on September 15, 2017, when the spacecraft was sent into Saturn&#x27;s atmosphere to burn up.

===Retirement===
While an improvement over the shuttle, the Titan IV was expensive and unreliable. By the 1990s, there were also growing safety concerns over its toxic propellants. The Evolved Expendable Launch Vehicle (EELV) program resulted in the development of the Atlas V, Delta IV, and Delta IV Heavy launch vehicles, which replaced Titan IV and a number of other legacy launch systems. The new EELVs eliminated the use of hypergolic propellants, reduced costs, and were much more versatile than the legacy vehicles.

===Surviving examples===
In 2014, the National Museum of the United States Air Force in Dayton, Ohio, began a project to restore a Titan IV-B rocket. This effort was successful, with the display opening June 8, 2016. The only other surviving Titan IV components are at the Wings Over the Rockies Air and Space Museum in Denver, Colorado which has two Titan Stage 1 engines, one Titan Stage 2 engine, and the interstage ‘skirt’ on outdoor display; and at the Evergreen Aviation and Space Museum in McMinnville, Oregon, including the core stages and parts of the solid rocket motor assembly.

==Launch history==


==Launch failures==
The Titan IV experienced four catastrophic launch failures.

===1993 booster explosion===

On August 2, 1993, Titan IV K-11 lifted from SLC-4E carrying a NOSS SIGNIT satellite. Unusually for DoD launches, the Air Force invited civilian press to cover the launch, which became more of a story than intended when the booster exploded 101 seconds after liftoff. Investigation found that one of the two SRMs had burned through, resulting in the destruction of the vehicle in a similar manner as the earlier 34D-9 failure. An investigation found that an improper repair job was the cause of the accident.

After Titan 34D-9, extensive measures had been put in place to ensure proper SRM operating condition, including X-raying the motor segments during prelaunch checks. The SRMs that went onto K-11 had originally been shipped to Cape Canaveral, where X-rays revealed anomalies in the solid propellant mixture in one segment. The defective area was removed by a pie-shaped cut in the propellant block. However, most of CSD&#x27;s qualified personnel had left the program by this point and so the repair crew in question did not know the proper procedure. After replacement, they neglected to seal the area where the cut in the propellant block had been made. Post repair X-rays were enough for CC personnel to disqualify the SRMs from flight, but the SRMs were then shipped to Vandenberg and approved anyway. The result was a near-repeat of 34D-9; a gap was left between the propellant and SRM casing and another burn-through occurred during launch.

===1998 IV-A electrical failure===
1998 saw the failure of Titan K-17 with a Navy ELINT Mercury (satellite) from Cape Canaveral around 40 seconds into the flight. K-17 was several years old and the last Titan IV-A to be launched. The post-accident investigation showed that the booster had dozens of damaged or chafed wires and should never have been launched in that operating condition, but the Air Force had put extreme pressure on launch crews to meet program deadlines. The Titan&#x27;s fuselage was filled with numerous sharp metal protrusions that made it nearly impossible to install, adjust, or remove wiring without it getting damaged. Quality control at Lockheed&#x27;s Denver plant, where Titan vehicles were assembled, was described as &quot;awful&quot;.

The proximal cause of the failure was an electrical short that caused a momentary power dropout to the guidance computer at T+39 seconds. After power was restored, the computer sent a spurious pitch down and yaw to the right command. At T+40 seconds, the Titan was traveling at near supersonic speed and could not handle this action without suffering a structural failure. The sudden pitch downward and resulting aerodynamic stress caused one of the SRMs to separate. The ISDS (Inadvertent Separation Destruct System) automatically triggered, rupturing the SRM and taking the rest of the launch vehicle with it. At T+45 seconds, the Range Safety Officer sent the destruct command to ensure any remaining large pieces of the booster were broken up.

An extensive recovery effort was launched, both to diagnose the cause of the accident and recover debris from the classified satellite. All of the debris from the Titan had impacted offshore, between three and five miles downrange, and at least 30% of the booster was recovered from the sea floor. Debris continued to wash ashore for days afterward, and the salvage operation continued until October 15.

The Air Force had pushed for a &quot;launch on demand&quot; program for DOD payloads, something that was almost impossible to pull off especially given the lengthy preparation and processing time needed for a Titan IV launch (at least 60 days). Shortly before retiring in 1994, General Chuck Horner referred to the Titan program as &quot;a nightmare&quot;. The 1998-99 schedule had called for four launches in less than 12 months. The first of these was Titan K-25 which successfully orbited an Orion SIGNIT satellite on May 9, 1998. The second was the K-17 failure, and the third was the K-32 failure.

===Stage failure to separate===
After a delay caused by the investigation of the previous failure, the 9 April 1999 launch of K-32 carried a DSP early warning satellite. The IUS second stage failed to separate, leaving the payload in a useless orbit. Investigation into this failure found that wiring harnesses in the IUS had been wrapped too tightly with electrical tape so that a plug failed to disconnect properly and prevented the two IUS stages from separating.

===Centaur database error===
The fourth launch was K-26 on April 30, 1999, carrying a Milstar communications satellite. During the Centaur coast phase flight, the roll control thrusters fired open-loop until the RCS fuel was depleted, causing the upper stage and payload to rotate rapidly. On restart, the Centaur cartwheeled out of control and left its payload in a useless orbit. This failure was found to be the result of an incorrectly entered database parameter in the guidance computer. The error caused the roll rate gyro data to be ignored by the flight computer.

<text>Mohammed Tlili ben Abdallah (), also known as Moham(m)ed Gammoudi, (born February 11, 1938) is a Tunisian athlete who competed as a long-distance runner in international track and field competitions. He represented Tunisia in the Tokyo, Mexico City, and Munich Olympiads and recorded four medals, including a gold medal in the 5000 metres event in Mexico City. Gammoudi was also competitive at 10,000 metres.

Born in Sidi Aïch, in Tunisia, Mohammed Gammoudi was one of the pioneers of the African long-distance running revolution that changed the face of the sport in the final decades of the 20th century.

==Running career==

===1963 Mediterranean Games and 1964 Olympics===

Gammoudi first came to international attention at the 1963 Mediterranean Games in Naples, where he won the 5,000 m and 10,000 m. and repeated the feat in the 1967 Games. Despite those achievements, Gammoudi was still virtually unknown when he arrived at the Tokyo Olympic Games. The favourite, world record holder Ron Clarke from Australia, ensured a fast tempo throughout the race. With one lap remaining, Clarke had dropped all his main rivals, except Gammoudi and Billy Mills from United States. Coming into the home straight, Mills, Clark and Gammoudi exchanged leads. With 50 m to go, Gammoudi had the lead, until Mills swept past Gammoudi to win the gold medal. Two days later, Gammoudi won his heat in the 5000 m, but for reasons never fully explained, he withdrew from the final.

===1967 Mediterranean Games and 1968 Olympics===

Gammoudi successfully defended his 5000 m and 10 000 m titles at the Mediterranean Games in Tunis in 1967, and was one of the favourites at the Mexico Olympics. In the 10,000 m final in Mexico, Gammoudi was in the leading group throughout the race. The group had been reduced to three by the bell lap. Naftali Temu from Kenya, who won in 29:27.4 and Mamo Wolde from Ethiopia 29:28, sprinted the last lap, outrunning Gammoudi, leaving him at 29:34, with the bronze medal. Two days later, Gammoudi qualified for the 5000 m final. In the final, three runners were in contention at the bell lap, with Gammoudi leading Temu and another Kenyan, Kip Keino. The last lap was fast pace, and although the two Kenyans gave charge, Gammoudi held on to the lead, winning the gold medal.

===1971 Mediterranean Games and 1972 Olympics===
At the next Mediterranean Games, at İzmir in 1971, Gammoudi&#x27;s won the silver in the 5000 m. Despite his disappointing performance at Izmir, Gammoudi was one of the favourites in the impressive 5,000 m and 10,000 m fields at the Munich Olympics. In the 10 000 m final, a tightly bunched group of nine runners were traveling at sub-world record pace just before the 4600 m mark, when Lasse Virén from Finland suddenly stumbled and fell over, causing Gammoudi to tumble over the top of him. Virén recovered quickly and went on to win the race, but Gammoudi took much longer getting to his feet, and after running for a lap and a half to close the 100 m gap that had opened between himself and the leaders, he dropped out. In contrast to the 10,000 m pace, the early stages of the 5000 m final were run at a very slow pace, with Gammoudi prominent in the pack that remained tightly bunched for the first 3000 m. The pace picked up considerably in the last 2000 m, with Virén and United States champion Steve Prefontaine separating from the pack. The last mile turned into an all out sprint, with Virén beating Gammoudi by about ten meters, in the latter&#x27;s last major competitive race.

===International Cross Country Championships===
Gammoudi also excelled in cross country running. He finished third at the 1965 International Cross Country Championships, held at Ostend, Belgium. In 1968, running in Tunis, in his home country, he won the International Cross Country Championships, becoming the third African man to take that title.

<text>[[Koninklijke]] Lierse Sportkring (), often simply known as Lierse, was a Belgian professional football club from the city of Lier in the Antwerp province. Lierse have won four championship titles and two Belgian Cups. Lierse was one of the seven Belgian clubs to have played in the UEFA Champions League group stage, the others being Anderlecht, Antwerp, Club Brugge, Genk, Standard Liège and KAA Gent.

The club was founded in 1906 and was initially promoted to the first division in 1927–28. Lierse was relatively successful in the first division until the end of World War II, winning two titles and finishing only four times outside the top five. At the end of the 1947–48 season, they were relegated to the second division. Lierse enjoyed two more spells at the highest level, each time with a championship win (between 1953–54 and 1985–86 and between 1988–89 and 2006–07). Lierse spent five more years in the first division between 2010–11 and 2014–15, but then played in the second division until it was dissolved.

Lierse played their home matches at the Herman Vanderpoortenstadion in Lier, which is also known as &quot;Het Lisp&quot;, because the stadium is located in a neighbourhood named Lisp. Both the logo and home kit featured the club colours of yellow and black. The club was bought by Egyptian businessman Maged Samy, who also owns KV Turnhout and Wadi Degla in Egypt.

The most capped player at the club was Bernard Voorhoof with 61 caps for Belgium, all when he was at Lierse. With 30 goals, he was the topscorer of the Belgium national football team together with Paul Van Himst, until Romelu Lukaku (who played in Lierse&#x27;s youth squads) surpassed this record.

On 9 May 2018, the team announced that it requested bankruptcy.

After the bankruptcy of the team, negotiations started with Lyra and Oosterzonen. Eventually two teams with the name Lierse were formed: K. Lyra-Lierse and K. Lierse Kempenzonen. K. Lierse Kempenzonen currently plays with the old Lierse S.K. logo at the Herman Vanderpoortenstadion.

== History ==

=== The early years ===
In 1904, Gustaaf Van Den Roye learned about the game of football in Antwerp and got fascinated about it. He bought an authentic ball to play the game in his hometown of Lier. The first games were played on a terrain owned by the local graf Marnix de Sainte-Aldegonde. Local farmers were not pleased and the police had to intervene, who prohibited any further games. The graf was informed of what happened and he asked Van Den Roye to come and see him. When Van Den Roye told the Graf about his intent to start an actual football club and pointed out the difficulties he was faced with, The Graf promised him a terrain which could serve as a football ground.

On 6 March 1906, during a meeting in a local pub called &quot;De Roskam&quot; a football club was founded, named &quot;Liersche Sportkring&quot;. Lierse was born and a first board was established: Gerard Quaeyhaegens as chairman, Gust van den Roye as secretary and Georges Peeters as Treasurer. Graf Marnix de Sainte-Aldegonde agreed to become honorary chairman.

Two years after its foundation, in September 1908, Lierse became a member of the Royal Belgian Football Association, where it started playing in the lowest tier of Belgian Football. In 1913 the club made its first impact in Belgian football, when it became the first club ever out a regional league to reach the quarter-finals of the Belgian Cup. The club climbed through the ranks of Belgian football. In 1922, after winning a national play-off round Lierse gained promotion to the national levels of Belgian Football, which they would never leave until present.
=== 1927–1948: First spell at the highest level ===
Five years after reaching the national levels, in 1927, Lierse became champions in &quot;division 1&quot; the second tier of Belgian football, with a 2 points advantage over RSC Anderlecht. In doing so, Lierse succeeded promotion to the highest level for the first time in its history. This first spell in the top tier proved to be very successful immediately as Lierse became champions for the first time in 1932. In the 12 seasons that followed they finished only 1 time outside the top 5, becoming runner up in 1935 and 1939, and winning the championship again in 1941 (unofficial due to World War II) and 1942.

One of the major factors of the success of the club in this period was Bernard Voorhoof, who scored 350 goals in 529 matches for the club. He was voted &quot;Lierse player of the century&quot; when the club celebrated its 100th anniversary in 2006. Until now Voorhoof is also still the topscorer of the Belgium national football team with 30 goals in 61 matches and he is one of the four players worldwide to have competed in all 3 FIFA World Cups before World War II.

The second World War had its impact on the club though. 2 players of the club, national goalkeeper Frans Christiaens and Frans Vervoort died during allied bombardments on a factory in German-occupied Mortsel. Also Jules Van Craen, topscorer of the Belgian League in the 1943 season died during the war. In the season 1944–45 Lierse, together with three other clubs from the Antwerp area, did not compete in the league, due to the German bombardments on the Port of Antwerp. These facts, combined with some of the older players retiring caused the club to decline until they finished bottom of the league in 1948. After 21 years at the highest level, Lierse were relegated for the first time in its history.

=== 1953–2018 ===
In 1953, Lierse secured promotion to the highest level once again.

In 1960, K. Lierse S.K won their third championship title, and distinguished themselves at European level.

In 1969, Lierse won the Belgian Cup for the first time.

21 September 1971, is considered an important day for Lierse. Two weeks earlier, Lierse had lost 0–2 at home to the far superior Leeds United in the first round of the UEFA Cup. Nobody expected that Lierse would win in Leeds, but Lierse had an improbably 0–4 win, and Leeds, the Cup holders, were knocked out.

In 1986, Lierse were again relegated, but in 1988, they were promoted back to the top division. Keeping up with the elite clubs in Belgium had now become the top priority. Rich clubs such as Anderlecht and Club Bruges reigned supreme in the Belgian League.

1991–1994: Telefusion Belgium sponsored Lierse in these years.

In 1997, Lierse became league champions again, to a large amount of people&#x27;s surprise. The hotly tipped favourites, Club Bruges, were surprisingly beaten to the title by Lierse.

Two years later (1999), Lierse won the Belgian Cup again.

In May 2018, owner Maged Samy and David Nakhid failed to agree on terms for a possible acquisition, making the future of the club uncertain.
