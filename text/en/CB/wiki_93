<text>The Dnyaneshwari () (IAST: Jñānēśvarī), also referred to as Jnanesvari, Jnaneshwari or Bhavartha Deepika, is a commentary on the &quot;Bhagavad Gita&quot; written by the Marathi saint and poet Sant Dnyaneshwar in 1290 CE. Dnyaneshwar (born 1275) lived a short life of 22 years, and this commentary is notable to have been composed in his teens. The text is the oldest surviving literary work in the Marathi language, one that inspired major Bhakti movement saint-poets such as Eknath and Tukaram of the Varkari (Vithoba) tradition. The &quot;Dnyaneshwari&quot; interprets the &quot;Bhagavad Gita&quot; in the Advaita Vedanta tradition of Hinduism. The philosophical depth of the text has been praised for its aesthetic as well as scholarly value.

According to Pradhan and Lambert, the reliable dating of &quot;Dnyaneshwari&quot; to 1290 CE is based on textual and corroborative reference to the Yadava king Ramadeva as well as the name of the scribe and the &quot;samvat&quot; of its completion. It is also confirmed by the works of Namdev, another contemporary Bhakti movement saint-poet, who mentions Dnyaneshwari and who the Hindu tradition believes accompanied Dnyaneshwari on various pilgrimages. The authenticity of the &quot;Dnyaneshwari&quot; has been contested in light of Eknath comments in late 16th-century, where he stated he had restored the text to the original version, and asked &quot;neither change nor addition should be permitted&quot;. Scholars generally accept that this version is most faithful one, and this edition was identified in 1909 by V. K. Rajvade and published in 1959.

The narrative of the &quot;Dnyaneshwari&quot; closely follows the &quot;Bhagavad Gita&quot;, yet the commentary – called &quot;tika&quot; in the local tradition – is written in the form of a &quot;song-sermon&quot; that expands the explanation to include a discussion of the major Hindu philosophies and beliefs in the 13th-century. While the &quot;Gita&quot; has 700 verses, the &quot;Dnyaneshwari&quot; has about 9,000 verses. It includes references to the Vedas, the Upanishads and other major Hindu texts. The &quot;Dnyaneshwari&quot; is a rhythmic prose, that can be recited alone or chanted as a group. Each of its 9,000 verses consists of four lines (quarters) called an &quot;ovi&quot; (a form of Marathi meter). Unlike the &quot;Gita&quot; which has fixed number of syllables in its verses and which do not rhyme, the &quot;Dnyaneshwari&quot; commentary on the &quot;Gita&quot; has a variable number of syllables per line, of which first three of four do rhyme. Each line in the &quot;Dnyaneshwari&quot; typically has between three and thirteen syllables.

The text reverentially includes the names of numerous Hindu gods and goddesses from Vaishnavism, Shaivism, and Shaktism traditions, as well as Vedic ones such as Saraswati (Sharada). The last line of many of its verses include the characteristic &quot;Jnanadeva says&quot; or &quot;Says Jnanesvara&quot;. This format was adopted by other later era Bhakti movement poets, as well as in the Guru Granth of Sikhism.

<text>In the ancient world, Thynia (, ) was a region of Europe along the northern coast of the Propontis, opposite Bithynia on the Asian side. It was originally occupied by the Thyni, a Thracian people who came from Thrace. Note that in the Middle Ages, Mesothynia (&quot;middle Thynia&quot;) was the peninsula of modern Kocaeli.

According to Greek mythology, its name came from Thyneas (Θυνέας) son of Phineas (Φινέας).

In the Argonautica (Book 2), Jason and the Argonauts are turned aside from the Clashing Rocks at Bithynia, and go to the opposite coast to consult King Phineus.

<text>Dieter Baumann (, ; born 9 February 1965) is a German former athlete and 5000 m Olympic champion at the 1992 Summer Olympics. He also won the silver medal in the same event (5000 m) at the 1988 Summer Olympics.

In 1999, Baumann tested positive for the performance-enhancing drug nandrolone and received a two-year suspension from athletic competition.

== Biography ==
Born in Blaustein, West Germany, Baumann was one of the few non-African athletes who were able to seriously challenge the African dominance of middle-distance running during the 1990s. Baumann was equally adept at both the 1,500 m and 5,000 m distances.

Although Baumann came second in the 3,000 m at the European Indoor Championships in 1987, few considered him a medal chance at the 1988 Summer Olympics. The 5,000 m final at Seoul was won by John Ngugi from Kenya who broke away from the field early in the race. However, Baumann used his superior 1,500 m speed to outsprint the rest of the field in the final lap to win the silver medal. Baumann missed most of the 1990 season due to tendon trouble, but he returned in 1991 to finish fourth in the 5,000 m at the World Championships in Tokyo. At the end of the season, Baumann unexpectedly beat the Kenyan 5,000 m world champion Yobes Ondieki over 3,000 m in Cologne.

In early 1992, Baumann narrowly missed the 3,000 m world indoor record. In June, at a meeting in Seville, he set a new German record over 5,000 m (13:09.03). At the Olympics in Barcelona, the 5000 m final started at a fast pace, but then slowed, increasing Baumann&#x27;s advantage due to his finishing kick. However, he got boxed in amongst four African runners in the back straight of the last lap, and was only able to get out into the clear coming into the home straight. From there, Baumann launched into a devastating sprint to pass his opponents and win the gold medal. Later that year, Baumann pre-announced a world record attempt over 3,000 m for the meeting in Cologne. However, he did not win the race as Moses Kiptanui snatched the victory away by setting a new world record.

Baumann missed the next season due to injury, but was back at the European Championships in 1994. In the 5,000 m final, Baumann was always well placed in the field, and used his trademark devastating kick to outsprint Rob Denmark of the UK in the final lap to win the gold medal. At the World Championships in Gothenburg, in the 5,000 m final, Baumann inexplicably lost contact with the leading group with three laps to go, and struggled home in a disappointing ninth place. However, a few days after the disappointment of Gothenburg, Baumann ran one of the fastest races in his career when he broke his national record (13:01.72) to come second in Zürich behind Haile Gebrselassie.

At the 1996 Olympic Games in Atlanta, Baumann would find it a difficult challenge to successfully defend his Olympic title, because the other athletes had been setting much faster times than Baumann&#x27;s during 1995 and 1996 seasons. But Baumann still managed to finish in a creditable fourth place.

On his third World Championships in Athens, Baumann finished fifth in the 5,000 m. In Zürich, a few days later, he became the first European runner to break the 13-minute barrier when he finished in 12:54.70 min.

In the next year, he won a silver medal in 10,000 m at the European Championships held in Budapest. He also tried to defend his title over 5,000 m but did not even come close to winning a medal. In one of his last great races, he set a new personal best over 3,000 m in Monte Carlo (Monaco) in 7:30.50 min in August 1998.

===Doping suspension===
On 19 October 1999, Baumann tested positive for nandrolone and received a two-year suspension, thus missing the 2000 Summer Olympics. Baumann was voluntarily tested after the initial results by an independent institute. Extremely high levels of nandrolone continued to be found in the tests and the results of the tests fluctuated dramatically depending on which time of day Baumann was tested. After several weeks of voluntary tests, Baumann claimed that the results varied with the time of day because the nandrolone was in his toothpaste. The German Athletics Federation (DLV) stated that they believed Baumann that someone had manipulated his toothpaste and allowed him to start at the German championships where Baumann qualified for the Olympic Games in Sydney. However, the IAAF did not agree with that verdict and imposed a ban. Baumann tried to sue the IAAF before a German court but was unsuccessful. Those defending Baumann have pointed to the fact that the levels of nandrolone found in his body were completely abnormal for any athlete wishing to enhance his performance. Baumann&#x27;s opponents argued that he had no conclusive proof for his version of the story and could not name a suspect.

After the ban, Baumann came back in 2002 at the age of 37 and won the silver medal at 10,000 m at the European Championships in Munich. Baumann participated in the 2003 World Championships in Athletics in Paris at 10,000 m but did not finish the race. He retired in late 2003.

<text>Robert L. Esche (born January 22, 1978) is an American former professional ice hockey goaltender who is the current president of the Utica Comets of the American Hockey League (AHL) and the Utica City FC of the Major Arena Soccer League (MASL). He previously played eight seasons in the National Hockey League (NHL) for the Phoenix Coyotes and Philadelphia Flyers.

==Playing career==
Esche started his career with the Phoenix Coyotes, only to be traded to the Philadelphia Flyers in a deal involving Michal Handzuš and Brian Boucher. In 2004, he claimed the starting goaltending spot for the Flyers, and led them to the Eastern Conference Finals, only to fall in seven games to the eventual Stanley Cup champion Tampa Bay Lightning.

While playing in Russia for Ak Bars Kazan, he posted a record of 22–5–2 with a 2.01 goals against average (GAA) and a .912 save percentage, along with four shutouts.

Esche skated with Dinamo Minsk during the 2010–11 KHL season. In 2008–09, he posted a record of 21–14 with a 1.87 GAA and .912 save percentage, as well as nine shutouts.

On June 16, 2011, the SCL Tigers announced they had signed the 33-year-old Esche to a contract, where he played 40 games, going 15-25, with a 3.05 GAA and .898 save percentage.

==International play==
Esche has represented the United States in the 1997 and 1998 World Junior Ice Hockey Championships and the IIHF World Championships in 2000, shutting out Russia in Russia, an accomplishment he still lists as his greatest moment in hockey. He represented the US team in 2001 and also received the starting nod at the 2004 World Cup of Hockey.

Esche was named to the 2006 US Men&#x27;s Olympic Hockey Team in Turin. He played one game in the Olympic tournament, losing 5–4 to Russia.

Esche played for the 2008 Team USA Hockey team in the World Championships which took place in Canada. He had earned some starts after sitting out the first few games, including a 42 save performance in a controversial 3–2 loss against Finland. He also posted a 9–1 victory against Norway.

==Personal Life==
Esche has two children with his former wife Kelly.

Esche is nicknamed &quot;Chico&quot; after former NHL goaltender Chico Resch because his sticks were labeled R. Esche.

<text>Lee station is a suburban station on Burnt Ash Hill in Lee in south-east London, England, between Hither Green and Mottingham on the Dartford loop (also known as the Sidcup line). It is down the line from . The station name appears as Lee (London) on tickets. It was opened by the South Eastern Railway in 1866.

It is operated by Southeastern.

==History==

The station opened on 1 September 1866. Goods facilities were meagre at first with a single siding on the down side just east of the station building, but the goods yard was gradually enlarged over the years as freight traffic increased in importance. In the early 1870s a second siding was installed dedicated to coal, and a coal shed was erected across the track. Later a further pair of sidings was inserted alongside the existing tracks. An SER-designed signal cabin was positioned some east of the up side station structure. In 1955 the platforms were lengthened to accommodate ten carriage trains. In British Railways days the SR green totem signs displayed the station name as Lee for Burnt Ash. In 1963, Colfe&#x27;s School moved to its current location adjacent to Lee station, the station remains a method of transport for a significant portion of students. The goods yard closed in 1968. In 1988 the clapboard up side ticket office was demolished and replaced by a new ticket office. In 1992 the platforms were lengthened to accommodate twelve carriage trains. 

==Location==

Lee Station is in Burnt Ash Road, Lee, in the London Borough of Lewisham.

==Connections==
London Buses routes 202, 261 and 273 serve the station.

==Facilities==

The station has two platforms. Platform 1, the up platform for services to London, and Platform 2, the down platform for services to Kent. A ticket hall is situated on the up side but the station has no ticket gates. There is a subway connecting both platforms. There is step free access to both platforms.

==Services==

All services at Lee are operated by Southeastern using , , and EMUs.

The typical off-peak service in trains per hour is:
* 4 tph to London Charing Cross (2 of these run direct and 2 run via )
* 4 tph to of which 2 continue to 

Additional services, including trains to and from London Cannon Street via either Lewisham, or via and , and to London Blackfriars call at the station during the peak hours.

<doc id="842353" wikidata="Q1589976" url="?curid=842353" title="House of Balliol">
<text>The House of Balliol (de Bailleul) was a noble family originating from the village of Bailleul in Picardy. They held estates in England, granted during the reign of King William Rufus. Through marriage, they had claims to the Throne of Scotland. One member of the family, John Balliol, was named King of Scotland after the disputed succession following extinction of the Dunkeld line. John was deposed, leading to the First War of Scottish Independence. His son, Edward Balliol, also briefly controlled the Scottish throne during the Second War of Scottish Independence. Edward had no issue, and the direct line went extinct with him.

==List of heads of the Balliol estates==
* Guy I de Balliol (died before 1130 × 1133), established lordship in northern England in 1090s
* Bernard I de Balliol (died 1154 x 1162), nephew of Guy
* Guy II de Balliol (died early 1160s x 1167), son of Bernard
* Bernard II de Balliol (died ), brother of above
* Eustace de Balliol (died c. 1209), cousin of above
* Hugh de Balliol (died 1229), son of above
* John I de Balliol (died 1268), son of above, the founder of Balliol College
* John II de Balliol (died 1314), son of above, reigned as King of Scotland from 1292 to 1296, as a descendant of David I of Scotland of the House of Dunkeld.
* Edward de Balliol (died 1364), eldest son of John; from 1332 to 1356 he was a pretender to the Scottish throne with the support of England, in opposition to David II of Scotland.

The last two on the list both had English support for their claims but both were deposed. Edward died without issue, but the Balliol descent continued through his cousin Christine de Lindsay (granddaughter of John I), who married Enguerrand V, Lord of Coucy, to the lords of Coucy and ultimately the Bourbon kings of France and Spain.

<doc id="842354" wikidata="Q8051559" url="?curid=842354" title="Yelland">
<text>Yelland is a village of 2,000 inhabitants situated in North Devon between Instow and Fremington in the English county of Devon. Yelland is included within the parish of Fremington.

==Amenities==
There is a garage, and a small industrial park. Residents use the nearest major village Fremington, or the slightly smaller village of Instow for their daily needs. Supermarkets are located in the nearest towns - Barnstaple and Bideford. There is no church situated in the village.

Regular bus services are operated by Stagecoach Devon. The nearest railway station is Barnstaple railway station, and Exeter International Airport is the nearest passenger international airport by road. The nearest international ferry port is at Plymouth.

Children in the area generally attend Fremington or Instow Primary Schools at primary school age, and Bideford College, Pilton Community College or The Park Community School at secondary school age. College students attend Bideford College&#x27;s sixth form, Petroc (formerly North Devon College), or may travel further afield.

==Archaeology==

Near Lower Yelland Farm is a Bronze Age megalithic site consisting of a double stone row. They are unusual in being sited at the river&#x27;s edge rather than on higher moorland. Since its construction, thousands of years ago, the site has been smothered by silt from the widening of the River Taw. The stones are no longer visible.

==Walking trails==
Visitors to Yelland and the surrounding area enjoy the views and scenic paths for walking. The Tarka Trail and South West Coast Path are easily accessible from the Yelland Power Station Road. Also Lower Yelland Nature Reserve.

==East Yelland Coal-fired Power Station==
The East Yelland Power Station was once an operational coal-fired electricity production plant located in a partially hidden area on the estuary, next to the Tarka Trail. The power station was one of only two located to the west of Hinkley Point.

The power station was sanctioned in September 1949, and an extension approved in June 1950. The first generating set was commissioned in July 1953 and subsequent sets in November 1953, September 1954, October 1956, December 1956, and October 1957. The power station was formally opened on 21 April 1955 by Lord Fortescue. The station had a net capability to deliver 170 MW of electricity from six Parsons 31 MW turbo-alternators. There was also a 225 kW diesel engine house service set. The Thompson radiant heat steam boilers were fired by twin chain grate stokers could deliver 253 kg/s of steam at 42.7 bar and 468 °C. Cooling water to condense steam in the plant was drawn from the river estuary. The generating capacity and output was:&lt;graph&gt;{

}&lt;/graph&gt;

In the year ending 31 March 1981 the station delivered just 0.2 per cent of its capability. In March 1984, it was announced by the Central Electricity Generating Board that the power station would close by the end of October that year.

Fuel for the power station was obtained from coal mines in South Wales, and was transported across the Bristol Channel onto a jetty specially constructed for the power station. However, due to the closure of the coal mines in the 1980s, coal would be more expensive to obtain from other areas of the country. Therefore, it was more economical to close the power station.

Today, most of the power station, which covered an area of 3.1ha, has been demolished.

<text>Paleomagnetism (occasionally palaeomagnetism) is the study of prehistoric Earth&#x27;s magnetic fields recorded in rocks, sediment, or archeological materials. Geophysicists who specialize in paleomagnetism are called &quot;paleomagnetists.&quot;

Certain magnetic minerals in rocks can record the direction and intensity of Earth&#x27;s magnetic field at the time they formed. This record provides information on the past behavior of the geomagnetic field and the past location of tectonic plates. The record of geomagnetic reversals preserved in volcanic and sedimentary rock sequences (magnetostratigraphy) provides a time-scale that is used as a geochronologic tool.

Evidence from paleomagnetism led to the revival of the continental drift hypothesis and its transformation into the modern theory of plate tectonics. Apparent polar wander paths provided the first clear geophysical evidence for continental drift, while marine magnetic anomalies did the same for seafloor spreading. Paleomagnetic data continues to extend the history of plate tectonics back in time, constraining the ancient position and movement of continents and continental fragments (terranes).

The field of paleomagnetism also encompasses equivalent measurements of samples from other Solar System bodies, such as Moon rocks and meteorites, where it is used to investigate the ancient magnetic fields of those bodies and dynamo theory. Paleomagnetism relies on developments in rock magnetism and overlaps with biomagnetism, magnetic fabrics (used as strain indicators in rocks and soils), and environmental magnetism.

==History==

As early as the 18th century, it was noticed that compass needles deviated near strongly magnetized outcrops. In 1797, Alexander von Humboldt attributed this magnetization to lightning strikes (and lightning strikes do often magnetize surface rocks). 19th century studies of the direction of magnetization in rocks showed that some recent lavas were magnetized parallel to Earth&#x27;s magnetic field. Early in the 20th century, work by David, Bernard Brunhes and Paul Louis Mercanton showed that many rocks were magnetized antiparallel to the field. Japanese geophysicist Motonori Matuyama showed in the late 1920s that Earth&#x27;s magnetic field reversed in the mid-Quaternary, a reversal now known as the Brunhes–Matuyama reversal.

British physicist P.M.S. Blackett provided a major impetus to paleomagnetism by inventing a sensitive astatic magnetometer in 1956. His intent was to test his theory that the geomagnetic field was related to Earth&#x27;s rotation, a theory that he ultimately rejected; but the astatic magnetometer became the basic tool of paleomagnetism and led to a revival of the theory of continental drift.

Alfred Wegener first proposed in 1915 that continents had once been joined together and had since moved apart. Although he produced an abundance of circumstantial evidence, his theory met with little acceptance for two reasons: (1) no mechanism for continental drift was known, and (2) there was no way to reconstruct the movements of the continents over time. Keith Runcorn and Edward A. Irving constructed apparent polar wander paths for Europe and North America. These curves diverged but could be reconciled if it was assumed that the continents had been in contact up to 200 million years ago. This provided the first clear geophysical evidence for continental drift. Then in 1963, Morley, Vine and Matthews showed that marine magnetic anomalies provided evidence for seafloor spreading.

==Fields==
Paleomagnetism is studied on a number of scales:
* &quot;Geomagnetic secular variation&quot; is the small-scale changes in the direction and intensity of Earth&#x27;s magnetic field. The magnetic north pole is constantly shifting relative to the axis of rotation of Earth. Magnetism is a vector and so magnetic field variation is studied by palaeodirectional measurements of magnetic declination and magnetic inclination and palaeointensity measurements.
* &quot;Magnetostratigraphy&quot; uses the polarity reversal history of Earth&#x27;s magnetic field recorded in rocks to determine the age of those rocks. &quot;Reversals&quot; have occurred at irregular intervals throughout Earth&#x27;s history. The age and pattern of these reversals is known from the study of sea floor spreading zones and the dating of volcanic rocks.

==Principles==
The study of paleomagnetism is possible because iron-bearing minerals such as magnetite may record past polarity of Earth&#x27;s magnetic field. Magnetic signatures in rocks can be recorded by several different mechanisms.

===Thermoremanent magnetization===

Iron-titanium oxide minerals in basalt and other igneous rocks may preserve the direction of Earth&#x27;s magnetic field when the rocks cool through the Curie temperatures of those minerals. The Curie temperature of magnetite, a spinel-group iron oxide, is about , whereas most basalt and gabbro are completely crystallized at temperatures below . Hence, the mineral grains are not rotated physically to align with Earth&#x27;s magnetic field, but rather they may record the orientation of that field. The record so preserved is called a thermoremanent magnetization (TRM).

Because complex oxidation reactions may occur as igneous rocks cool after crystallization, the orientations of Earth&#x27;s magnetic field are not always accurately recorded, nor is the record necessarily maintained. Nonetheless, the record has been preserved well enough in basalts of oceanic crust to have been critical in the development of theories of sea floor spreading related to plate tectonics.

TRM can also be recorded in pottery kilns, hearths, and burned adobe buildings. The discipline based on the study of thermoremanent magnetisation in archaeological materials is called archaeomagnetic dating. Although the Māori people of New Zealand do not make pottery, their 700- to 800-year-old steam ovens, or hāngī, provide adequate archaeomagnetic material.

===Detrital remanent magnetization===
In a completely different process, magnetic grains in sediments may align with the magnetic field during or soon after deposition; this is known as &quot;detrital remanent magnetization&quot;. If the magnetization is acquired as the grains are deposited, the result is a depositional detrital remanent magnetization; if it is acquired soon after deposition, it is a post-depositional detrital remanent magnetization.

===Chemical remanent magnetization===

In a third process, magnetic grains grow during chemical reactions and record the direction of the magnetic field at the time of their formation. The field is said to be recorded by &quot;chemical remanent magnetization&quot; (CRM). A common form is held by the mineral hematite, another iron oxide. Hematite forms through chemical oxidation reactions of other minerals in the rock including magnetite. Red beds, clastic sedimentary rocks (such as sandstones) are red because of hematite that formed during sedimentary diagenesis. The CRM signatures in red beds can be quite useful, and they are common targets in magnetostratigraphy studies.

===Isothermal remanent magnetization===
Remanence that is acquired at a fixed temperature is called &quot;isothermal remanent magnetization&quot; (IRM). Remanence of this sort is not useful for paleomagnetism, but it can be acquired as a result of lightning strikes. Lightning-induced remanent magnetization can be distinguished by its high intensity and rapid variation in direction over scales of centimeters.

IRM is often induced in drill cores by the magnetic field of the steel core barrel. This contaminant is generally parallel to the barrel, and most of it can be removed by heating up to about 400 °C or demagnetizing in a small alternating field. In the laboratory, IRM is induced by applying fields of various strengths and is used for many purposes in rock magnetism.

===Viscous remanent magnetization===
Viscous remanent magnetization is remanence that is acquired by ferromagnetic materials influenced by a magnetic field for some time. In rocks, this remanence is typically aligned in the direction of the modern-day geomagnetic field. The fraction of a rock’s overall magnetization that is a viscous remanent magnetization is dependent on the magnetic mineralogy.

== Sampling ==
The oldest rocks on the ocean floor are 200 Ma: very young when compared with the oldest continental rocks which date from 3.8 Ga. In order to collect paleomagnetic data dating beyond 200 Ma, scientists turn to magnetite-bearing samples on land to reconstruct Earth&#x27;s ancient field orientation. Paleomagnetists, like many geologists, gravitate towards outcrops because layers of rock are exposed. Road cuts are a convenient man-made source of outcrops.
:&quot;And everywhere, in profusion along this half mile of [roadcut], there are small, neatly cored holes ... appears to be a Hilton for wrens and purple martins.&quot;

There are two main goals of sampling:
# Retrieve samples with accurate orientations, and
# Reduce statistical uncertainty.

One way to achieve the first goal is to use a rock coring drill that has an auger tipped with diamond bits. The drill cuts a cylindrical space around some rock. Into this space is inserted a pipe with a compass and inclinometer attached. These provide the orientations. Before this device is removed, a mark is scratched on the sample. After the sample is broken off, the mark can be augmented for clarity.

==Applications==
Paleomagnetic evidence of both reversals and polar wandering data was instrumental in verifying the theories of continental drift and plate tectonics in the 1960s and 1970s. Some applications of paleomagnetic evidence to reconstruct histories of terranes have continued to arouse controversies. Paleomagnetic evidence is also used in constraining possible ages for rocks and processes and in reconstructions of the deformational histories of parts of the crust.

Reversal magnetostratigraphy is often used to estimate the age of sites bearing fossils and hominin remains. Conversely, for a fossil of known age, the paleomagnetic data can fix the latitude at which the fossil was laid down. Such a &quot;paleolatitude&quot; provides information about the geological environment at the time of deposition. Paleomagnetic studies are combined with geochronological methods to determine absolute ages for rocks in which the magnetic record is preserved. For igneous rocks such as basalt, commonly used methods include potassium–argon and argon–argon geochronology.

<text>The Boeing YC-14 is a twinjet short take-off and landing (STOL) tactical military transport aircraft. It was Boeing&#x27;s entrant into the United States Air Force&#x27;s Advanced Medium STOL Transport (AMST) competition, which aimed to replace the Lockheed C-130 Hercules as the USAF&#x27;s standard STOL tactical transport. Although both the YC-14 and the competing McDonnell Douglas YC-15 were successful, neither aircraft entered production. The AMST project was ended in 1979 and replaced by the C-X program.

==Design and development==

In mid-1970, the USAF began a paper study, the Tactical Aircraft Investigation (TAI), with Boeing, McDonnell Douglas, and other companies to look at possible tactical transport aircraft designs. This study was a precursor to what became the Advanced Medium STOL Transport program. As a part of this program, Boeing began to look at various high-lift aircraft configurations. Boeing had earlier proposed an underwing externally blown flap solution for their competitor for the Lockheed C-5 Galaxy, and had put this to good use when it modified its losing entry into the Boeing 747. The company had also done studies with the original Boeing 707 prototype, the Boeing 367-80, adding extensive leading and trailing edge devices using blown flaps. For the TAI studies, Boeing again looked at those mechanisms, as well as new mechanisms like boundary layer control. However, none of these studied designs were particularly appealing to Boeing.

The Boeing engineers were aware that NASA had carried out a series of &quot;powered lift&quot; studies some time earlier, including both externally blown flaps, as well as upper-surface blowing (USB), an unusual variation. In the USB system, the engine is arranged over the top surface of the wing, blowing over the flaps. When the flaps are lowered, the Coandă effect makes the jet exhaust &quot;stick&quot; to the flaps and bend down toward the ground. They searched for additional research on the concept and found that half-span upper-surface blowing research had been conducted in the NASA Langley 12-foot (3.7 m) tunnel. An examination of the preliminary results suggested that the system was as effective as any of the other concepts previously studied. Boeing immediately started to build wind-tunnel models to verify the NASA data with layouts more closely matching their own designs. By the end of 1971, several models were being actively studied.

Another NASA project the engineers were interested in was the supercritical airfoil, designed by Richard Whitcomb. The supercritical design promised to lower transonic drag greatly, as much as a swept wing in some situations. This allowed an aircraft with such a wing to have low drag in cruise while also having a wing planform more suitable for lower-speed flight—swept wings have several undesirable characteristics at low speed. Additionally, the design has a larger leading edge radius that makes it particularly suitable for low-speed high-lift applications like a transport. Boeing incorporated the concept into their design, the first non-experimental aircraft to do so.

The request for proposal (RFP) was issued in January 1972, asking for operations into a 2,000-foot (610 m) semi-prepared field at with a 27,000 lb (12,000 kg) payload in both directions with no refueling. For comparison, the C-130 of that era required about 4,000 ft (1,200 m) for this load. Five companies submitted designs at this stage of the competition, Boeing with their Model 953 in March 1972. On 10 November 1972 the downselect was carried out, and Boeing and McDonnell Douglas won development contracts for two prototypes each.

Wind tunnel tests continued through this period. In November, John K. Wimpress again visited Langley looking for an update on NASA&#x27;s own USB program. Joe Johnson and Dudley Hammond both reported on testing and showed Wimpress data that verified the high-lift performance that Boeing had quoted in its proposal. By December 1975, Boeing and NASA Langley had arranged a contract for a full-scale USB testbed, which Boeing built at their Tulalip test facility consisting of a 1/4-scale wing with one JT-15D engine and a partial fuselage. Langley was particularly interested in the effectiveness of the D-shaped nozzle that directed the jet flow over the upper surface of the wing, as well as the resulting sound levels, at that time a major focus of NASA&#x27;s civilian aerodynamics research.

Two major problems were found and corrected during testing. The first was a problem with air circulating around the wing when operating at low speeds close to the ground, which had a serious effect on the spreading of the jet flow through the nozzle. This led to flow separation near the flap, and a decrease in the effectiveness of the USB system. In response, Boeing added a series of vortex generators on the upper surface of the wing, which retracted when the flap was raised above 30°. Additionally, the tail surfaces were initially placed well aft in order to maximize control effectiveness. This positioning turned out to interfere with the airflow over the wings during USB operations, and a new tail with a more vertical profile was introduced to move the elevator forward.

==Operational history==
The first Boeing YC-14 (serial number &quot;72-1873&quot;) flew on 9 August 1976. Two aircraft were built, the second being s/n &quot;72-1874&quot;. The competing YC-15 had started flights almost a year earlier. Head-to-head flight testing at Edwards Air Force Base started in early November 1976. During flight testing, the YC-14 was flown at speeds as low as and as high as Mach0.78 at . However, it was found that the YC-14&#x27;s drag was 11% higher than originally predicted. Modifications developed in wind tunnel testing, comprising the addition of vortex generators to the upper aft portion of the nacelles, deletion of the nozzle door actuator fairing, alterations to the aft end of the landing gear pods and the addition of aft fuselage strakes, reduced this drag increment to 7%. The YC-14 also demonstrated the capability to carry the M60A2 main battle tank, which was not demonstrated with the YC-15.

At the completion of testing in the late summer of 1977, the YC-14 prototypes were returned to Boeing. The prototypes were not scrapped; one is stored at the 309th Aerospace Maintenance and Regeneration Group (AMARG), located at Davis-Monthan Air Force Base and the other is on display at the nearby Pima Air &amp; Space Museum.


By this point, the seeds of the AMST program&#x27;s demise had already been sown. In March 1976, the Air Force Chief of Staff, Gen. David C. Jones, asked the Air Force Systems Command to see if it would be possible to use a single model of the AMST for both strategic and tactical airlift roles, or alternatively, if it would be possible to develop conventional derivatives of the AMST for the strategic airlift role. This led to a series of studies that basically stated that such a modification was not easy, and would require major changes to either design to produce a much larger aircraft.

Both the YC-14 and YC-15 met or exceeded the AMST specifications under most conditions. However, the increasing importance of the strategic vs. tactical mission eventually led to the end of the AMST program in December 1979. Then, in November 1979, the C-X Task Force formed to develop the required strategic aircraft with tactical capability. The C-X program selected a proposal for an enlarged and upgraded YC-15 that was later developed into C-17 Globemaster III.

Upper surface blowing remains a fairly rare concept in use, and has been seen only on a few other aircraft, such as the Antonov An-72.

<doc id="842372" wikidata="Q182178" url="?curid=842372" title="McDonnell Douglas YC-15">
<text>The McDonnell Douglas YC-15 is a prototype four-engine short take-off and landing (STOL) tactical transport. It was McDonnell Douglas&#x27; entrant into the United States Air Force&#x27;s Advanced Medium STOL Transport (AMST) competition to replace the Lockheed C-130 Hercules as the USAF&#x27;s standard STOL tactical transport. In the end, neither the YC-15 nor the Boeing YC-14 was ordered into production, although the YC-15&#x27;s basic design would be used to form the successful McDonnell Douglas (later Boeing) C-17 Globemaster III.

==Design and development==
In 1968, the USAF started work on a series of prototype proposals, which would lead to both the AMST project and the Light Weight Fighter. The official Request for proposal (RFP) was issued in January 1972, asking for operations into a semi-prepared field with a payload and a mission radius. For comparison, the C-130 of that era required about for this load. Proposals were submitted by Bell, Boeing, Fairchild, McDonnell Douglas and the Lockheed/North American Rockwell team at this stage of the competition. On 10 November 1972, the two top bids (from Boeing and McDonnell Douglas) were selected. The companies were awarded development contracts for two prototypes each. McDonnell Douglas&#x27; prototype was designated YC-15.

McDonnell Douglas&#x27;s design incorporated a supercritical wing, the result of NASA research carried out by the already famous Richard Whitcomb. This wing design dramatically lowers transonic wave drag by as much as 30% compared to more conventional profiles, while at the same time offering excellent low-speed lift. Most contemporary aircraft used swept wings to lower wave drag, but this led to poor low-speed handling, which made them unsuitable for STOL operations.

The design team also chose to use externally blown flaps to increase lift. This system uses double-slotted flaps to direct part of the jet exhaust downwards, while the rest of the exhaust passed through the flap and then followed the downward curve due to the Coandă effect. Although the effects had been studied for some time at NASA, along with similar concepts, until the introduction of the turbofan the hot and concentrated exhaust of existing engines made the system difficult to use. By the time of the AMST project, engines had changed dramatically and now provided larger volumes of less-concentrated and much cooler air. The YC-15 prototype was the first jet powered aircraft to use externally blown flaps. 

For later prototypes, there were several modifications including a computer on the YC-15 was devised that would calculate the best flap angle for various flight conditions given the current gross weight. Together these modifications offered a reduction in approach speed of 10 kn.

For the YC-15, four engines were used, versions of the Pratt &amp; Whitney JT8D-17 widely used on the Boeing 727 and Douglas DC-9. The YC-15 borrowed components from other McDonnell Douglas aircraft, with its nose gear coming from the Douglas DC-8 and the nose section and cockpit being derived from the Douglas DC-10. Parts borrowed from other aircraft included the Universal Aerial Refueling Receptacle Slipway Installation (UARRSI), taken from a Fairchild A-10, anti-tipover stabilizer struts from the Lockheed C-141 Starlifter, pumps taken from the McDonnell Douglas F-15 Eagle, Lockheed C-5 Galaxy, DC-9 and C-141 and actuators taken from the C-5 Galaxy and DC-10. In addition, the environmental cooling system was composed of components taken from the DC-9, C-141 and Boeing KC-135.

The YC-15 interior cargo hold was large, with dimensions 47 x 11.8 x 11.4 feet.

The YC-15 was the first aircraft to offer pilots a heads up display. It was especially designed to help with short field landings, showing the pilot the horizon, flight path scale, airspeed indexer and touchdown point.

==Operational history==


Two YC-15s were built, one with a wingspan of (#72-1876) and one of (#72-1875). Both were long and powered by four Pratt &amp; Whitney JT8D-17 engines, each with of thrust.

The first flight was on 26 August 1975. The second prototype followed in December. They were tested for some time at McDonnell Douglas as the Boeing entry was not ready until almost a year later. In November 1976, both designs were transferred to Edwards Air Force Base for head-to-head testing, including lifting heavy loads like tanks and artillery from dirt airfields at Graham Ranch, off the end of Runway 22.

In Phase II of the flight test program, a &quot;refanned&quot; Pratt &amp; Whitney JT8D-209 was tested in No. 1 nacelle of 72–1876, and a CFM International CFM56 was tested in the No. 1 nacelle of 72–1875. In addition, a new wing with increased chord and span was flown on 72–1875.

The YC-15 met specifications under most, but not all, conditions. It was a very good STOL plane for its size. At a gross weight of 149,300lbs, the YC-15 flew short landing approaches at only 87 kn at a 6 degree glide slope yielding a sink rate of 15.4 feet per second, compared with normal approaches that were made at about 127 kn with a typical 8-12 feet per second sink rate. For short landings, the touch down aim-point was only about 300 feet from the runway end. Pilots of the YC-15 tested both no-flare and with-flare landing techniques in STOL mode. Because of slow actuation of the thrust reversers, testing at Edwards AFB showed the plane was unable to consistently stop in “hot-and-high” conditions in the required 2000 feet.

However, the seeds of the AMST program&#x27;s demise had already been sown. In March 1976, the Air Force Chief of Staff, Gen. David C. Jones, asked the Air Force Systems Command to see if it was possible to use a single model of the AMST for both strategic and tactical airlift roles, or alternatively, if it was possible to develop non-STOL derivatives of the AMST for the strategic airlift role. This led to a series of studies that basically stated that such a modification was not easy, and would require major changes to either design to produce a much larger aircraft.

The increasing importance of the strategic vs. tactical mission eventually led to the end of the AMST program in December 1979. Then, in November 1979, the C-X Task Force formed to develop the required strategic aircraft with tactical capability. The C-X program selected a proposal for an enlarged and upgraded YC-15 that was later developed into the C-17 Globemaster III. The Lockheed C-130 Hercules would be further improved into the C-130J and remains in service.

After the flight test program, the two aircraft were stored at the AMARC, located at Davis-Monthan Air Force Base. One aircraft (72-1875) was subsequently moved to the nearby Pima Air &amp; Space Museum in 1981, but was returned to flying status by McDonnell Douglas in 1996; it was first reflown on 11 April 1997. On 16 April 1997, the aircraft was ferried to Long Beach, California to support the C-17 program. On 11 July 1998, the aircraft suffered a massive failure of the No. 1 engine during flight and made an emergency landing at Palmdale, California. On inspection, the aircraft was deemed too expensive to repair and was stored at Palmdale. In 2008, the aircraft was moved by road to Edwards AFB, where it is now on display at the Air Force Flight Test Center Museum&#x27;s &quot;Century Circle&quot; display area, just outside the base&#x27;s west gate. The other airframe (72–1876), which had remained on Celebrity Row at the AMARC for many years, was destroyed in place in April 2012.

<doc id="842379" wikidata="Q261534" url="?curid=842379" title="Diego Forlán">
<text>Diego Forlán Corazo (born 19 May 1979) is a Uruguayan professional tennis player, football manager and former football player who played as a striker. Regarded as one of the best forwards of his generation, Forlán is a two-time winner of both the Pichichi Trophy and the European Golden Shoe at club level. With the Uruguay national team, he had notable individual success at the 2010 FIFA World Cup, finishing as joint top scorer with five goals, winning the goal of the tournament, and winning the Golden Ball as the tournament&#x27;s best player.

Forlán began his career in his native Uruguay as a youth player with Peñarol and Danubio, before joining Argentine club Independiente. After rising through their youth team and after a successful four-year spell, he sealed a move to England with Manchester United in 2002. His form for United was not as successful as at Independiente, although he won the Premier League in 2002–03 and the FA Cup in 2003–04. 

In the summer of 2004, Forlán moved to Spanish side Villarreal. In his first season in Spanish football, he won the Pichichi Trophy. After two more successful seasons with Villarreal, Forlán joined Atlético Madrid, where he once again became the league&#x27;s top scorer, and became the first player to win the Pichichi Trophy twice since Ronaldo in 1996–97 and 2003–04. Forlán scored in Atlético&#x27;s 2010 Europa League final victory against Fulham. In 2011, he joined Inter Milan of Italy before moving to Internacional in 2012. After spells in Japan with Cerezo Osaka, back in Uruguay with his boyhood club Peñarol, in India with Mumbai City and in Hong Kong with Kitchee, Forlán retired from professional football in August 2019.

Forlán also had a successful international career, scoring 36 times for his country between his debut in 2002 and his retirement in 2015, including six goals at FIFA World Cups. On 12 July 2011, at the 2011 Copa América in Argentina, which Uruguay won, Forlán earned his 79th international cap in a match against Mexico, breaking the record held since 1986 by goalkeeper Rodolfo Rodríguez. On 20 June 2013, in a match against Nigeria at the 2013 Confederations Cup, Forlán became the first Uruguayan to win 100 caps. Forlán was Uruguay&#x27;s all-time leading top scorer from 2011 until Luis Suárez overtook him two years later.

==Early life and education==
Forlán was born on 19 May 1979 and raised in the neighborhood of Carrasco in the capital city of Montevideo. His family — which included three brothers, a sister, four cousins, his maternal grandmother and her sister — resided in an apartment building on Potosi street, a short distance from the Hotel Carrasco and the Rambla. He is the son of former player and Uruguayan international Pablo Forlán and the grandson of Juan Carlos Corazzo through his mother, Pilar Corazo.

Forlán attended multiple schools in the private and state sector. He started at Liceo Francés Jules Supervielle in Buceo, but later switched to Erwy School because it was closer to his home. This was followed by Scuola Italiana di Montevideo and then Liceo 15 in Carrasco. He learned English at school from a young age. As a child, Forlán played tennis at the Carrasco Lawn Tennis Club, in addition to football, which often took place on the streets.

On 14 September 1991, Forlán&#x27;s sister Alejandra was seriously injured and eventually left handicapped by a car accident that also killed her boyfriend. The cost of the medical bills plunged his family into financial crisis, though this was later averted due to the fundraising efforts of Diego Maradona. Until this point Forlán was also dedicated to tennis, but ultimately focussed more on football, like his father and grandfather, in the hope that he might contribute to paying for his sister&#x27;s treatment.

==Club career==
===Early career===
Forlán was a boyhood fan of Peñarol and played youth football for both Peñarol and Danubio In 1995, a 16-year-old Forlán moved to France, where he spent four months on trial at Nancy, but was ultimately not offered a contract by manager László Bölöni.

===Independiente===
Forlán received an offer to join Argentine side Independiente through the help of one of his father&#x27;s contacts, José Omar Pastoriza. He soon accepted, rejecting a simultaneous offer from Boca Juniors. Arriving in Argentina on 28 January 1998, Forlán made his way up the Independiente reserve teams and thanks to strong performances, started training with the first team. Injuries to several forward players who were ahead of him in the pecking order created an opportunity for the young Uruguayan, who made his professional debut on 26 October 1998 in a match against Argentinos Juniors.

Forlán scored 37 goals in 80 league games. His goalscoring attracted the attention of European sides, and in January 2002, Independiente agreed a £6.9 million deal with Middlesbrough of the Premier League; the transfer fee would be paid over 18 installments. Forlán travelled to England expecting to negotiate with Middlesbrough, but at the last minute Manchester United gazumped the Teesside club, offering Independiente the same fee in a single payment, as well as a more lucrative salary for Forlán. On arriving in England, he negotiated with United officials for four hours, then informed the press of his decision. &quot;Manchester United is a big club, so I&#x27;ve decided to go there,&quot; he explained. &quot;The thing is, they offered more money than Middlesbrough.&quot; He signed for United soon after.

===Manchester United===
Forlán was signed for Manchester United by Sir Alex Ferguson for £6.9 million on 22 January 2002. He made his debut on 29 January as a 76th-minute substitute for Ole Gunnar Solskjær in a 4–0 away win at Bolton Wanderers. He made his first start in 4–0 home victory over Tottenham Hotspur on 6 March. Forlán made 13 Premier League and five UEFA Champions League appearances in the 2001–02 season but did not score.&lt;ref name=&quot;2001/02&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

On 18 September 2002, Forlán came on as a 56th-minute substitute for Ryan Giggs in a Champions League match versus Maccabi Haifa. He scored his first United goal as an 89th-minute penalty kick in the 5–2 win. His first Premier League goal was a 77th-minute equaliser in a home 1–1 draw against Aston Villa on 26 October. In Forlán&#x27;s next Premier League game, at home to Southampton on 2 November, he came on as a 79th-minute substitute for United&#x27;s goalscorer Phil Neville with the score at 1–1, and scored the winner with a dipping shot over Southampton goalkeeper Antti Niemi in the 85th minute. The goal also became notable due to his goal celebration where he ripped off his jersey, but then struggled to put it back on as the game recommenced, with Forlán making a blocked tackle while shirtless.

On 1 December, Forlán scored his first brace for Manchester United with goals in the 64th and 67th minute of an away 2–1 Premier League win at rivals Liverpool. On 17 December 2002, Forlán scored the winning goal as United defeated Chelsea in the quarter-finals of the Football League Cup. On 18 January 2003, Forlán scored a 90th-minute winning goal to again defeat Chelsea, this time in a Premier League match. Manchester United went on to win the Premier League title in 2002–03, and Forlán scored six goals to make him the club&#x27;s third best-scoring striker that season after Ruud van Nistelrooy and Ole Gunnar Solskjær.

At the start of the 2003–04 season, Forlán played seven Premier League games without scoring. This run was broken on 25 October, when he equalised the score to 1–1 in the 45th minute of a home match versus Fulham, a game which United lost 3–1. Forlán then scored a goal in his three subsequent matches in three different competitions, starting with an extra-time goal in an away League Cup game at Leeds United which Manchester United won 3–2. This was followed by the opener in a 3–0 home Premier League victory over Portsmouth and a sixth-minute goal in a win by the same score over Rangers in the Champions League. In his next Champions League game, he scored the 85th-minute winner for United over Panathinaikos in a 1–0 away victory. On 6 December 2003, Forlán scored two injury-time goals as Manchester United beat Aston Villa 4–0 at home in the Premier League. These were Forlán&#x27;s last Premier League goals despite him playing 10 more league games over the season. His only other Manchester United goal was in a 3–0 victory over Northampton Town of Division Three on 24 January 2004 in the FA Cup. Diego Forlán did not feature at all in United&#x27;s 3–0 victory over Millwall in the 2004 FA Cup Final on 22 May 2004.

He started the 2004–05 season with Manchester United and played in a Champions League qualifier against Dinamo București and a 3–1 defeat to Arsenal on 8 August in the 2004 FA Community Shield. His last match for United was their first Premier League game that season, a 1–0 defeat away to Chelsea on 15 August.

United supporters would continue to sing Forlán&#x27;s name in tribute to the two goals he scored against Liverpool for several years after Forlán&#x27;s departure from the club, with the chant &quot;He came from Uruguay, he made the scousers cry&quot;. Forlán spoke of this fondly in 2010.

===Villarreal===
Forlán was strongly linked with a move to Spanish clubs Levante and Athletic Bilbao, but on 21 August 2004, he signed with Villarreal.

Forlán&#x27;s debut for Villarreal was on 30 August 2004, starting away to rivals Valencia and scoring his club&#x27;s goal in the 77th minute of a 2–1 defeat. His next goal came in a home 2–0 win over Real Zaragoza on 3 October, and was followed with an equaliser in a 1–1 draw at Mallorca and the final goal of a 4–0 win at home to Numancia. Between 12 December 2004 and 16 January 2005, Forlán scored seven goals in five Primera División matches, including a brace in a 3–0 home victory over Barcelona on 9 January. On 22 May 2005, he scored his first hat-trick for a European club with all of Villarreal&#x27;s goals in a 3–3 away draw against eventual league champions Barcelona. A week later, he scored two in a 4–1 victory over local rivals Levante as Villarreal ended the season in third, qualifying for the Champions League for the first time in the club&#x27;s history. Forlán won the 2004–05 Pichichi Trophy for most goals in La Liga, with 25. He also shared the 2005 European Golden Boot with Arsenal striker Thierry Henry.

His goal rate declined in the 2005–06 season as Villarreal underwent several changes, yet the club reached the semi-finals of the Champions League where they were knocked out by Arsenal.

In 2006–07, he ended the season with 19 goals in 36 league appearances.

===Atlético Madrid===
====2007–08 season====

Forlán was linked with a transfer jointly with Juan Román Riquelme to Atlético Madrid in exchange for Luis Perea plus cash in June 2007. On 30 June 2007, following the departure of their captain Fernando Torres to Liverpool, Atlético Madrid confirmed that they had agreed to a fee of around €21 million. He returned to England in February 2008 to take part in Atlético&#x27;s UEFA Cup clash against Bolton Wanderers (the club against whom he made his Manchester United debut), but the side lost out 1–0 on aggregate. In May 2008, Forlán helped Atlético qualify for the Champions League for the first time in over a decade, scoring the winning goal against Deportivo de La Coruña. He ended his first season in Madrid with 23 goals and formed a potent partnership with Argentinian striker Sergio Agüero.

====2008–09 season====
On 9 May 2009, Forlán scored twice against Espanyol to help Atlético clinch Champions League qualification for a second successive year. &quot;Los Rojiblancos&quot; were trailing 2–0 at half-time and had seen Luis Perea sent off, but came back to win 3–2 thanks to a goal of the season contender from Forlán, as well as a last-minute winner. He also scored crucial goals in wins over Barcelona, Villarreal and Valencia. On 23 May 2009, Forlán scored a hat-trick against Athletic Bilbao, which helped him win the La Liga Pichichi Trophy, as well as the European Golden Boot for a second time. He ended the 2008–09 season with a very impressive 32 goals in 33 matches.

====2009–10 season====

Forlán started the 2009–10 season slowly, and struggled for form as Atlético made their worst start to a league season since their relegation in 2000. On 24 October 2009, Forlán scored a penalty and missed another as Atlético were held to a 1–1 draw at home against Mallorca, who had played the majority of the second half with just nine players on the field. The disappointing result and performance led to protests from Atlético supporters, as well as criticism for Forlán, who was subsequently left out of the squad for the next game. Atlético started to improve after the arrival new manager Quique Sánchez Flores, and once again, Forlán flourished in the second half of the season, as Atlético reached the finals of both the Europa League and Copa del Rey. On 14 February 2010, Forlán scored the first goal as Atlético beat Barcelona 2–1 at the Vicente Calderón, inflicting the eventual Champions only league defeat of the season. On 22 April 2010, Forlán scored the only goal of the game in Atlético&#x27;s Europa League semi-final first leg at home to Liverpool. A week later, Liverpool took the tie to extra time before taking a 2–1 aggregate lead. Forlán then scored again to make it 2–2 on aggregate, giving Atlético the away goal they needed to reach the final, in which they played against Fulham at Volksparkstadion, Hamburg, on 12 May. Forlán scored twice against Fulham in the final, in a 2–1 win and was awarded man of the match. He ended the season with a total of 28 goals, including six in Atlético&#x27;s successful Europa League campaign.

====2010–11 season====
The 2010–11 season began with another trophy for Forlán and Atlético, winning the UEFA Super Cup, beating Inter Milan 2–0 in Monaco on 27 August 2010. Again Forlán started the season slowly, and despite finding the net three times in the opening two league games, he then went 12 matches in all competitions without a goal before finally scoring a double in a 3–0 win against Osasuna on 13 November.

===Inter Milan===
On 29 August 2011, it was confirmed that Forlán had joined Inter Milan as a replacement for the departing Samuel Eto&#x27;o. No financial details were announced but it is believed the 32-year-old signed an initial two-year deal. He made his debut on 11 September 2011, scoring with a high left foot shot in a 4–3 defeat at Sicilian club Palermo. On 4 March 2012, Forlán scored his second goal for Inter against Catania in a 2–2 draw. In April, Forlán declared his loyalty to Inter and his intention to stay when he told Sky Sports: &quot;I want to stay at Inter. You haven&#x27;t seen the real Forlán yet... I wouldn&#x27;t want to leave Inter like this. I like challenges and I wouldn&#x27;t want to leave when the team are not in a good position.&quot; In June, his father confirmed the belief that the striker would see out his contract with the &quot;Nerazzurri&quot;. On 5 July, however, after only scoring twice in 22 appearances, the Italian club confirmed that he had been released, terminating the final year of his contract. Forlán has stated that his poor performance with the &quot;Nerazzuri&quot; was due to being played out of position. In addition, former Inter and Uruguay player Álvaro Recoba believed that his compatriot struggled at Inter due to the success of his predecessor Samuel Eto&#x27;o, which led Forlán to fail to live up to expectations.

===Internacional===

On 6 July 2012, after terminating his contract with Inter, Forlán signed a three-year deal with Brazilian club Internacional. He was also linked to Mexican teams Tigres UANL and Club América. In January 2013, Forlán was linked with another Mexican team, the recently promoted Club León. At León, Forlán had the chance to play the 2013 Copa Libertadores; Internacional, however, retained Forlán&#x27;s services for the 2013 season.

On 28 July 2012, he made his debut for the Brazilian club against Vasco da Gama. Forlán scored his first two goals for Internacional in a 4–1 win against Flamengo. Forlán also helped the club win 2013 Campeonato Gaúcho, scoring nine goals, the highest total at the tournament.

===Cerezo Osaka===
On 22 January 2014, Forlán signed an 18-month deal with Japanese J1 League side Cerezo Osaka. He made his AFC Champions League debut in a 1–1 draw with Pohang Steelers, and his J. League debut in a 1–0 loss against defending champions Sanfrecce Hiroshima. He scored his first goal for Cerezo in a 4–0 win over Buriram United in an AFC Champions League match. On 12 April, Forlán scored two goals in the Osaka derby against local club rivals Gamba Osaka. He scored a crucial goal against Shandong Luneng on 23 April to put his team through to the knockout stage of the AFC Champions League. Cerezo Osaka were knocked out in the first round by Guangzhou Evergrande, losing 5–1 at home in the first leg. In spite of the disappointing home defeat, they managed to secure a 1–0 away win after an own goal by Liao Lisheng. However, this was not enough to overcome the 5–2 aggregate lead.

Having been relegated in his first season to J2 League, he started off the new campaign with a goal against Tokyo Verdy drawing 1–1. Forlán scored his first hat-trick against Kyoto Sanga on 29 April 2015, his side winning 3–0.

===Peñarol===
On 10 July 2015, Forlán signed an 18-month contract with his boyhood club Peñarol. In his only season at the club, he scored eight goals in 31 appearances as Peñarol won the championship title. On 14 June 2016 at a press conference, Forlán said he would be leaving the club.

===Mumbai City===
In August 2016, Forlán signed a three-month deal with Indian Super League club Mumbai City. He scored a hat-trick against Kerala Blasters in their 5–0 win on 19 November.

Mumbai finished first in the league table and progressed to the semi-final of the playoffs where they would face ATK. After conceding an early goal, Mumbai equalised and soon took the lead from the headers of Leo Costa and Gerson Vieira. In both cases the free kicks were taken by Forlán. Forlán received a red card in the second half as ATK won the match 3–2.

===Kitchee===

On 4 January 2018, Forlán joined Hong Kong Premier League club Kitchee. He made his debut for Kitchee on 14 January 2018, coming off the bench in the 88th minute in a 2–2 draw against Southern. On 28 January, Forlán scored his first and second goals for Kitchee in a 7–0 victory over Biu Chun Rangers. He scored a hat-trick in a 5–1 win against Lee Man in the following match. Forlán played in Kitchee&#x27;s 1–0 victory over Kashiwa Reysol in the 2018 AFC Champions League, helping Kitchee to become the first-ever team from Hong Kong to win a match in AFC Champions League history. On 13 May 2018, Forlán played his final match with the club, featuring in the first 56 minutes of a 2–0 victory, and went on to win the Hong Kong Premier League that season.

===Retirement===
A year after leaving Kitchee, Forlán announced his retirement from professional football on 7 August 2019.

==International career==

Forlán&#x27;s 100th cap came in the 2013 FIFA Confederations Cup match against Nigeria. On 11 October 2011, he scored his 32nd goal, which made him Uruguay&#x27;s top scorer of all time in official matches, beating Héctor Scarone who had held the record alone with 31 goals since 1930. (Scarone scored 42 goals in total, but 11 of them were in unofficial matches).

===2002 FIFA World Cup, 2004 Copa América, and 2007 Copa América===
Forlán debuted for the Uruguayan senior squad on 27 March 2002, scoring his first goal in a 3–2 friendly defeat against Saudi Arabia. During the 2002 World Cup, he scored a volley on 11 June in the group stage 3–3 draw against Senegal. Despite coming from three goals down to draw the game, Uruguay were eliminated from the tournament along with France in Group A. Forlán scored against Brazil in the 35th minute of the 2007 Copa América semi-final, but missed his shot during the subsequent penalty shoot-out, which Brazil eventually won 5–4.

===2010 FIFA World Cup===
On 17 June 2008, Forlán scored a hat-trick in a World Cup qualifying game against Peru.

On 16 June 2010, during Uruguay&#x27;s second group game in the 2010 World Cup against South Africa, Forlán opened the scoring with a right footed long range effort. Later in the game, Forlán scored from the penalty spot, shooting high into the net for his second and also had a hand in Uruguay&#x27;s third, in a 3–0 win over the host nation. On 2 July 2010, Forlán scored a free kick against Ghana to equalise in the quarter-final. The game ended 1–1 and Uruguay advanced to the semi-finals after defeating Ghana 4–2 in the penalty shootout. On 6 July 2010, Forlán scored another long range goal, this time with his left foot to equalise against the Netherlands in the semi-final. Despite a half-time score of 1–1, Uruguay eventually lost 3–2 as the Dutch advanced to the final. Forlán became the first player since Lothar Matthäus in 1990 to score three goals from outside the penalty area in one tournament. On 10 July 2010, Forlán scored for the final time in the tournament as he netted a well-executed volley from the edge of the area to give Uruguay the lead. This goal, from a pass by Egidio Arévalo Ríos, was selected by FIFA as the Goal of the Tournament. Forlán then hit the crossbar with the final kick of the game from a free kick as they lost to Germany 3–2 in the third place play-off. Forlán was awarded the Golden Ball as the tournament&#x27;s best player. He was also picked for the team of the tournament, and was the joint top scorer at the World Cup with five goals.

===2011 Copa América===

On 24 July 2011, Forlán scored twice after Luis Suárez&#x27;s opening goal helping Uruguay win their 15th Copa América title and became Uruguay&#x27;s joint top scorer at international level, his 31 goals matching those of Héctor Scarone after beating Paraguay 3–0 in the final. Forlán&#x27;s father and grandfather were also South American champions with Uruguay over a period spanning the 95 years of the world&#x27;s oldest active tournament.

===2013 FIFA Confederations Cup===

On 16 June 2013, Forlán appeared as a 69th-minute substitute in Uruguay&#x27;s opening 2013 Confederations Cup match against Spain. In Uruguay&#x27;s second group game, a match where he won his 100th cap for his country, Forlán scored the winning goal to defeat Nigeria 2–1. He was subsequently rested for the next match against Tahiti. He was again in the starting line-up as Uruguay lost 1–2 to Brazil in the semi-final, where he had a penalty kick saved by Brazilian goalkeeper Júlio César.

===2014 FIFA World Cup===
Forlán was a part of the Uruguay squad for the 2014 World Cup in Brazil. At the age of 35, he started the opening match against group underdogs Costa Rica in place of the absent Luis Suárez. He had a deflected shot saved by Costa Rican goalkeeper Keylor Navas as Uruguay lost the game 3–1. Forlán did not appear again until the Round of 16, where Uruguay were beaten 2–0 by Colombia.

===Retirement===
On 11 March 2015, Forlán announced his retirement from the national team. He represented Uruguay with 112 caps, scoring 36 times.

==Style of play==
A talented, technically gifted, hardworking and creative player, with an eye for goal, Forlán was a quick, clever, complete and versatile forward, with a good positional sense, who was capable of playing anywhere along the front line. He was deployed as a main striker (his favoured position), as a supporting forward, as an attacking midfielder, and even as a winger, often drifting onto the flank to begin attacking plays. He was capable of scoring with either foot, both from inside and outside the area; in fact, Forlán was most known for his powerful and accurate long range shots, which made him a large threat if given space outside the box. Alongside this, Forlán was also an accurate set-piece and penalty kick taker. In addition to his accurate finishing, movement, and goalscoring ability, Forlán was a skilful player, gifted with good technical ability and ball control, as well as good vision, passing ability, intelligence, and awareness on the ball; these attributes also enabled him to be deployed in a more creative role, in which he could play-off of other players and drop into deeper positions to link-up the midfield with the attack, making him a capable assist provider. In addition to his footballing skills, Forlán was also praised for his leadership, longevity and determination throughout his career.

==Coaching career==
On 20 December 2019, Forlán was appointed as manager of his former club Peñarol. He was sacked on 1 September 2020, after winning just four of his eleven games in charge. On 17 March 2021, he was appointed as manager of Atenas of the Uruguayan Segunda División. On 16 September 2021, after a 2–1 loss to Rampla Juniors, he was released.

==Tennis career, first professional ATP tournament==
Diego Forlán was a promising junior tennis player and has continued to play after his retirement from professional football in 2019. Since July 2023, he has been competing on the ITF Masters professional tennis tour, and is a ranked player in the 35+, 40+, and 45+ age categories. In June 2024, Forlán attracted media coverage after reaching the quarterfinals of the ITF MT1000 Lima 45+ tournament in Peru, winning three matches in straight sets. 

At the age of 45, he was scheduled to play his first professional ATP tournament. He received a wildcard for the main doubles draw of the 2024 Uruguay Open in Montevideo, where his partner was Argentine Federico Coria. The pair was defeated in the first round of the tournament by the No. 4 seeds from Bolivia, Boris Arias and Federico Zeballos.

==Personal life==
Forlán was born into a family of footballers – his father, Pablo, having played for Peñarol (1963–1970), São Paulo (1970–1975) and Uruguay in the 1966 and 1974 World Cups, and his maternal grandfather, Juan Carlos Corazzo, for Independiente in Argentina. Forlán is of Italian, Basque, and Irish descent, and because of his Basque ancestry from his grandmother who was originally from San Sebastián, he was linked to Athletic Bilbao after his departure from Manchester United, even though the club only permits Basque players. His nickname is &quot;Cachavacha,&quot; a witch who is one of the antagonists from the Argentine cartoon series &quot;The Adventures of Hijitus&quot;. In addition to his native Spanish, Forlán also speaks English. Diego writes with his right hand but plays tennis with his left hand.

He is a founding member of Fundación Alejandra Forlán, an organization headed by his sister that promotes safer driving.

In 2009, Forlán appeared in a music video for Coti starring alongside Argentine footballer Maxi Rodríguez. In 2021, Forlán began playing amateur football for the Old Boys Club, the alumni team of The British Schools of Montevideo.

===Relationships===
Forlán announced on 9 March 2011 on his official Twitter page that he and Argentinian model/actress Zaira Nara were engaged to be married. In June 2011, however, Forlán and Nara announced they were breaking their engagement. No reason was released for the breakup. During 2011 and 2012 he dated model Victoria Saravia.

Forlán is married to Paz Cardoso and together the pair have three sons and a daughter.

<text>Josef František (7 October 1914 – 8 October 1940) was a Czechoslovak fighter pilot and Second World War fighter ace who flew for the air forces of Czechoslovakia, Poland, France, and the United Kingdom. He was the highest-scoring non-British Allied ace in the Battle of Britain, with 17 confirmed victories and one probable, all gained in a period of four weeks in September 1940.

František was a brilliant pilot and combatant but frequently breached air force discipline first in Czechoslovakia, in France and Britain. The RAF found it best to let him patrol alone, a role in which he was highly successful. He was killed in a crash in October 1940 in the final week of the Battle of Britain.

== Life in Czechoslovakia ==
Josef František was born in 1914 in Otaslavice in Moravia, Austria-Hungary (now the Czech Republic), the son of a carpenter. After leaving school, he was apprenticed to a locksmith, but in 1934 he joined the Czechoslovak Air Force. He was trained at the Air Training School at Prostějov. In 1935, he was a corporal in the 1st Air Regiment. In 1936, he completed training and was posted to the 2nd Air Regiment at Olomouc in Moravia, where he flew Aero A.11 and Letov Š-328 reconnaissance biplanes. By 1937, he was a sergeant.

František got into trouble for fighting, returning late to his unit, and other breaches of discipline. He could have been dishonourably discharged, but he showed exceptional promise as a pilot, so he was sent to the 4th Air Regiment to train as a fighter pilot. In June 1938, he became a fighter pilot with the 40th Fighter Flight at Prague-Kbely flying Avia B-534 and Bk-534 biplane fighters. Here he developed his flying and combat skills.

On 30 September 1938, France and the United Kingdom allowed Germany to annex the Sudetenland, and on 15 March 1939 Germany occupied the remainder of Bohemia and Moravia. It imposed a Protectorate of Bohemia and Moravia with a puppet government that it ordered to disband its armed forces.

==Polish Air Force==
Many Czechoslovak airmen covertly escaped over the border to Poland. František was one of a group of four that was smuggled across the border by train at Šumbark on 13 June. The group reported to the Czechoslovak Consulate in Kraków and was accommodated in a Czechoslovak transit camp at Bronowice Małe that had been converted from a disused Austro-Hungarian Army camp.

Initially, Poles showed no interest in Czechoslovak pilots. In July 1939, a party of Czechoslovak airmen including František and another future RAF ace, Karel Kuttelwascher, went to the Port of Gdynia to sail to France. On 29 July, they were about to embark on a Swedish cargo steamship, the &quot;Kastelholm.&quot; Meanwhile, by now, the Poles were already sure that the German invasion was inevitable. While Czechoslovak pilots were preparing for departure, they received an offer to join the Polish Air Force, to which some agreed. František was in a group of friends that tossed a coin to decide. It landed &quot;tails&quot;, so they stayed in Poland. In total, eight Slovaks and thirteen Czechs joined the Polish Air Force.

František and his group retrained on Polish aircraft at Dęblin airbase in Małopolska. František was made an instructor, flying obsolescent Potez 25, Breguet 19, PWS-26, RWD 8, RWD-14 Czapla and Lublin R-XIII aircraft.

On 1 September 1939 Germany invaded Poland, and on the morning of 2 September a &quot;Luftwaffe&quot; air raid destroyed Dęblin airbase. František&#x27;s unit evacuated its surviving aircraft to Góra Puławska, further to the southeast. On one patrol from Góra Puławska a fellow Czechoslovak pilot, Zdeněk Škavarda, was flying a Breguet 19 when he ran out of fuel, made a forced landing near German lines and was at risk of capture. František landed nearby and rescued him.

František&#x27;s unit retreated again, to Sosnowice Wielke airfield near Parczew. From 7 September he flew reconnaissance missions in unarmed 2-person RWD 8 and PWS-25 training aircraft, carrying an observer. On 19–20 September he attacked enemy columns near Kamionka Strumiłowa, throwing hand grenades at German troops below. On 20 September his aircraft was damaged by enemy fire from the ground so he made a forced landing near Złoczów. Two other pilots, one of whom was another Czechoslovak, landed and rescued František and his Polish observer.

For his Polish service František was awarded the Virtuti Militari 5th class and received the Cross of Valour four times.

On 22 September, František&#x27;s unit was ordered to withdraw with its remaining aircraft to Romania. The unit flew first to Ispas in Bukovina, and then via various airfields eventually to Pipera near Bucharest, where it was interned by the Romanian authorities. But many interned members of the Polish Air Force escaped. They included a group of four Czechoslovak airmen nicknamed the &quot;Czech Cloverleaf&quot;: František, Josef Balejka, Vilém Košař (one of the pilots who had landed to rescue František after his forced landing in Poland) and Matěj Pavlovič. The four went to Constanța, whence a Romanian cargo steamship, the &quot;Dacia&quot;, took them to Beirut in French-ruled Lebanon.

==France==
In Beirut, a week later, the four embarked on a Messageries Maritimes cargo ship, the &quot;Theophile Gautier&quot;, which landed them at Marseille on 20 October 1939. There a Polish sergeant recognised their Polish war decorations and helped to get them to join the new Free Polish Air Force at le Bourget.

Once in France, escaped Czechoslovak airmen were being retrained to fly l&#x27;Armée d&#x27;Air equipment. Košař was a naturalised Polish citizen but with Balejka, František and Pavlovič went to see the Czechoslovak Air Attaché to ask to be transferred to join fellow Czechoslovaks in l&#x27;Armée d&#x27;Air. The attaché accused them of deserting the Polish Air Force, so František accused the Czechoslovak Air Force of failing to evacuate its aircraft to Poland when Germany invaded in March 1939, whereupon the attaché called the French police. The police found the trio&#x27;s Polish military identity documents to be in order and refused to arrest them. Balejka, František and Pavlovič remained with their Free Polish units.

František was posted to a Polish airbase at Clermont-Ferrand where he served as a mechanic. He tried to learn to fly as many types of French aircraft as he could. He also got into trouble several times for going absent without leave. There are no official French records to confirm he flew combat missions during the Battle of France, though some older sources credit him with 11 victories: nine in the air and two on the ground. In his home town of Otaslavice there is a museum in his memory and its collection of his medals includes a Croix de Guerre. His French Air Force records are known to have been destroyed, so there is no official confirmation of whether or why the cross was awarded to him.

==Royal Air Force==
After France surrendered, František fled to Britain and after training on 2 August was assigned to Polish No. 303 Squadron based at RAF Northolt, flying Hawker Hurricane fighters. František was used to obsolescent aircraft with fixed landing gear, and on 8 August at the end of a training flight, he forgot to lower his Hurricane&#x27;s retractable undercarriage and accidentally made a belly landing. He was unhurt, and the aircraft was repairable. The squadron entered action in the last phase of the Battle of Britain. František&#x27;s first confirmed victory was shooting down a Messerschmitt Bf 109E fighter on 2 September 1940. His fifth victory nearly cost him his life. On 6 September he shot down a Bf 109E of III/JG 52 near Sevenoaks in Kent, but František&#x27;s Hurricane was damaged so badly that he had to make a forced landing near Falmer.

An unruly pilot, he was seen by his commanding officers as a danger to his colleagues when flying in formation. His British CO, Squadron Leader Ronald Kellett, offered to get František transferred to a Czech squadron. František, perhaps due to his clash with the Czechoslovak air attaché in Paris, chose to stay with his Polish colleagues. As all pilots were valuable, a compromise was reached whereby František was allotted a &quot;spare&quot; aircraft so he could fly as a &quot;guest&quot; of the squadron as and when he wanted. Thus František fought his own private war – accompanying the squadron into the air and peeling off to fly a lone patrol over Kent, patrolling in the area through which he knew the German aircraft being intercepted would fly on their way back to base, possibly damaged and low on fuel and ammunition.

Between 2 and 30 September he shot down 17 German aircraft and 1 probable, including nine Bf 109 fighters, six Heinkel He 111 bombers and one Junkers Ju 88 bomber. This made him one of the top scoring Allied fighter pilots of the Battle of Britain and on 20 September, King George VI decorated him with the Distinguished Flying Medal. A bar was later added to his DFM. His final confirmed victory was a Bf 109 near Brooklands in Surrey on 30 September 1940. 

On 8 October 1940, František&#x27;s Hurricane crashed in Ewell, Surrey, on return from a patrol. The cause is not known. It has been suggested that it might have been a result of battle fatigue and physical exhaustion. František is buried in the military section of Northwood cemetery in Middlesex, with a Polish headstone and alongside Polish and British RAF colleagues.

==Legacy==
František was the first non-British pilot to have a bar added to his Distinguished Flying Medal when he posthumously received one on 28 October 1940. In 1942, Air Vice-Marshal Karel Janoušek called František an &quot;almost legendary figure&quot;. Janoušek also quoted the anonymous author of the 1941 book &quot;Together we Fly, A Salute to Airmen&quot;, who called František &quot;the greatest of all Czechoslovak pilots, perhaps one of the greatest fighters of all time&quot;. In Otaslavice there is a museum in František&#x27;s memory, a monument outside the František family home, and a plaque outside the local primary school. A street in the Černý Most suburb of Prague is named &quot;Františkova&quot; after him. The centenary of his birth was commemorated in Otaslavice on 4 October 2014. On 6 October 2015 the Polish Institute in Prague commemorated the 75th anniversary of František&#x27;s death. Wreaths and floral tributes continue to be laid on his birthday each year at the monument outside the family home in Otaslavice. On 4 September 2022 a memorial was unveiled on Priest Hill in Ewell, England, not far from the place he died.

Posthumously the president of Czech Republic, Miloš Zeman awarded him the Order of the White Lion 1st Class Military Division on 28 Oct. 2015. In 2017, the Czech Mint issued silver and gold commemorative coins (under the authority of Niue) paying tribute to Josef František.

==In popular culture==
Josef František was portrayed by Kryštof Hádek in the 2018 film &quot;Hurricane: 303 Squadron&quot;. He was also referenced by Polish rock band Elektryczne Gitary in the song &quot;Pilot Josef František&quot;, as a part of their 2016 album &quot;Czasowniki&quot;.

<text>In the differential geometry of curves, the evolute of a curve is the locus of all its centers of curvature. That is to say that when the center of curvature of each point on a curve is drawn, the resultant shape will be the evolute of that curve. The evolute of a circle is therefore a single point at its center. Equivalently, an evolute is the envelope of the normals to a curve.

The evolute of a curve, a surface, or more generally a submanifold, is the caustic of the normal map. Let be a smooth, regular submanifold in . For each point in and each vector , based at and normal to , we associate the point . This defines a Lagrangian map, called the normal map. The caustic of the normal map is the evolute of .

Evolutes are closely connected to involutes: A curve is the evolute of any of its involutes.

== History ==
Apollonius ( 200 BC) discussed evolutes in Book V of his &quot;Conics&quot;. However, Huygens is sometimes credited with being the first to study them (1673). Huygens formulated his theory of evolutes sometime around 1659 to help solve the problem of finding the tautochrone curve, which in turn helped him construct an isochronous pendulum. This was because the tautochrone curve is a cycloid, and the cycloid has the unique property that its evolute is also a cycloid. The theory of evolutes, in fact, allowed Huygens to achieve many results that would later be found using calculus.

== Evolute of a parametric curve ==
If formula_1 is the parametric representation of a regular curve in the plane with its curvature nowhere 0 and formula_2 its curvature radius and formula_3 the unit normal pointing to the curvature center, then
formula_4
describes the evolute of the given curve.

For formula_5 and formula_6 one gets
formula_7 and
formula_8

== Properties of the evolute ==

In order to derive properties of a regular curve it is advantageous to use the arc length formula_9 of the given curve as its parameter, because of formula_10 and formula_11 (see Frenet–Serret formulas). Hence the tangent vector of the evolute formula_12 is:
formula_13
From this equation one gets the following properties of the evolute:
*At points with formula_14 the evolute is &quot;not regular&quot;. That means: at points with maximal or minimal curvature (vertices of the given curve) the evolute has &quot;cusps&quot;. (See the diagrams of the evolutes of the parabola, the ellipse, the cycloid and the nephroid.)
*For any arc of the evolute that does not include a cusp, the length of the arc equals the difference between the radii of curvature at its endpoints. This fact leads to an easy proof of the Tait–Kneser theorem on nesting of osculating circles.
*The normals of the given curve at points of nonzero curvature are tangents to the evolute, and the normals of the curve at points of zero curvature are asymptotes to the evolute. Hence: the evolute is the &quot;envelope of the normals&quot; of the given curve. 
*At sections of the curve with formula_15 or formula_16 the curve is an &quot;involute&quot; of its evolute. (In the diagram: The blue parabola is an involute of the red semicubic parabola, which is actually the evolute of the blue parabola.)

&quot;Proof&quot; of the last property:
Let be formula_15 at the section of consideration. An involute of the evolute can be described as follows:
formula_18
where formula_19 is a fixed string extension (see Involute of a parameterized curve ).
With formula_20 and formula_21 one gets 
formula_22
That means: For the string extension formula_23 the given curve is reproduced.

* &quot;Parallel curves&quot; have the same evolute.

&quot;Proof:&quot; A parallel curve with distance formula_24 off the given curve has the parametric representation formula_25 and the radius of curvature formula_26 (see parallel curve). Hence the evolute of the parallel curve is formula_27

== Examples ==
=== Evolute of a parabola ===
For the parabola with the parametric representation formula_28 one gets from the formulae above the equations:
formula_29
formula_30
which describes a semicubic parabola

=== Evolute of an ellipse ===
For the ellipse with the parametric representation formula_31 one gets:
formula_32
formula_33
These are the equations of a non symmetric astroid. 
Eliminating parameter formula_34 leads to the implicit representation
formula_35

=== Evolute of a cycloid===
For the cycloid with the parametric representation formula_36 the evolute will be:
formula_37
formula_38
which describes a transposed replica of itself.
=== Evolute of log-aesthetic curves ===
The evolute of a log-aesthetic curve is another log-aesthetic curve. One instance of this relation is that the evolute of an Euler spiral is a spiral with Cesàro equation formula_39.

== Evolutes of some curves ==
The evolute 
* of a parabola is a semicubic parabola (see above), 
* of an ellipse is a non symmetric astroid (see above),
* of a line is an ideal point,
* of a nephroid is a nephroid (half as large, see diagram),
* of an astroid is an astroid (twice as large),
* of a cardioid is a cardioid (one third as large),
* of a circle is its center,
* of a deltoid is a deltoid (three times as large),
* of a cycloid is a congruent cycloid,
* of a logarithmic spiral is the same logarithmic spiral,
* of a tractrix is a catenary.

== Radial curve ==
A curve with a similar definition is the radial of a given curve. For each point on the curve take the vector from the point to the center of curvature and translate it so that it begins at the origin. Then the locus of points at the end of such vectors is called the radial of the curve. The equation for the radial is obtained by removing the and terms from the equation of the evolute. This produces
formula_40

<doc id="842388" wikidata="Q422604" url="?curid=842388" title="Emtricitabine">
<text>Emtricitabine (commonly called FTC, systematic name 2&#x27;,3&#x27;-dideoxy-5-fluoro-3&#x27;-thiacytidine), with trade name Emtriva (formerly Coviracil), is a nucleoside reverse-transcriptase inhibitor (NRTI) for the prevention and treatment of HIV infection in adults and children. In 2019, it was the 494th most commonly prescribed medication in the United States, with more than 3thousand prescriptions.

Emtricitabine makes up one fourth of the Quad pill (brand names: Stribild and Genvoya). It is also marketed in a fixed-dose combination with tenofovir disoproxil (Viread) under the brand name Truvada, and with tenofovir alafenamide (Vemlidy) under the brand name Descovy. In fixed-dose combinations with tenofovir or with efavirenz and tenofovir it is on the World Health Organization&#x27;s List of Essential Medicines. A fixed-dose triple combination of emtricitabine, tenofovir and efavirenz (Sustiva, marketed by Bristol-Myers Squibb) was approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) on July 12, 2006, under the brand name Atripla. 

==Medical uses==

===HIV infection===
Emtricitabine is indicated in combination with other antiretroviral agents for the prevention and treatment of HIV-1 infection.

===HBV infection===
Emtricitabine exhibits clinical activity against the hepatitis B virus (HBV), but is not approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for the treatment of HBV infection. Among individuals with chronic HBV infection, emtricitabine treatment results in significant histologic, virologic, and biochemical improvement. The safety profile of emtricitabine during treatment is similar to that of a placebo. Emtricitabine, like all other FDA approved drugs, cures neither HIV nor HBV infection. In a study involving individuals with HBV infection, symptoms of infection returned in 23% of emtricitabine-treated individuals who were taken off therapy. In studies involving individuals with &quot;chronic&quot; HIV infection, viral replication also resumes when study subjects are taken off therapy. As with drugs used to treat HIV infection, drugs used to treat HBV infection may have to be used in combination to prevent the evolution of drug resistant strains. The effectiveness of emtricitabine in combination with other anti-HBV drugs has not been established.

==Side effects==

In clinical practice, toxicity with emtricitabine is unusual. The most common treatment-related adverse events are diarrhea, headache, nausea, and rash. These symptoms are generally mild to moderate in severity, but they caused 1% of clinical trial patients to give up treatment. Skin discoloration, which is typically reported as hyperpigmentation and usually affects either the palms of the hands or the soles of the feet, is reported in less than 2% of individuals and is almost exclusive to patients of African origin.

Among the more severe side effects patients may experience are a hepatotoxicity or a lactic acidosis.

==Mechanism of action==

Emtricitabine is an analogue of cytidine. The drug works by inhibiting reverse transcriptase, the enzyme that copies HIV RNA into new viral DNA. By interfering with this process, which is central to the replication of HIV, emtricitabine can help to lower the amount of HIV, or &quot;viral load&quot;, in a patient&#x27;s body and can indirectly increase the number of immune system cells (namely T cells/CD4+ T-cells). Both of these changes are associated with healthier immune systems and decreased likelihood of serious illness.

==History==
Emtricitabine was discovered by Dennis C. Liotta, Raymond F. Schinazi, and Woo-Baeg Choi of Emory University and licensed to Triangle Pharmaceuticals by Emory in 1996 in a collaboration with Dr. Yung-Chi Cheng at Yale University. Triangle Pharmaceuticals was acquired in 2003 by Gilead Sciences, which completed development and now markets the product with the brand name Emtriva.

It was approved by the FDA July 2, 2003. It is very similar to lamivudine (3TC) and cross-resistance between the two is near-universal.

<doc id="842394" wikidata="Q3299525" url="?curid=842394" title="Susan Cullen-Ward">
<text>Susan, Crown Princess of Albania (&quot;née&quot; Susan Barbara Cullen-Ward, formerly Williams; 28 January 1941 – 17 July 2004) was the Australian-born wife of Leka, Crown Prince of Albania.

Her husband, known as King Leka, had been proclaimed King of the Albanians by the anti-communist Albanian government-in-exile in 1961, upon the death of his father King Zog. Meanwhile, Albania itself was a communist republic.

==Early life==
Susan Cullen-Ward was born in the Sydney suburb of Waverley. Her mother was Phyllis Dorothea Murray-Prior and her father was Alan Robert Cullen-Ward, a pastoralist. Susan Cullen-Ward was a great-granddaughter of the Queensland politician Thomas Lodge Murray-Prior (1819–1892).

Cullen-Ward grew up on her father&#x27;s sheep station. She attended Presbyterian Ladies&#x27; College at Orange, then studied at Sydney Technical College before teaching art at a private studio.

She was married to Richard Williams from 1965 to 1970. Susan Cullen-Ward was an Anglican.

==Marriage to the Crown Prince of Albania==
Susan Cullen-Ward met Leka, Crown Prince of Albania, the only child of King Zog I of the Albanians, at a dinner party in Sydney. In October 1975, they married in a civil ceremony in Biarritz, France. The couple were later married in a religious ceremony in Madrid.

Australian authorities refused to recognise her as a queen but, in a compromise when Andrew Peacock was foreign minister, issued a passport in the name of &quot;Susan Cullen-Ward, known as Queen Susan&quot;.

She lived a turbulent life after marrying Leka, as they moved from one country to another, having no permanent residence or fixed point of reference. In the first few years of their marriage, the couple lived in Spain. They later settled in Rhodesia (now known as Zimbabwe). After a falling out with the government of Robert Mugabe, the couple moved again, this time to South Africa where their son, Leka, was born in 1982. She also had a stillborn daughter while resident in Rhodesia.

==Death==
The Crown Princess of Albania died of lung cancer on 17 July 2004 in Tirana, Albania. After her death, she lay in state in a chapel outside Tirana. 

She is buried at the Mausoleum of the Albanian Royal Family, next to her mother-in-law, Queen Geraldine, her husband, Crown Prince Leka, and his father, whose body was reburied in 2012.

<doc id="842403" wikidata="Q2636624" url="?curid=842403" title="Alan Barlow">
<text>Sir James Alan Noel Barlow, 2nd Baronet (25 December 1881 – 28 February 1968) was a British civil servant and collector of Islamic and Chinese art. He was Principal Private Secretary to Ramsay MacDonald, 1933–1934, and later Under-secretary at HM Treasury.

==Personal life and education== 

Barlow was born in London, the eldest son of Sir Thomas Barlow, 1st Baronet, Royal physician, and his wife Ada Dalmahoy. He attended Marlborough College and Corpus Christi College, Oxford, graduating with a first class degree in &quot;literae humaniores&quot; in 1904. 

In 1911 Barlow and Nora Darwin, the daughter of Horace Darwin and grand-daughter of Charles Darwin (see Darwin — Wedgwood family) were married. They had six children:

* Joan Helen Barlow (26 May 1912 – 21 February 1954).
* Sir Thomas Erasmus Barlow, 3rd Baronet (23 January 1914 – 12 October 2003), naval officer.
* Erasmus Darwin Barlow (15 April 1915 – 2 August 2005).
* Andrew Dalmahoy Barlow (16 September 1916 – 2006), son: Martin T. Barlow, mathematician.
* Hilda Horatia Barlow (14 September 1919 – 1 February 2017) husband: John Hunter Padel, psychoanalyst; daughter: Ruth Padel, poet.
* Horace Basil Barlow (8 December 1921 – 5 July 2020).

He was a member of the Savile and Athenaeum clubs in London where he was able to meet political contacts during his career. He started collecting Islamic pottery and Chinese ceramics as a child and later donated pieces to museums and the University of Sussex. He was also a bibliophile and interested in archaeology. From 1948 until 1955 he was a trustee of the National Gallery, and its chair from 1949 – 1951. He was also a president of the Oriental Ceramic Society from 1943 – 1964.

==Career==
He began a career as a civil servant as a clerk in the House of Commons in 1906. He was then chosen as a junior examiner in the Board of Education and in 1914 became private secretary to the parliamentary secretary. The First World War altered the direction of his career since in 1915 he was moved to the Ministry of Munitions to be private secretary to Christopher Addison, who became the Minister. In 1917 he was promoted to be deputy controller of labour supply and in 1918 became controller of the labour department. When the war ended he was in charge of demobilization and training in the new Ministry of Labour. In 1924 he was promoted to principal assistant secretary in charge of the industrial relations department of the Ministry. His role focused on training after 1929 and the establishment of government training centres, although there remained a lack of training by industry. 

In 1933 he was appointed as the principal private secretary to Ramsay MacDonald, the prime minister. However, the two men were not suited to each other and in 1934 Barlow was transferred to the Treasury where he remained, rising to a senior position and being a member of several committees that together were concerned with the machinery of government. It has been considered that he made creative changes that improved the civil service. However he did not lead on changes needed as the government intervened more in economic and social policy from the late 1940s onwards. He was in favour of education expenditure, especially in technical and scientific areas. He chaired a committee in 1945 - 1946 that recommended foundation of a new technological university and increasing the number of science graduates, but it was not implemented. He retired in 1948 but continued to be a member of the Advisory Council on Scientific Policy. 

Barlow was a knight three times over; a baronet and a knight of both the Order of the Bath and the Order of the British Empire:
*1918 New Year Honours awarded CBE
*1928 New Year Honours awarded CB
*The King&#x27;s Birthday Honours 1938 awarded KBE
*The King&#x27;s Birthday Honours 1942 awarded KCB
*1947 New Year Honours awarded GCB

<text>Sir Thomas Barlow, 1st Baronet, (4 November 1845 – 12 January 1945) was a British royal physician, known for his research on infantile scurvy.

==Early life==
Barlow was the son of a Lancashire cotton manufacturer and Mayor of Bolton, James Barlow (1821–1887). The family were well known as philanthropists in their home village of Edgworth, Lancashire where they funded charities connected with the Methodist church including the Children&#x27;s Home.

He studied as an undergraduate at Manchester and London. University College London (UCL) Bachelor of Medicine (BM) in 1873 and Doctor of Medicine (MD) 1874.

==Career==
He became a registrar at Great Ormond Street Hospital, and later a physician and in 1899 a consultant. He was professor at the UCL from 1895 to 1907, initially of paediatrics and later of clinical medicine.

In 1883, he showed that infantile scurvy was identical with adult scurvy. &quot;Barlow&#x27;s disease&quot; – infantile scurvy – is named after him.

He was Royal Physician to Queen Victoria and attended her on her death, and to Edward VII and King George V.
He was knighted as a Knight Commander of the Royal Victorian Order in March 1901, and in February 1902 he was created a Baronet, of Wimpole Street in St Marylebone in the County of London. He was President of the Royal College of Physicians from 1910–1914 and delivered their Harveian Oration in 1916 on the subject of &quot;Harvey, The Man and the Physician&quot;. He was elected a Foreign Honorary Member of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences in 1918.

Barlow received the honorary degree Doctor of Science (D.Sc.) from the Victoria University of Manchester in February 1902, in connection with the 50th jubilee celebrations of the establishment of the university. In 1904, he was listed honorary medical staff at King Edward VII&#x27;s Hospital for Officers.

==Marriage and children==
Barlow married Ada Helen Dalmahoy, daughter of Patrick Dalmahoy WS, on 28 December 1880. They had the following children:

* Sir James Alan Noel Barlow, 2nd Bt. (1881–1968), who married Emma Nora Darwin, the granddaughter of Charles Darwin (see Darwin — Wedgwood family).

* Patrick Basil Barlow (23 October 1884 – 18 January 1917), killed in the First World War
* Helen Alice Dorothy Barlow (4 May 1887 – 16 September 1975), died unmarried - see &quot;Re Barlow&#x27;s Will Trusts&quot;. With her father, she was a member of the London Survey Committee, a voluntary organisation publishing architectural surveys of the capital.
* Gertrude Mary Barlow (August 1888 – 22 July 1889), died in infancy

<doc id="842410" wikidata="Q1384005" url="?curid=842410" title="Todd Hamilton">
<text>William Todd Hamilton (born October 18, 1965) is an American professional golfer. He is best known for his victory at the 2004 Open Championship.

==Early life==
Hamilton was born in the small west-central Illinois city of Galesburg. He grew up in an even smaller town, Oquawka, in Henderson County on the Mississippi River. His parents were the owners of a small grocery story called &quot;Hamilton&#x27;s.&quot; He attended Union High School in Biggsville, Illinois (now West Central High School). At the time, the high school did not have a golf team, and Hamilton competed as an individual. He won back to back Class A state titles in 1981–82 and 1982–83. Hamilton then played at the University of Oklahoma, where he was a college All-American.

==Professional career==
Hamilton turned professional in 1987 but was unable to gain entrance to the PGA Tour. Instead he played internationally for many years, primarily on the Japan Golf Tour after gaining his card as winner of the 1992 Asia Golf Circuit Order of Merit winner. When he left the Japan Golf Tour after 12 seasons, he was the tour&#x27;s 2nd all-time leading non-Japanese money winner (to USA&#x27;s David Ishii), with earnings of over 630 million yen (about $6.18 million in 2014 US dollars) with 11 tour wins.

After eight tries, at the age of 38, Hamilton went back to Qualifying School in 2003, where he finally earned his first PGA Tour card.

Hamilton captured his first PGA Tour win at the 2004 Honda Classic. He birdied the final two holes to beat Davis Love III by one stroke at 12 under par. Later that year, Hamilton won a major championship in one of golf&#x27;s all-time upsets when he defeated Ernie Els in a four-hole playoff to win The Open Championship at Royal Troon Golf Club. After shooting an opening round 71, Hamilton fired a second round 67 to move to -4 and a fifth-place tie with future World Golf Hall of Famers Els, Vijay Singh and Colin Montgomerie as well as Michael Campbell. Hamilton again shot a 67 in the third round to take a one-shot lead over Els. Entering the tournament&#x27;s 72nd hole, Hamilton held a one-shot lead over Els, but Hamilton bogeyed the 18th hole, leaving Els with a 12-foot birdie putt for the win, which he missed. Els and Hamilton headed for the four-hole aggregate playoff, in which Hamilton carded four pars while Els managed three pars and a bogey, and Hamilton took the win.

These two victories in his first season on the PGA Tour led to Hamilton being named the 2004 PGA Tour Rookie of the Year and reaching a peak world ranking of 16. In his 187 subsequent tour starts, he missed the cut 111 times and had just three top-10 finishes. In 2006, Hamilton captained the American team in ITV&#x27;s celebrity golf tournament, the All*Star Cup.

He lost his full exempt status on the PGA Tour in 2010. Hamilton played on the Web.com Tour in 2014 and 2015. Hamilton became eligible to play on the Champions Tour after turning fifty years of age in October 2015.

==Personal life==
Hamilton lives in Westlake, Texas.

<text>Ante Trumbić (17 May 1864 – 17 November 1938) was a Yugoslav and Croatian lawyer and politician in the early 20th century.

==Biography==
Trumbić was born in Split in the Austrian crownland of Dalmatia and studied law at Zagreb, Vienna and Graz (with doctorate in 1890). He practiced as a lawyer, and then, from 1905 as the city mayor of Split. Trumbić was in favor of moderate reforms in Austro-Hungarian Slavic provinces. That included the unification of Dalmatia with Croatia-Slavonia demanded by the Trumbić helped draw up.

After the assassination in Sarajevo of Archduke Franz Ferdinand and the invasion of Serbia by Austria-Hungary, Trumbić became the prominent Yugoslav nationalist leader during World War I, and led the Yugoslav Committee that lobbied the Allies to support the creation of an independent Yugoslavia. Trumbić negotiated with Serbian Prime Minister Nikola Pašić to have the Kingdom of Serbia support the creation of a Yugoslav state, which was delivered at the Corfu Declaration on 20 July 1917 that advocated the creation of a united state of Serbs, Croats and Slovenes that would be led by the Serbian House of Karađorđević. Trumbić led the Yugoslav Committee delegation at the conference in 1918 that produced the Geneva Declaration.

In 1918, he became foreign minister in the first government of the Kingdom of Serbs, Croats and Slovenes. At the Versailles conference after World War I, Trumbić had to represent Yugoslav concerns in the face of Italian territorial ambitions in Dalmatia (temporarily settled in 1920, but raised again with Benito Mussolini).

In spite of his support for a united Yugoslavia, Trumbić opposed the 1921 constitution over his belief that it was too centralized and allowed Serb hegemony over Yugoslavia. Trumbić was one of 35 representatives to vote against the constitution amid a wide boycott of the National Assembly by opposition parties. Trumbić grew steadily disillusioned with the Yugoslav government over time which he saw as Serb-dominated. He was elected for the last time in the 1927 elections on the list of the Croatian Bloc representing Zagreb together with Ante Pavelić (1869–1938).

In 1929, claiming to bring an end to the ongoing bickering between the Serbian and the Croatian representatives within the kingdom, King Alexander of Yugoslavia staged a coup d&#x27;état and banned all political parties, and removed the individual nationalities &quot;Serb&quot; and &quot;Croat&quot; from the bigger picture. He renamed the land &quot;Yugoslavia&quot;, and abrogated the constitution to establish a royal dictatorship. Trumbić was by now in retirement in Zagreb. King Alexander&#x27;s division of Croatia-Slavonia and Dalmatia into oblasts and then into banovinas, countered all previous reforms Trumbić had sought. In a September 1932 interview with The Manchester Guardian Trumbić wondered whether Croatia should separate from the Kingdom of Yugoslavia and pursue a union with Austria. In November 1932 Trumbić edited the &quot;Zagreb Points&quot;, a series of demands put forth by the Peasant-Democratic coalition to counter Serbian hegemony.

With the arrest of Croatian Peasant Party leader Vladko Maček in April 1933 Trumbić and Josip Predavec became the caretaker heads of the party. With Predavec&#x27;s assassination on 14 July, Trumbić was essentially the head of the party in Maček&#x27;s absence.

According to Henri Pozzi, Trumbić later regretted the end of Austria-Hungary, as the South Slav state he had helped to create proved incapable of his intended reforms.

<text>Bodedern is a village and community in the west of Anglesey, Wales.
At the 2001 census, it had a population of 1,074, decreasing slightly to 1,051 at the 2011 census. The community includes the settlements of Llanllibio and Pen-llyn.

==Location==
Bodedern lies on the B5109, about east of its junction with the A4025 south of Llanfachraeth. About to the south, beyond the A55 road lie the villages of Caergeiliog and Llanfihangel yn Nhowyn. The Valley Wetlands, an area of lakes and marshes and a RSPB bird sanctuary, lie between these two villages. Bodedern is the closest village to the island&#x27;s largest natural lake, Llyn Llywenan, which lies to the north.

==Education==
The village has a bilingual primary school, Ysgol Gynradd Bodedern, and a secondary school, Ysgol Uwchradd Bodedern.

==Sport==
The village&#x27;s football team, Bodedern Athletic F.C. play in the Welsh Alliance League. Bodedern was the site of the National Eisteddfod of Wales in 2017. It hosted several matches during the 2019 Inter Games Football Tournament.

==Listed buildings==
The parish church (St Edern&#x27;s Church, Bodedern) dates from the 14th century and is a Grade II* listed building, being listed because it is considered a good example of a late medieval church with some fine interior fittings.

Presaddfed Hall is a small grade II* listed country house which stands amongst woodlands to the north-east of the village at the southern tip of Llyn Llywenan. The main block was built in 1686 and is joined to an earlier block by a later block built in 1875. A walled garden lies to the east of the house. The manor was once the seat of the Lewis family, William Lewis (born 1526) is an example who served as High Sheriff of Anglesey, and was a politician holding public offices in parliament. The hall is now a country hotel.

Presaddfed Burial Chamber is a pair of Neolithic chamber tombs located a short distance northwest of Bodedern near the southern end of Llyn Llywenan.

The other scheduled monument within the community is an early Christian cemetery, east of the village, which is thought to be the location of an ancient chapel, Eglwys Ederyn. The site, at which 114 burials were recorded, was excavated in 1971, revealing several stone cists, and a stone inscribed with the word &#x27;Ercagni&#x27;, now kept in Bodedern Church.

== Notable people ==

* William Roberts (1830–1899) a British physician whose work contributed to the discovery of penicillin
* Dion Donohue (born 1993), footballer, with over 250 club caps

<text>Application Center Test (ACT) is a Microsoft load testing tool for web servers, focused on ASP.NET. It simulates numerous HTTP sessions from one machine. Using a bank of multiple computers, all firing off repeated HTTP requests, a significant load can be simulated. Tests can be written in either of the Microsoft scripting languages: VBScript and JScript. The tool can also be used for functional testing, although that is not what it is designed for. It also contains a recording function to create test cases without having to program them in.

Application Center Test was bundled with &quot;Visual Studio .NET 2003 Enterprise Architect&quot; and &quot;Enterprise Developer&quot; editions. Its main competitor is HP LoadRunner.

Application Center Test has been replaced with more powerful enterprise web application stress testing tools in Visual Studio 2005, specifically the &quot;Visual Studio 2005 Team Edition for Software Testers&quot; and the more recent &quot;Visual Studio Test Professional 2012&quot;

<doc id="842419" wikidata="Q578119" url="?curid=842419" title="Doll Man">
<text>Doll Man is a superhero first appearing in American comic books from the Golden Age of Comics, originally published by Quality Comics and currently part of the DC Comics universe of characters. Doll Man was created by cartoonist Will Eisner and first appeared in a four-page story entitled &quot;Meet the Doll Man&quot; in &quot;Feature Comics&quot; #27. He was Quality&#x27;s first super-powered character.

The issue&#x27;s December 1939 cover date indicates that Doll Man is the first comic book superhero with a shrinking power. He notably predates the more-famous Ray Palmer (DC&#x27;s the Atom) and Hank Pym (Marvel Comics&#x27; Ant-Man) by two decades.

==Quality Comics publication history==
The secret identity of Doll Man, &quot;The World&#x27;s Mightiest Mite&quot;, is research chemist Darrel Dane, who invents a formula that enables him to shrink to the height of six inches while retaining the full strength of his normal size. He was the first example of a shrinking superhero, and also one of the few that was unable to change to a height in between his minimum and maximum sizes (though artists would fail to keep his scale visually consistent). His first adventure in &quot;Feature Comics&quot; #27 involves the rescue of his fiancée, Martha Roberts, from a blackmailer. He subsequently decides to fight crime and adopts a red and blue costume sewn by Martha. Years later, somehow Martha&#x27;s wish to be able to join him in his small size comes true, and now possessing the same shrinking powers, she becomes his partner known as Doll Girl in &quot;Doll Man&quot; #37. He also has the aid of Elmo the Wonder Dog, a Great Dane who serves as his occasional steed and rescuer, and the &quot;Dollplane&quot;, which was deceptively presented as a model airplane in his study when not in use. In his adventures published during World War II, Doll Man was also frequently depicted riding a bald eagle.

The covers of Doll Man&#x27;s comics frequently portrayed him tied in ropes or other bindings, in situations ranging from being tied crucifixion-style to a running sink faucet, to being hogtied to the trigger and barrel of a handgun. The persistence of this male bondage motif in Doll Man comics among others can be contrasted with other comic books which historically portrayed women in positions of vulnerability and submission.

Doll Man was the lead feature of the anthology series &quot;Feature Comics&quot; through #139 (October, 1949), with Eisner writing the early stories under the pen name William Erwin Maxwell, and art contributed first by Lou Fine, and later by Reed Crandall. Doll Man&#x27;s own self-titled series ran from 1941 until 1953, for forty-seven issues. After the cancellation of &quot;Doll Man&quot;, original stories involving the character were not published again for two decades.

==Doll Man in DC Comics==
===Darrel Dane===
After Quality Comics went out of business in 1956, DC acquired their superhero characters. Doll Man and several other former Quality properties were re-launched in &quot;Justice League of America&quot; #107 (October 1973) as the Freedom Fighters. As was done with many other characters DC had acquired from other publishers or that were holdovers from Golden Age titles, the Freedom Fighters were located on a parallel world, one called Earth-X where Nazi Germany had won World War II. The team were featured in their own series for fifteen issues (1976–1978), in which the team temporarily leaves Earth-X for Earth-1 (where most DC titles were set). Doll Man was an occasional guest star in &quot;All-Star Squadron&quot;, a superhero team title that was set on Earth-2, the locale for DC&#x27;s WWII-era superheroes, at a time prior to when he and the other Freedom Fighters are supposed to have left for Earth-X. Doll Man then appeared with the rest of DC&#x27;s entire cast of superheroes in &quot;Crisis on Infinite Earths&quot;, a story that was intended to eliminate the similarly confusing histories that DC had attached to its characters by retroactively merging the various parallel worlds into one. This erased Doll Man&#x27;s Earth-X days, and merged the character&#x27;s &quot;All-Star Squadron&quot; and &quot;Freedom Fighter&quot; histories so that he is primarily a member of the Squadron, of which the Freedom Fighters are merely a splinter group.

Until the relaunch of the &quot;Freedom Fighters&quot; characters in 2006, Doll Man was little used by DC except for the retelling of his origin from &quot;Feature Comics&quot; #27 in &quot;Secret Origins&quot; #8 (November 1986). According to &quot;Uncle Sam and the Freedom Fighters&quot; #5 (January 2007), Darrel Dane is currently alive and confined to an unnamed mental institution.

In &quot;Uncle Sam and the Freedom Fighters&quot; v2 #3 (November 2007) Dane (whose given name is given as &quot;Darryl&quot; or &quot;Darrel&quot;) appears as the leader of a subersive group of doll-sized soldiers. He reveals that the years spent at compressed size have damaged his mind, leaving him mentally unstable.

===Lester Colt===
A new Doll Man, alias Lester Colt, was introduced in &quot;Crisis Aftermath: The Battle for Blüdhaven&quot;, a mini-series published by DC in 2006.

Lester Colt is a famous U.S. special operator, holding a B.A. in international politics and advanced degrees in the sciences. He is an &quot;Operational Management and Strategic Adviser&quot; to S.H.A.D.E. Colt seems to be highly trained in the martial arts, as well as being a very capable battlefield leader. Lester has a series of action figures named in his honor. However, he follows an &quot;ends justifies the means&quot; policy in his mission, and in &quot;Uncle Sam and the Freedom Fighters&quot; #1 is shown cold-bloodly killing a drug dealer in front of the man&#x27;s young son at the boy&#x27;s birthday party (he had infiltrated the drug dealer&#x27;s home disguised as one of his own action figures). This action earns his a severe rebuke from the revived Uncle Sam in later issues when he detects from S.H.A.D.E. and joins the new Freedom Fighters.

Colt is a highly decorated &quot;old soldier&quot;, and his personal decorations include the Legion of Merit, six Silver Stars for gallantry, fourteen Bronze Stars for Valor, and seventeen Purple Hearts.

Colt is romantically involved with scientist and former S.H.A.D.E. employee, Emma Glenn. Eager to contribute to his country, in something other than war, Lester agreed to an experiment created by Emma&#x27;s father, which reduced him to his present height. A S.H.A.D.E. squad, masquerading as a terrorist group, killed Emma&#x27;s father and destroyed the lab. Now stuck at a permanent height of six inches tall, Colt attempted to distance himself from Glenn, hoping to spare her the pain of a miniaturized boyfriend. Despite this, there are still strong feelings between the two and they are learning to cope with their new situation. This is aided by trips to The Heartland, the current Freedom Fighters&#x27; extradimensional home base, where Colt is mystically restored to full height for brief periods.

In the new &quot;Freedom Fighters&quot; series (2007–08), Lester undergoes a procedure with several other shrunken people, including Darrel Dane, to be returned to normal size. The experiment goes horribly wrong, and the group are fused together into a human-sized monstrosity. Lester is eventually freed, returns to his normal size, and seemingly retires to start a family with Glenn.

==Powers and abilities==
By willing himself, Doll Man can shrink to the height of six inches and a proportionate weight or return to his normal size. At his six-inch height, Doll Man retained the strength and athletics of a full grown man. In recent years, he have developed psionic powers, enabling him to levitate objects or destroy them with a mental blast. He has apparently aged a little, but not at all for decades, perhaps due to the mystic presence of Uncle Sam. Dane wears a special costume that changes size as he does. As Doll Man, he possesses a brilliant mind, as well as unarmed combat skills.

The second Doll Man has similar powers and access to high-tech equipment.

==Other versions==
* Alternate universe variants of Doll Man makes a cameo appearance in &quot;Titans Secret Files&quot; #2.
* An alternate universe variant of Doll Man from Earth-10 makes a cameo appearance in &quot;52&quot;.

* An alternate universe incarnation of Doll Man, spelled Dollman, appears in &quot;Freedom Fighters: The Ray&quot;, voiced by Matthew Mercer. This version hails from Earth-X.

<text>The Gulf of Trieste is a shallow bay of the Adriatic Sea, in the extreme northern part of the Adriatic Sea. It is part of the Gulf of Venice and is shared by Italy, Slovenia and Croatia. It is closed to the south by the peninsula of Istria, the largest peninsula in the Adriatic Sea, shared between Croatia and Slovenia. The entire Slovenian sea is part of the Gulf of Trieste.

==Overview==
The gulf is limited by an imaginary line connecting the Punta Tagliamento on the Italian and Savudrija (&quot;Punta Salvore&quot;) on the Croatian coast. Its area is approximately , its average depth is , and its maximum depth is . With the exception of flat islets blocking the entrance to Marano-Grado lagoon, there are no islands in the gulf. Its eastern coasts, with Trieste and the Slovenian Littoral, have more rugged relief.

The sea current in the gulf flows counterclockwise. Its average speed is 0.8 knots. Tides in the gulf are among the largest in the Adriatic Sea, but nevertheless do not usually exceed . The average salinity is 37–38‰, but in the summer it falls below 35‰.

Its most prominent features are:
* The Bay of Panzano in Italy
* The Bay of Muggia in Italy
* The Bay of Grignano in Italy
* The Bay of Koper in Slovenia
* The Gulf of Piran, the sovereignty over which has been a matter of dispute between Croatia and Slovenia since 1991.

The entire Slovenian coastline is located on the Gulf of Trieste. Its length is . Towns along the coastline include (from east to west) Koper, Izola, and Piran.

<doc id="842425" wikidata="Q379617" url="?curid=842425" title="Advanced Medium STOL Transport">
<text>The Advanced Medium STOL Transport (AMST) project was intended to replace the Lockheed C-130 Hercules tactical transport in United States Air Force service with a new aircraft with improved STOL performance. Increased need for strategic airlift led the Air Force to cancel the AMST program and seek a larger airlifter. Under the C-X program, the YC-15&#x27;s basic design would become the successful McDonnell Douglas (later Boeing) C-17 Globemaster III.

==History==
The Advanced Medium STOL Transport project arose from a USAF requirement released in 1968. The official RFP was issued in 1972, asking for a C-130-class aircraft with short take-off and landing capability. This included operating from a semi-prepared field with a radius with a payload. The C-130 of that era required about for this load.

Five companies (Bell, Boeing, Fairchild, McDonnell Douglas and the Lockheed/North American Rockwell team) submitted designs at this stage of the competition. On 10 November 1972, the downselection was carried out, and Boeing and McDonnell Douglas won development contracts for two prototypes each. This resulted in the YC-14 and YC-15, respectively.

Both the Boeing YC-14 and McDonnell-Douglas YC-15 met the specifications of the contest under most conditions. Both types had higher drag than expected, which decreased performance. In the end, it was found more economical to just continue production of the Lockheed C-130 Hercules, which the AMST might have replaced. The C-130 continues in production to this date.

On the Boeing YC-14, the upper-surface-blowing design for high aerodynamic lift used two jet engines that blew high-velocity airstreams over the inboard section of the wing and over special trailing-edge flaps. The large multisection flaps extended rearward and downward from the wing&#x27;s trailing edge to increase the wing area, thus creating extra lift, which was further augmented by positioning the engines so their jet blast across the upper wing surfaces created still more lift. In addition, the placement of the engines above the wing prevented the engines from ingesting dirt and debris and shielded some of the engine noise from the ground so that the transport could make a quieter approach.

The McDonnell Douglas YC-15 had four engines, while the Boeing version had two. The YC-15 used large double-slotted flaps that extended over 75 percent of the wingspan to enhance STOL capabilities. To save costs, it used a modified DC-8 nosewheel unit and the DC-10 cockpit, adapted for a two-person crew, with two lower windows for visibility during short-field landings.
The increasing importance of strategic vs. tactical missions eventually led to the end of the AMST program in December 1979. Then, in November 1979, the C-X Task Force formed to develop the required strategic aircraft with tactical capability. The C-X program selected a proposal for an enlarged and upgraded YC-15 and one prototype (&quot;72-1875&quot;) was reclaimed from the Pima Air &amp; Space Museum refurbished and returned to Edwards AFB, CA for flight testing that was later incorporated into development of the C-17 Globemaster III.

<text>David Mervyn Blow (27 June 1931 – 8 June 2004) was an influential British biophysicist. He was best known for the development of X-ray crystallography, a technique used to determine the molecular structures of tens of thousands of biological molecules. This has been extremely important to the pharmaceutical industry.

==Early life and education==
Blow was born in Birmingham, England. He was educated at Kingswood School in Bath, Somerset and the University of Cambridge where he won a scholarship to Corpus Christi College, Cambridge. His PhD was awarded in 1958 for X-ray analysis of haemoglobin supervised by Max Perutz at the MRC Laboratory of Molecular Biology (LMB).

==Career and research==
Following graduation from Cambridge, Blow spent two years at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) and the National Institutes of Health (NIH) funded by the Fulbright Foundation

In 1954, he met Max Perutz; they began to study a new technique wherein X-rays would be passed through a protein sample at the MRC Laboratory of Molecular Biology. This eventually led to the creation of a three-dimensional structure of haemoglobin. Blow was appointed professor of biophysics at Imperial College London in 1977. His doctoral students include Richard Henderson, Paul Sigler, and Alice Vrielink.

===Awards and honours===
Blow was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society (FRS) in 1972. He was awarded the Wolf Prize in Chemistry in 1987.

==Personal life==
Blow married Mavis Sears in 1955, and they had two children, a son Julian and a daughter Elizabeth. He died of lung cancer at the age of 72, in Appledore, Torridge (near Bideford), Devon.

<text>The inflaton field is a hypothetical scalar field which is conjectured to have driven cosmic inflation in the very early universe.
The field, originally postulated by Alan Guth, provides a mechanism by which a period of rapid expansion from 10−35 to 10−34 seconds after the initial expansion can be generated, forming a universe not inconsistent with observed spatial isotropy and homogeneity.

==Cosmological inflation==
The basic model of inflation proceeds in three phases:

* Expanding vacuum state with high potential energy
* Phase transition to true vacuum
* Slow roll and reheating

===Expanding vacuum state with high potential energy===

A &quot;vacuum&quot; or &quot;vacuum state&quot; in quantum field theory is a state of quantum fields which is at locally minimal potential energy. Quantum particles are excitations which deviate from this minimal potential energy state, therefore a vacuum state has no particles in it. Depending on the specifics of a quantum field theory, it can have more than one vacuum state. Different vacua, despite all &quot;being empty&quot; (having no particles), will generally have different vacuum energy. Quantum field theory stipulates that the pressure of the vacuum energy is always negative and equal in magnitude to its energy density.

Inflationary theory postulates that there is a vacuum state with very large vacuum energy, caused by a non-zero vacuum expectation value of the inflaton field. Any region of space in this state will rapidly expand. Even if initially it is not empty (contains some particles), very rapid exponential expansion dilutes any particles that might have previously been present to essentially zero density.

===Phase transition to true vacuum===

Inflationary theory further postulates that this &quot;inflationary vacuum&quot; state is not the state with globally lowest energy; rather, it is a &quot;false vacuum&quot;, also known as a &quot;metastable&quot; state.

For each observer at any chosen point of space, the false vacuum eventually tunnels into a state with the same potential energy, but which is not a vacuum (it is not at a local minimum of the potential energy—it can &quot;decay&quot;). This state can be seen as a true vacuum, filled with a large number of inflaton particles. However, the rate of expansion of the true vacuum does not change at that moment: Only its exponential character changes to much slower expansion of the FLRW metric. This ensures that expansion rate precisely matches the energy density.

===Slow roll and reheating===

In the true vacuum, inflaton particles decay, eventually giving rise to the observed Standard Model particles. The shape of the potential energy function near &quot;tunnel exit&quot; from false vacuum state must have a shallow slope, otherwise particle production would be confined to the boundary of expanding true vacuum bubble, which contradicts observation (the universe we see around us is not built of huge &quot;completely&quot; void bubbles). In other words, the quantum state should &quot;roll to the bottom slowly&quot;.

When complete, the decay of inflaton particles fills the space with hot and dense Big Bang plasma.

==Field quanta==
Just like every other quantum field, excitations of the inflaton field are expected to be quantized. The field quanta of the inflaton field are known as inflatons. Depending on the modeled potential energy density, the inflaton field&#x27;s ground state might, or might not, be zero.

The term &quot;inflaton&quot; follows the typical style of other quantum particles’ names – such as photon, gluon, boson, and fermion – deriving from the word &quot;inflation&quot;. The term was first used in a paper by .
The nature of the inflaton field is currently not known. One of the obstacles for narrowing its properties is that current quantum theory is not able to correctly predict the observed vacuum energy, based on the particle content of a chosen theory (see vacuum catastrophe).

Atkins (2012) suggested that it is possible that no new field is necessary – that a modified version of the Higgs field could function as an inflaton.

==Non-minimally coupled inflation==
Non-minimally coupled inflation is an inflationary model in which the constant which couples gravity to the inflaton field is not small. The coupling constant is usually represented by formula_1 (letter &quot;xi&quot;), which features in the action (constructed by modifying the Einstein–Hilbert action):

:formula_2,

with formula_1 representing the strength of the interaction between formula_4 and formula_5, which respectively relate to the curvature of space and the magnitude of the inflaton field.

<text>Dale Lynsey Manawa &quot;Chief&quot; McIntosh (born 23 November 1969) is a former Wales international rugby union player and now rugby union coach. He was born in Tūrangi, New Zealand.

==Rugby Union career==

===Amateur career===

He played for Pontypridd.

===Provincial career===

McIntosh qualified to play for Scotland by virtue of a Scottish grandfather.

He played for the Scottish Exiles in the Scottish Inter-District Championship.

===International career===

He was capped by Scotland &#x27;B&#x27; to play against Ireland &#x27;B&#x27; on 28 December 1991. He was capped again by the &#x27;B&#x27; side to play against France &#x27;B&#x27; on 2 February 1992.

He was then capped by Scotland &#x27;A&#x27; in 1992 and 1993. Although &#x27;A&#x27; sides are now deemed &#x27;capture&#x27; sides, at the time players could more easily switch nationality when captured - and McIntosh switched nationality to play for Wales when his international career seemed to stall with Scotland.

He was capped by Wales in 1996 and 1997.

==Coaching career==

McIntosh went on to coach in Wales after his playing career ended. He coached with Pontypridd, Cardiff Blues and Merthyr.

<text>The Air and Space Outstanding Unit Award (ASOUA) is one of the unit awards of the United States Air Force and United States Space Force. It was established in 1954 as the Air Force Outstanding Unit Award and was the first independent Air Force decoration created (to this point, Air Force personnel were routinely awarded Army decorations). The Air Force Longevity Service Award would follow in 1957 with most of the standard Air Force awards (including the Air Force Good Conduct Medal) established in the early to mid 1960s.

The Outstanding Unit Award is awarded to any unit of the U.S. Air Force (including the Air Force Reserve and the Air National Guard) which performs exceptionally meritorious service, accomplishes specific acts of outstanding achievement, excels in combat operations against an armed enemy of the United States, or conducts with distinct military operations involving conflict with, or exposure to, a hostile action by any opposing foreign force.

Multiple awards of the Outstanding Unit Award are denoted by bronze oak leaf clusters, and silver oak leaf clusters, as applicable, on the ribbon.

Until 2004, the Outstanding Unit Award was the senior most unit award in the U.S. Air Force. It now ranks directly below the Meritorious Unit Award, which was established in March 2004, and above the Air Force Organizational Excellence Award in the precedence of Air Force awards and decorations. It is awarded to personnel who were assigned or attached to the unit receiving the award during the period it was awarded for. Non-USAF personnel (e.g., USN, USMC, USCG) personnel assigned to USAF units awarded the Outstanding Unit Award are also eligible to wear the ribbon on their uniforms. However, the ribbon does not come in the larger size of unit awards common to the U.S. Army.

On 16 November 2020, the Air Force Outstanding Unit Award was renamed the Air and Space Outstanding Unit Award by the Secretary of the Air Force.

<text>Horace Basil Barlow FRS (8 December 1921 – 5 July 2020) was a British vision scientist.

==Early life==

Barlow was the son of the civil servant Sir Alan Barlow and his wife Lady Nora(granddaughter of the naturalist Charles Darwin). Barlow was the great-grandson of Charles Darwin and thus part of the Darwin — Wedgwood family.

He was educated at Winchester College where he met and befriended Freeman Dyson. Barlow read natural sciences at Trinity College, Cambridge and earned an M.D. at Harvard University in 1946.

==Research==

In 1953, Barlow discovered that the frog brain has neurons which fire in response to specific visual stimuli. This was a precursor to the work of Hubel and Wiesel on visual receptive fields in the visual cortex. He has made a long study of visual inhibition, the process whereby a neuron firing in response to one group of retinal cells can inhibit the firing of another neuron; this allows perception of relative contrast.

In 1961, Barlow wrote a seminal article where he asked what the computational aims of the visual system are. He concluded that one of the main aims of visual processing is the reduction of redundancy, which has been extended to the efficient coding hypothesis. While the brightnesses of neighbouring points in images are usually very similar, the retina reduces this redundancy. His work thus was central to the field of statistics of natural scenes that relates the statistics of images of real world scenes to the properties of the nervous system.

Barlow also worked in the field of factorial codes. The goal was to encode images with statistically redundant components or pixels such that the code components are statistically independent. Such codes are hard to find but highly useful for purposes such as image classification.

==Awards and distinctions==
Barlow was a fellow of Trinity College, University of Cambridge. He was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society in 1969 and was awarded their Royal Medal in 1993. He received the 1993 Australia Prize (along with Peter Bishop and Vernon Mountcastle) for his research into the mechanisms of visual perception, and the 2009 Swartz Prize for Theoretical and Computational Neuroscience from the Society for Neuroscience. He was awarded the first Ken Nakayama Prize from the Vision Sciences Society in 2016.

==Personal life==
Barlow was married twice and fathered seven children. In 1954, he married Ruthala Salaman, daughter of M.H. Salaman. They had four daughters: Rebecca, Natasha, Naomi and Emily. They were divorced in 1970. In 1980, he married Miranda, daughter of John Weston-Smith. They had one son, Oscar, and two daughters, Ida and Pepita. 

Barlow died on 5 July 2020, at the age of 98.

<doc id="842444" wikidata="Q378302" url="?curid=842444" title="Jönssonligan">
<text>Jönssonligan, literally the &quot;Jönsson Gang&quot;, is a Swedish comedy film series, originally based on the Danish series of films about the Olsen-banden, but later with unique scripts.

The Jönsson gang consists of the leader and criminal genius Charles Ingvar &quot;Sickan&quot; Jönsson, hence the name, and his two companions &quot;Dynamit-Harry&quot; (an alcoholic demolitions expert) and Ragnar Vanheden (a small-timer from Stockholm). Eight films have been made in total, though in the last three films actor Gösta Ekman got tired of his character &quot;Sickan&quot;, and was replaced by the following characters, in order; &quot;Doctor Max Adrian Busé&quot;, &quot;Herman Melvin&quot; and &quot;Sven-Ingvar &#x27;Sivan&#x27; Jönsson&quot;. The first two films featured the character Rocky, a Swedish-speaking Finn as member of the gang. He was eventually replaced by &quot;Dynamit-Harry&quot; who first appeared in the second film. Jönssonligans arch-enemy is Jacob Morgan Rockefeller Wall-Enberg Jr. - somewhat of a cross between a business magnate and a ruthless mob boss - who in all the films have been played by Per Grundén. His name alludes to the real-life Swedish business magnates Anders Wall and the Wallenberg family. Wall-Enbergs henchman is Biffen. In every film except for &quot;Jönssonligan dyker upp igen&quot; and &quot;Jönssonligan på Mallorca&quot; he has been played by Weiron Holmberg. In &quot;Jönssonligan dyker upp igen&quot; he is played by Lars Dejert and in &quot;Jönssonligan på Mallorca&quot; he never appears.

The main series has also created a spin-off series called &quot;Lilla Jönssonligan&quot; (Little Jönsson gang), which portrays the main three characters of the series as kids. The only recurring actor in all the &quot;Lilla Jönssonligan&quot; is Loa Falkman who plays Wall-Enberg Jr&#x27;s father Oscar Wall-Enberg Sr.

A reboot named &quot;Jönssonligan – Den perfekta stöten&quot; with new actors in the roles was released on 16 January 2015. The film was the first since &quot;Jönssonligan &amp; Dynamit-Harry&quot; to feature the line-up Sickan, Vanheden, Rocky and Dynamit-Harry and the first not to feature Wall-Enberg, instead featuring an antagonist named &#x27;Wallentin&#x27;. The film was not commercially successful. A second reboot premiered in 2020.

<text>Theodore Austin-Sparks (1888–1971), often known as &quot;Mr. Sparks&quot; or &quot;TAS&quot;, was a British Christian evangelist and author.

==Early life==
After his birth in London in 1888, Theodore was sent at a young age to live in Scotland with his father&#x27;s relatives. There, at the age of 17, he determined to become a Christian as he listened to a group of young street-preachers in Glasgow. Within a short time, he was also giving his public testimony alongside this group.

==Career==
Mr Austin-Sparks was ordained as a Baptist minister at the age of 24. From 1912 to 1926, he led three congregations in Greater London. During 1923–26, he spoke at conferences with Jessie Penn-Lewis and was associated with her publication and speaking ministry, &quot;The Overcomer Testimony&quot;. In 1926, Austin-Sparks broke with this organization.

Following a spiritual crisis in 1926, Mr Austin-Sparks resigned his Baptist ordination. Later that year the congregation at Honor Oak all agreed to leave the Baptist denomination (see Church Notes in the 1926 A Witness and A Testimony magazines). Together with like-minded Christians, he established a conference and training center at Honor Oak in southeast London. A great number of Christians participated in conferences and classes at the center while staying at available guest quarters, some living there for years at a time participating in Bible courses, practical services, and church meetings. There was a similar conference center maintained during the summers at Heathfield House in Kilcreggan, Scotland which was owned by Honor Oak Christian Fellowship. A Trust was set up for the house in 1931. In 1960 Kilcreggan was gifted to the interdenominational faith mission, WEC International.

From the Honor Oak Christian Fellowship Centre Mr Austin-Sparks and his co-workers ran a publishing operation that printed a bi-monthly magazine, &quot;A Witness and a Testimony&quot;. This magazine was printed from 1923 until Austin-Sparks&#x27; death in 1971. Theodore Austin-Sparks also published books he had written or were edited from transcripts of his recorded messages. He was a prolific author/speaker and published most of his messages first in his free bimonthly magazines.

The first page of his magazine included the following statement:

Among the many books written by T. Austin-Sparks, the most well-known include &quot;The School of Christ&quot;,&quot;The Centrality and Supremacy of the Lord Jesus Christ&quot;] and &quot;We Beheld His Glory&quot;.

Mr Austin-Sparks&#x27; speaking ministry took him around Europe, North America and Asia holding conferences in the United Kingdom, the United States, Switzerland, Taiwan, the Philippines, and elsewhere. Many of his spoken messages were recorded, and a great number of audio messages and books remain available on https://www.austin-sparks.net. He was insistent that his writings and messages be reproduced word-for-word as originally spoken or written.

His work at the Honor Oak Christian Fellowship and Conference Centre was international in scope. Many who trained under his ministry became missionaries and Christian teachers, as shown in the notes of the A Witness and a Testimony magazines and in testimonies given. This enabled him to work closely with several well-known Christian leaders in the UK and other countries, including Bakht Singh of India, Watchman Nee of China, Roger Forster of Forest Hill, Stephen Kaung of Richmond, Virginia and Lance Lambert of Jerusalem, Israel.

==Publications==
Mr Austin-Sparks self-published many of his books from the fellowship center in Honor Oak, London. The name of their publication ministry was Witness and Testimony Publishers. Theodore Austin-Sparks and the Witness and Testimony Publishers also published messages by other authors, many of whom were associated with Honor Oak or whom TAS knew personally. In particular, the first version of Watchman Nee&#x27;s &quot;The Normal Christian Life&quot; was published chapter by chapter in the A Witness and A Testimony magazine. The Publishers later also published the series as a book. 

Some of Theodore Austin-Sparks books were also published by:

Testimony Book Ministry USA (1948-1998)

Three Brothers Books USA (1980-)

Emmanuel Church USA (1980-)

Seedsowers USA (1997-)

Austin-Sparks.Net (2001-)

==Legacy==
Theodore Austin-Sparks died April 13, 1971. Mr Austin-Sparks deliberately made no provision for the continuing of his magazine or ministry following his death. A colleague of his, Harry Foster, wrote: &quot;Mr. Austin-Sparks had left word that there should be no automatic continuation of the magazine ministry&quot;. Mr Austin-Sparks believed that what was from God and of God would be taken care of by Him, he wrote: &quot;God only takes responsibility to supply and to carry on that which is essentially heavenly, and in the measure in which a thing is heavenly, and only in that measure (but surely in that measure), God takes responsibility for it&quot;. He and his wife Florence, had 4 daughters and 1 son. Florence Austin-Sparks died in 1986.

<text>Janusz Tadeusz Kusociński (15 January 1907 – 21 June 1940) was a Polish athlete, winner in the 10,000 meters event at the 1932 Summer Olympics.

== Biography ==
Born in Warsaw into the family of a railroad worker, Janusz Kusociński, or &quot;Kusy&quot; as he was nicknamed, played football for various Warsaw clubs as a schoolboy. He took up athletics in 1928 after joining the sport club &quot;Sarmata&quot;. His coach there was the famous Estonian, decathlete Aleksander Klumberg.

In his first competition at the Polish National Championships, Kusociński surprisingly won the 5000 m and cross country titles. He missed the next season, because he was called to duty by the Polish army, but he came back stronger than ever. He won the Polish Championship titles in the 1500 m and the 5000 m, in cross country in 1930 and 1931, and in the 800 m in 1932.

In 1932 Kusociński was working as a gardener in a park in Warsaw. Just about a month before the Los Angeles Olympics, Kusociński ran a new world record in the 3000 m (8:18.8) and later that year, he set a new unofficial world record in running 4 miles in a time of 19:02.6. At the Olympics, Kusociński won a close battle against the Finns Volmari Iso-Hollo and Lasse Virtanen in the 10 000 m, with a world season&#x27;s best time of 30:11.4.

Kusociński won the British AAA Championships title in the 3 miles event at the 1934 AAA Championships. 

After finishing second in the first European Championships at Turin in the 5000 m in 1934, Kusociński decided to retire from athletics, but made a comeback in 1939 by winning the 10 000 m at the Polish National Championships.

Kusociński volunteered for the Polish army after Poland was attacked by the Germans and was wounded twice. During the German occupation he worked as a waiter, but was secretly a member of the Polish resistance. Janusz Kusociński was arrested by the Gestapo on 26 March 1940 during the AB Action and imprisoned in Mokotów Prison. He was executed three months later in Palmiry, near Warsaw.

An annual athletics competition, the Kusociński Memorial, is held in Poland in his honour. It was in its 55th edition in 2009. On 12 August 2009, he was posthumously awarded the Commander&#x27;s Cross with Star of the Order of Polonia Restituta, &quot;for outstanding contribution to the independence of the Polish Republic, for sporting achievements in the field of athletics&quot;.

<doc id="842462" wikidata="Q3382930" url="?curid=842462" title="Pierre-Charles Le Sueur">
<text>Pierre-Charles Le Sueur (; c. 1657, Artois, France – 17 July 1704, Havana, Cuba) was a French fur trader and explorer in North America, recognized as the first known European to explore the Minnesota River valley.

Le Sueur came to Canada with the Jesuits to their mission at Sault Sainte Marie, but very soon he turned himself to fur trade and became a coureur des bois. He was fluent in several Native languages, which was crucial to his success in trade. Around 1683, he received some samples of bluish clay from the middle reaches of a tributary of the Mississippi and took it back to France to be analyzed. A chemist, Alexandre L&#x27;Huillier, deemed it to be copper ore. Le Sueur returned to New France to mine this ore, but was waylayed by, among other things, a prison term for overreaching his trade privileges. He was present at the formal assertion of French sovereignty of Canada, declared in 1689 by Nicholas Perrot at Green Bay. Eventually, however, he was given a royal commission to open a copper mine (although some suggested he was more interested in &quot;mining furs&quot;).

In 1699, he was with the group that ascended the Mississippi River from Biloxi to the &quot;country of the Nadouessioux&quot;, stopping to overwinter at Isle Pelée or Fort Perrot above Lake Pepin. He went upstream as far as Saint Anthony Falls. After trading with the local Dakota bands (the Mdewankantons, Wahpetons and Wahpekutes) in the area, in the summer and fall of 1700 he and a group of 20 men went further up the river known to the native population as &quot;minisota&quot;, or &quot;cloud reflected water&quot;. This river was known to later voyageurs as the St. Pierre, but it is unclear if Le Sueur knew it by that name at the time. The group continued to the Blue Earth River, where they built Fort L&#x27;Huillier, named for the chemist who declared it to be copper ore. They overwintered at Fort L&#x27;Huillier, trading furs and other merchandise with the local Indian bands. They found the prairies full of bison, and learned to subsist largely on a meat diet. In May 1701, Le Sueur left a garrison of men at the fort under the command of d&#x27;Eraque and accompanied a large quantity of the blue earth (Dakota language: &quot;makháto&quot;) back to Fort Mobile for further analysis, which revealed that it was not copper and thus worthless. Later that year, Fort L&#x27;Huillier was attacked by Sac and Fox Indians. Three men were killed in the attack on the fort, which was then abandoned.

Le Sueur sailed to France to secure a commission to serve as a local magistrate in what is now Alabama. &quot;Le Sueur was supposed to leave France on the Loire in 1703 but he did not actually sail until the spring of 1704 aboard the Pélican. The ship, which was carrying nurses and women to Louisiana, stopped at Havana where Le Sueur contracted yellow fever. He had to be left behind and, after drawing up his will, he died on 17 July and was buried in the parish church of San Cristóbal.&quot;

He is the namesake of Le Sueur, Minnesota, Le Sueur River and Le Sueur County, Minnesota.

<text>Daniela Mercury (born Daniela Mercuri de Almeida on July 28, 1965) is a Brazilian singer, songwriter, dancer, and producer. In her solo career, Mercury has sold over 11 million records worldwide, and had 24 Top 10 singles in the country, with 14 of them reached No. 1. Winner of a Latin Grammy for her album &quot;Balé Mulato – Ao Vivo&quot;, she also received six Brazilian Music Award, an APCA award, three Multishow Brazilian Music Awards and two awards at VMB: Best Music Video and Photography.

In 1991, Mercury released her self-titled album, which was followed by &quot;O Canto da Cidade&quot; a year later, boosting her career as a national artist and taking the axé music to the evidence. Over the years, Mercury released several albums, generating great singles like &quot;Swing da Cor&quot;, &quot;O Canto da Cidade&quot;, &quot;À Primeira Vista&quot;, &quot;Rapunzel&quot;, &quot;Nobre Vagabundo&quot;, &quot;Ilê Pérola Negra&quot;, &quot;Mutante&quot;, &quot;Maimbê Dandá&quot;, &quot;Levada Brasileira&quot;, &quot;Oyá Por Nós&quot;, among others. She recorded a commemorative DVD of Cirque du Soleil&#x27;s 25th anniversary, and was part of the Montreal Jazz Festival. In addition, Mercury was invited to participate in the Alejandro Sanz&#x27;s DVD, and sing with Paul McCartney in Oslo, Norway, during the delivery of the Nobel Peace Prize.

In 2009 she released her album called &quot;Canibália&quot;, along with the album, Daniela launched an international tour. The album spawned three singles: &quot;Preta&quot; with Seu Jorge, &quot;Oyá Por Nós&quot; with Margareth Menezes and &quot;Sol do Sul&quot;. That same year, writer and intellectual Camille Paglia, who had an intellectual &quot;passion&quot; for Madonna, said Daniela Mercury is the artist who Madonna would like to be.

In 2011 the American TV channel CBS, elected Daniela Mercury as the &quot;Carmen Miranda of the new times&quot;. The &quot;Canibália&quot; album was released in the United States yielded a critique of The New York Times saying: &quot;Daniela Mercury goes beyond the concepts that were stressed during her career (...) with a contemporary pop, embracing ethnic and cultural diversity of Brazil (particularly african-Brazilian culture, while Daniela Mercury is white), remembering the past and transforming it.&quot;

==Early life==
Daniela Mercuri de Almeida was born on July 28, 1965, in the Portuguese Hospital in Salvador, Bahia. Her mother is Liliana Mercuri, a social worker of Italian ancestry, and her father is António Fernando de Abreu Ferreira de Almeida, a Portuguese emigrant industrial mechanic. Mercury grew up in a middle class household in the Brotas neighborhood of Salvador with her four siblings: Tom, Cristiana, Vânia (who would also become a singer, billed as Vânia Abreu), and Marcos. A troublemaker as a child, Mercury was nicknamed &quot;drip-fire&quot;. She attended both the Ana Néri School and the Colégio Baiano.

At eight years old, Mercury began taking dance lessons, particularly classical ballet, jazz, and African dances. At age 13, influenced by the work of Elis Regina, she decided to become a singer. Her repertoire consisted of bossa nova as well as the music of Caetano Veloso, Gilberto Gil, and Chico Buarque. To her parents&#x27; unease she started singing in local bars in 1980. She made her trio elétrico debut soon afterward, during the 1981 carnival. Mercury&#x27;s zeal for dance eventually led her to the Federal University of Bahia, where she enrolled in the Dance School in 1984. A year later she married electronic engineer Zalther Póvoas and gave birth to Gabriel Almeida Póvoas. The next year she gave birth to daughter Giovana Almeida Póvoas.

==Career==

===Early career (1984–1990)===
From 1986 to 1988, Mercury was the lead singer for the band Cheiro de Amor. Mercury continued to pursue a career in music and, by 1988, was a backup singer for Gilberto Gil. In 1989, recorded her first two albums as the lead singer of pop band Companhia Clic. Their songs &quot;Pega que Oh!&quot; and &quot;Ilha das Bananas&quot; became minor hits in Bahia radio stations. As the 1990s began, Mercury decided to pursue a solo career.

===Rise to fame (1991–1993)===
Mercury&#x27;s self-titled debut album was released in 1991 through independent record company Eldorado. The lead single of the album, &quot;Swing da Cor&quot;, which features Olodum, became a number-one hit in Brazil, and the album was soon known as &quot;Swing da Cor&quot;. Another song from the album, &quot;Menino do Pelô&quot;, which also features Olodum, became Mercury&#x27;s second top-ten hit in Brazil, charting at number four. On the following year, Mercury shut off from the record company and, ever since, produces her own albums to negotiate the distribution of them later with the labels that are interested.

In 1992, she presented the project &quot;Som do Meio-Dia&quot; (Midday Sound) at the Art Museum of São Paulo (MASP). The show brought together over thirty thousand spectators, which eventually leave the traffic jam in the vicinity of the Paulista Avenue. After forty-minutes concert, Daniela was removed from the stage by representatives of the São Paulo tourist office, that concerned with the museum structure, obtained an order from the military police to remove it from the local.

Soon after the show, Daniela was hired by Sony Music label and through this, released her second solo album, &quot;O Canto da Cidade&quot;. The album was considered by journalist André Domingues one of the best MPB albums ever. &quot;O Canto da Cidade&quot; is Mercury&#x27;s album with most number-one songs (four in total; &quot;O Canto da Cidade&quot;, &quot;O Mais Belo dos Belos&quot;, &quot;Batuque&quot; and &quot;Você Não Entende Nada/Cotidiano&quot;). &quot;O Canto da Cidade&quot; is recognized as the album responsible for taking Axé Music to mainstream audiences in Brazil.

The album also yielded Mercury, a year-end special on Rede Globo channel, which were mixed with live performances in the square of Apotheosis in Rio de Janeiro, and video clips with Caetano Veloso, Herbert Vianna and Tom Jobim. Years later, the special, previously unreleased in video was released on DVD to celebrate the 15th anniversary of the release of the album. In July 1993, Mercury was one of Brazil&#x27;s attractions at the prestigious Montreux Jazz Festival in Switzerland.

Some consider &quot;O Canto da Cidade&quot; was the forerunner of the samba-reggae movement, then called Axé Music, gaining strength in all regions of the country and allowing other genre artists, were featured in the Brazilian music scene. It is believed that after this album, the Carnival of Bahia gained a massive media coverage. Mercury experienced during this period, a peak of popularity rarely seen in the history of Brazilian music industry, being dubbed &quot;the hurricane of Bahia&quot; and &quot;Queen of the Axé&quot;.

===Artistic development (1994–2000)===
In 1994, &quot;Música de Rua&quot; was released through Sony. The album was received with lukewarm reviews, with some critics complaining about the similarities between this album and its predecessor. Nevertheless, the album was very well received by the public, producing the hits &quot;Música de Rua&quot;, &quot;O Reggae e o Mar&quot; (both number-one hits), &quot;Por Amor ao Ilê&quot; (a top-ten hit) and &quot;A Rosa&quot; (top-twenty). This was Mercury&#x27;s first album to produce singles which have failed to chart.

In 1996, &quot;Feijão com Arroz&quot; was released through Sony. This album was much better received by the critics than its predecessor. It is Mercury&#x27;s most well rated album at Allmusic, with four and a half stars. As of today, &quot;Feijão com Arroz&quot; is Mercury&#x27;s second best selling album, behind only &quot;O Canto da Cidade&quot;. It produced the hits &quot;À Primeira Vista&quot;, &quot;Nobre Vagabundo&quot;, &quot;Rapunzel&quot; (all number-one hits), &quot;Minas com Bahia&quot; (which features Samuel Rosa from Skank and was a top-twenty hit) and &quot;Feijão de Corda&quot; (a top-ten hit).

In 1998, Mercury&#x27;s first live album, &quot;Elétrica&quot; was released through Sony. It produced the top-ten hit &quot;Trio Metal&quot;, which charted at number eight.

===Experimentation with electronica (2000–2004)===

In 2000, Mercury released her fifth studio album, &quot;Sol da Liberdade&quot;, through BMG. It produced two number-one singles (&quot;Ilê Pérola Negra&quot; and a cover of Antonio Marcus&#x27; &quot;Como Vai Você&quot;). The album, which was produced by Suba, was innovative in Mercury&#x27;s career for its fusion with electronic music sounds.

The following year, Mercury released &quot;Sou de Qualquer Lugar&quot; through BMG. The album sold half of its predecessor, but was able to produce the number-one single &quot;Mutante&quot;, a cover of Rita Lee. In this album, Mercury also experimented with electronic sounds.

In April 2003, Mercuy&#x27;s second live album, &quot;MTV ao Vivo – Eletrodoméstico&quot;, was released through BMG. It was recorded on January 23 and 24 of that same year at the Castro Alves Theater in Salvador for MTV Brasil. It was also released in the DVD format, Mercury&#x27;s first. Among the artists who performed with the singer were Dulce Pontes, Rosario Flores, Jovanotti, Carlinhos Brown and Olodum. The sales were very inferior to Mercury&#x27;s previous and it only produced one top twenty hit (&quot;Meu Plano&quot;).

In 2004, &quot;Carnaval Eletrônico&quot; was released through BMG. For the recording of this album, Mercury invited DJs and producers of electronic music in Brazil, as well as Gilberto Gil, Carlinhos Brown, and Lenine. It is a commemorative disc celebrating the five years of her having formed &quot;TrioTechno&quot;, the first trio elétrico of electronic music in Bahian Carnaval. The disc received a Latin Grammy nomination for best pop album of the year and Mercury was nominated for a TIM Award for best female pop/rock vocalist. Internet users voted &quot;Carnaval Eletrônico&quot; the best pop album of the year online in one of Brazil&#x27;s most important weekly magazines &quot;Revista Isto É&quot;.

===Back to basics (2005–2007)===
In 2005, &quot;Clássica&quot; was released through Som Livre on both CD and DVD. Recorded from a concert Mercury gave the year before at São Paulo&#x27;s Casa de Espetáculo, the album is a sampler of bossa nova, jazz, and some of her biggest MPB hits. The record signaled a new phase for Mercury, who chose independence from record companies to gain full control of her work. Mercury was in London, during the July 7 bombings.

That same year, Mercury&#x27;s eighth studio album, &quot;Balé Mulato&quot;, was released, but through EMI. The album was very well received by the critics, with some even saying it was Mercury&#x27;s best album since &quot;Feijão com Arroz&quot; (1996). It was not, however, very well received by the public, with none of the singles being able to chart on the top-ten; a large part due to lack of record company support. The next year, the Latin Grammy Award-winning live version of &quot;Balé Mulato&quot;, was released. Daniela Mercury has completed her newest release, &quot;Canibália&quot;. Canibalia was launched in October 2009.

===Reinventing popular culture with Canibália and working with Cabeça de Nós Todos (2007–2013)===
On November 19, 2007, the singer released &quot;Preta&quot;, which features Seu Jorge. The song, which is strongly influenced by samba, was one of the most played in the country during the carnival. For the 2009&#x27;s Carnival, Mercury recorded the song &quot;Oyá Por Nós&quot;, who wrote with Alfredo Moura and Margareth Menezes. The theme, based on the song &quot;Ketu de Iansã&quot; was first used by Moura in the doctoral ceremony honoris-cause of Gilberto Gil at the University of Aveiro in Portugal. After that, Moura used the theme in a play in Vienna, Austria, at the University of Musicology. A year later, he showed the theme for Daniela, who did not know and she immediately wanted to record it to launch in the Carnival. In 2009, Rolling Stone Brasil magazine named Daniela as one of the 100 greatest artists of Brazilian music of all time. The names chosen by the expert jury, only 16 were women.

Finally in November 2009, Daniela released the album entitled &quot;Canibália&quot;. The album marks her return to the studio after five years. The recording sessions for the album takes almost three years to be done, &quot;Canibália&quot; hit stores with five different covers – a Gringo Cardia project. And five different track lists for the album, according to the singer, is an extensive project that combines music, dance, video and plastic arts – various expressions of art covered by it.

Daniela Mercury has said that &quot;Canibália is an embrace, a swallow of Tropicália, the Clube da Esquina and everything that has since been created in the arts in Brazil since the – ‘Semana de 22’ [‘Semana de Arte Moderna de 1922 ’-The Week of Modern Art] – I yearn for the liberty that comes from this anthropophagic movement, of the Cannibalist Manifesto by Oswald de Andrade and its practice by Mario [de Andrade), who spoke that these mixtures reinforce our [Brazilian] identity&quot;.

José Oswald de Andrade Souza (1890 – October 1954) was a Brazilian poet and a controversial thinker. Born in São Paulo, Andrade was one of the founders of the Brazilian Modernist movement and a member of the Group of Five, including Mário de Andrade, Anita Malfatti, Tarsila do Amaral Oswald de Andrade]. Andrade is recognized by his nationalist, &quot;Manifesto Antropófago&quot; (Cannibalist Manifesto), published in 1928.
The manifesto argues that based on the premise that the history of Brazil has, as its greatest strength, the power to cannibalize others and simultaneously plays with the idea of cannibalism as a modern primitivism; like a presumed tribal rite.
Cannibalism then, becomes a way for Brazil to reaffirm itself against the cultural domination of Post Colonial Europe.
The iconic phrase of the manifesto &quot;Tupi or not Tupi&quot; is as much a celebration of the Tupinamba, a documented tribe of cannibals, as it is an act of genius cannibalizing Shakespeare&#x27;s, &quot;To be or not to be&quot;.

In 2009, her tour named by the album title started in São Paulo, and traveled to several Brazilian cities and abroad. The work pays tribute to Carmen Miranda, at her centenary, with songs like &quot;Tico-Tico no Fubá&quot; and &quot;O Que É Que A Baiana Tem?&quot;.

For 2010&#x27;s Carnival, Daniela Mercury recorded &quot;Andarilho Encantado&quot;, song released officially in the special project of the singer called &quot;Pôr do Som&quot; (Sunset Sound), the show that brings Mercury as headliner each year on the first day of the year at the Farol da Barra, in Salvador, Bahia. The song was written by Mercury and Marcelo Quintanilha. Also in 2010, the year that the Electric Trio celebrates 60 years and Axé Music 25 years, the singer reaches 20 years of solo career – with significant-selling records. To commemorate the date, the media raised the possibility it make a documentary film about this invention of Bahian carnival, the axé music, praising percussionists.

In February 2013, the singer was invited to be interviewed in the &quot;Leading Women&quot; program of CNN International, and was announced by the issuer as the &quot;Brazilian Madonna&quot;. The attraction highlights the most influential women in the world in their fields. Already in 2012, the Bahian singer had attracted the attention of American writer and feminist Camille Paglia, who declared to the British newspaper The Independent, that had a &quot;crush&quot; by the Bahian star. Since she had been in the country, for a conference in Bahia, Paglia has written enthusiastic articles about Mercury, saying that Daniela Mercury is the artist who Madonna wanted to be. Paglia said, a Canadian television station, which is &quot;in love with a Brazilian superstar. I&#x27;m watching her work. She is Daniela Mercury. In fact, this has been very important. This is the point where I am in my life&quot; . In an interview with the Brazilian magazine Veja, intellectual revealed her plans to write two books about the Bahian singer.

At the end of 2013, released the album &quot;Daniela Mercury &amp; Cabeça de Nós Todos&quot;, a partnership with the Brazilian group Cabeça de Nós Todos, with songs like &quot;Couché&quot;, &quot;Alma Feminina&quot;, &quot;Paula e Bebeto&quot;, &quot;Aquele Abraço&quot; and &quot;Cheia de Graça&quot; are some of the tracks are presented in this work. It is an urban and pop-rock album, which does not show Daniela&#x27;s rhythmic signature; it was launched with a book called &quot;Daniela and Malu, A Love Story&quot;, a partnership with her wife Malu Verçosa. The book tells the story of their relationship, from the moment of friendship to marriage.

===The Voice Kids and Vinil Virtual (2014–present)===

In 2014, she was mentor on The Voice Kids (the version for children of the traditional show The Voice) of Portugal, because of her popularity in Portuguese lands. In the same year she released the single &quot;A Rainha do Axé (Rainha Má)&quot;, an electronic ijexá that speaks about the strength of women, love and faith which was sung by revelers during the 2015&#x27;s Carnival of Salvador. The single is the first single to the fifteenth studio album by the singer titled &quot;Vinil Virtual&quot;, released November 27, 2015 by the label Biscoito Fino.

==Personal life==

In 1984, at 19, Mercury married electronic engineer Zalther Portela Laborda Póvoas, her high school boyfriend. The next year, on September 3, 1985, she gave birth to their first child, Gabriel (who is also a singer and songwriter). The following year, she gave birth to a girl named Giovana (who is now a dancer in Mercury&#x27;s ensemble). In 1996, Mercury and Póvoas divorced. That same year, she was pointed as the reason for the split between Chico Buarque and Marieta Severo. In an interview to &quot;ISTOÉ&quot; magazine, Mercury said that &quot;it was a levity what they did, an irresponsibility that caused an uproar in my life and in the lives of both of them&quot;. In April 2013 Daniela Mercury used social media to make public her relationship with the journalist Malu Verçosa, saying that &quot;Malu is now my wife, my family, my inspiration to sing.&quot; Daniela Mercury and Malu Verçosa married on October 12, 2013, in a civil ceremony in Salvador da Bahia, both dressed in all white. Her father, initially critical about their relationship, was present.

==Controversies==
At late 2005, Mercury, a devout Catholic, was uninvited from a Christmas concert in the Vatican City due to her endorsement of a Ministry of Health campaign encouraging young people to use condoms. Church officials feared she would use the occasion to promote the use of condoms.

In 2006, Mercury openly opposed Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva&#x27;s reelection. This drew criticism from other artists, such as Zeca Baleiro, who accused her of being favored by the late Antônio Carlos Magalhães, a controversial oligarch from Bahia (which she denied vehemently). Later that same year, in an interview with &quot;Folha de S.Paulo&quot;, Mercury declared she was against reelections in general. She also said that she voted for Lula four times and that she was disappointed &quot;by his first term (...), shocked with all these scandals&quot;. However, she said that she hoped that &quot;Brazil would now have the four years of Lula that we hoped for in his first term.&quot;

==Philanthropy==
Mercury has performed at a large number of charitable events. She is the second Brazilian honored as an ambassador for UNICEF (Renato Aragão was the first). She is also an ambassador for UNAIDS and UNESCO. She has performed at Rede Globo&#x27;s annual charity &quot;Criança Esperança&quot; for fifteen consecutive years (1992–2007). She also represents various non-profit organizations including Caravana da Musica which has spawned her own Instituto Sol da Liberdade.

<text>Dennis Rickman is a fictional character from the BBC soap opera &quot;EastEnders&quot;, played by Nigel Harman. He made his first appearance on 14 April 2003 at the funeral of his late mother, Paula, before going on to become one of the show&#x27;s central protagonists from 1 May 2003 up until his last appearance in the episode broadcast on 30 December 2005, when the character was fatally stabbed at the start of the New Year Fireworks.

He originally came to Walford - a fictional borough in East London - in 2003 as a new member of the Watts family who had a difficult past and rough childhood, though his identity was unknown for almost thirty years. Dennis soon became a regular presence in Walford&#x27;s market town Albert Square, and in the summer of that year he murdered his former gangland boss Jack Dalton (Hywel Bennett) after discovering that the latter was responsible for the apparent death of Dennis&#x27;s illegitimate father Den Watts (Leslie Grantham) in February 1989. Before he killed Dalton, however, Dennis discovered that Den had actually survived the shooting and - thanks to the help of his father&#x27;s old mistress Jan Hammond (Jane How) - partly contributed to Den&#x27;s eventual return in September 2003. The follow-up of Den&#x27;s comeback saw him and Dennis compete against each other in a longstanding conflict that eventually came to an end in 2005 when Den was ultimately killed off on the show&#x27;s twentieth anniversary episode dated 18 February 2005; Dennis later discovered his father&#x27;s fate on 29 August 2005, the same day he finally married his adopted sister Sharon (Letitia Dean) after the couple managed to repair their once-forbidden romance.

During his time on the show, Dennis established an intense feud with his alpha-male rival and the square&#x27;s undisputed top-dog kingpin Phil Mitchell (Steve McFadden) - also Sharon&#x27;s on-off boyfriend. He also bonded with his and Sharon&#x27;s half-sister Vicki Fowler (Scarlett Alice Johnson); formed a mutual friendship with Dalton&#x27;s right-hand mobster Andy Hunter (Michael Higgs); embarked on an initial relationship with his brief girlfriend Zoe Slater (Michelle Ryan); developed a warm companionship with local gossip Dot Cotton (June Brown); slept with his acquaintance Kate Morton (Jill Halfpenny) during her marriage prospects with Phil; instituted major interactions with Sharon&#x27;s family friend Pauline Fowler (Wendy Richard) along with fellow neighbour Pat Harris (Pam St Clement) and Zoe&#x27;s surrogate father Charlie (Derek Martin); temporarily clashed with Phil&#x27;s brother Grant (Ross Kemp) over the latter&#x27;s previous marriage with Sharon; and later teamed up with the Mitchell brothers, along with their mother Peggy Mitchell (Barbara Windsor) and cousin Billy (Perry Fenwick), to help their family bring Sharon&#x27;s stepmother Chrissie (Tracy-Ann Oberman) to justice for killing Den and framing Peggy&#x27;s daughter Sam (Kim Medcalf) for his murder.

In his exit storyline towards the climax of 2005, Dennis became enemies with the square&#x27;s reigning crime lord Johnny Allen (Billy Murray). This came to an unfortunate end when Dennis brutally attacked Johnny for threatening him and throttling Sharon into leaving Walford, as well as killing Andy on the night Den died earlier on. Subsequently, Johnny survived the attack and arranged for his henchman Danny Moon (Jake Maskall) to kill Dennis in retribution; Dennis was later stabbed on that night amid the New Year fireworks celebrating 2006 and he ultimately died in Sharon&#x27;s arms.

Nearly three months after the character&#x27;s death, Dennis became the posthumous catalyst for the Get Johnny Week storyline in which Phil and Grant sought to help Sharon avenge his death by bringing Johnny to justice; in the end, Dennis&#x27;s death was avenged when his killer Danny was shot dead by his brother Jake (Joel Beckett), while Johnny was forced by his daughter Ruby (Louisa Lytton) to surrender himself to the police after she discovered that her father was responsible for Dennis&#x27;s murder. Later on, Dennis&#x27;s death ends up getting avenged by Ruby&#x27;s boyfriend Sean Slater (Robert Kazinsky), when he causes Johnny to die of a heart attack, following the latter&#x27;s sentencing to life imprisonment for Dennis&#x27;s murder. Sharon later gave birth to her and Dennis&#x27;s son, Denny. In early January 2014, Sharon finally learned the truth about Dennis&#x27;s death from Phil, and the subject is raised again after Denny dies in February 2020, following a quarrel with the show&#x27;s protagonist Ian Beale (Adam Woodyatt) in the programme&#x27;s 35th anniversary special.

The character of Dennis Rickman quickly became established as the show&#x27;s leading man and a &quot;soap sex-symbol&quot;, with Harman noted for his &quot;dark good looks&quot; and &quot;fantastic&quot; physique. In 2003, Harman won the &quot;Best Newcomer&quot; award at the National Television Awards, and for two years straight (in 2004 and 2005) won both &quot;Best Actor&quot; and &quot;Sexiest Male&quot; categories at the British Soap Awards and Inside Soap Awards.

==Storylines==
Dennis Rickman makes his first appearance in handcuffs in April 2003, as he is on day release from prison to attend his mother&#x27;s funeral. It soon transpires that he was the product of a fling between his teenaged mother Paula, and her adult ex-lover Den Watts (Leslie Grantham). The discovery of his existence comes after Sharon discovers that she has a brother through her adoptive father Den Watts and another woman during the 1970s. Sharon was aware that her brother was called Dennis Rickman and that he too grew up in Walford. Charlie Slater (Derek Martin) informs her that there was a Mr. Rickman who lived locally and worked as a taxi driver, but he and his wife had both died and their daughter was living alone in their house. Sharon soon locates the house but learns from a neighbour that Paula has just died.

It is gradually revealed that he was neglected as a child by his mother and abused by a succession of her boyfriends, ultimately spending some time living in a children&#x27;s home. Den was unaware that he had a son, and by the time Dennis meets Sharon and Vicki, 14 years have passed since Den disappeared and supposedly died as a result of a shooting on a canal towpath.

Dennis first makes an impact in Walford in May 2003, when he floors Phil Mitchell (Steve McFadden) in a fight in the Queen Vic. This launches a rivalry with Phil, which a few months leads to a meeting between the pair in Phil&#x27;s garage, when several of Phil&#x27;s friends turn up and give Dennis a severe beating when Phil walks out. Dennis infuriates Phil by seducing his sister Sam Mitchell (Kim Medcalf), his wife-to-be Kate Morton (Jill Halfpenny) (who is a former flame of Dennis&#x27;s) and his daughter&#x27;s nanny Joanne Ryan (Tara Lynne O&#x27;Neill).

Dennis sees East End gangland lord Jack Dalton (Hywel Bennett) as a father figure as he worked for him since his teens, collecting debts amongst other things, and his prison stint is due to an act of GBH which was committed while working for Jack. After Dennis&#x27;s release, Jack orders Phil to kill Dennis after he becomes independent of him. However, Dennis ends up killing Jack in a shooting next to a railway line, but not before Jack reveals that Den survived the 1989 shooting, and that the body found in the canal a year later was in fact that of another local gangster who had been murdered on Dalton&#x27;s orders for failing to kill Den. Dennis later tracks down Den&#x27;s former mistress Jan Hammond (Jane How) and finds out that Den fled to Spain. He flies out to Spain and finds the address where Den is now believed to be living, but lacks the courage to knock on the door and find out. He later reveals all to Sharon, but she refuses to believe that her adoptive father is still alive.

The rivalry with Phil is concluded by Den himself when he returns from Spain in September 2003, confirming the theory which Dennis had uncovered two months earlier. Den and Dennis trick Phil into committing an armed robbery at a local factory. They then abscond with the escape ladder and most of the cash, though Den leaves Phil with a few stolen notes and a gun to incriminate him. The feud brings Dennis closer to his father. After killing Jack, Dennis remains friends with Dalton&#x27;s second-in-command Andy Hunter (Michael Higgs), and is left the bookmakers in Andy&#x27;s will after Andy&#x27;s death at the hands of Johnny Allen (Billy Murray) in February 2005. However, Andy&#x27;s death was believed to have been suicide at the time, which buys Johnny an extra year of freedom - as Dennis will find out to his cost.

Dennis has a passionate fling with Den&#x27;s adopted daughter Sharon Watts (Letitia Dean) on the eve of Den&#x27;s return but finds himself rejected when Den re-establishes himself on the Walford scene. They resume their affair in secret but Den cannot accept a relationship between his children and plots to split them up. Den taunts Dennis with the suggestion that someone had sexually abused him while he was in a children&#x27;s home, successfully provoking Dennis into accidentally hitting Sharon. A guilt-ridden Den later apologises and explains his reasons for not wanting his son and daughter together, because he wants both of them in his life and he cannot have that if they are sleeping together. Den then tries to explain to Dennis that his feelings for Sharon are simply misguided due to the abuse he supposedly suffered as a child, which leaves Dennis confused and so he decides to break up with Sharon in the hope of having a proper father-son relationship.

Meanwhile, the Watts family reform their strong bond, which includes the introduction of Den&#x27;s new wife Chrissie Watts (Tracy-Ann Oberman), who follows him back to England from Spain a few months after his return to Walford. Dennis moves in with Zoe Slater (Michelle Ryan) but cannot reciprocate her love and Sharon seduces him again. They continue their affair in secret behind Zoe and Den&#x27;s backs, and feel unable to continue their secretive relationship, and plan to leave on Christmas Day.

However, Den had spotted them kissing on Christmas Eve. When they announce that they are in love and going to America together on Christmas Day, Zoe announces that she is pregnant. Dennis does not want to be an absent father to the baby, so Sharon leaves without him. He stays with Zoe but refuses to sleep with her. Zoe, who has feigned the pregnancy in order to prevent Dennis from leaving. She is desperate to get pregnant for real and resorts to sleeping with Den, who had told her to feign the pregnancy in his own attempt to split Sharon from Dennis.

Dennis eventually begins to feel love for Zoe and looks forward to a life with her and the baby. However, when Dennis catches her and Den in bed and discovers she was never pregnant at all, he leaves but not before informing Chrissie about her and Den.
Dennis and Sharon return to Walford in the summer of 2005, and demand to see Den. Dennis has his doubts about Chrissie&#x27;s story that Den had left her a few months before in favour of another woman, but drops the matter to spare Sharon&#x27;s feelings. Dennis and Sharon go on to marry soon afterwards, and following this, they learn that Sam Mitchell had exhumed their father&#x27;s body from his grave in the cellar of The Queen Victoria public house. Den had been murdered by Chrissie in February 2005 after she, Zoe and Sam confronted him about his manipulation and lies regarding the three of them - which had started just before Christmas 2004, when Den had tricked Sam into selling him The Queen Vic with the pretence that Phil needed money while still on the run from the police. Chrissie had also lured Sharon back to overhear Den&#x27;s confessions so that Den would lose the one person in his life that he truly loved - which she achieved when Sharon disowned Den and left Walford again. Den had then walked back into the pub and attacked Chrissie before Zoe hit him with a doorstop and supposedly killed him. Den then regained consciousness and grabbed Chrissie, who delivered a fatal blow, but left Zoe to believe she had killed him. The three women then buried his body in the basement, with Chrissie being able to avoid suspicion for the next few months by inventing a story that Den had left her for another woman. With the help of Phil and his brother Grant, Dennis and Sharon soon bring Chrissie to justice and sell The Queen Vic back to the Mitchells, apparently concluding the lengthy feud between the Watts and Mitchell families. Having stayed away from his funeral, Dennis later visits Den&#x27;s grave and tearfully mourns the father he never had.
On Christmas Day 2005, Sharon is admitted to hospital with suspected food poisoning, but finds out she is pregnant, despite the previous belief that she was infertile following an abortion 10 years earlier. After Dennis interferes with Johnny and condemns his treatment of his teenage daughter Ruby, Johnny attacks Sharon, but upon finding out she is pregnant, he relents and tells Sharon that if she and Dennis are gone by midnight on New Year&#x27;s Eve, he would not kill Dennis. He also admits that he murdered Andy Hunter nearly a year earlier.

After much insistence from Sharon, they prepare to leave on New Year&#x27;s Eve to start a new life in the United States. Sharon does not tell Dennis that Johnny has threatened to kill him, but she confides in Phil, who then uses Dennis as a weapon against Johnny, who is also an enemy of his. Phil tells Dennis about Johnny threatening Sharon, and also that Johnny had murdered his friend Andy. Although Dennis knows what Phil is doing, he takes the bait anyway and beats Johnny to the brink of death. Johnny begs for help as he fears he is dying, so Dennis tosses him a mobile phone and says if he can reach it, he will live. Johnny is able to reach the phone and instead of calling for medical assistance, he contacts a henchman to murder Dennis as revenge for his beating.

After cleaning his hands of Johnny&#x27;s blood, Dennis makes his way towards the Albert Square gardens, where the locals are setting up fireworks ready to welcome in 2006. As he and Sharon lock eyes, Dennis is stabbed in the chest by a mysterious passer-by and collapses. He dies in Sharon&#x27;s arms seconds into the new year. His last words are &quot;we did it&quot; in reference to their unborn son, who is born six months later and named Dennis &quot;Denny&quot; in honour of his father. It is later revealed that Dennis was stabbed by Johnny&#x27;s henchman Danny Moon (Jake Maskall) on the night of his murder. Towards the end of March 2006, Phil and Grant confront Johnny in their bid to get justice for Sharon by avenging Dennis&#x27;s death. The brothers are nearly killed when Johnny captures the two and orders Danny to kill them, but Phil and Grant are saved when Danny is shot dead by his brother Jake (Joel Beckett), who merely attempted to stop Danny, thus partly avenging Dennis&#x27;s death in the process. As Phil and Grant use this opportunity to race back to Johnny&#x27;s house, Ruby learns that her father is responsible for Dennis&#x27;s murder and calls the police about her father&#x27;s actions, threatening to disown him unless he turns himself in. Johnny ultimately relents at his daughter&#x27;s urging and when the police arrive, he admits to murdering killing Andy and ordering the murder of Dennis, along with his other criminal activities. Seven months later, Johnny dies in hospital after suffering a heart attack in prison, which struck him down when he was attempting to order the death of Ruby&#x27;s boyfriend Sean Slater (Robert Kazinsky), upon discovering his plan to extract their assets, the result of which ultimately avenges Dennis&#x27;s death. This plan, however, fails to materialise and Sean escapes intact.

In October 2012, soon after Sharon returns to Walford with a six-year-old Denny in tow, Phil&#x27;s latest enemy, Derek Branning (Jamie Foreman), mentions that Dennis was murdered, not knowing that Sharon&#x27;s six-year-old son overheard him. Denny is upset after learning the truth of his father&#x27;s death, as he was told by Sharon that his father was a helicopter pilot and died while saving others. Sharon admits to her son that she lied to protect him, and although he is angry, he eventually forgives her. In January 2014, Phil finally confesses to Sharon that he had played a part in Dennis&#x27;s death - having goaded him into attacking the man who went on to order his death - as Phil&#x27;s conflict with Johnny ultimately led to Dennis being murdered. Sharon is furious, but then goes to visit Dennis&#x27;s grave for the last time. It is at that point that Sharon realises she needs to leave Dennis in her past, as Phil is now her future. Months later, Sharon marries Phil and he later adopts Denny in the subsequent years. However, over five years later, on Christmas Day 2019, they end up splitting, after Phil discovers that Sharon had an affair with his daughter&#x27;s fiancé, Keanu Taylor (Danny Walters). Soon afterwards, Phil seeks revenge on Keanu and they end up fighting each other in a boat on the River Thames, which ends up crashing as a result. Denny is among the passengers on the boat, and, although everyone else survives the crash, he consequently loses his life after suffering a cardiac arrest from drowning in the ensuing carnage.

==Creation and development==
===Introduction===
Dennis Rickman was created by the show&#x27;s producers as the successor to the character of Steve Owen, who had bowed out during the previous year. It was also part of a move to bring the Watts family back to the forefront of &quot;EastEnders&quot;, with the re-introduction of Vicki Fowler occurring at the beginning of 2003, and the highly anticipated return of Den Watts in September. Executive producer Louise Berridge was also keen to rectify what she felt was a gender imbalance in the cast, commenting after his arrival that Dennis had &quot;provided a surge of testosterone in a show that was rather female-heavy since the arrival of the Slaters.&quot;

===Casting===
Harman was working as a lorry driver for supermarket chain Sainsbury&#x27;s when he was cast in the role of Dennis Rickman: &quot;They said: &#x27;You&#x27;ve got the job.&#x27; I was sitting there in my Sainsbury&#x27;s fleece, with Mrs Bloggs&#x27;s groceries in the back, and I just laughed my arse off.&quot; However, Harman revealed in a 2003 interview that he actually auditioned for a character called &quot;Tim&quot;, and had no idea that he was set to join the Watts family as the unknown son of the soap&#x27;s most &quot;iconic&quot; figure, Den Watts. Part of Harman&#x27;s appeal lay in his dark good looks and appealing physicality. &quot;EastEnders&quot; executive producer Louise Berridge noted: &quot;We cast Nigel for his tremendous acting ability and his screen presence, but there&#x27;s no question he&#x27;s also a very sexy young man.&quot; In an interview with &quot;The Independent&quot; in 2003 he commented on his character&#x27;s status as a sex symbol: &quot;It&#x27;s Dennis, not me... I am a bit embarrassed... I don&#x27;t get off on it. I walk into the living-room in the morning in my jogging pants, with my hair all over the place, and my flatmates say: &#x27;So, you&#x27;re supposed to be one of the sexiest men in the country?&#x27; And I go: &#x27;I know. I don&#x27;t get it either.&#x27;&quot;

===Characterisation===
Dennis is characterized by his roguish manner, a &quot;bad boy&quot; cast in the mould of a &quot;young Dirty Den&quot;. Harman described his character as &quot;a bit of a rough diamond&quot; but with &quot;a sensitive side&quot;. During his time on the show, Dennis often butted heads with various alpha-males, including hardman Phil Mitchell (Steve McFadden) and crime boss Johnny Allen (Billy Murray), but was friends with mobster Andy Hunter (Michael Higgs) and developed a warm relationship with local gossip, Dot Cotton (June Brown).

The representation of Dennis as &quot;smouldering thug&quot; was apparent from his first appearance in Walford, when he hit resident top dog Phil Mitchell. In an interview with the &quot;Daily Mirror&quot; Harman declared, &quot;He is a total bastard and if I met him in real life, I&#x27;d be bloody scared. [But] that&#x27;s why he&#x27;s such a brilliant part.&quot; According to the official &quot;EastEnders&quot; website, &quot;Dennis may well be able to turn on the charm with the ladies, but he has a certain sinister edge.&quot;

==Reception==
Dennis Rickman was described in a 2004 article as the show&#x27;s &quot;bad boy pin-up character&quot;. The character of Dennis Rickman quickly became established as the show&#x27;s leading man and a &quot;soap sex-symbol&quot;, with Harman noted for his &quot;dark good looks&quot; and &quot;fantastic&quot; physique. In 2003, Harman won the &quot;Best Newcomer&quot; award at the National Television Awards, and for two years straight (in 2004 and 2005) won both &quot;Best Actor&quot; and &quot;Sexiest Male&quot; categories at the British Soap Awards and &quot;Inside Soap&quot; Awards.

In 2020, Sara Wallis and Ian Hyland from The &quot;Daily Mirror&quot; placed Dennis 58th on their ranked list of the best &quot;EastEnders&quot; characters of all time, calling him a &quot;bed-hopping criminal&quot; who was &quot;a chip off the old block&quot; from his father.

<text>Prestel was the brand name of a videotex service launched in the UK in 1979 by Post Office Telecommunications, a division of the British Post Office. It had around 95,500 attached terminals at its peak, and was a forerunner of the internet-based online services developed in the late 20th and early 21st centuries. Prestel was discontinued in 1994 and its assets sold by British Telecom to a company consortium. 

A subscriber to Prestel used an adapted TV set with a keypad or keyboard, a dedicated terminal, or a microcomputer to interact with a central database via an ordinary phoneline. Prestel offered hundreds of thousands of pages of general and specialised information, ranging from consumer advice to financial data, as well as services such as home banking, online shopping, travel booking, telesoftware, and messaging.

In September 1982, to mark Information Technology Year, the Royal Mail issued two commemorative stamps, one of which featured a Prestel TV set and keyboard.
In April 1984, British Telecom won a Queen&#x27;s Award for Technological Achievement for the development of Prestel.

==History==
===Invention and development===
In 1970, Samuel Fedida, a research engineer who had worked at English Electric and a US consultancy company, joined the Post Office as head of the Computer Applications Research Division. Within a year, he had completed the initial design of a viewdata system (the generic term in use at the time) for the general public: it would comprise information stored on a central computer accessed over the public phone network using modified televisions as terminals. By early 1973, the Post Office had decided to develop an experimental system, and was working with the BBC, the Independent Broadcasting Authority, and standards organisations to develop compatible standards for teletext and viewdata. During 1974, it decided to commercialise the viewdata concept.

===Pilot trial===
The first public demonstration of viewdata took place in London in 1975 during Eurocomp, the European Computing Conference on Communications Networks, where Fedida presented a paper on the technology and the potential appeal, as the Post Office saw it, of a public interactive information service.

Further demonstrations followed, and based on the favourable reactions of TV manufacturers and potential providers of information and services, the Post Office decided to run a pilot trial. It also agreed with potential information providers (IPs) that it would not select IPs or exert editorial control over what they put on the system.

The two-year pilot service began in January 1976. By mid-1977, IPs included the Consumers&#x27; Association, the British Farm Produce Council, British Rail, London Transport, the Open University, the London Stock Exchange, the Institute for Scientific Information, and National Giro. Interviewed by &quot;The Times&quot;, Fedida was quoted as saying that the Post Office saw viewdata playing several roles: as a &quot;centralised information source&quot;, an &quot;intelligent interface&quot; to specialised scientific and technical data, a &quot;communication machine&quot; for passing messages, a personal information store, a new information distribution medium, a &quot;channel for education in the home&quot;, and as providing an &quot;advanced calculator service&quot;.

===Test service===
After some delay, the Post Office launched a test service of Prestel, as it was now called, in October 1978. At the end of December, there were 95,500 information pages, growing at a rate of 3,500 per week, and just over 300 users, increasing by 3050 per week.

===Commercial launch===

In March 1979, the Post Office opened a limited &quot;London Residential Service&quot; for subscribers in the capital. The full commercial service launched in September 1979; the director of Prestel stated that there were over 130,000 pages in the database and 1363 &quot;sets&quot; connected to the system at the start of that month.

By February 1980, there were 131 IPs and 116 sub-IPs. The Post Office categorised the IPs as follows: national and local newspaper groups; magazine and other publishing groups; central government departments, and other agencies (such as the British Tourist Authority and the British Library); nationalised industries (including British Airways, Sealink, and British Rail), and companies in other fields of business, such as banks and travel agencies; new companies set up to exploit the viewdata medium, and those expanding from an existing base of online services, such as Reuters; associations; software companies; and miscellaneous.

Particularly popular were the travel-oriented nationalised industries; new companies, such as Fintel; and the Consumers&#x27; Association. Overall, popular topics included games, quizzes, jokes, and horoscopes; the Stock Market, company information, and business news; travel and holiday information; national news, sports, and &quot;What&#x27;s On&quot; locally; cars; and consumer advice. This was reflected in advertisements for Prestel.

Writing in the winter 1980/81 issue of &quot;British Telecom Journal&quot;, Prestel&#x27;s public relations manager stated there were over 7,500 sets attached to the system, 170,000 frames in use, and more than 400 IPs and sub-IPs. By the end of 1981, according to Butler Cox, a management consultancy, Prestel had 2,000 residential and 11,000 business users, with 14,000 &quot;terminals&quot; in use. The service was within local call reach of 62% of phone subscribers in Britain. IPs numbered 153, with 593 sub-IPs. Users accessed 190,000 frames per day, and the average time on the system, for each user per day, was 9 minutes. There were 193,000 frames available, including 2,000 response frames. 

====Prestel Gateway====
March 1982 saw the launch of the Prestel Gateway service. This enabled users to connect, via the Prestel network, to external computers operated by IPs or other companies. Travel agents, for example, used Gateway to connect to tour operators&#x27; systems and make reservations.

====User charges====
At the launch of the commercial service in September 1979, and in addition to phone charges, users were charged 3p per minute online to Prestel from 8 am to 6 pm Monday to Friday, and 3p for three minutes at other times. Installing a jack cost £13, with a quarterly rental of 50p. Business users paid an additional standing charge (i.e., a flat charge regardless of usage) of £12 per quarter.

By October 1982, the online usage charge had risen to 5p per minute (8 am to 6 pm Monday to Friday and also 8 am to 1 pm on Saturdays, free at other times), the business standing charge to £15 per quarter, residential users now paid £5 per quarter, and jack installation cost &quot;from £15&quot;, with a 15p quarterly rental fee.

===Growth===
From September 1986, under page *656#, Prestel&#x27;s publicity department published a &quot;Factframe&quot; showing, at the end of each month, the average number of terminals attached and the respective percentages in businesses and in homes; the number of frames available and the number of frame accesses per week; and the number of messages sent per week. Actual subscriber figures were not published; Thomas et al. (1992) suggest these were &quot;significantly less&quot; than the number of terminals, as &quot;businesses were assumed to &#x27;attach&#x27; more than one terminal&quot;, and note that British Telecom stopped publishing figures at the end of 1988.

In September 1982, &quot;The Times&quot; reported there were 18,000 users, of whom 3,000 were residential. Noting that British Telecom had originally forecast 50,000 users at this point, the report went on to outline a new approach to attracting them, quoting senior managers from British Telecom and the head of a joint venture. The plans involved the introduction of a home banking service; the marketing of a Prestel adaptor for computer terminals to the business and higher education sectors; and the launch of Micronet 800, a service for microcomputer users. 

Six months later, in February 1983, the same newspaper recorded 22,400 users, of whom 15% were residential, writing that the future of Prestel &quot;could be in doubt by 1985 if it is not approaching profitability.&quot;

In mid-1984, the UK Department of Trade and Industry issued a booklet stating that the availability of travel information, the launch of Micronet 800, and the provision nationwide of the messaging service, Mailbox, had contributed to a rise to 45,000 attached terminals by June of that year. 61% were in businesses, and 39% in homes. In that month, on average, the Prestel database contained 320,000 frames that were accessed 14.6 million times. 17 Prestel Gateways to external computers were in operation. For July, the Butler Cox consultancy recorded 47,000 users (60% business, 40% residential), and a total of 1,200 IPs and sub-IPs.

After another year, in mid-1985, &quot;The Times&quot; stated there were 53,000 &quot;terminals, adapted televisions, microcomputers or specially designed units&quot; attached to Prestel, with residential users now accounting for 45% of the total. In the reporter&#x27;s view, this represented &quot;a change of fortune for [a service] deemed commercially dubious by many commentators.&quot; The figure of 65,000 was reached at the beginning of 1986about a third were Micronet 800 subscribers. Prestel had reportedly traded at a profit from the previous October onwards. Commenting in September 1986 on what it referred to as &quot;only 70,000 users ... growing at a rate of ... a few hundred customers a week&quot;, &quot;The Times&quot; declared that Prestel &quot;had failed to live up to expectations&quot;, comparing it unfavourably to the French Minitel videotex service and to British Telecom&#x27;s own Telecom Gold electronic mail service.

Writing in the &quot;The Guardian&quot; just before Christmas 1988, Jack Schofield reported that Prestel &quot;had become reclusive&quot; about user numbers, with the Factframe, &quot;[a]fter prompting, ... finally updated this summer ... claim[ing] 90,000 users&quot;, while the figure of &quot;only 75,000&quot; was being quoted by the British Telecom manager responsible for the service. In January 1989, drawing on what turned out to be the final Factframe, published at the end of 1988, Schofield wrote that &quot;After ten years, [Prestel] has yet to achieve the number of users it expected to get in its first year&quot;, quoting a figure of 95,460 terminals attached. This was the highest figure claimed during the lifetime of Prestel.

===Decline===
In October 1991, British Telecom closed Micronet 800, stating, in a letter to customers, that &quot;With over 10,000 members, Micronet is easily the largest online service in the UK specialising in microcomputing. However, it is still not large enough to enable us to maintain a cost-effective service and provide the extra facilities requested by our customers.&quot; Membership had decreased from a peak of around 20,000. &quot;The Guardian&quot; attributed this to the introduction by British Telecom of an off-peak Prestel time-charge in mid-1988, discouraging the use of Micronet&#x27;s popular &quot;Chatline&quot; service. &quot;The Times&quot; agreed, and also pointed to a steep rise in subscription charges, opining that &quot;BT&#x27;s failure to provide even this committed group with an economic ... service means that Prestel is destined ... for businesses.&quot; The closure in April 1991 of Homelink, the home banking service launched in 1983 by the Nottingham Building Society, also contributed to shrinking the number of Prestel subscribers.

During 1991, Prestel was closed to residential users. Towards the end of 1993, it was reported that British Telecom was planning to close Prestel altogether: according to the company, of the around 35,000 subscribers at that point, only some 2,500 used the service regularly.

===Closure===
British Telecom closed Prestel in early 1994, selling it to a consortium. It was rebranded as &quot;New Prestel&quot;, focusing on the provision of financial data to businesses. In mid-1996, New Prestel transferred to the Web, becoming the Internet service provider (ISP) &quot;Prestel On-line&quot;

In 1999, the financial data component of Prestel On-line was bought by the company Financial Express to become &quot;Financial Express Prestel&quot;. The service component merged with the ISP Demon Internet, which ran a &quot;Prestel Internet Service&quot;. This closed in 2002.

===Analyses===
Writing in early 1979 about the test service that had launched in October 1978, a Post Office executive concluded that:

In the aftermath of Prestel&#x27;s pivot away, in the early 1980s, from a focus on the general public to targeting the business community, the professions, and microcomputing enthusiasts, Noll (1985) studied the possible reasons for Prestel&#x27;s lack of take-up by households. He concluded that the following factors might have been significant: a shortage, at the beginning of the commercial service, of affordable Prestel-adapted TV sets and, later, adaptors; relatively high frame-access and time-based online charges; the large size of the database, and the difficulty of searching it; and the variation in how information providers (IPs) arranged and presented their Prestel pages.

Noll contrasted the &quot;relative failure&quot; of Prestel with the &quot;success&quot; of teletext, noting that receiving the latter was free and its database much smaller. Overall, he questioned &quot;the [...] hypothesis that the information needs of consumers can be satisfied by a large, centralized, computerized database of general-interest information.&quot;

After consulting a group of experts in the videotex domain, the information scientists Grover &amp; Sabherwal drew conclusions (1989) that largely concurred with Noll&#x27;s. In addition, they judged that government subsidies were required to boost public interest and mass take-up. This latter view was also held by Mosco, a political economist, who wrote in 1982: &quot;[T]he British government appears to be prepared to let Prestel sink or swim on its own commercial ability ... It is too early to offer a complete assessment of Prestel. However, the direction of development is clear: the need for immediate commercial success means cutting back on earlier mass marketing efforts and an emphasis on specific business uses.&quot;

In a paper published shortly after Prestel had been discontinued in 1994, Case, an information scientist, examined the motivations behind the development of this and other videotex services from a sociological perspective. In his view, &quot;[E]xplanations of videotex require consideration of higher-level phenomena [such] as policy, ideology, belief, and vision&quot;. He identified the envisioning of videotex as a facilitator of mass participation in an emerging information societya belief held and promoted by many politicians, futurists, sociologists, and business leaders in the 1960s and 1970sas a crucial spur to the development of the technology, sustained investment, and the roll-out of services. This vision was animated, according to communications technology researchers Harmeet &amp; Sandvig&#x27;s summary (2006) of scholarly views, by the &quot;converging agendas of myriad players ... all seeking to increase revenues in otherwise saturated markets&quot;: phone companies (increased network traffic), set and terminal manufacturers (more sales), newspapers and news agencies (additional outlets for content), and business sectors such as banks and the travel trade (looking to reduce transaction costs).
Regarding Prestel, Case summarised the problems it faced (as described by a former chief executive) as the lack of a trigger service, low-quality information, complicated charges, competing services, and uncoordinated marketing by IPs, British Telecom, and terminal and adaptor providers. Insufficient market research into &quot;what sorts of information people actually use, and what delivery modes are appropriate for them&quot; was identified by public policy researchers Thomas &amp; Miles (1989) as a further reason why Prestel failed to live up to expectations.

Poor, a communications researcher, suggested (2006) that the failure of Prestel to achieve significant mass-market take-up was linked to its &quot;highly centralized and closed&quot; nature. He cited the control over content exercised by IPs and the system operator, British Telecom, coupled with a lack of to both non-videotex online services and other videotex services based on different technical standards. On standards, Poor (2004) believed that &quot;A universal videotex standard would have been like the common gauge for railroad, or common standards for the telegraph or the telephone. Disparate systems could connect, and enjoy network externalities due to scale.&quot;

==Database==
===Pages and frames===
====Numbering====
Information on Prestel was held in a database of &quot;pages&quot;. Each page corresponded to a screenful of information, and had a unique number up to nine digits long.

A page could have up to 26 sub-pages, with each sub-page labelled with a letter from &quot;a&quot; to &quot;z&quot;. A sub-page was called a &quot;frame&quot;: the page itself was frame &quot;a&quot;. Neither pages nor frames could scroll.

Each IP rented a three-digit number as its master page. For example, the Meteorological Office&#x27;s was 209, and the numbers identifying all its pages began with these digits such as for 20971, the page for &quot;Aviation forecasts&quot;. 

Single- and double-digit pages were reserved by Prestel for system information purposes, such as page 1, which showed the main index. Pages starting with 9 were for account and other system management functions: page 92, for example, showed details of a Prestel user&#x27;s bill.

====Types====
Most frames were set up to provide information. Other types were for messaging, or provided a gateway to services on other computers. A &quot;follow-on&quot; type caused the next frame in sequence to be automatically displayed as soon as the current frame had filled the screen.

By embedding cursor-control characters in the page, simple animations could be produced by rewriting parts of the screen already displayed. These were known as &quot;dynamic frames&quot;. Combined with the follow-on attribute, this provided a way to continue animations that could not fit within the number of characters available in a single frame.

This follow-on frame attribute was also used for telesoftware, enabling computer programs, such as those for the BBC Micro, to be downloaded from Prestel.

====Layout, design, and writing for Prestel====
Each frame had 24 lines of 40 characters each, and as in the format used by the Ceefax and ORACLE teletext services, could contain a maximum of 960 characters. The bottom line was reserved for system messages, leaving 920 characters for the Information Provider (IP). The top line, showing the name or logo of the IP, the page number, and the price, occupied at least 43 characters, depending on the design of the logo. This left 22 lines and a maximum 877 characters available for the IP to present information to the user. 

When preparing and editing a page, an IP could use upper- and lower-case letters, digits, punctuation marks, a few arithmetic symbols, and a set of &quot;mosaic characters&quot; for composing rudimentary graphics. The appearance of a character could be changed using a display-attribute code. These modified the appearance of subsequent characters on the same row of the screen, and themselves occupied one character position, which was displayed as a space.

In early 1978, at the end of the pilot trial, Post Office Telecommunications commissioned a study of the content and function of Prestel and how these aspects related to the graphic design of Prestel pages. Several graphics designers were consulted (including the designer of Prestel&#x27;s logo and its index and system pages), along with professional writers, journalists, media specialists, and database managers.

On graphic design, the main conclusions reached were to encourage IPs to use only a few colours on each page; to take into account the variety of TV sets and other terminals in use (colour or monochrome, different screen sizes, a range of serif or sans-serif typefaces); and to accommodate users with poor sight or colour blindness. Building on the study&#x27;s results and the outcomes of other research, Reynolds (1979) made recommendations for presenting text, tables, indexes and graphics in Prestel-type videotex systems and in teletext.

On writing for Prestel, the main finding of the study was to never undertake the composition and editing of content without considering the physical and technical limitations of the Prestel page and the overall structure of the information of which it formed a part. On style, the study&#x27;s report highlighted the views of the writer and academic Raymond Williams: &quot;The English sentence is a very flexible animal, and we all know what happened to it with the invention of printing. We shouldn&#x27;t feel confined by it in Prestel.&quot;

Surveying how Prestel&#x27;s content had developed a year or so after its commercial launch, Rex Winsbury, a media journalist and editorial director of Fintel, a major IP, wrote:

===Links===
A page could be directly linked to up to ten other pages by specifying, during editing, the number of the page whose content would be displayed when a user pressed a digit from 0 to 9 on their keypad or keyboard. Double-digit linkssuch as &quot;56&quot;were achieved by linking the first digit to an intermediate, stepping-stone frame on the IP&#x27;s database: this, in turn, connected the second digit to the target page.

The content of pages ranged between two poles: at one, a menu listing the topics available and the number to key to reach them, with no, or minimal, further informationreferred to as an &quot;index page&quot;; and at the other, a screenful of information with few, if any, links to other pagesan &quot;information page&quot;. According to Rex Winsbury, as experience with the viewdata medium grew, IPs &quot;gave information on all or most pages, simply varying the amount according to the number of routings [links] that have to be given as well.&quot;

===Structures===
When the public Prestel service began in 1979, a user connecting to the system was presented with the main index page. As they made and keyed successive menu choices, they moved down a subject hierarchy, from the general to the specific, to finish with the information page they sought. The Post Office, academics, and the media referred to this hierarchical database arrangement as a tree structure or &quot;inverted tree&quot;.
Though simple in theory, in practice this structure could lead a user to a dead end: they might find that how a subject was described in a menu did not match what they saw on the final destination page, or formed only part of what they were looking for, or provided information without the means to look up related material. Going back through the sequence of menu choices (using the *# command) to try another series of links was limited to three steps in all. 

As Prestel developed, IPs accommodated the particularities of the different types of information and services they provided, and the expectations of their users, through the extensive use of backlinks and crosslinks between their pages. This resulted in a variety of database structures that acquired labels such as cartwheels, ring-of-rings, Chinese lanterns and lobster-pots to help visualise how pages were connected.

===Navigation and search===
There were three basic navigation commands:
* *number# took the user directly to the first frame of the page number specified: for example, *5052# displayed the contents of 5052a onscreen; 
* # moved the user successively forward through the frames: 5052b, 5052c, and so on; 
* *# returned the user to the previous page in strict sequence, and could be repeated three times.

Keyword access was introduced in 1987, with *keyword# taking the user directly to the subject (or subject index) specified.

A topic index, updated daily, was published on page 199, and an IP index on page 198. A printed AZ &quot;Start-Up Directory&quot; of the topics available on Prestel, with the appropriate page number to key, was sent to new users. From 1987, the topic names could also be used as keywords. Micronet 800, an IP, visualised the relationships between its pages in a London Tube-style schematic map as part of a guide for users.
From 1983 to mid-1987, &quot;The Prestel Directory&quot;, a quarterly magazine, was distributed free to all Prestel users and also available on subscription: it contained a user guide and subject index, a list of IPs and sub-IPs, feature articles, and videotex product news. This was superseded by &quot;Connexions&quot;, sent to users every two months till May 1988. A directory was also incorporated into the quarterly &quot;Prestel Business Directory&quot; published by the &quot;Financial Times&quot; from 1979.

From January 1986, Prestel published &quot;Focus&quot; magazine on page 123 &quot;to show you the most useful, entertaining and topical pages from the thousands available.&quot; It spotlighted news, sport, weather, and entertainment information on a daily basis, and included weekly features.

==Information providers==
There were two types of information provider (IP): main IPs, and sub-IPs.
===Charges===
====Page rental====
A main IP rented pages from the Post Office (initially) or British Telecom (later), and controlled a three-digit master-page in the database. In 1982, this cost an annual £5,500 for a basic package, equivalent to around £29,000 in 2021.

The basic package included 100 frames; the ability to enter and amend information, retrieve response frames, and store 10 completed response frames; staff training in editing (a two-day seminar), and a copy of the IP editing manual; and, if required, bulk update facilities and an annual print-out of frames in use. Additional frames were available, in batches of 500, for £500 a year (over £2,600 in 2021), while using &quot;Closed User Groups&quot; (CUGs) and the sub-IP facility each cost £250 annually (over £1,300 in 2021). 

Sub-IPsthose with smaller requirements or budgetrented pages from a main IP. A main IP could rent out pages at the market rate. Such IPs were known as &quot;umbrella&quot; IPs. Sub-IPs paid a per-minute charge for editing online: in 1982, this was 8p per minute from Monday to Friday between 8 am and 6 pm, and 8p per four-minute block at all other times Sub-IPs had a four-digit (or more) master-page within a main IP&#x27;s area. Generally speaking, they could only edit existing pages, and were not able to create or delete them.

====Gateway====
The cost to an IP of connecting an external computer to the Prestel system varied according to the number of simultaneous users required, the distance between Prestel and the IP&#x27;s computer, and whether the connection was made using a private line or via the PSS packet-switched network. There were also time and data-volume charges. Other factors to be taken into account included the traffic pattern (i.e., the expected volume and frequency of ), the response time required (as perceived by a user), the size of the database to be accessed, and the changeability of the information stored.

In 1985, British Telecom estimated that for an IP using a typical minicomputer (such as the PDP-11) located 100 km from London and handling up to 10 users simultaneously at peak times, the one-off software set-up cost would be at least £16,000, communication costs would range from £4,280 to £5,550 a year (depending on the type of connection), and Prestel usage would cost £8,600 a year.

===Relationships===
Several typical relationships developed between umbrella IPs and their sub-IP clients. A sub-IP could be:
* An independent supplier of information, with exclusive or partial editorial control and full or partial editing rights.
* An organisation making information available to an IP, sometimes on a royalty basis.
* An organisation advertising on an IP&#x27;s pages.
* An individual authoring articles or columns for an IP, usually on a royalty basis.

In addition, the IP Micronet 800 used the sub-IP facility to offer the &quot;Gallery&quot; service, where a group, club, or individual could rent one or a number of frames cheaply, and for short periods if required.

An analysis in 1981 of the pros and cons of using an umbrella IP to publish information on Prestel concluded that if the owner of the information needed less than 500 frames, it would be cheaper to use an umbrella IP, but if over 5000, this would be more expensive than doing it themselves. In between these two figures, speed, convenience, and the need for design skills favoured using an IP, while going it alone assured confidentiality and provided more control.

===Editing pages===

There were two ways to edit pages: directly, by creating or amending them using special editing keyboards while connected online to the main Update Computer; or offline, creating pages locally and uploading them in bulk. Bulk update required that pages be created offline using editing terminals that could store pages, or by using microcomputers. The pages were then either transmitted to the Update Computer online as a batch via a special dialup port and protocol, or sent on magnetic tape to the Update Centre (UDC), where they were uploaded.

Using the online editor, IPs were also able to view information about a page hidden from ordinary users, such as the time and date of its last update, whether the frame was in a Closed User Group (CUG), the price-to-view (if any), and the &quot;frame count&quot;the number of times the frame had been accessed.

IPs and sub-IPs accessed the Edit computer using their normal ID and password, but had a separate password to access the editing facility. Bulk uploads only required the edit password and the IP&#x27;s account number.

==Information and services==
Prestel&#x27;s pre-launch promotional material focused on the general public: When the service launched in late 1979, Post Office Telecommunications had a hands-off approach towards managing whatever IPs placed on the system. This changed in early 1980, when British Telecom (its successor) started targeting the business, professional and hobbyist markets via joint ventures with companies and organisations with specialised expertise. 

By the mid-1980s, the specialised services on Prestel included:
*&quot;Prestel CitiService&quot;, involving the London Stock Exchange and ICV Information Systems, targeted three groups: the business community as a whole, with mainly company information; private investors in a closed user group, offering regularly updated share prices; and for brokers and other investment professionals, continuously updated share prices, also in a closed user group.

*&quot;British Telecom Travel Service&quot; provided travel agents with information from tour operators, airlines, and other transport operators, and enabled online reservations. Services for other users included flight arrivals and departures, car rental, and exchange rates.

*&quot;Prestel Farmlink&quot; packaged information for farmers from the Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food, the Meat and Livestock Commission, the Meteorological Office, and others. A link to Prestel CitiService provided farm commodity prices, and farmers could calculate, online, weekly wages and the formulation of feedstuffs.

*Banking: the Nottingham Building Society offered Homelink, and the Bank of Scotland HOBS, the Home &amp; Office Banking Service. Subscribers were provided with free or subsidised Prestel terminals.
*&quot;Prestel Microcomputing&quot; offered downloadable software (telesoftware), noticeboards, newsletters, and reviews. It incorporated Micronet 800 from EMAP, Viewfax 258, and Clubspot 810.

*&quot;Prestel Education&quot; targeted schools and colleges, and provided course and careers advice, educational software, and help with using computers.

*&quot;British Telecom Insurance Services&quot; provided financial information to insurance intermediaries and enabled them to get online quotes from major insurance companies.

*&quot;Prestel Teleshopping&quot; was a specialised e-commerce service for the residential market, and involved Littlewoods, Grattan, and Kays Catalogues, among others.

*&quot;Prestel for Medical Practitioners&quot; packaged material from bodies such as the Royal College of General Practitioners, the British Medical Association, and the Department of Health and Social Security with drug data from pharmaceutical companies, information on locum vacancies, conference and training diaries, and research news.

==Messaging==

===Response frames===
A &quot;response frame&quot; enabled a user to send a message to an IP using a preformatted page to order goods or services or to transmit data. The user&#x27;s name and other information needed (such as their address) were automatically added to the frame from their Prestel account details. 

Initially, response frames had to be collected by an IP from each IRC in turn; later, they were ingathered at the UDC, where the IP concerned could retrieve them. Eventually, with the introduction of Mailbox, response frames could be retrieved from any IRC. 

===Mailbox===

Prestel Mailbox was launched in 1983. Initially hosted on a computer in London, it was later made available UK-wide. 

The entry page was *7#. This linked to pages where messages could be composed, stored messages retrieved, and standard, pre-formatted messages completedmany designs were available, including greetings cards, invitations, and seasonal messages such as valentines.

To prepare a basic message, a blank message page (*77#) was displayed, with the sender&#x27;s Mailbox number pre-filled and blank fields for entering the recipient&#x27;s number and the message text. There was space for about 100 words, and fewer if graphics were used. After addressing (with a Mailbox number) and writing the message, the user was offered the choice of keying 1 to send, or 2 to not send. Successful dispatch led to a confirmation page; if there were problems, such as a mistake in entering the recipient&#x27;s number, an error message was displayed. Sending a message to more than one recipient meant re-keying the text into a new message page, although some microcomputers allowed the original message to be stored and then copy-pasted.

Mailbox numbers were derived from the last nine digits of a user&#x27;s phone number. For example, the Mailbox number for Prestel HQ, with the phone number 01-822-2211, was 018222211. Numbers were listed on page *486#. Ex-directory numbers were available on request.

When a user connected to Prestel, a banner on their Welcome page alerted them to any new messages, and when signing off via *90#, a warning would appear if any new messages had arrived in the meantime, with the option to read them before disconnecting. Messages were retrieved from page *930#, where they were presented in chronological order. After reading a new message, a user had to choose between deleting or saving it before the next message was presented. Three messages could be stored at a time, and were accessible via page *931#.

Using this first version of Prestel Mailbox was free of additional charges. 

====Simpatico====

&quot;Simpatico&quot; was a free small ads service run by Prestel on page *787#. Users sent in their ads on a preformatted Mailbox page, with responses made via Mailbox. Ads were vetted and grouped under the headings of Heartsearch, Penpals, Interests &amp; Hobbies, Meetings, Groups &amp; Events, Friendsy (for younger users), and Life Begins At...

===Telex Link===
Prestel Mailbox was extended in 1984 to give access to the Telex service via &quot;Telex Link&quot;. On *8#, the Telex Link entry page, a message could be composed, the destination country chosen, and the telex number entered before sending the telex like a standard message. Telex Link added the necessary telex codes and tried to send the message several times before confirming receipt (or failure) via Mailbox. 

A telex could be sent to a Mailbox user from any telex terminal by using 295141 TXLINK G, the Telex Link number, as the telex address, and entering &quot;MBX&quot;, followed by the Prestel user&#x27;s Mailbox number, as the first line of the telex. An incoming telex appeared to the Prestel recipient as an ordinary Mailbox message, with the telex number of the sender added at the top of the screen. 

Sending a telex cost 50p for UK destinations, £1.00 for Europe, £2.00 for North America, £3.00 for elsewhere in the world, and £5.00 for sending to ships (via INMARSAT). There was no charge for receiving one. 

Telex Link was upgraded in 1987, with connections to more telex lines and faster delivery times, and its address changed to 934999 TXLINK G.

===Mailbox upgrade===
A new messaging system was introduced in July 1989. This enabled messages up to five frames long, storing messages before sending, sending to multiple recipients (either individually or via a mailing list), message forwarding, and acknowledgment of receipt. Basic word-processing was also possible. 

Sending a message without using any of these new facilities remained free: all the new options were charged at 1p per use per recipient. For the first time, sending spam was permitted at a cost of 20p per message per recipient. In addition, the stored message facility was replaced by a summary page listing all the messages, both new and old, that were waiting: the user could then pick which message to view, rather than needing to read through them in chronological order.

===Message statistics===
By 1984, Prestel users were sending messages at the rate of around 71,000 per month via a computer in London. The average number per month in early 1984 was 186,000, of which 125,000 were response frames and 61,000 Mailbox messages.

In September 1985, after Mailbox became a national service, the chief executive of the part of British Telecom responsible for Prestel stated that 100,000 &quot;electronic mail messages&quot;Mailbox messages and response frameswere being sent each week, with 60,000 terminals attached to the system. The average weekly figure rose to 130,000 in December 1985.
===Hack===
A security breach of the Prestel mailbox of Prince Philip, Duke of Edinburgh occurred in November 1984 as part of a wider hack of Prestel.

==Infrastructure==
===Terminals===
During the development phase of Prestel, British Telecom&#x27;s research department produced a Prestel terminal specification. This formed the basis of design and type-approval discussions with, initially, manufacturers of TVs, and later with suppliers of other forms of terminal.

Several types of Prestel terminal were produced:
* integrated residential terminals, typically based on television sets;
* integrated business terminals;
* adaptors for television sets;
* adaptors for microcomputers, with associated or standalone editing software;
* editing terminals.
===Network===
====Configuration and growth====
In March 1979, the Post Office launched a limited &quot;London Residential Service&quot; for subscribers in the capital. This was based on the computer used in an earlier test phase to both store the Prestel database and enable IPs to make updates to their pages.

When the full commercial service launched in September 1979, three new computer centres were opened in London. Two, known as Byron and Juniper, were &quot;Information Retrieval Centres&quot; (IRCs): their computers each contained a copy of the Prestel database, and were accessible by users. The third, Duke, was Prestel&#x27;s &quot;Update Centre&quot; (UDC): IPs used this to create, modify or delete their pages, with their updates sent to the IRCs. A fourth IRC, Dickens, opened in Birmingham in December.

IRCs were connected to the UDC in a star network configuration using leased-line connections (based on the X.25 protocol) operating at 2400 baud. This network handled about 2,000 Prestel terminals and provided users with over 160,000 pages supplied by around 130 IPs. By mid-1981, this arrangement had been replaced by dedicated X.25 circuits using the then-new PSS packet-switched network and operating at 4.8 kbit/s. Each IRC typically housed two information retrieval computers, though some in London had a single machine. IRCs were usually located in telephone exchanges.

By June 1980, the network had grown to four individual information-retrieval computers in London, and six others installed in pairs in each of Birmingham, Edinburgh and Manchester, making ten in all. 
These ten computers could initially connect to around 1000 user ports, expandable to 2000. At this point, the Prestel database contained about 164,000 pages with expandability to up to 260,000 built in: allowing for system management pages, this arrangement capped the size of the public database at around 250,000 frames.

By September 1980, there were five IRC machines in London and pairs of machines in Birmingham, Nottingham, Edinburgh, Glasgow, Manchester, Liverpool and Belfast, offering a total of 914 user ports. Further IRCs were planned in Luton, Reading, Sevenoaks, Brighton, Leeds, Newcastle, Cardiff, Bristol, Bournemouth, Chelmsford and Norwich by the end of 1980. By the end of 1980, 1500 user ports were available.

As of July 1981, the number of IRC computers had grown to 18: this increased the percentage of phone subscribers who could access Prestel at local call rates from 30% to 62%. In April 1984, Prestel announced that this had risen to 94%, and in February 1986, to 98%.

====International access====
In late 1981, an IRC called Jefferson opened in Boston, Massachusetts, giving US subscribers access to Prestel via the American Telenet packet-switched network.

====Mailbox computer====

Mailbox, the Prestel messaging service, was launched on Enterprise computer, and allowed messaging only between users accessing that machine. By 1984, Mailbox had been rolled out nationwide using a dedicated computer in London known as Pandora.

===Hardware===
Prestel&#x27;s computers were based on the GEC 4000 series minicomputer. The main IRC machines were originally model GEC 4082s equipped with 384 Kbyte memory-core stores, six 70 Mbyte hard disk drives, and 100 ports. This set-up accommodated an initial 1500 Prestel users. 

Each IRC computer had 208 ports. With eight reserved for testing and control, a computer could support up to 200 simultaneous Prestel users. For the ordinary user, access was via an asynchronous, duplex interface provided by banks of multiplexers. These, in turn, were accessed via standard modems, operating at 1200/75 bit/s, directly connected to the public phone network.

Besides the multiplexers required to support 1200/75 dial-up access, the Update Centre machines were also connected to special modems that handled online bulk updating by IPs. Banks of 300/300 bit/s full-duplex asynchronous V.21 modems supported direct IP-computer-to-Prestel-computer links, while 1200 bit/s half-duplex V.23 modems supported access by IPs using editing terminals that stored frames offline before uploading them. In addition, twin 9-track NRZI tape decks of 800 bytes/inch capacity were provided for bulk offline updates.

Though categorised as a minicomputer, GEC 4000 series machines were large: one occupied several standard computer cabinets each standing high by wide. The CDC 9762 hard disc drives were housed separately in large, stand-alone units about the size of a domestic washing machine. A GEC machine cost over £200,000 at standard prices, in addition to which were the costs of the associated communications equipment. Combining the two to assemble a single IRC was a major undertaking, and took some 15 months from order placement to commissioning.

===Software===
GEC 4000 series computers could run on several operating systems. The Prestel machines used OS4000, which was developed by GEC and supported BABBAGE, the high-level assembler in which all Prestel software was written.

The pilot-trial system had five core software components: process, process, process, -handler process, and several processes. received data from a Prestel user; accepted characters, one at a time, from and fed them to a ; the key frame-getter fetched a fresh page or the next frame of an already-displayed page from . then displayed a whole frame, preceded by a clear-screen command, to the user.

The commercial service had several important additional functions, including an editing program and bulk update facilities, closed user groups, messages, user billing and IP revenue allocation, optional additional user passwords, error-reporting routines, system manager facilities, and statistics-collecting routines. 

In 1987, a Prestel Admin computer was introduced to support the user registration process. It captured a new user&#x27;s details from the paper Prestel application form, transferred the data to the relevant Prestel computer, and then printed the welcome letter to be sent to the user concerned.

===Monitoring===
Users&#x27; connections to Prestel were monitored by a device known as VAMPIREViewdata Access Monitor and Priority Incident Reporting Equipment. Via private circuits connected to an IRC computer&#x27;s ports, this produced a continuously updated display on a monitoring screen at the Prestel Regional Centre responsible for an IRC. The screen showed a matrix of small squares, each corresponding to a port on an IRC computer. Free ports were green, occupied ones yellow, incoming calls-to-connect by Prestel users were pale blue, and faulty ports red. In this way, the overall status of an IRC machine could be summarised and seen at a glance.

The response time of the Prestel system was measured by a microcomputer-based device known as PET. This monitored frame retrieval times for users and how quickly frame-editing commands issued by IP editors were implemented. PET operated in conjunction with a hardware performance monitor that recorded central processing unit and disk-drive usage.

==International sales==
Prestel software and knowhow was sold to the state PTTs of several countries, including Austria, Australia, former West Germany, the then-British colony of Hong Kong, Italy, Malaysia, the Netherlands,
Singapore, and Switzerland. A private telecommunications company, GTE, bought the system in the USA.

<text>Tomislav Ladan (25 June 1932 – 12 September 2008) was a Croatian essayist, critic, translator and novelist.

Ladan was born in Ivanjica, Serbia, and spent his formative years in his native Bosnia and Herzegovina (Travnik, Bugojno), where he graduated from the Philosophical Faculty at Sarajevo. Since he couldn&#x27;t get permanent employment in the then Serbs-dominated Bosnian cultural life because of his sometimes ostentatious Croatian identity, Ladan worked intermittently as a private tutor, translator and journalist — until the Croatian doyen of belles letters, Miroslav Krleža, found him a job at the Yugoslav Lexicographical Institute in Zagreb. Ladan was the director of the same institute and the editor-in-chief of an eight-language parallel dictionary.

Ladan wrote several books of essays that cover diverse fields such as cursing in Croatian, voluminous polygraphy playing with etymological meanings of the words that define human culture, from God to globalization (&quot;Riječi&quot;, &quot;Words&quot;), and nuances of medieval spiritual culture (&quot;Parva medievalia&quot;).

Ladan&#x27;s only novel, &quot;Bosanski grb&quot; (&quot;Bosnian coat of arms&quot;) (1975) is a postmodernist fiction written as a combination of Rabelaisian linguistic feast and a treatise on the historical destiny of Croats in central Bosnia.

As a critic over more than four decades, Ladan surveyed virtually all works written in Croatian, Serbian, and Bosnian — not infrequently to the consternation of the &quot;objects&quot; of his criticism. Follower of T. S. Eliot, Ezra Pound and Frank Kermode, Ladan didn&#x27;t pay much attention to the deconstructionists (Derrida) or Foucault, both of whom he found arid and sterile. His best critical essays also evaluate such writers as William Faulkner and Robert Musil.

Ladan was also a noted translator from Greek, Latin, English, German, Swedish and Norwegian.

<doc id="842482" wikidata="Q15077891" url="?curid=842482" title="Honda ST series">
<text>The Honda ST series, also known as the Pan-European in Europe, is a duo of Sport Touring motorcycles comprising the ST1100 and the later ST1300.

Following the launch of the Gold Wing, which was very successful in the US, Honda&#x27;s marketing team perceived that the European market (hence the &quot;Pan European&quot; moniker) would appreciate a lighter, sportier, and more manoeuvrable motorcycle. Introduced in 1990, the ST1100 was given a water-cooled 90-degree V4 engine mounted inline, instead of a flat-four engine (as in the Gold Wing). The ST1100 gained most of the Gold Wing&#x27;s other characteristic engineering elements, such as shaft drive, a full fairing and integral panniers. Introduced to the European market a year before it was available in the United States, the ST1100 supplied within a sportier package the features required by touring riders, thereby filling a niche between the Honda VFR750F sports tourer and the larger Gold Wing.

Its successor, the ST1300, (also called the &quot;Pan-European&quot; in Europe), was introduced in 2002, becoming available in the US in 2003. Production continued through the 2012 model year. In November 2013, following deletion of the ST1300 from the model line, Honda announced the [[Honda CTX1300|CTX1300]], a cruiser motorcycle powered by a version of the ST1300&#x27;s engine modified for better fuel economy and increased torque at low RPMs.

==ST1100==
The ST1100 had a 1,085 cc longitudinal 90-degree V4 engine. The fuel tank was located below the saddle (the tank at the usual location is actually the cover for the air filter) to lower the center of gravity and thus improve the handling. It was manufactured by Honda between 1990 and 2002. A police variant, the ST1100P, was available for several more years.

The ST1100 was optimized for long-distance touring with the following features:
* A longitudinal V-4 engine layout with low maintenance shaft drive
* Optional antilock brakes (ABS) and traction control system (TCS). ABS model years from 1992 through 1995 have conventional separate front and rear braking systems. After 1996, ABS-equipped bikes have front-rear linked brakes (LBS). 
* An exceptionally large 28 L (7.4 US gallon) fuel tank, giving a range of about 300 highway miles (480 km).
* A large 40 amp, air-cooled alternator to power multiple accessories such as auxiliary lighting and electrically heated clothing (Early models had a problematic 28 amp alternator which could be upgraded to the 40 amp version)

Weighing around , the ST1100 was no lightweight. The bike was fitted with wing-shaped tipover protectors projecting from the side of the lower part of the fairing. These would not only protect the bike and cylinder heads in a crash, but, should the rider drop the bike on its side, would prevent this very heavy bike from leaning over so far that it would be nigh impossible to pick up again; the panniers also helped in this matter. The ST1100 low-mounted rear-view mirrors were particularly effective.
==ST1300==
The ST1300 1,261 cc V4 engine had a cassette-type five-speed transmission and a two-element fuel-tank. The engine forms a stressed member in a lighter aluminum frame, the layout giving a low centre of gravity. Just like the ST1100 that it superseded, the ST1300 features a standard riding posture, a liquid-cooled longitudinal V4 engine with shaft drive and a fully faired body with integral hard panniers as standard.

During the 2000 bike show season, Honda presented a prototype sport tourer called the X-Wing, featuring a 1,500 cc V6 engine, single-sided front and rear suspension and an automatic transmission. Speculation in the press that the X-Wing was the ST1100&#x27;s replacement was partially confirmed when Honda introduced an all-new ST1300 Pan European in Europe and Australia for the 2002 model year. For the U.S. market, the new bike would be imported in limited numbers (about 2,200 per year) starting in 2003 as the ST1300. &quot;Motor Cycle News&quot; reported in 2009 that Honda would replace the ST1300 with a new touring bike powered by a V4 engine mounted transversely, similar to the Honda VFR1200F layout. In 2011, Honda announced that development of the next generation Pan European motorcycle was on hold.

The ST1300 incorporates many of the X-Wing&#x27;s lines but none of its running gear. Power comes from a lower-slung 1,261 cc V4 engine mounted as a stressed member in a lighter aluminum frame. A major difference from the ST1100 is the use of balance shafts for smoothness, allowing the engine to be directly mounted to the frame. The revised engine layout and a split fuel tank shift some of the weight downward, making the ST1300 less top-heavy than its predecessor. The rear wheel is driven through a cassette-type five-speed transmission and shaft drive.

Honda&#x27;s ABS and linked brake package is an option for all years on the ST1300 in the United States, but became standard on the European ST1300 Pan European 2004 (A4 models). Unlike the ST1100, the ST1300 does not include a traction control system. In 2002 and 2003, models with ABS included an electrically adjustable windscreen. The electrically adjustable windscreen became standard equipment on all bikes in 2004. A long list of minor differences improved upon the ST1100&#x27;s comfort, handling and performance.

===Pan weave===

Evidence indicates the ST1300 can exhibit a weave instability mode at high speed – known in the case of the ST1300 as &quot;Pan Weave&quot;.

In April 2007, subsequent to the death of a police motorcyclist riding a single seat ST1300, the emergency service version of the ST1300, a British coroner announced he would warn all Chief Constables in England and Wales of the &quot;serious threat&quot; to riders&#x27; lives posed by the ST1300 and the &quot;catastrophic result&quot; of the high speed weave. Later safety checks resulted in one examiner sustaining several broken bones in a similar incident. UK police forces subsequently withdrew the ST1300 from police service; London Ambulance Service continue to operate the ST1300.

&quot;RiDE Magazine&quot; reported in October 2007 that a team replicated weave instability mode with a civilian Honda ST1300 – reproducing the instability at a speed of under certain loading conditions. The rider noticed a rear wheel maximum yaw of 11 degrees per second, described as &quot;a consistent and alarming sideways movement.&quot; The editors named the behavior &quot;Pan weave&quot;. The intent of the testing was not to determine the cause of the weave, but to confirm its existence. Also, the article reported that 43% of surveyed ST1300 owners had experienced the weave.

====Honda&#x27;s response====
American Honda published an advisory in August 2007 on the proper selection, installation, and use of equipment on the ST1300PA police motorcycle. They made a strong recommendation to have &quot;qualified personnel evaluate a motorcycle fitted with all intended equipment under the anticipated speeds and conditions before the vehicle is placed into service.&quot; The advisory also contained guidelines for the selection and installation of attachments, including: 
*Place equipment as low and close to the center of the motorcycle as possible;
*avoid exceeding the maximum load limit for the vehicle;
*comply with weight limits for each saddlebag and fairing pocket;
*ensure attachments and equipment are balanced on both sides of the vehicle.

By 2010, the ST1300PA was again popular with police departments in the UK and in the US, competing with police bikes from Harley-Davidson, BMW, Kawasaki and Yamaha on both price and performance. The Automobile Association and other groups providing roadside assistance or emergency services have also chosen the ST1300 for their motorcycle fleets since 2010.

<doc id="842483" wikidata="Q388691" url="?curid=842483" title="Constructive empiricism">
<text>In philosophy of science, constructive empiricism is a form of empiricism. While it is sometimes referred to as an empiricist form of structuralism, its main proponent, Bas van Fraassen, has consistently distinguished between the two views.

==Overview==
Bas van Fraassen is nearly solely responsible for the initial development of constructive empiricism; its historically most important presentation appears in his &quot;The Scientific Image&quot; (1980). Constructive empiricism states that scientific theories are semantically literal, that they aim to be empirically adequate, and that their acceptance involves, as belief, only that they are empirically adequate. A theory is empirically adequate if and only if everything that it says about observable is true (regardless of what it says about unobservable entities). A theory is semantically literal if and only if the language of the theory is interpreted in such a way that the claims of the theory are either true or false (as opposed to an instrumentalist reading).

Constructive empiricism is thus a normative, semantic and epistemological thesis. That science aims to be empirically adequate expresses the normative component. That scientific theories are semantically literal expresses the semantic component. That acceptance involves, as belief, only that a theory is empirically adequate expresses the epistemological component.

Constructive empiricism opposes scientific realism, logical positivism (or logical empiricism) and instrumentalism. Constructive empiricism and scientific realism agree that theories are semantically literal, which logical positivism and instrumentalism deny. Constructive empiricism, logical positivism and instrumentalism agree that theories do not aim for truth about unobservables, which scientific realism denies.

Constructive empiricism has been used to analyze various scientific fields, from physics to psychology (especially computational psychology).

<doc id="842484" wikidata="Q4015008" url="?curid=842484" title="Recirculating ball">
<text>Recirculating ball, also known as recirculating ball and nut or worm and sector, is a steering mechanism commonly found in older automobiles, off-road vehicles, and some trucks. Most newer cars use the more economical rack and pinion steering instead, but some upmarket manufacturers (such as BMW and Mercedes-Benz) held on to the design until well into the 1990s for the durability and strength inherent in the design. A few, including Chrysler, General Motors, Lada and Ineos, still use this technology in certain models including the Jeep Wrangler, the Ineos Grenadier Quartermaster and the Lada Niva.

==Mechanism==
The recirculating ball steering mechanism contains a worm gear inside a block with a threaded hole in it; this block has gear teeth cut into the outside to engage the sector shaft (also called a sector gear) which moves the Pitman arm. The steering wheel connects to a shaft, which rotates the worm gear inside of the block. Instead of twisting further into the block, the worm gear is fixed so that when it rotates, it moves the block, which transmits the motion through the gear to the Pitman arm, causing the roadwheels to turn.

===Bearing balls===
The worm gear is similar in design to a ball screw; the threads are filled with steel balls that recirculate through the gear and rack as it turns. The balls serve to reduce friction and wear in the gear, and reduce slop. Slop, when the gears come out of contact with each other, would be felt when changing the direction of the steering wheel, causing the wheel to feel loose.

==Power assistance==
Power steering in a recirculating-ball system works similarly to that in a rack-and-pinion system. Assistance is provided by supplying higher-pressure fluid to one side of the block.

<doc id="842485" wikidata="Q1837339" url="?curid=842485" title="MESFET">
<text>A MESFET (metal–semiconductor field-effect transistor) is a field-effect transistor semiconductor device similar to a JFET with a Schottky (metal–semiconductor) junction instead of a p–n junction for a gate.

==Construction==
MESFETs are constructed in compound semiconductor technologies lacking high quality surface passivation, such as gallium arsenide, indium phosphide, or silicon carbide, and are faster but more expensive than silicon-based JFETs or MOSFETs. Production MESFETs are operated up to approximately 45 GHz, and are commonly used for microwave frequency communications and radar. The first MESFETs were developed in 1966, and a year later their extremely high frequency RF microwave performance was demonstrated. 

==Functional architecture==
The MESFET, similarly to JFET, differs from the common insulated gate FET or MOSFET because there is no insulator under the gate over the active switching region. This implies that the MESFET gate should, in transistor mode, be biased such that one has a reversed-biased depletion zone controlling the underlying channel, rather than a forward-conducting metal-semiconductor diode to the channel. 

While this restriction inhibits certain circuit possibilities as the gate must remain reverse-biased and cannot, therefore, exceed a certain voltage of forward bias, MESFETs analog and digital devices work reasonably well if kept within the confines of design limits. The most critical aspect of the design is the gate metal extent over the switching region. Generally, the narrower the gate modulated carrier channel, the better the frequency handling abilities. Spacing of the source and drain concerning the gate, and the lateral extent of the gate are important though somewhat less critical design parameters. 
MESFET current handling ability improves as the gate is elongated laterally, keeping the active region constant, however, phase shift along the gate is limited due to the transmission line effect. As a result, most production MESFETs use a built-up top layer of low-resistance metal on the gate, often producing a mushroom-like profile in cross-section.

==Applications==
Numerous MESFET fabrication possibilities have been explored for a wide variety of semiconductor systems. Some of the main application areas are military communications, as front end low noise amplifier of microwave receivers in both military radar devices and communication, commercial optoelectronics, satellite communication, as a power amplifier for the output stage of microwave links, and as a power oscillator.

<doc id="842487" wikidata="Q5739185" url="?curid=842487" title="Heritage of Shannara">
<text>The Heritage of Shannara is a series of four fantasy novels by Terry Brooks, set hundreds of years after the original &quot;Shannara&quot; trilogy. Unlike the original trilogy, however, this series is all one, cohesive story, in contrast to the three isolated stories of the originals. It is set in a future Four Lands in which the Federation of the Southland has driven off the Elves, enslaved the Dwarves, and outlawed magic. Only the rebel Free-born, led by Padishar Creel, dare to resist. The series begins with &quot;The Scions of Shannara&quot; (1990), when the Ohmsford descendants are summoned by the shade of Allanon to combat the Shadowen that have been poisoning the land, each charged with a quest only they can embark on. The story continues with &quot;The Druid of Shannara&quot; (1991), &quot;The Elf Queen of Shannara&quot; (1992), and concludes with &quot;The Talismans of Shannara&quot; (1993).

==Plot Synopses==

===&quot;The Scions of Shannara&quot;===
The shade of the Druid Allanon delivers three quests to the three Scions: Par Ohmsford must find the lost Sword of Shannara, Par&#x27;s uncle Walker Boh must restore the lost keep of Paranor and its Druids, and Par&#x27;s cousin Wren Ohmsford must restore the lost race of the Elves. The novel then focuses on Par&#x27;s travels with his brother and Coll Ohmsford and his friend Morgan Leah as they attempt to retrieve the Sword of Shannara. The book ends with all three Scions in peril.
===&quot;The Druid of Shannara&quot;===
The second novel mainly follows Walker Boh, as he reluctantly searches for the Black Elfstone, which has the power to restore the Druids and their keep, Paranor. The Black Elfstone has been stolen by the Stone King, an ancient being who seeks to turn the world to stone. On this quest, Walker is assisted by Quicksilver, the beautiful daughter of the King of the Silver River; she is the subject of an assassination attempt. Meanwhile, Coll has been captured by the Shadowen.

===&quot;The Elf Queen of Shannara&quot;===
The third novel chronicles Wren Ohmsford&#x27;s travels beyond the shores of the Westland in search of the lost Elven race. Wren and her companion, the deaf-mute giant Garth, discover the elves in their city of Arbolon. The elves are doubly threatened by evil beasts (kept out by a magical barrier) and the eruption of the volcanic island upon which Arbolon sits. Wren learns that she is an elf, granddaughter of the titular elf Queen Ellenroh, and accepts the task of returning Arbolon to the mainland concealed in a magic jewel. Meanwhile, Coll escapes the Shadowen but leads them to his brother Par. Walker becomes a Druid and discovers their keep, Paranor.

===&quot;The Talismans of Shannara&quot;===
The last novel details the final conflict between the Ohmsfords and the Shadowen monsters that have overtaken the Four Lands. It begins with all three having completed their assigned quests, but facing severe challenges. Par believes he is responsible for his brother&#x27;s death; Walker has been attacked at Paranor by Shadowen in the form of the Four Horsemen; and Wren, newly Queen of the Elves, faces an invading army. Rimmer Dall, leader of the Shadowen, orchestrates Wren&#x27;s betrayal by a seeming friend. Coll is corrupted by a magical Shadowen cloak, and claims the Sword of Shannara which Par thought would be his. Par loses control of his magic powers and comes to believe he should join the Shadowen. Despite these conflicts, the Scions reunite, unite the Four Lands, and vanquish the evil Shadowen.

== Reception ==
Reviews in &quot;Kirkus&quot; were largely negative, criticizing each book as formulac and unpolished, though the reviewers acknowledged that fans of the series would likely be satisfied. Fantasy Literature called &quot;Heritage of Shannara&quot; &quot;Brooks’ best Shannara series&quot;. The final volume, Talismans of Shannara, was a Publishers Weekly bestseller for nine weeks.

Locally owned by North American Broadcasting Company, Inc., WMNI serves the Columbus metropolitan area. WMNI&#x27;s studios are located in Marble Cliff, Ohio, using a Columbus address, while the transmitter resides in Grove City. In addition to a standard analog transmission, WMNI is available online.

==Programming==
In addition to its sports talk format, WMNI carries a number of local and national sports events, including the Indy 500, the Brickyard 400, Notre Dame college football and Columbus Clippers Triple A baseball.

On Saturday and Sunday mornings, WMNI features talk shows such as &quot;Plant Talk with Fred Hower&quot; and &quot;At Home With Gary Sullivan&quot; as well as some paid brokered programming. WMNI carries news updates from Fox News Radio.

==History==
On , WMNI first signed on the air. For most of its three decades, it had a full service, country radio format. As country music listening started to move from AM to FM in the 1980s, WMNI switched to a satellite-delivered adult standards format from Westwood One. By the late 1990s, much of the music was locally programmed using Columbus-based disc jockeys. As of August 2007, WMNI shifted back to Westwood One&#x27;s &quot;America&#x27;s Best Music&quot; format, a mix of soft oldies and standards.

On June 14, 2012 at 6:00 a.m., WMNI switched to a simulcast of WMNI-FM, which had flipped from a classic hits sound as WTDA-FM to a news format.

On July 18, 2013, the AM/FM simulcast ended, with WMNI returning to the soft oldies and adult standards format.

On June 12, 2017, WMNI changed their format from adult standards to soft adult contemporary music, branded as &quot;Easy 95.1 &amp; 920&quot; (simulcast on FM translator W236CZ 95.1 FM Columbus).

On June 14, 2022, WMNI changed their format from soft adult contemporary to sports, branded as &quot;Fox Sports 920&quot;, with programming from Fox Sports Radio. The 95.1 translator switched to a relay of sister station WJKR&#x27;s HD2 subchannel.

<doc id="842493" wikidata="Q1617706" url="?curid=842493" title="High-electron-mobility transistor">
<text>A high-electron-mobility transistor (HEMT or HEM FET), also known as heterostructure FET (HFET) or modulation-doped FET (MODFET), is a field-effect transistor incorporating a junction between two materials with different band gaps (i.e. a heterojunction) as the channel instead of a doped region (as is generally the case for a MOSFET). A commonly used material combination is GaAs with AlGaAs, though there is wide variation, dependent on the application of the device. Devices incorporating more indium generally show better high-frequency performance, while in recent years, gallium nitride HEMTs have attracted attention due to their high-power performance.

Like other FETs, HEMTs can be used in integrated circuits as digital on-off switches. FETs can also be used as amplifiers for large amounts of current using a small voltage as a control signal. Both of these uses are made possible by the FET’s unique current–voltage characteristics. HEMT transistors are able to operate at higher frequencies than ordinary transistors, up to millimeter wave frequencies, and are used in high-frequency products such as cell phones, satellite television receivers, voltage converters, and radar equipment. They are widely used in satellite receivers, in low power amplifiers and in the defense industry.

== Applications ==
The applications of HEMTs include microwave and millimeter wave communications, imaging, radar, radio astronomy, and power switching. They are found in many types of equipment ranging from cellphones, power supply adapters and DBS receivers to radio astronomy and electronic warfare systems such as radar systems. Numerous companies worldwide develop, manufacture, and sell HEMT-based devices in the form of discrete transistors, as &#x27;monolithic microwave integrated circuits&#x27; (MMICs), or within power switching integrated circuits.

HEMTs are suitable for applications where high gain and low noise at high frequencies are required, as they have shown current gain to frequencies greater than 600 GHz and power gain to frequencies greater than 1THz. Gallium nitride based HEMTs are used as power switching transistors for voltage converter applications due to their low on-state resistances, low switching losses, and high breakdown strength. These gallium nitride enhanced voltage converter applications include AC adapters, which benefit from smaller package sizes due to the power circuitry requiring smaller passive electronic components.

== History ==
The invention of the high-electron-mobility transistor (HEMT) is usually attributed to physicist Takashi Mimura (三村 高志), while working at Fujitsu in Japan. The basis for the HEMT was the GaAs (gallium arsenide) MOSFET (metal–oxide–semiconductor field-effect transistor), which Mimura had been researching as an alternative to the standard silicon (Si) MOSFET since 1977. He conceived the HEMT in Spring 1979, when he read about a modulated-doped heterojunction superlattice developed at Bell Labs in the United States, by Ray Dingle, Arthur Gossard and Horst Störmer who filed a patent in April 1978. Mimura filed a patent disclosure for a HEMT in August 1979, and then a patent later that year. The first demonstration of a HEMT device, the D-HEMT, was presented by Mimura and Satoshi Hiyamizu in May 1980, and then they later demonstrated the first E-HEMT in August 1980.

Independently, Daniel Delagebeaudeuf and Tranc Linh Nuyen, while working at Thomson-CSF in France, filed a patent for a similar type of field-effect transistor in March 1979. It also cites the Bell Labs patent as an influence. The first demonstration of an &quot;inverted&quot; HEMT was presented by Delagebeaudeuf and Nuyen in August 1980.

One of the earliest mentions of a GaN-based HEMT is in the 1993 &quot;Applied Physics Letters&quot; article, by Khan &quot;et al&quot;. Later, in 2004, P.D. Ye and B. Yang &quot;et al&quot; demonstrated a GaN (gallium nitride) metal–oxide–semiconductor HEMT (MOS-HEMT). It used atomic layer deposition (ALD) aluminum oxide (Al2O3) film both as a gate dielectric and for surface passivation.

== Operation ==
Field effect transistors whose operation relies on the formation of a two-dimensional electron gas (2DEG) are known as HEMTs. In HEMTS electric current flows between a drain and source element via the 2DEG, which is located at the interface between two layers of differing band gaps, termed the heterojunction. Some examples of previously explored heterojunction layer compositions (heterostructures) for HEMTs include AlGaN/GaN, AlGaAs/GaAs, InGaAs/GaAs, and Si/SiGe. 

=== Advantages ===
The advantages of HEMTs over other transistor architectures, like the bipolar junction transistor and the MOSFET, are the higher operating temperatures, higher breakdown strengths, and lower specific on-state resistances, all in the case of GaN-based HEMTs compared to Si-based MOSFETs. Furthermore, InP-based HEMTs exhibit low noise performance and higher switching speeds.

=== 2DEG channel creation ===
The wide band element is doped with donor atoms; thus it has excess electrons in its conduction band. These electrons will diffuse to the adjacent narrow band material’s conduction band due to the availability of states with lower energy. The movement of electrons will cause a change in potential and thus an electric field between the materials. The electric field will push electrons back to the wide band element’s conduction band. The diffusion process continues until electron diffusion and electron drift balance each other, creating a junction at equilibrium similar to a p–n junction. Note that the undoped narrow band gap material now has excess majority charge carriers. The fact that the charge carriers are majority carriers yields high switching speeds, and the fact that the low band gap semiconductor is undoped means that there are no donor atoms to cause scattering and thus yields high mobility.

In the case of GaAs HEMTs, they make use of high mobility electrons generated using the heterojunction of a highly doped wide-bandgap n-type donor-supply layer (AlGaAs in our example) and a non-doped narrow-bandgap channel layer with no dopant impurities (GaAs in this case). The electrons generated in the thin n-type AlGaAs layer drop completely into the GaAs layer to form a depleted AlGaAs layer, because the heterojunction created by different band-gap materials forms a quantum well (a steep canyon) in the conduction band on the GaAs side where the electrons can move quickly without colliding with any impurities because the GaAs layer is undoped, and from which they cannot escape. The effect of this is the creation of a very thin layer of highly mobile conducting electrons with very high concentration, giving the channel very low resistivity (or to put it another way, &quot;high electron mobility&quot;).

=== Electrostatic mechanism ===
Since GaAs has higher electron affinity, free electrons in the AlGaAs layer are transferred to the undoped GaAs layer where they form a two dimensional high mobility electron gas within 100 ångström (10 nm) of the interface. The n-type AlGaAs layer of the HEMT is depleted completely through two depletion mechanisms:
* Trapping of free electrons by surface states causes the surface depletion.
* Transfer of electrons into the undoped GaAs layer brings about the interface depletion.

The Fermi level of the gate metal is matched to the pinning point, which is 1.2 eV below the conduction band. With the reduced AlGaAs layer thickness, the electrons supplied by donors in the AlGaAs layer are insufficient to pin the layer. As a result, band bending is moving upward and the two-dimensional electrons gas does not appear. When a positive voltage greater than the threshold voltage is applied to the gate, electrons accumulate at the interface and form a two-dimensional electron gas.

=== Modulation doping in HEMTs ===
An important aspect of HEMTs is that the band discontinuities across the conduction and valence bands can be modified separately. This allows the type of carriers in and out of the device to be controlled. As HEMTs require electrons to be the main carriers, a graded doping can be applied in one of the materials, thus making the conduction band discontinuity smaller and keeping the valence band discontinuity the same. This diffusion of carriers leads to the accumulation of electrons along the boundary of the two regions inside the narrow band gap material. The accumulation of electrons leads to a very high current in these devices. The term &quot;modulation doping&quot; refers to the fact that the dopants are spatially in a different region from the current carrying electrons. This technique was invented by Horst Störmer at Bell Labs.

== Manufacture ==
MODFETs can be manufactured by epitaxial growth of a strained SiGe layer. In the strained layer, the germanium content increases linearly to around 40-50%. This concentration of germanium allows the formation of a quantum well structure with a high conduction band offset and a high density of very mobile charge carriers. The end result is a FET with ultra-high switching speeds and low noise. InGaAs/AlGaAs, AlGaN/InGaN, and other compounds are also used in place of SiGe. InP and GaN are starting to replace SiGe as the base material in MODFETs because of their better noise and power ratios.

== Versions of HEMTs ==

=== By growth technology: pHEMT and mHEMT ===
Ideally, the two different materials used for a heterojunction would have the same lattice constant (spacing between the atoms). In practice, the lattice constants are typically slightly different (e.g. AlGaAs on GaAs), resulting in crystal defects. As an analogy, imagine pushing together two plastic combs with a slightly different spacing. At regular intervals, you&#x27;ll see two teeth clump together. In semiconductors, these discontinuities form deep-level traps and greatly reduce device performance.

A HEMT where this rule is violated is called a pHEMT or pseudomorphic HEMT. This is achieved by using an extremely thin layer of one of the materials – so thin that the crystal lattice simply stretches to fit the other material. This technique allows the construction of transistors with larger bandgap differences than otherwise possible, giving them better performance.

Another way to use materials of different lattice constants is to place a buffer layer between them. This is done in the mHEMT or metamorphic HEMT, an advancement of the pHEMT. The buffer layer is made of AlInAs, with the indium concentration graded so that it can match the lattice constant of both the GaAs substrate and the GaInAs channel. This brings the advantage that practically any Indium concentration in the channel can be realized, so the devices can be optimized for different applications (low indium concentration provides low noise; high indium concentration gives high gain).

=== By electrical behaviour: eHEMT and dHEMT ===
HEMTs made of semiconductor hetero-interfaces lacking interfacial net polarization charge, such as AlGaAs/GaAs, require positive gate voltage or appropriate donor-doping in the AlGaAs barrier to attract the electrons towards the gate, which forms the 2D electron gas and enables conduction of electron currents. This behaviour is similar to that of commonly used field-effect transistors in the enhancement mode, and such a device is called enhancement HEMT, or eHEMT.

When a HEMT is built from AlGaN/GaN, higher power density and breakdown voltage can be achieved. Nitrides also have different crystal structure with lower symmetry, namely the wurtzite one, which has built-in electrical polarisation. Since this polarization differs between the GaN &quot;channel&quot; layer and AlGaN &quot;barrier&quot; layer, a sheet of uncompensated charge in the order of 0.01-0.03 C/mformula_1 is formed. Due to the crystal orientation typically used for epitaxial growth (&quot;gallium-faced&quot;) and the device geometry favorable for fabrication (gate on top), this charge sheet is positive, causing the 2D electron gas to be formed even if there is no doping. Such a transistor is normally on, and will turn off only if the gate is negatively biased - thus this kind of HEMT is known as &quot;depletion HEMT&quot;, or dHEMT. By sufficient doping of the barrier with acceptors (e.g. Mg), the built-in charge can be compensated to restore the more customary eHEMT operation, however high-density p-doping of nitrides is technologically challenging due to dopant diffusion into the channel.

===Induced HEMT===
In contrast to a modulation-doped HEMT, an induced high electron mobility transistor provides the flexibility to tune different electron densities with a top gate, since the charge carriers are &quot;induced&quot; to the 2DEG plane rather than created by dopants. The absence of a doped layer enhances the electron mobility significantly when compared to their modulation-doped counterparts.
This level of cleanliness provides opportunities to perform research into the field of Quantum Billiard for quantum chaos studies, or applications in ultra stable and ultra sensitive electronic devices.

<doc id="842495" wikidata="Q578111" url="?curid=842495" title="Auxotrophy">
<text>Auxotrophy ( &quot;to increase&quot;; &quot;τροφή&quot; &quot;nourishment&quot;) is the inability of an organism to synthesize a particular organic compound required for its growth (as defined by IUPAC). An auxotroph is an organism that displays this characteristic; &quot;auxotrophic&quot; is the corresponding adjective. Auxotrophy is the opposite of prototrophy, which is characterized by the ability to synthesize all the compounds needed for growth.

Prototrophic cells (also referred to as the &#x27;wild type&#x27;) are self-sufficient producers of all required metabolites (e.g. amino acids, lipids, cofactors), while auxotrophs require to be on medium with the metabolite that they cannot produce. For example saying a cell is methionine auxotrophic means that it would need to be on a medium containing methionine or else it would not be able to replicate. In this example this is because it is unable to produce its own methionine (methionine auxotroph). However, a prototroph or a methionine prototrophic cell would be able to function and replicate on a medium with or without methionine.

Replica plating is a technique that transfers colonies from one plate to another in the same spot as the last plate so the different media plates can be compared side by side. It is used to compare the growth of the same colonies on different plates of media to determine which environments the bacterial colony can or cannot grow in (this gives insight to possible auxotrophic characteristics. The method of replica plating implemented by Joshua Lederberg and Esther Lederberg included auxotrophs that were temperature-sensitive; that is, their ability to synthesize was temperature-dependent. (Auxotrophs are usually not temperature-dependent. They can also depend on other factors.) It is also possible that an organism is auxotrophic to more than just one organic compound that it requires for growth.

== Applications ==

=== Genetics ===
In genetics, a strain is said to be auxotrophic if it carries a mutation that renders it unable to synthesize an essential compound. For example, a yeast mutant with an inactivated uracil synthesis pathway gene is a uracil auxotroph (e.g., if the yeast Orotidine 5&#x27;-phosphate decarboxylase gene is inactivated, the resultant strain is a uracil auxotroph). Such a strain is unable to synthesize uracil and will only be able to grow if uracil can be taken up from the environment. This is the opposite of a uracil prototroph, or in this case a wild-type strain, which can still grow in the absence of uracil. Auxotrophic genetic markers are often used in molecular genetics; they were famously used in Beadle and Tatum&#x27;s Nobel Prize-winning work on the one gene-one enzyme hypothesis, connecting mutations of genes to protein mutations. This then allows for biosynthetic or biochemical pathway mapping that can help determine which enzyme or enzymes are mutated and dysfunctional in the auxotrophic strains of bacteria being studied.

Researchers have used strains of &quot;E. coli&quot; auxotrophic for specific amino acids to introduce non-natural amino acid analogues into proteins. For instance cells auxotrophic for the amino acid phenylalanine can be grown in media supplemented with an analogue such as para-azido phenylalanine.

Many living things, including humans, are auxotrophic for large classes of compounds required for growth and must obtain these compounds through diet (see vitamin, essential nutrient, essential amino acid, essential fatty acid).

The complex pattern of evolution of vitamin auxotrophy across the eukaryotic tree of life is intimately connected with the interdependence between organisms.
=== The Mutagenicity test (or Ames test) ===
The Salmonella Mutagenesis test (Ames test) uses multiple strains of &quot;Salmonella typhimurium&quot; that are auxotrophic to histidine to test whether a given chemical can cause mutations by observing its auxotrophic property in response to an added chemical compound. The mutation a chemical substance or compound causes is measured by applying it to the bacteria on a plate containing histidine then moving the bacteria to a new plate without sufficient histidine for continual growth. If the substance does not mutate the genome of the bacteria from auxotrophic to histidine back to prototrophic to histidine, then the bacteria would not show growth on the new plate. So by comparing the ratio of the bacteria on the new plate to the old plate and the same ratio for the control group, it is possible to quantify how mutagenic a substance is, or rather, how likely it is to cause mutations in DNA. A chemical is considered positive for Ames test if it causes mutations increasing the observed reversion rate and negative if presents similar to the control group. There is a normal, but small, number of revertant colonies expected when an auxotrophic bacteria is plated on a media without the metabolite it needs because it could mutate back to prototrophy. The chances of this are low and therefore cause very small colonies to be formed. If a mutagenic substance is added, however, the number of revertants would be visibly higher than without the mutagenic substance. The Ames test, basically, is considered positive if a substance increases chance of mutation in the DNA of the bacteria enough to cause a quantifiable difference in the revertants of the mutagen plate and the control group plate. Negative Ames test means the possible mutagen DID not cause increase in revertants and positive Ames test signifies that the possible mutagen DID increase the chance of mutation. These mutagenic effects on bacteria are researched as a possible indicator of the same effects on larger organisms, like humans. It is suggested that if a mutation can arise in bacterial DNA under presence of a mutagen then the same effect would occur for larger organisms causing cancer. A negative Ames test result could suggest that the substance is not a mutagen and would not cause tumor formation in living organisms. However only few of the positive Ames Test resulting chemicals were considered insignificant when tested in larger organisms but the positive Ames test for bacteria still could not be conclusively linked to expression of cancer in larger organisms. While it can be a possible determinant of tumors for living organisms, humans, animals, and so on, more studies must be completed to come to a conclusion.

=== Auxotrophy-based methods to incorporate unnatural amino acids into proteins and proteomes ===

A large number of unnatural amino acids, which are similar to their canonical counterparts in shape, size and chemical properties, are introduced into the recombinant proteins by means of auxotrophic expression hosts. For example, methionine (Met) or tryptophan (Trp) auxotrophic &quot;Escherichia coli&quot; strains can be cultivated in a defined minimal medium. In this experimental setup it is possible to express recombinant proteins whose canonical Trp and Met residues are completely substituted with different medium-supplemented related analogs. This methodology leads to a new form of protein engineering, which is not performed by codon manipulation at the DNA level (e.g. oligonucleotide-directed mutagenesis), but by codon reassignments at the level of protein translation under efficient selective pressure. Therefore, the method is referred as selective pressure incorporation (SPI).

No organism studied so far encodes other amino acids than the canonical twenty; two additional canonical amino acids (selenocysteine, pyrrolysine) are inserted into proteins by recoding translation termination signals. This boundary can be crossed by adaptive laboratory evolution of metabolically stable auxotrophic microbial strains. For example, the first clearly successful attempt to evolve &quot;Escherichia coli&quot; that can survive solely on the unnatural amino acid thieno[3,2-b]pyrrolyl) alanine as the only substitute for tryptophan was made in 2015.

== In popular culture ==
The 1993 film &quot;Jurassic Park&quot; (based on the 1990 Michael Crichton novel of the same name) features dinosaurs that were genetically altered so that they could not produce the amino acid lysine. This was known as the &quot;lysine contingency&quot; and was supposed to prevent the cloned dinosaurs from surviving outside the park, forcing them to be dependent on lysine supplements provided by the park&#x27;s veterinary staff. In reality, no animals are capable of producing lysine (it is an essential amino acid).

<doc id="842507" wikidata="Q491416" url="?curid=842507" title="Frankie Trumbauer">
<text>Orie Frank Trumbauer (May 30, 1901 – June 11, 1956) was an American jazz saxophonist of the 1920s and 1930s. His main instrument was the C melody saxophone, a now-uncommon instrument between an alto and tenor saxophone in size and pitch. He also played alto saxophone, bassoon, clarinet and several other instruments.

He was a composer of sophisticated sax melodies, one of the major small group jazz bandleaders of the 1920s and 1930s. His landmark recording of &quot;Singin&#x27; the Blues&quot; with Bix Beiderbecke and Eddie Lang in 1927, was inducted into the Grammy Hall of Fame in 1977. His major recordings included &quot;Krazy Kat&quot;, &quot;Red Hot&quot;, &quot;Plantation Moods&quot;, &quot;Trumbology&quot;, &quot;Tailspin&quot;, &quot;Singin&#x27; the Blues&quot;, &quot;Wringin&#x27; an&#x27; Twistin&#x27;&quot;, and &quot;For No Reason at All in C&quot; with Bix Beiderbecke and Eddie Lang, and the first hit recording of &quot;Georgia On My Mind&quot; in 1931.

&quot;Tram&quot; was described as one of the most influential and important jazz saxophonists of the 1920s and 1930s, particularly influencing the sound of Lester Young. He is also remembered for his musical collaborations with Bix Beiderbecke, a relationship that produced some of the finest and most innovative jazz records of the late 1920s. Trumbauer and Beiderbecke also collaborated with jazz guitarist Eddie Lang.

He was featured in the 2001 documentary &quot;Jazz&quot; by Ken Burns on PBS on the topic of the first jazz soloists and as an iconic image to symbolize jazz music.

==Life and career==

Born of part Cherokee ancestry in Carbondale, Illinois, United States, Trumbauer grew up in St Louis, Missouri, the son of a musical mother who directed saxophone and theater orchestras. His first important professional engagements were with the Edgar Benson and Ray Miller bands, shortly followed by the Mound City Blue Blowers, a local group that became nationally famous through their recordings on Brunswick.

Trumbauer recruited Bix Beiderbecke for Jean Goldkette&#x27;s Victor Recording Orchestra, of which he became musical director. After leaving Goldkette, he and Beiderbecke worked briefly in Adrian Rollini&#x27;s short lived New Yorkers band, then joined Paul Whiteman in 1927. The same year, Trumbauer signed a contract with OKeh and released a 78 recording of &quot;Singin&#x27; the Blues&quot;, featuring Beiderbecke on cornet and Eddie Lang on guitar. &quot;Singin&#x27; the Blues&quot; was a jazz classic originally recorded and released by the Original Dixieland Jazz Band in 1920. The Okeh recording became a hit. Fletcher Henderson and His Orchestra recorded it in 1931 in the Trumbauer-Beiderbecke version.

Trumbauer played with Whiteman for eight of the following nine years. He had a separate contract with OKeh from 1927 through 1930, he recorded some of the small group jazz recordings of the era, usually including Beiderbecke until the April 30, 1929, session. He recorded a handful of sides in 1931 for Brunswick. In 1932, he organized a band in Chicago and recorded for Columbia, but gave up the orchestra and returned to New York late in 1933. During 1934–1936, while again a member of Paul Whiteman&#x27;s Orchestra, he also made a series of recordings for Brunswick and Victor, often including Jack Teagarden.

In 1936 he led The Three T&#x27;s, featuring the Teagarden brothers; in 1938, he and Mannie Klein started a band which they co-led; he billed himself as &quot;Frank Trombar.&quot; In 1939, Trumbauer, a skilled pilot, left music (after recording a series of records for Varsity) to join the Civil Aeronautics Authority.

During World War II he was a test pilot with North American Aviation, and trained military crews in the operation of the B-25 Mitchell bomber. He continued to work for the CAA after the war, and also played in the NBC Orchestra. After 1947, although he continued to play and record, he earned most of his income in aviation.

==Last years and death==
Trumbauer died of a heart attack in Kansas City, Missouri, where he had made his home for some years. He was 55 years old.

==Legacy==
Lester Young acknowledged and cited Trumbauer as his main influence as a saxophonist. When interviewer François Positif asked Young about his influences, he stated that Frankie Trumbauer was his major influence: &quot;So, it&#x27;s Trumbauer?&quot; Young replied: &quot;That was my man.&quot;

His life and career were documented in the biography &quot;Tram: The Frank Trumbauer Story&quot; by Philip R. Evans and Larry F. Kiner with William Trumbauer (Institute of Jazz Studies, Rutgers and Scarecrow Press Inc., 1994).

He was featured in Episode 3, &quot;Our Language&quot;, in the 2001 documentary &quot;Jazz&quot; by Ken Burns on PBS on the topic of pioneering jazz soloists. A photograph of him holding his Holton C-melody saxophone was one of the images chosen by Burns to symbolize jazz. The photo is featured on all the intros and outros as well as in Episode 3, &quot;Our Language&quot;. His 1927 solo in &quot;Singin&#x27; the Blues&quot; is analyzed as well.

He was known for double tonguing.

==Honors==
&quot;Singin&#x27; the Blues&quot;, released by Frankie Trumbauer and His Orchestra featuring Bix Beiderbecke on cornet and Eddie Lang on guitar in 1927 as Okeh 40772-B, was inducted into the Grammy Hall of Fame in 1977. Frankie Trumbauer played the C-melody saxophone solos on the landmark jazz recording.

In 2005, his 1927 recording of &quot;Singin&#x27; the Blues&quot; with Bix Beiderbecke and Eddie Lang was placed on the U.S. Library of Congress National Recording Registry.

In 2008, his recordings of &quot;Ostrich Walk&quot; and &quot;There&#x27;ll Come a Time&quot; with Bix Beiderbecke were included on the soundtrack to the Brad Pitt movie &quot;The Curious Case of Benjamin Button&quot;, which was nominated for 13 Academy Awards, based on the F. Scott Fitzgerald short story from &quot;Tales of the Jazz Age&quot;.

Ken Burns used a photograph of him in the 2001 documentary &quot;Jazz&quot;, on PBS, on the topic of pioneering jazz soloists and as an image to represent jazz music.

<text>A bahuvrihi, or bahuvrihi compound, is a type of compound word that denotes a referent by specifying a certain characteristic or quality the referent possesses. A bahuvrihi is exocentric, so that the compound is not a hyponym of its head. For instance, a sabretooth (&quot;smil-odon&quot;) is neither a sabre nor a tooth, but a feline with sabre-like teeth. &quot;Bahuvrihi&quot; is from , originally referring to fertile land but later denoting the quality of being wealthy or rich.

In Sanskrit bahuvrihis, the last constituent is a noun—more strictly, a nominal stem—while the whole compound is an adjective. In Vedic Sanskrit the accent is regularly on the first member ( &#x27; &quot;a king&#x27;s son&quot;, but bahuvrihi&#x27; &quot;having kings as sons&quot; (lit. king-sons), viz. &#x27;, m., &quot;father of kings&quot;,&#x27;, f., &quot;mother of kings&quot;), with the exception of a number of non-nominal prefixes such as the privative a; the word &quot;&quot; is itself likewise an exception to this rule.

Bahuvrihi compounds are called possessive compounds in English. In English, bahuvrihis can be identified and the last constituent is usually a noun, while the whole compound is a noun or an adjective. The accent is on the first constituent. English bahuvrihis often describe people using synecdoche: &quot;flatfoot&quot;, &quot;half-wit&quot;, &quot;highbrow&quot;, &quot;lowlife&quot;, &quot;redhead&quot;, &quot;tenderfoot&quot;, &quot;long-legs&quot;, and &quot;white-collar&quot;.

In dictionaries and other reference works, the abbreviation &#x27;Bhvr.&#x27; is sometimes used to indicate bahuvrihi compounds.

== Examples ==
=== English ===
* &quot;Houndstooth&quot;, a woven fabric with a patterns resembling dog&#x27;s teeth: &quot;She&#x27;s wearing houndstooth.&quot;
* &quot;Old money&quot;, members from established upper-class who have usually inherited their wealth: &quot;He&#x27;s definitely old money.&quot;
* &quot;Bluestocking&quot;, an educated, intellectual, or artistically accomplished woman: &quot;Auntie Maud will never marry; she&#x27;s a bluestocking.&quot;
* White-collar and blue-collar labor, referring to common colors of uniforms of clerks and workmen respectively early 20th century.
* &quot;Redhead&quot; refers to a ginger haired person.

=== Other languages === 
* and (meaning &quot;shining-mane&quot; and &quot;rime-mane&quot;; two horses in Norse mythology) are two examples of Old Norse bahuvrihis.

<text>Aphanes (parsley-piert) is a genus of around 20 species in the rose family (Rosaceae), native to Europe, Asia and Australia. A 2003 study indicated that &quot;Aphanes&quot; may belong to the genus &quot;Alchemilla&quot;, commonly called lady&#x27;s-mantle. They are slender, annual prostrate herbs, much-branched with deeply lobed leaves, pilose (covered with soft hair) and on short petioles. The tiny green to yellow flowers without petals grow in clusters in the denticulate leaflike stipules.

Species include:
*&quot;Aphanes andicola&quot; 
*&quot;Aphanes arvensis&quot; – field parsley-piert, western lady&#x27;s-mantle, parsley breakstone
*&quot;Aphanes australiana&quot; – Australian piert
*&quot;Aphanes cotopaxiensis&quot; 
*&quot;Aphanes cuneifolia&quot; 
*&quot;Aphanes looseri&quot; 
*&quot;Aphanes microcarpa&quot; (syn. &quot;A. australis&quot;, &quot;A. inexpectata&quot;) – slender parsley-piert

<doc id="842532" wikidata="Q1327643" url="?curid=842532" title="Functional electrical stimulation">
<text>Functional electrical stimulation (FES) is a technique that uses low-energy electrical pulses to artificially generate body movements in individuals who have been paralyzed due to injury to the central nervous system. More specifically, FES can be used to generate muscle contraction in otherwise paralyzed limbs to produce functions such as grasping, walking, bladder voiding and standing. This technology was originally used to develop neuroprostheses that were implemented to permanently substitute impaired functions in individuals with spinal cord injury (SCI), head injury, stroke and other neurological disorders. In other words, a person would use the device each time he or she wanted to generate a desired function. FES is sometimes also referred to as neuromuscular electrical stimulation (NMES).

FES technology has been used to deliver therapies to retrain voluntary motor functions such as grasping, reaching and walking. In this embodiment, FES is used as a short-term therapy, the objective of which is restoration of voluntary function and not lifelong dependence on the FES device, hence the name functional electrical stimulation therapy, FES therapy (FET or FEST). In other words, the FEST is used as a short-term intervention to help an individual&#x27;s central nervous system re-learn how to execute impaired functions, instead of making them dependent on neuroprostheses for the rest of their life. Initial Phase II clinical trials conducted with FEST for reaching and grasping, and walking were carried out at KITE, the research arm of the Toronto Rehabilitation Institute.

==Principles==
Neurons are electrically active cells. In neurons, information is coded and transmitted as a series of electrical impulses called action potentials, which represent a brief change in cell electric potential of approximately 80–90 mV. Nerve signals are frequency modulated; i.e. the number of action potentials that occur in a unit of time is proportional to the intensity of the transmitted signal. Typical action potential frequency is between 4 and 12 Hz. An electrical stimulation can artificially elicit this action potential by changing the electric potential across a nerve cell membrane (this also includes the nerve axon) by inducing electrical charge in the immediate vicinity of the outer membrane of the cell.

FES devices take advantage of this property to electrically activate nerve cells, which then may go on to activate muscles or other nerves. However, special care must be taken in designing safe FES devices, as electric current through tissue can lead to adverse effects such as decrease in excitability or cell death. This may be due to thermal damage, electroporation of the cell membrane, toxic products from electrochemical reactions at the electrode surface, or over-excitation of the targeted neurons or muscles. Typically FES is concerned with stimulation of neurons and nerves. In some applications, FES can be used to directly stimulate muscles, if their peripheral nerves have been severed or damaged (i.e., denervated muscles). However, the majority of the FES systems used today stimulate the nerves or the points where the junction occurs between the nerve and the muscle. The stimulated nerve bundle includes motor nerves (efferent nerves—descending nerves from the central nervous system to muscles) and sensory nerves (afferent nerves—ascending nerves from sensory organs to the central nervous system).

The electrical charge can stimulate both motor and sensory nerves. In some applications, the nerves are stimulated to generate localized muscle activity, i.e., the stimulation is aimed at generating direct muscle contraction. In other applications, stimulation is used to activate simple or complex reflexes. In other words, the afferent nerves are stimulated to evoke a reflex, which is typically expressed as a coordinated contraction of one or more muscles in response to the sensory nerve stimulation.

When a nerve is stimulated, i.e., when sufficient electrical charge is provided to a nerve cell, a localized depolarization of the cell wall occurs resulting in an action potential that propagates toward both ends of the axon. Typically, one &quot;wave&quot; of action potentials will propagate along the axon towards the muscle (orthodromic propagation) and concurrently, as the other &quot;wave&quot; of action potentials will propagate towards the cell body in the central nervous system (antidromic propagation). While the direction of propagation in case of the antidromic stimulation and the sensory nerve stimulation is the same, i.e., towards the central nervous system, their end effects are very different. The antidromic stimulus has been considered an irrelevant side effect of FES. However, in recent years a hypothesis has been presented suggesting the potential role of the antidromic stimulation in neurorehabilitation. Typically, FES is concerned with orthodromic stimulation and uses it to generate coordinated muscle contractions.

In the case where sensory nerves are stimulated, the reflex arcs are triggered by the stimulation on sensory nerve axons at specific peripheral sites. One example of such a reflex is the flexor withdrawal reflex. The flexor withdrawal reflex occurs naturally when a sudden, painful sensation is applied to the sole of the foot. It results in flexion of the hip, knee and ankle of the affected leg, and extension of the contralateral leg in order to get the foot away from the painful stimulus as quickly as possible. The sensory nerve stimulation can be used to generate desired motor tasks, such as evoking flexor withdrawal reflex to facilitate walking in individuals following stroke, or they can be used to alter reflexes or the function of the central nervous system. In the later case, the electrical stimulation is commonly described by the term &quot;neuromodulation&quot;.

Nerves can be stimulated using either surface (transcutaneous) or subcutaneous (percutaneous or implanted) electrodes. The surface electrodes are placed on the skin surface above the nerve or muscle that needs to be &quot;activated&quot;. They are noninvasive, easy to apply, and generally inexpensive. Until recently the common belief in the FES field has been that due to the electrode-skin contact impedance, skin and tissue impedance, and current dispersion during stimulation, much higher-intensity pulses are required to stimulate nerves using surface stimulation electrodes as compared to the subcutaneous electrodes.

(This statement is correct for all commercially available stimulators except MyndMove stimulator (developed my Milos R. Popovic), which has implemented a new stimulation pulse that allows the stimulator to generate muscle contractions without causing discomfort during stimulation, which is a common problem with commercially available transcutaneous electrical stimulation systems, based on US Patents 8,880,178 (2014), 9,440,077 (2016), and 9,592,380 (2016) and related foreign patents.)

A major limitation of the transcutaneous electrical stimulation is that some nerves, for example those innervating the hip flexors, are too profound to be stimulated using surface electrodes. This limitation can be partly addressed by using arrays of electrodes, which can use several electrical contacts to increase selectivity.

Subcutaneous electrodes can be divided into percutaneous and implanted electrodes. The percutaneous electrodes consist of thin wires inserted through the skin and into muscular tissue close to the targeted nerve. These electrodes typically remain in place for a short period of time and are only considered for short-term FES interventions. However, it is worth mentioning that some groups, such as Cleveland FES Center, have been able to safely use percutaneous electrodes with individual patients for months and years at a time. One of the drawbacks of using the percutaneous electrodes is that they are prone to infection and special care has to be taken to prevent such events.

The other class of subcutaneous electrodes is implanted electrodes. These are permanently implanted in the consumer&#x27;s body and remain in the body for the remainder of the consumer&#x27;s life. Compared to surface stimulation electrodes, implanted and percutaneous electrodes potentially have higher stimulation selectivity, which is a desired characteristics of FES systems. To achieve higher selectivity while applying lower stimulation amplitudes, it is recommended that both cathode and anode are in the vicinity of the nerve that is stimulated. The drawbacks of the implanted electrodes are they require an invasive surgical procedure to install, and, as is the case with every surgical intervention, there exists a possibility of infection following implantation.

Typical stimulation protocols used in clinical FES involves trains of electric pulses. Biphasic, charged balanced pulses are employed as they improve the safety of electrical stimulation and minimize some of the adverse effects. Pulse duration, pulse amplitude and pulse frequency are the key parameters that are regulated by the FES devices. The FES devices can be current or voltage regulated. Current regulated FES systems always deliver the same charge to the tissue regardless of the skin/tissue resistance. Because of that, the current regulated FES systems do not require frequent adjustments of the stimulation intensity. The voltage regulated devices may require more frequent adjustments of the stimulation intensity as the charge that they deliver changes as the skin/tissue resistance changes. The properties of the stimulation pulse trains and how many channels are used during stimulation define how complex and sophisticated FES-induced function is. The system can be as simple such as FES systems for muscle strengthening or they can be complex such as FES systems used to deliver simultaneous reaching and grasping, or bipedal locomotion.

==History==
Electrical stimulation had been utilized as far back as ancient Egypt, when it was believed that placing torpedo fish in a pool of water with a human was therapeutic. FES – which involves stimulating the target organ during a functional movement (e.g., walking, reaching for an item) – was initially referred to as &quot;functional electrotherapy&quot; by Liberson. It was not until 1967 that the term &quot;functional electrical stimulation&quot; was coined by Moe and Post, and used in a patent entitled, &quot;Electrical stimulation of muscle deprived of nervous control with a view of providing muscular contraction and producing a functionally useful moment&quot;. Offner&#x27;s patent described a system used to treat foot drop.

The first commercially available FES devices treated foot drop by stimulating the peroneal nerve during gait. In this case, a switch, located in the heel end of a user&#x27;s shoe, would activate a stimulator worn by the user.

== Common applications ==

=== Spinal cord injury ===
Injuries to the spinal cord interfere with electrical signals between the brain and the muscles, resulting in paralysis below the level of injury. Restoration of limb function as well as regulation of organ function are the main application of FES, although FES is also used for treatment of pain, pressure, sore prevention, etc. Some examples of FES applications involve the use of neuroprostheses that allow the people with paraplegia to walk, stand, restore hand grasp function in people with quadriplegia, or restore bowel and bladder function. High intensity FES of the quadriceps muscles allows patients with complete lower motor neuron lesion to increase their muscle mass, muscle fiber diameter, improve ultrastructural organization of contractile material, increase of force output during electrical stimulation and perform FES assisted stand-up exercises. Regeneration associated genes (RAG) expression, responsible for axonal outgrowth and survival, is promoted with administration of FES.

==== Walking in spinal cord injury ====
Kralj and his colleagues described a technique for paraplegic gait using surface stimulation, which remains the most popular method in use today. Electrodes are placed over the quadriceps muscles and peroneal nerves bilaterally. The user controls the neuroprosthesis with two pushbuttons attached to the left and right handles of a walking frame, or on canes or crutches. When the neuroprosthesis is turned on, both quadriceps muscles are stimulated to provide a standing posture.

Kralj&#x27;s approach was extended by Graupe et al. into a digital FES system that employs the power of digital signal processing to result in the Parastep FES system, based on US Patents 5,014,705 (1991), 5,016,636 (1991), 5,070,873 (1991), 5,081,989 (1992), 5,092,329 (1992) and related foreign patents. The Parastep system became the first FES system for standing and walking to receive the US FDA approval (FDA, PMA P900038, 1994) and become commercially available.

The Parastep&#x27;s digital design allows a considerable reduction in rate of patient-fatigue by drastically reducing of stimulation pulse-width (100–140 microseconds) and pulse-rate (12–24 per sec.), to result, in walking times of 20–60 minutes and average walking distances of 450 meters per walk, for adequately trained thoracic-level complete paraplegics patients who complete training that includes daily treadmill sessions, with some patients exceeding one mile per walk. Also, Parestep-based walking was reported to result in several medical and psychological benefits, including restoration of near-normal blood flow to lower extremities and holding of bone density decline.

Walking performance with the Parastep system greatly depends on rigorous upper body conditioning-training and on a completing 3–5 months of a daily one–two-hour training program which includes 30 of more minutes of treadmill training.

An alternative approach to the above techniques is the FES system for walking developed using the Compex Motion neuroprosthesis, by Popovic et al. The Compex Motion neuroprosthesis for walking is an eight to sixteen channel surface FES system used to restore voluntary walking in stroke and spinal cord injury individuals. This system does not apply peroneal nerve stimulation to enable locomotion. Instead, it activates all relevant lower limb muscles in a sequence similar to the one that brain uses to enable locomotion. The hybrid assistive systems (HAS) and the RGO walking neuroprostheses are devices that also apply active and passive braces, respectively. The braces were introduced to provide additional stability during standing and walking. A major limitation of neuroprostheses for walking that are based on surface stimulation is that the hip flexors cannot be stimulated directly. Therefore, hip flexion during walking must come from voluntary effort, which is often absent in paraplegia, or from the flexor withdrawal reflex. Implanted systems have the advantage of being able to stimulate the hip flexors, and therefore, to provide better muscle selectivity and potentially better gait patterns. Hybrid systems with exoskeleton have been also proposed to solve this problem. These technologies have been found to be successful and promising, but at the present time these FES systems are mostly used for exercise purposes and seldom as an alternative to wheelchair mobility.

=== Stroke and upper limb recovery ===
Peripheral nerves have a regeneration rate of ~1mm per day. With nerve injury often requiring a large distance of restoration, down-regulation of regenerative mechanisms over time limits nerve proliferation. In the acute stage of stroke recovery, the use of cyclic electrical stimulation has been seen to increase the isometric strength of wrist extensors. In order to increase strength of wrist extensors, there must be a degree of motor function at the wrist spared following the stroke and have significant hemiplegia. Patients who will elicit benefits of cyclic electrical stimulation of the wrist extensors must be highly motivated to follow through with treatment. After 8 weeks of electrical stimulation, an increase in grip strength can be apparent. Many scales, which assess the level of disability of the upper extremities following a stroke, use grip strength as a common item. Therefore, increasing strength of wrist extensors will decrease the level of upper extremity disability.

Patients with hemiplegia following a stroke commonly experience shoulder pain and subluxation; both of which will interfere with the rehabilitation process. Functional electrical stimulation has been found to be effective for the management of pain and reduction of shoulder subluxation, as well as accelerating the degree and rate of motor recovery. Furthermore, the benefits of FES are maintained over time; research has demonstrated that the benefits are maintained for at least 24 months.

A systematic review was done to assess three types of functional electronic stimulation (FES) used in post stroke upper limb rehab and compare them to patients that did not use any FES. The types focused on were manual FES, BCI-FES, and EMG-FES. Studies showed that when comparing clinical scores in post stroke patients who used FES versus patients that did not, the patients that used FES had more functional benefits. The scores suggested that FES decreases spasticity of wrist flexors as compared to non-FES and motor outcomes showed improved recovery in upper extremities, specifically when using the BCI-FES system. In the end the study showed that it is difficult to say which specific FES system is best. Many research studies showed that closed-loop FES, or BCI/EMG, are more beneficial than open-loop FES, or manual, for motor recovery. Among closed-loop FES, which system is more effective (either BCI-FES or EMG-FES) remains unspecified, because as of right now no randomized controlled clinical trial has been conducted to directly compare the two and their benefits when in the context of neurorehabilitation. An open-loop FES has been widely used clinically for many years when treating post stroke patients, whereas closed-loop FES is typically applied in the laboratory setting as a research protocol (especially BCI-FES).

=== Drop foot ===
Drop foot is a common symptom in hemiplegia, characterized by a lack of dorsiflexion during the swing phase of gait, resulting in short, shuffling strides. It has been shown that FES can be used to effectively compensate for the drop foot during the swing phase of the gait. At the moment just before the heel off phase of gait occurs, the stimulator delivers a stimulus to the common peroneal nerve, which results in contraction of the muscles responsible for dorsiflexion. There are currently a number of drop foot stimulators that use surface and implanted FES technologies. Drop foot stimulators have been used successfully with various patient populations, such as stroke, spinal cord injury and multiple sclerosis.

The term &quot;orthotic effect&quot; can be used to describe the immediate improvement in function observed when the individual switches on their FES device compared to unassisted walking. This improvement disappears as soon as the person switches off their FES device. In contrast, a &quot;training&quot; or &quot;therapeutic effect&quot; is used to describe a long term improvement or restoration of function following a period of using the device which is still present even when the device is switched off. A further complication to measuring an orthotic effect and any long term training or therapeutic effects is the presence of a so-called &quot;temporary carry over effect&quot;. Liberson et al., 1961 was the first to observe that some stroke patients appeared to benefit from a temporary improvement in function and were able to dorsiflex their foot for up to an hour after the electrical stimulation had been turned off. It has been hypothesised that this temporary improvement in function may be linked to a long term training or therapeutic effect. 

=== Stroke ===
Hemiparetic stroke patients, who are impacted by the denervation, muscular atrophy, and spasticity, typically experience an abnormal gait pattern due to muscular weakness and the incapacity to voluntary contract certain ankle and hip muscles at the appropriate walking phase. Liberson et al. (1961) were the first to pioneer FES in stroke patients. More recently, there have been a number of studies that have been conducted in this area. A systematic review conducted in 2012 on the use of FES in chronic stroke included seven randomized controlled trials with a total of 231 participants. The review found a small treatment effect for using FES for the 6-minute walking test.

=== Multiple sclerosis ===
FES has also been found to be useful for treating foot drop in people with multiple sclerosis. The first use was reported in 1977 by Carnstam et al., who found that it was possible to generate strength increases through using peroneal stimulation. A more recent study examined the use of FES compared to an exercise group and found that although there was an orthotic effect for the FES group, no training effect in walking speed was found. Further qualitative analysis including all participants from the same study found improvements in activities of daily living and a reduced number of falls for those using FES compared with exercise. A further small scale (n=32) longitudinal observational study has found evidence for a significant training effect through using FES.
With NMES treatment there were measurable gains in ambulatory function.

However, a further large observational study (n=187) was supportive of previous findings and found a significant improvement in orthotic effect for walking speed.

=== Cerebral palsy ===
FES has been found to be useful for treating the symptoms of cerebral palsy. A recent randomised controlled trial (n=32) found significant orthotic and training effects for children with unilateral spastic cerebral palsy. Improvements were found in gastrocnemius spasticity, community mobility and balance skills. A recent comprehensive literature review of the area of using electrical stimulation and FES to treat children with disabilities mostly included studies on children with cerebral palsy. The reviewers summarised the evidence as the treatment having the potential to improve a number of different areas including muscle mass and strength, spasticity, passive range of motion, upper extremity function, walking speed, positioning of the foot and ankle kinematics. The review further concludes that adverse events were rare and the technology is safe and well tolerated by this population. The applications of FES for children with cerebral palsy are similar to those for adults. Some common applications of FES devices include stimulation of muscles whilst mobilizing to strengthen muscle activity, to reduce muscle spasticity, to facilitate initiation of muscle activity, or to provide a memory of movement.

=== National Institute for Health and Care Excellence Guidelines (NICE) (UK) ===
NICE have issued full guidelines on the treatment of drop foot of central neurological origin (IPG278). NICE have stated that &quot;current evidence on the safety and efficacy (in terms of improving gait) of functional electrical stimulation (FES) for drop foot of central neurological origin appears adequate to support the use of this procedure provided that normal arrangements are in place for clinical governance, consent and audit&quot;.

<text>TIBCO Rendezvous is a software product that provides a message bus for enterprise application integration (EAI).

==Details==
TIBCO provides messaging APIs in C, C++, Java, Visual Basic, Perl and .NET to provide messaging between two or more services.

The basic message passing is conceptually simple:
* A message has a single subject composed of elements separated by periods. A message is sent to a single Rendezvous Daemon (though it may end up being broadcast onto Daemons).
* A listener announces its subjects of interest to a Daemon (with a basic wildcard facility) and messages with matching subjects are delivered to it if the two daemons are &#x27;connected&#x27; to each other (or indeed the same daemon).

Considerable &quot;Enterprise&quot; functionality is layered onto this if desired with Fault Tolerance/Reliable or Certified options possible, all implemented through the underlying basic messages.

The messages themselves can be viewed as typed name-value fields and/or number-value fields (the two identification mechanisms within a message can mix and match with certain restrictions). A message can itself contain sub-messages which themselves may contain sub-messages, and so on.

The quality of the respective API implementations varies considerably. The C++ library is simply a wrapper providing an OO view over the C implementation. Likewise the Java and .NET implementations wrap the C++ implementation. This has led to memory management issues with the .NET implementation (though not with the COM Interop version which is considerably more cumbersome).

<text>Adrien-Henri de Jussieu (23 December 1797 – 29 June 1853) was a French botanist.

Born in Paris as the son of botanist Antoine Laurent de Jussieu, he received the degree of Doctor of Medicine in 1824 with a treatise of the plant family Euphorbiaceae. When his father retired in 1826, he succeeded him at the Jardin des Plantes; in 1845 he became professor of organography of plants. He was also president of the French Academy of Sciences. De Jussieu was elected a Foreign Honorary Member of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences in 1850.

His main publications were the &quot;Cours élémentaire de botanique&quot; (Paris) and the &quot;Géographie botanique&quot; (Paris, 1846), as well as several monographs, most notably the one on the family Malpighiaceae. In botanical references, he is usually abbreviated as Adr. Juss., also sometimes as A. Juss., as his father already has the abbreviation Juss.

The asteroid 9470 Jussieu was named in honor of the de Jussieu family.

In 1825, the French botanist Charles Gaudichaud-Beaupré published &quot;Adriana&quot;, a genus of Australian shrubs in the family Euphorbiaceae named in honour of Jussieu.

<text>Llanfynydd is a village, parish and community in Carmarthenshire, Wales. The community population at the 2011 census was 499. It lies some 10 miles (16 km) north-east of the county town, Carmarthen. Bordering it are the communities of Llansawel, Talley, Manordeilo and Salem, Llangathen, Llanegwad and Llanfihangel Rhos-y-Corn, all in Carmarthenshire.

==Heritage==
The Church in Wales parish church is a Grade II* listed building dedicated to St Egwad, a 7th-century bishop in Wales. The tower, probably the earliest part, dates from about 1400. The north aisle was added in the 16th century. The building was restored in 1861, when further windows were added. The only indication of a previous church further up the valley is in the name of a farm: Bryn-Yr-Eglwys (&quot;Hill of the Church&quot;).

In 1844 Llanfynydd was a parish of 11,000 acres and 1,358 inhabitants in Cathinog Hundred. By 1929 the population was down to 581.

===Worship===
Parish registers exist from 1692. The parish also has several chapels.

===Education===
D. Jones, a local clergyman, established a day school in Llanfynydd in 1738, for 20 children.

The number of pupils at the school had fallen to 11 by September 2013, with a deficit of £50,000, and Carmarthenshire County Council warned that the school would close if numbers fell below 10.

However, in December 2014 the BBC reported that though the school had no pupils, it could not be closed until the county council had held a consultation and a vote on the issue.

==Public protest==
In July 2004, in protest over plans to erect a wind farm nearby, the residents of Llanfynydd renamed their village &quot;Llanhyfryddawelllehynafolybarcudprindanfygythiadtrienusyrhafnauole&quot;
(&quot;lovely silent church, ancient place of the rare kite under wretched threat from misplaced blades&quot;) for the space of one week.

The name was chosen to reflect villagers&#x27; concern that the wind farm would threaten three endangered species of bird (the red kite, the curlew, and the skylark) and to generate publicity for their cause by being longer than the previously longest place name in the UK: that of Llanfairpwllgwyngyllgogerychwyrndrobwllllantysiliogogogoch in Anglesey.

The protest went ahead despite assurances from the local council and from the Spanish-owned developers Gamesa Energy UK (part of Gamesa Corporación Tecnológica) that the single wind turbine planned was intended merely as a test to see how suitable the area might be for wind turbines in the future.

==Notable people==
* John Dyer (1699–1757), a painter and Welsh poet who became a priest in the Church of England
* Thomas Rees (1815–1885), Congregational minister and historian of nonconformity, was born at Pen Pontbren, Llanfynydd; twice elected to chair the Union of Welsh Independents.

<doc id="842554" wikidata="Q921021" url="?curid=842554" title="Leka, Prince of Albania">
<text>Leka, Prince of Albania (Leka Anwar Zog Reza Baudouin Msiziwe Zogu, born 26 March 1982) is the current head of the House of Zogu, the former royal family of Albania.

At the time of his birth on 26 March 1982, the South African government, by order of Prime Minister P. W. Botha, declared his maternity ward extraterritorial land, to ensure that Leka was born on Albanian soil. Leka is the only child of Leka, Crown Prince of Albania and his wife Susan, Crown Princess of Albania. He is the only grandchild of King Zog I of the Albanians, succeeding as head of the royal house upon the death of his father in 2011. He has worked as an official at the country&#x27;s interior and foreign ministries. He also served as a political advisor to the Albanian President from 2012 to 2013.

In May 2010, Leka became engaged to Elia Zaharia, an Albanian actress and singer. They married on 8 October 2016 in Tirana. In January 2024, they revealed they were getting a divorce.

==Early life==
Leka is the son of the pretender to the defunct throne of Albania, Crown Prince Leka, and his Australian wife Crown Princess Susan.

He was named in honour of Egyptian president Anwar El Sadat, his grandfather King Zog I, Emperor Mohammed Reza of Iran, and Baudouin I, King of the Belgians. Msiziwe is a Zulu term meaning &#x27;the one who was assisted&#x27;. Leka is a member of the House of Zogu.

==Education and activities==
Leka was educated in South Africa at St Peter&#x27;s College, Johannesburg, and in the United Kingdom at the Royal Military Academy Sandhurst, where he was named Best Foreign Student of the Academy, being congratulated by the Albanian Minister of Defence. He was also educated at the Skanderbeg Military Academy in Albania, at the Università per Stranieri in Perugia, where he studied the Italian language, and in Kosovo, where he studied international relations.

On 5 April 2004, Leka accepted the Mother Teresa Medal on behalf of his late grandmother, Queen Géraldine, for her humanitarian efforts.

Leka is known to have worked with youth organizations, like MJAFT!, and supported a wide range of humanitarian efforts in Albania, but he maintains that he only supports self-help projects to stimulate Albanian and Kosovar economic growth, Gazeta Sot.

Leka is known as a supporter of Kosovar independence from Serbia and has close ties to the Kosovar leadership in Pristina.

Leka founded the youth leadership of the Movement for National Development, which was a movement created by his father in 2005 to change the political face of Albania.

On 24 June 2010, Prince Leka unveiled a blue plaque at Parmoor House in Buckinghamshire, United Kingdom, which was the home of King Zog during his wartime exile.

==Public service==
On 21 August 2007, Foreign Minister Lulzim Basha announced that Leka had been appointed to his office. The prince intended to pursue a career in diplomacy. After three years he was transferred to the office of the Minister of Interior. After the election of Bujar Nishani as president in 2012, Leka was appointed as political adviser to the President.

Leka was rumoured to be a candidate in the 2022 Albanian presidential election though no candidates were disclosed and the position ultimately went to Bajram Begaj.

==Personal life==
Leka met Elia Zaharia in Paris, and in May 2010 they were engaged. Since then she accompanied him on most of his visits and meetings with members of royal families. She is also head of the Queen Geraldine Foundation, which is a humanitarian, charitable and non-profit organisation, created by the Royal Court. The foundation aims to be close to Albanian families who need help and to children who need care. It has reconstructed numerous schools and kindergartens in northern Albania, especially in the Mat District, from where the Zogu Family comes.

On 27 March 2016 it was announced by Skënder Zogu (born 1933), a member of the Zogu family, that the couple would be married on 8 October 2016 in the Royal Palace in Tirana.

===Wedding===

Leka was married on Saturday 8 October 2016 in Tirana. The ceremony was a semi-official ceremony, held in Tirana in the Royal Palace, with many guests including members of other noble and royal families. The event was a civil wedding officiated by the Mayor of Tirana, Erion Veliaj. A blessing was given by the five religious leaders of Albania representing the faiths of Sunni Islam, Bektashi, and the Christian traditions of Orthodox, Catholic and Protestant. This tradition of the Albanian royal family is part of the tradition of religious tolerance in Albania.

Wedding guests included friends and relatives from around the world including relatives of his mother from Australia. Guests also included members of other royal families from neighbouring countries and further afield. These included Queen Sofía of Spain and Prince and Princess Michael of Kent. Prince Michael of Kent is a first cousin of Queen Elizabeth II and his wife Princess Michael of Kent is related to Prince Leka through her mother, Countess Marianne Szapáry, who was a 5th cousin of Queen Géraldine and had been a bridesmaid at her wedding to King Zog in 1938. Other royal guests included Empress Farah of Iran, Crown Prince Alexander and Crown Princess Katherine of Yugoslavia, Crown Princess Margareta of Romania, Custodian of the Crown and Prince Radu of Romania, Nicholas, Prince of Montenegro, Prince Guillaume of Luxembourg together with Princess Sibilla, Georg Friedrich, Prince of Prussia, Princess Léa of Belgium and other members from the royal families of Russia, Liechtenstein, Romania, Greece, Georgia, Morocco and members of other noble families. Heads of state of Albania also attended the ceremony.

===Divorce===
It was announced on their Instagram page on 15 January 2024 that Prince Leka and Elia would be getting a mutual divorce as their marriage was no longer functioning. Leka confirmed plans for the divorce two days prior on his personal Instagram page as well.

They divorced on 25 April 2024.

===Children===
Elia gave birth to a daughter on 22 October 2020 at Queen Geraldine Maternity Hospital in Tirana, on the 18th anniversary of Leka&#x27;s grandmother Queen Geraldine&#x27;s death. Their daughter was named Geraldine in her honour. On 28 January 2023, on the day of her baptism, her full name is Geraldine Sibilla Francesca Susan Marie, and her godparents are Princess Sibilla of Luxembourg and Thomas Frashëri, a family friend.

<text>Enterprise application integration (EAI) is the use of software and computer systems&#x27; architectural principles to integrate a set of enterprise computer applications.

== Overview ==
Enterprise application integration is an integration framework composed of a collection of technologies and services which form a middleware or &quot;middleware framework&quot; to enable integration of systems and applications across an enterprise.

Many types of business software such as supply chain management applications, ERP systems, CRM applications for managing customers, business intelligence applications, payroll, and human resources systems typically cannot communicate with one another in order to share data or business rules. For this reason, such applications are sometimes referred to as islands of automation or information silos. This lack of communication leads to inefficiencies, wherein identical data are stored in multiple locations, or straightforward processes are unable to be automated.

Enterprise application integration is the process of linking such applications within a single organization together in order to simplify and automate business processes to the greatest extent possible, while at the same time avoiding having to make sweeping changes to the existing applications or data structures. Applications can be linked either at the back-end via APIs or (seldom) the front-end (GUI).

In the words of research firm Gartner: &quot;[EAI is] the unrestricted sharing of data and business processes among any connected application or data sources in the enterprise.&quot;

The various systems that need to be linked together may reside on different operating systems, use different database solutions or computer languages, or different date and time formats, or could be legacy systems that are no longer supported by the vendor who originally created them. In some cases, such systems are dubbed &quot;stovepipe systems&quot; because they consist of components that have been jammed together in a way that makes it very hard to modify them in any way.

=== Improving connectivity ===
If integration is applied without following a structured EAI approach, point-to-point connections grow across an organization. Dependencies are added on an impromptu basis, resulting in a complex structure that is difficult to maintain. This is commonly referred to as spaghetti, an allusion to the programming equivalent of spaghetti code.

For example, the number of connections needed to have fully meshed point-to-point connections, with points, is given by formula_1 (see binomial coefficient). Thus, for ten applications to be fully integrated point-to-point, formula_2 point-to-point connections are needed, following a quadratic growth pattern.

However, the number of connections within organizations does not necessarily grow according to the square of the number of points. In general, the number of connections to any point is only limited by the number of other points in an organization, but can be significantly smaller in principle. EAI can also increase coupling between systems and therefore increase management overhead and costs.

EAI is not just about sharing data between applications but also focuses on sharing both business data and business processes. A middleware analyst attending to EAI will often look at the system of systems.

=== Purposes ===
EAI can be used for different purposes:

*Data integration: Ensures that information in multiple systems is kept consistent. This is also known as enterprise information integration (EII).
*Vendor independence: Extracts business policies or rules from applications and implements them in the EAI system, so that even if one of the business applications is replaced with a different vendor&#x27;s application, the business rules do not have to be re-implemented.
*Common facade: An EAI system can front-end a cluster of applications, providing a single consistent access interface to these applications and shielding users from having to learn to use different software packages.

=== Patterns ===
This section describes common design patterns for implementing EAI, including integration, access and lifetime patterns. These are abstract patterns and can be implemented in many different ways. There are many other patterns commonly used in the industry, ranging from high-level abstract design patterns to highly specific implementation patterns.

==== Integration patterns ====
EAI systems implement two patterns:

;Mediation (intra-communication):Here, the EAI system acts as the go-between or broker between multiple applications. Whenever an interesting event occurs in an application (for instance, new information is created or a new transaction completed) an integration module in the EAI system is notified. The module then propagates the changes to other relevant applications.
;Federation (inter-communication):In this case, the EAI system acts as the overarching facade across multiple applications. All event calls from the &#x27;outside world&#x27; to any of the applications are front-ended by the EAI system. The EAI system is configured to expose only the relevant information and interfaces of the underlying applications to the outside world, and performs all interactions with the underlying applications on behalf of the requester.

Both patterns are often used concurrently. The same EAI system could be keeping multiple applications in sync (mediation), while servicing requests from external users against these applications (federation).

==== Access patterns ====
EAI supports both asynchronous (fire and forget) and synchronous access patterns, the former being typical in the mediation case and the latter in the federation case.

==== Lifetime patterns ====
An integration operation could be short-lived (e.g., keeping data in sync across two applications could be completed within a second) or long-lived (e.g., one of the steps could involve the EAI system interacting with a human work flow application for approval of a loan that takes hours or days to complete).

=== Topologies ===
There are two major topologies: hub-and-spoke, and bus. Each has its own advantages and disadvantages. In the hub-and-spoke model, the EAI system is at the center (the hub), and interacts with the applications via the spokes. In the bus model, the EAI system is the bus (or is implemented as a resident module in an already existing message bus or message-oriented middleware).

Most large enterprises use zoned networks to create a layered defense against network oriented threats. For example, an enterprise typically has a credit card processing (PCI-compliant) zone, a non-PCI zone, a data zone, a DMZ zone to proxy external user access, and an IWZ zone to proxy internal user access. Applications need to integrate across multiple zones. The Hub and spoke model would work better in this case.

=== Technologies ===
Multiple technologies are used in implementing each of the components of the EAI system:
;Bus/hub: This is usually implemented by enhancing standard middleware products (application server, message bus) or implemented as a stand-alone program (i. e., does not use any middleware), acting as its own middleware.
;Application connectivity: The bus/hub connects to applications through a set of adapters (also referred to as connectors). These are programs that know how to interact with an underlying business application. The adapter performs one-way communication(unidirectional), performing requests from the hub against the application, and notifying the hub when an event of interest occurs in the application (a new record inserted, a transaction completed, etc.). Adapters can be specific to an application (e. g., built against the application vendor&#x27;s client libraries) or specific to a class of applications (e. g., can interact with any application through a standard communication protocol, such as SOAP, SMTP or Action Message Format (AMF)). The adapter could reside in the same process space as the bus/hub or execute in a remote location and interact with the hub/bus through industry-standard protocols such as message queues, web services, or even use a proprietary protocol. In the Java world, standards such as JCA allow adapters to be created in a vendor-neutral manner.
;Data format and transformation: To avoid every adapter having to convert data to/from every other application&#x27;s formats, EAI systems usually stipulate an application-independent (or common) data format. The EAI system usually provides a data transformation service as well to help convert between application-specific and common formats. This is done in two steps: the adapter converts information from the application&#x27;s format to the bus&#x27;s common format. Then, semantic transformations are applied to this (converting zip codes to city names, splitting/merging objects from one application into objects in the other applications, and so on).
;Integration modules: An EAI system could be participating in multiple concurrent integration operations at any given time, each type of integration being processed by a different integration module. Integration modules subscribe to events of specific types and process notifications that they receive when these events occur. These modules could be implemented in different ways: on Java-based EAI systems, these could be web applications or EJBs or even POJOs that conform to the EAI system&#x27;s specifications.
;Support for transactions: When used for process integration, the EAI system also provides transactional consistency across applications by executing all integration operations across all applications in a single overarching distributed transaction (using two-phase commit protocols or compensating transactions).

=== Communication architectures ===
Currently, there are many variations of thought on what constitutes the best infrastructure, component model, and standards structure for Enterprise Application Integration. There seems to be a consensus that four components are essential for a modern enterprise application integration architecture:
#A centralized broker that handles security, access, and communication. This can be accomplished through integration servers (like the School Interoperability Framework (SIF) Zone Integration Servers) or through similar software like the enterprise service bus (ESB) model that acts as a services manager.
#An independent data model based on a standard data structure, also known as a canonical data model. It appears that XML and the use of XML style sheets have become the &quot;de facto&quot; and in some cases &quot;de jure&quot; standard for this uniform business language.
#A connector, or agent model where each vendor, application, or interface can build a single component that can speak natively to that application and communicate with the centralized broker.
#A system model that defines the APIs, data flow and rules of engagement to the system such that components can be built to interface with it in a standardized way.

Although other approaches like connecting at the database or user-interface level have been explored, they have not been found to scale or be able to adjust. Individual applications can publish messages to the centralized broker and subscribe to receive certain messages from that broker. Each application only requires one connection to the broker. This central control approach can be extremely scalable and highly evolvable.

Enterprise Application Integration is related to middleware technologies such as message-oriented middleware (MOM), and data representation technologies such as XML or JSON. Other EAI technologies involve using web services as part of service-oriented architecture as a means of integration. Enterprise Application Integration tends to be data centric. In the near future, it will come to include content integration and business processes.

=== Implementation pitfalls ===
In 2003 it was reported that 70% of all EAI projects fail. Most of these failures are not due to the software itself or technical difficulties, but due to management issues. Integration Consortium European Chairman Steve Craggs has outlined the seven main pitfalls undertaken by companies using EAI systems and explains solutions to these problems.

#Constant change: The very nature of EAI is dynamic and requires dynamic project managers to manage their implementation.
#Shortage of EAI experts: EAI requires knowledge of many issues and technical aspects.
#Competing standards: Within the EAI field, the paradox is that EAI standards themselves are not universal.
#EAI is a tool paradigm: EAI is not a tool, but rather a system and should be implemented as such.
#Building interfaces is an art: Engineering the solution is not sufficient. Solutions need to be negotiated with user departments to reach a common consensus on the final outcome. A lack of consensus on interface designs leads to excessive effort to map between various systems&#x27; data requirements.
#Loss of detail: Information that seemed unimportant at an earlier stage may become crucial later.
#Accountability: Since so many departments have many conflicting requirements, there should be clear accountability for the system&#x27;s final structure.

Other potential problems may arise in these areas:
*Lack of centralized co-ordination of EAI work.
*Emerging Requirements: EAI implementations should be extensible and modular to allow for future changes.
*Protectionism: The applications whose data is being integrated often belong to different departments that have technical, cultural, and political reasons for not wanting to share their data with other departments

<text>&quot;Wulf and Eadwacer&quot; (, approximately ) is an Old English poem in alliterative verse of famously difficult interpretation. It has been variously characterised, (modernly) as an elegy, (historically) as a riddle, and (in speculation on the poem&#x27;s pre-history) as a song or ballad with refrain. The poem is narrated in the first person, most likely with a woman&#x27;s voice. Because the audience is given so little information about her situation, some scholars argue the story was well-known, and that the unnamed speaker corresponds to named figures from other stories, for example, to Signý or that the characters Wulf and Eadwacer correspond to Theoderic the Great and his rival Odoacer. The poem&#x27;s only extant text is found at folios 100v-101r in the tenth-century Exeter Book, alongside other texts to which it possesses qualitative similarities.

==Synopsis==

The speaker of the poem is arguably separated from her lover and/or husband, Wulf, both symbolically and materially (&#x27;Wulf is on iege, ic on oþerre&#x27; [Wulf is on an island, I on another]), and this separation is seemingly maintained by threat of violence (&#x27;willað hy hine aþecgan&#x27; [they will want to ?seize him]), possibly by her own people (&#x27;Leodum is minum swylce him mon lac gife&#x27; [it is to my people as though someone will give him/them a gift/sacrifice]). Crying out in her sorrow for her lover, she longs for him to take her in his arms (&#x27;þonne mec se beaducafa bogum bilegde&#x27; [then/when the battle-bold one laid his arms around me]). She finds comfort in his coming, but it is also bittersweet (&#x27;wæs me wyn to þon, wæs me hwæþre eac lað&#x27; [there was joy to me in that; it was also hateful to me]). She then addresses &#x27;Eadwacer&#x27;, who may be her husband or her captor, and she appears to identify their &#x27;whelp&#x27; (&#x27;Uncerne earne hwelp&#x27; [our wretched whelp]), generally understood to metaphorically imply &#x27;child&#x27; and possibly a reference to the child&#x27;s being the &#x27;whelp&#x27; of a man named &#x27;Wulf&#x27;. She describes this child as being taken off &#x27;to the woods&#x27; (&quot;to wuda&quot;).

==Text and translation==
In &quot;Wulf and Eadwacer&quot; there are a significant number of words which are obscure in meaning (e.g. &quot;aþecgan&quot;, &quot;dogode&quot;, and &quot;þreat&quot;). The rest of its vocabulary, while appearing straightforward, may be unclear as to precise meaning, or even deliberately ambiguous. This provides a problem for translators. The following translation is by Elaine Treharne:
Another scholarly translation, by Ian Shiels, that tries to indicate most of the ambiguities in the text is the following:
==Characters==

The most conventional interpretation of the poem is as a lament spoken in the first person by an unnamed woman who is or has in the past been involved with two men whose names are &quot;Wulf&quot; and &quot;Eadwacer&quot; respectively. Both of these are attested Anglo-Saxon names, and this interpretation is the basis for the common titling of the poem (which is not based on any other manuscript evidence). However, even this point proves controversial. Some interpretations favour a single male character, and virtually all commentaries acknowledge the possibility, though this is the less orthodox of the two views. In recognition of this fact, for example, preeminent Old English scholar Michael Alexander has chosen the title &quot;Wulf&quot; for his own reproduction of it in &quot;The Earliest English Poems&quot; (Penguin, 1973). It has also been known to be titled simply as &quot;Eadwacer&quot;. The title &quot;Wulf and Eadwacer&quot;, however, though editorial, has gained such widespread acceptance over time that in the majority of texts it is accepted regardless of the treatment of the titular name(s) and character(s).

==Genre==
For lack of any historical evidence or attestation outside the Exeter Book&#x27;s text, historical criticism is limited to study of the Exeter Book itself and, particularly, to comparative study of its various contained works. Though it is generally held that the poem&#x27;s composition occurred at a date significantly earlier than the date of the Exeter Book&#x27;s own compilation, the degree of the poem&#x27;s age relative to the codex is difficult if not impossible to ascertain. The dating of the poem in criticism is thus generally limited to what can be ascertained from the known history of the Exeter Book, for which suggested dates of compilation range from 960CE to 990CE. Though the folios on which the poem is recorded are not subject to any significant damage necessitating reconstruction, its textual problems and, particularly, the grammatical confusion of the first lines of the text, have resulted in widespread postulation that the initial lines of the poem may have been lost prior to its inclusion in the Exeter Book but subsequent to an earlier transcription. However, there is no manuscript evidence to directly support this theory. The characterization of the poem as a riddle is the oldest of its various treatments, the argument for which characterization is based largely upon the obscurity of its subject and the placement of the poem within the Exeter Book, where it was included as &quot;Riddle I&quot; in Benjamin Thorpe&#x27;s 1842 translation of the Exeter Book. Additionally, Thorpe left &quot;Wulf and Eadwacer&quot; untranslated, and he notes &quot;Of this, I can make no sense, nor am I able to arrange the verses&quot;. However, its length and its various textual problems not characteristic of the riddles have led few scholars to pursue a simple riddle interpretation in modern textual study, and few such explanations have garnered serious attention in the recent history of its scholarship. Rather, the thematic similarity of the poem to &quot;The Wife&#x27;s Lament&quot;, also found in the Exeter Book, has caused most modern scholars to place it, along with the &quot;Wife&#x27;s Lament&quot;, solidly within the genre of the &quot;Frauenlied&quot;, or woman&#x27;s song and, more broadly, in that of the Old English elegy. These two poems are also used as examples of the female voice in broadening early feminist literary history. However, &quot;Wulf and Eadwacer&#x27;s&quot; adjacency to the riddles has continued to inform commentary and interpretation.

==Manuscript evidence==

Proposals regarding its heritage prior to inscription in the Exeter codex are consequently many and various. The inclusion of a refrain in the text of the poem may support an originally non-English origin, as the refrain is not conventional to the Old English elegy or to any other known Old English poetical form. Among proposed explanations for this anomaly, a Scandinavian inspiration for the Anglo-Saxon text offers one possible solution to this problem, and has similarly been considered as an explanation for its difficult language, but this theory, as with most others on the poem&#x27;s prehistory, can only be regarded as hypothetical given lack of substantive corroborating evidence. The suggestion is that the poem derives from some interpretation of the Wayland story; that the woman is Beadohilde, Wulf is Wayland, and Eadwacer her angry father. This episode is also discussed in the poem &quot;Deor&quot;.

== Differing interpretations ==
Even though the poem is a mere nineteen lines there are many differing interpretations, not least because the poem contains several obscure words and some ambiguous grammar. One interpreter considers that the word &quot;Eadwacer&quot; in the poem is not a proper noun, but a simple common noun which means &quot;property watcher&quot;. This brings the characters in the poem from three to two, the speaker and her lover, Wulf. If one adopts this interpretation then her exclamation (&quot;Do you hear me, Eadwacer?&quot;) could be meant to be sarcastic or a calling out of his manhood. She is saying that his long absences have made him anything but a protector to her and their child whom she worries about. Using this interpretation, the speaker&#x27;s use of irony when speaking of her lover makes the last two lines make sense. The speaker may be saying that Wulf has been her lover and her child&#x27;s father, but has never treated her as or actually been her husband. Therefore, the complications of their relationship is easily unbound. However, this seems to be more easily done by Wulf than the speaker herself (Adams).

While debatable among scholars, some argue the character of Wulf is the speaker&#x27;s child and not her lover. In this instance, she could be lamenting after her son, hoping that he was safe, or mourning his death. One scholar says:In Wulf and Eadwacer a woman finds herself in a situation typical of Old English poetry, torn between conflicting loyalties. Many commentators see this particular situation as a sexual triangle, with Wulf the woman’s lover and Eadwacer her husband. If so, then Wulf and Eadwacer is not typical, because most Old English loyalty crises occur within the family group…It is…true that romantic or sexual love was not the literary commonplace before the twelfth century it has been since; other loves took precedence…The situation in Wulf and Eadwacer is far more typically Anglo-Saxon than as usually interpreted, if the speaker is understood to be the mother of the person she addresses as Wulf, as well as of the &#x27;whelp&#x27; of line 16.His argument that Wulf is actually the narrator’s son gives a different depth to the elegy—it becomes a poem of mourning for her son that seems to be exiled or dead.

<doc id="842558" wikidata="Q1187387" url="?curid=842558" title="Titan IIIB">
<text>Titan IIIB was the collective name for a number of derivatives of the Titan II ICBM and Titan III launch vehicle, modified by the addition of an Agena upper stage. It consisted of five separate rockets. The Titan-3B Agena-D was a basic Titan IIIA with an Agena D upper stage. The Titan 23B was a basic Titan II with an Agena upper stage, and the Titan 24B was the same concept, but using the slightly enlarged Titan IIIM rocket as the base. The Titan 33B was a Titan 23B with the Agena (which had a smaller diameter than the Titan) enclosed in an enlarged fairing, in order to allow larger payloads to be launched. The final member of the Titan IIIB family was the Titan 34B which was a Titan 24B with the larger fairing used on the Titan 33B.

==Features==

Part of the Titan rocket family, the Titan 23B space launch vehicle was a three-stage liquid fueled booster, designed to provide a small-to-medium weight class capability. It was able to lift approximately into a polar low-Earth circular orbit. The first stage consisted of a ground ignited Aerojet LR-87 liquid propellant rocket, while the second stage consisted of an LR91 liquid propellant rocket. The third stage was an Agena D XLR81-BA-9 liquid propellant rocket.

Various models of this Titan/Agena D rocket were called, &quot;Titan-3B Agena-D&quot;, &quot;Titan 23B&quot;, &quot;Titan 24B&quot;, &quot;Titan 33B&quot; and &quot;Titan 34B&quot;.

==Background==

The Titan rocket family was established in October 1955, when the Air Force awarded The Martin Company a contract to build an intercontinental ballistic missile (ICBM). It became known as the Titan I, the nation&#x27;s first two-stage ICBM and first underground silo-based ICBM. More than 140 Titan II ICBMs, once the vanguard of America&#x27;s strategic deterrent force, were built. Titan IIs also were flown in NASA&#x27;s Gemini crewed space program in the mid-1960s. The Titan 23B is a derivative of the Titan II vehicle with an Agena D upper stage added.

The Titan IIIB family emerged when the new KH-8 (Gambit Mark 3) photo reconnaissance satellite was being developed as the successor to the KH-7 Gambit Mark 1/2 which began flying in 1963. It was decided to switch to the Titan family over the Atlas used for KH-7 because it had substantially more lift capability and also its conventional two-stage design and hypergolic propellants made for a simpler and more reliable launch vehicle than the quirky Atlas. The KH-8 was double the size of its predecessor but still well below the Titan&#x27;s lift capability.

While the KH-8 was the original &quot;raison d&#x27;être&quot; for the Titan IIIB&#x27;s existence, as well as its primary payload, the booster was also used for Jumpseat SIGINT satellites and military comsats. It also lived up to its promise of greater reliability than the Thor and Atlas, with only a few failures over its run.

== Titan-3B Agena-D ==
Titan-3B Agena-D used the same core and second stage as the Titan-IIIA, but added an Agena D upper stage. Twenty-two flights took place from SLC-4W at Vandenberg AFB between 1966 and 1969, all launching KH-8 satellites.

Configuration:

* First stage: 2 × LR-87-AJ9
* Second stage: LR-91-AJ9
* Third stage: Agena-D

==Titan 23B==
Titan 23B used the basic Titan-IIIA core (with an updated first and second stage engines) with an Agena D upper stage, though without the all-inertial guidance system, malfunction detection equipment, and redundant systems required for man-rating the 3A. The Titan 23B was launched from SLC-4W at Vandenberg AFB. Its main payload was the GAMBIT (KH-8 reconnaissance) satellites, in nine flights from 1969 through 1971.

Configuration:

* First stage: 2 × LR-87-AJ11
* Second stage: LR-91-AJ11
* Third stage: Agena-D

==Titan 24B==

The Titan 24B differed from the Titan 23B in that the Titan IIIM core with extended propellant tanks was used in place of the original Titan II core. The payload remained attached to the Agena stage. Twenty-three flights took place from SLC-4W at Vandenberg AFB between 1971 and 1984, with two failures.

Configuration:

* First stage: 2 × LR-87-AJ11, extended tank
* Second stage: LR-91-AJ11
* Third stage: Agena-D

==Titan 33B==

The Titan 33B was a Titan 23B with the entire Agena and payload completely enclosed in a shroud. It flew only three times from SLC-4W at Vandenberg AFB between 1971 and 1973 with one failure, being used to launch Jumpseat satellites.

Configuration:

* First stage: 2 × LR-87-AJ11
* Second stage: LR-91-AJ11
* Third stage: Agena-D, larger fairing

==Titan 34B==

The Titan 34B was a Titan 24B, modified by the addition of the larger fairing used on the Titan 33B. Eleven flights took place from SLC-4W at Vandenberg AFB between 1975 and 1987.

Configuration:

* First stage: 2 × LR-87-AJ11, extended tank
* Second stage: LR-91-AJ11
* Third stage: Agena-D, larger fairing

==Failures==
Titan IIIB rockets suffered four outright failures, and two partial failures. The first failure occurred on 26 April 1967 during the launch of a Gambit 3 satellite when the second stage suffered a sudden thrust decay which left it unable to achieve orbital velocity, sending the Agena and GAMBIT into the Pacific Ocean some 400 miles (644 km) downrange. It was not possible to determine the cause of the malfunction with certainty, but a fuel line obstruction was believed to be the most likely explanation. Martin-Marietta had no answers except to suggest implementing better quality control measures during assembly of the Titan vehicles. The next launch, on 20 June 1967 was a partial failure; due to a problem with the protective skirt on the second stage, a lower-than-planned orbit was achieved. On 24 October 1969 OPS 8455 was placed into a higher-than-planned orbit by another 23B due to an engine failing to cut off after completing its planned burn, however the payload was able to correct its own orbit.

On 16 February 1972, a Titan 33B failed to achieve orbit carrying a Jumpseat satellite. Another failure occurred later the same year, when on 20 May a Titan 24B malfunctioned during the launch of KH-8 #35. The Agena suffered a failure of a pneumatic regulator during ascent and reentered the atmosphere. Although it had been assumed debris would land near South Africa, pieces turned up in faraway Great Britain a few months later. The launch of KH-8 #39 on 26 June 1973 also failed to orbit when the Agena had a fuel valve failure, preventing engine start. A launch of a Jumpseat satellite on 24 April 1981 was a partial failure when the Agena failed to separate.

<text>The Auxiliary Division of the Royal Irish Constabulary (ADRIC), generally known as the Auxiliaries or Auxies, was a paramilitary unit of the Royal Irish Constabulary (RIC) during the Irish War of Independence. It was founded in July 1920 by Major-General Henry Hugh Tudor and made up of former British Army officers, most of whom came from Great Britain and had fought in the First World War. Almost 2,300 served in the unit during the conflict. Its role was to conduct counter-insurgency operations against the Irish Republican Army (IRA), acting mainly as a mobile striking and raiding force. It operated semi-independently of the RIC and was mainly deployed to southern and western regions where fighting was heaviest.

The Auxiliaries became infamous for reprisal attacks on civilians and civilian property in revenge for IRA actions, including extrajudicial killings and arson; most notably the burning of Cork city in December 1920.

The Auxiliaries were distinct from the so-called Black and Tans. These were also former British soldiers who were recruited into the RIC, but served as regular constables. Both groups wore a mixed uniform of British Army khaki and RIC dark green, although the Auxiliaries had their own insignia and typically wore Balmoral caps. The Auxiliaries and the RIC as a whole were disbanded in early 1922, following the Anglo-Irish Treaty.

==Recruitment and organisation==
In September 1919, the Commander-in-Chief, Ireland, Sir Frederick Shaw suggested that the police force in Ireland be expanded via the recruitment of a special force of volunteer British ex-servicemen. During a Cabinet meeting on 11 May 1920, the Secretary of State for War, Winston Churchill, suggested the formation of a &quot;Special Emergency Gendarmerie, which would become a branch of the Royal Irish Constabulary&quot;. Churchill&#x27;s proposal was referred to a committee chaired by General Sir Nevil Macready, Commander-in-Chief of the British forces in Ireland. Macready&#x27;s committee rejected Churchill&#x27;s proposal, but it was revived two months later, in July, by the Police Adviser to the Dublin Castle administration in Ireland, Major-General H H Tudor. In a memo dated 6 July 1920, Tudor justified the scheme on the grounds that it would take too long to reinforce the Royal Irish Constabulary (RIC) with ordinary recruits. Tudor&#x27;s new &quot;Auxiliary Force&quot; would be strictly temporary: its members would enlist for a year: their pay would be £7 per week (twice what a constable was paid), plus a sergeant&#x27;s allowances, and would be known as &quot;Temporary Cadets&quot;. At that time, one of high unemployment, a London advertisement for ex-officers to manage coffee stalls at two pounds ten shillings a week received five thousand applicants.

The ADRIC was recruited in Great Britain from among ex-officers who had served in World War I, especially those who had served in the British Army (including the Royal Flying Corps). Most recruits were from Britain, although some were from Ireland, and others came from other parts of the British Empire. Many had been highly decorated in the war and three, James Leach, James Johnson, and George Onions, had been awarded the Victoria Cross. Their decorations make it clear that many had been promoted from the ranks: some men, for example, had been awarded the common soldier&#x27;s Military Medal instead of (or in addition to) the officer&#x27;s Military Cross. Enlisted men who had been commissioned as officers during the war often found it difficult to adjust to their loss of status and pay in civilian life, and some historians have concluded that the Auxiliary Division recruited large numbers of these &quot;temporary gentlemen&quot;.

Piaras Beaslaí, a former senior member of the IRA who supported the Anglo-Irish Treaty, while paying tribute to the bravery of the Auxiliaries, noted that the force was not composed exclusively of ex-officers but contained &quot;criminal elements&quot;, some of whom robbed people (including a number of Unionists) on the streets of Dublin and in their homes.

Recruiting began in July 1920, and by November 1921, the division was 1,900 strong. The Auxiliaries were nominally part of the RIC, but actually operated more or less independently in rural areas. Divided into companies (eventually fifteen of them), each about one hundred strong, heavily armed and highly mobile, they operated in ten counties, mostly in the south and west, where Irish Republican Army (IRA) activity was greatest. They wore either RIC uniforms or their old army uniforms with appropriate police badges, along with distinctive Tam o&#x27; Shanter caps. They were commanded by Brigadier-General Frank Percy Crozier.

==Counterinsurgency==
The elite ex-officer division proved to be much more effective than the Black and Tans especially in the key area of gathering intelligence. Auxiliary companies were intended as mobile striking and raiding forces, and they scored some notable successes against the IRA. On 20 November, the night before Bloody Sunday, they captured Dick McKee and Peadar Clancy, the commandant and vice-commandant of the IRA&#x27;s Dublin Brigade, and murdered them in Dublin Castle. That same night, they caught William Pilkington, commandant of the Sligo IRA, in a separate raid. A month later, in December, they caught Ernie O&#x27;Malley completely by surprise in County Kilkenny: the IRA officer was reading in his room when a Temporary Cadet opened the door and walked in; &quot;He was as unexpected as death,&quot; said O&#x27;Malley. In his memoirs, the commandant of the Clare IRA, Michael Brennan, describes how the Auxiliaries nearly captured him three nights in a row.

IRA commanders became concerned about the morale of their units as to many Volunteers the Auxiliaries seemed to be &#x27;super fighters and all but invincible&#x27;. Those victories which were won over the Auxiliaries are among the most celebrated in the Irish War of Independence. On 28 November 1920, for example, a platoon of Auxiliaries was ambushed and wiped out in the Kilmichael Ambush by Tom Barry and the 3rd Cork Brigade. A little more than two months later, on 2 February 1921, another platoon of Auxiliaries was ambushed by Seán MacEoin and the Longford IRA in the Clonfin Ambush. On 19 March 1921, the 3rd Cork Brigade of the IRA defeated a large scale attempt by the British Army &amp; Auxiliary Division to encircle and trap them at Crossbarry. On 15 April 1921, Captain Roy Mackinnon, commanding officer of H Company ADRIC, was assassinated by the Kerry IRA.

Successes required reliable intelligence and raids often brought no result—or sometimes worse. In one case, they arrested a Castle official, Law Adviser W. E. Wylie, by mistake. In another, more notorious case, on 19 April 1921 they raided the Shannon Hotel in Castleconnell, County Limerick on a tip that there were suspicious characters drinking therein. The &quot;suspicious characters&quot; turned out to be three off-duty members of the RIC: both sides mistook the other for insurgents and opened fire; three people, an RIC man, an Auxiliary Cadet and a civilian, were killed in the shootout that followed.

==Controversy==

Many of the Division&#x27;s Temporary Cadets did not cope well with the frustrations of counterinsurgency: hurriedly recruited, poorly trained, and with an ill-defined role, they soon gained a reputation for drunkenness, lack of discipline, and brutality worse than that of the Black and Tans. They were disliked by members of the Royal Irish Constabulary, who considered them &quot;rough.&quot; They seem to have been unpopular with the British Army as well. One British officer, who served as adjutant for the 2nd Battalion, Cameron Highlanders, wrote in his memoirs that the Auxiliaries &quot;were totally undisciplined by our regimental standards&quot;. Macready wrote in his own memoirs that &quot;those companies that had the good fortune to have good commanders, generally ex-Regular officers, who could control their men, performed useful work, but the exploits of certain other companies under weak or inefficient commanders went a long way to discredit the whole force&quot;.

Like the ordinary police, the Auxiliaries sometimes took reprisals in the wake of attacks by the IRA. On the evening of Bloody Sunday, for example, Dick McKee and Peadar Clancy were killed by their Auxiliary captors under very suspicious circumstances: the official explanation, that the two insurgents tried to escape, is widely disbelieved. Perhaps the most notorious reprisal involving the Auxiliary Division was the burning of Cork on 11 December 1920. At 7:30 p.m. that evening, a truckload of Auxiliaries from newly formed K Company was ambushed at Dillons Cross: a grenade was thrown onto their truck, wounding ten Auxiliaries and killing one, Temporary Cadet Spencer Chapman. Later that night, police and Auxiliaries took revenge by setting fire to the city&#x27;s commercial centre, preventing the fire service from attending the blaze, and shooting seven people (see Burning of Cork).

Two IRA men, Cornelius and Jerimiah Delaney, were killed in their beds at home in Dublin Hill (though Con Delaney survived to 18 December). Five civilians were shot on the streets. Damage amounting to $20 million was inflicted. The Cork Fire Brigade did not have the resources to deal with the fires: law and order, it seemed, had completely broken down. The British Government at first claimed the citizens were responsible for the arson, but a military court of inquiry known as the Strickland Report later found that the fires had been started by the Auxiliaries. Its findings were suppressed by the government, but K Company was disbanded. Allegedly, some Auxiliaries took to wearing pieces of burnt cork on their caps afterwards, to celebrate the occasion.

A few days later, near Dunmanway, an Auxiliary called Vernon Hart killed a young man and a seventy-year-old priest, whom the Auxiliary patrol met on the road. A third civilian, a local magistrate, escaped by approaching the other Auxiliaries before fleeing across nearby fields. Hart was arrested and court-martialled. At his trial, it was revealed that he had been a &quot;particular friend&quot; of Chapman, and had been drinking heavily since 11 December. Concerned that parallels would be made between this case and the killing of Francis Sheehy-Skeffington, the British Cabinet directed that Hart should be examined by at least two medical experts, a highly unusual intervention. These medical witnesses testified that Hart was insane at the time of the murders and the court-martial concluded that he &quot;was guilty of the offenses with which he was charged, but was insane at the time of their commission&quot;. Although Hamar Greenwood announced to the House of Commons that he would be detained at His Majesty&#x27;s pleasure, Hart was briefly held at Broadmoor Criminal Lunatic Asylum before release the following year.

While Hart spent some time in a Criminal Lunatic Asylum, other Auxiliaries got away with murder. On 9 February 1921, James Murphy and Patrick Kennedy were arrested by Auxiliaries in Dublin. Two hours later, constables of the Dublin Metropolitan Police found the two men lying shot in Drumcondra: Kennedy was dead, and Murphy was dying. Murphy died in the Mater Hospital, Dublin on 11 February, but before the end, he declared that he and Kennedy had been shot by their Auxiliary captors. A military court of inquiry was held, and Captain W. L. King, commanding officer of F Company ADRIC, was arrested for the killings. King was court-martialled on 13–15 February, but acquitted, after Murphy&#x27;s dying declaration was ruled inadmissible, and two officers from F Company provided perjured alibis for Captain King at the time of the shootings. Just short of two weeks later at the Clonmult Ambush in county Cork, an Auxiliary company were accused of killing seven IRA men after they had surrendered.

However, while the authorities often turned a blind eye to reprisals, they were less tolerant of crimes against &quot;civilians&quot; - loyal and non-political people. A number of Auxiliaries were dismissed and prosecuted for theft, including a one-armed former Temporary Cadet, Major Ewen Cameron Bruce, who was imprisoned for robbing a creamery, after being dismissed from the Division for striking a civilian without cause. On 19 February 1921, Commandant Crozier resigned after a dispute over discipline with the Police Adviser. Crozier had dismissed 21 Temporary Cadets accused of looting a licensed grocery store belonging to Protestants in County Meath. When General Tudor reinstated these men pending an official inquiry, Crozier left the Force. He was replaced by his assistant, Brigadier-General Edward Allan Wood, who commanded the Division until it was demobilised.

==Disbandment==
The Auxiliary Division was disbanded along with the RIC in 1922. Although the 1921 Anglo Irish Treaty required the Irish Free State to assume responsibility for the pensions of RIC members, the Auxiliaries were explicitly excluded from this provision. Following their disbandment, many of its former personnel joined the Palestine Police Force in the British-controlled territory.

==Historical legacy ==
The anti-insurgency activities of the Auxiliaries Division have become interchangeable with those conducted by the Black and Tans leading to many atrocities committed by them being attributed to the Black and Tans. Nevertheless, both British units remain equally reviled in Ireland.

The Auxiliaries have featured in historical drama films like &quot;Michael Collins&quot;, &quot;The Last September&quot;, and &quot;The Wind That Shakes the Barley&quot;.

<text>System of systems is a collection of task-oriented or dedicated systems that pool their resources and capabilities together to create a new, more complex system which offers more functionality and performance than simply the sum of the constituent systems. Currently, systems of systems is a critical research discipline for which frames of reference, thought processes, quantitative analysis, tools, and design methods are incomplete. referred to system of systems engineering.

== Overview ==
Commonly proposed descriptions—not necessarily definitions—of systems of systems, are outlined below in order of their appearance in the literature:

# Linking systems into joint system of systems allows for the interoperability and synergism of Command, Control, Computers, Communications and Information (C4I) and Intelligence, Surveillance and Reconnaissance (ISR) Systems: &quot;description in the field of information superiority in modern military&quot;.
# System of systems are large-scale concurrent and distributed systems the components of which are complex systems themselves: &quot;description in the field of communicating structures and information systems in private enterprise&quot;.
#System of systems education involves the integration of systems into system of systems that ultimately contribute to evolution of the social infrastructure: &quot;description in the field of education of engineers on the importance of systems and their integration&quot;.
# System of systems integration is a method to pursue development, integration, interoperability and optimization of systems to enhance performance in future battlefield scenarios: &quot;description in the field of information intensive systems integration in the military&quot;.
# Modern systems that comprise system of systems problems are not monolithic, rather they have five common characteristics: operational independence of the individual systems, managerial independence of the systems, geographical distribution, emergent behavior and evolutionary development: &quot;description in the field of evolutionary acquisition of complex adaptive systems in the military&quot;.
# Enterprise systems of systems engineering is focused on coupling traditional systems engineering activities with enterprise activities of strategic planning and investment analysis: &quot;description in the field of information intensive systems in private enterprise&quot;.
#System of systems problems are a collection of trans-domain networks of heterogeneous systems that are likely to exhibit operational and managerial independence, geographical distribution, and emergent and evolutionary behaviors that would not be apparent if the systems and their interactions are modeled separately: &quot;description in the field of National Transportation System, Integrated Military and Space Exploration&quot;.

Taken together, all these descriptions suggest that a complete system of systems engineering framework is needed to improve decision support for system of systems problems. Specifically, an effective system of systems engineering framework is needed to help decision makers to determine whether related infrastructure, policy and/or technology considerations as an interrelated whole are good, bad or neutral over time. The need to solve system of systems problems is urgent not only because of the growing complexity of today&#x27;s challenges, but also because such problems require large monetary and resource investments with multi-generational consequences.

== System-of-systems topics ==

=== The system-of-systems approach ===
While the individual systems constituting a system of systems can be very different and operate independently, their interactions typically expose and deliver important emergent properties. These emergent patterns have an evolving nature that stakeholders must recognize, analyze and understand. The system of systems approach does not advocate particular tools, methods or practices; instead, it promotes a new way of thinking for solving grand challenges where the interactions of technology, policy, and economics are the primary drivers. System of systems study is related to the general study of designing, complexity and systems engineering, but also brings to the fore the additional challenge of design.

Systems of systems typically exhibit the behaviors of complex systems, but not all complex problems fall in the realm of systems of systems. Inherent to system of systems problems are several combinations of traits, not all of which are exhibited by every such problem:

* Operational Independence of Elements
* Managerial Independence of Elements
* Evolutionary Development
* Emergent Behavior
* Geographical Distribution of Elements
* Interdisciplinary Study
* Heterogeneity of Systems
* Networks of Systems

The first five traits are known as Maier&#x27;s criteria for identifying system of systems challenges. The remaining three traits have been proposed from the study of mathematical implications of modeling and analyzing system of systems challenges by Dr. Daniel DeLaurentis and his co-researchers at Purdue University.

=== Research ===
Current research into effective approaches to system of systems problems includes:

* Establishment of an effective frame of reference
* Crafting of a unifying lexicon 
* Developing effective methodologies to visualize and communicate complex systems 
* Distributed resource management 
* Study of designing architecture
** Interoperability 
** Data distribution policies: policy definition, design guidance and verification
* Formal modelling language with integrated tools platform
* Study of various modeling, simulation and analysis techniques
** network theory
** agent based modeling
** general systems theory
** probabilistic robust design (including uncertainty modeling/management)
** object-oriented simulation and programming
** multi-objective optimization
* Study of various numerical and visual tools for capturing the interaction of system requirements, concepts and technologies

=== Applications ===
Systems of systems, while still being investigated predominantly in the defense sector, is also seeing application in such fields as national air and auto transportation and space exploration. Other fields where it can be applied include health care, design of the Internet, software integration, and energy management and power systems. Social-ecological interpretations of resilience, where different levels of our world (e.g., the Earth system, the political system) are interpreted as interconnected or nested systems, take a systems-of-systems approach. An application in business can be found for supply chain resilience.

== Educational institutions and industry ==
Collaboration among a wide array of organizations is helping to drive the development of defining system of systems problem class and methodology for modeling and analysis of system of systems problems. There are ongoing projects throughout many commercial entities, research institutions, academic programs, and government agencies.

Major stakeholders in the development of this concept are:
* Universities working on system of systems problems, including Purdue University, the Georgia Institute of Technology, Old Dominion University, George Mason University, the University of New Mexico, the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Naval Postgraduate School and Carnegie Mellon University.
* Corporations active in this area of research such as The MITRE Corporation, Airbus, BAE Systems, Northrop Grumman, Boeing, Raytheon, Thales Group, CAE Inc., Altair Engineering, Saber Astronautics and Lockheed Martin. 
* Government agencies that perform and support research in systems of systems research and applications, such as DARPA, the U.S. Federal Aviation Administration, NASA and Department of Defense (DoD)
For example, DoD recently established the National Centers for System of Systems Engineering to develop a formal methodology for system-of-systems engineering for applications in defense-related projects.

In another example, according to the Exploration Systems Architecture Study, NASA established the Exploration Systems Mission Directorate (ESMD) organization to lead the development of a new exploration &quot;system-of-systems&quot; to accomplish the goals outlined by President G.W. Bush in the 2004 Vision for Space Exploration.

A number of research projects and support actions, sponsored by the European Commission, were performed in the Seventh Framework Programme. These target Strategic Objective IST-2011.3.3 in the FP7 ICT Work Programme (New paradigms for embedded systems, monitoring and control towards complex systems engineering). This objective had a specific focus on the &quot;design, development and engineering of System-of-Systems&quot;. These projects included:
* T-AREA-SoS (Trans-Atlantic Research and Education Agenda on Systems of Systems), which aims &quot;to increase European competitiveness in, and improve the societal impact of, the development and management of large complex systems in a range of sectors through the creation of a commonly agreed EU-US Systems of Systems (SoS) research agenda&quot;.
* COMPASS (Comprehensive Modelling for Advanced Systems of Systems), aiming to provide a semantic foundation and open tools framework to allow complex SoSs to be successfully and cost-effectively engineered, using methods and tools that promote the construction and early analysis of models.
* DANSE (Designing for Adaptability and evolutioN in System of systems Engineering), which aims to develop &quot;a new methodology to support evolving, adaptive and iterative System of Systems life-cycle models based on a formal semantics for SoS inter-operations and supported by novel tools for analysis, simulation, and optimisation&quot;.
* ROAD2SOS (Roadmaps for System-of-System Engineering), aiming to develop &quot;strategic research and engineering roadmaps in Systems of Systems Engineering and related case studies&quot;.
* DYMASOS (DYnamic MAnagement of physically-coupled Systems Of Systems), aiming to develop theoretical approaches and engineering tools for dynamic management of SoS based on industrial use cases.
* AMADEOS (Architecture for Multi-criticality Agile Dependable Evolutionary Open System-of-Systems) aiming to bring time awareness and evolution into the design of System-of- Systems (SoS) with possible emergent behavior, to establish a sound conceptual model, a generic architectural framework and a design methodology.
Ongoing European projects which are using a System of Systems approach include:
* Arctic PASSION (Pan-Arctic observing System of Systems: Implementing Observations for societal Needs; July 2021 - June 2025) is a Horizon 2020 research project with the key motivation of co-creating and implementing a coherent, integrated Arctic observing system: the Pan-Arctic Observing System of Systems - pan-AOSS. The project aims to overcome shortcomings in the present observing system by refining its operability, improving and extending pan-Arctic scientific and community-based monitoring and the integration with indigenous and local knowledge.
* COLOSSUS (Collaborative System of Systems Exploration of Aviation Products, Services and Business Models; Feb 2023 - Jan 2026) is a Horizon Europe research project for the development of a system-of-systems design methodology which for the first time will enable the combined optimization of aircraft, operations and business models. The project aims at establishing a transformative digital collaborative (TDC) framework to enable European aviation to conduct research, technology development, and innovation. The TDC framework will support the simulation, analysis, optimization and evaluation of complex products and services in real-world scenarios.

<text>Morfran (Middle Welsh: &quot;Moruran&quot; &quot;cormorant&quot;; literally &quot;sea crow&quot;, from &quot;môr&quot;, &quot;sea&quot;, and &quot;brân&quot;, &quot;crow&quot;, from Common Brittonic *&quot;mori-brannos&quot;, as in French &quot;cormoran&quot; &lt; L &quot;corvus marinus&quot;) is a figure in Welsh mythology. Usually portrayed as a warrior under King Arthur, he is noted for the darkness of his skin and his hideousness. He appears in the narratives about the bard Taliesin and in the Welsh Triads, where he is often contrasted with the angelically handsome Sanddef.

==Appearances==
The character appears in the &quot;Tale of Taliesin&quot;, where he is depicted as the son of Ceridwen and Tegid Foel, and is given an extremely beautiful sister named Creirwy. In later versions of this tale his characteristic ugliness is transferred to a brother, Afagddu (Middle Welsh: &quot;Avagddu&quot;; from &quot;y fagddu&quot;, &quot;utter darkness&quot;), though Ifor Williams suggested this name arose as a nickname for the famously gruesome Morfran. In the story, Ceridwen tries to help her son make his way in the world by creating a potion whose first three drops would bestow the drinker with knowledge of the future. She gives Gwion Bach (the bard Taliesin) the job of stirring the brew; he splashes three drops on his fingers and licks them, whereupon he gains the knowledge intended for Morfran/Afagddu, who remains ugly and despised. The story has a parallel in the Irish tale &quot;The Boyhood Deeds of Fionn&quot;, in which the young hero Fionn mac Cumhaill receives prophetic wisdom intended for his master Finn Eces by consuming the Salmon of Knowledge.

Morfran eil Tegid (Morfran son of Tegid) appears in several of the Welsh Triads. In Triad 24 he is recognized as one of the &quot;Three Slaughter-Blocks of the Island of Britain&quot;, while Triad 41 celebrates his horse Guelwgan Gohoewgein (Silver-White, Proud and Fair) as one of the &quot;Three Lover&#x27;s Horses of the Island of Britain&quot;. Other manuscripts attribute this horse to Drystan (Tristan) and Ceredig ap Gwallawg. In other triads he is associated with Sanddef, whose beauty is as notable as Morfran&#x27;s ugliness. In a triad preserved in the prose tale &quot;Culhwch and Olwen&quot;, Morfran and Sanddef are named as two of the three men who survived the Battle of Camlann, in Morfran&#x27;s case because his ugliness led everyone to believe he was &quot;a devil helping, for there was hair on his face like the hair of a stag.&quot; This triad was adapted in the 15th-century triad collection known as &quot;The Twenty-four Knights of Arthur&#x27;s Court&quot;; the pair are two of the &quot;Three Irresistible Knights&quot;, as their peculiarities made it &quot;repugnant to anyone to refuse them anything.&quot;

Morfran is further mentioned in the 12th-century prose tale &quot;The Dream of Rhonabwy&quot;. Rachel Bromwich notes that a 12th-century poem by Cynddelw Brydydd Mawr contains a reference to an otherwise forgotten early poet named Morfran, and suggests a connection with the Morfran of &quot;The Tale of Taliesin&quot; who was the intended recipient of the cauldron of poetic inspiration. Scholar Caitlin Green further suggests a connection with the character called &quot;Osfran&#x27;s Son&quot;, who is buried at Camlann according to the &quot;Englynion y Beddau&quot; (&quot;Stanzas of the Graves&quot;).

<text>A gonagas (or konagas) (), bird man, was a shaman ranking level in Northern Scandinavia amongst noayddes. Gonagas possessed a special level of spiritual knowledge and claimed to have the ability to transform into a bird figure to &quot;fly&quot; over mountains. Because of this spiritual ability, Lundius states they were treated more respectfully or had a higher position than other people. According to the myth they could &quot;spiritually communicate,&quot; i.e., travel to trading ports and see who would come to trade. In the witchcrafting period, the figure could not be burned on the stake because the fire would be smothered in the same way water cannot be ignited.

The word ultimately derives from a Germanic word for &quot;king&quot; (Compare to Finnish &quot;Kuningas&quot; and Lithuanian &quot;Kunigas&quot;, both from Proto-Germanic &quot;*Kuningaz&quot;; in archaic contex the Finnish word simply had the meaning of &quot;leader&quot; or &quot;high-ranked person&quot; instead of monarch).

<doc id="842574" wikidata="Q7890265" url="?curid=842574" title="Metrical psalter">
<text>A metrical psalter is a kind of Bible translation: a book containing a verse translation of all or part of the Book of Psalms in vernacular poetry, meant to be sung as hymns in a church. Some metrical psalters include melodies or harmonisations. The composition of metrical psalters was a large enterprise of the Protestant Reformation, especially in its Calvinist manifestation.

==Biblical basis==
During the Protestant Reformation, a number of Bible texts were interpreted as requiring reforms in the music used in worship. The Psalms were particularly commended for singing. In particular, John Calvin said,

 When we have looked thoroughly everywhere and searched high and low, we shall find no better songs nor more appropriate to the purpose than the Psalms of David which the Holy Spirit made and spoke through him
Various Reformers interpreted certain scriptural texts as imposing strictures on sacred music. The psalms, especially, were felt to be commended to be sung by these texts. One example is James 5:13 (KJV)

&quot;Is any merry? let him sing psalms.&quot;

(The word translated &quot;sing psalms&quot; in the KJV at James 5:13 is ψαλλετω. Some other versions give more general translations such as &quot;sing praise&quot; in the ESV.) 

Another key reference is Colossians 3:16

&quot;Let the word of Christ dwell in you richly as you teach and admonish one another with all wisdom, and as you sing psalms, hymns and spiritual songs with gratitude in your hearts to God.&quot; 

The need was felt to have metrical vernacular versions of the Psalms and other Scripture texts, suitable to sing to metrical tunes and even popular song forms.

Following an interpretation of the regulative principle of worship, many Reformed churches adopted the doctrine of exclusive psalmody: every hymn sung in worship must be an actual translation of a Psalm or some other Biblical passage. Some Reformed churches, especially the Calvinists, rejected the use of instrumental music and organs in church, preferring to sing all of the music &quot;a cappella&quot;. Even today, the Reformed Presbyterian Church of North America, the Free Presbyterian Church of Scotland, and other Reformed churches of the Scottish tradition maintain this practice.

==The psalters themselves==
During the pre-reformation days, it was not customary for lay members of a church&#x27;s congregation to communally sing hymns. Singing was done by the priests and other clergy; communal singing of Gregorian chant was the function of professional choirs, or among communities of monks and nuns. The reformers, perhaps inspired by Erasmus&#x27;s desire for all to know the scriptures, pursued singable versions of the Psalms and other Christian texts for the communal use of the Reformed churches.

===The Genevan Psalter===
One of the greatest metrical psalters produced during the Reformation, the Genevan Psalter, was authored for the Protestant churches of France and Geneva (called the Huguenots). It has been in uninterrupted use to the present day by the Huguenot and other French-speaking Protestant churches.

The texts of the French Psalter were brought together from two independent sources: the poet Clément Marot and the theologian Théodore de Bèze. Marot and Beza&#x27;s psalms appeared in a number of different collections, published between 1533 and 1543; in the latter year Marot published &quot;Cinquante Pseaumes&quot;, a collection of 50 psalms rendered into French verse. The full psalter containing all 150 canonical Psalms, plus the Nunc Dimittis, appeared in 1562.

The French psalms were set to melodies that were harmonized and altered for congregational singing. Music for the Genevan Psalter was furnished by Loys Bourgeois and others like Guillaume Franc and a certain Maistre Pierre. The composer Claude Goudimel harmonized these melodies with great variation in the complexity of the music. In some cases each part matches note for note, while others are contrapuntal or even motets. Even more elaborate musical arrangements were composed in the seventeenth century by Paschal de l&#x27;Estocart and Jan Pieterszoon Sweelinck.

An example of the Huguenot Psalter is Psalm 134 (tune given above):
&lt;poem&gt;Vous, saints ministres du Seigneur,
Qui, dévoués à son honneur,
Veillez la nuit dans sa maison,
Présentez-lui votre oraison.&lt;/poem&gt;

===The Dutch metrical psalter===
A metrical psalter was also produced for the Calvinist Reformed Church of the Netherlands by Petrus Datheen in 1566. This Psalter borrowed the hymn tunes from the Genevan Psalter and consisted of a literal translation of Marot and Beza&#x27;s French translation. The Dutch psalter was revised on orders of the Dutch legislature in 1773, in a revision which also added non-paraphrase hymns to the collection. This psalter also continues in use among the Reformed community of the Netherlands, and was recently revised in 1985. In 1968 a new metrical psalmbook appeared, which is incorporated in the Dutch hymnbook; &quot;Liedboek voor de kerken&quot; of 1973.

===Metrical psalters in German===
The Genevan Psalms were translated into German by Ambrosius Lobwasser (1515–1585) in 1573 &quot;Psalter des königlichen Propheten Davids&quot; and were sung a capella to Goudimel&#x27;s harmonies for over two centuries. The Lobwasser psalms are still in use in the Amish congregations in North America, who took them with the Swiss Hymnbooks to the New World. The music edition of 1576 was reprinted in 2004, which was a result of the International Psalm Symposion in Emden. In 1798 the German pastor in Den Haag Matthias Jorissen gave out his: &quot;Neue Bereimung der Psalmen&quot; which replaced the old-fashioned psalm book for nearly 200 years. The present Hymnbook (1996) of the Evangelical-reformed Churches and the Old Reformed Churches of Germany contains the complete psalter with many psalms of Matthias Jorissen and other authors. It was an important decision of the synods to retain the psalms in the hymnbook with the Genevan tunes. The need and interest in the complete Jorissen- Psalter led to different new editions in 1931, 1951 and 2006. The last one was given out for singing of the people and not for scientific use only. Today, psalms make up a quarter (102) of the Protestant hymn book from 1998 in German Switzerland.

Another German psalter is the Becker Psalter.

==Metrical psalters in English==

===Robert Crowley===
The first complete English metrical psalter and the first to include musical notation was &quot;The Psalter of Dauid newely translated into Englysh metre in such sort that it maye the more decently, and wyth more delyte of the mynde, be reade and songe of al men&quot;. Printed in 1549, it was the work of Robert Crowley and was printed by him, Richard Grafton and/or Stephen Mierdman. Crowley&#x27;s psalter is a rare example of two-color printing (red and black on the first four leaves) in this era, which makes it visually resemble medieval manuscript psalters. (Christopher Tye and Francis Seager later included musical notation in their psalters, and the Sternhold and Hopkins psalter eventually incorporated a basic tune with the Anglo-Genevan edition of 1556. John Day&#x27;s &quot;The Whole Book of Psalmes&quot; (1562) contained sixty-five psalm tunes.) Crowley also included a calendar for calculating feast days as in the &quot;Book of Common Prayer&quot;, to which Crowley&#x27;s psalter appears to be intended as a supplement.

The music provided in Crowley&#x27;s psalter is similar to the Gregorian tones of the Latin Sarum Rite psalter, and it can be found in &quot;Grove&#x27;s Dictionary of Music and Musicians&quot;. A single note is given for each syllable in each verse, in keeping with Archbishop Thomas Cranmer&#x27;s mandate for the reformed Edwardian liturgy. The goal was to emphasize simplicity and to encourage attentiveness to what was being sung by omitting complex vocal ornamentation. In addition to the Psalms, Crowley&#x27;s psalter includes English versions of the canticles Benedictus, Magnificat, Nunc Dimittis, and Benedicite, as well as the Te Deum and the Quicumque Vult. These are the &quot;Cantica Prophetarium&quot; retained in the Book of Common Prayer from the Sarum psalter — key parts of the Divine Office.

Crowley&#x27;s lyrics are mainly based on Leo Jud&#x27;s &quot;Biblia Sacrosancta&quot;, which was in turn a fresh translation from the Hebrew that maintained fidelity to its lyrical arrangement. Crowley rendered all the psalms in simple iambic fourteeners which conform to the single, short, four-part tune that is printed at the beginning of the psalter.

From Crowley&#x27;s rendition of Psalm 24:
:The earth and al that it holdeth, do to the lorde belonge:
:The world and al that dwel therein as wel the olde as yonge.
:For it is he that aboue al the seas hath it founded:
:And that aboue the freshe waters hathe the same prepared.

For the sake of comparison, here is how the same text is rendered in contemporary English Bibles:

:The earth is the Lord&#x27;s, and all that therein is: the compass of the world, and they that dwell therein.
:For he hath founded it upon the seas and prepared it upon the floods. (Coverdale, 1535)
:The earth is Gods and all that therin is: the worlde, and they that dwell therein.
:For he hath laide the foundation of it vpon the seas: and he hath set it sure vpon the fluddes. (Bishop&#x27;s Bible, 1568)

:The earth is the Lordes, and all that therein is: the worlde and they that dwell therein.
:For he hath founded it vpon the seas: and established it vpon the floods. (Geneva Bible, 1587)

:The earth &quot;is&quot; the L&#x27;s, and the fulness thereof; the world and they that dwell therein.
:For he hath founded it upon the seas, and established it upon the floods. (Authorised, 1611)

===Sternhold and Hopkins (&#x27;Old Version&#x27;)===
Thomas Sternhold published his first, short collection of nineteen &quot;Certayn Psalmes&quot; between mid-1547 and early 1549. In December 1549, his posthumous : was printed, containing thirty-seven psalms by Sternhold and, in a separate section at the end, seven psalms by John Hopkins. This collection was taken to the Continent with Protestant exiles during the reign of Mary Tudor, and editors in Geneva both revised the original texts and gradually added more over several editions. In 1562, the publisher John Day brought together most of the psalm versions from the Genevan editions and many new psalms by John Hopkins, Thomas Norton, and John Markant to make up &quot;The Whole Booke of Psalmes, Collected into English Meter&quot;. In addition to metrical versions of all 150 psalms, the volume included versified versions of the Apostles&#x27; Creed, the &quot;Magnificat&quot;, and other biblical passages or Christian texts, as well as several non-scriptural versified prayers and a long section of prose prayers largely drawn from the &quot;English Forme of Prayers&quot; used in Geneva.
Sternhold and Hopkins wrote almost all of their Psalms in the &quot;common&quot; or ballad metre. Their versions were quite widely circulated at the time; copies of the Sternhold and Hopkins psalter were bound with many editions of the Geneva Bible, and their versions of the Psalms were used in many churches. The Sternhold and Hopkins psalter was also published with music, much of it borrowed from the French Geneva Psalter. One setting from their collection that has survived is the metrical form of the Psalm 100 attributed to William Kethe, with the tune known as the Old 100th, often used as a doxology:
:All people that on earth do dwell,
:sing to the Lord with cheerful voice:
:Him serve with fear, his praise forth tell,
:come ye before him and rejoice.

In 1621, Thomas Ravenscroft published an expanded edition of the Sternhold and Hopkins Psalter; Ravenscroft&#x27;s edition added many more psalm tunes, some of which had been composed, since the original publication, by leading late Tudor and early Stuart English composers such as Thomas Morley, Thomas Tallis, John Dowland, and Thomas Tomkins. Another musical contributor to this volume was John Milton, the father of the poet of that name.

By any objective measure of circulation Sternhold and Hopkins&#x27;s psalter was a success. As a separate volume, it was re-printed more than 200 times between 1550 and 1640; in addition, the psalms in this form were included in most editions of the Geneva Bible, and also in most versions of the &quot;Book of Common Prayer&quot;. They continued to be in regular use in some congregations until the late eighteenth century.

Literary opinion after the sixteenth century, on the other hand, was decidedly negative. In his 1781 &quot;History of English Poetry&quot;, British poet laureate Thomas Warton called the Sternhold and Hopkins psalter &quot;obsolete and contemptible,&quot; &quot;an absolute travesty,&quot; and &quot;entirely destitute of elegance, spirit, and propriety.&quot; In 1819, Thomas Campbell condemned their &quot;worst taste&quot; and &quot;flat and homely phrasing.&quot; In 1757, John Wesley described the verse of Sternhold and Hopkins as &quot;scandalous doggerel&quot;.

Sternhold and Hopkins render the beginning of the 24th Psalm in this way:
:The earth is all the Lord&#x27;s, with all
::her store and furniture;
::Yea, his is all the work, and all
::that therein doth endure:
::For he hath fastly founded it
::above the seas to stand,
::And placed below the liquid floods,
::to flow beneath the land.

=== Tate and Brady (&#x27;New Version&#x27;) ===
First published in 1696, the &quot;New Version of the Psalms of David&quot; was the work of Nahum Tate (who was later named poet laureate) and Nicholas Brady. A second edition was published in 1698, and supplements were issued in 1700, 1702, 1704 (twice) and 1708. Their Augustan version shows somewhat more polish than the 17th century versions.

The hymn &quot;Through all the changing scenes of life&quot; is the setting of Psalm 34 from the New Version, and &quot;As pants the hart for cooling streams&quot; is a setting of Psalm 42.

=== Isaac Watts (&#x27;Imitated&#x27;) ===
Isaac Watts produced a metrical psalter, in which he breaks out of the ballad metre in his 1719 &quot;The Psalms of David, Imitated in the Language of the New Testament, and Apply&#x27;d to the Christian State and Worship&quot;, which, as the title indicates, was intended as an interpretation rather than a strict translation of the psalms. As an example of what is meant by &quot;Language of the New Testament&quot;, Psalm 35 (&quot;A psalm of David&quot;) verses 13-14 (&quot;But as for me, when they were sick, my clothing was sackcloth: I afflicted my soul with fasting... I behaved myself as though it had been my friend or my brother&quot;) becomes: &quot;Behold the love, the gen’rous love, That holy David shows... The spirit of the gospel reigns, And melts his pious heart.&quot;

His translation of Psalm 24 into long metre begins:
:This spacious earth is all the Lord&#x27;s,
:And men, and worms, and beasts, and birds:
:He raised the building on the seas,
:And gave it for their dwelling-place.

===Other versified psalms in English===
During the period of the English Reformation, many other poets besides Sternhold and Hopkins wrote metrical versions of some of the psalms. The first was Sir Thomas Wyatt, who in around 1540 made verse versions of the six penitential Psalms. His version of Psalm 130, the famous &quot;De profundis clamavi&quot;, begins:
:From depth of sin and from a deep despair,
:From depth of death, from depth of heart&#x27;s sorrow
:From this deep cave, of darkness deep repair,

:To thee have I called, O Lord, to be my borrow.
:Thou in my voice, O Lord, perceive and hear
:My heart, my hope, my plaint, my overthrow.

Sir Philip Sidney made verse versions of the first 43 psalms. After he died in 1586, his sister, Mary Sidney Herbert, the Countess of Pembroke, completed the translation of the final two-thirds of the psalter. Together they used a dazzling array of stanza forms and rhyme schemes—as many as 145 different forms for the 150 psalms. The Sidney Psalter was not published in its complete form until the twentieth century, but it was widely read in manuscript, and influenced such later poets as John Donne and George Herbert.

However, poetry remains a matter of private devotion unless given a musical setting for trained choirs or for congregational singing. Rather than iambic pentameter, in England and Scotland in the 16th and 17th centuries, the overwhelming preference in rural congregations was for iambic tetrameters (8s) and iambic trimeters (6s), ridiculed in Shakespeare&#x27;s &quot;A Midsummer Night&#x27;s Dream&quot;, in which Nick Bottom and the other &quot;rude mechanicals&quot; obsess over the need for a prologue &quot;written in eight and sixe&quot;. The three meters then in use: Common Meter (8,6,8,6), Long Meter (8,8,8,8), and Short Meter (6,6,8,6) remain in widespread use in hymnals today.

===Other English metrical psalters===
Later writers attempted to repair the literary inadequacies of the Sternhold and Hopkins version. The &quot;Bay Psalm Book&quot; (1640), the first book published in the British colonies in America, was a new metrical psalter:
:The earth Jehovah&#x27;s is,
:and the fullness of it:
:the habitable world, and they
:that there upon do sit

:Because upon the seas,
:he hath it firmly laid:
:and it upon the water-floods
:most solidly hath stayed

In the 1640s, the English Parliamentarians Francis Rous and William Barton both authored their own metrical paraphrases. Their translations were scrutinised by the Westminster Assembly and heavily edited. Rous&#x27;s original version of Psalm 24 read:
:
:
:
:

After much alteration, a much-altered translation based on Rous&#x27;s work was approved by the General Assembly of the Church of Scotland and published in 1650 as the Scottish Metrical Psalter, to be used throughout the Church of Scotland. This showed some improvements, but ballad metre remained ubiquitous:
:The earth belongs unto the Lord,
:and all that it contains;
:The world that is inhabited,
:and all that there remains.

:For the foundations thereof
:he on the seas did lay,
:And he hath it established
:upon the floods to stay.

One of the most widely known hymns in Christian worship, &quot;The Lord&#x27;s my Shepherd&quot;, is a translation of Psalm 23 appearing in the 1650 Scottish Psalter.
But by the time better metrical psalms were made in English, the belief that every hymn sung in church had to be a Biblical translation had been repudiated by the Church of England. A flowering of English hymnody had occurred under writers such as Isaac Watts and Charles Wesley, but their hymns were freed from the stricture that each verse had to be a translation of a scriptural text. Attitudes towards the Biblical text itself had also changed, with closer emphasis being paid on its exact phrasing. This new regard for the letter of the Biblical text diminished the appeal of the psalters&#x27; previous versions; those who sang them no longer felt they were singing Scripture. The success of these newer hymns has largely displaced the belief that each hymn must be a direct translation of Scripture. Now, many hymnals contain Biblical references to the passages that inspired the authors, but few are direct translations of Scripture like the metrical psalters were.

==Metrical psalter in Gaelic==

The Scottish Gaelic Psalter was produced by the Synod of Argyll. By 1658, the first fifty psalms had been translated into ballad metre due to the work of Dugald Campbell, John Stewart, and Alexander McLaine. A manuscript of the final 100 psalms was produced in 1691 with the entire Gaelic psalter, with revisions to the &#x27;first fifty&#x27; being produced in 1694. The Gaelic Metrical Psalms are used to this day in the Scottish Highland Presbyterian Churches where the practice of lining out is used, in accordance with the Westminster Assembly of Divines Directory for Public Worship. The corpus of tunes has shrunk over the years with only about twenty-four in general use.

==Modern-day metrical psalters==
Many churches continue to use metrical psalters today. For example, the Reformed Presbyterian Church of North America (RPCNA) produced psalm books based on the Scots Metrical Psalter, with the intention of making the words more modern and the translation more accurate. These were produced in 1889 (a split-leaf brown book), 1911 (unpopular due to musical complexity), 1920 (a green book) and 1929 (also green, an expanded version of the 1920 one), 1950 (a blue book), and 1973 (a maroon one) called The Book of Psalms for Singing. A further revision has been undertaken by the RPCNA, again for the purposes of making the words more modern, and also to replace some of the more difficult-to-sing tunes, such as Psalm 62B, with tunes that are easier to sing. The new edition, The Book of Psalms for Worship, was released in 2009.

The Reformed Presbyterian Church of Ireland, however, produced a split-leaf version of the Scots Metrical Psalter, but with additional &quot;Alternative versions&quot; of the words included as the second half of the book. These were culled from a number of sources, including the RPCNA books mentioned above. Whenever a new version was necessary, they merely expanded their old book, without removing any of the old translations. One of these editions was produced in 1979. They were available in staff or sol-fa. A revised Psalter in more modern idiom was published in 2004 under the title The Psalms for Singing.

The Melbourne Congregation of the Presbyterian Church of Eastern Australia produced The Complete Book of Psalms for Singing with Study Notes in 1991. Music in staff format is provided in a variety of meters, mostly to established tunes. The texts draw from the best of older versions but provide much new material.

The Free Church of Scotland published Sing Psalms in 2003, being a completely new translation. It is available in words only, and in staff and sol-fa split-leaf formats.

The Canadian Reformed Churches have published and sing from Book of Praise, the Anglo-Genevan Psalter (1961, 1972, 1984, 2014), containing English versifications for all the Genevan tunes. In 2015 Premier Printing published New Genevan Psalter which consists of the 150 Psalms as found in the Book of Praise as well as the Ten Commandments and the Songs of Mary, Zechariah and Simeon.

==Split-leaf psalters==

A split-leaf psalter (sometimes known as a &quot;Dutch door&quot; psalter) is a book of Psalms in metrical form, in which each page is cut in half at the middle, so that the top half of the pages can be turned separately from the bottom half. The top half usually contains the tunes, and the bottom half contains the words. The tune and words can be matched by matching the meter; each meter is a specification of line length and (implicitly) stressed syllables; if a tune is in Common Meter, any set of Common Meter words can go with it.

<text>A parasite aircraft is a component of a composite aircraft which is carried aloft and air launched by a larger carrier aircraft or mother ship to support the primary mission of the carrier. The carrier craft may or may not be able to later recover the parasite during flight.

The first parasite aircraft flew in 1916, when the British launched a Bristol Scout from a Felixstowe Porte Baby flying boat. The idea eventually developed into jet bombers carrying fully capable parasite fighters. With the advent of long-range fighters equipped with air-to-air missiles, and aerial refueling, parasite fighters fell out of use.

== Parasite fighters ==
Until the middle of the 20th century there was military interest in parasite fighters – fighter aircraft intended to be carried into a combat zone by a larger aircraft, such as a bomber. If the bomber were threatened, the parasite would be released to defend it. Parasite fighters have never been highly successful and have seldom been used in combat. A major disadvantage of a parasite aircraft was that it reduced the payload capacity of the carrier aircraft. Projects for this type were designed to overcome the great disparity in range between bombers and their escort fighters. Development of aerial refueling has made parasite fighters obsolete.

=== 1910s ===
The first parasite fighters were launched and recovered from trapezes mounted externally to military airships. 
In 1915 Neville Usborne and another British officer worked on a plan to lift a BE.2C fighter under an SS-class non-rigid airship. This would allow the fighter to reach the height of a raiding Zeppelin rapidly while also conserving fuel. In the first experimental flight on 21 February 1916, the envelope lost pressure and the plane was prematurely separated from it at 4,000 feet. Both officers were killed and there was no further experimentation with small airships.

In May 1916 a Bristol Scout flown by Flt. Lt. M. J. Day was mounted above the top wing of a Porte Baby flying boat flown by Sqn. Ldr John Cyril Porte, and was successfully released at a height of 1000 ft (300 m). Although successful, the scheme, intended to provide long-range defence against Zeppelins, was not pursued.

In 1918 the Royal Air Force experimented with launching Sopwith Camel fighters from HM Airship 23.

The Germans also experimented with the idea, suspending an Albatros D.III fighter aeroplane below a Zeppelin and releasing it at altitude: the intention was to use the aeroplane to defend airships against the British seaplane patrols encountered over the North Sea. Although the single trial, made on 25 January 1918, was successful the experiments were not continued.

On 12 December 1918, in a test to determine the feasibility of carrying fighter aircraft on dirigibles, the airship C-1 lifted a US Army Curtiss JN-4 aircraft to 2,500 feet over Fort Tilden, New York, and at that height released it for a free flight back to base. The airship was piloted by Lieutenant George Crompton, Dirigible Officer at NAS Rockaway, and the airplane by Lieutenant A. W. Redfield, USA, commander of the 52nd Aero Squadron based at Mineola (Long Island, NY).

=== 1920s ===
The British Imperial Airship Scheme of 1924 envisaged a commercial airship that could also carry five fighter aircraft if put into military use, but this requirement was abandoned.
In 1925 first the DH.53 light aeroplane and then Gloster Grebes had been launched from the airship R.33.

=== 1930s ===

In 1930, the US Navy airship was used to test the trapeze system developed to launch and recover fixed wing aircraft from rigid airships. The tests were a success, and the newly built Navy airships and were designed to carry parasite aircraft inside a hangar bay within the hull. Each airship could carry up to five single-seat Curtiss F9C Sparrowhawks for scouting or two-seat Fleet N2Y-1s for training. In 1934, two two-seat Waco UBF XJW-1 biplanes equipped with skyhooks were delivered to the USS &quot;Macon&quot;.

The temporary system was removed from the &quot;Los Angeles&quot;, which never carried any aircraft on operational flights. In 1930, the &quot;Los Angeles&quot; also tested the launching of a glider over Lakehurst, New Jersey.

Although operations of these parasite aircraft were quite successful, the accidental loss of the &quot;Akron&quot; in 1933 and the
&quot;Macon&quot; in 1935, ended the program.

The first bombers to carry parasite fighters did so as part of the Zveno experiments carried out in the Soviet Union by Vladimir Vakhmistrov from 1931. Up to five fighters of various types were carried by Tupolev TB-1 and Tupolev TB-3 bombers.

=== 1940s ===
In August 1941, these combinations would fly the only combat missions ever undertaken by parasite fighters. TB-3s carrying Polikarpov I-16SPB dive bombers attacked the Cernavodă bridge and Constantsa docks, in Romania. After that, this squadron, based in the Crimea, carried out a tactical attack on a bridge over the river Dnieper at Zaporozhye, which had been captured by advancing German troops.

Later in World War II, the &quot;Luftwaffe&quot; experimented with the Messerschmitt Me 328 as a parasite fighter, but problems with its pulsejet engines could not be overcome. Other late-war rocket-powered projects such as the Arado E.381 and Sombold So 344 never left the experimental stage. By contrast, the Empire of Japan was able to get the Yokosuka MXY7 Ohka kamikaze rocket plane type into active service, typically using the Mitsubishi G4M (Betty) bomber class to carry them within range. However, their effectiveness proved minimal in part because Allied air naval defense took advantage of the weight of the parasitical aircraft payload slowing the carrying bombers, making them vulnerable to interception before the rocket plane could launch.

=== 1950s ===
During the early years of the Cold War, the United States Air Force experimented with a variety of parasite fighters to protect its Convair B-36 bombers, including the dedicated XF-85 Goblin, and methods of either carrying a Republic F-84 Thunderjet in the bomber&#x27;s bomb bay (the FICON project), or attached to the bomber&#x27;s wingtips (Project Tom-Tom). One configuration studied for the XF-85/B-36 combination was for a B-36 to drop the XF-85 for a dash across enemy territory for bombing or reconnaissance and for the pilot to hook onto a different B-36 on the other side of the enemy territory. These projects were all soon abandoned, partly because aerial refueling appeared as a much safer solution to extend the range of fighters.

== Drone motherships ==
, DARPA was working on a project to launch and recover unmanned aerial vehicles from larger aircraft.

== Examples ==
Examples that have flown include:
* A Bristol Scout was flown from a Porte Baby to become the first parasite aircraft (1916)
* An Albatros D.III was flown from L 35 (LZ 80) to become the first parasite fighter flying from an airship (January 26, 1918)
* A Sopwith Camel was flown from airship HMA 23 (1918)
* A Sperry Messenger biplane was launched and recovered by non-rigid airships Tc-3 and Tc-7 (1923)
* Several DH 53 Hummingbird monoplanes were launched and recovered by airship R33 (1924), followed by two Gloster Grebe fighters (1925).
* A glider and a biplane were recovered by the USS Los Angeles. These were followed by the F9C Sparrowhawk escort fighter which flew operationally from USS &quot;Akron&quot; and &quot;Macon&quot; (1935).

* Ohka Rocket plane on the Mitsubishi G4M.
* Short S.20 and Short S.21 composite used for transatlantic mail (1937).
* The Polikarpov I-16 modified into a dive bomber carrying two 250 kg bombs (variant TsKB-29), flown from a Tupolev TB-3 as the Zveno-SPB (&quot;composite dive bomber&quot;), was the first parasite aircraft to see combat (1941)
* The Messerschmitt Me 328 escort fighter was intended to fly from the Dornier Do 217/Heinkel He 274, but this was unsuccessful due to engine problems.
* The XF-85 Goblin was an attempt to equip B-36 bombers with their own escort fighters (1948)
* The RF-84K was a more successful attempt to provide the B-36 with a parasite escort fighter in the FICON project (1952)

== Parasite aircraft in popular culture ==
In the 1957 Jet Pilot movie, featuring John Wayne, parasite fighters are an important part of the plot.

The 1989 movie Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade, a Bücker Bü 131 Jungmann biplane is stolen by Indy and his father to escape the zeppelin.

<text>The terms Old Boys and Old Girls are the usual expressions in use in the United Kingdom for former pupils of primary and secondary schools. While these are traditionally associated with independent schools, they are also used for some schools in the state sector. The term is also used for those who attended schools in the Commonwealth realm, a few universities in the UK and, to a lesser extent, schools in Australia, Canada, New Zealand, Republic of Ireland, South Africa and Spain.

The Old Boy form is given a specific identification for each school. Some schools use an adjectival form of the school name, such as &quot;Old Etonian&quot;, &quot;Old Harrovian&quot;, or &quot;Old Oundelian&quot; (old boys of Eton College, Harrow School, and Oundle School). Some use a Latin form derived from the Latin name of the school or its location as &quot;Old Novaportan&quot; (old boys of Adams&#x27; Grammar School, Newport, Shropshire). Some are based on the name of the founder, such as &quot;Old Wykehamist&quot; and &quot;Old Alleynian&quot; (for old boys of Winchester College, founded by William of Wykeham, and Dulwich College, founded by Edward Alleyn). Some are based on the school&#x27;s location or street, such as &quot;Old Gowers&quot; (for University College School, originally in Gower Street). Many of the schools have histories dating back several hundred years, and the Old Boy forms may have been in use for a hundred years or more. Other more recently established schools have devised Old Boy names that are distinctive to prevent confusion with other schools. The tradition for many girls&#x27; schools has been to use the term &quot;Seniors&quot; rather than &quot;Old Girls&quot;.

Almost all of these schools have old boy associations that use the official name. Some schools have amalgamated or been renamed through various transformations, but they usually maintain a consistent name for their old boy associations. Many of these schools have teams that compete nationally in sports such as cricket, rugby union, association football, field hockey and golf, and these teams are usually referred to by the standard Old Boy name, although some also have nicknames. In deference to this tradition, the standard &quot;Old Boys&quot; is often used for sporting clubs and used as part of many sporting associations and clubs worldwide. Examples include Argentine football club Newell&#x27;s Old Boys, New Zealand rugby union club High School Old Boys RFC and Swiss football club BSC Old Boys.

<text>Alex Greenwald is an American musician, actor, and record producer. He is the lead vocalist of the California rock band Phantom Planet.

==Life and career==
Greenwald is American. In 1994, Greenwald formed Phantom Planet in his teens with four friends – guitarist Darren Robinson, bassist Sam Farrar, guitarist Jacques Brautbar, and drummer Jason Schwartzman. The band is best known for producing the song &quot;California&quot;, which was used as the theme song of the teen drama &quot;The O.C.&quot;, which lasted four seasons. Phantom Planet announced their hiatus on November 25, 2008.

In 2006, he collaborated with DJ Mark Ronson, to cover the Radiohead song, &quot;Just&quot;. The cover appears on the compilation album &quot;Exit Music: Songs with Radio Heads&quot;, as well as the Mark Ronson album, &quot;Version&quot;. He appeared with Ronson at the 2007 Glastonbury Festival where he climbed up on to the lighting rig of the John Peel stage during the performance of &quot;Just&quot;, and also sang &quot;California&quot;. In 2010, he collaborated once again with Ronson on the album &quot;Record Collection&quot;, on which Greenwald shares writing credits on six out of the eleven tracks. He became part of Ronson&#x27;s band, The Business Intl. for this record. He was also a member of Los Angeles band blackblack, until 2007. At live shows, he was known for 1980s-style dance moves, which were inspired from watching David Byrne of Talking Heads.

Greenwald is a vegan and has appeared in at least two ads for PETA. He told PETA his reasons for going vegan: &quot;In college I stopped eating red meat on a bet with my girlfriend at the time. She bet she could stop smoking, and I bet that I could stop eating red meat. She started smoking again, so I won, which I&#x27;m always proud of.…I had been a vegetarian as a child for whatever reason. I guess kids sometimes follow their instincts…My friend dared me to go vegan as I was reading this book &quot;Fast Food Nation&quot;, which opened my eyes to a lot of cruelties.…Ever since then, I&#x27;ve been vegan and enjoyed it daily.&quot;

Greenwald co-produced and appeared on ex – Panic! at the Disco members Ryan Ross and Jon Walker&#x27;s new band, The Young Veins debut record, &quot;Take a Vacation!&quot;.

He played bass and produced several tracks on The Like&#x27;s second studio album &quot;Release Me&quot;.

He is currently part of the group Phases (previously named JJAMZ), and signed to Warner Bros. Records.

==JJAMZ==

JJAMZ was a band composed of Greenwald along with James Valentine (Maroon 5), Jason Boesel (Rilo Kiley/Conor Oberst), Michael Runion (solo), and Z Berg (The Like). The group was started at karaoke night at Guys in Hollywood. The band name is an acronym, using the first letter of each member&#x27;s name. The group was a means of escape from each member&#x27;s respective band at the time. &quot;JJAMZ started at an interesting time in all of our lives. We all needed some kind of escape from relationships or our other bands. It was a tumultuous time, and the lyrics just came out. It was like word vomit. I can&#x27;t remember,&quot; said Z Berg in one of their first interviews as a band. The band played their first concert at the Echo Plex on January 27, 2009. The band released their first and only album, &quot;Suicide Pact&quot;, on July 10, 2012. It was released through Dangerbird Records.

==Phases==
Following Valentine&#x27;s departure from JJAMZ, the band changed its name to Phases. Signed to Warner Bros. Records, Phases is composed of Greenwald, Z Berg, Jason Boesel, and Michael Runion.

==Mark Ronson &amp; The Business International==
Greenwald is the executive producer and one of the musicians in The Business International. He also helped to write several of the songs on their album &quot;Record Collection&quot;. He is one of the lead singers in the song &#x27;The Night Last Night&#x27;, and appeared in the music video for &quot;The Bike Song&quot;.

==Cameos==
In addition to the commercials for the Gap and his appearance in the 2001 film &quot;Donnie Darko&quot;, Greenwald appeared in two music videos for the electronica band M83 – &quot;Don&#x27;t Save Us From the Flames&quot; and &quot;Teen Angst&quot;, the video for Uffie&#x27;s &quot;ADD SUV&quot; and also in videos for Mark Ronson, including the video for &quot;Just&quot;.

==Personal life==
In 2013, Greenwald began a relationship with actress Brie Larson. In May 2016, Larson&#x27;s representative confirmed that the pair was engaged. On January 10, 2019, it was reported that Greenwald and Larson had called off their engagement. In June 2020, it was confirmed that Greenwald and Australian actress Phoebe Tonkin were in a relationship.

<doc id="842588" wikidata="Q17028173" url="?curid=842588" title="Hydrargyrum quartz iodide">
<text>Hydrargyrum quartz iodide (HQI) is a trademark name of Osram&#x27;s brand of metal halide lamps made for general floodlighting, arena floodlighting, shop and commercial and industrial lighting. &quot;Hydrargyrum&quot; is the Latin name for the element mercury. When heated, mercury vapour is created inside the lamp, and deposited when it cools.

An HQI lamp consists of a protective outer glass shield surrounding two heavy wires which are inserted into each end of a smaller inner quartz arctube containing argon, mercury and metal halides. The lamp is powered by an electrical ballast, which regulates the current flow through the arc in the arctube, and an ignitor, to make the high voltage pulse that is necessary to start the arc in the arctube. Like all HID lamps, HQI lamps operate under high pressure and temperature, and require special light fixtures for safe use.

HQI lamps can produce different color temperatures when manufactured with different metal halides. They are relatively efficient light sources producing a high lumen per watt ratio (approximately 6x that of incandescent lamps).

Like HMI, HQI lamps are a subset (or type) of metal halide lamps, which in turn are a subset of high-intensity discharge (HID) lamps. They should not be confused with halogen lamps, which are a specialized type of incandescent lamp.

<doc id="842599" wikidata="Q298769" url="?curid=842599" title="Antipope Ursicinus">
<text>Ursicinus, also known as Ursinus, was elected pope in a violently contested election in 366 as a rival to Pope Damasus I. He ruled in Rome for several months in 366–367, was afterwards declared antipope, and died after 381.

==Background==
In 355, Emperor Constantius II, who was sympathetic towards the Arians, banished Liberius for refusing to subscribe to a sentence of condemnation against Saint Athanasius, staunch opponent of Arius of Alexandria.

Liberius was sent to a prison in Berea in Thrace. The Collectio Avellana says that Damasus was a deacon in Rome; Alban Butler and the &quot;Encyclopedia Britannica&quot; name him an archdeacon of the Roman Church. In any event, Damasus followed Liberius into exile, though he immediately returned to Rome. Having sworn to have no Pope but Liberius, members of the Roman clergy then chose the Archdeacon Felix as his successor, an action that proved unpopular with the general populace. During the period before Liberius&#x27; return, Damasus had a great share in the government of the church.

In May 357, at the insistence of a number of prominent Romans, Liberius was allowed to return. Apparently the Emperor expected Felix and Liberius to rule jointly, but when Liberius returned, Felix was forced to retire to Porto, near Rome, where, after making an unsuccessful attempt to establish himself again in Rome, he died on 22 November 365. However, the rival parties remained highly polarized in Rome.

==History==
Liberius died on 24 September 366. The upper-class partisans of Felix threw their support to Damasus, but the opposing supporters of Liberius, the deacons and laity, supported Ursicinus; the two were elected simultaneously, in an atmosphere of rioting. Supporters already clashed at the beginning of October. Such was the violence and bloodshed that the two &quot;praefecti&quot; of the city were called in to restore order, and after a first setback, when they were driven to the suburbs and a massacre of 137 was perpetrated in the basilica of Sicininus (as cited in Ammianus Marcellinus), the prefects banished Ursicinus to Gaul. There was further violence when he returned, which continued after Ursicinus was exiled again.

Church historians, such as Jerome and Rufinus, took the part of Damasus. At a synod in 378 Ursicinus was condemned and Damasus exonerated and declared the true pope. The former antipope continued to intrigue against Damasus for the next few years, and unsuccessfully attempted to revive his claim on Damasus&#x27;s death. Ursicinus was among the Arian party in Milan, according to Ambrose (&quot;Epistle&quot; iv).

A decree of 502 under Pope Symmachus ruled that laymen should no longer vote for the popes and that only higher clergy should be considered eligible.

<text>Ilmari R. Salminen (21 September 1902 – 5 January 1986) was a Finnish long-distance runner, winner of the 10,000 metres at the 1936 Summer Olympics.

Salminen became one of the best long-distance runners in the 1930s when he began his international athletics career in 1934 by winning the 10,000 m and taking bronze in 5000 m at the first European Championships in Turin, thus becoming a main favorite at the Olympic 10,000 m run.

On the first day of competitions in the Berlin Olympics, Salminen won the 10,000 m final before compatriots Arvo Askola and Volmari Iso-Hollo. Salminen managed to hold off Askola by a margin of 0.2 seconds. In the 5000 m final a few days later, Salminen finished in sixth place.

In the next season, Salminen ran a new 10,000 m world record of 30:05.6. He also ran a new world record in six miles. Salminen finished his international career by winning the gold medal in 10,000 m at the 1938 European Championships and retired from athletics after the next season. He later became a sports official and headed the organizing committee of the 1952 Summer Olympics in Helsinki.

<doc id="842605" wikidata="Q20652361" url="?curid=842605" title="Antipope Benedict XIV">
<text>Benedict XIV is a name used by two closely related minor antipopes of the 15th century. The first, Bernard Garnier became antipope in 1424 and died . The second, Jean Carrier, became antipope and apparently left office, whether by death or resignation, by 1437.

== 1st Benedict XIV ==

Neither of these claimants was supported by more than a very small faction within the Church. They claimed to be the successors to Benedict XIII, one of the parties to the great Papal Schism. In 1417, the Council of Constance resolved the Schism, proclaiming Martin V the new Pope and demanding that Benedict XIII renounce his claim. Benedict XIII, however, remained at a castle in Peñíscola (kingdom of Valencia) and continued to maintain supporters. He died in 1423, but, the day before his death, he created four cardinals loyal to him, in order to ensure the Avignon line. Three of these cardinals met and elected Antipope Clement VIII. However, one of Benedict XIII&#x27;s cardinals, Jean Carrier, disputed the validity of this election. Carrier, acting as the College of Cardinals by himself, elected Bernard Garnier, who took the name Pope Benedict XIV, instead. Carrier was the archdeacon of Rodez, near Toulouse, and Garnier had been the sacristan of Rodez Cathedral.

Garnier conducted his office secretly and was known as the &quot;hidden pope&quot;: a letter from the Count of Armagnac to Joan of Arc indicates that only Carrier knew Benedict XIV&#x27;s location. Garnier&#x27;s reign as Benedict XIV ended at his death in 1429 or 1430, although he named four of his own cardinals, one of whom was named Jean Farald.

== 2nd Benedict XIV ==

Following Garnier&#x27;s death, Jean Carrier elected himself as the new pope, and also styled himself Pope Benedict XIV. Carrier, however, had been captured and imprisoned by Antipope Clement VIII. Carrier finished his days in captivity in the castle of Foix.

==In fiction==
Some imagine that cardinals loyal to him elected a series of increasingly marginal antipopes in 1437 and 1470. For instance, this is the scenario in the 1995 novel &quot;l&#x27;Anneau du pêcheur&quot; by the French writer Jean Raspail.

<text>:&quot;Antipope Clement VIII should not be confused with Pope Clement VIII.&quot;

Clement VIII, born Gil Sánchez Muñoz y Carbón (1369/70 – 28 December 1445/46), was one of the antipopes of the Avignon obedience, reigning from 10 June 1423 to 26 July 1429. When King Alfonso V of Aragon reached an agreement with Pope Martin V, Sánchez Muñoz abdicated, made his submission and was appointed bishop of Mallorca.

==Biography==
Gil Sánchez was born in Teruel between 1369 and 1370. He was a friend and advisor of the future Avignon anti-pope Benedict XIII, and member of the Avignon curia. In 1396 he was an envoy to the Bishop of Valencia to get Spanish support. Benedict had appointed four cardinals, and on his death, three of them, on 10 June 1423, elected Sánchez Muñoz as Pope. The fourth, Jean Carrier, absent at the time, declared the election invalid, and elected his own antipope in turn, who took the name Benedict XIV. Consequently, Jean Carrier was excommunicated by Clement VIII.

Clement VIII&#x27;s fate was bound up with the ambitions of Alfonso V of Aragon. Alfonso wished to negotiate for Naples, and so gave Clement support; his queen Maria of Castile, and the Aragonese bishops supported Martin V. In the summer of 1423 Alfonso persuaded the Republic of Siena to acknowledge Clement VIII, thus securing recognition for the pope of the Avignon line in the very city, Pavia, which was part of the Republic of Siena, where the Roman pope Martin V had convened an ecumenical council of the Church.

However, through the exertions of Cardinal Pierre de Foix, an able diplomat and relation of the King’s, an agreement was reached between Alfonso and the Pope. Alfonso then sent a delegation in 1428 (headed by Alfonso de Borgia, the future Callixtus III), to persuade Clement to recognise Martin. Clement declared his abdication on 26 July 1429 and had his cardinals elect Oddone Colonna (Martin V) his successor, a formal act precluding future doubts concerning apostolic succession. His abdication was confirmed in mid-August. Clement had to make a penitential submission &quot;in forma&quot; to Martin V, and when this was done Martin granted Sánchez Muñoz the Bishopric of Mallorca. Sánchez Muñoz died on 28 December 1445 or 1446.

<doc id="842611" wikidata="Q356636" url="?curid=842611" title="Antipope Callixtus III">
<text>Callixtus III (also Calixtus III or Callistus III; died between 1180 and 1184) was an antipope from September 1168 until his resignation in August 1178. He was the third antipope elected in opposition to Pope Alexander III during the latter&#x27;s struggle with the Emperor Frederick Barbarossa.

Callixtus&#x27; baptismal name was John. He entered the Vallombrosan monastery of Struma near Arezzo as a boy. In November 1158, the emperor placed the Vallombrosan under imperial protection. By that time, John was the abbot of Struma and one of the most important supporters of the emperor in Tuscany. After the disputed papal election of 1159, he supported the imperial candidate Victor IV over Alexander III. He was rewarded by Victor with the cardinal-bishopric of Albano, but was not immediately consecrated, rather continuing on as abbot.

After the death of Victor&#x27;s successor, Paschal III, on 20 September 1168, his supporters gathered in Rome to elect a new (anti-)pope. John was chosen that same month. He took the name Callixtus and sent Umfredo, (pseudo-)cardinal of Santa Susanna, to Germany to inform Frederick of his election. He found the emperor at an imperial diet in Bamberg in June 1169. Frederick, who was in negotiations with Alexander III to end the schism at the time, did not immediately recognize Callixtus&#x27; election. According to Cardinal Boso of Santa Pudenziana, a partisan of Alexander III, Frederick was &quot;inwardly deeply grieved&quot; by the election of Callixtus, whom he had never met. Nevertheless, Frederick expressed his intention to go with an army to Italy in 1170 to restore the unity of the Church. No such expedition took place, however.

Late in 1169, Callixtus sent Umfredo and Sigewin, cardinal-bishop of Viterbo, as legates to Germany. They brought a pallium for Baldwin I, the new archbishop of Bremen. Frederick ordered a collection in Germany for Callixtus. Frederick recognized Callixtus only after his negotiations with Alexander broke down. The antipope was primarily a bargaining chip with which the emperor could pressure Alexander, and had only limited geographical support in comparison to Victor IV and Paschal III. He held Rome itself, but was acknowledged only in part of the Papal States, in his native Tuscany and in the Rhineland. He and his legates issued privileges for several monasteries in the Upper Rhineland. He mainly resided in Viterbo.

In 1173, Callixtus sent Martin, cardinal-bishop of Tusculum, to Germany as legate to help mediate an alliance between Frederick and King Louis VII of France. For the next three years nothing is known of Callixtus&#x27; activities. Frederick, when it became politically expedient, after the defeat of Legnano, switched his backing to Alexander. In November 1176, he signed the Pact of Anagni, which did, however, protect Callixtus by granting him an abbacy and restoring the cardinals he had created to their former offices. These terms were confirmed in the final Peace of Venice in July 1177.

Callixtus did not immediately recognize the Peace of Venice, but in 1178 Archbishop Christian of Mainz, the imperial chancellor, marched an army into Italy to retake the Papal State and Rome for Alexander. This rendered Callixtus&#x27; position at Viterbo untenable, and he fled to Monte Albano. On 29 August 1178, Callixtus submitted to Alexander III at Tusculum and abjured the schism. The pope entertained him with a feast. Some of his obstinate partisans sought to substitute a new antipope, and chose one Lando di Sezze under the name of Innocent III.

Alexander appointed Callixtus rector of Benevento. He still held that position in 1180, but by 1184 he was dead.

<doc id="842612" wikidata="Q3435716" url="?curid=842612" title="Datalore">
<text>&quot;Datalore&quot; is the thirteenth episode of the first season of the American science fiction television series &quot;Star Trek: The Next Generation&quot;, originally aired on January 18, 1988, in broadcast syndication. The story was created by Robert Lewin and Maurice Hurley, and turned into a script by Lewin and the creator of the show, Gene Roddenberry. It was Roddenberry&#x27;s final script credit on a &quot;Star Trek&quot; series. The director was originally to be Joseph L. Scanlan, but following delays in pre-production caused by script re-writes, it was reassigned to Rob Bowman.

Set in the 24th century, the series follows the adventures of the Starfleet crew of the Federation starship Enterprise-D. In this episode, the &quot;Enterprise&quot; crew discover and reassemble Data&#x27;s &quot;brother&quot;, Lore (both Brent Spiner), who is in league with the entity that destroyed the colony on his home world.

The story underwent significant changes prior to filming, with it originally meant to be a romance episode for Data with a female android. It was then altered to an &quot;evil twin&quot; plot at the suggestion of Spiner and elements of Data&#x27;s origin were introduced, first as an alien creation and then at the hands of Dr. Noonien Soong. Soong was named by Roddenberry after a friend in the Second World War. Edits to the script continued to be made during filming, and while the look of the episode was praised by cast and crew, the characterisations in the script were not. Ratings for the episode came in at 10.3 million for the first broadcast, which was lower than both the previous and subsequent episodes. Critical reception has been mixed, with criticism directed mostly at the quality of the script and Spiner praised for his dual role.

The visuals for the Crystalline Entity were some of the first computer generated graphics on the television show.

==Plot==
While on the way to Starbase Armus IX for computer maintenance, the &quot;Enterprise&quot; arrives at the planet Omicron Theta, the site of a vanished colony where the starship &quot;Tripoli&quot; originally found the android Data (Brent Spiner). An away team travels to the surface and finds that what had been farmland is now barren with no trace of life in the soil. The team also finds a lab which they discover is where Dr. Noonien Soong, a formerly prominent but now discredited robotics designer, built Data. The team also find a disassembled android nearly identical to Data and return with it to the ship. As the course to the Starbase is resumed, the crew reassemble and reactivate Data&#x27;s &quot;brother&quot; (also played by Brent Spiner) in sickbay. He refers to himself as Lore, and explains that Data was built first and he himself is the more perfect model. He feigns naiveté to the crew, but shows signs of being more intelligent than he is letting on. Later, in private, he tells Data that they were actually created in the opposite order, as the colonists became envious of his own perfection. He also explains that a crystalline space entity capable of stripping away all life force from a world was responsible for the colony&#x27;s demise.

Lore then incapacitates Data, revealing that he plans to offer the ship&#x27;s crew to the entity. When a signal transmission is detected from Data&#x27;s quarters, Wesley Crusher (Wil Wheaton) arrives to investigate. He finds Lore, now impersonating Data, who explains that he had to incapacitate his brother after being attacked. Wesley is doubtful, but pretends to accept the explanation. Soon after, the same crystalline entity that had attacked the colony approaches the ship. Lore, still pretending to be Data, enters the bridge as the object hovers before the &quot;Enterprise&quot; and explains that he incapacitated his brother by turning him off, causing Doctor Beverly Crusher (Gates McFadden) to be suspicious, since Data had previously treated the existence of such a feature as a closely guarded secret. Lore then explains that he can communicate with the crystalline entity and suggests to Captain Jean-Luc Picard (Patrick Stewart) that he should show a demonstration of force by beaming an object toward the entity and then destroying it with the ship&#x27;s phasers.

Lore&#x27;s attempts to imitate Data are imperfect, though, arousing Picard&#x27;s suspicion, especially when Lore does not recognize Picard&#x27;s usual command to &quot;make it so&quot;. Although Picard sends a security detachment to tail him, Lore overpowers Lt. Worf (Michael Dorn) and evades pursuit. Meanwhile, the suspicious Dr. Crusher and her son, Wesley, reactivate the unconscious Data, and the three of them race to the cargo hold to find Lore plotting with the entity to defeat the &quot;Enterprise&quot;. When Lore discovers them, he threatens Wesley with a phaser and orders Dr. Crusher to leave. Data quickly rushes Lore and a brawl ensues. Data manages to knock Lore onto the transporter platform, and Wesley activates it, beaming Lore into space. With its conspirator no longer aboard, the crystalline entity departs, and the &quot;Enterprise&quot; resumes its journey to the starbase.
Data uses a contraction at the end of the episode. Picard asks Data if he is alright, Data responds I&#x27;m fine.

==Production==

The original story for this episode featured a non-lookalike female android who was intended to be a love interest for Data. The new android was intended to have been created as something that could be deployed into dangerous or hazardous situations, described in the premise as something along the lines of a female android version of Red Adair, the fire fighter. The &quot;evil twin&quot; story was suggested by Brent Spiner, instead, and was originally developed to include the creation of Data by an alien race. This was instead dropped and Dr. Noonien Soong was introduced. Soong was named by Gene Roddenberry after his Second World War friend, Kim Noonien Singh, for whom the character Khan Noonien Singh was also named. It would be Roddenberry&#x27;s final script credit on a &quot;Star Trek&quot; series. The script made mention of Isaac Asimov and the Laws of Robotics, something which had been suggested should be included at some point in the show as a spoken credit in a memo dated October 28, 1986 from executive producer Bob Justman. The episode suffered delays during pre-production caused by re-writes to the script, resulting in the script being switched with &quot;The Big Goodbye&quot;, which meant that director Joseph L. Scanlan went on to direct that episode instead. Rob Bowman, who had previously been told by Justman that he was going to direct &quot;The Big Goodbye&quot; after his work on &quot;Too Short a Season&quot;, was instead assigned to direct &quot;Datalore&quot;.

He took the new episode on as a challenge, in the belief that the producers did not think the episode would work well, which caused him to become determined to put out a good episode. He had numerous discussions with Brent Spiner, Justman, and Rick Berman on aspects of the episode, and the technical requirements and effects required an additional day of filming. Bowman credited Spiner for making the episode work, giving one example, &quot;He did the one scene in his own office with Brent sitting down and Lore discussing what it&#x27;s like to be human. He did one side, we shot through a double, then turned around, read it the other way and shot the other half of it. Those two characters in those scenes are different people... he really painted those characters differently.&quot; Edits were still being made to the script during filming, as the writers wanted to introduce a new element to Data, in order to further distinguish him from Lore: an inability to use contractions. Data had used contractions during earlier episodes, and Spiner refused to shoot the scene until a final decision was reached; production stopped while there was a meeting on this subject between Gene Roddenberry, the producers, and the writers, in the middle of the bridge set.

The music for the episode was composed by Ron Jones, and was later released on the second disc of the album &quot;Star Trek: The Next Generation: The Ron Jones Project&quot;. For this episode, Jones created a six-note theme to represent Lore. The crystalline entity was given a theme of three notes which played through two pieces entitled &quot;Crystal Entity&quot; and &quot;Crystal Attacks&quot;. The music played when the away team explore Omicron Theta was similar to that created by Jerry Goldsmith for the 1979 film &quot;Alien&quot;. Jones acknowledged that link saying that, &quot;I was playing with the stuff like Jerry&#x27;s music at the beginning of &quot;Alien&quot;, Bowman was like our Ridley Scott—he was like Ridley Scott Jr. and I was Jerry Goldsmith Jr.&quot;

Executive producer Maurice Hurley was pleased with the outcome of the episode, saying &quot;The sets, the design of it and the look of that show was brilliant, I thought that might have been the best-looking show of the first season&quot;. However, he felt that the characterisations were not quite right. This was the same opinion as that put forward by actor Brent Spiner, who portrayed both Data and Lore, who thought that Data&#x27;s actions were not in line with his expectations of the character. This episode was the second and last appearance of Biff Yeager as Chief Engineer Argyle. He was the only one of the Chief Engineers introduced during the first season to appear twice, with Geordi La Forge (LeVar Burton) gaining the role in season two. Wil Wheaton later recalled that the stand-in actor used in this episode really irritated Spiner, and was never used again. He described the stand-in as looking like &quot;a break dancer doing the Robot&quot; whenever he had to portray Data or Lore, and said that &quot;I think the guy was really into playing an android, and his enthusiasm got cranked up to eleven, but by the end of the week, pretty much everyone wanted to deactivate him and sell him to the nearest Jawa.&quot; The events of the episode would be followed up in later seasons, with the crystalline entity returning in the fifth-season episode &quot;Silicon Avatar&quot;. Brent Spiner reprised the role of Lore in the episodes &quot;Brothers&quot; and &quot;Descent&quot;.

===Special effects===
The presentation of the Crystalline Entity alien this episode was re-created in computer generated graphics for the HD release on Blu-ray discs of &quot;Star Trek: The Next Generation&quot;.

The original standard definition Crystalline Entity effect was also computer generated, and it was one of the first uses of CGI graphics on the show.

==Reception==
&quot;Datalore&quot; was first broadcast on January 18, 1988, in broadcast syndication. The episode received Nielsen ratings of 10.3 million on the first broadcast, which was a dip between &quot;The Big Goodbye&quot; which received ratings of 11.5 in the previous week, and &quot;Angel One&quot; which gained ratings of 11.4 million in the next week.

Several reviewers re-watched the episode after the end of the series. Keith DeCandido reviewed the episode for Tor.com in June 2011. He summed up, &quot;While it&#x27;s important in the grand scheme of things in what it establishes about Data&#x27;s background, the episode itself is horrendously bad, from the clumsy script to the embarrassingly inept body-double work.&quot; He thought the ending was anticlimactic, that the characters all acted &quot;as dumb as posts&quot;, and that Spiner&#x27;s performance as Lore was scenery chewing. DeCandido gave &quot;Datalore&quot; a score of four out of ten. Cast member Wil Wheaton watched the episode for AOL TV in December 2007. While he credited the art direction of the episode, he criticised the story, saying that &quot;it comes down to lazy writing that has things happen because they&#x27;re supposed to happen, rather than having them happen organically. The characters are credulous when they should be skeptical, the audience is not surprised by anything after the second act, and there are story problems that should have never gotten past the first draft.&quot; He remembered really enjoying the episode as a child, but felt that it did not hold up on repeat watchings as an adult, and stated that Spiner&#x27;s &quot;fantastic job creating distinctly different characters in Data and Lore&quot; was not enough to remedy the other faults in the episode. He gave it a D grade.

Michelle Erica Green, who reviewed the episode for TrekNation in May 2007, thought she might be more forgiving in hindsight as she knows that the follow-ups to &quot;Datalore&quot; were great episodes. She praised Spiner&#x27;s &quot;lovely, subtle performances as both Data and Lore&quot;, but felt that Lore&#x27;s motivations and goals were unclear, and that the crew came off as stupid by their inaction to the Lore threat. She thought that transporting the villain into space was shocking (as the show generally presents androids as having personhood) and inconsistent (as Lore had just told the entity to attack when the shields drop following a transporter activation). Jamahl Epsicokhan at his website &quot;Jammer&#x27;s Reviews&quot; valued the episode for providing backstory to Data, but agreed that the crew&#x27;s inability to recognize Lore&#x27;s threat and unwillingness to listen to Wesley made them seem stupid. He gave the episode a score of three out of four.

Zack Handlen watched &quot;Datalore&quot; for &quot;The A.V. Club&quot; in April 2010. He noted that Data&#x27;s origins had significant plotholes, such as that the ship which found Data did not investigate the planet. He thought that Lore was a well-conceived villain who works well with Spiner&#x27;s strengths as an actor, but that the story only scratched the surface of the character&#x27;s potential. He considered the contraction issue a problem, as despite saying that Data could not use them, he uses them throughout the episode, including immediately after Lore was beamed off the ship, which &quot;punishes you for paying attention, because now you&#x27;ll be half-convinced that the wrong robot was beamed away, and that Lore somehow won out in the end.&quot; He disliked the response of the crew to Wesley and thought that he was being mistreated, and gave the episode an overall grade of B−.

The Crystalline Entity was noted by Space.com as being one of the more exotic aliens in the &quot;Star Trek&quot; franchise; they note its snowflake like appearancebeautiful but deadly.

In 2016, &quot;Empire&quot; ranked this the 38th best out of the top 50 episodes of the more than 700 &quot;Star Trek&quot; television episodes.

In 2020, Space.com recommended watching this episode as background for &quot;Star Trek: Picard&quot;.

In 2020, &quot;GameSpot&quot; noted this episode as one of the most bizarre episodes of the series.

In 2020, SyFy Wire recommended this episode for binge watching, noting how it explores Data&#x27;s origins and relationships.

==Home media and theatrical release==

The episode was released as part of the season one Blu-ray set on July 24, 2012. In order to celebrate the 25th anniversary of &quot;Star Trek: The Next Generation&quot; and promote the release of the first season on Blu-ray, the episodes &quot;Datalore&quot; and &quot;Where No One Has Gone Before&quot; received a theatrical release in the United States on July 23, 2012, in nearly 500 cinemas. &quot;Datalore&quot; was chosen by &quot;Star Trek&quot; experts Mike and Denise Okuda because of the fan favourite status of Brent Spiner.

Episodes from &quot;Encounter at Farpoint&quot; to &quot;Datalore&quot; were released in Japan on LaserDisc on June 10, 1995, as part of &quot;First Season Part.1&quot;. This included half the first-season episodes with a total runtime of 638 minutes on 12-inch optical video discs.

<doc id="842613" wikidata="Q1368689" url="?curid=842613" title="Takashi Yoshimatsu">
<text>is a Japanese classical music composer. He is well known for composing the score for the 2003 remake of &quot;Astro Boy&quot;.

==Biography==
Yoshimatsu was born and raised in Yoyogi, Tokyo. He did not receive formal musical training while growing up. Yoshimatsu was a fan of The Walker Brothers and The Ventures when he was 13, but symphonies of Ludwig van Beethoven and Pyotr Ilyich Tchaikovsky fascinated him when he was 14. When he entered Keio High School, he had hoped to go to medical school, but eventually changed his aspirations to become a symphony writer. While studying at the Faculty of Engineering at Keio University, he became an apprentice of Teizo Matsumura. Although he says that he was not influenced in any way by Matsumura&#x27;s style, his 1974 solo piano piece, &quot;To the companion star of Sirius&quot; (Op. 1), shows a strong influence of contemporary music, including Matsumura&#x27;s. He was introduced to Manabu Kawai, a professor at Tokyo University of the Arts, who encouraged him to study harmony and counterpoint, but he gave up taking lessons after a few months and left the university in March 1974. At this time, while composing music as art music, he was also fascinated by progressive rock music such as Pink Floyd, Yes, Emerson, Lake &amp; Palmer, etc., and joined rock bands as a keyboard player.

In 1975, through Matsumura&#x27;s introduction, Yoshimatsu met Isao Harada, and on November 28, 1978, he made his debut as a composer by presenting &quot;Forgetful Angel&quot; at a private concert hosted by Harada (although he received no fee for the composition). In the meantime, he entered composition competitions about 20 times and was unsuccessful; however, in 1980, &quot;Dorian&quot; for orchestra was selected for the Composition Prize of the Foundation for the Promotion of Symphony Music. He composed a number of pieces before making his name with the serialist &quot;Threnody to Toki&quot; in 1981. In Hiroshi Aoshima&#x27;s book &quot;Composer&#x27;s Way of Thinking&quot; (Kodansha&#x27;s New Library of Knowledge, 2004), there is a description that he won the Otaka prize for &quot;Threnody to Toki&quot; (p. 263), but Yoshimatsu himself has denied this on his website.

Soon afterwards, Yoshimatsu became disenchanted with atonal music, and began to compose in a free neo-romantic style with strong influences from jazz, rock and Japanese classical music, notably in his Guitar Concerto (1984).

To date, Yoshimatsu has composed six symphonies and twelve concertos: one each for bassoon, cello, guitar, trombone, alto saxophone, soprano saxophone, marimba, chamber orchestra, traditional Japanese instruments, and two for piano (one for the left hand only and one for both hands). He has also written a number of sonatas, and various shorter pieces for ensembles of various sizes. His &#x27;Atom Hearts Club Suites&#x27; for string orchestra explicitly pay homage to the Beatles, Pink Floyd and Emerson, Lake &amp; Palmer.

==Musical style==
Takashi Yoshimatsu is a contemporary composer. The majority of his work is triadic and contains simple, repeated progressions, or in some cases pandiatonicism. Often extended tertian harmonies are followed by whole tone harmonies (such as in the first movement of Symphony No. 5; or the first movement of his &quot;Cyber Bird&quot; Concerto for alto saxophone, which, in addition, makes use of free atonal jazz; or the final movement of his &quot;Orion Machine&quot; Concerto; or in his Saxophone Concerto &quot;Albireo Mode&quot;). His works for Japanese traditional instruments (such as &quot;Subaru&quot;, and &quot;Within Dreams, Without Dreams&quot;) make use of traditional Japanese scales and tunings.

He has published some essays and primers about classical music.

<text>Gregory VIII (died 1137), born Mauritius Burdinus (&quot;Maurice Bourdin&quot;), was antipope from 10 March 1118 until 22 April 1121.

==Biography==
He was born in the Limousin, part of Occitania, France. He was educated at Cluny, at Limoges, and in Castile, where he was a deacon at Toledo. In 1098/1099 his Cluniac connections recommended him as Bishop of Coimbra. After a four-year pilgrimage to the Holy Land, he was made Archbishop of Braga in 1109. There he was one of the principal agents of the Burgundian Henry, Count of Portugal, in his reorganization of the Portuguese church.
Portugal was then a fief of León, and the ambitious Count Henry pursued a vigorous program of ecclesiastical and political autonomy. By 1114, Mauritius had become embroiled in a dispute with the Spanish primate and papal legate in Castile, Bernard of Toledo, to the extent that he was called to Rome and suspended by Pope Paschal II (1099–1118). Nevertheless, he found favor at the papal court, and in 1116, when Emperor Henry V (1105–1125) invaded Italy during the ongoing confrontations over the Emperor&#x27;s rights of investiture of clerics, Paschal II sent Mauritius with some cardinals on an embassy to the emperor, while the Pope and the Curia fled south to Benevento. Mauritius openly espoused the cause of Henry, and defected to the Emperor&#x27;s side. Henry V went to Rome, and on Easter Sunday, March 23, 1117, was crowned Holy Roman Emperor by Mauritius. Paschal II deposed and excommunicated Henry V and removed Mauritius from office.

===Papacy===
When Paschal II died on 24 January 1118, he was succeeded by Pope Gelasius II (1118–19). Henry V went to Rome but Gelasius II escaped to Gaeta and refused to meet the Emperor to discuss German affairs. Partly in reprisal the imperial party among the cardinals then annulled Gelasius II&#x27;s election, and on March 1, 1118 Mauritius was proclaimed Pope, taking the name Gregory VIII. Gelasius II, at Capua, proceeded to excommunicate both Gregory VIII and Henry V on April 7, 1118.

After Gelasius II&#x27;s death, when Calixtus II had been elected Pope in 1119, Henry V was induced to change papal allegiance, in the Concordat of Worms of 1122. Calixtus II entered Rome, and Gregory VIII left, going to Sutri, where he was in April 1121, when papal troops of Calixtus II closed up the city for eight days until its citizens surrendered antipope Gregory VIII. He was taken to Rome and imprisoned in the Septizonium. After having been moved in confinement from monastery to monastery, he finally died at La Cava, Salerno, some time after August 1137.

==Cardinals==
No information has been found about the cardinals created by Gregory VIII, but it is known that in March 1118 three cardinals created by Antipope Clement III (1080/84-1100) joined his obedience and formed his own Sacred College:
*Romanus — cardinal-priest of S. Marco and provost of the titular church of S. Marcello
*Cinthius — cardinal-priest of S. Crisogono
*Teuzo — cardinal-priest, former legate of Clement III in Hungary

<doc id="842624" wikidata="Q3368702" url="?curid=842624" title="Pathmark">
<text>Pathmark is a supermarket brand owned by Allegiance Retail Services, a retailers’ cooperative based in Iselin, New Jersey, USA. Pathmark currently has one location in East Flatbush, Brooklyn, New York, which it has operated since 2019.

From 1968 until 2015, Pathmark operated a chain of supermarkets throughout the northeastern United States. The chain was founded by Supermarkets General, which previously operated ShopRite stores as a member of the Wakefern cooperative and chose to go into business for itself as a direct competitor. The company would eventually take the Pathmark name and would later be purchased by competing supermarket chain A&amp;P in 2007.

Before its initial closure, Pathmark previously operated stores in New York, New Jersey, Connecticut, Pennsylvania, Delaware, and Maryland. In 2007, &quot;Supermarket News&quot; ranked Pathmark No. 31 in its annual &quot;Top 75 North American Food Retailers&quot; based on Pathmark&#x27;s 2006 estimated sales of $4.1 billion (~$ in ). Based on 2005 revenue, Pathmark was the 67th largest retailer in the United States.

Pathmark was well known for its radio and television commercials starring character actor James Karen, who was the chain&#x27;s spokesperson for more than 20 years. Pathmark&#x27;s original spokesperson was Arlene Francis, who appeared in its commercials beginning almost immediately after Pathmark left the ShopRite cooperative. Peter &quot;Produce Pete&quot; Napolitano had starred in many of the company&#x27;s commercials from 2001 until 2009.

After A&amp;P filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy in 2015, Pathmark&#x27;s remaining stores were liquidated and closed. In 2016, Allegiance Retail Services purchased the Pathmark name and all intellectual property with the intention of reviving the well-known brand. The brand&#x27;s first new location opened in Brooklyn, New York on April 12, 2019. The company has stated that they will see how this first location performs before opening additional locations.

==History==
===Supermarkets General and Pathmark ===
Pathmark was formed out of the Wakefern Food Corporation, parent company of ShopRite, Wakefern was both a wholesale operation and a retail operation; among its members was a subgroup, Supermarkets Operating Co., in Union, New Jersey, formed in 1956 by Alex Aidekman, Herb Brody, and Milt Perlmutter. This company operated ShopRite stores; in 1963 it branched into non-food retail by acquiring Crown Drugs.

In 1966, Supermarkets Operating Co. and General Super Markets (another subgroup within Wakefern) merged to become Supermarkets General Corporation, with Perlmutter as president. At this time, Supermarkets General operated 75 ShopRite stores across Connecticut, Delaware, Maryland, New Jersey, New York, and Pennsylvania, with annual sales of about $420 million (~$ in ). Supermarkets General achieved high volume by opening large stores in densely populated areas and keeping prices low on both nationally branded-goods and private-label items.

In an attempt to diversify, Supermarkets General bought Genung&#x27;s Inc., a White Plains retailer that operated the Howland&#x27;s and Steinbach department stores in 1967. It also acquired the New Jersey–based Rickel home centers in 1968 and Hochschild Kohn stores of the Baltimore area in 1969.

In 1968, Supermarkets General left the Wakefern cooperative, renaming its ShopRite stores Pathmark. Pathmark&#x27;s stores included not only supermarkets (33 of which had a drug department with a pharmacy) but 11 freestanding drugstores and 11 gasoline stations.

Pathmark&#x27;s 81 supermarkets were accounting for about 85 percent of Supermarkets General&#x27;s sales and 80 percent of its earnings in 1969.

===1970s===
The number of Pathmark supermarkets had reached 91 in October 1971, with 38 others either a gas station or a drugstore. In May 1972, many Pathmark locations began operating 24 hours a day. It was the first New York-area supermarket chain to have stores with overnight hours. By February 1973, 90 of the company&#x27;s 99 stores were open around the clock. That year, Pathmark instituted a price freeze on hundreds of products to help combat rising costs.

In September 1974, Pathmark introduced the use of computer scanners at checkout counters in its Middlesex Mall location. At this time, the company operated 104 Pathmark stores. By this time, Pathmark&#x27;s profit margins had slipped to as low as 0.18 percent.

In 1977, after relative stagnation, Pathmark opened its first 50,000-square-foot (4,600 m2) Super Center in Jericho on Long Island. These larger, discount grocery stores also offered health and beauty products, small appliances, and videotape rentals. Also in 1977, Pathmark started a joint venture with the Bedford-Stuyvesant Restoration Corporation to bring a community grocery store to the Bed-Stuy section of Brooklyn. It proved to be one of the company&#x27;s most successful stores.

Perlmutter died in 1978 and was succeeded by Louis Lowenstein as chief executive officer of Supermarkets General. After about a year, Lowenstein was removed and replaced by vice chairman Herb Brody in 1979.

===1980s===
In February 1982, Leonard Lieberman was named president and chief operating officer of the Supermarkets General Corporation and Herbert Brody became vice chairman and chief executive officer. That month, the company agreed to acquire Pantry Pride, which operated 150 supermarkets in Florida, Georgia, and Virginia. However, the deal fell through by April when shareholders sued to stop the sale.

Pathmark sales reached $2.8 billion (~$ in ) in 1982, when it was the nation&#x27;s 10th-largest supermarket chain. In 1983, Pathmark opened its first Manhattan superstore, a 42,600-square-foot (3,960 m2) unit, in Pike Slip, near Chinatown. At this time over 100 Pathmark locations included pharmacy departments and 27 had Barnes &amp; Noble bookstore departments. Pathmark continued to dominate Supermarkets General&#x27;s sales and operating profits, accounting for 87% of sales and 83% of operating profit, respectively.

In January 1984, 7,000 butchers and delicatessen clerks at 336 Pathmark, ShopRite, Grand Union, and Foodtown supermarkets in New Jersey and New York voted to go on strike during contract negotiations. A tentative agreement was able to be reached after a 26-day strike. In July the company announced the acquisition of Purity Supreme, including 28 supermarkets and 14 Heartland warehouse stores. The chain was still No. 1 in the New York metropolitan area in 1985, with a 12.5 percent sales share.

In order to foil a takeover bid by Dart Group Corp., Supermarkets General agreed to be acquired by Merrill Lynch Capital Markets Inc. and its own senior managers for $1.58 billion in April 1987. Pathmark president Kenneth Peskin replaced Leonard Lieberman as chairman and chief executive officer. To help pay down related debt, the company sold 25 of its Heartland and Pharmacity drug stores in New Hampshire and Massachusetts to the Melville Corporation, which operated CVS at the time.

Although corporate sales reached $6 billion (~$ in ) in fiscal 1989 (which ended January 28, 1989), the 51-unit Rickel subsidiary was performing poorly, while Pathmark, now with 142 stores, had slipped to third place in the New York area. Many Pathmark units had become &quot;unkempt, dirty, and outmoded&quot; stocked with &quot;scores of the dreary no-frills offerings customers have shunned for years.&quot; Merrill Lynch fired Chief Executive Kenneth Peskin, replacing him with Jack Futterman.

In November 1989, Robert E. Wunderle, the company&#x27;s chief economist and vice president of public affairs, was found shot to death in a Rockaway drainage ditch. Police theorized it was a mob hit related to Wunderle&#x27;s role with union negotiations, but the case was never solved.

===1990s===
By 1991, Pathmark had 146 supermarkets and 32 drugstores. In April, Supermarkets General announced it would be spending $385 million over the next three years to expand its Pathmark supermarket division. In July, Purity Supreme was sold off. The company introduced its new concept, Pathmark 2000, in 1992. These stores were up to 64,000 square feet and included produce, seafood, baked goods, flowers, health and beauty products, video rentals, film processing, and UPS delivery; and restrooms with tables for changing diapers.

In March 1993, Supermarkets General announced it was planning to take the company public, though this was later cancelled. It also spun off Rickel Home Centers and sold it a year later. It also split off its distribution and transportation business. That October, in a corporate reorganization, Supermarkets General Corp., a subsidiary of Supermarkets General Holdings Corp., changed its name to Pathmark Stores, Inc.

In 1994, Pathmark added to its private-label products, introducing Pathmark Preferred, an upscale line to match its mid-tier Pathmark and generic No Frills brands. Pathmark&#x27;s over 3,300 private-label items were accounting for about 24 percent of its sales. On April 30, 1994, Pathmark opened its third Super Drug discount store in Connecticut. In November, the company closed seven stores in Pennsylvania after union workers rejected a proposal to cut employee salaries.

By 1995, there were 27 Pathmark 2000 stores in operation. In August 1995, Pathmark launched Chef&#x27;s Creations, which offered a menu of entrees, side dishes, and salads, made daily by a team of chefs.

Pathmark was named 1995 &quot;Pharmacy Chain of the Year&quot; by the magazine &quot;Drug Topics&quot;, the first time a supermarket had won the award. Of Pathmark&#x27;s 142 supermarkets, all had pharmacies except six found in shopping centers. Prescriptions accounted for nearly 7% of Pathmark&#x27;s sales volume in 1994.

In May 1995, Purity Supreme supermarkets and its Li&#x27;l Peach convenience stores were sold to Stop and Shop. In June, Pathmark reduced its pharmacy operations, selling 30 of its 36 freestanding drugstores to Rite Aid Corp. for $60 million (~$ in ) in order to concentrate on its in-store pharmacies. In December, Pathmark announced it would be closing its six remaining drugstores operating under the &quot;Super Drug&quot; banner in Connecticut. Pathmark&#x27;s two remaining Connecticut supermarkets, in Bridgeport and Norwalk, were closed in September 1998, signaling Pathmark&#x27;s exit from New England.

In February 1996, Pathmark announced a restructuring of the company that split its two operating divisions into five marketing regions covering 30 stores each: New York City and Connecticut, Long Island, northern New Jersey, central New Jersey and the Greater Philadelphia area. In March, chief executive Jack Futterman left the company and president Anthony Cuti quit in April. Pathmark appointed James Donald, formerly with Safeway and Walmart, as its chief executive and chairman that October. By January, he had the company cut about a third of its executives. In late 1996, Pathmark introduced Chef&#x27;s Creations To Go, fresh, prepackaged meals for takeout, offering choice entrees and side dishes in microwavable containers.

After five years, construction began in August 1997 on Pathmark&#x27;s controversial $14.5 million (~$ in ) supermarket on 125th Street in Manhattan&#x27;s East Harlem. This unit was the largest supermarket in Harlem, and had been bitterly opposed by owners of neighborhood convenience stores. This Pathmark was expected to generate hundreds of construction jobs, and within the store, which would include a pharmacy and a Chase bank branch. It opened for business in April 1999. Pathmark was planning its biggest Bronx store in 1998: a unit on in the blighted area east of Crotona Park.

In fiscal year 1997 (ending February 1, 1997), the parent company had a net loss of $20 million on sales of $3.71 billion. This included a charge the company took for the upcoming sale of 12 unprofitable Pathmark stores, mostly in southern New Jersey. Pathmark&#x27;s supermarket sales came to all but $9 million of the corporate total. Same-store sales decreased 2.8 percent from the previous fiscal year, primarily due to heavy competition.

In October 1997, Pathmark announced that C&amp;S Wholesale Grocers of Brattleboro, Vermont would take over its Woodbridge, New Jersey distribution facilities and become the chain&#x27;s supplier for almost all groceries and perishables. The facilities also included a frozen food distribution facility in Dayton, New Jersey, a complex for dry groceries in New Brunswick, New Jersey, and one for general merchandise in Edison, New Jersey. It had processing facilities for delicatessen products in Somerset, New Jersey and for banana ripening in Avenel, New Jersey. Pathmark received $50 million from the deal, which was used towards its $1.47 billion debt.

===Failed Ahold bid and bankruptcy ===
In March 1999, Royal Ahold, a Dutch supermarket company which operated Edwards stores in the New York area, agreed to a $1.75 billion deal to acquire Pathmark. Under the terms of the deal, Edwards Super Food Stores would become Pathmark stores. The sale was abandoned after the FTC rejected Ahold&#x27;s offer to divest overlapping stores, saying the offer would &quot;not preserve competition&quot; in the New York area. Ahold ultimately cancelled the deal and later announced that it would rebrand Edwards stores as Stop &amp; Shop.

In September 1999, the company started selling prepackaged veal, lamb and pork products instead of fresh cut meat. In November, Pathmark opened its first, smaller community store in the Kew Gardens of Queens.

Because the FTC did not allow Pathmark&#x27;s acquisition plans, it filed for bankruptcy in July 2000, recovering a year later. In February 2001, Pathmark bought six Grand Union supermarkets after C&amp;S bought the chain. In March 2002, Stop and Shop purchased 26 Big V Supermarkets, selling nine of them to Pathmark. In March 2005, Yucaipa Companies paid $150 million for a 40 percent stake in Pathmark.

In February 2007, Pathmark partnered with Wild Oats Markets by adding Wild Oats-brand private label goods to the 141 Pathmarks. Approximately 150 organic and natural products were included in the partnership, among them: Italian sodas, balsamic vinegar, organic fruit spreads, and flatbread crackers.

===A&amp;P Takeover and Pathmark Sav-A-Center===
In March 2007, Pathmark&#x27;s competitor A&amp;P bought it for $678.6 million. Conditions for the acquisition included the sale of five Waldbaum&#x27;s locations and one Pathmark store. Pathmark and A&amp;P remained separate banners. Store level staff were not affected, while buying and back-office functions were consolidated. A&amp;P sold off Pathmark&#x27;s Carteret, New Jersey headquarters in June 2008. The merger was approved on December 3, with the sale completed that month.

In spring 2008, Pathmark introduced a &quot;price impact&quot; store concept, under the Pathmark Sav-A-Center brand. This format was introduced to remodeled stores in Irvington and South Edison, New Jersey. The Sav-A-Center name had been used for A&amp;P stores in the 1980s, and for an A&amp;P-owned chain of stores in the New Orleans area which were sold in 2007.

After the concept was tested in the two Northern New Jersey stores, A&amp;P announced the conversion of 16 Pathmark Super Centers, plus eight of the 13 Philadelphia-area A&amp;P Super Fresh stores to the Pathmark Sav-A-Center banner. A&amp;P eventually rolled out the Sav-A-Center branding to Pathmark&#x27;s website and circulars.

In 2009, several changes were made to Pathmark. In July, the Randolph, New Jersey store was closed. A former A&amp;P in nearby South Plainfield opened as a Pathmark Sav-A-Center. The North Plainfield Pathmark also closed as part of this store consolidation. Meanwhile, A&amp;P was updating its former Super Center branding by retrofitting older stores with new interior decor to comply with its Sav-A-Center branding.

===A&amp;P bankruptcy filings and closing===

In August 2010, A&amp;P announced it would close 25 stores, including nine Pathmark locations in New Jersey.

On December 12, 2010, A&amp;P filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection, citing assets of $2.5 billion and debts totaling $3.2 billion. The company emerged from bankruptcy protection on March 13, 2012, making its six supermarket divisions, including Pathmark, private.

In August 2011, a Super Fresh store opened in the Northern Liberties section of Philadelphia in place of a planned Pathmark, reflecting the parent company&#x27;s diminished faith in the Pathmark banner.

In August 2012, an employee of the Old Bridge, New Jersey Pathmark opened fire on his coworkers with an assault rifle while working an overnight shift. Two employees were killed before he took his own life.

On July 26, 2013, the Wall Street Journal reported that A&amp;P was seeking to sell the company after emerging from bankruptcy in 2012.

On July 19, 2015, A&amp;P filed for Chapter 11 protection for the second time in less than five years. The company announced that 25 stores would be closed immediately, including 16 Pathmark locations. Other locations were sold. By November 25, 2015, all Pathmark stores were either closed or sold to other chains such as Acme Markets, Stop &amp; Shop, Key Food, ShopRite, and other competitors.

===Revival===
In 2016, Allegiance Retail Services LLC bought up several stores and the corporation&#x27;s intellectual property. It renovated and reopened the East Flatbush Pathmark store in April 2019.

<doc id="842628" wikidata="Q312861" url="?curid=842628" title="Antipope Philip">
<text>Antipope Philip () was an antipope who held office for just one day, on 31 July 768.

In 768, Philip was a priest serving in the monastery of St. Vitus on the Esquiline. Rome was in turmoil following the death of Pope Paul I, as rival factions sought to elect a pope to succeed him. The Primicerius, Christophorus, and his son Sergius, the papal treasurer, had sought Lombard help to depose Pope Constantine II, who was the candidate of the military faction in Rome.

The Lombard king, Desiderius, agreed to provide troops, and sent a Lombard priest, Waldipert, to act as his representative, with authority to deal with Christophorus and Sergius. Waldipert accompanied Sergius in an attack on Rome that ended Constantine&#x27;s papacy. When Constantine had been taken captive, Waldipert, without alerting Sergius, and most likely following instructions from Desiderius, collected a number of Romans and entered the Monastery of St. Vitus on the Esquiline on Sunday, 31 July. There they approached Philip, declared that Saint Peter had chosen him as pope, and escorted him to the Lateran Basilica.

Here, after having the customary prayers read over him by a bishop found for the occasion, Philip held the traditional feast in the Lateran palace, attended by a number of dignitaries from both Church and State. Christophorus had by now returned to Rome and was approaching the city gates. Learning of Philip&#x27;s uncanonical election, he stated to the Romans who had gone out to greet him, that he would not enter Rome until Philip was removed. Philip&#x27;s election was declared invalid, he was declared guilty of simony, the pontifical garments were removed from him, and he was forced to return to his monastery. Christophorus entered Rome and oversaw the election of Stephen III.

After his deposition and return to the monastery, Philip was never seen nor heard from again, and died in obscurity.

<text>Edwin Black (born February 27, 1950) is an American historian and author, as well as a syndicated columnist, investigative journalist, and weekly talk show host on The Edwin Black Show. He specializes in human rights, the historical interplay between economics and politics in the Middle East, petroleum policy, academic fraud, corporate criminality and abuse, and the financial underpinnings of Nazi Germany.

==Biography==

===Early years===

Black is the son of Holocaust survivors from Poland. His mother, Ethel &quot;Edjya&quot; Katz, from Białystok, told of narrowly escaping death during the Holocaust by escaping a boxcar en route to the Treblinka extermination camp as a 13-year old in August 1943. After escaping, she was shot by militiamen and then rescued by a Polish Jewish fighter whom she later married. Black&#x27;s father described escaping death by fleeing to the woods from a long march to an isolated &quot;shooting pit&quot; and subsequently fighting the Nazis as a Betar partisan. The pair survived World War II by hiding in the forests of Poland for two years, emerging only after the end of the conflict and emigrating to the United States.

Of his own origins, Black has written: &quot;I was born in Chicago, raised in Jewish neighborhoods, and my parents never tried to speak of their experience again.&quot; In his book &quot;The Transfer Agreement&quot;, Black notes that following in the beliefs of his parents, he was from his earliest days a supporter of the State of Israel. As a young man he spent time on a kibbutz, visited Israel on several other occasions, and gave earnest consideration to permanent residency there.

===Career===
Black started working as a professional journalist while still in high school, later attending university where he further developed the craft. He also was a frequent freelance contributor to the four major Chicago newspapers of the day, the &quot;Tribune,&quot; the &quot;Daily News,&quot; the &quot;Sun-Times,&quot; and &quot;Chicago Today,&quot; as well as such weeklies as &quot;Chicago Reader&quot; and &quot;Chicago Magazine.&quot; In the late 1970s, he was the editor of &quot;Chicago Monthly.&quot;

One of Black&#x27;s first forays into investigative journalism began in 1970 with a commission from &quot;Atlantic Monthly&quot;. He was tasked with finding out about an alleged plot to assassinate President Kennedy in Chicago on November 2, 1963. For Black it was a long and difficult assignment that finally resulted in his November 1975 article in &quot;Chicago Independent&quot; magazine. He noted in the article how he became the subject of government harassment. His apartment was broken into and his files &quot;were obviously and clumsily searched.&quot; He described his many months of scrutinizing documents, following hundreds of leads, and conducting dozens of interviews. But he wrote that his main source of information was a Secret Service agent on duty at the time of the events in Chicago. Although Black did not name this agent, it is strongly believed to have been Secret Service whistleblower Abraham Bolden.

In 1978, Black interviewed the American Civil Liberties Union lawyer who represented members of the American Nazi Party, which had marched provocatively through the predominantly Jewish Chicago suburb of Skokie. In preparing himself for that interview, Black&#x27;s interest was piqued by the hidden history of relations between the government of Adolf Hitler and German-Jewish Zionists during the initial years of the Nazi regime. Five years of research followed, ending in the 1984 publication of his first book, &quot;The Transfer Agreement: The Dramatic Story of the Pact Between the Third Reich and Jewish Palestine&quot;.

In the early 1990s, Black served as the editor-in-chief for &quot;OS/2 Professional&quot; magazine and &quot;OS/2 Week&quot;, and reported on OS/2 users and technology. Black&#x27;s books have typically made use of networks of volunteer and professional researchers assembled for each project. Three years before completion of his 2001 book, &quot;IBM and the Holocaust,&quot; Black began to put together what would ultimately become a team of more than 100 researchers, translators, and assistants to work on discovery and analysis of primary source documents written in German, French, and Polish. In all, more than 20,000 documents from some 50 different libraries, archives, museums, and other collections were assembled and analyzed in the writing of the book.

In 2006, Black wrote an article on Iran and the Holocaust, claiming that there was an &quot;Iran-Nazi alliance&quot; during World War Two, that Reza Shah was inspired to rename his country from Persia to Iran by Nazi agents, and that &quot;Iran and its leaders were not only aware of the Holocaust, they played both sides&quot; because Jewish refugees passing through Iran had to pay exorbitant fees. The article was criticized by the Iranian historian Abbas Milani, who instead argued that Iran did not charge any money at all, that Nazi agents had no role in Reza Shah&#x27;s renaming decision, and that there was no Iran-Nazi alliance. 

In the fall of 2012, it was reported that Plan B, the production company owned by actor Brad Pitt, had taken an option on a cinematic adaptation of Black&#x27;s &quot;IBM and the Holocaust.&quot; Marcus Hinchey, co-writer of the 2010 film &quot;All Good Things,&quot; was tapped for script-writing responsibilities. Black has written on topics beyond that of 1933–1945 German history, including books on the issue of oil dependence, the history of Iraq, and alternative energy. He is presently a syndicated columnist in publications in the United States, Israel, and elsewhere. Black has also occasionally written on the subject of film and television music, contributing opinion pieces and composer interviews to various print and online publications. An aficionado of musical soundtracks, Black regularly credits specific works which have provided &quot;musical inspiration that propelled the writing&quot; in the introductory notes to each book.

In 2010, in his book &quot;The Farhud&quot;, Black resurrected the &quot;Forgotten Pogrom&quot;, the bloody June 1–2, 1941, pogrom against the Jews of Baghdad, known as the Farhud, sometimes called the Iraqi Kristallnacht. In 2015, Black founded the annual commemoration, International Farhud Day, which he proclaimed at the United Nations in a live globally-streamed event in 2015. The remembrance has been recognized and observed in many countries and in 2021, it was reported in the media that 10,000 people in numerous countries lit candles. He originated the Yom HaGirush commemoration, November 30, commemorating the expulsion of 850,000 Jews from Arab countries after the State of Israel was declared its independence, in a broadcast of the Edwin Black Show in 2021.

Black has coined or popularized certain words and terms. These include: &quot;petropolitical&quot; in lectures during the 1973 Arab Oil Embargo; &quot;digital ghetto&quot; and/or &quot;algorithm ghetto&quot; in 2001 during lectures on the book &quot;IBM and the Holocaust&quot;, and again at the 2018 Michigan Holocaust Day Commemoration.

Black has written an article critical of Wikipedia, &quot;Wikipedia—The Dumbing Down of World Knowledge&quot;.

===Selected book tours===

In February and March 2014, Black embarked upon a &quot;Parliamentary Tour&quot; in which he appeared at four parliaments in a four-week period, including the House of Commons of the United Kingdom in London, the European Parliament in Brussels, the Knesset in Jerusalem, and the Foreign Affairs Committee of the United States House of Representatives in Washington D.C.

In November and December 2014, Black went on a 45-event &quot;Human Rights Tour&quot;. In North Carolina, Black reportedly appeared nine times in three days speaking out against the persecution of Yazidis, Shia Muslims, and Christians in Iraq, racial injustice in the United States, and its impact on the November elections, as well as environmental injustice arising out of oil addiction, journalistic ethics in covering human rights, bias against Jews in Israel, and a health care crisis in the Middle East.

From May 31 to June 3, 2016, Black embarked upon a 100-hour, four-city, three-country commemoration book tour to observe International Farhud Day on the 75th anniversary of the Farhud. Black originated International Farhud Day the year before. The tour began on May 31 in the morning in the House of Representatives in Washington, D.C., then shifted to the Edmond J. Safra Congregation in New York the evening that same day. On June 2, he led the book and commemoration ceremony in London with the Israeli Embassy at the Lauderdale Rd Synagogue. On June 3, he arrived in Israel for a series of Farhud book and commemoration events that ended with a ceremony in the Knesset.

In a disputed election following the death of Pope Felix IV, the majority of electors picked him to be pope, in spite of Pope Felix&#x27;s wishes that Boniface II should succeed him. However, Dioscorus died less than a month after the election, allowing Boniface to be consecrated pope and Dioscorus to be branded an antipope.

==Deaconry==
Originally a deacon of the Church of Alexandria, Dioscorus was forced to flee as an opponent of Miaphysitism, arriving in Rome around 506 during the Laurentian schism. There, he was adopted into the ranks of the Roman clergy, and soon acquired considerable influence in the Church of Rome. Jeffrey Richards credits him with persuading king Theodoric the Great to recognize Symmachus as the rightful pope. Later, under Pope Hormisdas, he served as papal &quot;apocrisiarius&quot;, or legate, to the court of Emperor Justinian I at Constantinople, ending the Acacian schism, and was instrumental in persuading Hormisdas to reject Theopaschism. During the pontificate of Felix IV he became the recognized head of the pro-Byzantine party.

==Papal selection==
Pope Felix IV wished Boniface to succeed him, partially to avoid the riots that had occurred on his own accession. Further, Richards describes him as being part of the pro-Gothic party of clergy, bishops and aristocrats, and his &quot;principal concern, however, was to ensure that the pro-Gothic party remained in control of the papacy.&quot; During the sixth century a tradition had evolved where popes would informally nominate their successors, but Felix went even further and issued a &quot;praeceptum&quot; formally nominating Boniface, and on his sickbed gave his &quot;pallium&quot; to him, on the condition that should Felix recover Boniface would return it. However, the Senate was outraged that it had been preempted from the process, and issued an edict forbidding anyone from accepting the nomination or discussing it during Pope Felix&#x27;s life, on pain of exile and confiscation of property. Richards notes that the clergy did not voice a similar outrage, &quot;perhaps because the majority of the clergy agreed on this occasion with the senate in censuring the action of Pope Felix&quot;.

When the election was held in the Lateran palace on 22 September 530 following the death of Felix, a majority of the electors voted for Dioscorus; Richards concludes at least 60 of the Roman priests supported Dioscorus, based on their subsequent act of submission. Boniface&#x27;s supporters retreated to the Basilica Julia, where they elected Boniface. Dioscorus was later recognized as pope by the East. Although his prospects for his consecration looked dark, the dispute was resolved when Dioscorus died three weeks later on 14 October. The pro-Byzantine faction was left leaderless; Felix&#x27;s wishes were acceded to with his chosen candidate becoming Boniface II.

==Legacy==
According to the &quot;Liber Pontificalis&quot;, Boniface forced the clergy who had nominated Dioscorus to sign a retraction and condemn his memory. This document was later destroyed, although the &quot;Liber Pontificalis&quot; contains contradictory accounts: in one passage, Pope Agapetus I burned the document in front of an audience at the beginning of his tenure, while in another, it was Boniface himself who burned the document.

<doc id="842640" wikidata="Q336684" url="?curid=842640" title="Antipope Clement III">
<text>Guibert or Wibert of Ravenna (8 September 1100) was an Italian prelate, archbishop of Ravenna, who was elected pope in 1080 in opposition to Pope Gregory VII and took the name Clement III. Gregory was the leader of the movement in the church which opposed the traditional claim of European monarchs to control ecclesiastical appointments, and this was opposed by supporters of monarchical rights led by the Holy Roman Emperor. This led to the conflict known as the Investiture Controversy. Gregory was felt by many to have gone too far when he excommunicated the Holy Roman Emperor Henry IV and supported a rival claimant as emperor, and in 1080 the pro-imperial Synod of Brixen pronounced that Gregory was deposed and replaced as pope by Guibert.

Consecrated as Pope Clement III in Rome in March 1084, he commanded a significant following in Rome and elsewhere, especially during the first half of his pontificate, and reigned in opposition to four successive popes in the anti-imperial line: Gregory VII, Victor III, Urban II, and Paschal II. After his death and burial at Civita Castellana in 1100 he was celebrated locally as a miracle-working saint, but Paschal II and the anti-imperial party soon subjected him to &quot;damnatio memoriae&quot;, which included the exhuming and dumping of his remains in the Tiber. He is considered an anti-pope by the Roman Catholic Church.

==Early life==
He was born into the noble family of the Correggio, probably between 1020 and 1030. He had family connections to the margraves of Canossa. A cleric, he was appointed to the Imperial chancellorship for Italy by Empress Agnes in 1058, which position he held until 1063. In 1058 he participated in the election of Pope Nicholas II but on the death of Nicholas in 1061, Guibert sided with the imperial party to elect Cadalous of Parma as Antipope Honorius II against Pope Alexander II. Owing to the active support of Duke Godfrey of Lorraine, of Archbishop Anno II of Cologne, and especially of Peter Damian, Alexander was soon recognized even in Germany and by Empress Agnes which may have been the reason of Guibert&#x27;s dismissal in 1063 from the chancellorship.

Guibert apparently continued to cultivate his contacts within the German court, for in 1072, Emperor Henry IV named him archbishop of the vacant see of Ravenna. And, although Pope Alexander II was reluctant to confirm this appointment, he was persuaded by Hildebrand to do so, perhaps as a compromise for peace. Guibert then took an oath of allegiance to the pope and his successors and was installed at Ravenna in 1073.

==Quarrels with Pope Gregory==
Shortly after Pope Alexander II died Hildebrand was proclaimed the next pope, being installed as Pope Gregory VII on 29 April 1073. Guibert attended the first Lenten Synods of Pope Gregory in March 1074 in Rome at which important laws were passed against simony and the incontinence of the clergy, and lay investiture. The Imperial appointed German bishops were the most important officials of the empire, and a means to balance the ambitions of the territorial princes.

Guibert soon emerged as one of the most visible leaders of opposition to the Gregorian reforms. Having attended Gregory&#x27;s first Lenten Synods, Guibert refused to attend the next, the Lenten Synod of 1075, although he was bound by oath to obey the summons to attend. Guibert was unsympathetic to Gregory&#x27;s opposition to the Imperial Court, which Guibert had served as Chancellor of Italy. By his absence Guibert demonstrated his opposition to Gregory VII, who now suspended him for his refusal to attend the synod.

It was in this same year that Emperor Henry IV began his open conflict with Gregory. At the synod of Worms in January 1076, a resolution was adopted deposing Gregory, and in this decision the pro-imperial bishops of Transalpine Italy joined. Among these must have been Guibert, for he shared in the sentence of excommunication and interdiction which Gregory VII pronounced against the Transalpine bishops at the Lenten Synod of 1076.

Shortly after, in April 1076, bishops and abbots of the imperial Transalpine party convened at Pavia under the presidency of Guibert and proclaimed the excommunication of Gregory VII; a messenger, bearing a caustic personal letter from Henry, was dispatched with the Pavian reply to the pope. In response to the action of Henry&#x27;s 1076 Synod of Worms, Gregory excommunicated Henry IV. Gregory excommunicated Guibert by name at the Lenten Synod of February 1078 and with him his main accomplice Archbishop Tebaldo of Milan.

==Reign as Imperial Opposition Pope==
During the next four years, the Emperor and the Pope reconciled but then quarreled again, and, facing a rebellion among the German nobles, Emperor Henry threatened to depose Pope Gregory. Carrying out his threats, Henry summoned his German and Transpadine partisans to a Synod at Brixen in June 1080, which drew up a new decree purporting to depose Pope Gregory VII, and which Henry himself also signed, and then proceeded to elect Guibert, the excommunicated Archbishop of Ravenna, as pope in opposition to Pope Gregory, whom the Synod considered deposed; Guibert took the name Clement III. Henry recognized Guibert as pope, swearing that he would lead him to Rome, and there receive from his hands the imperial crown.

With Rudolph of Swabia, leader of the rebellious nobles, having fallen mortally wounded at the Battle of Mersburg in 1080, Henry could concentrate all his forces against Gregory. In 1081, he marched on Rome, but failed to force his way into the city, which he finally accomplished only in 1084.

Henry entered Rome on 21 March 1084, and succeeded in gaining possession of the greater part of the city. Gregory took refuge in Castel Sant&#x27;Angelo. On 24 March, Guibert was enthroned as pope in the church of St. John Lateran as Clement III, and on 31 March he crowned Henry IV as Emperor at St. Peter&#x27;s. 

However, with news of the approach of the Norman army of Gregory&#x27;s ally, Robert Guiscard, Duke of Apulia and Calabria, Henry and Guibert abandoned Rome, and, in revenge for Matilda of Tuscany&#x27;s support of Gregory, Henry ravaged her possessions in Tuscany. Guibert withdrew to Ravenna, where he still held the title of archbishop. His influence, after Henry IV&#x27;s withdrawal from Italy, was largely concentrated in Ravenna and a few other districts of Northern Italy, but he also retained some support in Rome.

Gregory was liberated, but the people were incensed by the excesses of his Norman allies, and he was compelled to leave Rome. He withdrew to Monte Cassino, and later to the castle of Salerno by the sea, in 1084, where he died in the following year, 25 May 1085.

The German episcopate stood divided. While bishops of Gregory VII&#x27;s party held a Synod in Quedlinburg, at which they denounced and condemned Guibert, partisans of Henry held a rival Synod at Mainz in 1085, where they approved the deposition of Gregory and the elevation of Guibert. This conflict continued even after the death of Gregory, during the entire reigns of whose successors, Pope Victor III, Pope Urban II, and Pope Paschal II, Guibert continued to be regarded as pope by Henry and his party.

Victor III, who was elected after a prolonged vacancy caused by the critical position of the Church in Rome, was compelled, eight days after his coronation in St. Peter&#x27;s on 3 May 1087, to flee Rome before the partisans of Guibert. The latter were in turn assailed by the troops of Countess Matilda, and entrenched themselves in the Pantheon. However, at the threats of the emperor, Victor was obliged to flee once more.

The succeeding pope, Urban II (1088–1099), spent most of the first half of his pontificate in exile, in southern Italy and in France. Late in 1093 he managed to obtain a foothold in Rome, with help from the Frangipane family, and gradually expanded his power there.

By 1089, Clement III was back in Rome, where in June, he held a Synod declaring invalid the decree of excommunication launched against Henry, and various charges were made against the supporters of Urban II, the pope of the anti-imperial party.
Still, by the mid-nineties his power and authority began to wane. The greater part of the city of Rome was captured by an army under Count Hugh of Vermandois, brother of the King of France. The party of Guibert retained only the Castle of Sant&#x27; Angelo, and even this in 1098 fell into the hands of Vermandois.

In 1099, he repaired to Albano after the accession of Paschal II (1099–1118), hoping again to become master of Rome, but Norman troops compelled him to withdraw. He reached Civita Castellana, where he died 8 September 1100. His followers elected a successor to Guibert, the Antipope Theodoric, who, however, was not a serious threat to the popes of the anti-imperial line, now considered canonical.

<doc id="842643" wikidata="Q315146" url="?curid=842643" title="Capitulation of Wittenberg">
<text>The Capitulation of Wittenberg () was a treaty on 19 May 1547 by which John Frederick I, Elector of Saxony, was compelled to resign the title of elector. The Electorate of Saxony and most of his territory, including Wittenberg, passed from the elder Ernestine line to the cadet Albertine line of the House of Wettin. 

Wittenberg had become the focus of the Protestant Reformation. In 1517, Martin Luther had nailed his 95 Theses against Indulgences on the door of the castle church at Wittenberg, the opening act of the Reformation. In 1520 he burned the papal bull condemning him, and in 1534 the first Lutheran Bible was printed there. The Elector of Saxony was the most important patron of the Lutheran Reformation.

In 1547, Emperor Charles V, with the assistance of the Duke of Alva, captured Wittenberg after the Battle of Mühlberg, where John Frederick I was taken prisoner. The Duke of Alva then presided over a court-martial and condemned John Frederick to death. To save his life, the Elector conceded the defeat of Wittenberg and resigned the government of his country in favor of his relative, Maurice of Saxony. His sentence was thereupon commuted to imprisonment for life. Rescued on 1 September, 1552, he returned to Saxony in a triumphal march, and removed the seat of government to Weimar.

Wittenberg declined after 1547, when Dresden, residence of the Albertine dukes, replaced it as the Saxon capital.</text><links>

SIX Swiss Exchange is completely owned by SIX Group, an unlisted public limited company itself owned by around 120 national and foreign financial institutions.

The exchange in its current state was founded in 1993 by merging the Geneva Stock Exchange, the Basel Stock Exchange and the Zürich stock exchange into the (German for &quot;Swiss Securities Exchanges Association&quot;), publicly known in English as &quot;Swiss Exchange&quot;. The newly created association took over trading in 1995. It was the first stock exchange in the world to incorporate a fully automated trading, clearing and settlement system.

The association was renamed to SWX Swiss Exchange in 1999. In 2002, the association was changed to a public limited company called SWX Swiss Exchange AG. In July 2004, it rejected a merger proposal from Deutsche Börse, which analysts anticipated as profitable for many small companies listed on SWX Swiss Exchange. In 2008, SWX Swiss Exchange merged with SIS Group and Telekurs into the new SIX Group, and was renamed as SIX Swiss Exchange, which is still its name as of 2020. 

SIX Swiss Exchange maintains several major indices. The most known index is the SMI, or Swiss Market Index, which consists of the 20 largest and most liquid companies of the SPI. The SPI, or Swiss Performance Index, contains more than 200 companies listed on the exchange that meet requirements. The SLI, or Swiss Leader Index, is a capped index with some of the largest 30 companies. The SBI, or Swiss Bond Index, tracks obligations emitted in Swiss francs. The market capitalization of all companies listed at SIX Swiss Exchange amounted in 2018 to 1.6 trillion Swiss francs, making it one of the top exchanges in the world by capitalization.

On 23 August 2023, the company formed EuroCTP as a joint venture with 13 other bourses, in an effort to provide a consolidated tape for the European Union, as part of the Capital Markets Union proposed by the European Commission.

== History ==

=== First Swiss exchanges ===
The first exchanges in Switzerland were created locally in major Swiss cities throughout Switzerland, with the authorization of the Cantonal authorities. Geneva paved the way in the year 1850, when the () was founded. Its trading floor was opened in 1855 and approved by the Grand Council of Geneva in 1856. The Basler Börse followed in 1866 or 1876 (sources disagree) in Basel, as well as another one in Zürich in 1873. The Berne exchange, which still exists today, was founded in 1884. Smaller exchanges were also created in Lausanne in 1873, in St. Gallen in 1887 and in Neuchâtel in 1905. The exchanges were subject by the Cantons to a value added tax.

During the First World War, all Swiss exchanges were closed, with the exception of bond trading in the Geneva exchange. The depression of 1920–21 was followed by a bull market in the 1920s, during which a new exchange building (&quot;alte Börse&quot;, German for &quot;old exchange&quot;) was constructed in Zürich at Bleicherweg 5, near Paradeplatz. The building is still standing, but no longer used as an exchange.

After the Great Depression of the 1930s, a federal banking law was introduced. This law is still in effect today and, in its form as of 2020, requires permission by the FINMA to do banking activities, as well as due diligence and banking secrecy. An exchange law was also discussed, but not introduced. Finally, Swiss exchanges were required to unite under a securities exchange association in order to set up a registration office, so that the Swiss National Bank could have the desired influence.

=== Post-war era ===
After the Second World War, banking fees for trades on exchanges were unified in a broker conference. In the middle of the 1950s, the revenues of the exchanges reached new highs as in times before or between the wars until 1929. This development continued until the Kennedy Slide of 1962, which was triggered by measures against the economic slowdown, the New York crash, and the Cuban Missile Crisis. 

Following the deregulation and the termination of the Bretton Woods System (fixed exchange rates) by the United States, in the 1970s, a fundamental transformation of the economy and of the financial landscape started, which is still ongoing today. Fluctuating exchange rates carried new risks for the economy and a need for hedging solutions arose. Finance derivatives were introduced as a response to this need and in 1973, the Chicago Board Options Exchange was created as an exchange that only handles derivatives. With the oil crisis of 1974, the economy went through the biggest after-war recession since 1931. In Switzerland, the oil shock led to such a rush on investment money that it was considered to close the exchanges.

=== New economy ===
The Geneva Stock Exchange, the Basel Stock Exchange and the Zürich stock exchange merged into SWX Swiss Exchange in 1993. On 16 August 1995, the closing bells rang for the last time on the trading floors, ending an era spanning more than a century. They were superseded with the world&#x27;s first automated trading, clearing and settlement system. 

After the international financial markets recovered from the 1997/1998 Asian crisis and the 1998 Russian crisis, there was a period of two years of lasting bull market from October 1998. This bull market was mainly driven by the new economy boom and transition of this time. However, the boom was more limited on Swiss stock indices, since they are dominated by pharmaceutical, food and financial values, while Internet companies and technology companies play only a secondary role. Hence, it was only in May 2000 that the Swiss Performance Index crossed again the peak of 5,237 points that it had reached before the Russian crisis. It reached its then all-time high of 5,770 points on 23 August 2000. The bursting of the dot-com bubble sent stock prices down worldwide, and did not spare Swiss stock indices. The SPI entered a bear market. It had lost more than 20% from its previous peak by 22 March 2001, on which day it reached a temporary bottom. 

After a short recovery phase, the SPI started to erode continuously from May 2001. The 9/11 attacks accelerated this evolution, started with the bursting of the dot-com bubble, further. The SPI reached its bottom of 2,603 points one and a half years later, on 12 March 2003, at the peak of the SARS-epidemic and the Iraq war.

=== SIX Group ===
In May 2007, the SWX Group, the SIS Group and Telekurs Group announced their merger to a new holding called Swiss Financial Market Services AG. The merger was official in 2008 and the new company was renamed to SIX Group AG. SWX Swiss Exchange was renamed to SIX Swiss Exchange in the same year.

== Subsidiaries, acquisitions and joint ventures ==

=== Eurex ===
From 1998 to 2012, SIX Swiss Exchange owned 15% of Eurex, the world&#x27;s second largest futures and derivatives exchange, after the Chicago Mercantile Exchange, along with its German partner Deutsche Börse (85%). Deutsche Börse purchased the 15% ownership from SIX Swiss Exchange in 2012, becoming its sole owner.

=== SWX Europe ===
SWX Swiss Exchange, as was its new name since 1999, acquired the stock exchange platform Tradepoint, renamed as Virt-x, for the trading of 32 Swiss bluechip stocks, regulated by the British Financial Services Authority. The new platform was opened on 25 June 2001. The main goals were on the one hand to build a pan-European exchange and on the other hand to mitigate the migration of the trading volume on SMI stocks to the London exchange.

The listed companies were offered the choice between two market segments for SMI stocks: The EU-regulated market segment and the UK-exchange-regulated market segment. Both segments were subject to the regulations of the British Financial Services Authority, and the EU segment was in addition subject to EU regulations.

Virt-x was renamed to SWX Europe in 2008. SWX Europe came to a halt in 2009 and the trading was transferred to SIX Swiss Exchange.

=== International Securities Exchange ===
On 30 April 2007, SWX Swiss exchange acquired, jointly with Deutsche Börse, the US option exchange ISE. With the acquisition of International Securities Exchange Holding (ISE), one of the largest trading platforms for finance derivatives emerged. The price for ISE was $2.8 billion and it was financed through Eurex, which was then owned 85% by Deutsche Börse and 15% by SWX Swiss Exchange. The revenue of ISE was about $178 million in 2006, and the profit around $55 million. The ISE remains independent and keeps its structure and branding.

=== Scoach ===
On 1 January 2007, SWX Swiss Exchange and Deutsche Börse jointly started and managed an exchange for structured products, a joint venture called Scoach.

In February 2013, Scoach was split into Scoach Europa AG, fully owned by Deutsche Börse, and Scoach Schweiz AG, fully owned by SIX Swiss Exchange. Scoach Schweiz AG was renamed to SIX Structured Products in November 2013.

=== AsiaNext ===
In 2021, SIX Group established AsiaNext, a digital asset exchange for institutions, as a joint venture with SBI Digital Asset Holdings. In 2023, AsiaNext has received a license as a Recognized Market Operator (RMO) by the Monetary Authority of Singapore.

== Headquarters ==
Headquarters were moved to Selnaustrasse in 2002. In 2017, they moved again to the Hard Turm Park in Zürich-West.

== Technological advances ==
For the first time in the world, in 1962, an exchange TV broadcast was introduced in Basel and Zürich. Banks started to use computers, while exchanges followed more hesitantly. In 1964, Telekurs was mandated by the Zürich stock exchange to investigate how computer technologies could be used on the exchange. Only in the 1980s did computers finally find their way into exchanges. On 8 December 1995, an advanced electronic system for the processing of foreign stock in the domestic exchange market was introduced, on 2 August 1996 that of Swiss stock and options. Finally, on 16 August 1996, bonds were also electronically traded and the trading floor was discontinued.

On 3 December 2020, SIX Swiss Exchange, in collaboration with the Bank for International Settlements and Swiss National Bank, completed a wholesale central bank digital currency proof-of-concept on a distributed digital asset platform.

== Other services ==
SIX Swiss Exchange is part of the SIX Group, which provides a number of other financial market infrastructure services in Switzerland. SIX Group is divided into four business units: Securities Services, Markets, Banking Services and Financial Information. These business units include services like clearing, acting as central counterparty, custody services, market data services, share registry, payment services, and running the real-time gross settlement (RTGS) system on behalf of the central bank of Switzerland, the Swiss National Bank.

<doc id="842656" wikidata="Q688957" url="?curid=842656" title="Amboise conspiracy">
<text>The Amboise conspiracy, also called Tumult of Amboise, was a failed attempt by a Huguenot faction in France to gain control over the young King Francis II and to reverse the policies of the current administration of Francis, Duke of Guise and Charles, Cardinal of Lorraine through their arrest, and potentially execution. Malcontent factions of Huguenots had been chafing under the French crown since the reign of Henry II and with the arrival of a new young king, saw their chance to take power for themselves. However the plot was uncovered ahead of time, and the Guise were ready for them. As such hundreds would be arrested, and many killed. Louis I, Prince of Condé was suspected of involvement, however he was able to flee south, and it was only after some months that the Guise were able to put him on trial. Shortly thereafter, the sickly Francis II died, their hold on the administration collapsed, and with it the conviction of Condé. This tumult would be one of the key steps in the collapse of crown authority that led to the first French War of Religion.

==Background==

=== Death of the king ===
On 10 July 1559, after a jousting accident, Henry II of France died suddenly. Premature as his death was, the crown fell to his young son, Francis II, who was only 15 years old, but legally of age to rule. Francis&#x27; wife&#x27;s maternal uncles, Francis, Duke of Guise and Charles, Cardinal of Lorraine moved into the power vacuum, taking control over the young and sickly king&#x27;s administration. They were faced with a formidable crisis; France was 40 million livres in debt, of which 19 million was owed immediately as a result of the Italian Wars. Many royal officials had been without pay for years. Along with this fiscal crisis, the Guise administration was faced with a religious crisis. Despite the persecutions undertaken by Henry II, Protestantism had continued to grow towards the end of his reign, leaving to the new administration the crisis of solving the religious question.

=== Religious policy ===
To solve these twin problems, the Guise set upon a course of religious political continuity, and fiscal cost cutting. The former embodied in four laws in the latter half of 1559, with landlords to be prosecuted if they harboured heretics and meeting houses to be razed to the ground among other provisions. Raids were conducted of suspected Protestant homes, and in Paris these found pamphlets, lambasting the Guise. The trial of the Protestant judge Anne du Bourg which ended in his execution in December after he refused to recant, further fanned the flames of religious tension, which exploded in the capital with the Saint-Médard riot later that month and the assassination of President (of the Parlement) Minard. The backlash to these policies, and the increasing militancy of some Protestants troubled the Guise, who issued new laws, banning the wearing of masks, and long coats that might conceal pistols.

=== Financial policy ===
On the financial side the Guise made equally many enemies, the army was drastically scaled down in size, and payments to troops were deferred, upsetting many soldiers. Some came to the royal residence to voice their displeasure, and were threatened by Lorraine with hanging if they didn&#x27;t vacate the premises. Further, many of the cuts to the administration and new taxes had notable exemptions for the lands of the Guise, and their clients, angering those elites, who were not among their circles. Crown lands were resumed, with the exception of Guises&#x27; holdings of Saumur, Provins and Dourdan further alienating those elites who had benefited from such crown grants. Finally venal office was suppressed, a move which inflamed the title holders who lost their privileges.

==Faction and conspiracy==
=== Factions form ===
No sooner had Henry II died than malcontent factions began to form against the new Guise led government. Those opposed to the Guise sought for Antoine of Navarre to become regent of the kingdom, conscious of his flirtations with Protestantism in the late 1550s. This was despite Francis II being of legal age to rule. This faction further desired the calling of an Estates General, to solve many of what they perceived as the kingdom&#x27;s ills in the past decades. The Guise&#x27;s alienation of elements of the army through their fiscal policy furthered this disgruntled clique, bringing into their number Maligny and Castelnau among others.

=== Conspiracy established ===
Around August 1559 a plan began to consolidate for the coup plot, aiming at first to assert Navarre&#x27;s right to a regency, and, when he proved uninterested, Condé&#x27;s more dubious right as a minor prince of the blood. La Renaudie was tasked to lead this coup attempt. He had personal reasons to want to see the Guise taken from power, the Cardinal of Lorraine having had his brother-in-law executed. La Renaudie boasted that he had the support of John Calvin in Geneva and was given an angry reception when he visited the city hunting for recruits late in the year. 

The large part of the ideological support base for the coup came from petit seigneurs such as de Mauvans and Protestant clerics, such as Antoine de la Roche Chandieu. Alongside military malcontents often from their retinues or clients, many poor soldiers were easily tempted by La Renaudie&#x27;s offer of 10 sous for infantry and 18 sous for cavalry. The church of Provence was the only consistory to be fully onboard, the region, one of great Protestant strength, offering 2000 soldiers to the cause of the coup. Gaspard II de Coligny who had come to terms with the Guise recently was uninterested in involving himself, and did his best to persuade the Protestant nobility of Normandy in his powerbase to stay clear of involvement.

=== Final meeting ===
On 1 February the conspirators met in the forests near Nantes for a &#x27;Parliament&#x27; during which the baron du Raunay offered his nearby château as a springboard for the operation and all participants swore an oath. The location was chosen to coincide with the meeting of the nearby Parlement, to explain the conspirators&#x27; presence in the area.

=== Conspiracy exposed ===
On 12 February, the court left the Château de Marchenoir, where Léonor d&#x27;Orléans, duc de Longueville had been entertaining the young Francis with hunting and other pursuits, and began the journey to Amboise. On the route they were overtaken by the Duke&#x27;s secretary Millet, who had with him a lawyer named . Avenelles&#x27; Paris home had been made into a safe house for the plotters, and he claimed he had gotten uneasy with the conversations he was overhearing. The Guise were soon to give him a reward of 10,000 &quot;livres&quot; for the information he told them, which suggests other motives for his defection however. He elaborated on a conspiracy to arrest de Guise at Amboise, and to force the King to declare a liberty of conscience. He also knew the name of the leader of the conspiracy, La Renaudie. 

Rumours had been swirling for some time that a plot was in the air, however now the Guise had concrete details. They had long suspected Condé of involvement in opposition plots, and he had already been passed over for the governorship of Picardy he had been promised in January. But Condé was cautious, and however greatly involved, he carefully left no written evidence, working instead through servants. Robert Stuart, who had been suspected of involvement in the assassination of President Minard, was brought to Amboise and tortured in the hope he knew the date of the operation. In preparation for the attack much of the high nobility was invited to Amboise, including Coligny and Condé on 21 February, and they duly arrived at the castle.

==Tumult==

=== Pre-emptive strike ===
The first action occurred on 11 March, when a group sent out from Amboise, under the count of Sancerre to Tours where they were able to pick up and arrest around ten of the plotters, including the baron de Castelnau and captain Mazères who were waiting for the delivery of money for the operation. A further 25 conspirators were picked up while they were walking outside the Château de Noizay a small distance from Amboise castle, and the whole group were taken in to the fortress. Most of the captured men would however be released, after a stern rebuke from Chancellor François Olivier, once it was determined they had largely joined the conspiracy over oaths of loyalty or lack of pay.

=== The main body ===
On the morning of 15 March, a new panic set in as 200 horsemen were sighted by boatman on the Loire, making their way down the Blois road to Amboise, wearing white sashes to symbolise their Protestant purity. A several hour fight began in the suburbs between these men and the defenders, ending in their scattering. Condé could do little but watch them flee from the battlements of the castle. In the aftermath of the battle, La Renaudie was hunted down in the woods, and killed, his corpse being taken back to Amboise for display. He would be hung from the gates with a placard which read &quot;La Renaudie also known as la Forest, author of the conspiracy, chief and leader of the rebels.&quot;

=== Mopping up ===
It was now that a fanning out of arrest parties took place. Jacques d&#x27;Albon, Seigneur de Saint André was dispatched with 200 horsemen to Tours, Paul de Thermes was dispatched to Blois, François de Scépeaux to Orléans, and Louis, Duke of Montpensier to Angers. They conducted further arrests during the day, with some of their targets retreating into houses to continue fighting and having to be burned out. On 17 March, Francis II made the duke of Guise lieutenant-general of the kingdom, giving him overall authority of the military. He set about further refortifying Amboise, providing artillery to weak sections, and assigning princes and knights to each quarter of the castle. Further efforts to contain the situation were made. A general amnesty notice was issued for any rebels who returned to their homes within 24 hours; others would be proclaimed rebels, anyone would be allowed to kill them, and their property would be forfeit. Conscious of the confused composition of the insurrection, a provision allowing petitions from subjects if they came to the king &#x27;loyally&#x27; was also granted. 

Over the following days, work continued on the castle, and trenches around it were made. With the arrest parties mopping up stragglers, all relevant bailiffs and seneschals were granted authority to arrest those found in the countryside around Amboise.

== Aftermath ==

=== Immediate consequences ===
With most of the conspiracy&#x27;s leadership captured or killed in the field, the Guise set about interrogating the prisoners they had caught, and examining the papers they had captured from the various raided châteaux. The number of executions that followed has been reported to be as high as 1500, though this appears to be an exaggeration. What was more shocking to aristocratic contemporaries was the summary nature of the executions - even of men of &#x27;good birth&#x27; - who were hanged or drowned in the Loire. The baron de Castelnau was executed, despite the promise of the gentleman who arrested him that if he came quietly he would not be killed. Guise&#x27;s wife Anna d&#x27;Este pled for his life, but to no avail. 

Eager to avoid suspicion, Condé did not immediately depart the scene, and stayed at Amboise, angrily denouncing those who were now murmuring of his involvement as &#x27;scum.&#x27; Once the court had moved off to the Queen Mother&#x27;s residence at Chenonceau, he went further, calling his questioners liars - a cutting rebuke in aristocratic circles - and challenged anyone who would openly accuse him to fight him in single combat. The duke of Guise, aware that for the moment he lacked proof, consoled Condé that he had no suspicions, and in an audience with the King and Queen Mother they accepted his denials, although Lorraine could not help but avoid eye contact. Taking advantage of Condé&#x27;s absence at the King&#x27;s &quot;lever&quot; on April 18, his apartments were raided on the orders of Catherine de&#x27; Medici; however, nothing was found. A few days later, Condé decided that things had finally gone too far, and slipped down south to Bordeaux and the relative safety of his brother&#x27;s household.

=== Edict of Amboise ===
Despite their victory over the rebellion, the Guise were conscious that the religious policy of recent years had decidedly failed, and they sought to take a different path. The general pardon established during the conspiracy itself made a distinction between those of religious motivation and those of political motivation, with the former to be tolerated as long as they lived in obedience to the King, and the latter to be treated as enemies of the state. This represented a sharp contrast from recent policy. This trend would be continued in the Edict of Amboise, which pardoned those convicted of heresy offences as long as they lived as good Catholics from then on. A further shift came next month with the Edict of Romorantin, which transferred heresy cases to ecclesiastical courts that lacked the authority to give the death penalty, effectively ending capital punishment for heresy in France.

=== Lyon and disorder in the south ===

The rebellion may have been crushed in Amboise, but the situation was deteriorating in the provinces. Troops raised for the conspiracy in Dauphiné, Provence, and the Lyonnais were left without central direction, creating the nucleus of guerrilla armies instead. In Montauban, several churches were seized and modified in a Calvinist manner. Meanwhile, an attempt by the governor of Rouen to crack down on Protestants in his city resulted in a riot against him. 

It was in Lyon where the most serious element of the conspiracy outside Paris would occur. On September 7, 1560, 3 days after the discovery of a stockpile of weapons had been found in a leading Protestant church member&#x27;s house, Pierre Menard would be arrested. The house was full of Protestant soldiers who fought their way out of the building before fleeing the town. Menard explained to his captors that Amboise had been part of a wider conspiracy, which was to have involved the capture of Lyon for the Protestants, and that leading Geneva clergy — including John Calvin — were involved. John Calvin&#x27;s letters to Maligny in Lyon confirmed Menard&#x27;s testimony; Calvin referred to Maligny as &quot;our hotspur.&quot;

The narrow foiling of this Lyon plot further angered Guise and Lorraine, who had suspected Condé and Navarre&#x27;s involvement in the affair — a matter seemingly confirmed when an agent sent by Condé was captured with papers implicating him. They called an Assembly of Notables to discuss reforms for the kingdom, and agreed upon a package to present to a planned Estates General. Only Condé and Navarre were absent, being too fearful of arrest. To further isolate the renegade princes, two super-governorships were created for the kingdom, with one given to Charles, Prince of La Roche-sur-Yon and the other to Louis, Duke of Montpensier, thus separating them from their cousins.

=== Arrest, trial and release of Condé ===
No longer able to tolerate this treason, Condé was summoned to join the soon to be convened Estates General of 1560-1. Thoroughly outnumbered by the troops under the Guises and Philip II, they had little choice but to attend. Upon arrival, Condé was arrested on October 31, along with the Vidame of Chartres. Condé filibustered the proceedings, demanding a trial of his peers, and not recognising the authority of his judges. Eventually, though, the trial would proceed, and he would be found guilty, with an indeterminate sentence, likely at the Château de Loches. However, his imprisonment was to be short. Not long after, Francis II, who had always been of fragile health, suffered an ear infection brought about by the cold, and he died on December 5, 1560. This spelled the end for the Guise administration. Soon a regency was arranged for the young Charles IX under Catherine de&#x27; Medici. She negotiated Navarre out of his position as regent (the usual prerogative as first prince of the blood) with the leverage of offering the release of the arrested Condé. Subsequently he was released on 20 December.
