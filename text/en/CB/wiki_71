<text>Vincent Paul DiMaggio (September 6, 1912 – October 3, 1986) was an American Major League Baseball center fielder. During a 10-year baseball career, he played for the Boston Bees (1937–1938), Cincinnati Reds (1939–1940), Pittsburgh Pirates (1940–1945), Philadelphia Phillies (1945–1946), and New York Giants (1946). DiMaggio was the older brother of Joe and Dom DiMaggio.

==Early life==
DiMaggio was born in Martinez, California, and grew up in North Beach, San Francisco. Older than Joe and Dom, Vince was discovered first, and the teenage Joe used to enviously watch him play professional ball. Blessed with some power and good fielding, Vince once claimed that he could run rings around Joe in the outfield.

==Career==

===Minor leagues (1932–1936)===
DiMaggio began his professional career in 1932 with the Tucson Lizards of the Class-D Arizona–Texas League, hitting .347 with 25 homers and 81 RBI. He led the Arizona–Texas League in home runs, with eight more than runner-up Cal Lahman. He played 94 games with the Lizards that year, finishing the season with the San Francisco Seals of the Class-AA Pacific Coast League. With the Seals, he hit .270 with 6 home runs in 59 games.

In 1933, DiMaggio hit .333 with 11 home runs and 65 runs batted in for San Francisco and the Hollywood Stars. He played with the Stars through 1935, joining the San Diego Padres in 1936.

===Major League Baseball===
On December 4, 1936, DiMaggio was traded by San Diego of the PCL to the Boston Bees for Tiny Chaplin, Tommy Thompson and cash. DiMaggio was a regular outfielder for the Bees in 1937 and 1938. In 1937, he hit .256 with a .311 on-base percentage and .387 slugging percentage with 13 home runs. In 1938, DiMaggio hit only .228/.313/.369, but led the Bees with 14 home runs on a team that hit 54 home runs in total. He was tenth in the National League (NL) in homers, sixth in steals (11) and eighth in walks (65). In both 1937 and 1938, he led the NL in strikeouts. His 134 strikeouts in 1938 set a NL record for most strikeouts in one season, breaking Gus Williams&#x27; record of 120 set in 1914.

On February 4, 1939, the Boston Bees sent DiMaggio to the New York Yankees to complete an earlier deal made on August 10, 1938, where the Bees sent players to be named later, Gil English, Johnny Riddle and cash to the Yankees for Eddie Miller. DiMaggio did not play for the Yankees, as they assigned him to their American Association affiliate, the Kansas City Blues.

On August 5, 1939, DiMaggio was traded by the Yankees to the Cincinnati Reds for players to be named later and $40,000. The Reds sent Frenchy Bordagaray and Nino Bongiovanni to the Yankees on January 27, 1940, to complete the trade. DiMaggio appeared in eight games with the 1939 Reds and only two games for the 1940 Reds before the Reds traded DiMaggio to the Pittsburgh Pirates for Johnny Rizzo on May 8, 1940.

DiMaggio spent the majority of his MLB career with the Pirates. In between, he was selected to the All-Star Game in 1943 and 1944. In the 1943 game, DiMaggio collected a home run, triple, single, a pair of runs and one RBI over three at-bats.

On March 31, 1945, he was traded by the Pirates to the Philadelphia Phillies for Al Gerheauser. He then hit four grand slams for the Phillies.

On May 1, 1946, he was traded by the Phillies to the New York Giants for Clyde Kluttz.

In his ten-year MLB career, DiMaggio batted .249 with 125 home runs and 584 RBI in 1110 games.

===Return to the minors===
DiMaggio played for the Oakland Oaks of the PCL in 1947. In 1948, he moved to the Stockton Ports of the California League as a player-manager. He also played for and managed the Pittsburg Diamonds of the Class-D Far West League from 1949 through 1951. He finished the 1951 season, and his professional career, with the Tacoma Tigers of the Class-B Western International League.
==Personal life==
DiMaggio was married with two children, four grandchildren and two great-grandchildren. He died in North Hollywood, California, at age 74 of colon cancer.

DiMaggio worked at the California Shipbuilding Corporation during World War II. &quot;He&#x27;s one of the many former athletic stars who are helping to smash the Axis by building the equipment needed by America&#x27;s fighting men,&quot; according to the Library of Congress.

According to Joe DiMaggio biographer Richard Ben Cramer, the iconic younger brother &quot;didn&#x27;t deal with Vince at all&quot;, never maintaining any meaningful relationship with him. But earlier in his career, DiMaggio had also joked that &quot;If I could hit like Joe and he could talk like me, we&#x27;d make a helluva guy.&quot;

<doc id="832624" wikidata="Q728324" url="?curid=832624" title="Köprülü Mehmed Pasha">
<text>Köprülü Mehmed Pasha (, , ; or &quot;Qyprilliu&quot;, also called &quot;Mehmed Pashá Rojniku&quot;; 1575, Roshnik,– 31 October 1661, Edirne) was Grand Vizier of the Ottoman Empire and founding patriarch of the Köprülü political dynasty. He helped rebuild the power of the empire by rooting out corruption and reorganizing the Ottoman army. As he introduced these changes, Köprülü also expanded the borders of the empire, defeating the Cossacks, the Hungarians, and most impressively, the Venetians. Köprülü&#x27;s effectiveness was matched by his reputation.

==Biography==

===Early life===
He was born in the village of Roshnik in the Sanjak of Berat, Albania to Albanian parents.

===Rise through the imperial service===
He eventually rose to the rank of pasha and was appointed the &quot;beylerbey&quot; (provincial governor) of the Trebizond Eyalet in 1644. Mehmed Pasha&#x27;s early rise was facilitated by his participation in patronage networks with other Albanians in the Ottoman administration. His main patron was the Albanian Grand Vizier Kemankeş Kara Mustafa Pasha who secured Köprülü Mehmed&#x27;s appointment as mirahor.

Later he was to rule the provinces of Eğri in 1647, of Karaman in 1648, and of Anatolia in 1650. He served as vizier of the divan for one week in 1652 before being dismissed due to the constant power struggle within the palace.

In 1656, the political situation in Ottoman Empire was critical. The war in Crete against the Venetians was still continuing. The Ottoman Navy under Kapudan Pasha (grand admiral) Kenan Pasha, in May 1656, was defeated by the Venetian and Maltese navy at the Battle of Dardanelles (1656) and the Venetian navy continued the blockade of the Çanakkale Straits cutting the Ottoman army in Crete from Constantinople, the state capital. There was a political plot to unseat the reigning Sultan Mehmed IV led by important viziers including the Grand Mufti (Şeyhülislam) Hocazade Mesut Efendi. This plot was discovered, and the plotters were executed or exiled. The Mother Sultana Turhan Hatice conducted consultations and the most favored candidate for the post of Grand Vizier came out as the old and retired but experienced Köprülü Mehmed Pasha.

===Grand Vizier===
Köprülü was called to Istanbul, where he accepted the position of Grand Vizier on 14 September 1656. He spoke to Valide Sultan on his appointment as Grand Vizier and told his terms and she accepted. He was given extraordinary powers and political rule without interference, even from the highest authority of the Sultan. Of course, he gave reports on governance to Turhan Sultan, and in many administrative matters she supported him. Thus, historians saw her and him as the mainstay of the Ottoman state.

In order to prevent the Valide Sultan or any other person from the harem from exercising power in their affairs, he proposed to confirm and declare the sultan&#x27;s adulthood. As the Grand Vizier, his first task was to advise Sultan Mehmed IV to conduct a life of hunts and traveling around the Balkans and to reside in the old capital of Edirne, thus stopping his direct political involvement in the management of the state. On 4 January 1657, the household cavalry Sipahi troops in Constantinople started a rebellion and this was cruelly suppressed by Köprülü Mehmed Pasha with the help of Janissary troops. The Greek Orthodox Patriarch of Constantinople was proven to be in treasonous contacts with the enemies of Ottoman state and Köprülü Mehmed Pasha approved of his execution.

The Sultan gave the Grand Vizier the absolute authority over the life and property of the Ottoman government and people and assured him that anyone who opposed him for any purpose could be executed for disobeying the order.

===War with Venice===
He started on a military expeditions against the Venetian blockade of Dardanelles Straits. The Ottoman navy had a victory against Venice in the Battle of the Dardanelles on 19 July 1657. This allowed Ottomans to regain some of the Aegean islands, including Bozcaada and Limni (15 November) and to open the sea-supply routes to the Ottoman Army still conducting the sieges of Crete.

===War with Transylvania and the Habsburgs===

In 1658 he conducted a successful campaign in Transylvania. He also annexed Yanova (Jenő) on 1 August 1660 and Várad on 27 August. By annexing more territory in Hungary, he intended to directly threaten the Austrian capital Vienna.

=== Revolt of Abaza Hasan Pasha ===
Köprülü Mehmed Pasha&#x27;s campaign against Transylvania was cut short by the large-scale revolt of several eastern provincial governors under the leadership of Abaza Hasan Pasha, then the governor of Aleppo. The rebels opposed Köprülü Mehmed&#x27;s violent purges of the military and demanded that he be killed. However, Sultan Mehmed IV remained steadfast in his support for Köprülü and dispatched an army against the rebels under the command of Murtaza Pasha, who was then guarding the Safavid frontier. Despite assembling a force of 30,000 men and defeating Murtaza Pasha in battle, the harsh winter and fading morale eventually forced the rebels to capitulate. Abaza Hasan&#x27;s revolt was finally brought to an end in February 1659 with the assassination of all the rebel commanders in Aleppo, despite promises that they would be spared.

===Ayazmakapi Fire===
In July 1660 there was a big fire in Istanbul (the Ayazmakapi Fire) causing great damage to persons and buildings, leading later to a food scarcity and plague. Köprülü Mehmed Pasha became personally involved in the reconstruction affairs. The honesty and integrity in conducting state affairs by Köprülü Mehmed Pasha is shown by an episode in this task. The burnt-out Jewish quarters from the Ayazmakapi Fire were decided to be compulsorily purchased by the state.

===Death and legacy===
Köprülü Mehmed&#x27;s victories in Transylvania would push the Ottoman border closer to Austria.

==Family==
While stationed in Köprü in Anatolia, he married Ayşe Hatun (Hanım), daughter of Yusuf Ağa, a notable originally from Kayacık, a village of Havza in Amasya. Yusuf Ağa was a &quot;voyvoda&quot; (tax-farmer) who built a bridge in Kadegra, that thus became Köprü, from which the family name of Mehmed (who was originally stationed there, and where he was &quot;sanjak-bey&quot;) was taken. Together they had a number of children, amongs them Köprülüzade Fazıl Ahmed Pasha, Köprülüzade Fazıl Mustafa Pasha (father of Köprülüzade Damat Numan Pasha and Köprülüzade Abdüllah Pasha) and at least two daughters, who married Abaza Siyavush Pasha and Kara Mustafa Pasha.

<text>De Grolsch Veste (; ), previously known as Arke Stadion (), is the stadium of football club FC Twente. It is located in Enschede, Netherlands, at the Business &amp; Science Park, near the University of Twente. The stadium has an all-seated capacity of 30,205 with a standard pitch heating system and has a promenade instead of fences around the stands. It hosted the final of the UEFA Women&#x27;s Euro 2017.

==History==
De Grolsch Veste replaced the old Diekman Stadion as FC Twente&#x27;s home ground on 22 March 1998. Plans had been afoot to expand and to renovate the old and now demolished Diekman Stadion. However, with a growing fan capacity and with arguments that the location of the Diekman stadium was not strategic enough, the idea was conceived to build a new arena for the FC Twente fans. The Diekman ground also faced problems with its seating plans as a result of previous FIFA regulations which imposed a necessity to construct a seating tribune behind each goal post.

The cost of the construction is estimated to have been around 33 million guilders and it took fourteen months to complete, with its foundation stone having been laid on 31 January 1997. Due to the tight budget available, the layout of the stadium was constructed in such a way that future expansions would be possible without the necessity to tear down entire stands.

The first match played at the stadium was a 3–0 victory by the home team against PSV on 10 May 1998 in an Eredivisie match. The first goal in the new stadium was scored in the 14th minute by FC Twente player Chris De Witte.

On 1 October 2006, the stadium was updated with two big flatscreen video-walls.

In May 2008, the Arke Stadion was renamed to De Grolsch Veste with beer brewery Grolsch as sponsor. The brewery is located in the club&#x27;s hometown Enschede. The name &quot;Veste&quot; (fortress) is a reference to Groenlo, a former fortified town that was often besieged and where Grolsch was first brewed.

On 5 September 2009, for the first time ever an international (friendly) match was played in the FC Twente stadium when the Netherlands beat Japan 3–0.

===Expansion===
In 2006, plans were unfolded to increase the stadium capacity to 24,000 seats. The expansion started in January 2008 and was completed in September 2008, just in time for the start of the 2008–2009 season.

FC Twente is aiming to start a new phase in the stadium expansion in the summer of 2011 which will result in a capacity of 32,000 seats.

As part of the combined Netherlands and Belgium bid to host the 2018 FIFA World Cup, the stadium was one of five stadiums in the Netherlands selected by the KNVB to host games. This would mean that the stadium capacity needed to be expanded to the minimum required seating of 44,000.

The city of Enschede announced on 11 September 2009 that it would officially be a candidate city and that it would fully support FC Twente&#x27;s ambition to expand the stadium capacity to the minimum required seating of 44,000. In December 2009, IAA Architecten released computer generated images of the proposed 44,000+ stadium with an arched 3rd tier, to complete the main stand.

===Roof collapse===

The Grolsch Veste was expanded during the summer of 2011. On 7 July, when working on the construction of the stand, the roof suddenly collapsed, killing two workers and injuring 14 people. The collapse was probably caused by too much weight on the unfinished roof. After an investigation of a month, the roof was taken away and work continued. FC Twente played the first few competition matches partly without a roof. The new stadium was officially opened on 29 October with a competition match against PSV Eindhoven (2-2). A year after the accident, a monument was unveiled.

<text>David Hunter Hubel (February 27, 1926 – September 22, 2013) was an American Canadian neurophysiologist noted for his studies of the structure and function of the visual cortex. He was co-recipient with Torsten Wiesel of the 1981 Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine (shared with Roger W. Sperry), for their discoveries concerning information processing in the visual system. For much of his career, Hubel worked as the Professor of Neurobiology at Johns Hopkins University and Harvard Medical School. In 1978, Hubel and Wiesel were awarded the Louisa Gross Horwitz Prize from Columbia University. In 1983, Hubel received the Golden Plate Award of the American Academy of Achievement.

== Early life and education ==
Hubel was born in Windsor, Ontario, Canada, to American parents in 1926. His grandfather emigrated as a child to the United States from the Bavarian town of Nördlingen. In 1929, his family moved to Montreal, where he spent his formative years. His father was a chemical engineer and Hubel developed a keen interest in science right from childhood, making many experiments in chemistry and electronics. From age six to eighteen, he attended Strathcona Academy in Outremont, Quebec, about which he said, &quot;[I owe] much to the excellent teachers there, especially to Julia Bradshaw, a dedicated, vivacious history teacher with a memorable Irish temper, who awakened me to the possibility of learning how to write readable English.&quot; He studied mathematics and physics at McGill University, and then completed medical school there in 1951 and followed that with three years of residency (a year of internship and two of residency in neurology) at the Montreal General Hospital.

== Career ==
In 1954, Hubel moved to the United States to work at Johns Hopkins School of Medicine as an assistant resident in Neurology. He was later drafted by the army and served at Walter Reed Army Institute of Research (WRAIR). There, he began recording from the primary visual cortex of sleeping and awake cats. At WRAIR, he invented the modern metal microelectrode out of Stoner-Mudge lacquer and tungsten, and the modern hydraulic microdrive, which he had to learn basic machinist skills to produce. In 1958, Hubel moved to Johns Hopkins and began his collaborations with Wiesel, and discovered orientation selectivity and columnar organization in the visual cortex. One year later, he joined the faculty of Harvard University. In 1981, Hubel became a founding member of the World Cultural Council. From 1988 to 1989 he was the president of the Society for Neuroscience. He was a member of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences, the United States National Academy of Sciences, and the American Philosophical Society.

==Research==
The Hubel and Wiesel experiments greatly expanded the scientific knowledge of sensory processing. The partnership lasted over twenty years and became known as one of the most prominent research pairings in science. In one experiment, done in 1959, they inserted a microelectrode into the primary visual cortex of an anesthetized cat. They then projected patterns of light and dark on a screen in front of the cat. They found that some neurons fired rapidly when presented with lines at one angle, while others responded best to another angle. Some of these neurons responded to light patterns and dark patterns differently. Hubel and Wiesel called these neurons simple cells.&quot;
Still other neurons, which they termed complex cells, detected edges regardless of where they were placed in the receptive field of the neuron and could preferentially detect motion in certain directions. These studies showed how the visual system constructs complex representations of visual information from simple stimulus features.

Hubel and Wiesel received the Nobel Prize for two major contributions: firstly, their work on the development of the visual system, which involved a description of ocular dominance columns in the 1960s and 1970s; and secondly, their work establishing a foundation for visual neurophysiology, describing how signals from the eye are processed by visual parcels in the neo-cortex to generate edge detectors, motion detectors, stereoscopic depth detectors, and color detectors, building blocks of the visual scene. By depriving kittens of using one eye, they showed that columns in the primary visual cortex receiving inputs from the other eye took over the areas that would normally receive input from the deprived eye. This has important implications for the understanding of deprivation amblyopia, a type of visual loss due to unilateral visual deprivation during the so-called critical period. These kittens also did not develop areas receiving input from both eyes, a feature needed for binocular vision. Hubel and Wiesel&#x27;s experiments showed that the ocular dominance develops irreversibly early in childhood development. These studies opened the door for the understanding and treatment of childhood cataracts and strabismus. They were also important in the study of cortical plasticity.

Furthermore, the understanding of sensory processing in animals served as inspiration for the SIFT descriptor (Lowe, 1999), which is a local feature used in computer vision for tasks such as object recognition and wide-baseline matching, etc. The SIFT descriptor is arguably the most widely used feature type for these tasks. Hubel was elected a Foreign Member of the Royal Society (ForMemRS) in 1982.

==Personal life==
Hubel married Ruth Izzard in 1953; she died February 17, 2013. The couple had three sons and four grandchildren. He died in Lincoln, Massachusetts, from kidney failure on September 22, 2013, at the age of 87.

<text>Deathprod is the musical pseudonym used by Norwegian artist Helge Sten for his ambient music project. He is married to Norwegian singer Susanna Wallumrød.

==Biography==
Sten began creating music under this name starting in 1991, culminating with a box set of most of his recorded work being released in 2004. Simply titled &quot;Deathprod&quot;, the collection contains three albums along with a bonus disc of previously unreleased, rare, and deleted tracks.

On recordings, Sten is usually credited with &quot;Audio Virus&quot;, a catchall term for &quot;homemade electronics, old tape echo machines, ring modulators, filters, theremins, samplers and lots of electronic stuff.&quot;

Sten also did the mixing of the album &quot;PB&quot; by the Norwegian artist Per Bergersen.

Sten is a member of Supersilent and works as a producer on many releases on the Norwegian label Rune Grammofon.
He has also produced Motorpsycho and has worked with Biosphere on an Arne Nordheim tribute album called &quot;Nordheim Transformed&quot;.

<doc id="832715" wikidata="Q7334916" url="?curid=832715" title="Ringlemere barrow">
<text>The Ringlemere barrow is an archaeological site near Sandwich in the English county of Kent most famous as being the find site of the Ringlemere gold cup.

Because the metal detectorist reported finding the gold cup, professional archaeologists from Canterbury Archaeological Trust were able to properly excavate the site. This work has revealed a previously unsuspected funerary complex of Early Bronze Age date (approximately 2300 BC) had stood at the site. It is thought that the cup was not a grave good, as it was found independent of any burial and away from the centre of the mound as part of the mound material context. It has been suggested by Canterbury Archaeological Trust, that the cup may have been a votive offering placed within the mound during its construction. However, the mound had suffered extensive disturbance due to the actions of burrowing animals and the cup may have been moved from its original position. No contemporary burials have been found at the site although later Iron Age ones have since been found along with a Saxon cemetery.

Excavation work has continued at the site, funded by English Heritage, the BBC, the British Museum and the Kent Archaeological Society. This work has indicated that the now ploughed-away barrow was as high as 5m and had a diameter of more than 40m. The flat-bottomed ditch that surrounded it was 5–6 m wide and 1.35 m deep. Considerable evidence of much earlier Neolithic activity has now been found on the site including by far the largest assemblage of grooved ware in the county. Current theories now focus on the site having been significant long before and after the barrow being built and that the ditch may have been that of an older henge or, more likely, hengiform monument.

<doc id="832725" wikidata="Q1625317" url="?curid=832725" title="Holy Cross dispute">
<text>The Holy Cross dispute occurred in 2001 and 2002 in the Ardoyne area of north Belfast, Northern Ireland. During the 30-year conflict known as the Troubles, Ardoyne had become segregated – Ulster Protestants and Irish Catholics lived in separate areas. This left Holy Cross, a Catholic primary school for girls, in the middle of a Protestant area. In June 2001during the last week of school before the summer breakProtestant loyalists began picketing the school, claiming that Catholics were regularly attacking their homes and denying them access to facilities. 

The picket resumed on 3 September, when the new school term began. For weeks, hundreds of loyalist protesters tried to stop the schoolchildren and their parents from walking to school through their area. Hundreds of riot police, backed up by British soldiers, escorted the children and parents through the protest each day. Some protesters shouted sectarian abuse and threw stones, bricks, fireworks, blast bombs and urine-filled balloons at the schoolchildren, their parents and the RUC. The &quot;scenes of frightened Catholic schoolgirls running a gauntlet of abuse from loyalist protesters as they walked to school captured world headlines&quot;. Death threats were made against the parents and school staff by the Red Hand Defenders, a loyalist paramilitary group. The protest was condemned by both Catholics and Protestants, including politicians. Some likened the protest to child abuse and compared the protesters to North American white supremacists in the 1950s. During this time, the protest sparked bouts of fierce rioting between Catholics and Protestants in Ardoyne, and loyalist attacks on police. On 23 November, the loyalists ended the protest after being promised tighter security for their area and a redevelopment scheme. The security forces remained outside the school for several months after.

In January 2002, a scuffle between a Protestant and a Catholic outside the school sparked a large-scale riot in the area and attacks on other schools in north Belfast. The picket was not resumed and the situation has been mostly quiet since then. The following year, the BBC aired a documentary-drama about the protests.

==Beginning==

Holy Cross is a girls-only Catholic primary school in the Ardoyne area of north Belfast. Ardoyne was one of the most deprived areas of Northern Ireland. Before the outbreak of the Troubles in the late 1960s, the area was &quot;mixed&quot;, with Catholics and Protestants living alongside each other. However, after violence broke out between the two communities, the area became segregated. The area to the south of Alliance Avenue became almost wholly populated by Catholics (who were mostly Irish nationalist and republican) while the area to the north (known as Glenbryn) became wholly populated by Protestants (who were mostly British unionist and loyalist). This left Holy Cross in the middle of a Protestant area and some of the schoolchildren had to walk through it to get to school. A wall (known as a &quot;peace line&quot;) was built to separate the two communities. During the Troubles, almost 20 people were killed near the peace line by loyalists, republicans and the British Army. 

In the mid-1990s, the Provisional Irish Republican Army (IRA) and the main loyalist paramilitary groupsthe Ulster Defence Association (UDA) and Ulster Volunteer Force (UVF)declared ceasefires. In 1998, the Good Friday Agreement was signed, which set up a government in which Irish nationalists/republicans and British unionists/loyalists were to share power. However, the political situation remained tense. So-called dissident republicans and dissident loyalists continued to wage small-scale violent campaigns.

In December 2000, Protestant taxi driver Trevor Kell was shot dead in Ardoyne. The IRA were suspected of involvement as forensic evidence linked the gun with an IRA shooting in 1997. This would make it the first sectarian killing for almost two years. The next day, loyalists retaliated by shooting dead Catholic man Gary Moore as he was renovating a house in Newtownabbey. Later, the IRA was blamed for the &quot;punishment shooting&quot; of two men, one of whom is believed to have been questioned over Kell&#x27;s death.

The protesters claimed their homes were being regularly attacked by Catholics and that they were being denied access to facilities in the Catholic area, such as shops and playgrounds. Catholics claimed that their homes were also regularly attacked. The Protestant population of Glenbryn had dropped significantly since the ceasefires and some Protestants believed they were being driven out. Other protesters alleged that IRA members were using the children&#x27;s journey to-and-from school to gather intelligence. Anne Bill, a community worker who was centrally involved in the protest, said &quot;Protestants felt they weren&#x27;t getting a fair deal under the Good Friday Agreement. People in Glenbryn kept telling the Government about attacks on their houses and how vulnerable they felt but we weren&#x27;t being listened to. That is why people protested on the Ardoyne Road, the focus wasn&#x27;t so much the school itself [...] The community in Glenbryn is in decline and it is fearful of Ardoyne. That does encourage a siege mentality&quot;. 

Tension built and youths from both communities raised more and more flags along Ardoyne Road. On 19 June, a fight broke out between men putting up loyalist paramilitary flags and the occupants of a passing car. Loyalists allege that the car from republican Ardoyne estate rammed the ladder and knocked the two men off. How the episode started remains disputed. In the summer of 2001, the RUC received intelligence that UDA members were planning to &quot;exploit community tensions&quot; to kill Irish nationalists, Catholics and/or police officers.

==Summer 2001==

On Tuesday 19 June, Royal Ulster Constabulary (RUC) officers had to protect children and parents entering the school after they were attacked by loyalist stone throwers. Police described the attack as &quot;vicious&quot;. Following the incident, a blockade of the school developed, with loyalists standing across the road and RUC officers keeping the children and their parents away.

The following day, the school was forced to close when loyalists blocked the entrance. During the evening, hundreds of loyalists and nationalists (up to 600) clashed with each other and with the police. Shots were also fired at the police and over 100 petrol bombs were thrown. During the riots the police fired a number of the new &#x27;L21 A1&#x27; plastic baton rounds for the first time. 39 RUC officers were injured. Nine shots in total were fired – six from loyalists and three from republicans. The trouble came after an explosion at the rear of Catholic homes next to a peace line. Both loyalist and nationalist politicians blamed each other for the violence. This would be the first of many large riots to take place in Belfast within more than a year.

The morning blockade continued on Thursday 21 June. About 60 of the school&#x27;s 230 pupils entered the school through the grounds of another school. Senior Sinn Féin member Gerry Kelly said: &quot;It&#x27;s like something out of Alabama in the 1960s&quot;. Three Protestant families left their homes in Ardoyne Avenue, saying they were afraid of a nationalist attack. During the evening and night there were serious disturbances in the area around the school. Loyalists fired ten shots, and threw six blast bombs and 46 petrol bombs at police lines. Two Catholic homes were attacked with pipe bombs, and a child was thrown against a wall by one of the blasts. 24 RUC officers were hurt.

On Friday 22 June, a number of schoolchildren again had to enter the school through the grounds of another school. This was the last day of school before the summer break.

Talks between the protesters and the schoolchildren&#x27;s parents took place over the summer, but no agreement was reached. On 20 August, a &#x27;paint bomb&#x27; was thrown at the home of a Protestant man in Hesketh Park, smashing a window and causing paint damage to furniture. The man had taken part in the loyalist protest.

==Autumn 2001==
The protest resumed on Monday 3 September, the first day of the Autumn school term. The RUC, supported by the British Army, were by then better prepared and managed to force a path through the protesters. Loyalists jeered and shouted sectarian abuse as the children, some as young as four, were escorted into the school by their parents and the police. Stones and bottles were thrown at the children and their parents; one woman was injured. A mother of one of the schoolgirls said: &quot;It was absolutely terrifying. They were shouting &#x27;dirty tramps&#x27;, &#x27;your kids are animals&#x27;, &#x27;Fenian scum&#x27;, &#x27;you Fenian bastards&#x27;. And all we were trying to do was get our kids to school&quot;. Unionist politicians claimed a &quot;heavy-handed&quot; police presence had inflamed the situation, while the Progressive Unionist Party&#x27;s Billy Hutchinson alleged that five known IRA men had been allowed to walk with the children through the Protestant area.

Later in the day the Red Hand Defenders (RHD), an illegal loyalist paramilitary group, warned parents and children to stay away from the Ardoyne Road. A threat was also issued against police officers. During the evening there was violence near the school as youths from both sides attacked each other and the security forces. Three Catholic-owned homes on Newington Avenue were badly damaged in a loyalist pipe bomb attack. The blast caused an oil tank to catch fire and the flames spread to three houses, one of which was completely destroyed. Another pipe bomb exploded in the garden of a house in the White City area. There was also violence on North Queen Street and Limestone Road.

The following is a timeline of the major events during the Autumn protest.
;Week one
*Tuesday 4 September: Loyalist protesters tried to block access to the school, but riot police forced a path through the protesters and lined the road with armoured vehicles, creating a cordon for the children and parents to walk through. Loyalists attacked riot police with a blast bomb (an improvised grenade), injuring one officer. As the children and parents made their way through the cordon, loyalist protesters shouted abuse and threw stones at them. Some of the children were forced to turn back. There was more rioting near the school during the evening and night. A crowd of loyalists attacked police with bricks, bottles, stones, fireworks, ballbearings and blast bombs. A volley of shots was also heard in the Glenbryn estate. Police figures stated that 41 police officers and two soldiers had been injured, fifteen blast bombs and 250 petrol bombs had been thrown, and four civilian cars had been damaged.
*Wednesday 5 September: As the parents and their children passed Glenbryn Parade, loyalists threw a blast bomb towards them. The device exploded, injuring four police officers and a police dog. Panic ensued. Children began screaming and &quot;weeping uncontrollably&quot; and one mother suffered a panic attack. All were taken to hospital. The Red Hand Defenders (RHD) said it was responsible for the attack. Afterward, Progressive Unionist Party (PUP) politician Billy Hutchinson said he was &quot;ashamed to be a loyalist today after seeing these people attack young Catholic girls&quot;. However, he says he continued to stand with the protesters each morning to show leadership. John Reid, the British Secretary of State for Northern Ireland, called the attack &quot;barbaric&quot; and called for the protest to end immediately.
*Thursday 6 September: The protest was peaceful but very noisy as protesters used air horns (klaxons), blew whistles, and banged metal bin lids as the children passed through the security cordon. Four parents in the &#x27;Right to Education&#x27; group were notified that death threats had been made against them by the RHD, who said they would be killed if they were seen taking their children to the school. John Reid, Secretary of State for Northern Ireland, cut short his holiday and returned to Northern Ireland because of the situation.
*Friday 7 September: Loyalists held a silent protest as children and parents passed through the security cordon. The silent protest was a mark of respect for Thomas McDonald (16), a Protestant killed in a hit-and-run incident after he had attacked a car with bricks and stones in another part of north Belfast on Tuesday. Catholic parents also held a minute&#x27;s silence before beginning their walk to the school. Inside the school grounds, prayers involving clergymen from both denominations were said.

;Week two
*Monday 10 September: The protesters were quiet as the children and their parents passed, but when the parents returned home the protesters used air horns (klaxons), blew whistles, and banged metal bin lids. Some of the protesters shouted &quot;Fenian scum&quot; at the parents. In London, Richard Haass, the United States Special Envoy for Northern Ireland, discussed the protest with John Reid. Senior Sinn Féin member Gerry Kelly introduced a private members&#x27; motion in the Northern Ireland Assembly, proposing that &quot;the Assembly supports the right to education of children attending the Holy Cross Primary School in north Belfast&quot;. Unionist members proposed an amendment to the motion to make it apply to all schools in the area. The Assembly passed the amended motion.
*Tuesday 11 September: The protest followed the pattern of yesterday. Father Aidan Troy, Chairman of the school&#x27;s Board of Governors, together with a local Protestant clergyman, held a meeting with representatives of the Concerned Residents of Upper Ardoyne (CRUA) who were organising the protest. John Reid also held a meeting with the representatives. Fr Troy said of the protest: &quot;I really found it hard to comprehend the hatred that was shown to the school girls ... I walked with them and because of that I was spat on by the protesters. They held up posters accusing me of being a paedophile and they showed the children pornographic images. The intensity of the protest was hard to comprehend; I don&#x27;t think people can really understand that from watching it on television&quot;.
*Wednesday 12 September: The protest followed the pattern of Monday and Tuesday. However, before going to the school the children and parents held a prayer service and a minute&#x27;s silence for the victims of the September 11 attacks. On Friday, the protesters halted their protest for one day as a mark of respect for the victims of the attacks.

;Week three
*Thursday 20 September: Protesters reverted to the earlier tactic of making a lot of noise as the children passed. Six men appeared before Belfast Magistrates Court on public order offences related to the school protest. The six men were remanded on bail but told not to take part in the protest. As a result of the arrests, the group representing the protesters, CRUA, announced that it had &quot;suspended all business until further notice&quot;.

;Week four
*Wednesday 26 September: Protesters threw fireworks at children and parents returning from the school during the afternoon. That evening, a loyalist protest which blocked the nearby Crumlin Road turned into a riot. Police said they moved to protect Catholic homes from loyalists and were attacked by gunfire, pipe bombs and petrol bombs. They responded with plastic bullets, and 33 officers were injured. There was further violence in the area the following night, and police came under fire from loyalists on Cambrai Street. Thirteen officers were injured in the violence and a woman was shot in the leg.

;Week five
*Monday 1 October: Protesters continued their noisy protest as children and parents entered and left the school. Some protesters threw urine-filled balloons at the children and parents. Cups of cold tea and water were also thrown by protesters. Reg Empey (Ulster Unionist Party), then Acting First Minister of Northern Ireland, and Seamus Mallon (Social Democratic and Labour Party), then Acting Deputy First Minister, met with local representatives to discuss the situation. Empy said there was no excuse for the ongoing protest.
*Tuesday 2 October: British Conservative MP Quentin Davies, then Shadow Secretary of State for Northern Ireland, accompanied parents and children as they returned home through the protest. Davies called the protest &quot;utterly unacceptable&quot;.

;Week six
*Tuesday 9 October: Aidan Troy, chairman of the school&#x27;s Board of Governors, said he was considering taking legal action to try to end the protest. He said: &quot;The weeks of suffering for these small girls were never justified ... This is no longer a legitimate protest; it is a form of child abuse&quot;. The cost of policing the protest was reported as having reached £1 million.
*Wednesday 10 October: Many of the protesters had begun to hide their identity and some were wearing masks of characters from horror movies. Local doctor Michael Tan said that some of the schoolchildren&#x27;s families were near &quot;breaking point&quot; and parents and children were in need of professional psychological care. Brice Dickson, head of the Northern Ireland Human Rights Commission, visited the scene of the protest. He spoke to some of the protesters but was criticised by some of the parents of the children for not walking the route with them as Quentin Davies had done. One of the protesters displayed a threatening letter allegedly sent by a group called the &quot;Catholic Reaction Force&quot;. Meanwhile, it was announced that the security wall between the loyalist and nationalist areas would be extended.

;Week seven
*Monday 15 October: Brice Dickson again visited the protest and called for it to end. He said &quot;The treatment of these children is inhumane and their right to effective education is being affected&quot;. Protestant parents in north and west Belfast said that there had been rising attacks on buses carrying Protestant schoolchildren.
*Wednesday 17 October: As children and parents were returning home from the school, a loyalist bomb exploded at the back of a house on Alliance Avenue. No one was injured but the householder, and a number of parents and children, were described as being &quot;in shock&quot;.

;Week eight
*Wednesday 24 October: There were disturbances on the Crumlin Road, not far from the school. Loyalists blocked the main road at about 4:30, stopping Catholic schoolchildren from getting home. Catholic families arrived to try to escort their children home. Bricks and bottles were thrown by both groups and police moved in to keep the sides apart. The Crumlin Road is the &#x27;alternative&#x27; route that loyalists want the Holy Cross children and their parents to use when going to and from the school.
*Friday 26 October: Two people were arrested during the protest outside the school. Loyalists had tried to block the road and stop children parents from getting to the school. That night, loyalists threw a pipe bomb at a group of soldiers and police on the road, badly wounding a soldier and injuring several officers. The school was closed the following week after Halloween.

;Week nine
*Monday 5 November: Protesters said they had reached an &quot;understanding&quot; with the Police Service of Northern Ireland (the former RUC, now renamed) over the weekend. As a result, the police were not wearing full riot gear when the protest took place.
*Wednesday 7 November: The mother of a child attending the school began legal proceedings against John Reid and the police. The mother said that police had not given enough protection to her daughter and had failed to identify, arrest, or prosecute protesters who broke the law in full public view. While on a visit to Northern Ireland, Archbishop Desmond Tutu met some of the schoolchildren and their parents. Tutu also met some of those involved in the protest.
*Friday 9 November: The protest was halted for one day. Some of the schoolchildren sat their &quot;11-plus&quot; exams. Mary McAleese, then President of Ireland, called for an end to the protest.

;Week ten
*Monday 12 November: There was a change in the policing tactics used at the protest. Instead of gathering together all the Catholic parents and children and escorting them to the school as a group, the police specified a time period in which parents could walk to the school. About 400 police officers (an eighth of the total in Belfast) were there to ensure that the children could get to school. The day&#x27;s operation cost an estimated £100,000. Some Catholic parents complained that the new police tactics left them more exposed to the protesters. Police arrested a nationalist who was taking a video of the protesters.

;Week eleven
*Monday 19 November: The media reported that the father of one of the schoolgirls had begun a hunger strike. The man said that he felt so frustrated by the protest that he was refusing food in an attempt to end the blockade. It was also revealed that a split had occurred in CRUA, the protest group. It was reported that as many as five of its committee members may have resigned. They are believed to include spokesmen Stuart McCartney and Jim Potts.
*Tuesday 20 November: The Belfast Education and Library Board (BELB) provided two buses for those schoolchildren and parents who wished to use them to get through the protest. However, most of them made their way to the school on foot.
*Thursday 22 November: David Trimble (UUP), then First Minister, and Mark Durkan (SDLP), then Deputy First Minister, held a meeting with the protest group. Before calling an end to the protest the protesters asked for CCTV to be introduced, along with road-calming measures, and tighter security in the area.
*Friday 23 November: In the afternoon there was a rally in the middle of Belfast in support of the schoolchildren. About 500 people attended. In the evening the protest group held a meeting and announced that the protest would be &quot;suspended&quot;.

For months after the protest ended, police and British Army armoured vehicles sat outside the school and at the junction of Alliance Avenue each day. However, eventually parents were able to walk their children to school without a police and Army escort.

== January 2002 ==
On Wednesday 9 January 2002, there were confrontations outside the school during the early afternoon. Disturbances and rioting quickly spread throughout Ardoyne during the evening and into the night. Catholic parents and Protestant residents each claimed that the other side had started the trouble. Catholic parents said that they had faced increased verbal abuse since Monday during their walks to and from school and that they were attacked while leaving the school on Wednesday afternoon. A Catholic mother claimed she was punched in the face as she walked home from the school with her child. Police officers said they arrived at a confrontation between a Protestant woman and a Catholic woman near the school. The police moved to make an arrest but the person was protected by other residents. Police officers said they had to draw their weapons. There was a report that loyalists had driven a car at the school gates in an attempt to break in. Some schoolchildren had to be taken home through the grounds of another school while a bus carrying other children was attacked on its way down Ardoyne Road. Protestant residents claimed the trouble started when Catholics removed a wreath from a lamp-post.

Up to 500 loyalists and nationalists were involved in the disturbances on the Ardoyne Road, Crumlin Road and Brompton Park areas. About 130 petrol bombs, acid bombs and fireworks were thrown. Four Catholic youths were hospitalised after being hit by shotgun pellets at Hesketh Park; loyalists petrol-bombed and destroyed a police vehicle; Catholic homes were attacked on the Upper Crumlin Road; a Catholic woman was knocked-down by a car on Twaddell Avenue; a Catholic man was struck by a police vehicle, and a 13-year-old Protestant schoolboy was injured when a bus was attacked. The police fired eight plastic bullets and arrested three people. As the trouble worsened, 200 police officers, backed by 200 soldiers, were deployed. At least 14 police officers were injured.

The following day, the Holy Cross school was forced to close for the day. Some other schools in the area closed early due to fears about the safety of schoolchildren. In the morning, six loyalists, one with a gun, rampaged through the grounds of Our Lady of Mercy Catholic girls&#x27; secondary school, smashing 18 cars with crowbars. Parents rushed to collect their daughters. In the afternoon, Protestant pupils from Boys&#x27; Model Secondary School were ferried home in police armoured Land Rovers past nationalist crowds on Crumlin Road. Catholic parents and Protestant residents held separate meetings to discuss the situation.

On Friday 11 January, the Red Hand Defenders issued a death threat against all Catholic teachers and all other staff working at Catholic schools in north Belfast. That weekend, two Catholic schools were set on fire and teachers&#x27; cars were attacked. On Monday, more than 750 armed police officers and soldiers were sent to guard Catholic schools in north Belfast while armoured vehicles lined Ardoyne Road. There was no protest outside the school and there was no serious violence, although there were a few minor scuffles. The Northern Ireland Office announced that permanent CCTV cameras would be installed on the Ardoyne Road. A temporary system was to be put in place while waiting for the permanent installation.

In February 2002, Holy Cross schoolchildren travelled to County Galway for a free holiday as guests of Peacock&#x27;s Hotel. The owners of the hotel had made the offer of the holiday following the 2001 protests. Twenty of the schoolchildren also met Bertie Ahern, then Taoiseach, during a short visit to Dublin. Ahern said it would show support for the children from the people of the Republic.

In June, James Adairbrother of UDA leader Johnny Adairwas jailed for six months for riotous behaviour and given a concurrent sentence of four months for obstructing police during the riots.

==Aftermath==
The Holy Cross protest was said to have heightened sectarian tensions in Northern Ireland in a way not seen since the Drumcree dispute in the mid-1990s. PUP politician Billy Hutchinson said &quot;The protest was a disaster in terms of putting their cause forward but it was a genuine expression of their anger and frustration and fear over what is happening in that part of North Belfast&quot;.

A month before the protest was ended the Department of Social Development announced a housing redevelopment package for Glenbryn. This angered some Catholics and nationalists, particularly in north Belfast, where almost 80% of those on the housing waiting list were Catholics. They saw the package as a &quot;buy-off&quot; for Glenbryn residents. Ardoyne Sinn Féin councillor Margaret McClenaghan says the common perception was that loyalists were being rewarded for intimidating schoolgirls. However, one Protestant community activist said &quot;There is no victory for our area despite all the hype. It is actually a strategy of social political engineering between the NlO and the Housing Executive, to solve the issue of interface tension&quot;. He explained that 186 houses would be demolished and that only about 20% would be replaced. This, he said, would mean a shrinking of the Protestant population in Glenbryn.

During the protest, a number of schoolchildren were moved to other schools. Applications for enrolment at Holy Cross had dropped by almost half.

Since the end of the protest, steps have been taken to heal relations. The North Belfast Community Action Unit was set up to foster inter-community talks, focusing on social and economic issues of interest to Ardoyne and Glenbryn. Nevertheless, community workers from both sides admit progress has been slow.

In December 2024 papers declassified under the thirty-year rule revealed that the government of the Republic of Ireland had offered him the use of a flat leased by the Department of Foreign Affairs in Belfast after he received death threats. He declined the offer as he didn&#x27;t want to leave Ardoyne and feared that drawing publicity to the threats would have an adverse effect on the children.
===Effect on the schoolchildren===
Brendan Bradley, head of the Survivors of Trauma group (which deals with victims of Troubles-related violence), said that the trauma experienced by the children was &quot;almost without parallel&quot; in the history of the Troubles:It wasn&#x27;t as though this abuse lasted for a couple of days or was a one-off; it went on for months. Many needed counselling, some long-term counselling, in the wake of it all. Parents told how their daughters had changed from being fun-loving to being very withdrawn.

Fr Aidan Troy said that some of the schoolgirls had been &quot;put on heavy tranquillizers such as diazepam ... because of the trauma they were experiencing&quot;. Parents spoke of how their children had been wetting the bed and had started to throw tantrums and become withdrawn. When Holy Cross teachers asked girls in Primary 6 (aged 9–10) to draw a picture many had drawn mothers and fathers crying, surrounded by people with angry faces.

==Later incidents==

In 2003, Loyalists placed a pipe bomb at the entrance of the school, it was defused and there were no injuries.

In 2003, a BBC televised drama called &quot;Holy Cross&quot; was made about the dispute, though it was filmed in Liverpool. Fr Aidan Troy, head of the board of governors of the school, expressed concern that the drama could reignite the problem. The film was produced by BBC Northern Ireland in association with RTÉ. Although based on the events which occurred, it was somewhat fictionalised, and told through the eyes of two families on opposite sides of the divide. The film stars Zara Turner and Bronagh Gallagher, and broadcast on RTÉ One on 8 November 2003, and on BBC One on 10 November 2003.

In April 2013, loyalists erected Union Jacks and loyalist flags outside the school and painted the kerbstones at its entrance red, white and blue. On 25 April the Police Service of Northern Ireland (PSNI) were called to the school to disperse a loyalist protest being held outside it. The protest was sparked by false rumours on social networks that Belfast City Council employees were due to arrive to remove the flags and the paint.

In the early hours of Sunday 23 April 2017, a bomb was found by a police patrol outside the gates of Holy Cross Boys&#x27; Primary School in Ardoyne. The police said the bomb was &quot;significant in terms of its [undisclosed] shape&quot;, and that police on foot patrol were the likely target. A sense of outrage was reported in the area.

<text>Jeremy John Le Mesurier Wolfenden (26 June 1934, England – 28 December 1965) was a foreign correspondent and British spy at the height of the Cold War.

==Biography==
The son of John Wolfenden, headmaster of Uppingham School, and, later, chairman of the Wolfenden Report which recommended the legalisation of male homosexual acts in Britain, Jeremy Wolfenden was himself homosexual. He was regarded by others of his generation as a leader and a man of distinct individualism. He won a scholarship to Eton where he was known as &#x27;cleverest boy in England&#x27;, then to his father&#x27;s alma mater Magdalen College, Oxford, where he obtained a first-class degree in Philosophy, Politics and Economics. He subsequently became a Prize Fellow of All Souls. His Finals examiner at Oxford, after giving him eight alphas, wrote: &quot;He wrote as though it were all beneath him; he wrote as though it were all such a waste of his time.&quot;

He became night news editor of &quot;The Times&quot; in 1959 and the newspaper&#x27;s Paris correspondent the following year. Wolfenden was recruited by the Secret Intelligence Service (SIS) before becoming &quot;The Daily Telegraph&quot;″s foreign correspondent in Moscow (in 1961) where he indulged in his twin passions for sex and alcohol and was eventually compromised by the KGB. He struck up friendships with Guy Burgess, the British defector, and Martina Browne, the nanny employed by Ruari and Janet Chisholm, who were working for SIS and were instrumental in the defection of Oleg Penkovsky – a colonel in Soviet military intelligence – who was responsible for disabusing the Kennedy administration of the myth that the &quot;missile gap&quot; was in the Soviet&#x27;s favour. Wolfenden subsequently came under pressure from both the Secret Intelligence Service (MI6) and the KGB while in Moscow. According to Neal Ascherson in 1996, he was being blackmailed by both services. He had been photographed by the KGB having sex with another man, while MI6 tried to turn him into a double agent. In 1964, he swapped roles with the &quot;Telegraph&quot;″s Washington, D.C. correspondent, where he married Martina Browne.

He died on 28 December 1965, aged 31, in what appeared to be suspicious circumstances in Washington, D.C. It was claimed he had fainted in the bathroom, cracked his head against the washbasin and died of a cerebral haemorrhage. It is now thought likely that he died of liver failure brought on by his excessive drinking.

Wolfenden&#x27;s own views survive. For instance, in a letter to Michael Parsons, an Oxford friend, from Paris, January 1961:
&quot;There is just no such thing as anyone’s real personality. Personalities are the product of the initial feelings or attitudes someone takes up and the needs of the situation they find themselves in...and, for that matter, the initial feelings themselves are the product of earlier conflicts of that sort. There is a dialectic of personality, just as there is dialectic of history (and it’s just as unpredictable).&quot;

A short biography of Wolfenden appears in the book &quot;The Fatal Englishman&quot; by Sebastian Faulks. Julian Mitchell&#x27;s play &quot;Consenting Adults&quot; (2007), screened by BBC Four, is based on the relationship of father and son, played by Charles Dance and Sean Biggerstaff respectively. Biggerstaff won a BAFTA Scotland award for Best Television Actor for his performance.

<text>Space Exploration Technologies Corp., commonly referred to as SpaceX, is an American space technology company headquartered at the Starbase development site near Brownsville, Texas. Since its founding in 2002, the company has made numerous advancements in rocket propulsion, reusable launch vehicles, human spaceflight and satellite constellation technology. , SpaceX is the world&#x27;s dominant space launch provider, its launch cadence eclipsing all others, including private competitors and national programs like the Chinese space program. SpaceX, NASA, and the United States Armed Forces work closely together by means of governmental contracts.

SpaceX was founded by Elon Musk in 2002 with a vision of decreasing the costs of space launches, paving the way to a sustainable colony on Mars. In 2008, when SpaceX was almost bankrupt, Falcon 1 successfully launched into orbit after three failed launch attempts. The company then pivoted towards the development of the larger Falcon 9 rocket and the Dragon 1 capsule to satisfy NASA&#x27;s COTS contracts for deliveries to the International Space Station. By 2012, SpaceX finished all COTS test flights and began delivering Commercial Resupply Services missions to the International Space Station. Also around that time, SpaceX started developing hardware to make the Falcon 9 first stage reusable. The company demonstrated the first successful first-stage landing in 2015 and re-launch of the first stage in 2017. Falcon Heavy, built from three Falcon 9 boosters, first flew in 2018 after a more than decade-long development process. As of October 2024, the company&#x27;s Falcon 9 rockets have landed and flown again more than 330 times, reaching 1–2 launches a week.

These milestones delivered the company much-needed investment and SpaceX sought to diversify its sources of income. In 2019, the first operational satellite of the Starlink internet satellite constellation came online. In subsequent years, Starlink generated the bulk of SpaceX&#x27;s income and paved the way for its Starshield military counterpart. In 2020, SpaceX began to operate its Dragon 2 capsules to deliver crewed missions for NASA and private entities. Around this time, SpaceX began building test prototypes for Starship, which is the largest launch vehicle in history and aims to fully realize the company&#x27;s vision of a fully-reusable, cost-effective and adaptable launch vehicle. SpaceX is also developing its own space suit and astronaut via its Polaris program as well as developing the human lander for lunar missions under NASA&#x27;s Artemis program. SpaceX is not publicly traded; a space industry newspaper estimated that SpaceX has a revenue of over in 2024.

== History ==

=== 2001–2004: Founding ===
In early 2001, Elon Musk met Robert Zubrin and donated to his Mars Society, joining its board of directors for a short time. He gave a plenary talk at their fourth convention where he announced &quot;Mars Oasis&quot;, a project to land a greenhouse and grow plants on Mars. Musk initially attempted to acquire a Dnepr launch vehicle for the project through Russian contacts from Jim Cantrell.

Musk returned with his team to Moscow, this time bringing Michael Griffin, who later became the 11th Administrator of NASA, but found the Russians increasingly unreceptive. On the flight home, Musk announced he could start a company to build the affordable rockets they needed instead. By applying vertical integration, using inexpensive commercial off-the-shelf components when possible, and adopting the modular approach of modern software engineering, Musk believed SpaceX could significantly cut launch costs.

In early 2002, Elon Musk started to look for staff for his company, soon to be named SpaceX. Musk approached five people for the initial positions at the fledgling company, including Griffin, who declined the position of Chief Engineer, Jim Cantrell and John Garvey (Cantrell and Garvey would later found the company Vector Launch), rocket engineer Tom Mueller, and Chris Thompson. SpaceX was first headquartered in a warehouse in El Segundo, California. Early SpaceX employees, such as Tom Mueller (CTO), Gwynne Shotwell (COO), and Chris Thompson (VP of Operations), came from neighboring TRW and Boeing corporations. By November 2005, the company had 160 employees. Musk personally interviewed and approved all of SpaceX&#x27;s early employees.

Musk has stated that one of his goals with SpaceX is to decrease the cost and improve the reliability of access to space, ultimately by a factor of ten.

=== 2005–2009: Falcon 1 and first orbital launches ===

SpaceX developed its first orbital launch vehicle, the Falcon 1, with internal funding. The Falcon 1 was an expendable two-stage-to-orbit small-lift launch vehicle. The total development cost of Falcon 1 was approximately to .

The Falcon rocket series was named after &quot;Star Wars&quot;″s &quot;Millennium Falcon&quot; fictional spacecraft.

In 2004, SpaceX protested against NASA to the Government Accountability Office (GAO) because of a sole-source contract awarded to Kistler Aerospace. Before the GAO could respond, NASA withdrew the contract, and formed the COTS program. In 2005, SpaceX announced plans to pursue a human-rated commercial space program through the end of the decade, a program that would later become the Dragon spacecraft. In 2006, the company was selected by NASA and awarded to provide crew and cargo resupply demonstration contracts to the International Space Station (ISS) under the COTS program.

The first two Falcon 1 launches were purchased by the United States Department of Defense under the DARPA Falcon Project which evaluated new U.S. launch vehicles suitable for use in hypersonic missile delivery for Prompt Global Strike. The first three launches of the rocket, between 2006 and 2008, all resulted in failures, which almost ended the company. Financing for Tesla Motors had failed, as well, and consequently Tesla, SolarCity, and Musk personally were all nearly bankrupt at the same time. Musk was reportedly &quot;waking from nightmares, screaming and in physical pain&quot; because of the stress.

The financial situation started to turn around with the first successful launch achieved on the fourth attempt on 28 September 2008. Musk split his remaining between SpaceX and Tesla, and NASA awarded the first Commercial Resupply Services (CRS) contract awarding to SpaceX in December, thus financially saving the company. Based on these factors and the further business operations they enabled, the Falcon 1 was soon retired following its second successful, and fifth total, launch in July 2009. This allowed SpaceX to focus company resources on the development of a larger orbital rocket, the Falcon 9. Gwynne Shotwell was also promoted to company president at the time, for her role in successfully negotiating the CRS contract with the NASA Associate Administrator Bill Gerstenmaier.

=== 2010–2012: Falcon 9, Dragon, and NASA contracts ===
SpaceX originally intended to follow its light Falcon 1 launch vehicle with an intermediate capacity vehicle, the Falcon 5. The company instead decided in 2005 to proceed with the development of the Falcon 9, a reusable heavier lift vehicle. Development of the Falcon 9 was accelerated by NASA, which committed to purchasing several commercial flights if specific capabilities were demonstrated. This started with seed money from the Commercial Orbital Transportation Services (COTS) program in 2006. The overall contract award was to provide development funding for the Dragon spacecraft, Falcon 9, and demonstration launches of Falcon 9 with Dragon. As part of this contract, the Falcon 9 launched for the first time in June 2010 with the Dragon Spacecraft Qualification Unit, using a mockup of the Dragon spacecraft.

The first operational Dragon spacecraft was launched in December 2010 aboard COTS Demo Flight 1, the Falcon 9&#x27;s second flight, and safely returned to Earth after two orbits, completing all its mission objectives. By December 2010, the SpaceX production line was manufacturing one Falcon 9 and Dragon every three months.

In April 2011, as part of its second-round Commercial Crew Development (CCDev) program, NASA issued a contract for SpaceX to develop an integrated launch escape system for Dragon in preparation for human-rating it as a crew transport vehicle to the ISS. NASA awarded SpaceX a fixed-price Space Act Agreement (SAA) to produce a detailed design of the crew transportation system in August 2012.

In early 2012, approximately two-thirds of SpaceX stock was owned by Musk and his seventy million shares were then estimated to be worth on private markets, valuing SpaceX at . In May 2012, with the Dragon C2+ launch, Dragon became the first commercial spacecraft to deliver cargo to the International Space Station. After the flight, the company private equity valuation nearly doubled to or /share. By that time, SpaceX had operated on total funding of approximately over its first decade of operation. Of this, private equity provided approximately , with Musk investing approximately and other investors having put in about .

SpaceX&#x27;s active reusability test program began in late 2012 with testing low-altitude, low-speed aspects of the landing technology. The Falcon 9 prototypes performed vertical takeoffs and landings (VTOL). High-velocity, high-altitude tests of the booster atmospheric return technology began in late 2013.

=== 2013–2015: Commercial launches and rapid growth ===
SpaceX launched the first commercial mission for a private customer in 2013. In 2014, SpaceX won nine contracts out of the 20 that were openly competed worldwide. That year Arianespace requested that European governments provide additional subsidies to face the competition from SpaceX. Beginning in 2014, SpaceX capabilities and pricing also began to affect the market for launch of U.S. military payloads, which for nearly a decade had been dominated by the large U.S. launch provider United Launch Alliance (ULA). The monopoly had allowed launch costs by the U.S. provider to rise to over over the years. In September 2014, NASA&#x27;s Director of Commercial Spaceflight, Kevin Crigler, awarded SpaceX the Commercial Crew Transportation Capability (CCtCap) contract to finalize the development of the Crew Transportation System. The contract included several technical and certification milestones, an uncrewed flight test, a crewed flight test, and six operational missions after certification.

In January 2015, SpaceX raised in funding from Google and Fidelity Investments, in exchange for 8.33% of the company, establishing the company valuation at approximately . The same month SpaceX announced the development of a new satellite constellation, called Starlink, to provide global broadband internet service with 4,000 satellites.

The Falcon 9 had its first major failure in late June 2015, when the seventh ISS resupply mission, CRS-7 exploded two minutes into the flight. The problem was traced to a failed two-foot-long steel strut that held a helium pressure vessel, which broke free due to the force of acceleration. This caused a breach and allowed high-pressure helium to escape into the low-pressure propellant tank, causing the failure.

=== 2015–2017: Reusability milestones ===
SpaceX first achieved a successful landing and recovery of a first stage in December 2015 with Falcon 9 Flight 20. In April 2016, the company achieved the first successful landing on the autonomous spaceport drone ship (ASDS) &quot;Of Course I Still Love You&quot; in the Atlantic Ocean. By October 2016, following the successful landings, SpaceX indicated they were offering their customers a 10% price discount if they choose to fly their payload on a reused Falcon 9 first stage.

A second major rocket failure happened in early September 2016, when a Falcon 9 exploded during a propellant fill operation for a standard pre-launch static fire test. The payload, the AMOS-6 communications satellite valued at , was destroyed. The explosion was caused by the liquid oxygen that is used as propellant turning so cold that it solidified and ignited with carbon composite helium vessels. Though not considered an unsuccessful flight, the rocket explosion sent the company into a four-month launch hiatus while it worked out what went wrong. SpaceX returned to flight in January 2017.

In March 2017, SpaceX launched a returned Falcon 9 for the SES-10 satellite. This was the first time a re-launch of a payload-carrying orbital rocket went back to space. The first stage was recovered again, also making it the first landing of a reused orbital class rocket.

=== 2017–2018: Leading global commercial launch provider ===
In July 2017, the company raised , which raised its valuation to . In 2017, SpaceX achieved a 45% global market share for awarded commercial launch contracts. By March 2018, SpaceX had more than 100 launches on its manifest representing about in contract revenue. The contracts included both commercial and government (NASA/DOD) customers. This made SpaceX the leading global commercial launch provider measured by manifested launches.

In 2017, SpaceX formed a subsidiary, The Boring Company, and began work to construct a short test tunnel on and adjacent to the SpaceX headquarters and manufacturing facility, using a small number of SpaceX employees, which was completed in May 2018, and opened to the public in December 2018. During 2018, The Boring Company was spun out into a separate corporate entity with 6% of the equity going to SpaceX, less than 10% to early employees, and the remainder of the equity to Elon Musk.

=== Since 2019: Starship, first crewed launches, Starlink and general ===

In 2019 SpaceX raised of capital across three funding rounds. By May 2019, the valuation of SpaceX had risen to and reached by March 2020.

On 19 August 2020, after a funding round, one of the largest single fundraising pushes by any privately held company, SpaceX&#x27;s valuation increased to .

In February 2021, SpaceX raised an additional in an equity round from 99 investors at a per share value of approximately , raising the company valuation to approximately . By 2021, SpaceX had raised more than in equity financing. Most of the capital raised since 2019 has been used to support the operational fielding of the Starlink satellite constellation and the development and manufacture of the Starship launch vehicle. By October 2021, the valuation of SpaceX had risen to . On 16 April 2021, Starship HLS won a contract to play a critical role in the NASA crewed spaceflight Artemis program. By 2021, SpaceX had entered into agreements with Google Cloud Platform and Microsoft Azure to provide on-ground computer and networking services for Starlink. A new round of financing in 2022 valued SpaceX at .

In July 2021, SpaceX unveiled another drone ship named &quot;A Shortfall of Gravitas&quot;, landing a booster from CRS-23 on it for the first time on 29 August 2021. Within the first 130 days of 2022, SpaceX had 18 rocket launches and two astronaut splashdowns. On 13 December 2021, company CEO Elon Musk announced that the company was starting a carbon dioxide removal program that would convert captured carbon into rocket fuel, after he announced a donation to the X Prize Foundation the previous February to provide the monetary rewards to winners in a contest to develop the best carbon capture technology.

In August 2022, Reuters reported that the European Space Agency (ESA) began initial discussions with SpaceX that could lead to the company&#x27;s launchers being used temporarily, given that Russia blocked access to Soyuz rockets amid the Russian invasion of Ukraine. Since that invasion and in the greater war between Russia and Ukraine, Starlink was extensively used.

In 2022, SpaceX&#x27;s Falcon 9 also became the world record holder for the most launches of a single vehicle type in a single year. SpaceX launched a rocket approximately every six days in 2022, with 61 launches in total. All but one (a Falcon Heavy in November) was on a Falcon 9 rocket.

In November 2023, SpaceX announced it would acquire its parachute supplier Pioneer Aerospace out of bankruptcy for .

==== 2024 headquarters move from California to Texas ====

On 16 July 2024, Elon Musk posted on X that SpaceX would move its headquarters from Hawthorne, California, to SpaceX Starbase in Brownsville, Texas. Musk said this was because the recently passed California AB1955 bill &quot;and the many others that preceded it, attacking both families and companies&quot;. This new law in California bans school districts from requiring that teachers notify parents about changes to a student&#x27;s sexual orientation and gender identity. The headquarters officially moved to Brownsville, Texas in August 2024, according to records filed with the California Secretary of State.

The move to relocate SpaceX&#x27;s headquarters was seen as largely symbolic, at least in the short term. The Hawthorne facility continues to support the company&#x27;s Falcon launch vehicles, which was SpaceX&#x27;s workhorse product in 2024.

SpaceX&#x27;s Polaris Dawn mission featured the first-ever private spacewalk, marking a major milestone in commercial space exploration.

==== Starship ====
In January 2019, SpaceX announced it would lay off 10% of its workforce to help finance the Starship and Starlink projects. The purpose of the Starship vehicle is to enable large-scale transit of humans and cargo to the Moon, Mars, and beyond. SpaceX&#x27;s Starship is the largest and most powerful rocket ever flown, with a payload capacity of 100+ tons. Construction of initial prototypes and tests for Starship started in early 2019 in Florida and Texas. All Starship construction and testing moved to the new SpaceX South Texas launch site later that year.

On 20 April 2023, Starship&#x27;s first orbital flight test ended in a mid-air explosion over the Gulf of Mexico before booster separation. After launch, multiple engines in the booster progressively failed, causing the vehicle to reach max &quot;q&quot; later than planned. &quot;Max q&quot; is the theoretical point of maximal mechanical stress which occurs during the launch sequence of a space vehicle. In the case of a rocket that must be self-destructed during its ascent, max q occurs at the point of self-destruction. Eventually, the vehicle lost control and spun erratically until the automated flight termination system was activated, which intentionally destroyed the rocket. Elon Musk, SpaceX, and other individuals familiar with the space industry have referred to the test flight as a success.

Musk said at the time that it would take &quot;six to eight weeks&quot; to get the infrastructure prepared for another launch. In October 2023, a senior SpaceX executive stated the company had been ready to launch the next test flight since September. He accused government regulators of disrupting the project&#x27;s progress, adding the delay could lead to China beating U.S. astronauts back to the Moon.

On 18 November 2023, SpaceX launched Starship on its second flight test, with both vehicles flying for a few minutes before separately exploding.

In early March 2024 SpaceX announced that it was targeting 14 March as the tentative launch date for its next uncrewed Starship launch configuration flight test, pending the issuance of a &quot;launch license&quot; by the FAA. This license was granted on 13 March 2024. On 14 March 2024 at 13:25 UTC, Starship launched for the third time and for the first time Starship reached its planned suborbital trajectory. The flight ended with the booster experiencing a malfunction shortly before landing and the ship being lost during re-entry over the Indian Ocean.

On 4 June 2024, SpaceX received the launch license for Starship&#x27;s fourth flight test. The licensure itself was notable in that it was the first time that the FAA included a clause that would allow SpaceX to launch subsequent test flights without a mishap investigation, provided that they met a similar launch profile and used the same specification of hardware. The provision could prove to speed the development timeline.

On 12 October 2024, SpaceX received FAA approval for Starship&#x27;s fifth flight test. The flight was the first without engine failures, and the first successful tower catch.

SpaceX launched Starship on its sixth flight test on 19 November 2024. The booster aborted the catch attempt, while the ship conducted a relight in space.

On 16 January 2025, SpaceX launched Starship on its seventh flight test, with the first Block 2 Ship, Ship 33 (standing at 403 ft or 123 meters). This test also carried a demonstration payload, a Starlink V3 simulator. The test launched at 22:37 UTC. The test resulted in the second catch of the Super Heavy booster, B14, but unfortunately after 8 minutes, SpaceX lost contact with &#x27;Ship&#x27;, which is the upper stage of the Starship which resulted in the failure of the ship during the ascent. The spacecraft reportedly exploded around 8.5 minutes after launch over the Atlantic Ocean near the Turks and Caicos Islands, putting on a display for the viewers to capture. The FAA, on the 18th of January, required a mishap investigation of the failure.

==== Crewed launches ====

A significant milestone was achieved in May 2020, when SpaceX successfully launched two NASA astronauts (Doug Hurley and Bob Behnken) into orbit on a Crew Dragon spacecraft during Crew Dragon Demo-2, making SpaceX the first private company to send astronauts to the International Space Station and marking the first crewed orbital launch from American soil in 9 years. The mission launched from Kennedy Space Center Launch Complex 39A (LC-39A) in Florida.

==== Starlink ====

In May 2019, SpaceX launched the first large batch of 60 Starlink satellites, beginning to deploy what would become the world&#x27;s largest commercial satellite constellation the following year. In 2022, most SpaceX launches focused on Starlink, a consumer internet business that sends batches of internet-beaming satellites and now has over 6,000 satellites in orbit.

On 16 July 2021, SpaceX entered an agreement to acquire Swarm Technologies, a private company building a low Earth orbit satellite constellation for communications with Internet of things (IoT) devices, for .

In December 2022, the U.S. Federal Communications Commission (FCC) approved the launch of up to 7,500 of SpaceX&#x27;s next-generation satellites in its Starlink internet network.

=== Summary of achievements ===


== Hardware ==
=== Launch vehicles ===

SpaceX has developed three launch vehicles. The small-lift Falcon 1 was the first launch vehicle developed and was retired in 2009. The medium-lift Falcon 9 and the heavy-lift Falcon Heavy are both operational.

Falcon 1 was a small rocket capable of placing several hundred kilograms into low Earth orbit. It launched five times between 2006 and 2009, of which two were successful. The Falcon 1 was the first privately funded, liquid-fueled rocket to reach orbit.

Falcon 9 is a medium-lift launch vehicle capable of delivering up to 22,800 kilograms (50,265lb) to orbit, competing with the Delta IV and the Atlas V rockets, as well as other launch providers around the world. It has nine Merlin engines in its first stage. The Falcon 9 v1.0 rocket successfully reached orbit on its first attempt on 4 June 2010. Its third flight, COTS Demo Flight 2, launched on 22 May 2012 and launched the first commercial spacecraft to reach and dock with the International Space Station (ISS). The vehicle was upgraded to Falcon 9 v1.1 in 2013, Falcon 9 Full Thrust in 2015, and finally to Falcon 9 Block 5 in 2018. The first stage of Falcon 9 is designed to retro propulsively land, be recovered, and flown again.

Falcon Heavy is a heavy-lift launch vehicle capable of delivering up to 63,800kg (140,700lb) to Low Earth orbit (LEO) or 26,700kg (58,900lb) to geosynchronous transfer orbit (GTO). It uses three slightly modified Falcon 9 first-stage cores with a total of 27 Merlin 1D engines. The Falcon Heavy successfully flew its inaugural mission on 6 February 2018, launching Musk&#x27;s personal Tesla Roadster into heliocentric orbit.

Both the Falcon 9 and Falcon Heavy are certified to conduct launches for the National Security Space Launch (NSSL). As of , the Falcon 9 and Falcon Heavy have been launched times, resulting in full mission successes, one partial success, and one in-flight failure. In addition, a Falcon 9 experienced a pre-flight failure before a static fire test in 2016.

SpaceX is developing a fully reusable super-heavy lift launch system known as Starship. It comprises a reusable first stage, called Super Heavy, and the reusable Starship second stage space vehicle. , the system was intended to supersede the company&#x27;s existing launch vehicle hardware by the early 2020s.

=== Rocket engines ===

Since the founding of SpaceX in 2002, the company has developed several rocket enginesMerlin, Kestrel, and Raptorfor use in launch vehicles, Draco for the reaction control system of the Dragon series of spacecraft, and SuperDraco for abort capability in Crew Dragon.

Merlin is a family of rocket engines that uses liquid oxygen (LOX) and RP-1 propellants. Merlin was first used to power the Falcon 1&#x27;s first stage and is now used on both stages of the Falcon 9 and Falcon Heavy vehicles. Kestrel uses the same propellants and was used as the Falcon 1 rocket&#x27;s second-stage main engine.

Draco and SuperDraco are hypergolic liquid-propellant rocket engines. Draco engines are used on the reaction control system of the Dragon and Dragon 2 spacecraft. The SuperDraco engine is more powerful, and eight SuperDraco engines provide launch escape capability for crewed Dragon 2 spacecraft during an abort scenario.

Raptor is a new family of liquid oxygen and liquid methane-fueled full-flow staged combustion cycle engines to power the first and second stages of the in-development Starship launch system. Development versions were test-fired in late 2016, and the engine flew for the first time in 2019, powering the &quot;Starhopper&quot; vehicle to an altitude of .

=== Dragon spacecraft ===

SpaceX has developed the Dragon spacecraft to transport cargo and crew to the International Space Station (ISS).

The first-generation Dragon 1 spacecraft was used only for cargo operations. It was developed with financial support from NASA under the Commercial Orbital Transportation Services (COTS) program. After a successful COTS demonstration flight in 2010, SpaceX was chosen to receive a Commercial Resupply Services (CRS) contract.

The currently operational second-generation Dragon 2 spacecraft conducted its first flight, without crew, to the ISS in early 2019, followed by a crewed flight of Dragon 2 in 2020. It was developed with financial support from NASA under the Commercial Crew Program program. The cargo variant of Dragon 2 flew for the first time in December 2020, for a resupply to the ISS as part of the CRS contract with NASA.

In March 2020 SpaceX revealed the Dragon XL, designed as a resupply spacecraft for NASA&#x27;s planned Lunar Gateway space station under a Gateway Logistics Services (GLS) contract. Dragon XL is planned to launch on the Falcon Heavy, and is able to transport over to the Gateway. Dragon XL will be docked at the Gateway for six to twelve months at a time.

SpaceX designed a spacesuit to be worn inside the Dragon spacecraft to protect from possible depressurization. On 4 May 2024, SpaceX unveiled a second spacesuit designed for extravehicular activity, planned to be used for a spacewalk during the Polaris Dawn mission.

=== Autonomous spaceport drone ships ===

SpaceX routinely returns the first stage of Falcon 9 and Falcon Heavy rockets after orbital launches. The rocket lands at a predetermined landing site using only its propulsion systems. When propellant margins do not permit a return to a launch site (RTLS), rockets return to a floating landing platform in the ocean, called autonomous spaceport drone ships (ASDS).

SpaceX also had plans to introduce floating launch platforms, which would be modified oil rigs provide a sea launch option for their Starship launch vehicle. As of February 2023, SpaceX had sold the oil rigs, but had not ruled out sea-based platforms for future use.

=== Starlink ===
Starlink is an internet satellite constellation under development by Starlink Services, LLC, a wholly-owned subsidiary of SpaceX, that consists of thousands of cross-linked communications satellites in ~550km orbits. Its goal is to address the significant unmet demand worldwide for low-cost broadband capabilities. Development began in 2015, and initial prototype test-flight satellites were launched on the SpaceX Paz satellite mission in 2017. In May 2019, SpaceX launched the first batch of 60 satellites aboard a Falcon 9. Initial test operation of the constellation began in late 2020 and first orders were taken in early 2021. Customers were told to expect internet service speeds of 50 Mbit/s to 150 Mbit/s and latency from 20 ms to 40 ms. In December 2022, Starlink reached over 1 million subscribers worldwide.

The planned large number of Starlink satellites has been criticized by astronomers due to concerns over light pollution, with the brightness of Starlink satellites in both optical and radio wavelengths interfering with scientific observations. In response, SpaceX has implemented several upgrades to Starlink satellites aimed at reducing their brightness. The large number of satellites employed by Starlink also creates long-term dangers of space debris collisions. However, the satellites are equipped with krypton-fueled Hall thrusters which allow them to de-orbit at the end of their life. They are also designed to autonomously avoid collisions based on uplinked tracking data.

In December 2022, SpaceX announced Starshield, a program to incorporate military or government entity payloads on board a Starlink-derived satellite bus. The Space Development Agency is a key customer procuring satellites for a space-based missile defense system.

In June 2024, SpaceX introduced a compact version of its Starlink antennas, the &quot;Starlink Mini&quot;, designed for mobile satellite internet use. Offered for in an early access release, it was more expensive than the base model. The Mini antenna, half the size and one-third the weight of the Standard version, featured a built-in WiFi router, lower power consumption, and over 100 Mbit/s download speeds.

== Other projects ==
=== Hyperloop ===
In June 2015, SpaceX announced that it would sponsor a Hyperloop competition, and would build a long subscale test track near SpaceX&#x27;s headquarters for the competitive events. The company held the annual competition from 2017 to 2019.

=== COVID-19 antibody-testing program ===
In collaboration with doctors and academic researchers, SpaceX invited all employees to participate in the creation of a COVID-19 antibody-testing program in 2020. As such, 4300 employees volunteered to provide blood samples resulting in a peer-reviewed scientific paper crediting eight SpaceX employees as coauthors and suggesting that a certain level of COVID-19 antibodies may provide lasting protection against the virus.

=== Other ===
In July 2018, Musk arranged for his employees to build a mini-submarine to assist the rescue of children stuck in a flooded cavern in Thailand. Richard Stanton, leader of the international rescue diving team, encouraged Musk to facilitate the construction of the vehicle as a backup in case flooding worsened. However, Stanton later concluded that the mini-submarine would not work and said that Musk&#x27;s involvement &quot;distracted from the rescue effort&quot;. Engineers at SpaceX and The Boring Company built the mini-submarine from a Falcon 9 liquid oxygen transfer tube in eight hours and personally delivered it to Thailand. Thai authorities ultimately declined to use the submarine, stating that it wasn&#x27;t practical for the rescue mission.

== Facilities ==
SpaceX is headquartered at the SpaceX Starbase near Brownsville, Texas, where it manufactures and launches its Starship vehicle. However most of the company&#x27;s operations are based out of its office in Hawthorne, California where it was previously headquartered, where it builds Falcon rockets and Dragon spacecraft, and where it houses its mission control.

The company also operates a Starlink satellite manufacturing facilities in Redmond, Washington, a rocket development and test facility in McGregor, Texas, and maintains an office in the Washington, D.C. area, close to key government customers.

SpaceX has two active launch sites in Florida, one active launch site in California and one active launch site at Starbase in Texas.

=== Hawthorne, CA: Falcon and Dragon manufacturing, mission control ===

SpaceX operates a large facility in the Los Angeles suburb of Hawthorne, California. The three-story building, originally built by Northrop Corporation to build Boeing 747 fuselages, houses SpaceX&#x27;s office space, mission control, and Falcon 9 manufacturing facilities.

The area has one of the largest concentrations of space sector headquarters, facilities, and subsidiaries in the U.S., including Boeing/McDonnell Douglas main satellite building campuses, The Aerospace Corporation, Raytheon, NASA&#x27;s Jet Propulsion Laboratory, United States Space Force&#x27;s Space Systems Command at Los Angeles Air Force Base, Lockheed Martin, BAE Systems, Northrop Grumman, and AECOM, etc., with a large pool of aerospace engineers and recent college engineering graduates.

SpaceX uses a high degree of vertical integration in the production of its rockets and rocket engines. SpaceX builds its rocket engines, rocket stages, spacecraft, principal avionics and all software in-house in their Hawthorne facility, which is unusual for the space industry.

The Hawthorne facility was SpaceX&#x27;s headquarters until August 2024. However, the move to relocate SpaceX&#x27;s headquarters was seen as largely symbolic, at least in the short term, as the facility will remain to the company&#x27;s operations.

=== Boca Chica, TX: Starship manufacturing, launch ===

SpaceX manufactures and flies Starship test vehicles from the SpaceX Starbase in Boca Chica near Brownsville, Texas, having announced first plans for the launch facility in August 2014. The Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) issued the permit in July 2014. SpaceX broke ground on the new launch facility in 2014 with construction ramping up in the latter half of 2015, with the first suborbital launches from the facility in 2019 and orbital launches starting in 2023.

SpaceX has faced increased scrutiny over the environmental impact of its Starbase facility. In August 2024, the Texas Commission on Environmental Quality cited SpaceX for violating environmental regulations by repeatedly releasing pollutants into water near the Boca Chica launch site. The EPA fined SpaceX approximately for allegedly discharging &quot;industrial wastewater&quot; and violating the Clean Water Act.

=== McGregor, TX: Rocket Development and Test Facility ===

SpaceX&#x27;s Rocket Development and Test Facility in McGregor, Texas is a rocket engine test facility. Every rocket engine and thruster manufactured by SpaceX must pass through McGregor for final testing being used on flight missions. The facility also serves as a testing ground for various components and engines during the research and development process. In addition to engine testing, after splashdown and recovery, Dragon spacecraft make a stop at McGregor to have their hazardous hypergolic propellant fuels removed, before the capsules continue on to Hawthorne for refurbishment.

SpaceX calls the facility the most advanced and active rocket engine test facility in the world, and said that , over 7,000 tests had been conducted at the facility since it opened, with seven engine test fires on a typical day, across more than a dozen test stands. Despite its low-profile compared to the company&#x27;s other facilities, is a critical part of SpaceX&#x27;s operations, and company president and COO Gwynne Shotwell maintains her primary office in McGregor.

Originally the site of the Bluebonnet Ordnance Plant during World War II, the facility was later used by Beal Aerospace before being leased by SpaceX in 2003. The company has since expanded it significantly from in 2003 to by 2015. In July 2021, SpaceX announced plans to build a second production facility for Raptor engines at McGregor. This expansion is expected to significantly increase SpaceX&#x27;s production capacity, with the goal of producing 800 to 1,000 Raptor engines per year.

=== Starlink manufacturing facilities ===

SpaceX&#x27;s Starlink subsidiary operates over two main facilities. Satellite manufacturing takes place near Seattle, Washington while user terminal manufacturing takes place near Austin, Texas.

Starlink&#x27;s satellite development and manufacturing operations campus occupies over in at least six buildings located in Redmond, Washington, east of Seattle. The first building opened in early 2015, and the company later expanded into five buildings on the Redmond Ridge Corporate Center.

Starlink opened a user terminal manufacturing facility in Bastrop, Texas, east of Austin in December 2023. In its first nine months of operation, the facility produced one million user terminals and was on track to become the largest factory for printed circuit boards in the United States.

=== Launch facilities ===

SpaceX operates four orbital launch sites, at Cape Canaveral Space Force Station and Kennedy Space Center in Florida and Vandenberg Space Force Base in California for Falcon rockets, and Starbase near Brownsville, Texas for Starship. SpaceX has indicated that they see a niche for each of the four orbital facilities and that they have sufficient launch business to fill each pad. The Vandenberg launch site enables highly inclined orbits (66–145°), while Cape Canaveral and Kennedy enable orbits of medium inclination (28.5–55°). Larger inclinations, including SSO, are possible from Florida by overflying Cuba.

Before it was retired, all Falcon 1 launches took place at the Ronald Reagan Ballistic Missile Defense Test Site on Omelek Island of the Marshall Islands.

In April 2007, the Pentagon approved the use of Cape Canaveral Space Launch Complex 40 (SLC-40) by SpaceX. The site has been used since 2010 for Falcon 9 launches, mainly to low Earth and geostationary orbits. The former Launch Complex 13 at Cape Canaveral, now renamed Landing Zones 1 and 2, has since 2015 been used for Falcon 9 first-stage booster landings.
Vandenberg Space Launch Complex 4 (SLC-4E) was leased from the military in 2011 and is used for payloads to polar orbits. The Vandenberg site can launch both Falcon 9 and Falcon Heavy vehicles, but cannot launch to low inclination orbits. The neighboring SLC-4W was converted to Landing Zone 4 in 2015 for booster landings.

On 14 April 2014, SpaceX signed a 20-year lease for Kennedy Space Center Launch Complex 39A. The pad was subsequently modified to support Falcon 9 and Falcon Heavy launches. it is the only pad that supports Falcon Heavy launches. SpaceX launched its first crewed mission to the ISS from Launch Pad 39A on 30 May 2020. Pad 39A has been prepared since 2019 to eventually accommodate Starship launches. With delays in launch FAA permits for Boca Chica, Texas, the 39A Starship preparation was accelerated in 2022.

== Contracts ==
SpaceX won demonstration and actual supply contracts from NASA for the International Space Station (ISS) with technology the company developed. SpaceX is also certified for U.S. military launches of Evolved Expendable Launch Vehicle-class (EELV) payloads. With approximately thirty missions on the manifest for 2018 alone, SpaceX represented over under contract.

=== Cargo to ISS ===

In 2006, SpaceX won a NASA Commercial Orbital Transportation Services (COTS) Phase 1 contract to demonstrate cargo delivery to the ISS, with a possible contract option for crew transport. Through this contract, designed by NASA to provide &quot;seed money&quot; through Space Act Agreements for developing new capabilities, NASA paid SpaceX to develop the cargo configuration of the Dragon spacecraft, while SpaceX developed the Falcon 9 launch vehicle with their resources. These Space Act Agreements have been shown to have saved NASA millions of dollars in development costs, making rocket development 4–10 times less expensive than if produced by NASA alone.

In December 2010, with the launch of the SpaceX COTS Demo Flight 1 mission, SpaceX became the first private company to successfully launch, orbit, and recover a spacecraft. Dragon successfully berthed with the ISS during SpaceX COTS Demo Flight 2 in May 2012, a first for a private spacecraft.

Commercial Resupply Services (CRS) is a series of contracts awarded by NASA from 2008 to 2016 for the delivery of cargo and supplies to the ISS on commercially operated spacecraft. The first CRS contracts were signed in 2008 and awarded to SpaceX for 12 cargo transport missions, covering deliveries to 2016. SpaceX CRS-1, the first of the 12 planned resupply missions, launched in October 2012, achieved orbit, berthed, and remained on station for 20 days, before re-entering the atmosphere and splashing down in the Pacific Ocean.

CRS missions have flown approximately twice a year to the ISS since then. In 2015, NASA extended the Phase 1 contracts by ordering an additional three resupply flights from SpaceX, and then extended the contract further for a total of twenty cargo missions to the ISS. The final Dragon 1 mission, SpaceX CRS-20, departed the ISS in April 2020, and Dragon was subsequently retired from service. A second phase of contracts was awarded in January 2016 with SpaceX as one of the awardees. SpaceX will fly up to nine additional CRS flights with the upgraded Dragon 2 spacecraft. In March 2020, NASA contracted SpaceX to develop the Dragon XL spacecraft to send supplies to the Lunar Gateway space station. Dragon XL will be launched on a Falcon Heavy.

=== Crewed ===

SpaceX is responsible for the transportation of NASA astronauts to and from the ISS. The NASA contracts started as part of the Commercial Crew Development (CCDev) program, aimed at developing commercially operated spacecraft capable of delivering astronauts to the ISS. The first contract was awarded to SpaceX in 2011, followed by another in 2012 to continue development and testing of its Dragon 2 spacecraft.

In September 2014, NASA chose SpaceX and Boeing as the two companies that would be funded to develop systems to transport U.S. crews to and from the ISS. SpaceX won to complete and certify Dragon 2 by 2017. The contracts called for at least one crewed flight test with at least one NASA astronaut aboard. Once Crew Dragon received NASA human-spaceflight certification, the contract required SpaceX to conduct at least two, and as many as six, crewed missions to the space station.

SpaceX completed the first key flight test of its Crew Dragon spacecraft, a Pad Abort Test, in May 2015, and successfully conducted a full uncrewed test flight in early 2019. The capsule docked to the ISS and then splashed down in the Atlantic Ocean. In January 2020, SpaceX conducted an in-flight abort test, the last test flight before flying crew, in which the Dragon spacecraft fired its launch escape engines in a simulated abort scenario.

On 30 May 2020, the Crew Dragon Demo-2 mission was launched to the International Space Station with NASA astronauts Bob Behnken and Doug Hurley, the first time a crewed vehicle had launched from the U.S. since 2011, and the first SpaceX commercial crewed launch to the ISS. The Crew-1 mission was successfully launched to the International Space Station on 16 November 2020, with NASA astronauts Michael Hopkins, Victor Glover and Shannon Walker along with JAXA astronaut Soichi Noguchi, all members of the Expedition 64 crew. On 23 April 2021, Crew-2 was launched to the International Space Station with NASA astronauts Shane Kimbrough and K. Megan McArthur, JAXA astronaut Akihiko Hoshide, and ESA astronaut Thomas Pesquet. The Crew-2 mission successfully docked on 24 April 2021.
SpaceX also offers paid crewed spaceflights for private individuals. The first of these missions, Inspiration4, launched in 2021 on behalf of Shift4 Payments CEO Jared Isaacman. The mission launched the Crew Dragon &quot;Resilience&quot; from the Florida Kennedy Space Center&#x27;s Launch Complex 39A atop a Falcon 9 launch vehicle, placed the Dragon capsule into low Earth orbit, and ended successfully about three days later when the &quot;Resilience&quot; splashed down in the Atlantic Ocean. All four crew members received commercial astronaut training from SpaceX. The training included lessons in orbital mechanics, operating in a microgravity environment, stress testing, emergency-preparedness training, and mission simulations.

=== National defense ===
In 2005, SpaceX announced that it had been awarded an Indefinite Delivery/Indefinite Quantity (IDIQ) contract, allowing the United States Air Force to purchase up to worth of launches from the company. Three years later, NASA announced that it had awarded an IDIQ Launch Services contract to SpaceX for up to , depending on the number of missions awarded. In December 2012, SpaceX announced its first two launch contracts with the United States Department of Defense (DoD). The United States Air Force Space and Missile Systems Center awarded SpaceX two EELV-class missions: Deep Space Climate Observatory (DSCOVR) and Space Test Program 2 (STP-2). DSCOVR was launched on a Falcon 9 launch vehicle in 2015, while STP-2 was launched on a Falcon Heavy on 25 June 2019.

The Falcon 9 v1.1 was certified for National Security Space Launch (NSSL) in 2015, allowing SpaceX to contract launch services to the Air Force for any payloads classified under national security. This broke the monopoly held since 2006 by United Launch Alliance (ULA) over U.S. Air Force launches of classified payloads. In April 2016, the U.S. Air Force awarded the first such national security launch to SpaceX to launch the second GPS III satellite for . This was approximately 40% less than the estimated cost for similar previous missions. SpaceX also launched the third GPS III launch on 20 June 2020. In March 2018, SpaceX secured an additional contract from the U.S. Air Force to launch another three GPS III satellites.

The U.S. National Reconnaissance Office (NRO) also purchased launches from SpaceX, with the first taking place on 1 May 2017. In February 2019, SpaceX secured a contract from the U.S. Air Force to launch another three national security missions, all slated to launch no earlier than FY 2021. In August 2020, the U.S. Space Force awarded its National Security Space Launch (NSSL) contracts for the following 5–7 years. SpaceX won a contract for for one launch. In addition, SpaceX will handle 40% of the U.S. military&#x27;s satellite launch requirements over the period.

SpaceX also designs and launches custom military satellites for the Space Development Agency as part of a new missile defense system in low Earth orbit. The constellation would give the United States capabilities to sense, target and potentially intercept nuclear missiles and hypersonic weapons launched from anywhere on Earth. Both China and Russia brought concerns to the United Nations about the program, and various organizations warn it could be destabilizing and trigger an arms race in space.

In March 2024, Reuters reported that, as part of a contract signed with the National Reconnaissance Office in 2021, SpaceX is building a network of hundreds of spy satellites. This new network, Reuters reported, would be able to operate as a swarm in low orbits.

In December 2024, WSJ reported that Musk didn&#x27;t have access to government secrets.

== Launch market competition and pricing pressure ==
SpaceX&#x27;s low launch prices, especially for communications satellites flying to geostationary transfer orbit (GTO), have resulted in market pressure on its competitors to lower their own prices. Prior to 2013, the openly competed comsat launch market had been dominated by Arianespace (flying the Ariane 5) and International Launch Services (flying the Proton). With a published price of per launch to low Earth orbit, Falcon 9 rockets were the least expensive in the industry. European satellite operators are pushing the ESA to reduce launch prices of the Ariane 5 and Ariane 6 rockets as a result of competition from SpaceX.

SpaceX ended the United Launch Alliance (ULA) monopoly of U.S. military payloads when it began to compete for national security launches. In 2015, anticipating a slump in domestic, military, and spy launches, ULA stated that it would go out of business unless it won commercial satellite launch orders. To that end, ULA announced a major restructuring of processes and workforce to decrease launch costs by half.

Congressional testimony by SpaceX in 2017 suggested that the NASA Space Act Agreement process of &quot;setting only a high-level requirement for cargo transport to the space station [while] leaving the details to industry&quot; had allowed SpaceX to design and develop the Falcon 9 rocket on its own at a substantially lower cost. According to NASA&#x27;s own independently verified numbers, SpaceX&#x27;s total development cost for the Falcon 9 rocket, including the Falcon 1 rocket, was estimated at . In 2011, NASA estimated that it would have cost the agency about to develop a rocket like the Falcon 9 booster based upon NASA&#x27;s traditional contracting processes, about ten times more. In May 2020, NASA administrator Jim Bridenstine remarked that thanks to NASA&#x27;s investments into SpaceX, the United States has 70% of the commercial launch market, a major improvement since 2012 when there were no commercial launches from the country.

As of 2024, SpaceX operates a Rideshare and Bandwagon (mid inclination) programs. This provides additional competition for small satellite launchers.

== Corporate affairs ==

=== Business trends ===


=== Board of directors ===
=== Leadership changes ===
In November 2022, the company announced COO Gwynne Shotwell and vice president Mark Juncosa would oversee Starbase, its Texas launch facility, along with Omead Afshar, who at the time oversaw operations for Tesla in Texas. Shyamal Patel, who was senior director of operations at the site, would shift to its Cape Canaveral site. &quot;CNBC&quot; reported that these executive moves demonstrated &quot;the sense of urgency within the company to get Starship flying&quot;.

=== Workplace culture ===
According to former NASA deputy administrator Lori Garver, the company overall has a male-dominated employee culture, similar to that of the spaceflight industry in general. In December 2021, claims of workplace sexual harassment from five former SpaceX employees, ranging from interns to full engineers, were published. The former employees claimed to have experienced unwanted advances and uncomfortable interactions. Additionally, the accounts included claims of a culture of sexual harassment existing at the company and one where complaints made to executives, managers, and human resources officers went largely unaddressed.

In May 2022, a Business Insider article alleged that Musk engaged in sexual misconduct with a SpaceX flight attendant in a private jet in 2016 citing an anonymous friend of the flight attendant. In response, some employees collaborated on an open letter condemning &quot;Elon&#x27;s harmful Twitter behavior&quot;. It also asks the company to clearly define SpaceX&#x27;s &quot;no-asshole&quot; and &quot;zero tolerance&quot; policies, which it says is unequally enforced from one employee to the next. The next day, Gwynne Shotwell announced that those employees who were involved with the letter had been terminated and claimed that unsponsored, unsolicited surveys were sent to employees during the work day and that some felt pressured to sign the letter.

The company has also been described as having a work culture that pushes employees to work excessively and is described as fostering a burnout culture. According to a memo by Blue Origin, a rival aerospace company with a history of lawsuits and anti-SpaceX political lobbying, SpaceX expected very long work hours, work on weekends, and limited use of holidays.

&quot;SpaceX employees say they’re paying the price for the billionaire’s push to colonize space at breakneck speed&quot; reported Reuters in 2023. An examination of OSHA&#x27;s records revealed injury rates higher than the industry&#x27;s averages. In addition, Reuters documented at least 600 previously unreported workplace injuries at SpaceX, including &quot;crushed limbs, amputations, electrocutions, head and eye wounds and one death.&quot;
In June 2024, eight ex-employees, the same who had previously been fired for penning the open letter against Elon Musk, filed a lawsuit against Musk and SpaceX alleging sexual harassment and discrimination.

In December 2024, federal agencies investigated SpaceX for security violations as well as Musk&#x27;s alleged drug use.

<text>Michal Viewegh  is one of the most popular contemporary Czech writers.

He is the most published Czech author of all time, with over a million books sold. In 1993 he earned the prestigious Jiří Orten award for Czech writers 30 years old or younger.

Viewegh survived a traumatic aortic rupture in 2012.

== Life ==
Michal Viewegh was born in Prague on 31 March 1962. His mother is a lawyer. His father was a chemical engineer, and then the mayor of Sázava.

Viewegh graduated from Benešov Gymnazium in 1980. He studied economics at the Prague University of Economics and Business, but dropped out. He then completed a degree in Czech and in pedagogy at Charles University in the Philosophy department in 1988. While in school, Viewegh began publishing short stories in &quot;Mladá fronta&quot;, with his first story published in 1983.

After graduating from university in 1988, Viewegh worked as an elementary school teacher until 1993. In 1993, he was awarded the Jiří Orten award for young Czech authors. For two years, he worked as an editor at the publishing company &quot;Český spisovatel&quot;; after that, he was able to support himself  as a professional author.

Viewegh has been married twice, first to Jaroslava Macková, with whom he has one daughter, Michaela. In 2002, he married Veronika Vieweghová (née Kodytková). They have two daughters, Sára and Barbora. They divorced in 2015.

On 12 December 2012, Viewegh suffered a traumatic aorta rupture. He suffered from depression and memory loss during his rehabilitation and was unable to write. However, it also helped him gain a new perspective on the relative importance of some of his problems before the accident. Viewegh said that when he thinks about the fact that 90% of people with a ruptured aorta do not survive, he does not worry about criticism, the tabloids, or politics anymore.

He has lived most of his life in Sázava, a village in central Bohemia.

== Works ==
Viewegh’s first book was the novella &quot;Názory na vraždu (Opinions on a Murder)&quot;, published in 1990. His first full-length novel was &quot;Báječná léta pod psa (The Wonderful Years that Sucked)&quot;, a semi-autobiographical novel which portrayed Czechoslovakia between the Prague Spring in 1968 and the fall of communism in 1989. In 1997, it was adapted into a very successful film, directed by Petr Nikolaev.

Viewegh has published novels almost every spring since the late 1990s. He sells around 50,000 copies per book and has sold over a million books total, making him the most published Czech author of all time. His works have been translated into 23 languages. His most famous works include &quot;Báječná léta pod psa, Výchova dívek v Čechách (Bringing Up Girls in Bohemia&quot;, 1994), and &quot;Román pro ženy (A Novel for Women&quot;, 2001).

In addition to novels, which make up the majority of his work, Viewegh has also published several other genres of literature. &quot;Nápady laskavého čtenáře (Thoughts of a Loving Reader&quot;, 1993) and &quot;Nové nápady laskavého čtenáře (New Thoughts of a Loving Reader&quot;, 2000) are both examples of literary parody, in which Viewegh parodies famous Czech and world authors.

Viewegh has also published collections of short stories. Additionally, he has published several autobiographical works, each capturing a small portion of his life in diary format. &quot;Můj život po životě (My Life After Life&quot;), published in 2013, details his recovery from his ruptured aorta.

Since the ruptured aorta, Viewegh has been much less prolific and successful as a writer. He still suffers from short-term memory loss, lack of directional awareness, and depression. He publishes at a much slower rate than before the injury. The general consensus is that the quality of his writing has also declined; however, some argue that his works are less successful due to poor promotion from his publisher.

== Relationship with tabloid newspapers ==
For years, Viewegh has fought Czech tabloids in the court system, and criticized them publicly, accusing the tabloids of invading his privacy and of publishing false information about him. In 2009, Viewegh and actor Marek Vašut started a petition &quot;Vzkaz bulváru a výzva kolegům (A Message to the Tabloids and an Appeal to Colleagues)&quot; criticizing Czech tabloid tactics. Many influential artists, including actress Jiřina Bohdalová, signed the petition.

== Political Views ==
Viewegh’s 1992 novel &quot;Báječná léta pod psa&quot; uses humor to criticize conditions in Czechoslovakia under communism.

Viewegh was unhappy as a writer under communism, but likes the liberties of post-communist Czechoslovakia and the Czech Republic. Viewegh has said that &quot;in the eighties I wrote two novels and neither of them were published. They were banned from being printed for the normal ideological reasons. After the revolution came absolute freedom. I was able to write just how I wanted, and to publish whatever I wanted.&quot;

Viewegh is also opposed to right-wing former Czech president Václav Klaus. This attitude is most notably displayed in his 2002 novel &quot;Báječná léta s Klausem (The Wonderful Years with Klaus)&quot;, which is a loose continuation of &quot;Báječná léta pod psa&quot;.

==Scandals==
In his column for &quot;Lidové noviny&quot; (Czech newspaper and online news site) published on 1 October 2018, Viewegh criticised Christine Blasey Ford&#x27;s allegations of sexual assault against Brett Kavanaugh on the grounds that &quot;putting her in an empty room, groping her, covering her mouth while trying to undress her&quot; was an &quot;innocent high-school petting&quot; and that he thanks God that he, as a pubescent, was free to grope his female schoolmates without endangering his future career, without any &quot;North-American cow&quot; complaining about it. He has been criticised in turn by criminologist Pavel Houdek in a published open letter, that his views are what makes victims of sexual abuse keep it to themselves.

<text>Thaliacea is a class of marine chordates within the subphylum Tunicata, comprising the salps, pyrosomes and doliolids. Unlike their benthic relatives the ascidians, from which they are believed to have emerged, thaliaceans are free-floating (pelagic) for their entire lifespan. The group includes species with complex life cycles, with both solitary and colonial forms.

==Anatomy==
The three orders of thaliaceans are filter feeders. Pyrosomes are colonial animals, with multiple tiny ascidian-like zooids arranged in a cylinder closed at one end. All of the atrial siphons point inwards, emptying into a single, common cloaca in the centre of the cylinder. As the water exhaled by the zooids exits through a common opening, the water movement slowly propels the pyrosome through the sea. Salps and doliolids have a transparent barrel-shaped body through which they pump water, propelling them through the sea, and from which they extract food. The bulk of the body consists of the large pharynx. Water enters the pharynx through the large buccal siphon at the front end of the animal, and is forced through a number of slits in the pharyngeal wall into an atrium lying just behind it. From here, the water is expelled through an atrial siphon at the posterior end. The pharynx is both a respiratory organ and a digestive one, filtering food from the water with the aid of a net of mucus slowly pulled across the slits by cilia.

Doliolids and salps alternate between asexual and sexual life stages. Salp colonies can be several meters in length. Doliolids and salps rely on muscular action to propel themselves through surrounding seawater.

Thaliaceans have complex lifecycles. Doliolid eggs hatch into swimming tadpole larvae, which are the common larval stage for other urochordates. Pyrosomes are ovoviviparous, meaning the eggs develop inside the &quot;mother&quot; without the tadpole stage. Salps are viviparous, meaning the embryos are linked to the &quot;mother&quot; by a placenta. This then develops into an oozoid, which reproduces asexually by budding to produce a number of blastozoids, which form long chains (see image). The individual blastozoids then reproduce sexually to produce the eggs and the next generation of oozoids.

The dorsal, hollow nerve cord and notochord found in Chordata has been lost, except for a rudimentary one in some doliolid larvae.

=== The jell pump and the carbon cycle ===
Thaliaceans play an important role in the ecology of the sea. Their dense faecal pellets sink to the bottom of the oceans, and this may be a major part of the worldwide carbon cycle.

==Taxonomy==
The class is a relatively small one, and is divided into three orders:

<text>South Wales ( ) is a loosely defined region of Wales bordered by England to the east and mid Wales to the north. Generally considered to include the historic counties of Glamorgan and Monmouthshire, south Wales extends westwards to include Carmarthenshire and Pembrokeshire. In the western extent, from Swansea westwards, local people would probably recognise that they lived in both south Wales and west Wales. The Brecon Beacons National Park covers about a third of south Wales, containing Pen y Fan, the highest British mountain south of Cadair Idris in Snowdonia. 

A point of some discussion is whether the first element of the name should be capitalised: &#x27;south Wales&#x27; or &#x27;South Wales&#x27;. As the name is a geographical expression rather than a specific area with well-defined borders, style guides such as those of the BBC and &quot;The Guardian&quot; use the form &#x27;south Wales&#x27;. In a more authoritative style guide, the Welsh Government, in their international gateway website, Wales.com, state that it should always be capitalised. It is always capitalised on motorway signs.

==History==
Between the Statute of Rhuddlan of 1284 and the Laws in Wales Act 1535, crown land in Wales formed the Principality of Wales. This was divided into a Principality of south Wales and a Principality of north Wales. The southern principality was made up of the counties of Ceredigion and Carmarthenshire, areas that had previously been part of the Welsh kingdom of Deheubarth (&#x27;the southern land&#x27;). The legal responsibility for this area lay in the hands of the Justiciar of South Wales based at Carmarthen. Other parts of southern Wales were in the hands of various Marcher Lords.

The Laws in Wales Acts 1542 created the Court of Great Sessions in Wales based on four legal circuits. The Brecon circuit served the counties of Brecknockshire, Radnorshire and Glamorgan while the Carmarthen circuit served Cardiganshire, Carmarthenshire and Pembrokeshire. Monmouthshire was attached to the Oxford circuit for judicial purposes. These seven southern counties were thus differentiated from the six counties of north Wales.

The Court of the Great Sessions came to an end in 1830, but the counties survived until the Local Government Act 1972 which came into operation in 1974. The creation of the county of Powys merged one northern county (Montgomeryshire) with two southern ones (Breconshire and Radnorshire).

There are thus different concepts of south Wales. Glamorgan and Monmouthshire are generally accepted by all as being in south Wales. But the status of Breconshire or Carmarthenshire, for instance, is more debatable. In the western extent, from Swansea westwards, local people might feel that they live in both south Wales and west Wales. Areas to the north of the Brecon Beacons and Black Mountains are generally considered to be in Mid Wales. The valleys and upland mountain ridges were once a very rural area noted for its river valleys and ancient forests and lauded by romantic poets such as William Wordsworth as well as poets in the Welsh language, although the interests of the latter lay more in society and culture than in the evocation of natural scenery. This natural environment changed to a considerable extent during the early Industrial Revolution when the Glamorgan and Monmouthshire valley areas were exploited for coal and iron. By the 1830s, hundreds of tons of coal were being transported by barge to ports in Cardiff and Newport. In the 1870s, coal was transported by rail transport networks to Newport Docks, at the time the largest coal exporting docks in the world, and by the 1880s coal was being exported from Barry, Vale of Glamorgan.
The Marquess of Bute, who owned much of the land north of Cardiff, built a steam railway system on his land that stretched from Cardiff into many of the South Wales Valleys where the coal was being found. Lord Bute then charged fees per ton of coal that was transported out using his railways. With coal mining and iron smelting being the main trades of south Wales, many thousands of immigrants from the Midlands, Scotland, Ireland, Cornwall, and even Italy came and set up homes and put down roots in the region. Very many came from other coal mining areas such as Somerset, the Forest of Dean in Gloucestershire and the tin mines of Cornwall such as Geevor Tin Mine, as a large but experienced and willing workforce was required. Whilst some of the migrants left, many settled and established in the south Wales Valleys between Swansea and Abergavenny as English-speaking communities with a unique identity. Industrial workers were housed in cottages and terraced houses close to the mines and foundries in which they worked. The large influx over the years caused overcrowding which led to outbreaks of Cholera, and on the social and cultural side, the near-loss of the Welsh language in the area.

The 1930s inter-war Great Depression in the United Kingdom saw the loss of almost half of the coal pits in the South Wales Coalfield, and their number declined further in the years following World War II. This number is now very low, following the UK miners&#x27; strike (1984–85), and the last &#x27;traditional&#x27; deep-shaft mine, Tower Colliery, closed in January 2008.

Despite the intense industrialisation of the coal mining valleys, many parts of the landscape of South Wales such as the upper Neath valley, the Vale of Glamorgan and the valleys of the River Usk and River Wye remain distinctly beautiful and unspoilt and have been designated Sites of Special Scientific Interest. In addition, many once heavily industrialised sites have reverted to wilderness, some provided with a series of cycle tracks and other outdoor amenities. Large areas of forestry and open moorland also contribute to the amenity of the landscape.

==Industrialised areas in the 19th and 20th centuries==
Merthyr Tydfil () grew around the Dowlais Ironworks which was founded to exploit the locally abundant seams of iron ore, and in time it became the largest iron-producing town in the world. New coal mines were sunk nearby to feed the furnaces and in time produced coal for export. By the 1831 census, the population of Merthyr was 60,000—more at that time than Cardiff, Swansea and Newport combined—and its industries included coal mines, iron works, cable factory, engine sheds and sidings and many others. The town was also the birthplace of Joseph Parry, composer of the song &quot;Myfanwy&quot;.

The Heads of the Valleys towns, including Rhymney, Tredegar and Ebbw Vale, rose out of the industrial revolution, producing coal, metal ores and later steel.

Aberfan: The Merthyr Vale colliery began to produce coal in 1875. Spoil from the mine workings was piled on the hills close to the village which grew nearby. Tipping went on until the 1960s. Although nationalised, the National Coal Board failed to appreciate the danger they had created. In October 1966, heavy rain made the giant coal tip unstable, resulting in the Aberfan disaster. The recent dumping of small particles of coal and ash known as &#x27;tailings&#x27; seems to have been partly responsible. A black wave tore downhill across the Glamorganshire Canal and swept away houses on its path towards the village school. 114 children and 28 adults were killed.

The Rhondda Valleys (Rhondda Fach and Rhondda Fawr) housed around 3,000 people in 1860, but by 1910 the population had soared to 160,000. The Rhondda had become the heart of a massive South Wales coal industry. Mining accidents below ground were common, and in 1896 fifty-seven men and boys were killed in a gas explosion at the Tylorstown Colliery. An enquiry found that the pit involved had not been properly inspected over the previous 15 months.

Ebbw Vale, the valley of the Ebbw River which stretches from the town of Ebbw Vale to Newport, includes the mining towns and villages of Newbridge, Risca, Crumlin, Abercarn and Cwmcarn. The Carboniferous Black Vein coal seams in the area lay some 900 feet (275 metres) below the surface and the mining activity associated with it was responsible for many tragic subsurface explosions, roof collapses and mining accidents.

Now the Valleys&#x27; heavy industrial past is overprinted with urban regeneration, tourism and multi-national investment. Large factory units, either empty or turned over to retail use, bear witness to the lack of success in replacing older industries.

==Language==
The native language of the majority of people in South Wales is English, but there are many who also speak Welsh. In western parts of Glamorgan, particularly the Neath and Swansea Valleys, there remain significant Welsh-speaking communities such as Ystradgynlais and Ystalyfera, which share a heritage with other ex-anthracite mining areas in eastern Carmarthenshire, as much as with the Glamorgan valleys.

The local slang, dialect and phrases of the South Wales Valleys communities have been referred to as &#x27;Wenglish&#x27;, and are often used with comic effect. The dialect is found in such coastal towns as Barry, as featured in the BBC comedy series, &quot;Gavin &amp; Stacey&quot;.

Welsh is now a compulsory language up to GCSE level for all students who start their education in Wales. Several secondary schools offering Welsh medium education operate in this area, for example Ysgol Gyfun Llanhari in Pontyclun, Ysgol Gyfun Y Cymmer in Porth in the Rhondda, Ysgol Gyfun Rhydywaun in Penywaun in the Cynon Valley, Ysgol Gyfun Gwynllyw in Pontypool, Ysgol Gyfun Cwm Rhymni in Blackwood, Ysgol Gymraeg Plasmawr in Cardiff and Ysgol Gyfun Garth Olwg in Church Village.

A significant number of people from ethnic minority communities speak another language as their first language, particularly in Cardiff and Newport. Commonly spoken languages in some areas include Punjabi, Bengali, Arabic, Somali and Chinese, and increasingly Central European languages such as Polish.

In the 19th and early 20th centuries, there was a vigorous literary and musical culture centred round eisteddfodau. Despite a few timid attempts to emulate this literature in English, it can be argued that few writers seem to connect with either the landscape or the literary tradition. The one exception, to some extent, can be considered to be Dylan Thomas.

==Religion==
The South Wales landscape is marked by numerous chapels, places of worship (past and present) of the various Christian Nonconformist congregations. The Baptist congregation at Ilston, Gower, moved to Swansea, Massachusetts, but after the restoration of the Anglican worship with the issue of the Book of Common Prayer in 1662, several &quot;gathered&quot; churches survived belonging to the Baptist, Independent and Presbyterian denominations. In the 18th century members of some of these congregations became dissatisfied with the theological innovations of some trained ministers, and created new congregations such as that at Hengoed near Ystrad Mynach. In the same century, churches were sometimes involved in the Methodist movement, especially at Groeswen and Watford near Caerphilly, which both received frequent visits from John Wesley The largest denomination, however, became the Calvinistic Methodists (later the Presbyterian Church of Wales), whose chapels can be seen in many parts.

These were mainly Welsh-language congregations. Anglicanism in South Wales became autonomous from the Church of England with the Welsh Church Act 1914, but the immediate demise of the denomination feared at that time has not taken place in the Church in Wales. There are a number of Brethren Assemblies in Cardiff and in the Swansea area and Free Presbyterian Churches in Rhiwderin, near Newport and at Merthyr Tydfil. The Roman Catholic community, despite systematic persecution, survived in the 17th to 19th centuries, especially in Brecon and among minor gentry such as the Vaughans of Welsh Bicknor, on the Monmouthshire–Herefordshire border. Among members of foreign origin of later urban Catholic congregations were the Bracchi, Italians in the café and catering trades often from Bardi in the Apennines.

Post-war diversity has brought mosques, especially in Cardiff and Newport, Sikh gurdwaras, including one on the mountain near Abercynon and a growing number of Evangelical and Pentecostal congregations. These often add a strongly international element into local life, such as the &quot;Pont&quot; twinning project between Pontypridd and Mbale, Uganda, and the creation of &quot;Fairtrade&quot; relationships with primary producers worldwide.

==Industry today==
The former heavy industries of coal and iron production have disappeared since the economic struggles of the 1970s, with the closures of that decade continuing sharply into the 1980s, and by July 1985 just 31 coal pits remained in the region. Further closures left the region with just one deep mine by the early 1990s, and this finally closed in January 2008, by which time it had transferred to private ownership after being sold off by the National Coal Board.

These industries have since largely been replaced by service sector industries.

The cities along the M4 corridor are home to a number of high-profile blue-chip companies such as Admiral Insurance, Legal &amp; General and the Welsh-based Principality Building Society. A large number of telephone call centres are located in the region and in particular in the Valleys area. Merthyr Tydfil is home to the principal UK call centre for German mobile telephone company, T-Mobile. Many jobs are also provided in small-scale and family businesses. 

One site of note on the M4 corridor is Port Talbot Steelworks – the largest steel producer in the UK and one of the biggest in Europe.

The television and film sectors are fast becoming a major industry in South Wales. In 2021, the Welsh screen sector saw a turnover of £575 million. Prominent film studios have been established in Cardiff (Wolf Studios Wales, Seren Stiwdios, Enfys Studios) as well as Bridgend (Dragon Studios) and Swansea (Bay Studios).

==Railways==
Great Western Railway operate services from Swansea, Cardiff Central and Newport to London Paddington with Class 800s.
Most services in South Wales are operated by Transport for Wales Rail on the South Wales Main Line and associated branches such as the Valley Lines.

==Media==
Radio stations include:
The Welsh national media is based in Cardiff where the BBC and ITV have their main studios and offices.

<text>Lake Poopó ( ) was a large saline lake in a shallow depression in the Altiplano in Oruro Department, Bolivia, at an altitude of approximately . Due to the lake&#x27;s length and width (), it made up the eastern half of Oruro, known as a mining region in southwest Bolivia. The permanent part of the lake body covered approximately and it was the second-largest lake in the country. The lake received most of its water from the Desaguadero River, which flows from Lake Titicaca at the north end of the Altiplano. Since the lake lacked any major outlet and had a mean depth of less than , the surface area differed greatly seasonally.

In 2002, the lake was designated as a site for conservation under the Ramsar Convention. By December 2015, the lake had completely dried up, leaving only a few marshy areas. Despite the lake rebounding from two previous recorded drying instances, as of 2016, the lake&#x27;s recovery is considered unlikely. Suggested causes of the decline are the melting of the Andes glaciers and loss of their waters, because of a drought due to climate change, as well as continued diversion of water for mining and agriculture.

==Archaeological evidence==
Archaeological investigations conducted by the San Andrés University of La Paz, Bolivia, shows the influence of the Wankarani culture in the Poopó area. Complex central urban areas, such as villages and towns, were developed that expanded into the Poopó basin during the Late Formative period, (200 BC – 200 AD), probably in conjunction with changing patterns of agriculture. Herders and the life style of llama caravan merchants coexisted with more sedentary farmers in a harmonious system of exchange of goods and services.

Other investigators examining the following period, the Early Regional Developments ( 300 – 900 AD), have concluded that the size of the inhabited areas increased. The South Poopó inhabitants developed a unique style of ceramics style with triangular spirals. The east portion of the lake has evidence of an important Tiwanaku enclave, with ceramic styles from the core Titicaca area and surrounding styles, demonstrating the interactions between different peoples in the area.

== Lake dynamics ==
The main inlet of Lake Poopó (roughly 92% of the water) came from the Desaguadero River, which entered the lake at the north end. It flowed south from Lake Titicaca. There were numerous smaller inlets along the eastern shore of the lake, many of which were dry most of the year. At times of very high water levels, Poopó was connected to the salt desert Salar de Coipasa in the west. A minor outlet led to Salar de Uyuni in the far south of the Altiplano, but as the lake lacks any major outlet, it is classified as an endorheic basin.
When the water level of Lake Titicaca was below , the flow of Desaguadero River was so low it could no longer compensate for the massive water losses due to evaporation from the surface of Lake Poopó. At this point, the lake volume began to decrease. At its maximum in 1986, the lake had an area of . During the years that followed, the surface area steadily decreased until 1994, when the lake disappeared completely. The time period between 1975 and 1992 was the longest period in recent times when the lake had a continuous water body.

Action has been taken in order to make the area ecologically sustainable again, with the help of funding from the European Union. But the efforts have been unable to offset other changes: since 1995 regional temperatures have risen and consequently tripled evaporation rates. In addition, water was drawn off for mining and irrigation, compounding the problems. On 20 January 2016 the area was declared a disaster zone by the Bolivian government.

=== Salinity and geology ===

The water of Lake Poopó was highly saline. The salinity was a result of the endorheic nature of the hydrological system on the Altiplano, which allowed all weathered ions to remain in the system. The salinity of Lake Poopó was further increased by the arid climate and the high evaporation from the lake surface.

In the northern end of Lake Poopó, dilution of the salinity occurred due to freshwater flow from the Desaguadero River. The salt gradient of the water increased towards the south.

The salinity varied with water volume. During October and November 2006, the salinity in the north end of the lake varied between brackish and saline (15–30,000 mg/L). In the south end of the lake the water was classified as a brine (105,000–125,000 mg/L). The water type was a 4–2 Na-(Mg)-Cl-(SO4).

Geological sources of sodium chloride (NaCl), such as halite and feldspars, are present in the drainage area. These could also contribute to the salinity of Lake Poopó. The lake body was situated on top of Cenozoic deposits, consisting mainly of unconsolidated material. These sediments are the remains of extensive prehistoric lakes, which covered the Altiplano during at least five glaciation periods.

=== Mining and heavy metals ===
There is a long tradition of mining in the Poopó Basin. Extraction of metals was ordered in the 13th century to support the Inca army. After Spanish colonization in the 16th century, the mining operations increased in scale. At this point the region became known as one of the mining centres of Bolivia.
The mining districts are situated at the foothills of the Cordillera Oriental along the eastern border of the Poopó basin. The most important minerals to the economy are silver and tin.

Studies have shown elevated concentrations of heavy metals in surface and ground waters of the Poopó basin. These metals are naturally present in the bedrock, from which they are released through weathering processes. The mining activities in the area further contributes to the heavy metal pollution. Acid leaching from mines and mechanical processing of ore speed up the process.

The major part of the heavy metals transported to Lake Poopó were immobilized in the bottom sediments. But concentrations of arsenic, lead, and cadmium in the lake water exceeded Bolivian and World Health Organization guideline values for drinking water.

== Flora and fauna ==
There were only three fish species in the system: the native pupfish &quot;Orestias agassizii&quot; and catfish &quot;Trichomycterus rivulatus&quot;, and the introduced silverside &quot;Odontesthes bonariensis&quot;. The lake had a relatively large fish population, but by 2017 pollution and the near-complete reduction of water had all but decimated the locally important fishing industry.

The aquatic bird life was very diverse, with a total of 34 species. Most famous are the three species of flamingo (Andean, James&#x27;s and Chilean), which mainly lived in the shallow lagoons in the northern and eastern parts of the lake. An inventory of the bird population, made in 2000 in cooperation with BirdLife International, identified 6 threatened species and others that are near-threatened. Among these are the Andean flamingo and the Andean condor.

A total of 17 higher plants and 3 species of algae were identified in and around Lake Poopó. Due to the constant drought and flooding, the littoral zone experienced great disturbances. As a result, there was hardly any vegetation to be found on the shores of the lake.

==Effects of the loss of the lake==
The sparse communities nearby have suffered culturally and financially due to the loss of the lake, as the local economy was dependent on lake fishing. Additionally, many bird species native to Bolivia and internationally have been affected due to loss of food, and an annual migration area.

<text>The United States Senate Committee on Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs is the chief oversight committee of the United States Senate. It has jurisdiction over matters related to the Department of Homeland Security and other homeland security concerns, as well as the functioning of the government itself, including the National Archives, budget and accounting measures other than appropriations, the Census, the federal civil service, the affairs of the District of Columbia and the United States Postal Service. It was called the United States Senate Committee on Governmental Affairs before homeland security was added to its responsibilities in 2004. It serves as the Senate&#x27;s chief investigative and oversight committee. Its chair is the only Senate committee chair who can issue subpoenas without a committee vote.

==History==
While elements of the committee can be traced back into the 19th century, its modern origins began with the creation of the Committee on Expenditures in the Executive Departments on April 18, 1921. The Committee on Expenditures in the Executive Department was renamed the Committee on Government Operations in 1952, which was reorganized as the Committee on Governmental Affairs in 1978. After passage of the Intelligence Reform and Terrorism Prevention Act of 2004, the committee became the Committee on Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs and added homeland security to its jurisdiction.
Of the five current subcommittees, the Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations is the oldest and most storied, having been created at the same time as the Committee on Government Operations in 1952. The Subcommittee on the Oversight of Government Management, the Federal Workforce, and the District of Columbia was established after the creation of the Committee on Governmental Affairs in 1978. The Subcommittee on Federal Financial Management, Government Information, Federal Services and International Security was created in 2003.

Two ad hoc subcommittees were established in January 2007 to reflect the committee&#x27;s expanded homeland security jurisdiction. They were the Subcommittee on Disaster Recovery and the Subcommittee on State, Local, and Private Sector Preparedness and Integration. The Subcommittee on Contracting was added in 2009. In 2011, the Disaster and State, Local, and Private Sector subcommittees were merged to form the Subcommittee on Disaster Recovery and Intergovernmental Affairs.

Over the years, the Committee on Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs and its predecessors have dealt with a number of important issues, including government accountability, congressional ethics, regulatory affairs, and systems and information security. In 2003, after the Homeland Security Act of 2002 established the Department of Homeland Security, the committee adopted primary oversight of the creation and subsequent policies, operations, and actions of the department.

In the past decade, the committee has focused particularly on the Department of Homeland Security&#x27;s ability to respond to a major catastrophe, such as Hurricane Katrina; the rise of homegrown terrorism in the United States; and the vulnerabilities of the nation&#x27;s most critical networks, those operating systems upon which our national defense, economy, and way of life depend, such as the power grid, water treatment facilities, transportation and financial networks, nuclear reactors, and dams.

In February 2014, staff working for committee ranking member Senator Tom Coburn issued a report raising concerns that some passwords protecting highly sensitive government data &quot;wouldn&#x27;t pass muster for even the most basic civilian email account.&quot;

==Jurisdiction==
In accordance of Rule XXV(k) of the United States Senate, all proposed legislation, messages, petitions, memorials, and other matters relating primarily to the following subjects is referred to the Senate Homeland Security Committee:
# Archives of the United States;
# Budget and accounting measures, other than appropriations, except as provided in the Congressional Budget Act of 1974;
# Census and collection of statistics, including economic and social statistics;
# Congressional organization, except for any part of the matter that amends the rules or orders of the Senate;
# Department of Homeland Security, as provided in S.Res.445.
# Federal Civil Service;
# Government information;
# Intergovernmental relations;
# Municipal affairs of the District of Columbia, except appropriations therefor;
# Organization and management of United States nuclear export policy;
# Organization and reorganization of the executive branch of Government;
# Postal Service; and
# Status of officers and employees of the United States, including their classification, compensation, and benefits.

The committee also has the duty of:
# receiving and examining reports of the Comptroller General of the United States and of submitting such recommendations to the Senate as it deems necessary or desirable in connection with the subject matter of such reports;
# studying the efficiency, economy, and effectiveness of all agencies and departments of the Government;
# evaluating the effects of laws enacted to reorganize the legislative and executive branches of the Government; and
# studying the intergovernmental relationships between the United States and the States and municipalities, and between the United States and international organizations of which the United States is a member.

<text>Edward Hitchcock (May 24, 1793 – February 27, 1864) was an American geologist and the third President of Amherst College (1845–1854).

==Life==
Born to poor parents, he attended newly founded Deerfield Academy, where he was later principal, from 1815 to 1818. In 1821 he was ordained as a Congregationalist pastor and served as pastor of the Congregational Church in Conway, Massachusetts, 1821–1825. He left the ministry to become Professor of Chemistry and Natural History at Amherst College. He held that post from 1825 to 1845, serving as Professor of Natural Theology and Geology from 1845 until his death in 1864. In 1845, Hitchcock became President of the College, a post he held until 1854. As president, Hitchcock was responsible for Amherst&#x27;s recovery from severe financial difficulties. He is also credited with developing the college&#x27;s scientific resources and establishing its reputation for scientific teaching.

In addition to his positions at Amherst, Hitchcock was a well-known early geologist. He ran the first geological survey of Massachusetts, and in 1830 was appointed state geologist of Massachusetts (he held the post until 1844). He also played a role in the geological surveys of New York and Vermont. His chief project, however, was natural theology, which attempted to unify and reconcile science and religion, focusing on geology. His major work in this area was &quot;The Religion of Geology and Its Connected Sciences&quot; (1851). In this book, he sought out ways to re-interpret the Bible to agree with the latest geological theories. For example, knowing that the earth was at least hundreds of thousands of years old, vastly older than the 6,000 years allowed by certain biblical interpretations, Hitchcock devised a way to read the original Hebrew so that a single letter in Genesis—a &quot;v&quot;, meaning &quot;afterwards&quot;—implied the vast timespans during which the earth was formed. Randy Moore described Hitchcock as &quot;America&#x27;s leading advocate of catastrophism-based gap creationism.&quot;

Hitchcock left his mark in paleontology. He discovered some of the first fossil fishes in the United States. He published papers on fossilized tracks in the Connecticut Valley, including Eubrontes and Otozoum, that were later associated with dinosaurs, though he believed, with a certain prescience, that they were made by gigantic ancient birds. In the Hitchcock Ichnological Cabinet he established a remarkable collection of fossil footmarks. His son, Edward &quot;Doc&quot; Hitchcock Jr., named one of the earliest dinosaurs discovered in North America and the United States, &quot;Megadactylus polyzelus&quot;. Later it was reclassified as the type specimen of &quot;Anchisaurus polyzelus&quot; (ACM 41109), a prosauropod. This botanist is denoted by the author abbreviation E.Hitchc. when citing a botanical name.

As he had researched the geologic lake which once filled the Connecticut River basin, this prehistoric lake was named after him. Since he had done geological research on the Holyoke Range, one of the mountains there, Mount Hitchcock, was named after him.

He was elected a Fellow of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences in 1834. From 1856 to 1861, Hitchcock was the State Geologist for Vermont.

In 1841, he was elected as a member to the American Philosophical Society.

His collections, a bust and portrait can be viewed at the Amherst College Museum of Natural History. The Archives and Special Collections at Amherst holds his papers.

In 1821, he married Orra White, one of the earliest women botanical and scientific illustrators in the U.S. The two worked closely together, and she contributed more than 1,000 illustrations to his many scientific publications.

==Paleontological chart==

He inserted a paleontological chart in his &quot;Elementary Geology&quot; (1840). It shows a branching diagram of the plant and animal kingdom against a geological background. He referred to it as a tree. This &quot;tree of life&quot; is the earliest known version that incorporates paleontological and geological information.

Hitchcock was an advocate of gap creationism. Hitchcock saw God as the agent of change. He explicitly rejected evolution and a religious six-day creation. He believed that new species were introduced by a deity at the right time in the history of the earth. The chart is present in all editions between 1840 and 1859. After Charles Darwin (1859) published his &quot;On the Origin of Species&quot;, a tree of life image was generally interpreted as an evolutionary tree. In the 1860 edition of &quot;Elementary Geology&quot; Hitchcock dropped the chart. In 1863 Hitchcock wrote an article in which he criticized Darwin’s theory of natural selection. After his death in 1864, his son Charles Henry Hitchcock (1836–1919) published a new edition (1870) also without a paleontological chart. Charles then published books and articles of his own.

<text>Louis Emil Denfeld (April 13, 1891 – March 28, 1972) was an admiral in the United States Navy who served as Chief of Naval Operations from December 15, 1947 to November 1, 1949. He also held several significant surface commands during World War II, and after the war he served as the dual-hatted commander of United States Pacific Command and Pacific Fleet.

==Life and naval career==
Born in Westborough, Massachusetts, Denfeld graduated from the United States Naval Academy in 1912. His Naval Academy classmates included future admirals Daniel E. Barbey, Elliot Buckmaster, Charles A. Lockwood, Charles P. Mason, Alfred E. Montgomery, DeWitt C. Ramsey, Mahlon Tisdale, Louis Wenzell, and Carleton F. Wright. He took command of the destroyer in 1919 and served aboard the submarine during 1923 and 1924. He commanded Destroyer Division 11 from 1935 to 1937.

Denfeld was selected to be aide to the Chief of Naval Operations in 1939, then commanded first Destroyer Division 18, then Destroyer Squadron 1 from 1939 to 1941. He served as Chief of Staff to the Commander of the United States Atlantic Fleet, Admiral Royal E. Ingersoll. For planning of safe routes for escort convoys in this capacity, Denfeld received the Legion of Merit. He became head of the Atlantic Fleet Support Force in 1941, then assistant chief to the Bureau of Navigation in 1942. He led Battleship Division 9 in 1945, was appointed Chief of the Bureau of Personnel in 1945, and commanded United States Pacific Command and Pacific Fleet in 1947.

On February 28, 1947 Denfeld was named Military Governor of the Marshall Islands, Caroline Islands, and Mariana Islands, replacing Admiral John H. Towers. Denfeld was appointed Chief of Naval Operations on December 15, 1947. Due to his role in the &quot;Revolt of the Admirals&quot;, he was detached from duty by the Secretary of the Navy Francis P. Matthews on November 1, 1949, and retired in 1950.

Denfeld was a candidate for Governor of Massachusetts in 1950. He lost the Republican nomination to Arthur W. Coolidge. Denfield died in Westborough, Massachusetts at the age of 80. He is buried at Arlington National Cemetery. Denfeld Avenue in Kensington, Maryland, is named for him.

==Awards and decorations==
Admiral Louis E. Denfeld received many decorations during his career. Here is his ribbon bar:

<text>MICDS (Mary Institute and Saint Louis Country Day School) is a secular, co-educational, independent school home to more than 1,250 students ranging from grades Junior Kindergarten through 12. Its campus is located in the St. Louis suburb of Ladue.

Each of the school&#x27;s three divisions operate somewhat independently as a &quot;school within a school&quot;. The Lower School, also referred to as The Ronald S. Beasley School, or &quot;Beasley&quot; for short, is for students in grades junior kindergarten through 4. The MICDS Middle School, grades 5 to 8, is in the former Mary Institute facilities. The Upper School on the former Country Day School campus serves grades 9 through 12.

==History==

William Greenleaf Eliot, founder and chancellor of Washington University in St. Louis, established predecessor institutions to MICDS in the 1850s as part of the university. A boys&#x27; school, Smith Academy, was founded in 1854.

A sister school for girls, Mary Institute, was founded in 1859 and was named for Eliot&#x27;s late daughter Mary Rhodes Eliot, who had died at 17. In its early years, Mary Institute moved twice within the city of St. Louis; its third building, at the corner of Lake and Waterman, is now New City School.

Smith Academy closed in June 1917, in part due to the proliferation of private elementary schools and public secondary schools in the area. Three months later, St. Louis Country Day School opened in northwestern St. Louis County. Inspired by the Country Day School movement nationally, it was not related to Smith, although a number of former Smith students enrolled that first year. St. Louis Country Day School&#x27;s campus was in a bucolic setting reached by electric streetcar, far removed from the noise and grit of the city.

Mary Institute moved to its Ladue campus in 1931 and became independent of Washington University in 1949. The Mary Institute building contains a three-figure bronze sculpture by Cyrus Dallin: Alma Mater, honoring schoolmaster Edmund Hamilton Sears and donated by Eliza Northrop McMillan. By the 1950s, the tranquility of the Country Day campus was disrupted by the growth of the adjacent Lambert–Saint Louis International Airport. St. Louis Country Day School moved to a new campus next to Mary Institute in Ladue in 1958, and eventually sold its old campus to the airport. Eliot&#x27;s grandson, Nobel Prize laureate T. S. Eliot, who attended Mary Institute&#x27;s kindergarten and Smith Academy, spoke at Mary Institute&#x27;s centennial in 1959. 

In the 1970s, Mary Institute and Country Day began expanding their long-existing connections, including theatrical cooperation, into academic coordination. This would culminate in the schools&#x27; 1992 merger.

St. Louis Country Day headmaster John Johnson, who coordinated the merger, became head of the combined schools. The school observed its sesquicentennial during a celebration that ran from May 11, 2009, to May 11, 2010.

In 2013, MICDS opened a STEM building on the Upper School campus that contained classrooms, an auditorium, a hearth room, and student commons. The space also contains conference rooms, a faculty office space and work center, a robotics garage, and a science lab for independent research. The building is certified as LEED Platinum.

==Athletics==
MICDS teams have won 32 state championships and 41 district championships.

The school has one of the few high school cycling teams in St. Louis. They competed in the Tour De St. Louis in 2009; two MICDS riders finished with the peloton.

MICDS has an athletic rivalry with the nearby John Burroughs School. MICDS observes its Homecoming on the weekend when all the teams play Burroughs; there is a traditional bonfire and pep rally to inspire team spirit. MICDS also has a cross-state rivalry with The Pembroke Hill School in Kansas City.

Pro Football Hall of Fame inductee Marv Levy began his coaching career here in 1951, staying for two years.

The women&#x27;s varsity field hockey team won the Midwest Championships in 2013, 2014, and 2015.

Boys&#x27; water polo finished third in the state in 2014.

The boys&#x27; lacrosse team has won eight state championships, including six straight championships since 2014 under head coach Andy Kay.

=== Athletic facilities ===

In 2024, MICDS began building the Michael W. and Quirsis V. Riney Family Tennis Center to replace the old tennis courts. Completion is expected in March 2025.

In 2016, MICDS began building the O&#x27;Hara field and stadium, which replaced Ellis Field. It is used for football, lacrosse, and soccer. The same year, MICDS also began construction on the Steward Family Aquatic Center, which has a pool with a bulkhead in the center, allowing two teams to practice at the same time. The pool is also longer and the lanes are wider. It is also deep enough to allow the diving team to practice on campus.

In 2011, a donor offered to fund the construction of an ice hockey arena, but the city of Ladue rejected the proposal and the arena was never built. The team practices off campus.

<doc id="832917" wikidata="Q4792613" url="?curid=832917" title="Armalite and ballot box strategy">
<text>Armalite and ballot box was a political catchphrase used to define the strategy pursued by Irish republicans from 1981 up until the 1994 IRA ceasefire in which Sinn Féin ceased its policies of election boycott and abstentionism and instead contested elections in Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland, while the Provisional Irish Republican Army (IRA) pursued an armed campaign to end Northern Ireland&#x27;s status as part of the United Kingdom.

&quot;Armalite&quot; refers to the AR-15 and AR-18 ArmaLite rifles. The Armalite corporation initially manufactured both; later Colt did so. The IRA smuggled significant quantities of these rifles into Northern Ireland during the early 1970s, and the &quot;Armalite&quot; became a symbol of republican armed struggle. 

==History==
The strategy emerged after the 1981 Irish hunger strike as a response to the electoral success of Bobby Sands in the April 1981 Fermanagh and South Tyrone by-election and pro-hunger strike campaigners in the Northern Ireland local elections and Republic of Ireland Dáil Éireann elections of the same year. It was first formulated by Sinn Féin organiser Danny Morrison at the party&#x27;s Ard Fheis (Annual Conference) on 31 October 1981, when he said:

The strategy was a mixed success. Sinn Féin had a solid core of 9-13 percent of the vote in Northern Ireland, which gave the party some credibility on the international stage. However, at home, it highlighted the non-violent Social Democratic and Labour Party&#x27;s (SDLP&#x27;s) dominance in Northern nationalist politics, while Sinn Féin&#x27;s vote in the Republic remained tiny once the emotion generated by the 1981 hunger strike subsided.

In the longer term, it had two significant political consequences, each of which fed into the emergent Northern Ireland peace process. When the governments of the UK and the Republic of Ireland drafted the Anglo-Irish Agreement, this convinced many in Sinn Féin that it was possible to make political gains without violence. However, Sinn Féin&#x27;s electoral setbacks, such as the loss of 16 of the party&#x27;s 59 council seats in 1989, pushed the emphasis of the Republican movement away from the Armalite and towards an election-focused strategy.

On 12 August 1994, just 19 days before the first IRA ceasefire, Danny Morrison declared that the Armalite and Ballot Box approach was over, and stated that &quot;different times require different strategies&quot;. By that time, a confidential paper had been released within the IRA and Sinn Féin, referred to as the &quot;TUAS document&quot;. The TUAS (Total Unarmed Strategy) set the goal of achieving a wide Irish nationalist consensus among the main nationalist players (Sinn Féin, SDLP and the Republic) with strong international support (especially from the U.S. and the European Union).

==Legacy==

The Armalite and ballot box strategy has also been cited as having inspired members of the Loyalist Ulster Defence Association such as John McMichael to seek a similar route into electoral politics through vehicles such as the Ulster Loyalist Democratic Party (later Ulster Democratic Party (UDP)). However, parties directly linked to Loyalist paramilitaries had minimal success in elections in Northern Ireland, with the combined electoral share of the UDP and the Progressive Unionist Party (PUP) failing to exceed 1% before the May 1996 elections for the Northern Ireland Forum.

<doc id="832941" wikidata="Q908324" url="?curid=832941" title="Brookfield Corporation">
<text>Brookfield Corporation is a Canadian-American multinational company that is one of the world’s largest alternative investment management companies, with over US$900 billion of assets under management in 2023. It focuses on direct control investments in real estate, renewable power, infrastructure, credit and private equity. The company invests in distressed securities through Oaktree Capital, which it bought in 2019. Brookfield&#x27;s headquarters are in Toronto and New York 

==History==

The company was founded in 1899 as the São Paulo Tramway, Light and Power Company by William Mackenzie and Frederick Stark Pearson. It operated in the construction and management of electricity and transport infrastructure in Brazil.

In 1904, the Rio de Janeiro Tramway, Light and Power Company was founded by Mackenzie’s group.

In 1912, Brazilian Traction, Light and Power Company was incorporated in Toronto as a public company to develop hydro-electric power operations and other utility services in Brazil, becoming a holding company for São Paulo Tramway Co. and Rio de Janeiro Tramway Co. In 1916, Great Lakes Power Company was incorporated to provide hydro-electric power in Sault Ste. Marie and the Algoma District in Ontario.

In 1959, Edper Investments, founded by brothers Peter and Edward Bronfman, acquired Brazilian Traction, Light and Power Company for $15 million. In 1966, Brazilian Traction, Light and Power Company changed its name to Brazilian Light and Power Company, and again in 1969, changed its name to Brascan Limited. Brascan is a portmanteau of “Brasil” and “Canada”.

During the 1970s, the company began to sell its Brazilian interests, and invested more heavily in industries such as real estate, timber and mining.

In 1979, the last of the company’s Brazilian assets were transferred to Brazilian ownership (Eletropaulo and Light S.A.), the company meanwhile having diversified to other areas. The company provided electricity and tram services in São Paulo and Rio de Janeiro. After restructuring, the company’s Brazilian portfolio operated as Light S.A., short for Brazilian Traction, Light and Power Co. Ltd.

In 1992, Brookfield and Johnson Controls was established through a merger in Canada of Brookfield and Johnson Controlsa building systems and facility management company that was founded in the late 19th century by Warren S. Johnson, whose invention of the first electric room thermostat helped launch the building control industry. By 2012, Brookfield and Johnson Controls became an established industry leader with 11,500 locations across Canada. In 2007, Brookfield Asset Management acquired the Multiplex, an Australian international construction contracting company founded in 1962 by John Roberts. which was valued at that time at approximately A$7.3 billion. It was renamed Brookfield Multiplex in 2016. In 2012 Brookfield Asset Management and Johnson Controls Global WorkPlace Solutions (GWS) merged to create Brookfield Johnson Controls.

In 2002, Bruce Flatt was appointed CEO of Brascan.

In June 2005 Noranda, which was 41%-owned by Brascan, merged with Falconbridge Limited, and in August 2005 Brascan decided to sell its mineral holdings, to Xstrata.

In September 2005, after 37 years, Brascan Corp. was renamed to Brookfield Asset Management Inc. Between 2013 and 2018, the company and its subsidiaries invested approximately $10 billion in Brazilian energy, infrastructure and real estate developments, including acquisitions of oil pipelines from energy companies such as Petroleo Brasileiro SA.

In 2015, Brookfield Asset Management became the ultimate parent company of what is now Brookfield Global Integrated Solutions (BGIS), when it acquired control of Brookfield Johnson Controls from its joint venture partner, Milwaukee-based Johnson Controls. At that time, an activist investor had been putting pressure on Johnson Controls to divest of its real estate division. The facilities management business was renamed Brookfield Global Integrated Solutions (BGIS) as part of Brookfield’s plan to establish a “leading global facilities management provider”. BGIS expanded rapidly following Brookfield&#x27;s taking control of BGIS in 2015, In 2016, when BGIS acquired the US-based data centre facility management serviceMcKinstry FMSwhich had over “350 engineers, technicians, planners and program managers”, BGIS became one of the largest facility management companies serving data centres in North America. By 2017, when Gord Hicks was named as Toronto-based BGIS’ CEO, the company had 7,000 staff members and 100 clients in the United States, the United Kingdom, Asia, and Canada, which included contracts with the Canadian federal government.

The vendor with the second largest federal government contracts in 2021–2022 was IBM Canada with a contract valued at c. 476 million.

In 2020, in response to the COVID-19 pandemic, Brookfield’s CEO Bruce Flatt assessed that the economic fallout was “much more manageable” than previous meltdowns.

== Reactions and lawsuits ==

In September 2010, a group called Birch Mountain Shareholders for Justice filed a lawsuit with the Ontario Superior Court of Justice against Brookfield Asset Management, challenging an acquisition and transfer of assets. Birch Mountain had run into financial troubles and accused Brookfield of financial engineering that resulted in Brookfield acquiring the company&#x27;s $1.6 billion limestone quarry for $50 million. According to Birch Mountain, Brookfield had made use of death spiral financing and insider trading. After five years of litigation the case was dismissed, based on the fact that Birch Mountain had failed to present credible evidence. In May 2015, the plaintiffs filed a notice of appeal, but their case was likewise dismissed two years later.

In 2009, Brookfield sued financial and insurance giant American International Group (AIG) in a Manhattan federal court, alleging that AIG’s collapse caused default provisions in interest-rate swaps. The suit stemmed from AIG’s acceptance of a $182.3 billion bailout package from the federal government, which Brookfield argued overturned AIG’s bankruptcy protection. The insurance firm countersued, claiming that Brookfield was trying to get out of its $1.5 billion debt to AIG. The litigation ended with Brookfield paying $905 million to settle the lawsuit.

In March 2013, the Southern Investigative Reporting Foundation called into question Brookfield’s makeup. The analysis written by Roddy Boyd accused the company of using a pyramidal control structure, alleging that a small group of shareholders hold outsized power and may easily use the capital of other investors without risking their own.

In 2013, a Brazilian prosecutor filed charges against the company’s local division, alleging the company paid bribes to local officials, which is also a violation of U.S. federal criminal law. The bribes were allegedly used to pave the way for Brookfield to build a shopping center in São Paulo. The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission also opened a formal investigation into the company about the bribery charges. The company denied the charges. The U.S. Department of Justice also opened a criminal investigation into the company regarding these allegations, and did not end up making any arrests. According to the Stanford Law School Foreign Corrupt Practices Act Clearinghouse, which studied the case, the investigation and filing of charges was initiated by a whistleblower and anonymous tip. Later it was revealed that the whistleblower was the former CFO of a Brookfield subsidiary. She claims she was fired for refusing to participate in Brookfield’s bribery scheme. The company disclosed the investigations on several 6-K forms between 2013 and 2015.

In August 2018, Brookfield signed a 99-year lease on the financially troubled 666 Fifth Avenue skyscraper, of Donald Trump’s son in law Jared Kushner. The deal raised suspicions that the Qatar Investment Authority, a major investor in Brookfield, was attempting to influence the Trump administration.

In November 2020, it was revealed that Brookfield might be partnering with telecommunications giant Rogers Communications to introduce condominiums to the site of the Rogers Centre, halving the space available for sport. The original multi-purpose stadium and its land cost $570 million, significantly funded by taxpayers, yet was sold 15 years later to Rogers for just $25 million.

In February 2021, Mark Carney, Vice chairman and Head of Impact Investing and ex Governor of the Bank of England, had to retract an earlier claim that the $600 billion Brookfield Asset Management portfolio was carbon neutral. He based his claim on the fact that Brookfield has a large renewable energy portfolio and “all the avoided emissions that come with that”. The claim was criticized as an accounting trick, as avoided emissions do not counteract the emissions from investments in coal and other fossil fuels responsible for a carbon footprint of about 5,200 metric tons of carbon dioxide. The company is actually aiming to be net-zero by 2050, 

== Finances ==

<doc id="832954" wikidata="Q747424" url="?curid=832954" title="Ross Geller">
<text>Ross Eustace Geller (born October 18, 1968) portrayed by David Schwimmer, is one of the six main characters of the NBC sitcom &quot;Friends&quot;. Ross is considered by many to be the most intelligent member of the group and is noted for his goofy but lovable demeanor. His relationship with Rachel Green was included in &quot;TV Guide&quot;″s list of the best TV couples of all time, as well as &quot;Entertainment Weekly&quot;″s &quot;30 Best &#x27;Will They/Won&#x27;t They?&#x27; TV Couples&quot;. Kevin Bright, who was one of the executive producers of the show, had worked with Schwimmer before, so the writers were already developing Ross&#x27;s character in Schwimmer&#x27;s voice. Hence, Schwimmer was the first person to be cast on the show.

==Appearances==

Ross is a paleontologist and has a Ph.D. His romantic feelings toward Rachel Green (Jennifer Aniston), which began as a high-school infatuation, are an ongoing theme of his narrative arc. Likewise, their on-again, off-again romantic relationship is a nearly constant theme of &quot;Friends&quot;.

Raised on Long Island, Ross is the elder brother of Monica Geller (Courteney Cox), and son of Jack (Elliott Gould) and Judy Geller (Christina Pickles). Ross and Monica are Jewish and see themselves as at least cultural Jews, with Ross taking a more active role in wanting to teach his son, Ben(Cole Sprouse), about the faith. Ross gets divorced and is newly single in the first episode because his wife, Carol (Jane Sibbett), has realized she&#x27;s a lesbian. Later in the series, he dates Rachel, but they split up when he sleeps with another woman the night they decide their relationship is &quot;on a break&quot;. After his relationship with Rachel ends, Ross marries Emily Waltham (Helen Baxendale), the niece of Rachel&#x27;s boss. However, because Ross says &quot;I, Ross, take thee, Rachel&quot; instead of Emily during the nuptials, the marriage doesn&#x27;t last long. In season 5, Ross and Rachel drunkenly marry in Las Vegas, and ultimately that marriage results in a divorce as well; however, they confess that if they ever got married properly it would be the one that lasted. Throughout the series, Ross gets divorced three times. In the first episode of &quot;Joey&quot;, the spin-off series, it is hinted that Ross and Rachel may have gotten married again, as Joey Tribbiani (Matt LeBlanc) tells his sister Gina (Drea de Matteo) that all of his friends are married.

A running theme in Ross&#x27;s narrative is his competition with Monica, manifested through wrestling and paranoia. As children, they took part in a family football game for the &quot;Geller Cup&quot; every Thanksgiving. This tradition ended in its sixth year after Monica &quot;accidentally&quot; broke Ross&#x27;s nose. The siblings came up with a dance in primary school called &quot;The Routine&quot;, which they performed as adults at Dick Clark&#x27;s New Year&#x27;s Rockin&#x27; Eve in a New Year&#x27;s Eve TV broadcast. When they were children, Monica felt that their parents favored Ross, but as they grew up, she actually liked Ross as a person and loved him more than simply out of a sense of family obligation. As adults, they became close, though the competition between them was still visible, as seen in the season three episode, &quot;The One with the Football&quot;.

Ross often comes into conflict with Phoebe Buffay (Lisa Kudrow). His rationality and Phoebe&#x27;s eccentricity lead to conflict over evolution, gravity, and whether Phoebe&#x27;s mother was reincarnated as a cat. It is also revealed that Phoebe once mugged Ross (stealing a copy of the comic book &quot;Science Boy&quot; that Ross had created) when they were teenagers. The two are roommates for a few weeks when a fire forces Phoebe to move out of her apartment. She first moves into Chandler Bing (Matthew Perry) and Monica&#x27;s apartment but then decides she wants to give the newly engaged couple some privacy, so she moves in with Ross. In a &quot;flashback&quot; episode, they are alone at a bar and start kissing, but the moment quickly passes when Ross keeps bumping his head. Phoebe also helps Ross on numerous occasions, ultimately making him realize that he loves Rachel and they are meant to be together.

Since college, Ross&#x27;s best friend has been Chandler Bing. In college, they were in a band called &quot;Way/No Way&quot;, and Ross blamed Chandler when he was caught smoking marijuana. They become brothers-in-law after Chandler married Monica. Though they are best friends, at times Chandler gets annoyed with Ross&#x27;s geeky behavior.

Ross is friends with Rachel Green, whom he has had a crush on since high school. Rachel viewed Ross as ‘Monica’s geeky older brother’ during high school. During the first episode of the series, when they meet after years apart, he rediscovers his feelings for her. They become close and have an on-and-off romantic relationship through the series. In the final season of the show, Rachel tells him that he means more to her than any other member of their group.

Ross is also close friends with Joey Tribbiani and helps him with auditions. He kisses Joey once in order to help him practice a role as a gay man, only to find out that Joey had already done the audition and didn&#x27;t get the part. Joey and Ross also briefly try to cut Chandler out of their friend group after Chandler ignores them. They once fall asleep together on the couch after watching &quot;Die Hard&quot;. Toward the end of the series, however, Ross and Joey become closer friends, often hanging out together after Chandler gets married.

Ross often tries to bring out the best in his friends in difficult situations. For instance, in season 2, he encourages Joey to audition for &quot;Another World&quot; after being fired from &quot;Days of Our Lives&quot; despite Joey&#x27;s refusal to audition for a two-line part of a secondary character. In season 7, he buys Phoebe the bicycle of her dreams but threatens to take it away from her because of her reluctance to learn how to ride it. Also, when he discovers that Joey has a crush on Rachel, he tells him to go for it, even though he finds it difficult to accept the idea of Joey and Rachel being together. Over all, Ross is portrayed as a very sweet, loving, and adorable character who is always looking out for everyone&#x27;s best interests, and he is often the most mature compared to the rest of the gang (despite his ego, outbursts, and paranoia).

He has two children:
* Ross&#x27;s son, Ben [Geller-Willick-Bunch], was conceived while Ross and Carol were still married and born at the end of Season 1. Ross shares joint custody of Ben with his ex-wife Carol and her wife Susan (Jessica Hecht). Ben appeared in a total of 24 episodes (25 including uncut episodes) and was played chronologically as follows: as an infant by Michael Gunderson in Seasons 1 &amp; 2, by brothers Charles Thomas Allen and John Christopher Allen from Seasons 3 to 5, and by Cole Sprouse from Seasons 6 to 8.
* Ross&#x27; daughter with Rachel, Emma Geller-Green, was born at the end of Season 8. Rachel&#x27;s pregnancy was originally revealed in the season finale of Season 7. The conception of Emma was the result of a one-night stand, which was later revealed in the Season 8 episode, &quot;The One With The Videotape&quot;.

Ross claims to have &quot;given up a career in basketball&quot; to become a paleontologist and claims that the ideas for &quot;Jurassic Park&quot; and &quot;Die Hard&quot; were stolen from him. He also had a major interest in music, playing the keyboard for hours in the basement of their house in Long Island. Ross also claims credit for the Got Milk? slogan.

Ross had a pet in the first season of the show: a white-headed capuchin monkey named Marcel (although the monkey used in the series was a female called Katie).

==Relationships==

Over the course of the show, Ross dates a considerable number of women. He is married three times and divorced three times. His proclivity to marry and divorce is a running gag within the series.

*Julie: An old graduate school colleague, portrayed by Lauren Tom. She first appears in the final scene of the Season 1 finale, returning with Ross from an archeological dig in China. They start dating in Season 2 but break up after Ross discovers Rachel&#x27;s feelings for him and decides he wants to be with her instead. It is heavily implied that she starts a relationship with Russ, an ex-boyfriend of Rachel&#x27;s with an uncanny resemblance to Ross.
*Bonnie: A love interest (played by Christine Taylor) introduced to Ross by Phoebe. Bonnie is formerly a militant bald woman who no longer shaves her head. She enjoyed a sex-filled relationship with Ross until a conniving Rachel broke them up by first encouraging Bonnie to shave her head again, which she knows will bother Ross, and later by revealing she was interested in reuniting with Ross.
*Mona: A love interest he met at Monica and Chandler&#x27;s wedding (portrayed by Bonnie Somerville). Ross becomes paranoid after Mona proposes to send out Christmas cards together, and in a panic decides to give her a key to his apartment. It is later revealed that Mona is unable to say &quot;I love you&quot; yet, and delivers what the female friends refer to as &quot;an emotional slap in the face&quot; with &quot;I love spending time with you&quot;. The relationship ends when Mona discovers that Rachel is living in Ross&#x27;s apartment after Ross neglects to tell her this himself. When he hides in her apartment to retrieve his shirt while she is on a date with another man, Mona, under the belief that Ross wants to win her back, admits she still has feelings for him but states that they both need to move on.
*Chloe: Ross&#x27;s only connection with Chloe (referred to in a few prior episodes as &quot;the cute girl from the copy place with the belly button ring&quot;) was a one-night stand during a break in his relationship with Rachel, which interferes with their attempt to get back together. Although only covered over two episodes in Season 3, Ross&#x27; fling with Chloe would be the basis of the &quot;We were on a break!&quot; running joke that would last until the very end of the series.
*Janice: Ross has a brief fling with Janice, Chandler&#x27;s ex-girlfriend, in Season 5. Phoebe said they would have very hairy children. Janice ironically dumps Ross because he whines too much. Ross, worried about how his friend would react, tells Chandler, who laughs but chooses to forgive him.
*Elizabeth Stevens (Alexandra Holden): A pretty 20-year-old student who Ross teaches during his first year as a professor. The two go through a tremendous amount of effort to keep their relationship a secret from the faculty, as Ross would get fired for dating a student. He even tries to get on good terms with Elizabeth&#x27;s father Paul (Bruce Willis), who in turn threatens to report him to the university. Ross eventually manages to blackmail Paul into pretending to like him by threatening to reveal Paul&#x27;s embarrassing mirror dance routine to Rachel (who dates him briefly). Despite Paul no longer being a threat, Ross eventually realizes he sees no future in his relationship with Elizabeth and decides to break up with her due to her immaturity.
*Charlie Wheeler: Ross meets Charlie (Aisha Tyler) in &quot;The One With The Soap Opera Party&quot;. She is a paleontologist who has recently joined Ross&#x27;s department. She initially dates Joey but breaks up with him and gravitates toward Ross, after realizing she has more in common with Ross. She eventually reconciles with her ex-boyfriend and breaks up with Ross.
*Cheryl (Rebecca Romijn): A very attractive woman that Ross briefly dates. He decides he wants to pursue a relationship with her but is stifled by her incredibly filthy apartment. Despite her own living quarters being littered with garbage and infested with a variety of pests, she can&#x27;t stand the &quot;weird smell&quot; of Ross&#x27; apartment, which is why she doesn&#x27;t like being there. Ross breaks off the relationship after being covered in trash in an attempt to make out with Cheryl. Monica later visits her and offers to clean her apartment, revealing she &quot;couldn&#x27;t sleep&quot; after Ross told her about it.
*Jill Green: Ross very briefly dates Rachel&#x27;s spoiled younger sister Jill (played by Reese Witherspoon) after her father sends her to New York City to take lessons from Rachel in self-sufficiency. Although Jill actually finds Ross a geek, she dates him out of spite because Rachel is uncomfortable with it and tells her &quot;she&#x27;s always wanted what she couldn&#x27;t have&quot;. Ross, upon realizing he is being used, breaks it off with Jill because he does not want to end any possibility there could be of him and Rachel getting back together.

===Rachel Green===

Rachel is Ross&#x27;s most significant relationship during the series and briefly his wife. His attraction to her is established early on; Ross met Rachel through his sister Monica, who was Rachel&#x27;s best friend in high school. He developed an unrequited crush on her but never followed through on it. After leaving college, Ross married Carol, whom he had met in college, and had seemingly put his feelings for Rachel aside before he met her again in &quot;The Pilot&quot;.

They have an on-again, off-again dynamic throughout most of the show.

In the Season 1 finale, Ross has to go to China for his work so he asks Chandler to give Rachel the birthday present which he had bought for her. Chandler gives the present to Rachel during her birthday celebration while Ross is in China, but he also accidentally reveals Ross&#x27;s feelings for Rachel. This prompts Rachel to panic and start thinking about Ross in a romantic way. After Ross arrives back from China, Rachel goes to the airport to meet him after realizing that she likes him, but she sees him with Julie and reluctantly backs off.

In the Season 2 episode &quot;The One Where Ross Finds Out&quot;, Rachel is on a date with a guy when she drunkenly calls and confesses to Ross that she had feelings for him, but now she is over him. Ross hears this message the next day at Monica&#x27;s apartment with Rachel begging him not to check his messages. Later, in the same episode, they share a passionate kiss at the doors of Central Perk. Ross breaks up with Julie to be with her, but Rachel decides she does not want to be with him after finding out that he had made a list, at Chandler&#x27;s insistence, comparing the good and bad qualities of her and Julie. In the later episode &quot;The One with the Prom Video&quot;, it is revealed that Ross, despite being two years senior to Rachel, had decided to take her to her and Monica&#x27;s prom, as Rachel&#x27;s date had not arrived, only to be left disappointed as her date finally shows up and they all leave for the prom. Touched by this, Rachel kisses Ross, and the two begin dating.

However, they take a break from their relationship on their one-year anniversary after Rachel&#x27;s overtime work prevents them from spending time together. That same night, Ross has a one-night stand with Chloe, which causes Rachel to officially end their relationship. They get together again at the end of Season 3 but again break up at the start of Season 4. Some of the later episodes show them to still be in love with each other, such as when Ross cancels his Discovery channel appearance to be with Rachel when she breaks her rib, or when Rachel flies to London to tell Ross before his wedding to Emily that she is still in love with him, only to realize that it would be better not to tell. Ross, however, accidentally says Rachel&#x27;s name at the altar, and the marriage soon dissolves.

In the Season 5 finale &quot;The One in Vegas&quot;, Ross and Rachel marry each other after getting drunk in Las Vegas. This marriage ends in a divorce after a failed application for an annulment; the two sadly admit that they thought if they ever married each other it would last.

In the seventh season premiere &quot;The One with Monica&#x27;s Thunder&quot;, after the news of Monica and Chandler&#x27;s engagement, a passionate moment between them leads to Ross and Rachel kissing. Monica is hurt by this as she believed that Rachel was trying to “steal her thunder”. The kiss is later revealed to have happened because Rachel is upset that she is “not even close” to being engaged.

At the end of Season 7 at Monica and Chandler&#x27;s wedding, it is revealed that Rachel is pregnant. The father is revealed to be Ross in the second episode of Season 8, and Rachel tells him in the next episode. They decide to have the baby, but the two do not resume their romantic relationship. In the middle of the season, Joey asks Rachel to move in with Ross so Ross can be more involved with her pregnancy. In the Season 8 finale, Ross and Rachel&#x27;s daughter is born and named Emma Geller-Green. Rachel soon moves out of Ross&#x27;s apartment in the middle of Season 9 when she realizes their platonic situation is not working.

In the final episode of the show, when Rachel is moving to Paris for her job with a new fashion brand, Ross tells her at the airport that he loves her and asks not to leave. Rachel initially does not respond to his feelings, but when the plane is about to take off, she realizes that she loves him too and gets off the plane. They profess their love for each other and decide to be together once and for all.

In the first episode of the spin-off/sequel series &quot;Joey&quot;, it is hinted at that Ross and Rachel were remarried shortly after the events of Season 10 as Joey tells his sister Gina that all of his friends are married. In the fifteenth episode, Ross is mentioned, though not by name. Joey tells his sister Gina that he confessed his love to Rachel but she was pregnant with Ross&#x27;s baby and eventually ended up with him; this is the reason why Joey becomes reluctant to confess the same feelings to his girlfriend, Sarah.

===Carol Willick===

Carol (Anita Barone for the pilot episode, Jane Sibbett thereafter) is Ross&#x27;s first wife and the mother of his son Ben. In the very first episode, Carol has just moved out of their apartment after coming out of the closet as a lesbian and leaving Ross for a woman named Susan Bunch, whom she later marries.

In the early days, however, Ross and Carol seemed to have had a very passionate relationship. Carol is the only woman he&#x27;s ever had sex with (and hence lost his virginity to) at the start of the series. It is also revealed they shared a steamy session at Disneyland behind the &quot;Dutch children&quot; in It&#x27;s a Small World, which got them a lifetime ban from the theme park. In the third-season episode, &quot;The One with the Flashback&quot;, it is revealed that Carol met Susan at her gym, and it is implied that they had a short affair before Carol could no longer bring herself to cheat on Ross, who innocently believed they were just friends, and told him the truth.

Ross maintains a fairly healthy relationship with Carol after their divorce, and both decide to raise Ben together through shared parenting; but he doesn&#x27;t hide his contempt for Susan as she &quot;destroyed their marriage&quot; and initially wanted to keep him out of Ben&#x27;s life, having once told him that the baby was not his and would not have the surname &quot;Geller&quot;. He briefly considers getting back together with Carol and they even share a kiss at a sushi restaurant, but Carol makes it clear that she can&#x27;t reciprocate his feelings and has chosen to be with Susan. In the second season, Carol and Susan briefly call off their wedding due to Carol&#x27;s homophobic parents&#x27; refusal to bless their relationship. Ross gives Carol away at the wedding and shares a dance with Susan, who develops a newfound respect for him.

In the alternate timeline episode &quot;The One That Could Have Been&quot; (Season 6), Carol and Susan are portrayed in a far more negative light. Exploring what could have happened if Ross and Carol never got divorced, it is revealed that they have been on a sexual dry spell that has lasted for months. During ideas to improve their sex life, Carol suddenly becomes very excited when Ross proposes that they have a threesome with another woman. Picking Susan, whom she met at her gym just like in the real timeline, the two women immediately proceed to have sex without Ross right in front of him, seemingly indifferent to his feelings. Ross later explains to Joey that he felt like a third wheel, trying to be involved while Susan kept kicking him away, and ended up being so bored he made himself a sandwich. Ross realizes his wife is a lesbian when Rachel states outright that Carol &quot;sounds gay.&quot;

===Emily Waltham===

During the fourth season, Ross meets and falls in love with Emily Waltham (Helen Baxendale), a British woman who is set up with Ross by Rachel. Six weeks into their relationship, Ross asks Emily to move in with him. This escalates into a marriage proposal. The two plan a wedding in London, to which Rachel is invited.

During the ceremony, Ross, upon seeing Rachel, has a slip of the tongue and says Rachel&#x27;s name instead of Emily&#x27;s during his vows. Emily is furious and leaves the wedding. She later decides to forgive Ross, and reaches the airport in time to leave for their honeymoon, but is upset when she sees Ross and Rachel boarding the plane together. Ross, having given up on meeting Emily at the airport, invited Rachel on their honeymoon as a friend. Emily flees again. She later calls Ross only to tell him that he has to stop calling and harassing her relatives, but Ross makes her reveal her love for him. She says that she will return only if Ross stops being friends with Rachel. Unable to do so, Ross ends his marriage with Emily.

Shortly before Emily gets remarried to another man, she gets cold feet and leaves a message on Ross&#x27;s answering machine asking whether their divorce was a mistake. Rachel accidentally deletes Emily&#x27;s message. Despite Monica pleading with her to keep Ross in the dark about it, Rachel tells him that Emily called, as she believes he should be in charge of his own happiness. When he starts to doubt whether or not he should return Emily&#x27;s call, however, Rachel convinces him not to.

== Reception ==
Ross Geller has become a well-known figure in pop culture, particularly due to his relationship with Rachel Green, his neurotic nature, and his love for dinosaurs.

In 2015, a play titled &quot;Ross &amp; Rachel&quot; debuted at the Edinburgh Fringe Festival.

In October 2016, Ross Geller was voted &quot;the Best Friends Character&quot; in an international poll held by Comedy Central, during six weeks of &quot;FriendsFest&quot; on the channel.

<doc id="832973" wikidata="Q12410039" url="?curid=832973" title="Streatham Common">
<text>Streatham Common is a large open space on the southern edge of Streatham in the London Borough of Lambeth. The shallow sloping lower (western) half of the common is mostly mowed grass, and the upper (eastern) half is mostly woodland with some small areas of gorse scrub and acid grassland. The eastern half has been designated a Local Nature Reserve.

==History==

Streatham Common is one of two former areas of common land in the former parish of Streatham. The other is now known as Tooting Bec Common. After enclosure, the Common was purchased in 1883 for use as a public open space under the powers conferred under the Metropolitan Commons Act 1878. It was at this time that most of the trees lining the edges of the lower common were planted. The Common was conveyed to the Metropolitan Board of Works and was subsequently administered by the London County Council and Greater London Council before maintenance responsibility passed to the London Borough of Lambeth in 1971.

The Common had a long tradition of cricket playing from the 18th century, and the right to play cricket is enshrined in the Supplementary Act that brought the common into public ownership.

Thomas Ripley the famous architect built and lived at 10 Streatham Common South, now known as Ripley House. Henry Tate, founder of the Tate Gallery and the Tate &amp; Lyle sugar company lived at Park Hill by the Common.

==The Rookery==

Adjacent to the historic common, there is a formal garden, The Rookery, formerly the grounds of a large house that housed visitors to one of Streatham&#x27;s historic mineral wells.

The Rookery is well known for its old cedar trees in the main garden. There is also a rock garden - with a cascade and lower water garden dominated by giant Gunnera. A series of walled gardens were created in part of the former kitchen gardens, including an Old English Garden and a White Garden - which predates the more famous garden in the same style at Sissinghurst Castle.

The remaining parts of the kitchen gardens, which had been used as a council plant nursery, but had been abandoned for twenty years, are now managed by Streatham Common Community Garden for community food growing, and are open to the public on most Sundays.

The Rookery and the adjacent Hilly Four Acres field was purchased by public subscription in 1911 to save the site from residential development, presented to the London County Council, and opened as a public park in 1913. The south east end of Streatham Common and The Rookery abut Norwood Grove within the London Borough of Croydon. The appeal committee that had bought The Rookery was reformed in 1923 to save Norwood Grove from development, and there is now an almost continuous series of green spaces along the ridge line from Streatham to Crystal Palace.

The gently sloping lawns of The Rookery are used as an open-air theatre in the summer.

==Management==
A Management Advisory Committee (MAC) was set up in 1996 for the conservation of Streatham Common and The Rookery, resulting in the designation of the nature reserve and subsequent detailed habitat management plans. A separate Friends of Streatham Common group promotes events on the Common and in The Rookery, including an annual kite festival. The MAC&#x27;s functions have been carried out by the Friends group since 2011.

The Streatham Common Co-operative (SCCoop) was set up by members of the Friends to provide local management of the Common that would provide greater local accountability than the borough-wide parks maintenance contracts. After several years preparation, management of The Rookery transferred to SCCoop in 2015. After Lambeth budget cuts threatened closure of the paddling pool, SCCoop accepted responsibility for managing the pool from Summer 2016 and the associated fund-raising. During 2017, SCCoop has also taken on conservation work in the nature reserve areas of the Common. Following the 2016 &quot;in-sourcing&quot; of Lambeth&#x27;s parks maintenance from Veolia to a new Lambeth Landscapes DSO, plans for a further transfer of maintenance functions have been deferred. 
The London Wildlife Trust is currently working with Lambeth Council and the Friends of Streatham Common to improve the site for wildlife, as a part of The Great North Wood Project.

In 2010, Streatham Common was saved from the threat of a &quot;temporary&quot; ice rink being built on it while Tesco redeveloped the former Streatham ice rink by a vigorous local campaign under the umbrella group &#x27;Hands Off Our Common&#x27;.

<text>In 1830, in the days before the outbreak of the July Revolution against the Bourbon Restoration in France, the conquest of Algeria was initiated by Charles X as an attempt to increase his popularity amongst the French people. The invasion began on 5 July 1830. Afterwards Algeria would become a territory within the French colonial empire from 1830 to 1962, under a variety of governmental systems.

=== French colony of Algeria (1830–1848) ===
=== French departments of Algeria (1848–1962) ===

Shortly after the July Monarchy of Louis Philippe I was overthrown in the Revolution of 1848, the new government of the Second Republic ended Algeria&#x27;s status as a colony and declared it in the 1848 Constitution an integral part of France. Three civil departements — Alger, Oran, and Constantine — were organized under a civilian government.

<doc id="833003" wikidata="Q867776" url="?curid=833003" title="Yuzu">
<text>Yuzu (Citrus&quot; × &quot;junos, from Japanese or ; ) is a citrus fruit and plant in the family Rutaceae of Chinese origin. Yuzu has been cultivated mainly in East Asia, though it has also recently been grown in New Zealand, Australia, Spain, Italy, and France.

It is believed to have originated in central China as an F1 hybrid of the () subspecies of mandarin orange and the ichang papeda.
== Description ==
This fruit resembles a yellow clementine with uneven skin and can be either yellow or green depending on the degree of ripeness. &quot;Yuzu&quot; fruits, which are very aromatic, typically range between in diameter but can be as large as a regular grapefruit (up to , or larger).

Yuzu forms an upright shrub or small tree, which commonly has many large thorns. Leaves are notable for a large, leaf-like petiole, resembling those of the related makrut lime and ichang papeda, and are heavily scented.

Yuzu closely resembles sudachi (&quot;Citrus sudachi&quot;, a Japanese citrus from Tokushima Prefecture, a yuzu–mandarin orange cross) in many regards, though, unlike the sudachi, yuzu eventually ripen to an orange colour and there are subtle differences between the flavours of the fruit.

== Cultivation ==
The yuzu originated and grew wild in Tibet and central China. It was introduced to Japan and Korea during the Tang dynasty and is still cultivated there. It grows slowly, generally requiring ten years to fruit. To shorten the duration to fruiting, it may be grafted onto karatachi (&quot;P. trifoliata&quot;). It is unusual among citrus plants in being relatively frost-hardy, due to its cold-hardy Ichang papeda ancestry, and can be grown in regions with winters as low as where more sensitive citrus would not thrive.

== Varieties and similar fruits ==
In Japan, an ornamental version of yuzu called &quot;flower yuzu&quot; is also grown for its flowers rather than its fruit. A sweet variety of yuzu known as the , only present in Japan, became severely endangered during the 1970s and 1980s; a major attempt has been made to revive this varietal in southern Japan. Another variety of yuzu in Japan, with knobby skin, is called .

Dangyuja, a Korean citrus fruit from Jeju Island, is often considered a type of yuzu due to its similar shape and flavor, but it is genetically a variety of pomelo.

== Use ==
=== East Asia ===
==== Culinary use ====
===== Japan =====
Yuzu&#x27;s domestic production is about 27,000 tons (2016). Though rarely eaten as a fruit, yuzu is a common ingredient in Japanese cuisine, where the aromatic zest (outer rind) and the juice are used much in the same way that lemons are used in other cuisines. The yuzu&#x27;s flavor is tart and fragrant, closely resembling that of the grapefruit, with overtones of mandarin orange.

It is an integral ingredient (along with sudachi, daidai, and other similar citrus fruits) in the citrus-based sauce ponzu, and yuzu vinegar is also produced. Yuzu is often combined with honey to make (), a kind of syrup that is used to make yuzu tea (), or as an ingredient in alcoholic drinks such as the yuzu sour (). (also , literally ) is a spicy Japanese sauce made from green or yellow yuzu zest, green or red chili peppers, and salt.

It is used to make liquor (such as , ) and wine. Slivered yuzu rind is used to garnish a savory, salty egg-pudding dish called &quot;chawanmushi&quot;, as well as miso soup. It is often used along with and . Yuzu is used to make various sweets, including marmalade and cake. It is used extensively in the flavoring of many snack products, such as Doritos.

===== Korea =====
In Korean cuisine, yuja is most commonly used to make (, yuja marmalade) and yuja tea. can be made by sugaring peeled, depulped, and thinly sliced yuja, and , yuja tea, can be made by mixing hot water with . (, yuja punch), a variety of (fruit punch), is another common dessert made with yuja. Yuja is also a common ingredient in Korean-style Western food, such as salads.

==== Other uses ====
=====Yuzu baths=====

Yuzu is also known for its characteristically strong aroma, and the oil from its skin is marketed as a fragrance. In Japan, bathing with yuzu on Tōji, the winter solstice, is a custom that dates to at least the early 18th century. Whole yuzu fruits are floated in the hot water of the bath, sometimes enclosed in a cloth bag, releasing their aroma. The fruit may also be cut in half, allowing the citrus juice to mingle with the bathwater. The yuzu bath, known commonly as (), but also as (), is said to guard against colds, treat the roughness of skin, warm the body, and relax the mind.

=====Use as wood=====
The body of the &quot;taepyeongso&quot;, a Korean traditional oboe, close to the Chinese &quot;suona&quot; or the zurna, is often made from jujube, mulberry, or yuzu wood.

=== Elsewhere ===
As of the early 21st century, yuzu has been increasingly used by chefs in the United States and other Western nations, achieving notice in a 2003 article in &quot;The New York Times&quot;.

In the United States, the Department of Agriculture has a ban on the import of fresh yuzu (alongside most citrus plants) from abroad, including both the fruit and the trees. This is intended to prevent the spread of contagious diseases amongst domestic crops. However, as a result of its introduction to California in 1888, yuzu is cultivated and available for sale in the United States.

<doc id="833011" wikidata="Q625495" url="?curid=833011" title="Duck and cover">
<text>&quot;Duck and cover&quot; is a method of personal protection against the effects of a nuclear explosion. Ducking and covering is useful in offering a degree of protection to personnel located outside the radius of the nuclear fireball but still within sufficient range of the nuclear explosion that standing upright and uncovered is likely to cause serious injury or death. In the most literal interpretation, the focus of the maneuver is primarily on protective actions one can take during the first few crucial seconds-to-minutes after the event, while the film of the same name and a full encompassing of the advice also cater to providing protection up to weeks after the event.

The countermeasure is intended as an alternative to the more effective target/citywide emergency evacuation when these crisis relocation programs would not be possible due to travel and time constraints. Maneuvers similar, but not identical, to &quot;Duck and Cover&quot; are also taught as the response to other sudden destructive events, such as an earthquake or tornado, in the comparable situation where preventive emergency evacuation is similarly not an option, again, due to time constraints. In these analogously powerful events, &quot;Drop, Cover and Hold on&quot; likewise prevents injury or death if no other safety measures are taken.

==Procedure==

===During a surprise nuclear attack===
Immediately after one sees the first flash of intense heat and light of the developing nuclear fireball, one should stop, get under some cover and drop/duck to the ground. There, one should assume a prone-like position, lying face-down, and to afford protection against the continuing heat of the explosion further cover exposed skin and the back of one&#x27;s head with one&#x27;s clothes; or, if no excess cover or cloth is available, one should cover the back of one&#x27;s head and neck with one&#x27;s hands.

Similar instructions, as presented in the &quot;Duck and Cover &quot; film, are contained in the British 1964 public information film &quot;Civil Defence Information Bulletin No. 5&quot; and in the 1980s &quot;Protect and Survive&quot; public information series. Children in the Soviet Union likewise received almost identical classes on countermeasures, according to &quot;Inside the Kremlin&#x27;s Cold War&quot; authors Zubok and Pleshakov.

In U.S. Army training, soldiers are taught to fall down immediately and cover their face and hands in much the same way as is described above.

In the classroom scene of the film, the rapid employment of school desks, as an improvised shelter following the awareness of the initial light flash, is a countermeasure primarily to offer protection from potential ballistic window glass lacerations when the slower moving blast wave arrived. However, in higher blast pressure zones, where partial-to-total building collapse may occur, it would also serve a similar role to that borne out from experience in urban search and rescue, where voids under the debris of collapsed buildings are common places for survivors to be found. More rigid examples of void-forming-tables to shelter under include the &quot;Morrison indoor shelter&quot;, which was widely distributed by the millions in Britain as a protective measure against building collapse, brought about by blast pressures generated during the conventional bombing of cities in World War II.

====When warning is given====
Under the conditions where some warning is given, one is advised to find the nearest bomb shelter, or if one could not be found, any well-built building to stay and shelter in place. Sheltering is, as depicted in the film, also the final phase of the &quot;duck and cover&quot; countermeasure in the surprise attack scenario.

===Cursory analysis===
The &quot;duck and cover&quot; countermeasure could save thousands. This is because people, being naturally inquisitive, would instead run to windows to try to locate the source of the immensely bright flash generated at the instant of the explosion. During this time, unbeknownst to them, the slower moving blast wave, would be rapidly advancing toward their position, only to arrive and cause the window glass to implode, shredding onlookers. In the testimony of Dr. Hiroshi Sawachika, although he was sufficiently far away from the Hiroshima bomb himself and was not behind a pane of window glass when the blast wave arrived, those in his company who were had serious blast injury wounds, with broken glass and pieces of wood stuck into them. The Hiroshima and Nagasaki explosions were fission bombs which are much weaker than thermonuclear devices, also known as &quot;H-bombs&quot;, by a factor of 1000 or more. Two Japanese cities, Hiroshima and Nagasaki, were hit by bombs in 1945 that had a force equivalent to 16 kilotons (16,000 tons) and 21 kilotons of TNT, respectively. On 1 November 1952, the first hydrogen bomb was exploded by the United States at Enewetak atoll in the Marshall Islands. &quot;Mike&quot;, codename for the bomb, released energy equal to around 10 megatons — or 10 million tons of TNT. In 1961, the Tsar bomb was exploded by the Soviet Union, producing an explosion with a mass of 50 megatons— which was about 1,500 times more than the combined force of the atomic bombs fired on Hiroshima and Nagasaki. 

===During earthquakes and tornadoes===
Similar advice to &quot;duck and cover&quot; is given in many situations where structural destabilization or flying debris may be expected, such as during an earthquake or tornado. At a sufficient distance from a nuclear explosion, the blast wave produces similar results to these natural phenomena, so similar countermeasures are taken. In areas where earthquakes are common, a countermeasure known as &quot;Drop, Cover, and Hold On!&quot; is practiced. Likewise, in tornado-prone areas of the United States, especially those within Tornado Alley, tornado drills involve teaching children to move closer to the floor and to cover the backs of their heads to prevent injury from flying debris. Some US states also practice annual emergency tornado drills.

== History ==
The dangers of viewing explosions behind window glass were known of before the Atomic Age began, being a common source of injury and death from large chemical explosions. The Halifax Explosion of 1917, an ammunition ship exploding with the energy of roughly 2.9 kilotons of TNT, injured the eyes and faces of hundreds of people who stayed behind and looked out of their windows after seeing a bright flash, with 200 blinded by broken glass when the slower moving blast arrived. Every window in the city of Halifax, Nova Scotia, was shattered in this catastrophe of human error.

In the Record of the &quot;Nagasaki A-bomb War Disaster&quot;, those close to the hypocenter (Matsuyama township), were described as all having been killed, with the exception of &quot;a child who was in an air-raid shelter.&quot; A little further away, Professor Seiki of Nagasaki Medical School Hospital was building an air-raid dugout 400 m from the hypocenter of the detonation and survived. Chimoto-san, who was atop a distant hill that creates the valley in which Nagasaki is located, performed the similar &quot;&quot; maneuver upon seeing the bomb drop, which was notably &quot;prior&quot; to the detonation. However despite having these few seconds of relatively unique warning, he did not stay on the ground for long enough after the &quot;flash&quot; subsided, and received some translational injuries due to prematurely standing-up again, at which point the slower moving blast wave swept past him and carried him with it for a few meters.

According to the 1946 book &quot;Hiroshima&quot; and other books which cover both bombings, in the days between the atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki, some survivors of the first bombing went to Nagasaki and taught others about ducking after the atomic &quot;flash&quot; and informed them about the particularly dangerous threat of imploding window glass. As a result of this and other factors, far fewer died in the initial blast at Nagasaki as compared to those who were not taught to duck and cover. The general population however was not warned of the heat or blast danger following an atomic flash, due to the new and unknown nature of the atomic bomb. Many people in Hiroshima and Nagasaki died while searching the skies, curious to locate the source of the brilliant flash.

When people are indoors, running to windows to investigate the source of bright flashes in the sky still remains a common and natural response to experiencing a bright flash. Thus, although the advice to duck and cover is over half a century old, ballistic glass lacerations caused the majority of the 1000 human injuries following the Chelyabinsk meteor air burst of 15 February 2013.
This response was also observed among people in the vicinity of Hiroshima and Nagasaki.

==Background==

The United States&#x27; monopoly on nuclear weapons was broken by the Soviet Union in 1949 when it tested its first nuclear explosive, the RDS-1. With this, many in the US Government, as well as many citizens, perceived that the United States was more vulnerable than it had ever been before. In 1950, during the first big Civil Defense push of the Cold War—and coinciding with the &quot;Alert America!&quot; initiative to educate Americans on nuclear preparedness, the adult-orientated Survival Under Atomic Attack was published. It contains &quot;duck and cover&quot; or more accurately, cover and then duck advice without using those specific terms in its &quot;Six Survival Secrets For Atomic Attacks&quot; section. &quot;1. Try to Get Shielded 2. Drop Flat on Ground or Floor 3. Bury Your Face in Your Arms (&quot;crook of your elbow&quot;)&quot;. The child-oriented film &quot;Duck and Cover&quot; was produced a year later by the Federal Civil Defense Administration in 1951.
 &quot;Duck and cover&quot; exercises quickly became a part of Civil Defense drills that every US citizen, from children to the elderly, was encouraged to practice so that they could be ready in the event of nuclear war.

Education efforts on the effects of nuclear weapons proceeded with stops-and-starts in the US due to competing alternatives. In a once classified, 1950s era, US war game that looked at varying levels of war escalation, warning and pre-emptive attacks in the late 1950s early 1960s, it was estimated that approximately 27 million US citizens would have been saved with civil defense education. At the time however the cost of a full-scale civil defense program was regarded as lesser in effectiveness, in cost-benefit analysis than a ballistic missile defense (Nike Zeus) system, and as the Soviet adversary was believed to be rapidly increasing their nuclear stockpile, the efficacy of both would begin to enter a diminishing returns trend. When more became known about the cost and limitations of the Nike Zeus system, in the early 1960s the head of the department of defense under president John F. Kennedy,
Robert McNamara, determined the ineffectiveness of the Nike-Zeus system, especially in its benefit-cost ratio compared to other options. For instance, fallout shelters would save more Americans for far less money.

==Efficacy during a nuclear explosion==

Within a considerable radius from the surface of the nuclear fireball, 0–3 kilometers—largely depending on the explosion&#x27;s height, yield and position of personnel—ducking and covering would offer negligible protection against the intense heat, blast and prompt ionizing radiation following a nuclear explosion. Beyond that range, however, many lives would be saved by following the simple advice, especially since at that range the main hazard is not from ionizing radiation but from blast injuries and sustaining thermal &quot;flash&quot; burns to unprotected skin. Furthermore, following the bright flash of light of the nuclear fireball, the explosion&#x27;s blast wave would take from first light, 7 to 10 seconds to reach a person standing 3 km from the surface of the nuclear fireball, with the exact time of arrival being dependent on the speed of sound in air in their area. The time delay between the moment of an explosion&#x27;s flash and the arrival of the slower moving blast wave is analogous to the commonly experienced time delay between the observation of a flash of lightning and the arrival of thunder during a lightning storm, thus at the distances that the advice would be most effective, there would be more than ample amounts of time to take the prompt countermeasure of &#x27;duck and cover&#x27; against the blast&#x27;s direct effects and flying debris. For very large explosions it can take 30 seconds or more, after the silent moment of flash, for a potentially dangerous blast wave over-pressure to arrive at, or hit, one&#x27;s position.

The graphs of lethal ranges of weapon effects as a function of yield, that are commonly encountered, are the unobstructed &quot;open air&quot;, or &quot;free air&quot; ranges that assume among other things, a perfectly level target area, no passive shielding such as attenuating effects from urban terrain masking, e.g. skyscraper shadowing, and so on. Therefore, they are thus considered to present an overestimate of the lethal ranges that would be encountered in an urban setting in the real world, with this being most evident following a ground burst with explosive yield similar to first generation nuclear weapons.

To highlight the effect that being indoors, and especially below ground can make, despite the lethal open air radiation, blast and thermal zone extending well past her position at Hiroshima, Akiko Takakura survived the effects of the 16 kt atomic bomb at a distance of 300 meters from ground zero, sustaining only minor injuries, due in greatest part to her position in the lobby of the Bank of Japan, a reinforced concrete building, at the time of the nuclear explosion, and to highlight the protection conferred to an individual who is below ground during a nuclear air burst, Eizo Nomura survived the same blast at Hiroshima at a distance of 170 meters from ground zero. Nomura, who was in the basement of what is now known as the &quot;rest house&quot;, also a reinforced concrete building, lived into his early 80s.

In contrast to these cases of survival, the unknown person sitting outside on the steps of the Sumitomo Bank next door to the Bank of Hiroshima on the morning of the bombing—and therefore fully exposed—suffered what would have eventually been lethal third- to fourth-degree burns from the near instant nuclear weapon &quot;flash&quot; if they had not been killed by the slower moving blast wave when it reached them approximately one second later.

===Blast effects===

====Outdoors====
To elucidate the effects on lying flat on the ground in attenuating a weapons blast, Miyoko Matsubara, one of the Hiroshima maidens, when recounting the bombing in an interview in 1999, said that she was outdoors and &quot;less than 1 mile&quot; from the hypocenter of the Little Boy bomb. Upon observing the nuclear weapons silent flash she quickly lay flat on the ground, while those who were standing directly next to her, and her other fellow students, had simply disappeared from her sight when the blast wave arrived and blew them away.

Position of the body can have a considerable influence in protection from blast effects. Lying prone on the ground will often materially lessen direct blast effects because of the protective defilade effects of irregularities in the ground surface. Ground also tends to deflect some of the blast forces upward. Standing close to a wall, even on the side from which the blast is coming, also lessens some of the effect. Orientation of the body also affects severity of the effect of blast. Anterior exposure of the body may result in lung injury, lateral position may result in more damage to one ear than the other, while minimal effects are to be anticipated with the posterior surface of the body (feet) toward the source of the blast.

The human body is more resistant to sheer overpressure than most buildings, however, the powerful winds produced by this overpressure, as in a hurricane, are capable of throwing human bodies into objects or throwing debris at high velocity, both with lethal results, rendering casualties highly dependent on surroundings. For example, Sumiteru Taniguchi recounts that, while clinging to the tremoring road surface after the Fat Man detonation, he witnessed another child being blown away, the destruction of buildings around him and stones flying through the air. Similarly, Akihiro Takahashi and his classmates were blown by the blast of Little Boy by a distance of about 10 meters, having survived due to not colliding with any walls etc. during his flight through the air. Likewise, Katsuichi Hosoya had a near identical testimony.

====Indoors====
During the 2013 Chelyabinsk meteor explosion, a fourth-grade teacher in Chelyabinsk, Yulia Karbysheva, saved 44 children from potentially life-threatening ballistic window glass cuts by ordering them to hide under their desks when she saw the flash. Despite not knowing the origin of the intense flash of light, she ordered her students to execute a duck and cover drill. Ms. Karbysheva, who herself did not duck and cover but remained standing, was seriously lacerated when the explosion&#x27;s blast wave arrived, and window glass blew in, severing a tendon in one of her arms; however, not one of her students, who she ordered to hide under their desks, suffered a cut. A follow-up study of the effects of the meteor airburst determined that the windows most prone to breaking when exposed to a blast overpressure are those of school buildings, which tend to be large in area.

While the bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki demonstrated that the urban area of glass breakage is nearly 16 times greater than the area of significant structural/building damage, although improved building codes since then may contribute to better building survival, there would be a higher likelihood of glass breakage and therefore potential injury/death for people near windows because many modern buildings have larger windows.

===Flash &amp; burn injuries===

The advice to &quot;cover&quot; one&#x27;s exposed skin with anything that can cast a shadow, like the picnic blanket and newspaper used by the family in the film, may seem absurd at first when one considers the capabilities of a nuclear weapon. However, even the thinnest of barriers such as cloth or plant leaves would reduce the severity of burns on the skin from the thermal radiation with the &quot;flash&quot; light, similar in average emission spectrum/color to sunlight. The thermal radiation emits in the ultraviolet, visible light, and infrared range but with a higher light intensity than sunlight, and this combination of light rays is capable of delivering radiant burning energy to exposed skin areas. As the time-to-rise at peak and total duration of the emittance pulse of this burning thermal radiation is both prolonged and increases with larger explosive yield, it is usually at least a few seconds long for all high yield stockpiled weapons, creating the potential for protective countermeasures.

High importance is given to closing eyelids and covering the eyes as temporary or permanent flash blindness is a risk potential without this covering, especially at night.

A photograph taken about 1.3 km from the hypocenter of the Hiroshima bomb explosion showed that the shadowing effect of leaves from a nearby shrub protected a wooden utilities pole from charring discoloration due to the burst of thermal radiation; the rest of the telephone pole, which was not under the protection of the leaves, was charred almost completely black. The difference in required flash-energy necessary to produce essentially immediate, though transitory, non-propagating flaming, and that required to achieve a continued self-sustained propagating flaming are orders of magnitude in difference for most combustible materials. In the case of untreated timber it is largely dependent on the depth of char. While the propagating fires in both Japanese cities were almost exclusively ignited by the blast wave overturning charcoal cooking-braziers and similar secondary events, thermal flash-fires from untreated fabric and timber in the urban environment is considered potentially the widest destructive effect of the higher yield explosive devices.
The Nevada test site used for testing nuclear devices had a dry desert environment with low humidity, which repeatedly demonstrated the flash-combustion effect during tests. Many investigative films made on location there, such as &quot;The House in the Middle&quot; and others, focused on the combustion of fabrics and clothing.

In the only human accounts at these high luminous intensities that are not of the more common Arc flash accidents, a number of the Hiroshima Maidens survived despite their close proximity to the explosion and in a range where the flash-fire of their customary Japanese summer attire, made of thin kimono cloth, was near instantaneous. As their clothing combusted, some of the Maidens performed an incomplete stop, drop and roll in an effort to extinguish the flames.

===Initial nuclear radiation===

While not designed for those faced with low-yield neutron bombs or for those who are, in general, so close to the nuclear fireball that prompt/initial radiation would be life-threatening in the short-medium term, ducking and covering would nevertheless slightly reduce exposure to the &quot;initial&quot; gamma rays, specifically the portion emitted after the first flash of visible light. The initial gamma rays are defined as those emitted from the fireball &amp; following mushroom cloud which can reach personnel on the ground for a total of approximately 1 minute, at which point the intensity of the radiation has diminished and the atmosphere itself is thick enough to act as full shielding.

As approximately half of these gamma rays are emitted in the first second and the other half, over the following 59 alongside gamma rays being mostly emitted in a straight line, people lying on the ground will more likely have obstacles serving as radiation protection such as building walls, foundations, car engines, etc. between their bodies and the radiation emitted from both the fireball and the accompanying lower levels of radiation that continue to arrive at the ground for about 1 minute, during the mushroom cloud phase, which is termed &quot;cloudshine&quot;. It would also give protection from the even smaller fraction of radiation that changes direction and is randomly reflected and scattered by the air/&quot;skyshine&quot;. Approximately &quot;One and one half inches&quot;/37 mm of steel will reduce gamma dose by half. Its half-value thickness.

The effective gamma ray energy of the cloudshine is not especially high, 200 KeV.

Unlike the relatively low-yield, or low explosive energy &quot;A-bombs&quot; dropped on Hiroshima and Nagasaki, which did result in a sizable proportion of injuries from prompt radiation, higher yield &quot;hydrogen bombs&quot; (thermonuclear weapons) are not expected to result in very many such injuries – as the range at which the ionizing radiation from higher yield devices is of primary concern, is already well inside the hyper-lethal blast and flash burn areas.

===Delayed nuclear radiation, &quot;fallout&quot;===

Apart from the intrinsic &quot;prompt effects&quot; of nuclear detonations, that of thermal flash, blast and initial radiation releases, if any part of the fireball of the nuclear detonation contacts the ground, in what is known as a surface burst, another, comparatively slowly increasing, radiation hazard will also begin to form in the immediate area.

Putting aside the possibility of the detonation occurring during an already established heavy rain-storm, the formation of this life-threatening &quot;delayed nuclear radiation&quot; manifests only when the altitude, or &quot;height of burst&quot; of the explosion, is such that both the fireball and the buoyant updrafts it creates, sufficiently heats and lifts the soil that was below it into the core of the mushroom cloud. Once there, the very hot radioactive isotope products of the nuclear reactions that produced the explosion, begin to coalesce with the cooler and denser soil. Upon cooling, this mixture begins to locally &quot;fall-out&quot; or precipitate-out of the mushroom cloud, falling back to the surface of the earth, near to the point of detonation, over the next few minutes and hours.

While the duck and cover countermeasure, in its most basic form, offers a small to negligible protection against fallout, the technique assumes that after the effects of the blast and initial radiation subside, with the latter of which being no longer a threat after about &quot;twenty seconds&quot; to 1 minute post detonation, a person who ducks and covers will realize when it is wise to cease ducking and covering (after the blast and initial radiation danger has passed) and to then seek out a more sheltered area, like an established or improvised fallout shelter to protect themselves from the ensuing potential local fallout danger, as depicted in the film.

After all, &quot;Duck and Cover&quot; is a first response countermeasure only, in much the same way that &quot;Drop, Cover and Hold On&quot; is during an earthquake, with the advice having served its purpose once the earthquake has passed, and possibly other dangers—like a tsunami or fallout—may be looming, which then require movement to high ground and radiation protection, respectively.

However, if such a shelter is unavailable, the person should then be advised to follow the Shelter in Place protocol, or if given, emergency evacuation advice. Evacuation orders would entail exiting the area completely by following a path perpendicular to the wind direction and therefore perpendicular to the path of the fallout plume. Taking upper atmospheric winds into account, surface winds alone are not to be depended upon as indicative of the direction of fallout movement. &quot;Sheltering in place&quot; is staying indoors, in a preferably sealed tight basement, or internal room, for a number of hours, with the oxygen supply available in such a scenario being more than sufficient for 3+ hours in even the smallest average room, under the assumption that the improvised seal is perfect, until carbon dioxide levels begin to reach unsafe values and necessitate room unsealing for a number of minutes to create a room air change.

In the era the advice was originally given, the most common nuclear weapons were weapons comparable to the US Fat Man and Soviet Joe-1 in yield. The most far-reaching dangers that initially come from the nuclear explosion of this, and higher, yield weapons as airbursts, are the initial flash/heat and blast effects and not from fallout. This is due to the fact that when nuclear weapons are detonated to maximize the range of building destruction, that is, maximize the range of surface blast damage, an airburst is the preferred nuclear fuzing height, as it exploits the mach stem phenomenon. This phenomenon of a blast wave occurs when the blast reaches the ground and is reflected. Below a certain reflection angle the reflected wave and the incident wave merge and form a reinforced horizontal wave; this is known as the &#x27;Mach stem&#x27; (named after Ernst Mach) and is a form of constructive interference and consequently extends the range of high pressure. Air-burst fuzing also increases the range that people&#x27;s skin will have a line-of-sight with the nuclear fireball. However, as a result of the high altitude of the explosion, most of the radioactive bomb debris is dispersed into the stratosphere, with a great column of air therefore placed between the vast majority of the bomb debris/fission reaction products and people on the ground for a number of crucial days before it falls out of the atmosphere in a comparatively dilute fashion. This &quot;delayed fallout&quot; is henceforth not an immediate concern to those near the blast. On the other hand, the only time that fallout is rapidly concentrated in a potentially lethal fashion in the local/regional area around the explosion is when the nuclear fireball makes contact with the ground surface, with an explosion that does so, being aptly termed a surface burst. For example, in the Operation Crossroads tests of 1946 on Bikini Atoll, using two explosive devices of the same design and yield, the first, Test Able (an air burst) had little local fallout, but the infamous Test Baker (a near surface shallow underwater burst) left the local test targets badly contaminated with radioactive fallout.

Widespread radioactive fallout itself was not recognized as a threat among the public at large before 1954, until the widely publicized story of the 15-megaton surface burst of the experimental test shot Castle Bravo on the Marshall Islands. The explosive yield of the Castle Bravo device &quot;the Shrimp&quot; was unexpectedly high and therefore correspondingly higher amounts of local fallout were produced. When this arrived at their location carried by the wind, this caused the 23 crew members on a Japanese fishing boat known as the Lucky Dragon to come down with acute radiation sickness with varying degrees of seriousness and due to complications in the treatment of the ship&#x27;s radio operator months after the exposure, resulted in his death.

It is, however, unlikely that a well-funded belligerent with nuclear weapons would waste their weapons with fuzing to explode below or on the surface, as both test shot Baker and Castle Bravo were respectively. Instead, to maximize the range of city blast destruction and immediate death, an air burst is preferred, as the ≈500 meter explosion heights of the only nuclear weapons used on cities, Little Boy and Fat Man also attest to. Moreover, with air bursts the total amount of radiation contained in the fallout, in units of activity/becquerel, is somewhat less than the total that would be released from a surface or subsurface burst, as in comparison, depending on the height of burst, little to no neutron activation or neutron induced gamma activity of soil occurs from air bursts.
Therefore, the initial danger from concentrated local/&#x27;early&#x27; fallout (which takes on the color of the soil around the fireball, commonly with a dusty pumice or ash-like appearance, as experienced by the crew of the Lucky Dragon) remains low in a global nuclear war scenario. Instead the fallout most likely to be encountered by most survivors in this scenario is expected to be the less dangerous but widely spread global/&#x27;late&#x27; fallout. An air burst at optimum height will produce a negligible amount of early fallout.

A notable comparison to underline this is found when one compares the 50 megaton air-burst Tsar Bomba, which produced no concentrated local/early fallout and thus no known deaths from radiation, with the surface burst of the 15 megaton Castle Bravo, which in comparison, due to the local fallout produced, was implicated in the death of 1 of 23 crew on the Lucky Dragon and made the entire Bikini Atoll unfit for further nuclear testing until enough time elapsed and the intensity of the radiation field had decayed to acceptable levels.
Furthermore, regardless of if a nuclear attack on a city is of the surface or air-burst variety or a mixture of both, the advice to shelter in place, in the interior of well-built homes, or if available, fallout shelters, as suggested in the film &quot;Duck and Cover&quot;, will drastically reduce one&#x27;s chance of absorbing a hazardous dose of radiation. A real-world example of this occurred after the Castle Bravo test where, in contrast to the crew of the Lucky Dragon, the firing crew that triggered the explosion safely sheltered in their firing station until after a number of hours had passed and the radiation levels outside fell to dose rate levels safe enough for an evacuation to be considered. The comparative safety experienced by the Castle Bravo firing crew served as a proof of concept to civil defense personnel that shelter in place (or &quot;buttoning up&quot; as it was known then) is an effective strategy in mitigating the potentially serious health effects of local fallout.

The minimum typical protection factor of the fallout shelters in US cities is 40 or more. In many cases these shelters are nothing more than the interior of pre-existing well-built buildings that have been inspected, and following their protection factors being calculated, re-purposed as fallout shelters.

A protection factor of at least 40 means that the radiation shielding provided by the shelter reduces the radiation dose experienced by at least 40 times that which would be experienced outside the shelter with no shielding. &quot;Protection factor&quot; is equivalent to the modern term &quot;dose reduction factor&quot;.

During the first hour after a nuclear explosion, radioactivity levels drop precipitously. Radioactivity levels are further reduced by about 90% after another 7 hours and by about 99% after 2 days. An accurate rule of thumb, applicable in the time-period of days to a few weeks post-detonation which approximates the radioactive dose rate generated by the decay of the myriad of isotopes present in nuclear fallout, is the &quot;7/10 rule&quot;. The rule states that for each 7-fold increase in time the dose rate drops by a factor of 10. For example, assuming the fallout process has ended 24 hours post detonation and the dose rate would be lethal if a few hours of exposure occurred, 50 roentgens per hour, then 7 days after detonation the dose rate will be 5 R/hr and 49 days after detonation (7×7 days) the dose rate will be 0.5 R/hr at which point no special precautions would need to be taken and venturing outside into that dose rate for an hour or two would pose a close to negligible health hazard, thus permitting an evacuation to be done with acceptable safety to a known contamination free zone. Following a surface-burst nuclear detonation, approximately 80 percent of the fallout would be deposited on the ground during the first 24 hours.

Some agencies that promoted &quot;evacuate immediately&quot; guidance as a response to potentially lethal fallout arriving, advice which may have been influenced by these agencies assuming simplistic single wind-driven cigar/Gaussian shaped fallout contours would be representative of reality, have since retracted this advice. This can actually result in higher radiation exposures as it would put people outdoors and in harm&#x27;s way when the radiation levels would be highest. The Modeling and Analysis Coordination Working Group (MACWG) – which was set up to resolve conflicting advice given by various agencies, has reaffirmed that the best blanket advice that would reduce the number of casualties by the greatest amount is: &quot;Early, adequate sheltering followed by informed, delayed evacuation.&quot;

Expert advice published in the 2010 document &quot;Planning Guidance for Response to a Nuclear Detonation&quot; is to shelter in place, in an area away from building fires, for at least 1 to 2 hours following a nuclear detonation and fallout arriving, and the greatest benefit, assuming personnel are in a building with a high protection factor, is sheltering for no less than 12 to 24 hours before evacuation. Therefore, sheltering for the first few hours can save lives. Indeed, death and injury from local fallout is regarded by experts as the most preventable of all the effects of a nuclear detonation, being simply dependent on if personnel know how to identify an adequate shelter when they see one and enter one quickly, with the number of potential people saved being cited as in the hundreds of thousands. Or even higher if the remaining occupants of the city are made aware of the contaminated areas, by emergency systems, within hours of the event&#x27;s aftermath. In 2009 to 2013 a further iteration on sheltering-in-place was made to determine the optimal improvised fallout-shelter-residence-times following a nuclear detonation, with computer analysis, and including a summary of prior studies and guidance. It was found that individuals should quickly get into the best intact building at least under 5 minutes distant in travel time following the detonation and they should stay there for at least 30 minutes before venturing out to find a shelter with a higher protection factor but that is a greater travel time away than 10 minutes. However, although this would be effective in cases where the initial building protection factor is less than about 10, it requires a high degree of individual situational awareness that may be optimistic to assume following the shock of a nuclear detonation. If a building with a PF of 20 or more is nearby, such as the fallout shelters depicted in the film, in the vast majority of fallout circumstances, it would not be advisable to leave it until 3+ hours have elapsed following the initial arrival of the local fallout.

Following a single IND (improvised nuclear device) detonation in the US, the National Atmospheric Release Advisory Center (NARAC) would, within minutes to at most hours, after the detonation have a reliable prediction of the fallout plume size and direction. When armed with this prediction they would then begin attempting to corroborate this with readings from radiation survey meter equipment that would fly over close to the ground in the affected area by means of helicopter or drone (UAV) aircraft on material intelligence gathering missions, which would also follow within tens of minutes to at most hours after the detonation.

Once a general outline and direction of the fallout is determined, disseminating this information to citizens sheltering-in-place would soon follow, by means of loudspeaker, radio, cell phone etc., with a &quot;Fallout App&quot; containing maps for smart phones being regarded as an area of interest so that survivors do not inadvertently evacuate downwind further into harm&#x27;s way. A number of questions the affected public are likely to have after a nuclear detonation have been compiled and pre-answered to help communications in the immediate aftermath.

===Nuclear electromagnetic pulse, non-lethal===

In respect to the other non-lethal weapon effects from an IND detonated on or near the surface, the detonation&#x27;s blast wave would likely produce a momentary electric grid blackout due to the loss of a large portion of a city&#x27;s electrical equipment drawing power/electrical load, while the electromagnetic pulse (EMP) from a surface/ground-burst explosion would cause little damage outside the blast area, so cell phone towers that survive the blast should be capable of carrying communications. But if communications during the 9/11 attacks or after a major hurricane are anything to go by and the cell phone network towers survive, the service would be overloaded (a mass call event) and thereby made useless soon after; however, if prior arrangements between the cell network and emergency responders are made to give them priority and bar access to all other individuals, then it may be an effective service.

The Civil Defense (CD) shelters, as depicted in the film, were stocked for such an eventuality. They contained among other things, at least one ruggedized CDV-715 radiation survey meter and one CD emergency radio receiver which would respectively be used to facilitate a safe delayed evacuation, regardless of outside help though if communications continued, the radio receiver was to inform them of the outside situation as it developed.

== Long-term survival ==

The dubious assumption that &quot;only the cockroaches&quot; would survive the post-war fallout environment was frequently used in an attempt to criticize &quot;Duck and Cover&quot; during the height of the Cold War, contextually at a time when discussion of a total war involved the much greater US-Soviet arsenal of nuclear weapons that were then in existence. However even at that time, this assumption was shown to be misled, as scientifically detailed in areas including the 1988 book &quot;Would the Insects Inherit the Earth and Other Subjects of Concern to Those Who Worry About Nuclear War&quot;.

In material terms, the primary life-threatening risk survivors and downwinders could face in the long-term after a nuclear explosion or war, is the &quot;nuclear famine&quot; issue, the potential continuation of hostilities by conventional warfare and radioactive contamination of the food and water supplies, disrupting the normal distribution and consumption, of these vital goods.

Cold War continuity of government planners and civil defense organizations in general have always had this disruption, or &quot;nuclear famine&quot; issue in mind, as widespread infrastructure destruction producing starvation conditions was also seen during and after WWII. Papers such as &quot;On Reorganizing After Nuclear Attack&quot;, and &quot;Survival of the relocated population of the U.S. after a nuclear attack&quot; by Nobel Prize winner, Eugene Wigner, detail the thought and attention that went into long-term survival, relocation and reconstruction.

Numerous human and agricultural decontamination countermeasures exist for the two most persistent and biologically significant isotopes, cesium-137, strontium-90 and long-lived fallout contamination in general, with the most visible and immediate act that will prevent a potentially large dose to the public, taking the form of using shielded bulldozers to skim off the layer of topsoil that the fallout had settled on, a restorative practice that was fielded upon the creation of Lake Chagan. The creation of human decontamination tents at the entrances of buildings and when lower levels of risk exist, the use of clean room air showers as a form of contamination control to prevent the spread of radionuclides that adhere to dust, into building interiors, would also be advisable to reduce the elevated risk of radiation induced cancer that would otherwise occur. Air showers may be paired with electrostatic precipitators to attract the dust to collection plates, forestalling a re-suspension that may otherwise be inhaled. Moreover use of the open access radioecology research on decontamination and conventional agriculture in the Chernobyl-Polesie State Radioecological Reserve and around the Fukushima accident, would both be implemented in the event of any widespread fallout contamination, with particular emphasis on bioremediation of radionuclides from soil and aquifers. Although less of a hazard than external exposure, internal decontamination, that may be required after assessment in a whole-body counting session, in the long term may, as is now, be conducted with binding-and-excretion promoting chelation therapy, with ammonium-ferric-hexacyano-ferrate (AFCF)/&quot;Giese salt&quot;, Radiogardase and DPTA all proven effective.

Comparable binding/chelation treatment systems, developed and deployed due to the Fukushima reactor-water decontamination mandate, includes the mobile reverse osmosis &quot;Landysh&quot; water treatment ship, the zeolite-rock based &quot;Actiflo&quot;, the &quot;SARRY&quot; ion exchange cesium removal system, based on silicotitanate &quot;IONSIV&quot; crystalline rock, and most recently the 62 multi-nuclide removal system (NURES), frequently referred to as the Advanced Liquid Processing System (ALPS). In 2016 tritiated water also began to be filtered.

Researchers at the American Chemical Society have further suggested that aquaponics would be an ideal socially-acceptable solution in the post-contamination environment, as it does not use soil to grow fish and vegetables, thus completely alleviating the radiophobia surrounding food that always follows long-lived contamination incidents. Others who have approached the food problem from a far more extreme view, assuming far worse events such as comet impacts (as discussed in the book &quot;Feeding Everyone No Matter What&quot;) have suggested: natural-gas-digesting bacteria, the most well known being methylococcus capsulatus, which is presently used as a feed in fish farming; bark bread, a long-standing famine food using the edible inner bark of trees (once a part of Scandinavian history during the Little Ice Age); and the expansion of leaf protein concentrate and larger scale wood digesting fungiculture for fungal protein, with the most common of which being shiitake mushrooms and honey fungi, as they do not need sunlight or soil to grow. More advanced techniques mentioned, which are not presently economical, also include variations of wood or cellulosic biofuel production (which typically already creates edible sugars/xylitol from inedible cellulose) as an intermediate product before the final step of alcohol generation.

==Historical and psychological assessment==
Some historians and documentaries, including science historian Melissa Smith in a 2010 article for &quot;The British Journal for the History of Science&quot; and the film 1982 &quot;The Atomic Cafe&quot;, have described &quot;duck and cover&quot; advice as propaganda.

In U.S. Army training, soldiers are taught to immediately fall down, covering face and hands in much the same way as is described by the advice to duck and cover.

The exercises of Cold War civil defense were described by historian Guy Oakes in 1994 as having less practical use than psychological use: to keep the danger of nuclear war high on the public mind, while also attempting to assure the American people that something could be done to defend against nuclear attack.

==Tornadoes==
Ducking and covering does have certain applications in other, more natural disasters. In states prone to tornadoes, school children are urged to &quot;duck and cover&quot; against a solid inner wall of a school, if time does not permit seeking better shelter—such as a storm cellar—during a tornado warning. The tactic is also widely practiced in schools in states along the West Coast of the United States, where earthquakes are commonplace. Ducking and covering in either scenario would theoretically afford significant protection from falling or flying debris.

==Earthquakes==

In an earthquake, which are generally of a natural tectonic plate origin (although they can be artificially generated by the detonation of a nuclear explosive device in which sufficient energy is transmitted into the ground, with an extreme case to serve as an example of this phenomenon being the Operation Grommet &quot;Cannikin&quot; test of the 5 megaton W71 warhead exploded deep underground on Amchitka Island in 1971, which produced a seismic shock quake of 7.0 on the Richter magnitude scale) people are encouraged, regardless of the cause of the quake, to &quot;drop, cover and hold on&quot;: to get underneath a piece of furniture, cover their heads and hold on to the furniture. This advice also encourages people not to run out of a shaking building, because a large majority of earthquake injuries are due to broken bones from people falling and tripping during shaking. While it is unlikely that &quot;drop, cover and hold on&quot; will protect against a building collapse, in earthquake-prone areas in the United States building codes require that buildings withstand quakes up to an expected magnitude enough to allow evacuation after shaking stops. and thus a building collapse of these structures (even during an earthquake) is rare. &quot;Drop, cover and hold on&quot; may not be appropriate for all locations or building types, but the Red Cross advises it is the appropriate emergency response to an earthquake in the United States.

<text>The Quick Professorship of Biology is one of the senior professorships in biology at the University of Cambridge.

Frederick James Quick (1836–1902), a prosperous coffee merchant and senior partner in the London coffee-firm &quot;Quick, Reek and James&quot; at the time of his death, bequeathed the majority of his wealth to the University of Cambridge (where he had been a student at Trinity Hall, graduating in 1859) to be used in the &#x27;study of vegetable and animal biology&#x27;. After much debate, it was decided that a new professorship should be established which would primarily cover the field of protozoology, and in 1906 George Nuttall became the first holder of the chair. 

From 1907 to 1921 there was a laboratory associated with the chair, known as the Quick Laboratory: it was a single room, divided into cubicles, on the ground floor of the Cambridge Medical School building. In 1919, after an appeal for funds by the Quick Professor, the Molteno Institute of Parasitology was established. In 1920 the scope of the chair was broadened to the study of parasitology. In 1931 the chair was offered to David Keilin for study of cell biology.

<doc id="833042" wikidata="Q388093" url="?curid=833042" title="Culloden (film)">
<text>Culloden (known as The Battle of Culloden in the U.S.) is a 1964 docudrama written and directed by Peter Watkins for BBC TV. It depicts the 1746 Battle of Culloden, the final engagement of the Jacobite rising of 1745 which saw the Jacobite Army be decisively defeated by government troops and in the words of the narrator &quot;tore apart forever the clan system of the Scottish Highlands.&quot; Described in its opening credits as &quot;an account of one of the most mishandled and brutal battles ever fought in Britain,&quot; &quot;Culloden&quot; was hailed as a breakthrough for its presentation of a historical event in the style of modern TV war reporting, as well as its use of non-professional actors. The film was based on John Prebble&#x27;s study of the battle.

==Production==
&quot;Culloden&quot; was Watkins&#x27;s first full-length film. It was also his first use of his docudrama style in which actors portray historical characters being interviewed by filmmakers on the scene as though it were happening in front of news cameras. The film was produced on a low budget, with only a handful of extras and a single cannon. Watkins made use of carefully planned camera angles to give the appearance of an army.

Watkins also &quot;wanted to break through the conventional use of professional actors in historical melodramas, with the comfortable avoidance of reality that these provide, and to use amateurs—ordinary people—in a reconstruction of their own history.&quot; He accordingly used an all-amateur cast from London and the Scottish Lowlands for the Hanoverian forces, and people from Inverness for the Jacobite army. This later became a central technique of Watkins&#x27;s filmmaking.

According to an estimate by the cinematographer for the film, Dick Bush, about 85% of all camerawork in Culloden was hand-held. This &quot;cinéma vérité&quot;-style shooting gave an already gritty reality a sense of present action. Culloden looked like a documentary of an event that occurred long before the film camera was invented.

==Reception==
&quot;Culloden&quot; won in 1965 both a Society of Film and Television Arts (BAFTA) TV Award for Specialised Programmes and the British Screenwriters&#x27; Award of Merit. In a list of the 100 Greatest British Television Programmes drawn up by the British Film Institute in 2000, voted for by industry professionals, &quot;Culloden&quot; was placed 64th. Writing for Eye for Film, Amber Wilkinson praised &quot;Culloden&quot;, commenting that &quot;the mastery of [Watkins&#x27;s] direction is obvious from first to last&quot;.

<text>The Arthur Balfour Professorship of Genetics is the senior professorship in genetics at the University of Cambridge, founded in 1912. It is thought to be the oldest Chair of Genetics in the English speaking world.

The chair was endowed by Reginald Baliol Brett, 2nd Viscount Esher, according to whom the money (£20,000) was &quot;placed in [his] hands&quot; by an anonymous benefactor. A condition of the endowment was that the first appointee to the chair would be chosen jointly by the Prime Minister H. H. Asquith and the former Prime Minister Arthur Balfour.

<text>The United States Senate Committee on Energy and Natural Resources is a standing committee of the United States Senate. It has jurisdiction over matters related to energy and mineral resources, including nuclear development; irrigation and reclamation, territorial possessions of the United States, trust lands appertaining to America&#x27;s indigenous peoples, and the conservation, use, and disposition of federal lands. Its roots go back to the Committee on Interior and Insulars Affairs. In 1977, it became the Committee on Energy and Natural Resources, and most matters regarding Native Americans, Alaska Natives, and Native Hawaiians were removed from its jurisdiction and transferred to the Committee on Indian Affairs.

==History==
The Committee on Public Lands was created in 1816 during the 14th Congress chaired by senator Jeremiah Morrow. In its early years, it managed the settlement of the recently purchased Missouri Territory. Over time, the committee oversaw the western expansion of the United States, including the Texas annexation, the Oregon Treaty, the Mexican Cession, and the Gadsden Purchase. The Homestead Act of 1860, which would have benefited western settlers and migrants, was a result of jurisdiction of the Public Lands Committee.

In 1849, the Department of the Interior was established, with the Public Lands Committee serving as legislative oversight. The committee became responsible for enacting legislation to conserve nature and its resources. Due to the actions of the committee, Congress began working towards preservation of forests, wilderness, and historical landmarks with the signing of the Antiquities Act in 1906 and the establishment of the National Park Service in 1916.

The committee has gone under a number of name changes, but the functions and policy have remained similar to its creation. In 1921, the committee merged with the Committee on Geological Surveys to become the Committee of Public Lands and Surveys. Following the Legislative Reorganization Act of 1946, it became the Committee on Interior and Insular Affairs, absorbing the jurisdiction of the Indian Affairs, Territorial and Insular Affairs, Mines and Mining, and Irrigation and Reclamation committees. Its most recent iteration, the Committee on Energy and Natural Resources, was established on February 4, 1977, after the Committee System Reorganization Amendments of 1977.

==Jurisdiction==
In accordance of Rule XXV of the United States Senate, all proposed legislation, messages, petitions, memorials, and other matters relating to the following subjects is referred to the Senate Committee on Energy and Natural Resources:
# Coal production, distribution, and utilization;
# Energy policy;
# Energy regulation and conservation;
# Energy related aspects of deepwater ports;
# Energy research and development;
# Extraction of minerals from oceans and Outer Continental Shelf lands;
# Hydroelectric power, irrigation, and reclamation;
# Mining education and research;
# Mining, mineral lands, mining claims, and mineral conservation;
# National parks, recreation areas, wilderness areas, wild and scenic rivers, historical sites, military parks and battlefields, and on the public domain, preservation of prehistoric ruins and objects of interest;
# National Petroleum Reserve;
# Nonmilitary development of nuclear energy;
# Oil and gas production and distribution;
# Public lands and forests, including farming and grazing thereon, and mineral extraction therefrom;
# Solar energy systems; and,
# Territorial possessions of the United States, including trusteeships.
The Committee is also charged to &quot;study and review, on a comprehensive basis, matters relating to energy and resources development, and report thereon from time to time.&quot;

<text>Jaroslav Rudiš (born 8 June 1972 in Turnov) is a Czech writer, journalist and musician.

Rudiš became known after publishing his first novel &quot;Nebe pod Berlínem&quot; (&quot;The Sky under Berlin&quot;) in 2002, the tale of a Czech teacher who chooses to leave his job and to start a new life in Berlin, where he plays music in the underground, which – along with the ghosts of suicide jumpers – gains almost mystical importance to him, and joins an indie rock group (which is a semi-autobiographical motive). It was one of the most successful Czech books of recent years. For this novel he received Jiří Orten Award.

His collaboration with draughtsman Jaromír 99 led to the publication of three closely connected graphic novels taking place among railway employees, Bílý potok (&quot;White Brook&quot;, 2003), Hlavní nádraží (&quot;Central Station&quot;, 2004) and Zlaté hory (&quot;Golden Hills&quot;). The trilogy has been adapted into an animated feature film, &quot;Alois Nebel&quot;, which was released in 2011.

<text>William Dudley Pelley (March 12, 1890 – June 30, 1965) was an American fascist activist, journalist, writer and occultist, noted for his support of German dictator Adolf Hitler during the Great Depression and the Second World War.

Pelley came to prominence as a writer, winning two O. Henry Awards and penning screenplays for Hollywood films. His 1929 essay &quot;Seven Minutes in Eternity&quot; marked a turning point in his career, published in &quot;The American Magazine&quot; as a popular example of what would later be called a near-death experience. His antisemitism led him to found the Silver Legion of America in 1933, a fascist paramilitary league. He ran for president of the United States in 1936 as the candidate for the Christian Party.

In 1942, Pelley was prosecuted by the U.S. government for sedition and seditious conspiracy for conspiring to cause insubordination in the military and obstruct recruitment. He was found guilty and sentenced to 15 years in federal prison. Pelley was released on parole in February 1950. As a condition of his parole, he was forced to cease his political activities.

Upon his death in 1965, &quot;The New York Times&quot; assessed Pelley as &quot;an agitator without a significant following.&quot;

==Early life==
Born in Lynn, Massachusetts, William Dudley Pelley grew up in poverty, the son of William George Apsey Pelley and his wife, Grace (née Goodale). His father was initially a Southern Methodist Church minister, and was later a small businessman and shoemaker. His father also converted to the Jehovah&#x27;s Witness movement towards the end of his life.

==Early career==
Largely self-educated, Pelley became a journalist and gained respect for his writing skills; his articles eventually appeared in national publications such as &quot;The Chicago Tribune&quot;. Two of his short stories received O. Henry awards: &quot;The Face in the Window&quot; in 1920 and &quot;The Continental Angle&quot; in 1930. He was hired by the Methodist Centenary to study Methodist missions around the world. He joined the Red Cross in Siberia, where he helped the White Russians during the Russian Civil War. Pelley&#x27;s opposition to Communism grew, and he began to subscribe to the conspiracy theory of Jewish Communism. Upon returning to the United States in 1920, Pelley wrote novels in addition to his journalism. In the 1920s, his short stories frequently appeared in pulp magazines like &quot;Adventure&quot; and &quot;Short Stories&quot;, and mainstream journals like &quot;The American Magazine&quot; and &quot;The Red Book&quot;. He went to Hollywood, where he became a screenwriter, writing the Lon Chaney films &quot;The Light in the Dark&quot; (1922) and &quot;The Shock&quot; (1923). Pelley became disillusioned with the film industry. What he regarded as unfair treatment by Jewish studio executives increased his antisemitic inclinations. He moved to New York, and then to Asheville, North Carolina, in 1932, and began publishing magazines and essays detailing his new religious system, the &quot;Liberation Doctrine&quot;.

==Occultism==
In May 1928, Pelley gained notoriety when he claimed he had three out-of-body experiences in which he traveled to other planes of existence devoid of corporeal souls. The first took place while alone in a cabin in Altadena, California. He described this experience in the article &quot;My Seven Minutes in Eternity&quot; (&quot;Mind, Inc.&quot;, May 1929), published in book form in 1933 as &quot;Seven Minutes in Eternity: With the Aftermath&quot;. In later writings, he described the experience as &quot;hypo-dimensional&quot;.

The second took place while he was at home in California reading a Ralph Waldo Emerson essay. The third took place in New Mexico, while he was alone in a train car—again reading Emerson. He wrote that during the last event, he met with God and Jesus, who instructed him to undertake the spiritual transformation of America.

He later claimed that the experiences gave him the ability to levitate, see through walls, and have out-of-body experiences at will. He also said that they removed his desire for alcohol, tobacco, and caffeine, as well as curing physical ailments such as indigestion.

His metaphysical writings greatly boosted his public visibility. Some of the early members of the original Ascended Master Teachings religion, the &quot;I AM&quot; Activity, were recruited from the ranks of Pelley&#x27;s organization, the Silver Legion of America. Pelley&#x27;s religious system was a mixture of theosophy, spiritualism, Rosicrucianism, and pyramidism. He considered it to be a perfected form of Christianity, in which &quot;Dark Souls&quot; (Jews, Communists and Papists) represented the forces of evil.

==Political activism==
When the Great Depression struck America in 1929, Pelley became active in politics. After moving to Asheville, Pelley founded Galahad College in 1932. The college specialized in correspondence courses on &quot;Social Metaphysics&quot; and &quot;Christian Economics&quot;. He also founded Galahad Press, which he used to publish various political and metaphysical magazines, newspapers, and books – many of which Pelley had written, claiming to have transcribed them from souls in another dimension. The publishing house and college both failed within a year.

On January 30, 1933, Adolf Hitler became chancellor of Germany. Pelley, an admirer of Hitler, founded the Silver Legion, an antisemitic organization whose members, known as Silver Shirts and Christian Patriots, wore Nazi-style silver uniform shirts. Their insignia was a scarlet &quot;L&quot;, emblazoned on their flags and uniforms. They also wore blue neckties, blue corduroy trousers, and puttees. Pelley preferred to be called &quot;Chief&quot; of the Silver Shirts. Biographer Scott Beekman noted that Pelley was &quot;one of the first Americans to create an organization celebrating the work of Adolf Hitler.&quot;

Pelley traveled throughout the United States, holding recruitment rallies, lectures, and public speeches. He founded Silver Legion chapters in almost every state in the country. Membership peaked at 15,000 in 1935, dropping to below 5,000 by 1938. His political ideology consisted of anti-Communism, antisemitism, patriotism, corporatism, isolationism, and British Israelism, themes which were the primary focus of his numerous magazines and newspapers which included &quot;Liberation&quot;, &quot;Pelley&#x27;s Silvershirt Weekly&quot;, &quot;The Galilean,&quot; &quot;Silver Legion Ranger&quot;, and &quot;The New Liberator&quot;. In his landmark book &quot;No More Hunger&quot;, William Pelley called for radically populist economic policies, such as a universal income of $1,000 a year (over $24,000 in 1933) for White citizens, a ban on inheritance except for family homes, or limiting wages to $100,000 a year. He called for African Americans to be re-enslaved and Jews to be ghettoized and sterilized.

Pelley became fairly well known as the 1930s went on. Sinclair Lewis mentioned him by name in his novel &quot;It Can&#x27;t Happen Here&quot; (1935) about a fascist takeover in the United States. Pelley is praised by the leader of the fictional movement as an important precursor.

Pelley opposed Franklin Delano Roosevelt and the New Deal, claiming that he was part of a Jewish plot to control the U.S. government. Pelley founded the Christian Party in 1935, and ran an unsuccessful campaign as candidate for president in 1936, winning only 1,600 votes. He spoke often of protecting the U.S. Constitution. He also proposed turning the United States into a corporation, with all white Christian citizens as shareholders.

He engaged in a long dispute with the United States House of Representatives&#x27; Dies Committee, predecessor to the House Un-American Activities Committee.

Despite serious financial and material setbacks within his organization which resulted from lengthy court battles, Pelley continued to oppose Roosevelt, especially as diplomatic relations between the United States and the Empire of Japan and Nazi Germany became strained in the early 1940s. Pelley accused Roosevelt of being a and advocated isolationism. Roosevelt enlisted J. Edgar Hoover and the FBI to investigate Pelley. Subsequently, the FBI interviewed subscribers to Pelley&#x27;s newspapers and magazines.

Although the attack on Pearl Harbor in December 1941 led Pelley to disband the Silver Legion, he continued to attack the government in his magazine, &quot;Roll Call&quot;, which alarmed Roosevelt, Attorney General Francis Biddle, and the House Un-American Activities Committee. After stating in one issue of &quot;Roll Call&quot; that the devastation of the Pacific Fleet at Pearl Harbor was worse than the government claimed, Pelley was arrested at his new base of operations in Noblesville, Indiana, and in April 1942, he was charged with 12 counts of sedition. Also charged were his secretary and future wife, Agnes Marion Henderson, his editor, Lawrence A. Brown, and his publishing company, Fellowship Press, Incorporated. One charge against Pelley was dropped, but he was convicted of the other 11 charges, mostly for making seditious statements, obstructing military recruiting, and fomenting insurrection within the military. Henderson and Brown were both acquitted on all counts, save for charge of seditious conspiracy. Fellowship Press was also found guilty. The judge sentenced Pelley to 15 years in prison, Brown to five years in prison, and Henderson to a two-year suspended term. He also imposed a $5,000 fine on Fellowship Press.

After serving eight years, Pelley was paroled in February 1950. While still incarcerated, he was one of 30 defendants in the &quot;Mass Sedition Trial&quot; of Nazi sympathizers which culminated in a mistrial after the death of the judge, Edward C. Eicher, in November 1944.

==Later life==
In his final years, Pelley dealt with charges of securities fraud that had been brought against him while he was living in Asheville.

The terms of Pelley&#x27;s parole stipulated that he remain in central Indiana, and desist from all political activity. He developed an elaborate religious philosophy called &quot;Soulcraft&quot; based on his belief in UFOs and extraterrestrials, and published &quot;Star Guests&quot; in 1950. Pelley died at his home in Noblesville, Indiana, on June 30, 1965. He is buried in Crownland Cemetery, Noblesville.

<doc id="833109" wikidata="Q982314" url="?curid=833109" title="Luiz Gonzaga">
<text>Luiz Gonzaga do Nascimento (standard orthography &#x27;Luís&#x27;; ; December 13, 1912 – August 2, 1989) was a Brazilian singer, songwriter, musician and poet and one of the most influential figures of Brazilian popular music in the twentieth century. He has been credited with having presented the rich universe of Northeastern musical genres to all of Brazil, having popularized the musical genre baião and has been called a &quot;revolutionary&quot; by Antônio Carlos Jobim. According to Caetano Veloso, he was the first significant cultural event with mass appeal in Brazil. Luiz Gonzaga received the Shell prize for Brazilian Popular Music in 1984 and was only the fourth artist to receive this prize after Pixinguinha, Antônio Carlos Jobim and Dorival Caymmi. The Luiz Gonzaga Dam was named in his honor.

Gonzaga&#x27;s son, Luiz Gonzaga do Nascimento Jr, known as Gonzaguinha (1945–1991), was also a noted Brazilian singer and composer.

==Biography==

Son of Januário José dos Santos (1888–1978), a farmer and accordion player, and Anna Batista de Jesus (1893–1960), a housewife, Gonzaga was attracted to the accordion at a very early age, and he used to accompany his father at parties and religious celebrations. He later went to do his military service, where he learned to play the cornet. On leaving the army he decided to remain in Rio de Janeiro, performing in the streets and in bars.

After noticing that the north-eastern people living in Rio de Janeiro missed the music from their home states, he started to give listeners the sort of music they craved to hear: xaxados, baiões, chamegos and cocos. At Ary Barroso&#x27;s talent show, Luiz Gonzaga played his chamego &quot;Vira e Mexe&quot; and was acclaimed by the audience and by the host, who gave him the highest score. After discovering this niche in the market, Gonzaga became a regular at radio shows and started making records.

In 1943, he dressed up in typical north-eastern costumes for the first time to perform live, and got hyped. Later on, as well as playing popular tunes on the accordion, he began to sing his own material, and his skills as a songwriter were revealed. His greatest hit ever, &quot;Asa Branca&quot; (written with Humberto Teixeira), was recorded in 1947 and covered countless times by many artists. He worked on the radio until 1954, enjoying huge popularity. He became (in the words of Caetano Veloso, Caderno de Confessões Brasileiras, 1988) a &quot;pop music&quot; star, taking a genre straight from folklore to the pop music, creating with the combination of accordion, zabumba, and triangle (which became later the basic ensemble for Forró) one of the western world&#x27;s first &quot;small pop music ensembles&quot;, ten years before the popularization of the rock music ensemble by the Beatles.

He is widely recognized for single-handedly taking the baião style and the accordion to a wide audience. RCA (now BMG), his recording label, was almost exclusively dedicated to printing his singles and albums . During the 1960s, as the public taste shifted to bossa nova and iê-iê-iê, he found himself increasingly stranded from big city stages, so he toured the countryside, where his popularity never abated. 

In the 1970s and 1980s, he slowly re-emerged, partly due to covers of his songs by famous artists like Geraldo Vandré, Caetano Veloso, Gilberto Gil, his son Gonzaguinha and Milton Nascimento. Some of his greatest hits are &quot;Vozes da Seca&quot; (&quot;Voices From Drought&quot;), &quot;Algodão&quot; (&quot;Cotton&quot;), &quot;A Dança da Moda&quot; (&quot;The Dance in Fashion&quot;), &quot;ABC do Sertão&quot; (&quot;The ABC of Sertão&quot;), &quot;Derramaro o Gai&quot; (&quot;They Spilt the Gas&quot;), &quot;A Letra I&quot; (&quot;The &#x27;i&#x27; letter&quot;), &quot;Imbalança&quot; (&quot;Shake It&quot;), &quot;A Volta da Asa-Branca&quot; (&quot;The Return of The Picazuro Pigeon&quot;), &quot;Cintura Fina&quot; (&quot;Slender Waist&quot;), &quot;O Xote das Meninas&quot; (&quot;The Girls&#x27; Schottische&quot;, written with Zé Dantas, and &quot;Juazeiro&quot;, &quot;Paraíba&quot;, &quot;Mangaratiba&quot;, &quot;Baião-de-Dois&quot;, &quot;No Meu Pé de Serra&quot; (&quot;There in My Homeland&quot;), &quot;Assum Preto&quot; (&quot;Blue-back Grassquit&quot;), &quot;Légua Tirana&quot; (&quot;Tyrannical league&quot;), &quot;Qui Nem Jiló&quot; (&quot;Like Solanum gilo&quot;, written with Humberto Teixeira. Other successful collaborations resulted in &quot;Tá Bom Demais&quot; (&quot;It&#x27;s So Good&quot;) (with Onildo de Almeida), &quot;Danado de Bom&quot; (&quot;Damn Good&quot;) (with João Silva), &quot;Dezessete e Setecentos&quot; (&quot;Seventeen And Seven hundred&quot;) and &quot;Cortando o Pano&quot; (&quot;Cutting Cloth&quot;) (both with Miguel Lima). 

The surname Gonzaga is an ancient noble surname in Brazil, Portugal and Italy.

Gonzaga died of natural causes in 1989 at the age of 76.

<text>Augusta Theodosia Drane (28 December 1823 – 29 April 1894) was an English writer and Roman Catholic nun. She became a religious writer and a poet.

==Life==
Born at Bromley, now Bromley-by-Bow, then in Middlesex, now in London, she was the youngest daughter of Thomas Drane, an East Indian mercantile executive, and brought up in the Anglican faith. She was taught initially at home and then for two years at a Kensington school. Her father&#x27;s extensive library encouraged her reading and studying habits. The family moved to Babbacombe, Devon, when she was 14.

Drane was influenced by Tractarian teachings and joined the Catholic Church in Tiverton around 1850. In 1852, after a six-month stay in Rome, she joined the third order of St Dominic, to which she belonged for over forty years. She was prioress of the convent in Stone, Staffordshire, where she died aged 70.

==Works==
Drane wrote, and published anonymously, an essay questioning the morality of Tractarianism, which was attributed to John Henry Newman. Her major works in prose and verse are: &quot;The History of Saint Dominic&quot; (1857; enlarged edition, 1891); &quot;The Life of St Catherine of Siena&quot; (1880; 2nd ed., 1899); &quot;Christian Schools and Scholars&quot; (1867); &quot;The Knights of St John&quot; (1858); &quot;Songs in the Night and Other Poems&quot; (1876); and the &quot;Three Chancellors&quot; (1859), a sketch of the lives of William of Wykeham, William of Waynflete and Sir Thomas More.

A complete list of her writings appears in &quot;Memoir of Mother Francis Raphael, O.SD., Augusta Theodosia Drane&quot;, edited by B. Wilberforce, O.P. (London, 1895).

<text>Henry Gabriel Ginaca (May 19, 1876 – October 19, 1918) was an American engineer who invented, at the direction of Hawaii pineapple magnate James Dole, a machine that could peel and core pineapples automatically called the Ginaca machine.

== Biography ==
Ginaca was born on May 19, 1876, in either California or Nevada. His first job was at the San Francisco Union Iron Works. He was later hired by the Honolulu Iron Works. In 1911 he began working for James Dole at the Hawaiian Pineapple Company. After inventing the &quot;Ginaca Machine&quot;, Ginaca and his brothers returned to California in 1914. He died on October 19, 1918, in Hornitos, California, during the Spanish flu epidemic.

== The &quot;Ginaca Machine&quot; ==
Ginaca was hired by James Dole in 1911 to build a machine that could make canning pineapples more efficient. By 1913, Ginaca built a machine that removed the pineapple skin, then cored and sliced the fruit so that it would fit neatly in the can. Cannery workers would then inspect the sliced pineapple to trim away any thing that wouldn&#x27;t fit in a can. The machine greatly increased the number of pineapples that could be cored in one minute from 15 pineapples to 35. A higher speed machine was later invented that could peel and core 100 pineapples per minute. This revolutionized the fruit canning industry by making pineapple Hawaii&#x27;s second-largest crop, after sugarcane.

<doc id="833159" wikidata="Q1056391" url="?curid=833159" title="Head teacher">
<text>A headmaster/headmistress, head teacher, head, school administrator, principal or school director (sometimes another title is used) is the staff member of a school with the greatest responsibility for the management of the school.

==Role==
While some head teachers still do some teaching themselves, in most larger schools, most of their duties are managerial and pastoral. Their duties often include disciplining misbehaving students and helping to organize school-sponsored activities, and teachers report to them. 

In Australia, the head teacher is sometimes in charge of one (in the case of a major subject) or multiple (often in smaller schools) specific departments, such as English, history, maths, science, writing, technology, etc., but maintains full teaching duties and status. They are considered part of the school executive, and often a head teacher position is a stepping-stone into administration.

Rapid demographic changes in the United States have resulted in an increasingly culturally and linguistically diverse Pre K-12 student population, so classroom teachers and principals in the U.S. are not only focusing on instructional issues, but also need to increase educational leadership, cross-cultural leadership, and multicultural education.

==Executive head==
==Deputy head==
==Assistants==
In larger schools, the principal is assisted by one or more &quot;vice-principals&quot;, &quot;assistant principals&quot;, &quot;associate principals&quot;, or &quot;deputy principals&quot;. Their position is secondary to the principal with regard to school governance. Assistant principals generally perform specific duties such as handling student discipline, curriculum, student council or student activities whereas the principal has the ultimate responsibility for the school as a whole (including faculty and staff, physical plant, etc.).

==Regional information==
=== Australia and New Zealand ===
In many Australian and New Zealand schools, a principal is the head administrator of a school who has been appointed to her/his position by the school board, superintendent, or other body. The principal, often in conjunction with the school board, makes the executive decisions that govern the school, as well as having the authority over the employment (and in some cases firing) of teachers. The principal is often the chief disciplinarian of the students.

==Impact of school principals==
While there has been considerable anecdotal discussion about the importance of school principals, there has been very little systematic research into their impact on student outcomes. Recent analysis in the United States has examined how the gains in student achievement at a school change after the principal changes. This outcome-based approach to measuring effectiveness of principals is very similar to the value-added modeling that has been applied to the evaluation of teachers. Such research in the state of Texas found that principals have a very large impact on student achievement. Effective school principals have been shown to significantly improve the performance of all students at the school, at least in part through their impacts on selection and retention of good teachers. Ineffective principals have a similarly large negative effect on school performance, suggesting that issues of evaluation are as important for school administrators as they are for teachers. The impact of principals has also been measured in non-traditional ways. Some principals have focused their efforts on creating more inclusive schools for students with disabilities.

<text>The Serena Professorship of Italian is the senior professorship in the study of Italian language, literature and culture at the University of Cambridge, University of Oxford, University of Manchester and University of Birmingham. At Cambridge, it was founded in 1917 by a donation of £10,000 from Arthur Serena (died 1922), a shipbroker and son of the Venetian patriot Leone Serena. He also endowed the Serena Medal awarded annually by the British Academy for furtherance of the study of Italian history, philosophy, music, literature, art and economics.

==Serena Professors at Birmingham==

* John Woodhouse (1990–2001)
* Martin McLaughlin (2001–2017)

When after Grayson&#x27;s retirement the Serena Chair was ‘frozen’, because of government funding cuts, Gianni Agnelli, head of Fiat, agreed a contribution of £750,000 to ‘unfreeze’ the Oxford Chair. In recognition of this benefaction, the name of the chair at Oxford became the Fiat-Serena Chair of Italian Studies.

In the summer of 2009 there was a further modification in nomenclature when the name changed to the Agnelli-Serena Chair of Italian Studies, a change which reflects more directly the role of the two great benefactors at the beginning and end of the twentieth century.

<doc id="833172" wikidata="Q57236" url="?curid=833172" title="Bettina von Arnim">
<text>Bettina von Arnim (the Countess of Arnim) (4 April 178520 January 1859), born Elisabeth Catharina Ludovica Magdalena Brentano, was a German writer and novelist.

Bettina (or Bettine) Brentano was a writer, publisher, composer, singer, visual artist, an illustrator, patron of young talent, and a social activist. She was the archetype of the Romantic era&#x27;s zeitgeist and the crux of many creative relationships of canonical artistic figures. Best known for the company she kept, she numbered among her closest friends Goethe, Beethoven, Schleiermacher, and Pückler and tried to foster artistic agreement among them. Many leading composers of the time, including Felix and Fanny Mendelssohn, Robert and Clara Schumann, Franz Liszt, Johanna Kinkel, and Johannes Brahms, admired her spirit and talents. As a composer, von Arnim&#x27;s style was unconventional, molding and melding favorite folk melodies and historical themes with innovative harmonies, phrase lengths, and improvisations that became synonymous with the music of the era. She was closely related to the German writers Clemens Brentano and Achim von Arnim: the first was her brother, the second her husband. Her daughter Gisela von Arnim became a prominent writer as well. Her nephews, via her brother Christian, were Franz and Lujo Brentano.

==Family and early life==
Bettina von Arnim was born at Frankfurt am Main, into the large Brentano family of Italian merchants. Her mother Maximiliane Brentano died in 1793 at the age of 37. Her grandmother, Sophie von La Roche, was a novelist, and her brother was Clemens Brentano, the great poet known for his lyric poems, libretti, and Singspiele. He was a mentor and protector to her and inspired her to read the poetry of the time, especially Goethe. From an early age Bettina was called &#x27;the kobold&#x27; by her brothers and sisters, a nickname that she maintained later on in Berlin society.

After being educated at an Ursulines convent school in Fritzlar from 1794 to 1797, Bettina lived for a while with her grandmother at Offenbach am Main and from 1803 to 1806 with her brother-in-law, Friedrich von Savigny, the famous jurist, at Marburg. She formed a friendship with Karoline von Günderrode. The two friends acknowledged only natural impulses, laws, and methods of life, and brooded over the &quot;tyranny&quot; of conventionalities. In 1806, Günderrode committed suicide on account of a passion for the philologist Georg Friedrich Creuzer. In 1807 at Weimar Bettina made the acquaintance of Goethe, for whom she entertained a significant passion, which the poet did not requite, though he entered into correspondence with her. Their friendship came to an abrupt end in 1811, owing to Bettina&#x27;s behaviour with Goethe&#x27;s wife.

In 1810, Bettina visited Vienna, staying at the home of her half-brother Franz Brentano and his wife Antonie. It was at this time she met Beethoven. She later claimed to have been instrumental in arranging the first meeting of Beethoven and Goethe at Teplitz in 1812, and published a letter supposedly written by Beethoven describing how while walking with Goethe, he had refused to step aside for visiting dignitaries while Goethe bowed - an incident that became famous, though the &quot;greatest likelihood is that Bettina made it up&quot;.

In 1811, Bettina married Achim von Arnim, the renowned Romantic poet and member of the notable Arnim family. The couple settled first at the Wiepersdorf castle, and then in Berlin. They had seven children.

Achim died in 1831, but Bettina maintained an active public life. Her passion for Goethe revived, and in 1835, after lengthy discussions with the writer and landscape gardener Hermann von Pückler-Muskau, she published her book &quot;Goethe&#x27;s Correspondence with a Child&quot; (), which purported to be a correspondence between herself and the poet. The book is in large part fictitious. Genuine sonnets of Goethe in it were addressed, not to her, but to Minna Herzlieb. As a work of fiction, the book has been praised.

She continued to write, inspire, and publish until 20 January 1859, when she died in Berlin, aged 73, surrounded by her children. Her grave is in the Wiepersdorf churchyard.

==Career==

During the years of 1806 to 1808, von Arnim helped gather the folk songs that made up Des Knaben Wunderhorn, the collaborative work of her brother and her future husband, Achim von Arnim. Some of the songs were later put to music by a number of composers, among them Gustav Mahler. The collection became a touchstone of the Romantic musical and poetic style. From 1808 to 1809 she studied voice, composition, and piano in Munich under Peter von Winter and Sebastian Bopp. She published her first song under the pseudonym Beans Beor, which she occasionally used later as well. Bettina sang briefly in the Berliner Singakademie and composed settings of Hellenistic poems by Amalie von Helvig.

Though domestic duties connected to her 1811 marriage to von Arnim diminished her productivity, several art songs from the period have been recovered and have been published in &quot;Werke und Briefe&quot;. Von Arnim was the first composer to set the poet Hölderlin&#x27;s work to music.

She was a muse to the progressives of Prussia, linked to the socialist movement and an advocate for the oppressed Jewish community. She published two politically dissident works but evaded chastisement because of her friendship with the King of Prussia.

After the 1831 death of her husband, Bettina continued her dedication to the creative community. She published a collection of seven songs in public support of Prussian music director Gaspare Spontini, under duress at the time.

The tale also reworks the motif of the magical inexhaustible purse found in the European tale of &quot;Fortunatus&quot;.

==Legacy==
The German-American settlement of Bettina in the state of Texas was founded in 1847, and named by its progressive, idealistic founders after Bettina von Arnim. Located near the juncture of Elm Creek and the Llano River, it lasted only a year. No trace of the Bettina community survives, though two of its three founders subsequently became prominent: Gustav Schleicher, later a U.S. congressman and namesake of Schleicher County, and Dr. Ferdinand Ludwig Herff, who in 1854 became the first surgeon to use anesthesia in Texas. The community&#x27;s third founder was Hermann Spiess.

Part of von Arnim&#x27;s design for a colossal statue of Goethe, executed in marble by the sculptor Carl Johann Steinhäuser (1813–1878), was displayed in the museum at Weimar in 1911.

The chamber opera &quot;Bettina&quot; by Friedrich Schenker, which was premiered in Berlin in 1987, deals with her friendship to Karoline von Günderrode.

Her relationship with Goethe featured in Milan Kundera&#x27;s 1990 novel &quot;Immortality&quot;.

From 1991 until 31 December 2001, her portrait was on the German 5-Deutsche Mark bill.

Her friendship with Robert Schumann featured in Andrew Crumey&#x27;s 2004 novel &quot;Mobius Dick&quot;. She is also mentioned in Crumey&#x27;s 2023 novel &quot;Beethoven&#x27;s Assassins&quot;.

In 2006, the German government turned Künstlerhaus Schloss Wiepersdorf, the estate of the von Arnims, into a literary institute. The institute contains a museum devoted to the von Arnims&#x27; literary legacy.

<doc id="833192" wikidata="Q517162" url="?curid=833192" title="Agnes Mary Frances Duclaux">
<text>Agnes Mary Frances Robinson (known as Agnes-Marie-François Darmesteter after her first marriage, and Agnes Mary Frances Duclaux after her second; 27 February 1857 – 9 February 1944) was an Anglo-French poet, novelist, essayist, literary critic, and translator. She was the elder sister of the novelist and critic Frances Mabel Robinson.

==Life==
Agnes Mary Frances Robinson was born in Leamington, Warwickshire, on 27 February 1857 to a wealthy architect. After a few years, the family moved to become a part of the artistic community growing in London. Robinson and her younger sister, Frances Mabel Robinson, shared an education under governesses and in Brussels until they attended one year at University College, London. The Robinson house became a central location for painters and writers of the Pre-Raphaelite movement, such as William Michael Rossetti, William Morris, William Holman Hunt, Edward Burne-Jones, James Abbott McNeill Whistler, Arthur Symons, Ford Madox Brown, and Mathilde Blind, to meet and cultivate a community of artists.

In 1876, Robinson met John Addington Symonds, who provided literary advice as she began her writing. Robinson&#x27;s first book of poems, &quot;A Handful of Honeysuckle&quot; was published in 1878 and was greeted with much success. In 1880, the family travelled to Italy, where Robinson first met Vernon Lee (Violet Paget). During the 1880s, Robinson published a book of poetry almost every year, as well as her one novel &quot;Arden&quot;. She received most of her acclaim through her lyrics. In 1888, Robinson married James Darmesteter, a Jewish professor at the College de France and moved to Paris, France. Darmesteter translated much of Robinson&#x27;s works into French during their marriage, and Robinson improved her own French where she eventually published her first original work in French, &quot;Marguerites du Temps Passé&quot;. During her stay in Paris, Robinson and her husband became involved in the Parisian literary society which included Hippolyte Taine, Ernest Renan, and Gaston Paris. After a brief 6 years married, Darmesteter died on 19 October 1894 from a short illness and left Robinson widowed at age 38. Robinson remained in France after Darmesteter died, and she wrote articles for the &quot;Revue de Paris&quot;, translated her late husband&#x27;s work, and researched for a biography she wrote for Ernest Renan.

Robinson mingled with the scientific community of France as well, and in 1902 she married Emile Duclaux, a student of the biologist and chemist Louis Pasteur. Robinson became a part of Duclaux&#x27;s scientific studies and assisted him in his writings. After Duclaux died in 1904, Robinson continued to delve more in France and French life, living among her stepchildren from Auvergne to Paris. For the next 20 years, Robinson wrote biographies of prominent artists, reviews of literature, and poetry collections. When war broke out in 1939, her stepchildren moved Robinson and her sister Mabel to a hiding place in Aurillac where she remained safe, peacefully writing French and English poetry. In 1943, Robinson underwent an operation for the removal of a double cataract from her eyes, but died 4 months later on 9 February 1944. Robinson died at the age of 86 and was buried in Aurillac.

==Personal Relationships==
Robinson formed many intimate relationships throughout her life. Her longest intimate relationship was shared with Vernon Lee (the pen name of Violet Paget). The two of them travelled between England, France, and Italy for 8 years until Robinson settled into married life with Darmesteter in Paris. Lee broke down after the initial marriage announcement and although she never fully recovered, she did renew her friendship once more through letters and some visits to Paris. In Bibliothèque nationale in Paris, 1,253 folio pages still exist of letters between Lee and Robinson and 1,100 of the pages are from 1880-1887 before Robinson&#x27;s marriage to Darmesteter. The letters contain intimate terms such as &quot;dear love&quot; and &quot;dear glory of my life&quot;.

Robinson and Lee also shared a close relationship with the author John Addington Symonds, who published articles on male homosexuality and worked closely with Havelock Ellis on his work &quot;Sexual Inversion&quot;. Although Symonds was married and openly homosexual, his letters show his appreciation of Robinson. He states in one such letter that Robinson was &quot;a charming friend in every possible way: a more beautiful and gentle spirit I have never met with.&quot; Symonds mentored Robinson through her study of Greek language and literature at University College London. Symonds shared an intellectual relationship with Robinson and Lee, taking on the role of a teacher and critique of their works.

==Work==
Robinson wrote hundreds of poems and ballads that are published in many different journals and books. Robinson published books of her own collected works in both English and French, and also wrote the first full-length biography of Emily Brontë to positive reviews. Robinson&#x27;s poetry and lyrics were considered mostly part of the aestheticism intellectual movement. The movement reflects the significance of poetry as beautiful with no deeper meaning. In 1902, Robinson published &quot;Collected Poems, lyrical and narrative&quot; which held a short &quot;Preface&quot; written on the subject of poetry and authorship. Although Robinson comments that poetry should be written in at one&#x27;s limit or &quot;extremity&quot;, she admits this collection of poems were written over the span of 23 years and were &quot;re-considered&quot;, &quot;revised&quot;, and &quot;re-written.&quot; She accepts that poets do not look for recognition today but &quot;may find an audience to-morrow&quot;, recognizes her status in the sights of great poets such as Byron, Hugo, and Keats.

Robinson takes pride in being a lesser known poet that may create the minor works of sincerity. She says: &quot;We cannot all be great poets; but the humblest, if they be sincere, may give a genuine pleasure.&quot; Robinson writes from what she sees and knows, and her aesthetic lyrics form as she comments &quot;[t]hat life has been an Ode, of which these pages are the scattered fragments.&quot;

Robinson&#x27;s most controversial collection of poems of her time was &quot;The New Arcadia&quot;. This collection of poems told the stories of a series of characters living in rural England. The poems tried to raise awareness to the rural poverty caused by the agricultural depression of the 1870s. Robinson investigated, with Lee, how poetry could invoke sympathetic compassion and understanding in the reader.

<text>The Vere Harmsworth Professorship of Imperial and Naval History is one of the senior professorships in history at the University of Cambridge. After the Beit Professorship of Colonial History at Oxford (founded in 1905) and the Rhodes Professorship of Imperial History at King&#x27;s College London (founded in 1919), it is the third oldest chair in its subject in the world.

In 1919 Harold Harmsworth, 1st Viscount Rothermere endowed a &quot;Professorship of Naval History&quot; at Cambridge with a donation of £20,000, in memory of his son Vere who was killed at the Battle of Ancre in November 1916. In 1932 the Royal Empire Society successfully campaigned for Cambridge to accept the renaming of the chair to &quot;The Professorship of Imperial and Naval History&quot;, under which rubric a new professor was appointed in 1934. Among the holders of this prestigious chair, only Admiral Sir Herbert Richmond has specialized in naval history, while the others have tended to be scholars of imperial history.

<text>The Northwest Asian Weekly is an Asian American newspaper based in Seattle, Washington&#x27;s International District. It was founded in 1983 by Assunta Ng, publisher of the &quot;Seattle Chinese Post&quot;, and published free weekly editions until January 2023.

==History==

&quot;Northwest Asian Weekly&quot; published its first edition on February 5, 1983, as the successor to an English insert in the &quot;Seattle Chinese Post&quot; that debuted in September 1982.

Both newspapers were published by Assunta Ng; among the early supporters of the &quot;Asian Weekly&quot; was Gary Locke, who later became the first Asian American governor of Washington. It was distributed for free and had a circulation of 9,500 prior to the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020.

The &quot;Asian Weekly&quot; ceased print publication on January 21, 2023, and became an online-only news outlet; the &quot;Seattle Chinese Post&quot; also ceased on the same day.

In May 2024, Ng sold &quot;Asian Weekly&quot; to a group of four investors.

==Distribution==

Northwest Asian Weekly&#x27;s print version were widely distributed in Seattle, primarily at Asian American businesses, grocery stores, and restaurants. They were also available at businesses in other parts of King and Snohomish counties, as well as public libraries statewide.

<text>The United States Senate Committee on Health, Education, Labor and Pensions (HELP) generally considers matters relating to these issues. Its jurisdiction also extends beyond these issues to include several more specific areas, as defined by Senate rules.

== History ==
While it is currently known as the HELP Committee, the committee was originally founded on January 28, 1869, as the Committee on Education. Its name was changed to the Committee on Education and Labor on February 14, 1870, when petitions relating to labor were to its jurisdiction from the Committee on Naval Affairs.

The committee’s jurisdiction at the end of the 19th and early 20th centuries focused largely on issues relating to federal employees’ working conditions and federal education aid. Prominent action considered by the committee in the 1910s and 1920s included the creation of a national minimum wage, the establishments of a Department of Labor, a Department of Education, and a Children’s Bureau. During the 1930s, the committee took action on the National Labor Relations Act, the Walsh-Healey Public Contracts Act of 1936 and the Fair Labor Standards Act of 1938.

In 1944, the jurisdiction of the Public Health Service was transferred from the Commerce Committee to the Committee on Education and Labor, adding issues relating to public health matters to its jurisdiction. The committee&#x27;s name was changed during the 80th Congress to the Committee on Labor and Public Welfare as part of the Legislative Reorganization Act of 1946 (Public Law 79-601). The act further expanded the committee&#x27;s oversight to include the rehabilitation, health, and education of veterans. Mine safety was also added to the committee’s jurisdiction in 1949.

During the Administration of President Lyndon B. Johnson, the committee took the lead in shaping legislation as part of Johnson&#x27;s War on Poverty, resulting in the Economic Opportunity Act of 1964. Through the Legislative Reorganization Act of 1970 (Public Law 91-510), certain issues pertaining to veterans were transferred to the newly created Committee on Veterans Affairs. In the 95th Congress, the Senate passed S. Res. 4, which renamed the committee to be the Committee on Human Resources. However, the name was again changed in the 96th Congress by S. Res. 30 to the Committee on Labor and Human Resources. On March 18, 1992, the committee’s jurisdiction was updated to include all of the areas listed below. The committee was given its current name, the Committee on Health, Education, Labor and Pensions, on January 19, 1999, by S. Res. 20.

On July 25, 2024, the committee voted 16-4 to issue its first-ever subpoena, compelling the testimony of Steward Health Care&#x27;s CEO Ralph de la Torre in relation to accusations of mismanagement of the health system.

<doc id="833229" wikidata="Q2367889" url="?curid=833229" title="Saint Tudwal's Islands">
<text>Saint Tudwal&#x27;s Islands (Welsh: Ynysoedd Tudwal) are a small archipelago lying south of Abersoch on the Llŷn Peninsula in North Wales, at the western end of Tremadog Bay. They were referred to as the Studwells in the early 19th century. The name of the islands derives from their traditional identification as the site of a hermitage used by Saint Tudwal during the 6th century. They are about east of the southern tip of the Llŷn Peninsula.

There are two main islands: Saint Tudwal&#x27;s Island West (Welsh: Ynys Tudwal Fawr)() and Saint Tudwal&#x27;s Island East (Welsh: Ynys Tudwal Fach) (), plus the Carreg y Trai rocks.

The islands are part of the Llŷn Area of Outstanding Natural Beauty and are known for their beaches and wildlife, having a variety of wild birds including razorbills, guillemots and choughs, and being a breeding site for grey seals. They are also popular for water sports. The western island houses the St Tudwal’s Lighthouse, and the eastern has the remains of a priory. The western island reaches 144 feet (44 metres) and is the higher of the two.

==Saint Tudwal&#x27;s Island East==
Saint Tudwal&#x27;s Island East () is a grass covered, kidney-shaped island, about in length and in width. It was owned by author Carla Lane until her death in May 2016.

The highest point on the island is above sea level. It is located just over off the Llŷn Peninsula in Gwynedd. The nearest settlement (apart from the lighthouse on Saint Tudwal&#x27;s Island West) is Machroes. Small ships sail from the nearby town of Abersoch to take passengers to view the wildlife. The island is believed to be the original hermitage of Saint Tudwal, which is presumably where its name comes from. The remains of a priory, referred to in the 1291 tax rolls, are on its eastern side.

==Saint Tudwal&#x27;s Island West==
The West island is long and at its widest point. It was sold into private ownership in 1935. More recently it was purchased by the adventurer Bear Grylls who holidays on the island, living in the former lighthouse keeper&#x27;s cottage. On 22 August 2013 it was reported that he was facing a planning investigation by Gwynedd Council, after installing a slide into the sea. He has since taken the slide down, saying it was never intended to be permanent and that he would clear it with the council before using it again.

<text>The Pakenham line is a commuter railway line on the Melbourne metropolitan railway network serving the city of Melbourne in Victoria, Australia. Operated by Metro Trains Melbourne, the line is coloured light blue and is one of the two lines that constitute the Caulfield group. It is the city&#x27;s longest metropolitan railway line at . The line runs from Flinders Street station in central Melbourne to East Pakenham station in the south-east, serving 27 stations via South Yarra, Caulfield, Oakleigh, and Dandenong. 

The line operates for approximately 20 hours a day (from approximately 4:00 am to around midnight) with 24 hour service available on Friday and Saturday nights. During peak hour, headways of up to 5 to 10 minutes are operated with services every 20 minutes during off-peak hours. Trains on the Pakenham line run with a seven-car formation operated by High Capacity Metro Trains.

Sections of the Pakenham line opened as early as 1859, with the line fully extended to Pakenham in October 1877. A limited number of stations were first opened, with infill stations progressively opened between 1879 and 2012. The line was built to connect Melbourne with the rural towns of Caulfield, Oakleigh, and Dandenong, amongst others. Significant growth has occurred since opening, with an extension to open on the Pakenham line one stop east to a new station in Pakenham East as part of the Level Crossing Removal Project. This extension opened on 3 June 2024.

Since the 2010s, due to the heavily utilised infrastructure of the Pakenham line, significant improvements and upgrades have been made. A $15 billion upgrade of the corridor included the replacement of sleepers, the introduction of new signalling technology, the introduction of new rolling stock, the removal of all level crossings, and works associated with the Metro Tunnel project. These projects have improved the quality and safety of the line and will be completed by the opening of the Metro Tunnel in 2025.

== History ==
=== 19th century ===
In 1877, the Pakenham line began operations from Oakleigh to Bunyip, as part of the main line to Gippsland. The section from Oakleigh to Flinders Street station was connected at South Yarra in April 1879. In 1877, the Pakenham line began operations from Oakleigh to Bunyip, as part of the single-tracked main line to Gippsland, with an extension of the duplicated section of the line opening in 1881 to Caulfield, Oakleigh in 1883, and Dandenong in 1891. In 1883 the line between Richmond station and South Yarra was quadrupled to accommodate an increase in train services due to the opening of Frankston and Sandringham lines.

In 1885, a number of level crossing removal works occurred between Flinders Street station and South Yarra due to an increase in freight and passenger operations. These crossings were removed through a combination of lowering and raising the corridor.

=== 20th century ===

In 1915, the line between South Yarra and Caulfield was quadrupled, as part of level crossing removal works. This section of the line was lowered into a cutting to eliminate numerous level crossings. Power signalling was provided between Richmond and Hawksburn at the same time, then on to Caulfield in 1921.

Electrification of the line to Dandenong occurred in two stages during 1922. In May 1922, the section from South Yarra to Oakleigh station was electrified, with the section to Dandenong being electrified later in December 1922. The electrification of the line allowed for the introduction of Swing Door electric multiple unit trains for the first time.

Power signalling was extended to Carnegie in 1933, Oakleigh in 1940, and to Dandenong in stages between 1970 and 1972.

The line between Dandenong, Pakenham and Traralgon was electrified in 1954. Initially single track, duplication of the line between Dandenong, Pakenham and Nar Nar Goon was completed in 1955 and 1956. Suburban services were extended beyond Dandenong to Pakenham in January 1975. Previously, the stations between Dandenong and Pakenham were only served by regional passenger trains connecting Gippsland to Melbourne.

In 1981, Pakenham line services commenced operations through the City Loop, after previously terminating at Flinders or Spencer Street stations. The commencement of operations involved the service stopping at three new stations—Parliament, Melbourne Central (formally Museum), and Flagstaff. The Loop follows La Trobe and Spring Streets along the northern and eastern edges of the Hoddle Grid. The Loop connects with Melbourne&#x27;s two busiest stations, Flinders Street and Southern Cross, via the elevated Flinders Street Viaduct. From 2025, the Pakenham line will no longer operate through the City Loop, instead operating via the north-south Metro Tunnel corridor.

=== 21st century ===
In 2002, after the closure of the nearby General Motors factory in 1991, General Motors station closed permanently after 46 years of operation. A 2007 restructure of train ticketing in Melbourne involved the removal of Zone 3, with Zone 3 stations being re-classified to Zone 2. This brought the cost of train fares down, improving system accessibility to the public.

The Pakenham line received heavy investment during the 2010s to align with the 2013 PTV Development Plan. A new station at Cardinia Road opened in 2012 situated between Officer and Pakenham stations. This is the first infill station to open on the line since 1927, with an additional station at Pakenham East expected to open in 2024 in conjunction with level crossing removal works. In 2018, the Pakenham East Depot opened for the newly acquired High Capacity Metro Trains. This depot has stabling capacity for 30 seven-car trains with train maintenance, driver training, and washing facilities present onsite.

Announced in 2021, the Pakenham line was extended one stop east to East Pakenham. The extension involved the removal of the Main Street and Racecourse Road level crossings, the elevation of Pakenham station, the construction of a new station at East Pakenham and other associated safety and landscape works. These works were undertaken as part of the Level Crossing Removal Project. The rebuilt Pakenham and East Pakenham opened on 3 June 2024.

== Route ==

The Pakenham line forms a relatively linear route from the Melbourne central business district to its terminus in Pakenham. The route is long and is predominantly doubled tracked, however between Flinders Street and Richmond, the corridor is widened to 12 tracks, narrowing to six tracks between Richmond and South Yarra before again narrowing to four tracks between South Yarra and Caulfield. After Caulfield station, the corridor again narrows to two tracks for the rest of the route. The only underground section of the Pakenham line is in the City Loop, where the service stops at 3 underground stations. Exiting the city, the Pakenham line traverses mainly flat country with few curves and fairly minimal earthworks for most of the line. However, between South Yarra and Malvern, the rail corridor has been lowered into a cutting to eliminate level crossings, and between Malvern and Caulfield, the corridor has been raised on an embankment for the same reason. After Caulfield, the line formerly had numerous level crossings, however, all have now been removed between Caulfield and Dandenong as part of an elevated rail project, as well as some older bridges over and under roads. Remaining level crossings between Dandenong and Pakenham stations will be removed by 2025 under smaller level crossing removal works.

The line follows the same alignment as the Cranbourne line with the two services splitting onto different routes at Dandenong. The Pakenham line continues on its eastern alignment, whereas the Cranbourne line takes a southerly alignment towards its final destination of Cranbourne station. Most of the rail line goes through built-up suburbs and some industrial areas, but after Dandenong, the line passes through more open countryside, including open fields and farms, particularly after Beaconsfield. This outer portion of the line is one of Melbourne&#x27;s main growth corridors, where farmland is being replaced with housing and commercial developments, leading to a rise in patronage.

=== Stations ===
The line serves 28 stations across of track. The stations are a mix of elevated, lowered, underground, and ground level designs. Underground stations are present only in the City Loop, with the majority of elevated and lowered stations being constructed as part of the Level Crossing Removal Project. From 2025, services will cease to stop at Flinders Street, Southern Cross, Flagstaff, Melbourne Central, Parliament, Richmond and South Yarra stations due to the opening of the Metro Tunnel. From March-June 2024, Narre Warren and Pakenham stations were elevated as part of Level Crossing Removal Project. Once the Metro Tunnel has been constructed, the Pakenham and Cranbourne line will be routed through to Sunbury.


==== Planned stations ====
== Services ==
Services on the Pakenham line operates from approximately 4:00 am to around 11:30 daily. In general, during peak hours, train frequency is 5 minutes on the Dandenong corridor (combined with the Cranbourne line) and 10 minutes in the AM peak on the Pakenham Line while during non-peak hours the frequency is reduced to 20–30 minutes throughout the entire route. Services run anticlockwise through the City Loop, and from 2025, Pakenham line services will cease to stop at South Yarra, Richmond, and all City Loop stations when trains are rerouted through the Metro Tunnel upon opening. On Friday nights and weekends, services run 24 hours a day, with 60 minute frequencies available outside of normal operating hours. Since 13 February 2022, some off-peak daytime Pakenham and Cranbourne line services stop at Malvern station, running express between South Yarra and Malvern stations.

Train services on the Pakenham line are also subjected to maintenance and renewal works, usually on selected Fridays and Saturdays. Shuttle bus services are provided throughout the duration of works for affected commuters.

=== Stopping patterns ===

=== Operators ===
The Pakenham line has had a total of 7 operators since its opening in 1877. The majority of operations throughout its history have been government run: from its first service in 1877 until the 1999 privatisation of Melbourne&#x27;s rail network, four different government operators have run the line. These operators, Victorian Railways, the Metropolitan Transit Authority, the Public Transport Corporation and Bayside Trains have a combined operational length of 122 years.

Bayside Trains was privatised in August 1999 and later rebranded M&gt;Train. In 2002, M&gt;Train was placed into receivership and the state government regained ownership of the line, with KPMG appointed as receivers to operate M&gt;Train on behalf of the state government. Two years later, rival train operator Connex Melbourne took over the M&gt;Train operations including the Pakenham line. Metro Trains Melbourne, the current private operator, then took over the operations in 2009. The private operators have had a combined operational period of years.
== Infrastructure ==

=== Rolling stock ===


The Pakenham line uses a fleet of electric multiple unit (EMU) High Capacity Metro Trains operating in a seven-car configuration, with three doors per side on each carriage and can accommodate of up to 1,380 passengers in each train-set. Shared with the Cranbourne, Sunbury, and Airport lines, the rolling stock will consist of 70 High Capacity Metro Trains (HCMT), once fully delivered. They are built in Changchun, China, with final assembly occurring in Newport, Melbourne, by Evolution Rail, a consortium composed of CRRC Changchun Railway Vehicles, Downer Rail and Plenary Group.
Previously, the Pakenham line was served by a fleet of Comeng and Siemens Nexas trains. The oldest Comeng trains (stage 1 and some stage 2) have been retired and scrapped as part of the HCMT introduction, however, some of these trains have been displaced onto other Melbourne metropolitan lines. In comparison, the Siemens Nexas trains have not been retired, instead being moved onto other lines to replace older Comeng sets. Since the end of 2022, the Pakenham line is almost exclusively operated by High Capacity Metro Trains.

Alongside the passenger trains, Pakenham line tracks and equipment are maintained by a fleet of engineering trains. The four types of engineering trains are: the shunting train; designed for moving trains along non-electrified corridors and for transporting other maintenance locomotives, for track evaluation; designed for evaluating track and its condition, the overhead inspection train; designed for overhead wiring inspection, and the infrastructure evaluation carriage designed for general infrastructure evaluation. Most of these trains are repurposed locomotives previously used by V/Line, Metro Trains, and the Southern Shorthaul Railroad.

=== Depot ===

Rolling stock on the Pakenham line is primarily served by the Pakenham East Depot located in the outer suburb of Pakenham East. This depot was built in 2018 to exclusively house and maintain 30 brand new High Capacity Metro Trains while they are out of service. Built by evolution rail the depot consists of a stabbling yard and an advanced driver training simulator.

The depot is one of the most sustainable train maintenance regimes in Australia with:

* Energy savings of 23%
* Water savings of 46%
* 77% of water recycled
* 13% enchanment of biodiversity
* of carbon saved every year

=== Signalling ===

Since the mid to late 20th century, the Pakenham line has used a fixed block three position signalling system designed for lower frequencies and less services. However, the ageing system had undermined reliability due to the presence of system faults and limited frequencies, requiring the Pakenham, Cranbourne, and Sunbury lines to upgrade their signalling system. Since 2021, high-capacity signalling (HCS) has been rolling out on the Pakenham, Cranbourne, and Sunbury lines, allowing trains to safely run closer together and run more frequently. The new system is being delivered by CPB Contractors and Bombardier Transportation under the Rail Systems Alliance. These works valued at $1 billion includes the roll-out of of HCS and communications systems on the aforementioned lines, allowing an increase in reliability and frequency. The line will be equipped with Bombardier’s CityFlo 650 communications-based train control system, that will enable operation at 2–3 minute headways.

The upgrading works were completed in phases from 2021. With the upgraded signalling system, trains are now able to run closer to each other. The new system was tested on the Mernda line and a section of the Cranbourne line before being fully implemented on the lines. In March 2022, the Pakenham line underwent further testing of high-tech signalling equipment, to ensure the new trains and signalling system can safely run alongside older-generation trains—including freight and V/Line trains—and the existing signalling system.

=== Stations facilities ===

==== Customer service ====

All premium railway stations on the Pakenham line have customer service centres that are open from the first to the last service. Host stations on the line also have customer service centres, however these are only staffed for a few hours during the morning peak.

At the service centres, passengers can:

* Buy tickets (Myki)
* Pick up timetables
* Collect change for vending machines and payphones

==== Accessibility ====
In compliance with the Disability Discrimination Act of 1992, all stations that are new-built or rebuilt are fully accessible and comply with these guidelines. The majority of stations on the corridor are fully accessible, however, there are some stations that haven&#x27;t been upgraded to meet these guidelines. These stations do feature ramps, however, they have a gradient greater than 1 in 14. Stations that are fully accessible feature ramps that have a gradient less than 1 in 14, have at-grade paths, or feature lifts. These stations typically also feature tactile boarding indicators, independent boarding ramps, wheelchair accessible myki barriers, hearing loops, and widened paths.

Projects improving station accessibility have included the Level Crossing Removal Project that involves station rebuilds and upgrades, individual station upgrade projects, and associated Metro Tunnel works. These works have made significant strides in improving network accessibility, with more than 60% of Pakenham line stations classed as fully accessible. This number is expected to grow within the coming years, as a network restructure associated with the opening of the Metro Tunnel is completed and level crossing removal works are completed on the corridor by 2025.

==== Passenger information displays ====
Most stations on the Pakenham line are equipped with passenger information displays which provide real time departure information. These displays are owned by Public Transport Victoria and are managed by Metro Trains Melbourne. With the exception of the five central stations, most stations on the network are equipped with 2 line LED displays. However, since 2016 these are being replaced by flat screen displays that additionally show every station the train will serve.

== Future ==
=== Metro Tunnel ===
The 2012 Network Development Plan identified the need for a north-south tunnel connecting the Cranbourne and Pakenham lines to the Sunbury line. In 2017, the Metro Tunnel began construction, involving the construction of five new underground stations, twin tunnels, and other associated infrastructure improvements. Leaving the existing Pakenham line alignment before South Yarra station, new stations will be built at Anzac, Town Hall (with connections to Flinders Street), State Library (with connections to Melbourne Central), Parkville, and Arden, before continuing onto the Sunbury line. These works will be completed by 2025, and upon completion, will create a singular rail line from Cranbourne and Pakenham to Sunbury and Melbourne Airport (from 2029).

=== Melbourne Airport rail link ===
The Melbourne Airport rail link will involve the construction of a line from Sunshine to a new station at Melbourne Airport. Connected via the Metro Tunnel, services will operate from the Cranbourne and Pakenham lines through the tunnel before splitting off at Sunshine to either Sunbury or Melbourne Airport. Construction of the line will involve the renovation of Sunshine station to allow for additional platforms, construction of new track, and the addition of two new stations at Keilor East and Melbourne Airport. Construction started in 2022 with services expected to begin in 2029.

=== Level crossing removals ===
The Level Crossing Removal Project has announced the removal of all 22 remaining level crossings on the Pakenham line, to be completed in stages from 2018 to 2025. All level crossings between Caulfield and Dandenong were removed in 2018 as part of the Caulfield to Dandenong skyrail project. This included the removal of nine level crossings and the reconstruction of five elevated stations along the corridor. The second phase of removals involves removing individual crossings along the corridor through a variety of methods by 2025. Some crossings have been removed through elevating the rail corridor, some by lowering or raising the road, with other crossings being removed by closing the crossing off from motor traffic. There have been two petitions to the Victorian Government to halt the closure of Progress Street in Dandenong, where local businesses have argued there are safety and congestion concerns, These projects will leave the entirety of the Pakenham line level crossing free by 2025, with projects on the Sunbury line leaving the entire Sunshine-Dandenong corridor crossing free by the opening of the Metro Tunnel in 2025.

<text>Jurek Becker (; – 14 March 1997) was a Polish-born German writer, screenwriter and East German dissident. His most famous novel is &quot;Jacob the Liar&quot;, which has been made into two films. He lived in Łódź during World War II for about two years and survived the Holocaust.

==Childhood==
Jurek Becker was born in a Jewish family, probably, in 1937. His birth date is not entirely clear because his father gave a birth date that was intended to protect the child from deportation. After the war Becker was claimed by a father (Jurek was never sure if he was his real father) who said he no longer remembered Jurek&#x27;s correct birth date. It is probable that Jurek Becker was some years younger than is generally reckoned.

He lived in the Łódź Ghetto as a child. When he was five, he was sent to the Ravensbrück concentration camp and later to Sachsenhausen. His mother was murdered in the Holocaust, but his father survived; father and son were reunited after the war and settled together in East Berlin.

==Career==
After completing his national service in the East German army in the 1950s, during which time he became firm friends with the actor Manfred Krug, Becker studied philosophy in East Berlin but was expelled for expressing non-conformist views. In the 1960s he wrote film scripts, one of which, &quot;Jakob der Lügner&quot; (&quot;Jacob the Liar&quot;), he turned into a novel when the film production was halted. It was made into a film by the East German film company DEFA in 1974, and in 1975 became the only East German film ever to be nominated for an Academy Award (in the foreign-language film category), though it did not win. A 1998 remake, starring Robin Williams in the title role, had limited success.

By the mid-1970s differences of opinion with the GDR authorities were becoming apparent, and Becker was one of the original twelve signatories of the petition against the expulsion of writer and singer Wolf Biermann in November 1976. In 1977 he moved from East to West Berlin, though somewhat unusually he retained his East German citizenship. He continued to publish novels and short stories, some on Jewish themes, others not.

==Death==
Becker died in 1997 of colon cancer that was diagnosed in December 1995.

<text>The Lord Almoner&#x27;s Professorships of Arabic were two professorships, one at the University of Oxford and one at the University of Cambridge. They were both founded before 1724, but records of the holders of the chairs only date from that year. The professors were appointed by the Crown and their salaries (£50 a year each) were paid by the Crown by a grant to the Lord Almoner. The Crown ceased to appoint the professors in 1903.

Both universities had existing chairs in Arabic, the Laudian Professorship at Oxford and Sir Thomas Adams&#x27;s Professorship at Cambridge.
== Oxford ==

At Oxford the chair, although endowed for the teaching of Arabic, was sometimes used for teaching Hebrew, and sometimes held by the same person as the Laudian Professor.

The chair was discontinued on the retirement of the incumbent in 1909.

== Cambridge ==
At Cambridge the chair was initially founded as a readership. Before it was upgraded to a professorship before or in 1815 it was usually combined with the Sir Thomas Adams&#x27;s Professor of Arabic chair and held by the same person.

The chair, &quot;which for two centuries&quot; had &quot;a distinguished record, but carried only a nominal stipend&quot;, was discontinued on the death of the incumbent, Professor Anthony Ashley Bevan, in 1933.

<text>BT Communications (Ireland) Limited is a telecommunications and internet company in Ireland. It is a subsidiary of BT Group plc.

==History==

===Esat Telecom===

The company was founded in 1990 by a consortium headed by business magnate Denis O&#x27;Brien and was originally known as Esat Telecom. The name Esat, said to be an abbreviation of &quot;Éireann Satellite&quot; and connected to O&#x27;Brien&#x27;s bid for Ireland&#x27;s communications satellite licence under the 1977 ITU frequency plans, would become much more associated with telecommunications in Ireland, however.

Esat Telecom applied a number of times for a telecommunications licence to the Department of Communications and was finally granted a limited one in March 1993. The company officially launched its services on 20 April 1994. It was the first domestic competitor to Bord Telecom Éireann (now Eircom) and, after initially reselling leased lines from that company, used &quot;autodiallers&quot; to route calls onto its network.

These devices proved controversial, with Telecom Éireann threatening legal action and the Department of Communications contending that these were a breach of Esat&#x27;s limited licence. However, an Esat complaint to the European Commission was upheld, and eventually in 1997, the new Director of Telecommunications Regulation (now called ComReg) regularised Esat&#x27;s position by ordering Telecom Éireann to provide a service to switch calls onto Esat&#x27;s network.

In 1996, Esat Telecom, in conjunction with Telenor AB, bid successfully for the second GSM mobile telecommunications licence, against five other consortia. This became known as Esat Digifone. The Moriarty Tribunal found in 2008 that the awarding of the licence was influenced by payments made by O&#x27;Brien to Michael Lowry, the Minister for Transport, Energy and Communications. On 7 November 1997, &quot;Esat Telecom Group plc&quot; held an initial public offering and was listed on the Irish Stock Exchange, London Stock Exchange, and NASDAQ stock market.

Originally the company targeted just corporate customers, but from 1 December 1998, when the Irish telecommunications market was fully deregulated, domestic customers were also targeted, under the &quot;Esat Clear&quot; brand name. 1,300 customers signed up before it had even launched. In 1999, Esat entered the Internet service provider market, initially through the purchase of EUnet Ireland, which became Esat Net. However, it was the acquisition of Ireland On-Line from An Post that year which made Esat the biggest ISP in the country for a time. Also in 1999, Esat bid for Cablelink Limited, the cable and television company owned jointly by Telecom Éireann and RTÉ. However, NTL won.

In 1999, Esat Telecom was the first wholly owned Irish company to lay two optical submarine cables between Ireland and the UK. No other company had achieved such a milestone and since then, only operators from outside the state have managed to install their own optical submarine cables.

===Esat BT===

In 1999, relations became tense between Esat and Telenor over how Esat Digifone, their mobile joint venture, should be operated. Telenor tried to remove Denis O&#x27;Brien as chairman of Esat Digifone and remove the Esat name from the company. Esat for its part retaliated by threatening to sue Telenor, and making repeated offers to buy the Norwegian company out. Eventually, in November 1999, Telenor bid for the entire share capital of Esat Telecom Group plc as a way of solving the situation. The bid was rejected by the Esat board and so became a hostile takeover attempt. To defend this, in January 2000, British Telecommunications plc (now BT Group plc) made a friendly takeover offer for the company which was backed by the Esat board. Esat became a wholly owned subsidiary of BT and was delisted from the stock market.

When BT acquired Esat, they began integrating the business along with its Northern Ireland subsidiary, BT (NI). The combined unit was then registered as BT Communications (Ireland) Limited.

The company&#x27;s main business is in fixed line telecommunications where it owns its own network in Northern Ireland and owns a network built along the Iarnród Éireann rail network in the Republic of Ireland and along the road which complements its rail network. The network build phase started in August 1997 and it also leases capacity from its fixed line incumbent, Eircom.

Following the company&#x27;s acquisition by BT, Esat Telecom was rebranded as Esat BT in 2002, and replaced its own logo with the BT piper.

===BT Ireland===

In late 2004, it was announced from April 2005, the name of the company would change from &quot;Esat BT&quot; to just &quot;BT Ireland&quot;. The company has performed well, winning some high-profile corporate clients. However, Eircom still commands over a 73% share of fixed-line telecommunications in the Republic of Ireland.

All company names in the Esat BT Group were officially re-registered with the Companies Registration Office as BT in March 2005, and on 12 April, the company was officially rebranded as &quot;BT Ireland&quot;.

On 22 July 2009, BT Ireland agreed to transfer most of its consumer and small business operations in Ireland, other than its remaining dial-up internet operations, to Vodafone Ireland. Large industrial and commercial customers will remain with BT. Under the partnership, Vodafone will provide voice and broadband internet services over BT&#x27;s network. The deal was subject to the Competition Authority&#x27;s approval, which was approved in August 2009.

BT Ireland do not own any infrastructure in Northern Ireland, being owned by BT Group (UK) directly.

==Esat Digifone==
Esat Digifone, a GSM mobile phone network which was the first competitor to Eircell (then a Telecom Éireann subsidiary) was originally a joint venture between Esat Telecom and Telenor, however when Esat was sold to BT, the mobile division became part of BT Wireless, which was eventually spun off as O2 plc, which in turn was bought by Spanish-based Telefónica in 2005 (EU approved in 2006). The company is now officially registered as Telefónica O2 Ireland Limited, but trades as O2. In June 2013, Hutchison Whampoa announced it would acquire the Irish arm of O2 for €780m. O2 is now merged with Hutchison Whampoa&#x27;s subsidiary Three Ireland following the completion of the sale.

<doc id="833289" wikidata="Q798399" url="?curid=833289" title="Black Widowers">
<text>The Black Widowers is a fictional men-only dining club created by Isaac Asimov for a series of sixty-six mystery stories that he started writing in 1971. Most of the stories were first published in &quot;Ellery Queen&#x27;s Mystery Magazine&quot;, though a few first appeared in &quot;Fantasy &amp; Science Fiction&quot;, &quot;Isaac Asimov&#x27;s Science Fiction Magazine&quot;, and the various book collections into which the stories were eventually gathered.

Asimov wrote &quot;there are few stories I write that I enjoy as much as I enjoy my Black Widowers.&quot;

==Synopsis==
Most of the stories follow the same basic convention: the six club members meet once a month at a private room at the Milano restaurant at Fifth and Eighteenth in New York. Each one takes a turn to act as host for the evening and brings along a guest for the occasion. The guest may be a friend, relative or colleague from work (women are not allowed). The meal is served by the incomparable waiter Henry Jackson — almost invariably referred to as simply Henry — whom the regulars look upon with high regard and even consider an actual member. The room includes sketches of the guests drawn by Black Widower Mario Gonzalo and a bookcase with an encyclopaedia that is often consulted.

After the main course, the brandy is served and the host rattles his spoon on his water glass for silence. One of the other Widowers is appointed as &quot;griller&quot; and begins the questioning, most often by asking the guest to &quot;justify his existence&quot;. In the course of the subsequent conversation, it always comes out that the guest has a problem, varying from personal issues to problems at work to actual crimes. The club members try to solve the problem, raising various related aspects in the course of the conversation, but are unable to come to a conclusion or resolution. In the end, it is Henry who provides the correct, and usually very simple, answer, obtained from details mentioned in the conversation. Asimov intended them to &quot;always&quot; follow that pattern.

Asimov uses the stories in order to delve into aspects of science, history, culture and other interests: for example, Goldbach&#x27;s conjecture in &quot;Sixty Million Trillion Combinations&quot;; Gilbert and Sullivan in &quot;The Year of the Action&quot;; and the origins of the name &quot;Susan&quot; in &quot;The Intrusion&quot;.

==Origins==
The &quot;Black Widowers&quot; were based on a literary dining club Asimov belonged to known as the Trap Door Spiders. Members of the Widowers were based on real-life Spiders, some of them famous writers in their own right:

* Geoffrey Avalon, a patent attorney (based on L. Sprague de Camp)
* Emmanuel Rubin, a mystery novelist and acquaintance of Isaac Asimov (based on Lester del Rey)
* James Drake, a chemist (based on Dr. John D. Clark)
* Thomas Trumbull, an expert in cryptography for the United States government (based on Gilbert Cant)
* Mario Gonzalo, an artist, who usually draws a portrait of the evening&#x27;s guest (based on Lin Carter)
* Roger Halsted, a high school mathematics teacher, fond of jokes and limericks (based on Don Bensen)

Club waiter Henry Jackson was not based on a real person, but Asimov explained that he might have been inspired in large part by Wodehouse&#x27;s immortal character Jeeves. Asimov was a P. G. Wodehouse fan and a member of the Wodehouse Society. 

The deceased founder of the club, Ralph Ottur, on whom the plot of the story &quot;To the Barest&quot; turned, was based on the real-life founder of the Trap Door Spiders, Fletcher Pratt.

Some guests were also based on real people. The stage magician The Amazing Larri (&quot;The Cross of Lorraine&quot;) was based on James Randi, while the arrogant science writer Mortimer Stellar (&quot;When No Man Pursueth&quot;) was based on Asimov himself.

==Books and stories==
The first five books each contained twelve stories; in each case, nine stories were first published in various magazines while three were first published in the book. As was usual with Asimov&#x27;s collections, many stories had chatty forewords or afterwords. The sixth book, published posthumously, contained six previously uncollected stories, eleven reprinted from previous collections, and additional material by Charles Ardai, William Brittain and Harlan Ellison.

A few &quot;Black Widowers&quot; tales have been written by other authors as tributes to Asimov. One is &quot;The Overheard Conversation&quot; by Edward D. Hoch, which appears in the festschrift anthology &quot;Foundation&#x27;s Friends&quot; (1989); another is &quot;The Last Story&quot;, by Charles Ardai, in &quot;The Return of the Black Widowers&quot; (2003).

<text>Feleknas Uca (born 17 September 1976) is a German politician of Kurdish Yazidi descent. From 1999 to 2009, she was member of the European Parliament from Germany, serving with Die Linke. Feleknas Uca was at one time the world&#x27;s only Yazidi parliamentarian until the Iraqi legislature was elected in 2005. She is formerly HDP&#x27;s Batman MP.

== Life and work ==
Feleknas Uca was born in Celle, Lower Saxony, West Germany to an immigrant Yazidi family originally from southeastern Turkey. She graduated from Comprehensive School in Celle before taking an apprenticeship as a doctor&#x27;s assistant, and completed her &quot;Abitur&quot; by distance learning. In 2010 she established the Feleknas Uca Foundation which focuses of the women and children rights. Uca was also the local spokesperson for representative of Terre des Femmes. Until July 2014, Feleknas Uca lived in Celle until she relocated to Diyarbakir in Turkey.

== Political career ==

=== In Europe ===
In 1999, aged 22, she was elected to the European Parliament fifth of six places on the Party of Democratic Socialism national list. In the 5th European Parliament (1999–2004), she sat on the Parliament&#x27;s committees on Culture, Education and the Media and Equal Opportunities. She maintained close links with pro-Kurdish groups in Turkey. She was a member of the EU-Turkey joint parliamentary committee.

In the PDS&#x27; selection of candidates for elections to the 6th European Parliament (2004–2009), Uca slipped to seventh place on the PDS national list, putting her seat under severe pressure. However, in the elections, she was returned in the last successful place.

While serving in the European Parliament, she attracted controversy within Turkey for her pro-Kurdish stances. In 2005, the Democratic People&#x27;s Party (DEHAP) was investigated by Turkish police for a speech given by Uca in the Kurdish language in which she called for the decrease of the electoral threshold from 10%, declare a general amnesty and suspend all military actions.

In 2009, Uca left the European Parliament. In 2012, she was detained in Turkey&#x27;s Istanbul Airport for attempting to take a large number of B-1 vitamins to Kurdish prisoners in Turkish prisons and was deported to Germany.

=== In Turkey ===
In July 2014, Uca resettled to Diyarbakır, the largest Kurdish populated city in Turkey. On 7 April 2015, Uca was nominated by the HDP to their electoral list for the upcoming parliamentary election as one of a number of Yazidis running for office. In the general elections on 7 June 2015 and 1 November 2015 she was elected a the Grand National Assembly of Turkey, both times representing the HDP for Diyarbakir. Turkish press reports write that she is the first ever Yazidi member of the Assembly along with Ali Atalan. In May 2016, her parliamentary immunity was lifted, which was condemned by several European politicians. She was re-elected in the Parliamentary Elections on 24 June 2018.

== Political positions ==

=== Kurdish politics ===
She was a member of the MP delegation in march to Cizre during the Curfew of Cizre in 2015. She is a supporter of the use of the Kurdish language, and opposes the prohibition of theater plays, events in the Kurdish language and the detention of people who teach in Kurdish language. She supports the co-chair system implemented in the municipalities governed by the Democratic Regions Party (DBP) and condemns the fact that the state appointed trustees assumed as acting mayors instead of the elected mayors of the BDP.

=== Foreign politics ===
She is a member of the EU-Turkey partner delegation for Turkey and the co-spokesperson for foreign relations of the HDP. She supports the autonomous Government in Syrian Kurdistan led by the Democratic Union Party (PYD). She is also grateful to the Kurdistan Workers&#x27; Party (PKK) for their defense of the Yazidi against the Islamic State (IS) in Iraq.

== Legal prosecution ==
In 2017 she was prosecuted for spreading terror propaganda. The State Prosecutor at the Court of Cassation in Turkey Bekir Şahin filed a lawsuit before the Constitutional Court on the 17 March 2021, demanding for Uca and 686 other HDP politicians a five-year ban for political activities. The lawsuit was filed together with a request for the HDP to be shut down due to the parties alleged organizational links with the PKK.

== Personal life ==
She is prepared to be detained in any moment and keeps a packed suitcase ready with her belongings in the case of an arrest.

<doc id="833306" wikidata="Q356513" url="?curid=833306" title="Jacques Lefèvre d'Étaples">
<text>Jacques Lefèvre d&#x27;Étaples (; Latinized as Jacobus Faber Stapulensis; c. 1455 – c. 1536) was a French theologian and a leading figure in French humanism. He was a precursor of the Protestant movement in France. The &quot;d&#x27;Étaples&quot; was not part of his name as such, but used to distinguish him from Jacques Lefèvre of Deventer, a less significant contemporary who was a friend and correspondent of Erasmus. Both are also sometimes called by the German version of their name, Jacob/Jakob Faber. He himself had a sometimes tense relationship with Erasmus, whose work on biblical translation and in theology closely paralleled his own.

Although he anticipated some ideas that were important to the Protestant Reformation, Lefèvre remained a Roman Catholic throughout his life, and sought to reform the Church without separating from it. Several of his books were condemned as heretical, and he spent some time in exile. He was, however, a favorite of the King of France, Francis I, and enjoyed his protection.

==Life==
He was born of humble parents at Étaples, in Picardy, but appears later to have been possessed of considerable means. He had already been ordained a priest when he entered the University of Paris for higher education. Hermonymus of Sparta was his master in Greek.

He visited Italy before 1486, for he heard the lectures of John Argyropoulos, who died in that year; he formed a friendship with Paulus Aemilius of Verona. In 1492 he again travelled in Italy, studying in Florence, Rome and Venice, making himself familiar with the writings of Aristotle, though greatly influenced by the Platonic philosophy. Returning to the University of Paris, he became the director of the Collège du Cardinal Lemoine. Among his famous pupils were Beatus Rhenanus, François Vatable, Charles de Bovelles, and Guillaume Farel; his connection with the last drew him closer to the Calvinistic side of the movement of reform. Farel joined Lefèvre at Meaux to help in the training of preachers, before Farel left for Switzerland where he was one of the founders of the Reformed churches.

In 1507 he took up his residence in the Benedictine Abbey of St Germain des Prés, near Paris; this was due to his connection with the family of Briçonnet (one of whom was the superior), especially with Guillaume Briçonnet, cardinal bishop of Saint-Malo, father of Guillaume Briçonnet, the later bishop of Meaux. He now began to give himself to Biblical studies, the first-fruit of which was his &quot;Quintuplex Psalterium: Gallicum, Romanum, Hebraicum, Vetus, Conciliatum&quot; (1509); the &quot;Conciliatum&quot; was his own version. This was followed by &quot;S. Pauli Epistolae xiv. ex vulgata editione, adjecta intelligentia ex Graeco cum commentariis&quot; (1512), a work of great independence and judgment.

His &quot;De Maria Magdalena et triduo Christi disceptatio&quot; of 1517, which argued that Mary the sister of Lazarus, Mary Magdalene and the penitent woman who anointed Christ&#x27;s feet were different people, provoked violent controversy and was condemned by the Sorbonne in 1521, and by Saint John Fisher. He had left Paris during the whole of 1520, and, removing to Meaux, was appointed vicar-general to Bishop Briçonnet on 1 May 1523; he published his French version of the New Testament later that year. From this, in the same year, he extracted the versions of the Gospels and Epistles &quot;&quot;. The prefaces and notes to both these expressed the view that Holy Scripture is the only rule of doctrine, and that justification is by faith alone.

After he finished the translation of the New Testament into French, all copies were ordered to be burned and he went into exile.

He incurred much hostility, but was protected by Francis I and his intellectual sister Marguerite d&#x27;Angoulême. After Francis was taken captive at the battle of Pavia on 25 February 1525, Lefèvre was condemned and his works suppressed by commission of the parlement; these measures were quashed on the return of Francis some months later. He issued &quot;Le Psautier de David&quot; in 1525, and was appointed royal librarian at Blois in 1526; his version of the Pentateuch appeared two years later. His complete version of the Bible of 1530 was based on the Vulgate of Jerome, took the same place as his version of the New Testament. The publication and its revised edition based on the Hebrew and the Greek texts were printed by Merten de Keyser in Antwerp in 1534. Marguerite, now queen of Navarre, led him to take refuge from persecution in Nérac in 1531. He is said to have been visited in 1533 by John Calvin on his flight from France. He died in Nérac in about 1536.

==Works==

;Aristotelian works (selected)
* &quot;Paraphrases of the Whole of Aristotle&#x27;s Natural Philosophy&quot; [Johannes Higman:] Parisii, 1492
* &quot;Introduction to the Metaphysics&quot; (1494)
* &quot;Introduction to the Nicomachean Ethics&quot; (1494)
* &quot;Logical Introductions&quot; (1496)
* &quot;Politics&quot; (1506)

;Boethius
The publication, with critical apparatus, of Boethius, &quot;De Arithmetica&quot;. Paris: Johannes Higman and Wolfgang Hopyl, 22 July 1496.

;Biblical translations
He was a prolific translator of the Bible. He completed a translation of the Old Testament in 1528, and was famous for his French translation of the Psalms and the Pauline epistles, which he finished early in his career. His completed translation of the entire Christian Bible, published in 1530, was the first in the French language.
* &quot;Psalterium quintuplex ; gallicum, romanum, hebraicum, vêtus, conciliatum&quot;, 1509 and 1515, published by Henri Estienne, fol. with footnotes
* &quot;Commentaires sur saint Paul, avec une nouvelle traduction latine&quot;, Paris, 1512 and 1531. This work, in which one notices the lack of progress which had been made in criticism, was criticised by Erasmus for the grammatical section, and by Budé for the theological section, however this did not prevent it from being valued and studied
* &quot;Commentaires sur les Évangiles&quot;, Meaux, 1525; his doctrine appears here to be very orthodox on the points disputed by the innovators, although the syndic Beda reproached him for errors in this respect
*&quot;Commentaires sur les épîtres canoniques&quot;, Meaux, 1525; all his commentaries on the New Testament were put on the Index by the Roman inquisitors, under Pope Clement VIII. He distanced himself from ancient barbarism
*&quot;Traduction française du Nouveau Testament&quot;, Paris, Colines, 1523, 5 vols. 8vo, anonymous extremely rare, particularly the last volume. The translation was made from the &quot;Vulgate&quot;, because he intended it for the use of the faithful. It appeared again in his complete version of the Bible, Antwerp, fol.; later editions 1529 and 1532, 4 vol. 4to.; 1528, 4 vol. 8vo. The edition revised by the doctors of Louvain is the most correct and also the rarest because it was suppressed as was the edition of 1511. It is remarkable that while the Cordeliers of Meaux attacked Lefèvre because of his translations, those of Antwerp approved it in 1528, for printing and for sale. It is true that they did not have in their edition &quot;l&#x27;Épître exhortatoire&quot;, which principally displeased the doctors of Paris
* &quot;Exhortations en français sur les évangiles et les épîtres des dimanches&quot;, Meaux, 1525, condemned by the Parlement

;Music theory
* &quot;Musica libris demonstrata quattuor&quot;, published together with Nemorarius, &quot;Arithmetica decem libris demonstrata&quot; and Boethius, &quot;De Arithmetica&quot;, Paris: Johannes Higman and Wolfgang Hopyl, 22 July 1496 Full text of 1551 edition

;Other works
* &quot;Arithmetica decem libris demonstrata&quot;, the &quot;De elementis arithmetice artis&quot; of Jordanus Nemorarius (Jordanus de Nemore) with commentary and demonstrations, published together with &quot;Musica libris demonstrata quattuor&quot; and Boethius, &quot;De Arithmetica&quot;, Paris: Johannes Higman and Wolfgang Hopyl, 22 July 1496
* &quot;Traduction latine des livres de la foi orthodoxe de saint Jean de Damas&quot; ; the first translation of this work
* &quot;De Maria Magdalena&quot;, 1517, followed in 1519 by another entitled: &quot;De tribus et unica Magdalena&quot;. This work is well done; the author retracts several points from the first work, for example his having said that these three women all bore the name of Magdalene

<text>Tankred Dorst (19 December 1925 – 1 June 2017) was a German playwright and storyteller.

Dorst lived and worked in Munich. His farces, parables, one-act-plays and adaptations were inspired by the theatre of the absurd and the works of Ionesco, Giraudoux and Beckett. His monumental drama &quot;Merlin oder das wüste Land&quot;, which was premiered in 1981 in Düsseldorf, has been compared to Goethe&#x27;s &quot;Faust&quot;. Some critics see it as the first major drama of the 1980s. In his tribute to Tankred Dorst on the occasion of the conferment of the Georg Büchner Prize in 1990, Georg Hensel remarked that Dorst&#x27;s plays all have a direct connection to the present: &quot;For 30 years Dorst&#x27;s plays have responded to the great transformations. He has always been a companion to the times.&quot;

Dorst first directed the &quot;Ring of the Nibelung&quot; in Bayreuth in 2006.

==Biography==
Tankred Dorst was born in Oberlind in Thuringia, Germany.

Conscripted into the German army as a pupil at the age of 17, he was soon captured and incarcerated as a prisoner of war. Until 1947 he remained in British and American hands. By the time he was released from war captivity, his birthplace had become part of the Soviet sector of Germany. He met his family in West Germany and completed his schooling. In 1950 he began studying German literature, art history and theatre in Bamberg and Munich. Through the 1950s he wrote his first plays for the marionette theatre &quot;Das Kleine Spiel&quot;, (some together with composer Wilhelm Killmayer). After breaking off his studies, he worked in various capacities in theatre, film, radio and publishing houses.

His first major plays were performed in 1960 in Lübeck, Mannheim and Heidelberg. Since then, his plays have been performed in the whole world. Dorst&#x27;s work has been recognized with many prizes and distinctions, including the Gerhart Hauptmann Prize (1964), Prize of the City of Florence (1970), Literature Prize of the Bayerische Akademie der Künste (1983), Mülheimer Dramatikerpreis (1989), Georg Büchner Prize (1990), E.T.A. Hoffmann Prize (1996) and the city of Zürich&#x27;s Max Frisch Prize (1998). In 2006, he was awarded the Samuel Bogumil Linde Prize. He was awarded the European Prize for Literature (2008). Dorst held visiting professorships at universities in Germany, Australia and New Zealand.

Dorst died on 1 June 2017 in Berlin.

<text>Phineas Fletcher (8 April 1582 – 13 December 1650) was an English poet, elder son of Giles Fletcher, and brother of Giles the Younger. He was born at Cranbrook, Kent, and was baptized on 8 April 1582.

==Life==

He was admitted a scholar of Eton, and in 1600 entered King&#x27;s College, Cambridge. He graduated B.A. in 1604, and M.A. in 1608, and was one of the contributors to &quot;Sorrow&#x27;s Joy&quot; (1603). His pastoral drama, &quot;Sicelides, or Piscatory&quot; was written (1614) for performance before James I, but only produced after the king&#x27;s departure at King&#x27;s College.

He had been ordained priest and before 1611 became a fellow of his college, but he left Cambridge before 1616, apparently because certain emoluments were refused him. He became chaplain to Sir Henry Willoughby, who presented him in 1621 to the rectory of Hilgay, Norfolk, where he married and spent the rest of his life.

==Works==
Phineas Fletcher wrote throughout his life. At his death he left behind a body of literature larger than that of his Renaissance contemporaries: in fact, his work rivals in size the canons of Spenser and Milton. The collected works of Phineas Fletcher include three volumes of religious prose, an epic, an epyllion, a drama, several medium-length verse narratives, pastoral eclogues, verse epistles, epithalamia, hymns, psalms, translations, various songs, occasional pieces, lyrics, and devotional poems. In scope, variety, and quality, his writings are second to none of that age.

In 1627 he published &quot;Locustae, vel Pietas Jesuitica&quot; (The Locusts or Apollyonists), two parallel poems in Latin and English furiously attacking the Jesuits. Alexander Balloch Grosart saw in this work one of the sources of Milton&#x27;s conception of Satan. Next year appeared an erotic poem, &quot;Brittain&#x27;s Ida&quot;, with Edmund Spenser&#x27;s name on the title page. It is certainly not by Spenser, and is printed by Grosart with the works of Phineas Fletcher. &quot;Sicelides&quot; was printed in 1631.

In 1632 appeared two theological prose treatises, &quot;The Way to Blessedness&quot; and &quot;Joy in Tribulation&quot;, and in 1633 his magnum opus, &quot;The Purple Island&quot;. The book was dedicated to his friend Edward Benlowes, and included his &quot;Piscatorie Eclogues and other Poetical Miscellanies&quot;. He died in 1650 in Hilgay, Norfolk, and his will was proved by his widow on 13 December that year.

&quot;The Purple Island, or the Isle of Man&quot;, is a poem in twelve cantos describing allegorically the physiological structure of the human body and the mind of man. The intellectual qualities are personified, while the veins are rivers, the bones the mountains of the island, the whole analogy being worked out with great ingenuity. The manner of Spenser is preserved throughout, but without the digressions of &quot;The Faerie Queene&quot;. The &quot;Piscatory Eclogues&quot; are pastorals, the characters of which are represented as fisher boys on the banks of the Cam, and are interesting for the light they cast on the biography of the poet himself (Thyrsil) and his father (Thelgon).

... the influence of Phineas Fletcher and his brother Giles is far greater than has generally been realized. Together they founded a distinct school of poetry which outlived the chilling influence of the Restoration...In Milton&#x27;s day, most of the Cantabrigians, Crashaw, Joseph Beaumont, Thomas Robinson, and others wrote more or less in their manner. In his boyhood Milton was enlisted in the School of the Fletchers and their influence is traceable even in his mature poems. Any study of Spenserian material in Milton, should include an elaborate examination of the work of the School of the Fletchers.
— H. E. Cory, 1912.

A complete edition of Phineas Fletcher&#x27;s works (4 vols.) was privately printed by Alexander Balloch Grosart (Fuller Worthies Library, 1869).

The standard work available in print remains Frederick S. Boas, &quot;The poetical Works of Giles and Phineas Fletcher&quot; (Cambridge University Press 1908).

In Dinah Craik&#x27;s 1856 novel, &quot;John Halifax, Gentleman&quot;, the fictional characters Abel Fletcher, a tanner, and his son Phineas are descendants of &#x27;Phineas Fletcher, who wrote the &quot;Purple Island&quot;&#x27;, in which descent they recognise they &#x27;originally came of a good stock&#x27;.

<text>Paul Oswald Ahnert (22 November 1897 – 27 February 1989) was a German astronomer. He first became famous in Germany for publishing the &quot;Kalender für Sternfreunde&quot; from 1948 until 1988, an annual calendar of astronomical events. The minor planet 3181 Ahnert is named in his honor.

Ahnert was born in Chemnitz, Kingdom of Saxony. During the First World War he served as an ordinary German field-soldier. After the war he became a member of the Social Democratic Party of Germany (SPD) and was a committed opponent of the rise of militarism and right wing revanchism in Germany. Between 1919 and 1933 he worked as an elementary school teacher. In addition to this he was an ambitious amateur astronomer and in 1923 his first article was published in the scientific journal Astronomische Nachrichten (AN 219 (1923), 165–170). He reported about long period variables he had observed from his private observatory.

When Adolf Hitler became Chancellor in 1933 the Nazi regime removed Paul Ahnert from his post. He was arrested and imprisoned for a few months in a concentration camp. Released from imprisonment he had to earn his living by doing occasional jobs. But in 1938 he had a lucky escape for his real profession. Cuno Hoffmeister invited him to the Sonneberg Observatory, where he worked during the Second World War as a computer (performing calculations) and assistant observer in a long term sky patrol and field survey program.

After the war he met the astronomer Eva Rohlfs at Sonneberg Observatory and married her in 1952. His second marriage lasted only two years, because Eva died in 1954 in age of 41. During the 1950s Paul Ahnert advanced from an assistant observer to an astronomer with international reputation, who made important observations of variable stars and solar activity.

He received an honorary doctor in astrophysics at the University of Jena in 1957. His name became well known in Germany, when he started to edit the &quot;Kalender für Sternfreunde&quot;, an annual calendar of astronomical events. The first volume was printed in 1949. Paul Ahnert edited it for over 40 years until he retired from this task, aged 90, and passed the work to younger hands. Paul Ahnert died in age of 91 in Sonneberg (Free State Thuringia).

<text>The Philidor Defence (or Philidor&#x27;s Defence) is a chess opening characterised by the moves:

:1. 
:2. 

The opening is named after the famous 18th-century player François-André Danican Philidor, who advocated it as an alternative to the common 2...Nc6. His original idea was to challenge White&#x27;s by the pawn thrust ...f7–f5.

Today, the Philidor is known as a but passive choice for Black, and is seldom seen in top-level play except as an alternative to the heavily analysed openings that can ensue after the normal 2...Nc6. It is considered a good opening for amateur players who seek a defensive strategy that is simpler and easier to understand than the complex positions that result from an opening such as the French Defence.

The &quot;Encyclopaedia of Chess Openings&quot; code for Philidor Defence is C41.
==History==
In his 1561 book, Ruy Lopez, seeking to debunk Pedro Damiano, advocated 2...d6 as superior to 2...Nc6, on the grounds that 2...Nc6 allows the strong move 3.Bb5, now known as the Ruy Lopez or Spanish Opening. Philidor evidently concurred with this assessment, though he also considered 2.Nf3 inferior to 2.Bc4. Philidor advocated the risky continuation 3.d4 f5!? The Philidor Defence subsequently became a popular opening, though 2...Nc6 remained the most common reply.

The Philidor occurred in one of the most famous games ever played, &quot;The Opera Game&quot; played in 1858 between the American chess master Paul Morphy and two strong amateurs, the German noble Duke Karl of Brunswick and the French aristocrat Count Isouard. The game continued 3.d4 Bg4, a deviation from modern standard lines. The Philidor Defence declined in popularity as became more developed, and it had almost completely vanished from top-tier chess by World War I.

, there are no top players who employ the Philidor with regularity, although Étienne Bacrot and Liviu-Dieter Nisipeanu have occasionally experimented with it in classical play. Its popularity in master play has increased slightly, however, over the last 20 years. It has also become fairly popular in rapid, blitz, and bullet chess.

==Main line: 3.d4 ==
With 3.d4, White immediately challenges Black in the . Black has several options.

===3...exd4===
The most common Black response is 3...exd4 which relieves the central , although it gives up the centre. After 4.Nxd4 Nf6 (4...d5 5.exd5, the Paulsen Attack, continues 5...Qxd5 6.Qe2+ Be7 7.Nb5 Na6 8.N1c3 Paulsen) 5.Nc3, Black normally continues ...Be7 and ...0-0 (the Antoshin Variation) and achieves a strong defensive position. A sample line is: 5...Be7 6.Bc4 0-0 7.0-0 c5, and the position is . 

In this line Black can also fianchetto his bishop to g7, although this is uncommon. Bent Larsen tried this in a few games, including a draw against Mikhail Tal in 1969.

Instead of 4.Nxd4, White can play 4.Qxd4, as Paul Morphy favoured, intending 4...Nc6 5.Bb5 Bd7 6.Bxc6 Bxc6 7.Nc3 Nf6 8.Bg5 followed by 0-0-0. This line was played in many 19th-century games.

===Hanham Variation===
The other main option for Black is to maintain the central tension and adopt a setup with ...Nd7, ...Be7, and ...c6. This plan is named the Hanham Variation (after the American chess master James Moore Hanham) and was favoured by Aron Nimzowitsch. A common line is: 3...Nf6 4.Nc3 Nbd7 5.Bc4 Be7 6.0-0 (6.Ng5 is an interesting alternative: after 6...0-0 7.Bxf7+ Rxf7 8.Ne6 Qe8 9.Nxc7 Qd8 10.Nxa8, White is up , but Black can develop a strong initiative after, for example, 10...b5 11.Nxb5 Qa5+) 6...0-0 7.a4 (to prevent ...b5) c6 ().

Grandmaster (GM) Larry Kaufman notes that the Hanham Variation aims to maintain Black&#x27;s pawn on e5, analogously to closed lines of the Ruy Lopez, and opines that &quot;it would be quite popular and on a par with the major defences to 1.e4, except for the annoying detail that Black can&#x27;t actually reach the Hanham position by force.&quot;

As an alternative to 4.Nc3 in response to Black&#x27;s 3...Nf6, according to both Kaufman and GM Christian Bauer, White retains some advantage with: 4.dxe5 Nxe4 5.Qd5! (the Rellstab Variation; 5.Nbd2 is the Sokolsky Variation) 5...Nc5 6.Bg5 Be7 7.exd6 Qxd6 8.Nc3.

====Alternative move order====
Black sometimes tries 3...Nd7 intending 4.Nc3 Ngf6, reaching the Hanham Variation. But then 4.Bc4! is awkward for Black to meet, since 4...Ngf6 loses to 5.dxe5 Nxe5 (5...dxe5 6.Ng5! wins) 6.Nxe5 dxe5 7.Bxf7+ Kxf7 8.Qxd8 Bb4+ 9.Qd2 Bxd2+ 10.Nxd2 winning a pawn, and 4...Be7 loses a pawn to 5.dxe5 Nxe5 (5...dxe5?? 6.Qd5! wins) 6.Nxe5 dxe5 7.Qh5! So 4...c6 is best for Black, but leaves White with the advantage of the after 5.0-0 Be7 6.dxe5 dxe5 (6...Nxe5 loses a pawn to 7.Nxe5 dxe5 8.Qh5) 7.Ng5! Bxg5 8.Qh5! Qe7 and now 9.Bxg5 or 9.Qxg5.

====Black experiments to reach the Hanham Variation====
In recent years, Black has experimented with other in an attempt to reach the Hanham Variation while avoiding 3...Nf6 4.dxe5! and 3...Nd7 4.Bc4! 
*One such line is 1.e4 d6 2.d4 Nf6 3.Nc3 Nbd7 intending 4.Nf3 e5. White can deviate, however, with 4.f4 or even 4.g4!? 
*Another try is 1.e4 d6 2.d4 Nf6 3.Nc3 e5 which transposes to the Hanham after 4.Nf3 Nbd7, but White can instead try to gain a small advantage with 4.dxe5 (Kaufman opines that 4.Nge2 is &quot;also promising&quot;) 4...dxe5 5.Qxd8+ Kxd8 6.Bc4. After 4.dxe5, Bauer concludes that &quot;White stands a trifle better&quot;, but that &quot;provided he plays accurately, Black doesn&#x27;t have much to fear following 6.Bc4, by choosing any of the three valid replies, 6...Ke8, 6...Bb4, or 6...Be6. Then 7.Bxe6 fxe6 his position remains a hard nut to crack.&quot;

===Philidor Countergambit: 3...f5 ===
A more aggressive approach for Black after 3.d4 is 3...f5 (), Philidor&#x27;s original intention and recommendation. In the 19th century, 3...f5 was also played by Paul Morphy. The move can lead to more than the other lines, but is often considered dubious. Others maintain that 3...f5 is a valid idea. GM Tony Kosten considers the move respectable in his monograph on the opening. The move was also played by David Bronstein and by Teimour Radjabov.

After 3...f5 White has several ways to proceed:
*4.Nc3 (the Zukertort Variation) and White obtains a clear advantage:
**4...fxe4 5.Nxe4 d5 (if 5...Nf6 6.Nxf6 gxf6 7.dxe5 fxe5 8.Bc4 Qf6 9.Ng5 Polugaevsky) 6.Nxe5 dxe4 7.Qh5+ g6 8.Nxg6 Nf6 (if 8...hxg6 9.Qxh8 Be6 10.Qe5+/− Larsen) 9.Qe5+ Kf7 (if 9...Be7 10.Nxh8 Nc6 11.Bb5 Qd5 12.Bg5+/− Zukertort) 10.Bc4+ Kg7 11.Bh6+ Kxh6 12.Nxh8 Bb4+ 13.c3 Qxh8 14.cxb4+/− (Keres). 
**4...exd4 5.Qxd4 fxe4 (if 5...Nf6 6.e5!) 6.Bg5 Nf6 7.Nxe4 Be7 8.Bc4 Nc6 9.Qe3+/− (Sozin).
**4...Nf6 5.dxe5 Nxe4 6.Nxe4 fxe4 7.Ng5 d5 8.e6 Bc5 9.Nxe4!+/− (Sozin, Sokolsky).
*4.Bc4 leads to clear advantage for White:
**4...exd4 5.Ng5 Nh6 6.0-0 (6.Nxh7, the Jaenisch Variation, leads to an position after 6...Ng4! 7.Nxf8 Kxf8 8.Qxd4 Nc6) 6...Nc6 7.Re1 f4 (or 7...fxe4 8.Nxe4 Ne5 9.Bxh6 gxh6 10.f4 Nxc4 11.Nxd6+ +/−) 8.Bxf4 Qf6 9.Qd2 Ne5 10.Be2 Bg4 11.f3 Bd7 12.Bg3 0-0-0 13.f4+/−. 
**4...Nf6 5.Ng5 Qe7 (or 5...d5 6.dxe5 dxc4 7.Qxd8+ Kxd8 8.exf6+/−) 6.Bf7+ Kd8 7.Bb3 exd4 8.0-0+/− (Berger).
**4...fxe4 5.Nxe5 d5 6.Qh5+ g6 7.Nxg6 Nf6 8.Qe5+ Be7 and continuing either 9.Qxe7+, 9.Nxh8 (Steinitz), or 9.Bb5+ (Keres).
*4.dxe5 forces Black to complicate matters further with 4...fxe4 5.Ng5 d5 with an unclear position. 
**After 6.e6 (the del Rio Attack), White obtains the upper hand after 6...Bc5 7.Nc3 (the Berger Variation), or 6...Nh6 7.Nc3! (Berger); however, Black can maintain lack of clarity with 6...Nf6!? 7.Nf7 Qe7 8.Nxh8 Bxe6, or 6...Bb4+ 7.c3 Bc5 8.Nf7 Qf6 9.Be3 Bxe6 10.Nxh8 Bxe3 11.fxe3 Qh4+ 12.g3 Qh6 13.Qd2 Nd7 14.c4 Ne5 15.Be2 dxc4 16.Nc3 Nd3+ 17.Bxd3 exd3 (Makarov).
**White also has 6.Nc3!? (Steinitz) and 6.c4. 
*4.exf5 e4 5.Ng5 Bxf5 6.Nc3 and White has a slight plus after 6...Nf6 7.f3 (Sozin), or 6...d5 7.f3.

===3...Bg4?!===
Inferior is 3...Bg4, in light of 4.dxe5 Bxf3 (Black cannot recapture since 4...dxe5 5.Qxd8+ Kxd8 6.Nxe5 wins a clean pawn; or, Black can gambit a pawn with 4...Nd7, the Albin Variation) 5.Qxf3 (or White can obtain an endgame advantage with 5.gxf3 dxe5 6.Qxd8+ Kxd8 7.f4 Maróczy) 5...dxe5 6.Bc4 giving White the advantage of the in an open position as well as a large advantage. Black cannot block the attack on the f7-pawn with the &quot;natural&quot; 6...Nf6? because White wins a pawn with 7.Qb3 (played in the famous &quot;Opera Game&quot;, where Morphy as White refrained from taking the b7-pawn and retained a strong after 7...Qe7 8.Nc3). Black does better with 6...Qf6 7.Qb3 Bc5 8.0-0 Bb6 9.a4 a5 10.Nc3 Ne7 11.Be3 Nd7 12.Rad1+/−, or 6...Qd7!? (Maróczy).

==Other 3rd moves for White==
An alternative approach for White is 3.Bc4, delaying d2–d4, or forgoing it entirely, playing d2–d3 instead. The move 3.Bc4 is also White&#x27;s route to a possible Légal Trap. Some continuations: 
*3...Nc6 to the Semi-Italian Opening. 
*3...f5 is the López Countergambit: 
**4.d4 transposes to the Philidor Countergambit. 
**Or unique positions can be obtained such as 4.d3 c6, possibly followed by ...f5–f4, ...b7–b5, ...a7–a5, and even ...g7–g5 and ...h7–h5, where all black pawns have moved before any piece.
*Or Black can try 3...Be7!? e.g. 4.0-0 (4.c3 is the Steinitz Variation) Nf6 5.Re1 0-0 6.d4 exd4 7.Nxd4 a6.

Against the alternative 3.c3, Black can try 3...f5 (3...Nc6 4.d4 Nf6 transposes to the Ponziani Opening) 4.exf5 Bxf5 5.Qb3 Nf6 6.Ng5 d5 7.Qxb7 Nbd7 8.Qc6 Bd6 with and .

<doc id="833373" wikidata="Q1355676" url="?curid=833373" title="Foul ball">
<text>In baseball, a foul ball is a batted ball that:

* Settles on foul territory between home and first base or between home and third base, or
* Bounces and then goes past first or third base on or over foul territory, or
* Has its first bounce occur in foul territory beyond first or third base, or
* Touches the person of an umpire or player, or any object foreign to the natural ground, while on or over foul territory. By interpretation, a batted ball that touches a batter while in his batter&#x27;s box is foul regardless of whether it is over foul territory.

The entirety of the batted ball must be on or over foul territory in order to be adjudged foul in the above situations; otherwise it is a fair ball that forces the batter to attempt to reach first base. 

A foul fly shall be judged according to the relative position of the ball and the foul line, including the foul pole, and not as to whether the fielder is on foul or fair territory at the time he touches the ball. If the foul ball gets caught, then it would be judged as an out.

Additionally, ballpark ground rules may specify that batted balls striking certain fixed objects such as railings, nets, or a roof if present are foul balls. 

== Overview ==

Foul territory or foul ground is defined as that part of the playing field outside the first and third base lines extended to the fence and perpendicularly upwards. Note: the foul lines and foul poles are not part of foul territory.

In general, when a batted ball is ruled a foul ball, the ball is dead, all runners must return to their time-of-pitch base without liability to be put out, and the batter returns to home plate to continue his turn at bat. A strike is issued for the batter if he had fewer than two strikes. If the batter already has two strikes against him when he hits a foul ball, a strike is not issued unless the ball was bunted to become a foul ball, in which case a third strike &quot;is&quot; issued and a strikeout recorded for the batter and pitcher. A strike is, however, recorded for the pitcher for every foul ball the batter hits, regardless of the count. If any member of the fielding team catches a foul ball before it touches the ground or lands outside the field perimeter, the batter is out. However, the caught ball is in play and base runners may attempt to advance.

A foul ball is different from a foul tip, in which the ball makes contact with the bat, travels directly to the catcher&#x27;s hands, and is caught. In this case, the ball remains live and a strike is added to the batter&#x27;s count. A batter who hits a foul tip with two strikes on the count is out.

To aid umpires in determining whether balls hit over the fence are fair or foul, a tall foul pole is often erected at each corner of the outfield. A batted ball which hits the foul pole above the fence is &quot;never&quot; a foul ball, no matter where it is ultimately deflected off the pole, in this case a home run is automatically awarded to the batter.

In kickball, foul ball does not make a strike, but four foul balls make an out.

== History ==

=== Origin ===
The concept of foul territory was not always present in historical versions of baseball. John Thorn, the Official Baseball Historian for Major League Baseball, speculates that the concept may have originated from single wicket cricket, with its rule of halving the area that the ball could be hit in when there were less than five fielders. The 1845 Knickerbocker Rules, which laid the foundation for modern baseball, also included the concept of foul territory due to a need to adapt the game when there not enough players; according to Thorn, even home runs were potentially considered foul in this set of rules, since losing the club&#x27;s only ball in the nearby Hudson River would prematurely end the game.

Originally, any ball that landed in fair territory was called fair, even if it went foul before leaving the infield. These &quot;fair fouls&quot; led to first and third basemen being forced to play closer to the foul lines, leading to calls for ten-person baseball teams. Fair fouls were amended out of the game before the 20th century.

=== Modern history ===
Until the 1920s, Major League Baseball spectators were often ejected if they attempted to keep foul balls, and teams employed security guards to ensure it. Factors such as negative public sentiment, a decrease in the cost of baseballs relative to team revenues and increased pressure to discontinue use of worn, damaged and/or discolored baseballs (especially after the death of Ray Chapman) combined to persuade several teams to change their foul ball policies during this period; the New York Giants changed theirs after losing a New York Supreme Court case (&quot;Reuben Berman vs. National Exhibition Co.&quot;) filed by Reuben Berman. Berman, a businessman, was ejected in 1921 after tossing a foul ball he caught into the stands.

==Strategies==

Depending on the exact situation, a foul ball may be considered beneficial to the offense or the defense.

When there are zero or one strikes, a foul ball counts as a strike, benefiting the pitcher. However, a foul ball may reveal to the batter that he has timed a pitch well and need only make adjustment to the location of his swing on the next such pitch; this is often called a &quot;good cut&quot; or simply a good swing. Foul balls with two strikes are generally considered positive for the batter, since he thus avoids strike three on a potentially difficult pitch. Also, foul balls with two strikes increase the pitcher&#x27;s pitch count, adding to his/her fatigue, thus providing some small advantage to the offense.

A strategy of swinging on any ball to try to produce additional fouls and prolong an at-bat is often used against strong pitchers to try to drive them from the game sooner (and also the possibility of the pitcher throwing a pitch a hitter can get a hit on); this does, however, have the disadvantage of generating more strikeouts.

In very specific circumstance—such as in the bottom of the ninth inning (or later) of a tie game when a runner is on third base with less than two outs—outfielders may intentionally not catch deep fly balls in foul territory, as catching such a ball would create a sacrifice fly, potentially allowing the winning run to score.

<text>Digital Video Broadcasting - Satellite - Second Generation (DVB-S2) is a digital television broadcast standard that has been designed as a successor for the popular DVB-S system. It was developed in 2003 by the Digital Video Broadcasting Project, an international industry consortium, and ratified by ETSI (EN 302307) in March 2005. The standard is based on, and improves upon DVB-S and the electronic news-gathering (or Digital Satellite News Gathering) system, used by mobile units for sending sounds and images from remote locations worldwide back to their home television stations.

DVB-S2 is designed for broadcast services including standard and HDTV, interactive services including Internet access, and (professional) data content distribution. The development of DVB-S2 coincided with the introduction of HDTV and H.264 (MPEG-4 AVC) video codecs.

Two new key features that were added compared to the DVB-S standard are:
* A powerful coding scheme based on a modern LDPC code. For low encoding complexity, the LDPC codes chosen have a special structure, also known as Irregular Repeat-Accumulate codes. 
* VCM (Variable Coding and Modulation) and ACM (Adaptive Coding and Modulation) modes, which allow optimizing bandwidth utilization by dynamically changing transmission parameters.

Other features include enhanced modulation schemes up to 32APSK, additional code rates, and the introduction of a generic transport mechanism for IP packet data including MPEG-4 audio–video streams, while supporting backward compatibility with existing MPEG-2 TS based transmission.

DVB-S2 achieves significantly better performance than its predecessors – mainly allowing for an increase of available bitrate over the same satellite transponder bandwidth. The measured DVB-S2 performance gain over DVB-S is around 30% at the same satellite transponder bandwidth and emitted signal power. When the contribution of improvements in video compression is added, an (MPEG-4 AVC) HDTV service can now be delivered in the same bandwidth that supported an early DVB-S based MPEG-2 SDTV service only a decade before.

In March 2014, DVB-S2X specification has been published by DVB Project as an optional extension adding further improvements.

== Main features ==
* Direct input of one or more MPEG-2 Transport Streams (TS). MPEG-TS is supported using a compatibility mode.
* The native stream format for DVB-S2 is called Generic Stream (GS), and can be used to efficiently carry IP-based data, including MPEG-4 AVC/H.264 services.
* Backward compatibility to DVB-S, intended for end users, and DVB-DSNG, used for backhauls and electronic news gathering.
* Variable coding and modulation (VCM) to optimize bandwidth utilization based on the priority of the input data; e.g., SDTV could be delivered using a more robust setting than the corresponding HDTV service.
* Adaptive coding and modulation (ACM) to allow flexibly adapting transmission parameters to the reception conditions of terminals, e.g., switching to a lower code rate during fading.
* Four modulation modes:
** QPSK and 8PSK are proposed for broadcast applications, and can be used in non-linear transponders driven near to saturation.
** 16APSK and 32APSK are used mainly for professional, semi-linear applications, but can also be used for broadcasting though they require a higher level of available C/N and an adoption of advanced pre-distortion methods in the uplink station in order to minimize the effect of transponder nonlinearity.
* Improved rolloff: α = 0.20 and α = 0.25 in addition to the roll-off of DVB-S α = 0.35.
* Improved coding: a modern large LDPC code is concatenated with an outer BCH code to achieve quasi-error-free (QEF) reception conditions on an AWGN channel. The outer code is introduced to avoid error floors at low bit-error rates. A single forward error correction or FEC frame may have either 64,800 bits (normal) or 16,200 bits (short). If VCM or ACM is used, the broadcast can be a combination of normal and short frames.
* Several code rates for flexible configuration of transmission parameters: 1/4, 1/3, 2/5, 1/2, 3/5, 2/3, 3/4, 4/5, 5/6, 6/7, 8/9, and 9/10. Code rates 1/4, 1/3, and 2/5 have been introduced for exceptionally poor reception conditions in combination with QPSK modulation. Encoding values 8/9 and 9/10 behave poorly under marginal link conditions (where the signal level is below the noise level). However, with targeted spot Ku or Ka band downlinks these code rates may be recommended to prevent out-of-region viewing for copyright or cultural reasons.
* Optional input stream synchronization to provide a constant end-to-end delay.

Depending on code rate and modulation, the system can operate at a C/N between −2.4 dB (QPSK, 1/4) and 16 dB (32APSK, 9/10) with a quasi-error free goal of a 10−7 TS packet error rate. Distance to the Shannon limit ranges from 0.7 dB to 1.2 dB.

Modes and features of DVB-S2 in comparison to DVB-S:
== Use cases ==

Envisaged scenarios for DVB-S2 by the standard document are:

* Broadcasting television services in SDTV or HDTV. Optionally, this transmission may be backwards compatible with DVB-S, but does not benefit from the 30% extra bandwidth.
* Interactive services including Internet access. Data generated by the user may be sent by cable (copper/fibre optic), mobile wireless, or satellite uplink (DVB-RCS).
* Professional applications, where data must be multiplexed in real time and then broadcast in the VHF/UHF band (e.g., digital TV contribution, satellite news gathering). These transmissions are not intended for the average viewer.
* Large-scale data content distribution. These include point-to-point and multicast services, as well as transmission to head-ends for (re-)distribution over other media.

== Improvements over DVB-S ==
DVB-S2 is 30% more efficient than DVB-S. It allows a wider range of applications combining DVB-S features (for household tasks), and DVB-DSNG (for professional tasks). DVB-S2 can adapt codification to maximize satellites resources value. It is compatible with last generation.

The main disadvantage, there are many millions of devices deployed using DVB-S over the world which has to be upgraded.

The next table compares both standards.
== The DVB-S to DVB-S2 upgrade process ==
The conversion process from DVB-S to DVB-S2 is being accelerated, due to the rapid increase of HDTV and introduction of 3D-HDTV. The main factor slowing down this process is the need to replace or upgrade set-top boxes, or acquire TVs with DVB-S2 integrated tuners, which makes the transition slower for established operators.

Current direct-to-home broadcasters using DVB-S2 are:

<doc id="833399" wikidata="Q1141278" url="?curid=833399" title="Fair ball">
<text>In baseball, a fair ball is a batted ball that entitles the batter to attempt to reach first base. By contrast, a foul ball is a batted ball that does not entitle the batter to attempt to reach first base. Whether a batted ball is fair or foul is determined by the location of the ball at the appropriate reference point, as follows:

* if the ball leaves the playing field without touching anything, the point where the ball leaves the field;
* otherwise, if the ball first lands past first or third base without touching anything, the point where the ball lands;
* otherwise, if the ball rolls or bounces past first or third base without touching anything other than the ground, the point where the ball passes the base;
* otherwise, if the ball touches anything other than the ground (such as an umpire, a player, or any equipment left on the field) before any of the above happens, the point of such touching;
* otherwise, (the ball comes to a rest before reaching first or third base), the point where the ball comes to a rest.

If any part of the ball is on or above fair territory at the appropriate reference point, it is fair; otherwise, it is foul. Fair territory or fair ground is defined as the area of the playing field between the two foul lines, and includes the foul lines themselves and the foul poles. However, certain exceptions exist:

* A ball that touches first, second, or third base is always fair.
* Under Rule 5.09(a)(7)-(8), if a batted ball touches the batter or his bat while the batter is in the batter&#x27;s box and not intentionally interfering with the course of the ball, the ball is foul.
* A ball that hits the foul pole without first having touched anything else off the bat is fair.
* Ground rules may provide whether a ball hitting specific objects (e.g. roof, overhead speaker) is fair or foul.

On a fair ball, the batter attempts to reach first base or any subsequent base, runners attempt to advance and fielders try to record outs. A fair ball is considered a live ball until the ball becomes dead by leaving the field or any other method.

<doc id="833412" wikidata="Q906544" url="?curid=833412" title="Power semiconductor device">
<text>A power semiconductor device is a semiconductor device used as a switch or rectifier in power electronics (for example in a switch-mode power supply). Such a device is also called a power device or, when used in an integrated circuit, a power IC.

A power semiconductor device is usually used in &quot;commutation mode&quot; (i.e., it is either on or off), and therefore has a design optimized for such usage; it should usually not be used in linear operation. Linear power circuits are widespread as voltage regulators, audio amplifiers, and radio frequency amplifiers.

Power semiconductors are found in systems delivering as little as a few tens of milliwatts for a headphone amplifier, up to around a gigawatt in a high voltage direct current transmission line.

==History==

The first electronic device used in power circuits was the electrolytic rectifier - an early version was described by a French experimenter, A. Nodon, in 1904. These were briefly popular with early radio experimenters as they could be improvised from aluminum sheets, and household chemicals. They had low withstand voltages and limited efficiency.

The first solid-state power semiconductor devices were copper oxide rectifiers, used in early battery chargers and power supplies for radio equipment, announced in 1927 by L.O. Grundahl and P. H. Geiger.

The first germanium power semiconductor device appeared in 1952 with the introduction of the power diode by R.N. Hall. It had a reverse voltage blocking capability of 200 V and a current rating of 35 A.

Germanium bipolar transistors with substantial power handling capabilities (100 mA collector current) were introduced around 1952; with essentially the same construction as signal devices, but better heat sinking. Power handling capability evolved rapidly, and by 1954 germanium alloy junction transistors with 100 watt dissipation were available. These were all relatively low-frequency devices, used up to around 100 kHz, and up to 85 degrees Celsius junction temperature. Silicon power transistors were not made until 1957, but when available had better frequency response than germanium devices, and could operate up to 150 C junction temperature.

The thyristor appeared in 1957. It is able to withstand very high reverse breakdown voltage and is also capable of carrying high current. However, one disadvantage of the thyristor in switching circuits is that once it becomes &#x27;latched-on&#x27; in the conducting state; it cannot be turned off by external control, as the thyristor turn-off is passive, i.e., the power must be disconnected from the device. Thyristors which could be turned off, called gate turn-off thyristors (GTO), were introduced in 1960. These overcome some limitations of the ordinary thyristor, because they can be turned on or off with an applied signal.

=== Power MOSFET ===

The MOSFET was invented at Bell Labs between 1955 and 1960 Generations of MOSFET transistors enabled power designers to achieve performance and density levels not possible with bipolar transistors. Due to improvements in MOSFET technology (initially used to produce integrated circuits), the power MOSFET became available in the 1970s.

In 1969, Hitachi introduced the first vertical power MOSFET, which would later be known as the VMOS (V-groove MOSFET). From 1974, Yamaha, JVC, Pioneer Corporation, Sony and Toshiba began manufacturing audio amplifiers with power MOSFETs. International Rectifier introduced a 25 A, 400 V power MOSFET in 1978. This device allows operation at higher frequencies than a bipolar transistor, but is limited to low voltage applications.

The Insulated-gate bipolar transistor (IGBT) was developed in the 1980s, and became widely available in the 1990s. This component has the power handling capability of the bipolar transistor and the advantages of the isolated gate drive of the power MOSFET.

== Common devices ==

Some common power devices are the power MOSFET, power diode, thyristor, and IGBT. The power diode and power MOSFET operate on similar principles to their low-power counterparts, but are able to carry a larger amount of current and are typically able to withstand a larger reverse-bias voltage in the &quot;off-state&quot;.

Structural changes are often made in a power device in order to accommodate the higher current density, higher power dissipation, and/or higher reverse breakdown voltage. The vast majority of the discrete (i.e., non-integrated) power devices are built using a vertical structure, whereas small-signal devices employ a lateral structure. With the vertical structure, the current rating of the device is proportional to its area, and the voltage blocking capability is achieved in the height of the die. With this structure, one of the connections of the device is located on the bottom of the semiconductor die.

The power MOSFET is the most common power device in the world, due to its low gate drive power, fast switching speed, and advanced paralleling capability. It has a wide range of power electronic applications, such as portable information appliances, power integrated circuits, cell phones, notebook computers, and the communications infrastructure that enables the Internet. As of 2010, the power MOSFET accounts for the majority (53%) of the power transistor market, followed by the IGBT (27%), then the RF amplifier (11%), and then the bipolar junction transistor (9%).

== Solid-state devices ==
== Classifications ==

A power device may be classified as one of the following main categories (see figure 1):
* A two-terminal device (e.g., a diode), whose state is completely dependent on the external power circuit to which it is connected.
* A three-terminal device (e.g., a triode), whose state is dependent on not only its external power circuit, but also the signal on its driving terminal (this terminal is known as the &quot;gate&quot; or &quot;base&quot;).
* A four terminal device (e.g. Silicon Controlled Switch -SCS). SCS is a type of thyristor having four layers and four terminals called anode, anode gate, cathode gate and cathode. the terminals are connected to the first, second, third and fourth layer respectively.

Another classification is less obvious, but has a strong influence on device performance:
* A &quot;majority carrier device&quot; (e.g., a Schottky diode, a MOSFET, etc.); this uses only one type of charge carriers.
* A &quot;minority carrier device&quot; (e.g., a thyristor, a bipolar transistor, an IGBT, etc.); this uses both majority and minority carriers (i.e., electrons and electron holes).
A majority carrier device is faster, but the charge injection of minority carrier devices allows for better on-state performance.

===Diodes===

An ideal diode should have the following characteristics:
* When &quot;forward-biased&quot;, the voltage across the end terminals of the diode should be zero, no matter the current that flows through it (on-state).
* When &quot;reverse-biased&quot;, the leakage current should be zero, no matter the voltage (off-state).
* The transition (or commutation) between the on-state and the off-state should be instantaneous.
In reality, the design of a diode is a trade-off between performance in on-state, off-state, and commutation. Indeed, the same area of the device must sustain the blocking voltage in the off-state and allow current flow in the on-state; as the requirements for the two states are completely opposite, a diode has to be either optimised for one of them, or time must be allowed to switch from one state to the other (i.e., the commutation speed must be reduced).

These trade-offs are the same for all power devices; for instance, a Schottky diode has excellent switching speed and on-state performance, but a high level of leakage current in the off-state. On the other hand, a PIN diode is commercially available in different commutation speeds (what are called &quot;fast&quot; and &quot;ultrafast&quot; rectifiers), but any increase in speed is necessarily associated with a lower performance in the on-state.

===Switches===

The trade-offs between voltage, current, and frequency ratings also exist for a switch. In fact, any power semiconductor relies on a PIN diode structure in order to sustain voltage; this can be seen in figure 2. The power MOSFET has the advantages of a majority carrier device, so it can achieve a very high operating frequency, but it cannot be used with high voltages; as it is a physical limit, no improvement is expected in the design of a silicon MOSFET concerning its maximum voltage ratings. However, its excellent performance in low voltage applications make it the device of choice (actually the only choice, currently) for applications with voltages below 200 V. By placing several devices in parallel, it is possible to increase the current rating of a switch. The MOSFET is particularly suited to this configuration, because its positive thermal coefficient of resistance tends to result in a balance of current between the individual devices.

The IGBT is a recent component, so its performance improves regularly as technology evolves. It has already completely replaced the bipolar transistor in power applications; a power module is available in which several IGBT devices are connected in parallel, making it attractive for power levels up to several megawatts, which pushes further the limit at which thyristors and GTOs become the only option. Basically, an IGBT is a bipolar transistor driven by a power MOSFET; it has the advantages of being a minority carrier device (good performance in the on-state, even for high voltage devices), with the high input impedance of a MOSFET (it can be driven on or off with a very low amount of power).

The major limitation of the IGBT for low voltage applications is the high voltage drop it exhibits in the on-state (2-to-4 V). Compared to the MOSFET, the operating frequency of the IGBT is relatively low (usually not higher than 50 kHz), mainly because of a problem during turn-off known as &quot;current-tail&quot;: The slow decay of the conduction current during turn-off results from a slow recombination of a large number of carriers that flood the thick &#x27;drift&#x27; region of the IGBT during conduction. The net result is that the turn-off of an IGBT is considerably higher than its turn-on loss. Generally, in datasheets, turn-off energy is mentioned as a measured parameter; that number has to be multiplied with the switching frequency of the intended application in order to estimate the turn-off loss.

At very high power levels, a thyristor-based device (e.g., a SCR, a GTO, a MCT, etc.) is still often used. This device can be turned on by a pulse provided by a driving circuit, but cannot be turned off by removing the pulse. A thyristor turns off as soon as no more current flows through it; this happens automatically in an alternating current system on each cycle, or requires a circuit with the means to divert current around the device. Both MCTs and GTOs have been developed to overcome this limitation, and are widely used in power distribution applications.

A few applications of power semiconductors in switch mode include lamp dimmers, switch mode power supplies, induction cookers, automotive ignition systems, and AC and DC electric motor drives of all sizes.

===Amplifiers===
Amplifiers operate in the active region, where both device current and voltage are non-zero. Consequently power is continually dissipated and its design is dominated by the need to remove excess heat from the semiconductor device. Power amplifier devices can often be recognized by the heat sink used to mount the devices. Multiple types of power semiconductor amplifier device exist, such as the bipolar junction transistor, the vertical MOS field effect transistor, and others. Power levels for individual amplifier devices range up to hundreds of watts, and frequency limits range up to the lower microwave bands. A complete audio power amplifier, with two channels and a power rating on the order of tens of watts, can be put into a small integrated circuit package, needing only a few external passive components to function. 
Another important application for active-mode amplifiers is in linear regulated power supplies, when an amplifier device is used as a voltage regulator to maintain load voltage at a desired setting. While such a power supply may be less energy efficient than a switched mode power supply, the simplicity of application makes them popular, especially in current ranges up to about one amp.

== Parameters ==

#Breakdown voltage: Often, there is a trade-off between breakdown voltage rating and on-resistance, because increasing the breakdown voltage by incorporating a thicker and lower doped drift region leads to a higher on-resistance.
#On-resistance: A higher current rating lowers the on-resistance due to greater numbers of parallel cells. This increases overall capacitance and slows down the speed.
#Rise and fall times: The amount of time it takes to switch between the on-state and the off-state.
#Safe-operating area: This is a thermal dissipation and &quot;latch-up&quot; consideration.
#Thermal resistance: This is an often ignored but extremely important parameter from the point of view of practical design; a semiconductor does not perform well at elevated temperature, and yet due to large current conduction, a power semiconductor device invariably heats up. Therefore, such a devices needs to be cooled by removing that heat continuously; packaging and heatsink technology provide a means for removing heat from a semiconductor device by conducting it to the external environment. Generally, a large current device has a large die and packaging surface areas and lower thermal resistance.

==Research and development==

===Packaging===

The role of packaging is to:
* connect a die to the external circuit.
* provide a way to remove the heat generated by the device.
* protect the die from the external environment (moisture, dust, etc.).

Many of the reliability issues of a power device are either related to excessive temperature or fatigue due to thermal cycling. Research is currently carried out on the following topics:
* Cooling performance.
* Resistance to thermal cycling by closely matching the Coefficient of thermal expansion of the packaging to that of the silicon.
* The maximum operating temperature of the packaging material.

Research is also ongoing on electrical issues such as reducing the parasitic inductance of packaging; this inductance limits the operating frequency, because it generates losses during commutation.

A low-voltage MOSFET is also limited by the parasitic resistance of its package, as its intrinsic on-state resistance is as low as one or two milliohms.

Some of the most common type of power semiconductor packages include the TO-220, TO-247, TO-262, TO-3, D2Pak, etc.

===Improvement of structures===

The IGBT design is still under development and can be expected to provide increases in operating voltages. At the high-power end of the range, the MOS-controlled thyristor is a promising device. Achieving a major improvement over the conventional MOSFET structure by employing the super junction charge-balance principle: essentially, it allows the thick drift region of a power MOSFET to be heavily doped, thereby reducing the electrical resistance to electron flow without compromising the breakdown voltage. This is juxtaposed with a region that is similarly doped with the opposite carrier polarity (&quot;holes&quot;); these two similar, but oppositely doped regions effectively cancel out their mobile charge and develop a &#x27;depleted region&#x27; that supports the high voltage during the off-state. On the other hand, during the on-state, the higher doping of the drift region allows for the easy flow of carriers, thereby reducing on-resistance. Commercial devices, based on this super junction principle, have been developed by companies like Infineon (CoolMOS products) and International Rectifier (IR).

===Wide band-gap semiconductors===

The major breakthrough in power semiconductor devices is expected from the replacement of silicon by a wide band-gap semiconductor. At the moment, silicon carbide (SiC) is considered to be the most promising. A SiC Schottky diode with a breakdown voltage of 1200 V is commercially available, as is a 1200 V JFET. As both are majority carrier devices, they can operate at high speed. A bipolar device is being developed for higher voltages (up to 20 kV). Among its advantages, silicon carbide can operate at a higher temperature (up to 400 °C) and has a lower thermal resistance than silicon, allowing for better cooling.

<text>William Farel (1489 – 13 September 1565), Guilhem Farel or [[Guillaume (given name)|Guillaume]] Farel (), was a French evangelist, Protestant reformer and a founder of the Calvinist Church in the Principality of Neuchâtel, in the Republic of Geneva, and in Switzerland in the Canton of Bern and the (then occupied by Bern) Canton of Vaud. He is most often remembered for having persuaded John Calvin to remain in Geneva in 1536, and for persuading him to return there in 1541, after their expulsion in 1538. They influenced the government of Geneva to the point that it became the &quot;Protestant Rome&quot;, where Protestants took refuge and dissidents such as Catholics and unitarians were driven out; some of the Catholics and Unitarians were even killed for their beliefs. Together with Calvin, Farel worked to train missionary preachers who spread the Protestant cause to other countries, and especially to France.

== Life ==
Farel was born in 1489 in Gap. He was a pupil of the pro-reform Catholic priesthood, at the University of Paris, in the earliest years of the Reformation. There he met the scholar Jacques Lefevre d&#x27;Etaples who helped Farel obtain a professorship to teach grammar and philosophy at the Collège Cardinal Lemoine in Paris. With Lefevre he became a member of the &quot;Cercle de Meaux&quot; gathered together from 1519 by the reform-minded bishop of Meaux, Guillaume Briçonnet. Farel soon became regent of the college. By 1522 he was appointed a diocesan preacher by the bishop. Farel now could invite a number of Evangelical humanists to work in his diocese to help implement his reform program within the Catholic Church.

This group of humanists also included Josse van Clichtove, Martial Mazurier, Gérard Roussel, and François Vatable. The members of the Meaux circle were of different talents but they generally emphasized the study of the Bible and a return to the theology of the early Church. While working with Lefevre in Meaux, Farel came under the influence of Lutheran ideas and became an avid promoter of them. After condemnation by the Sorbonne, Farel evangelized fervently in the Dauphiné. Although Farel later became a friend and ally of John Calvin, he had been a promoter of Lutheran ideas in his youth.

Farel was forced to flee to Switzerland because of controversy that was aroused by his writings against the use of images in Christian worship. In 1524, while in Basel, he wrote thirteen theses sharply criticizing Roman doctrine, but his argument was so heated that even Erasmus joined in the demand for his expulsion. He went on to Strasbourg and later Montbéliard, but was again forced to leave. Eventually he spent time at Zürich with Huldrych Zwingli and back at Strasbourg, with Martin Bucer. Finally given license to preach anywhere in the Canton of Bern, he convinced Neuchâtel to join the Reform in 1530.

Farel established himself in Geneva in 1532, where he remained as minister, drawing Calvin to the city, but breaking with him over the Eucharist. Resistance from the established authority led to a brief period of banishment but the Bern government again granted him liberty of worship and he was able to return to preaching. However, the struggle was not over and Farel, along with Calvin, was banished from Geneva in 1538, in part for his rigorous positions, and retired to Neuchâtel. There he spent the rest of his life, and was frequently consulted by Calvin.

In 1558, when he was sixty-nine, Farel married Marie Thorel, who was a teenager. Scott Manetsch notes that Calvin was &quot;flabbergasted and irate&quot; at the marriage, &quot;fearing that his friend&#x27;s scandalous action would inflict irreparable damage on the cause of the Reformation throughout Europe.&quot; The couple did have a son six years later, although he died in infancy. In his final year, after Calvin&#x27;s death, Farel visited Metz and preached with all his old fire, but the effort seemed to have exhausted him and he died while still in Metz. A monument to him was unveiled at Neuchâtel on 4 May 1876.

<doc id="833440" wikidata="Q551989" url="?curid=833440" title="Mastermind (Jason Wyngarde)">
<text>Mastermind (Jason Wyngarde) is a supervillain appearing in American comic books published by Marvel Comics, commonly as an adversary of the X-Men. The original Mastermind was a mutant with the psionic ability to generate complex telepathic illusions at will that cause his victims to see whatever he wishes them to see. He was a founding member of the first Brotherhood of Evil Mutants and later a probationary member of the Lords Cardinal of the Hellfire Club, where he played an important role in &quot;The Dark Phoenix Saga&quot;.

After Wyngarde&#x27;s death from the Legacy Virus, his three daughters appeared: two possessing his illusion-creating abilities, Mastermind (Martinique Jason) and Lady Mastermind (Regan Wyngarde), and the X-Man Pixie.

==Publication history==
Created by writer Stan Lee and artist/co-writer Jack Kirby, he first appeared in &quot;The X-Men&quot; #4 (March 1964). He was given his &quot;real name&quot; of Jason Wyngarde by Chris Claremont and John Byrne.

The name and visual appearance of Jason Wyngarde as he appears in the Dark Phoenix Saga and later stories was originally based by artist John Byrne on that of British actor Peter Wyngarde, best known for playing Jason King, and who also played the leader of the Hellfire Club in an episode of &quot;The Avengers&quot;.

==Fictional character biography==
Nothing is known of Jason Wyngarde&#x27;s life before joining the Brotherhood of Evil Mutants, except that he was a carnival mentalist. With Mastermind&#x27;s help, the Brotherhood takes over Santo Marco, a fictional South American country, with an illusion of thousands of soldiers. However, the X-Men free the country, as Professor X sees through Mastermind&#x27;s illusions, helping the X-Men when they believe they are trapped by a wall of flame. As a member of the Brotherhood of Evil Mutants, he participates in repeated clashes with the X-Men. He attempts to court his teammate Scarlet Witch, but his advances seem driven more by an unsatisfied need for love than by any true feelings for her, and she repeatedly spurns him. The Brotherhood attempts to lure the Stranger to their cause, but the Stranger temporarily turns Mastermind into solid matter.
After the spell wears off, Mastermind joins Factor Three, an organization that attempts to conquer the Earth. Factor Three eventually disbands when their leader turns out to be an alien, instead of a mutant. They team with the X-Men to defeat the alien Mutant Master. Mastermind is then captured by Sentinels, but freed by the X-Men. Former members of Factor Three, Blob and Unus, join with Mastermind to reform the Brotherhood of Evil Mutants.

Mastermind attempts to recruit Beast to his group, but fails and winds up battling him instead. Mastermind is briefly held captive by the second Secret Empire. Magneto returns to the Brotherhood to resume his leadership and creates Alpha the Ultimate Mutant. The Brotherhood of Evil Mutants battle the Defenders, but Alpha turns the entire Brotherhood team into infants.

After being restored to adulthood, Mastermind becomes involved with the Hellfire Club, who conspire to capture the X-Men for their own uses. He initially poses as Nikos, and begins a romance with Phoenix. Then, he manipulates her through the use of his own powers and a mind-tap mechanism created by Emma Frost, which he uses to project his illusion directly into her mind, causing her to believe she is living out the life of a Victorian aristocrat who was married to Jason Wyngarde (Mastermind), and was the Black Queen of the Hellfire Club. This turns her against the X-Men. Cyclops attempts to free Phoenix on the astral plane, but Mastermind confronts him there and soundly defeats him. Instead of binding Phoenix to him forever, as Mastermind had hoped, the shock of Scott&#x27;s psychic &quot;death&quot; breaks her free from his control. Enraged at what he did to her, Phoenix reaches into his mind and makes him experience godhood for a moment. This experience leaves him catatonic.

When Mastermind recovers his sanity, he seeks revenge on everyone that caused him pain. He strikes down Emma Frost, leaving her comatose. He unbalances Rogue&#x27;s shared psyche with Carol Danvers, prompting her to leave Mystique, while using an induced nightmare on Mystique to let her know he is responsible. Next, since Phoenix is dead, he decides to use those closest to her as proxies for his revenge. He disrupts Wolverine&#x27;s wedding by psionically compelling his betrothed, Mariko Yashida, to reject him and open up dealings with the criminal underworld. He manipulates the X-Men into thinking Cyclops&#x27;s fiancée, Madelyne Pryor, is the reincarnation of Dark Phoenix, hoping to goad them into killing her before he reveals the truth. However, Cyclops recognizes the patterns of Mastermind&#x27;s power, and the X-Men defeat him in a short battle. Mastermind later seeks to tap into the power of the Phoenix Force, but is defeated by Rachel Summers and Excalibur. He is imprisoned with the delusion that he achieved cosmic awareness.

Mastermind later dies of the Legacy Virus. Before he succumbs, he asks Jean Grey&#x27;s forgiveness for what he did to her in an attempt to gain control of the almighty Phoenix Force within her. She forgives him and he dies peacefully after using his final act to save Jean Grey from dying alongside him.

After his death, Mastermind appeared in a flashback sequence that revealed that he was paid by the supervillain known as &quot;the General&quot; to put one of his illusions into the mind of Sentry, making the Sentry &quot;...so scared to use his powers, [That] he&#x27;ll think the world will be attacked by the devil if he does.&quot; This would make Mastermind responsible for the creation of the Void itself, the evil counterpart of the Sentry who is actually the manifestation of the inhibitions that Mastermind implanted in the Sentry to prevent him from using his powers.

He would appear again in a flashback sequence when Lorna Dane discovered that she was the one responsible for the accident that killed her parents. Magneto, who had been drawn to the location of the accident by her magnetic pulse, had Mastermind use his illusionary powers to re-write Lorna&#x27;s memories of that day, since he believed that she was not ready for her abilities or the life he could offer her, leaving her to believe that her parents died in a plane crash when she was an infant.

Joseph is resurrected under unknown circumstances and forms a new Brotherhood of Mutants with Astra and mutated deformed versions of Blob, Mastermind, Quicksilver, Scarlet Witch, and Toad, all actually clones created by Joseph.

During the &quot;Empyre&quot; storyline, Mastermind is among the mutants that were revived and residing on Krakoa. When Magik calls for the psychic mutants to come to Genosha and deal with a Cotati seed pod that is weak against psychic attacks, Mastermind is among the psychic mutants that answer the call. He is among those who witness Magik&#x27;s fight with the Cotatinaught.

== Characteristics ==
=== Powers and abilities ===
Mastermind has the mutant ability to cast exceptionally realistic psionic illusions. He can psionically cause other people to see, hear, feel, smell, and taste things that do not actually exist. For example, he can make himself look and sound like a different person, or look and feel like a wall, or even seem invisible. He can use his powers to duplicate himself. The range of Mastermind&#x27;s powers is wide enough to affect an entire city. He is even capable of affecting telepaths as powerful as Professor X and Jean Grey, although to manipulate Dark Phoenix he required an amplifying device called a &quot;mind-tap mechanism&quot; provided by the White Queen that enabled him to project illusions directly into the entity&#x27;s mind, so that the entity &quot;saw&quot; them, and to monitor the entity&#x27;s thoughts, both over great distances.

=== Family ===
Mastermind&#x27;s name and powers still live on through his daughters: Martinique Jason and Regan Wyngarde. Both appear to be stronger than the original Mastermind; Martinique can create citywide illusions that even hypnotize people to believe they are in a whole new era and Regan&#x27;s lethal illusions can continue even after she has been rendered unconscious.

In the second issue of &quot;X-Men: Pixie Strikes Back&quot;, the mother of X-Man Pixie, Mrs. Gwynn, teleports herself to the Wyngarde Mansion, where Regan is fighting with Martinique and reveals Pixie is their half-sister. Teaming up with Mrs. Gwynn who offers the sisters power in exchange for their help, they attempt to track down Pixie after being kidnapped by Saturnine. During the final confrontation with the demon, Pixie teleports both Regan and Martinique away when X-23 attempts to attack them.

<text>In baseball, a foul tip is defined as &quot;a batted ball that goes sharp and direct from the bat to the catcher and is legally caught. It is not a foul tip unless caught, and any foul tip that is caught is a strike and the ball is &#x27;in play&#x27;.&quot;

A &quot;foul tip&quot; is not the same as a foul ball, although many people mistakenly use the term to refer to any pitch at which the batter swings and makes slight contact, regardless of whether it is caught by the catcher. However, the rules are very narrow: it is not a foul tip if the ball touches anything else on the way to the catcher&#x27;s hand or glove or if it is not legally caught and held. Anything else is technically a foul ball, including if the ball is caught after popping up into foul territory.

The rules treat a foul tip as equivalent in every respect to a pitch at which the batter swings and misses. 
* A &quot;foul tip&quot; is always a strike, meaning a player on two strikes is automatically out.
* The ball remains alive and runners may advance or be thrown out on the bases.

In contrast, a &quot;foul ball&quot; counts as a strike only if the batter does not already have two strikes against him/her, or if the batter incurred the foul ball on a bunt. Runners may not advance and must return to their bases without danger of being tagged out.

<doc id="833454" wikidata="Q45239" url="?curid=833454" title="Franz Xaver Kroetz">
<text>Franz Xaver Kroetz (; born 25 February 1946) is a German author, playwright, actor and film director. He achieved great success beginning in the early 1970s. &quot;Persistent&quot;, &quot;Farmyard&quot;, and &quot;Request Concert&quot;, all written in 1971, are some of the works conventionally associated with Kroetz.

Kroetz is part of a generation of playwrights who modified the critical folk-piece, emphasizing in his works of the early 1970s the underside of West Germany&#x27;s affluence through realistic portrayals of the lives of the poor. He later began writing for television, which led to a wider audience. His more analytical, Brecht-influenced plays were generally not well-received, though &quot;Upper Austria&quot; (1972) and &quot;The Nest&quot; (1974) achieved critical and commercial success. Some later works of social realism like &quot;Through the Leaves&quot; (1976) and &quot;Tom Fool&quot; (1978) are also highly regarded.

Kroetz&#x27;s plays have been translated and performed internationally. Simon Stephens argued in 2016, &quot;Kroetz was identifying how poverty can give rise to brutality, to cynicism, despair and fear. His plays are as resonant now as they&#x27;ve ever been.&quot;

==Life==
Kroetz was born in Munich and did poorly in high school. He attended an acting school in Munich and the Max-Reinhardt-Seminar in Vienna. He worked as a day-laborer. In the late 1960s, when he was unable to enter mainstream theater, he was active in the alternative theater scene in Munich, and also wrote and acted in works of the &quot;Bauerntheater&quot; (peasant farces with figures who act out stock situations). He became a member of the German Communist Party (DKP) in 1972, leaving in May 1980 when it had negligible political influence in West Germany.

He was affiliated with Suhrkamp Verlag until 1974, with his radical politics being problematic for the publisher. Kroetz admitted in a 1978 interview to being a somewhat combative person. Michael Toteborg wrote in 1978 that the best-known of the early plays are &quot;Wildwechsel&quot; (&quot;Game Crossing&quot; or &quot;Jailbait&quot;, 1968), &quot;Mannersache&quot; (&quot;Men&#x27;s Business&quot;, 1970), and &quot;Farmyard&quot;. He said that in &quot;Munich Child&quot; &quot;Kroetz [gives] a convincing political dimension to the private experiences of his characters.&quot; His plays in the 1970s portrayed people who had been rendered speechless by their own social misery. He has named Marieluise Fleißer as a major influence on his early writing, as well as Ödön von Horváth. He became famous when in 1971 the premiere of his plays &quot;Heimarbeit&quot; (translated as &quot;House-work&quot; or &quot;Houseworker&quot;) and &quot;Hartnäckig&quot; (&quot;Persistent&quot;) were disrupted by neo-fascists. &quot;Houseworker&quot; caused controversy for containing explicit scenes.

His later plays contain less violence and sexuality, and are more influenced by Bertolt Brecht. &quot;Oberösterreich&quot; (&quot;Upper Austria&quot;, 1972) and &quot;Das Nest&quot; (&quot;The Nest&quot;, 1974) garnered popular and critical acclaim. The former marked a shift from portraying (in Kroetz&#x27;s words) the &quot;milieu of the extreme&quot; to portraying average people who lack pent-up frutrations and communicate more effectively. Donna L. Hoffmeister wrote that the work &quot;was presented, according to my count, by forty different theaters between 1974 and 1976 and the play Das Nest (1974) by about twenty theaters in the 1976/77 season&quot;. In &quot;The Nest&quot;, the protagonist is a truck driver. His boss orders him to dump toxic waste into a lake, thus soiling his &quot;nest.&quot;

After the early plays, he tried writing works for television because he wanted to reach a wider audience, and his move to TV had this effect, with &quot;Maria Magdalena&quot; viewed by five to 15 million. The contemporary television fare cautioned through comedy against activism by workers, and Kroetz wished to refunction televisual &quot;Volkstheater&quot; for progressive aims. His works for television have been described as &quot;metacritiques of the television industry&quot; that thematize its detrimental impact on viewers. &quot;Das Nest&quot; was first produced for television in 1976, and aired in West Germany in 1979. &quot;Upper Austria&quot; was first broadcast in 1973. The broadcaster ZDF postponed &quot;Upper Austria&quot; for months due to its politics. Kroetz moved into social realism with &quot;Through the Leaves&quot; (1976) and &quot;Tom Fool&quot; (1978), the latter of which was a success. He considers &quot;Upper Austria&quot;, &quot;The Nest&quot;, and &quot;Tom Fool&quot; to form a trilogy.

He wrote a libretto based on his play &quot;Stallerhof&quot; (1971) for an opera of the same name which Gerd Kühr composed in 1987/88. It was premiered at the first Munich Biennale in 1988. The play was staged at the Burgtheater in 2010 by David Bösch.

In her book &quot;Franz Xaver Kroetz: The Construction of a Political Aesthetic&quot;, Michelle Mattson of the Columbia University summarizes: Franz Xaver Kroetz – banana-cutter, hospital orderly, fledgling actor and, more significantly, Germany&#x27;s most popular contemporary dramatist of the seventies and early eighties. This study, which situates Kroetz&#x27;s aesthetics in a political context, focuses on four plays that mark crisis points in his development of a political aesthetic.

Kroetz wrote for the television series Tatort, &quot;Spiel mit Karten&quot; in 1980 and &quot;Wolf im Schafspelz&quot; in 2002. He is also known for his role as the gossip columnist &#x27;Baby&#x27; Schimmerlos (roughly &#x27;Baby Clueless&#x27;) in the television series &quot;Kir Royal&quot;. His income from acting made writing without financial worries possible.

From 1992 to 2005, Kroetz was married to the actress Marie-Theres Relin. They have three children. As of 2011, Kroetz lived in the Chiemgau and on Tenerife.

Some of Kroetz&#x27;s plays have also been translated into French and performed in France.

==Style==
According to Holmberg, critics &quot;refer to Mr. Kroetz&#x27;s plays as constituting a drama of the inarticulate. The hallmark of his style is to draw characters unable to find the half-word they need to express sorrow or rage.&quot; The early plays of Kroetz also end violently. Mel Gussow describes Kroetz as reliant on words rather than images, and quotes the playwright as having been disturbed by the &quot;garrulity&quot; of most theater of the same time. Kroetz has also argued, &quot;A dramatist must be tough on his characters. Sentimentality is a trap, and it&#x27;s tempting because audiences love sentimental plays.&quot; The extreme naturalism of &quot;Request Concert&quot; has led to retrospective comparisons of it with Chantal Akerman&#x27;s film &quot;Jeanne Dielman, 23 quai du Commerce, 1080 Bruxelles&quot; (1975), and also with Marsha Norman&#x27;s &quot;&#x27;night, Mother&quot; (1983). Gautam Dasgupta has compared him to David Storey and Rainer W. Fassbinder, and also stated that his plays are &quot;structured around cliches in the manner of Ionesco&quot;. &quot;Tom Fool&quot; has been compared to Harold Pinter&#x27;s play &quot;The Homecoming&quot; for its depiction of a decomposing family.

Susan L. Cocalis writes that early on Kroetz does not give readers a way to &quot;locate the events on stage in a hypothetical framework and thus gain some distance to the action. He does not even bother to supply any discernible criteria for identifying the good and the evil, for in these plays a just order of the universe [...] simply does not exist.&quot; She also sees Kroetz as implying that the material interests of the family unit determine the code of normative sexuality.

These plays have been described as impacting audiences primarily through compassion, and after 1972 he moved to a more analytical form of political drama about broader economic issues. Kroetz has referred to the early works as &quot;descriptive realism&quot; and the later works as &quot;analytic realism&quot; or &quot;engaged realism&quot;. &quot;Sterntaler&quot; and &quot;Heimat&quot; include film clips of workplaces, and socially critical songs by workers. According to Craig Decker, Kroetz in his television works dramatizes how TV can constrain viewer consciousness; the playwright hopes to create people who break away from commercial culture and act as citizens rather than consumers. Gérard Thiériot divided his mainstream work into three phases: up to 1972, 1972–1980, and 1980 onward. &quot;The Nest&quot; has been called a morality play, and different from most of the works in the second phase. Rolf-Peter Carl, in &quot;Franz Xaver Kroetz&quot; (1978), divides his works into those before 1972, an &quot;experimental&quot; phase (1972–73), and those since 1974.

In a 1996 article about &quot;Bauern sterben&quot; (1985), Moray McGowan wrote that Bavaria&#x27;s Catholicism, obstinate conservatism and distrust of modernization were emphasized as elements of Kroetz&#x27;s work in the early 1970s, but that the contribution of his Bavarian identity to certain tensions in his work later became ignored.

== Reception ==

=== Early works ===
Michael Toteborg wrote that while Kroetz writes controversial content for serious purposes and &quot;never wanted to raise himself above the characters interacting on the stage [...] the question concerning the aesthetic and political worth of Kroetz&#x27;s dramatic productions is debatable&quot;. Carl accused the playwright of theoretical banalities but also defends the earlier works against the playwright&#x27;s later indictments. He praised &quot;Farmyard &quot;as capable of stirring audiences to social involvement, but criticized &quot;Men&#x27;s Business&quot; for its ending and &quot;Munich Child&quot; for its &quot;demagogy&quot;. Henry J. Schmidt, reviewing Carl&#x27;s book on Kroetz, criticized Carl for discussing the political effectiveness of &quot;Men&#x27;s Business&quot; without recourse to audience response, however, and described the ending of &quot;Men&#x27;s Business&quot; as &quot;one of Kroetz&#x27;s most effective scenes&quot;.

In a review of &quot;Farmyard and Four Plays&quot; (which contains &quot;Farmyard&quot;, &quot;Request Concert&quot;, &quot;Michi&#x27;s Blood&quot;, &quot;Men&#x27;s Business&quot;, and the &quot;Men&#x27;s Business&quot; revision &quot;A Man, A Dictionary&quot;), Dasgupta billed the playwright&#x27;s works as &quot;lyrical, scathing, humane dramas&quot;. Jeanette R. Malkin referred to &quot;Farmyard&quot; and &quot;Ghost Train&quot; as the most important dramas of his early period. Frank Rich wrote in a review of &quot;Michi&#x27;s Blood&quot; that it is not one of Kroetz&#x27;s best work, and said the playwright engages in &quot;uncharacteristic point-making, by force-feeding his heroine [...] Beckett-isms&quot;. &quot;The Washington Post&quot;&#x27;s David Richards argued, &quot;Unpleasant as it may be, &#x27;Michi&#x27;s Blood&#x27; is on to something about people deprived of language, purpose and the awareness of their own feelings.&quot;

=== Brecht-influenced works ===
Cocalis claimed that by 1972 Kroetz had drawn some criticism for being too repetitive or too apolitical. Works like &quot;Lienz – Gateway to the Dolomites&quot; (1972), &quot;Maria Magdalena&quot; (1972), &quot;Sterntaler &quot;(1974), &quot;Heimat &quot;(1975), and &quot;Agnes Bernauer&quot; (1976) were neither critically nor commercially successful. In &quot;Maria Magdalena&quot; Kroetz in her view struggles with his own formal idiom, and the Brechtian elements of &quot;Sterntaler&quot; and &quot;Heimat&quot; make them less powerful than previous works, akin to melodrama or soap opera. Critics of &quot;Agnes Bernauer&quot; found the heroine unconvincing and the socio-economics oversimplified.

=== &quot;The Nest&quot; (1974) ===
&quot;The Guardian&quot;&#x27;s Susannah Clapp expressed a lukewarm view of &quot;The Nest&quot;, describing some scenes as moving but arguing, &quot;There is uplift at the end but the unremitting intensity takes its toll on the pace. Detail is a double-edged sword. Some of the most striking episodes stretch the patience most: there is a long sequence when a suicide attempt gradually turns to farce.&quot; In a 2001 review of Alexander Gelman&#x27;s &quot;A Man with Connections&quot;, about a man who is viewed by his wife as responsible for an industrial accident that harmed their son, Lyn Gardner argued that Kroetz handles a similar scenario better in &quot;The Nest&quot;. In 2016, however, she said &quot;The Nest&quot; has didactic impulses and &quot;now looks a little simplistic and old-fashioned&quot; despite a topical environmental message.

=== &quot;Through the Leaves&quot; (1976) ===
Barry V. Daniels lauded &quot;Through the Leaves&quot; as thematically &quot;far beyond the specific naturalism of Antoine. When the generally middle class, educated audience confronts the essential matter of the play – its profound humanness – the barrier between them and the lower class characters breaks down&quot;. Reviewing a 1987 performance of &quot;Through the Leaves&quot; at the Dallas Theater Center, Jeannie M. Woods praised the play&#x27;s psychological insight, calling it &quot;a profoundly disturbing play [...] Her Pollyanna attitude seems to flourish on Otto&#x27;s abuse and on his inability to express his affection. [...] The harsh reality is tempered both by the warmth of Martha and by grotesque comedy.&quot; Frank Rich of &quot;The New York Times&quot; wrote in 1984 that the play &quot;is not pleasant, but it sticks like a splinter in the mind.&quot; He said that even certain impediments of the production he had attended (like Downey&#x27;s English translation being relocated in Queens) did not &quot;mute the jarring strains of [Kroetz&#x27;s] genuinely disturbing theatrical voice.&quot;

In 2003, &quot;The Guardian&quot;″s Michael Billington gave a Southwark Playhouse performance four out of five stars and wrote, &quot;What makes Kroetz an exceptional dramatist is that he links behaviour to economics.&quot; He also argued, &quot;Without a hint of patronage or condescension, Kroetz shows how both characters are victims of circumstance.&quot; Gardner called it &quot;a gripping but gruelling dissection of a relationship that flounders on mismatched desire, conditioned responses and the utter failure of language [...] one of his best plays&quot;.

=== &quot;Tom Fool&quot; (1978) ===
Mark Brown praised the playwright as understanding the &#x27;double burden&#x27; of class and gender carried by working class women, and added that &quot;arguably his best writing is reserved for Otto&#x27;s solitary musings on his position [...] The great beauty of &quot;Tom Fool&quot; is that it manages to address the politics of capitalism without a hint of polemic. Kroetz relies upon the emotional dynamics and powerful poetry that are the hallmark of great theatre&quot;. &quot;The Guardian&quot;&#x27;s Mark Fisher gave a 2006 performance three out of five stars, praising the performances but arguing, &quot;By showing not only the explosions but also the mundane business of clearing up, the play has a fragmented rhythm&quot;. Gardner gave a positive review to a 2007 performance, arguing that Kroetz is able to make mundane events &quot;hypnotic&quot;; she claimed that the majority of the play is &quot;like watching an unstable building sway and fall in agonising slow motion.&quot; &quot;Tom Fool&quot; was described as &quot;superb&quot; in &quot;The Herald&quot;.

=== 1980s and beyond ===
According to Dominic Dromgoole, Kroetz was for some &quot;the guiding light of the 1980s. For others, he was the most mind-bogglingly boring playwright history had ever thrown up.&quot; Arthur Holmberg of &quot;The New York Times&quot; wrote in 1984 that &quot;literary critics rank him as one of the most important of Europe&#x27;s young playwrights.&quot;

The surrealistic &quot;Neither Fish Nor Flesh&quot; (1981) was controversial, with half the audience at its Munich premiere leaving by the end of the third act. A reviewer for &quot;Der Spiegel&quot; lauded Kroetz as accurately depicting the social conditions and languages of the people portrayed. Hellmuth Karasek praised &quot;Bauern sterben&quot; (1985) in the same magazine. Discussing the same play, McGowan criticized the city-country dichotomy in which the former is depicted as soulless and the latter is glorified, though he dubbed the play &quot;powerfully and self-consciously theatrical&quot;, saying it contains &quot;a series of elemental, powerful images.&quot; In 1998, Angelica Fenner noted that the negative characterizations of female protagonists who choose abortion had garnered him some praise from conservative factions.

&quot;Der Drang&quot; (&quot;The Urge&quot;, 1994), an extended version of &quot;Lieber Fritz&quot; (&quot;Dear Fritz&quot;, 1971), drew controversy for its sexual content. &quot;Ich bin das Volk&quot; (&quot;I Am the People&quot;, 1994) garnered mixed responses.

<text>Oleg Vladimirovich Penkovsky (; 23 April 1919 – 16 May 1963), codenamed Hero (by the CIA) and Yoga (by MI6) was a Soviet military intelligence (GRU) colonel during the late 1950s and early 1960s. Penkovsky informed the United States and the United Kingdom about Soviet military secrets, including the appearance and footprint of Soviet intermediate-range ballistic missile installations and the weakness of the Soviet intercontinental ballistic missile (ICBM) program. This information was decisive in allowing the US to recognize that the Soviets were placing missiles in Cuba before most of them were operational. It also gave US President John F. Kennedy, during the Cuban Missile Crisis that followed, valuable information about Soviet weakness that allowed him to face down Soviet leader Nikita Khrushchev and resolve the crisis without a nuclear war. 

Penkovsky was the highest-ranking Soviet official to provide intelligence for the West up until that time, and is one of several individuals credited with altering the course of the Cold War. He was arrested by the Soviets in October 1962, and tried and executed the following year.

==Early life and military career==
Penkovsky was a baby when his father was killed fighting as an officer in the White Army in the Russian Civil War. Brought up in the North Caucasus, young Penkovsky graduated from the Kiev Artillery Academy with the rank of lieutenant in 1939. After taking part in the Winter War against Finland and in World War II, he reached the rank of lieutenant-colonel. In 1944, he was assigned to the headquarters of Colonel-General Sergei Varentsov, commander of artillery on the 1st Ukrainian front, who became his patron. Penkovsky was wounded in action in 1944, at about the same time as Varentsov, who appointed him his Liaison Officer. In 1945, Penkovsky married the teenage daughter of Lieutenant-General Dmitri Gapanovich, thus acquiring another high-ranking patron. On Varentsov&#x27;s recommendation, he studied at the Frunze Military Academy in 1945–1948, then worked as a staff officer.

Penkovsky joined the GRU as an officer, in 1953. In 1955, he was appointed military attaché in Ankara, Turkey, but was recalled after he had reported his superior officer, and later other GRU personnel for a breach of regulations, which made him unpopular in the department. Relying once again on Varentsov&#x27;s patronage, he spent nine months studying rocket artillery at Dzerzhinsky Military Academy. He was selected for the post of military attaché in India, but the KGB had uncovered the history of his father&#x27;s death, and he was suspended, investigated, and assigned in November 1960 to the State Committee for Science and Technology. He later worked at the Soviet Committee for Scientific Research.

==Overtures to CIA and MI6==
Penkovsky approached American students on the Bolshoy Moskvoretsky Bridge in Moscow in July 1960 and gave them a package in which he offered to spy for the United States. He asked them to deliver it to an intelligence officer at the US Embassy. The CIA delayed contacting him. When the US Embassy in Moscow refused to cooperate, fearing an international incident, the CIA contacted MI6 for assistance.

Greville Wynne, a British salesman of industrial equipment to countries behind the Iron Curtain, was recruited by MI6 to communicate with Penkovsky.

The first meeting between Penkovsky and two American and two British intelligence officers occurred during a visit by Penkovsky to London in April 1961. For the following 18 months, Penkovsky supplied a tremendous amount of information to the CIA–MI6 team of handlers, including documents demonstrating that the Soviet nuclear arsenal was much smaller than Nikita Khrushchev claimed or the CIA had thought and that the Soviets were not yet capable of producing a large number of ICBMs. This information was invaluable to President John F. Kennedy in negotiating with Nikita Khrushchev for the removal of the Soviet missiles from Cuba.

Peter Wright, a former British MI5 officer known for his scathing condemnation of the leadership of British intelligence during most of the Cold War, believed that Penkovsky was a fake defection. Wright noted that, unlike Igor Gouzenko and other earlier defectors, Penkovsky did not reveal the names of any Soviet agents in the West but only provided organisational detail, much of which was known already. Some of the documents provided were originals, which Wright thought could not have been easily taken from their sources. Wright was bitter towards British intelligence, reportedly believing that it should have adopted his proposed methods to identify British/Soviet double agents. In Wright&#x27;s view, the failure of British intelligence leaders to listen to him caused them to become paralysed when such agents defected to the Soviet Union; in his book, &quot;Spycatcher&quot;, he suggests that his hypothesis had to be true, and that the Soviets were aware of this paralysis and planted Penkovsky.

In his memoir &quot;Spycatcher: The Candid Autobiography of a Senior Intelligence Officer&quot; (1987), written with journalist Paul Greengrass, Wright says:

Former KGB major-general Oleg Kalugin does not mention Penkovsky in his comprehensive memoir about his career in intelligence against the West. The KGB defector Vladimir N. Sakharov suggests Penkovsky was genuine, saying: &quot;I knew about the ongoing KGB reorganisation precipitated by Oleg Penkovsky&#x27;s case and Yuri Nosenko&#x27;s defection. The party was not satisfied with KGB performance ... I knew many heads in the KGB had rolled again, as they had after Stalin&quot;. 

While the weight of opinion seems to be that Penkovsky was genuine, the debate underscores the difficulty faced by all intelligence agencies of determining information offered from the enemy. 

In a meeting with US Secretary of Defense Leon Panetta, the head of Russia&#x27;s foreign intelligence service, Mikhail Fradkov, named Penkovsky as Russia&#x27;s biggest intelligence failure.

==The &quot;Zepp&quot; Incident==

Former high-level CIA counterintelligence officer Tennent H. Bagley wrote in his 2007 Yale University Press book, &quot;Spy Wars: Moles Mysteries and Deadly Games,&quot; that Penkovsky&#x27;s treason was detected by the KGB within two weeks of his April 1961 recruitment by the CIA and MI6. Bagley says that after this detection, Penkovsky was allowed by the KGB to continue spying for the U.S. and Britain for sixteen more months while a scenario was created in which he could be arrested and charged in such a way that would not reveal who, in Western Intelligence, had betrayed him. Bagley based his conclusion on the fact that, when Greville Wynne and Penkovsky were arrested, and imprisoned in Russia, Wynne was confronted with a tape recording of a conversation he had had with Penkovsky in a Moscow restaurant two weeks after his recruitment. In this recording, Wynne asked Penkovsky, &quot;How&#x27;s Zeph?&quot; When Wynne was asked by his KGB interrogator who this &quot;Zepp&quot; (sic) was, he recalled that &quot;Zeph&quot; was the nickname of a London bargirl by the name of Stephanie, whom Penkovsky and Wynne had met while Penkovsky was being recruited. Bagley points out in his book that while he and George Kisevalter were interviewing KGB defector Yuri Nosenko in June 1962, Nosenko, while bragging about the KGB&#x27;s secret recording devices, asked them who &quot;Zepp&quot; (sic) was, volunteering that it was the name of an Indonesian military attaché unknown to the KGB, whose conversation with U.S. military attaché Leo Dulacki was allegedly secretly recorded in a Moscow restaurant. The fact that Nosenko asked Bagley and Kisevalter this question was one of the reasons Bagley came to conclude that Nosenko was a false defector, and also made him realize that a &quot;mole&quot; in the CIA or British intelligence had betrayed Penkovsky immediately after his recruitment.

== Cuban Missile Crisis ==

The Soviet leadership began the deployment of nuclear missiles, in the belief that Washington would not detect the Cuban missile sites until it was too late to do anything about them. Penkovsky provided plans and descriptions of the nuclear rocket launch sites in Cuba to the West. This information allowed the West to identify the missile sites from the low-resolution pictures provided by US U-2 spy planes. The documents provided by Penkovsky showed that the Soviet Union was not prepared for war in the area, which emboldened Kennedy to risk the operation in Cuba. Former GRU captain Viktor Suvorov, who defected to the UK in 1978, later wrote in his book on Soviet intelligence, &quot;historians will remember with gratitude the name of the GRU Colonel Oleg Penkovsky. Thanks to his priceless information the Cuban crisis was not transformed into a last World War&quot;.

Penkovsky&#x27;s communications with MI6 were also revealed to the KGB by Jack Dunlap, a National Security Agency (NSA) employee and Soviet spy working for the KGB. Top KGB officers had known for more than a year that Penkovsky was a British agent, but they protected their source, a highly placed mole in MI6. Dunlap was just another source they had to protect. They worked hard, shadowing British diplomats, to build up a &quot;discovery case&quot; against Penkovsky so that they could arrest him without throwing suspicion on their own moles. Their caution in this matter may have led to the missiles being discovered earlier than the Soviets would have preferred. After a West German agent overheard a remark at Stasi headquarters, paraphrased as &quot;I wonder how things are going in Cuba&quot;, he passed it on to the CIA.

Penkovsky was arrested on 22 October 1962. This was prior to President Kennedy&#x27;s address to the US revealing that U-2 spy plane photographs had confirmed intelligence reports that the Soviets were installing medium-range nuclear missiles in Cuba, in what was known as Operation Anadyr. Kennedy was consequently deprived of information from a potentially important intelligence agent, such as reporting that Khrushchev was already looking for ways to defuse the situation, which might have lessened the tension during the ensuing 13-day stand-off. That information might have reduced the pressure on Kennedy to launch an invasion of the island, which could have risked Soviet use of &quot;9K52 Luna-M&quot;-class tactical nuclear weapons against U.S. troops.

== Arrest and death==

On 2 November, 1962, Penkovsky&#x27;s Western handlers in Moscow received two voiceless telephone calls and a visual signal (a chalk mark on a telephone pole or street light pole), ostensibly from him, notifying them that his dead drop had been loaded. Upon servicing the dead drop (which held a letter ostensibly from him) that same day, a CIA officer by the name of Richard Jacob, who was stationed at the U.S. Embassy under diplomatic cover, was arrested. (Soviet authorities later claimed that Penkovsky had been apprehended ten days earlier, on the 22nd of October.) Penkovsky was tried and executed, but there are conflicting reports about the manner of his death. Alexander Zagvozdin, chief KGB interrogator for the investigation, stated that Penkovsky had been &quot;questioned perhaps a hundred times&quot; and that he had been shot and cremated. 

Soviet sculptor Ernst Neizvestny said that he had been told by the director of the Donskoye Cemetery crematorium &quot;how Penkovsky [had been] executed by &#x27;fire&#x27;&quot;, i.e., by being burnt. A similar description was later included in Ernest Volkman&#x27;s popular history book about spies, Tom Clancy&#x27;s novel &quot;Red Rabbit&quot;, and in Viktor Suvorov&#x27;s book &quot;Aquarium&quot;. In a 2010 interview, Suvorov said that he had been shown a film in which a man said to be Penkovsky was bound to a metal stretcher with wire and pushed live into a crematorium. Suvorov denied that the man in the film was Penkovsky and said that he had been shot. Greville Wynne, in his book &quot;The Man from Odessa,&quot; claimed that Penkovsky killed himself. Wynne had worked as both Penkovsky&#x27;s contact and courier; both men were arrested by the Soviets in October 1962.

== Repercussions ==
The Soviet public was first told of Penkovsky&#x27;s arrest more than seven weeks later, when &quot;Pravda&quot; named Wynne and (the American diplomat Richard) Jacob as his contacts, without naming anyone else. In May 1963, after his trial, &quot;Izvestya&quot; reported that Varentsov, who had since achieved the rank of Chief Marshal of Artillery and Commander in Chief of Rocket Forces and candidate member of the Central Committee had been demoted to the rank of Major General. In June he was expelled from the Central Committee for &#x27;having relaxed his political vigilance.&#x27; Three other officers were also disciplined. The head of the GRU, Ivan Serov, was sacked during the same period. He was reputedly on friendly terms with Penkovsky, which is very likely to have been a cause of his fall.

==Portrayal in popular culture==
Penkovsky was portrayed by Christopher Rozycki in the 1985 BBC Television serial &quot;Wynne and Penkovsky&quot;. His spying career was the subject of episode 1 of the 2007 BBC Television docudrama &quot;Nuclear Secrets&quot;, titled &quot;The Spy from Moscow&quot; in which he was portrayed by Mark Bonnar. The programme featured original covert KGB footage showing Penkovsky photographing classified information and meeting up with Janet Chisholm, a British MI6 agent stationed in Moscow. It was broadcast on 15 January 2007.

Penkovsky was referred to in four of Tom Clancy&#x27;s Jack Ryan espionage novels: &quot;The Hunt for Red October&quot; (1984), &quot;The Cardinal of the Kremlin&quot; (1988), &quot;The Bear and the Dragon&quot; (2000) and &quot;Red Rabbit&quot; (2002). In the Jack Ryan universe, he is described as the agent who recruited Colonel Mikhail Filitov as a CIA agent (code-name CARDINAL) and had urged Filitov to betray him to solidify his position as the West&#x27;s top spy in the Soviet hierarchy. The &quot;cremated alive&quot; hypothesis appears in several Clancy novels, though Clancy never identified Penkovsky as the executed spy. Penkovsky&#x27;s fate is also mentioned in the Nelson DeMille spy novel &quot;The Charm School&quot; (1988).

Penkovsky was portrayed by Eduard Bezrodniy in the 2014 Polish thriller &quot;Jack Strong&quot;, about Ryszard Kukliński, another Cold War spy. His character&#x27;s execution was the opening scene for the movie. Penkovsky was portrayed by Merab Ninidze in the 2020 British film &quot;The Courier&quot;, in which Benedict Cumberbatch played Greville Wynne.

<text>Vénuste Niyongabo (born December 9, 1973) is a Burundian former long and middle-distance runner. In 1996, he became the first Olympic medalist from Burundi by winning the 5000 metres at the 1996 Summer Olympics. He had only competed twice before in that event prior to winning the gold medal.

==Biography==
Born in Vugizo, in southern Burundi, Niyongabo won a silver medal in the 1500 m at the 1992 World Junior Championships and also came fourth over 800 metres. He competed in his first senior tournament the following year, but was eliminated in the 1500 m semi-finals of the World Championships in Stuttgart. Niyongabo soon became one of the top 1500 m runners in the world, winning several major races in 1994 and 1995. He also won a bronze medal at the World Championships in Gothenburg, finishing behind Noureddine Morceli and Hicham El Guerrouj.

For the 1996 Olympics, held in Atlanta, Niyongabo was assumed to be a potential winner of the 1500 m, but he decided to forfeit his place to a compatriot, Dieudonné Kwizera. Kwizera had been unable to compete in the 1988 and 1992 Olympics since Burundi did not have a National Olympic Committee at the time, and was only in Atlanta as a coach. Niyongabo moved up to compete in the 5000 m event instead. The move turned out to be a good one for both athletes; Kwizera finally became an Olympian, while Niyongabo sprinted away in the last lap of the 5000 m final to win an unexpected gold medal.

He also is the eighth fastest miler ever, putting him behind only Hicham El Guerrouj, Noah Ngeny, Jakob Ingebrigtsen, Yared Nuguse, Noureddine Morceli, Steve Cram and Daniel Komen.

After the Olympics, Niyongabo struggled with several injuries, and never achieved the same level of competition again. His attempt to defend his title at the 2000 Summer Olympics failed, placing only 15th in his semi-final heat.

Niyongabo worked for the Ekin division of Nike, Inc. in Italy. He ran on the elite Nike Bowerman International team in the Hood to Coast Relay in 2005, which finished second in a field of 1062 teams.

Venuste is today a member of the ‘Champions for Peace’ club, a group of 54 famous elite athletes committed to serving peace in the world through sport, created by Peace and Sport, a Monaco-based international organization.

In October 2010, he sponsored the very first &quot;Friendship Games&quot; which took place in the Great Lakes region of Africa: a day of trans-border sports competitions to promote peace and unite young people from Burundi and the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC) around the values of friendship and fraternity offered by sport.
