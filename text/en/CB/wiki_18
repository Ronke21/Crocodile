<text>A loan shark is a person who offers loans at extremely high or illegal interest rates, has strict terms of collection, and generally operates outside the law, often using the threat of violence or other illegal, aggressive, and extortionate actions when seeking to enforce the satisfaction of the debt. As a consistent or repeated illegal business operation or &quot;racket&quot;, loansharking is generally associated with organized crime and certain criminal organizations.

==Description==
Because loan sharks operate mostly illegally, they cannot use the legal system to collect such debts, thus they often resort to enforcing repayment by terms of blackmail and threats of violence. Historically, many moneylenders skirted between legal and criminal activity. In the recent western world, loan sharks have been a prominent feature of the criminal underworld.

Loan sharking is not to be confused with predatory lending with extremely high interest rates such as payday or title loans, which is sometimes considered to be &quot;loan sharking&quot; (or, at least, unfavorably compared to loan sharking by critics) regardless of whether it is legal. A key difference between &quot;traditional&quot; loan sharking and predatory lending is that lenders alleged to be engaged in the latter practice are expected to stay within the law when making and collecting loans, and thus the debate into such practices often focuses on whether they are ethical as opposed to whether they are legal. However, laws regulating lending practices vary so widely between jurisdictions (even in the same country, particularly between states in the United States) that particular practices that might be technically legal (if arguably unethical) &quot;predatory lending&quot; in one jurisdiction might be considered illegal &quot;loan sharking&quot; if attempted in an identical manner in a different locale.

== Japan ==

Regulation of moneylenders is typically much looser than that of banks. In Japan, the Moneylending Control Law requires only registration in each prefecture. In Japan, as the decades-long depression lingers, banks are reluctant to loan money and regulation has become tighter, illegal moneylending has become a social issue. Illegal moneylenders typically charge interest of 30 or 50% in 10 days (in Japanese, these are called &quot;to-san&quot; (&#x27;to&#x27; meaning ten and &#x27;san&#x27; meaning three, or 10-3) or &quot;to-go&quot; (&#x27;to&#x27; meaning ten and &#x27;go&#x27; meaning five, or 10-5), which correspond to effective interest rates of about 1.442 million % and 267.5 million % per annum respectively. This is against the law that sets the maximum interest rate at 20%. These lenders usually do business with those who cannot get more money from banks, legitimate consumer loans, or credit cards.

==Ireland==
The Central Bank of Ireland was criticized for doing nothing to protect those with low incomes, the vulnerable or those who have low levels of financial literacy, from loan sharks, when it emerged in 2015 that up to 100,000 of the 360,000 loans given by the moneylenders violated the law.

==Israel==
Loansharking is one of the main activities of the Israeli mafia.

==Kazakhstan==

The National Bank of Kazakhstan has been consistently fighting loan sharks since 2018. Thus, the maximum interest rate on a loan was limited to no more than 100% of the loan amount.

In 2020, a financial market regulation agency was separated from the National Bank of Kazakhstan to monitor the rights and legitimate interests of borrowers, to identify and eliminate systemic problems of the financial sector of the economy. A unified state register of microfinance organizations was introduced to legalize lenders.

== Malaysia and Singapore ==
Ah Long (derived from the Cantonese phrase &#x27;大耳窿&#x27; (&#x27;big ear hole&#x27;)) is a colloquial term for illegal loan sharks in Malaysia and Singapore. They lend money to people who are unable to obtain loans from banks or other legal sources, mostly targeting habitual gamblers. Often, they discreetly advertise by sticking notices, mostly on lamp posts and utility boxes around a neighbourhood, thus vandalising public property, as authorities must remove such advertisements. They charge high interest rates (generally about 40% per month/fortnight) according to Anti-Crime, Drug and Social Development Voluntary Organisation and frequently threaten violence (and administer it) towards those who fail to pay on time.

=== &quot;Ah Long&quot; tactics ===

When a person fails to pay on time, the &quot;Ah Long&quot; will set on fire, spray paint, lock up gates, splash, or write threats in paint or markers on the walls of the property of that person as a threat of violence and to scare, and perhaps shame, the borrower into repaying the loan. A common use of painting includes the characters &quot;O$P$&quot; meaning &quot;owe money, pay money&quot;, as well as the debtors&#x27; unit number. According to local police authorities, there have been cases where borrowers and their family members were beaten or had their property damaged or destroyed, and some victims have committed suicide.

== New Zealand ==
During the early COVID-19 pandemic in 2020, the New Zealand Government launched a crackdown against loan sharks to ease economic hardship. Commerce Minister Kris Faafoi announced that the Credit Contracts Legislation Amendment Act 2020 would come into force on 1 May 2020 rather than 1 June 2020. Under the new law, high-interest lenders charging interest at 50% or more would not be allowed to charge interest as well as fees over 100% of the amount loaned to borrowers. In addition, compound interest on high interest loans were banned while fees for defaulting on payments were capped. By June 2024, figures released by the Ministry of Business, Innovation and Employment showed that no customers had been granted high-cost loans in 2023.

== Russia ==
Several organizations regulate the loan market in Russia:

* Central Bank
* RosComNadzor
* Self-regulated industry organization MIR

In 2024, the Central Bank planned to impose higher requirements on loan loss provisions for loans with a full value of 250% or more.

==Vietnam==
Loan sharks in Vietnam are very common, especially in high population density areas and industrial park surroundings. They focus on poor workers and gamblers, advertising their services on walls and electric poles as well as online platforms such as Google and Facebook. Their operations vary from pawn shops to online operations via illegal applications. These operations are not usually controlled by Vietnamese, but rather Vietnamese people living in Cambodia or Chinese operators. Many of these sharks offer very high loan rates at 20% to 1000% per month. When the borrower is unable to pay their debt, the sharks will force the borrower to take out further loans. If the borrower is unable to pay those on time, the sharks will use intimidation tactics such as sending threatening messages to the borrower and their family and friends. Additionally, some resort to vandalism and kidnapping. Most borrowers only loan relatively small amounts of money, below 10 million VNĐ, but due to compound rates, the borrower will ultimately have to pay much more than they would have with official credit service suppliers. There are a lot of cases reported and most are solved by the police, but many remain unsolved.

In recent years, the government has tried to stop these loaners from operating and encouraged people not to borrow money from them. The victims are largely under-educated people with limited financial knowledge.

==United Kingdom==

The research by the government and other agencies estimates that 165,000 to 200,000 people are indebted to loan sharks in the United Kingdom. Illicit loan sharking is treated as a high-level crime by law enforcement, due to its links to organized crime and the serious violence involved. Payday loans with high interest rates are legal in many cases, and have been described as &quot;legal loan sharking&quot; (in that the creditor is legally registered, pays taxes and contributions, and can reclaim remittance if taking the case to adjudication; likewise there is no threat of harm to the debtor).

==United States==

===19th-century salary lenders===
In the late 19th-century US, the low legal interest rates made small loans unprofitable, and small-time lending was viewed as irresponsible by society. Banks and other major financial institutions thus stayed away from small-time lending. There were, however, plenty of small lenders offering loans at profitable but illegally high interest rates. They presented themselves as legitimate and operated openly out of offices. They only sought customers who had a steady and respectable job, a regular income and a reputation to protect. This made them less likely to leave the area before they paid their debt and more likely to have a legitimate reason for borrowing money. Gamblers, criminals, and others who were disreputable or likely to be unreliable were avoided. They made the borrower fill out and sign seemingly legitimate contracts. Though these contracts were not legally enforceable, they at least were proof of the loan, which the lender could use to blackmail a defaulter.

To force a defaulter into paying, the lender might threaten legal action. This was a bluff, since the loan was illegal. The lender preyed on the borrower&#x27;s ignorance of the law. Alternatively, the lender resorted to public shaming, exploiting the social stigma of being in debt to a loan shark. They were able to complain to the defaulter&#x27;s employer, because many employers would fire employees who were mired in debt, because of the risk of them stealing from the employer to repay debts. They were able to send agents to stand outside the defaulter&#x27;s home, loudly denouncing him, perhaps vandalizing his home with graffiti or notices. Whether out of gullibility or embarrassment, the borrower usually succumbed and paid.

Many customers were employees of large firms, such as railways or public works. Larger organizations were more likely to fire employees for being in debt, as their rules were more impersonal, which made blackmail easier. It was easier for lenders to learn which large organizations did this as opposed to collecting information on the multitude of smaller firms. Larger firms had more job security and the greater possibility of promotion, so employees sacrificed more to ensure they were not fired. The loan shark could also bribe a large firm&#x27;s paymaster to provide information on its many employees. Regular salaries and paydays made negotiating repayment plans simpler.

The size of the loan and the repayment plan were often tailored to suit the borrower&#x27;s means. The smaller the loan, the higher the interest rate was, as the costs (overhead) of tracking and pursuing a defaulter did not depend on the size of the loan. The attitudes of lenders to defaulters also varied: some were lenient and reasonable, readily granting extensions and slow to harass, while others unscrupulously tried to milk all they could from the borrower (e.g. imposing late fees).

Because salary lending was a disreputable trade, the owners of these firms often hid from public view, hiring managers to run their offices indirectly. To further avoid attracting attention, when expanding his trade to other cities, an owner would often found new firms with different names rather than increasing the visibility and recognizability of his existing firm.

The penalties for being an illegal lender were mild. Illegal lending was a misdemeanor, and the penalty was forfeiture of the interest and perhaps the principal as well. But these were only ever imposed if the borrower sued, which he typically could not afford to do.

Opposition to salary lenders was spearheaded by social elites, such as businessmen and charity organizations. Businessmen were encouraged not to fire employees who were indebted to loan sharks so that the loan sharks could not blackmail their debtors (&quot;pay up or we&#x27;ll tell your boss that you&#x27;re a deadbeat and you&#x27;ll be fired&quot;). Charities provided legal support to troubled borrowers. This fight culminated in the drafting of the Uniform Small Loan Law, which brought into existence a new class of licensed lender. The law was enacted, first in several states in 1917, and was adopted by all but a handful of states by the middle of the 20th century. The model statute mandated consumer protections and capped the interest rate on loans of $300 or less at 3.5% a month (51% a year), a profitable level for small loans. Lenders had to give the customer copies of all signed documents. Additional charges such as late fees were banned. The lender could no longer receive power of attorney or confession of judgment over a customer. These licensing laws made it impossible for usurious lenders to pass themselves off as legal. Small loans also started becoming more socially acceptable, and banks and other larger institutions started offering them as well.

===20th-century gangsters===
In the 1920s and 1930s, American prosecutors began to notice the emergence of a new breed of illegal lender that used violence to enforce debts. The new small lender laws had made it almost impossible to intimidate customers with a veneer of legality, and many customers were less vulnerable to shaming because they were either self-employed or already disreputable. Thus, violence was an important tool, though not their only one. These loan sharks operated more informally than salary lenders, which meant more discretion for the lender and less paperwork and bureaucracy for the customer. They were also willing to serve high-risk borrowers that legal lenders would not touch.

Threats of violence were rarely followed through, however. One possible reason is that injuring a borrower could have meant he could not work and thus could never pay off his debt. Many regular borrowers realized the threats were mostly bluffs and that they could get away with delinquent payments. A more certain consequence was that the delinquent borrower would be cut off from future loans, which was serious for those who regularly relied on loan sharks.

One important market for violent loan sharks was illegal gambling operators, who could not expose themselves to the law to collect debts legally. They cooperated with loan sharks to supply credit and collect payments from their punters. Thieves and other criminals, whose fortunes were frequently in flux, were also served, and these connections also allowed the loan sharks to operate as fences. Another type of high-risk customer was the small businessman in dire financial straits who could not qualify for a legal loan.

Violent loansharking was typically run by criminal syndicates, such as the Mafia and Irish Mob. Many of these were former bootleggers who needed a new line of work after the end of alcohol prohibition. Towards the 1960s, loan sharks grew ever more coordinated, and could pool information on borrowers to better size up risks and ensure a borrower did not try to pay off one loan by borrowing from another loan shark. The fearsome reputation of a criminal organization made the loan shark&#x27;s threat of violence more credible.

=== Mafia links ===

==== Origins in &quot;salary buying&quot;, 1920-criminalization ====
Although the reform law was intended to starve the loan sharks into extinction, this species of predatory lender thrived and evolved. After high-rate salary lending was outlawed, some bootleg vendors recast the product as &quot;salary buying&quot;. They claimed they were not making loans but were purchasing future wages at a discount. This form of loansharking proliferated through the 1920s and into the 1930s until a new draft of the Uniform Small Loan Law closed the loophole through which the salary buyers had slipped. Salary-buying loan sharks continued to operate in some southern states after World War II because the usury rate was set so low that licensed personal finance companies could not do business there.

==== Post-criminalization ====
Organized crime began to enter the cash advance business in the 1930s, after high-rate lending was criminalized by the Uniform Small Loan Law. The first reports of mob loansharking surfaced in New York City in 1935, and for 15 years, underworld money lending apparently did not expand beyond that city. There is no record of syndicate &quot;juice&quot; operations in Chicago, for instance, until the 1950s.

In the beginning, underworld loansharking was a small loan business, catering to the same populations served by the salary lenders and buyers. Those who turned to the bootleg lenders could not get credit at the licensed companies because their incomes were too low or they were deemed poor risks. The firms operating within the usury cap turned away roughly half of all applicants and tended to make larger loans to married men with steady jobs and decent incomes.

Those who could not get a legal loan at 36% or 42% a year could secure a cash advance from a mobster at the going rate of 10% or 20% a week for small loans. Since the mob loans were not usually secured with legal instruments, debtors pledged their bodies as collateral.

In its early phase, a large fraction of mob loansharking consisted of payday lending. Many of the customers were office clerks and factory hands. The loan fund for these operations came from the proceeds of the numbers racket and was distributed by the top bosses to the lower echelon loan sharks at the rate of 1% or 2% a week. The 1952 B movie &quot;Loan Shark&quot;, starring George Raft, offers a glimpse of mob payday lending. The waterfront in Brooklyn was another site of extensive underworld payday advance operations around mid-century.

==== 1960s heyday–present ====
Over time, mob loan sharks moved away from such labor intensive rackets. By the 1960s, the preferred clientele was small and medium-sized businesses. Business customers had the advantage of possessing assets that could be seized in case of default, or used to engage in fraud or to launder money. Gamblers were another lucrative market, as were other criminals who needed financing for their operations. By the 1970s, mob salary lending operations seemed to have withered away in the United States.

At its height in the 1960s, underworld loansharking was estimated to be the second most lucrative franchise of organized crime in the United States after illegal gambling. Newspapers in the 1960s were filled with sensational stories of debtors beaten, harassed, and sometimes murdered by mob loan sharks. Yet careful studies of the business have raised doubts about the frequency with which violence was employed in practice. Relations between creditor and debtor could be amicable, even when the &quot;vig&quot; or &quot;juice&quot; was exorbitant, because each needed the other. FBI agents in one city interviewed 115 customers of a mob loan business but turned up only one debtor who had been threatened. None had been beaten.

=== Non-mafia sharks ===
Organized crime has never had a monopoly on black market lending. Plenty of vest-pocket lenders operated outside the jurisdiction of organized crime, charging usurious rates of interest for cash advances. These informal networks of credit rarely came to the attention of the authorities but flourished in populations not served by licensed lenders. Even today, after the rise of corporate payday lending in the United States, unlicensed loan sharks continue to operate in immigrant enclaves and low-income neighborhoods. They lend money to people who work in the informal sector or who are deemed to be too risky even by the check-cashing creditors. Some beat delinquents while others seize assets instead. Their rates run from 10% to 20% a week, as was common with the mob in the past.

===Non-standard lenders in the United States===
In the United States, there are lenders licensed to serve borrowers who cannot qualify for standard loans from mainstream sources. These smaller, non-standard lenders often operate in cash, whereas mainstream lenders increasingly operate only electronically and will not serve borrowers who do not have bank accounts. Terms such as sub-prime lending, &quot;non-standard consumer credit&quot;, and payday loans are often used in connection with this type of consumer finance. The availability of these services has made illegal, exploitative loan sharks rarer, but these legal lenders have also been accused of behaving in an exploitative manner. For example, payday loan operations have come under fire for charging inflated &quot;service charges&quot; for their services of cashing a &quot;payday advance&quot;, effectively a short-term (no more than one or two weeks) loan for which charges may run 3–5% of the principal amount. By claiming to be charging for the &quot;service&quot; of cashing a paycheck, instead of merely charging interest for a short-term loan, laws that strictly regulate moneylending costs can be effectively bypassed.

=== Payday lending ===

Licensed payday advance businesses, which lend money at high rates of interest on the security of a postdated check, are often described as loan sharks by their critics due to high interest rates that trap debtors, stopping short of illegal lending and violent collection practices. Today&#x27;s payday loan is a close cousin of the early 20th century salary loan, the product to which the &quot;shark&quot; epithet was originally applied, but they are now legalised in some states.

A 2001 comparison of short-term lending rates charged by the Chicago Outfit organized crime syndicate and payday lenders in California revealed that, depending on when a payday loan was paid back by a borrower (generally 1–14 days), the interest rate charged for a payday loan could be considerably higher than the interest rate of a similar loan made by the organized crime syndicate. However the violent collection practices of the organized crime can ensure a lower rate of unpaid loans. The absence of taxes further reduces the cost of lending in this case.

<text>is a Japanese actress, voice actress, singer and disc jockey who was born in Tokyo. She is currently affiliated with Across Entertainment and her label is Lantis. She is an instructor at the Stay Luck training school Follow-Up. For her singing activities, she uses the alias .

Her well-known roles as a voice actress include Kasumi (Misty) in the &quot;Pokémon&quot; series, Tron Bonne in the &quot;Mega Man Legends&quot; series and Claiomh Everlasting in the &quot;Sorcerous Stabber Orphen&quot; series.

==Career==
In 1980, at the age of three, Iizuka joined Theater Company Wakakusa through an acquaintance of her grandfather. The reason she joined the group was to learn etiquette. The company was stricter about greetings and etiquette than her lessons, and she remembers crying when she was told off. The following year, on January 11, 1981, she made her debut as a child actress playing the role of Tomiko in the TV drama &quot;Haru no Urara no Monogatari&quot; (TBS Television Toshiba Sunday Theater). At Theater Company Wakakusa, she was taught to &quot;keep showing people what only you can do,&quot; and even as a child, she spent her days desperately trying to achieve her dreams.

In 1983, due to her father&#x27;s job transfer, she moved to Taichung City, Taiwan from the first grade to the fifth grade, during which time she took a break from performing. When she returned to Japan in 1989, she resumed her performing career with the same Theater Company Wakakusa. She had always personally wanted to return, and when she was in her fifth year back in Japan, she decided she will think about things in her own way and do her best in this world. In an interview in 2008, she said that she could not have done it alone to come this far, and she wanted to express her gratitude to her parents, grandfather, and family.

When Iizuka first resumed her activities, things did not go as she had hoped, and she often failed at auditions and didn&#x27;t have any luck in getting roles. In fact, she was one of the last people to audition for the &quot;Wakaokusama wa Udemakuri!&quot; but she was not selected. It was to her chagrin that she was finally selected to play the role of a friend, and she recalls in her blog that it was a fun experience. At that time, Midori Yaegaki, the representative of the company at that time, told her that it was her own power that brought her luck, and she realized that it was no good to be weak and that she had to attract luck herself, and after she started to audition in that way, her appearances in dramas gradually increased.

In 1991, she made her voice acting debut as Tsuneko Tani in the movie &quot;Only Yesterday&quot;. The audition for the film was the first time she auditioned for voice acting, and at that time she had almost no experience with voice acting auditions, causing her anxiety due to not having the know-how, but she was full of desire to try it.

In 1993, Iizuka moved to Yaegaki Office, a directly managed production company of Theater Company Wakakusa. There were no senior members of her office who had debuted as voice actors, and her manager did not know what kind of scenes she would be in, so she often went to dub shows by herself. Although she lacked confidence, she went to the recording sessions with the feeling that her performances would be accepted there. From the age of 19, she began working more and more on TV anime series and OVAs, and from then on, her main activity was as a voice actress, but she still appears on stage and continues to work as an actress.

In 1997, she became widely known for her role as Kasumi in &quot;Pokémon&quot;. When she was in college, she was thinking of quitting if she didn&#x27;t find a job that satisfied her by the time she graduated, and that is when she came across the role of Kasumi. Since then, she has expanded her activities and made her debut as a singer with the release of her album &quot;Kataomoi&quot; (Pioneer LDC) on August 27. In addition, she became the main personality for her first show &quot;Weekly Animage: Mayumi Iizuka&#x27;s It&#x27;s Still Sunday!&quot; which was aired from October 12, and started her career as a radio personality. In an interview in 2008, she commented that her world has expanded and that made her realize that there is more than one dream.

In 1998, Iizuka performed her first concert, &quot;VOICE ANIMAGE Presents Mayumi Iizuka First Concert&quot; at Hall A, Tokyo International Forum. In mid-August 2010, she attended the 2010 Shenyang 2nd Anime and Computer Game Expo in Shenyang, China, and gave a small live performance and a speech in Chinese.

On February 28, 2014, she left Yaegaki Office and moved to Kenyu Office on March 1, 2014. On September 1, 2017, she moved from Kenyu Office to Across Entertainment.

<text>Patricia &quot;Patsy&quot; Walker is a superhero appearing in American comic books published by Marvel Comics. Created by Stuart Little and Ruth Atkinson, Patsy Walker first appeared in &quot;Miss America Magazine&quot; #2 (November 1944), published by Marvel precursor Timely Comics, and became Hellcat in &quot;The Avengers&quot; #144 (February 1976). She premiered as the star of a teen romantic-comedy series, and was later integrated into Marvel superhero franchises such as the Avengers and the Defenders as the Hellcat.

Following her reintroduction as the Hellcat, the character has been described as one of Marvel&#x27;s most notable and powerful female heroes.

Rachael Taylor portrayed [[Trish Walker (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Trish Walker]] in the Marvel Cinematic Universe (MCU) series &quot;Jessica Jones&quot; (2015–2019), &quot;Luke Cage&quot; (2016), and &quot;The Defenders&quot; (2017).

==Publication history==
===Teen-humor heroine===
Created by writer Stuart Little and artist Ruth Atkinson, Patsy Walker first appeared in &quot;Miss America Magazine&quot; #2 (cover-dated November 1944), published by Marvel precursor Timely Comics. Redheaded Patsy Walker, her parents Stanley and Betty, her boyfriend Robert &quot;Buzz&quot; Baxter, and her raven-haired friendly rival Hedy Wolfe appeared from the 1940s through 1967 in issues of &quot;Miss America&quot;, &quot;Teen Comics&quot;, &quot;Girls&#x27; Life&quot;, and the namesake teen-humor series &quot;Patsy Walker&quot;, as well as in the spin-offs &quot;Patsy and Hedy&quot;, &quot;Patsy and Her Pals&quot;, and the single-issue &quot;A Date with Patsy&quot;. Attesting to its quiet popularity, &quot;Patsy Walker&quot; (along with &quot;Millie the Model&quot; and &quot;Kid Colt, Outlaw&quot;) was among the very few titles published continuously by Marvel from the 1940s Golden Age of Comic Books, through Marvel&#x27;s 1950s iteration as Atlas Comics, and into the 1960s Silver Age of Comic Books.

Future &quot;Mad&quot; magazine cartoonist and &quot;Mad&quot; Fold-in creator Al Jaffee wrote and drew most of the early issues of &quot;Patsy Walker&quot;, several of which included &quot;Mad&quot; founding editor Harvey Kurtzman&#x27;s highly stylized &quot;Hey Look!&quot; one-page humor strips. Jaffee was succeeded by Al Hartley, who went to Archie Comics and produced many Christian comic books starring Archie characters and others. &quot;Patsy and Her Pals&quot; was drawn by Morris Weiss.
Following Patsy&#x27;s high-school graduation in issue #116 (Aug. 1964), the title switched from humor to become a young career-gal romantic adventure. &quot;Patsy Walker&quot; lasted through issue #124 (Dec. 1965), with &quot;Patsy and Hedy&quot; outlasting it to its own #110 (Feb. 1967).

Patsy and Hedy made a cameo appearance in &quot;Fantastic Four Annual&quot; #3 (Oct. 1965), which established them in the Marvel Universe. The superhero-team comic &quot;The Defenders&quot; #89 (Nov. 1980) revealed that the earlier stories were fictional works published within the fictional Marvel Universe itself, and written by Patsy&#x27;s mother Dorothy Walker though based upon Patsy&#x27;s own life and friends. The Patsy Walker profile in &quot;Marvel Legacy: The 1960s Handbook&quot; #1 (Feb. 2006) establishes that Walker indeed experienced many of the events from these stories.

&quot;Patsy Walker&quot; #95 – together with the science-fiction anthology &quot;Journey into Mystery&quot; #69 (both June 1961) – are the first modern comic books labeled &quot;Marvel Comics&quot;, with each showing an &quot;MC&quot; box on its cover.

===The Hellcat===
The Beast feature in &quot;Amazing Adventures&quot; #13 (July 1972) introduced the concept of Walker as a superhero. Writer Steve Englehart recalled that Walker&#x27;s cameo in &quot;Fantastic Four Annual&quot; #3 had:
Because the Beast feature was dropped from &quot;Amazing Adventures&quot; just three issues later, the storyline with Patsy Walker was temporarily abandoned. Walker was reintroduced in &quot;The Avengers&quot; #141 (November 1975), having resumed her maiden name of Walker, and accompanied the Avengers on a couple of adventures. Shortly thereafter, she adopted the name Hellcat, taking on superheroine Greer Grant Nelson&#x27;s costume from her discontinued identity as the Cat. The name &quot;the Hellcat&quot; itself had originally been proposed for Nelson. The suit&#x27;s look was later slightly adapted.

In 2010, Englehart recalled:
The Hellcat joined the superhero team the Defenders in issue #44 (Feb. 1977). After several adventures with the group, she met the supernatural adventurer Daimon Hellstrom, the Son of Satan, in &quot;The Defenders&quot; #92 (Feb. 1981). They married in &quot;The Defenders&quot; #125 and became husband-and-wife occult investigators, but Hellstrom&#x27;s demonic nature asserted itself, and Walker was driven first mad and then, in &quot;Hellstorm: Prince of Lies&quot; #14 (May 1994), to suicide. Through Hellstrom&#x27;s manipulation of the superhero Hawkeye, she was resurrected in &quot;Thunderbolts Annual 2000&quot;, a summer annual of the superhero-team comic &quot;Thunderbolts&quot;, and returned to Earth with new abilities acquired while in Hell. The story, which began in &quot;Thunderbolts Annual 2000&quot;, concluded in &quot;Avengers Annual 2000&quot;. A three-issue &quot;Hellcat&quot; miniseries (Sept.–Nov. 2000) took place immediately following the events in &quot;Thunderbolts Annual 2000&quot; and &quot;Avengers Annual 2000&quot;. Briefly adopting a new costume and then returning to her traditional yellow outfit, she rejoined the Defenders in a short-lived revival series, &quot;The Defenders&quot; (vol. 2) #1–12 (March 2001 – Feb. 2002).

After appearing in occasional guest roles, the Hellcat had starring roles between 2007 and 2009, thanks to husband-wife artist-writer team Stuart Immonen and Kathryn. With the impending relaunch of &quot;Marvel Comics Presents&quot;, Stuart was asked by editor Nick Lowe if he wanted to do a Hellcat story, which was spread across the title&#x27;s first four issues (Sept.–Dec. 2007). Marvel remained open for a Hellcat miniseries, and out of what Kathryn first conceived as a &quot;Hellcat Christmas Special&quot;, inspired by endurance car races in Mongolia and research on the Inuit, came the five-issue miniseries &quot;Patsy Walker: Hellcat&quot; (Sept. 2008–Feb. 2009), drawn by David Lafuente with covers by Stuart. A tie-in to the , it features the Hellcat being assigned to watch over Alaska. Following this, she was an ensemble star and narrator alongside the superheroines Firestar, the Black Cat, and Photon, in the miniseries &quot;Marvel Divas&quot; #1–4 (Sept.-Dec. 2009), which writers Roberto Aguirre-Sacasa and Tonci Zonjic had pitched it to Marvel editors as &quot;&quot;Sex and the City&quot; in the Marvel Universe&quot;.

Walker became part of the All-New Marvel NOW! event in &quot;She-Hulk&quot; (vol. 3) #2, when Jennifer Walters started her own law firm. Walters hired Patsy as her private investigator, who uses her Hellcat alias on assignments.

The All-New, All-Different Marvel line in 2015 led to a new ongoing Patsy Walker title, &quot;Patsy Walker, A.K.A. Hellcat!&quot;. Written by Kate Leth and drawn by Brittney Williams, it attempted to combine the romance and superhero comics with a more comedic approach, which Leth compared to a Saturday-morning cartoon. In it, Walker tries to establish a job agency for superpowered people following her dismissal by the She-Hulk, and also recover the rights to old &quot;Patsy Walker&quot; comics which have been republished by Hedy. In February 2017, Leth announced that the series would be ending that April with its 17th issue. She praised Marvel for &quot;giv[ing] us space to wrap up the story exactly how we wanted in 3 volumes&quot;.

==Fictional character biography==
After growing up in suburban Centerville, graduating high school and marrying high-school sweetheart Robert &quot;Buzz&quot; Baxter, Patsy Walker becomes an assistant to scientist Hank McCoy, the mutant superhero the Beast, who at that time was on hiatus from the X-Men. Estranged from her husband, now a U.S. Air Force colonel, Walker befriends McCoy, and, desiring to become a superhero, accompanies McCoy on a quest with the Avengers. She adopts a costume that formerly belonged to Greer Grant Nelson, the former masked adventuress the Cat, and takes on the name the Hellcat.

===Early superhero career, marriage, and suicide===
After having used her natural athletic abilities and good instincts to rescue the Avengers, Walker is offered membership in the team. The cosmic adventurer Moondragon persuades the Hellcat to decline and instead accompany her to Saturn&#x27;s moon Titan for training in psychic ability and advanced martial arts. Walker&#x27;s training is soon interrupted when she returns to Earth to assist the supernatural hero Doctor Strange, joining the Defenders in the process. Later Moondragon revokes her mind powers, mentioning Walker&#x27;s ineffective use of them.

She meets her future husband Daimon Hellstrom, the Son of Satan, during the course of a quest with the Defenders. After learning that her mother had promised her soul to Satan, and briefly being lied to by the devil that he was her father, Walker reunites with her real father and marries Hellstrom. The two then retire from being superheroes. Ultimately, Hellstrom&#x27;s demonic inheritance took possession of him and drove Walker insane. Institutionalized, she was driven to suicide by the otherworldly being Deathurge.

===Resurrection, &quot;Civil War&quot;, and &quot;She-Hulk&quot; (vol. 3)===
Trapped in Hell, Walker&#x27;s spirit is used in a series of gladiatorial-like combat scenarios. There, she learns to develop and use her psychic powers. Hellstrom tricks the archer superhero Hawkeye into returning her spirit to Earth; Hawkeye believes he is retrieving his presumed-dead wife, the Mockingbird, from the demonic lord Mephisto&#x27;s realm. Resurrected and back on Earth, Walker retains the powers that she developed in Hell, and she is also able to manifest a costume at will. Once again a member of the Defenders, the Hellcat focuses on combating occult evils, notably Nicholas Scratch, who had based himself in her hometown of Centerville, and the otherdimensional ruler Dormammu.

During the &quot;Civil War&quot; storyline, the Hellcat registers. She serves as one of the young superheroes&#x27; instructors at Camp Hammond. She was then assigned as the official superhero for Alaska, but eventually returned to New York City. The Hellcat develops and maintains a deep friendship with the superheroes Firestar, the Black Cat, and Monica Rambeau, partly stemming from their support to Firestar, who develops and then survives breast disease.

The Hellcat is later seen with the She-Hulk and facing personal problems. After a night of heavy drinking and partying, the Hellcat and the She-Hulk invade a warehouse that A.I.M. was using as a hideout and defeat two agents wearing high tech suits. The She-Hulk then hires the Hellcat as her private investigator to help with her economic situation. She then helps the She-Hulk in protecting Kristoff Vernard, the son of Doctor Doom, who was trying to defect to the U.S. She is later seen talking with Tigra about a case involving a lawsuit but ends up fighting her when she mentions the plaintiff&#x27;s name, George Saywitz. After recovering in a hospital, she helps the She-Hulk and Hank Pym in a recovery mission to save Reza, the partner of inventor Rufus Randall, to settle an argument between them over a device known as the Shrinko, which they were planning to sell to Pym. They later wind up helping Steve Rogers, the original Captain America, with a lawsuit involving a murder that happened in 1940.

===&quot;Patsy Walker, A.K.A. Hellcat!&quot; and &quot;Civil War II&quot;===
As part of the &quot;All-New, All-Different Marvel&quot; line, the She-Hulk eventually gets unable to afford the Hellcat as an investigator and fires her friend, which also forces Walker to move out of Walters&#x27; office building (the same place where Howard the Duck works). Walker moves to the Brooklyn apartment of Ian, an Inhuman who she met when he used his powers to steal from an armored truck. Ian gets a job with Walker&#x27;s old friend Tom Hale (known as &quot;Tubs&quot; in the romance comics) and inspires her to open a work agency for other superpowered people. To her chagrin, Walker also learns that her old rival Hedy Wolfe has obtained the rights from Walker&#x27;s late mother Dorothy to republish the &quot;Patsy Walker&quot; comics. With the help of the She-Hulk and Jessica Jones, Walker gets the rights back by proving that Dorothy was sedated and thus not in full mental capacities when she signed the comics off to Hedy, making it a void contract.

During the &quot;Civil War II&quot; storyline, Patsy Walker learns that the She-Hulk is in a coma at the Triskelion. America Chavez allows Patsy to visit her. After the visit, Patsy tells Howard the Duck and the other tenants about the She-Hulk&#x27;s current condition, and moves her offices to where Jennifer operated as a lawyer.

Afterwards, Hedy dupes Patsy&#x27;s ex-husbands Mad-Dog and Daimon Hellstrom into fighting her. Daimon sends Patsy to a dimension ruled by the demon Belial, who tries to bring the Hellcat to his side. Patsy then confronts her former friend the Black Cat, now leading a gang of criminals. Patsy suddenly catches a cold that causes her to alter reality whenever she sneezes. After several disasters, Patsy accidentally makes a building disappear. Hedy then calls Patsy and reveals that she is dating the demon Belial, who helps Patsy overcome her grief over the She-Hulk and cures her of the cold. Patsy then receives a check for a big amount of money from the She-Hulk and takes Ian, Tom, and Jubilee to the mall. While shopping, they encounter two teenage girls pretending to be supervillains, who are revealed to be Patsy&#x27;s biggest fans. Ian then figures out that the girls like each other and resolves their dispute. After that, Patsy expresses joy of how her life has changed.

==Powers and abilities==
The Hellcat possesses a superhuman level of physical abilities. She has different psionic powers due to Moondragon&#x27;s Titanian technology, including telekinesis, sensing psychic phenomena, and the ability to cast mental illusions. The Hellcat can change her nails into sharp claws. She is able to summon a magic cloak with enchanted properties at will that she uses to sense mystical phenomena or deflect mystical attacks. She uses retractable claws and grappling hooks on her wrists. Hellcat is a well-trained martial artist and gymnast.

== Reception ==
=== Critical reception ===
Peter Eckhardt of &quot;CBR.com&quot; called the Hellcat one of the &quot;best cat-themed superheroes in comics,&quot; writing, &quot;Patsy Walker wasn&#x27;t made to be a superhero. Created in 1944, Walker starred in humorous teenage girl-oriented comics like &quot;Miss America&quot; and &quot;Girls&#x27; Life&quot;. Her eponymous title was published continuously from the &#x27;40s until the &#x27;60s and Walker&#x27;s trajectory turned towards superherodom. As the Hellcat, Walker became a more feminist hero. She divorced her abusive husband, took (temporary) control of the stories that had been published using her name, and joined a superhero non-team, the Defenders, to battle unnatural evils. A humorous character with a compelling story, Hellcat remains one of Marvel&#x27;s most fun felines.&quot;

=== Accolades ===
* In 2015, &quot;Entertainment Weekly&quot; ranked the Hellcat 74th in their &quot;Let&#x27;s rank every Avenger ever&quot; list.

==== &quot;Patsy Walker: Hellcat&quot; (2008) ====
According to Diamond Comic Distributors, &quot;Patsy Walker: Hellcat&quot; #1 was the 118th best selling comic book in July 2008. &quot;Patsy Walker: Hellcat&quot; #2 was the 151st best selling comic book in August 2008.

James Hunt of &quot;CBR.com&quot; called &quot;Patsy Walker: Hellcat&quot; #1 &quot;enormously fun to read, soaked with character and humor,&quot; stating, &quot;It really has been a while since Marvel released such a charming comic, especially one so clearly aimed at a different audience than most of their superhero fare. While it&#x27;s early days for the miniseries, the strength of the first issue is practically enough to keep it running on goodwill for the remaining 4 issues. Not everyone is going to appreciate or understand the tone of &quot;Hellcat,&quot; so the important thing now is to make sure it finds its way into the hands of those that will as soon as possible, because there&#x27;s almost nothing else like it, and originality like this needs all the support it can get.&quot; Jesse Schedeen of &quot;IGN&quot; gave &quot;Patsy Walker: Hellcat&quot; #1 a grade of 8.8 out of 10, asserting, &quot;Immonen has a delightfully bombastic writing style that carries you from page to page. There&#x27;s nothing terribly realistic about Patsy&#x27;s portrayal or the events in her life. The book almost reminds me of &quot;Nextwave&quot;, except the subversive humor is more subtle. Don&#x27;t come into &quot;Patsy Walker: Hellcat&quot; expecting deep, nuanced characterization. Just expect to have plenty of fun, more than many series can offer in an entire arc. I was disappointed, though certainly not surprised, to learn that Stuart Immonen would not be returning to illustrate his wife&#x27;s work. Luckily, David la Fuente is a more than capable replacement. His style perfectly captures the wonky tone and expressive, vibrant feel of the original story. As a fashion model, half of drawing Patsy Walker is capturing her many colorful outfits. Far too many artists have problems with rendering clothing not made of spandex. La Fuente is not one of them. It&#x27;s a slow week, with only one &quot;Secret Invasion&quot; tie-in to be found. Take advantage of that and give &quot;Patsy Walker: Hellcat&quot; a shot.&quot;

==== &quot;Patsy Walker, A.K.A. Hellcat!&quot; (2015) ====
According to Diamond Comic Distributors, &quot;Patsy Walker, A.K.A. Hellcat!&quot; #1 was the 49th best selling comic book in December 2015. &quot;Patsy Walker, A.K.A. Hellcat!&quot; #1 was the 431st best selling comic book in 2015.

Chase Magnett of &quot;ComicBook.com&quot; gave &quot;Patsy Walker, A.K.A. Hellcat!&quot; #1 a grade of &quot;B,&quot; saying, &quot;The jokes and quick set up of a very large cast and lots of potential plotlines all work as well as they do largely because of Williams and Wilson&#x27;s presentation. They make the crayon-colored business presentation pop and the humorously foreboding callbacks to Walker&#x27;s teenage friends seem actually mysterious. Their delivery of each line and concept is so engaging that it&#x27;s easy to re-read &quot;Patsy Walker, A.K.A. Hellcat&quot; #1, and wait for #2 to bring the same style and laughter, and the follow through on the premises established here.&quot; Jesse Schedeen of &quot;IGN&quot; gave &quot;Patsy Walker, A.K.A. Hellcat!&quot; #1 a grade of 6.7 out of 10, writing, &quot;&quot;Patsy Walker, A.K.A. Hellcat!&quot; is a decent option for any reader who craves more of the lighthearted silliness of Marvel books like Howard the Duck or The Unbeatable Squirrel Girl. But despite the solid supporting cast and characterization, this book doesn&#x27;t really do anything those other titles don&#x27;t do better. This first issue moves slowly and has its clunky moments, but hopefully a clearer and more engaging conflict will emerge over time.&quot; Charles Pulliam-Moore of &quot;Gizmodo&quot; stated, &quot;Oftentimes, when comics set out to tell stories that humanize superheroes who are off saving the universe, they get mired in drama that somehow manages to be both weirdly familiar but utterly unrelatable. When every story tries to be an epic tale about how a hero’s greatest struggle, it becomes easy to lose sight of how a world as sprawling as Marvel’s logically fits together. On some level, Marvel understands the intrinsic appeal of these kinds of focused stories that are a touch off the traditional “mainstream” comics path. But like &quot;Mockingbird&quot;, &quot;Vision&quot;, and Nighthawk, before it, &quot;Patsy Walker&quot;″s coming to a premature end, seemingly because Marvel’s less interested in putting out thoughtful indies in an industry addicted to formulaic blockbusters. &quot;Patsy Walker&quot; isn’t a small story, or a simple one, but rather one with a solid focus on a couple of months in one woman’s during which some really important things happen around her. This is the storytelling that makes for characters that feel like real people and those are the kinds of characters that comics need more of.&quot;

====&quot;Iron Man/Hellcat Annual&quot; (2022)====
Jenna Anderson of &quot;ComicBook.com&quot; gave &quot;Iron Man/Hellcat&quot; &quot;Annual&quot; #1 a grade of 4.5 out of 5, asserting, &quot;After Tony Stark&#x27;s marriage proposal in &quot;Iron Man&quot; #20, the larger narrative to his and Patsy Walker&#x27;s stories could have gone into a wide swath of directions – which makes this week&#x27;s excellent &quot;Iron Man/Hellcat&quot; &quot;Annual&quot; an excellent, but unsurprising, triumph. The vast majority of the story puts the spotlight on Patsy, throwing her into a literally hellish confrontation with her past. It&#x27;s always a joy to read Christopher Cantwell&#x27;s essentially-solo stories for Patsy, and having her world be explored throughout this issue is an entertaining joy, especially when coupled with Ruairi Coleman&#x27;s excellent art. This issue is definitely a turning point for both Tony and Patsy – and a great one at that.&quot;

==Other versions==
===Ultimate Marvel===
Patsy Walker has appeared in Marvel Comics&#x27; Multiverse Ultimate Marvel imprint. In &quot;Ultimate Spider-Man&quot;, she first appears as a spokeswoman for a security firm, then as a swimsuit model for &quot;Maxim&quot; magazine, a talk show hostess, presenting a biography on Doctor Strange, and finally interviewing Norman Osborn. In addition, she appeared in &quot;Ultimate Marvel Team-Up&quot;, hosting an instructional video for the Baxter Building. Patsy assumes her Hellcat identity in &quot;Ultimates&quot; and was a founding member of the ill-fated Defenders. Walker later shows up with the Defenders in &quot;Ultimate Comics: New Ultimates&quot;, powered up by Loki where she sports a leopard-like appearance.

===Heroes Reborn (1996)===
In the Heroes Reborn universe, the Hellcat appears as a member of the Avengers. This version of the character sports a more bestial &quot;werecat&quot; appearance similar to Tigra. Envious of the Scarlet Witch&#x27;s beauty, she is manipulated by Loki into siding with Hawkeye against the rest of the team. Patsy takes possession of the Scarlet Witch&#x27;s body, but is killed after Agatha Harkness forcibly expels her essence.

==In other media==
===Television===

Patricia &quot;Trish&quot; Walker appears in Netflix series set in the Marvel Cinematic Universe, portrayed by Rachael Taylor as an adult and by Catherine Blades as a teenager. This version is a former child star of the in-universe television series &quot;It&#x27;s Patsy&quot;, the best friend of Jessica Jones, the host of the radio show &quot;Trish Talk&quot;, and the daughter of Dorothy Walker.
* First appearing in &quot;Jessica Jones&quot;, she aids the titular character in combating Kilgrave, but becomes jealous of her powers during the first season. By the end of the second season, Walker volunteers to undergo experimentation carried out by Dr. Karl Malus. Despite nearly dying in the process, she acquires enhanced strength, endurance, agility, balance, vision, and reflexes as well as razor-sharp nails. In between the second and third seasons, she began training excessively and used her newly acquired powers to become proficient in acrobatics and gymnastics while also seeking to develop her investigative skills like Jones. Throughout the aforementioned third season, Walker goes from being a vigilante to a self-described &quot;supervillain&quot;. Consumed by the loss of her mother at the hands of serial killer Gregory Sallinger, she gives in to her rage and begins brutally attacking, later murdering, individuals that she deems as evil regardless of their actions or motivations under the belief that it is to make the world a better place. This leads to a confrontation between her and Jones, who is forced to apprehend Walker and turn her over to the authorities. Understanding what it means to be the &quot;bad guy&quot;, Walker is sent by helicopter to the Raft.
* Walker makes a voiceover cameo in the &quot;Luke Cage&quot; episode &quot;Suckas Need Bodyguards&quot;, fielding calls from listeners on &quot;Trish Talk&quot;.

<text>Biltmore Estate is a historic house museum and tourist attraction in Asheville, North Carolina, United States. The main residence, Biltmore House (or Biltmore Mansion), is a Châteauesque-style mansion built for George Washington Vanderbilt II between 1889 and 1895 and is the largest privately owned house in the United States, at of floor space and of living area. Still owned by George Vanderbilt&#x27;s descendants, it remains one of the most prominent examples of Gilded Age mansions.

== History ==
In the 1880s, at the height of the Gilded Age, George Washington Vanderbilt II began to make regular visits with his mother, Maria Louisa Kissam Vanderbilt, to the Asheville area. He loved the scenery and climate so much that he decided to build a summer house in the area, which he called his &quot;little mountain escape&quot;. His older brothers and sisters had built luxurious summer houses in places such as Newport, Rhode Island, the Gold Coast of Long Island, and Hyde Park, New York.

=== Development ===
Vanderbilt named his estate &quot;Biltmore&quot;, combining &quot;De Bilt&quot; (his ancestors&#x27; place of origin in the Netherlands) with &quot;more&quot; (, Anglo-Saxon for &quot;moor&quot;, an open, rolling land). Vanderbilt eventually bought of land, comprising nearly 700 parcels, including over 50 farms and at least five cemeteries; a portion of the estate was once the community of Shiloh. A spokesperson for the estate said in 2017 that archives show much of the land &quot;was in very poor condition, and many of the farmers and other landowners were glad to sell.&quot;
Construction of the house began in 1889. In order to facilitate such a large project, a woodworking factory and brick kiln, which produced 32,000 bricks a day, were built onsite. A railroad spur was constructed to bring materials to the building site. Construction on the main house required the labor of about 1,000 workers and 60 stonemasons. Vanderbilt made extensive trips overseas during construction to purchase decor. He returned to North Carolina with thousands of furnishings for his newly built home, including tapestries, hundreds of carpets, prints, linens, and decorative objects, dating from the 15th century to the late 19th century. Among the few American-made items were the more practical oak drop-front desk, rocking chairs, a walnut grand piano, bronze candlesticks, and a wicker wastebasket.

=== 1890s to 1950s ===
George Vanderbilt opened his opulent estate, on Christmas Eve of 1895, to family and friends from across the country who were encouraged to enjoy leisure and country pursuits. The Gilded Age mansion reportedly cost $5 million (equivalent to about $ million today) to construct. Guests to the estate over the years included novelists Edith Wharton and Henry James, ambassadors Joseph Hodges Choate and Larz Anderson, and U.S. presidents. George married Edith Stuyvesant Dresser in 1898 in Paris, France. Their only child, Cornelia Stuyvesant Vanderbilt, was born at Biltmore in the Louis XV room in 1900 and grew up at the estate.

Stressed by Congressional passage of income tax and the expensive maintenance of the estate, Vanderbilt initiated the sale of to the federal government. After Vanderbilt&#x27;s unexpected death in 1914, of complications from an emergency appendectomy, his widow completed the sale. She carried out her husband&#x27;s wish that the land remain pristine, and that property became the nucleus of the Pisgah National Forest. Overwhelmed with running the large estate, Edith Vanderbilt began consolidating her interests, selling Biltmore Estate Industries in 1917 and Biltmore Village in 1921. She intermittently occupied the house, living in an apartment created in the former Bachelors&#x27; Wing, until the marriage of her daughter Cornelia to John Francis Amherst Cecil in April 1924. The Cecils had two sons, who were born at Biltmore in the same room where their mother was born.

In March 1930, in an attempt to bolster the estate&#x27;s finances during the Great Depression, Cornelia and her husband opened Biltmore to the public at the request of the City of Asheville, which hoped to revitalize the area with tourism.

From 1941 to 1945, during World War II, Biltmore closed. In 1942, 62 paintings and 17 sculptures were moved to the estate by train from the National Gallery of Art in Washington, D.C., to protect them in the event of an attack on the United States. The Music Room on the first floor was never finished, so it was used for storage until 1944, when the possibility of an attack became more remote. Among the works stored were the Gilbert Stuart portrait of George Washington and works by Rembrandt, Raphael, and Anthony van Dyck. David Finley, the gallery director, was a friend of Edith Vanderbilt and had stayed at the estate.

After the Cecils divorced in 1934, Cornelia left the estate, never to return, but John Cecil maintained his residence in the Bachelors&#x27; Wing until his death in 1954. Their eldest son, George Henry Vanderbilt Cecil, occupied rooms in the wing until 1956. At that point, Biltmore House ceased to be a family residence and was operated as a historic house museum. Their younger son, William A. V. Cecil Sr., returned to the estate in the late 1950s and partnered with his brother to manage the estate&#x27;s financial trouble. They worked to create the profitable and self-sustaining enterprise that their grandfather had envisioned.

=== 1960s to present ===
William Cecil inherited the estate upon the death of their mother, Cornelia, in 1976. His brother, George, inherited the more profitable dairy farm, which was spun off as Biltmore Farms.

In 1995, while celebrating the estate&#x27;s centenary, William Cecil turned over control of the company to his son, William A. V. Cecil Jr. The Biltmore Company is privately held. Of the that make up Biltmore Estate, only are within the city limits of Asheville, and the Biltmore House is not part of any municipality.

The estate was designated a National Historic Landmark in 1963, and remains a major tourist attraction in western North Carolina, with around 1.4 million visitors each year.

Since the death of William A. V. Cecil in October 2017 and his wife Mimi Cecil in November, their daughter Dini Pickering has served as board chair and their son Bill Cecil as chief executive officer. The house is assessed at $157.2 million, although due to an agricultural deferment, county property taxes are paid on only $79.1 million.

The estate was temporarily closed after Hurricane Helene in September 2024. Though the group sales office was destroyed, the Biltmore House, conservatory, and several structures survived without serious damage. The estate&#x27;s operators subsequently pledged $2 million for hurricane recovery efforts in Western North Carolina. Biltmore Estate reopened in November 2024.

== Architecture ==

Vanderbilt commissioned prominent New York architect Richard Morris Hunt, who had previously designed houses for various Vanderbilt family members, to design the house in the Châteauesque style. Hunt used French Renaissance châteaux as inspiration. Vanderbilt and Hunt had visited several in early 1889, including Château de Blois, Chenonceau and Chambord in France and Waddesdon Manor in England. These estates shared steeply pitched roofs, turrets, and sculptural ornamentation.

=== Form and facade ===
Hunt sited the four-story Indiana limestone-built home to face east, with a facade to fit into the mountainous topography behind. The facade is asymmetrically balanced with two projecting wings connecting to the entrance tower: an open loggia is to the left side and a windowed arcade to the right, which holds the Winter Garden that was fashionable during the Victorian era. The entrance tower contains a series of windows with decorated jambs that extend from the front door to the most decorated dormer at Biltmore on the fourth floor. The carved decorations include trefoils, flowing tracery, rosettes, gargoyles and, at prominent lookouts, grotesques. The staircase is one of the more prominent features of the east facade, with its three-story, highly decorated winding balustrade with carved statues of St. Louis and Joan of Arc by the Austrian-born architectural sculptor Karl Bitter.
The south facade is the house&#x27;s smallest and is dominated by three large dormers on the east side and a polygonal turret on the west. An arbor is attached to the house and is accessed from the library, which is located on the ground floor. On the north end of the house, Hunt placed the attached stables, carriage house and its courtyard to protect the house and gardens from the wind. The complex housed Vanderbilt&#x27;s prized driving horses. The carriage house opposite the stables stored his twenty carriages in addition to any of his guests&#x27; carriages.

The rear western elevation is less elaborate than the front facade, with some windows not having any decoration at all. Two matching polygonal towers in the center are connected to the polygonal south turret by an open loggia that opens the main rooms of the house to the views of the Blue Ridge Mountains in the distance. The loggia is decorated overhead with terracotta tiles set in a herringbone pattern. The self-supporting ceramic tile vault and arch system was used extensively inside and outside of Biltmore, and was patented by Rafael Guastavino, a Spanish architect and engineer who personally supervised the installation. The limestone columns were carved to reflect the sunlight in aesthetically pleasing and varied ways per Vanderbilt&#x27;s wish. The rusticated base is a contrast to the smooth limestone used on the remainder of the house.

The steeply pitched roof is punctuated by sixteen chimneys and covered with slate tiles that were affixed one by one. Each tile was drilled at the corners and wired onto the attic&#x27;s steel infrastructure. Copper flashing was installed at the junctions to prevent water from penetrating. The fanciful flashing on the ridge of the roof was embossed with George Vanderbilt&#x27;s initials and motifs from his family crest, though the original gold leaf no longer survives.

=== Interiors ===
Biltmore has of floor space and 250 rooms in the house, including 35 bedrooms for family and guests, 43 bathrooms, 65 fireplaces, three kitchens and 19th-century novelties such as an electric Otis elevator, forced-air heating, centrally controlled clocks, fire alarms and a call bell system. Biltmore House had electricity from the time it was built, though initially it received direct current electricity due to Vanderbilt&#x27;s friendship with Thomas Edison. With electricity less safe and fire more of a danger at the time, the house had six separate sections divided by brick fire walls.

==== First floor ====
The principal rooms of the house are located on the ground floor. To the right of the marbled Entrance Hall, the octagonal sunken Winter Garden is surrounded by stone archways with a ceiling of architecturally sculptured wood and multifaceted glass. The centerpiece is a marble and bronze fountain sculpture titled &quot;Boy Stealing Geese&quot;, created by Karl Bitter. On the walls just outside the Winter Garden are copies of the Parthenon frieze. The Banquet Hall is the largest room in the house, measuring , with a high barrel-vaulted ceiling. The table can seat 64 guests and is surrounded by rare Flemish tapestries and a triple fireplace that spans one end of the hall. On the opposite end of the hall is an organ gallery that houses a 1916 Skinner pipe organ. Left unfinished with bare brick walls, the Music Room was not completed and opened to the public until 1976. It showcases a mantel designed by Hunt, and a print of the large engraving by Albrecht Dürer called the &quot;Triumphal Arch&quot;, commissioned by Holy Roman Emperor Maximilian I. The mantel had been stored in the stable for over 80 years.

To the left of the entrance hall is the long Tapestry Gallery, which leads to the Library, featuring three 16th-century tapestries representing &quot;The Triumph of Virtue Over Vice&quot;. Elsewhere on the walls are family portraits by John Singer Sargent, Giovanni Boldini, and James Whistler. The two-story Library contains over 10,000 volumes in eight languages, reflecting George Vanderbilt&#x27;s broad interests in classic literature as well as works on art, history, architecture, and gardening. The library also houses a concealed passageway that leads to the guest rooms.

The second-floor balcony is accessed by an ornate walnut spiral staircase. The Baroque detailing of the room is enhanced by the rich walnut paneling and the ceiling painting, &quot;The Chariot of Aurora&quot;, brought to Biltmore by Vanderbilt from the Palazzo Pisani Moretta in Venice, Italy. The painting by Giovanni Antonio Pellegrini is the most important work by the artist still in existence.

==== Second floor ====

The second floor is accessed by the cantilevered Grand Staircase of 107 steps spiraling around a four-story, wrought-iron chandelier holding 72 light bulbs. The second-floor Living Hall is an extension of the grand staircase as a formal hall and portrait gallery, and was restored to its original configuration in 2013. Several large-scale masterpieces are displayed in the hall, including two John Singer Sargent portraits of Biltmore&#x27;s architect, Richard Morris Hunt, and landscaper, Frederick Law Olmsted, both commissioned for the home by Vanderbilt. Located nearby in the south tower is George Vanderbilt&#x27;s gilded bedroom with furniture designed by Hunt. His bedroom connects to his wife&#x27;s Louis XV-style, oval-shaped bedroom in the north tower through a Jacobean carved oak paneled sitting room with an intricate ceiling.

The suite of rooms includes:
* the Damask Room, with silk damask draperies and distinct damask-style wallpaper;
* the Claude Room, named after one of Vanderbilt&#x27;s favorite artists, Claude Lorrain;
* the Tyrolean Chimney Room, featuring an overmantel made from a , a type of tile oven that stored large amounts of heat, then released it slowly over a long period; and
* the Louis XV Room, the most grand, so named due to its architectural scheme and furnishings that were very popular in the late nineteenth century. The suite was restored and opened to the public for the first time in 100 years in 2011.

==== Third and fourth floors ====
The third floor has a number of guest rooms with names that describe the furnishing or artist that they were decorated with. The fourth floor has 21 bedrooms that were inhabited by housemaids, laundresses, and other female servants. Also included on the fourth floor is an Observatory with a circular staircase that leads to a wrought iron balcony with doorways to the rooftop where Vanderbilt could view his estate. Male servants were not housed here, however, but instead resided in rooms above the stable and complex.

==== Bachelors&#x27; Wing ====
The Billiard Room is decorated with an ornamental plaster ceiling and rich oak paneling and was equipped with both a custom-made pool table and a carom table (table without pockets). The room was mainly frequented by men, but ladies were welcome to enter as well. Secret door panels on either side of the fireplace led to the private quarters of the Bachelors&#x27; Wing where female guests and staff members were not allowed. The wing includes the Smoking Room, which was fashionable for country houses, and the Gun Room, which held mounted trophies and displayed George Vanderbilt&#x27;s gun collection.

==== Basement ====
The basement level featured activity rooms, including an indoor, heated swimming pool with underwater lighting, a bowling alley, and a gymnasium with once state-of-the-art fitness equipment. The service hub of the house is also found in the largest basement in the country. It holds the main kitchen, pastry kitchen, rotisserie kitchen, walk-in refrigerators that provided an early form of mechanical refrigeration, the servants&#x27; dining hall, laundry rooms, and additional bedrooms for staff.
==== Conservatory ====
In the conservatory, which has many flowers and trees growing in it, there is also an elevated model railway.
== Park and landscape ==
Vanderbilt envisioned a park-like setting for his home and employed landscape architect Frederick Law Olmsted to design the grounds. Olmsted was not impressed with the condition of the and advised having a park surround the house, establishing farms along the river, and replanting the rest as a commercial timber forest, a plan to which Vanderbilt agreed. Gifford Pinchot and later Carl A. Schenck were hired to manage the forests, with Schenck establishing the first forestry education program in the U.S. in 1898, the Biltmore Forest School, on the estate grounds.

Another important aspect of the landscaping was the intentionally rustic four-mile (5  km) Approach track that began at the brick quoined and pebbledash stucco Lodge Gate at the edge of Biltmore Village and ended at the sphinx-topped stone pillars at the Esplanade. In between, the lane was densely planted along the borders with natural and uncultivated-looking foliage and shrubbery to provide a relaxing journey for guests. Olmsted made sure to incorporate of formal gardens, which had been requested by Vanderbilt for the grounds directly surrounding the house. He constructed a Roman formal garden, a formal garden, a bush and tulip garden, water fountains, and a conservatory with individual rooms for palms and roses. There was also a bowling green, an outdoor tea room, and a terrace to incorporate the European statuary that Vanderbilt had brought back from his travels. At the opposite end of the Esplanade is the (French for &quot;gentle/soft ramp&quot;), a graduated stairway zigzagging along a rough-cut limestone wall that leads to the grassy slope known as the Vista, topped with a statue of Diana, the goddess of the hunt.

Water was an important aspect of Victorian landscaping, and Olmsted incorporated two elements for the estate: the Bass Pond created from an old creek-fed millpond and the Lagoon. Each was used for guest recreation such as fishing and rowing. To supply water for the estate, Olmsted engineered two reservoirs. One was a spring-fed man-made lake on nearby Busbee Mountain. The other was a man-made, brick-lined reservoir, located behind the statue of Diana in the Vista, at an elevation of approximately above the Esplanade.

== Estate ==

Vanderbilt&#x27;s idea was to replicate the working estates of Europe. He asked Richard Morris Hunt and Frederick Law Olmsted to design a village with architecturally compatible buildings and picturesque landscaping. He intended it to be a source of income through rental cottages, a place to help carry out philanthropic programs, and an easy point of access between the estate and the train station. The result was Biltmore Village. The village was mostly designed by Richard Sharp Smith, supervising architect of Biltmore, included rental cottages complete with plumbing and central heating, a post office, shops, doctor&#x27;s office, school, and a church, known today as the Cathedral of All Souls.

Intending the estate to be self-supporting, Vanderbilt set up scientific forestry programs, poultry farms, cattle farms, hog farms, and dairy. His wife, Edith, also enthusiastically supported agricultural reform and promoted the establishment of a state agricultural fair. In 1901, the Vanderbilts provided financial assistance to Biltmore Industries, started by Biltmore Village resident Eleanor Vance, which taught young people how to make hand-carved furniture, woven baskets, homespun wool fabric, and more.

The estate today covers approximately and is split in half by the French Broad River. The estate is overseen by The Biltmore Company, a trust set up by the family. The company is a large enterprise that is one of the largest employers in the Asheville area. Restaurants were opened in 1979, 1987, and 1995, and four gift shops in 1993. The former dairy barn was converted into the Biltmore Winery in 1985. The 210-room luxury hotel, named The Inn on Biltmore Estate, opened in 2001. In 2010, the estate opened Antler Hill Village, consisting of shops and restaurants, as well as a remodeled winery, and connected farmyard. In 2015, the Village Hotel on Biltmore Estate, a more casual option to The Inn with 209 rooms, was opened in Antler Hill Village.

== In popular culture ==
The estate has been used on numerous occasions as a filming location for movies and television shows. These have included &quot;The Swan&quot; (1956), &quot;Being There&quot; (1979), &quot;The Private Eyes&quot; (1980), &quot;Mr. Destiny&quot; (1990), &quot;The Last of the Mohicans&quot; (1992), &quot;Forrest Gump&quot; (1994), &quot;Richie Rich&quot; (1994), &quot;My Fellow Americans&quot; (1996), &quot;Patch Adams&quot; (1998), &quot;Hannibal&quot; (2001) and &quot;The Odd Life of Timothy Green&quot; (2012).

The Hallmark Channel movie &quot;A Biltmore Christmas&quot; was filmed at Biltmore House in January 2023, and was first aired the following November. It was the first movie in which the setting was Biltmore House.

Popular figures who have visited the Biltmore Estate include: Robert Redford, Tom Hanks, Robin Williams, Robert Downey, Jr., Jimmy Carter, Bill and Melinda Gates, Walter Cronkite, and Anthony Hopkins.

The Biltmore Estate is the setting for Robert Beatty&#x27;s historical fiction fantasy Serafina Series.

<text>Margery S. Bronster (born December 12, 1957) is a lawyer who served as Attorney General of Hawaii from 1995 to 1999.

==Career==
Bronster graduated from Brown University, where she became fluent in Mandarin Chinese, and then Columbia University Law School in 1982. She went into private practice for Shearman &amp; Sterling in New York City in litigation. She moved to Honolulu, Hawaii in 1988, and joined the firm Carlsmith Ball Wichman Murray Case &amp; Ichiki. That law firm is now known as Carlsmith Ball, LLP.

In 1995, she was appointed as the first woman to hold the office of Attorney General of Hawaii for a full term.

During her tenure in the Democratic administration of Governor of Hawaii Benjamin J. Cayetano, she won the state a multibillion-dollar Master Settlement Agreement from tobacco companies. In 1997, she led an investigation into abuses by the Kamehameha Schools/Bishop Estate trustees. She was reappointed to a second term by Cayetano, but her investigation of Bishop Estate trustees caused her to fall out of favor with the Hawaii State Legislature, resulting in her failed confirmation to a second term by the state senate in 1999. She was replaced as Attorney General by Earl I. Anzai, who was formerly budget director.

Bronster then became a founding partner in the Honolulu-based Bronster Crabtree &amp; Hoshibata, now Bronster Fujichaku Robbins. Best Lawyers in America recognized her as 2016 &quot;Lawyer of the Year&quot; in Honolulu, in the practice area of Insurance Litigation.

<text>The Royal College of Dentists of Canada (RCDC, the College; ) is the Canadian national organization dedicated to maintaining high standards of practice and promoting excellence in dental specialties. Established in 1965, the RCDC aims to ensure the quality of dental care in Canada by recognizing qualified dental specialists. It is headquartered are in Toronto, Ontario.
As outlined in its Constitution, the Royal College of Dentists of Canada’s primary objectives are:

* To promote high standards of specialization in the dental profession.
* To set up qualifications for and provide for the recognition and designation of properly trained dental specialists.
* To encourage the establishment of training programs in the dental specialties in Canadian schools; and
* To provide for the recognition and designation of dentists who possess special qualifications in areas not recognized as specialties.

The College administers the National Dental Specialty Examination (NDSE), which is a critical component in the certification process for dentists wishing to become recognized specialists. This examination is a requirement for provincial licensure within Canada.
RCDC also supports continuing education, professional development, and networking opportunities for its Fellows and Members, fostering collaboration and advancement in the dental profession. Fellows receive the post-nominal letters FRCDC.

<doc id="801647" wikidata="Q1468312" url="?curid=801647" title="United States Anti-Doping Agency">
<text>The United States Anti-Doping Agency (USADA, ) is a non-profit, non-governmental 501(c)(3) organization and the national anti-doping organization (NADO) for the United States. To protect clean competition and the integrity of sport and prevent doping in the United States with a performance-enhancing substance, the USADA provides education, leads scientific initiatives, conducts testing, and oversees the results management process. Headquartered in Colorado Springs, Colorado, USADA is a signatory to the World Anti-Doping Code, which harmonizes anti-doping practices around the world, and is widely considered the basis for the strongest and strictest anti-doping programs to prevent doping in sport.

In 2001, USADA was recognized by the U.S. Congress as &quot;the official anti-doping agency for Olympic, Pan American and Paralympic sport in the United States.&quot; While USADA is not a government entity, it is partly funded by the Office of National Drug Control Policy (ONDCP), with its remaining budget generated from contracts for anti-doping services with sport organizations, most notably the United States Olympic and Paralympic Committee (USOPC). The United States has also ratified the UNESCO International Convention against Doping in Sport, the first global international treaty against doping in sport, and largely relies on USADA to carry out this commitment.

Travis Tygart has been the chief executive officer of USADA since September 2007.

==History==
In October 1999, the USOC launched USADA and operations began on October 1, 2000. In 2003, one of USADA&#x27;s first major undertakings was the revision of the then-current United States anti-doping policies in order to bring them into compliance with the newly adopted World Anti-Doping Code. One of the major adjustments made to the Code by USADA included reducing the standard of proof required in doping-related adjudication. Before modifications, the standard of proof was equal to that required in a United States court of law. After modification, USADA reduced the standard required to establish a doping violation to &quot;comfortable satisfaction of a hearing body&quot;.

Notably, USADA were contracted by the UFC to act as an anti-doping authority within the organization, with the partnership beginning in 2015. However, during a publicized dispute over the eligibility of Conor McGregor to rejoin the UFC&#x27;s roster following a period of absence from USADA&#x27;s athlete testing pool, USADA announced that they would not renew their contract with the UFC. The deal between USADA and the UFC is set to expire in 2024, after which the UFC&#x27;s roster will no longer be subject to USADA testing.

Currently, USADA&#x27;s status and independence from the USOPC contrasts the norm in sport in the United States, as most professional sport organizations (MLB, NFL, NBA, NHL) manage the anti-doping functions of their own sports. As a result of USADA&#x27;s ongoing multi-year contracts with the USOPC and the sport national governing bodies (USA Track &amp; Field, USA Cycling, USA Swimming, US Soccer, etc.), the agency is responsible for managing anti-doping programs, including testing and results management, for each sport&#x27;s athletes and events throughout the year. Despite its name and status as the country&#x27;s official anti-doping organization, USADA is a private organization and not subject to government oversight.

==World Anti-Doping Code==
USADA is responsible for implementation of the World Anti-Doping Agency&#x27;s Code (Code) in the United States. The Code is the core document that harmonizes anti-doping policies, rules, and regulations within sport organizations and among public authorities around the world. It works in conjunction with five International Standards, which aim to foster consistency among anti-doping organizations in: testing; laboratories; therapeutic use exemptions; the list of prohibited substances and methods; and the protection of privacy and personal information. The Code&#x27;s International Standards are as follows:
* &quot;WADA Prohibited List&quot;Outlines the substances and methods prohibited in sport;
* &quot;International Standard for Testing and Investigations&quot; (ISTI)test planning and sample collection process;
* &quot;International Standard for Laboratories&quot; (ISL)Standard for the caliber of laboratories that can process athlete samples;
* &quot;International Standard for Therapeutic Use Exemptions&quot; (ISTUE)The approval process for allowing athletes to obtain exemptions for prohibited substances when a legitimate medical reason exists;
* &quot;International Standard for Protection of Privacy and Personal Information&quot; (ISPPPI)Privacy protections when collecting and using athlete personal information.
The International Olympic Committee (IOC) required that all Olympic sports adopt the World Anti-Doping Code prior to August 13, 2004.

===Testing ===
The USADA Protocol for Olympic and Paralympic Movement Testing outlines the organization&#x27;s testing program and is consistent with the WADA Code and International Standard for Testing. USADA collects both blood and urine samples during in-competition and out-of-competition tests, which can occur at any time, at any location, and without advance notice. Comprehensive, no-notice testing programs like USADA&#x27;s that are consistent with the WADA Code have often been referred to as Olympic style drug testing.

The United States Olympic and Paralympic Committee (USOPC), USOPC-recognized National Governing Bodies for sport (NGBs), and the World Anti-doping Agency (WADA) Code have authorized USADA to test and adjudicate anti-doping rule violations for any athlete who:
* Is a member or license holder of a sport National Governing Body (NGB)
* Is participating at an Event or Competition sanctioned by the USOPC or an NGB or participating at an Event or Competition in the United States sanctioned by an International Federation (IF)
* Is a foreign athlete who is present in the United States
* Has given his/her consent to testing by USADA or who has submitted a Whereabouts Filing to USADA or an IF within the previous 12 months and has not given his or her NGB and USADA written notice of retirement
* Has been named by the USOPC or an NGB to an international team or who is included in the USADA Registered Testing Pool (&quot;USADA RTP&quot;) or is competing in a qualifying event to represent the USOPC or NGB in international competition
* Is a United States athlete or foreign athlete present in the United States who is serving a period of Ineligibility on account of an anti-doping rule violation and who has not given prior written notice of retirement from all sanctioned competition to the applicable NGB and USADA, or the applicable foreign anti-doping agency or foreign sport association
* Is being tested by USADA under authorization from the USOPC, an NGB, IF, any NADO, WADA, the International Olympic Committee (&quot;IOC&quot;), the International Paralympic Committee (&quot;IPC&quot;) or the organizing committee of any Event or Competition.

USADA does testing for International Federations (IFs), other National Anti-Doping Organizations (NADOs), and the World Anti-Doping Agency. USADA does not test at the Olympic Games. The Local Organizing Committee for the Olympic Games and WADA oversee testing at the Games.

USADA maintains a group of elite athletes as part of its registered testing pool (RTP). Consistent with the WADA Code, athletes in this pool are subject to strict whereabouts requirements in which they must inform the organization of their whereabouts (specific locations) at all times so they can be located for no-notice testing. Critics of WADA Code whereabouts requirements have criticized the requirement as overly strict, while proponents claim the requirement ensure athletes cannot evade tests and take advantage of testing gaps.

USADA determines its test distribution plan (TDP) or the determination of who, when, and where the organization tests through a combination of many factors that are consistent with the WADA IST. Factors for determining tests may include:
* Physical demands of the sport and possible performance-enhancing effect that doping may elicit
* Available doping analysis statistics
* Available research on doping trends
* The history of doping in the sport and/or discipline
* Training periods and the competition calendar, season
* Information received on possible doping practices
* Resources aimed at the detection of doping may be specifically targeted.

Even though testing may be described as random, the term &quot;random&quot; is inaccurate, as USADA uses various factors to strategically plan when and where they test athletes. High-profile or elite athletes are tested significantly more frequently than others.

USADA&#x27;s sample collection process is also consistent with the WADA IST and tests are conducted by doping control officers (DCOs), who are employed and extensively trained by USADA. For tests in which blood is collected, USADA contracts trained phlebotomists who work in conjunction with a USADA DCO.

In accordance with the WADA International Standard for Laboratories, all samples are analyzed at laboratories that have been accredited by the World Anti-Doping Agency. In the United States there are only two WADA-accredited labs: the UCLA Olympic Analytical Laboratory in Los Angeles, CA., and the Sports Medicine Research and Testing Laboratory (SMRTL) in Salt Lake City, Utah. WADA accredited labs comply with the WADA International Standard for Laboratories.

===Results management===
In compliance with the World Anti-Doping Code and relevant international standards, USADA is charged with handling the results management and adjudication process for U.S. athletes in Olympic, Paralympic, Pan American and ParaPan American Sport. This independent results management process removes the inherent conflict of interest associated with sport organizations trying to both promote and police their sports.

Results management involves processing and communicating the results of drug tests, as well as the adjudication of potential anti-doping rule violations (ADRVs), which can be the result of a positive drug test or an investigation. According to the Code, an ADRV consists of the following:

* Presence of a prohibited substance or its metabolites or markers in an athlete&#x27;s sample
* Use or attempted use by an athlete of a prohibited substance or a prohibited method
* Evading, refusing, or failing to submit to sample collection
* Violation of applicable requirements regarding athlete availability for out-of-competition testing, including failure to file required whereabouts information and missed tests
* Any combination of three missed tests and/or filing failures, as defined in the International Standard for Testing and Investigations, within a 12-month period by an athlete in a Registered Testing Pool * Tampering or attempted tampering with any part of doping control
* Possession of a prohibited substance or a prohibited method
* Trafficking or attempted trafficking of any prohibited substance or prohibited method
* Administration or attempted administration to any athlete in-competition of any prohibited substance or prohibited method, or administration or attempted administration to any athlete out-of-competition of any prohibited substance or any prohibited method that is prohibited out-of-competition
* Complicity: Assisting, encouraging, aiding, abetting, conspiring, covering up, or any other type of intentional complicity involving an anti-doping rule violation, or attempted anti-doping rule violation
* Association by an athlete or other person subject to the authority of an Anti-Doping Organization in a professional or sport-related capacity with any athlete support person who is serving a period of ineligibility related to one of the above ADRVs; and/or has been convicted outside of sport to have engaged in conduct that would be considered an ADRV.

When evidence meeting one or more of the above violations is found, an independent anti-doping review board will make the recommendation whether USADA should move forward with a sanction. Athletes can either accept or challenge the sanction through an established legal process. In the United States, athletes can take a case before an arbitration panel (American Arbitration Association / North American Court of Arbitration for Sport) and make a final appeal to the Court of Arbitration for Sport.

Sanctions normally include one or more of the following:

* Disqualification of results in a particular competition or event
* Forfeiture of any medals, points, and prizes
* Team disqualification and forfeiture
* An ineligibility period that may vary according to circumstances
* Public announcement
* Name and offense listed on USADA&#x27;s website indefinitely

Sanctions have ranged from public warnings or time served for completing education (often the case for marijuana offenses), to life-time bans for repeated or particularly egregious cases. USADA maintains a sanctions list of all sanctioned athletes on its website.

===Drug Reference Resources and Therapeutic Use Exemptions (TUE)===
Athletes subject to testing by USADA have access to a number of resources designed to help athletes understand prohibited substances and if specific medications are prohibited according to the WADA prohibited List. In addition to a drug reference phone line, where athletes can speak to an expert, USADA has partnered with Antidoping Switzerland (ADCH), UK Anti-Doping (UKAD), and the Canadian Centre for Ethics in Sport (CCES) to provide the Global Drug Reference Online (GlobalDRO) tool. The tool allows athletes to search for the prohibited or not-prohibited status of a medication, by brand or generic drug name, as well as ingredients.

==Other programs==
===Science and research===
In the years 2001-2009, USADA budgeted $2 million per year to support research that advanced the deterrence and detection of performance-enhancing drugs in sport. USADA supported research in a variety of areas, including anabolic steroids, growth hormone, oxygen transport-enhancing substances, genetic doping, ethics, and Isotope Ratio Mass Spectrometry.

Since 2009, the majority of anti-doping research activities previously undertaken by USADA has been assumed by the Partnership for Clean Competition. The Partnership for Clean Competition (PCC) was founded in 2008 by the U.S. Olympic Committee, the National Football League, Major League Baseball, and the U.S. Anti-Doping Agency as a Washington D.C. non-profit corporation.

===Education and outreach===
USADA focuses on deterring the use of performance-enhancing drugs in sport through education efforts that are targeted at elite-level athletes, as well as other levels of sport, youth athletes, and the general public. In addition to topics surrounding performance-enhancing drug use in sport, USADA claims to be an important promoter of other positive values associated with sport (sportsmanship, respect, teamwork.) In March 2011, USADA released a research report titled &quot;What Sport Means in America: A Study of Sports Role In Society&quot;. The report aimed to measure the value of sport in American society and attitudes about the importance of protecting sport&#x27;s integrity.

===Supplements===
USADA created an online resource designed to provide athletes with the best possible information to evaluate the risks associated with the use of supplements. On Supplement411.org there is information to help athletes realize that risk exists, recognize risk when they see it, and reduce their risk of testing positive or experiencing harmful health effects from the use of dietary supplements.

===UFC Anti-Doping Program===
At the time of its launch in June 2015, the Ultimate Fighting Championship (UFC) Anti-Doping Program became the first independent anti-doping program in major fighting sports.

To familiarize athletes to the program, the UFC and USADA launched a joint education campaign, meeting athletes for in-person education sessions at gyms and events around the world. By the end of 2016, the Program had hosted at least 25 in-person education seminars internationally. Athletes were additionally provided access to anti-doping resources via USADA.

USADA&#x27;s UFC Anti-Doping Program began testing athletes both in and out-of-competition at increasing rates. In the first 18 months of the Program, more than 2,000 tests were completed. The Program&#x27;s testing pool has also grown to include around 550 athletes worldwide, with tests collected in nearly 20 countries.

On September 28, 2018, it was reported that UFC and USADA would no longer immediately announce potential doping violations within the UFC roster. Instead, all fighters would be given the opportunity of an adjudication process before an announcement of the potential violation. This agreement came after several cases of fighters including Junior dos Santos, Josh Barnett and Cris Cyborg were flagged for potential doping violations, but later had their respective punishments dismissed after it was found that the fighters had unintentionally consumed, or otherwise injested, performance enhancing drug (usually in the form of contaminated supplements).

In January 2021, USADA announced that UFC fighters would no longer be punished for cannabis use except in extreme cases where clear signs of intoxication were present at the time of a fight.

In October 2023, USADA announced that they would no longer oversee the UFC&#x27;s anti-doping program once their contract with the company ends in December 2023. The announcement coincided with the return of prolific UFC fighter Conor McGregor to the USADA testing pool after withdrawing from testing in 2022 after sustaining a severe injury. In the statement released by USADA, CEO Travis Tygart stated that &quot;[USADA had] been clear and firm with the UFC that there should be no exception given by the UFC for McGregor to fight until he has returned two negative tests and been in the pool for at least six months.&quot;, confirming speculation surrounding the involvement of McGregor&#x27;s UFC-roster eligibility in the split between USADA and the UFC.

==Notable prosecutions==
===Lance Armstrong===
In June 2012, USADA charged retired cyclist Lance Armstrong with an anti-doping rule violation. The charges followed a dropped federal investigation involving charges relating to Armstrong&#x27;s time on the US Postal Service professional cycling team (1998–2004). Armstrong sued USADA claiming that USADA did not have jurisdiction to bring a case forward, and that if forced to arbitrate his case, he would not receive due process. In &quot;Armstrong v. United States Anti-Doping Agency and Travis Tygart&quot;, Armstrong lost his battle with USADA, as the District Court found sufficiency within USA Cycling&#x27;s agreement with the USOC to adhere to the USADA Protocol.

The District Court found, that as a member of USA Cycling, Armstrong was thereby beholden to the USADA Protocol, which required that all contested charges of doping be tried through NAS and CAS arbitration. In its decision, the District Court noted that other federal courts have held similar, limited views on the role that federal courts should play regarding eligibility and arbitration issues within Olympic sports. Echoing the holdings of &quot;Slaney v. The International Amateur Athletic Federation&quot; and &quot;Harding v. U.S. Figure Skating Association&quot;, the District Court held that &quot;federal courts should not interfere with an amateur sports organization&#x27;s disciplinary procedures unless the organization shows wanton disregard for its rules, to the immediate and irreparable harm of a plaintiff, where the plaintiff has no other available remedy.&quot; The lawsuit was ultimately dismissed. On August 23, 2012; Armstrong announced he would not take part in arbitration. While he maintained his innocence, he contended that he could not take part in a &quot;one-sided and unfair&quot; process. In response, Armstong was given a life ban by USADA from competing in any sport that uses the World Anti-Doping Code, effectively ending his competitive career. He was also stripped of his seven Tour de France titles from 1999 to 2005.

A month later, USADA released a 200-page &quot;reasoned decision&quot; in accordance with WADA protocol. It named Armstrong as the ringleader of &quot;the most sophisticated, professionalized and successful doping program that sport has ever seen.&quot; In response to Armstrong&#x27;s argument that the eight-year statute of limitations for doping offenses had long since expired, USADA replied that the statute of limitations for doping offenses did not apply because of Armstrong&#x27;s &quot;fraudulent concealment&quot; of his doping. Longstanding precedent in U.S. law holds that the statute of limitations does not apply in cases of fraudulent conduct by a defendant.

Based on evidence received during the Armstrong investigation and its prosecutions, USADA forwarded its &quot;reasoned decision&quot; document and supporting information to the Union Cycliste International, the World Anti-Doping Agency, and the World Triathlon Corporation. USADA claimed that:

===BALCO investigation===

The Bay Area Laboratory Co-operative (BALCO) was a San Francisco Bay Area business that supplied anabolic steroids to professional athletes. BALCO was founded by Victor Conte, who sourced the drugs from Illinois chemist Patrick Arnold and distributed them with the help of personal trainer Greg Anderson. Together, they sold substances like erythropoietin and human growth hormone undetected from 1988 until 2002, when the official federal investigation of BALCO began.

In the summer of 2003, USADA investigators received a syringe with trace amounts of a mysterious substance and launched their own investigation. The syringe went to Don Catlin, MD, the founder and then-director of the UCLA Olympic Analytical Laboratory, who had developed a testing process for the substance, tetrahydrogestrinone (THG). He tested 550 existing samples from athletes, of which 20 proved to be positive for THG.

A number of athletes, including Marion Jones, Kelli White, British sprinter Dwain Chambers, shot putter Kevin Toth, middle distance runner Regina Jacobs, and hammer throwers John McEwen and Melissa Price were subsequently incriminated in the investigation.

===TJ Dillashaw===
In April 2019, UFC bantamweight champion TJ Dillashaw voluntarily relinquished his title, after adverse findings in a USADA test before his fight with Henry Cejudo. The test showed that Dillashaw tested positive for EPO, which he admitted to using. Blood doping was not commonly tested for in the UFC by that point, making this a milestone case.

==Conflict with WADA==
On 7 August 2024, the World Anti-Doping Agency accused the United States Anti-Doping Agency (USADA) of having permitted athletes caught doping to compete as undercover agents in order to identify other drug cheats. WADA stated that it discovered at least three cases of athletes who had violated anti-doping rules and were permitted to compete for years while serving as undercover agents for USADA. On August 8, 2024, the China Anti-Doping Agency (CHINADA) strongly urged that an independent investigation be conducted into the matter. On 8 September 2024, WADA confirmed it has begun a compliance review of USADA.

<text>The nonfiction book The Two Ocean War: A Short History of the United States Navy in the Second World War by U.S. naval historian Samuel Eliot Morison, is a revised and shortened version of his multi-volume &quot;History of United States Naval Operations in World War II&quot;. The one-volume book is 611 pages long.

== Publication ==
The first edition was published in 1963 by Little, Brown and Company. 
== Reception ==
The book was reviewed several times after being published. A reviewer in the &quot;Journal of International Affairs&quot; wrote that &quot;the book is an excellent summation&quot; of Morison&#x27;s earlier &quot;History of United States Naval Operations in World War&quot; &quot;II&quot; and one published in the &quot;Pacific Historical Review&quot; praised the book as a &quot;coherent and tight volume, swift-paced and lively&quot;. They noted that there were fewer omissions from the condensing than &quot;one would have expected&quot; but also criticized its coverage of &quot;larger aspects of the war&quot;. They concluded that &quot;for the layman it is a superb account of the navy in World War II.&quot; The &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot; deemed the book a &quot;substantial accomplishment&quot; and titled its review: &quot;History of World War II Naval Battles Impresses&quot;.

<doc id="801653" wikidata="Q5186859" url="?curid=801653" title="Criticism of the war on terror">
<text>Criticism of the war on terror addresses the morals, ethics, efficiency, economics, as well as other issues surrounding the war on terror. It also touches upon criticism against the phrase itself, which was branded as a misnomer. The notion of a &quot;war&quot; against &quot;terrorism&quot; has proven highly contentious, with critics charging that participating governments exploited it to pursue long-standing policy/military objectives, reduce civil liberties, and infringe upon human rights. It is argued by critics that the term war is not appropriate in this context (as in war on drugs), since there is no identifiable enemy and that it is unlikely international terrorism can be brought to an end by military means.

Other critics, such as Francis Fukuyama, say that &quot;terrorism&quot; is not an enemy but a tactic, and calling it a &quot;war on terror&quot; obscures differences between conflicts such as anti-occupation insurgents and international mujahideen. With a military presence in Iraq and Afghanistan, and its associated collateral damage, Shirley Williams posits that this increases resentment and terrorist threats against the West. Other criticism include United States hypocrisy, media induced hysteria, and that changes in American foreign and security policy have shifted world opinion against the US.

==Terminology==
Various critics dubbed the term &quot;war on terror&quot; as nonsensical. Billionaire activist investor George Soros criticized the term &quot;war on terror&quot; as a &quot;false metaphor.&quot; Linguist George Lakoff of the Rockridge Institute argued that there cannot literally be a on terror, since is an abstract noun. &quot;Terror cannot be destroyed by weapons or signing a peace treaty. A war on terror has no end.&quot;

Jason Burke, a journalist who writes about radical Islamic activity, describes the terms &quot;terrorism&quot; and &quot;war against terrorism&quot; in this manner:

There are multiple ways of defining terrorism and all are subjective. Most define terrorism as &#x27;the use or threat of serious violence&#x27; to advance some kind of &#x27;cause&#x27;. Some state clearly the kinds of group (&#x27;sub-national&#x27;, &#x27;non-state&#x27;) or cause (political, ideological, religious) to which they refer. Others merely rely on the instinct of most people when confronted with an act that involves innocent civilians being killed or maimed by men armed with explosives, firearms or other weapons. None is satisfactory and grave problems with the use of the term persist.

Terrorism is after all, a tactic. The term &#x27;war on terrorism&#x27; is thus effectively nonsensical. As there is no space here to explore this involved and difficult debate, my preference is, on the whole, for the less loaded term &#x27;militancy&#x27;. This is not an attempt to condone such actions, merely to analyze them in a clearer way.

===Perpetual war===
Former U.S. President George W. Bush articulated the goals of the war on terror in a September 20, 2001 speech, in which he said that it &quot;will not end until every terrorist group of global reach has been found, stopped and defeated.&quot; In that same speech, he called the war &quot;a task that does not end&quot;, an argument he reiterated in 2006 State of The Union address.

Excerpts from an April 2006 report compiled from sixteen U.S. government intelligence agencies, however, has strengthened the claim that engaging in Iraq has increased terrorism in the region.

===Preventive war===
One justification given for the invasion of Iraq was to prevent terroristic, or other attacks, by Iraq on the United States or other nations. This can be viewed as a conventional warfare realization of the war on terror.

A major criticism leveled at this justification is that it does not fulfill one of the requirements of a just war and that in waging war preemptively, the United States undermined international law and the authority of the United Nations, particularly the United Nations Security Council. On this ground, by invading a country that did not pose an imminent threat without UN support, the U.S. violated international law, including the UN Charter and the Nuremberg principles, therefore committing a war of aggression, which is considered a war crime. Additional criticism raised the point that the United States might have set a precedent, under the premise of which any nation could justify the invasion of other states.

Richard N. Haass, president of the Council on Foreign Relations, argues that on the eve of U.S. intervention in 2003, Iraq represented, at best, a gathering threat and not an imminent one. In hindsight he notes that Iraq did not even represent a gathering threat. &quot;The decision to attack Iraq in March 2003 was discretionary: it was a war of choice. There was no vital American interests in imminent danger and there were alternatives to using military force, such as strengthening existing sanctions.&quot; However, Haass argues that U.S. intervention in Afghanistan in 2001 began as a war of necessity—vital interests were at stake—but morphed &quot;into something else and it crossed a line in March 2009, when President Barack Obama decided to sharply increase American troop levels and declared that it was U.S. policy to &#x27;take the fight to the Taliban in the south and east&#x27; of the country.&quot; Afghanistan, according to Haass, eventually became a war of choice.

==War on terror seen as pretext==
===Domestic civil liberties===


In the United Kingdom, critics have claimed that the Blair government used the war on terror as a pretext to radically curtail civil liberties. For example, the detention-without-trial in Belmarsh prison: controls on free speech through laws against protests near Parliament and laws banning the &quot;glorification&quot; of terrorism: and reductions in checks on police power, as in the case of Jean Charles de Menezes and Mohammed Abdul Kahar.

Former Liberal Democrat Leader Sir Menzies Campbell has also condemned Blair&#x27;s inaction over the controversial U.S. practice of extraordinary rendition, arguing that the human rights conventions to which the UK is a signatory (e.g. European Convention on Human Rights) impose on the government a &quot;legal obligation&quot; to investigate and prevent potential torture and human rights violations.

Richard Jackson notes how countries like Russia, India, Israel and China also adopted the language of the war on terror to describe their own fight against domestic insurgents and dissidents. He argues that &quot;Linking rebels and dissidents at home to the global &#x27;war on terrorism&#x27; gives these governments both the freedom to crack down on them without fear of international condemnation, and in some cases, direct military assistance from America&quot;.

===Unilateralism===
U.S. President George W. Bush&#x27;s remark of November 2001 claiming that &quot;You&#x27;re either with us or you are with the terrorists,&quot; has been a source of criticism. Thomas A. Keaney of Johns Hopkins University&#x27;s Foreign Policy Institute said &quot;it made diplomacy with a number of different countries far more difficult because obviously there are different problems throughout the world.&quot;

Richard Jackson notes how: &quot;the grammatical construction of this choice is extremely powerful. On the one hand, it obliterates all neutral ground and denies any possibility of withholding judgment or weighing up the evidence [...] On the other hand, it is loaded in such a way that any choice other than fully supporting the United States results in condemnation&quot;.

===As a war against Islam and Muslims===
Since the war on terror revolved primarily around the United States and other NATO states intervening in the internal affairs of Muslim countries (i.e. in Iraq, Afghanistan, etc.) and organisations, it has been labelled a war against Islam by ex-United States Attorney General Ramsey Clark, among others. 
After his release from Guantanamo in 2005, ex-detainee Moazzam Begg appeared in the Islamist propaganda video &quot;21st Century CrUSAders&quot; and claimed the U.S. was engaging in a new crusade:

I think that history is definitely repeating itself and for the Muslim world and I think even a great part of the non-Muslim world now, are beginning to recognize that there are ambitions that the United States has on the lands and wealth of nations of Islam.Professor Khaled A. Beydoun of the University of Arkansas-Fayetteville School of Law states that the War on Terror exports Islamophobia to other countries, which utilize it to persecute and punish their own Muslim populations. Two countries he mentions that facilitate structural Islamophobia as a result of the War on Terror are India and China.

==Methods==
=== Imperialism ===
Professor of Law Antony Anghie criticised the &quot;War on Terror&quot; as a breach of International law and Charter of the United Nations, and condemned it for reviving age-old imperialist notions. Comparing it to the Spanish War against American Indians, Anghie writes: &quot;The War on Terror inaugurated by the Bush administration has profoundly challenged the system of international law and relations created by the United Nations (UN)... Novel situations require novel remedies. My basic argument here is that the Bush doctrine-which consists basically of pre-emption, the identification and then transformation of rogue states-is essentially imperial in character. It is yet another version of the civilizing mission that, I have argued, has animated the international system from its very beginnings.&quot;

===Aiding terrorism===
University of Chicago professor and political scientist, Robert Pape has written extensive work on suicide terrorism and states that it is triggered by military occupations, not extremist ideologies. In works such as &quot;Dying to Win: The Strategic Logic of Suicide Terrorism&quot; and &quot;Cutting the Fuse&quot;, he uses data from an extensive terrorism database and argues that by increasing military occupations, the US government is increasing terrorism. Pape is also the director and founder of the Chicago Project on Security and Terrorism (CPOST), a database of every known suicide terrorist attack from 1980 to 2008.

In 2006, a National Intelligence Estimate stated that the war in Iraq has increased the threat of terrorism. The estimate was compiled by 16 intelligence agencies and was the first assessment of global terrorism since the start of the Iraq war.

Cornelia Beyer explains how terrorism increased as a response to past and present military intervention and occupation, as well as to &#x27;structural violence&#x27;. Structural violence, in this instance, refers to economic conditions of backwardness which are attributed to the economic policies of the Western nations, the United States in particular.

British Liberal Democrat politician Shirley Williams wrote that the United States and United Kingdom governments &quot;must stop to think whether it is sowing the kind of resentment which is the seedbed of future terrorism.&quot; The United Kingdom ambassador to Italy, Ivor Roberts, echoed this criticism when he stated that President Bush was &quot;the best recruiting sergeant ever for al Qaeda.&quot; 
The United States also granted &quot;protected persons&quot; status under the Geneva Convention to the Mojahedin-e-Khalq, an Iranian group classified by the U.S. Department of State as a terrorist organization, sparking criticism. Other critics further noted that the American government granted political asylum to several alleged terrorists and terrorist organizations that seek to overthrow Fidel Castro&#x27;s regime, while the American government claims to be anti-terrorism.

In 2018, &quot;New York Times&quot; terrorism reporter Rukmini Callimachi said &quot;there are more terrorists now than there are on the eve of September 11, not less...There are more terror groups now, not less.&quot;

===Hypocrisy of the Bush administration===
Venezuela accused the U.S. government of having a double standard towards terrorism for giving safe haven to Luis Posada Carriles. Some Americans also commented on the selective use of the term war on terrorism, including 3-star general William Odom, formerly President Reagan&#x27;s NSA Director, who wrote:

As many critics have pointed out, terrorism is not an enemy. It is a tactic. Because the United States itself has a long record of supporting terrorists and using terrorist tactics, the slogans of today&#x27;s war on terrorism merely makes the United States look hypocritical to the rest of the world. A prudent American president would end the present policy of &quot;sustained hysteria&quot; over potential terrorist attacks..treat terrorism as a serious but not a strategic problem, encourage Americans to regain their confidence and refuse to let Al Qaeda keep us in a state of fright.

===False information===
In the months leading up to the invasion of Iraq, President Bush and members of his administration indicated they possessed information which demonstrated a link between Saddam Hussein and al-Qaeda.The consensus among intelligence experts is that these claims were false and that there was never an operational relationship between the two. This is supported by the 9/11 Commission and by declassified United States Department of Defense reports.

===Torture by proxy===

The term &quot;torture by proxy&quot; is used by some critics to describe situations in which the CIA and other US agencies transferred supposed terrorists, whom they captured during their efforts in the &#x27;war on terrorism&#x27;, to countries known to employ torture as an interrogation technique. Some also claimed that US agencies knew torture was employed, even though the transfer of anyone to anywhere for the purpose of torture is a violation of US law. Nonetheless, Condoleezza Rice (then the United States Secretary of State) stated that:the United States has not transported anyone and will not transport anyone, to a country when we believe he will be tortured. Where appropriate, the United States seeks assurances that transferred persons will not be tortured.

This US programme also prompted several official investigations in Europe into alleged secret detentions and unlawful inter-state transfers involving Council of Europe member states, including those related with the war on terror. A June 2006 report from the Council of Europe estimated that 100 people were kidnapped by the CIA on EU territory with the cooperation of Council of Europe members and rendered to other countries, often after having transited through secret detention centres (&quot;black sites&quot;), some located in Europe, utilised by the CIA. According to the separate European Parliament report of February 2007, the CIA has conducted 1,245 flights, many of them to destinations where these alleged &#x27;terrorists&#x27; could face torture, in violation of article 3 of the United Nations Convention Against Torture.

=== Cover-up of war crimes ===
There has also been politically motivated systematic cover-ups of war crimes of American soldiers participating in campaign operations across the world; with the knowledge of their military superiors. In 2002, Reporters Without Borders wrote to Donald Rumsfeld expressing concern when a Washington Post correspondent was prevented at gunpoint by American soldiers from investigating the impact of an American missile fired in Afghanistan.

Further, a public enquiry in UK published in July 2023 reported that 3 British SAS units were involved in the summary executions of at least 80 civilians during 2010–2013, accompanied by a decades-long coverup at the highest echelons of British special forces.

=== Status of combatants ===
A presidential memorandum of 7 February 2002, authorized U.S. interrogators of captured prisoners to deny the prisoners basic protections as required by the Geneva Conventions, and thus according to professor Jordan J. Paust, &quot;necessarily authorized and ordered violations of the Geneva Conventions, which are war crimes.&quot;

U.S. Attorney General Alberto Gonzales and others have argued that detainees should be considered &quot;unlawful combatants&quot; and as such not be protected by the Geneva Conventions.

=== Extrajudicial killings ===

The U.S. practice of conducting targeted killing by combat drone has been a source of controversy over whether extrajudicial killing outside an active battlefield is ethical, whether it is legal under U.S. and international law, how the decision to assassinate a given person or group is made, whether the civilian casualties have been excessive, and whether the practice ends up recruiting more terrorists than it kills.

== Casualties ==
Another criticism of the war on terror has been the number people killed in the various associated conflicts. In a 2023 report, the Costs of War Project estimated that, as the result of the destruction of infrastructure, economies, public services and the environment, there have been between 3.6 and 3.7 million indirect deaths in the post-9/11 war zones, in addition to 906,000–937,000 direct killings with the total death toll being 4.5 to 4.6 million and rising. The report derived its estimate of indirect deaths using a calculation created by the U.N.-backed Geneva Declaration of Secretariat which estimates that in general there are around four indirect deaths due to indirect consequences of war for every direct killing. The report&#x27;s author Stephanie Savell stated that in an ideal scenario, the preferable way of quantifying the total death toll would&#x27;ve been by studying excess mortality, or by using on-the-ground researchers in the affected countries. The report defined post-9/11 war zones as conflicts that included significant United States counter-terrorism operations since 9/11, which includes the Yemeni civil war (2014–present) and Syrian civil war in addition to the conflicts in Iraq, Afghanistan and other countries. Savell said:&quot;There are reverberating costs, the human cost of war, that people for the most part in the United States don’t really know enough about or think about&quot;.

==Religionism and Islamophobia==
One aspect of the criticism regarding the rhetoric justifying the war on terror was religionism, or more specifically Islamophobia. Theologian Lawrence Davidson, who studies contemporary Muslims societies in North America, defines this concept as a stereotyping of all followers of Islam as real or potential terrorists due to alleged hateful and violent teaching of their religion. He goes on to argue that &quot;Islam is reduced to the concept of jihad and Jihad is reduced to terror against the West.&quot;

This line of argument echoes Edward Said’s famous piece &quot;Orientalism&quot; in which he argued that the United States sees the Muslims and Arabs in essentialized caricatures – as oil supplies or potential terrorists. Assistant Professor at Leiden University Tahir Abbas has criticised the war for resulting in the &quot;securitisation of Muslims&quot; and the spread of Islamophobic discourses internationally since 2001. During decades of post 9/11 hysteria, Muslims have been subject to widespread demonization in the Western mass-media, characterised by racist stereotypes and intense securitization. Hollywood movies and TV shows have portrayed simplistic depictions of Arab characters and advanced dualistic notions that have been causing the promulgation of Islamophobic stereotypes in the society.

Another noticeable trend has been the increase of anti-Muslim stereotypes in the Anglo-American media. A study conducted by researchers in the Alabama University which analysed domestic terrorist incidents in United States between 2006 and 2015 concluded that &quot;terrorist attacks&quot; committed by Muslim individuals receive 357% more coverage in American media, than those committed by non-Muslim terrorists. This was the case, notwithstanding the fact that far-right extremists have been responsible for almost twice as many domestic terrorist attacks in the United States between 2008 and 2016. Despite this, administration officials have been lax on cracking down on far-right terrorism, while focusing counter-terror policies mostly to impose surveillance policies against the Muslim community.

==Decreasing support==
In 2002, strong majorities supported the U.S.-led war on terror in Britain, France, Germany, Japan, India and Russia, according to a sample survey conducted by the Pew Research Center. By 2006, supporters of the effort were in the minority in Britain (49%), Germany (47%), France (43%) and Japan (26%). Although a majority of Russians still supported the war on terror, that majority had decreased by 21%. Whereas 63% of Spaniards supported the war on terror in 2003, only 19% of the population indicated support in 2006. 19% of the Chinese population still supports the war on terror and less than a fifth of the populations of Turkey, Egypt, as well as Jordan support the efforts. The report also indicated that Indian public support for the war on terror has been stable.

Marek Obrtel, a former lieutenant colonel and military doctor in the Army of the Czech Republic, publicly returned his medals earned in NATO operations in 2014. In an open letter to Czech Minister of Defense Martin Stropnický, he stated he was &quot;deeply ashamed that I served a criminal organization such as NATO, led by the USA and its perverse interests around the world&quot;, and alleged the U.S. was using conflicts such as the war on terror to further American imperialism and as a pretext to declare war on Russia. In the years after, Obrtel formed a pro-Russian paramilitary group and voiced his disdain for the U.S., NATO, and their interests.

=== Opposition in the United States ===

American pollster Andrew Kohut, while speaking to the U.S. House Committee on Foreign Affairs, noted that and according to the Pew Research Center polls conducted in 2004, &quot;the ongoing conflict in Iraq continues to fuel anti-American sentiments. America&#x27;s global popularity plummeted at the start of military action in Iraq and the U.S. presence there remains widely unpopular.&quot; US wars in Afghanistan and Iraq became heavily unpopular among the American public by the late 2000s.

Numerous US military veterans have handed back their service medals—including the Global War on Terrorism Service Medal—in fierce protest rallies denouncing the wars in Afghanistan and Iraq, with many condemning the military campaigns as imperialist wars of aggression. 

==Role of American media==

Researchers in communication studies and political science found that American understanding of the &quot;war on terror&quot; is directly shaped by how mainstream news media reports events associated with the conflict. In &quot;Bush&#x27;s War: Media Bias and Justifications for War in a Terrorist Age&quot; political communication researcher Jim A. Kuypers illustrated &quot;how the press failed America in its coverage on the war on terror.&quot; In each comparison, Kuypers &quot;detected massive bias on the part of the press.&quot; This researcher called the mainstream news media an &quot;anti-democratic institution&quot; in his conclusion. &quot;What has essentially happened since 9/11 has been that Bush has repeated the same themes and framed those themes the same whenever discussing the war on terror,&quot; said Kuypers. &quot;Immediately following 9/11, the mainstream news media (represented by CBS, ABC, NBC, &quot;USA Today&quot;, &quot;The New York Times&quot;, as well as &quot;The Washington Post&quot;) did echo Bush, but within eight weeks it began to intentionally ignore certain information the president was sharing and instead reframed the president&#x27;s themes or intentionally introduced new material to shift the focus.&quot;

This goes beyond reporting alternate points of view, which is an important function of the press. &quot;In short,&quot; Kuypers explained, &quot;if someone were relying only on the mainstream media for information, they would have no idea what the president actually said. It was as if the press were reporting on a different speech.&quot; The study is essentially a &quot;comparative framing analysis&quot;. Overall, Kuypers examined themes about the September 11 attacks and the war on terror that President Bush used and compared them to themes that the press used when reporting on what he said.

&quot;Framing is a process whereby communicators, consciously or unconsciously, act to construct a point of view that encourages the facts of a given situation to be interpreted by others in a particular manner,&quot; wrote Kuypers. These findings suggest that the public is misinformed about government justification and plans concerning the war on terror.

Others have also suggested that press coverage contributed to a public confused and misinformed on both the nature and level of the threat to the U.S. posed by terrorism. In his book, &quot;Trapped in the War on Terror&quot; political scientist Ian S. Lustick claimed, &quot;The media have given constant attention to possible terrorist-initiated catastrophes and to the failures and weaknesses of the government&#x27;s response.&quot; Lustick alleged that the war on terror is disconnected from the real but remote threat terrorism poses and that the generalized war on terror began as part of the justification for invading Iraq, but then took on a life of its own, fueled by media coverage. Scott Atran writes that &quot;publicity is the oxygen of terrorism&quot; and the rapid growth of international communicative networks renders publicity even more potent, with the result that &quot;perhaps never in the history of human conflict have so few people with so few actual means and capabilities frightened so many.&quot;

Media researcher Stephen D. Cooper&#x27;s analysis of media criticism &quot;Watching the Watchdog: Bloggers As the Fifth Estate&quot; contains several examples of controversies concerning mainstream reporting of the war on terror. Cooper found that bloggers&#x27; criticisms of factual inaccuracies in news stories or bloggers&#x27; discovery of the mainstream press&#x27; failure to adequately verify facts before publication caused many news organizations to retract or change news stories.

Cooper found that bloggers specializing in criticism of media coverage advanced four key points:
*Mainstream reporting of the war on terror has frequently contained factual inaccuracies. In some cases, the errors go uncorrected: moreover, when corrections are issued they usually are given far less prominence than the initial coverage containing the errors.
*The mainstream press has sometimes failed to check the provenance of information or visual images supplied by Iraqi &quot;stringers&quot; (local Iraqis hired to relay local news).
*Story framing is often problematic: in particular, &quot;man-in-the-street&quot; interviews have often been used as a representation of public sentiment in Iraq, in place of methodologically sound survey data.
*Mainstream reporting has tended to concentrate on the more violent areas of Iraq, with little or no reporting of the calm areas.

David Barstow won the 2009 Pulitzer Prize for Investigative Reporting for connecting the Department of Defense to over 75 retired generals supporting the Iraq War on television and radio networks. The Department of Defense recruited retired generals to promote the war to the American public. Barstow also discovered undisclosed links between some retired generals and defense contractors. He reported that &quot;the Bush administration used its control over access of information in an effort to transform the analysts into a kind of media Trojan horse&quot;.

==British objections==
The Director of Public Prosecutions and head of the Crown Prosecution Service in the UK, Ken McDonald, Britain&#x27;s most senior criminal prosecutor, stated that those responsible for acts of terrorism such as the 7 July 2005 London bombings are not &quot;soldiers&quot; in a war, but &quot;inadequates&quot; who should be dealt with by the criminal justice system. He added that a &quot;culture of legislative restraint&quot; was needed in passing anti-terrorism laws and that a &quot;primary purpose&quot; of the violent attacks was to tempt countries such as Britain to &quot;abandon our values.&quot; He stated that in the eyes of the UK criminal justice system, the response to terrorism had to be &quot;proportionate and grounded in due process and the rule of law&quot;:
London is not a battlefield. Those innocents who were murdered ... were not victims of war. And the men who killed them were not, as in their vanity they claimed on their ludicrous videos, &#x27;soldiers&#x27;. They were deluded, narcissistic inadequates. They were criminals. They were fantasists. We need to be very clear about this. On the streets of London there is no such thing as a war on terror. The fight against terrorism on the streets of Britain is not a war. It is the prevention of crime, the enforcement of our laws and the winning of justice for those damaged by their infringement.

Stella Rimington, former head of the British intelligence service MI5 criticised the war on terror as a &quot;huge overreaction&quot; and had decried the militarization and politicization of U.S. efforts to be the wrong approach to terrorism. David Miliband, former UK foreign secretary, has similarly called the strategy a &quot;mistake&quot;. Nigel Lawson, former Chancellor of the Exchequer, called for Britain to end its involvement in the War in Afghanistan, describing the mission as &quot;wholly unsuccessful and indeed counter-productive.&quot;

<text>The following is the 1976–77 network television schedule for the three major English language commercial broadcast networks in the United States. The schedule covers primetime hours from September 1976 through August 1977. The schedule is followed by a list per network of returning series, new series, and series cancelled after the 1975–76 season. All times are Eastern and Pacific, with certain exceptions, such as &quot;Monday Night Football&quot;.

New fall series are highlighted in bold.

Each of the 30 highest-rated shows is listed with its rank and rating as determined by Nielsen Media Research.

: Yellow indicates the programs in the top 10 for the season.
: Cyan indicates the programs in the top 20 for the season.
: Magenta indicates the programs in the top 30 for the season.

PBS, the Public Broadcasting Service, was in operation, but the schedule was set by each local station.

&quot;The Muppet Show&quot; (syndicated in the U.S.) premiered this season.

<doc id="801656" wikidata="Q3525157" url="?curid=801656" title="Widescreen signaling">
<text>In television technology, Wide Screen Signaling (WSS) is digital metadata embedded in invisible part of the analog TV signal describing qualities of the broadcast, in particular the intended aspect ratio of the image. This allows television broadcasters to enable both 4:3 and 16:9 television sets to optimally present pictures transmitted in either format, by displaying them in full screen, letterbox, widescreen, pillar-box, zoomed letterbox, etc.

This development is related to introduction of widescreen TVs and broadcasts, with the PALplus system in the European Union (mid 1990s), the Clear-Vision system in Japan (early 1990s), and the need to downscale HD broadcasts to SD in the US. The bandwidth of the WSS signal is low enough to be recorded on VHS (at the time a popular home video recording technology). It is standardized on Rec. ITU-R BT.1119-2.

A modern digital equivalent would be the Active Format Description, a standard set of codes that can be sent in a MPEG video stream, with a similar set of aspect ratio possibilities.

==625 line systems==
For 625 line analog TV systems (like PAL or SECAM), the signal is placed in line 23. It begins with a run-in code and starts code followed by 14 bits of information, divided into four groups, as shown on the tables below (based on Rec. ITU-R BT.1119-2) :


==525 line systems==
525 line analog systems (like NTSC or PAL-M) made a provision for the use of pulses for signaling widescreen and other parameters, introduced with the development of Clear-Vision (EDTV-II), a NTSC-compatible Japanese system allowing widescreen broadcasts. On these systems the signals are present in lines 22 and 285, as 27 data bits, as defined by IEC 61880.

The following table shows the information present on the signal, based on Rec. ITU-R BT.1119-2 (&quot;helper&quot; signals are EDTV-II specific):

<doc id="801662" wikidata="Q1142922" url="?curid=801662" title="Process control block">
<text>A process control block (PCB), also sometimes called a process descriptor, is a data structure used by a computer operating system to store all the information about a process.

When a process is created (initialized or installed), the operating system creates a corresponding process control block, which specifies and tracks the process state (i.e. new, ready, running, waiting or terminated). Since it is used to track process information, the PCB plays a key role in context switching.

An operating system kernel stores PCBs in a process table.

The current working directory of a process is one of the properties that the kernel stores in the process&#x27;s PCB.

==Role==
The role of the PCBs is central in process management: they are accessed and/or modified by most utilities, particularly those involved with scheduling and resource management.

==Structure==
In multitasking operating systems, the PCB stores data needed for correct and efficient process management. Though the details of these structures are system-dependent, common elements fall in three main categories:
* Process identification 
* Process state 
* Process control 

Status tables exist for each relevant entity, like describing memory, I/O devices, files and processes.

Memory tables, for example, contain information about the allocation of main and secondary (virtual) memory for each process, authorization attributes for accessing memory areas shared among different processes, etc. I/O tables may have entries stating the availability of a device or its assignment to a process, the status of I/O operations, the location of memory buffers used for them, etc.

&quot;Process identification data&quot; include a unique identifier for the process (almost invariably an integer) and, in a multiuser-multitasking system, data such as the identifier of the parent process, user identifier, user group identifier, etc. The process id is particularly relevant since it is often used to cross-reference the tables defined above, e.g. showing which process is using which I/O devices, or memory areas.

&quot;Process state data&quot; define the status of a process when it is suspended, allowing the OS to restart it later. This always includes the content of general-purpose CPU registers, the CPU process status word, stack and frame pointers, etc. During context switch, the running process is stopped and another process runs. The kernel must stop the execution of the running process, copy out the values in hardware registers to its PCB, and update the hardware registers with the values from the PCB of the new process.

&quot;Process control information&quot; is used by the OS to manage the process itself. This includes:

* Process scheduling state – The state of the process in terms of &quot;ready&quot;, &quot;suspended&quot;, etc., and other scheduling information as well, such as priority value, the amount of time elapsed since the process gained control of the CPU or since it was suspended. Also, in case of a suspended process, event identification data must be recorded for the event the process is waiting for;
* Process structuring information – the process&#x27;s children id&#x27;s, or the id&#x27;s of other processes related to the current one in some functional way, which may be represented as a queue, a ring or other data structures;
* Interprocess communication information – flags, signals and messages associated with the communication among independent processes;
* Process Privileges – allowed/disallowed access to system resources;
* Process State – new, ready, running, waiting, dead;
* Process Number (PID) – unique identification number for each process (also known as Process ID);
* Program Counter (PC) – a pointer to the address of the next instruction to be executed for this process;
* CPU Registers – register set where process needs to be stored for execution for running state;
* CPU Scheduling Information – information scheduling CPU time;
* Memory Management Information – page table, memory limits, segment table;
* Accounting Information – amount of CPU used for process execution, time limits, execution ID etc.;
* I/O Status Information – list of I/O devices allocated to the process.

==Location==
PCB must be kept in an area of memory protected from normal process access. In some operating systems the PCB is placed at the bottom of the process stack.

* Process Environment Block (PEB)
* Program segment prefix (PSP)
* Data segment

<text>Sonic Underground (French: &quot;Sonic le Rebelle&quot;) is an animated musical television series co-produced by DIC Productions, L.P., Les Studios Tex S.A.R.L. and TF1. It is the third &quot;Sonic the Hedgehog&quot; animated series, and the last to be produced by DIC. It follows a main plot separate from all other &quot;Sonic the Hedgehog&quot; media, where Sonic has two siblings, Sonia and Manic, that are collectively part of a royal family who were forced to separate from their mother, Queen Aleena, upon Doctor Robotnik&#x27;s takeover of Mobius due to a prophecy told by the Oracle of Delphius. Along the way, they encounter other resistance groups against Robotnik and powerful artifacts that could wreak havoc on the world, all the while searching for their long-lost mother, Queen Aleena.

The series first aired in France from January to May 1999 on TF1, and then premiered in the United Kingdom in May 1999 on ITV on the GMTV strand and finally in the United States in the syndicated children&#x27;s block BKN Kids II from August to October 1999. It also aired on the Sci-Fi Channel on weekday mornings starting October 1999, lasting until October 2000. The show ran only for one season, consisting of forty episodes.

==Plot==
The show takes place in a separate canon and continuity than any other &quot;Sonic the Hedgehog&quot; media. Queen Aleena, the ruler of Mobius, is overthrown by Dr. Robotnik, who seizes control of the planet with his army of Swat-bots and forces Queen Aleena into hiding. To preserve the dynasty, Queen Aleena separates her three children: Sonic, Manic, and Sonia after the Oracle of Delphius tells her of a prophecy proclaiming she would one day reunite with her children to form the &quot;Council of Four&quot; and overthrow Robotnik. Meanwhile, Dr. Robotnik establishes an autocratic government by appointing bounty hunters Sleet and Dingo to do his dirty work, legally turning anyone who stands against him into robots devoid of free will, and forcing the nobles into paying large amounts of money to him as tribute.

When Sonic, Manic, and Sonia grow up, the Oracle of Delphius reveals the prophecy to them. After that, Sonic, Manic, and Sonia go on a quest searching for Queen Aleena throughout Mobius. Dr. Robotnik, with the assistance from Sleet, Dingo and the Swat-bots, tries constantly to capture the royal hedgehogs and prevent the prophecy from being fulfilled.

The Oracle of Delphius assigns the three siblings powerful medallions that can change into musical instruments, and can also be used as weapons: Sonic&#x27;s medallion is an electric guitar; Sonia&#x27;s medallion is a keyboard that functions as a smoke machine; and Manic&#x27;s medallion is a drumset that can be used as an &quot;earth controller&quot; with cymbals that can deflect laserfire. All of the medallions can be used as laser guns. The three use the medallions not only to fight Robotnik&#x27;s forces but also as instruments for their underground rock band, &quot;Sonic Underground.&quot;

==Characters==
===Main===


* Sonic (speaking voice by Jaleel White and singing voice provided by Sam Vincent) is the eldest sibling and lead singer of many songs performed by the Sonic Underground. His medallion turns into a guitar, which can fire laser blasts. As fast as the speed of sound, Sonic can easily outrun danger. He is a big fan of chili dogs, causing him to be a bit overweight. He also is terrified of water as he cannot swim. Sonic wears anti-gravity sneakers that allow him to hover over the ground while running.
* Sonia (speaking voice by Jaleel White and singing voice provided by Stevie Vallance) is the only female hedgehog member of the Sonic Underground and the sister of Sonic and Manic. Unlike her brothers, she was raised by an aristocratic foster family, giving her an upper class mentality. She hates getting dirty, is skilled at gymnastics and karate, and possesses superhuman strength, a photographic memory, and the ability to spin in a cyclonic manner. Her medallion turns into a keyboard, which can fire laser blasts from one end, or create a pink mist when the keys are played. Sonia has a pink motorcycle which can travel as fast as Sonic&#x27;s running and Manic&#x27;s hover board. She also is the one that does research on Robotnik&#x27;s plans and provides the technological innovation for the Sonic Underground. Of the siblings, Sonia is the only one to be seen involved in any romance, displaying feelings for her childhood friend Bartleby, despite his snobbishness, as well as other men encountered in her travels. Among these is Knuckles, whom she develops an attraction to during the series&#x27; Flying Fortress saga.
* Manic (speaking voice by Jaleel White and singing voice provided by Tyley Ross) is the youngest sibling. He is a calculating and sarcastic hedgehog that was raised by thieves, and is a master of their trade. When Manic met his siblings, they disapproved of his thieving tendencies, but his skills as a lock-pick were greatly appreciated. Manic possesses neither Sonic&#x27;s speed nor Sonia&#x27;s spin-attack, thus making him the only member of the Sonic Underground who relies on entirely on his medallion for superpowers of his own. Despite his lack of superpowers, his thieving skills proves himself extremely useful to the group from time to time. Manic is the drummer of the Sonic Underground. His medallion turns into drums, which can cause earthquakes; the Oracle of Delphius claims that his drums are the most powerful instruments of the three. He also has a hover board that is as fast as Sonic&#x27;s running and Sonia&#x27;s motorcycle. His medallion&#x27;s string is blue.
* Dr. Robotnik (voiced by Garry Chalk) is the evil human dictator of Mobius, renamed Robotropolis under his rule, having conquered it with his army of Swatbots. He captures and roboticizes anyone who opposes him, transforming them into robotic servants.
** Sleet (voiced by Maurice LaMarche) is a wolf and one of Robotnik&#x27;s canine bounty hunters. This cunning wolf leads the bumbling Dingo about on missions to capture the hedgehogs. Sleet has a morphing device that can transform Dingo into anything he wishes. He is constantly being crushed by Dingo and is usually the one who suffers the most from their combined failures.
** Dingo (voiced by Peter Wilds) is a dingo who is one of Robotnik&#x27;s canine bounty hunters and Sleet&#x27;s partner. Dingo is a huge, muscle-bound blonde dingo and is also very ignorant. He is partially roboticized in his hands and his left leg from the knee down, which is never explained. He has a relentless crush on Sonia, but remains fiercely loyal to Sleet.
** Swatbots (voiced by Maurice LaMarche) are the robotic foot soldiers of Dr. Robotnik.

===Recurring===
* Queen Aleena Hedgehog (voiced by Gail Webster) is the mother of the Sonic Underground group and former ruler of Mobius before Robotnik&#x27;s takeover. She had to give them up in order for the prophecy to become true. She spends the series on the run from her own children, until the time is right to reveal herself. Her character has many allies, including the Oracle of Delphius and Knuckles. She also does a bit of narrating in the start of every episode.
* Knuckles (voiced by Brian Drummond) is a red echidna who is the guardian of one of the Chaos Emeralds and Angel Island, and an acquaintance of Queen Aleena&#x27;s. He is very protective of his island home, and has set many traps about the island. He has a pet dinosaur called Chomps, and like his game incarnation is shown to be somewhat gullible. His great-grandfather Athair warns him that he must stay on the island in order to play his part in the freedom of Mobius. He turned against the Hedgehogs twice - first being tricked into thinking they were thieves and later thinking that it was the only way to save their planet - but came around and worked with them against the threat of Robotnik and his henchmen. During the Flying Fortress arc, he showed signs of a growing affection for Sonia, including a particular guilt over the prospect of betraying her.
* The Freedom Fighters are allies of Sonic, Sonia, and Manic. They assist in fighting the forces of Dr. Robotnik.
** Oracle of Delphius (voiced by Maurice LaMarche) is an odd, wart-covered in a cloak that resembles a scaly anteater/crocodile hybrid. The Oracle prophesied that when Robotnik invaded Mobius, Aleena and her children would form the Council of Four to overthrow Robotnik and free Mobius. The Oracle lives in a cave somewhere in a cold region of Mobius, and is quite good at making chili dogs. He is named after the Oracle at Delphi.
** Sir Bartleby Montclair (voiced by Peter Wilds) is a posh, cowardly upper-class English-accented mink who is one of Robotropolis&#x27; richest aristocrats. Bartleby was Sonia&#x27;s fiancé. He dislikes Dr. Robotnik and is often forced to fund Robotnik&#x27;s schemes – although in secret he still supports Queen Aleena.
** Cyrus (voiced by Ian James Corlett) is a lion and a technician for the Freedom Fighters. He is an old friend of Sonic. In his first appearance he was working as a spy for Robotnik, but quit upon discovering that the Freedom Fighters&#x27; Sanctuary was a hideout for their children. Cyrus&#x27;s father was roboticized.
** Trevor (voiced by Matt Hill) is a mouse who is a friend of the royal siblings and Cyrus. He dresses like a hippie. Trevor is an ace pilot and helps build and fix mechanical equipment.
** Renée is a fox and computer expert who leads a branch of the Freedom Fighters in the resort town of Anays.
* Athair (voiced by Maurice LaMarche impersonating Sean Connery) is the great-grandfather of Knuckles. While he advises Knuckles not to leave Angel Island, he does provide advice to his great-grandson.

==History==
===Development===

It is often claimed that the newly Sega of America CEO Shoichiro Irimajiri contacted DIC CEO Andy Heyward to make a new Sonic cartoon, which would help gain interest in buying their new console, the Dreamcast. &quot;Sonic Underground&quot; started production in early 1997, around the same time the development of both the Dreamcast and &quot;Sonic Adventure&quot; had started. The show bible was written as early as March 1997. The show was publicly announced as early as December 1997.

When the show was in development, two episodes per week were produced, and the writers felt that they were not given enough time to &quot;tie everything together&quot; in the plot, being limited to a three-part &quot;Origins&quot; saga for coherency. DIC used cattle calls to generate episode plots. Periodically, about twenty unaffiliated writers were brought into the studios to learn about the established characters and brainstorm possible plots for episodes, after which about one or two would be selected. According to Mike Piccirillo, when he was writing songs for the show, there were no storyboards done yet, so he could only work off of the scripts, which often said what moral or lesson the song should be about in each episode. The show&#x27;s animation was outsourced to the Taiwanese animation studio Hong Ying Animation with the storyboards and main title animation done in Madrid, Spain by Milimetros, S.A. (also responsible for the animation in the Saturday morning Sonic the Hedgehog cartoon and some of the storyboards in &quot;Adventures of Sonic the Hedgehog&quot;), pre-production services provided by Le Studio Ellipse, layout services by Arles Animation and video and audio post-production services by Les Studios de Saint-Ouen. According to Robby London, Sega of Japan had an active role in the approval process for &quot;Sonic Underground&quot;, going so far as to force DiC to reanimate the characters with five fingers instead of the usual four due to the Japanese association of four fingers with the yakuza.

While it was once believed that 65 episodes were made of which only 40 aired, Ben Hurst, a main writer from &quot;Sonic the Hedgehog&quot; (dubbed &quot;SatAM&quot; by fans), who was also involved in &quot;Sonic Underground&quot;&#x27;s production, stated in a chat at the Sonic Amateur Games Expo 2008 that only 40 were planned to be produced from the beginning.

===Airing and broadcast===
====France====
&quot;Sonic Underground&quot; first premiered in France on 6 January 1999 and aired on TF1 on the &quot;TF! Jeunesse&quot; block on Wednesdays and Sundays.

====United Kingdom====
The show made its English premiere in the United Kingdom on 2 May 1999, airing on ITV&#x27;s GMTV strand, on the Disney-produced block Diggit, which was programmed by the show&#x27;s distributor Buena Vista International Television and had also aired other programmes produced by DIC Entertainment at the time. ITV aired the first 18 episodes of the series on Sunday mornings before the series was removed from the Diggit schedule.

In 2005, DIC pre-sold the series to GMTV, and so the series reran on ITV2 in 2005 as part of the GMTV2 Kids strand.

By 2006, alongside the other Sonic cartoons, the series began to air on Pop, and by 2012, was airing on its sister channel Kix!

====North America====
In January 1999, it was announced that Bohbot Entertainment had acquired the North American broadcast rights to the series to air on their BKN syndicated strand. The series premiered in the country on 30 August 1999, on the company&#x27;s then-new BKN Kids II on weekday mornings at 6:00 AM Central Time., and ran until 22 October 1999.

The series also aired on the Sci-Fi Channel which BKN also had a broadcast deal with at the time, however, the episodes that were supposed to air on Fridays were skipped because &quot;Double Dragon&quot; and later &quot;King Arthur and the Knights of Justice&quot; were airing instead, therefore only 32 of the 40 &quot;Sonic Underground&quot; episodes aired on that channel.

In 2004, the show returned to syndicated television stations on weekends as part of the DIC Kids Network E/I strand. It, alongside fellow DIC series &quot;Mummies Alive!&quot; were the only two programs on the strand to not fulfill E/I requirements.

On 19 January 2006, CBS announced a multi-year deal with DIC to broadcast some of their shows on the &quot;CBS&#x27;s Secret Saturday Morning Slumber Party&quot; segment, including &quot;Sonic Underground&quot;, however, the block would not end up running the show in the end.

In 2009, reruns of &quot;Sonic Underground&quot; aired on Firestone Communications&#x27; Sorpresa, a Hispanic children&#x27;s station (Channel 850 on Time Warner Cable) in the United States, broadcasting the audio-dubbed Latin Spanish dub.

Re-runs of the series aired on Disney XD starting 11 June 2012 and ending on 14 December 2012. This marked the second time a &quot;Sonic the Hedgehog&quot; cartoon has aired on a Disney-themed channel, with the first being &quot;Adventures of Sonic the Hedgehog&quot; on Toon Disney (the predecessor of Disney XD) from 1998 to 2002.

The series aired in Canada on Teletoon.

====Other regions====
In Australia, &quot;Sonic Underground&quot; premiered on The Seven Network during &quot;The Big Breakfast&quot; in 1999.

The show was broadcast by KidsCo in regions the channel broadcast from.

In Poland the show aired on TV Puls 2 as a part of the &quot;Junior TV&quot; block.

==Home media==
===United States===
In the United States, Sterling Entertainment released a VHS/DVD titled &quot;Dr. Robotnik&#x27;s Revenge&quot; in July 2003, containing three episodes, and a bonus &quot;Super Mario Bros.&quot; episode on the DVD release. It was re-released by NCircle Entertainment in March 2007 without the bonus Mario episode. The Sterling versions of the &quot;Adventures of Super Mario Bros. 3&quot; &quot;King Koopa Katastrophe&quot; and &quot;The Legend of Zelda&quot; &quot;Ganon&#x27;s Evil Tower&quot; DVDs also included 1 and 2 episodes respectively as DVD bonuses which the NCircle reissues of both releases excluded. Sterling Entertainment&#x27;s VHS/DVD release of &quot;Sonic Christmas Blast&quot; also included 3 episodes (2 on the VHS).

Shout! Factory and Vivendi Entertainment have released the complete series on DVD in Region 1 (NTSC) in two volume sets. Volume 1, simply entitled &quot;Sonic Underground&quot;, was released on 18 December 2007. It contains the first 20 episodes of the show on three discs, with disc three also including interviews with DIC&#x27;s Robby London, Mike Piccirillo, an opening title animatic, and concept art. A bonus fourth disc is an audio CD containing eight songs from the series, including the opening theme. &quot;Sonic Underground: Volume 2&quot; was released on 17 June 2008, featuring the remaining 20 episodes and another bonus audio CD featuring eight more songs from the series.

From 2007 until 2010, NCircle Entertainment released several single-release DVDs containing four episodes each:
NCircle also re-released Volumes 1 and 2 in 2013 and 2017, respectively. On 25 July 2023, they released the complete series as a four disc set.

===United Kingdom===
In 2004, Anchor Bay UK obtained rights to distribute several DIC cartoons, including &quot;Sonic Underground&quot; on home video. The first two volumes were released on 31 May 2004 while the next two were released on 16 August 2004. There were plans for the remaining six volumes to be released separately, but they were instead released in a 10-DVD boxset in October 2004.

In July 2005, Avenue Entertainment released two budget DVDs containing two episodes each.

Delta Home Entertainment released the complete series again on DVD in June 2008 as a 4-disc set, with the fifth DVD containing the bonus features from the Shout! Factory DVD boxset. Delta Home Entertainment also released the four discs separately, with Disc 1 and 2 being released as &quot;Beginnings&quot; and &quot;Who Do You Think You Are&quot; in August 2008, and Discs 3 and 4 being released as &quot;When in Rome&quot; and &quot;Country Crisis&quot; in September 2008.

==Reception==
&quot;Sonic Underground&quot; received mixed reviews: it was criticized for its complex plot and large amount of differences from the games, although some critics have defined the music as catchy. David Cornelius of DVD Talk said, &quot;While many Sonic fans did not take too well to all the changes, preferring the original &#x27;Sonic&#x27; cartoon to this stranger, sometimes darker, sometimes sillier incarnation, the series did win a small but loyal cult following. I fall more on the side of disappointment - for all the cleverness that went into crafting an all-new backstory, the episodes themselves are uninspired - but acknowledge the simple fact that it scores well with its target audience.&quot; GamesRadar called the show as one of &quot;the absolute worst Sonic moments&quot;, criticizing the extra characters and the complex plot. Patrick Lee of &quot;The A.V. Club&quot; panned the series, calling it one of the most artistic failures to ever end up on television and &quot;the result of several unrelated ideas forcibly squashed into one project&quot;. Comedian Chris Hardwick commented on the show&#x27;s theme song, composed by Mike Piccirillo, claiming that &quot;that guy sounds like he&#x27;s trying to win his exwife back.&quot; Susan Arendt of Wired said &quot;The songs are actually kind of catchy in a Saturday morning cartoon kind of way, but the band thing still seems a bit out of place, especially when the instruments turn into weapons.&quot; Emily Ashby of Common Sense Media said &quot;&quot;Sonic Underground&quot; has some good things to offer kids, but only if they&#x27;re ready for the complexities of its story&quot; criticizing its complex plot but complimenting its low violence and ability to entertain children.

==Other media==
The &quot;Sonic the Hedgehog&quot; comic from Archie Comics featured a story in one of its special issues in which the &quot;Sonic Underground&quot; continuity was featured. According to the comics&#x27; plot, the reality in which &quot;Sonic Underground&quot; takes place is one of many parallel universes that share elements with Sonic&#x27;s own. In the story, Sonic Prime—hailing from the main universe in the comic series—joins forces with his counterpart and siblings to stop Dr. Robotnik, who has managed to assemble a monstrous battle machine known as the Giant Borg. Robotnik obtained the pieces for this machine due to being mistaken for one of his own counterparts by Evil Sonic, an evil counterpart of Sonic&#x27;s who later came to be known as Scourge the Hedgehog.

The &quot;Sonic Universe&quot; spin-off comic was originally scheduled to feature an epilogue to the unfinished &quot;Sonic Underground&quot; for its 50th issue. However, for unknown reasons this was replaced with a story focusing on one of Sonic&#x27;s long-running enemies, Metal Sonic. The Underground Epilogue was put on hold indefinitely, due to Sega not permitting the show be featured in the comics.

<text>One Day at a Time is an American television sitcom that aired on CBS from December 16, 1975, to May 28, 1984. It stars Bonnie Franklin as a divorced mother raising two teenage daughters, played by Mackenzie Phillips and Valerie Bertinelli, set in Indianapolis.

==Background==
The series was created by Whitney Blake and Allan Manings, a husband-and-wife writing duo who had both been actors in the 1950s and 1960s. The series was based on Whitney Blake&#x27;s own life as a single mother raising her three children (including future actress Meredith Baxter) after her divorce from her first husband.

==Overview==
Divorced mother Ann Romano (Bonnie Franklin) moves herself and her teenage daughters, rebellious Julie (Mackenzie Phillips) and wisecracking Barbara (Valerie Bertinelli), from their home in Logansport, Indiana, to Indianapolis. Ann frequently struggles with maintaining her role as mother while affording her daughters the freedom she never had as a young woman. Dwayne Schneider (Pat Harrington Jr.), the building superintendent, provides usually unwanted advice to the tenants, especially Ann.

Ann dates her divorce lawyer, David Kane, and they become engaged, but on their wedding day David says he wants kids; Ann does not, so they call off the wedding.

After David takes a job in Los Angeles, the show focuses on Ann&#x27;s dilemmas as a single mother and career woman and the girls&#x27; growing pains, with Schneider becoming a more welcome part of the family. Ann&#x27;s strained relationship with her ex-husband Ed slowly improves, as does the girls&#x27; relationship with his new wife Vickie. Julie and Barbara graduate from high school and head into the working world. Julie eventually marries flight attendant Max Horvath (Michael Lembeck).

Alex (Glenn Scarpelli), the orphaned son of Ann&#x27;s deceased boyfriend Nick (Ron Rifkin), moves in, changing the dynamics in the female-dominated apartment. Ann starts her own advertising business with her once-workplace-rival Francene Webster (Shelley Fabares). Later in the series&#x27; run, Julie gives birth to daughter &quot;Little Annie&quot; Horvath (Lauren and Paige Maloney), Barbara marries dental student Mark Royer (Boyd Gaines), and Ann&#x27;s mother Katherine (Nanette Fabray) moves nearby. Ann later marries Mark Royer&#x27;s father, Sam (Howard Hesseman).

In the penultimate episode, Ann decides to take a job in London, leaving her daughters in Indianapolis raising their own families. In the series finale, Schneider leaves town, moving to Florida to take care of his niece and nephew.

==Production==
There were two pilots for the series. The first was filmed in 1975 under the series original working title &quot;Three to Get Ready&quot;. Two major differences are that Ann worked as a nurse and had only one daughter in the first pilot. After a major re-working the second filmed pilot became the one that launched the show.

For its entire run, the series was taped in Hollywood before a studio audience. Originally, it was taped at CBS Television City. Shortly after its premiere, the series began taping at Metromedia Square, where it remained until 1982. From 1982 to 1984, the series was taped at Universal Studios.

Like many sitcoms developed by Norman Lear, &quot;One Day at a Time&quot; often tackled serious issues in life and relationships, particularly those related to second-wave feminism, and can be considered an example of the &quot;dramedy&quot; (hybrid comedy/drama) genre. In an ironic twist, during the 1979–1980 season, Mackenzie Phillips was dealing with drug addiction and entered rehab in 1980, reflecting the Alcoholics Anonymous central sobriety saying, &quot;One Day at a Time.&quot; Stories depicting such events as weddings, births, and other important milestones frequently stretched over two-, three-, and four-part episodes.

===Theme song and opening credits===
The theme song for &quot;One Day at a Time&quot;, &quot;This Is It&quot;, was composed by Brill Building songwriter Jeff Barry and his wife Nancy Barry, and performed by recording artist Polly Cutter. The opening credits were originally seen over a filmed sequence showing Ann, Julie, and Barbara excitedly moving into their new home. Later, the opening credits sequence mostly consisted of clips of each cast member taken from previous episodes.

===Casting===
Actors Bonnie Franklin, Pat Harrington Jr., and Valerie Bertinelli were the only cast members to remain with the series throughout its entire run. Lead actress Mackenzie Phillips was fired after the fifth season due to growing problems with substance abuse. She later returned in a frequent recurring role, but was let go again shortly after the start of the final season. Original cast member Richard Masur was written out early in the second season, but returned as a guest star in the sixth-season finale.

Richard Masur played attorney David Kane, a love interest for the newly divorced Ann Romano, in the first season and left after the fourth episode of the second season. In a 2016 interview with The A.V. Club, he explained that David was constantly proposing marriage to Ann and she refused him every time. The actor became even further frustrated when Lear insisted that David and Ann&#x27;s romance be unconsummated. His role was relegated to being a confidante to Julie and Barbara and an adversary to Schneider. After several disagreements with the direction Masur&#x27;s character took, Lear agreed to write off David from the show but not entirely, per his appearance in the finale.

After Masur&#x27;s departure, the producers replaced the romantic interest with a comedic foil. That role was filled by actress and comedienne Mary Louise Wilson, playing as Ginny Wroblicki, a cocktail waitress who becomes Ann&#x27;s neighbor, best friend, and confidante. It was an unhappy casting change all around, as the show’s ratings began to decline soon after Wilson&#x27;s arrival, the character of Ginny Wroblicki proved to be unpopular with viewers, and Wilson herself did not like the role or get along with Franklin.

Wilson wrote that &quot;aside from Lear, nobody thought I was funny...To make matters worse, each character, according to the show&#x27;s formula, had to have a &#x27;serious&#x27; moral dilemma at some point, and I was given some problem about an illegitimate child to work out in these increasingly sentimental scenes that made my bowels shrink.&quot; At the end of the second season of &quot;One Day at a Time&quot;, Wilson was released from the show at her own request after appearing in 14 episodes. The character of Ginny Wroblicki was never seen, referred to, or heard from again except in a fifth-season retrospective clip episode.

For the next two seasons, the central cast of Ann, Julie, Barbara, and Schneider was supplemented by recurring characters, including William Kirby Cullen as Julie&#x27;s boyfriend Chuck Butterfield, Howard Morton and K Callan as Chuck&#x27;s parents, John Putch as Barbara&#x27;s awkward friend Bob Morton, Scott Colomby as Barbara&#x27;s boyfriend Cliff Randall, and John Hillerman and Charles Siebert as Ann&#x27;s bosses, Mr. Connors and Mr. Davenport, respectively. Dick O&#x27;Neill and Nedra Volz made three appearances together as Orville and Emily, residents of the retirement home where the main characters put on a semiregular variety show. Joseph Campanella also made several appearances as Ann&#x27;s ex-husband and the girls&#x27; father, Ed Cooper.

Michael Lembeck joined the series as Julie&#x27;s husband, Max, in the fifth season, but he was written out as a consequence of Phillips&#x27; firing, but later returned in season seven along with Philips. A steady stream of regulars was added in the ensuing seasons, including Ron Rifkin as Ann&#x27;s boyfriend, Nick; Glenn Scarpelli as Nick&#x27;s son, Alex; and Boyd Gaines as Barbara&#x27;s boyfriend, later husband, Mark. The character of Nick lasted only one season, being killed off in a car crash, but Nick&#x27;s son Alex stayed with the family for the following two years.

Shelley Fabares, who had previously guest-starred as Ann&#x27;s rival co-worker Francine Webster, appeared more frequently, eventually becoming a regular. Nanette Fabray, who played Ann&#x27;s mother, also made more frequent appearances before becoming a regular cast member in the final season. Howard Hesseman joined the series for a short time as Mark&#x27;s father, Sam, who would become Ann&#x27;s second husband.

The character of Julie was written out again in the ninth season, as Mackenzie Phillips&#x27; erratic behavior and drug-related issues recurred. She was dropped from the opening credits and not present after the fourth episode of season 9, although for a time she was still referred to as an off-screen character, while Michael Lembeck was still seen regularly as Julie&#x27;s husband, Max. Their daughter Annie was also seen. A few episodes later, Julie—still unseen—left Max, writing him a &quot;Dear John&quot; letter. The character of Max stuck with the show, but Julie was not seen again.

Notable guest stars throughout the series run include Norman Alden, Robby Benson, Carla Borelli, Charlie Brill, Dennis Burkley, Jack Dodson, Elinor Donahue, Gwyda Donhowe, David Dukes, Greg Evigan, Conchata Ferrell, Corey Feldman, Alice Ghostley, Lee Grant, Mark Hamill, Jim Hutton, Van Johnson, Terry Kiser, Richard Kline, Christopher Knight, Jay Leno, Robert Mandan, Robert Morse, Denise Nicholas, J. Pat O&#x27;Malley, Jo Ann Pflug, Eve Plumb, Susan Richardson, William Schallert, Gretchen Corbett, Suzanne Somers, Ellen Travolta, Dick Van Patten, and Keenan Wynn.

==Reception==
===Ratings===
&quot;One Day at a Time&quot; was best known in the early 1980s as a staple of the CBS Sunday-night lineup, one of the most successful in TV history, along with &quot;Archie Bunker&#x27;s Place&quot;, &quot;Alice&quot;, and &quot;The Jeffersons.&quot;

The series consistently ranked among the top twenty, if not the top ten, programs in the ratings. However, the network moved the show around on the prime time schedule eleven times. By the end of the 1982–83 season, viewership was beginning to slip and the series ended season eight ranking at No. 16. At this time, Bonnie Franklin and Valerie Bertinelli were anxious to move on, but agreed to do a ninth and final season.

===Awards and honors===
* 1981, 1982: Golden Globe Award for Best Supporting Actress – Series, Miniseries or Television Film to Valerie Bertinelli 
* 1982: Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Directing in a Comedy Series to Alan Rafkin 
* 1984: Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Supporting Actor – Comedy Series to Pat Harrington

==Syndication==
CBS aired daytime reruns of the show for three years. From September 17, 1979, to February 1, 1980, it aired on the daytime schedule at 3:30 pm Eastern time; with the cancellation of &quot;Love of Life&quot; to accommodate the expansion of &quot;The Young and the Restless&quot; to one hour, it was moved on February 4, 1980, to 4 pm Eastern due to &quot;Guiding Light&quot; moving to 3 pm. On September 28, 1981, it moved to 10 am Eastern time, and on September 20, 1982, it was replaced by &quot;The $25,000 Pyramid&quot;.

==Cast reunions==
&quot;The One Day at a Time Reunion&quot; was a 60-minute CBS retrospective special which aired on Tuesday February 22, 2005, at 9:00 pm ET, reuniting Bonnie Franklin, Mackenzie Phillips, Valerie Bertinelli, and Pat Harrington to reminisce about the series and their characters. Regular cast members Richard Masur, Shelley Fabares, Nanette Fabray, Michael Lembeck and Glenn Scarpelli shared their feelings about their time on the show in separate interviews. The special was included as a bonus on &quot;One Day at a Time: The Complete First Season&quot; DVD set.

On February 26, 2008, Franklin, Phillips, Bertinelli, and Harrington reunited once again to talk about life on the set, Phillips&#x27; drug problems, and the show&#x27;s theme song on NBC&#x27;s &quot;Today Show&quot; as part of a week-long segment titled &quot;Together Again: TV&#x27;s Greatest Casts Reunited&quot;.

Bertinelli, Harrington, and (on tape) Franklin appeared on the September 10, 2008, episode of &quot;Rachael Ray&quot; to celebrate Ray&#x27;s 40th birthday.

In 2011, Franklin reunited again with Bertinelli on an episode of &quot;Hot in Cleveland&quot; which marked one of Franklin&#x27;s last acting roles before her death in 2013. Mackenzie Phillips and Pat Harrington Jr. also made individual cameos on the series.

&quot;One Day at a Time&quot; was awarded the Innovation Award on the 2012 TV Land Award show on April 29. Accepting the award were Valerie Bertinelli, Bonnie Franklin, Pat Harrington Jr., Richard Masur, Mackenzie Phillips, and Glenn Scarpelli.

In July 2020, Bertinelli, Phillips, Lembeck and Scarpelli reunited on the Stars in the House video podcast, along with producers Norman Lear and Patricia Fass Palmer.

==Home media==
In April 2007, Sony Pictures Home Entertainment released the first season of &quot;One Day at a Time&quot; on DVD in Region 1.

In September 2017, it was announced that Shout! Factory had acquired the rights to the series and released &quot;One Day at a Time - The Complete Series on DVD&quot; in Region 1 in December 2017. Season 2 was released in March 2018. Season 3 was released in June 2018.

==Remake==

Gloria Calderon Kellett and Mike Royce developed a new version of the series, with a Latino cast, for Netflix, beginning in 2017. Norman Lear also returned for the remake as executive producer. The ensemble is led by Justina Machado, with Rita Moreno, Stephen Tobolowsky, Isabella Gomez, Marcel Ruiz, and Todd Grinnell in supporting roles. Pam Fryman directed the pilot episode.

Several members of the original cast and production crew returned in various capacities throughout the series run. Patricia Fass Palmer returned as a producer for the remake; Mackenzie Philips had a recurring role as drug and alcohol counsellor, Pam; Glenn Scarpelli appeared in the season three episode “The First Time”; and Michael Lembeck directed the season one episode “Sex Talk”.

<doc id="801679" wikidata="Q2295916" url="?curid=801679" title="Ultimatum game">
<text>The ultimatum game is a popular experimental economics game in which two players interact to decide how to divide a sum of money, first described by Nobel laureate John Harsanyi in 1961. The first player, the proposer, proposes a division of the sum with the second player, the responder. The responder can either accept the proposed division or reject it. If the responder accepts, the money is split according to the proposal; if the responder rejects, neither player receives anything. Both players know in advance the rules of the game.

The game is typically designed as a one-shot interaction to isolate immediate reactions to fairness, thereby minimizing the influence of potential future interactions. However, even within this one-shot context, participants&#x27; decision-making processes may implicitly involve considering the potential consequences of repeated interactions, due to the fact that humans have evolved within societies that interact repeatedly. This design is crucial for observing pure, unadulterated responses to the proposed division.

== Equilibrium analysis ==
For ease of exposition, the simple example illustrated above can be considered, where the proposer has two options: a fair split, or an unfair split. The argument given in this section can be extended to the more general case where the proposer can choose from many different splits.

A Nash equilibrium is a set of strategies (one for the proposer and one for the responder in this case), where no individual party can improve their reward by changing strategy. If the proposer always makes an unfair offer, the responder will do best by always accepting the offer, and the proposer will maximize their reward. Although it always benefits the responder to accept even unfair offers, the responder can adopt a strategy that rejects unfair splits often enough to induce the proposer to always make a fair offer. Any change in strategy by the proposer will lower their reward. Any change in strategy by the responder will result in the same reward or less. Thus, there are two sets of Nash equilibria for this game:
* The proposer always makes an unfair offer, and the responder always accepts an unfair offer. (The proposer never gives a fair offer so the responder can accept fair offers with any frequency without affecting the average reward.)
* The proposer always makes a fair offer. The responder rejects unfair offers often enough to make fair offers at least as profitable as unfair offers, and always accepts fair offers.

=== Finite Horizon ===
In a non-repeated or finite-horizon ultimatum game, the first Nash equilibria (unfair offer, always accept) are the only that satisfy a stricter condition called subgame perfection equilibrium (SPE). The game can be viewed as having two subgames that repeat themselves: the subgame where the proposer makes a fair offer, and the subgame where the proposer makes an unfair offer. An SPE occurs when there are Nash Equilibria in every subgame, that players have no incentive to deviate from. Using backward induction, we see that in the final stage, the responder will always accept any offer. Therefore, in previous stages, the proposer will always offer the minimum amount. Thus, the responder&#x27;s threat to reject unfair offers in the second Nash equilibrium is not credible in a finite setting.

=== Infinite Horizon ===
However, in an infinite-horizon ultimatum game, the analysis changes significantly. Repeated interactions allow for strategies based on reputation and reciprocity. Discount factors become crucial, and the Folk Theorem suggests that many payoff distributions, including &quot;fair&quot; outcomes, can be supported as Nash equilibria, and potentially as subgame perfect equilibria. The one-shot deviation principle is used to verify SPE in these cases. Therefore, the conclusion that only the &quot;unfair offer, always accept&quot; equilibrium is SPE is specific to finite horizon games. Infinite horizon games can have many SPE.

==Multi-valued or continuous strategies==

The simplest version of the ultimatum game has two possible strategies for the proposer, Fair and Unfair. A more realistic version would allow for many possible offers. For example, the item being shared might be a dollar bill, worth 100 cents, in which case the proposer&#x27;s strategy set would be all integers between 0 and 100, inclusive for their choice of offer, &quot;S&quot;. This would have two subgame perfect equilibria: (Proposer: &quot;S&quot;=0, Accepter: Accept), which is a weak equilibrium because the acceptor would be indifferent between their two possible strategies; and the strong (Proposer: &quot;S&quot;=1, Accepter: Accept if &quot;S&quot;&gt;=1 and Reject if &quot;S&quot;=0).

The ultimatum game is also often modelled using a continuous strategy set. Suppose the proposer chooses a share &quot;S&quot; of a pie to offer the receiver, where &quot;S&quot; can be any real number between 0 and 1, inclusive. If the receiver accepts the offer, the proposer&#x27;s payoff is (1-S) and the receiver&#x27;s is &quot;S&quot;. If the receiver rejects the offer, both players get zero. The unique subgame perfect equilibrium is (&quot;S&quot;=0, Accept). It is weak because the receiver&#x27;s payoff is 0 whether they accept or reject. No share with &quot;S&quot; &gt; 0 is subgame perfect, because the proposer would deviate to &quot;S&#x27; = S&quot; - formula_1 for some small number formula_1 and the receiver&#x27;s best response would still be to accept. The weak equilibrium is an artifact of the strategy space being continuous.

== Experimental results ==
The first experimental analysis of the ultimatum game was by Werner Güth, Rolf Schmittberger, and Bernd Schwarze: Their experiments were widely imitated in a variety of settings. When carried out between members of a shared social group (e.g., a village, a tribe, a nation, humanity) people offer &quot;fair&quot; (i.e., 50:50) splits, and offers of less than 30% are often rejected.

One limited study of monozygotic and dizygotic twins claims that genetic variation can have an effect on reactions to unfair offers, though the study failed to employ actual controls for environmental differences. It has also been found that delaying the responder&#x27;s decision leads to people accepting &quot;unfair&quot; offers more often. Common chimpanzees behaved similarly to humans by proposing fair offers in one version of the ultimatum game involving direct interaction between the chimpanzees. However, another study also published in November 2012 showed that both kinds of chimpanzees (common chimpanzees and bonobos) did not reject unfair offers, using a mechanical apparatus.

=== Cross-cultural differences ===

Some studies have found significant differences between cultures in the offers most likely to be accepted and most likely to maximize the proposer&#x27;s income. In one study of 15 small-scale societies, proposers in gift-giving cultures were more likely to make high offers and responders were more likely to reject high offers despite anonymity, while low offers were expected and accepted in other societies, which the authors suggested were related to the ways that giving and receiving were connected to social status in each group. Proposers and responders from WEIRD (Western, educated, industrialized, rich, democratic) societies are most likely to settle on equal splits.

=== Framing effects ===

Some studies have found significant effects of framing on game outcomes. Outcomes have been found to change based on characterizing the proposer&#x27;s role as giving versus splitting versus taking, or characterizing the game as a windfall game versus a routine transaction game.

== Explanations ==
The highly mixed results, along with similar results in the dictator game, have been taken as both evidence for and against the Homo economicus assumptions of rational, utility-maximizing, individual decisions. Since an individual who rejects a positive offer is choosing to get nothing rather than something, that individual must not be acting solely to maximize their economic gain, unless one incorporates economic applications of social, psychological, and methodological factors (such as the observer effect). Several attempts have been made to explain this behavior. Some suggest that individuals are maximizing their expected utility, but money does not translate directly into expected utility. Perhaps individuals get some psychological benefit from engaging in punishment or receive some psychological harm from accepting a low offer. It could also be the case that the second player, by having the power to reject the offer, uses such power as leverage against the first player, thus motivating them to be fair.

The classical explanation of the ultimatum game as a well-formed experiment approximating general behaviour often leads to a conclusion that the rational behavior in assumption is accurate to a degree, but must encompass additional vectors of decision making. Behavioral economic and psychological accounts suggest that second players who reject offers less than 50% of the amount at stake do so for one of two reasons. An altruistic punishment account suggests that rejections occur out of altruism: people reject unfair offers to teach the first player a lesson and thereby reduce the likelihood that the player will make an unfair offer in the future. Thus, rejections are made to benefit the second player in the future, or other people in the future. By contrast, a self-control account suggests that rejections constitute a failure to inhibit a desire to punish the first player for making an unfair offer. Morewedge, Krishnamurti, and Ariely (2014) found that intoxicated participants were more likely to reject unfair offers than sober participants. As intoxication tends to exacerbate decision makers&#x27; prepotent response, this result provides support for the self-control account, rather than the altruistic punishment account. Other research from social cognitive neuroscience supports this finding.

However, several competing models suggest ways to bring the cultural preferences of the players within the optimized utility function of the players in such a way as to preserve the utility maximizing agent as a feature of microeconomics. For example, researchers have found that Mongolian proposers tend to offer even splits despite knowing that very unequal splits are almost always accepted. Similar results from other small-scale societies players have led some researchers to conclude that &quot;reputation&quot; is seen as more important than any economic reward. Others have proposed the social status of the responder may be part of the payoff. Another way of integrating the conclusion with utility maximization is some form of inequity aversion model (preference for fairness). Even in anonymous one-shot settings, the economic-theory suggested outcome of minimum money transfer and acceptance is rejected by over 80% of the players.

An explanation which was originally quite popular was the &quot;learning&quot; model, in which it was hypothesized that proposers&#x27; offers would decay towards the sub game perfect Nash equilibrium (almost zero) as they mastered the strategy of the game; this decay tends to be seen in other iterated games. However, this explanation (bounded rationality) is less commonly offered now, in light of subsequent empirical evidence.

It has been hypothesized (e.g. by James Surowiecki) that very unequal allocations are rejected only because the absolute amount of the offer is low. The concept here is that if the amount to be split were 10 million dollars, a 9:1 split would probably be accepted rather than rejecting a 1 million-dollar offer. Essentially, this explanation says that the absolute amount of the endowment is not significant enough to produce strategically optimal behaviour. However, many experiments have been performed where the amount offered was substantial: studies by Cameron and Hoffman et al. have found that higher stakes cause offers to approach &quot;closer&quot; to an even split, even in a US$100 game played in Indonesia, where average per-capita income is much lower than in the United States. Rejections are reportedly independent of the stakes at this level, with US$30 offers being turned down in Indonesia, as in the United States, even though this equates to two weeks&#x27; wages in Indonesia. However, 2011 research with stakes of up to 40 weeks&#x27; wages in India showed that &quot;as stakes increase, rejection rates approach zero&quot;. It is worth noting that the instructions offered to proposers in this study explicitly state, &quot;if the responder&#x27;s goal is to earn as much money as possible from the experiment, they should accept any offer that gives them positive earnings, no matter how low,&quot; thus framing the game in purely monetary terms.

=== Neurological explanations ===
Generous offers in the ultimatum game (offers exceeding the minimum acceptable offer) are commonly made. Zak, Stanton &amp; Ahmadi (2007) showed that two factors can explain generous offers: empathy and perspective taking. They varied empathy by infusing participants with intranasal oxytocin or placebo (blinded). They affected perspective-taking by asking participants to make choices as both player 1 and player 2 in the ultimatum game, with later random assignment to one of these. Oxytocin increased generous offers by 80% relative to placebo. Oxytocin did not affect the minimum acceptance threshold or offers in the dictator game (meant to measure altruism). This indicates that emotions drive generosity.

Rejections in the ultimatum game have been shown to be caused by adverse physiologic reactions to stingy offers. In a brain imaging experiment by Sanfey et al., stingy offers (relative to fair and hyperfair offers) differentially activated several brain areas, especially the anterior insular cortex, a region associated with visceral disgust. If Player 1 in the ultimatum game anticipates this response to a stingy offer, they may be more generous.

An increase in rational decisions in the game has been found among experienced Buddhist meditators. fMRI data show that meditators recruit the posterior insular cortex (associated with interoception) during unfair offers and show reduced activity in the anterior insular cortex compared to controls.

People whose serotonin levels have been artificially lowered will reject unfair offers more often than players with normal serotonin levels.

People who have ventromedial frontal cortex lesions were found to be more likely to reject unfair offers. This was suggested to be due to the abstractness and delay of the reward, rather than an increased emotional response to the unfairness of the offer.

===Evolutionary game theory===
Other authors have used evolutionary game theory to explain behavior in the ultimatum game. Simple evolutionary models, e.g. the replicator dynamics, cannot account for the evolution of fair proposals or for rejections. These authors have attempted to provide increasingly complex models to explain fair behavior.

== Sociological applications ==
The ultimatum game is important from a sociological perspective, because it illustrates the human unwillingness to accept injustice. The tendency to refuse small offers may also be seen as relevant to the concept of honour.

The extent to which people are willing to tolerate different distributions of the reward from &quot;cooperative&quot; ventures results in inequality that is, measurably, exponential across the strata of management within large corporations. See also: Inequity aversion within companies.

== History ==
An early description of the ultimatum game is by Nobel laureate John Harsanyi in 1961, who footnotes Thomas Schelling&#x27;s 1960 book, &quot;The Strategy of Conflict&quot; on its solution by dominance methods. Harsanyi says,

: &quot;An important application of this principle is to ultimatum games, i.e., to bargaining games where one of the players can firmly commit himself in advance under a heavy penalty that he will insist under all conditions upon a certain specified demand (which is called his ultimatum)... Consequently, it will be rational for the first player to commit himself to his maximum demand, i.e., to the most extreme admissible demand he can make.&quot;

Josh Clark attributes modern interest in the game to Ariel Rubinstein, but the best-known article is the 1982 experimental analysis of Güth, Schmittberger, and Schwarze. Results from testing the ultimatum game challenged the traditional economic principle that consumers are rational and utility-maximising. This started a variety of research into the psychology of humans. Since the ultimatum game&#x27;s development, it has become a popular economic experiment, and was said to be &quot;quickly catching up with the Prisoner&#x27;s Dilemma as a prime showpiece of apparently irrational behavior&quot; in a paper by Martin Nowak, Karen M. Page, and Karl Sigmund.

== Variants ==
In the &quot;competitive ultimatum game&quot; there are many proposers and the responder can accept at most one of their offers: With more than three (naïve) proposers the responder is usually offered almost the entire endowment (which would be the Nash Equilibrium assuming no collusion among proposers).

In the &quot;ultimatum game with tipping&quot;, a tip is allowed from responder back to proposer, a feature of the trust game, and net splits tend to be more equitable.

The &quot;reverse ultimatum game&quot; gives more power to the responder by giving the proposer the right to offer as many divisions of the endowment as they like. Now the game only ends when the responder accepts an offer or abandons the game, and therefore the proposer tends to receive slightly less than half of the initial endowment.

Incomplete information ultimatum games: Some authors have studied variants of the ultimatum game in which either the proposer or the responder has private information about the size of the pie to be divided. These experiments connect the ultimatum game to principal-agent problems studied in contract theory.

The pirate game illustrates a variant with more than two participants with voting power, as illustrated in Ian Stewart&#x27;s &quot;A Puzzle for Pirates&quot;.

<doc id="801682" wikidata="Q1406917" url="?curid=801682" title="Long-distance relationship">
<text>A long-distance relationship (LDR) or long-distance romantic relationship is an intimate relationship between partners who are geographically separated from one another. Partners in LDRs face geographic separation and lack of face-to-face contact. LDRs are particularly prevalent among college students, constituting 25% to 50% of all relationships. Even though scholars have reported a significant number of LDRs in undergraduate populations, long-distance relationships continue to be an understudied phenomenon.

Also, a romantic long-distance relationship (rLDR) refers to a relationship when communication opportunities are limited due to geographical factors, and the individuals involved in the relationship have expectations of maintaining a close connection.

==Characteristics==
LDRs are qualitatively different from geographically close relationships; that is, relationships in which the partners are able to see each other, face-to-face, most days. According to Rohlfing (1995) he suggests the following unique challenges for those in long-distance relationships:
*Increased financial burdens to maintain relationships
*Difficulty maintaining geographically close friendships while in long-distance romantic relationships
*Difficulty judging the state of a relationship from a distance
*High expectations by partners for the quality of limited face-to-face meetings in the relationship

==LDRs with friends and family==
Not all long-distance relationships are romantic. When individuals go away to school, their relationships with family and friends also become long-distance. Pew Internet (2004) asserts that 79% of adult respondents from the United States reported using the Internet for communication with family and friends. Also, Pew Internet (2002a) states that because of new technologies, college students will have greater social ties with their friends than their family members. Therefore, examining email among college students helps explore how the Internet is affecting college students emotionally and socially.

Under the great influence of globalization, together with the advancement in transportation and communication technologies, migration has gradually become a feature of contemporary society. As a result, transnational families have become increasingly common in which family members live in different regions and countries, yet hold a sense of collective unity across national borders. For instance, children choose to leave home to study abroad, parents decide to leave home for better prospects and salaries, or siblings pursue different life paths around the world.

=== Sustaining family relationships ===
A qualitative study that conducted 50 interviews with adult migrant children in Australia and their parents in Italy, Ireland, and the Netherlands found that geographically separated family members generally exchanged all types of care and support that proximate families did, including financial, practical, personal, accommodation, and emotional or moral support. According to Loretta Baldassar, a closely related ethnographic analysis of 30 transnational families between grown-up migrant children living in Australia and their parents in Italy from the 1950s to 2000s illustrated that the exchange of emotional and moral support between parents and children was the fundamental factor for sustaining and staying committed to family relationships in transnational families. The prevalence of Internet technologies has facilitated remote family members’ emotional exchange, and provided them with the opportunity of accessible and affordable long-distance communication on a daily basis for sustaining relationships.

Cao (2013) conducted a series of interviews with 14 individuals who constantly communicated with family members living in different time zones, namely the UK, US, Canada, and China. Analysis revealed that among a variety of communication methods, including synchronous means such as telephone and Internet audio/video call (e.g., Skype) and asynchronous methods such as email or text messaging, remote family members relied heavily on synchronous methods for virtual contact. The real-time interactivity from synchronous communication provides a sense of presence, connectedness, and dedication between family members, which is regarded by Cao as an essential component of emotional support. However, it is worth noting that the Internet technologies have not replaced the use of older, less useful forms of communication, in which transnational families still use letters, cards, gifts, and photographs, etc. for showing their care and love.

Research has shown that people sustain close relationships using different communication patterns with different family members. While people usually communicate heavily with immediate family members such as parents or children, they tend to communicate less frequently and regularly with other family members including siblings across time zones. It is suggested that siblings feel less obligated to communicate dedicatedly with each other, especially for the younger generation, and they prefer ad hoc communication such as through instant messages to update each other&#x27;s status.

=== The effects of geographical separation on children’s well-being ===
Globally, there is a considerable number of parents who travel to another country in search of work, leaving behind their children in their home country. These parents hope to provide their children with better future life chances. The impacts of parents’ migration for work on left-behind children&#x27;s growth are mixed, depending on various factors and the outcomes of transnational living arrangements on children&#x27;s well-being vary. For instance, through surveying a sample of 755 Mexican households with at least one family member who had migrated to the US, researchers reported that left-behind children might benefit economically from the remittances their parents sent home while suffering emotionally from long-term separation. Similar results were found by Lahaie, Hayes, Piper, and Heymann (2009), a correlational study investigating the relationship between parental migration and children&#x27;s mental health outcomes using a representative sample of transnational families in Mexico and the US.

In addition, whether the mother or father migrates for work also plays a role. Based on the interviews and observations with Filipina transnational families, children tended to experience more emotional problems from transnational motherhood than fatherhood, taking the traditional family gender roles into account. The impacts of parent migration on children&#x27;s psychological well-being are also distinctive in different countries. With reference to the data collected from the cross-sectional baseline study of Children Health and Migrant Parents in Southeast Asia (CHMPSEA), Graham and Jordan (2011) showed that children of migrant fathers in Indonesia and Thailand were more likely to suffer from poor psychological health when compared to children in non-migrant families, while the findings did not replicate in children from Philippine and Vietnam. Special care arrangement for left-behind children, such as asking the extended family members for help to take on caregiving tasks, affects children&#x27;s growth substantially. Lahaie et al. (2009) revealed that children who took care of themselves had a higher probability to exhibit behavioral and academic problems when compared to other children with care arrangements. The feeling of being abandoned by parents is proposed to be one of the reasons that the children commit to undesirable behaviors such as quitting school or gang involvement as retaliation.

== Formats of LDR ==
Long-distance relationships (LDRs) exhibit considerable variation based on their specific contexts. For example, Smith-Osborne and Jani(2014) note that military LDRs are influenced by military culture, where mission priorities often overshadow personal relationships.

Similarly, Nickels(2019) investigates relationships involving incarcerated partners, highlighting challenges such as restricted communication, societal stigma, and significant financial burdens.

In commuter relationships, where partners reside in different cities, regular visits and communication help maintain their connection. Research by Rhodes(2002) indicates that these relationships can endure through a mix of in-person meetings and digital communication, providing flexibility despite the physical distance.

Transnational relationships involve partners from different countries, requiring them to navigate cultural differences alongside geographical separation. These relationships heavily depend on technology for communication, which facilitates bridging cultural divides and enhancing mutual understanding between partners.

== Challenges ==
According to Tara Suwinyattichaiporn(2017) research, there are some issues in long-distance relationships.

=== Idealization of partners ===
Idealization is a major concern in LDRs that involve unrealistic positive impressions of the partner and the relationship. Additionally, Stafford(2007) in his study concluded that idealization during separation corresponds with postreunion instability.

The study concluded that LDRs partners are more likely to have a break up after getting back together than when they are separated. Reunion stability was positively related to face-to-face contact during the time apart but was negatively related to CMC and mail contact. Also, idealization during separation has a negative effect on stability after changing the status of the relationship from separation to proximity.

The absence of close contact and the use of computer technologies in communication lead to positive impression management.

Although idealization can maintain LDRs by enhancing relational satisfaction and stability, it becomes problematic when couples move to physical proximity because reality tends to differ with the idealized images.

=== Relational uncertainty ===
LDRs are characterised by physical separation of the partners and, therefore, the partners are bound to experience higher levels of uncertainty.

==== Types of uncertainty ====

* Self-uncertainty, including skepticism regarding one’s own emotion.
* Partner uncertainty as a feeling insecure about the partner’s affection and devotion.
* Relationship uncertainty of the general status of the relationship.

LDRs are also characterised by limited contact and fewer visits hence the element of uncertainty is more pronounced. It is most commonly linked to decreased satisfaction.

=== Jealousy ===
Jealousy occurs more frequently in LDRs due to relational uncertainty or use of social media and other similar platforms.

=== Communication challenges ===
LDRs are especially dependent on technology, and while they allow for high-quality interactions, they can also exacerbate such concerns as idealization. LDR partners claim their communication is more purposeful but have higher levels of conflict when they move to live close to each other

However, Tara Suwinyattichaiporn(2017) mentioned one positive aspect of long-distance relationships (LDRs) that gives them an advantage over geographically close relationships (GCRs): the opportunity to have higher quality interactions during the time that is spent with each other. According to the survey, LDR couples said that the time they spent communicating or meeting is more meaningful, focused and purposeful than GCR couples. Such intentionality may result in more profound emotional entwinement and less daily conflict between them during their communications.

Moreover, according to Stafford(2010) the lack of physical proximity and the fact that the relationship is often considered taboo to have such conversations with a partner who lives nearby are normal and beneficial for LDRs .

== Military long-distance relationship ==
The partners of military personnel deployed abroad experience a significant amount of stress, before and during the deployment. The difference between a military LDR and a regular LDR is that, while the regular LDR there is more communication the military LDR communication is unexpected and controlled by military regulations or there is not much time to talk. Because of the communication restrictions and the overall process of deployment, this leaves the partner back home feeling lonely, and stressing on how to keep a strong relationship moving forward. Other stressors that add to the emotional situation are the realization that the service member is being deployed to a combat zone where their life is threatened. Through all the stages of the deployment the partner will exhibit many emotional problems, such as anxiety, loss, denial, anger, depression, and acceptance.

This type of long-distance relationship is very hard to maintain. That is why there are some ways of adjustment that partners follow to stay together and prevent problems from arising.

&quot;Independence of the non-deployed Partner:&quot;

First is independence of a non-deployed partner and rejection of traditional gender roles. Due to the fact that the deployed partner is busy with his mission, the non-deployed partner should understand that all responsibility of making  decisions about family, household, handling finances and caring for children should be done by himself

&quot;Flexibility and adjustment to expectations:&quot;

Both partners should be flexible and accept that traditional expectations, like consistent communication, shared parenting, may not always be feasible. Moreover, non-deployed partners should accept “military culture” which posits that mission and military duties are priorities over personal relationships and love. These adjustments help to manage expectations and make both partners comfortable together.

=== Limitations of research ===
Most of the knowledge regarding changes in military long-distance relationships is based on research carried out in a particular cultural and geographical settings, namely American. These findings may not capture the differences in military cultures and norms of societies in other countries.

== Incarcerated Long-Distance Relationships ==
Incarcerated long-distance relationships have their own features that are similar to military ones but with some differences that make them harder to maintain.

* Stigma and lack of support

Non-prisoned partner can face lack of support from surroundings  to stay in a relationship with an incarcerated partner and as a result feel more lonely, isolated and unmotivated to maintain the relationship.

* Barriers to maintaining the relationship

These barriers include limited intimacy due to prison restrictions, high communication costs, physical distance, and stress about the future with an incarcerated partner.

* Behaviors for maintaining incarcerated LDRs

A study identified five key behaviors that support the maintenance of incarcerated LDRs:

* Positivity: behaving cheerfully and optimistically during interactions.
* Openness: sharing thoughts, feelings, and discussing the quality of the relationship.
* Assurances: expressing affection and commitment to the relationship.
* Sharing tasks: collaborating on shared responsibilities where possible.
* Social network involvement: spending time with mutual friends and involving family in activities.

=== Limitations of research ===
This research is a quantitative cross-sectional study done at a national level and can be assumed to reflect the results of the country’s cultural and institutional environment. It may not hold true in every country because the structure of prison systems, cultural differences, and financial situations can greatly affect these kinds of relationships.

==Statistics in the US==
In 2005 a survey suggested that in the United States, 14 to 15 million people considered themselves to be in a long-distance relationship. By 2015, this number remained at about 14 million. About 32.5% of college relationships are long-distance. The average amount of distance in a long-distance relationship is 125 miles. Couples in a long-distance relationship call each other every 2.7 days. On average, couples in long-distance relationships will visit each other 1.5 times a month. Also couples in long-distance relationships expect to live together around 14 months into the relationship. About 40% of couples in long-distance relationships break up; around 4.5 months into the relationship is the time when couples most commonly start having problems. 70% of couples in a long-distance relationship break up due to unplanned circumstances and events. 75% of all engaged couples have, at some point, been in a long distance relationship, and around 10% of couples continue to maintain a long-distance relationship after marriage. About 3.75 million married couples are in a long-distance relationship in the US alone.

==Means of staying in contact==
New communication technologies such as cellular phone plans make communication among individuals at a distance easier than in the past. Before the popularity of internet dating, long-distance relationships were not as common, as the primary forms of communication between the romance lovers usually involved either telephone conversations or corresponding via mail. According to Pew Internet, American citizens were asked how often they used the Internet on a typical day, they reported 56% sending or reading email, 10% reported sending instant messages, and 9% reported using an online social network such as Facebook or Twitter. However, with the advent of the Internet, long-distance relationships have exploded in popularity as they become less challenging to sustain with the use of modern technology. Ultimately, communicating and setting realistic goals can help prevent disconnection and the loss of touch.

The increase in long-distance relationships is matched by an increasing number of technologies designed specifically to support intimate couples living apart. In particular there have been a host of devices which have attempted to mimic co-located behaviors at a distance including hugging and even kissing. The success of these technologies has, so far, been limited.

Couples who have routine, strategic relational maintenance behaviors, and take advantage of social media can help maintain a long-distance relationship. Having positivity (making interactions cheerful and pleasant), openness (directly discussing the relationship and one&#x27;s feelings), assurances (reassuring the partner about the relationship and the future), network (relying on support and love of others), shared tasks (performing common tasks) and conflict management (giving the partner advice) are some of the routine and strategic relation maintenance behaviors 

The differentiation of social media usage during LDR consists of several actions, including video-calls(Instagram, Whatsapp, Snapchat, Viber, Skype, Discord, Telegram etc), phone-calls, and everyday chatting.

Research of Abel, Machin and Brownlow(2020) discusses the main themes regarding interactions in a social media context.

Families utilize various social media platforms for functional and transactional tasks, engaging in bonding activities through audiovisual calls that are often used for casual conversations or group chats help maintain bonds without intruding on each other&#x27;s time. However, barriers such as limited internet access, lower socioeconomic status, and digital literacy can hinder these interactions. Also they demonstrate resilience by recreating face-to-face rituals online, maintaining traditions despite geographic separation.

According to Morgan R. Kuske(2020), long-distance partners use social media to keep in contact such as  Snapchat, Facebook, Instagram, WhatsApp, and Twitter. It is the most convenient way to have private communication.

Shared online activities are also the methods of staying in contact. There will be engaging in online-games (in Discord and other platforms), watching movies together (due to the technological advance of such services), sharing shortcut videos like in Tiktok and Reels in Instagram. Couples can organize virtual dates where they participate in the same activities, like preparing a meal together or watching a film at the same time. Engaging in multiplayer games offers them an interactive way to connect through friendly competition and teamwork. Additionally, utilizing technology to discover new locations together — such as through virtual museum tours or live-streamed travel experiences — can strengthen their sense of partnership. Participating in creative activities, like painting portraits of one another during a video call, can be both enjoyable and insightful.

The idea of giving and receiving gifts exists as an important factor of LDR lasting and duration. Gift exchange across distances can disrupt the solitude of distance, becoming a way of exchanging experiences between people who are geographically apart. This research points out that such gifts are most fulfilling because the recipient gets to receive much more than the physical item, it is a message of the self that may be difficult to put into words.Some sites on the Internet consist of different gifts that could be shared with one’s partner. Continuing, when a person lacks money for delivery or transportation, there is an opportunity to make various types of DIV’s, so called “hand-made” gifts. Attention should be paid also to the seriosity of pages and sites, not to ruin the relationship because of the strangers’ blogs.

The lack of physical touch is not disappearing. However, scientists, consumers and psychologists already have devices that could try to fulfill the gap that untouchability causes.  Starting from the sensory bracelets, heartbeat rings, and ending with the adult toys, the variety for choice is increasing everyday. The research conducted by Saadatian and Samani(2014) presents the idea of &quot;kiss messaging,&quot; a digital technology created to replicate the sensation of kissing. This innovation seeks to close the emotional gap caused by physical separation by offering a way for partners to show affection. Kiss messaging acts as a substitute for physical contact, enabling couples to perform intimate actions that would be unattainable due to distance.

==Relationship maintenance behaviors==
Intimate relationship partners constantly work to improve their relationship. There are many ways in which they can make their partner happy and strengthen the overall relationship. The ways in which individuals behave have a major effect on the satisfaction and the durability of the relationship. Researchers have found systems of maintenance behaviors between intimate partners. Maintenance behaviors can be separated into seven categories: assurances in relation to love and commitment in the relationship, openness in sharing their feelings, conflict management, positive interactions, sharing tasks, giving advice to their partner, and using social networks for support (Dainton, 2000; Stafford, Dainton, &amp; Haas, 2000).

Dindia and Emmers-Sommer (2006) identified three categories of maintaining behaviors that are used by partners to deal with separation. &quot;Prospective behaviors, such as telling the partner goodbye, which addresses anticipated separation; introspective behaviors, which is communication when the partners are apart; and retrospective behaviors which are basically talking to each other face to face, which reaffirms connection after separation.&quot; (Dindia, &amp; Emmers-Sommer, 2006). These are known as the relationship continuity constructional units (RCCUs). Maintenance behaviors as well as the RCCUs are correlated with an increase in relationship satisfaction, as well as, commitment (Pistole et al., 2010).

==Research==
In a study of jealousy experience, expression, in LDRs, 114 individuals who were in LDRs indicated how much face-to-face contact they had in a typical week. Thirty-three percent of participants reported no face-to-face contact, whereas 67% reported periodic face-to-face contact with a mean of one to two days. The researchers compared LDRs to GCRs (geographically close relationships) and discovered that those in LDRs with no face-to-face contact experience more jealousy than those with periodic face-to-face contact or those in GCRs. Furthermore, those without periodic face-to-face contact were more likely to use the internet to communicate with their partner. They found that the presence of periodic face-to-face contact is a crucial factor in the satisfaction, commitment, and trust of LDR partners. Those who do not experience periodic face-to-face contact reported significantly lower levels of satisfaction, commitment, and trust.

Another study generated a sample of 335 undergraduate students who were in LDRs and became geographically close. Of the reunited couples, 66 individuals terminated their relationships after moving to the same location, whereas 114 continued their relationship.

A study done by Stafford, Merolla, and Castle (2006) reported that the transition from being separated geographically to proximal increased partner interference. Based on the Communicative Interdependence Perspective, it was found that when partners switched from technologically mediated communication (TMC) to face-to-face (FtF) or vice versa, they experienced certain levels of discomfort. The transition from FtF to TMC communication can make it difficult to express one&#x27;s emotions and can be easier to cause miscommunication. It is believed to be plausible that transitions can be a risk factor towards long-distance dating relationships.

Based on the analysis of the open-ended responses, 97% of respondents noted some type of relationship change associated with the LD-GC (geographically close) transition. When the respondents were asked about having the ability to have more face-to-face time when GC and the enjoyment of increased time spent together most comments were positive. For example, &quot;We finally got to do all the &#x27;little&#x27; things we&#x27;d been wanting to do for so long; we get to hold each other, wake up next to each other, eat together, etc.&quot; Many Individuals reported a loss of autonomy, following reunion. For example, many individuals liked and missed the &quot;freedom&quot; or &quot;privacy&quot; the distance allowed. Reports of &quot;nagging&quot;, demanding or expecting &quot;too much&quot; were also frequent responses. Several individuals reported more conflict and &quot;fighting&quot; in their relationship after it became geographically close. Many said they felt the conflict in their relationship was not only more frequent but also more difficult to resolve. For example, one individual stated that, when his/her relationship was long-distance, they &quot;fought less and if we did fight, problems were solved in a shorter amount of time.&quot; For some individuals living in the same location led to increased feelings of jealousy. After witnessing their partner&#x27;s behavior, some participants said that they became increasingly concerned that their partners were currently &quot;cheating&quot; on them or had &quot;cheated on them in the past.&quot; Reunion allowed the discovery of positive as well as negative characteristics about their partner, feeling that the partner had changed in some way since the relationship was long-distance.

<text>La Coupole (), also known as the Coupole d&#x27;Helfaut-Wizernes and originally codenamed Bauvorhaben&quot; 21(&#x27;Building Project 21&#x27;) or Schotterwerk Nordwest&quot; (Northwest Gravel Works), is a Second World War bunker complex in the Pas-de-Calais &quot;department&quot; of northern France, about from Saint-Omer, and some 14.4 kilometers (8.9 miles) south-southeast from the less developed Blockhaus d&#x27;Éperlecques V-2 launch installation in the same area. It was built by the forces of Nazi Germany between 1943 and 1944 to serve as a launch base for V-2 rockets directed against London and southern England and is the earliest known precursor to modern underground missile silos still in existence.

Constructed in the side of a disused chalk quarry, the most prominent feature of the complex is an immense concrete dome, to which its modern name refers. It was built above a network of tunnels housing storage areas, launch facilities and crew quarters. The facility was designed to store a large stockpile of V-2s, warheads and fuel and was intended to launch V-2s on an industrial scale. Dozens of missiles a day were to be fuelled, prepared and launched in rapid sequence against London and southern England.

Following repeated heavy bombing by Allied forces during Operation Crossbow, the Germans were unable to complete the construction works and the complex never entered service. It was captured by the Allies in September 1944, partially demolished on the orders of Winston Churchill to prevent its reuse as a military base, and then abandoned. It remained derelict until the mid-1990s. In 1997 it opened to the public for the first time, as a museum. Exhibits in the tunnels and under the dome tell the story of the German occupation of France during World War II, the V-weapons and the history of space exploration.

==Background==
The V-2 rocket was one of several innovative long-range weapons developed by the Germans after the failure of the Luftwaffe to strike a decisive blow against Britain. It was a revolutionary weapon—the world&#x27;s first operational SRBM—that had been developed in a secret programme begun in 1936. The German leadership hoped that a barrage of rockets unleashed against London would force Britain out of the war. Although Adolf Hitler was at first ambivalent, he eventually became an enthusiastic supporter of the V-2 programme as Allied air forces carried out increasingly devastating attacks on German cities.

The 12.5-ton missile, standing high on its launch pad, was fuelled primarily by liquid oxygen (LOX) and ethanol. Deploying the V-2 on a large scale required far more LOX than was available from existing production sites in Germany and the occupied countries. New sources of LOX were required, situated close to the missile launching sites to reduce as far as possible the loss of propellant through evaporation. The missile&#x27;s operational range of meant that the launch sites had to be fairly close to the English Channel or southern North Sea coasts, in northern France, Belgium or the western Netherlands.

Because of the complexity of the missile and the need for extensive testing prior to launch, the V-2&#x27;s designers at the Peenemünde Army Research Center favoured using heavily defended fixed sites where the missiles could be stored, armed, and fuelled from an on-site LOX production plant before launching. But the German Army and the V-2 project&#x27;s head, Major-General Walter Dornberger, were concerned that the sites would be vulnerable to aerial attack by the Allies. The Army&#x27;s preferred option was to use &quot;Meillerwagen&quot;, mobile firing batteries, which presented a much smaller target for the Allied air forces.

The Army was nonetheless overruled by Hitler, who had a long-standing preference for huge, grandiose constructions. He preferred fixed installations along the lines of the virtually impregnable U-boat pens that had been built to protect Germany&#x27;s U-boat fleet. In March 1943, he ordered the construction of a massive bunker (now known as the Blockhaus d&#x27;Éperlecques) in the Forest of Éperlecques near Watten, north of Saint-Omer. The bunker was soon spotted by Allied reconnaissance, and on 27 August 1943, a raid by 187 Boeing B-17 Flying Fortress bombers wrecked the construction site before it could be completed. A surviving portion was reused by the Germans as a LOX production facility.

==Design and location==

The successful attack against the Watten bunker forced the German Army to find an alternative location for a launch site nearby. They had already taken possession of an old quarry between the villages of Helfaut and Wizernes, south-west of Saint-Omer and some south of the Watten bunker, near the river Aa alongside the Boulogne–Saint-Omer railway line, about from Wizernes station. The quarry had been designated for use as a missile storage depot where V-2s would be housed in tunnels bored into the chalk hillside before being transported for launching. The Germans undertook major work in August 1943 to lay extensive railway sidings to connect the quarry to the main line.

On 30 September 1943, Hitler met with Albert Speer, the Minister of Armaments and War Production, and Franz Xaver Dorsch, the chief engineer of the Todt Organisation, to discuss plans for a replacement for the out-of-commission Watten facility. Dorsch proposed to transform the Wizernes depot into a vast bomb-proof underground complex that would require a million tons of concrete to build. It would be constructed within a network of tunnels to be dug inside the hillside at the edge of the quarry. A concrete dome, thick, in diameter and weighing 55,000 tons, would be built over the top of the central part of the facility to protect it from Allied bombing. Beneath it, about of tunnels were to be dug into the chalk hillside to accommodate workshops, storerooms, fuel supplies, a LOX manufacturing plant, generators, barracks and a hospital.

A standard gauge railway tunnel, codenamed &quot;Ida&quot;, was to be built on a curving path that would connect it with both the east- and west-bound main line railway, allowing trains to run straight through the complex without needing to reverse or be turned around. This would serve as the main unloading station, where missiles and supplies would be offloaded onto trolleys that would transport them into the connecting galleries &quot;Mathilde&quot; and &quot;Hugo&quot;. &quot;Hugo&quot; connected in turn with &quot;Sophie&quot;, a dead-end railway tunnel branching from the main line into &quot;Ida&quot;. Each of the main tunnels had a number of unnamed side tunnels of the same dimensions as the main tunnels and up to long. The central feature of the complex was a huge octagonal rocket-preparation chamber directly under the dome. It was never completed but would have been in diameter and up to high. A number of intermediate floors, possibly as many as ten, would have been built up the sides of the chamber.

The western side of the chamber opened onto two tall passageways, opening onto two tracks to the outdoor launchpads, with the tracked passages and launchpads named &quot;Gustav&quot; (the southerly-located pad) and &quot;Gretchen&quot; (the northerly-located pad), both on the western side of the domed complex. Each was to have been protected by bomb-proof doors made of steel and concrete. The passageways were to be wide and at least high and were angled in a Y-shape, both exiting westwards into the quarry. The outdoor launchpads for the V-2 rockets would have been at the end of each passageway. The two passageways were angled at 64° 50&#x27; and 99° 50&#x27; west of north respectively—not aligned with any probable target but merely permitting the rockets to be transported to either one or the other, of their pair of sufficiently separated launch pads.

The facility was designed, as was its predecessor at Watten, to receive, process and launch V-2 rockets at a high rate. Trains carrying V-2s would enter the heart of the complex through the &quot;Ida&quot; rail tunnel, where they would be unloaded. A large number of V-2s could be stored in the side tunnels; LOX would also be produced on-site ready for use. When the time came, the rockets would be moved into the octagonal preparation chamber where they would be lifted to a vertical position for fuelling and arming. From there they would be transported on motorised launch carriages, still in a vertical position, through the &quot;Gustav&quot; and &quot;Gretchen&quot; passageways. The launch pads were located at the end of the track on the floor of the quarry, from where the missiles would be fired.

The priority target for the V-2s was away: London, which Hitler wanted to see pulverised by the end of 1943. The Allies were alarmed when an analyst found that part of the complex was aligned within half a degree of the Great Circle bearing on New York, and its equipment was large enough to accommodate a rocket twice the size of the V-2: the &quot;America Rocket&quot;, the proposed A10 intercontinental ballistic missile.

Although physically separate, another facility built in nearby Roquetoire was an integral part of the Wizernes complex. &quot;Umspannwerk C&quot; was built to house a Leitstrahl radio command guidance system which could be used to send course corrections to missiles launched from Wizernes to fine-tune their trajectory during the launch phase.

==Construction==

The Allies first noticed construction activity at Wizernes in mid-August 1943 when the Germans began building railway track and the offloading stores into the old quarry. After Hitler authorised the decision to turn the depot into a missile launch site, construction was stepped up. Work on the dome began in November 1943 and tunnelling in the cliff face below began in December. At the start of January, Allied reconnaissance aircraft observed an elaborate system of camouflage on the hilltop, installed to conceal the dome. The building works were greatly hindered by the constant air-raid warnings, which stopped work 229 times in May 1944 alone. In response to Hitler&#x27;s desire to see the site completed the workforce was expanded substantially from 1,100 in April 1944 to nearly 1,400 by June. About 60% of the workers were Germans; skilled workers, such as miners from Westphalia, were recruited to excavate the tunnels and build the dome. The remainder were slave labour: principally Frenchmen conscripted by the Service du travail obligatoire (STO), plus Soviet prisoners of war. The project was overseen by several large German construction companies, with Philipp Holzman A.G. of Frankfurt am Main and the Grossdeutsche Schachtbau and Tiefbohr GmbH serving as the chief contractors.

One of the most difficult challenges faced by the Germans was constructing the great dome while under regular air attack. The dome&#x27;s designer, Todt Organisation engineer Werner Flos, devised a plan under which the dome would be built first, flat upon the ground, and the soil underneath it would be excavated so that the construction works below would be protected against aerial attacks. A circular trench was excavated on the top of the hill above the quarry to an outside diameter of . The dome was built within this trench and the galleries and octagonal preparation chamber were excavated below.

As an additional bomb-proofing method, the dome was surrounded by a bomb-proof &quot;skirt&quot; or &quot;Zerschellerplatte&quot; of steel-reinforced concrete, wide and thick. This was supported by a series of buttresses, which were not tied into the dome itself, above the entrances to the &quot;Gustav&quot; and &quot;Gretchen&quot; tunnels. Another concrete structure was tied into the skirt to the north-west of the dome, which was perhaps intended for use as an observation and control tower. A separate underground building was constructed on the western side of the quarry to serve as a hospital and as offices for the engineers. A Decauville narrow-gauge railway was installed on the quarry floor to transport supplies from the main line to the construction site.

A cube-shaped concrete building was constructed on the top of the hill, next to the dome. This was intended to be used as the bomb-proof outlet for a ventilation and air conditioning shaft. It was an essential component of a facility where dangerous and explosive gases were expected to be used in large quantities on a daily basis. It was never finished, and the Allies found when they captured the site that the ventilation shaft had not been fully excavated. The building survived the bombing intact and is still prominently visible today.

Unlike its sister site at Watten, there was no on-site power plant. Electricity at Wizernes was provided by a connection to the main electric grid, with power consumption estimated at between 5,000 and 6,000 kVA.

==Discovery and Allied attacks==
The Allies became aware of the Wizernes site in August 1943 when the Germans began laying extensive new rail sidings which were spotted by RAF reconnaissance flights. Late 1943, a Belgian, Jacques de Duve, supported by German opponents, informed MI5 about the existence of a rocket production site in Saint-Omer. MI5 did not believe de Duve, who was interned for the rest of the war in Latchmere House. In November 1943, the Allied Central Interpretation Unit reported that the Germans had begun constructing the concrete dome and were undertaking tunnelling works in the east face of the quarry. However, it was not until the following March that the Allies added the site to the list of targets for the bombing campaign against V-weapon sites that had already wrecked the Watten bunker and numerous V-1 flying bomb launching sites. Over the next few months, the USAAF and RAF carried out 16 air raids involving 811 bombers that dropped some 4,260 tons of bombs. The bombing caused destruction across a wide area, killing 55 residents of the nearby village of Helfault.

Conventional bombing raids only achieved a single bomb hit on the dome itself, causing negligible damage. However, in June and July 1944 the RAF began attacking the site with , ground-penetrating Tallboy bombs. The external construction works were completely wrecked by the bombing and one Tallboy landed just beside the dome, blowing out the entire quarry cliff face and burying the entrances to the &quot;Gustav&quot; and &quot;Gretchen&quot; tunnels. The entrance to &quot;Sophie&quot; was also buried, leaving &quot;Ida&quot; as the only entrance to the facility. The dome was unscathed but the buttresses supporting the protective &quot;Zerschellerplatte&quot; were dislodged and slid partway down into the quarry. Serious damage was also caused to the tunnels beneath the dome. The damage made it impossible to continue work on the site. Dornberger complained: &quot;Persistent air attack with heavy and super-heavy bombs so battered the rock all around that in the spring of 1944 landslides made further work impossible.&quot; His staff reported on 28 July 1944 that, although the dome had not been hit by the Tallboys, &quot;the whole area around has been so churned up that it is unapproachable, and the bunker is jeopardised from underneath.&quot;

Although three launch battalions were formed by the Germans in late 1943, they never got the chance to deploy to the V-weapons launch sites at Watten and Wizernes. On 3 July 1944, the Oberkommando West authorised the cessation of construction at the heavily damaged sites. On 18 July 1944, Hitler abandoned plans for launching V-2s from bunkers and authorized the downgrading of the Wizernes bunker to make it a LOX production facility. However, these plans were overtaken by the Allied liberation of Northern France following the Normandy landings. The site was finally abandoned a few days before the Allies reached it at the start of September during the rapid liberation of the area by British, American, Canadian and Polish troops. British engineers inspected it on 5 September.

==Post-war investigations==

Shortly after the Wizernes site had been captured in September 1944, Duncan Sandys, the head of the British &quot;Crossbow Committee&quot; investigating the V-weapons programme, ordered the constitution of a Technical Inter-Services Mission under Colonel T. R. B. Sanders. It was given the task of investigating the sites at Mimoyecques, Siracourt, Watten, and Wizernes, collectively known to the Allies as the &quot;Heavy Crossbow&quot; sites. Sanders&#x27; report was submitted to the War Cabinet on 19 March 1945.

The purpose of the Wizernes site had been unclear prior to its capture but Sanders was able to deduce its connection with the V-2 from the dimensions of the complex and some intelligence information that his team had been able to retrieve. Sanders&#x27; report concluded that it was &quot;an assembly site for long projectiles most conveniently handled and prepared in a vertical position&quot;. He conjectured the approximate length of the projectiles from the height of the &quot;Gustav&quot; and &quot;Gretchen&quot; tunnels, though he noted that there was some doubt about the height of the doors at the tunnel entrances. Segments of the doors had been recovered from a storage dump near Watten railway station but were incomplete. Judging from the size of the tunnel entrance, the maximum size of the projectile could have been between and in length and in breadth. (This was substantially larger than the V-2, which measured long and wide.) Two witnesses interviewed by the Sanders team reported &quot;an intention of firing a projectile 18 metres long&quot;. Sanders noted that &quot;the dimensions of the site make it suitable for the A.4 (V-2) rocket, but the possibility of a new rocket up to half as long again as the A.4 and twice the weight cannot be ruled out.&quot; He concluded that much of the site was becoming unsafe due to the progressive collapse of timbering and recommended that the tunnels and workings under the dome should be destroyed to prevent subsequent accidents or misuse.

==Preservation==

The site reverted to private ownership after the war. As the quarry had long since been worked out, it was abandoned. The tunnels were not destroyed but were sealed off, though at some point they were reopened by local people and could be entered; the octagon remained sealed off with a ceiling-to-floor barricade. The quarry itself remained in almost the same condition as it had been in 1944, with sections of railway track still in place on the quarry floor. The hospital section remained relatively intact and was used by the local gendarmes as a shooting range.

In 1986, the Espace Naturel Régional in Lille earmarked 10 million francs to develop the site as a tourist attraction for the Nord-Pas-de-Calais region with the intention of establishing a World War II Museum there. The plan was publicised in a special open weekend on 20–21 June 1987, attended by over 20,000 people, in which the dome&#x27;s designer Werner Flos met Professor Reginald Victor Jones, a surviving member of the &quot;Crossbow Committee&quot;, at Wizernes. The &quot;Ida&quot; tunnel and side chambers were opened to the public and used for an audio-visual exhibition of the site&#x27;s history.

Local historian Yves le Maner was charged with the task of developing the project while a feasibility study was conducted into the possibility of completing some of the original excavation work to make the site safe for public access. The plans were approved in 1993 and the site was purchased by the Commune de Helfaut. The following year, the Conseil Général du Pas-de-Calais acquired the site. The 69-million-franc project (£7.5 million at 1997 prices) was largely underwritten by the Conseil Général, which provided 35 million francs, with another 17 million coming from the regional council. The European Union provided a further 12 million, the French State provided 3 million and the Saint-Omer municipal administration funded the remaining 1 million francs; a number of private shareholders were also involved. The Societé d&#x27;Equipement du Pas-de-Calais was contracted to carry out the development work, which involved excavating a further two metres (six feet) beneath the dome, clearing out and completing the unfinished concreting of some of the tunnels, building an exhibition centre and car park in the quarry floor and installing a lift to carry visitors up from the octagon to the dome.
The museum opened in May 1997. Visitors enter and leave through the &quot;Ida&quot; railway tunnel, though the rails have been removed and the floor levelled. Short branch tunnels lead off on either side; originally used for storage, they now display wartime objects. Headphone stands along the way present multi-lingual accounts of the construction and purpose of the facility. The tour continues along the &quot;Mathilde&quot; tunnel to reach a lift that has been installed to bring visitors up to the space beneath the dome, where the main exhibition area is located. Focusing on the story of the V-weapons, life in occupied France, and the conquest of space after the war, the tour presents audio-visual displays in English, French, Dutch and German. The museum houses a large number of original artifacts including a V-1 provided by London&#x27;s Science Museum and a V-2 provided by the Smithsonian Institution, and incorporates a memorial to the 8,000 people who were shot in or deported from the Nord-Pas-de-Calais region during the war; computer terminals track the paths of several hundred of the deportees. In 2011, the museum welcomed 120,000 visitors. In July 2012, the museum opened a planetarium as part of Cerendac, a newly established &quot;Centre de ressources numériques pour le développement de l&#x27;accès à la connaissance&quot; (Resource Centre for the development of digital access to knowledge). The €6 million centre is funded by the Pas-de-Calais &quot;department&quot;, the Nord-Pas-de-Calais region, the French state, the European Union and the intercommunality of Saint-Omer. Since 2010, the museum has also managed the V-3 site of the Fortress of Mimoyecques.

<doc id="801693" wikidata="Q757983" url="?curid=801693" title="California State Route 87">
<text>State Route 87 (SR 87), known as the Guadalupe Freeway or referred to by the locals as Highway 87, is a north–south state highway in San Jose, California, United States. Before being upgraded to a freeway, it was Guadalupe Parkway (and some signs still refer to it that way).

For most of its length, especially in Downtown San Jose, the highway follows the course of the Guadalupe River. Its southern terminus is at SR 85, and its northern terminus is at U.S. Route 101 (US 101) just north of San Jose International Airport. Unusually, it crosses over Interstate 880 (I-880) without an interchange.

==Route description==


The route is almost entirely within the city of San Jose, California. A very small portion between the Curtner Avenue exit and the Capitol Expressway Auto Mall exit is in unincorporated Santa Clara County.

SR 87 initially had 2 lanes in each direction for its entire length. Carpool lanes were added north of Taylor Street in 2005 and the remainder of the freeway in 2007.

SR 87 begins at SR 85 in southern San Jose. VTA light-rails run parallel to this freeway from SR 85 to I-280. After intersecting CR G21, SR 87 runs through a small pass in Communications Hill. SR 87 intersects I-280 in southwestern Downtown San Jose, then runs parallel to the western border of Downtown San Jose. SR 87 then runs east of the Mineta San Jose International Airport before terminating at US 101 in northwestern San Jose. This route is unconstructed from US 101 to SR 237 in Santa Clara, legislatively defined to run north from US 101 through suburban San Jose and Santa Clara, terminating at SR 237, as this route is defined as &quot;(a) Route 85 in the vicinity of Santa Teresa Boulevard to Route 101 in the vicinity of Guadalupe River&quot; and &quot;(b) San Jose easterly of Route 101 to Route 237&quot;.

SR 87 is part of the California Freeway and Expressway System, and is part of the National Highway System, a network of highways that are considered essential to the country&#x27;s economy, defense, and mobility by the Federal Highway Administration. In 2014, SR 87 had an annual average daily traffic (AADT) of 88,000 at US 101, and 176,000 between I-280 and CR G8, the latter of which was the highest AADT for the highway.

===I-880 Overcrossing===
Unusually, SR 87 crosses above I-880 without an interchange. Located between Taylor Street and Skyport Drive, the site where the two freeways cross has two restrictions that prevent the construction of any connecting ramps. First, because of its proximity to the runways at San Jose International Airport, any elevated ramps running above the SR 87 mainline would interfere with flight paths. Second, tunneling underneath would leave a significant environmental impact on the nearby Guadalupe River. Drivers from SR 87 to I-880 and vice versa have to use First Street, Taylor Street, and Coleman Avenue to get on the freeways.

==SR 87 Bikeway==
The SR 87 Bikeway is a pedestrian and bicycle path that runs alongside portions of SR 87. The path was constructed by Caltrans as part of the final phase of the SR 87 project. It opened to the public on September 1, 1993. The north end of this path is at Willow Street (north of the Alma Street exit). The south end is at the 87-85 interchange.

Along this route, the path runs along the east side of the freeway. The path diverges from the freeway for near Capitol Expressway, running along city streets near the highway. To make this connection in the northbound direction, travel north on Narvaez Avenue.

The path diverges again from the freeway for near Curtner Avenue running along city streets near the highway. To make this connection in the northbound direction, travel west on Carol Drive under the highway, head north on Canoas Garden Avenue, head northeast on Curtner Avenue, head northwest on Unified Way, and enter the bikeway at the first driveway on the right.

===Connections to the SR 87 Bikeway===
The SR 87 Bikeway provides a connection between the two segments of the Guadalupe River Trail. From the northern terminus of the upper (southern) segment of the Guadalupe River Trail, go east on Chynoweth Avenue, cross to the north side of street at Pearl Avenue, cross under Highway 87 and enter the Highway 87 Bikeway.

From the northern terminus of the Highway 87 Bikeway at Willow Street, immediately cross Willow Street. Cross under the railroad tracks and turn north on Mclellan Avenue. Turn east on Edwards Avenue then north on Harliss Avenue. Turn west on West Virginia Ave. After a short distance the entrance to western bank trail of the lower (northern) segment of the Guadalupe River Trail will be on the north side of the street. The entrance to the eastern bank trail is on Palm Street, just to the north of West Virginia Avenue.

This path also provides connections to the Three Creeks Trail and the Los Gatos Creek Trail as well as four light rail stops at Tamien Station, Curtner station, Capitol station and Branham station.

==History==
A Guadalupe Parkway connection between Downtown San Jose and the present day US 101 had existed since the early 1960s; the road channeled traffic between the Bayshore Freeway and ramps that connected directly to Market Street. However, construction on a freeway over the same path and southward beyond Downtown began a decade later and stretched across 30 years.

The first stage of the SR 87 freeway, its 4-level interchange with I-280, replaced an old downtown neighborhood in the mid 1960s. A ramp to Julian Street, north of the interchange with I-280, was completed in the mid-1970s. The freeway extension north to Taylor Street was completed in May 1988. The southern part, from I-280 to SR 85, was opened to Almaden Expressway in September–October 1992 and to SR 85 in August 1993, built in conjunction with the construction of a light rail line. Local-express lanes were constructed along this segment, the Northbound segment running from I-280 to Julian Street and the Southbound extension from I-280 to Alma Avenue. At SR 87&#x27;s northern terminus, its 3-level interchange with Highway 101 and North First Street was completed in 1992. Finally, with all grade-level intersections replaced by grade separations, construction of the six-lane freeway between Taylor Street and the Highway 101/North First interchange began in the late 1990s was completed in 2004, and the name Guadalupe Parkway stopped being used (except on some signs). The final ramps at the Skyport interchange opened in 2005. The widening of the southern segment, from Taylor Street to Highway 85, to six lanes was completed in 2007. In each direction, two lanes are for regular traffic and one lane is an HOV lane.

The right-of-way for SR 87 south of I-280 includes two tracks for the Blue Line of the VTA light rail system. Stations are accessible from the streets via staircases and elevators. Beyond 87&#x27;s terminus, the line continues southeastward in the median of SR 85.
SR 87, as once defined legislatively, would have extended from its current northern terminus, skirting the edge of San Francisco Bay as the Bayfront Freeway to San Francisco. This would have provided an eastern bypass to US 101 along the Peninsula (US 101 itself being originally a bypass to El Camino Real along the Peninsula). The route would have ended at SR 480 (the Embarcadero Freeway) practically underneath the Bay Bridge, and it would also have connected to the approaches of the unconstructed San Francisco Bay Southern Crossing. Along with SR 61, a similar project on the eastern shore of the Bay, this portion of SR 87 was abandoned due to local opposition to the project that would have destroyed a nearly pristine wildlife habitat. In 1980, the route was truncated to end at SR 237.

A resolution of the state legislature in 2007 named a section of this highway (between I-280 and Julian Street/Santa Clara Street) the Lewis E. Platt Memorial Highway (honoring the late chairman, president and chief executive officer of Hewlett-Packard who successful campaigned for local ballots to fund transportation improvements), and required that signage be paid by private donations.

==Future==
The high-occupancy vehicle (HOV) lanes on SR 87 are proposed to be converted into high-occupancy toll lanes. Caltrans&#x27; post-25 year concept also proposes an additional express lane in each direction.

<text>The United States Senate Select Committee on Intelligence (sometimes referred to as the Intelligence Committee or SSCI) is dedicated to overseeing the United States Intelligence Community—the agencies and bureaus of the federal government of the United States that provide information and analysis for leaders of the executive and legislative branches. The Committee was established in 1976 by the 94th Congress.

The Committee is &quot;select&quot; in that membership is temporary and rotated among members of the chamber. The committee comprises 15 members. Eight of those seats are reserved for one majority and one minority member of each of the following committees: Appropriations, Armed Services, Foreign Relations, and Judiciary. Of the remaining seven, four are members of the majority, and three are members of the minority. In addition, the Majority Leader and Minority Leader are non-voting &quot;ex officio&quot; members of the committee. Also, the Chairman and Ranking Member of the Committee on Armed Services (if not already a member of the select Committee) are &quot;ex officio&quot; members.

As part of its oversight responsibilities, the Committee performs an annual review of the intelligence budget submitted by the president and prepares legislation authorizing appropriations for the various civilian and military agencies and departments comprising the intelligence community. These entities include the Office of the Director of National Intelligence, Central Intelligence Agency, Defense Intelligence Agency, National Security Agency, National Geospatial-Intelligence Agency, National Reconnaissance Office, as well as the intelligence-related components of Department of State, Federal Bureau of Investigation, Department of the Treasury, and Department of Energy.

The Committee makes recommendations to the Senate Armed Services Committee on authorizations for the intelligence-related components of the U.S. Army, U.S. Navy, U.S. Air Force, and U.S. Marine Corps. The Committee also conducts periodic investigations, audits, and inspections of intelligence activities and programs. 

==History==
The Select Committee on Intelligence was preceded by the Church Committee (1975). Senator Daniel K. Inouye (D-Hawaii) became the first chairman of the committee when it was established and remained in the role until 1979.

On July 8, 2004, the committee issued the &quot;Report of the Select Committee on Intelligence on the U.S. Intelligence Community&#x27;s Prewar Intelligence Assessments on Iraq&quot;, and on June 5, 2008, it issued a long-delayed portion of its &quot;phase two&quot; investigative report, which compared the prewar public statements made by top Bush administration officials to justify the invasion with the intelligence information that was available to them at that time.

In a March 6, 2008, letter to the Senate leadership, 14 of the 15 then members of the Committee proposed the creation of a new Senate Appropriations Subcommittee on Intelligence to prepare the annual intelligence budget. The proposed Subcommittee, on which members of the Intelligence Committee would be heavily represented, would increase the Committee&#x27;s influence and leverage over executive branch intelligence agencies, and require continuing disclosure of the annual budget for the National Intelligence Program. The proposal has been opposed by the leadership of the Senate Appropriations Committee, however.

In 2013, and beyond, the SSCI received renewed attention in the wake of Edward Snowden&#x27;s disclosures regarding the NSA surveillance of communications. Senator Dianne Feinstein and the SSCI made several statements on the matter, one of which was notably disputed: that the NSA tracked US citizens&#x27; locations via cellphone. Later, the SSCI Staff Director, David Grannis, claimed that the NSA did not collect cellphone location, claiming the Senator was &quot;speaking extemporaneously&quot;. The SSCI later came to prominence in relation to voting to publish in March 2014 and then publishing in December 2014 of a report on the policies of the CIA on torture.

In 2017, the SSCI began investigating Russian interference in the 2016 United States elections, possible incriminating links between members of the Russian government and members of Donald Trump&#x27;s presidential campaign team, and the security of election processes in the United States. On April 21, 2020, the SSCI (chaired at the time by the Republican Richard Burr) released a much redacted report with its final judgment that the intelligence community&#x27;s assessment was &quot;coherent and well-constructed&quot;; the SSCI therefore supports the intelligence community&#x27;s claim that Putin&#x27;s &quot;interference in the 2016 U.S. presidential election&quot; in favor of candidate Trump was unprecedented in its &quot;manner and aggressiveness&quot;. Nevertheless, no direct evidence of collusion between the Trump campaign and Russia was found.

In 2018, the SSCI Director of Security James Wolfe was arrested and convicted of lying to the FBI on the leak of classified documents to a reporter with whom he was in an affair.

On May 14, 2020, Senator Burr, who oversaw the probe on Russian interference in the 2016 election, stepped down as SSCI chair due to an ongoing investigation regarding insider trading by Senator Burr during the COVID-19 pandemic. Senator McConnell announced on May 18, 2020 that Marco Rubio would replace Burr temporarily.

<doc id="801710" wikidata="Q493046" url="?curid=801710" title="California State Route 37">
<text>State Route 37 (SR 37) is a state highway in the U.S. state of California that runs along the northern shore of San Pablo Bay. It serves as a vital connection in the North Bay region of the San Francisco Bay Area, running from U.S. Route 101 in Novato, through northeastern Marin County, and the southern tips of both Sonoma and Solano Counties to Interstate 80 in Vallejo. Sonoma Raceway and Six Flags Discovery Kingdom are accessible from Highway 37.

The section of Highway 37 between Sears Point and Vallejo was the Sears Point Toll Road, a toll road managed by Golden Gate Ferry, before it was purchased by the State in 1938. The highway has been proposed to be built to freeway standards since the early 1950s. However, the proposal was met with many economic and environmental obstacles, making the task all but impossible for much of the route. The route is plagued by flooding which can be exacerbated by levee breaks near Vallejo. Most of the highway crosses a marsh that is home to endangered salt marsh harvest mice. A section of highway was once known as &quot;Blood Alley&quot; for its high rate of fatal accidents. A concrete barrier built in the 1990s eliminated those fatal head-on collisions. By 2022, there have been proposals to reinstate tolls between Sears Point and Vallejo to help pay for flooding and other improvements.

== Route description ==


Intended to run from State Route 251, a highway that has not been constructed, SR 37 begins in Novato with a junction at U.S. Route 101 and heads northeast as a freeway for about a quarter mile before becoming a four-lane expressway. The route passes over the Petaluma River into Sonoma County before meeting the southern terminus of State Route 121 at a signal-controlled intersection near Sears Point and the Sonoma Raceway.

The route continues as a divided two-lane expressway in a more easterly, then southeasterly, direction as it crosses Tolay Creek and proceeds through the Napa Sonoma Marsh at the northern edge of San Pablo Bay. Before the construction of the barrier in 1995, this portion of SR 37 was three lanes with the middle lane alternately serving as a passing lane for each direction. This stretch of highway was given the nickname of &quot;Blood Alley&quot; for its high-rate of fatal accidents. With the middle lane removed, accidents dropped dramatically.

SR 37 becomes a four-lane freeway on Mare Island, approaching northern Vallejo. After it crosses over the Napa River Bridge, it continues as a freeway, overlapping the old highway alignment and passing north of the old road known as Marine World Parkway (due to its proximity to the Six Flags Discovery Kingdom, previously known as Marine World). SR 37 travels in a northeasterly direction along the White Slough before turning east as it crosses over State Route 29 and heads to its eastern terminus at I-80 as the James Capoot Memorial Highway (honoring a Vallejo police officer who was killed in the line of duty). In the early 1990s, the stretch between Fairgrounds Drive, which serves as the entrance to Discovery Kingdom, and Mini Drive was upgraded to a freeway. In 2004 and 2005, following over fifty years of complications, the remaining non-freeway section in Vallejo was upgraded as well.

SR 37 is also known as Randy Bolt Memorial Highway from SR 29 to Skaggs Road (honoring a California Department of Justice agent who was killed in the line of duty in an accident along SR 37), and Sears Point Toll Road, which was originally a toll road that ran from SR 121 to Vallejo. SR 37 is part of the California Freeway and Expressway System, but is not part of the National Highway System, a network of highways that are considered essential to the country&#x27;s economy, defense, and mobility by the Federal Highway Administration. SR 37 is eligible for the State Scenic Highway System, but it is not officially designated as a scenic highway by the California Department of Transportation.

== History ==
The stretch of road east of Sears Point was once part of the historical El Camino Real. As a result of the State Highways Acts of the early 20th century, the Black Point Cut-off was built over it and opened to traffic in 1917. This highway followed the current alignment east of Sears Point, before diverting northeast along present-day Route 121. It was first designated Legislative Route 8 (LRN 8), later being signed as State Route 37.

Prior to being under State control, the section between Sears Point and Vallejo was known as the Sears Point Toll Road, a toll road managed by Golden Gate Ferry that was built over an ancient Native American trail. When it was purchased by the State in 1938, tolls were removed; it then became signed as State Route 48 until 1964.

Route 37 was redefined in the 1964 state highway renumbering as a route starting at SR 251, then SR 17, near Nicasio and ending at I-80 near Lake Chabot. The whole of SR 37 has been proposed to be built to freeway standards since the early 1950s. However, the proposal was met with many economic and environmental obstacles, making the task all but impossible for much of the route.

=== Sears Point Toll Road ===

As late as 1926, Golden Gate Ferries, owners of the Sears Point Toll Road Co., began plans to build the Sears Point Toll Road, with a contract awarded to Oakland-based Hutchinson Company in October 1927. The paved toll road was to be built on top of an ancient Native American trail along the San Pablo Bay shore between the Sacramento Highway and the Black Point cut-off (LRN 8) near Sears Point. It was expected to cost $775,000USD, with a toll not exceeding $0.35. Toll road officials explained the purpose of the road; to stimulate motor vehicle usage by reducing the commute times and expenses of motorists traveling from the East Bay and Sacramento areas by offering a more direct route toward Marin, Sonoma and the Redwood Highway. The road opened for traffic in 1928.

On November 29, 1932, the California State Highway Commission received a recommendation to purchase the road and was able to invest $418,000USD by 1936. However, the U.S. Navy owned rights to the right-of-way of part of the route, and opposed the purchase. This resulted in congressional actions to establish a clear title deed for the route. House Representative Richard J. Welch was one of the earliest government officials to pressure the State of California to acquire the toll road in order to convert it into a toll-free highway. He argued that having only one toll road to travel in order to reach the Golden Gate Bridge would benefit commuters; he also cited the ten and seventh-tenths-mile difference in distance between the toll road and a route through Napa. A Navy Department deed permitting the State to purchase the road was granted by the Attorney General on October 26, 1938. The highway then became signed as State Route 48 until the 1964 renumbering.

=== Highway upgrading in Vallejo ===

By 1955, talks began about upgrading the highway. After a proposition to turn much of the route into a toll road failed, it was decided a four-lane freeway would be the best decision. However, opposition from residents in surrounding neighborhoods as well as a federal oil embargo only allowed widening of the approach between Fairgrounds Drive and I-80. In 1977, a levee broke and flooded a portion of the developed land, turning it into protected wetlands that is home to endangered species. Because of its new status, environmental studies were needed in order to continue the project.

Soon after, the project was split into different phases to handle problems with particular areas. It was first divided between the newly created marshlands and the section between SR 29 (Sonoma Boulevard) and I-80. With Marine World being relocated, the city was able to the widen the latter section and build an overpass across Fairgrounds Drive in 1992.

=== &quot;Blood Alley&quot; ===
While the Vallejo section of SR 37 was being updated, another problem with the route would hinder its progress. The section between Sears Point and Mare Island was plagued with fatal accidents, earning its nickname of &quot;Blood Alley&quot;. Between 1966 and 1970, 27 people lost their lives on it. In a preliminary effort to reduce the fatalities, officials established both a daylight test section, requiring all cars to keep their headlights on during the day, and passing lanes. However, these efforts were ineffective.

In 1993, local resident Jim Poulos campaigned to have a barrier erected after the death of his 18-year-old son, Frankie, on &quot;Blood Alley&quot;. At this time, the situation with this stretch only worsened as the death toll between 1990 and 1996 rose to thirty-one. At first, Caltrans thought the barrier would make matters worse since it would be difficult for emergency vehicles to attend to accidents; environmental issues were also cited. Caltrans was waiting for the ability to create a causeway to span the area instead. Poulos continued his campaign despite opposition, and was granted the barrier in 1995. The barrier was not built without controversy, as it also eliminated the passing lanes. However, since the barriers were built, there were no longer any crossover accidents as of 2005.

While the median was built, a few problems needed to be resolved in order for the road to work both safely and in an environmentally friendly way. Emergency personnel needed to quickly access accidents and provide them easy transport to nearby hospitals. To alleviate this problem, Caltrans implemented electric gate technology, which would allow emergency vehicles to cut through certain parts of the median. The other problem was to both protect the plant life and the salt marsh harvest mice residing around the highway. As a result, crews placed timbers and sheeting to protect foliage, and added holes into the median barrier to allow the mice to cross the highway.

=== White Slough and Sonoma Boulevard interchange ===
To protect White Slough while still allowing the widening of SR 37, the White Slough Protection and Development Act was passed in 1990. It allowed up to 13 acres of wetlands to be filled but required at least four times as much wetland restoration elsewhere in the Bay Area.

After environmental studies on the White Slough, Caltrans widened and elevated that section of the road and converted it to a freeway. To accommodate bicycles and pedestrians, a cycleway was built along the eastbound side of the freeway. Finally, Caltrans completed the overpass which crossed SR 29, Broadway, and Mini Drive (bypassing Marine World Parkway, three traffic signaled intersections, and a railroad grade crossing). The project was completed in the summer of 2005, and fully open to traffic on August 20.

===2019 flooding===
The highway is increasingly subject to flooding as the route is near sea level. The road was closed for a total of 28 days during the winter of 2016-17.

On the morning of Friday February 15, 2019, the westernmost portion of the westbound highway (between Atherton Ave. and U.S. Route 101) was closed due to flooding caused by a levee break. Marin County declared a state of emergency, and public works crews worked 24 hours a day pumping water and repairing the levee. It was expected to be closed for at least a week, however the highway fully reopened on the morning of Wednesday, February 20, 2019.

===Future===
In 2017, it was estimated that it would cost $4 billion to fix all the flooding, traffic, and other issues along the corridor, and based on transportation funding levels it would take until 2088 to come up with that amount of money.

In 2022, California State Senator Bill Dodd introduced new legislation that would make the route a toll road again between Sears Point and at least Mare Island. The proposed law would use the toll revenues to help pay for the flooding and traffic improvements. It has been opposed by a number of commuters, particular Solano county residents who commute west to jobs in Sonoma or Marin counties. In May 2023, the California Transportation Commission unanimously approved a plan to toll both directions, as well as widen the highway from a two-lane road to one with carpool lanes by converting the existing shoulders. The proposed toll in each direction would be half of the toll on the seven state-owned Bay Area bridges operated by the Bay Area Toll Authority. Toll collection would not begin until the new carpool lanes are completed, regular bus service along the highway&#x27;s corridor is established, and a toll discount program for low income users is established. 
==Major intersections==

Exits on the westernmost portion of the route are unnumbered.






== Popular culture ==
Train&#x27;s 2012 album &quot;California 37&quot; is named after State Route 37, with the album cover prominently featuring the route&#x27;s highway shield.

AFI released a song titled &quot;Rabbits Are Roadkill on Rt. 37&quot; on its 2006 album &quot;Decemberunderground&quot;.

<doc id="801716" wikidata="Q1366827" url="?curid=801716" title="Tallboy (bomb)">
<text>Tallboy or Bomb, Medium Capacity, 12,000 lb was an earthquake bomb developed by the British aeronautical engineer Barnes Wallis and used by the Royal Air Force (RAF) during the Second World War.

At , it could be carried only by a modified model of the Avro Lancaster heavy bomber. It proved to be effective against large, fortified structures where conventional bombing had proved ineffective.

==History==
Wallis presented his ideas for a 10-ton bomb in his 1941 paper &quot;A Note on a Method of Attacking the Axis Powers&quot;, which showed that a very large bomb exploding deep underground next to a target would transmit the shock into the foundations of the target, particularly since shock waves are transmitted through the ground more strongly than through air.

Wallis designed the &quot;Victory Bomber&quot; of , which would fly at at to carry the heavy bomb over , but the Air Ministry opposed a single-bomb aircraft, and the idea was not pursued after 1942.

The design and production of Tallboy was undertaken without a contract on the initiative of the Ministry, following Wallis&#x27; 1942 paper &quot;Spherical Bomb—Surface Torpedo&quot; and the design of the &quot;bouncing bomb&quot; for the Dam Busters of Operation Chastise. The RAF therefore used bombs which they had not purchased and which therefore remained the property of Vickers, the manufacturer. This situation was normalised once the weapon’s capabilities were established.

Accomplishments of the Tallboy included the 24 June 1944 Operation Crossbow attack on La Coupole which undermined the foundations of the V-2 assembly bunker, and a Tallboy attack on the Saumur tunnel on 8–9 June 1944, when bombs passed straight through the hill and exploded inside the tunnel below the surface (stopping Panzer reinforcements reaching Normandy).

The last of the Kriegsmarine&#x27;s &quot;Bismarck&quot;-class battleships, the &quot;Tirpitz&quot;, was sunk by an air attack using Tallboys in Operation Catechism.

==Design==
Most large Allied, particularly British, Second World War aircraft bombs (blockbuster bombs) had very thin skins to maximize the weight of explosive that a bomber could carry. This was an improvement on the early part of the war when the explosive content of British bombs was low.
To be able to penetrate the earth (or fortified targets) without breaking apart, the casing of the Tallboy had to be strong. Each was cast in one piece of high-tensile steel that would enable it to survive the impact before detonation. At the same time, to achieve the penetration required, Wallis designed the Tallboy to be aerodynamically clean so that, when dropped from a great height, it would reach a much higher terminal velocity than traditional bomb designs.

In the final design, the No. 78 Mark I tail of the bomb was about half the overall length of the finished weapon; the bomb casing was some of the overall length. Initially, the bomb had a tendency to tumble and the tail was modified; the fins were given a slight twist so that the bomb spun as it fell. The gyroscopic effect thus generated stopped the pitching and yawing, improving aerodynamics and accuracy.

The Tallboy was designed to be dropped from an optimal altitude of at a forward speed of , hitting at . It made a crater deep and across and could go through of concrete.

The weight of the Tallboy (approximately ) and the high altitude required of the bombing aircraft meant that the Avro Lancasters used had to be specially adapted. Armour plating and even defensive armament were removed to reduce weight, and the bomb-bay doors had to be adapted.

No. 617 Squadron were trained on the Stabilizing Automatic Bomb Sight (SABS). Corrections had to be made for temperature, wind speed and other factors. The sight was effective only if the target could be clearly identified. Several missions were cancelled or unsuccessful because of this limitation.

For use on underground targets, the bomb was fitted with three separate inertia No. 58 Mark I Tail Pistols (firing mechanisms). These triggered detonation after a pre-set delay, which gave the bomb sufficient time to penetrate the target before exploding. Depending on mission requirements, the time delay could be set to 30 seconds or 30 minutes after impact.

To guarantee detonation, three Type 47 long delay fuzes were fitted inside the rear of the bomb. This dramatically improved reliability of the weapon; even if two of the fuzes failed, the third would trigger detonation. At least 2 Tallboys failed to explode, one during the second attack on the Sorpe dam; it was found during repairs in late 1958 when the reservoir was emptied, and a second was found in Świnoujście in Poland (formerly Swinemünde) in 2020. This second bomb detonated in October 2020 while being remotely defused.

The bomb was aimed at the target during an operation and proved capable of penetrating deep into hardened reinforced concrete when it hit. This, however, was not the primary intention of Barnes Wallis&#x27;s design. The bomb was designed to make impact close to the target, penetrate the soil or rock beneath or around the target, and then detonate, transferring all of its energy into the structure, or creating a camouflet (cavern or crater) into which the target would fall.

This &#x27;earthquake&#x27; effect caused more damage than even a direct hit that penetrated the armour of a target, since even a burst inside a bunker would only damage the surroundings, with the blast dissipating rapidly through the air. An earthquake impact shook the whole target and caused structural damage to all parts of it, making repair uneconomic.

An alternative technique was to arrange detonation depth so that the crater broke the surface—useful for attacking railway marshalling yards and similar targets. The Tallboy produced a crater with depths up to , unlike conventional bombs which would produce many shallow craters across a target—each one of which could later be filled in rapidly with earth-moving equipment. Such a huge hole was time-consuming to fill; multiple trucks and bulldozers could not be fitted around the periphery of the hole to speed the process.

==Manufacturing==
Tallboys were largely hand-made, requiring much labour during each manufacturing stage. The materials used were costly, with precise engineering requirements in casting and machining. To increase penetrative power, a large, specially hardened, steel plug had to be precisely machined and mated to a recess in the nose of the bomb. The ogive had to be perfectly symmetrical to ensure optimum aerodynamic performance. This was no easy task when manipulating a bomb casing with the size and weight of a Tallboy.

The Torpex filling was poured by hand into the base of the upturned casing after melting it in &quot;kettles&quot;. The final stage of explosive filling required that a one-inch layer of pure TNT be poured over the Torpex filling, followed by sealing the base with a layer of woodmeal-wax composite with three cylindrical recesses fitted with the explosive boosters and into which three chemical time-fuses were inserted when the bomb was armed.

Tallboys were not considered expendable, and if not used on a raid were to be brought back to base rather than safely into the sea. The value of the weapon offset the additional risk to the aircrew. Given their high unit cost, Tallboys were used exclusively against high-value strategic targets that could not be destroyed by other means. When it was found that the Lancaster could be modified to carry a bomb larger than the Tallboy, Wallis produced the even larger Grand Slam bomb.

==Operations==

===June–August 1944===

* Saumur rail tunnel was the sole operational north-south route on the Loire. Nineteen Tallboy-equipped and six conventionally equipped Lancasters of 617 Squadron attacked on the night of 8/9 June 1944. 617 Squadron were guided on to the target by 83 Squadron Pathfinder Force. This was the first use of the Tallboy bomb, and the line was destroyed—one Tallboy bored through the hillside and exploded in the tunnel about below, completely blocking it. No aircraft were lost during the raid.

====Operation Crossbow====
Crossbow was the code name for measures to counter the German V-1 flying bomb (&quot;buzz bomb&quot; or &quot;doodlebug&quot;) and V-2 rocket weapons. Tallboys were used by the British to destroy several missile sites.

19 June 1944 – Watten
* The nearest Tallboy dropped by 617 Squadron landed from the target, a heavily fortified V-2 launch site under construction The bunker was rendered useless.

24 June 1944 – Wizernes
* The target was a V-2 assembly and launch site linked with the Watten site. Several Tallboy hits undermined the foundations but did not penetrate the dome. The bunker was abandoned.

25 June 1944 – Siracourt V-1 bunker
* Lancasters of 617 Squadron scored three direct hits with Tallboys without loss.

4 July 1944 – Saint-Leu-d&#x27;Esserent
* 617 Squadron used seventeen Lancasters with Tallboys, supported by one Mosquito and one Mustang, in an attempt to collapse the limestone roof of the caves used as storage depots. Aircraft from No 5 Group followed up with bombs.
6 July 1944 – Mimoyecques

* Attack on V-weapon targets. Damage was unknown at the time, and efforts continued. In September, allied ground forces found galleries blocked with earth and debris where Tallboys had hit one of the shafts. The V-weapon was revealed to be the V-3 cannon.

17 July 1944 – Wizernes
* 16 Lancasters, led by a Mosquito and a Mustang, bombed &quot;Wizernes&quot; – three Lancasters managed to drop Tallboys (one caused the dome to shift out of alignment, two others blocked the entrance).

27 July 1944 – Watten
* One Tallboy hit the target but did not penetrate the structure.

31 July 1944 – Rilly La Montagne
* Both ends of the railway tunnel were collapsed by Tallboys dropped by 617 Squadron. William Reid&#x27;s Lancaster at was hit by a &#x27;friendly&#x27; Tallboy dropped from .

====Sorties against German dockyards====
Shipping in the English Channel and the Atlantic Ocean were threatened by U-boats and E-boats stationed in France. U-boat docks were protected against conventional aerial bombardment by thick concrete roofs.

14 June 1944 – Le Havre
* Part of the first massive RAF daylight raid since the end of May 1943, two waves attacked E-boat facilities at Le Havre: No 1 Group first, No 3 Group second. Just before the first wave, 22 Lancasters of 617 Squadron and 3 Mosquito marker aircraft attacked, several hits were scored on the pens, one bomb penetrated the roof.

15 June 1944 – Boulogne harbour
* 297 aircraft: 155 Lancasters, 130 Halifaxes, 12 Mosquitos, of Nos 1, 4, 5, 6 and 8 Groups attacked Boulogne harbour. One Halifax was lost. A French report described the great destruction as the worst raid on Boulogne. During the raid 22 Lancasters of No. 617 squadron bombed the E-boat pens with Tallboys. Due to cloud cover ten planes returned to base with their bombs. However, the raid was considered a success as the E-boats retired to IJmuiden on the Dutch coast, where they were better protected but less able to interfere with Allied naval traffic supporting the Normandy invasion.

5 August 1944 – Brest
* 15 Lancasters of 617 Squadron attacked the U-boat pens at Brest and scored six direct hits with Tallboys, penetrating the concrete roofs. One Lancaster was shot down by flak. Subsequent attempts to reinforce other sites with even thicker concrete diverted resources from other projects.

6 August 1944 – Keroman
* Flight Lieutenant Thomas Clifford Iveson dropped one Tallboy, bomb failed to penetrate base.

7 August 1944 – Lorient
* The planned Tallboy mission against the U-boat pens was cancelled. Instead Keroman Submarine Base was the primary target.

8 August 1944 – La Pallice
* Flight Lieutenant Thomas Iveson dropped one Tallboy.

28 August 1944 – IJmuiden
* Iveson dropped one Tallboy.

===September–November 1944===
23/24 September 1944 – Dortmund-Ems Canal near Ladbergen, north of Münster
* During the night attack 617 Squadron scored six direct hits with Tallboys.

7 October 1944 – north of Basel
* The dam waters could have been kept in reserve to flood the area of a US advance. The Dambusters destroyed the lock gates with Tallboys dropped at low level, releasing the stored water.

15 October 1944 – Sorpe dam
* Target of the original Dambusters raid survived a second attack by 9 Squadron (617 Squadron did not participate in this raid). The Tallboy bombs were seen to hit the dam but did not breach it.

====Raids on &quot;Tirpitz&quot;====
The German battleship Tirpitz was a threat against convoys sailing to and from the Soviet Union.

15 September 1944 – (Operation Paravane)
* One Tallboy hit near the bow of the &quot;Tirpitz&quot;, passing through the foredeck and hull, and exploded in the water on the starboard side of her bow. The blast wrecked the bow, and left the battleship&#x27;s forward compartments flooded with 2,000 tons of water. The explosions of several other Tallboys in the water near &quot;Tirpitz&quot; also buckled some of her hull plates and bulkheads. Five men were killed and fifteen wounded. &quot;Tirpitz&quot; was rendered unseaworthy, and the damage was assessed as needing nine months&#x27; worth of work to repair, but this was considered unfeasible, so the battleship was relegated to a floating artillery battery.

29 October 1944 – (Operation Obviate)
* Due to cloud coming in just before the attack, 32 bombs were dropped &quot;blind&quot;. No direct hits were scored but one near miss bent a propeller shaft.

12 November 1944 – (Operation Catechism)
* In the final operation the &quot;Tirpitz&quot; was sunk by three Tallboys hits, and several others fell close by. Several bombs landed within the anti-torpedo net barrier and caused significant cratering of the seabed, removing much of the sandbank that had been constructed to prevent the ship from capsizing. One bomb penetrated the ship&#x27;s deck between turrets Anton and Bruno but failed to explode. A second hit amidships between the aircraft catapult and the funnel, completely destroying the entire section of belt armour abreast of the bomb hit and blowing a very large hole in the ship&#x27;s side and bottom, causing significant flooding and a port list to 60 degrees. A third bomb struck the ship on the port side of turret Caesar, eventually leading to a magazine explosion that caused the ship to capsize.

===December 1944 – April 1945===

Bombing of U-boat pens, December 1944 – April 1945

8 December, 11 December 1944
* Urft Dam, ( southwest of Cologne) was attacked to prevent it being used to flood the area as American troops advanced. The lip of the dam was damaged, but the Germans prevented further damage by lowering the water level.

15 December 1944 – IJmuiden on the Dutch coast,
* 617 Squadron attacked E-boat pens with Tallboys. A smokescreen hindered the bombing, and the results went unseen.

21 December 1944 – Politz
* 617 Squadron.

12 January 1945 – Bergen
* 32 Lancasters and one Mosquito of Nos 9 and 617 Squadrons attacked U-boat pens and shipping in Bergen harbour. Three Lancasters of 617 Squadron and one from 9 Squadron were lost; the Germans told the local people that 11 bombers had been shot down. A local report said that three Tallboys penetrated the roof of the pens and caused severe damage to workshops, offices and stores inside&quot;.

3 February 1945 – IJmuiden &amp; 
* 36 Lancasters of No 5 Group attacked U-boat pens at IJmuiden (9 Squadron) and Poortershaven (617 Squadron) with Tallboys. Hits were claimed on both targets without loss.

14 March 1945 – Bielefeld and Arnsberg viaducts
* The viaducts were attacked by 617 and 9 squadrons with Tallboys and the first Grand Slams. The Arnsberg viaduct withstood the attack but of the Bielefeld viaduct collapsed through the &#x27;earthquake effect&#x27; of the Grand Slams and Tallboys.

15 March 1945 – Arnsberg viaduct
* Arnsberg viaduct was attacked again by 9 Squadron. It did not collapse.

9 April 1945 – Hamburg
* 617 Squadron attacked with Tallboys and Grand Slams. Some of the bombs hit their target and no aircraft were lost.

9 April 1945 – pocket battleship &quot;Admiral Scheer&quot;
* &quot;Admiral Scheer&quot; was attacked by RAF bombers equipped with Tallboys when she was docked in Kiel. 5 Tallboys hit her and she capsized in the harbor. 

16 April 1945 – heavy cruiser &quot;Lützow&quot;
* &quot;Lützow&quot; was attacked by 617 Squadron. Despite intense flak, 15 aircraft managed to bomb the target with Tallboys or with bombs. One near miss with a Tallboy tore a large hole in the bottom of the &quot;Lützow&quot; and she settled to the bottom in shallow water. One Lancaster was shot down, the Squadron&#x27;s last loss of the war. One of the bombs remained sunk near Świnoujście in the middle of main shipping Piast Canal for 74 years, unearthed during the preparatory works for deepening of the Świnoujście-Szczecin fairway in September 2019. Operations to defuse and remove it were undertaken in October 2020. It exploded during defusing, but without causing any injuries.

18 April 1945 – Heligoland
* 969 aircraft: 617 Lancasters, 332 Halifaxes and 20 Mosquitos of all groups bombed the naval base, airfield and town &quot;almost into crater-pitted moonscapes&quot;. Three Halifaxes were lost; the islands were evacuated the following night.

19 April 1945 – Heligoland
* 36 Lancasters used Tallboy bombs against coastal positions.

25 April 1945 – Berghof
* Hitler&#x27;s vacation home, the Berghof, near Berchtesgaden was attacked with a mixed force that included six Lancasters of 617 Squadron dropping their last Tallboys. The bombing appeared to be accurate and effective.

==Postwar==
The last of the V bombers, the Handley Page Victor, was designed to be able to carry a bomb load that could include a load of two Tallboys internally, or one Grand Slam plus assorted smaller weapons.

===Unexploded ordnance===
In December 1958, a Tallboy was found during renovation works on the Sorpe Dam, Germany. On 6 January 1959, the bomb was defused by a German and British crew of demining officers.&lt;br&gt;

In September 2019, a Tallboy bomb was found in the Piast Canal in northwest Poland near the town of Świnoujście and scheduled for defusing. The bomb had been dropped in the April 1945 attack on the &quot;Lützow&quot;, a German cruiser. In October 2020, the Tallboy detonated during a deflagration operation, but there were no reported injuries to divers nor any damage to the port infrastructure from the underwater explosion.

==United States use==
The T-10 was an American-made version of the Tallboy modified to use standard American components. Development was started in late 1944 and plans were made to drop them on the island strongholds of the Pacific to aid in softening their defences before amphibious assaults. No bombs were used operationally since the capitulation of Japan following the atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki negated their need. In the late 1950s the T-10 was re-designated the M-121. During the Korean War a number of T-10s were converted to the radio-guided Tarzon bomb and were dropped by Boeing B-29 Superfortresses to destroy railroad bridges and reservoir dams.

After the Korean War ended and the B-29 and B-36 bombers were retired, the United States Air Force no longer had an aircraft that could drop the M-121, and the bombs were put in storage. Production of the T-10 ended in 1955. The B-36 was the last operational aircraft that could drop a fully assembled Tallboy type bomb in the conventional way. During the Vietnam War, some M-121s, minus their rear streamlined shrouds and tail fin assemblies, were shipped to Vietnam for Commando Vault missions where the warheads were incorporated into the BLU-82 weapons dropped by C-130s using radar control in order to clear a helicopter landing zone. The warheads were mounted on a platform and pulled by parachutes from the rear-loading ramp of C-130s. After clearing the aircraft, the large extraction chutes and pallets were cut away and small triangular chutes stabilized the large warhead until impact. A nose probe detonated the bomb at the correct stand-off distance. One of the last of the World War II Tallboy designs was dropped during a Commando Vault mission to clear a landing zone for helicopters on a ridge during the 1969 Battle of Hamburger Hill in Vietnam. Dropping from , the bomb hit exactly where it was needed. The Commando Vault missions were more accurate in bomb delivery on target than the more modern B-52s.

Work still progressed on the T-12 Cloudmaker, which could be carried by the Convair B-36A.

<text>The Navigators is a 2001 British film directed by Ken Loach with screenplay by Rob Dawber.

It tells the story of the reactions of five Sheffield rail workers to the privatisation of the railway maintenance organisation for which they all work, and the consequences for them. The film was inspired by the failure of the Connex South Central and the Connex South Eastern franchises: Connex was ultimately stripped of both franchises before the franchise period ended due to poor service and financial mismanagement.

Rob Dawber received the 2001 BAFTA award (posthumously) for &quot;New Writer&quot; for the film.

==Plot==
The film follows five railway workers – John, Paul, Mick, Gerry and Len – in a Yorkshire depot affected by the privatisation of British Rail in 1995. The men are informed by their supervisor that they are now working for a company called East Midlands Infrastructure, and are competing with rival maintenance companies.

On a maintenance job, one of the workers is sent away because his depot is now owned by a rival firm. His departure leaves the rest of the crew unable to finish the job. The railwaymen are introduced to their new managing director, Mr Hemmings, by watching a video about the &quot;age of change&quot; in Britain&#x27;s rail industry. Hemmings says that the culture will change too, and the days of a job for life are over, though new opportunities have arisen for those prepared to take the initiative. East Midlands Infrastructure is renamed Gilchrist Engineering.

Gerry argues with his boss about procedures being imposed without consultation. Management make a concession that the crew points out is no concession at all. The managing director visits the depot in person, and demands that, since &quot;the slate has been wiped clean&quot;, there must be no concessions or agreements, forcing the supposed concession to be withdrawn.

To the railwaymen&#x27;s surprise, they are ordered to destroy their old equipment with sledgehammers as it no longer meets current standards. They are interrupted with news of a derailment at Dore. There they meet a former colleague, Len, who is working for an agency and earning much more than he did with the company.

After his pay is reduced to pay for additional child support, Paul agrees to take voluntary redundancy and join an agency. John follows suit. Mick and Gerry try to talk them out of it, pointing out that they will lose any job security. However, the few remaining Gilchrist employees are soon notified that the depot is no longer competitive and will be closed. They are given twelve weeks&#x27; notice of their redundancy.

Mick visits an employment agency and discovers that, while work is available, he will receive no sickness benefits and must pay for his own transport, equipment and training. He goes to a job but the crew he joins is four men short and includes builders with no railway experience. Mick argues with the supervisor, and is given a negative report which leaves him unemployed for weeks. He finally manages to get another assignment that leads to a reunion with his former colleagues. Their happiness at working together again is marred by a passing train spewing toilet waste over them.

The men are given a job pouring a cement signal base, but they are next to an active track with no look out. After dusk, Jim is hit by a locomotive and badly injured. Since they could be barred from working for breaching safety procedures, Mick and Paul carry Jim to the side of a road so that they can claim he has been hit by a car.

Jim dies from his injuries. Gerry is now the only one of the original five remaining at Gilchrist, and his job is due to end in days.

<doc id="801728" wikidata="Q1233100" url="?curid=801728" title="Telephone numbers in France">
<text>The French telephone numbering plan is used in Metropolitan France, French overseas departments and some overseas collectivities.

Since 1996, Metropolitan France uses a ten-digit closed numbering plan, where the first two digits denote a geographic area, mobile or non-geographic number.

* 01 
* 02 Northwest France
* 03 Northeast France
* 04 Southeast France
* 05 Southwest France
* 06 Mobile phone services
* 07 Mobile phone services
* 08 Special phone numbers: Freephone () and shared-cost services.
* 09 Non-geographic number (used by Voice over IP services)

All geographic numbers are dialed in the ten-digit format, even for local calls. The international access code is the International Telecommunication Union&#x27;s recommended 00. When calling France from abroad, the leading zero should be omitted: for example, to call a number in Southwest France, one would dial +33 5 xx xx xx xx. French people usually state phone numbers as a sequence of five double-digit numbers, e.g., 0x xx xx xx xx (and not, for example, 0 xxx-xxx-xxx or 0xxx-xx-xxxx or 0xx-xxx-xxxx).

Overseas departments and collectivities have separate country codes and different number formats.

==Overseas departments and territories==
The French overseas departments ( or ) have separate country codes from metropolitan France, with Réunion being assigned the code 262 while Guadeloupe, French Guiana and Martinique were assigned the codes 590, 594 and 596 respectively. Until 1996, the use of the international access code 19 and country code was required for calls from metropolitan France. For example, to call Guadeloupe from metropolitan France, a subscriber would dial 19 590 xxx xxx, 590 being the country code. This included the islands of Saint Barthelemy and Saint Martin, which later separated from Guadeloupe to become collectivities, although they still use the same country code. By contrast, calls to metropolitan France from the overseas departments only required the use of the trunk code 16.

However, under the new present French numbering plan, direct dialing was introduced for calls between the DOMs (including ) and metropolitan France, requiring only the &#x27;0&#x27; to be dialed, with the country code being used as a geographical area code. Despite this, the 33 country code was not adopted for calls to the DOMs from the rest of the world, because of technical difficulties with operators in neighbouring countries, for example, calls to Réunion from Mauritius would have to be routed via metropolitan France, adversely affecting voice quality as well as increasing call costs.

In 2001, telephone numbers in the DOMs changed to the same ten-digit format as metropolitan France, with new prefixes beginning with the digit &#x27;6&#x27; being adopted for mobile phone services:

===Guadeloupe, Saint-Barthélemy and Saint-Martin===
From France:
*Fixed phone line: 0 590 xx xx xx
*Mobile phone line: 0 690 xx xx xx or 0 691 xx xx xx

Outside France:
*Fixed phone line: +590 590 xx xx xx 
*Mobile phone line: +590 690 xx xx xx or +590 691 xx xx xx

===French Guiana===
From France:
*Fixed phone line: 0 594 xx xx xx
*Mobile phone line: 0 694 xx xx xx
Outside France:
*Fixed phone line: +594 594 xx xx xx
*Mobile phone line: +594 694 xx xx xx

===Martinique===
From France:
*Fixed phone line: 0 596 xx xx xx
*Mobile phone line: 0 696 xx xx xx or 0 697 xx xx xx
Outside France:
*Fixed phone line: +596 596 xx xx xx
*Mobile phone line: +596 696 xx xx xx or +596 697 xx xx xx

===Réunion===
From France:
*Fixed phone line: 0 262 xx xx xx or 0 263 xx xx xx
*Mobile phone line: 0 692 xx xx xx or 0 693 xx xx xx
Outside France:
*Fixed phone line: +262 262 xx xx xx or +262 263 xx xx xx
*Mobile phone line: +262 692 xx xx xx or +262 693 xx xx xx

===Others===
Before 30 March 2007 the of Mayotte used country code +269, shared with the Comoros: 
*From France, including Mayotte: 0 269 xx xx xx
*From Comoros: xx xx xx
*Outside France and Comoros: +269 xx xx xx

On 30 March 2007 Mayotte adopted the +262 code, used by Réunion, and a new numbering range was introduced for mobile phones:
*From France:
**Fixed phone line: 0 269 xx xx xx
**Mobile phone line: 0 639 xx xx xx
*Outside France:
**Fixed phone line: +262 269 xx xx xx
**Mobile phone line: +262 639 xx xx xx

Calls to Saint Pierre and Miquelon require only &#x27;0&#x27;, country code and the subscriber&#x27;s six-digit number, e.g.: 
*From France: 0 508 xx xx xx
*Outside France: +508 xx xx xx

Calls to and from the , however, require full international dialing, hence the international access code and country code must be used:
*Paris from New Caledonia: 00 33 1 xx xx xx xx
*New Caledonia from Paris: 00 687 xx xx xx

== History ==
For many years, French subscribers&#x27; telephone numbers consisted of eight digits (including the one-digit area code 1 for all of Paris and its surrounding departments, or a two-digit area code from 20 to 99 for other metropolitan departments; this area code was dialed only after the trunk code 16). The territories of Overseas France all had their own local numbering plans and used their own country codes but no area codes, and calls between different territories or Metropolitan France required a dialing international call using the international call prefix 19 followed by the country code, area code, and subscriber number.

But that system began to run out of numbers in the 1980s, leading to the adoption of a new &quot;eight-digit&quot; numbering plan on 25 October 1985. On that date, France changed to a system of two zones, one for Paris and the surrounding &quot;Île-de-France&quot; and another for the other departments. Outside Paris, the old area code was incorporated into the subscriber&#x27;s eight-digit number; for Paris, the area code 1 was retained, and a 4 was prefixed to seven-digit numbers, meaning that a subscriber&#x27;s number could begin with 40, for example 4056 1873. For numbers in the &quot;Île-de-France&quot; surrounding Paris, the old codes 3x and 6x joined the old seven-digit numbers to become eight-digit numbers and were assigned to the Paris area code 1, with the trunk prefix 16 required for calls from the rest of France, followed by the area code 1 for Paris and the eight-digit number. To call the rest of France from Paris, however, the trunk prefix 16 had to be dialed before the eight-digit number.

On 18 October 1996, this changed to the present &quot;ten-digit&quot; system (including the default one-digit leading trunk code 0), in which each call is dialed using all ten digits, this national scheme being also extended to cover Overseas France in a single area. Area codes were abolished, and since then France has had a closed numbering plan, where all local or national calls require dialing the leading trunk code.

Following liberalisation in 1998, subscribers (first deployed on land lines and rapidly extended to all mobile networks) could access different carriers by replacing the leading trunk code 0 (omitted from numbers when called from outside France) with another carrier selection code (one digit from 2 to 9, or four digits 16xx). For example, Cegetel required subscribers to dial 7; e.g., Paris 71 xx xx xx xx, instead of 01 xx xx xx xx. Similarly, the international access code using Cegetel would be 70 instead of 00 by replacing the first 0. Since then, the carrier selection code still exists, but carrier preselection (and number portability) is offered by default on all subscriber lines, and the one-digit carrier selection is rarely used. In addition, several important national operators merged, and the four-digit carrier selection only persists for subscribers of various international service providers (most of them for mobile telephony, but these carrier selection prefixes are often dialed internally by a terminal device and callers don&#x27;t need to care about it, unless they want to select carriers for different services). Additionally, call fees no longer depend on distance in the French numbering plan, so carrier selection is used only for international calls.

The 09 prefix was introduced for non-geographic numbers and special services in September 2006 and older numbers such as 08 7x xx xx xx (used for VoIP in Internet boxes) were replaced by 09 5x xx xx xx (telephone service offered by Internet service provider Free, later followed by other French ISPs).

The national information service reached by dialing &quot;12&quot; was closed in 2005, leading to the creation of numerous new information services reached by dialing 118 xxx. They cost €3 per call, plus €3 per minute.

=== Defunct prefixes ===

Changed in 1996:
*16 - Long distance prefix - Changed to: 0
*19 - International prefix - Changed to: 00
The second dial tone was also removed. Dialing procedures now reflect ETSI and ITU recommendations.

===Andorra and Monaco===
Until 17 December 1994, Andorra formed part of the French numbering plan, with calls from France requiring the prefix 628, (or 16 628 from Paris). Those from the rest of the world were made using +33 628, except from Spain, which were made using the prefix 9738. On that date, the principality adopted the country code +376. Consequently, all calls from France to Andorra had to be dialled in international format, using the prefix 19 376. This was later changed to 00 376, along with the second French reform of 1996 to the newer &quot;ten-digit&quot; plan.

On 21 June 1996, Monaco similarly adopted its own country code +377, replacing access from France (+33 93).

<doc id="801736" wikidata="Q493280" url="?curid=801736" title="California State Route 160">
<text>State Route 160 (SR 160) is a state highway in the U.S. state of California consisting of two sections. The longer, southern, section is a scenic highway through the alluvial plain of the Sacramento River, linking SR 4 in Antioch with Sacramento via the Antioch Bridge. The northern section, separated from the southern by Sacramento city streets, is the North Sacramento Freeway, running from the 16th Street Bridge over the American River to Interstate 80 Business towards Roseville.

This northern section was deleted from the definition in the Streets and Highways Code in 2003, when the relinquished portion through downtown Sacramento was also removed, but it is still maintained and signed by the California Department of Transportation (Caltrans) as SR 160.

==Route description==

State Route 160 begins in eastern Antioch at SR 4 as a four-lane freeway. After two interchanges, the highway becomes a two-lane expressway and rises onto the Antioch Bridge over the San Joaquin River. It cuts north across the center of Sherman Island as a two-lane surface road, reaching the Sacramento River on the opposite shore. From here to Sacramento, SR 160 never strays far from the river, first following the east levee over the 1949 Three Mile Slough Bridge (a lift bridge), past Brannan Island State Recreation Area, and across SR 12 opposite the river from Rio Vista. After passing Isleton, the highway crosses the river on the Isleton Bridge, a bascule bridge built in 1923, and runs along the west shore on Grand Island, where it meets the east end of SR 220. The Walnut Grove Bridge carries County Route J11 east across the river to Walnut Grove, and, at the north end of the island, SR 160 crosses the 1924 Steamboat Slough Bridge onto Sutter Island and then the 1923 Paintersville Bridge across the Sacramento River to the mainland, both bascule bridges.

On the mainland, SR 160 once again runs atop the east levee, now 1–2 miles (1.5–3 km) west of Interstate 5. The final bridge over the river is the Freeport Bridge, which carries County Route E9 to the west levee, where it turns south to return to SR 160 at the west end of the Paintersville Bridge. About a mile (1.5 km) beyond the Freeport Bridge, SR 160 leaves the levee, enters the city of Sacramento (where state maintenance and control ends), passes under I-5, and farms give way to suburbs. Here the former SR 160 is known as Freeport Boulevard, a major surface road that passes the Sacramento Executive Airport and Sacramento City College. Freeport Boulevard turns to the northwest at about 4th Avenue. It was formerly a one-way pair with 21st Street with Freeport heading one-way southbound and 21st heading one-way northbound. The city converted these streets back to two-way streets for traffic calming purposes in 2008. After a short jog west on Broadway, former SR 160 turns north on the one-way pair of 15th (southbound) and 16th (northbound) Streets, almost immediately crossing Business 80 and entering downtown Sacramento.

15th and 16th Streets lead traffic north past the east side of the State Capitol grounds, which lie between L and N Streets. At F Street, the path of southbound SR 160 jogged west for three blocks to 12th Street; both 12th and 16th Streets pass under the Union Pacific Railroad&#x27;s Martinez Subdivision (where B Street would be) in four-lane subways, but 15th Street dead-ends. 12th Street remains a one-way southbound roadway, but the two-way SacRT light rail now occupies its east side. 12th Street turns northeast at North B Street, and the two directions of former SR 160 come together at Richards Boulevard, just south of the 16th Street Bridge over the American River and the south end of the state-maintained North Sacramento Freeway. The light rail, which crosses the river between the two directions of SR 160, soon leaves at the Del Paso Boulevard interchange as the freeway turns east. Two folded diamonds at local streets and a northbound-only entrance ramp from Tribute Road are all that remains before SR 160 merges with Business 80 at the Arden Way interchange. Interstate Business 80 is also known as the Capital City Freeway here.

The northern portion is also part of the California Freeway and Expressway System, as is the piece south of SR 12 near Rio Vista, though, of the latter, only the southernmost piece in Antioch is built to freeway standards. The northern piece and the southern piece south of SR 12 are also part of the National Highway System, a network of highways that are considered essential to the country&#x27;s economy, defense, and mobility by the Federal Highway Administration. The entire southern portion, from SR 4 to Sacramento, is eligible to be included in the State Scenic Highway System, and is officially designated as a scenic highway by the California Department of Transportation, meaning that it is a substantial section of highway passing through a &quot;memorable landscape&quot; with no &quot;visual intrusions&quot;, where the potential designation has gained popular favor with the community.

==History==

In the late 1910s, Sacramento County improved the county road along the levee of the Sacramento River between Sacramento and Rio Vista, which crossed the river twice on free ferries near Paintersville and Isleton. A toll ferry across the San Joaquin River connected Sherman Island, south of Rio Vista, with Antioch, where drivers could head west through the Broadway Tunnel to reach the San Francisco Bay, but the road between Rio Vista and the ferry was poor. In 1922, the Victory Highway Association selected this &quot;Netherlands Route&quot; (through what was locally promoted as the &quot;Netherlands of America&quot;) for the Victory Highway west of Sacramento, as it was both shorter than the Lincoln Highway route via Stockton and more scenic. In particular, the river district would &quot;impress [the motorist] with the enormous productive resources of this state as well as supply him with an unmatched scenic drive&quot;, and the Broadway Tunnel approach to the bay would bring him &quot;over the Victory Highway to the end of his journey in such a fashion that he will never forget the view spread before him as he first comes into sight of the San Francisco Bay region&quot;.
Two bascule bridges—the Paintersville Bridge and Isleton Bridge—replaced the free ferries in 1923, and are of a type patented by Joseph B. Strauss, who went on to design the Golden Gate Bridge. Local businessmen Aven Hanford and Oscar Klatt replaced the toll ferry with the tolled Antioch Bridge in mid-1926, almost a year before they opened the larger Carquinez Bridge to the west. The counties of Contra Costa and Sacramento organized a joint highway district in November 1925 to fund an improvement of the northern approach from Rio Vista; the concrete highway was completed in July 1927, creating a fully paved continuous route between Sacramento and the bay.
The legislature added this road to the state highway system in 1933, and it became part of Legislative Route 11, which had stretched east from Sacramento along US 50. This part of Route 11 was not assigned a sign route number in 1934, but, by 1937, when the new Broadway Low Level Tunnel opened, it was part of Sign Route 24. That route had initially begun at Woodland and traveled northeast and east through the Feather River Canyon, and was extended southeast from Woodland along Sign Route 16 to Sacramento and then south and west via Antioch to the San Francisco – Oakland Bay Bridge approach in Berkeley. The California Freeway and Expressway System was formed in 1959, and included in the planned upgrades was the road between Antioch and Rio Vista. (North of Rio Vista the present SR 84 was part of the system.) The entire length was included in the State Scenic Highway System in 1963. In the 1964 renumbering, the Antioch-Sacramento roadway was split between two routes: Route 84 from Antioch to SR 12 near Rio Vista, and Route 160 from SR 12 to Sacramento. However, the entire route was marked as SR 160, and in 1981 the legislative definition was changed to reflect this.

The part of SR 160 through and north of downtown Sacramento began as part of Legislative Route 3, which was added to the state highway system under the first bond issue, passed in 1910, and left the city on the 16th Street Bridge over the American River, following Del Paso Boulevard, El Camino Avenue, and Auburn Boulevard to Roseville. (The short piece from the end of Route 3 near the State Capitol south to Broadway and Freeport Boulevard was Route 4, which followed SR 99 towards Los Angeles.) Route 3 between Sacramento and Roseville was also part of the Victory Highway, and was marked as part of US 40 in 1928 and US 99E in 1929. The North Sacramento Freeway opened on October 6, 1947, bypassing this route from the bridge to Auburn Boulevard near Ben Ali. In 1955, the Elvas Freeway opened from the midpoint of the North Sacramento Freeway to the east side of downtown, and US 99E was moved off the south half of the older North Sacramento Freeway and onto the Elvas Freeway. The North Sacramento Freeway was included in the California Freeway and Expressway System when it was created in 1959, and the part of Route 3 southwest of the Elvas Freeway, which carried I-80, became part of SR 160 in the 1964 renumbering.

By 2000, the city of Sacramento maintained the non-freeway portion of SR 160 within the city limits under a contract with Caltrans. However, since Caltrans&#x27;s main goal is to move traffic efficiently, the city was not able to carry out pedestrian-friendly projects that they and local residents wanted. Under a law passed in July 1999, Caltrans was authorized to relinquish any part of Route 160 within the city limits to Sacramento. The two agencies agreed, and on October 19, 2000, the portion from the south city limits to the American River became the full responsibility of the city. A 2003 amendment to the Streets and Highways Code erroneously deleted not only this part, but the North Sacramento Freeway as well.

A project to convert the former southbound-only Richards Boulevard access just south of the American River to a standard signalized intersection was completed in August 2007; this improves access to existing and future development in the area, including redevelopment of a former rail yard, while slowing northbound traffic heading for the bridge and freeway. Another project converting Freeport Boulevard and 21st Street south of Broadway into two-way streets was also completed. 21st Street has carried northbound traffic since 1974, when Caltrans took it over. This will calm traffic while improving the intersection at the south end of the former one-way pair, which the SacRT light rail now crosses 21st Street just to the north of. In addition, the three blocks of F Street that carried southbound SR 160 from 12th Street to 15th Street have been calmed by the addition of a roundabout at 13th Street.

In 2012, SR 4 was re-routed to go further south to bypass Oakley and Brentwood. The southern end of SR 160 was then extended south to cover the part of the freeway that is no longer designated as SR 4, from Main Street (where State Route 4 originally exited the freeway) to the fork of the new SR 4 (formerly known as the State Route 4 Bypass, or Bypass Road).

In 2014, construction began at the interchange with SR 4 to complete the two remaining ramps that would link southbound SR 160 to eastbound SR 4 and westbound SR 4 to northbound SR 160. Construction was completed in March 2016.

<doc id="801748" wikidata="Q5650850" url="?curid=801748" title="Hans Zarkov">
<text>Dr. Hans Zarkov is a fictional character appearing in the &quot;Flash Gordon&quot; comic strip and the following serials, films, television shows and comic books. Zarkov is a brilliant scientist who creates a rocket and forces Flash and Dale Arden to come with him to the planet Mongo, and fight against Ming the Merciless. In the original comic strip, he was first thought to have died when his ship crashed into the planet Mongo. It is later revealed that Ming&#x27;s minions pulled him out of the wreckage. Zarkov&#x27;s character in the 1980s DC comic was handled the same way.

==Alex Raymond&#x27;s comic strip==
In the first &quot;Flash Gordon&quot; storyline, Zarkov discovers the Earth is endangered by an impending collision with the planet Mongo. Discovering Flash and Dale near his laboratory, he abducts them at gunpoint and forces them into his spacecraft, which he then launches at the planet Mongo. By the second storyline in the strip, Zarkov becomes a more sympathetic character who works with the heroes to become a regular companion.

==Comic books==
The 1996 &quot;Flash Gordon&quot; comic book published by King Features has Zarkov perform his traditional role of assisting Flash in his adventures. It also resolves the discrepancy in the serials about Zarkov&#x27;s first name, by giving the character&#x27;s full name as Hans Alexis Zarkov. In the 2011 Dynamite Comics comic &quot;Flash Gordon: Zeitgeist&quot;, Doctor Hans Zarkov is a Russian émigré, suffering from clinical paranoia, living in Switzerland. He abducts Flash and Dale and takes them to Mongo on board his rocket, here named &quot;Copernicus&quot;.

==In other media==
Zarkov was first portrayed in the &quot;Flash Gordon&quot; film serials by Frank Shannon. He is identified as &quot;Alexis Zarkov&quot; in the 1938 serial &quot;Flash Gordon&#x27;s Trip to Mars&quot;.

The character was portrayed by Joseph Nash in the 1954 &quot;Flash Gordon&quot; TV series.

In 1977, Zarkov appeared as a scientist bent on saving the Earth and introducing immense alien powers to the Earth in the &quot;Super Friends&quot; season 2 episode 11 titled &quot;Forbidden Powers.&quot; In this episode, Flash Gordon and Dale Arden are replaced by Batman and Wonder Woman who journey to space in order to rescue Zarkov and his assistant. The assistant is kidnapped much like he attempted to do to Munson in the 1980 &quot;Flash Gordon&quot; film.

Alan Oppenheimer provided the voice for the character in the 1979 Filmation animated series. The issue of Zarkov forcing the heroes to accompany him to Mongo is avoided by changing the story by having Flash and Dale come to his underground laboratory during a dangerous meteor shower that sets off a deadly volcanic eruption that traps the visitors even as it threatens to kill them. Thus Zarkov&#x27;s rocket is the only means to escape certain death and they board willingly. After which, Zarkov apologizes that he cannot drop the pair off before continuing to Mongo and they immediately agree to help him once he explains his mission.

In 1980, Chaim Topol (billed only as &quot;Topol&quot;) portrayed the character in the film &quot;Flash Gordon&quot; produced by Dino De Laurentiis. This version of Zarkov is a former NASA scientist, who was fired and dismissed because of his &quot;mad&quot; theories about an alien attack on Earth. After capturing him, Ming reveals the only reason the Earth is being destroyed is because Zarkov recognised the catastrophes as a deliberate attack. The quick flashbacks during his memory wipe scene revealed some further information about his past. He is Jewish and was born in Eastern Europe. His family moved to the United States fleeing from the Holocaust. Zarkov worked in the United States space program (including the Apollo program), before being removed. Also, at one point in his life he had a wife, who died by drowning in a pool. He is able to nullify the memory wipe by remembering all he can (songs by the Beatles, texts by William Shakespeare, formulas by Albert Einstein, and his recitation of the Talmud) during the process, giving it too much to process and essentially &quot;jamming&quot; it.

Paul Shaffer is the voice of Dr. Hans Zarkov in the 1996 animated series.

Jody Racicot portrayed the character in the 2007 &quot;Flash Gordon&quot; television series. He assists Flash, Dale, and Baylin by monitoring rifts that open. He seems very nervous constantly and Baylin describes as a &quot;strange, fidgety little man&quot;. His nervous attitude came from the fact that after Doctor Gordon disappeared in the rift experiment, he was hounded by FBI agents to cover up the truth.

<text>Susan Haskell (born June 10, 1968) is a Canadian actress. She played the role of Marty Saybrooke on the ABC soap opera &quot;One Life to Live&quot;.

==Personal life==
She graduated from The American Academy of Arts in 1991.

Haskell also appeared on &quot;Port Charles&quot; in 2001 as Granya Thornhart, opposite her former &quot;One Life to Live&quot; love interest (and real-life husband), Thorsten Kaye, with whom she has two daughters McKenna (born February 2003) and Marlowe Marann (born January 28, 2007).

==Career==
Haskell portrayed this role from December 1991 until August 1997, with two brief visits in January 2004 and January 2005. She returned again for an extended stay in mid-2008, first appearing onscreen on June 11, 2008. Haskell won two Daytime Emmy Awards, in 1994 for Outstanding Supporting Actress for the role in 1994, and in 2009 for Outstanding Lead Actress. At the time of Haskell&#x27;s 2008 return, Marty was called &quot;one of those tentpole characters that everyone who has watched &quot;One Life to Live&quot; at some point remembers.&quot; It was noted that the 1993 story of the character&#x27;s gang rape led by Todd Manning &quot;is one of the show&#x27;s most remembered and impactful.&quot;

When Haskell was expecting her second child with Kaye, the role of Marty was recast in November 2006 with Christina Chambers. Chambers exited the show in November 2007, a year after her debut, and Haskell returned in mid-2008.

<doc id="801755" wikidata="Q5530586" url="?curid=801755" title="Gemco">
<text>Gemco was an American chain of membership department stores that was owned by San Leandro-based Lucky Stores, a California supermarket company which eventually became part of Albertsons. Gemco operated from 1959 until closing in late 1986. A number of the west coast stores leases were sold to Target which fueled their entry into California. Gemco had a version called Memco, also owned by Lucky Stores, that operated stores in the Chicago, Illinois, and Washington, D.C., areas.

==History==
Gemco was established in Anaheim, California, in October 1959. A year later, the company was purchased by Lucky Stores, which added the supermarket element and expanded Gemco into a chain. Business and profitability continued to be healthy for over 20 years, until a series of unsuccessful leveraged takeover attempts from other companies were made on its parent company, Lucky Stores. Lucky, to avoid such hostile takeover attempts, eventually decided it was best to liquidate Gemco entirely. This liquidation occurred from September 1986 to November 1986. Target opened stores in most of the former Gemco locations by the fall of 1987, having remodeled many of Gemco&#x27;s former prime business locations into Target&#x27;s bright red-and-white trade dress.

===Name, colors and logo===
&quot;GEMCO&quot; never was an acronym, despite rumors to the contrary (e.g., that it stood for such terms as &quot;Government Employees&#x27; Merchandising Company&quot;). The letters were simply an easily pronounced and remembered name. Brown (with tan accents) was Gemco&#x27;s original main exterior background color, and the letters &quot;GEMCO&quot; were originally in red. Throughout the late 1960s and 1970s, the logo consisted of translucent, serifed capital letters on a horizontal dark blue oval. An early 1980s redesign changed the chain&#x27;s main exterior background color to blue (with light blue accenting), and its letter coloring in its logo to white (adding a yellow diamond on top of the &quot;M&quot;).

===Offerings and innovations===
An early example of what would become a hypermarket, Gemco offered one-stop shopping for everything from garden supplies to groceries, and regular department store offerings as well. Its concessionaires included gasoline (located outside and away from the front entrance) and jewelry. One innovation the store offered — found nowhere else at the time — was the storing and delivery of already purchased groceries when the member was finished shopping the rest of the store. A numbered plastic card was placed on the cart(s) and its match was given to the customer. When the member was done shopping and ready to leave the premises, the member merely needed to drive to the side of the store where the plastic card was given to the security guard. The guard would call for a courtesy clerk to deliver the groceries, and the clerk would load them into the member&#x27;s vehicle. Niceties such as this won many new members to Gemco, and created repeat business.

Gemco was a preferred employer in many of the locations in which it did business. Unlike many other &quot;discount&quot; chains such as Payless, Gemco employed union members of the UFCW (United Food and Commercial Workers).

Gemco also offered a credit department to help increase sales. It was particularly busy each year during the Christmas shopping period.

On a trial basis, a few Gemco stores offered free babysitting while an adult was shopping in the store. The adult would drop off the child in the designated area of the store and would be given a ticket with a number on it. When done shopping they would give the cashier the ticket, who in return called the babysitting dept and a clerk would bring the child out to the parent. The parent could also pick the child up directly as well. After about one year of trial Gemco ceased operation of this trial. California law required a caregiver in a commercial operation to be licensed and insured as a daycare.

Gemco also started the Gemco Charitable and Scholarship Foundation, a California corporation, in November 1959. The foundation held annual scholarship competitions in the areas where Gemco had stores. Each competition placed competitors, who were high school seniors selected by their schools, in a panel discussion format with judges questioning them about their views on discussion topics and requiring that they defend their positions. Several rounds of discussions would be judged to determine the winners. Winners were awarded one-time scholarships of up to $1,500.00 based on the judges&#x27; scoring of their performance, with lesser amounts being awarded to runners-up. The foundation&#x27;s corporate rights have been suspended in California.
Gemco members received a monthly catalog, the Gemco Courier, containing Saturday Evening Post-inspired cover art.

===Memco===
The East Coast stores, located in the Washington, D.C., area, were called Memco instead of Gemco to avoid confusion with an already existing area chain called GEM. Memco stores had a blue color scheme on its walls and signage. Memco honored Gemco membership cards, and vice versa. Sometimes when an advertisement photo showed a membership card, the first letter in the logo was concealed, so the same picture could be used in both Gemco and Memco ads.

Memco entered the Washington, D.C., market in 1969 with stores on Little River Turnpike at Braddock Road in Annandale, Virginia, and on Allentown Road in Camp Springs, Maryland. When the chain announced its exit from the market in December 1982, there were 13 stores (including two in Richmond, Virginia, one in Reston, Virginia, and two in the Baltimore area), Columbia, Maryland, and Greenbelt, Maryland, stores had opened just two months earlier, and a 14th store under construction in Burke, Virginia, a suburb of Washington, D.C. The closings idled 1,200 retail workers. All of those locations were converted to Bradlees upon Gemco&#x27;s closing. Several of the former locations are currently open as Home Depot or were occupied by Kmart before closing. Home Depot near Fairfax Circle in Fairfax, Virginia, used to be a Memco.

Memco also had stores in the suburbs of Chicago, Illinois, which opened in Niles and Arlington Heights in August 1972 and in Lombard in August 1973. These three stores were not very successful and were converted into Eagle Family Centers in October 1977. Buildings for two of these stores were later occupied by the Roundy&#x27;s-owned Pick &#x27;n Save discount warehouse stores in May 1982.

==Fictitious town==
The fictitious town of Gemco, California, is located in Van Nuys, California, near Woodman Avenue and Saticoy Street. It appeared on a map in the 1980s, possibly as a copyright trap, and is now in many mapping databases. It actually was the shorthand name used by the Southern Pacific Railroad to refer to the General Motors Van Nuys Assembly plant.

<doc id="801763" wikidata="Q661199" url="?curid=801763" title="Dining room">
<text>A dining room is a room for consuming food. In modern times it is usually next to the kitchen for convenience in serving, though in medieval times it was often on an entirely different floor level. Historically the dining room is furnished with a rather large dining table and several dining chairs. The most common shape is generally rectangular with two armed end chairs and an even number of unarmed side chairs on the long sides.

== History ==
In the Middle Ages, Britons and other European nobility in castles or large manor houses dined in the great hall. This was a large multi-function room capable of seating the bulk of the population of the house. The family would sit at the head table on a raised dais, with the rest of the population arrayed in order of diminishing rank away from them. Tables in the great hall would tend to be long trestle tables with benches. The sheer number of people in a Great Hall meant it would probably have had a busy, bustling atmosphere. Suggestions that it would also have been quite smelly and smoky are probably, by the standards of the time, unfounded. These rooms had large chimneys and high ceilings and there would have been a free flow of air through the numerous door and window openings.

It is true that the owners of such properties began to develop a taste for more intimate gatherings in smaller &#x27;parlers&#x27; or &#x27;privee parlers&#x27; off the main hall, but this is thought to be due as much to political and social changes as to the greater comfort afforded by such rooms. Over time, the nobility took more of their meals in the parlour, which became, functionally, a dining room (or was split into two separate rooms). It also migrated further from the Great Hall, often accessed via grand ceremonial staircases from the dais in the Great Hall. Eventually dining in the Great Hall became something that was done primarily on special occasions.

Towards the beginning of the 18th century, a pattern emerged where the ladies of the house would withdraw after dinner from the dining room to the drawing room. The gentlemen would remain in the dining room having drinks. The dining room tended to take on a more masculine tenor as a result.

In the 1930s and 40s, dining rooms continued to be separate from kitchens even as servant&#x27;s rooms became less common in middle-class houses. In the 1950s and 60s, dining and kitchen areas were merged, and living rooms were merged with the kitchen-dining rooms.

During the COVID-19 pandemic, dining rooms that still existed were used as home offices or classrooms and were valuable for their seclusion.

== Contemporary usage ==
A typical North American dining room will contain a table with chairs arranged along the sides and ends of the table, as well as other pieces of furniture such as sideboards and china cabinets, as space permits. Tables in modern dining rooms will often have a removable leaf to allow for the larger number of people present on those special occasions without taking up extra space when not in use. Although the &quot;typical&quot; family dining experience is at a wooden table or some sort of kitchen area, some choose to make their dining rooms more comfortable by using couches or cushioned chairs.

In modern American and Canadian homes, the dining room is typically adjacent to the living room, being increasingly used only for formal dining with guests or on special occasions. For informal daily meals, most medium size houses and larger will have a space adjacent to the kitchen where a table and chairs can be placed. Larger spaces are often known as a dinette while a smaller one is called a breakfast nook. Smaller houses and condos may have a breakfast bar instead, typically of a different height than the regular kitchen counter (either raised for stools or lowered for chairs). If a home lacks a dinette, breakfast nook, or breakfast bar, then the kitchen or family room will be used for day-to-day eating.

In Britain, many families would traditionally use the dining room only on Sundays, eating other meals in the kitchen.

In Australia, the use of a dining room is still prevalent, yet not an essential part of modern home design. For most, it is considered a space to be used during formal occasions or celebrations. Smaller homes may use a breakfast bar or table placed within a kitchen or living space for meals.

<doc id="801766" wikidata="Q2719607" url="?curid=801766" title="Hammerhead (comics)">
<text>Hammerhead is a supervillain appearing in American comic books published by Marvel Comics. The character is primarily depicted as an adversary of the superhero Spider-Man. He is a temperamental mobster who often dresses and acts in the 1920s style, and a prominent member of the Maggia, a fictional organized crime syndicate. Following an accident, he had most of his skull replaced with an inflexible steel alloy by Jonas Harrow, giving his head a flattened shape and near-indestructibility, hence his nickname. The Hammerhead crime family, of which he is the second and current head, is named after the character.

Hammerhead has made appearances in several forms of media outside of comics, including animated series and video games. IGN ranked him as Spider-Man&#x27;s 20th greatest enemy.

==Publication history==
Hammerhead made his first appearance in &quot;The Amazing Spider-Man&quot; #113, and was created by writer Gerry Conway and artist John Romita Sr.

Conway recalled that Hammerhead &quot;was most directly influenced by the Big Man and the Crime-Master, who were among the first villains in &quot;Amazing Spider-Man&quot;. One of the more interesting things Stan [Lee], Jack Kirby, and, of course, Steve Ditko did was combining the two different kinds of milieus: superhero and &quot;Dick Tracy&quot;, with the unusual criminal characters who had some kind of physical deformity... Plus, Hammerhead—I liked [the] name, and John Romita came up with an interesting look&quot;.

==Fictional character biography==
Hammerhead&#x27;s family immigrated from the Soviet Union to Italy when he was a child with help from a man known only as the General. His father ran a garage in Toirrano, where he insisted the young man speak only in Russian, beating him severely with a mallet when he would not. Although not much is known about his life before he became a criminal and supervillain, Hammerhead is known to be married and has a sister named Antonia.

All the while, Hammerhead dreamed of becoming a gangster. He is eventually recruited into one of the &quot;families&quot; of the criminal organization known as the Maggia when a member oversees Hammerhead &quot;making his bones&quot; by murdering a childhood bully and his girlfriend in a theater showing &quot;The Godfather Part II&quot;. Originally a small-time hitman, Hammerhead quickly rises through the ranks of the Maggia, while pretending to be ethnically Italian so he can be &quot;made&quot;, or fully initiated member. In his final test, Hammerhead is brought to his father&#x27;s garage (with the Maggia apparently unaware of their relationship). Hammerhead proceeds to kill his father, while saying in Russian that he blames his villainy on his father&#x27;s abuse.

One day, Hammerhead was found beaten, disfigured, and delirious with pain in an alley in New York City&#x27;s Bowery by Jonas Harrow, a surgeon who had lost his medical license due to his illegal experiments. Seeing the opportunity both to save this man&#x27;s life and to redeem his reputation, Harrow operated on the gunman for three days, replacing much of his shattered skull with a strong steel alloy. During the surgery, the unconscious thug fixated on the only memory he retained: an image of a poster for a movie called &quot;The Al Capone Mob&quot;, which was hanging in the alley where he lay beaten and bloodied before Harrow found him. When he recovered, the memory of the poster and its images of 1930s-era gangsters prompted Hammerhead to start a gang of his own in the style of Capone and other mobsters of the 1920s. He even dressed as if he were living in that decade.

A gang war broke out between Hammerhead&#x27;s mob and Doctor Octopus&#x27;s criminal organization. Hammerhead was forced to flee the country due to Spider-Man&#x27;s interference. He later had a rematch with Doctor Octopus next to an atomic breeder reactor on a remote Canadian island which caused a chain reaction, blasting Hammerhead &quot;out of phase&quot; with this dimension. Some time later, he appeared as an immaterial ghost-like being to haunt Doctor Octopus. Doctor Octopus then unwittingly used a particle accelerator to restore Hammerhead to his corporeal form. Hammerhead kidnapped Spider-Man&#x27;s Aunt May, who was then rescued by Spider-Man as Doctor Octopus caused Hammerhead&#x27;s helicopter to plummet into the Hudson River.

Hammerhead then proposed that all Maggia families unite under his leadership. Wearing a strength-enhancing exoskeleton, he battled the Human Torch, who then fused the exoskeleton&#x27;s power pack. Hammerhead was nearly assassinated by the Kingpin&#x27;s minion the Arranger during a gang war. Despite surviving the assassination, Hammerhead was ultimately forced out of a major role in New York City organized crime by the Kingpin.

Hammerhead then allied himself with the Chameleon in the latter&#x27;s bid to become the new crime lord of New York City. The two served as partners in a splinter group of the Maggia. Hammerhead hired Tombstone as a bodyguard and hitman. He hired the Hobgoblin to kill Joe Robertson, who posed a threat to Tombstone; the assassination attempt failed. Hammerhead was kidnapped and beaten by Tombstone, who had gained superhuman powers and resented Hammerhead for not sending him to kill Joe Robertson.

Hammerhead later attended a Las Vegas crime conference to divide the resources left by the Kingpin&#x27;s downfall at the time. Around this time, he participates in a multi-sided gang-war focused on the Kingpin&#x27;s attempt to re-take New York City for his own.

Hammerhead is a major player in underworld activities in the Marvel Universe and is highly sought after for elimination by the Punisher. He becomes one of several gang warlords struggling to control the criminal underworld in the major cities of the Eastern United States. During one of the first meetings of such warlords, Hammerhead was almost killed by the Strucker twins. This meeting was being manipulated by Baron Strucker, the head of HYDRA. When Don Fortunato made a bid for control of the New York underworld, Hammerhead opposed him and was almost killed as a result. When every other crime lord surrendered to Fortunato and his HYDRA allies, Hammerhead went rogue, launching a raid on Fortunato&#x27;s home and successfully fighting off a HYDRA attack on his own headquarters. He did have assistance from Spider-Man and Morbius the Living Vampire, however. For a time, the hero known as S.H.O.C. also assists Hammerhead. Later, he was hired by Norman Osborn to be a part of the Sinister Twelve.

During the events of the &quot;Civil War&quot;, Hammerhead used the vacuum left by the incarceration of the Kingpin to gain a greater foothold in the ranks of organized crime, attempting to organize an army of costumed villains (consisting of the Ani-Men, the Answer I, the Aura, Bloodshed, the Clown, the Cyclone III, the Discus, Electro, the Great Gambonnos, the Kangaroo II, Man Mountain Marko, the Mauler, Mindblast, Override, the Ringmaster, Stiletto, the Spot, the Squid, Slyde, the Trapster, and the Will O&#x27; the Wisp) to enforce his new criminal empire. When Slyde balked at the idea, Hammerhead had Underworld kill him to serve as a warning to anyone who did not join up with him. The Kingpin manipulated various hero factions, most notably S.H.I.E.L.D. and Iron Man, into breaking up Hammerhead&#x27;s first convening of his army. During the conflict, Hammerhead was shot numerous times by Underworld, who was revealed to be working for the Kingpin. Underworld later confronted Hammerhead while he lay in prison and shot him at point-blank range with adamantium bullets.

The bullets, while not penetrating his skull, did cause severe trauma to his brain, resulting him in needing surgery, but the hospital he was brought to was unable to treat him. In mid-surgery however, men working for the Kingpin&#x27;s rival Mister Negative came in, killed the hospital staff, and took Hammerhead away. Mister Negative then has his surgeon Doctor Trauma revive Hammerhead and offers to transplant his brain into a new robotic adamantium skeleton, which Hammerhead agrees to.

The operation is a complete success, and Hammerhead is restored to full mobility without any ill effects. He swears loyalty to Mister Negative in exchange for his restored life and proceeds to shape a gang of lowlife thugs into an effective army for his benefactor. He then proceeds to battle Spider-Man, besting him with no effort for the first time in years. Later, he has a rematch with Spider-Man, with Spider-Man dislocating Hammerhead&#x27;s hip bone.

Mister Negative sends Hammerhead to help Spider-Man (who Mister Negative corrupted) take down the Hood, who launches an attack on Negative&#x27;s headquarters. He blackmails H.A.M.M.E.R. director Norman Osborn into forcing the Hood to pull out of Chinatown.

Hammerhead later begins to doubt his loyalty to Mister Negative when Silvermane, a deceased former Maggia don and an old enemy of the Kingpin, appears to return. Unknown to Hammerhead, &quot;Silvermane&quot; is actually an android controlled by Mysterio to plant seeds of rebellion. Nevertheless, he flees a shootout with the Maggia when the Silvermane robot calls him a traitor. It is shown that Mister Negative had a computer chip put in Hammerhead&#x27;s head to deliver an electroshock when necessary, which he promptly uses to punish him and remind him who is in charge.

During the &quot;Origin of the Species&quot; storyline, Hammerhead and Mister Negative are among the supervillains invited by Doctor Octopus to join his supervillain team, promising them that they will receive a reward in exchange for securing some specific items for him.

Alongside his nephew and minions, Hammerhead formed an alliance with the Black Cat, where he sided with her gang.

Hammerhead is among the crime lords competing with Mister Negative in obtaining the Tablet of Life and Destiny to win the favor of Mayor Wilson Fisk.

Hammerhead was among the crime lords that attend the wedding of Randy Robertson and Janice Lincoln. When Shotgun crashed the wedding and shoots Tombstone as Spider-Man goes after him, the crime lords blame each other for calling the hit. As Madame Masque takes her leave, Tombstone bombs her limo.

As Hammerhead is meeting with his gang at the start of the &quot;Gang War&quot; storyline, they are visited by Madame Masque&#x27;s father Count Nefaria. While stating that he&#x27;ll take the blame for what happened to his daughter, Hammerhead is told by Count Nefaria that the other crime lords will bow to the Maggia once again. After hearing about how Mister Negative&#x27;s Inner Demons had used holy water on Lady Yulan&#x27;s gang, Hammerhead meets with Mister Negative, Lady Yulan, Owl, and Black Mariah where he mentions that his gang will be backed by Count Nefaria and Silvermane while also mentioning that Madame Masque and Tombstone&#x27;s territories are up for grabs. At Arthur Avenue, Hammerhead meets with Owl, Lady Yulan, Mister Negative, Black Mariah, Diamondback, and Shang-Chi (who is representing the Five Weapons Society) when Janice Lincoln arrives with White Rabbit stating that none of the crime lords will have her father&#x27;s territory. After sending some gunmen to target Randy Robertson, Hammerhead learns too late that the girl he has been dating was Madame Masque in disguise as she uses a combination of magic and an Adamantium bar to knock him out. Hammerhead is told by Madame Masque that she is an overlooked weapon of hers and then dares him to &quot;call all of them&quot;. His men arrive to find Madame Masque and Shotgun holding a defeated Count Nefaria and Silvermane&#x27;s head and must swear an oath to Madame Masque as the new leader of the Maggia. Hammerhead was later seen in a cell with Count Nefaria and Silvermane by the time X-23&#x27;s clone Bellona threw Owl in with them.

==Powers and abilities==

Hammerhead has no superhuman abilities, yet his skull is now surgically reinforced with vibranium (or secondary adamantium), making his head flat on top; with this, he can charge and break through objects such as brick walls without causing any pain or damage to himself. This metal can absorb physical impacts that would otherwise fracture human bone. Hammerhead is in peak physical condition comparable to that of an Olympic-level athlete. He is a formidable hand-to-hand combatant whose most dangerous tactic is charging head first like a bull toward an opponent. Hammerhead once utilized a strength-enhancing exoskeleton designed by the Tinkerer.

After an assassin&#x27;s adamantium bullet penetrated a part of his head not protected by his adamantium skull, Hammerhead is surgically rebuilt by Mister Negative. Breakout surgeries replace the upper half of his skeleton with an adamantium endo-skeleton (the skeleton is shown to have a network of hydraulic servomechanisms). The upper portion of his body is now superhumanly strong as a result of the additional hidden cybernetic musculature, making him able to effortlessly beat a superpowered foe such as Spider-Man. Mister Negative does not use on Hammerhead the same Lord Dark Wind bonding process, used on the similarly empowered Wolverine and Lady Deathstrike for coating their bones in adamantium: instead he replaces Hammerhead&#x27;s bones with replicas fashioned in the invulnerable metal. It is still unknown how his artificial skeleton can carry on biological functions.

The intervention of Mr. Negative also radically changed Hammerhead&#x27;s personality. Hammerhead now recalls his life as a Russian immigrant prior to the accident in which he adopted the 1920s gangster persona. Consequently, Hammerhead no longer speaks like a 1920s movie gangster, but instead behaves as a typical modern Russian mobster and hitman, as this was apparently his original personality prior to his head injury.

Hammerhead is highly skilled in the organization, concealment and management of criminal enterprises. He is an effective hitman, a skilled marksman (his preferred weapon was the Thompson submachine gun), and an excellent street fighter. In his original incarnation, Hammerhead was able to hold his own against Spider-Man despite being an ordinary human by using his superhumanly durable skull as a blunt instrument. After his recent augmentation, he is now capable of grappling with and physically overpowering Spider-Man to the extent that he could eventually crush his foe.

==Reception==
* In 2022, &quot;Screen Rant&quot; included Hammerhead in their &quot;10 Spider-Man Villains That Are Smarter Than They Seem&quot; list.
* In 2022, &quot;CBR.com&quot; ranked Hammerhead 10th in their &quot;10 Most Violent Spider-Man Villains&quot; list.

The girl stumbles upon local street performer/magician Gambit, taking the girl in and decides to protect her from the mob. The girl is kidnapped and Gambit goes on a rampage to find her, blindly running into an ambush Hammerhead set up. Gambit gets out of the ambush and chases Hammerhead down and ends with Gambit charging Hammerhead&#x27;s inorganic skull full of bio-kinetic energy and causes his head to explode. In &quot;Ultimate Spider-Man&quot;, Hammerhead was revealed to have survived Gambit&#x27;s attack, though how is not explained (&quot;It sucked. I came back.&quot;). He kills Silvermane in the beginning of the Warriors story arc and becomes the Enforcers&#x27; new leader and he burns down one of the Kingpin&#x27;s warehouses. After an intense battle with Spider-Man, the Black Cat, the Moon Knight, Iron Fist and Shang-Chi, he was put in a coma when Elektra brutally stabbed him in the chest with her sai and flung him out of a window.

===&quot;Age of Ultron&quot;===
During the &quot;Age of Ultron&quot; storyline, a reality where Ultron nearly annihilated the human race has Hammerhead and the Owl capturing the Superior Spider-Man and hoping to trade him to Ultron. Hawkeye came to the Superior Spider-Man&#x27;s rescue as the Ultron Sentinels attack.

However, Tombstone eventually becomes fed up with Hammerhead&#x27;s failures and begins conducting business without him. While contacting Norman Osborn to create another supervillain, Hammerhead becomes inspired to betray his boss. Secretly calling for a Valentine&#x27;s Day summit between Tombstone, Silvermane, and Doctor Octopus, Hammerhead attempts to manipulate the assembled crime bosses into killing each other.

<text>Robert Krimmer (born November 24, 1953) is an American lawyer and former actor. Formerly known professionally as Wortham Krimmer (his first wife&#x27;s maiden name as his first name), Krimmer has reverted to his birth name of Robert Krimmer.

With appearances on &quot;St. Elsewhere&quot;, &quot;Hill Street Blues&quot;, and the soap operas, &quot;Knots Landing&quot; and &quot;Days of Our Lives&quot;, Krimmer is best known by soap fans as Reverend Andrew Carpenter on the ABC soap opera &quot;One Life to Live&quot;. He is also known for playing the mad Emperor Cartagia in the 4th season of the science fiction series &quot;Babylon 5&quot;. In addition, he was featured on the Showtime drama &quot;The Paper Chase&quot; for the second, third and final seasons as Zeiss, a student and member of the Law Review, and on &quot;Family Medical Center&quot; (1988–1989) as Dr. Alexander Raines.

Prior to his acting career, Krimmer attended the JD/MBA program at University of California Hastings College of Law and Berkeley. He left the program upon being offered a scholarship to the American Conservatory Theater (ACT) MFA Program. After completing the three-year program at ACT, Krimmer pursued an acting career that spanned 27 years. Following his acting career Krimmer returned to law school, attending classes at Santa Barbara &amp; Ventura Colleges of Law on a part-time basis while working as a paralegal during the day. He graduated valedictorian and then passed the California bar exam on his first try. Following law school he began work as an attorney.

Krimmer has been married to Chris LaValle since 2009 and has two children from a previous marriage.

<doc id="801773" wikidata="Q579565" url="?curid=801773" title="Breed standard">
<text>In animal husbandry or animal fancy, a breed standard is a description of the characteristics of a hypothetical or ideal example of a breed. The description may include physical or morphological detail, genetic criteria, or criteria of athletic or productive performance. It may also describe faults or deficiencies that would disqualify an animal from registration or from reproduction. The hypothetical ideal example may be called a &quot;breed type&quot;.

Breed standards are devised by breed associations or breed clubs, not by individuals, and are written to reflect the use or purpose of the species and breed of the animal. Breed standards help define the ideal animal of a breed and provide goals for breeders in improving stock. In essence a breed standard is a blueprint for an animal fit for the function it was bred - i.e. herding, tracking etc. Breed standards are not scientific documents, and may vary from association to association, and from country to country, even for the same species and breed. There is no one format for breed standards across all species, and breed standards do change and are updated over time.

== Contents of a breed standard ==

Breed standards cover the &quot;externally observable&quot; qualities of the animal such as &quot;appearance&quot;, &quot;movement&quot;, and &quot;temperament&quot;. The exact format of the breed standard varies, as breed standards are not scientific documents and change as the needs of the members of the organization which authors them change. In general, a breed standard may include history of the breed, a narrative description of the breed, and details of the ideal externally observable structure and behavior for the breed. Certain deviations from the standard are considered &quot;faults&quot;. A large degree of deviation from the breed standard, an excess of faults, or certain defined major faults, may indicate that the animal should not be bred, although its fitness for other uses may not be impeded by the faults. An animal that closely matches (conforms to) the breed standard for its species and breed is said to have good conformation.

== Examples of use ==
In the American Poultry Association breed standards for poultry, for example, ducks and geese are divided by weight, and chicken breeds are divided by size. Chickens are also divided into egg laying, meat, and ornamental varieties. In cattle, breed standards allow for comparisons and the selection of the best breeds to raise.

There is breed standard for dogs, cats, horses, chicken breeds, and others. The standard is used as a comparative parameter for judging animals in conformation shows competitions.

== Regulation ==
Some species have international governing bodies that attempt to regulate the terminology and format of breed standards internationally, but, even where such international agreement exists, not all associations for that species necessarily belong to the international governing body. The Federation Cynologique Internationale regulates breed standards for dogs internationally, but the largest dog registry, the American Kennel Club, does not belong to the international body and uses its own breed standard format.

<doc id="801775" wikidata="Q3226741" url="?curid=801775" title="Le Répertoire de la cuisine">
<text>Le répertoire de la cuisine is a professional reference cookbook written by and Louis Saulnier and published in 1914; it has gone through multiple editions and been translated into multiple languages. It summarizes &quot;Le Guide culinaire&quot; by Auguste Escoffier, and adds a significant amount of Saulnier&#x27;s own material.

==History==

Louis Saulnier, a follower of Auguste Escoffier, wrote the &quot;Répertoire&quot; as a guide to Escoffier&#x27;s &quot;Le Guide culinaire&quot;. It is a standard reference for classical French haute cuisine and has been translated into English and Spanish. 

Its first edition was published in 1914 by the Maison Allard in London and its 32nd in 1976 by Flammarion. Saulnier was a chef entremetier and the secretary of the Union des Cuisiniers, Pâtissiers et Glaciers Français de Londres; Gringoire (a pseudonym for ) was a writer and the editor in chief of &quot;Le Carnet d&#x27;Épicure&quot; (1911-1914), a gastronomic monthly in London under the auspices of Escoffier.

The first English translation was by Édouard Brunet in 1924; the 15th English edition was published in London in 1979. The 1976 American edition has an introduction by Jacques Pépin. 

==Format==
The style of &quot;Le Répertoire&quot; is highly condensed, even in comparison with the brevity of its inspiration; it is a sort of &quot;aide-memoire&quot; for combinations of base ingredient, sauce, and garnish, a codification of conventional or standard &quot;names&quot; for the combinations used in classical cooking.

The recipes provided are little more than simple descriptions of dishes, and assume a great deal of background knowledge, saying nothing about cooking techniques, timings, or proportions.

It follows the structure of Escoffier&#x27;s original to simplify cross-referencing.

For example, this is the complete recipe for Poulet sauté Bonne-Femme (in the section on poulet sauté):
:Sauter. Déglacer vin blanc et jus lié. Garnir lardons, petits oignons, pommes cocotte.
:Sauter. Deglaze with white wine and thickened juices. Garnish with lardons, small onions, and cocotte potatoes (olive-sized, blanched and browned in clarified butter).

== Reputation ==
The Culinary Institute of America instructor Uwe Hestnar mentions &quot;Le Répertoire&quot; alongside Larousse gastronomique and the works of Escoffier and Carême as required reading for anyone interested in classical French cooking.

<doc id="801776" wikidata="Q927337" url="?curid=801776" title="Retinal ganglion cell">
<text>A retinal ganglion cell (RGC) is a type of neuron located near the inner surface (the ganglion cell layer) of the retina of the eye. It receives visual information from photoreceptors via two intermediate neuron types: bipolar cells and retina amacrine cells. Retina amacrine cells, particularly narrow field cells, are important for creating functional subunits within the ganglion cell layer and making it so that ganglion cells can observe a small dot moving a small distance. Retinal ganglion cells collectively transmit image-forming and non-image forming visual information from the retina in the form of action potential to several regions in the thalamus, hypothalamus, and mesencephalon, or midbrain.

Retinal ganglion cells vary significantly in terms of their size, connections, and responses to visual stimulation but they all share the defining property of having a long axon that extends into the brain. These axons form the optic nerve, optic chiasm, and optic tract.

A small percentage of retinal ganglion cells contribute little or nothing to vision, but are themselves photosensitive; their axons form the retinohypothalamic tract and contribute to circadian rhythms and pupillary light reflex, the resizing of the pupil.

== Function ==
There are about 0.7 to 1.5 million retinal ganglion cells in the human retina. With about 4.6 million cone cells and 92 million rod cells, or 96.6 million photoreceptors per retina, on average each retinal ganglion cell receives inputs from about 100 rods and cones. However, these numbers vary greatly among individuals and as a function of retinal location. In the fovea (center of the retina), a single ganglion cell will communicate with as few as five photoreceptors. In the extreme periphery (edge of the retina), a single ganglion cell will receive information from many thousands of photoreceptors.

Retinal ganglion cells spontaneously fire action potentials at a base rate while at rest. Excitation of retinal ganglion cells results in an increased firing rate while inhibition results in a depressed rate of firing.

==Types==
There is wide variability in ganglion cell types across species. In primates, including humans, there are generally three classes of RGCs:
* W-ganglion: small, 40% of total, broad fields in retina, excitation from rods. Detection of direction movement anywhere in the field.
* X-ganglion: medium diameter, 55% of total, small field, color vision. Sustained response.
* Y-ganglion: largest, 5%, very broad dendritic field, respond to rapid eye movement or rapid change in light intensity. Transient response.

The W, X and Y retinal ganglion types arose from studies of the cat. These physiological types are closely related to the respective morphological retinal ganglion types formula_1, formula_2 and formula_3. 

Based on their projections and functions, there are at least five main classes of retinal ganglion cells:
* Midget cell (parvocellular/P pathway; P cells)
* Parasol cell (magnocellular/M pathway; M cells)
* Bistratified cell (koniocellular/K pathway; K cells)
* Photosensitive ganglion cells
* Other ganglion cells projecting to the superior colliculus for eye movements (saccades)

===P-type===
P-type retinal ganglion cells project to the parvocellular layers of the lateral geniculate nucleus. These cells are known as midget retinal ganglion cells, based on the small sizes of their dendritic trees and cell bodies. About 80% of all retinal ganglion cells are midget cells in the parvocellular pathway. They receive inputs from relatively few rods and cones. They have slow conduction velocity, and respond to changes in color but respond only weakly to changes in contrast unless the change is great. They have simple center-surround receptive fields, where the center may be either ON or OFF while the surround is the opposite.

===M-type===
M-type retinal ganglion cells project to the magnocellular layers of the lateral geniculate nucleus. These cells are known as parasol retinal ganglion cells, based on the large sizes of their dendritic trees and cell bodies. About 10% of all retinal ganglion cells are parasol cells, and these cells are part of the magnocellular pathway. They receive inputs from relatively many rods and cones. They have fast conduction velocity, and can respond to low-contrast stimuli, but are not very sensitive to changes in color. They have much larger receptive fields which are nonetheless also center-surround.

===K-type===
BiK-type retinal ganglion cells project to the koniocellular layers of the lateral geniculate nucleus. K-type retinal ganglion cells have been identified only relatively recently. Koniocellular means &quot;cells as small as dust&quot;; their small size made them hard to find. About 10% of all retinal ganglion cells are bistratified cells, and these cells go through the koniocellular pathway. They receive inputs from intermediate numbers of rods and cones. They may be involved in color vision. They have very large receptive fields that only have centers (no surrounds) and are always ON to the blue cone and OFF to both the red and green cone.

=== Photosensitive ganglion cell ===
Photosensitive ganglion cells, including but not limited to the giant retinal ganglion cells, contain their own photopigment, melanopsin, which makes them respond directly to light even in the absence of rods and cones. They project to, among other areas, the suprachiasmatic nucleus (SCN) via the retinohypothalamic tract for setting and maintaining circadian rhythms. Other retinal ganglion cells projecting to the lateral geniculate nucleus (LGN) include cells making connections with the Edinger-Westphal nucleus (EW), for control of the pupillary light reflex, and giant retinal ganglion cells.

==Physiology==
Most mature ganglion cells are able to fire action potentials at a high frequency because of their expression of Kv3 potassium channels.

==Pathology==
Degeneration of axons of the retinal ganglion cells (the optic nerve) is a hallmark of glaucoma.

== Developmental biology ==
=== Retinal growth: the beginning ===
Retinal ganglion cells (RGCs) are born between embryonic day 11 and post-natal day zero in the mouse and between week 5 and week 18 &quot;in utero&quot; in human development. In mammals, RGCs are typically added at the beginning in the dorsal central aspect of the optic cup, or eye primordium. Then RC growth sweeps out ventrally and peripherally from there in a wave-like pattern. This process depends on a host of factors, ranging from signaling factors like FGF3 and FGF8 to proper inhibition of the Notch signaling pathway. Most importantly, the bHLH (basic helix-loop-helix)-domain containing transcription factor Atoh7 and its downstream effectors, such as Brn3b and Isl-1, work to promote RGC survival and differentiation. The &quot;differentiation wave&quot; that drives RGC development across the retina is also regulated in particular of the bHLH factors Neurog2 and Ascl1 and FGF/Shh signaling, deriving from the periphery.

=== Growth within the retinal ganglion cell (optic fiber) layer ===
Early progenitor RGCs will typically extend processes connecting to the inner and outer limiting membranes of the retina with the outer layer adjacent to the retinal pigment epithelium and inner adjacent to the future vitreous humor. The cell soma will pull towards the pigment epithelium, undergo a terminal cell division and differentiation, and then migrate backwards towards the inner limiting membrane in a process called somal translocation. The kinetics of RGC somal translocation and underlying mechanisms are best understood in the zebrafish. The RGC will then extend an axon in the retinal ganglion cell layer, which is directed by laminin contact. The retraction of the apical process of the RGC is likely mediated by Slit–Robo signaling.

RGCs will grow along glial end feet positioned on the inner surface (side closest to the future vitreous humor). Neural cell adhesion molecule (N-CAM) will mediate this attachment via homophilic interactions between molecules of like isoforms (A or B). Slit signaling also plays a role, preventing RGCs from growing into layers beyond the optic fiber layer.

Axons from the RGCs will grow and extend towards the optic disc, where they exit the eye. Once differentiated, they are bordered by an inhibitory peripheral region and a central attractive region, thus promoting extension of the axon towards the optic disc. CSPGs exist along the retinal neuroepithelium (surface over which the RGCs lie) in a peripheral high–central low gradient. Slit is also expressed in a similar pattern, secreted from the cells in the lens. Adhesion molecules, like N-CAM and L1, will promote growth centrally and will also help to properly fasciculate (bundle) the RGC axons together. Shh is expressed in a high central, low peripheral gradient, promoting central-projecting RGC axons extension via Patched-1, the principal receptor for Shh, mediated signaling.

=== Growth into and through the optic nerve ===
RGCs exit the retinal ganglion cell layer through the optic disc, which requires a 45° turn. This requires complex interactions with optic disc glial cells which will express local gradients of Netrin-1, a morphogen that will interact with the Deleted in Colorectal Cancer (DCC) receptor on growth cones of the RGC axon. This morphogen initially attracts RGC axons, but then, through an internal change in the growth cone of the RGC, netrin-1 becomes repulsive, pushing the axon away from the optic disc. This is mediated through a cAMP-dependent mechanism. Additionally, CSPGs and Eph–ephrin signaling may also be involved.

RGCs will grow along glial cell end feet in the optic nerve. These glia will secrete repulsive semaphorin 5a and Slit in a surround fashion, covering the optic nerve which ensures that they remain in the optic nerve. Vax1, a transcription factor, is expressed by the ventral diencephalon and glial cells in the region where the chiasm is formed, and it may also be secreted to control chiasm formation.

=== Growth at the optic chiasm ===
When RGCs approach the optic chiasm, the point at which the two optic nerves meet, at the ventral diencephalon around embryonic days 10–11 in the mouse, they have to make the decision to cross to the contralateral optic tract or remain in the ipsilateral optic tract. In the mouse, about 5% of RGCs, mostly those coming from the ventral-temporal crescent (VTc) region of the retina, will remain ipsilateral, while the remaining 95% of RGCs will cross. This is largely controlled by the degree of binocular overlap between the two fields of sight in both eyes. Mice do not have a significant overlap, whereas, humans, who do, will have about 50% of RGCs cross and 50% will remain ipsilateral.

==== Building the repulsive outline of the chiasm ====
Once RGCs reach the chiasm, the glial cells supporting them will change from an intrafascicular to radial morphology. A group of diencephalic cells that express the cell surface antigen stage-specific embryonic antigen (SSEA)-1 and CD44 will form an inverted V-shape. They will establish the posterior aspect of the optic chiasm border. Additionally, Slit signaling is important here: Heparin sulfate proteoglycans, proteins in the ECM, will anchor the Slit morphogen at specific points in the posterior chiasm border. RGCs will begin to express Robo, the receptor for Slit, at this point, thus facilitating the repulsion.

==== Contralateral projecting RGCs ====
RGC axons traveling to the contralateral optic tract need to cross. Shh, expressed along the midline in the ventral diencephalon, provides a repulsive cue to prevent RGCs from crossing the midline ectopically. However, a hole is generated in this gradient, thus allowing RGCs to cross.

Molecules mediating attraction include NrCAM, which is expressed by growing RGCs and the midline glia and acts along with Sema6D, mediated via the plexin-A1 receptor. VEGF-A is released from the midline directs RGCs to take a contralateral path, mediated by the neuropilin-1 (NRP1) receptor. cAMP seems to be very important in regulating the production of NRP1 protein, thus regulating the growth cones response to the VEGF-A gradient in the chiasm.

==== Ipsilateral projecting RGCs ====
The only component in mice projecting ipsilaterally are RGCs from the ventral-temporal crescent in the retina, and only because they express the Zic2 transcription factor. Zic2 will promote the expression of the tyrosine kinase receptor EphB1, which, through forward signaling (see review by Xu et al.) will bind to ligand ephrin B2 expressed by midline glia and be repelled to turn away from the chiasm. Some VTc RGCs will project contralaterally because they express the transcription factor Islet-2, which is a negative regulator of Zic2 production.

Shh plays a key role in keeping RGC axons ipsilateral as well. Shh is expressed by the contralaterally projecting RGCs and midline glial cells. Boc, or Brother of CDO (CAM-related/downregulated by oncogenes), a co-receptor for Shh that influences Shh signaling through Ptch1, seems to mediate this repulsion, as it is only on growth cones coming from the ipsilaterally projecting RGCs.

Other factors influencing ipsilateral RGC growth include the Teneurin family, which are transmembrane adhesion proteins that use homophilic interactions to control guidance, and Nogo, which is expressed by midline radial glia. The Nogo receptor is only expressed by VTc RGCs.

Finally, other transcription factors seem to play a significant role in altering. For example, Foxg1, also called Brain-Factor 1, and Foxd1, also called Brain Factor 2, are winged-helix transcription factors that are expressed in the nasal and temporal optic cups and the optic vesicles begin to evaginate from the neural tube. These factors are also expressed in the ventral diencephalon, with Foxd1 expressed near the chiasm, while Foxg1 is expressed more rostrally. They appear to play a role in defining the ipsilateral projection by altering expression of Zic2 and EphB1 receptor production.

=== Growth in the optic tract ===
Once out of the optic chiasm, RGCs will extend dorsocaudally along the ventral diencephalic surface making the optic tract, which will guide them to the superior colliculus and lateral geniculate nucleus in the mammals, or the tectum in lower vertebrates. Sema3d seems to be promote growth, at least in the proximal optic tract, and cytoskeletal re-arrangements at the level of the growth cone appear to be significant.

== Myelination ==
In most mammals, the axons of retinal ganglion cells are not myelinated where they pass through the retina. However, the parts of axons that are beyond the retina, are myelinated. This myelination pattern is functionally explained by the relatively high opacity of myelin—myelinated axons passing over the retina would absorb some of the light before it reaches the photoreceptor layer, reducing the quality of vision. There are human eye diseases where this does, in fact, happen. In some vertebrates, such as the chicken, the ganglion cell axons are myelinated inside the retina.

<text>A study, also known as a [[Small office/home office|home office]], is a room in a house that is used for paperwork, computer work, or reading. Historically, the study of a house was reserved for use as the private office and reading room of a parent/guardian as the formal head of a household, but studies are today generally used to operate a home business or open to the whole family.

==History==

The study developed from the closet or cabinet of the Renaissance era. From the beginning of the 18th century onwards, increased literacy at the middle-class family level led to the setting aside of closed study and library areas within larger houses. There, commercial work, reading, correspondence, fact-recording and other activities could be undertaken in privacy and silence. Until well into the 20th century, gender restrictions on social roles made the domestic study an essentially male facility. The 19th-century clergyman would prepare sermons and interview parishioners in his study, and his equally literate wife would undertake her social obligations in a nearby parlour. 

The Internet has led to a transformation of the historic study with its localized functions into the present day home-office. The technological revolution has enabled individuals to engage in remote work while still being productive using the Internet, email, e-commerce, and videotelephony.

Government statistics record that in Britain 4.2 million people worked exclusively from home in 2014; an increase of 31% from the 1998 figure.

<text>Shannon Lee Tweed Simmons (born March 10, 1957) is a Canadian model and actress. One of the most successful actresses of mainstream erotica, she is identified with the genre of the erotic thriller cinema. Tweed has appeared in more than 60 films and several television series. She was named &quot;Playboy&quot;″s Playmate of the Year in 1982.

Tweed is also known for &quot;Gene Simmons Family Jewels&quot;, a reality TV show that portrayed the life of her family from 2006 until 2012. She is married to Gene Simmons, bassist and co-lead singer of the band Kiss; Tweed and Simmons have two children, Nicholas Adam Tweed-Simmons and Sophie Alexandra Tweed-Simmons.

== Early life ==

Tweed was born on March 10, 1957, in St. John&#x27;s, Newfoundland. She is the daughter of Donald Keith Tweed, a mink rancher, and Louise () Tweed, and was raised on a mink ranch in Whitbourne. She is one of seven children and has three sisters, including actress Tracy Tweed.

After Donald Tweed fell into a coma after a car crash, Louise moved with her children to her mother&#x27;s home in Saskatoon, Saskatchewan, and studied nursing while the family survived on welfare. Shannon had breast enhancement surgery at the age of 20 and subsequently became involved in beauty pageants.

== Career ==

In 1978, Tweed was the third runner-up in the Miss Ottawa event and won the Miss Canada talent competition for her singing.

After the Canadian wish-fulfilment TV show &quot;Thrill of a Lifetime&quot; arranged for her to pose for &quot;Playboy&quot; magazine, Tweed was chosen to be the Playmate of the Month for the November 1981 issue, and eventually the Playmate of the Year for 1982. Tweed and her sister Tracy appeared together in a &quot;Playboy&quot; spread.

Tweed primarily acted in B movies and in television series such as the HBO comedy &quot;1st and Ten&quot; and the prime-time soap opera &quot;Falcon Crest&quot;, She also appeared in an episode of &quot;The Dukes of Hazzard&quot; as well as &quot;Married... with Children&quot;. In 1985, she landed a year-long role on &quot;Days of Our Lives&quot; as Savannah Wilder. Tweed has appeared as a guest on &quot;Frasier&quot;. She has also lent her voice to the Nickelodeon cartoon &quot;SpongeBob SquarePants&quot; in the episode &quot;20,000 Patties Under the Sea&quot;, which also featured Gene Simmons as a guest.

The first major theatrical film in which Tweed appeared was the horror film &quot;Of Unknown Origin&quot; (1983). Since then, Tweed has appeared in more than 60 films, including &quot;Detroit Rock City&quot;, produced by Simmons, in 1999. Tweed and her sister Tracy co-starred in the film &quot;Night Eyes 3.&quot; She is known as one of the most successful actresses of mainstream erotica. &quot;Vanity Fair&quot; has described Tweed as &quot;one of home video&#x27;s most rented erotic thriller goddesses&quot;.

Tweed was featured along with her family on the reality TV show &quot;Gene Simmons Family Jewels&quot; from 2006 until 2012. One of the highlights of the series was Simmons&#x27; proposal to her and their subsequent marriage at the Beverly Hills Hotel in Beverly Hills, California. In 2010, an episode of the series was taped in Tweed&#x27;s former hometown of Saskatoon. During the visit, she was presented with an honorary street sign denoting the (nonexistent) &quot;Tweed Lane&quot;. Tourism Saskatoon subsequently requested Saskatoon City Council approve the naming of a real Tweed Lane in her honour. The Council approved the request, and the street is located in the neighbourhood of Rosewood.

Tweed is the narrator of the reality TV show &quot;Ex-Wives of Rock&quot;.

== Personal life ==

Tweed resided at the Playboy Mansion for approximately 14 months as &quot;Playboy&quot; founder Hugh Hefner&#x27;s partner. The relationship coincided with her Playmate appearances and with being named 1982 Playmate of the Year. The Mansion was the location of her first meeting with her future husband, musician Gene Simmons. Tweed has been in a relationship with Simmons since 1983. In a 2011 interview, Simmons said, &quot;I need Shannon in my life. Not just because of love and family but because she holds me accountable.&quot; After 28 years together, the couple wed in an outdoor evening ceremony on the crystal lawn of The Beverly Hills Hotel on October 1, 2011.

<doc id="801785" wikidata="Q267734" url="?curid=801785" title="Laundry room">
<text>A laundry room or utility room is a room where clothes are washed, and sometimes also dried. In a modern home, laundry rooms are often equipped with an automatic washing machine and clothes dryer, and often a large basin, called a &quot;laundry tub&quot;, for hand-washing of delicate clothing articles such as sweaters, as well as an ironing board. Laundry rooms may also include storage cabinets, countertops for folding clothes, and, space permitting, a small sewing machine.

The term &quot;utility room&quot; is more commonly used in British English, while Australian English and North American English generally refer to this room as a &quot;laundry&quot;, except in the American Southeast. &quot;Utility&quot; refers to an item which is designed for usefulness or practical use, so in turn most of the items kept in this room have functional attributes, i.e. &quot;form follows function&quot;.

==History==
The utility room was a modern spin off to the scullery room where important kitchen items were kept during its usage in England, the term was further defined around the 14th century as a household department where kitchen items are taken care of. The term utility room was mentioned in 1760, when a cottage was built in a rural location in the United Kingdom that was accessible through Penarth and Cardiff. A utility room for general purposes also depicted its use as a guest room in case of an immediate need. A 1944 Scottish housing and planning report recommended new state-built homes for families could provide a utility room as a general purpose workroom for the home (for washing clothes, cleaning boots and jobbing repairs). An American publication called the &quot;Pittsburgh Post-Gazette&quot; reported on July 24, 1949 that utility rooms had become more popular than basements in new constructions. On June 28, 1959, in a report of a typical American house being built in Moscow, Russia, the house was described to have a utility room immediately at the right side after the entrance. The &quot;Chicago Tribune&quot; reported that the laundry room was then commonly being referred to as the utility room in a publication on September 30, 1970.

==Uses==
The utility room has several uses but typically functions as an area to do laundry. This room contains laundry equipment such as a washing machine, tumble dryer, ironing boards and clothes iron. The room is also used for closet organization and storage. The room would normally contain a second coat closet which is used to store seasonal clothing such as winter coats or clothing which are no longer used daily. Storage spaces would contain other appliances which would generally be in the kitchen if it was in usage daily. Furnaces and the water heater are sometime incorporated to the room as well. Shelving and trash may sometimes be seen at this area as not to congest the other parts of the house.

== Location ==
In older homes, the laundry is typically located in the basement, but in many modern homes, the laundry room might be found on the main floor near the kitchen or, less often, upstairs near the bedrooms.

Another typical location is adjacent to the garage and the laundry room serves as a mudroom for the entrance from the garage. As the garage is often at a different elevation (or grade) from the rest of the house, the laundry room serves as an entrance from the garage that may be sunken from the rest of the house. This prevents or reduces the need for stairs between the garage and the house.

Most houses in the United Kingdom do not have laundry rooms; as such, the washing machine and dryer are usually located in the kitchen or garage.

In Hungary, some older apartment buildings and most workers&#x27; hostels have communal laundry rooms, called (lit. &quot;washing kitchen&quot;) in Hungarian. In the former, when residents started to all own individual washing machines in their apartments, obsoleted laundry rooms were sometimes converted into small apartments, shops or workshops (e.g. a shoemaker&#x27;s) or used simply for storage.

In Sweden, laundry rooms, called a &quot;tvättstuga&quot;, are found in almost all older apartment buildings. Swedish laundry rooms are often located in the basements of the buildings, but can also be found in detached buildings. In the 1980s, analogue booking boards with locking cylinders were introduced to regulate washing times and create a booking system. Some of these have been replaced in the 2000s by electronic counterparts with electronic keys or tokens.

<text>A bonus room, flex room, multiuse room or spare room (though the latter often means an extra bedroom) is a room created by remodeling or adding an addition that does not meet local building code definitions for traditional rooms, or is designed for multiple possible uses. For example, codes will typically require that a bedroom have a window and a certain number of electrical outlets. Such a room might actually be intended for sleeping, but will be described as a &quot;bonus room&quot; in rental and sales listings.

==Etymology==
The term &quot;bonus room&quot; is mainly used in the United States. One early use is from &quot;The New York Times&quot; in 1991, which wrote that &quot;A recent solution to the problem of noisy teen-agers is the enticingly titled bonus room, which is a spare room on the bedroom floor that can be used as a den, television room or guest room.&quot;

<doc id="801790" wikidata="Q3628982" url="?curid=801790" title="Atléticos de San Germán">
<text>Atléticos de San Germán is a basketball club of the Baloncesto Superior Nacional (BSN) based in San Germán, Puerto Rico.

Founded in the 1930s after the amalgamation of the old San Germán team and the Farmacia Martín team, the team is one of the original BSN franchises. The Athletics play their home games at the Arquelio Torres Ramírez Coliseum. The franchise&#x27;s fourteen championships are tied with the Leones de Ponces for the second most of any BSN franchise, and account for 16.8% of all BSN championships since the league&#x27;s tournaments began in 1930. This makes the &quot;Atléticos de San Germán&quot; the most successful basketball club to date of all professional sports franchises in the western part of Puerto Rico and the town itself is known as &quot;La cuna del baloncesto en Puerto Rico&quot; (the cradle of basketball in Puerto Rico).

Their mascot &quot;The Orange Monster&quot; is a part of the team&#x27;s image, featuring prominently in its logo and being the club nickname for decades. The team&#x27;s nickname is &quot;El monstruo anaranjado&quot; &quot;The Orange Monster&quot;)

The Athletics rise again after struggling through the 1950s, 1960s and 1970s to win a championship in 1985 over the Mets de Guaynabo. Following the 1985 championship, San Germán began to develop many young, talented players who would later lead them to three more championships within the next twelve years.

==History==

During the 1930s and 40s the team was undoubtedly the best in the league, winning ten championships between 1932 and 1950, including many by local basketball legend Arquelio Torres Ramírez. Torres Ramírez is fondly remembered as &quot;El Pequeño Titán&quot; (The little titan) and is still San Germán&#x27;s most notorious player. After his sudden death in 1949, the team went in a downwards spiral; making several finals appearances but failing to win a championship until the aforementioned one in 1985. The first title after 1985 came in 1991 when development of the talented young players peaked. Under the guidance and stellar play of José &quot;Piculín&quot; Ortíz the &quot;Atléticos&quot; won their second championship in six years. The 1991 team, however was quite different from the &#x27;85 team. It was very young (with the exception of Ortíz) and for that reason it had received, during the latter years of the 80&#x27;s decade, the nickname of &quot;Los Nenes&quot; (The boys or &quot;The kids&quot;). It included Eddie Casiano, Nelson Quiñones, Luis Allende, Yan Garcia and Oscar Santiago, the core of the Atléticos who won the championship in 1994.

Soon after, public feuds between Ortíz and the team owner led the star center to move to Europe to play in Greece. The young players then reaching the height of their careers then won another championship for San Germán. In 1997, Eddie Casiano carried the team to victory over an underdog Carolina team. The great play of Quiñones and Casiano led San Germán to their league leading 14th championship.

A change of ownership and more disputes eventually led San Germán to trade Eddie Casiano to the Leones de Ponce. Ortíz returned from Europe, but was then traded to the Cangrejeros de Santurce. Both players have won championships with their respective teams while San Germán is still in the hunt for the 15th championship.

<doc id="801791" wikidata="Q13322719" url="?curid=801791" title="Ming the Merciless">
<text>Ming the Merciless is a fictional character who first appeared in the &quot;Flash Gordon&quot; comic strip in 1934. He has since been the main villain of the strip and its related movie serials, television series and film adaptation. Ming is depicted as a ruthless tyrant who rules the planet Mongo.

==Alex Raymond&#x27;s comic strip==
In the comic strip, when the heroic Flash Gordon and his friends land on the fictional planet Mongo, they find it ruled by an evil emperor, a despot who quickly becomes their enemy. He was not named at first, only being known as &quot;&quot;The&quot; &quot;Emperor&quot;&quot; until several issues later, when his name was revealed to be &quot;Ming&quot;.

The capital of his empire is named Mingo City in his honour. In addition to his army, Ming is shown to have access to a wide variety of science fiction gadgets, ranging from rocket ships to death rays to robots. Though evil, he has his weaknesses, which include a desire to marry Flash&#x27;s beautiful companion, Dale Arden. Ming&#x27;s daughter Princess Aura is as evil as he is when the series begins, but is eventually reformed by her love for Flash, and later for Prince Barin of Arboria.

Flash and his companions escape from Ming&#x27;s clutches and find allies among the peoples of Mongo, including Barin, Prince Vultan, Prince Thun and Queen Fria. They organise a resistance movement against Ming&#x27;s rule; the action of the resistance takes up much of the strip&#x27;s story-lines. Ming was eventually overthrown, and Raymond pitted Flash against other enemies in the 1940s.

==Later comic strips==
During Austin Briggs&#x27;s run on the &quot;Flash Gordon&quot; strip, he introduced Ming&#x27;s son, Kang the Cruel. Kang became Flash&#x27;s main antagonist during Briggs&#x27; run.

In the 1956 story &quot;Return to Mongo&quot;, Dan Barry introduced Ming&#x27;s identical son, Ming II. This Ming behaved similarly to his father and became a semi-regular antagonist for Flash in Barry&#x27;s strips. In the 1957 story &quot;The Time Pendulum&quot;, a descendant of Ming from the future, Ming XIII, travels back in time to kill Flash and thus ensure the victory of his ancestor. Jim Keefe used Ming as Flash&#x27;s main opponent during his run on the &quot;Flash Gordon&quot; comic strip.

==Comic books==
In the 2011 Dynamite Comics &quot;Flash Gordon: Zeitgeist&quot;, Ming is shown as attempting to invade Earth in the year 1934. As in the 1980 film, Ming&#x27;s main henchman is the masked Klytus. In this version Klytus has the full name Klytus Ra Djaaran, and is described as Ming&#x27;s Grand Vizier and head of Ming&#x27;s secret police. Ming is also shown as working with the Third Reich to conquer the planet. The prequel, &quot;Merciless: The Rise of Ming&quot; depicts Ming&#x27;s ascent to power over Mongo. &quot;Merciless&quot; depicts Ming as the son of Emperor Krang, and the husband of Auranae, who becomes Princess Aura&#x27;s mother.

In the later Dynamite Flash Gordon comic, &quot;King&#x27;s Watch&quot; (unconnected to the events in &quot;Flash Gordon: Zeitgeist&quot;) Ming uses a dimensional portal to send his troops to the planet Earth. Flash, Dale and Zarkov travel to Mongo
to stop Ming&#x27;s attack. In the sequel story, &quot;Flash Gordon:The Man from Earth&quot;, Dale Arden learns that Ming uses special &quot;Quantum Crystals&quot; to expand his lifespan, and to travel to and conquer other star systems. Ming also forces some of Prince Barin&#x27;s subjects to be enslaved, brainwashed, and turned into &quot;Beastmen&quot; warriors for Ming&#x27;s army. Flash also witnesses a Mongo propaganda video which reveals Ming&#x27;s full title as &quot;Ming Gorzon-Hydraxus of Seledarqu&quot;.

==In other media==
===Radio===
In the 1935 adaptation, &quot;The Amazing Interplanetary Adventures of Flash Gordon&quot;, Bruno Wick played Ming the Merciless.

===Films===
====&quot;Flash Gordon&quot; (serials)====
In the &quot;Flash Gordon&quot; serials of the late 1930s-era, Ming was portrayed by actor Charles B. Middleton. In the first serial, he is apparently killed in the Great Temple of Tao, in a possible suicide. He returns in the second serial in league with a Martian Queen, and using a Nitron Lamp to cause disasters on Earth. Instead of his stereotypical yellow peril appearance, he takes on a form resembling Satan in this serial. In &quot;Flash Gordon Conquers the Universe&quot; (1940), he is once again ruler of Mongo, but is killed when he is locked inside his tower and Flash crashes a ship into it. Ming takes on a Hitler-like persona in this pre WWII 1940 serial with references to him as &quot;Dictator&quot; and his wearing of elaborate military uniforms.

====&quot;Flash Gordon&quot; film (1980)====

In the 1980 theatrical film, Ming (Max von Sydow), complaining of boredom, discovers Earth and unleashes various attacks on the planet. The film gives Ming a second-in-command, General Klytus, who is masked at all times and is attracted to Ming&#x27;s daughter, Princess Aura. As in most versions, Ming is infatuated with Dale, whom he plans to marry. Ming&#x27;s cruelty extends to his own daughter: in an effort to find Flash, he allows Klytus to continue torturing her, since she knows of his whereabouts. When Klytus is killed in the Hawkman city, Ming orders it to be destroyed. He offers Flash a chance to join him, rule a kingdom, and save Earth. Flash declines when he learns the Earth will be enslaved. Ming leaves him there to die, but Flash escapes on a rocket cycle.

At the climax of the film, Ming is impaled by his own war rocket, &quot;Ajax&quot;, of which Flash had taken control. After a vain attempt to stop Flash attacking him, he ultimately points his ring at himself and he vanishes. However, just before the credits begin, his ring is retrieved by an unknown individual, and the words &quot;The End?&quot; appear, as his evil laughter plays in the background, hinting he is not dead and has managed to transcend the narrative world of the film and infect our reality.

The soundtrack album by the rock band Queen includes &quot;Ming&#x27;s Theme&quot;.

===Television===
====&quot;The New Adventures of Flash Gordon&quot; (1979)====
In this 1979 animated version of Flash Gordon. Ming&#x27;s voice was provided by Vic Perrin in the pilot movie; in the series he was replaced by Alan Oppenheimer, who would later go on to voice Skeletor in He-Man. In this version, Ming&#x27;s panoply is vividly displayed in the form of his vast fleet of battleships, drone rockets, armored trains, and his army of robots. He also employs Mongo&#x27;s race of Lizard-Women as his enforcers in the mines of Mongo, as well as guards in his harem, and the primitive Beast-Men of Mongo not only serve him, but revere him as a god. In the fourth episode, &quot;To Save Earth&quot;, Ming claims to be immortal.

====&quot;Defenders of the Earth&quot; animated series (1986–1987)====
Ming served as the principal adversary in the 1980s Marvel animated series &quot;Defenders of the Earth&quot;, fighting against other King Features characters such as The Phantom, Mandrake the Magician, Lothar, and of course Flash Gordon. In the opening episode, Ming successfully captures Dale Arden Gordon and her son Rick, and tears Dale&#x27;s mind from her body, prompting a vengeful Flash to pursue him back to Earth to avenge her and prevent Ming from enslaving his world. Ming&#x27;s base on Earth is in the depths of The Arctic and is called Ice Station Earth; his allies in this series are Garax, leader of the &quot;Men of Frost&quot;, Ming&#x27;s army of Ice Men, and Octon, a large tentacled battle computer.

This version of Ming also includes a son rather than a daughter at his side, Prince Kro-Tan; unlike Aura, he holds no love for any of the Defenders and considers both them and his father hindrances to his enslavement of the galaxy. Kro-Tan comes the closest to defeating his father in a five-part story where he successfully entraps Ming and takes over his forces, before Ming is released by the Defenders and takes his vengeance. Ming has two carrier spacecraft in this series, one of which is his &quot;Throne Room&quot;, his main vessel, which could launch itself from the Arctic Ocean. This version is made more grotesque than his traditional appearance to avoid racial stereotyping, being portrayed as having green skin and pointed ears.

====&quot;Flash Gordon&quot; animated series (1996)====
In the 1996 animated series, Ming looks even more reptilian: he is a green, pointy-eared, sharp-toothed scaly alien, which cause the heroes to call him a &quot;lizard&quot;. (Meanwhile, Aura has green skin, but is otherwise perfectly human.) In this version, Ming is presented as a more light-hearted, comic relief type of character.

====&quot;Flash Gordon&quot; television series (2007–2008)====
In the 2007 Sci-Fi Channel television series, Ming is portrayed by John Ralston as a clean shaven blond Caucasian. Executive producer David Hume has said that this interpretation of the character is &quot;a Saddam Hussein kind of tyrant&quot;.

This version of Ming the Merciless is a media-savvy tyrant, who controls the planet through a monopoly on the production of clean water. He uses this control to extort wealth and obedience from the populace. He dresses in a quasi-military garb and seems to have some sort of militaristic position in addition to his role as a Water Baron and emperor. Ming&#x27;s primary assistant in this story is Rankol, a cyborg who is an expert technologist.

Although as evil as ever, Ming is known as and addressed as &quot;Benevolent Father&quot;. However, his people call him Ming the Merciless, because of his harsh and often brutal leadership. Ming was also known as Ming the Merciless during his military career and rise to power. He justifies everything he does as maintaining order and preventing a return to the chaos that occurred before he took power. Ming is depicted as having a son, Terek, whom he ordered killed at birth for being a Deviate. Later, it is revealed that Terek is not only alive, but that Terek&#x27;s mother comes from a pure bloodline; this means that Ming is the source of Terek&#x27;s deviation.

After Flash frees the planet&#x27;s water reserves, the people of Mongo revolt against Ming when they discover that he has poisoned the planet&#x27;s drinking water. Ming forms an alliance with Azura and her warriors in exchange for making her his queen, her army would battle against the rebels. She gives him an amulet. Ming is captured after a battle with Flash Gordon and Aura. Terek orders his execution. When Aura coldly tells her father &#x27;good-bye&#x27;, Ming finally admits he is proud of his daughter. Ming is placed inside a gas chamber. As the chamber filled with gas, Ming vanishes, having been teleported to safety by Azura&#x27;s amulet.

==Reception==
Ming has often been connected to the Yellow Peril imagery of the era, in which tyrannous East Asian villains such as Fu Manchu were common. His East Asian appearance, his name, referencing the Ming dynasty of China, and the name of his planet Mongo, &quot;a contraction of Mongol&quot;, contribute to his Oriental identity.

Jonathan C. Friedman says that Ming and Fu Manchu were &quot;the incarnations of the yellow peril in the Oriental crusade to conquer the world&quot;. Peter Feng calls him a &quot;futuristic Yellow Peril&quot;, quoting a reviewer who referred to him as a &quot;slanty eyed, shiny domed, pointy nailed, arching eyebrowed, exotically dressed Oriental&quot;.

According to Jim Harmon and Donald Glut, while Ming is modeled on Fu Manchu in the first &quot;Gordon&quot; serial, his appearance copies imagery of the devil in the second serial, &quot;Flash Gordon&#x27;s Trip to Mars&quot;.

==In popular culture==

Many parodies of Ming the Merciless have appeared in popular culture, including:
* &quot;Muffet the Mericiless&quot; in Ralph Bakshi&#x27;s holiday special &quot;Christmas in Tattertown&quot;
* &quot;Mung the Mirthless&quot; in Wally Wood&#x27;s comic strip &quot;Sally Forth&quot;
* &quot;Wang the Perverted&quot; in the sexploitation film &quot;Flesh Gordon&quot;
* &quot;Count Zarth Arn&quot; in the B movie space opera &quot;Starcrash&quot;
* &quot;Gorzo the Mighty&quot;, a columnist for &quot;The Onion&quot;
* &quot;Ding the Merciless&quot;, an opponent of Trash Gordon in one segment on &quot;Sesame Street&quot;
* &quot;Moo-ing the Merciless&quot;, enemy of Lash Holstein, Space Cow-det in one episode of &quot;Muppets Tonight&quot;
* &quot;Supreme Overlord Maximus IQ&quot;, the main villain on the animated series &quot;Atomic Betty&quot;
* &quot;Dr. Chaotica&quot; on &quot;Star Trek: Voyager&quot; as a Holodeck character in the episodes &quot;Bride of Chaotica!&quot;, &quot;Night&quot; and &quot;Shattered&quot;.
* &quot;Mandrake the Malfeasant&quot; on the animated series &quot;Wander Over Yonder&quot; – he appears only in the episodes &quot;The Loose Screw&quot; and &quot;The Battle Royale&quot;.

Australian Prime Minister Sir Robert Menzies was nicknamed Ming the Merciless in part due to his preference for the traditional Scottish pronunciation of his surname. As a further extension of this nickname, the eponymous R G Menzies building at Monash University became colloquially known as the &quot;Ming Wing&quot;. Scottish politician Menzies Campbell is sometimes nicknamed (with significant irony) &quot;Ming the Merciless&quot;. Luke &#x27;Ming&#x27; Flanagan, the Irish politician and cannabis legalisation campaigner, takes his name from his resemblance to Ming the Merciless.

In the 1989 edition of the &quot;Star Wars Sourcebook&quot; by Bill Slavicsek and Curtis Smith, a photograph of Max Von Sydow as Ming the Merciless from &quot;Flash Gordon&quot; is used to represent the character of the Grand Inquisitor, later voiced by Jason Isaacs in the first two seasons of the animated series &quot;Star Wars Rebels&quot; and portrayed by Rupert Friend in the Disney+ series &quot;Obi-Wan Kenobi&quot;.

In the &quot;Father Ted&quot; episode &quot;Are You Right There Father Ted?&quot;, Ming is in one of Ted&#x27;s slides to show he&#x27;s not anti-Chinese as a joke because Ming is often criticised as a negative Chinese stereotype.

The British surreal sketch show &quot;Big Train&quot; features a Ming-style villain, portrayed by Mark Heap, going about mundane household tasks such as checking his answer phone and vacuuming.

Charles B. Middleton&#x27;s portrayal of Ming from the 1930s serials appears during the opening titles of the Spanish dramedy &quot;The Last Circus&quot; (2010) by Alex de la Iglesia, along with classic movie monsters such as the Phantom of the Opera, Frankenstein&#x27;s monster and Wolfman.

George Lucas has cited Ming the Merciless as a basis for Emperor Palpatine and Darth Vader from the &quot;Star Wars&quot; series.

Gene Wolfe&#x27;s 1976 short story about the aftermath of a psychological experiment is called &quot;When I Was Ming the Merciless&quot;.

An October 2001 installment of the comic strip Get Your War On by David Rees featured one of the characters joking that George W. Bush would reveal himself to be Ming the Merciless at a press conference.

In 2007, Ming the Merciless was ranked number 2 on the &quot;Forbes&quot; Fictional 15. The &quot;Chicago Sun-Times&quot; called him &quot;the ultimate sci-fi tyrant&quot;, and &quot;The Irish Times&quot; wrote that he is &quot;simply the best – the tyrant&#x27;s tyrant&quot;.

Robert Wu portrays Quan Ming, who transforms into a version of Ming the Merciless during an hallucination that Sam J. Jones (the actor who plays Flash Gordon in the 1980 film) has in Seth MacFarlane&#x27;s film, &quot;Ted&quot; (2012).

In the 2012 young adult novel &quot;Eleanor and Park&quot;, protagonist Eleanor Douglas puts eyeliner on her Korean American love interest Park Sheridan and makes a comment saying that he looks like Ming the Merciless; this quote is among many instances of the book that were accused of racism.

<text>A family room is an informal, all-purpose room in a house. The family room is designed to be a place where family and guests gather for group recreation like talking, reading, watching TV, and other family activities. Often, the family room is located adjacent to the kitchen, and at times, flows into it with no visual breaks. A family room often has doors leading to the back yard and specific outdoor living areas such as a deck, garden, or terrace.

The term &quot;family room&quot; is defined in the 1945 book &quot;Tomorrow&#x27;s House&quot; by George Nelson and Henry Wright. Chapter 7, entitled &quot;The Room Without a Name&quot; spoke of the need in modern life for a new &quot;biggest room in the house&quot; that would serve the social and recreational needs of the entire family, allowing activities that would not be permitted in the living room.

This &quot;big room&quot; would have furnishings and materials that were &quot;tough&quot;, for hard use, and it should be easy to clean. In contrast with the existing &quot;rumpus rooms&quot; of the time, it would occasionally serve for slightly more formal entertainment, so it should be a handsome room and should have cupboards where toys, tools, etc. could be kept out of sight. 
The distinction between a family room, living room, and recreation room is fluid, but can be classified according to three characteristics: location, function and design. Football games on large color televisions made family rooms large enough for parents and children more popular during the 1970s. In homes with more than one, the family room is less formal, both in function and furnishings and is located away from the main entrance, while the living room is usually the more formal, reserved for guests, special occasions and the display of items such as antiques or artwork. It is typically located in the central part of the house towards the front. The recreation room is typically in the basement and used for games and playtime.

In homes with only one, the terms are generally used interchangeably. In floorplans, a &quot;great room&quot; is where the living room and family room are combined into one high-ceilinged room adjacent to the kitchen.

<doc id="801802" wikidata="Q3986036" url="?curid=801802" title="The Bobs">
<text>The Bobs were an a cappella vocal group founded in San Francisco, California, in the early 1980s. They moved to Seattle, Washington, and were active recording and touring throughout the United States, Canada and Europe until their farewell show at the Barns at Wolf Trap in Vienna, VA, on October 21, 2017.

==History==
===Formation===
Founding members Gunnar Madsen and Matthew Stull decided to form an a cappella group when they left their jobs as deliverers of singing telegrams in San Francisco. 

Members of the group are always credited with &quot;Bob&quot; as their middle name. The name is often described as an acronym for &quot;Best of Breed&quot;, an award given out at dog shows. Another story that the Bobs give is the name was shortened from &quot;The Oral Roberts&quot; in the first months the group performed together.

===Approach and notable performances===
Instead of singing more traditional doo-wop songs, The Bobs started out with original arrangements of their own songs and songs like &quot;Helter Skelter&quot; and &quot;Psycho Killer&quot;. Although two of their albums are dominated by songs written by others, the overwhelming majority of their repertoire is original, with songs discussing a diverse array of humorous subjects.

The Bobs have broken with a cappella tradition several times by including instruments. The majority of the 1995 album &quot;Plugged&quot; is backed by toy drums. &quot;Plugged&quot; also made heavy use of studio equipment to make the voices sound more like guitars and bass guitars. &quot;Coaster&quot; includes a rock rhythm section on one song. &quot;Rhapsody in Bob&quot; features their arrangement of Gershwin&#x27;s &quot;Rhapsody in Blue&quot; with pianist Bob Malone playing most of the original piano concerto as The Bobs become a vocal orchestra. But this original &quot;band without instruments&quot; usually uses just their mouths, hands, feet and &quot;other body parts&quot;.

Several anniversary concerts were held in Berkeley, California in January 2006 to celebrate the 25th Anniversary of the Bobs. These concerts featured seven of the eight singers who have ever been in the band.

The Bobs gave their final performance on October 21, 2017, at The Barns at Wolf Trap, Virginia. It was broadcast live at Acaville.org.

===Soundtrack contributions===
The Bobs performed &quot;Psycho Killer&quot; on the revival of &quot;The Smothers Brothers Comedy Hour&quot; in 1988.
The Bobs supplied the opening music for the documentary &quot;I&#x27;m from Hollywood&quot; starring inter-gender wrestling champion Andy Kaufman, directed by Lynne Margulies and Joe Orr. The song was played at the beginning of the Kaufman biopic, &quot;Man on the Moon&quot;

The Bobs&#x27; recording of the Jimmy Cliff/Guilly Bright song &quot;Sittin&#x27; In Limbo&quot; was featured in the 1991 movie &quot;Cool As Ice&quot;.

The Bobs&#x27; recording of the song &quot;Barbara Ann&quot; was used in the 1993 movie &quot;Surf Ninjas&quot;.

In the 1995 Jason Alexander movie &quot;For Better or Worse&quot;, the Bobs performed most of the soundtrack, including the background music that occasionally interacted with the story. During the 1995 Emmys they performed a medley of television themes with Alexander.

In 1996, the Bobs performed several original songs and provided the character voices for the online video game &quot;Castle Infinity&quot;.

===Recognition===
Their arrangement of &quot;Helter Skelter&quot; was nominated for a Grammy Award in 1984.

A documentary about the group, called &quot;Sign My Snarling Movie: 25 Years of The Bobs&quot; was released in summer 2007.

<doc id="801809" wikidata="Q1546264" url="?curid=801809" title="Kasiski examination">
<text>In cryptanalysis, Kasiski examination (also known as Kasiski&#x27;s test or Kasiski&#x27;s method) is a method of attacking polyalphabetic substitution ciphers, such as the Vigenère cipher. It was first published by Friedrich Kasiski in 1863, but seems to have been independently discovered by Charles Babbage as early as 1846.

== How it works ==
In polyalphabetic substitution ciphers where the substitution alphabets are chosen by the use of a keyword, the Kasiski examination allows a cryptanalyst to deduce the length of the keyword. Once the length of the keyword is discovered, the cryptanalyst lines up the ciphertext in &quot;n&quot; columns, where &quot;n&quot; is the length of the keyword. Then each column can be treated as the ciphertext of a monoalphabetic substitution cipher. As such, each column can be attacked with frequency analysis. Similarly, where a rotor stream cipher machine has been used, this method may allow the deduction of the length of individual rotors.

The Kasiski examination involves looking for strings of characters that are repeated in the ciphertext. The strings should be three characters long or more for the examination to be successful. Then, the distances between consecutive occurrences of the strings are likely to be multiples of the length of the keyword. Thus finding more repeated strings narrows down the possible lengths of the keyword, since we can take the greatest common divisor of all the distances.

The reason this test works is that if a repeated string occurs in the plaintext, and the distance between corresponding characters is a multiple of the keyword length, the keyword letters will line up in the same way with both occurrences of the string. For example, consider the plaintext:

 the man and the woman retrieved the letter from the post office

The word &quot; is a repeated string, appearing multiple times. If we line up the plaintext with a 5-character keyword &quot; :
 the man and the woman retrieved the letter from the post office

The word &quot;the&quot; is sometimes mapped to &quot;bea&quot;, sometimes to &quot;sbe&quot; and other times to &quot;ead&quot;. However, it is mapped to &quot;sbe&quot; twice, and in a long enough text, it would likely be mapped multiple times to each of these possibilities. Kasiski observed that the distance between such repeated appearances must be a multiple of the encryption period.

In this example, the period is 5, and the distance between the two occurrences of &quot;sbe&quot; is 30, which is 6 times the period. Therefore, the greatest common divisor of the distances between repeated sequences will reveal the key length or a multiple of it.

== A string-based attack ==
The difficulty of using the Kasiski examination lies in finding repeated strings. This is a very hard task to perform manually, but computers can make it much easier. However, care is still required, since some repeated strings may just be coincidence, so that some of the repeat distances are misleading. The cryptanalyst has to rule out the coincidences to find the correct length. Then, of course, the monoalphabetic ciphertexts that result must be cryptanalyzed.

# A cryptanalyst looks for repeated groups of letters and counts the number of letters between the beginning of each repeated group. For instance, if the ciphertext were , the distance between groups is 10. The analyst records the distances for all repeated groups in the text.
# The analyst next factors each of these numbers. If any number is repeated in the majority of these factorings, it is likely to be the length of the keyword. This is because repeated groups are more likely to occur when the same letters are encrypted using the same key letters than by mere coincidence; this is especially true for long matching strings. The key letters are repeated at multiples of the key length, so most of the distances found in step 1 are likely to be multiples of the key length. A common factor is usually evident.
# Once the keyword length is known, the following observation of Babbage and Kasiski comes into play. If the keyword is N letters long, then every Nth letter must have been enciphered using the same letter of the keytext. Grouping every Nth letter together, the analyst has N &quot;messages&quot;, each encrypted using a one-alphabet substitution, and each piece can then be attacked using frequency analysis.
# Using the solved message, the analyst can quickly determine what the keyword was. Or, in the process of solving the pieces, the analyst might use guesses about the keyword to assist in breaking the message.
# Once the interceptor knows the keyword, that knowledge can be used to read other messages that use the same key.

== Superimposition ==
Kasiski actually used &quot;superimposition&quot; to solve the Vigenère cipher. He started by finding the key length, as above. Then he took multiple copies of the message and laid them one-above-another, each one shifted left by the length of the key. Kasiski then observed that each &quot;column&quot; was made up of letters encrypted with a single alphabet. His method was equivalent to the one described above, but is perhaps easier to picture.

Modern attacks on polyalphabetic ciphers are essentially identical to that described above, with the one improvement of coincidence counting. Instead of looking for repeating groups, a modern analyst would take two copies of the message and lay one above another.

Modern analysts use computers, but this description illustrates the principle that the computer algorithms implement.

The generalized method:
# The analyst shifts the bottom message one letter to the left, then one more letters to the left, etc., each time going through the entire message and counting the number of times the same letter appears in the top and bottom message.
# The number of &quot;coincidences&quot; goes up sharply when the bottom message is shifted by a multiple of the key length, because then the adjacent letters are in the same language using the same alphabet.
# Having found the key length, cryptanalysis proceeds as described above using frequency analysis.

<text>The Twenty-eighth Dynasty of Egypt (notated Dynasty XXVIII, alternatively 28th Dynasty or Dynasty 28) is usually classified as the third dynasty of the Ancient Egyptian Late Period. The 28th Dynasty lasted from 404 BC to 398 BC and it includes only one Pharaoh, Amyrtaeus (Amenirdis), also known as Psamtik V or Psammetichus V. Amyrtaeus was probably the grandson of the Amyrtaeus of Sais, who carried on a rebellion in 465–463 BC with the Egyptian chief, Inarus (himself a grandson of Psamtik III), against the satrap Achaemenes of Achaemenid Egypt.

==History==
At the end of the 5th century BC, Amyrtaeus, a native Egyptian, revolted against Darius II, the Achaemenid Persian King and the last Pharaoh of the 27th Dynasty. Amyrtaeus succeeded in expelling the Persians from Memphis in 405 BC with assistance from Cretan mercenaries, and in 404 BC, following the death of Darius, proclaimed himself Pharaoh of Egypt. Artaxerxes II, Darius&#x27; successor as King of Persia, attempted to lead an expedition to retake Egypt but he failed to do so, due to political problems with his brother, Cyrus the Younger. This allowed Amyrtaeus to consolidate his rule over Egypt.

Very little is known about Amyrtaeus&#x27; reign. No monuments from this dynasty have been found.

In 398 BC Amyrtaeus was overthrown and executed by Nefaarud I, ending the 28th Dynasty and beginning the 29th Dynasty.

<text>Georgy Nikolayevich Babakin (; 13 November 1914 – 3 August 1971) was a Soviet engineer working in the space program. He was Chief Designer at the Lavochkin Design Bureau from 1965 until his death.

Babakin&#x27;s early career was spent in radio engineering, starting with a job at the Moscow telephone company in 1930, working on an urban radio network. From 1943 to 1949, Babakin worked on radar targeting systems at the Institute of Automation (VSNITO), where he became its chief engineer.

Babakin became involved in the Soviet space program in 1949, working in Boris Chertok&#x27;s division of NII-88 on surface-to-air missiles and targeting systems. In 1952, he was part of a group transferred to Lavochkin&#x27;s bureau OKB-301 to work on the intercontinental cruise missile Burya and the V-300 anti-aircraft missile.

In 1960, Semyon Lavochkin died at an aircraft show (literally died in Babakin&#x27;s arms), and the bureau was subsumed by Vladimir Chelomei. It became independent again in 1965, with Babakin as its chief designer. At that time, the planetary probe program was taken away from Sergei Korolev&#x27;s OKB-1 bureau and reassigned to OKB-301 due to its almost complete lack of success (not one Soviet planetary probe had succeeded since Luna 3 six years earlier).

Babakin&#x27;s new &quot;NPO Lavochkin&quot; brought improved engineering, testing and systems management to this problem, including proper bench and dynamics testing of components, something Korolev had never done. The effort began to bear fruit with the successful missions of Luna 9 and Venera 4 in 1966-67.

Babakin died of a heart attack at the age of 57 shortly before the completion of the Mars 2 and Mars 3 spacecraft, during Lunokhod-1 mission. His bureau continued with a series of impressive successes, the first Lunar rovers, landings on Venus and robotic sample return of Moon rocks. A research division of NPO Lavochkin is named after Babakin, and the firm continues to design and build spacecraft.

The crater Babakin on the Moon and Babakin on Mars were named in his honor. The Babakin Space Centre is named after him.

The G.N. Babakin Medal was established by the Russian Federation of Cosmonautics on December 6, 1996.

<doc id="801834" wikidata="Q3309212" url="?curid=801834" title="French dip">
<text>A French dip sandwich, also known as a beef dip, is a hot sandwich consisting of thinly sliced roast beef (or, sometimes, other meats) on a &quot;French roll&quot; or baguette.

It is usually served plain but a popular variation is to top with Swiss cheese, onions, and a dipping container of beef broth produced from the cooking process (termed &quot;au jus&quot;, &quot;with juice&quot;). Beef stock, a light beef gravy, or beef consommé is sometimes substituted. The sandwich is most commonly served with a cup on the side of the plate, into which the sandwich is dipped as it is eaten, although this is not how the sandwich was served when it was originally developed.

The sandwich is an American invention, with the name seeming to refer to the style of bread, rather than any French origin.

== History ==
Two Los Angeles restaurants have claimed to be the birthplace of the French dip sandwich: Cole&#x27;s Pacific Electric Buffet and Philippe the Original. Philippe&#x27;s website describes the dish as a &quot;specialty of the house&quot;, and the words &quot;Home of the Original French Dip Sandwich&quot; are present in the restaurant&#x27;s logo. At Phillippe&#x27;s, the roll is dipped in the hot beef juices before the sandwich is assembled, and is served &quot;wet&quot;, while at Cole&#x27;s it is served with a side of beef juices. The sandwich can also be requested &quot;double dipped&quot;, where both halves of the sandwich are dipped before serving, at either establishment. Both restaurants feature their own brand of spicy mustard.

The controversy over who originated the sandwich remains unresolved. Both restaurants were established in 1908. However, Cole&#x27;s claims to have originated the sandwich shortly after the restaurant opened in 1908, while Philippe&#x27;s claims that owner Philippe Mathieu invented it in 1918.

The story of the sandwich&#x27;s invention by Philippe&#x27;s has several variants: some sources say that it was first created by a cook or a server who, while preparing a sandwich for a police officer or fireman, accidentally dropped it into a pan of meat drippings. The patron liked it, and the dish surged in popularity shortly after its invention. Other accounts say that a customer who didn&#x27;t want some meat drippings to go to waste requested his sandwich be dipped in them. Still others say that a chef dipped a sandwich into a pan of meat drippings after a customer complained that the bread was stale. Cole&#x27;s account states that the sandwich was invented by a sympathetic chef, Jack Garlinghouse, for a customer who was complaining of sore gums. Some accounts tell Philippe&#x27;s version of events, but assign the location to Cole&#x27;s. The mystery of the sandwich&#x27;s invention might not be solved due to a lack of information and observable evidence.

=== Modern-day ===
The French dip is now served at a number of restaurant chains including fast food places, diners, and standard restaurants.

<text>Jules Antoine Lissajous (; 4 March 1822 in Versailles – 24 June 1880 in Plombières-les-Dijon) was a French physicist, after whom Lissajous figures are named. Among other innovations, Lissajous invented the Lissajous apparatus, a device that creates the figures that bear his name. In it, a beam of light is bounced off a mirror attached to a vibrating tuning fork, and then reflected off a second mirror attached to a perpendicularly oriented vibrating tuning fork (usually of a different pitch, creating a specific harmonic interval), onto a wall, resulting in a Lissajous figure. This led to the invention of other apparatus such as the harmonograph.

<doc id="801840" wikidata="Q7696855" url="?curid=801840" title="Telestrator">
<text>A telestrator is a device that allows its operator to draw a freehand sketch over a moving or still video image. Also known as a video marker, this device is often used in sports and weather broadcasts to diagram and analyze sports plays or incoming weather patterns. The user typically draws with a finger, stylus or pen on a touchscreen or graphics tablet. From the touchscreen or the tablet, the drawing signal is communicated to the telestrator, which overlays the video image with the drawing and outputs the combined signal for broadcast or display.

Today, the telestrator is used in a wide variety of applications (from educational, boardroom, church and military presentations to telemedicine conferences), where it can be used by both the near and far ends to annotate precise details of microscopic images or other medical images that are under consultation. The telestrator is also used in courtrooms to communicate details of multimedia images presented to a jury, as was most famously seen during the O. J. Simpson trial in March 1995.

==History==

The telestrator was invented by physicist Leonard Reiffel, who used it to draw illustrations on a series of science shows he did for public television&#x27;s WTTW in Chicago in the late 1950s.

The original Telestrator consisted of a storage tube oscilloscope with a television camera aimed at it. A storage tube is a special cathode-ray tube (CRT) that retains its image until deliberately erased. A second device was used to decode X and Y positions of a pen-like device held on a metal plate. These produced varying voltages that moved a corresponding dot around the face of the oscilloscope. Normally this was at low voltage, too low to &quot;write&quot; the image onto the CRT. When a button was pressed, the voltage was increased and the image began to be stored. The image was picked up by the television camera and mixed with main display, using a beam splitter or video mixer. A variety of methods were presented that allowed the pickup to be placed directly over a display of the main signal.

After he had been using it to help illustrate details to his young science audience, he approached Chicago&#x27;s CBS affiliate WBBM-TV suggesting it be used in sports and weather. Chicago Bears football player-turned-sportscaster Johnny Morris, who worked for Channel 2, began using it as did the station&#x27;s chief meteorologist. According to Reiffel, &quot;After that, New York began to hear about it, and it went on from there.&quot;

The user interface for early telestrators required the user to draw on a TV screen with a light pen, whereas modern implementations are commonly controlled with a touch screen or a graphics tablet.

The late NFL color commentator John Madden famously used a telestrator during football games for many years, boosting the device&#x27;s popularity. Because the telestrator was used for NFL game coverage as well as in former NFL player O. J. Simpson&#x27;s murder trial, this fact was exploited to humorous effect on a 1995 episode of &quot;Saturday Night Live&quot;, with Simpson inadvertently writing out &quot;I did it&quot; by using a telestrator as he explained a passage of play.

During his time as a color commentator for NBC and TNT of the NBA, Mike Fratello has been referred to as the &quot;Czar of the Telestrator&quot; by Marv Albert for his masterful way of diagramming basketball plays on screen.

Howie Meeker, NHL hockey color commentator and studio analyst, used the telestrator for many years on CBC&#x27;s &quot;Hockey Night in Canada&quot; to analyze plays during intermissions. He was famous for shouting instructions to the &quot;boys in the truck&quot; – such as &quot;Back it up! Back it up!&quot; and &quot;Stop it right there!&quot; – in his trademark squeaky voice.

Wrestling announcer Bobby Heenan briefly used a telestrator while in the then-World Wrestling Federation, calling it the &quot;Brain Scan&quot;. He would usually use it during post-match replays to doodle derogatory pictures or comments.

Reiffel won the 2004 National Academy of Television Arts and Sciences Emmy for his invention. He is one of two individuals to receive the award, which is usually given to companies and groups.

Today, telestrators are widely used in broadcasts of all major sports. They have also become a useful tool in televised weather reports. They are also used by Ian Waite on Britain&#x27;s &quot;Strictly Come Dancing: It Takes Two&quot; and humorously on the U.S. reality game show &quot;Wipeout&quot;, mostly by John Henson.

<text>Danger Girl is an American comic book series created by J. Scott Campbell and Andy Hartnell that started in March 1998 and is still published as a new series. The comic stars an eponymous group of three sexy female secret agents—Abbey Chase, Sydney Savage and Sonya Savage—who engage in adventures in the vein of other fictional characters like Charlie&#x27;s Angels, James Bond and Indiana Jones. They are led by a former British Secret Service Agent named Deuce and guided by teenage genius Silicon Valerie.

==Characters==
===Main===
; Abbey Chase: A champion marksman, virtuoso of languages, scholar of world history, and (most widely) a heart-stopping femme fatale. Though spending the majority of her young life as a loner, Abbey is both a team player and a natural leader. She began her career as a freelance treasure hunter working under the radar and outside the law. Abbey still finds herself trying to elude the many villainous characters she has crossed and outwitted in her pre-Danger Girl days. After bumping into the Danger Girls during one of her adventure-filled hunts, Abbey shepherded the ladies to victory in their first battle against the menacing Hammer Empire. Soon after, Abbey became a full-fledged member of this international covert-operations unit. She replaced Natalia Kassle as DG&#x27;s field-commander.
; Sydney Savage: The sassy and vivacious Danger Girl who fittingly originates from the picturesque continent of Australia. Though often reprimanded for her wild and unorthodox ways, Sydney more often than not justifies her lawless techniques. More than any of the other Danger Girls, Sydney takes frequent advantage of her good looks, deploying her curvaceous form to distract and defeat the ladies’ primarily-male nemeses. Sydney seems to have a love/hate relationship with Johnny Barracuda, who often makes sexualized passes at her which she either coyly accepts or acidicly rebuffs. Sydney also appears to have a crush on Batman/Bruce Wayne in the &quot;Batman/Danger Girl&quot; crossover.
; Deuce: A former British Secret Service Agent who was lured away from retirement when invited to fashion and oversee the world&#x27;s first all-female espionage network—a secret organization that would adopt the code name Danger Girl. His true name was never revealed throughout the series, but speculation always led the reader to believe he&#x27;s James Bond, as he makes a strong resemblance to Sean Connery&#x27;s incarnation of the cult-classic secret agent.
; Silicon Valerie: A teenager who graduated top of her class at Oxford, years before she could even obtain a valid driver&#x27;s license. Though Valerie could have easily secured a safe and lucrative career in the field of communications technology, her love of danger led to a chance encounter with Deuce, who welcomed her into his employ as a Danger Girl-in-training. Valerie monitors the Danger Girls&#x27; status during their missions, but she secretly desires to go on such a mission herself. Her name is a play on Silicon Valley.
; Johnny Barracuda: A handsome CIA agent with a large ego and a sex drive to match. He collaborates with the Danger Girls on various missions; they seem to enjoy taking sexual potshots at each other. He has a love/hate relationship with Sydney Savage.
; Secret Agent Zero: A master of disguise and spy of unknown origin, besides being the only Hammer agent who has ever defected and lived to tell about it. No one knows what he looks like beneath his mysterious mask, but he appears to have a connection with Abbey Chase. He could possibly be her missing-and-presumed-dead father; he does keep a photo of Abbey, taken during her childhood, with him. It is also thought that he is originally Diabolik himself, but any reference to his own personal past was never mentioned.
; Sonya Savage: The sister of Sydney Savage, who is one of the original members of Danger Girl. Sonya received her training from the Australian secret agency ASIS. She is secretly in the employ of Veronica Fox, who does not trust the Danger Girl team to retrieve the artifact that she desires. Sonya works alongside the team, but at the end of the mission decides to stay on as a third team member. Sonya is in peak physical condition and is unparalleled in her ability with a bow and arrow. She sometimes employs trick arrows (much as those with transponders or explosive on them).
; Natalia Kassle: A sultry Russian, She was chosen to join the Danger Girl organization for her phenomenal combat and espionage talents, honed in the KGB, and also for her more obvious outstanding attributes. Natalia was the team&#x27;s original field-commander, but she also turned out to be a double agent, secretly working for the neo-Nazi Hammer Empire. She nearly led the Danger Girls to their deaths, but was ultimately exposed and defeated. Currently she has rejoined the Danger Girls.

===Villains===
; Major Maxim: The monstrous mastermind and muscle behind the Hammer Empire&#x27;s military forces. Once but a wounded soldier of those very forces, Maxim became an unwilling volunteer to Doctor Kharnov Von Kripplor&#x27;s Übermensch (Super-Soldier) program. The only &quot;success&quot; of the strange procedure, Maxim soon became dependent on the mysterious blue Übermensch fluid that supplies and sustains his massive size and strength. He has never been shown without his mask, and his real name remains unknown.
; Assassin X: A mysterious blind ninja who works for the Hammer Empire. He appears to have a long and complicated history with Secret Agent Zero.
; Kid Dynamo: A villainous dwarf who has a giant grudge against Johnny Barracuda. His weapon of choice is a pair of extendable golden arms. In one appearance, Dynamo dressed himself as a miniature Adolf Hitler.
; Mr. Giggles: A cadaverous man with an artificial larynx and a hand replaced with a steel claw. He acts as a straight man for Kid Dynamo.
; Doctor Kharnov Von Kripplor: A scientist bent on making insane experiments for the Hammer. He is also the creator of Übermensch Serum X. Half of his face has been heavily stitched up; it seems to be either mutating, rotting or both.
; The Peach: An illegal arms dealer who has ties to the Hammer Empire.
; Donavin Conrad: A cartoonish rogue who lost his right eye to Abbey Chase. Although he appears to be the stereotypical aristocratic villain, Conrad&#x27;s image is largely an elaborate charade. He also wears a toupée. Donavin later lost a hand to the Joker when the Danger Girls joined forces with Batman.

<text>Grover Sanders Krantz (November 5, 1931 – February 14, 2002) was an American anthropologist and cryptozoologist; he was one of few scientists not only to research Bigfoot, but also to express his belief in the animal&#x27;s existence. Throughout his professional career, Krantz authored more than 60 academic articles and 10 books on human evolution, and conducted field research in Europe, China, and Java.

Outside of Krantz&#x27;s formal studies in evolutionary anthropology and primatology, his cryptozoological research on Bigfoot drew heavy criticism from his colleagues due to being fringe science, costing him research grants and promotions, and delaying his tenure at the university. Further, his articles on the subject were rejected by peer-reviewed scholarly journals. However, Krantz was tenacious in his work and was often drawn to controversial subjects, such as the Kennewick Man remains, arguing for their preservation and study. He has been described as having been the &quot;only scientist&quot; and &quot;lone professional&quot; to seriously consider Bigfoot in his time, in a field largely dominated by amateur naturalists.

==Early life and education==
Krantz was born in Salt Lake City in 1931 to Carl Victor Emmanuel Krantz and Esther Maria (née Sanders) Krantz. His parents were devout Mormons, and while Krantz tried to follow the basic Christian philosophy of behaviour and morality, he was not active in the religion. He was raised in Rockford, Illinois until the age of 10, when his family relocated back to Utah. He attended the University of Utah for a year beginning in 1949 before joining the Air National Guard, where he served as a desert survival instructor at Clovis, New Mexico from 1951 to 1952. Krantz then transferred to the University of California, Berkeley, where he completed a Bachelor of Science degree in 1955 and a Master&#x27;s degree in 1958. With the submission of his doctoral dissertation, titled &quot;The Origins of Man&quot;, Krantz obtained his doctorate in anthropology from the University of Minnesota in 1971.

== Career ==
In the early 1960s, Krantz worked as a technician at the Phoebe A. Hearst Museum of Anthropology in Berkeley, California before acquiring a full-time teaching position at Washington State University, where he taught from 1968 until his retirement in 1998. He was a popular professor despite giving notoriously difficult exams, and often ate lunch with students and talked about anthropology, unified field theory in physics, military history, and current events. After his death, a scholarship named after Krantz was established at the University to promote &quot;interest in the fields of physical/biological anthropology, linguistic archaeology, and/or human demography.&quot;

In the 1970s, Krantz studied the fossil remains of &quot;Ramapithecus&quot;, an extinct genus of primates then thought by many anthropologists to be ancestral to humans, although Krantz helped prove this notion false. Krantz&#x27;s research on &quot;Homo erectus&quot; was extensive, including studies of phonemic speech and theoretical hunting patterns, and argued that this led to many of the anatomical differences between &quot;H. erectus&quot; and modern humans. In 1968, he named the hunting that Ashley Montagu had earlier described involving the human pursuit hunting of animals &quot;persistence hunting&quot;.

He also wrote an influential paper on the emergence of humans in prehistoric Europe and the development of Indo-European languages, and was the first researcher to explain the function of the mastoid process. His professional work was diverse, including research on the development of Paleolithic stone tools, Neanderthal taxonomy and culture, the Quaternary extinction event, sea level changes, and the evidence of sex in the human fossil record.

In 1996 Krantz was drawn into the Kennewick Man controversy, arguing both in academia and in court that direct lineage to extant human populations could not be demonstrated. In an interview appearing in &quot;The New Yorker&quot;, Krantz stated his view that &quot;this skeleton cannot be racially or culturally associated with any existing American Indian group&quot; and &quot;the Native Repatriation Act has no more applicability to this skeleton than it would if an early Chinese expedition had left one of its members there.&quot; In 2001 he attempted to submit the last paper he wrote before his death, titled &quot;Neanderthal Continuity in View of Some Overlooked Data,&quot; although it was rejected by the peer-reviewed journal &quot;Current Anthropology&quot;, with then editor Benjamin Orlove stating that it did not make enough reference to the most current research.

===Bigfoot research===
Krantz&#x27;s specialty as an anthropologist included all aspects of human evolution, but he was best known outside of academia as the first serious researcher to devote his professional energies to the scientific study of Bigfoot, beginning in 1963. Because his cryptozoology research was ignored by mainstream scientists, despite his academic credentials, in a bid to find an audience Krantz published numerous books aimed at casual readers and also frequently appeared in television documentaries, including &quot;Arthur C. Clarke&#x27;s Mysterious World&quot;, &quot;In Search of...&quot;, and &quot;&quot;.

Krantz&#x27;s studies of Bigfoot, which he called &quot;Sasquatch,&quot; (an Anglicization of the Halkomelem word &quot;sásq’ets&quot; (, meaning &quot;wild man&quot;) led him to believe that this was an actual creature. He theorized that sightings were due to small pockets of surviving gigantopithecines, with the progenitor population having migrated across the Bering land bridge, which was later used by humans to enter North America. (&quot;Gigantopithecus&quot; lived alongside humans but is thought to have gone extinct 100,000 years ago in eastern Asia, while the Bering land bridge existed between 135,000 to 70,000 years BP.)

In January 1985 Krantz tried to formally name Bigfoot by presenting a paper at the meeting of the International Society of Cryptozoology held in Sussex, England, assigning it the binomen &quot;Gigantopithecus blacki&quot;, although this was not permitted by the International Commission on Zoological Nomenclature because &quot;G. blacki&quot; was an existing taxon and because the creature was lacking a holotype. Krantz argued that his plaster casts were suitable holotypes, later suggesting &quot;G. canadensis&quot; as a name, with the caveat that were Sasquatch found to be a member of the Homininae clade, the genus name could be &quot;Gigantanthropus&quot; in place of &quot;Gigantopithecus.&quot; Krantz then tried to have his paper, titled &quot;A Species Named from Footprints,&quot; published in an academic journal although it was rejected by reviewers.

After seeing footage stills of the Patterson–Gimlin film which appeared on the February 1968 cover of &quot;Argosy&quot;, Krantz was skeptical, believing the film to be an elaborate hoax, saying &quot;it looked to me like someone wearing a gorilla suit&quot; and &quot;I gave Sasquatch only a 10 percent chance of being real.&quot; After years of skepticism, Krantz finally became convinced of Bigfoot&#x27;s existence after analyzing the &quot;Cripplefoot&quot; plaster casts gathered at Bossburg, Washington in December 1969. Krantz later studied the Patterson–Gimlin film in full, and after taking notice of the creature&#x27;s peculiar gait and purported anatomical features, such as flexing leg muscles, he changed his mind and became an advocate of its authenticity. While in Bossburg, he also met John Willison Green and the two remained friends until Krantz&#x27;s death.

The Cripplefoot tracks, left in snow, purportedly showed microscopic dermal ridges (fingerprints) and injuries tentatively identified as clubfoot by primatologist John Napier. Krantz asked Dutch professor A.G. de Wilde of the University of Groningen to examine the prints, who concluded that they were &quot;not from some dead object with ridges in it, but come from a living object able to spread its toes.&quot; Krantz also attempted to have both the FBI and Scotland Yard study the dermal ridge patterns, and was told by renowned fingerprint expert John Berry, an editor of the journal &quot;Fingerprint Whorld&quot;, that Scotland Yard had concluded the prints were &quot;probably real.&quot; To his disappointment, a subsequent 1983 article in the journal &quot;Cryptozoology&quot;, titled &quot;Anatomy and Dermatoglyphics of Three Sasquatch Footprints,&quot; was largely ignored.

After constructing biomechanical models of the Cripplefoot casts by calculating their distance, leverage, weight dynamics and distribution, and comparing the data to the track&#x27;s heel, ankle and toe base, Krantz concluded that the footprints had been left by an animal about 2.44 m (8 ft) tall and weighing roughly 363 kg (800 lb). The morphological detail in the cast, particularly impressions of the thenar eminence muscle, also helped convince Krantz, who argued that a hoax &quot;would require someone quite familiar with the anatomy of the human hand to make the connection between a non-opposable thumb and an absence of the thenar eminence.&quot; This culminated in Krantz&#x27;s first publication on the subject of Bigfoot, with his article &quot;Sasquatch Handprints&quot; appearing in the journal &quot;North American Research Notes&quot; in 1971.

Shortly before his death, Krantz also examined the Skookum cast. He did not publicly endorse its authenticity, saying in an interview with &quot;Outside&quot; magazine, &quot;I don&#x27;t know what it is. I&#x27;m baffled. Elk. Sasquatch. That&#x27;s the choice.&quot;

He, Peter Byrne, René Dahinden, and John Green have been dubbed the “Four Horsemen of Sasquatchery”.

== Personal life ==

Grover Krantz had one brother, Victor Krantz, who worked as a photographer at the Smithsonian Institution. Krantz was married four times and divorced three times. His first wife was Patricia Howland, whom he married in 1953; he was later married to Joan Brandson in 1959 and Evelyn Einstein in 1964. He married his fourth wife, Diane Horton, on November 5, 1982. He also had a stepson, Dural Horton. Krantz was a road enthusiast and frequently took road trips, traveling to all 48 continental states. In 1984, he received high scores on the Miller Analogies Test and was subsequently accepted into the high IQ society Intertel. He was also a member of Mensa. On March 3, 1987, Krantz debated Duane Gish on creationism and evolution at Washington State University; the well-publicized three-hour debate was attended by more than 1000 people.

=== Death and skeleton ===
On Valentine&#x27;s Day 2002, Krantz died in his Port Angeles, Washington home from pancreatic cancer after an eight-month battle with the disease. At his request, there was no funeral. Instead, his body was shipped to the body farm at the University of Tennessee Anthropological Research Facility, where scientists study human decay rates to aid in forensic investigations. In 2003, his skeleton arrived at Smithsonian&#x27;s National Museum of Natural History and was laid to rest in a green cabinet, alongside the bones of his three favorite Irish Wolfhounds – Clyde, Icky, and Yahoo – as was his last request (See &quot;Epilogue&quot; by Dave Hunt of the Smithsonian in &quot;Only A Dog&quot;).
In 2009, Krantz&#x27;s skeleton was painstakingly articulated and, along with the skeleton of one of his dogs, included on display in the Smithsonian&#x27;s &quot;Written in Bone: Forensic Files of the 17th Century Chesapeake&quot; exhibition at the National Museum of Natural History. His bones have also been used to teach forensics and advanced osteology to George Washington University students.

After his death, an editor at NPR named Laura Krantz saw the obituary in the Washington Post and realized that Grover was a relative of hers; Grover was her grandfather&#x27;s cousin. She spent a year documenting his life&#x27;s work in her podcast, &quot;Wild Thing&quot;, and later a children&#x27;s book, &quot;The Search for Sasquatch&quot;.

<text>Polybrominated diphenyl ethers or PBDEs, are a class of organobromine compounds that are used as flame retardants. Like other brominated flame retardants, PBDEs have been used in a wide array of products, including building materials, electronics, furnishings, motor vehicles, airplanes, plastics, polyurethane foams, and textiles. They are structurally akin to polychlorinated diphenyl ethers (PCDEs), polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) and other polyhalogenated compounds, consisting of two halogenated aromatic rings. PBDEs are classified according to the average number of bromine atoms in the molecule. The life-saving benefits of fire retardants led to their popularization. Standards for mass transit vehicles continues to increase as of 2021.

Because of their toxicity and persistence, all commercially relevant PBDEs have been marked for elimination under the Stockholm Convention, a treaty to control and phase out major persistent organic pollutants (POPs).

The family of PBDEs consists of 209 possible substances, which are called congeners (PBDE = C12H(10−&quot;x&quot;)Br&quot;x&quot;O (&quot;x&quot; = 1, 2, ..., 10 = &quot;m&quot; + &quot;n&quot;)). The number of isomers for mono-, di-, tri-, tetra-, penta-, hexa-, hepta-, octa-, nona-, and decabromodiphenyl ethers are 3, 12, 24, 42, 46, 42, 24, 12, 3 and 1, respectively.

Lower-brominated PBDEs with 1–4 bromine atoms per molecule are regarded as more dangerous because they more efficiently bioaccumulate. They have been known to affect thyroid hormone levels, and studies have linked them to reproductive and neurological risks at certain concentrations or higher. Higher-brominated PBDEs are less acutely dangerous but biotically and photochemically debrominate to lower-brominated congeners.

==Production==
PBDEs were produced commercially via the bromination of diphenyl ether, with three technical-grade mixtures being sold, varying by degree of bromination.

In the United States, PBDEs were marketed with the trade names DE-60F, DE-61, DE-62, and DE-71 applied to pentaBDE mixtures, DE-79 applied to octaBDE mixtures, and DE 83R and Saytex 102E applied to decaBDE mixtures. The available commercial PBDE products were not single compounds or even single congeners but rather mixtures of congeners.

Technical pentaBDE predominantly contained pentabromo derivatives (50–62%); however, the mixture also contained tetrabromides (24–38%) and hexabromides (4–8%), as well as traces of the tribromides (0–1%). Technical octaBDE was a mixture of homologs: hexa-, hepta-, octa-, nona-, and decabromides. Technical decaBDE was 97% decabromide, with small amounts of octa- and nonabromides.

Commercial production of PBDEs began in the 1970s, and continued until the early 2010s. Cumulative global production is estimated to have been 175kt for pentaBDE, 130kt for octaBDE, and 1600kt for decaBDE.
==Health and environmental concerns==

===Exposure===

Polybrominated diphenyl ethers (PBDEs) can be released into the environment where they are used or produced, possibly entering air, water, soil or the human digestive system when consumed, inhaled or via the skin. Despite the banning and phase out of several forms of PBDEs, many consumer products still contain them in the 21st century, and represent potential exposure sources, including furniture and other consumer products containing polyurethane foam, appliances, pipes, plastics, and old electronic equipment.

Generally, governments have determined that PBDEs are not harmful to human health in the exposure amounts assessed. Ingestion of house dust accounts for 80–90% of total PBDE exposure, while the remaining exposure occurs from food ingestion. PBDE-contaminated foods, particularly those high in fat content, such as fatty meats or fish, are possible sources of exposure. In breastfeeding infants, breast milk may be an exposure source because PBDEs can be present in the mother and her milk. Various other food items may contain PBDEs, including meat, meat products, dairy products, and seafood. 

PBDEs have not been detected beyond trace levels in water. In the environment, soils and sediments are the major deposits for PBDEs. PBDEs can enter soil from discarded products, such as in landfills. As biosolids (sewage) may contain PBDEs, exposure from soils or farmlands that have been fertilized with biosolids may occur. Wildlife may have exposure by consuming foods containing PBDEs, whereas organisms that live in sediments may be contaminated by PBDEs.

===Excretion===
PBDEs and their metabolites are excreted mainly in the feces and some in the urine. Owing to their deposition in body fat stores, some PBDEs remain in the body for many years, and may enter the bodies of unborn babies via the placenta.

===Research on health effects===
Nothing certain has been established about the effects of PBDEs on human health. Most information regarding toxicity of PBDEs and their metabolites is from early-stage animal studies. Evidence for PBDE-mediated effects from human studies in systems other than the developing nervous system, such as in cancer development, is inconclusive or non-existent. Particularly for the potential effects of PBDEs on the developing fetus, research has focused on the health status of mothers and gestational age of the infant.

===Sediment contamination===
Increasing environmental concentrations and changing distributions of PBDEs in sediments of the Clyde River Estuary in Scotland, UK have been assessed. Analysis of six sediment cores each of 1 m depth from Glasgow city to Greenock revealed that total concentrations increased toward the river bed surface (0–10 cm). Amounts of PBDE ranged from 1 to 2,645 µg/kg (dry wt. sediment) with a mean of 287 µg/kg (dry wt. sediment). Down-core PBDE congener profiles showed that higher concentrations were due to elevated levels of BDE-209. The majority of the sediment records clearly showed a change from mainly lower molecular weight BDEs 47,99, 183, 153 at lower depths to BDE-209 near the surface, a change in congener and homologue group patterns that corresponds to the restrictions of penta- and octaBDE commercial mixtures under EU law in 2004–2006.

While biodegradation is not considered the main pathway for PBDEs, photolysis and pyrolysis can be of interest in studies of transformation of PBDEs.

==Regulations of PBDEs==
===United States===
In August 2003, the State of California outlawed the sale of penta- and octaBDE and products containing them, effective 1 January 2008. PBDEs are ubiquitous in the environment, and, according to the EPA, exposure may pose health risks. According to U.S. EPA&#x27;s Integrated Risk Information System, evidence indicates that PBDEs may possess liver toxicity, thyroid toxicity, and neurodevelopmental toxicity. In June 2008, the U.S. EPA set a safe daily exposure level ranging from 0.1 to 7 μg/kg body weight per day for the four most common PBDE congeners. In April 2007, the legislature of the state of Washington passed a bill banning the use of PBDEs. The State of Maine Department of Environmental Protection has restrictions on PBDEs, and in 2008, the legislature passed a bill phasing out the use of decaBDE.

The U.S. importers and manufacturers of PBDEs withdrew pentaBDE and octaBDE from sale in 2004, and decaBDE from sale by the end of 2013. In November 2024, the EPA added decaBDE to the Toxic Substances Control Act to prohibit release into water during manufacturing, processing or distribution in commerce of decaBDE and decaBDE-containing products, and a phase-out of processing and distribution of wire and cable insulation containing decaDBE for nuclear power facilities.

===Canada===
Since 2012, PBDEs are among chemicals prohibited from manufacture, use, sale, offer for sale or import, as regulated in the Prohibition of Certain Toxic Substances Regulations of the 1999 Canadian Environmental Protection Act. PBDEs are regarded in the regulation as &quot;toxic to the environment and/or human health, are generally persistent, bioaccumulative, and/or inherently toxic.&quot;

===European Union===
The European Union decided to ban the use of two classes of flame retardants, in particular, PBDEs and polybrominated biphenyls (PBBs) in electric and electronic devices. This ban was formalised in the RoHS Directive, and an upper limit of 1 g/kg for the sum of PBBs and PBDEs was set. In February 2009, the Institute for Reference Materials and Measurements released two certified reference materials to help analytical laboratories better detect these two classes of flame retardants. The reference materials were custom-made to contain all relevant PBDEs and PBBs at levels close to the legal limit.

===International===
At an international level, in May 2009 the Parties of the Stockholm Convention on Persistent Organic Pollutants (POPs) decided to list commercial pentaBDE and commercial octaBDE as POP substances. This listing is due to the properties of hexaBDE and heptaBDE, which are components of commercial octaBDE, and to the properties of tetraBDE and pentaBDE, which are the main components of commercial pentaBDE. In 2017, it was decided to also list decaBDE.

==Alternatives==
Major decaBDE producers have switched to manufacturing decabromodiphenyl ethane, a structurally related compound that has also come under suspicion as an environmental pollutant. Non-halogenated alternatives also exist.

<doc id="801855" wikidata="Q381819" url="?curid=801855" title="Eucratides I">
<text>Eucratides I (, &quot;Eukratídēs&quot;; Kharosthi: &quot;Evukratida&quot;; reigned 172/171–145 BC), also known as Eucratides the Great, was one of the most important Greco-Bactrian kings. He conquered large parts of northern India, although there is no proof ever found about this and only one Roman literary source written much later. and minted a vast and prestigious coinage, suggesting a rule of considerable importance and prosperity. His immediate successors were the last Greek kings to rule in Bactria.

==Biography and name==
Eucratides was born around 210–205 BC, the son of Heliocles and Laodice as depicted on various finds of his coinage. It is unclear whether he was a Bactrian nobleman who raised a rebellion, or, according to some scholars, a cousin of the Seleucid king Antiochus IV Epiphanes who was trying to regain the Bactrian territory. There has been much speculation on Eucratides&#x27; background and parentage. His mother, Laodice, is depicted wearing a royal diadem and therefore of royal descent, while his father is bare-headed. Tarn asserted that Laodice was a Seleucid princess, the daughter of Seleucus II Callinicus. Narain and other modern authors have challenged this established view.

Eucratides&#x27; name is derived from the Greek name Eucrates (Ancient Greek: Εὐκράτης), which means &quot;good power&quot;, or &quot;well-powerful&quot;, and the patronymic suffix -ίδης&quot;,&quot; meaning &quot;son of&quot;, or &quot;descendant of&quot;. His name therefore likely means &quot;descendant of Eucrates&quot;, and may possibly have had a grandfather or another male ancestor named Eucrates.

===Coup d&#x27;état ===
Whatever his origins, Eucratides came to power by overthrowing the Euthydemid dynasty in Bactria, possibly when its king, Demetrius was conquering northwestern India. The king whom Eucratides dethroned in Bactria was probably Antimachus I.

Justin explains that Eucratides acceded to the throne at about the same time as Mithridates, whose rule is accurately known to have started in 171 BC, thereby giving an approximate date for the accession of Eucratides:

Having become master of Bactria after de-throning the Euthydemid dynasty, Eucratides was faced with a Parthian invasion which began when Demetrius I was conquering India. Having taken Tapuria and Margiana from Demetrius in about 170 BC, the powerful Mithridates I attempted to conquer Bactria itself but was checked by Eucratides. Having secured his western borders, Eucratides then conquered parts of India, campaigning as far south as Barigaza (modern day Bharuch), solidifying Greek presence in Northern India with the Indo-Greek Kingdom. According to the single remaining source, Roman historian Justin, Eucratides defeated Demetrius of India, but the identity of this king is uncertain: he could be either Demetrius I, or Demetrius II, but more likely Menander I.
:&quot;Eucratides led many wars with great courage, and, while weakened by them, was put under siege by Demetrius, king of the Indians. He made numerous sorties, and managed to vanquish 60,000 enemies with 300 soldiers, and thus liberated after four months, he put India under his rule&quot; Justin XLI,6
Numismatic evidence suggests that Eucratides I was a contemporary of the Indo-Greek kings Apollodotus I, Apollodotus II and Plato of Bactria. In any case, Eucratides&#x27; advances into India are proved by his abundant bilingual coinage that are spread all over northern India and Pakistan.

The city of Eucratideia (Εὐκρατίδεια), which is mentioned by ancient Greek geographers as city of great wealth straddling the Oxus River, was probably named after Eucratides. It might have been a totally new foundation or an existing city which he had renamed after himself. The location of the city is uncertain, but it was probably Ai-Khanoum or perhaps Dilbarjin.

===Death===

Justin ends his account of Eucratides&#x27; life by claiming that the warlike king was murdered on his way back from India by his son, who hated Eucratides so much that he mutilated and dragged his dead body after his chariot. This may have been a misinterpretation by Justin, and the regicide could instead have been perpetrated by an Euthydemid prince, Demetrius II, the son and successor of Demetrius I. Justin appears to believe Eucratides was killed by his own son, Heliocles I, but this is unlikely as patricide was uncommon in the Hellenistic age.

:&quot;As Eucratides returned from India, he was killed on the way back by his son, who ran his chariot over the blood of the king, and ordered the corpse to be left without a sepulture&quot; Justin XLI,6
The murder of Eucratides probably brought about a civil war amongst the members of the dynasty. The successors to Eucratides were Eucratides II and Heliocles I (145–130 BC), who was the last Greek king to reign in Bactria. Once the Yuezhi tribes overpowered Heliocles, the Greco-Bactrians lost control of the provinces north of the Hindu Kush. Other members of the dynasty were Plato of Bactria and probably Demetrius II, who in that case was not identical with the king Justin claimed was the enemy of Eucratides I.

Eucratides was the last known ruler of Ai-Khanoum, which was also his capital city. Ai-Khanoum was a prosperous Greek city in Bactria and excavations in the 20th century showed that it had all the hallmarks of a true Hellenistic city. It was likely destroyed at the end of Eucratides&#x27; reign in about 145 BC.

The rule of the Greco-Bactrians soon crumbled following these numerous wars:

:&quot;The Bactrians, involved in various wars, lost not only their rule but also their freedom, as, exhausted by their wars against the Sogdians, the Arachotes, the Dranges, the Arians and the Indians, they were finally crushed, as if drawn of all their blood, by an enemy weaker than them, the Parthians.&quot; Justin, XLI,6

However, the rule of the Indo-Greeks over territories south of the Hindu Kush lasted for a further 150 years, ultimately collapsing under the pressure of the Yüeh-chih and Scythian (Saka) invasions in around 10 BC, with the last Indo-Greek ruler Strato II.

==Modern==
Da Afghanistan Bank which is the central bank of Afghanistan, in its seal has a Eucratides I-era coin having the Greek text, &quot;ΒΑΣΙΛΕΩΣ ΜΕΓΑΛΟΥ ΕΥΚΡΑΤΙΔΟΥ&quot; which means “Of the great king Eucratides.”

<text>Cliff Wright (Newhaven, 24 October 1963) is an artist, book illustrator and advertising artist.

He has illustrated numerous books, specializing in illustrations of animals and children&#x27;s books, most notably the second and third books in the &quot;Harry Potter&quot; series - &quot;Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets&quot; and &quot;Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban&quot; - and &quot;The Wind in the Willows&quot;.

He has also been an artist in advertising campaigns for numerous large organizations and corporations - including Greenpeace and IKEA. He has illustrated the &quot;Puppy&quot; series of board books by Gerald Durrell, commissioned by the Beanie Baby manufacturer Andrex. He has designed numerous posters and cards and is noted for his illustrations of bears and badgers for children.

Wright is an active campaigner for animal rights with International Animal Rescue and has participated in numerous book signings and auctions to raise money to help the dancing bears of India.

==Early career==
Wright was born in Newhaven, England in 1963. He graduated from the Brighton College of Art in 1986. Wright developed wildlife-based watercolours and children&#x27;s book ideas in the early phase of his career. In 1989, he published a self-written and illustrated picture book for children titled &quot;When the World Sleeps&quot; (Hutchinson). This was runner-up in the Mother Goose Award competition, 1989-1990. He followed this up by two more highly successful illustration projects - &quot;Crumbs!&quot; (Hutchinson, 1990) and &quot;The Tanglewood Troll&quot; (Gollancz, 1993).

==&quot;Harry Potter&quot; illustrations==
Bloomsbury approached Cliff Wright for illustrating the British first-edition cover for the second &quot;Harry Potter&quot; book. The cover illustration for the first book was drawn by Thomas Taylor, a young artist out of college. The popularity of the first book prompted Bloomsbury to select a more experienced illustrator, and hence Cliff Wright was chosen. Wright was the obvious choice for the cover illustrator of the third &quot;Harry Potter&quot; book as well.

Wright was the first to illustrate the following &quot;Harry Potter&quot; concepts and characters:

&quot;Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets&quot; (1998):
*Hedwig the owl
*The Weasleys&#x27; Ford Anglia
*Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry

&quot;Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban&quot; (1999):
*The hippogriff Buckbeak
*Sirius Black in his dog form

Wright retains the rights to the illustrations. He refused to illustrate the fourth &quot;Harry Potter&quot; book after Bloomsbury lost his original front and back cover artwork for &quot;Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban&quot;. The huge black market of the &quot;Harry Potter&quot; fandom has been rumoured to be the cause of the disappearance. He also sued Bloomsbury for offering insufficient compensation.

The original artwork for the second book, &quot;Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets&quot;, went on auction at Christie&#x27;s in 2001 but was unsuccessful at meeting the reserve price of £30,000. The work has since been acquired by investor Luke Heron on behalf of illustration investment company Storyboard Assets Plc for an undisclosed sum. The original art for the first book raised £85,000 at auction.

==Post-&quot;Harry Potter&quot; work==
Cliff Wright conducts an innovative drawing workshop annually, titled the Art of Seeing. Wright has illustrated numerous books for the publishing houses of Ladybird Books and Oxford University Press, in the 1990s and 2000s. He has also written and illustrated the &quot;Little Bear&quot; series of board books from &quot;Templar Publishing&quot;.

He also illustrated the cover of the fantasy novel &quot;I Ribelli dell&#x27;Alianco&quot; (2023) by the italian author Marina Lenti.

<doc id="801863" wikidata="Q902863" url="?curid=801863" title="Flame retardant">
<text>Flame retardants are a diverse group of chemicals that are added to manufactured materials, such as plastics and textiles, and surface finishes and coatings. Flame retardants are activated by the presence of an ignition source and prevent or slow the further development of flames by a variety of different physical and chemical mechanisms. They may be added as a copolymer during the polymerisation process, or later added to the polymer at a moulding or extrusion process or (particularly for textiles) applied as a topical finish. Mineral flame retardants are typically additive, while organohalogen and organophosphorus compounds can be either reactive or additive.

==Classes==
Both reactive and additive flame retardants types can be further separated into four distinct classes:
* Minerals such as aluminium hydroxide (ATH), magnesium hydroxide (MDH), huntite and hydromagnesite, various hydrates, red phosphorus, and boron compounds, mostly borates.
* Organohalogen compounds. This class includes organochlorines such as chlorendic acid derivatives and chlorinated paraffins; organobromines such as decabromodiphenyl ether (decaBDE), decabromodiphenyl ethane (a replacement for decaBDE), polymeric brominated compounds such as brominated polystyrenes, brominated carbonate oligomers (BCOs), brominated epoxy oligomers (BEOs), tetrabromophthalic anyhydride, tetrabromobisphenol A (TBBPA) and hexabromocyclododecane (HBCD). Most but not all halogenated flame retardants are used in conjunction with a synergist to enhance their efficiency. Antimony trioxide is widely used, but other forms of antimony such as the pentoxide and sodium antimonate are also used.
* Organophosphorus compounds. This class includes organophosphates such as triphenyl phosphate (TPP), resorcinol bis(diphenylphosphate) (RDP), bisphenol A diphenyl phosphate (BADP), and tricresyl phosphate (TCP); phosphonates such as dimethyl methylphosphonate (DMMP); and phosphinates such as aluminium diethyl phosphinate. In one important class of flame retardants, compounds contain both phosphorus and a halogen. Such compounds include tris(2,3-dibromopropyl) phosphate (brominated tris) and chlorinated organophosphates such as tris(1,3-dichloro-2-propyl)phosphate (chlorinated tris or TDCPP) and tetrakis(2-chlorethyl)dichloroisopentyldiphosphate (V6).
* Organic compounds such as carboxylic acid and dicarboxylic acid

==Retardation mechanisms==
The basic mechanisms of flame retardants vary depending on the specific flame retardant and the substrate. Additive and reactive flame-retardant chemicals can both function in the vapor (gaseous) or condensed (solid) phase.

===Endothermic degradation===
Some compounds break down endothermically when subjected to high temperatures. Magnesium and aluminium hydroxides are an example, together with various carbonates and hydrates such as mixtures of huntite and hydromagnesite. The reaction removes heat from the substrate, thereby cooling the material. The use of hydroxides and hydrates is limited by their relatively low decomposition temperature, which limits the maximum processing temperature of the polymers (typically used in polyolefins for wire and cable applications).

===Thermal shielding (solid phase)===
A way to stop spreading of the flame over the material is to create a thermal insulation barrier between the burning and unburned parts. Intumescent additives are often employed; their role is to turn the polymer surface into a char, which separates the flame from the material and slows the heat transfer to the unburned fuel. Non-halogenated inorganic and organic phosphate flame retardants typically act through this mechanism by generating a polymeric layer of charred phosphoric acid.

===Dilution of gas phase===
Inert gases (most often carbon dioxide and water) produced by thermal degradation of some materials act as diluents of the combustible gases, lowering their partial pressures and the partial pressure of oxygen, and slowing the reaction rate.

===Gas phase radical quenching===
Chlorinated and brominated materials undergo thermal degradation and release hydrogen chloride and hydrogen bromide or, if used in the presence of a synergist like antimony trioxide, antimony halides. These react with the highly reactive H· and OH· radicals in the flame, resulting in an inactive molecule and a Cl· or Br· radical. The halogen radical is much less reactive compared to H· or OH·, and therefore has much lower potential to propagate the radical oxidation reactions of combustion.

==Materials==
===Flame retardant cotton===

Flame retardant cotton is cotton that has been treated to prevent or slow ignition by different treatments applied during the manufacturing process. Cotton is typically made flame-resistant by chemical applications of polymeric, nonpolymeric, and polymeric/nonpolymeric hybrids that are composed of one or more of the elements such as nitrogen, sodium, phosphorus, silicon, boron, or chlorine.

===Manufacturing ===
While non-organic fabrics are typically made flame-resistant by incorporating flame retardants into their matrices, surface modification is more convenient for organic fabrics like cotton.

=== Use ===
Cotton fabrics have been frequently used worldwide because of their advantageous properties with regard to thermal insulation, biocompatibility and moisture absorption and breathability performance. These advantages indicate potential applications of cotton fabrics in protective clothing and human health. However, natural cotton fabric is flammable and will rapidly burn. This drawback limits the use of cotton fabrics. Therefore, treating cotton fabrics to obtain a fire-resistant fabric is important.

Firefighters, or those exposed to flames on a regular basis, rely on flame-retardant cotton for both protection and comfort. Typically, their undergarments beneath the heavier fire-resistant gear are made of flame-retardant cotton or another breathable, organic fabric that has been treated to resist ignition.

Polymers containing nitrogen, sodium, and phosphorus atoms can work as materials for fire-resistant cellulosic textiles, such as cotton or rayon. Specifically, organic polymers can work as a flame retardant due to the presence of one or all three types of these elements. These atoms can be in the original polymers, or they can be incorporated by chemical modification. Flame retardant materials and coatings are being developed that are phosphorus and bio-based.

==Use and effectiveness==

===Fire safety standards===
Flame retardants are typically added to industrial and consumer products to meet flammability standards for furniture, textiles, electronics, and building products like insulation.

====U.S. state of California====
In 1975, California began implementing Technical Bulletin 117 (TB 117), which requires that materials such as polyurethane foam used to fill furniture be able to withstand a small open flame, equivalent to a candle, for at least 12 seconds. In polyurethane foam, furniture manufacturers typically meet TB 117 with additive halogenated organic flame retardants. Although no other US states have a similar standard, because California has such a large market many manufacturers meet TB 117 in products that they distribute across the United States. The proliferation of flame retardants, and especially halogenated organic flame retardants, in furniture across the United States is strongly linked to TB 117.

In response to concerns about the health impacts of flame retardants in upholstered furniture, in February 2013 California proposed modifying TB 117 to require that fabric covering upholstered furniture meet a smolder test and to eliminate the foam flammability standards. Gov. Jerry Brown signed the modified TB117-2013 in November and it became effective in 2014. The modified regulation does not mandate a reduction in flame retardants.

====EU====
In Europe, flame retardant standards for furnishings vary, and are their most stringent in the UK and Ireland. Generally the ranking of the various common flame retardant tests worldwide for furniture and soft furnishings would indicate that the California test Cal TB117 - 2013 test is the most straightforward to pass, there is increasing difficulty in passing Cal TB117 -1975 followed by the British test BS 5852 and followed by Cal TB133. One of the most demanding flammability tests worldwide is probably the US Federal Aviation Authority test for aircraft seating which involves the use of a kerosene burner which blasts flame at the test piece.
The 2009 Greenstreet Berman study, carried out by the UK government, showed that in the period between 2002 and 2007 the UK Furniture and Furnishings Fire Safety Regulations accounted for 54 fewer deaths per year, 780 fewer non-fatal casualties per year and 1065 fewer fires each year following the introduction of the UK furniture safety regulations in 1988.

===Effectiveness===
The effectiveness of flame retardant chemicals at reducing the flammability of consumer products in house fires is disputed. Advocates for the flame retardant industry, such as the American Chemistry Council&#x27;s North American Flame Retardant Alliance, cite a study from the National Bureau of Standards indicating that a room filled with flame-retarded products (a polyurethane foam-padded chair and several other objects, including cabinetry and electronics) offered a 15-fold greater time window for occupants to escape the room than a similar room free of flame retardants. However, critics of this position, including the lead study author, argue that the levels of flame retardant used in the 1988 study, while found commercially, are much higher than the levels required by TB 117 and used broadly in the United States in upholstered furniture.

Another study concluded flame retardants are an effective tool to reduce fire risks without creating toxic emissions.

Several studies in the 1980s tested ignition in whole pieces of furniture with different upholstery and filling types, including different flame retardant formulations. In particular, they looked at maximum heat release and time to maximum heat release, two key indicators of fire danger. These studies found that the type of fabric covering had a large influence on ease of ignition, that cotton fillings were much less flammable than polyurethane foam fillings, and that an interliner material substantially reduced the ease of ignition. They also found that although some flame retardant formulations decreased the ease of ignition, the most basic formulation that met TB 117 had very little effect. In one of the studies, foam fillings that met TB 117 had equivalent ignition times as the same foam fillings without flame retardants. A report from the Proceedings of the Polyurethane Foam Association also showed no benefit in open-flame and cigarette tests with foam cushions treated with flame retardants to meet TB 117. However, other scientists support this open-flame test.

Compared with cotton, flame retardants increase fire toxicity. They have a large effect on bench-scale flammability tests, but a negligible effect on large scale fire tests. Furniture of naturally flame-retardant materials is much safer than foam with fire retardants.

==Environmental and health issues==
The environmental behaviour of flame retardants has been studied since the 1990s. Mainly brominated flame retardants were found in many environmental compartments and organisms including humans, and some individual substances were found to have toxic properties. Therefore, alternatives have been demanded by authorities, NGOs and equipment manufacturers. The EU-funded collaborative research project ENFIRO (EU research project FP7: 226563, concluded in 2012) started out from the assumption that not enough environmental and health data were known of alternatives to the established brominated flame retardants. In order to make the evaluation fully comprehensive, it was decided to compare also material and fire performance as well as attempt a life-cycle assessment of a reference product containing halogen free versus brominated flame retardants. About a dozen halogen free flame retardants were studied representing a large variety of applications, from engineering plastics, printed circuit boards, encapsulants to textile and intumescent coatings.

A large group of the studied flame retardants were found to have a good environmental and health profile: ammonium polyphosphate (APP), aluminium diethyl phosphinate (Alpi), aluminium hydroxide (ATH), magnesium hydroxide (MDH), melamine polyphosphate (MPP), dihydrooxaphosphaphenanthrene (DOPO), zinc stannate (ZS) and zinc hydroxstannate (ZHS). Overall, they were found to have a much lower tendency to bioaccumulate in fatty tissue than the studied brominated flame retardants.

The tests on the fire behaviour of materials with different flame retardants revealed that halogen free flame retardants produce less smoke and toxic fire emissions, with the exception of the aryl phosphates RDP and BDP in styrenic polymers. The leaching experiments showed that the nature of the polymer is a dominating factor and that the leaching behaviour of halogen free and brominated flame retardants is comparable. The more porous or “hydrophilic” a polymers is the more flame retardants can be released. However, moulded plates which represent real world plastic products showed much lower leaching levels than extruded polymer granules. The impact assessment studies reconfirmed that the improper waste and recycling treatment of electronic products with brominated flame retardants can produce dioxins which is not the case with halogen free alternatives. Furthermore, the United States Environmental Protection Agency (US EPA) has been carrying out a series of projects related to the environmental assessment of alternative flame retardants, the “design for environment” projects on flame retardants for printed wiring boards and alternatives to decabromodiphenyl ether and hexabromocyclododecane (HBCD).

In 2009, the US National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) released a report on polybrominated diphenyl ethers (PBDEs) and found that, in contrast to earlier reports, they were found throughout the US coastal zone. This nationwide survey found that New York&#x27;s Hudson Raritan Estuary had the highest overall concentrations of PBDEs, both in sediments and shellfish. Individual sites with the highest PBDE measurements were found in shellfish taken from Anaheim Bay, California, and four sites in the Hudson Raritan Estuary. Watersheds that include the Southern California Bight, Puget Sound, the central and eastern Gulf of Mexico off the coast of Tampa and St. Petersburg, in Florida, and the waters of Lake Michigan near Chicago and Gary, Indiana, also were found to have high PBDE concentrations.

===Health concerns===
The earliest flame retardants, polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs), were banned in the US in 1977 when it was discovered that they were toxic. Industries used brominated flame retardants instead, but these are now receiving closer scrutiny. In 2004 and 2008 the EU banned several types of polybrominated diphenyl ethers (PBDEs). Negotiations between the EPA and the two US producers of DecaBDE (a flame retardant that has been used in electronics, wire and cable insulation, textiles, automobiles and airplanes, and other applications), Albemarle Corporation and Chemtura Corporation, and the largest US importer, ICL Industrial Products, Inc., resulted in commitments by these companies to phase out decaBDE for most uses in the United States by December 31, 2012, and to end all uses by the end of 2013. The state of California has listed the flame retardant chemical chlorinated Tris (tris(1,3-dichloro-2-propyl) phosphate or TDCPP) as a chemical known to cause cancer. In December 2012, the California nonprofit Center for Environmental Health filed notices of intent to sue several leading retailers and producers of baby products for violating California law for failing to label products containing this cancer-causing flame retardant. While the demand for brominated and chlorinated flame retardants in North America and Western Europe is declining, it is rising in all other regions.

There is a potential association between the exposure to the Phosphorus Flame Retardants (PFR) in residential indoor dust and the development of allergies, asthma and dermatitis. A study was conducted in 2014 by Araki, A. et al. in Japan to assess this relationship. They found a significant association between the Tris (2-chloro-iso-propyl) phosphate (TCIPP) and atopic dermatitis with an odds ratio of 2.43. They also found that the Tributyl phosphate was associated with the development of allergic rhinitis and asthma with an odds ratio of 2.55 &amp; 2.85 respectively.

Another study conducted by Chevrier &quot;et al.&quot; 2010 measured the concentration of 10 PBDE congeners, free thyroxine (T4), total T4, and thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) in 270 pregnant women around the 27th week of gestation. Associations between PBDEs and free and total T4 were found to be statistically insignificant. However, authors did find a significant association amongst exposure to PBDEs and lower TSH during pregnancy, which may have implications for maternal health and fetal development.

A prospective, longitudinal cohort study initiated after 11 September 2001, including 329 mothers who delivered in one of three hospitals in lower Manhattan, New York, was conducted by Herbstman &quot;et al.&quot; 2010. Authors of this study analyzed 210 cord blood specimens for selected PBDE congeners and assessed neurodevelopmental effects in the children at 12–48 and 72 months of age. Results showed that children who had higher cord blood concentrations of polybrominated diphenyl ethers (PBDEs) scored lower on tests of mental and motor development at 1–4 and 6 years of age. This was the first study to report any such associations in humans.

A similar study was conducted by Roze et al. 2009 in The Netherlands on 62 mothers and children to estimate associations between 12 Organohalogen compounds (OHCs), including polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) and brominated diphenyl ether (PBDE) flame retardants, measured in maternal serum during the 35th week of pregnancy and motor performance (coordination, fine motor skills), cognition (intelligence, visual perception, visuomotor integration, inhibitory control, verbal memory, and attention), and behavior scores at 5–6 years of age. Authors demonstrated for the first time that transplacental transfer of polybrominated flame retardants was associated with the development of children at school age.

Another study was conducted by Rose et al. in 2010 to measure circulating PBDE levels in 100 children between 2 and 5 years of age from California. The PBDE levels according to this study, in 2- to 5-year-old California children was 10 to 1,000 fold higher than European children, 5 times higher than other US children and 2 to 10 times higher than US adults. They also found that diet, indoor environment, and social factors influenced children&#x27;s body burden levels. Eating poultry and pork contributed to elevated body burdens for nearly all types of flame retardants. Study also found that lower maternal education was independently and significantly associated with higher levels of most flame retardant congeners in the children.

&quot;San Antonio Statement on Brominated and Chlorinated Flame Retardants 2010&quot;: A group of 145 prominent scientists from 22 countries signed the first-ever consensus statement documenting health hazards from flame retardant chemicals found at high levels in home furniture, electronics, insulation, and other products. This statement documents that, with limited fire safety benefit, these flame retardants can cause serious health issues, and, as types of flame retardants are banned, the alternatives should be proven safe before being used. The group also wants to change widespread policies that require use of flame retardants.

===Mechanisms of toxicity===

====Direct exposure====
Many halogenated flame retardants with aromatic rings, including most brominated flame retardants, are likely thyroid hormone disruptors. The thyroid hormones triiodothyronine (T3) and thyroxine (T4) carry iodine atoms, another halogen, and are structurally similar to many aromatic halogenated flame retardants, including PCBs, TBBPA, and PBDEs. Such flame retardants therefore appear to compete for binding sites in the thyroid system, interfering with normal function of thyroid transport proteins (such as transthyretin) in vitro and thyroid hormone receptors. A 2009 &quot;in vivo&quot; animal study conducted by the US Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) demonstrated that deiodination, active transport, sulfation, and glucuronidation may be involved in disruption of thyroid homeostasis after perinatal exposure to PBDEs during critical developmental time points in utero and shortly after birth. Disruption of deiodinase as reported in the Szabo et al., 2009 &quot;in vivo&quot; study was supported in a follow-up &quot;in vitro&quot; study. The adverse effects on hepatic mechanism of thyroid hormone disruption during development have been shown to persist into adulthood. The EPA noted that PBDEs are particularly toxic to the developing brains of animals. Peer-reviewed studies have shown that even a single dose administered to mice during development of the brain can cause permanent changes in behavior, including hyperactivity.

Based on &quot;in vitro&quot; laboratory studies, several flame retardants, including PBDEs, TBBPA, and BADP, likely also mimic other hormones, including estrogens, progesterone, and androgens. Bisphenol A compounds with lower degrees of bromination seem to exhibit greater estrogenicity. Some halogenated flame retardants, including the less-brominated PBDEs, can be direct neurotoxicants in &quot;in vitro&quot; cell culture studies: By altering calcium homeostasis and signalling in neurons, as well as neurotransmitter release and uptake at synapses, they interfere with normal neurotransmission. Mitochondria may be particularly vulnerable to PBDE toxicity due to their influence on oxidative stress and calcium activity in mitochondria. Exposure to PBDEs can also alter neural cell differentiation and migration during development.

====Degradation products====
Many flame retardants degrade into compounds that are also toxic, and in some cases the degradation products may be the primary toxic agent:
* Halogenated compounds with aromatic rings can degrade into dioxins and dioxin-like compounds, particularly when heated, such as during production, a fire, recycling, or exposure to sun. Chlorinated dioxins are among the highly toxic compounds listed by the Stockholm Convention on Persistent Organic Pollutants.
* Polybrominated diphenyl ethers with higher numbers of bromine atoms, such as decaBDE, are less toxic than PBDEs with lower numbers of bromine atoms, such as pentaBDE. However, as the higher-order PBDEs degrade biotically or abiotically, bromine atoms are removed, resulting in more toxic PBDE congeners.
* When some halogenated flame retardants such as PBDEs are metabolized, they form hydroxylated metabolites that can be more toxic than the parent compound. These hydroxylated metabolites, for example, may compete more strongly to bind with transthyretin or other components of the thyroid system, can be more potent estrogen mimics than the parent compound, and can more strongly affect neurotransmitter receptor activity.
* Bisphenol-A diphenyl phosphate (BADP) and tetrabromobisphenol A (TBBPA) likely degrade to bisphenol A (BPA), an endocrine disruptor of concern.

===Routes of exposure===
People can be exposed to flame retardants through several routes, including diet; consumer products in the home, vehicle, or workplace; occupation; or environmental contamination near their home or workplace. Residents in North America tend to have substantially higher body levels of flame retardants than people who live in many other developed areas, and around the world human body levels of flame retardants have increased over the last 30 years.

Exposure to PBDEs has been studied the most widely. As PBDEs have been phased out of use due to health concerns, organophosphorus flame retardants, including halogenated organophosphate flame retardants, have frequently been used to replace them. In some studies, indoor air concentrations of phosphorus flame retardants has been found to be greater than indoor air concentrations of PBDEs. The European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) issued in 2011 scientific opinions on the exposure to HBCD and TBBPA and its derivates in food and concluded that current dietary exposure in the European Union does not raise a health concern.

====Exposure in the general population====
The body burden of PBDEs in Americans correlates well with the level of PBDEs measured in swabs of their hands, likely picked up from dust. Dust exposure may occur in the home, car, or workplace. Levels of PBDEs can be as much as 20 times higher in vehicle dust as in household dust, and heating of the vehicle interior on hot summer days can break down flame retardants into more toxic degradation products. However, blood serum levels of PBDEs appear to correlate most highly with levels found in dust in the home. 60-80% of exposures are due to dust inhalation or ingestion. In addition to this, 20% to 40% of US adult exposure to PBDEs is through food intake as PBDEs bioaccumulate in the food chain. High concentration can be found in meat, dairy and fish with the remaining exposure largely due to dust inhalation or ingestion. Individuals can also be exposed through electronic and electrical devices. Young children in the United States tend to carry higher levels of flame retardants per unit body weight than do adults. Infants and toddlers are particularly exposed to halogenated flame retardants found in breast milk and dust. Because many halogenated flame retardants are fat-soluble, they accumulate in fatty areas such as breast tissue and are mobilized into breast milk, delivering high levels of flame retardants to breast-feeding infants. PBDEs also cross the placenta, meaning infants are exposed in utero. Mothers thyroid hormone (T4) level can be disrupted and exposure in utero in rat studies has been demonstrated to alter motor control, delay sensory development and puberty.

Another reason for high levels of exposure in young children are due to aging consumer products age, small particles of material become dust particles in the air and land on surfaces around the home, including the floor. Young children crawling and playing on the floor frequently bring their hands to their mouths, ingesting about twice as much house dust as adults per day in the United States. Children also have a higher food intake per kilogram of bodyweight compared to adults. Young children are also exposed to flame retardants through their clothing, car seats and toys. The introduction of these chemicals came about after the tragic death of children wearing brushed rayon fabric that would ignite easily. The US enacted the Flammable Fabrics Act passed in 1953 after which, flame retardants were mandated to be added to many children&#x27;s items, including pajamas. While flame retardants are shown to decrease the risk of burn injuries in children, the risks of thyroid disruption as well as physical and cognitive developmental delays, are not outweighed.

A study was conducted by Carignan in 2013, C. et al. found that gymnasts are exposed to some flame-retardant products such as PentaBDE and TBB more than the general population in the United States. After testing hand-wipe samples before and after the exercise, they found that the BDE-153 concentration was four to over six times greater among gymnasts than the United States population. Also, the PentaBDE concentration was higher up to three times after exercise compared to the level before; indicating a higher level of the flame-retardants on the training equipment. Moreover, they also found several flame-retardant products with different concentrations in the air and dust that were higher in the gym than residencies. However, the study was performed on a small sample size; and further studies are recommended to assess the association.

====Occupational exposure====
Some occupations expose workers to higher levels of halogenated flame retardants and their degradation products. A small study of US foam recyclers and carpet installers, who handle padding often made from recycled polyurethane foam, showed elevated levels of flame retardants in their tissues. Workers in electronics recycling plants around the world also have elevated body levels of flame retardants relative to the general population. Environmental controls can substantially reduce this exposure, whereas workers in areas with little oversight can take in very high levels of flame retardants. Electronics recyclers in Guiyu, China, have some of the highest human body levels of PBDEs in the world. A study conducted in Finland determined the occupational exposure of workers to brominated flame retardants and chlorinated flame retardants (TBBPA, PBDEs, DBDPE, HBCD, Hexabromobenzene and Dechlorane plus). In 4 recycling sites of waste electrical and electronic equipment (WEEE), the study concluded that control measures implemented on site significantly reduced the exposure. Workers making products that contain flame retardants (such as vehicles, electronics, and baby products) may be similarly exposed. US firefighters can have elevated levels of PBDEs and high levels of brominated furans, toxic degradation products of brominated flame retardants.

====Environmental exposure====
Flame retardants manufactured for use in consumer products have been released into environments around the world. The flame retardant industry has developed a voluntary initiative to reduce emissions to the environment (VECAP) by promoting best practices during the manufacturing process. Communities near electronics factories and disposal facilities, especially areas with little environmental oversight or control, develop high levels of flame retardants in air, soil, water, vegetation, and people.

Organophosphorus flame retardants have been detected in wastewater in Spain and Sweden, and some compounds do not appear to be removed thoroughly during water treatment. Organophosphorus flame-retardants were also found in tap and bottled drinking water in China. Likewise in the Elbe river in Germany.

===Disposal===
When products with flame retardants reach the end of their usable life, they are typically recycled, incinerated, or landfilled.

Recycling can contaminate workers and communities near recycling plants, as well as new materials, with halogenated flame retardants and their breakdown products. Electronic waste, vehicles, and other products are often melted to recycle their metal components, and such heating can generate toxic dioxins and furans. When wearing Personal Protection Equipment (PPE) and when a ventilation system is installed, exposure of workers to dust can be significantly reduced, as shown in the work conducted by the recycling plant Stena-Technoworld AB in Sweden. Brominated flame retardants may also change the physical properties of plastics, resulting in inferior performance in recycled products and in “downcycling” of the materials. It appears that plastics with brominated flame retardants are mingling with flame-retardant-free plastics in the recycling stream and such downcycling is taking place.

Poor-quality incineration similarly generates and releases high quantities of toxic degradation products. Controlled incineration of materials with halogenated flame retardants, while costly, substantially reduces release of toxic byproducts.

Many products containing halogenated flame retardants are sent to landfills. Additive, as opposed to reactive, flame retardants are not chemically bonded to the base material and leach out more easily. Brominated flame retardants, including PBDEs, have been observed leaching out of landfills in industrial countries, including Canada and South Africa. Some landfill designs allow for leachate capture, which would need to be treated. These designs also degrade with time.

===Regulatory opposition===
Shortly after California amended TB117 in 2013 to require only flame-resistant furniture coverings (without restriction on the interior components), furniture manufacturers across the US heard increased demands for flame-retardant-free furniture. Of note, smolder-resistant fabrics used in flame-resistant coverings do not contain PBDEs, organophosphates, or other chemicals historically associated with adverse effects on human health. A number of decision-makers in the health sector - which accounts for nearly 18% of the US GDP - are committed to purchasing such materials and furniture. Early adopters of this policy included Kaiser Permanente, Advocate Health Care, Hackensack University Hospital, and University Hospitals. All together, furniture purchasing power of these hospitals totalled $50 million. All of these hospitals and hospital systems ascribe to the Healthier Hospitals Initiative, which has over 1300 member hospitals, and promotes environmental sustainability and community health within the healthcare industry.

Further legislation in California has served to educate the public about flame retardants in their homes, in effect reducing consumer demand for products containing these chemicals. According to a law (Senate Bill, 1019) signed by Governor Jerry Brown in 2014, all furniture manufactured after January 1, 2015 must contain a consumer warning label stating whether it does or does not contain flame retardant chemicals 

As of September 2017, the topic reached federal regulatory attention in the Consumer Product Safety Commission, which voted to put together a Chronic Hazard Advisory Panel focused on describing certain risks of various consumer products, specifically baby and childcare products (including bedding and toys), upholstered home furniture, mattresses and mattresses and mattress pads, and plastic casings surrounding electronics. This advisory panel is charged specifically to address the risks of additive, non-polymeric organohalogen flame retardants (OFRs). Although these chemicals have not been banned, this ruling sets in motion an in-depth consumer safety investigation which could eventually lead to complete removal of these substances from consumer manufacturing.

Pursuant with the Toxic Substances Control Act of 1976, the Environmental Protection Agency is also actively evaluating the safety of various flame retardants, including chlorinated phosphate esters, tetrabromobisphenol A, cyclic aliphatic bromides, and brominated phthalates. Further regulations depend on EPA findings from this analysis, though any regulatory processes could take several years.

===National Bureau of Standards testing===
In a 1988 test program, conducted by the former National Bureau of Standards (NBS), now the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST), to quantify the effects of fire retardant chemicals on total fire hazard. Five different types of products, each made from a different type of plastic were used. The products were made up in analogous fire-retardant (FR) and non-retarded variants (NFR).

The impact of FR (flame retardant) materials on the survivability of the building occupants was assessed in two ways:

First, comparing the time until a domestic space is not fit for occupation in the burning room, known as &quot;untenability&quot;; this is applicable to the occupants of the burning room. Second, comparing the total production of heat, toxic gases, and smoke from the fire; this is applicable to occupants of the building remote from the room of fire origin.

The time to untenability is judged by the time that is available to the occupants before either (a) room flashover occurs, or (b) untenability due to toxic gas production occurs. For the FR tests, the average available escape time was more than 15-fold greater than for the occupants of the room without fire retardants.

Hence, with regard to the production of combustion products,
* The amount of material consumed in the fire for the fire retardant (FR) tests was less than half the amount lost in the non-fire retardant (NFR) tests.
* The FR tests indicated an amount of heat released from the fire which was 1/4 that released by the NFR tests.
* The total quantities of toxic gases produced in the room fire tests, expressed in &quot;CO equivalents,&quot; were 1/3 for the FR products, compared to the NFR ones.
* The production of smoke was not significantly different between the room fire tests using NFR products and those with FR products.

Thus, in these tests, the fire retardant additives decreased the overall fire hazard.

==Global demand==
In 2013, the world consumption of flame retardants was more than 2 million tonnes. The commercially most import application area is the construction sector. It needs flame retardants for instance for pipes and cables made of plastics. In 2008 the United States, Europe and Asia consumed 1.8 million tonnes, worth US$4.20-4.25 billion. According to Ceresana, the market for flame retardants is increasing due to rising safety standards worldwide and the increased use of flame retardants. It is expected that the global flame retardant market will generate US$5.8 billion. In 2010, Asia-Pacific was the largest market for flame retardants, accounting for approximately 41% of global demand, followed by North America, and Western Europe.

<doc id="801866" wikidata="Q577747" url="?curid=801866" title="Antimachus I">
<text>Antimachus I Theos (Ancient Greek: , &quot;Antímachos ho Theós,&quot; meaning &quot;Antimachus the God&quot;), known as Antimakha in Indian sources, was one of the Greco-Bactrian kings, generally dated from around 185 BC to 170 BC.

==Rule==
William Woodthorpe Tarn and numismatist Robert Senior place Antimachus as a member of the Euthydemid dynasty and probably as a son of Euthydemus and brother of Demetrius. Other historians, like A.K. Narain, mark him as independent of Euthydemid authority, and probably a scion of some relation to the Diodotid dynasty. He was king of an area covering parts of Bactria and probably also Arachosia in southern Afghanistan (see &quot;Coins of Antimachus I,&quot; below). Antimachus I was either defeated during his resistance to the usurper Eucratides, or his main territory was absorbed by the latter upon his death.

A unique tax receipt written on skin has been discovered from Bactria and apparently adds to the argument against direct Euthydemid familial connections. The document states:



That Antimachus would list his own associate kings argues strongly against the suggestion that he was appointed as a Northern associate ruler of Euthydemus and Demetrius, an idea that anyway is more or less unprecedented among Hellenistic kings. Eumenes and Antimachus could be his heirs; it was standard for Ptolemaic and Seleucid kings to include their sons as joint regents, with variable formal or actual power. While Eumenes never issued any coins, a king named Antimachus II Nikephoros later appeared in India. It seems plausible that the Indian Antimachus was the son of Antimachus I, but it is unclear whether his reign in India overlapped with his father&#x27;s reign in Bactria.

Another document written on skin has been found that refers to his reign, and mentions a previously unknown Bactrian city named Amphipolis, presumably named after the famous ancient polis in today&#x27;s region of Macedonia in Northern Greece. This document was found near Bactra in Northern Afghanistan and reads:


==Coins of Antimachus I==

Antimachus I issued numerous silver coins on the Attic standard, with his own image in a flat Macedonian kausia hat, and on the reverse Poseidon with his trident. Poseidon was the god of the ocean and great rivers - some scholars have here seen a reference to the provinces around the Indus River, where Antimachus I may have been a governor - but he was also the protector of horses, which was perhaps a more important function in landlocked Bactria.

On his coinage, Antimachus called himself &quot;Theos&quot;, &quot;The God&quot;, a first in the Hellenistic world. Just like his colleague Agathocles, he issued commemorative coinage, in his case silver tetradrachms honouring Euthydemus I, also called &quot;The God&quot;, and Diodotus I, called &quot;The Saviour&quot;. This indicates that Antimachus I might have been instrumental in creating a royal state cult.Antimachus I also issued round bronzes depicting an elephant on the obverse, with a reverse showing the Greek goddess of victory Nike holding out a wreath. The elephant could be a Buddhist symbol. These coins are reminiscent of those of Demetrius I, as well as Apollodotus I.

Other bronzes, square and rather crude, also portray a walking elephant, but with a reverse of a thunderbolt. These have been attributed by Bopearachchi (as well as older scholars) to Arachosia. They are Indian in their design, but the legend is only in Greek.

<text>Ahmed Nazif (, ; born 8 July 1952) served as the Prime Minister of Egypt from 14 July 2004 to 29 January 2011, when his cabinet was dismissed by President Hosni Mubarak in light of a popular uprising that led to the Egyptian Revolution of 2011. Nazif was Acting President of Egypt from 5 March to 15 April 2010, when President Mubarak delegated his authorities to Nazif while undergoing surgery in Germany.

==Life and work==
Nazif was born in Alexandria. President Hosni Mubarak invited him to form the new government on 9 July 2004. Prime Minister Nazif was sworn in together with fourteen new cabinet ministers on 14 July 2004. He received immediate parliamentary backing through a formal vote of confidence. He was the youngest serving prime minister of Egypt since the founding of the Republic and the second youngest prime minister in the history of modern Egypt. His cabinet was known to be mainly composed of technocrats and well educated neo-liberals.

Having come to power replacing outgoing Prime Minister Atef Obeid who resigned at an emergency cabinet meeting, prompting the collapse of the four-year-old 34-member cabinet, pressure to undergo reforms was ripe. Nazif had served as the Minister for Communications and Information Technology in the Obeid Government. Before that, Nazif was a professor in the Faculty of Engineering, Cairo University.
However, following the Egyptian Revolution, President Mubarak announced in his first appearance since the protests began that he had asked Nazif and his government to resign, effectively sacking one of the modern Republic&#x27;s longest-serving governments. Ahmed Shafik, who had been Minister of Civil Aviation, was appointed to replace Nazif as Prime Minister on 29 January 2011. He was taken into custody on April 10, 2011, following the Egyptian revolution of 2011 that incarcerated all of the governing elite, on allegations of wasting public money, corruption and allowing others to profit, pending a court trial. On May 4, 2016, a final verdict by the highest court of appeal in Egypt acquitted Nazif of all charges of corruption.

During his tenure as the first Minister for Communications and Information Technology he was credited with establishing Egypt&#x27;s free internet connectivity plan as well as improving public access to computers through low-price computers sold by private producers through the Egyptian Telecommunications Company (Telecom Egypt), which falls under the jurisdiction of the Ministry for Communications and Information Technology. Nazif&#x27;s successor in the ministry of communications and longtime friend Tarek Kamel has collaborated strongly to enhance the Egyptian role in international IT markets and improve local infrastructure to support Egypt&#x27;s exponentially growing demand for IT applications in everyday life. Nazif is also credited with helping to found the first computer engineering department in the Faculty of Engineering, Cairo University, leading the National Identity Card project and computerizing it, and establishing the Smart Village. He has received Egypt&#x27;s First Degree Medal of Sciences and Art.

<doc id="801868" wikidata="Q422977" url="?curid=801868" title="Phlogopite">
<text>Phlogopite is a yellow, greenish, or reddish-brown member of the mica family of phyllosilicates. It is also known as [[magnesium]] mica.

Phlogopite is the magnesium endmember of the biotite solid solution series, with the chemical formula KMg3AlSi3O10(F,OH)2. Iron substitutes for magnesium in variable amounts leading to the more common biotite with higher iron content. For physical and optical identification, it has most of the characteristic properties of biotite.

== Paragenesis ==
Phlogopite is an important and relatively common end-member composition of biotite. Phlogopite micas are found primarily in igneous rocks, although it is also common in contact metamorphic aureoles of intrusive igneous rocks with magnesian country rocks and in marble formed from impure dolomite (dolomite with some siliclastic sediment).

The occurrence of phlogopite mica within igneous rocks is difficult to constrain precisely because the primary control is rock composition as expected, but phlogopite is also controlled by conditions of crystallisation such as temperature, pressure, and vapor content of the igneous rock. Several igneous associations are noted: high-alumina basalts, ultrapotassic igneous rocks, and ultramafic rocks.

=== Basaltic association ===
The basaltic occurrence of phlogopite is in association with picrite basalts and high-alumina basalts. Phlogopite is stable in basaltic compositions at high pressures and is often present as partially resorbed phenocrysts or an accessory phase in basalts generated at depth.

=== Ultrapotassic association ===
Phlogopite mica is a commonly known phenocryst and groundmass phase within ultrapotassic igneous rocks such as lamprophyre, kimberlite, lamproite, and other deeply sourced ultramafic or high-magnesian melts. In this association phlogopite can form well preserved megacrystic plates to 10 cm, and is present as the primary groundmass mineral, or in association with pargasite amphibole, olivine, and pyroxene. Phlogopite in this association is a primary igneous mineral present because of the depth of melting and high vapor pressures.

=== Ultramafic rocks ===
Phlogopite is often found in association with ultramafic intrusions as a secondary alteration phase within metasomatic margins of large layered intrusions. In some cases the phlogopite is considered to be produced by autogenic alteration during cooling. In other instances, metasomatism has resulted in phlogopite formation within large volumes, as in the ultramafic massif at Finero, Italy, within the Ivrea zone. Trace phlogopite, again considered the result of metasomatism, is common within coarse-grained peridotite xenoliths carried up by kimberlite, and so phlogopite appears to be a common trace mineral in the uppermost part of the Earth&#x27;s mantle. Phlogopite is encountered as a primary igneous phenocryst within lamproites and lamprophyres, the result of highly fluid-rich melt compositions within the deep mantle.

== Uses ==

As the general thermal, electrical and mechanical properties of phlogopite are those of the mica family, the main uses of phlogopite are similar to these of muscovite.

== Miscellaneous ==
The largest documented single crystal of phlogopite was found in Lacey mine, Ontario, Canada; it measured and weighed about 330 tonnes. Similar-sized crystals were also found in Karelia, Russia.

<doc id="801869" wikidata="Q7536254" url="?curid=801869" title="Skookum cast">
<text>The Skookum cast is a plaster cast showing the imprint of what appears to be a large animal. It was discovered in a muddy wallow near Mount Adams in the southern part of Washington state in the year 2000. Enthusiasts have argued that the imprint may have been made by the mythical creature, Bigfoot, though scientific analysis says it was most likely an imprint of an elk. Scholars and academics consider Bigfoot, and alleged evidence, to be a combination of folklore, misidentification, and hoax rather than a living animal.
==Description==
The cast was taken on September 22, 2000, during a Bigfoot Field Researchers Organization (BFRO) expedition to the Skookum Meadows area of the Gifford Pinchot National Forest in Washington state, during filming of the &quot;Animal X&quot; television show. Researchers filming for the show left fruit in a muddy wallow overnight and the imprint was discovered the next morning; no cameras were left to film. The cast, which measures and weighs approximately , is of a partial body imprint left in mud.
==Analysis==
As seen during the Animal X episode, the Skookum cast was scanned onto a computer for further analysis and also studied in person by physical anthropologist Grover Krantz, wildlife biologist John Bindernagel, and others. Krantz stated his belief that the cast was made by a Sasquatch. Professor of the Department of Anthropology at Idaho State University, Jeffrey Meldrum, also studied the cast and found specific details in what he believed to be the foot area of the cast and found evidence of dermatoglyphics that he believes are related to primate feet.

The expedition diary states that three of the six apples were gone and the melons were pecked by birds. Tracks of elk, deer, bear and coyote were found nearby. The group concludes that an animal laid at the edge of the mud and reached over to grab the fruit. Discussion in the group, of reasons why an animal would not just grab the fruit led to the possible explanation that the &quot;animal did not want to leave tracks&quot;. Chewed apple were collected and sent to a lab for analysis.
==Conclusion==
On March 3, 2001, Marc Hume wrote an article for the &quot;National Post&quot; of Canada in which he recognized the clear tracks of an elk and described: &quot;imprints left that would match perfectly with an elk&#x27;s legs.&quot; In his opinion, the cast was &quot;if anything, a cast of the impression made by the hindquarters of an elk. Hair found was analyzed and found to be from an elk.

Monster Talk podcaster Blake Smith writing for Skeptoid in 2014 concluded the BRFO cast &quot;was under a lot of pressure to produce substantial evidence for the television crew of Animal X&quot; though Smith does not suspect hoaxing, but that people with &quot;strong motivations that could easily lead to confirmation bias&quot;. The cast was &quot;handled as a sensational discovery, but not as a scientific one&quot; following their discovery by releasing a press release and not publication in a scientific journal. There were no researchers without an agenda or experts on elk providing comment. Smith states that the cast &quot;is widely dismissed, even by some prominent Bigfoot proponents, as nothing more than a cast of an elk wallow. ... which is a common elk behavior.&quot; Physical access to the cast has been limited, and the &quot;BFRO nor Meldrum and his credentialed associates have explained by what means they were able to rule out an elk as the cause of the impression.&quot;

Paranormal researcher and author Ben Radford writing for &quot;Skeptical Inquirer&quot; in March 2002, &quot;Bigfoot at 50&quot; concludes that as of 2002 no evidence is found, no bones, no bodies, &quot;[E]ach passing day should be one day closer to their discovery. ... each ... decade that go by without definite proof of the existence of Bigfoot make its existence less and less likely.&quot; If Bigfoot is real, then it will be found. If it is &quot;instead a self-perpetuating phenomenon ... the stories, sightings, and legends will likely continue unabated for centuries.&quot; Twenty years later, in December 2023, Radford asks the question, &quot;Is Bigfoot Dead?&quot;, updating with a timeline from 2000 - 2023. His conclusion is that &quot;Bigfoot is nowhere to be seen&quot;; the search has stalled and though the &quot;notable lack of evidence hasn&#x27;t dampened the enthusiasm of devotees&quot; the lack of evidence is that the &quot;creatures simply do not exist and that the apparent evidence for them rests mostly on mistakes, hoaxes, and wishful thinking.&quot;

<doc id="801875" wikidata="Q6264432" url="?curid=801875" title="John Willison Green">
<text>John Willison Green (February 12, 1927 – May 28, 2016) was a Canadian journalist and a leading researcher of the Bigfoot phenomenon. He was a graduate of both the University of British Columbia and Columbia University and compiled a database of more than 3,000 sighting and track reports.

==Sasquatch investigation work==
Green first began investigating Sasquatch sightings and track finds in 1957 after meeting René Dahinden and the two researchers collaborated in interviewing witnesses and sharing information of alleged sightings. A year later, Green was shown a series of 15&quot; tracks crossing a sandbar beside Bluff Creek in California so deeply impressed as to indicate a weight many times that of any potential hoaxer. He had been trying ever since to establish what it is that makes the tracks. Green also investigated the Sasquatch tracks reported in Bluff Creek, California, in the summer of 1958.

As a renowned authority in the field, Green appeared as a keynote speaker at three of the major scientific Sasquatch symposia beginning with the May 1978 Anthropology of the Unknown: Sasquatch and Similar Phenomena conference at the University of British Columbia. Green authored several Sasquatch books, including &quot;Sasquatch: The Apes Among Us&quot; (1978), regarded by the Bigfoot Field Researchers Organization as the &quot;best written book on the subject&quot;. It has been re-issued in more recent times (2006), along with &quot;On the Track of the Sasquatch&quot; (1968) and &quot;Encounters with Bigfoot&quot; (1980) as combined reprints with an update under the new title of &quot;The Best of Sasquatch Bigfoot&quot; (2004).

Green was featured in &quot;Sasquatch Odyssey&quot;, a documentary film by Peter von Puttkamer profiling the then four leading sasquatch researchers.

A tribute event to John Green was held in Harrison Hot Springs from April 8–10, 2011.

He, Peter Byrne, René Dahinden, and Grover Krantz have been dubbed the “Four Horsemen of Sasquatchery”.

==Personal life==

John Willison Green, was born on February 12, 1927, in Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada, died May 28, 2016, in Chilliwack, British Columbia, Canada, at the age 89.

A graduate of UBC, Green received his master&#x27;s degree in journalism from Columbia University in New York at age 20 (1947)

Green met June while in the Navy, and they married in 1948, living in Toronto, Vancouver, and Victoria, before moving to the Agassiz-Harrison, British Columbia area where they raised their children and published the local newspaper for many years.

In 1954 he settled in Agassiz, BC with his wife June &amp; raised their children. It was then he purchased the local newspaper becoming the owner and editor of the Agassiz-Harrison Advance.

In 1963 he was elected Mayor of the Village of Harrison Hot Springs. While Mayor he was responsible for the construction of the Harrison lakefront beach, where he spearheaded the World Championship Sand Sculpture Competition for many years.

In 1972 Green sold the local paper to pursue his Sasquatch research and interest in writing publications.

Green loved history and this passion drove him to be a champion of the Kilby Historic Site by founding the Kilby Historical Society in 1973. Later, the Fraser Heritage Society was formed where he continued to donate not only his time but funds to go towards the maintenance of the site. In total, he was a board member for over 40 years.

Mr. Green was honored in 2000 as BC Senior of the Year for his volunteerism in many community groups, including the Chamber of Commerce, Senior Citizens Housing, Harrison Hot Springs Fire Department, Boy Scouts, Search and Rescue &amp; the Lions Club.

<doc id="801876" wikidata="Q1122817" url="?curid=801876" title="Comstock Lode">
<text>The Comstock Lode is a lode of silver ore located under the eastern slope of Mount Davidson, a peak in the Virginia Range in Virginia City, Nevada (then western Utah Territory), which was the first major discovery of silver ore in the United States and named after American miner Henry Comstock.

After the discovery was made public in 1859, it sparked a silver rush of prospectors to the area, scrambling to stake their claims. The discovery caused considerable excitement in California and throughout the United States, the greatest since the California Gold Rush in 1849. Mining camps soon thrived in the vicinity, which became bustling commercial centers, including Virginia City and Gold Hill.

The Comstock Lode is notable not just for the immense fortunes it generated and the large role those fortunes had in the growth of Nevada and San Francisco, but also for the advances in mining technology that it spurred, such as square set timbering and the Washoe process for extracting silver from ore. The mines declined after 1874, although underground mining continued sporadically into the 1920s.

==Geology==
Volcanic vents to the east covered the area during the Tertiary, and a fault fissure opened the east slope of the Virginia Range. The east slope of the range forms the footwall of the Lode, and is composed of diorite, while the hanging wall is composed of andesite, which the miners called &quot;porphyry&quot;. The fault fissures filled these fissures with &quot;mineral-bearing quartz&quot;.

The miners stated &quot;porphyry makes ore&quot;. The ore bodies were thinly scattered through the wide Lode &quot;like plums in a charity pudding&quot;, and nearly all of them were found in the wide upper section and along or near the east wall. Although the miners extended their work in all directions, only &quot;sixteen large and rich ore bodies&quot; were found, most less than in depth.

===Bonanzas===
Six major bonanzas marked the first five years of the Comstock Lode. The Ophir bonanza was prosperous until 1864, producing 70,000 tons. Though rich, and having a length of at the surface, the ore body wedged out at a depth of . The Gould &amp; Curry bonanza included of the El Dorado outcrop, but dipped southward into the Savage at ; the ore gave out by 1866. The Savage bonanza included this ore body and a second bonanza, an ore body shared with Hale &amp; Norcross to the south, at the 600 foot level; this ore body was played out by 1869. The Chollar-Potosi bonanza was consolidated in 1865. The 1875 Combination Shaft was a joint effort by Chollar-Potosi and Hale &amp; Norcross.

The Original Gold Hill bonanza consisted of the Old Red Ledge, long, wide, and deep. The associated Gold Hill mines were merged into the Consolidated Imperial by 1876. The Yellow Jacket shared the Gold Hill bonanza on its north, and shared a second bonanza with Crown Point and Kentucky to the south, discovered in 1864.

The Crown Point-Belcher bonanza was discovered in 1870. The ore body extended from the 900 to the 1,500-foot level (275 to 460 m), having a length of and a width of . The ore, the precious metal value of which was 54 percent from gold and 46 percent from silver, lasted only four years.

The Consolidated Virginia bonanza was discovered at the 1,200-foot (365-m) level in March 1873. The ore body was long and wide, but terminated at the 1650-foot (650-m) level.

== Discovery of silver ==
Gold was found in this region in the spring of 1850, in Gold Canyon (near present-day Dayton, Nevada), by a company of Mormon emigrants, one of whom, Abner Blackburn, was their guide. After arriving much too early to cross the Sierra, the wagon train camped on the Carson River in the vicinity of Dayton, to wait for the mountain snow to melt. William Prouse (also spelled Prows) soon found gold along the gravel river banks by panning, but left when the mountains were passable, as they anticipated taking out more gold on reaching California. Orr named the gulch Gold Cañón.

Other emigrants followed, camped in the canyon and went to work at mining. However, when the supply of water in the canyon gave out toward the end of summer, they continued across the mountains to California. The camp had no permanent population until the winter and spring of 1852–53, when about 100 men worked part of the year along the gravel banks of the canyon with rockers, Long Toms and sluices. After nine years, the Gold Canyon placers were producing less, and many miners left for the Mono Lake placers.

The gold from Gold Canyon came from quartz veins, toward the head of the vein, in the vicinity of where Silver City and Gold Hill now stand. As the miners worked their way up the stream, they founded the town of Johntown on a plateau. In 1857, the Johntown miners found gold in Six-Mile Canyon, which is about five miles (8 km) north of Gold Canyon. The heads of both these canyons form the north and south ends of what is now known as the Comstock Lode, defined by the Ophir Discovery and the Gold Hill Discovery. The early placer miners never worked out the location of the placer gold, since the Lode surface structure was &quot;largely worn away and covered with debris from the mountain sides above.&quot;

===Grosh brothers===

Credit for the discovery of the Comstock Lode is disputed. It is said to have been discovered, in 1857, by Ethan Allen Grosh and Hosea Ballou Grosh, sons of a Pennsylvania clergyman, trained mineralogists and veterans of the California gold fields. Hosea injured his foot and died of sepsis in 1857. In an effort to raise funds, Allen, accompanied by an associate, Richard Maurice Bucke, set out on a trek to California with samples and maps of his claim.

Henry Comstock was left in their stead to care for the Grosh cabin and a locked chest containing silver and gold ore samples and documents of the discovery. Grosh and Bucke never made it to California. They suffered from frostbite while crossing the Sierra Nevada, and lost limbs by amputation in a last-ditch effort to save their lives. Allen Grosh died on December 19, 1857. R.M. Bucke lived, but upon his recovery returned to his home in Canada.

When Henry T. P. Comstock learned of the death of the Grosh brothers, he claimed the cabin and the lands as his own. He also examined the contents of the trunk but thought nothing of the documents as he was not an educated man. What he did know is that the gold and the silver ore samples were from the same vein. He continued to seek out diggings of local miners working in the area, as he knew the Grosh brothers&#x27; find was still unclaimed. Upon learning of a strike on Gold Hill which uncovered some bluish rock (silver ore), Comstock immediately filed for an unclaimed tract directly adjacent to this area.

===Gold Hill Discovery===
Four miners discovered the Gold Hill outcropping, at the head of Gold Canyon, making placer claims after finding traces of gold on January 28, 1859. They were James Finney (&quot;Old Virginny&quot;; a contemporary rumor was that he changed his name from Fennimore to Finney after murdering a man), John Bishop (&quot;Big French John&quot;), Aleck Henderson, and Jack Yount.

These claims were followed by claims from Lemuel S. &quot;Sandy&quot; Bowers (see Bowers Mansion), Joseph Plato, Henry Comstock, James Rogers, and William Knight. In the spring of 1859, after digging down to a depth of about ten feet, they found a gold-rich reddish quartz vein. Their discovery was actually part of the Comstock Lode, the Old Red Ledge. The four men are therefore credited with the rediscovery of the mine previously found by the Grosh brothers.

===Ophir discovery===
In the spring of 1859, two miners, Peter O&#x27;Riley and Patrick McLaughlin, finding all the paying ground already claimed, went to the head of Six Mile Canyon and began prospecting with a rocker on the slope of the mountain near a small stream fed from a neighboring spring. They had poor results in the top dirt as there was no washed gravel, and they were about to abandon their claim when they made the great discovery.

They sank a small, deeper pit in which to collect water to use in their rockers. In the bottom of this hole was a &quot;layer of rich black sand&quot;, &quot;concentrate from the top of the hidden Ophir bonanza&quot;. Henry T. P. Comstock learned of the two men working on land that he allegedly had already claimed for &quot;grazing purposes&quot;. Unhappy with his current claim on Gold Hill, Comstock made threats and managed to work himself and his partner, Immanuel &quot;Manny&quot; Penrod, into a deal that granted them interest on the claim.

On June 12, a trench they were digging exposed black manganese sand mixed with bluish-gray quartz and gold. Two arrastras built by John D. Winters and J. A. Osborn made them additional partners on June 22. Comstock and Penrod made an additional claim, called the &quot;Mexican&quot;, but later called the &quot;Spanish&quot;, adjacent to the &quot;Ophir&quot; claim.

With the &quot;blue stuff&quot; found in this trench, silver mining in America was born. In the rocker, along with the gold, was a large quantity of heavy blue-black material almost like putty that clogged the rocker and interfered with the washing out of the fine gold. When assayed on June 27, it was determined to be a rich sulfide of silver; in fact, the ore was three fourths silver to one fourth gold.

The geographic accounts on the location of the Comstock Lode were muddled and inconsistent. In one report, the gold strike was &quot;on the Eastern fork of Walker&#x27;s river&quot; and the silver strike &quot;about halfway up the Eastern slope of the Sierra Nevada&quot; and &quot;nine miles West of Carson River.&quot;

=== Fate of the discoverers ===

The miners who discovered the mines, and the investors who bought their claims, did not know whether they had made a small or large strike. The size, richness, and cost of exploiting a buried ore body is very hard to estimate even today. Most of them assumed they had made a small to modest strike like nearly all other gold strikes.

All of them knew they did not have the money or expertise to investigate the strike thoroughly. The size of the strike and its potential value would take many years of extensive work by thousands of miners and the investments of millions of dollars—which none of them had. &quot;Weighing the chances of gain and loss as they stood in 1859 the prospectors had no cause to reproach themselves with lack of foresight.&quot;

Patrick McLaughlin sold his 1/6 interest in the Ophir claim for $3,000 to George Hearst. McLaughlin soon lost the money. He then worked as a cook at the Green mine in California. He died working odd jobs.

Emanuel Penrod, partner to Henry Comstock, sold his 1/6 share of the Ophir mine for $5,500 to Judge James Walsh, and his half interest in the &quot;Spanish&quot; mine for $3,000, for a total of $8,500.

J.A. Osborn sold his 1/6 of the Ophir &quot;for a good price&quot;.

Peter O&#x27;Riley held on to his Ophir interests collecting dividends, until selling for about $40,000. He erected a stone hotel on B Street in Virginia City called the Virginia House, and became a dealer of mining stocks. He began having visions and began a tunnel into the Sierras near Genoa, Nevada (an area of no known mineralization), expecting to strike a richer vein than the Comstock. He eventually lost everything, was declared insane, and died in a private asylum in Woodbridge, California.

Henry Comstock traded an old blind horse and a bottle of whiskey for a one-tenth share of the spring at Ophir, formerly owned by James Fennimore (&quot;Old Virginny&quot;), but later sold all of his Ophir holdings to Judge James Walsh for $11,000. Comstock also sold his half of the &quot;Spanish&quot; mine for $5,500. He opened trade good stores in Carson City and Silver City. Being reportedly slow mentally, having no education and no business experience, he went broke. After losing nearly all his property and possessions in Nevada, Comstock prospected for some years in Idaho and Montana without success. In September 1870, while in Bozeman, Montana, he died of a gunshot wound, believed to be a suicide.

== Innovations and development ==

===Mining===

The ore was first extracted through surface diggings, but these were quickly exhausted and miners had to tunnel underground to reach ore bodies. Unlike most silver ore deposits, which occur in long thin veins, those of the Comstock Lode occurred in discrete masses often hundreds of feet thick. Sometimes, the ore was so soft it could be removed by shovel. Although this allowed the ore to be easily excavated, the weakness of the surrounding rock resulted in frequent and deadly cave-ins. The excavations were carried to depths of more than 3,200 feet (1,000 m) (eventually, after years of work).

The cave-in problem was solved by the method of square set timbering invented by Philip Deidesheimer, a German mining engineer from San Francisco, who had been requested to survey the problem by the owners of the Ophir Mine. Previously, timber sets consisting of vertical members on either side of the diggings (ribs) capped by a third horizontal member to support the back (roof), creating a tunnel (drift). However, the Comstock ore bodies were not veins, but sporadic pockets too large for this method. Instead, as ore was removed it was replaced by timbers set as a cube six feet on a side (ribs), front (face) or top (back), all at the same time. Thus, the ore body would be progressively replaced with a timber lattice. Often these voids (stopes) would be re-filled with waste rock from other diggings after ore removal was complete. By this method of building up squares of framed timbers, an ore body of any width may be safely worked to any height or depth. Deidesheimer was appointed to the Ophir as mine manager for his ingenious idea.
Early in the history of Comstock mining, there were heavy flows of water to contend with. This called for pumping machinery and apparatus, and as greater depth was attained, larger pumps were demanded. All the inventive genius of the Pacific Coast was called into play, and this resulted in construction of some of the most powerful and effective steam and hydraulic pumping equipment to be found anywhere in the world. Initially, the water was cold, but the deeper workings cut into parts of the mountain where there were heavy flows of hot water (mines do not always work in digging ore. Some parts of a mining operation could be deepening the existing shaft, or exploring for more ore bodies). This water was hot enough to cook an egg or scald a man to death almost instantly. Lives were lost by falling into sumps of this water, which was heated by geothermal pockets. The hot water called for fans, blowers and various kinds of ventilation apparatus, as miners working in heated drifts had to have a supply of cool air.

Compressed air for running power drills and for driving fans and small hoisting engines was adopted in the Comstock mines. Diamond drills for drilling long distances through solid rock were also in general use, but were discarded for prospecting purposes, being found unreliable. Several new forms of explosives for blasting were also developed.

Great improvements were also made in the hoisting apparatus and cages used to extract ore and transport the miners to their work. As the depth of the diggings increased, the hemp ropes used to haul ore to the surface became impractical, as their self-weight became a significant fraction of their tensile strength (breaking weight). After hemp rope, iron chains began to become more common. However, fracture was quick, at around half a millisecond. In 1829 Wilhelm Albert had studied and reported on the failure of the iron chains and began creating a twisted metal cabling known as Albert Rope. In 1864 Andrew Smith Hallidie manufactured wire rope and was heavily involved in building early cable bridges and ropeway conveyors; his wire rope went on to be used in San Francisco&#x27;s famous cable cars, and was also added to the cable drums in the hoist houses on the Comstock Lode. Another innovation was spring loaded cages. The only way in and out of a shaft mine was in the cage, cabled to the hoist.

All products, men and supplies, as well as recoverable ore, travels up and down the shaft in a cage. When the hemp rope or chains broke, the cage would plummet uncontrolled to the bottom of the shaft, killing its occupants or destroying its load. Cages were open to the front and rear, with I-beams on both sides to support the floor. The outside of the I-beams slid through wooden guides up and down the shaft, top to bottom. Spring loaded cages were designed with two swivel rods at the top of the cage, one each attached to the I-beams through bolts and lifted in the center. The outside of the rods were designed to be wider than the cage with a bulbous, round head at the end, notched with teeth molded into the rods. The weight of the cage being lifted, lifted the rods, released the teeth and tightened the spring, allowing the cage to move freely. If the chain or cable broke, the springs would force the rods down and the teeth would dig into the wood, stopping the cage.

===Processing===
In 1859 the Americans knew nothing about silver mining. John D. Winters Jr., and J.A. Osborn built two arastras, for the patio process, at the Ophir claim, and Gabriel Maldonado, a Mexican of Spanish descent, &quot;began to smelt some of his rich ore in little adobe furnaces, Mexican fashion&quot;, after purchasing Penrod&#x27;s share of the &quot;Mexican&quot; mine. These methods proved to be too slow for the Americans and could not process the quantities of ore being extracted. The Americans introduced stamp mills for crushing the ore, and pans to hasten the process of amalgamation. Some of the German miners, who had been educated at the mining academy of Freiberg, were regarded as the best then existing to work with argentiferous ores. 

Bagley introduced a variation of the Freiberg process, using the revolving barrel process of amalgamation, and chloridizing-roasting of ores, after the stamp dry-crushed. While the barrel process was an improvement on the patio, it was found not to be well adapted to the rapid working of the Comstock ores as pan amalgamation. The Comstock eventually developed the Washoe process of using steam-heated iron pans, which reduced the weeks required by the patio process to hours.

In the early days of pan processing of ores, there were tremendous losses in precious metals and quicksilver (mercury). Almost every millman was experimenting with some secret process for the amalgamation of ore. They tried all manner of trash, both mineral and vegetable, including concoctions of cedar bark and sagebrush tea. At that time, untold millions in gold, silver and quicksilver were swept away into the rivers with the tailings. The Carson river and the Lake Lahontan carry warnings against mercury. Although many patterns and forms of amalgamating pans were invented and patented, there was much room for improvement. Improvements were made from time to time, resulting in reductions in losses of metals, but none of the apparatus in use on the Comstock was perfect.

==Support infrastructure==

=== Transportation ===

Before railroads were built, all freight and passengers were transported by teams of from 10 to 16 horses or mules. Ore was hauled to the mills by these teams, which also brought to the mines all the lumber required for construction among other things. Dan DeQuille observed in 1876, &quot;the Comstock Lode may truthfully be said to be the tomb of the forests of the Sierra.&quot; It is estimated eighty million feet of timber and lumber annually were consumed in the Comstock. Lumber and cord wood were harvested with little regard for impact, for housing, commercial building, heating, and steam boilers at sawmills and ore mills. Teams also hauled over the Sierra all the mining machinery, all supplies required by both mines and mills, as well as goods and merchandise needed by the stores and businesses. Each team hauled trains of two to four wagon loads. When the large reduction works of the Ophir Mining Company were in peak operation, lines of teams from one to three miles (5 km) in length moved along the wagon roads, and sometimes blocked Virginia City streets for hours.

From 1859 to 1868, great quantities of goods were transported across the Sierra to and from California on the backs of mules. When the Central Pacific Railroad line was completed to the Truckee Meadows, this hauling was bi-directional from Reno to Virginia City via the Geiger Grade wagon road, for transfer to rail for delivery to points east and west.

Ground was broken on the Virginia and Truckee Railroad on February 18, 1869, and by January 28, 1870, the most difficult &quot;crookedest&quot; section from Virginia City to Carson City was completed. Rails were extended north across the Washoe Valley, from Carson City to Reno, where it connected with the Central Pacific. Between Virginia City and Carson City, at Mound House, the railroad also connected with the Carson and Colorado Railroad.

=== The Virginia and Gold Hill Water Company ===
When silver was first discovered on the Comstock, the flow of water from natural springs was adequate to supply the needs of the miners and small towns of Virginia City and Gold Hill, Nevada. As population increased, wells were dug for domestic needs, and the water in several mine tunnels was added to the available supply. As the mills and hoisting works multiplied, the demand for water for use in steam boilers became so great that it was impossible to supply it without creating a water shortage among the residents, now thousands in number. In this need, the Virginia and Gold Hill Water Company was formed, being the first non-mining incorporation on the Comstock Lode.

Water from wells and tunnels in the surrounding mountains was soon exhausted. It became imperative to look toward the main range of the Sierra Nevada mountains, where there was an inexhaustible supply. Between the Sierra and the Virginia ranges lay the Washoe Valley, a great trough nearly in depth. Hermann Schussler, a German and Swiss-trained engineer of great repute who had planned and designed waterworks in San Francisco, was brought to the Comstock to plan and design the new works. Surveys were made in 1872, and the first sections of pipe laid June 11, 1873 and the last on July 25 the same year.

The initial pipe was made of wrought iron and had a total length of over , with an interior diameter of and a capacity of 2.2 million gallons per day (gpd), or 1,500 gallons per minute (gpm). The pipe traversed the Washoe Valley in the form of an inverted siphon, at the lowest point having a pressure of of water, or 810 pounds per square inch (psi) at the design flow. The inlet being above the outlet, the water was forced through the pipe at tremendous pressure. Water was brought to the inlet in the Sierra Nevada range from sources of supply in two large covered flumes, and at the outlet end of the pipe was delivered in two large flumes a distance of to Gold Hill and Virginia City. The pipe was constructed of sheets of wrought iron riveted together, each section fastened with three rows of rivets. Lead was used to seal the joints between pipe sections. The first flow of water reached Gold Hill and Virginia City on August 1, 1873, with great fanfare. This accomplishment was the highest pressure water system in operation in the world, having superseded the water system at Cherokee Flat also designed by Schussler.

The water company laid an additional pipe alongside the first in 1875 and a third pipe in 1877. These pipes with lap-welded joints delivered more water, there being less friction of rivet heads on the water. Additional flumes were also constructed to diversify and improve reliability of supply.

Portions of this water system, now called the Marlette Lake Water System, are still in use today, feeding Virginia City with fresh water.

=== Sutro Tunnel ===
While there was a scarcity of water on the surface, there was an excess of water underground in all the mines. Floods in the mines were sudden and miners narrowly escaped being drowned by vast underground reservoirs that were unexpectedly tapped. Intrusion of scalding-hot water into the mines was a large problem, and the expense of water removal increased as depths increased. To overcome these troubles, Adolph Sutro conceived the idea of running a drain tunnel under the Comstock Lode from the lowest possible point. A survey was made by Schussler and work commenced in October 1869.

The Sutro Tunnel was completed from the valley near Dayton through nearly four miles, 20,589 feet, of solid rock to meet the Comstock mines approximately beneath the surface. Two drain laterals were dug, the north one 4,403 feet long and the south one 8,423 feet long. The tunnel was wide and high, inside the timbering. Drain flumes were sunk in the floor and over these were two tracks for horse carts. It required eight and a half years to reach the Lode. The tunnel drained up to 4,000,000 gallons daily.

The tunnel provided drainage and ventilation for the mines as well as gravity-assisted ore removal. However, by the time the tunnel reached the Comstock area mines, most of the ore above had already been removed and the lower workings were deeper still. Although virtually no ore was removed through the tunnel, the drainage it provided greatly decreased the operating costs of the mines served. The ventilation problems were solved at about the same time by compressed air for the use of pneumatic drills.

The tunnel connected with the Savage claim on July 8, 1878. All of the Gold Hill mines stopped pumping water by March 1882, and water was allowed to rise to the level of the tunnel. The Combination Shaft ceased pumping below the tunnel on October 16, 1886.

== Yellow Jacket Mine fire ==
On the morning of April 7, 1869, a fire spread at the 800-foot level in the Yellow Jacket Mine. Firefighters entered the mine but the smoke and flames pushed them back. As the fire burned, wood timbers collapsed and poisonous gases expanded into the adjacent Kentucky and Crown Point mines. The fires persisted and mine sections were sealed off and remained hot for several years. At least 35 miners died, and some bodies were never retrieved. The Yellow Jacket Mine fire was the worst mining accident in Nevada history up to that time.

== Later years ==
The total production of ore extracted and milled in the Comstock District, 1860 to June 30, 1880, was 6,971,641 tons, 640 pounds. Peak production from the Comstock occurred in 1877, with the mines producing over $14,000,000 of gold and $21,000,000 of silver that year (about $ and $ today).

The greatest depth reached, in 1884, was by the Ophir-Mexican winze at below the surface. Production from Comstock mines from 1859 to 1878 was $320,000,000, with a net profit of $55,000,000, most of that in the 1870s. The bonanza period was at an end by 1880.

Deep underground exploration and mining continued sporadically until 1918, when the last of the pumps was shut off, allowing the mines to flood up to the Sutro Tunnel Level (approximately 1,640 feet beneath Virginia City). All mining from 1920 to present has taken place above the Sutro Tunnel level. Meanwhile, through the early years of the 20th century, ownership of mineral rights along the length of the Comstock Lode was consolidated primarily into a handful of companies, most of them privately held. This structure was a departure from that of the late 1800s, when upwards of 400 mining companies operated on the Comstock, with at least 150 of them publicly traded.

Comstock&#x27;s silver mines were criticized for the way that their share prices were manipulated on the San Francisco stock exchanges, and for the way that insiders skimmed the profits to the detriment of the common shareholders. Insiders used rumors or assessments to drive share prices down, buy up the cheap shares, then spread rumors of large new silver finds to increase prices once more so that they could sell their shares at a profit. Mining company managers also issued contracts to themselves for timber, and water. Ore from the mines was commonly processed by ore mills owned by the company insiders, who were accused of keeping part of the silver they extracted for themselves and refusing to make an accounting.

In 1920, the United Comstock Mines Company was organized by prominent Comstock mining engineers Roy Hardy and Alex Wise with financial backing by New York businessman Harry Payne Whitney. United Comstock consolidated ownership of the entire Gold Hill section of the Comstock Lode, representing 5,000 feet of strike length and a mill site in American Flat. This enterprise constructed the 2,500 ton-per-day capacity American Flat cyanide mill, the largest in the world at the time, and drove a tunnel 9,585 feet from the mill under Gold Hill. The economics of this project were tenuous, and with a drop in silver prices, it closed in 1924.

In 1934, the federal government raised the price of gold from $20.67 to $35 per ounce, which vastly improved the economics of projects on the Comstock. Several companies embarked on substantial projects, including:

* Arizona Comstock Company in 1933 began underground mining through the Hale &amp; Norcross tunnel, followed quickly by a surface mine known as the Loring Cut and located across from the Fourth Ward School. Arizona Comstock processed its ore at a 330-ton-per-day flotation plant located near the Hale &amp; Norcross portal, but the flotation method alone turned out to be relatively ineffective at recovering Comstock gold and silver and this operation shut down by 1938.
* Dayton Consolidated The Dayton Consolidated Mill in Silver City processed ore from its own mine, as well as operating as a &quot;custom&quot; mill for a number of mines in the area.
* Con Chollar The Con Chollar Mining Company built a 135 ton-per-day flotation mill near the south end of Gold Hill to re-process tailings from several nearby mines. It later processed ore from the Overman Pit in the same section of the Lode.
* Sutro Tunnel Coalition/Crown Point Mill After several years of exploration and development on the Crown Point claim in Gold Hill, the Sutro Tunnel Coalition built a 100 ton-per-day cyanide mill to process both underground and surface mined ore in 1935. The mill and mine development was accomplished with a $160,000 loan from the Reconstruction Finance Corporation, which was paid back in under 3 years of operation. The Crown Point Mill operated profitably, treating primarily ores from the Crown Point and Yellow Jacket claims, until it was shut down by War Production Board Order L-208 in 1942.

Exploration and production on varying scales and in varying locations have been undertaken on the Comstock Lode in every decade since its discovery. There was a particular flurry of activity, including major surface mining operations by the Houston Oil and Mineral Company followed by United Mining in the late 1970s and early 1980s. This activity paralleled a rapid and substantial rise in the price of gold and silver, which was unpegged from the dollar by President Nixon in 1971.

Today, the Comstock Lode is being explored by Comstock Mining Inc. of Virginia City, Nevada, which has consolidated control of approximately 70% of Comstock mining claims. On September 30, 2012, Comstock Mining Inc. returned gold and silver production to the Comstock with its first pour of doré bullion and continues surface mining in lower Gold Hill.

==Legacy==
Nevada is commonly called the &quot;Silver State&quot; because of the silver produced from the Comstock Lode. However, since 1878, Nevada has been a relatively minor silver producer, with most subsequent bonanzas consisting of more gold than silver. In 1900, Jim Butler discovered Nevada&#x27;s second largest silver strike in Tonopah, Nevada. Nevada is currently ranked as the second largest producer of silver in the United States. Nevada&#x27;s leading silver producer is the Rochester Mine in Pershing County. This mine ranks behind the Greens Creek mine in Alaska, the largest producer of silver in the US.

According to Dan De Quille, a journalist of the period, &quot;the discovery of silver undoubtedly deserves to rank in merit above the discovery of the gold mines of California, as it gives value to a much greater area of territory and furnishes employment to a much larger number of people&quot;.

The latter quarter of the nineteenth century and first decade of the twentieth employed miners and mining technology invented on the Comstock, throughout various other mining camps in the west. Deep underground, hard rock mining was a constantly evolving development for the miners and their companies, and the tactics developed on the Comstock became famous within the mining industry, worldwide.

Two U.S. Navy ships have been named for the Comstock Lode. The first was the USS Comstock (LSD-19) which was launched in 1945 and the second is the USS Comstock (LSD-45) which was launched in 1988.

=== Fortunes made ===

Four Irishmen, John William Mackay, James Graham Fair, James C. Flood and William S. O&#x27;Brien formed a business partnership in 1869 known as the &quot;Bonanza Firm&quot;, which dealt in silver-mining shares, and controlled and ran a number of Comstock mines over the years, notably the Consolidated Virginia Mining Company. These four men were among the &quot;Bonanza Kings&quot; or &quot;Silver Kings&quot; of the Comstock.

George Hearst, a highly successful California prospector, became a partner in Hearst, Haggin, Tevis and Co., the largest private mining firm in the United States, which owned and operated the Ophir mine on the Comstock Lode, and other gold and silver mining interests in California, Nevada, Utah, South Dakota and Peru. Hearst was a member of the California State Assembly and became a United States senator from California. George Hearst was the father of the famed newspaperman William Randolph Hearst.

Copper King Marcus Daly, a mining engineer, met Hearst while working for John Mackay and James G. Fair. He later went on to form the Anaconda Mining Company, a Butte, Montana copper corporation.

William Chapman Ralston, founder of the Bank of California, financed several mining operations, repossessed some of those mines as their owners defaulted, and ultimately made enormous profits from the Comstock Lode.

William Sharon, a business partner of Ralston, was the Nevada agent for the Bank of California, and acquired Ralston&#x27;s assets when his financial empire collapsed. William Sharon became the second United States Senator from Nevada.

William M. Stewart, who abandoned mining to become an attorney in Virginia City, Nevada, participated in mining litigation and the development of mining on the Comstock Lode. As Nevada became a state in 1864, Stewart assisted in developing its constitution, and became the first United States Senator from Nevada, where he helped pass the General Mining Act of 1872.

Silver baron Alvinza Hayward, known in his lifetime as &quot;California&#x27;s first millionaire&quot;, held a large interest in the Comstock lode after 1864.

===Writers and artists===
While most who worked the mines did not gain great fortune, a number went on to be notable in their own right in the area of writing.

The Sagebrush School of journalists and writers arose out of the &quot;Territorial Enterprise&quot; and other newspapers in Virginia City. A young William Wright and Samuel Clemens both tried their hands at mining at Comstock; not prospering at this, they landed jobs at the &quot;Territorial Enterprise&quot; where they began writing under the pen names Dan De Quille and Mark Twain. The poet and politician John Brayshaw Kaye, also worked in the mine for a short period in the 19th century.

In 1939 the arts section of the Federal Works Agency invited California artist Ejnar Hansen to create a mural for the newly completed post office building in Lovelock, Nevada, as part of the New Deal program. After a visit to the former mining town, Hansen chose the discovery of the lode as a suitable local subject, treating it in the style of modified realism favored by the Agency. Once his canvas was installed over an interior doorway, it was widely admired for its authenticity, especially by miners and prospectors with experience of the desert locale.

==In fiction==

*&quot;Bonanza&quot; season 1, episode 9 (1959), titled &quot;The Henry Comstock Story&quot;, recounts a fanciful tale of Mr. Comstock, portraying him as a P. T. Barnum–like conman.
* In &quot;Deadwood&quot; season 2, various episodes (2005), several characters, including Whitney Ellsworth and Francis Wolcott, are portrayed as knowing one another from &quot;The Comstock&quot;. Additionally, the Francis Wolcott character is portrayed as a mineralogist working for George Hearst.

<doc id="801880" wikidata="Q4952097" url="?curid=801880" title="Boy Meets Boy (musical)">
<text>Boy Meets Boy is a musical comedy with music and lyrics by Bill Solly, as well as a book by Bill Solly and Donald Ward. Edith O&#x27;Hara and Jim Payne originally produced the show in February 1975, at the13th Street Theatre, New York City. After a seven-month run, O&#x27;Hara and Payne moved the show off-Broadway to the Actor&#x27;s Playhouse, opening on Sept. 17, 1975 in association with Christopher Larkin and Lee Barton.

The show is a fast-paced, light-hearted musical comedy, featuring a 1930s-style Astaire/Rogers romance between two men, and a same-sex marriage. The world of the play posits that in 1936, same-sex relationships are considered as normal as heterosexual ones. The play begins against the background of the abdication of Edward VIII and ends with the Duke of Windsor&#x27;s (and the protagonists&#x27;) June 1937 weddings. This is appropriate, as one of the major themes is &quot;Giving It Up for Love.&quot; The action occurs in the Savoy Hotel, a few elegant nightspots in London, a bar in Spain, and a black-sheep aunt&#x27;s disreputable establishment in Paris.

The original New York cast included David Gallegly as Guy Rose, Joe Barrett as Casey O’Brien and Raymond Wood as Clarence Cutler. Edith O&#x27;Hare and Jim Payne took the show and most of the cast to the Las Palmas Theatre in Los Angeles, as well as to the Chi Chi Club in San Francisco, in 1976. The show had its London premiere in December 2012. There, the cast included Olivier Award winner Stephen Ashfield as Casey O&#x27;Brien with Johnjo Flynn as Guy Rose and Ben Kavanagh as Clarence Cutler.

== Critical reception ==

The original production at the Actor&#x27;s Playhouse in New York received admiring reviews - save for a criticism in the New York Times by Mel Gussow (about the acceptance of gay marriage in the 30s, he wrote, &quot;So much for thirties realism.&quot;). “The brightest, tunefullest, wittiest, most elegant, refined, gracious and entertaining musical in years!&quot; wrote Carll Tucker in The Village Voice. In New York magazine, Alan Rich wrote that the play had “an uncommonly light and antic touch. The first of its kind that could happily play in an old ladies’ home in Dubuque...delightful”; while Robert Patrick said that &quot;it rewrites the past and presents it just as entertainment, not in the Orwellian sense of trying to convince anyone the past was like that but saying that it ought to have been”. The production ran for two years. Subsequent productions in Los Angeles and San Francisco received positive reactions. It has often been revived regionally.

The 2012 production at the Jermyn Street Theatre in London was well received by the British press. Libby Purves in the Times called it “Funny, silly and, with gay marriage on the horizon, slyly topical.&quot; Emma Slater wrote that it was &quot;an unexpected gem of a musical. The score is varied in style and form, the lyrics clever, and the script highly intelligent and very funny. Both the script and lyrics have elements of Wilde’s wit and Coward’s charm. A festive treat – highly recommended!”. Meanwhile, in the New Statesman, Ryan Gibely thought that while &quot;in 1975 this lithe blasé vision of an alternative reality must have felt subversive [the] surprise is that it still does.&quot;

<text>Euthydemus II (Greek: , &quot;Euthýdēmos&quot;) was a Greco-Bactrian king who ruled in Bactria in 185-180 BCE.

==Rule==
Son of Demetrius I of Bactria, Euthydemus II became king in the 180s BCE, either after his father&#x27;s death or as a sub-king to him. The style and rare nickel alloys of his coins associates him closely in time with the king Agathocles but their precise relation remains uncertain. Euthydemus is pictured as a boy on his coins and most likely died very young.

He was the last Euthydemid ruler of the Greco-Bactrian Kingdom and perhaps related with king Xiutu of Gansu.
