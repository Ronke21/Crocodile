<text>Dirty Sanchez is a British stunt and prank television series featuring a group of three Welshmen and one Englishman harming themselves, and each other, through dangerous stunts, which ran from 2003 until 2007. It was known as Sanchez Boys and Team Sanchez in the U.S. The performers are the Welshmen Mathew Pritchard, Lee Dainton, Michael &quot;Pancho&quot; Locke and the Englishman Dan Joyce and was originally based in Newport, Wales, but later series of the show took place elsewhere in the United Kingdom and the world. Pritchard and Locke also starred as the &quot;Pain Men&quot; in Channel 4&#x27;s &quot;Balls of Steel&quot;. The series is similar to the American series &quot;Jackass&quot; and the Finnish series &quot;The Dudesons&quot;. The show aired on MTV UK in the United Kingdom and on MTV2 in the United States.

==Origins==
&quot;Dirty Sanchez&quot; consists of three Welshmen named Mathew Pritchard, Lee Dainton, and Michael &quot;Pancho&quot; Locke, and one Englishman Dan Joyce. Pritchard and Dainton became close friends after being in a skateteam together. Dainton bought a video camera and started filming skate videos with Pritchard. They also participated in various skateboarding competitions where they met Pancho. They met Dan after Dainton saw him on &quot;The Vanessa Show&quot;. Dainton then drove to Plymouth to film with Dan for a video he was making. The 4 became close friends and started filming stunts and pranks together for around 18 months. Dainton decided to make a DVD out of it titled &quot;Pritchard vs Dainton&quot;, which came out on 23 May 2001. It was the most popular skateboarding DVD in the United Kingdom. After the executives at MTV UK saw the DVD, they wanted to make a TV show out of it. The original plan for the TV show was that Pritchard, Dainton, Pancho, and Dan traveled through the UK to find &quot;the most fucked up people&quot;. The Sanchez Boys did not like that idea, but the executives were only interested in the stunts and pranks rather than the skateboarding. The Sanchez Boys then agreed that they would be performing the stunts and pranks themselves. The first series aired in 2003, and became the most popular MTV UK series of all time. It was broadcast in over 64 countries to over 400 million people in total.

== Television series ==

===Original run===
====Series 1: &quot;Front End and Rear End&quot; (2003)====
Series one featured eight episodes and focused on each of the Sanchez members. Each episode would have them, friends and family talking about each of the Sanchez members on a certain topic the episode is about, with stunts performed in between each part of the interviews. The last episode had a psychiatrist review each of the Sanchez members behavior throughout the series.

The first series received mixed reactions. Some people called it a lackluster imitation of the American show &quot;Jackass&quot;; others complained that it pushed the boundaries of taste too far due to the extreme stunts and strong profanity, as well as full-frontal male nudity. The boys are praised by others for their fun-loving hedonism and courage in their dangerous stunts. One review claims &quot;They make Jackass look like the Royal Shakespeare Company&quot;, and also on the cover of the &quot;Dirty Sanchez: The Movie&quot; DVD, there is a similar quote by MAXIM saying &quot;Makes Jackass Look Like The Teletubbies.&quot;

====Series 2: &quot;Jobs for the Boyos&quot; (2004)====
The second series also featured eight episodes but focused on the Sanchez members trying out different jobs for one week. The first episode had them working in a hair salon. The second episode had them working on a construction site. The third episode had them train to perform a martial arts show. The fourth episode had them train to be Royal Marines. The fifth episode had them train to be airport fire fighters and the sixth episode had them train to be cowboys. Episodes seven and eight were a &quot;Behind the...&quot; and &quot;Best of...&quot; the series. The series became the biggest hit in MTV UK history and is still the only MTV UK series to be broadcast in the United States.

====Series 3: &quot;European Invasion&quot; (2005)====
The third series featured six episodes and focused on the Sanchez members touring six countries to perform six live shows with their tour manager, Johnny B, in Europe. The tour began in Sweden, then to Germany, Czech Republic, Greece, Italy and finished in Spain.

====Series 4: &quot;Behind the Seven Sins&quot; (2007)====
The fourth series featured seven episodes that went behind the scenes of the movie and showed the boys reactions to each sin that they had to perform in each of the countries.

===Spin-offs===

====&quot;MTV Wrecked&quot; (2007)====
The first spin-off series, called &quot;MTV Wrecked&quot;, was hosted by Pritchard and Dainton, which saw them get two contestants to do Dirty Sanchez styled stunts in order to crown a winner. The series would feature eight episodes.

====&quot;Sanchez Get High&quot; (2008)====
The second spin-off series once again only featured Pritchard and Dainton. The series followed them looking for the ultimate &#x27;highs&#x27; in Brazil, Mexico, Philippines, Australia, Cambodia, South Africa, India and Japan. They did painful stunts in order to get a &#x27;buzz&#x27;, they did naked skydiving, had painful tattoos to fit in with Filipino tribes, and tasted old remedies and substances such as ayahuasca and psilocybin mushrooms which are used in some countries to experience an alerted state of consciousness which in high enough dosages can lead to powerful hallucinations and a state of euphoria. This series also had eight episodes.

==&quot;Dirty Sanchez: Stage Show&quot;==
At the 2004 and 2005 Carling weekend at the Reading and Leeds festivals, the Dirty Sanchez team performed a variety of stunts live onstage at the cabaret tent, including attacking their legs with a meat tenderiser, being dragged across a sandpapered stage on bare buttocks, and smoking a bong filled with their own urine and pubic hair instead of water and marijuana. They also appeared at the Leeds leg of the festival in 2006.

On 1 June 2007, &quot;Dirty Sanchez&quot; confirmed a full stage show with DJ at Reading Festival 2007. They also performed live in the summer of 2007 every Monday at Bar M in Ibiza.

In 2009, Dirty Sanchez toured Australia with The Dudesons during the Soundwave Festival.

All four of the boys did one final show together in 2010. However, Lee Dainton and Mathew Pritchard continued doing live shows called &quot;Pritchard vs Dainton&quot;. The last ever &quot;Prichard vs Dainton&quot; live show was in 2015.

On 12 December 2019, the boys reunited in Tramshed, Cardiff for the first time in over a decade. Instead of doing stunts, the boys showed &quot;Dirty Sanchez: The Movie&quot; to a live audience followed by a Q&amp;A.

==&quot;Dirty Sanchez: The Movie&quot;==
&quot;Dirty Sanchez: The Movie&quot;, a reality comedy film based upon the series, was released on 22 September 2006. It is in the format of a world tour and incorporates stunts related to the seven deadly sins. Stunts are on a larger scale and more extreme than stunts shown in the TV show.
The film also features the first cross over battle between two stunt groups. In their tour of Japan, the Dirty Sanchez team battles the Tokyo Shock Boys to see who is more extreme. In the end the Tokyo Shock Boys refuse to do a live show with &quot;Dirty Sanchez&quot; due to their disgusting antics.

The movie begins with the boys smashing a car through a caravan and they end up &quot;dying&quot; and going to hell, where they meet Satan (played by Howard Marks), who tells them what they need to do to get their lives back.

The most notable stunts include: The boys walking on a grass field while trying to avoid the clay discs that are being fired at them by skeet shooters; Mathew Pritchard attempting to break the world record for most paintball hits to the body; Pancho getting liposuction without any anesthesia and Dan Joyce drinking the fat later; Pritchard having the tip of his little finger chopped off; and Lee Dainton slamming his forehead on drawing pins.

The movie ends with Satan being pleased by the boys&#x27; efforts for the seven sins and allows them to live but asks if there is anything else they want to admit. Pritchard admits that he has tricked Pancho by putting Immac on his eyebrows which made them fall out. Pancho becomes enraged and storms out of the set and threatens to kill or injure the film crew. Pancho storms outside and waits for a bus while stating that he feels like a &quot;spaz&quot;. It ends with a montage of deleted stunts being played during the credits and Dainton revealing what the &quot;Sleep When You&#x27;re Dead&quot; tattoo really means, which leaves Pritchard in anger. Some of the deleted stunts are fully shown in series 4.
The DVD of &quot;Dirty Sanchez: The Movie&quot; was released on 22 January 2007 by Pathé&#x27;s home video distributor 20th Century Fox Home Entertainment.

The movie premiered on television on MTV at 10:30pm on 5 August 2007. Many of the scenes and stunts were cut short or not shown due to censorship reasons. TMF broadcast the movie later that month.

The movie premiered at the 2007 Tribeca Film Festival. Described as Jackass on crack, the film is about &quot;wicked nasty stunts such as liposuction drinking games, beer enema shotguns, things that shouldn&#x27;t be done with male genitalia, and more...&quot;
The film was released on DVD in North America on 11 September 2007 by Dimension Extreme and Alliance Atlantis. The film was also released on Blockbuster. When the film was released in the United States on &quot;Blockbuster&quot;, it made £4,000,000 but Harvey Weinstein bought the film because he didn&#x27;t want to have any competition with &quot;Jackass&quot;. &quot;He bought the movie only to hide it&quot;, Mathew Pritchard said.
; Critical response
Critic Peter Bradshaw of &quot;The Guardian&quot; gives the film a score of 3 out of 5. He admits the film is not in good taste but describes it as a film &quot;you feel guilty and ashamed for enjoying&quot; and jokes &quot;for sheer self-destructive lunacy they might deserve an award&quot;.

On Rotten Tomatoes the film has an approval rating of 40% based on reviews from 5 critics, with an average rating of 4.5/10.
; Trivia
The film was shot in chronological order and was only theatrically released in the United Kingdom, it was also released on the exact same date as &quot;Jackass Number Two&quot;. The boys got kicked out of half of the visited countries because of their mischiefs. Mathew Pritchard reportedly never wanted to meet the &quot;Jackass&quot; cast. Dan Joyce was originally supposed to receive breast implants on one side of his chest; this was later changed to Pancho getting a liposuction because the healing time for Dan would be too long. The boxing match between Lee Dainton and Pritchard actually went on for 4 rounds, but it was edited to only 1 round just to mess with Pritchard, the full fight is shown in series 4. The original plan was for Pritchard to chop off a whole entire half of his right little finger, until MTV stepped in and prevented this from happening; it was later changed to just the tip.
; Unmade sequel
On 4 August 2021 Mathew Pritchard was invited to Matt Stocks&#x27; podcast. At the very end of the podcast, Pritchard stated that a sequel to &quot;Dirty Sanchez: The Movie&quot; was planned and funded, but MTV never let filming happen. &quot;If MTV did let it happen, I was gonna be having &quot;I love Dainton&quot; lasered off my knob, and have &quot;I love Dainton&quot; tattooed on my ringpiece,&quot; Pritchard said. This sequel was reportedly planned to be a 3D film after the huge success of &quot;Jackass 3D&quot; (2010).

== &quot;Pritchard and Dainton – The Rise and Falls&quot; (2014) ==

&quot;Pritchard and Dainton – The Rise and Falls&quot; is a 2014 documentary based on the series, directed and produced by Jim Hickey, and Lee Dainton. It details the series&#x27; ten-year history, including interviews with the team and never-before seen footage from various episodes. Originally scheduled for release in March 2014, it was in production for roughly six months but was restrained by MTV, who owned the rights to the series&#x27; footage. Pritchard and Dainton started a crowdfund on Kickstarter for £10,000 on 5 February 2014 to purchase the rights. Within two days the target was reached.

The documentary premiered in Brynmawr in July 2014, and was released on DVD later that year. It is narrated by Howard Marks, who had a brief appearance in the Dirty Sanchez movie as Satan.

== &quot;Mathew vs Pritchard&quot; (2019) ==
&quot;Mathew vs Pritchard&quot; is a short documentary based on Mathew Pritchard&#x27;s life. This documentary features the story of Pritchard from a daredevil with his own TV show, to a healthy triathlon athlete with his own vegan cooking show. He also tells how &quot;Dirty Sanchez&quot; started from his perspective, with old and never-before-seen footage playing throughout the documentary. Lee Dainton also makes a brief appearance in this documentary.

== &quot;The Sanchez Story&quot; (2020–2021) ==

It marks the first time in over a decade that all four Sanchez boys have appeared on camera together. The boys, along with Matt Stocks, meet up at Mathew Pritchard&#x27;s &quot;Sleep When You&#x27;re Dead&quot; barber and tattoo shop in Cardiff to discuss the history and behind-the-scenes stories of the &quot;Dirty Sanchez&quot; TV show, movie and live shows. &quot;We were planning a full &quot;Dirty Sanchez&quot; reunion tour this year, but COVID-19 had other plans so we bring you this exclusive video series instead,&quot; Matt Stocks said. This series has released two volumes so far.

== &quot;Dirty Sanchez and the Lost Wendy&#x27;s Sock&quot; (2023-2024) ==

&quot;Dirty Sanchez and the Lost Wendy&#x27;s&quot; Sock is a comedy film that follows the misadventures of the &quot;Dirty Sanchez&quot; crew. The story revolves around the group discovering a sock belonging to American-Israeli linguist, Wendy Sandler, who is rumoured to hold a significant secret. The crew embarks on a journey to retrieve the sock, encountering various challenges and unusual situations along the way.

The film is characterized by its unconventional humour and stunts, consistent with the &quot;Dirty Sanchez&quot; series&#x27; reputation for pushing comedic boundaries. Its narrative combines slapstick comedy and outlandish scenarios, maintaining the franchise&#x27;s signature style.

<text>A status quo bias or default bias is a cognitive bias which results from a preference for the maintenance of one&#x27;s existing state of affairs. The current baseline (or status quo) is taken as a reference point, and any change from that baseline is perceived as a loss or gain. Corresponding to different alternatives, this current baseline or default option is perceived and evaluated by individuals as a positive.

Status quo bias should be distinguished from a rational preference for the status quo, as when the current state of affairs is objectively superior to the available alternatives, or when imperfect information is a significant problem. A large body of evidence, however, shows that status quo bias frequently affects human decision-making. Status quo bias should also be distinguished from psychological inertia, which refers to a lack of intervention in the current course of affairs.

The bias intersects with other non-rational cognitive processes such as loss aversion, in which losses comparative to gains are weighed to a greater extent. Further non-rational cognitive processes include existence bias, endowment effect, longevity, mere exposure, and regret avoidance. Experimental evidence for the detection of status quo bias is seen through the use of the reversal test. A vast amount of experimental and field examples exist. Behaviour in regard to economics, retirement plans, health, and ethical choices show evidence of the status quo bias.

==Examples==
Status quo experiments have been conducted over many fields with Kahneman, Thaler, and Knetsch (1991) creating experiments on the endowment effect, loss aversion and status quo bias. 
Experiments have also been conducted on the effect of status quo bias on contributions to retirement plans and Fevrier &amp; Gay (2004) study on status quo bias in organ donations consent. 

Questionnaire: Samuelson and Zeckhauser (1988) demonstrated status quo bias using a questionnaire in which subjects faced a series of decision problems, which were alternately framed to be with and without a pre-existing status quo position. Subjects tended to remain with the status quo when such a position was offered to them. Results of the experiment further show that status quo bias advantage relatively increases with the number of alternatives given within the choice set. Furthermore, a weaker bias resulted from when the individual exhibited a strong discernible preference for a chosen alternative.

Hypothetical choice tasks: Samuelson and Zeckhauser (1988) gave subjects a hypothetical choice task in the following &quot;neutral&quot; version, in which no status quo was defined: &quot;You are a serious reader of the financial pages but until recently you have had few funds to invest. That is when you inherited a large sum of money from your great-uncle. You are considering different portfolios. Your choices are to invest in: a moderate-risk company, a high-risk company, treasury bills, municipal bonds.&quot; Other subjects were presented with the same problem but with one of the options designated as the status quo. In this case, the opening passage continued: &quot;A significant portion of this portfolio is invested in a moderate risk company ... (The tax and broker commission consequences of any changes are insignificant.)&quot; The result was that an alternative became much more popular when it was designated as the status quo.

Electric power consumers: California electric power consumers were asked about their preferences regarding trade-offs between service reliability and rates. The respondents fell into two groups, one with much more reliable service than the other. Each group was asked to state a preference among six combinations of reliability and rates, with one of the combinations designated as the status quo. A strong bias to the status quo was observed. Of those in the high-reliability group, 60.2 percent chose the status quo, whereas a mere 5.7 percent chose the low-reliability option that the other group had been experiencing, despite its lower rates. Similarly, of those in the low reliability group, 58.3 chose their low-reliability status quo, and only 5.8 chose the high-reliability option.

Automotive insurance consumers: The US states of New Jersey and Pennsylvania inadvertently ran a real-life experiment providing evidence of status quo bias in the early 1990s. As part of tort law reform programs, citizens were offered two options for their automotive insurance: an expensive option giving them full right to sue and a less expensive option with restricted rights to sue. In New Jersey the cheaper insurance was the default and in Pennsylvania the expensive insurance was the default. Johnson, Hershey, Meszaros and Kunreuther (1993) conducted a questionnaire to test whether consumers will stay with the default option for car insurance. They found that only 20% of New Jersey drivers changed from the default option and got the more expensive option. Also, only 25% of Pennsylvanian drivers changed from the default option and got the cheaper insurance. Therefore, framing and status quo bias can have significant financial consequences. 

General practitioners: Boonen, Donkers and Schut created two discrete choice experiments for Dutch residents to conclude a consumer’s preference for general practitioners and whether they would leave their current practitioner. The Dutch health care system was chosen as general practitioners play the role of a gatekeeper. The experiment was conducted to investigate the effect of status quo bias on a consumer’s decision to leave their current practitioner, with knowledge of other practitioners and their current relationship with their practitioner determining the role status quo bias plays.  

Through the questionnaire it was shown that respondents were aware of the lack of added benefit aligned with their current general practitioner and were aware of the quality differences between potential practitioners. 35% of respondents were willing to a pay a copayment to stay with their current general practitioner, while only 30% were willing to switch to another practitioner in exchange for a financial gain. These consumers were willing to pay a considerable amount to continue going to their current practitioner up to €17.32.  For general practitioners the value assigned by the consumer to staying with their current one exceeded the total value assigned to all other attributes tested such as discounts or a certificate of quality.

Within the discrete choice experiment the respondents were offered a choice between their current practitioner and a hypothetical provider with identical attributes. The respondents were 40% more likely to choose their current practitioner than if both options were hypothetical providers, which would result in the probability being 50% percent for both. It was found that status quo bias had a massive impact on which general practitioner the respondents would choose. Despite consumers being offered positive financial incentives, qualitative incentives or the addition of negative financial incentives respondents were still extremely hesitant to switch from their current practitioner. The impact of status quo bias was determined as making attempts to channel consumers away from the general practitioner they are currently seeing a daunting task.

==Explanations==
Status quo bias has been attributed to a combination of loss aversion and the endowment effect, two ideas relevant to prospect theory. An individual weighs the potential losses of switching from the status quo more heavily than the potential gains; this is due to the prospect theory value function being steeper in the loss domain. As a result, the individual will prefer not to switch at all. In other words, we tend to oppose change unless the benefits outweigh the risks. However, the status quo bias is maintained even in the absence of gain/loss framing: for example, when subjects were asked to choose the colour of their new car, they tended towards one colour arbitrarily framed as the status quo. Loss aversion, therefore, cannot wholly explain the status quo bias, with other potential causes including regret avoidance, transaction costs and psychological commitment.

===Rational routes to status quo maintenance===

A status quo bias can also be a rational route if there are cognitive or informational limitations.

;Informational limitations
Decision outcomes are rarely certain, nor is the utility they may bring. Because some errors are more costly than others (Haselton &amp; Nettle, 2006), sticking with what worked in the past is a safe option, as long as previous decisions are &quot;good enough&quot;.

;Cognitive limitations
Cognitive limitations of status quo bias involve the cognitive cost of choice, in which decisions are more susceptible to postponement as increased alternatives are added to the choice set. Moreover, mental effort needed to maintain status quo alternatives would often be lesser and easier, resulting in a superior choice&#x27;s benefit being outweighed by decision-making cognitive costs. Consequently, maintenance of current or previous state of affairs would be regarded as the easier alternative.

===Irrational routes===
The irrational maintenance of the status quo bias links and confounds many cognitive biases.

;Existence bias
An assumption of longevity and goodness are part of the status quo bias. People treat existence as a prima facie case for goodness, aesthetic and longevity increases this preference.
The status quo bias affects people&#x27;s preferences; people report preferences for what they are likely rather than unlikely to receive. People simply assume, with little reason or deliberation, the goodness of existing states.

Longevity is a corollary of the existence bias: if existence is good, longer existence should be better. This thinking resembles quasi-evolutionary notions of &quot;survival of the fittest&quot;, and also the augmentation principle in attribution theory.

Psychological inertia is another reason used to explain a bias towards the status quo. Another explanation is fear of regret in making a wrong decision, i.e. If we choose a partner, when we think there could be someone better out there.

===Mere exposure===
Mere exposure is an explanation for the status quo bias. Existing states are encountered more frequently than non-existent states and because of this they will be perceived as more true and evaluated more preferably. One way to increase liking for something is repeated exposure over time.

;Loss aversion
Loss aversion also leads to greater regret for action than for inaction; more regret is experienced when a decision changes the status quo than when it maintains it. Together these forces provide an advantage for the status quo; people are motivated to do nothing or to maintain current or previous decisions. Change is avoided, and decision makers stick with what has been done in the past.

Changes from the status quo will typically involve both gains and losses, with the change having good overall consequences if the gains outweigh these losses. A tendency to overemphasize the avoidance of losses will thus favour retaining the status quo, resulting in a status quo bias. Even though choosing the status quo may entail forfeiting certain positive consequences, when these are represented as forfeited &quot;gains&quot; they are psychologically given less weight than the &quot;losses&quot; that would be incurred if the status quo were changed.

The loss aversion explanation for the status quo bias has been challenged by David Gal and Derek Rucker who argue that evidence for loss aversion (i.e., a tendency to avoid losses more than to pursue gains) is confounded with a tendency towards inertia (a tendency to avoid intervention more than to intervene in the course of affairs). Inertia, in this sense, is related to omission bias, except it need not be a bias but might be perfectly rational behavior stemming from transaction costs or lack of incentive to intervene due to fuzzy preferences.

;Omission bias
Omission bias may account for some of the findings previously ascribed to status quo bias. Omission bias is diagnosed when a decision maker prefers a harmful outcome that results from an omission to a less harmful outcome that results from an action.

Overall implications of a study conducted by Ilana Ritov and Jonathan Baron, regarding status quo and omission biases, reveal that omission bias may further be diagnosed when the decision maker is unwilling to take preference from any of the available options given to them, thus enabling reduction of the number of decisions where utility comparison and weight is unavoidable.

===Detection===

The reversal test: when a proposal to change a certain parameter is thought to have bad overall consequences, consider a change to the same parameter in the opposite direction. If this is also thought to have bad overall consequences, then the onus is on those who reach these conclusions to explain why our position cannot be improved through changes to this parameter. If they are unable to do so, then we have reason to suspect that they suffer from status quo bias. The rationale of the reversal test is: if a continuous parameter admits of a wide range of possible values, only a tiny subset of which can be local optima, then it is prima facie implausible that the actual value of that parameter should just happen to be at one of these rare local optima.

===Neural activity===
A study found that erroneous status quo rejections have a greater neural impact than erroneous status quo acceptances. This asymmetry in the genesis of regret might drive the status quo bias on subsequent decisions.

A study was done using a visual detection task in which subjects tended to favour the default when making difficult, but not easy, decisions. This bias was suboptimal in that more errors were made when the default was accepted. A selective increase in sub-thalamic nucleus (STN) activity was found when the status quo was rejected in the face of heightened decision difficulty. Analysis of effective connectivity showed that inferior frontal cortex, a region more active for difficult decisions, exerted an enhanced modulatory influence on the STN during switches away from the status quo.

Research by University College London scientists that examines the neural pathways involved in &#x27;status quo bias&#x27; in the human brain and found that the more difficult the decision we face, the more likely we are not to act.
The study, published in &quot;Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences&quot; (PNAS), looked at the decision-making of participants taking part in a tennis &#x27;line judgement&#x27; game while their brains were scanned using functional MRI (fMRI).
The 16 study participants were asked to look at a cross between two tramlines on a screen while holding down a &#x27;default&#x27; key. They then saw a ball land in the court and had to make a decision as to whether it was in or out. On each trial, the computer signalled which was the current default option – &#x27;in&#x27; or &#x27;out&#x27;. The participants continued to hold down the key to accept the default and had to release it and change to another key to reject the default. The results showed a consistent bias towards the default, which led to errors. As the task became more difficult, the bias became even more pronounced. The fMRI scans showed that a region of the brain known as the sub-thalamic nucleus (STN) was more active in the cases when the default was rejected. Also, greater flow of information was seen from a separate region sensitive to difficulty (the prefrontal cortex) to the STN. This indicates that the STN plays a key role in overcoming status quo bias when the decision is difficult.

===Behavioral economics and the default position===
Against this background, two behavioral economists devised an opt-out plan to help employees of a particular company build their retirement savings. In an opt-out plan, the employees are automatically enrolled unless they explicitly ask to be excluded. They found evidence for status quo bias and other associated effects. The impact of defaults on decision making due to status quo bias is not purely due to subconscious bias, as it has been found that even when disclosing the intent of the default to consumers, the effect of the default is not reduced.

An experiment conducted by Sen Geng, regarding status quo bias and decision time allocation, reveal that individuals allocate more attention to default options in comparison to alternatives. This is due to individuals who are mainly risk-averse who seek to attain greater expected utility and decreased subjective uncertainty in making their decision. Furthermore, by optimally allocating more time and asymmetric attention to default options or positions, the individual&#x27;s estimate of the default&#x27;s value is consequently more precise than estimates of alternatives. This behaviour thus reflects the individual&#x27;s asymmetric choice error, and is therefore an indication of status quo bias.

===Conflict===
Status-quo educational bias can be both a barrier to political progress and a threat to the state&#x27;s legitimacy and argue that the values of stability, compliance, and patriotism underpin important reasons for status quo bias that appeal not to the substantive merits of existing institutions but merely to the fact that those institutions are the status quo.

==Relevant fields==
The status quo bias is seen in important real life decisions; it has been found to be prominent in data on selections of health care plans and retirement programs.

===Politics===
There is a belief that preference for the status quo represents a core component of conservative ideology in societies where government power is limited and laws restricting actions of individuals exist. Conversely, in liberal societies, movements to impose restrictions on individuals or governments are met with widespread opposition by those that favor the status quo. Regardless of the type of society, the bias tends to hinder progressive movements in the absence of a reaction or backlash against the powers that be.

===Ethics===
Status quo bias may be responsible for much of the opposition to human enhancement in general and to genetic cognitive enhancement in particular. Some ethicists argue, however, that status quo bias may not be irrational in such cases. The rationality of status quo bias is also an important question in the ethics of disability.

===Education===
Education can (sometimes unintentionally) encourage children’s belief in the substantive merits of a particular existing law or political institution, where the effect does not derive from an improvement in their ability or critical thinking about that law or institution. However, this biasing effect is not automatically illegitimate or counterproductive: a balance between social inculcation and openness needs to be maintained.

Given that educational curriculums are developed by Governments and delivered by individuals with their own political thoughts and feelings, the content delivered may be inadvertently affected by bias. When Governments implement certain policies, they become the status quo and are then presented as such to children in the education system. Whether through intentional or unintentional means, when learning about a topic, educators may favour the status quo. They may simply not know the full extent of the arguments against the status quo or may not be able to present an unbiased account of each side because of their personal biases.

===Health===
An experiment to determine if a status-quo bias, toward current medication even when better alternatives are offered—, exists in a stated-choice study among asthma patients who take prescription combination maintenance medications.
The results of this study indicate that the status quo bias may exist in stated-choice studies, especially with medications that patients must take daily such as asthma maintenance medications. Stated-choice practitioners should include a current medication in choice surveys to control for this bias.

===Retirement plans===
A study in 1986 examined the effect of status quo bias on those planning their retirement savings when given the yearly choice between two investment funds. Participants were able to choose how to proportionally split their retirement savings between the two funds at the beginning of each year. After each year, they were able to amend their chose split without switching costs as their preferences changed. Even though the two funds had vastly different returns in both absolute and relative terms, the majority of participants never switched the preferences across the trial period. Status quo bias was also more evident in older participants as they preferred to stay with their original investment, rather than switching as new information came to light. 
=== In negotiation ===
Korobkin’s has studied a link between negotiation and status quo bias in 1998. In this studies shows that in negotiating contracts favor inaction that exist in situations in which a legal standard and defaults from contracts will administer absent action. This involves a biased opinion opposed to alternative solutions. Heifetz’s and Segev’s study in 2004 found support for existence of a toughness bias. It is like so-called endowment effect which affects seller’s behavior.

=== Price management ===
Status quo bias provides a maintenance role in the theory-practice gap in price management, and is revealed in Dominic Bergers’ research regarding status quo bias and its individual differences from a price management perspective. He identified status quo bias as a possible influencer of 22 rationality deficits identified and explained by Rullkötter (2009), and is further attributed to deficits within Simon and Fassnacht’s (2016) price management process phases. Status quo bias remained as an underlying possible cause of 16 of the 22 rationality deficits. Examples of these can be seen within the analysis phase and implementation phase of price management processes.

Bergers reveal that status quo bias within the former price management process phase potentially led to complete reliance on external information sources that existed traditionally. This bias, through a price management perspective, can be demonstrated when monitoring competitor’s pricing. In the latter phase, status quo bias potentially led to the final price being determined by decentralised staff, which is potentially perpetuated by existing system profitability within price management practices. 

=== Mutual fund market ===
An empirical study conducted by Alexandre Kempf and Stefan Ruenzi examined the presence of status quo bias within the U.S. equity mutual fund market, and the extent in which this depends on the number of alternatives given. Using real data obtained from the U.S. mutual fund market, this study reveals status quo bias influences fund investors, in which a stronger correlation for positive dependence of status quo bias was found when the number of alternatives was larger, and therefore confirms Samuelson and Zeckhauser (1988) experimental results.

=== Economic research ===
Status quo bias has a significant impact on economics research and policy creation. Anchoring and adjustment theory in economics is where people&#x27;s decision-making and outcome are affected by their initial reference point. The reference point for a consumer is usually the status quo. Status quo bias results in the default option to be better understood by consumers compared to alternatives options. This results in the status quo option providing less uncertainty and higher expected utility for risk-averse decision makers. Status quo bias is compounded by loss aversion theory where consumers see disadvantages as larger than advantages when making decision away from the reference point. Economics can also describe the effect of loss aversion graphically with a consumer’s utility function for losses having a negative and 2 times steeper curve than the utility function for gains. Therefore, they perceive the negative effect of a loss as more significant and will stay with status quo. Consumers choosing the status quo goes against rational consumer choice theory as they are not maximising their utility. Rational consumer choice theory underpins many economic decisions by defining a set of rules for consumer behaviour. Therefore, status quo bias has substantial implications in economic theory.

<text>Robert Thomas Thigpen (born July 17, 1963) is an American former relief pitcher in Major League Baseball. He is noted for setting the major league record of 57 saves during the season, which has since been broken by former Los Angeles Angels of Anaheim pitcher Francisco Rodríguez. He is the former pitching coach of the Winston-Salem Dash. He is also the former bullpen coach for the Chicago White Sox.

==Baseball career==
Thigpen was a three sport star at Aucilla Christian Academy near Monticello, Florida. As a member of the baseball team he played for longtime Aucilla coach, Ray Hughes. A pitcher and shortstop in high school, he led the Warriors to the 1981 Class A state championship game.

He played two years at Seminole Community College, after which he moved on to pitch and play the outfield for Mississippi State University and coach Ron Polk. Among his teammates were future major-leaguers Will Clark, Rafael Palmeiro and Jeff Brantley. Thigpen was part of MSU&#x27;s 1985 College World Series team, recording a .305 batting average and saving seven games during the season.

Thigpen was selected by the Chicago White Sox in the fourth round of the 1985 amateur draft. He made the major leagues the next August and moved into the White Sox&#x27;s closer role. After two straight 30-save seasons, Thigpen had the best season of his career in 1990, setting the then-major league record of 57 saves (his record was eclipsed by Francisco Rodríguez when he made 62 saves in 2008). He also maintained a 1.83 ERA and was named to the AL All-Star team. He also blew eight saves that season, including two three-run leads.

He later battled injuries, starting with a back problem developed after the 1990 season, when some players went on an exhibition tour of Japan. Thigpen&#x27;s effectiveness waned and he was supplanted in the closer role by Roberto Hernández.

During the season, Thigpen was traded to the Philadelphia Phillies for José DeLeón, and pitched in the NLCS and World Series for Philadelphia. The following season, he signed with the Seattle Mariners in a minor league contract, who released him on April 29. He joined the Fukuoka Daiei Hawks and attempted to return to the majors in 1996, only to be derailed by back problems, which ended his career.

Thigpen&#x27;s 201 career saves rank him 46th on the all-time saves list.

==Post-baseball injury==
In 2003, Thigpen was leaving a Stanley Cup playoff game at the St. Pete Times Forum when he tripped and fell on the stairs, triggering massive internal bleeding. &quot;He had about a gallon of blood in his abdomen&quot;, said Dr. Kevin Hirsch, a trauma surgeon at Bayfront Medical Center who operated on Thigpen. &quot;He had significant bleeding in and around his pancreas and kidney that we had to go in and stop.&quot; Thigpen spent a week in the hospital and recovered.

<doc id="804705" wikidata="Q465616" url="?curid=804705" title="Jackass (franchise)">
<text>Jackass is an American reality slapstick comedy television series and franchise created by Jeff Tremaine, Spike Jonze, and Johnny Knoxville. It originally aired as a TV series of three short seasons on MTV between October 2000 and August 2001, with reruns extending into 2002. The series featured a compilation of pain and embarrassment inducing stunt performances and pranks on each other and the public, with the regular cast entailing Johnny Knoxville, Bam Margera, Chris Pontius, Ryan Dunn, Steve-O, Dave England, Ehren McGhehey, Jason &quot;Wee Man&quot; Acuña, and Preston Lacy.

After MTV ended &quot;Jackass&quot; broadcasts in 2002, it grew into a media franchise, which includes the spin-offs &quot;Wildboyz&quot; and &quot;Viva La Bam&quot;; five feature films released by Paramount Pictures, four of which with expanded compilation films; and a mobile game; boxed DVD sets of unreleased footage of the original TV show, a short-lived website featuring blogs and videos, merchandise, and several other videos released by various other means.

The &quot;Jackass&quot; series was controversial due to its perceived indecency and potential encouragement of dangerous behavior. The show placed 68th on &quot;Entertainment Weekly&quot; &quot;New TV Classics&quot; list, and is a significant part in 2000s American popular culture.

== History ==

=== Background ===
==== Origins and casting ====
In the late 1990s, aspiring actor and writer Johnny Knoxville had moved from Knoxville, Tennessee to Los Angeles, California, and landed work in commercials in order to support his wife and infant daughter. Among his ideas was to produce an article that involved testing various self-defense equipment on himself as a homage to his hero, gonzo journalist Hunter S. Thompson. The magazines that contacted him refused to cover the story due to liability concerns. However, in 1996, Knoxville was contacted by &quot;Big Brother&quot;, a skateboarding magazine for which Jeff Tremaine was an editor, and convinced Knoxville to do the stunt and film it. The stunt featured Knoxville testing out pepper spray, a stun gun, a taser, and a .38 caliber gun with a bulletproof vest, with the gun stunt only being included in the &quot;Big Brother&quot; video entitled &quot;Number Two&quot;, which also featured an appearance by future &quot;Jackass&quot; cast member Jason &quot;Wee Man&quot; Acuña. Other contributors to &quot;Big Brother&quot; at this time were Chris Pontius and Dave England, who went on to become a part of the &quot;Jackass&quot; cast; Dimitry Elyashkevich, who became the show&#x27;s cinematographer; Rick Kosick, who became a cameraman; Sean Cliver, who became the show&#x27;s main photographer; and Loomis Fall, who made recurring appearances throughout the &quot;Jackass&quot; TV show and films.

Around this time, up-and-coming professional skateboarder Bam Margera was filming his family and friends from his hometown of West Chester, Pennsylvania. Collectively known as the CKY crew (short for &quot;Camp Kill Yourself&quot;), these home videos were ultimately compiled and released as part of the &quot;CKY&quot; video series. The videos featured stunts, pranks, and skateboarding with a cast that primarily included Bam, Ryan Dunn, Brandon DiCamillo, Raab Himself, Rake Yohn and Margera&#x27;s family; his mother April, his father Phil, his uncle Don Vito, and his older brother and CKY drummer Jess. Like the &quot;Big Brother&quot; videos, the &quot;CKY&quot; releases quickly became a cult hit and attracted the attention of Tremaine, who saw the second &quot;CKY&quot; video, &quot;CKY2K&quot;, and flew Margera to Los Angeles to meet with him.

The video convinced Tremaine that the CKY group would fit perfectly with the idea of a stunt and prank television show that he, Knoxville, and Spike Jonze had been planning. After demo footage had been shot and pitched to several networks, &quot;Saturday Night Live&quot; made an offer to have the crew be a recurring segment on the show. The offer was rejected, and a subsequent bidding war between Comedy Central, FX, and MTV resulted in the three accepting a deal from the latter for a half-hour weekly show and greater creative control. Knoxville, Tremaine, and Jonze are credited as executive producers. Van Toffler, president of MTV, said: &quot;We just knew there were a bunch of knuckleheads out there who had a very high tolerance for stupidity and pain.&quot;

Soon after the MTV deal, Tremaine got in touch with periodic contributor to &quot;Big Brother&quot; Steve-O, who was working as a clown at a local Florida flea market, and had him film videos of his stunts for the television show, but none of the stunts were cleared by MTV management. Some time later, Dave England suggested and brought in his friend Ehren McGhehey, a fellow Oregon resident and extreme stunt participant. Preston Lacy would be the last of the original cast to join, after he and Knoxville previously worked together with Knoxville&#x27;s ex-wife&#x27;s clothing line. Knoxville told Lacy that he was making a new TV show and asked him if he could potentially write some ideas. Knoxville then convinced Lacy to perform the stunts himself.

After the establishment of &quot;Dickhouse Productions&quot;; a former Viacom company (now owned by Paramount Global) by Jeff Tremaine, Johnny Knoxville and Spike Jonze, &quot;Jackass&quot; officially debuted on October 1, 2000 on MTV. After the airing of the second episode, MTV gained its highest Sunday ratings in its history, drawing 2.4 million viewers among 12 to 34-year-olds, its target demographic.

==== Finale ====
In a 2001 interview with &quot;Rolling Stone&quot;, Knoxville questioned how long the MTV show would and could last, and soon after announced that the series would end after its third season aired. He also expressed discontentment with MTV and its censorship policy, who, from the start of season two, increasingly gave notes regarding what the show could and could not depict. In addition, Steve-O claimed that the cast salaries paid by MTV were &quot;meager at best&quot;. Because of problems with MTV&#x27;s standards and practices department, the Jackass crew did not attempt to create a finale to bring the show to a close.

=== Main series ===


== Controversies ==
At the time of its first broadcast in 2000, &quot;Jackass&quot; frequently featured warnings and disclaimers noting that the stunts performed were very dangerous and should not be imitated, and also advised viewers that any stunt video footage sent to the production company would not be opened or viewed. Such warnings not only appeared before and after each program and after each commercial break, but also in a &quot;crawl&quot; that ran along the bottom of the screen during some especially risky stunts, as well as showing their &quot;skull and crutches&quot; logo at the bottom right of the screen to symbolize the stunt performed as risky. Nevertheless, the program was blamed for a number of deaths and injuries involving teens and children recreating the stunts.

On February 7, 2001, Joe Lieberman, a Connecticut senator and the vice presidential candidate for the Democratic Party in the 2000 presidential election, sent a letter to MTV&#x27;s parent company Viacom urging the company to take greater responsibility for its programming and to do more to help parents protect their children. MTV responded to the criticism by canceling all airings of &quot;Jackass&quot; before 10 p.m., but Lieberman&#x27;s continual campaign against the show led to MTV ultimately refusing to air repeats of the later episodes, a move which angered the cast and production crew of the series who were furious with MTV&#x27;s &quot;caving into Lieberman&#x27;s demands&quot;.

In 2002, a Montana man named Jack Ass sued MTV for $10 million, claiming that the show was plagiarizing his name. Jack Ass, whose birth name was Bob Craft (died 2003), changed his name in 1997 to raise awareness for drunk driving, after his brother and friend were killed in a car accident. Johnny Knoxville, one of the show&#x27;s creators, rebuffed the lawsuit stating &quot;What could be more American than just suing the living shit out of someone for no reason at all?&quot;

On November 23, 2012, Matt-Dillion Shannon, an 18-year-old from Napier, New Zealand, was sentenced to three years in prison on a charge of causing grievous bodily harm for his role in the August 2011 dousing of a 16-year-old with gasoline and setting him on fire. Shannon&#x27;s lawyer claimed that this act was inspired by the &quot;Jackass&quot; series, despite the fact that no such stunt ever aired on the show.

== Home media ==
On December 6, 2005, MTV released a four disc DVD collection entitled &quot;Jackass: The Box Set&quot;. This set does not contain the three complete seasons as they originally aired, but rather recompilations, each including various stunts from all three seasons, arranged into 3 volumes of &quot;episodes&quot;. There are also additional features, such as a commentary track by the cast and crew for numerous stunts. The fourth disc includes additional bonus material, such as the crew&#x27;s trip to the Gumball 3000 rally (The only 1-hour long episode in the show&#x27;s history); a special &quot;Where Are They Now?&quot; documentary; &quot;MTV Cribs: Jackass Edition&quot;, featuring segments compiled from various &quot;Cribs&quot; episodes spotlighting Chris Pontius, Steve-O, Bam Margera, and Ryan Dunn; as well as appearances by the crew at the 2002 MTV Video Music Awards and the 2002 MTV Latin America Video Music Awards. The set also contains a 48-page collector&#x27;s booklet of rare photos and covers the history of the show, as well as various inside stories of certain stunts and moments from the show.

The second and third volumes of this box set had previously been released separately on December 10, 2002, two months after &quot;&quot; was released in theaters. The first volume was released by itself on January 23, 2006. The fourth &quot;bonus disc&quot; has never been released separately.

Another compilation of stunts from the television series was released on October 11, 2009 entitled &quot;Jackass: The Lost Tapes.&quot; Again being arranged into individual segments rather than episodes, this collection features all the remaining stunts from the show that weren&#x27;t included in the original box set, such as &quot;Self Defense Test&quot;; &quot;Stun Collar&quot;; &quot;Fast Food Football&quot;; &quot;Roller Jump&quot;; and &quot;Satan vs. God&quot;. In addition to the previously unreleased segments, this collection also includes stunts that were filmed for the TV series, but never aired, primarily due to censorship reasons. The DVD&#x27;s bonus features include the original cold opens from every televised episode of Jackass, the original credit montages from each televised episode, and an inside look at the short-lived website jackassworld.com, featuring various skits.

Beginning in 2013, various other box sets have been released in the USA and UK that combine the original box set, with or without the bonus disc (Gumball Rally 3000, etc), with the lost tapes disc, and often with all the movies released up to that point (5 or 7), in their unrated expanded versions.

== Spin-offs and life after &quot;Jackass&quot; ==
After the TV series ended, each member of the cast found new work in movies and/or television, each achieving their own degree of success. Johnny Knoxville pursued a career as an actor, appearing in such films as the 2004 remake of &quot;Walking Tall&quot;, &quot;The Dukes of Hazzard&quot;, &quot;Men in Black II&quot;, &quot;The Ringer&quot;, &quot;A Dirty Shame&quot;, &quot;Big Trouble&quot;, &quot;Coyote Ugly&quot;, &quot;The Last Stand&quot;, &quot;Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles&quot;, and &quot;Skiptrace&quot;.

Bam Margera and the CKY crew were given their own spin-off show in 2003 called &quot;Viva La Bam&quot;, which followed Margera and his family, who were often made the victim of the clique&#x27;s practical jokes. Bam and the crew also hosted a radio show from 2004 until 2013 called &quot;Radio Bam&quot; on Sirius XM. Margera was also the primary focus of the show &quot;Bam&#x27;s Unholy Union&quot;, which followed him and his then-fiancée Missy Rothstein in the run-up to their wedding, while Brandon DiCamillo and Rake Yohn were featured in &quot;Blastazoid&quot;, a short-lived show about video games.

When &quot;Viva La Bam&quot; finished its run, Ryan Dunn, who was part of Bam&#x27;s CKY crew on &quot;Viva La Bam&quot;, was given his own show &quot;Homewrecker&quot;, in which he found revenge for helpless victims of practical jokes by renovating the prankster&#x27;s room according to the original incident. The show only lasted one season. On June 20, 2011, Dunn was killed in a car crash while driving intoxicated in Pennsylvania.

Chris Pontius and Steve-O were also given their own spin-off show in 2003 entitled &quot;Wildboyz&quot;. Unlike &quot;Jackass&quot; and &quot;Viva La Bam&quot;, &quot;Wildboyz&quot; rejected the standard formula of practical jokes and instead featured the two traveling the world in search of wild and exotic animals. Directed by Jackass director Jeff Tremaine, &quot;Wildboyz&quot; frequently featured guest appearances by fellow Jackasses Johnny Knoxville and Wee Man, as well as recurring &quot;Jackass&quot; guests Loomis Fall, Manny Puig, Tony Hawk, and Mat Hoffman.

One year after &quot;Jackass Number Two&quot; was released, Steve-O was given a new spin-off entitled &quot;Dr. Steve-O&quot;, which premiered in 2007 on the USA Network. The show followed Steve-O as he acted as a doctor to help men overcome their fears, thus the tagline created by Steve-O, &quot;Turning wussies into men.&quot; In every episode, Dr. Steve-O helped three different men, and made them complete three challenges to overcome their fears.

Two days before &quot;Jackass 3D&quot; premiered in theaters, Bam Margera and Ryan Dunn starred in a half-hour TV special titled &quot;Bam&#x27;s World Domination&quot;. In this special, Bam and Dunn, along with pro skateboarder Tim O&#x27;Connor, participated in the Tough Guy Competition. This special aired on SpikeTV.

After &quot;Jackass Presents: Bad Grandpa&quot; was released, Bam Margera created a new spin-off entitled &quot;Bam&#x27;s Bad Ass Game Show&quot;, which aired on TBS in 2014. Bam hosted this game show, along with co-hosts Brandon Novak, Tim O&#x27;Connor, and Seth Meisterman, in which contestants were instructed to perform a series of stunts while competing against each other, in the hopes of winning the grand prize of $10,000.

Former &quot;Jackass&quot; and CKY crew member Chris Raab started and hosted his own podcast titled &quot;Bathroom Break Podcast&quot;. The first episode came out on August 18, 2018. He has interviewed every original &quot;Jackass&quot; cast member, and main CKY crew members, with the exception Johnny Knoxville, and Brandon DiCamillo. The last episode was released on November 5, 2019.

Steve-O started his own podcast titled &quot;Wild Ride! with Steve-O&quot;, which he hosts along with co-hosts Scott Randolph, Paul Brisske, and Vinny Imperati. The first episode came out on March 17, 2020, featuring skateboarder Tony Hawk as guest. He has since interviewed most &quot;Jackass&quot; cast members, and other celebrities.

Sean &quot;Poopies&quot; McInerney, one of the new cast members of &quot;Jackass Forever&quot;, also started his own podcast, titled &quot;The Shittiest Podcast&quot;. The first episode was released on April 20, 2022, and featured Johnny Knoxville as guest. As of March 2022, Poopies will also have a spin-off TV show titled &quot;What Not To Do&quot;, which will air on Discovery+.

=== &quot;Jackass: The Movie&quot; (2002) ===

After the show went off the air, the cast reunited in 2002 to film what they believed would be the finale of &quot;Jackass&quot;: a full-length motion picture version of the show entitled &quot;Jackass: The Movie&quot;. The cast made it clear that the film was their &quot;farewell&quot; to the fans of the show, and with the franchise taking the movie format, the cast and crew were now allowed to circumvent the censors, showing more vulgar stunts than the ones featured on the TV show. Despite earlier disagreements, MTV Films assisted in the film&#x27;s distribution.

The film, shot on a budget of just $5 million, went on to gross over $60 million in the United States alone, and finished in the #1 spot at the box office during its debut weekend.

=== &quot;Jackass Number Two&quot; (2006) ===

With the release of &quot;Jackass: The Movie&quot;, director Tremaine and the rest of the cast believed that &quot;Jackass&quot; was finished, and there would be no further projects under the franchise. However, during the final season of &quot;Wildboyz&quot;, Knoxville joined his former castmates Pontius and Steve-O on various expeditions around the world. It was said that Knoxville went so far out during the filming of the show that Tremaine pulled him aside and said &quot;If you&#x27;re willing to go this all out, why not get all the guys together and shoot another movie?&quot; Knoxville agreed, and with both &quot;Viva La Bam&quot; and &quot;Wildboyz&quot; finishing up their runs, the entire cast was available to reunite and film the sequel.

&quot;Jackass Number Two&quot; was released on September 22, 2006, produced by MTV Films and distributed by Paramount Pictures. As was the case with its predecessor, &quot;Jackass Number Two&quot; topped the box office in its debut weekend, earning $29.01 million. Footage for several stunts featured Bam Margera&#x27;s uncle Vincent &quot;Don Vito&quot; Margera, but this was removed from the theatrical and DVD release due to his arrest and conviction on two counts of sexual assault on a minor.

On September 7, 2006, MTV featured a half-hour documentary entitled &quot;The Making of Jackass: Number Two&quot;. When asked if the film meant the end of &quot;Jackass&quot;, cast member Steve-O jokingly commented that the people who made money from the franchise &quot;still&quot; wanted more money, hinting that the cast would still continue the franchise in one form or another. At the conclusion of the documentary, Johnny Knoxville reveals that he &quot;had a hard time letting go&quot; because he is &quot;so hooked on doing stunts.&quot; Cameraman Dimitry Elyashkevich confirmed that weeks after the film, Knoxville was so desperate to shoot that he would film himself running into street signs just for the sake of additional footage.

==== &quot;Jackass 2.5&quot; (2007) ====

On September 5, 2007, Bam Margera announced the release of &quot;Jackass 2.5&quot; on &quot;The Howard Stern Show&quot;, a compilation film of stunts that, for one reason or another, did not make it to &quot;Jackass: Number Two&quot;. The DVD was released on December 26, 2007. Special features on the DVD include the making of &quot;Jackass 2.5&quot;, the making of &quot;&quot;, deleted scenes, and a photo gallery.

=== &quot;Jackass 3D&quot; (2010) ===

In an August 2009 interview with &quot;The Times-Picayune&quot;, Knoxville, on the topic of Steve-O&#x27;s recovery and rehabilitation, said, &quot;He&#x27;s taking to sobriety like he took to drugs and alcohol, I&#x27;m very proud of him. I think we&#x27;ll see him doing some stuff here really soon. As a matter of fact, I know we are.&quot; He later stated &quot;Something&#x27;s coming. We&#x27;re pretty excited.&quot; Later, he added, &quot;I think it&#x27;ll be a big year next year, but I don&#x27;t want to talk about it yet ...&quot;

In September 2009, Margera revealed to &quot;Iltalehti&quot;, a Finnish newspaper, that &quot;Jackass 3&quot; would be made and filmed in places like Mongolia, South Africa and Finland as well as the United States beginning in January 2010. He then confirmed it again during a broadcast of Radio Bam on September 21, 2009. In early December, Knoxville confirmed that &quot;Jackass 3&quot; was being made. In April 2010, a brief blurb about &quot;Jackass 3D&quot;, titled &quot;gone filmin, appeared on the Jackassworld website. It went on to state: &quot;Thanks for the support the past two years. To keep abreast and adick of all things related to the world of jackass and Dickhouse (including the currently in production flick Jackass 3D), follow us on Facebook and Twitter.&quot;

In late July 2010, Paramount and MTV screened the first footage from &quot;Jackass 3D&quot; at a special event during Comic-Con 2010 in its 3D format. The event allowed fans to meet the &quot;Jackass&quot; crew. Then in August 2010, the official trailer was aired on MTV.

&quot;Jackass 3D&quot; was released in American movie theaters on October 15, 2010. On opening weekend, the movie made an estimated $50 million in 3,081 theaters, outperforming predictions it would earn $30 million and breaking the record for the most successful fall opening ever, which was previously held by &quot;Scary Movie 3&quot;.

==== &quot;Jackass 3.5&quot; (2011) ====

&quot;Jackass 3.5&quot; was released in June 2011 with unused footage shot during the filming of &quot;Jackass 3D&quot;.

=== &quot;Jackass Presents: Bad Grandpa&quot; (2013) ===

In March 2012, Knoxville discussed the possibility of a fourth film, saying &quot;we&#x27;re keeping our mind open&quot; and &quot;I&#x27;ve got 50–60 ideas on top of all the stuff we didn&#x27;t get to shoot.&quot; Then in June 2012, it was reported Paramount had &quot;registered several domains for a film that would be called &quot;Bad Grandpa&quot;.&quot;

During Margera&#x27;s September 18, 2012, interview on &quot;The Howard Stern Show&quot; about &quot;Jackass,&quot; he said: &quot;There&#x27;s going to be a whole movie about Knoxville&#x27;s grandpa character.&quot;

&quot;Bad Grandpa&quot; was officially announced in July 2013 and released on October 25, 2013, exactly 11 years after the release of &quot;Jackass: The Movie&quot;. It was the first film in the series to be nominated for an Academy Award; it lost the Best Makeup and Hairstyling award to &quot;Dallas Buyers Club&quot;.

=== &quot;Jackass Forever&quot; (2022) ===

In a 2018 interview, Knoxville said that he was open to making a fourth &quot;Jackass&quot; film that may feature some new cast members, &quot;just to bring in some fresh blood into it.&quot; He said that he had continued to write ideas for a &quot;Jackass&quot; film and that &quot;a ton&quot; have been set aside should the project receive the green-light. In July 2019, former cast member Chris Raab said that he had interviewed the &quot;Jackass&quot; crew on his &quot;Bathroom Break&quot; podcast and noted that everyone was still open to a fourth film should Knoxville, Tremaine, and Spike Jonze agree. On December 19, 2019, Paramount confirmed that a fourth &quot;Jackass&quot; film was set for production and scheduled for release on March 5, 2021. In April 2020, the film&#x27;s release date was rescheduled to July 2, 2021. In July 2020, due to the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, the film was rescheduled once again to September 3, 2021.

Knoxville and other members of the &quot;Jackass&quot; team also provided stunt ideas to the developer based on unused stunts from the show. A trailer and the cover art was released in June 2007 on the game&#x27;s official website. All main characters of the show were featured as playable, except for Bam Margera, whose contractual obligations to Neversoft, makers of the &quot;Tony Hawk&#x27;s&quot; franchise, prevented him from appearing in any other video game.

<text>Konkani, (Devanagari: , Romi: , Kannada: , Koleluttu: , Nastaliq: ; IAST: , ) formerly Concani or Concanese, is an Indo-Aryan language spoken by the Konkani people, primarily in the Konkan region, along the western coast of India. It is one of the 22 scheduled languages mentioned in the Indian Constitution, and the official language of the Indian state of Goa. It is also spoken in Karnataka, Maharashtra, Kerala, Gujarat as well as Damaon, Diu &amp; Silvassa.

Konkani is a member of the Southern Indo-Aryan language group. It retains elements of Vedic structures and shows similarities with both Western and Eastern Indo-Aryan languages. The first Konkani inscription is dated 1187 AD.

There are many Konkani dialects spoken along and beyond the Konkan region, from Damaon in the north to Karwar in the south; most of which are only partially mutually intelligible with one another due to a lack of linguistic contact and exchanges with the standard and principal forms of Konkani. It is also spoken by migrants outside of the Konkan proper; in Nagpore, Surat, Cochin, Mangalore, Ahmedabad, Karachi, New Delhi etc. Dialects such as Malvani, Chitpavani, Damani, Koli &amp; Aagri in Maharashtra; are threatened by language assimilation into the linguistic majority of non-Konkani states and territories of India.

==Classification==
Konkani belongs to the Indo-Aryan language branch. It is part of the Marathi-Konkani group of the southern Indo-Aryan languages. It is inflexive, and less distant from Sanskrit as compared to other modern Indo-Aryan languages. Linguists describe Konkani as a fusion of a variety of Prakrit vernacular languages. This could be attributed to the confluence of immigrants that the Konkan coast has witnessed over the years.

==Names and their etymology==
It is quite possible that Old Konkani was just referred to as &quot;Prakrit&quot; by its speakers. Reference to the name &quot;Konkani&quot; is not found in literature prior to the 13th century. The first reference of the name &quot;Konkani&quot; is in &quot;Abhanga 263&quot; of the 13th century Hindu Marathi saint poet, Namadeva (1270–1350). Konkani has been known by a variety of names: &quot;Canarim, Concanim, Gomantaki, Bramana,&quot; and &quot;Goani&quot;. Learned Marathi speakers tend to call it &quot;Gomantaki&quot;.

Konkani was commonly referred to as &quot;Língua Canarim&quot; by the Portuguese and &quot;Língua Brahmana&quot; by Catholic missionaries. The Portuguese later started referring to Konkani as &quot;Língua Concanim&quot;. The name &quot;Canarim&quot; or &quot;Língua Canarim&quot;, which is how the 16th century European Jesuit Thomas Stephens refers to it in the title of his famous work &quot;Arte da lingoa Canarim&quot; has always been intriguing. It is possible that the term is derived from the Persian word for coast, &quot;kinara&quot;; if so, it would mean &quot;the language of the coast&quot;. The problem is that this term overlaps with &quot;Kanarese&quot; or Kannada. All the European authors, however, recognised two forms of the language in Goa: the plebeian, called &quot;Canarim&quot;, and the more regular (used by the educated classes), called &quot;Língua Canarim Brâmana&quot; or simply &quot;Brâmana de Goa&quot;. The latter was the preferred choice of the Europeans, and also of other castes, for writing, sermons, and religious purposes.

There are different views as to the origin of the word Konkan and hence Konkani:
* V. P. Chavan states that the etymology of Konkan and hence Konkani is derived from the Kannada word &quot;konku&quot; meaning &#x27;&quot;uneven ground&quot;&#x27;. The Kannada origin suggests that Konkana might have included Kannada territory and &#x27;&quot;uneven ground&quot;&#x27; suggests the hilly nature of the territory. &quot;Konku&quot; in Kannada also means that which is &#x27;&quot;not straight&#x27;&quot; and is &#x27;&quot;crooked&quot;&#x27;.
* The word Konkan comes from the Kukkana (Kokna) tribe, who were the original inhabitants of the land where Konkani originated.
* According to some texts of Puranas, Parashurama shot his arrow into the sea and commanded the Sea God to recede up to the point where his arrow landed. The new piece of land thus recovered came to be known as Konkan meaning &quot;piece of earth&quot; or &quot;corner of earth&quot;, &quot;kōṇa&quot; (corner) + &quot;kaṇa&quot; (piece). This legend is mentioned in Sahyadrikhanda of the Skanda Purana.

==History==
===Proposed substrate influences===

The substratum of the Konkani language lies in the speech of Austroasiatic tribes that may have once inhabited the region. According to the Indian Anthropological Society, these Australoid tribes speaking Austro-Asiatic or Munda languages who once inhabited Konkan, migrated to Northern India (Chota Nagpur Plateau, Mirzapur) and are not found in Konkan any more. Olivinho Gomes in his essay &quot;Medieval Konkani Literature&quot; also mentions the Mundari substratum. Goan Indologist Anant Shenvi Dhume identified many Austro-Asiatic Munda words in Konkani, like &quot;mund&quot;, &quot;mundkar&quot;, &quot;dhumak&quot;, &quot;goem-bab&quot;. This substratum is very prominent in Konkani.

The grammatical impact of the Dravidian languages on the structure and syntax of Indo-Aryan languages is difficult to fathom. Some linguists explain this anomaly by arguing that Middle Indo-Aryan and New Indo-Aryan were built on a Dravidian substratum.
Some examples of Konkani words of Dravidian origin are: &quot;naall&quot; (coconut), &quot;madval&quot; (washerman), &quot;choru&quot; (cooked rice) and &quot;mulo&quot; (radish). Linguists also suggest that the substratum of Marathi and Konkani is more closely related to Dravidian Kannada.

===Prehistory and early development===
Migrations of Indo-Aryan vernacular speakers have occurred throughout the history of the Indian west coast. Around 1100-700 BC the first wave of Indo-Aryans dialect speakers might have occurred, with the second wave appearing around 700-500 BC. Many spoke old Indo-Aryan vernacular languages, which may be loosely related to Vedic Sanskrit; others still spoke Dravidian and Desi dialects. Thus the ancient Konkani Prakrit was born as a confluence of the Indo-Aryan dialects while accepting many words from Dravidian speech. Some linguists assume Shauraseni to be its progenitor whereas some call it Paisaci. The influence of Paisachi over Konkani can be proved in the findings of Taraporewala, who in his book &quot;Elements of Science of Languages&quot; (Calcutta University) ascertained that Konkani showed many Dardic features that are found in present-day Kashmiri. Thus, the archaic form of old Konkani is referred to as Paishachi by some linguists. This progenitor of Konkani (or Paishachi Apabhramsha) has preserved an older form of phonetic and grammatic development, showing a great variety of verbal forms found in Sanskrit and a large number of grammatical forms that are not found in Marathi. (Examples of this are found in many works like &quot;Dnyaneshwari&quot;, and &quot;Leela Charitra&quot;.) Konkani thus developed with overall Sanskrit complexity and grammatical structure, which eventually developed into a lexical fund of its own. The second wave of Indo-Aryans is believed to have been accompanied by Dravidians from the Deccan plateau. Paishachi is also considered to be an Aryan language spoken by Dravidians.

Goa and Konkan were ruled by the Konkan Mauryas and the Bhojas; as a result, numerous migrations occurred from north, east and western India. Immigrants spoke various vernacular languages, which led to a mixture of features of Eastern and Western Prakrit. It was later substantially influenced by Magadhi Prakrit. The overtones of Pali (the liturgical language of the Buddhists) also played a very important role in the development of Konkani Apabhramsha grammar and vocabulary. A major number of linguistic innovations in Konkani are shared with Eastern Indo-Aryan languages like Bengali and Oriya, which have their roots in Magadhi.

Maharashtri Prakrit is the ancestor of Marathi and Konkani, it was the official language of the Satavahana Empire that ruled Goa and Konkan in the early centuries of the Common Era. Under the patronage of the Satavahana Empire, Maharashtri became the most widespread Prakrit of its time. Studying early Maharashtri compilations, many linguists have called Konkani &quot;the first-born daughter of Maharashtri&quot;. This old language that was prevalent contemporary to old Marathi is found to be distinct from its counterpart.

The Sauraseni impact on Konkani is not as prominent as that of Maharashtri. Very few Konkani words are found to follow the Sauraseni pattern. Konkani forms are rather more akin to Pali than the corresponding Sauraseni forms. The major Sauraseni influence on Konkani is the &quot;ao&quot; sound found at the end of many nouns in Sauraseni, which becomes &quot;o&quot; or &quot;u&quot; in Konkani. Examples include: &quot;dando&quot;, &quot;suno&quot;, &quot;raakhano&quot;, &quot;dukh&quot;, &quot;rukhu&quot;, &quot;manisu&quot; (from Prakrit), &quot;dandao&quot;, &quot;sunnao&quot;, &quot;rakkhakao&quot;, &quot;dukkhao&quot;, &quot;vukkhao&quot;, &quot;vrukkhao&quot;, and &quot;mannisso&quot;. Another example could be the sound of &quot;ण&quot; at the beginning of words; it is still retained in many Konkani words of archaic Shauraseni origin, such as णव (nine). Archaic Konkani born out of Shauraseni vernacular Prakrit at the earlier stage of the evolution (and later Maharashtri Prakrit), was commonly spoken until 875 AD, and at its later phase ultimately developed into Apabhramsha, which could be called a predecessor of old Konkani.

Although most of the stone inscriptions and copper plates found in Goa (and other parts of Konkan) from the 2nd century BC to the 10th century AD are in Prakrit-influenced Sanskrit (mostly written in early Brahmi and archaic Dravidian Brahmi), most of the places, grants, agricultural-related terms, and names of some people are in Konkani. This suggests that Konkani was spoken in Goa and Konkan.

Though it belongs to the Indo-Aryan group, Konkani was influenced by a language of the Dravidian family. A branch of the Kadambas, who ruled Goa for a long period, had their roots in Karnataka. Konkani was never used for official purposes. Another reason Kannada influenced Konkani was the proximity of original Konkani-speaking territories to Karnataka. Old Konkani documents show considerable Kannada influence on grammar as well as vocabulary. Like southern Dravidian languages, Konkani has prothetic glides &quot;y-&quot; and &quot;w-&quot;. The Kannada influence is more evident in Konkani syntax. The question markers in &quot;yes/no&quot; questions and the negative marker are sentence final. Copula deletion in Konkani is remarkably similar to Kannada. Phrasal verbs are not so commonly used in Indo-Aryan languages; however, Konkani spoken in Dravidian regions has borrowed numerous phrasal verb patterns.

The Kols, Kharwas, Yadavas, and Lothal migrants all settled in Goa during the pre-historic period and later. &quot;Chavada&quot;, a tribe of warriors (now known as &quot;Chaddi&quot; or &quot;Chaddo&quot;), migrated to Goa from Saurashtra, during the 7th and 8th century AD, after their kingdom was destroyed by the Arabs in 740. Royal matrimonial relationships between the two states, as well as trade relationships, had a major impact on Goan society. Many of these groups spoke different Nagar Apabhramsha dialects, which could be seen as precursors of modern Gujarati.
* Konkani and Gujarati have many words in common, not found in Marathi.
* The Konkani &quot;O&quot; (as opposed to the Marathi &quot;A&quot;, which is of different Prakrit origin), is similar to that in Gujarati.
* The case terminations in Konkani, &quot;lo&quot;, &quot;li&quot;, and &quot;le&quot;, and the Gujarati &quot;no&quot;, &quot;ni&quot;, and &quot;ne&quot; have the same Prakrit roots.
* In both languages the present indicatives have no gender, unlike Marathi.

===Early===
An inscription at the foot of the colossal Jain monolith Bahubali (The word &quot;gomateshvara&quot; apparently comes from Konkani &quot;&quot; which means &quot;beautiful&quot; or &quot;handsome&quot; and &quot;īśvara&quot; &quot;lord&quot;.) at Shravanabelagola of 981 CE reads, in a variant of Nāgarī: The language of these lines is Konkani according to S.B. Kulkarni (former head of Department of Marathi, Nagpur University) and Jose Pereira (former professor, Fordham University, USA).

Another inscription in Nāgarī, of Shilahara King Aparaditya II of the year 1187 AD in Parel reportedly contains Konkani words, but this has not been reliably verified.

Many stone and copper-plate inscriptions found in Goa and Konkan are written in Konkani. The grammar and the base of such texts is in Konkani, whereas very few verbs are in Marathi. Copper plates found in Ponda dating back to the early 13th century, and from Quepem in the early 14th century, have been written in Goykanadi. One such stone inscription or &quot;shilalekh&quot; (written Nāgarī) is found at the Nageshi temple in Goa (dating back to the year 1463 AD). It mentions that the (then) ruler of Goa, Devaraja Gominam, had gifted land to the Nagueshi Maharudra temple when Nanjanna Gosavi was the religious head or &quot;Pratihasta&quot; of the state. It mentions words like, &quot;kullgga&quot;, &quot;kulaagra&quot;, &quot;naralel&quot;, &quot;tambavem&quot;, and &quot;tilel&quot;.
A piece of hymn dedicated to Lord Narayana attributed to the 12th century AD says: A hymn from the later 16th century goes 

Early Konkani was marked by the use of pronouns like &quot;dzo&quot;, &quot;jī&quot;, and &quot;jẽ&quot;. These are replaced in contemporary Konkani by &quot;koṇa&quot;. The conjunctions &quot;yedō&quot; and &quot;tedō&quot; (&quot;when&quot; and &quot;then&quot;) which were used in early Konkani are no longer in use. The use of &quot;-viyalẽ&quot; has been replaced by &quot;-aylẽ&quot;. The pronoun &quot;moho&quot;, which is similar to the Brajbhasha word &quot;mōhē&quot; has been replaced by &quot;mākā&quot;.

===Medieval===
This era was marked by several invasions of Goa and subsequent exodus of some Konkani families to Canara (today&#x27;s coastal Karnataka), and Cochin.
* Exodus (between 1312–1327) when General Malik Kafur of the Delhi Sultans, Alauddin Khalji, and Muhammed bin Tughlaq destroyed Govepuri and the Kadambas
* Exodus subsequent to 1470 when the Bahamani kingdom captured Goa, and subsequent capture in 1492 by Sultan Yusuf Adil Shah of Bijapur
* Exodus of converted Muslims to Bijapur-held territory due to the Portuguese conquest of Goa in 1510
* Migration of Hindu converts to Canara in South India after the Christianisation of Goa, the subsequent Goa Inquisition, and the Sackings of Goa and Bombay-Bassein.

These events caused the Konkani language to develop into multiple dialects with multiple scripts. The exodus to coastal Karnataka and Kerala required Konkani speakers in these regions to learn the local languages. This caused penetration of local words into the dialects of Konkani spoken by these speakers. Examples include &quot;dār&quot; (door) giving way to the word &quot;bāgil&quot;. Also, the phoneme &quot;a&quot; in the Salcette dialect was replaced by the phoneme &quot;o&quot;.

Other Konkani communities came into being with their own dialects of Konkani. The Konkani Muslim communities of Ratnagiri and Coastal Karnataka came about due to a mixture of intermarriages of Arab seafarers, Middle East businessman, Britishes and locals as well as conversions of Hindus to Islam. Another migrant community that picked up Konkani are the Siddis, who are descended from Bantu peoples from South East Africa that were brought to the Indian subcontinent as slaves.

===Contemporary===
Contemporary Konkani is written in Devanagari, Kannada, Malayalam, Persian, and Roman scripts. It is written by speakers in their native dialects. The Goan Antruz dialect in the Devanagari script has been promulgated as Standard Konkani.

==Revitalisation==
Konkani language was in decline, due to the use of Portuguese as the official and social language among the Christians, the predominance of Marathi over Konkani among Hindus, and the Konkani Christian-Hindu divide. Seeing this, Vaman Raghunath Varde Valaulikar set about on a mission to unite all Konkanis, Hindus as well as Christians, regardless of caste or religion. He saw this movement not just as a nationalistic movement against Portuguese rule, but also against the pre-eminence of Marathi over Konkani. Almost single-handedly he crusaded, writing a number of works in Konkani. He is regarded as the pioneer of modern Konkani literature and affectionately remembered as Shenoi Goembab. His death anniversary, 9 April, is celebrated as World Konkani Day (Vishwa Konkani Dis).

Madhav Manjunath Shanbhag, an advocate by profession from Karwar, who with a few like-minded companions travelled throughout all the Konkani speaking areas, sought to unite the fragmented Konkani community under the banner of &quot;one language, one script, one literature&quot;. He succeeded in organising the first All India Konkani Parishad in Karwar in 1939. Successive Adhiveshans of All India Konkani Parishad were held at various places in subsequent years. 27 annual Adhiveshans of All India Konkani Parishad have been held so far.

Pandu Putti Kolambkar an eminent social worker of Kodibag, Karwar was a close associate of Shri Waman Raghunath Shennoi Varde Valaulikar, strove hard for the upliftment of Konkani in Karwar (North Kanara) and Konkan Patti.

===Post-independence period===
Following India&#x27;s independence and its subsequent annexation of Goa in 1961, Goa was absorbed into the Indian Union as a Union Territory, directly under central administration.

However, with the reorganisation of states along linguistic lines, and growing calls from Maharashtra, as well as Marathis in Goa for the merger of Goa into Maharashtra, an intense debate was started in Goa. The main issues discussed were the status of Konkani as an independent language and Goa&#x27;s future as a part of Maharashtra or as an independent state. The Goa Opinion Poll, a plebiscite, retained Goa as an independent state in 1967. However, English, Hindi, and Marathi continued to be the preferred languages for official communication, while Konkani was sidelined.

===Recognition as an independent language===
With the continued insistence of some Marathis that Konkani was a dialect of Marathi and not an independent language, the matter was finally placed before the Sahitya Akademi. Suniti Kumar Chatterji, the president of the Akademi appointed a committee of linguistic experts to settle the dispute. On 26 February 1975, the committee came to the conclusion that Konkani was indeed an independent and literary language, classified as an Indo-European language, which in its present state was heavily influenced by the Portuguese language.

===Official language status===
All this did not change anything in Goa. Finally, fed up with the delay, Konkani activists launched an agitation in 1986, demanding official status for Konkani. The agitation turned violent in various places, resulting in the death of six agitators from the Catholic community: Floriano Vaz from Gogol Margao, Aldrin Fernandes, Mathew Faria, C. J. Dias, John Fernandes, and Joaquim Pereira, all from Agaçaim. Finally, on 4 February 1987, the Goa Legislative Assembly passed the Official Language Bill, making Konkani the official language of Goa.

Konkani was included in the Eighth Schedule to the Constitution of India as per the Seventy-First Amendment on 20 August 1992, adding it to the list of official languages.

==Geographical distribution==

The Konkani language originated and is spoken widely in the western coastal region of India known as Konkan. The native lands historically inhabited by Konkani people include the Konkan division of Maharashtra, the state of Goa and the territory of Daman, the Uttara Kannada, Udupi &amp; Dakshina Kannada districts of Karnataka, belagavi, Mysore, and Bengaluru along with many districts in Kerala such as Kasaragod, Kochi, Alappuzha, Thiruvananthapuram and Kottayam. All of the regions and areas have developed distinct dialects, pronunciation and prose styles, vocabulary, tone, and sometimes, significant differences in grammar.

According to the 2001 estimates of the Census Department of India, there were 2,489,016 Konkani speakers in India. The Census Department of India, 2011 figures put the number of Konkani speakers in India as 2,256,502 making up 0.19% of India&#x27;s population. Out of these, 788,294 were in Karnataka, 964,305 in Goa, 399,255 in Maharashtra, and 69,449 in Kerala. It ranks 19th on the List of Scheduled Languages by strength. The number of Konkani speakers in India fell by 9.34% in the decade 2001-2011. It is the only scheduled language apart from Urdu to have a negative growth rate in the decade. A very large number of Konkanis live outside India, either as expatriates (NRIs) with work visas or as naturalised citizens and permanent residents of other host countries (immigrants). Determining their numbers is difficult since Konkani is a minority language that is very often not recognised by censuses and surveys of various government agencies and NGOs catering to Indians abroad.

During the days of Portuguese Goa and British rule in Pre-Partition India many Goans and non-Goan Konkani people went to foreign countries as economic migrants to the colonies of Portuguese and British Empire respectively, and also to the Pakistan of Pre-Partition India. The migratory trend has continued well into the post-colonial era and a significant number of Konkani people are found in Kenya, Uganda, Pakistan, the Persian Gulf countries, Portugal and the European Union, and the British Isles and the rest of the Anglosphere. Many families still continue to speak different Konkani dialects that their ancestors spoke, which are now highly influenced by the languages of the dominant majority.

==Current status and issues==

The Konkani language has been in danger of dying out over the years for many of the following reasons:
# The fragmentation of Konkani into various, sometimes mutually unintelligible, dialects.
# The dominance of Marathi and the large degree of bilingualism of Konkani Hindus in Goa state, the union territory of Damaon and the Konkan division of Maharashtra.
# Progressive inroads made by Urdu into the Konkani Muslim community.
# Mutual animosity among various religious sects and caste groups; including a secondary status of Konkani culture to religion.
# The migration of Konkanis to various parts of India and around the world.
# The lack of opportunities to study Konkani in schools and colleges. Even until recently there were few Konkani schools in Goa. Populations outside the native Konkani areas have absolutely no access to Konkani language studies, literature and media.
# The preference among Konkani parents to speak to their children in &quot;potaachi bhaas&quot; (language of the stomach) over &quot;maai bhaas&quot; (mother tongue). They sometimes speak primarily in English to help their children gain a grip on English in schools.

Efforts have been made to stop this downward trend of usage of Konkani, starting with Shenoi Goembab&#x27;s efforts to revive Konkani. The recognition granted by Sahitya Akademi to Konkani and the institution of an annual award for Konkani literature has helped to a certain extent.

Some organisations, such as the Konkan Daiz Yatra organised by Konkani Bhasha Mandal, World Konkani Centre and the newer Vishwa Konkani Parishad have laid great stress on uniting all factions of Konkanis.

===Opposition===
====Marathi dispute====

José Pereira, in his 1971 work &quot;Konkani – A Language: A History of the Konkani Marathi Controversy&quot;, pointed to an essay on Indian languages written by John Leyden in 1807, wherein Konkani is called a &quot;dialect of Maharashtra&quot; as an origin of the language controversy.

Another linguist to whom this theory is attributed is Grierson. Grierson&#x27;s work on the languages of India, &quot;the Linguistic Survey of India&quot;, was regarded as an important reference by other linguists. In his book, Grierson had distinguished between the Konkani spoken in coastal Maharashtra (then, part of Bombay) and the Konkani spoken in Goa as two different languages. He regarded the Konkani spoken in coastal Maharashtra as a dialect of Marathi and not as a dialect of Goan Konkani itself. In his opinion, Goan Konkani was also considered a dialect of Marathi because the religious literature used by the Hindus in Goa was not in Konkani itself, but in Marathi.

S. M. Katre&#x27;s 1966 work, &quot;The Formation of Konkani&quot;, which utilised the instruments of modern historical and comparative linguistics across six typical Konkani dialects, showed the formation of Konkani to be distinct from that of Marathi. Shenoi Goembab, who played a pivotal role in the Konkani revival movement, rallied against the pre-eminence of Marathi over Konkani amongst Hindus and Portuguese amongst Christians.

Goa&#x27;s accession to India in 1961 came at a time when Indian states were being reorganised along linguistic lines. There were demands to merge Goa with Maharashtra. This was because Goa had a sizeable population of Marathi speakers and Konkani was also considered to be a dialect of Marathi by many. Konkani Goans were opposed to the move. The status of Konkani as an independent language or as a dialect of Marathi had a great political bearing on Goa&#x27;s merger, which was settled by a plebiscite in 1967 (the Goa Opinion Poll).

The Sahitya Akademi (a prominent literary organisation in India) recognised it as an independent language in 1975, and subsequently Konkani (in Devanagari script) was made the official language of Goa in 1987.

===Karnataka===

MLC Ivan D&#x27;Souza attempted to speak in Konkani at the Karnataka state&#x27;s Legislative Council, but was urged not to by the Chairman D H Shankaramurthy as most of the audience did not know Konkani. Even though Mr D&#x27;Souza pleaded that Konkani was amongst the 22 official languages recognised by the Indian Constitution, he was not given permission to continue in Konkani.

Even though there are substantial Konkani Catholics in Bengaluru, efforts to celebrate Holy Mass in Konkani have met with opposition by Kannada &quot;activists&quot;. Konkani Holy Masses has been held in the Sabbhavana and Saccidananda chapels of the Carmelite and Capuchin Fathers respectively, in Yeswanthpur and Rajajinagar, Bangalore. These services are under threat from Kannada groups who do not want church services to be held in any language other than Kannada, even though Kannada Catholics constitute only 30% of the Catholic population in the Archdiocese. Konkani activists and associations have been demanding Konkani language mass and services for a long time. It is still the official language of the Mangalore Diocese.

===Multilingualism===
According to the Census Department of India, Konkani speakers show a very high degree of multilingualism. In the 1991 census, as compared to the national average of 19.44% for bilingualism and 7.26% for trilingualism, Konkani speakers scored 74.20% and 44.68% respectively. This makes the Konkans the most multilingual community of India.

This has been due to the fact that in most areas where Konkans have settled, they seldom form a majority of the population and have to interact with others in the local tongue. Another reason for bilingualism has been the lack of schools teaching Konkani as a primary or secondary language.

The bilingualism of Konkanis with Marathi in Daman Goa and Maharashtra has been a source of great discontent because it has led to the belief that Konkani is a dialect of Marathi and hence has no bearing on the future of Goa.

===Scripts and dialects===

The problems posed by multiple scripts and varying dialects have come as an impediment in the efforts to unite Konkani people. The Goa state&#x27;s decision to use Devanagari as the official script and the Antruz dialect has been met with opposition both within Goa and outside it. Critics contend that the Antruz dialect is unintelligible to most Goans, let alone other Konkani people outside Goa, and that Devanagari is used very little as compared to Romi Konkani in Goa or Konkani in the Kannada script. Prominent among the critics are Konkani Christians in Goa, who were at the forefront of the Konkani agitation in 1986–87 and have for a long time used the Roman script, including producing literature in Roman script. They demanded Roman script be given equal status to Devanagari.

In Karnataka, which has the largest number of Konkani speakers after Goa, leading organisations and activists have similarly demanded that Kannada script be made the medium of instruction for Konkani in local schools instead of Devanagari. The government of Karnataka has given its approval for teaching of Konkani as an optional third language from 6th to 10th standard students either in Kannada or Devanagari scripts.

===Outside India===
Emigration has also brought the Konkani language to foreign countries, such as Canada, the United Arab Emirates and Kenya.

==Phonology==

The Konkani language has 16 basic vowels (excluding an equal number of long vowels), 36 consonants, 5 semi-vowels, 3 sibilants, 1 aspirate, and many diphthongs. Like the other Indo-Aryan languages, it has both long and short vowels and syllables with long vowels may appear to be stressed. Different types of nasal vowels are a special feature of the Konkani language.
* The palatal and alveolar stops are affricates. The palatal glides are truly palatal but otherwise the consonants in the palatal column are alveopalatal.
* The voiced/voiceless contrasts are found only in the stops and affricates. The fricatives are all voiceless and the sonorants are all voiced.
* The initial vowel-syllable is shortened after the aspirates and fricatives. Many speakers substitute unaspirated consonants for aspirates.
* Aspirates in a non-initial position are rare and only occur in careful speech. Palatalisation/non-palatisation is found in all obstruents, except for palatal and alveolars. Where a palatalised alveolar is expected, a palatal is found instead. In the case of sonorants, only unaspirated consonants show this contrast, and among the glides only labeo-velar glides exhibit this. Vowels show a contrast between oral and nasal ones

===Vowels===

One of the most distinguishing features of Konkani phonology is the use of , the close-mid central vowel, instead of the schwa found in Hindustani and Marathi.

Whereas many Indian languages use only one of the three front vowels, represented by the Devanagari grapheme ए, Konkani uses three: , and .

Nasalizations exist for all vowels except for .

===Consonants===

The consonants in Konkani are similar to those in Marathi.

==Grammar==
Konkani grammar is similar to other Indo-Aryan languages. Notably, Konkani grammar is also influenced by Dravidian languages. It cannot be described as a stress-timed language, nor as a tonal language.
* Speech can be classified into any of the following parts:
# &quot;naam&quot; (noun)
# &quot;sarvanaam&quot; (pronoun)
# &quot;visheshan&quot; (adjective)
# &quot;kriyapad&quot; (verb)
# &quot;kriyavisheshana&quot; (adverb)
# &quot;ubhayanvayi avyaya&quot;
# &quot;shabdayogi avyaya&quot;
# &quot;kevalaprayogi avyaya&quot; (interjection)

Like most of the Indo-Aryan languages, Konkani is an SOV language, meaning among other things that not only is the verb found at the end of the clause but also modifiers and complements tend to precede the head and postpositions are far more common than prepositions. In terms of syntax, Konkani is a &quot;head-last&quot; language, unlike English, which is an SVO language.
* Almost all the verbs, adverbs, adjectives, and the &quot;avyaya&quot;s are either &quot;tatsama&quot; or &quot;tadbhava&quot;.

===Verbs===
Verbs are either &quot;tatsama&quot; or &quot;tadbhava&quot;:
*Present indefinite of the auxiliary is fused with present participle of the primary verb, and the auxiliary is partially dropped. When the southern dialects came in contact with Dravidian languages this difference became more prominent in dialects spoken in Karnataka whereas Goan Konkani still retains the original form.
For example, &quot;I eat&quot; and &quot;I am eating&quot; sound similar in Goan Konkani, due to loss of auxiliary in colloquial speech. &quot;Hāv khātā&quot; corresponds to &quot;I am eating&quot;. On the other hand, in Karnataka Konkani &quot;hāv khātā&quot; corresponds to &quot;I eat&quot;, and &quot;hāv khātoāsā&quot; or &quot;hāv khāter āsā&quot; means &quot;I am eating&quot;. However the word &quot;jito&quot; (living) is universal, &quot;to jitoāsā&quot; (he is living).
* Out of eight grammatical cases, Konkani has totally lost the dative, the locative, and the ablative. It has partially lost the accusative and the instrumental cases too. So the preserved cases are: the nominative, the genitive, and the vocative case.

===Apabhramsha and metathesis===
* Like Marathi and Gujarati, the Konkani language has three genders. During the Middle Ages, most of the Indo-Aryan languages lost their neuter gender, except Maharashtri, in which it is retained much more in Marathi than Konkani. Gender in Konkani is purely grammatical and unconnected to sex.

Metathesis is a characteristic of all the middle and modern Indo-Aryan languages including Konkani. Consider the Sanskrit word &quot;स्नुषा&quot; (daughter-in law). Here, the ष is dropped, and स्नु alone is utilised, स्नु--&gt;स/नु and you get the word सुन (metathesis of &quot;ukar&quot;).
* Unlike Sanskrit, &quot;anusvara&quot; has great importance in Konkani. A characteristic of Middle Indo-Aryan dialects, Konkani still retains the &quot;anusvara&quot; on the initial or final syllable. Similarly &quot;visarga&quot;, is totally lost and is assimilated with उ and/or ओ. For example, in Sanskrit दीपः becomes दिवो and दुःख becomes दुख.
* Konkani retains the pitch accent, which is a direct derivative of Vedic accent, which probably would account for &quot;nasalism&quot; in Konkani. The &quot;breathed&quot; accent is retained in most of the &quot;tatsama&quot;s than the &quot;tadbhava&quot;s. Declension also affects the accent.
* Konkani has lost its passive voice, and now the transitive verbs in their perfects are equivalent to passives.
* Konkani has rejected ऋ, ॠ, ऌ, ॡ, ष, and क्ष, which are assimilated with र, ख, ह, श and स. 
* Sanskrit compound letters are avoided in Konkani. For example, in Sanskrit द्वे, प्राय, गृहस्थ, उद्योत become बे, पिराय, गिरेस्त, and उज्जो respectively in Konkani.

==Vocabulary==
The vocabulary from Konkani comes from a number of sources. The main source is Prakrits. So Sanskrit as a whole has played a very important part in Konkani vocabulary. Konkani vocabulary is made of (Sanskrit loanwords without change), (evolved Sanskrit words), (indigenous words) and (foreign words). Other sources of vocabulary are Arabic, Persian, and Turkish. Finally, Kannada, Marathi, and Portuguese have enriched its lexical content.

===Loanwords===
Since Goa was a major trade centre for visiting Arabs and Turks, many Arabic and Persian words infiltrated the Konkani language. A large number of Arabic and Persian words now form an integral part of Konkani vocabulary and are commonly used in day-to-day life; examples are &quot;karz&quot; (debt), &quot;fakt&quot; (only), &quot;dusman&quot; (enemy), and &quot;barik&quot; (thin). Single and compound words are found wherein the original meaning has been changed or distorted. Examples include &quot;mustaiki&quot; (from Arabic &quot;mustaid&quot;, meaning &quot;ready&quot;), and &quot;kapan khairo&quot; (&quot;eater of one&#x27;s own shroud&quot;, meaning &quot;a miser&quot;).

Most of the old Konkani Hindu literature does not show any influence from Portuguese. Even the dialects spoken by the majority of Goan Hindus have a very limited Portuguese influence. On the other hand, dialects spoken by the Catholics from Goa (as well as the Canara to some extent) and their religious literature show a strong Portuguese influence. They contain a number of Portuguese lexical items, but these are almost all religious terms. Even in the context of religious terminology, the missionaries adapted native terms associated with Hindu religious concepts. (For example, &quot;krupa&quot; for grace, Y&quot;amakunda&quot; for hell, V&quot;aikuntha&quot; for paradise and so on). The syntax used by Goan Catholics in their literature shows a prominent Portuguese influence. As a result, many Portuguese loanwords are now commonly found in common Konkani speech.
The Portuguese influence is also evident in the Marathi–Konkani spoken in the former Northern Konkan district, Thane a variant of Konkani used by Bombay East Indians Catholic community.

===Sanskritisation===
Konkani is not highly Sanskritised like Marathi, but still retains Prakrit and apabhramsa structures, verbal forms, and vocabulary. Though the Goan Hindu dialect is highly Prakritised, numerous Sanskrit loanwords are found, while the Catholic dialect has historically drawn many terms from Portuguese. The Catholic literary dialect has now adopted Sanskritic vocabulary itself, and the Catholic Church has also adopted a Sanskritisation policy. Despite the relative unfamiliarity of the recently introduced Sanskritic vocabulary to the new Catholic generations, there has not been wide resistance to the change. On the other hand, southern Konkani dialects, having been influenced by Kannada − one of the languages of Dravidian origin − have undergone re-Sanskritisation over time.

==Writing systems==
Konkani has been compelled to become a language using a multiplicity of scripts, and not just one single script used everywhere. This has led to an outward splitting up of the same language, which is spoken and understood by all, despite some inevitable dialectal convergences.

===Past===

The Brahmi script for Konkani fell into disuse. Later, some inscriptions were written in old Nagari. However, owing to the Portuguese conquest in 1510 and the subsequent various restrictions imposed by the Inquisition, some early forms of Devanagari fell out of use in Goa. The Portuguese promulgated a law banning the use of non-Roman scripts for Konkani in Goa.

Another script, called &quot;Kandevi&quot; or &quot;Goykandi&quot;, was used for Konkani since the times of the Kadambas, although it lost its popularity after the 17th century. Kandevi/Goykandi is very different from the Halegannada script, with strikingly similar features. Unlike Halegannada, Kandevi/Goykandi letters were usually written with a distinctive horizontal bar, like the Nagari scripts. This script may have been evolved out of the Kadamba script, which was extensively used in Goa and Konkan. The earliest known inscription in Devanagari dates to 1187 AD. The Roman script has the oldest preserved and protected literary tradition, beginning from the 16th century.

===Present===
Konkani is written in five scripts: Devanagari, Roman, Kannada, Malayalam, and Perso-Arabic. Because Devanagari is the official script used to write Konkani in Goa and Maharashtra, most Konkanis (especially Hindus) in those two states write the language in Devanagari. However, Konkani is widely written in the Roman script (called Romi Konkani) by many Konkanis, (especially Catholics). This is because for many years, all Konkani literature was in the Latin script, and Catholic liturgy and other religious literature has always been in the Roman script. Most people of Karnataka use the Kannada script; however, the Saraswats of Karnataka use the Devanagari script in the uttara Kannada district. Malayalam script was used by the Konkani community in Kerala, but there has been a move towards the usage of the Devanagari script in recent years. Konkani Muslims use Arabic script to write Konkani. There has been to trend towards the usage of the Arabic script among Muslim communities; this coincides with them mixing more Urdu and Arabic words into their Konkani dialects. When the Sahitya Akademi recognised Konkani in 1975 as an independent and literary language, one of the important factors was the literary heritage of Romi Konkani since the year 1556. However, after Konkani in the Devanagari script was made the official language of Goa in 1987, the Sahitya Akademi has supported only writers in the Devanagari script. For a very long time there has been a rising demand for official recognition of Romi Konkani by Catholics in Goa because a sizeable population of the people in Goa use the Roman script. Also a lot of the content on the Internet and the staging of the famed Tiatr is written in Romi Konkani. In January 2013, the Goa Bench of the Bombay High Court issued a notice to the state government on a Public Interest Litigation filed by the Romi Lipi Action Front seeking to amend the Official Language Act to grant official language status to Romi Konkani but has not yet been granted.

====Alphabet/&quot;vaṇamāḷha&quot;====
The vowels, consonants, and their arrangement are as follows:


==Dialects==
Konkani, despite having a small population, shows a very high number of dialects. The dialect tree structure of Konkani can easily be classified according to the region, religion, caste, and local tongue influence.

Based on the historical events and cultural ties of the speakers, N. G. Kalelkar has broadly classified the dialects into three main groups:
* Northern Konkani: Dialects spoken in the Sindhudurga district of Maharashtra with strong cultural ties to Marathi; i.e. Malvani
* Central Konkani: Dialects in Goa and Northern Karnataka, where Konkani came in close contact with Portuguese language and culture.
* Southern Konkani: Dialects spoken in the South Canara region (Mangalore, Udupi) of Karnataka and Kasaragod of Kerala, which came in close contact with Tulu. Southern Konkani has absorbed lot of loanwords and elements from kannada along with few loanwords from Tulu, in some case with slight differences in pronunciation.

===Goan Konkani===
Goan Konkani refers to all the central dialects of the Konkani macrolanguage except for those that fall under Maharashtri Konkani. These dialects are collectively assigned the language code under the ISO 639-3 classification (since it is sometimes called &quot;Goan Marathi&quot;).

In common usage, Goan Konkani refers collectively only to those dialects of Konkani spoken primarily in the state of Goa, for eg. The Antruz, Bardeskari &amp; Saxtti dialects. But in the broader linguistic context, Goan Konkani also includes dialects spoken outside the official boundaries of Goa, such as Malvani Konkani, Chitpavani Konkani, Karwari Konkani, Mangalorean Konkani etc.

==Organisations==
There are organisations working for Konkani but, primarily, these were restricted to individual communities. The All India Konkani Parishad founded on 8 July 1939, provided a common ground for Konkani people from all regions. A new organisation known as Vishwa Konkani Parishad, which aims to be an all-inclusive and pluralistic umbrella organisation for Konkanis around the world, was founded on 11 September 2005.

Mandd Sobhann is the premier organisation that is striving hard to preserve, promote, propagate, and enrich the Konkani language and culture. It all began with the experiment called &#x27;Mandd Sobhann&#x27; – a search for a Konkani identity in Konkani music on 30 November 1986 at Mangalore. What began as a performance titled &#x27;Mandd Sobhann&#x27;, grew into a movement of revival and rejuvenation of Konkani culture; and solidified into an organization called Mandd Sobhann. Today, Mandd Sobhann boasts of all these 3 identities namely - a performance, a movement and an organization.https://www.manddsobhann.org/

The Konkan Daiz Yatra, started in 1939 in Mumbai, is the oldest Konkani organisation. The Konkani Bhasha Mandal was born in Mumbai on 5 April 1942, during the Third Adhiveshan of All India Konkani Parishad. On 28 December 1984, Goa Konkani Akademi (GKA) was founded by the government of Goa to promote Konkani language, literature, and culture. The Thomas Stephens Konknni Kendr (TSKK) is a popular research institute based in the Goan capital Panaji. It works on issues related to the Konkani language, literature, culture, and education. The Dalgado Konkani Academy is a popular Konkani organisation based in Panaji.
The Konkani Triveni Kala Sangam is one more famed Konkani organisation in Mumbai, which is engaged in the vocation of patronising Konkani language through the theatre movement. The government of Karnataka established the Karnataka Konkani Sahitya Akademy on 20 April 1994. The Konkani Ekvott is an umbrella organisation of the Konkani bodies in Goa.

The First World Konkani Convention was held in Mangalore in December 1995. The Konkani Language and Cultural Foundation came into being immediately after the World Konkani Convention in 1995.

The World Konkani Centre built on a three-acre plot called Konkani Gaon (Konkani Village) at Shakti Nagar, Mangalore was inaugurated on 17 January 2009, &quot;to serve as a nodal agency for the preservation and overall development of Konkani language, art, and culture involving all the Konkani people the world over.&quot;

The North American Konkani Association (NAKA) serves to unite Konkanis across the United States and Canada. It serves as a parent organization for smaller Konkani associations in various states. Furthermore, the Konkani Young Adult Group serves as a platform under NAKA to allow young adults across America (18+) of Konkani descent to meet each other and celebrate their heritage. Every 2–4 years, a Konkani Sammelan, where Konkanis from across the continent attend, is held in a different city in the US. A Konkani Youth Convention is held yearly. Past locations have included NYC and Atlanta; the upcoming youth convention is slated to be held in Chicago, IL in June.

==Literature==

During the Goa Inquisition which commenced in 1560, all books found in the Konkani language were burnt, and it is possible that old Konkani literature was destroyed as a consequence.

The earliest writer in the history of Konkani language known today is Krishnadas Shama from Quelossim in Goa. He began writing 25 April 1526, and he authored &quot;Ramayana&quot;, &quot;Mahabharata&quot;, and &quot;Krishnacharitrakatha&quot; in prose style. The manuscripts have not been found, although transliterations in Roman script are found in Braga in Portugal. The script used by him for his work is not known.

The first known printed book in Konkani was written by an English Jesuit priest, Fr. Thomas Stephens in 1622, and entitled &quot;Doutrina Christam em Lingoa Bramana Canarim&quot; (Old Portuguese for: &quot;Christian Doctrine in the Canarese Brahman Language&quot;). The first book exclusively on Konkani grammar, &quot;Arte da Lingoa Canarim&quot;, was printed in 1640 by Father Stephens in Portuguese.

It is dedicated to the spreading of the devotion to the Sacred Heart of Jesus, and was initially named Dor Muineachi Rotti Povitra Jesucha Calzachem Devoçãõ Vaddounchi. Note that the til (tilde mark) over ãõ in Devoçãõ is one single til. Fr. Vincent Lobo, from Sangolda in Goa, who was then curator at the St. Patrick&#x27;s Church in Karachi, began it in 1915, to feed the spiritual thirst and hunger of the large number of Konkani speaking people there, on noticing the absence of Konkani spiritual literature. The name was changed subsequently to &quot;Dor Muiniachi Rotti, Concanim Messenger of the Sacred Heart&quot;. On Fr. Vincent Lobo&#x27;s passing away on 11 November 1922, Fr. António Ludovico Pereira, also from Sangolda, took over the responsibility. Dor Mhoineachi Rotti had an estimated readership of around 12,000 people then. After the passing away of Fr. António Ludovico Pereira on 26 July 1936, Fr. Antanasio Moniz, from Verna, took over. On his passing away in 1953, Fr. Elias D&#x27;Souza, from Bodiem, Tivim in Goa became the fourth editor of Dor Mhoineachi Rotti. After shifting to Velha Goa in Goa around 1964, Fr. Moreno de Souza was editor for around 42 years. Presently the Dor Mhuineachi Rotti is owned by the Jesuits in Goa, edited by Fr. Vasco do Rego, S. J. and printed and published by Fr.

==In popular culture==
Many Konkani songs of the Goan fisher-folk appear recurrently in a number of Hindi films. Many Hindi movies feature characters with a Goan Catholic accent. A famous song from the 1957 movie &quot;Aasha&quot;, contains the Konkani words &quot;mhaka naka&quot; and became extremely popular. Children were chanting &quot;Eeny, meeny, miny, moe&quot;, which inspired C Ramchandra and his assistant John Gomes to create the first line of the song, &quot;Eena Meena Deeka, De Dai Damanika&quot;. Gomes, who was a Goan, added the words &quot;mhaka naka&quot; (Konkani for &quot;I don&#x27;t want&quot;). They kept on adding more nonsense rhymes until they ended with &quot;Rum pum po!&quot;.

An international ad campaign by Nike for the 2007 Cricket World Cup featured a Konkani song &quot;Rav Patrao Rav&quot; as the background theme. It was based on the tune of an older song &quot;Bebdo&quot;, composed by Chris Perry and sung by Lorna Cordeiro.

<text>The 1984–85 network television schedule for the three major English language commercial broadcast networks in the United States covers primetime hours from September 1984 through August 1985. The schedule is followed by a list per network of returning series, new series, and series cancelled after the 1983–84 season.

PBS, the Public Broadcasting Service, was in operation but the schedule was set by each local station.

Each of the 30 highest-rated shows released in May 1985 is listed with its rank and rating as determined by Nielsen Media Research.

New series are highlighted in bold.

Repeat airings or same-day rebroadcasts are indicated by .

All times are U.S. Eastern and Pacific Time (except for some live sports or events). Subtract one hour for Central, Mountain, Alaska and Hawaii–Aleutian times.

==Legend==
==Sunday==
Note: Beginning December 16, ABC″s Sunday schedule between 8:00 p.m. and 11:00 p.m. varied, consisting of three-hour broadcasts of &quot;The ABC Sunday Night Movie&quot;, two-hour broadcasts of &quot;The ABC Sunday Night Movie&quot; starting at 8:00 p.m. with specials airing at 10:00 p.m., specials airing at 8:00 p.m. followed by a two-hour broadcast of &quot;The ABC Sunday Night Movie&quot; starting at 9:00 p.m., or miniseries or sports programming during the entire three-hour block.

<text>The Parti républicain du Québec (, PRQ; ) was a political party that advocated the independence of Quebec from Canada. The PRQ was founded in November 1962 by Marcel Chaput, who was also one of the founders of the Rassemblement pour l&#x27;indépendance nationale in 1960.

At the time, the RIN was not a political party, only a political movement, and the executive had refused to run candidates in elections. Chaput believed that independentist movement should run candidates in general elections. He had run in the 1962 Quebec election as an unaffiliated candidate. Shortly after the election, he founded the PRQ. Quickly, the party was plagued by financial problems, and it never achieved the goal of gathering all the sovereigntist forces. The Parti républicain du Québec folded in 1964 without contesting a single election. The same year, the Rassemblement pour l&#x27;indépendance nationale decided to become a political party.

<text>The 1991 Atlantic hurricane season was the first season since 1984 in which no hurricanes developed from tropical waves, which are the source for most North Atlantic tropical cyclones. The hurricane season officially began on June 1, and ended on November 30. It was the least active in four years due to higher than usual wind shear across the Atlantic Ocean. The first storm, Ana, developed on July 2 off the southeast United States and dissipated without causing significant effects. Two other tropical storms in the season – Danny and Erika – did not significantly affect land. Danny dissipated east of the Lesser Antilles, and Erika passed through the Azores before becoming extratropical. In addition, there were four non-developing tropical depressions. The second depression of the season struck Mexico with significant accompanying rains.

The most significant storm of the season was Hurricane Bob, which at the time was among the ten costliest United States hurricanes. After brushing the Outer Banks of North Carolina and Long Island in New York, the hurricane made landfall on Rhode Island. It caused $1.5 billion in damage (1991 USD), mostly in Massachusetts, and 17 fatalities. The strongest hurricane of the season was Claudette, which reached peak winds of near Bermuda. It passed near the island but did not cause any damage. Fabian was the only tropical storm to move over or near Cuba or Florida, producing heavy rainfall but no damage. Hurricane Grace, the final named storm of the season, provided the energy that led to the development of a powerful nor&#x27;easter known as the Perfect Storm. Originating from an extratropical storm, the Perfect Storm intensified while moving westward toward New England, leaving $200 million in damage and causing coastal damage from Puerto Rico to Florida and northward through Canada. It later transitioned into a hurricane over the Gulf Stream, finally dissipating over Nova Scotia on November 2.

==Seasonal forecasts==
Before the start of the season, hurricane expert William M. Gray released his forecast for the year&#x27;s activity, a yearly practice that he began in 1984. In early April, Gray anticipated a &quot;mild&quot; season with fewer than ten tropical storms, of which less than six would become hurricanes. Later that month, the Weather Research Center forecast ten named storms and six hurricanes, of which five would become major hurricanes while three would hit the United States. In early June, Gray released an updated report that predicted the formation of eight tropical storms, four hurricanes, and one major hurricane. The revised June total was very close to the actual season activity, with the exception of forecasting one fewer major hurricane. However, a later revision in August incorrectly anticipated less activity, when Gray predicted seven storms and three hurricanes.
==Seasonal summary==
&quot;For a chronological guide, see Timeline of the 1991 Atlantic hurricane season&quot;

Overall activity in 1991 was below normal. This was partially due to decreased tropical cyclogenesis from African tropical waves, which are troughs that move across the ocean with associated convection. In most seasons, the majority of storms develop from tropical waves. Of the season&#x27;s twelve tropical cyclones, only five originated from tropical waves; in addition, only three of the eight tropical storms were from tropical waves, and none had the characteristics of a Cape Verde-type hurricane. From late April to late November, there were 73 tropical waves that exited the west coast of Africa. The total was higher than average, although many of them were poorly defined and had little thunderstorm activity. The waves traversed the Atlantic Ocean further south than normal, typically not becoming convectively active until moving across northern South America. Cyclogenesis was also suppressed by higher than normal wind shear, as well as low rainfall amounts across the Sahel. There were also no tropical storms in the Gulf of Mexico for only the third time in the 20th century, after 1927 and 1962. The season produced twelve tropical depressions, which was the lowest in five years. The eight tropical storms was the lowest amount in four years. Four of the storms developed into hurricanes, although for the first time in over 24 years, none of the hurricanes originated from tropical waves.

The season&#x27;s activity was reflected with a low cumulative accumulated cyclone energy (ACE) rating of 36. ACE is, broadly speaking, a measure of the power of the hurricane multiplied by the length of time it existed, so storms that last a long time, as well as particularly strong hurricanes, have high ACEs. ACE is only calculated for full advisories on tropical systems at or exceeding or tropical storm strength. Although officially, subtropical cyclones are excluded from the total, the figure above includes periods when storms were in a subtropical phase.

== Systems ==
=== Tropical Storm Ana ===

The first storm of the season was Ana, which originated from a cold-core low that persisted east of Jacksonville, Florida, by June 25. The system moved in a clockwise motion around an anticyclone located over Florida. The cold-core low gradually developed to the surface, and on June 29, a low pressure area formed within a surface trough over the Bahamas. It moved westward across southern Florida, dropping heavy rainfall along its path. Punta Gorda recorded a statewide peak of of precipitation. The low moved northwestward and later curved northeastward, exiting into the Atlantic Ocean near Saint Augustine by early on July 2. Although it was initially disorganized as it moved offshore, the convection quickly developed in organization, and by 1800 UTC that day it had developed into Tropical Depression One about south of Charleston, South Carolina.

As the depression moved northeastward parallel to the southeast United States coastline, it dropped light rainfall, although portions of Virginia recorded more than . Late on July 3, a buoy reported sustained winds of over a period of eight and a half minutes. As a result, the National Hurricane Center upgraded the depression to Tropical Storm Ana. The storm accelerated east-northeastward toward a stalled frontal zone, entering an area of increased wind shear. Despite these hostile conditions, Ana strengthened slightly, reaching peak winds of . Moving over cooler waters and interacting with the frontal zone, the circulation became broad as the thunderstorms diminished. On July 5, Ana became extratropical in the northern Atlantic Ocean about to the south of Cape Race.
=== Tropical Depression Two ===

A tropical wave emerged off the coast of Africa on June 20, and no significant development occurred until it became Tropical Depression Two in the western Gulf of Mexico on July 5. On its first advisory, a tropical storm watch was issued for from Baffin Bay, Texas, southward to Tampico, Tamaulipas. Nearing the coast of Mexico, the depression attained its peak intensity with winds of and a minimum pressure of . Failing to intensify further, Tropical Depression Two made landfall near La Pesca, Tamaulipas, on July 6. The National Hurricane Center issued the final advisory on July 7, although the circulation persisted until July 9 southwest of Texas. The depression had only minor impacts in Mexico and Texas, other than rainfall. Precipitation was heaviest in the state of San Luis Potosí, where the rainfall peaked at in Tamazunchale.
=== Hurricane Bob ===
Hurricane Bob originated from a decaying cold front, developing into a tropical depression early on August 16 near the Bahamas. It produced an area of organized convection, and the depression intensified into Tropical Storm Bob roughly 18 hours after forming. It gradually organized over the Gulf Stream, and based on reports from the Hurricane Hunters, Bob attained hurricane status on August 17. Shortly thereafter, the hurricane began to turn towards the north-northeast in response to a subtropical ridge over the Atlantic and the trough over the southeastern United States. After further intensification off the Carolinas, Bob reached peak winds of to the east of Virginia on August 19, making it a major hurricane. Significantly cooler sea surface temperatures resulted in weakening. After brushing Long Island, the center of Bob moved over Block Island, Rhode Island. About 40 minutes later it struck Newport, Rhode Island, with winds of , making it a Category 2 hurricane. It rapidly weakened to tropical storm intensity while moving through the remainder of New England, hitting Rockport, Maine, early on August 20. After crossing New Brunswick, Bob became extratropical in the Gulf of St. Lawrence and lasted another nine days before dissipating west of Portugal.

The hurricane first affected the Carolinas, spawning four confirmed and nine unconfirmed tornadoes in North Carolina. One person each died in North and South Carolina, and about 10% of houses in the Outer Banks sustained minor roof damage. As the storm moved up the coast, heavy rain fell on the western side of the center. High winds left 300,000 people without power on Long Island. In neighboring Connecticut, strong winds downed trees across the region, with damage heaviest in the southeastern portion near the coast. Damage was heaviest as Bob made its final landfall, with wind gusts of reported on Block Island, Rhode Island. The hurricane produced extensive beach erosion which destroyed coastal roads in the state. Monetary damage was greatest in Massachusetts, and along Bob&#x27;s path through southeastern New England more than 60% of people were left without power. High tides and strong winds destroyed boats and houses along the Massachusetts coastline. The heaviest rainfall from the hurricane fell at the Portland International Jetport in Maine, where fell during its passage. Across the United States, damage totaled $1.5 billion (1991 USD), including over $1 billion in Massachusetts. The high damage total made Bob among the ten costliest U.S. hurricanes at the time. In addition, there were 15 fatalities in the country. In Canada, high waves killed two people. In Fredericton, New Brunswick, tropical storm-force winds downed trees and power lines.
=== Tropical Depression Four ===

One of the few vigorous tropical waves of the season emerged from the western coast of Africa with a large area of convection in late August. On August 24 it developed into a tropical depression near Cape Verde. Upon first forming, the depression had a circular area of convection near the center. It was initially well-organized, but the depression was not expected to intensify due to marginal water temperatures; tropical cyclones generally require warm waters to develop. By August 25, the system lost much of its deep convection, and on August 26 the depression dissipated to the west-southwest of the Cape Verde islands.
=== Tropical Depression Five ===

Around the same time as the previous system dissipated, another tropical wave moved off the coast of Africa on August 26. On August 28 it formed into a tropical depression about southwest of Cape Verde. Upon developing, the depression had a small area of convection with a spiral rainband, and the NHC anticipated slow strengthening to tropical storm status. With a ridge to the north, the depression maintained a general westward track. Ultimately, the depression failed to organize significantly. By August 29, it had a broad and poorly organized circulation with only scattered convection. Due to cool water temperatures, the system was unable to maintain deep convection, and on August 31 the depression degenerated into a tropical wave about east of the Lesser Antilles.

=== Hurricane Claudette ===

The origins of Claudette were non-tropical, developing on September 4 about southeast of Bermuda from an upper-level disturbance. Following its formation, it developed slowly while moving southwestward, and on September 5 it intensified into Tropical Storm Claudette. Conditions were favorable for development, with low wind shear and a large anticyclone providing outflow, or the outward wind flow from a storm. On September 6 at 0600 UTC, Claudette attained hurricane status. It underwent rapid intensification, and early on September 7 a reconnaissance flight reported that Claudette attained major hurricane status with winds of . Based on satellite estimates, Hurricane Claudette attained its peak intensity with winds of and a minimum pressure .

After peaking, Claudette began steady weakening. Around that time, a hurricane watch was issued for the island of Bermuda, which was later upgraded to a warning. The hurricane turned to the northwest, passing east of Bermuda as a Category 1 hurricane on September 8. Winds on the island peaked at , with gusts to , and waves reached up to in height. By September 10, Claudette weakened to tropical storm status as it accelerated eastward. The next day it deteriorated further to tropical depression status, and the next day Claudette became extratropical to the southwest of the Azores. It persisted two more days until dissipating over the Azores.
=== Tropical Storm Danny ===

One of the most vigorous tropical waves of the season (which also led to the formation of Hurricane Jimena in the eastern Pacific) was first observed in western Africa on September 2. Three days later it emerged from the coast at Dakar, moving into the tropical Atlantic Ocean with rainbands around its convection. By early on September 7, the system organized into Tropical Depression Seven about south-southwest of Cape Verde. Upon developing, the depression had a broad circulation, located in an environment generally favorable for intensification. With a strong ridge to the north, the depression tracked steadily westward. After remaining a tropical depression for about 36 hours, the system became better organized and developed well-defined banding features. Based on satellite intensity estimates, the NHC upgraded it to Tropical Storm Danny on September 8.

Upon becoming a tropical storm, only slow strengthening was forecast, due to the presence of an upper-level trough to its west. The storm ultimately reached peak winds of , which it maintained for about 36 hours. On September 10 it attained its organizational maximum after developing a central dense overcast. Later that day, an upper-level low increased wind shear over the storm, which exposed the circulation from the deep convection. As Danny approached the Lesser Antilles, it weakened to tropical depression status on September 11. Later that day, a Hurricane Hunters flight was unable to locate a closed circulation, which indicated that Danny degenerated into a tropical wave about east of the Lesser Antilles. The remnants tracked to the northwest and later to the north before being absorbed by a frontal system.
=== Tropical Storm Erika ===

The origins of Tropical Storm Erika were from a tropical wave that exited the coast of Africa on September 2. It moved northwestward, passing through Cape Verde the following day. The system had most of the thunderstorms along the southern portion of the wave as it maintained a very large low-level circulation. Thunderstorms began developing on September 7, and the system organized into Tropical Depression Eight the following day about northeast of the Lesser Antilles; at the same time, it was located about midway between Hurricane Claudette and Tropical Storm Danny. Initially the center was difficult to locate on satellite imagery, but despite the proximity with Claudette, conditions were generally favorable for intensification. By late on September 9, the depression had become much better organized, and based on satellite estimates the NHC upgraded it to Tropical Storm Erika.

Upon becoming a tropical storm, Erika began a motion to the northeast. There was initial uncertainty whether Erika or nearby Claudette would become the dominant system through their interaction. On September 10, the storm developed a central dense overcast as it attained its peak winds of . It accelerated east-northeastward toward the Azores along the northern periphery of a ridge, briefly interacting with Claudette. By September 11, the convection had diminished, leaving the center exposed as Erika underwent extratropical transition. Shortly thereafter it passed through the Azores, striking São Miguel Island. Nearby Santa Maria Island reported tropical storm force winds with gusts to , prompting the closure of the airfield for several hours. On September 12, Erika weakened to a tropical depression before completing the transition into an extratropical cyclone. It dissipated later that day.
=== Tropical Storm Fabian ===

The origins of Fabian were from a tropical wave and a cold front that entered the northwestern Caribbean Sea on October 12, which produced an area of thunderstorms in the Gulf of Honduras. At 1300 UTC on October 15, a Hurricane Hunters flight observed sustained winds of to the southwest of the Isle of Youth. Based on the report, the NHC designated the system as Tropical Storm Fabian. although the NHC later assessed that the system developed as a tropical depression earlier that day. With a high pressure area to the north, there was already a large pressure gradient that had produced tropical storm force winds over the area. Initially the storm was disorganized, with its strongest winds located primarily east of the center. An eastward-moving upper-level trough imparted a northeast motion as well as unfavorable wind shear. After reaching peak winds of , Fabian crossed the Isle of Youth before crossing western Cuba. By early on October 16, the center was becoming difficult to locate as Fabian moved through the Florida Straits. The storm later moved through the Bahamas and became extratropical as it interacted with an approaching front.

When Fabian first formed, the government of Cuba issued a tropical storm warning from Havana to Ciego de Ávila Province, as well as the Isle of Youth. There was also a tropical storm watch for the Florida Keys, as well as a tropical storm warning for the Bahamas. Before the storm hit the Cuban mainland, it produced wind gusts to in Cayo Largo del Sur. Its primary form of impact was from heavy rainfall in a 24‑hour period, peaking at in Caonao on the south coast of Cuba. In a six-hour period, Punta del Este recorded . Prior to the storm&#x27;s passage, two state parks were closed in the Florida Keys, and a few storm shelters were opened in Dade County. As it passed east of the state, it dropped rainfall near the coast that peaked at in Conch Key. In the Florida Keys, the National Weather Service Office in Key West recorded sustained winds of with gusts to . Only isolated flooding happened from the precursor system to Fabian. In South Florida, Homestead Air Force Base reported rainfall of , but this too was attributed to the precursor frontal system, rather than Fabian itself.
=== Tropical Depression Ten ===

A tropical wave moved off the coast of Africa on October 19. Moving westward, it developed a weak circulation on October 23. Despite the presence of strong shear, the system was upgraded to a tropical depression at 2200 UTC on October 24 about east of the Lesser Antilles. This was based on a rating of 1.5 on the Dvorak technique, which is a method of estimating the intensity of tropical cyclones via satellite. At the time of development, the depression had a small area of convection near and east of the center, and due to the wind shear it was never expected to intensify. By October 25, the circulation had become dissociated from the convection. The depression dissipated soon after without affecting land.

=== Hurricane Grace ===
On October 23 a mid-level low formed south of Bermuda. By two days later it had become a surface low, and on October 26 it developed into a subtropical storm. The system was labeled as such due to the initial lack of deep convection over the center, although following an increase in thunderstorms the NHC reclassified it as Tropical Storm Grace late on October 27. By that time, the storm had executed a path generally to the northwest. Grace continued to intensify and organize, and based on Hurricane Hunter reports the storm was upgraded to a hurricane early on October 28. Shortly thereafter, Grace turned sharply to the east due to the influence of a rapidly intensifying extratropical cyclone off the New England coast. An eye developed in the center of Grace, despite shallow convection.

As the hurricane accelerated eastward, it attained a peak intensity of on October 29. The rapid motion caused an asymmetry in the wind field, and the center passed approximately south of Bermuda without significantly affecting the island. A rapidly approaching cold front absorbed Grace on October 29, contributing moisture to the developing extratropical storm that was eventually known as the Perfect Storm. As a tropical cyclone, Grace produced squally conditions across Bermuda, but no damage was reported. The hurricane generated large swells along the East Coast of the United States, causing minor beach erosion.
=== Unnamed hurricane ===

The precursor of the season&#x27;s final storm was a strong extratropical cyclone commonly known as the &quot;Perfect Storm&quot;. It evolved from an area of low pressure that developed off Atlantic Canada on October 28. The system moved southward and westward due to a ridge to its north, and reached its peak intensity. The storm lashed the East Coast of the United States with high waves and coastal flooding, before turning to the southwest and weakening. Moving over warmer waters, the system transitioned into a subtropical cyclone before becoming a tropical storm. It executed a loop off the Mid-Atlantic states and turned toward the northeast. On November 1 the system evolved into a full-fledged hurricane with peak winds of . The tropical system weakened, striking Nova Scotia as a tropical storm before dissipating.

Damage totaled over $200 million (1991 USD) and the death toll was thirteen. Most of the damage occurred while the storm was extratropical, after waves up to struck the coastline from Canada to Florida and southeastward to Puerto Rico. In Massachusetts, where damage was heaviest, over 100 homes were destroyed or severely damaged. To the north, more than 100 homes were affected in Maine, including the vacation home of George H. W. Bush, the president at the time. More than 38,000 people were left without power, and along the coast high waves inundated roads and buildings. In portions of New England, damage was worse than had occurred from Hurricane Bob two months prior. However, aside from tidal flooding along rivers, the storm&#x27;s effects were primarily along the coastline. A buoy off the coast of Nova Scotia reported a wave height of , the highest ever recorded in the province&#x27;s offshore waters. In the middle of the storm, the &quot;Andrea Gail&quot; sunk, claiming the lives of its crew of six, which later inspired the book as well as the movie &quot;The Perfect Storm&quot;. Off the coast of New York, a Coast Guard helicopter ran out of fuel and crashed, and although four members of its crew were rescued, one was killed. Two people died after their boat sank off Staten Island. High waves swept a person to their death in both Rhode Island and Puerto Rico, and another person was blown off a bridge in New York. The tropical cyclone that formed late in the storm&#x27;s duration caused little impact, limited to power outages and slick roads; one person was killed in Newfoundland from a traffic accident related to the storm.
== Storm names ==

The following list of names was used for named storms that formed in the North Atlantic in 1991. This is the same list used for the 1985 season, with the exception of the names &quot;Erika&quot; and &quot;Grace&quot;, which replaced the names &quot;Elena&quot; and &quot;Gloria&quot; after that season. Both &quot;Erika&quot; and &quot;Grace&quot; were used for the first time in 1991.


=== Retirement ===

The World Meteorological Organization retired the name &quot;Bob&quot; from the Atlantic hurricane name lists following the 1991 season due to its high impact. The name was replaced with &quot;Bill&quot; for the 1997 season.

== Season effects ==
This is a table of all of the storms that formed in the 1991 Atlantic hurricane season. It includes their name, duration, peak classification and intensities, areas affected, damage, and death totals. Deaths in parentheses are additional and indirect (an example of an indirect death would be a traffic accident), but were still related to that storm.

<text>In psychology and behavioral economics, the endowment effect, also known as divestiture aversion, is the finding that people are more likely to retain an object they own than acquire that same object when they do not own it. The endowment theory can be defined as &quot;an application of prospect theory positing that loss aversion associated with ownership explains observed exchange asymmetries.&quot;

This is typically illustrated in two ways. In a valuation paradigm, people&#x27;s maximum willingness to pay (WTP) to acquire an object is typically lower than the least amount they are willing to accept (WTA) to give up that same object when they own it—even when there is no cause for attachment, or even if the item was only obtained minutes ago. In an exchange paradigm, people given a good are reluctant to trade it for another good of similar value. For example, participants first given a pen of equal expected value to that of a coffee mug were generally unwilling to trade, whilst participants first given the coffee mug were also unwilling to trade it for the pen.

A more controversial third paradigm used to elicit the endowment effect is the mere ownership paradigm, primarily used in experiments in psychology, marketing, and organizational behavior. In this paradigm, people who are randomly assigned to receive a good (&quot;owners&quot;) evaluate it more positively than people who are not randomly assigned to receive the good (&quot;controls&quot;). The distinction between this paradigm and the first two is that it is not incentive-compatible. In other words, participants are not explicitly incentivized to reveal the extent to which they truly like or value the good.

The endowment effect can be equated to the behavioural model willingness to accept or pay (WTAP), a formula sometimes used to find out how much a consumer or person is willing to put up with or lose for different outcomes. However, this model has come under recent criticism as potentially inaccurate.

==Examples==
One of the most famous examples of the endowment effect in the literature is from a study by Daniel Kahneman, Jack Knetsch &amp; Richard Thaler, in which Cornell University undergraduates were given a mug and then offered the chance to sell it or trade it for an equally valued alternative (pens). They found that the amount participants required as compensation for the mug once their ownership of the mug had been established (&quot;willingness to accept&quot;) was approximately twice as high as the amount they were willing to pay to acquire the mug (&quot;willingness to pay&quot;).

Other examples of the endowment effect include work by Ziv Carmon and Dan Ariely, who found that participants&#x27; hypothetical selling price (willingness to accept or WTA) for NCAA final four tournament tickets were 14 times higher than their hypothetical buying price (willingness to pay or WTP). Also, work by Hossain and List (Working Paper) discussed in the Economist in 2010, showed that workers worked harder to maintain ownership of a provisionally awarded bonus than they did for a bonus framed as a potential yet-to-be-awarded gain. In addition to these examples, the endowment effect has been observed using different goods in a wide range of different populations, including children, great apes, and new world monkeys.

==Background==
The endowment effect has been observed from ancient times:

Psychologists first noted the difference between consumers&#x27; WTP and WTA as early as the 1960s. The term &quot;endowment effect&quot; however was first explicitly coined in 1980 by the economist Richard Thaler in reference to the under-weighting of opportunity costs as well as the inertia introduced into a consumer&#x27;s choice processes when goods included in their endowment become more highly valued than goods that are not.

At the time Thaler&#x27;s conceptualisation of the endowment effect was in direct contrast to that of accepted economic theory, which assumed humans were completely rational when making decisions. Through his contrasting viewpoint, Thaler was able to offer a clearer understanding of how humans make economic decisions. In the years that followed, extensive investigations into the endowment effect have been conducted producing a wealth of interesting empirical and theoretical findings.

==Theoretical explanations==

===Loss aversion===
The leading explanation for the aforementioned WTP-WTA gap is that of loss aversion. It was first linked by Kahneman and his colleagues that selling an endowment means the loss of the object, and as humans are aligned to be more loss-averse, less utility is obtained from acquirement of the same endowment. They go on to suggest that the endowment effect, when considered as a facet of loss-aversion, would thus violate the Coase theorem, and was described as inconsistent with standard economic theory which asserts that a person&#x27;s willingness to pay (WTP) for a good should be equal to their willingness to accept (WTA) compensation to be deprived of the good, a hypothesis which underlies consumer theory and indifference curves. Another aspect of loss aversion exhibited within the endowment effect is that opportunity costs are often undervalued. The overcharging of the selling item stems from the fixation of losing the item rather than the unattained gain if the sale falls through.

The correlation between the two theories is so high that the endowment effect is often seen as the presentation of loss aversion in a riskless setting. However, these claims have been disputed and other researchers claim that psychological inertia, differences in reference prices relied on by buyers and sellers, and ownership (attribution of the item to self) and not loss aversion are the key to this phenomenon.

===Psychological inertia===
David Gal proposed a psychological inertia account of the endowment effect. In this account, sellers require a higher price to part with an object than buyers are willing to pay because neither has a well-defined, precise valuation for the object and therefore there is a range of prices over which neither buyers nor sellers have much incentive to trade. For example, in the case of Kahneman et al.&#x27;s (1990) classic mug experiments (where sellers demanded about $7 to part with their mug whereas buyers were only willing to pay, on average, about $3 to acquire a mug) there was likely a range of prices for the mug ($4 to $6) that left the buyers and sellers without much incentive to either acquire or part with it. Buyers and sellers therefore maintained the status quo out of inertia. Conversely, a high price ($7 or more) yielded a meaningful incentive for an owner to part with the mug; likewise, a relatively low price ($3 or less) yielded a meaningful incentive for a buyer to acquire the mug.

===Reference-dependent accounts===
According to reference-dependent theories, consumers first evaluate the potential change in question as either being a gain or a loss. In line with prospect theory (Tversky and Kahneman, 1979), changes that are framed as losses are weighed more heavily than are the changes framed as gains. Thus an individual owning &quot;A&quot; amount of a good, asked how much he/she would be willing to pay to acquire &quot;B&quot;, would be willing to pay a value (B-A) that is lower than the value that he/she would be willing to accept to sell (C-A) units; the value function for perceived gains is not as steep as the value function for perceived losses.

Figure 1 presents this explanation in graphical form. An individual at point A, asked how much he/she would be willing to accept (WTA) as compensation to sell X units and move to point C, would demand greater compensation for that loss than he/she would be willing to pay for an equivalent gain of X units to move him/her to point B. Thus the difference between (B-A) and (C-A) would account for the endowment effect. In other words, he/she expects more money while selling; but wants to pay less while buying the same amount of goods.

===Neoclassical explanations===
Hanemann (1991), develops a neoclassical explanation for the endowment effect, accounting for the effect without invoking prospect theory.

Figure 2 presents this explanation in graphical form. In the figure, two indifference curves for a particular good X and wealth are given. Consider an individual who is given goods X such that they move from point A (where they have X0 of good X) to point B (where they have the same wealth and X1 of good X). Their WTP represented by the vertical distance from B to C, because (after giving up that amount of wealth) the individual is indifferent about being at A or C. Now consider an individual who gives up goods such that they move from B to A. Their WTA represented by the (larger) vertical distance from A to D because (after receiving that much wealth) they are indifferent about either being at point B or D. Shogren et al. (1994) has reported findings that lend support to Hanemann&#x27;s hypothesis. However, Kahneman, Knetsch, and Thaler (1991) find that the endowment effect continues even when wealth effects are fully controlled for.
:&quot;Figure 2: Hanemann&#x27;s Endowment Effect Explanation&quot;

When goods are indivisible, a coalitional game can be set up so that a utility function can be defined on all subsets of the goods.
Hu (2020) shows the endowment effect when the utility function is superadditive, i.e., the value of the whole is greater than the sum of its parts. Hu (2020) also introduces a few unbiased solutions which mitigate endowment bias.

===Connection-based, or &quot;psychological ownership&quot; theories===
Connection-based theories propose that the attachment or association with the self-induced by owning a good is responsible for the endowment effect (for a review, see Morewedge &amp; Giblin, 2015). Work by Morewedge, Shu, Gilbert and Wilson (2009) provides support for these theories, as does work by Maddux et al. (2010). For example, research participants who were given one mug and asked how much they would pay for a second mug (&quot;owner-buyers&quot;) were WTP as much as &quot;owners-sellers,&quot; another group of participants who were given a mug and asked how much they were WTA to sell it (both groups valued the mug in question more than buyers who were not given a mug). Others have argued that the short duration of ownership or highly prosaic items typically used in endowment effect type studies is not sufficient to produce such a connection, conducting research demonstrating support for those points (e.g. Liersch &amp; Rottenstreich, Working Paper).

Two paths by which attachment or self-associations increase the value of a good have been proposed (Morewedge &amp; Giblin, 2015). An attachment theory suggests that ownership creates a non-transferable balanced association between the self and the good. The good is incorporated into the self-concept of the owner, becoming part of her identity and imbuing it with attributes related to her self-concept. Self-associations may take the form of an emotional attachment to the good. Once an attachment has formed, the potential loss of the good is perceived as a threat to the self. A real-world example of this would be an individual refusing to part with a college T-shirt because it supports one&#x27;s identity as an alumnus of that university. A second route by which ownership may increase value is through a self-referential memory effect (SRE) – the better encoding and recollection of stimuli associated with the self-concept. People have a better memory for goods they own than goods they do not own. The self-referential memory effect for owned goods may act thus as an endogenous framing effect. During a transaction, attributes of a good may be more accessible to its owners than are other attributes of the transaction. Because most goods have more positive than negative features, this accessibility bias should result in owners more positively evaluating their goods than do non-owners.

=== Greater sensitivity to market demands for sellers ===
Sellers may dictate a price based on the desires of multiple potential buyers, whereas buyers may consider their own taste. This can lead to differences between buying and selling prices because the market price is typically higher than one&#x27;s idiosyncratic price estimate. According to this account, the endowment effect can be viewed as under-pricing for buyers compared to the market price; or over-pricing for sellers compared to their individual taste. Two recent lines of study support this argument. Weaver and Frederick (2012) presented their participants with retail prices of products, and then asked them to specify either their buying or selling price for these products. The results revealed that sellers&#x27; valuations were closer to the known retail prices than those of buyers. A second line of studies is a meta-analysis of buying and selling of lotteries. A review of over 30 empirical studies showed that selling prices were closer to the lottery&#x27;s expected value, which is the normative price of the lottery: hence the endowment effect was consistent with buyers&#x27; tendency to under-price lotteries as compared to the normative price. One possible reason for this tendency of buyers to indicate lower prices is their risk aversion. By contrast, sellers may assume that the market is heterogeneous enough to include buyers with potential risk neutrality and therefore adjust their price closer to a risk neutral expected value.

=== Biased information processing theories ===
Several cognitive accounts of the endowment effect suggest that it is induced by the way endowment status changes the search for, attention to, recollection of, and weighting of information regarding the transaction. Frames evoked by acquisition of a good (e.g., buying, choosing it rather than another good) may increase the cognitive accessibility of information favoring the decision to keep one&#x27;s money and not acquire the good. By contrast, frames evoked by disposition of the good (e.g., selling) may increase the cognitive accessibility of information favoring the decision to keep the good rather than trade or dispose of it for money (for a review, see Morewedge &amp; Giblin, 2015). For example, Johnson and colleagues (2007) found that prospective mug buyers tended to recall reasons to keep their money before recalling reasons to buy the mug, whereas sellers tended to recall reasons to keep their mug before reasons to sell it for money.

===Evolutionary arguments===
Huck, Kirchsteiger &amp; Oechssler (2005) have raised the hypothesis that natural selection may favor individuals whose preferences embody an endowment effect given that it may improve one&#x27;s bargaining position in bilateral trades. Thus in a small tribal society with a few alternative sellers (i.e. where the buyer may not have the option of moving to an alternative seller), having a predisposition towards embodying the endowment effect may be evolutionarily beneficial. This may be linked with findings (Shogren, et al., 1994) that suggest the endowment effect is less strong when the relatively artificial sense of scarcity induced in experimental settings is lessened. Countervailing evidence for an evolutionary account is provided by studies showing that the endowment effect is moderated by exposure to modern exchange markets (e.g., hunter gatherer tribes with market exposure are more likely to exhibit the endowment effect than tribes that do not), and that the endowment effect is moderated by culture (Maddux et al., 2010).

==Criticisms==
Some economists have questioned the effect&#x27;s existence. Hanemann (1991) noted that economic theory only suggests that WTP and WTA should be equal for goods which are close substitutes, so observed differences in these measures for goods such as environmental resources and personal health can be explained without reference to an endowment effect. Shogren, et al. (1994) noted that the experimental technique used by Kahneman, Knetsch and Thaler (1990) to demonstrate the endowment effect created a situation of artificial scarcity. They performed a more robust experiment with the same goods used by Kahneman, Knetsch and Thaler (chocolate bars and mugs) and found little evidence of the endowment effect in substitutable goods, acknowledging the endowment effect as valid for goods without substitutes—non-renewable Earth resources being an example of these. Others have argued that the use of hypothetical questions and experiments involving small amounts of money tells us little about actual behavior (e.g. Hoffman and Spitzer, 1993, p. 69, n. 23) with some research supporting these points (e.g., Kahneman, Knetsch and Thaler, 1990, Harless, 1989) and others not (e.g. Knez, Smith and Williams, 1985). More recently, Plott and Zeiler have challenged the endowment effect theory by arguing that observed disparities between WTA and WTP measures are not reflective of human preferences, but rather such disparities stem from faulty experimental designs.

==Implications==
Implications regarding the endowment effect are present at both the individual and corporate level. Its presence can cause market inefficiencies and value irregularities between buyers and sellers with similar consequences at smaller or upscaled transactions.

=== Individual ===
Herbert Hovenkamp (1991) has argued that the presence of an endowment effect has significant implications for law and economics, particularly in regard to welfare economics. He argues that the presence of an endowment effect indicates that a person has no indifference curve (see however Hanemann, 1991) rendering the neoclassical tools of welfare analysis useless, concluding that courts should instead use WTA as a measure of value. Fischel (1995) however, raises the counterpoint that using WTA as a measure of value would deter the development of a nation&#x27;s infrastructure and economic growth. The endowment effect changes the shape of the indifference curves substantially Similarly, another study that is focused on the Strategic Reallocations for Endowment analyses how it is the case that economics&#x27;s agents welfare could potentially increase if they change their endowment holding.

Further to this, the endowment effect has been linked to both economic and psychological impacts of various scale. For example, often individuals refuse the sale of their house or upscale their expected value simply due to their emotional attachment and effort poured into it. This means they might either stick with a property which causes greater inconvenience to alternatives or have an increased level of difficulties associated with its sale. Either of these scenarios both negatively impact the relevant economy and the individual&#x27;s mental welfare. Alternatively, if a buyer is subject to purchasing the item at the WTA level when it is set above market price, they are subject to overspending which positively impacts the economy whilst potentially reducing individual welfare yet again.

=== Business ===
In recent years the endowment effect has largely been leveraged within e-commerce. Businesses have expanded more rapidly than previous years through its effective integration into marketing products and services. Here consumers are often given a sense of ownership over what the business possesses thereby unlocking the cognitive bias.

==== Free trials ====
By offering free trials to select services, business not only expand the number of users reached, but during this trial period they also give consumers a sense of ownership. Consumer&#x27;s psychological perception thus makes them more reluctant to part with the service when the trial ends, thereby increasing the quantity of subscribers.

==== Free return ====
This marketing strategy makes consumers more likely to purchase the product due to the perception of it being more endowing. However, once purchased, customers are less inclined to return it even if a level of dissatisfaction was experienced.

==== Haptic imagery ====
Various businesses offer a sense of ownership through showing customers what their product might look like in a relatable environment. Fashion and furniture businesses largely rely on haptic imagery to sell their products. While they do not necessarily offer customers to use their products they create an image of what could be, by either offering online viewing adjustments or appealing to ones sense of imagination. This feeling of ownership makes it harder for consumers to let go of the image and thus the product.

<text>The is a Mini-shinkansen rail line in Japan. Serving the Kantō and Tōhoku Regions of the country, it links Tokyo and Akita in Akita prefecture. From Tokyo to Morioka in Iwate prefecture, it operates on the Tōhoku Shinkansen tracks. From Morioka to Ōmagari, it uses the Tazawako Line tracks. The section from Ōmagari to Akita uses the Ōu Main Line tracks.

==Operations==
Services consist of &quot;Komachi&quot; trains which are 7-car E6 series mini-shinkansen sets coupled with E5 series &quot;Hayabusa&quot; trains for the portion of the journey between Tokyo and Morioka. 

The &quot;Komachi&quot; services run at a maximum speed of on the Tohoku Shinkansen, and between Morioka and Akita, run as 7-car independent trains with a maximum speed of . However, is more typical for the line through the hills east of Akita, with trains frequently slowing to for curves such as those south of Ugo. The line from Morioka to Akita is prone to deep snow.

The fastest timetabled journey between Akita and Tokyo currently takes 3 hours and 37 minutes calling at four or five stops in between.

<doc id="804743" wikidata="Q252048" url="?curid=804743" title="Yamagata Shinkansen">
<text>The is a Mini-shinkansen route in Japan, operated by East Japan Railway Company (JR East). It provides service between Tokyo and Shinjō in Yamagata Prefecture over the tracks of the Tohoku Shinkansen and the Ōu Main Line.

The term Yamagata Shinkansen refers to the segment that connects Fukushima and Shinjō. Because the shinkansen trains share tracks with local trains running on , it is often referred to as a &quot;mini-shinkansen&quot;.

==Operations==

Trains consist of 7-car E3 and E8 series trainsets operating as &quot;Tsubasa&quot; services. Between and Fukushima, some trains run coupled to &quot;Yamabiko&quot; trains on the Tōhoku Shinkansen. Between Fukushima and Shinjō, the trains run on their own at a maximum speed of and share the line with regular Ōu Main Line trains.

As of July 2012, about 62 million passengers had ridden the line since it opened in July 1992. The fastest trains connect Tokyo and Yamagata stations in two hours and 29 minutes.

===Construction of a new approach line at Fukushima Station===

In April 2021, JR East started construction of a new approach line at Fukushima station. Currently, the Yamagata Shinkansen can only enter and exit the Tohoku Shinkansen through platform 14 at Fukushima Station. This current layout requires the Yamagata Shinkansen to cross the north bound tracks to reach the Tokyo bound tracks. This new approach line will pass under the Tohoku Shinkansen, which will allow Yamagata Shinkansen to enter the Tohoku Shinkansen on platform 11 removing the crossing and reducing the gravitude of transport disruption. Construction is expected to finish by the end of fiscal year 2026.

===Proposed Ou base tunnel===
Construction of a base tunnel on the Yamagata Shinkansen is proposed, with JR East having undertaken a survey of a planned route from Niwasaka to Sekine, just south of Yonezawa station. of the proposed line would be in tunnel, mostly to the north of the existing Fukushima – Yamagata section. To be built on an improved alignment, the tunnel would lower journey times between Fukushima and Yamagata by ~10 min due to a proposed line speed of up to .

The tunnel would avoid the Itaya Toge pass through the Ou mountains west of Fukushima. Gradients range from 3.0% to 3.8% and the line reaches an altitude of . The curvature and steep grades limit train speeds to or less, and the line is vulnerable to heavy rain and snowfall as well as high winds. Between 2011 and 2017 a total of 410 Yamagata mini-Shinkansen services were either suspended or delayed, and 40% of these incidents occurred on the line over the Itaya Toge pass.

If the base tunnel is authorised, detailed design would take five years and construction another 15 years. The cost could increase by if the tunnel were to be built with a cross-section large enough to permit the line to be upgraded to the full Shinkansen Loading gauge.

<doc id="804748" wikidata="Q373657" url="?curid=804748" title="Jeff Reardon">
<text>Jeffrey James Reardon (born October 1, 1955) is an American former professional baseball relief pitcher who played in Major League Baseball (MLB) from 1979–1994 with the New York Mets, Montreal Expos, Minnesota Twins, Boston Red Sox, Atlanta Braves, Cincinnati Reds, and New York Yankees. Reardon was nicknamed &quot;the Terminator&quot; for his intimidating presence on the mound and 98 mph fastball.
A long-time closer, Reardon became MLB&#x27;s all-time saves leader in 1992 with his 342nd save, breaking Rollie Fingers&#x27; previous record of 341. Reardon&#x27;s record was broken the following season by Lee Smith. Reardon currently ranks 12th on the all-time saves list with 367.

==Career==
After graduation in 1973 from Wahconah Regional High School in Dalton, Massachusetts, Reardon was drafted by the Montreal Expos in the 23rd round of the 1973 amateur draft, but did not sign. Reardon played college baseball for the University of Massachusetts Amherst. While at UMass, he played collegiate summer baseball for three years (1974–1976) with the Cotuit Kettleers of the Cape Cod Baseball League, and in 2000 was named a member of the inaugural class of the Cape Cod Baseball League Hall of Fame. After college, Reardon went undrafted and signed a minor league contract with the New York Mets in 1977, and was assigned to the Lynchburg Mets in the Single-A Carolina League. Although undrafted, Reardon quickly made his way through the Mets&#x27; farm system, compiling a 30–9 record with a 2.68 ERA and 6 saves in 74 games combined between Lynchburg, Jackson in 1978, and Tidewater in 1979.

Reardon made his Major League debut with the Mets on August 25, 1979, and would stay in the majors for the rest of his career. He pitched for the Mets until midway through the 1981 season, working mostly as a middle reliever, when he was traded to the Montreal Expos along with outfielder Dan Norman for Ellis Valentine. Lacking a reliable closer on the big league staff, the Expos immediately turned Reardon loose in the ninth inning, and he responded by saving 146 games from 1982 to 1986.

When with the Expos, Reardon suffered streaks of inconsistency, occasionally blowing two or three save opportunities in a row. During one bad streak in 1983, Montreal players&#x27; wives were invited to appear on the field, and the Expos&#x27; fans at Olympic Stadium booed his wife.

During his time in Montreal, Reardon was named to the All-Star team twice (1985–1986), and led the majors in saves during the 1985 season, earning the Rolaids Relief Man of the Year Award.
Prior to the start of the 1987 season, Reardon was again traded—this time to the Minnesota Twins along with catcher Tom Nieto—for pitchers Neal Heaton, Yorkis Pérez, and Alfredo Cardwood and catcher Jeff Reed. Although his performance dropped compared to his previous five seasons, the trade would immediately pay dividends for the team as he would help the Twins win the 1987 World Series. The next season, he reverted to form, was named to his third All-Star team, and became the first pitcher in Major League Baseball history to have 40-save seasons in both the American and National Leagues. After another good season in 1989, Reardon became a free agent and signed with the Boston Red Sox on December 6. In honor of Reardon&#x27;s signing, his birthplace of Dalton, Massachusetts, named its athletic field after him. After saving &quot;only&quot; 21 games for the Red Sox in 1990, Reardon was named to his fourth and final All-Star team in 1991 after another 40-save season. He broke Rollie Fingers&#x27; all-time saves record in 1992 with his 342nd save. Later that season, he was traded to the Atlanta Braves for starting pitcher Nate Minchey and minor league outfielder Sean Ross. With the Braves, he pitched in his second World Series and was responsible for two of Atlanta&#x27;s four losses versus Toronto, blowing a save in Game 2 and giving up the winning hit in Game 3.

Following the 1992 season, Reardon signed as a free agent with the Cincinnati Reds. However, his days of closing were over; he worked as the setup man to Rob Dibble. Reardon finished the 1993 season with his highest ERA (4.09) since 1987 and his fewest saves (8) since 1981. Granted free agency, Reardon signed with the New York Yankees on February 15, 1994. Although he went north with the team, Reardon retired on May 4, 1994, after compiling an 8.38 ERA while allowing 17 hits over innings in 11 games. After his 16-year career, Reardon stood second on the all-time saves list (to Lee Smith), finishing with more saves (367) than walks (358) and was the only reliever to have more than 20 saves every year from 1982 to 1988.

==Post career==
After the end of his career, Reardon retired to Palm Beach Gardens, Florida at PGA National Golf Club with his wife, Phebe, and three children, Jay, Shane, and Kristi, turning down offers to coach in order to spend time with his family. Other than appearing as a corporate sponsor and speaker for Lerner Sports Marketing, Reardon&#x27;s retirement was uneventful.

On February 21, 2004, Reardon&#x27;s son, Shane—who had long struggled with drugs and had been sent to the Academy at Swift River, a therapeutic boarding school in Massachusetts for his senior year in high school—died of a drug overdose at the age of 20. Following his son&#x27;s death, Reardon spiraled into depression, even trying to take his life, before seeking psychiatric help. Following a one-week stay in a clinic, Reardon was prescribed a half-dozen antidepressant and antipsychotic medications. Just before Christmas 2005, Reardon was diagnosed with a blocked artery in his heart, which required insertion of a heart stent, being the second Reardon had needed. Following surgery, Reardon developed a urinary-tract infection, requiring more medications. By this time, he was taking more than a dozen separate prescriptions, one of which was Levaquin, which is known to have side effects such as paranoia, anxiety and depression—further exacerbating his pre-existing conditions.

On December 26, 2005, Reardon was taken into custody in the parking area and charged by the Palm Beach Gardens, Florida Police Department for allegedly committing armed robbery at a Hamilton Jewelers store inside The Gardens Mall. Reardon attributed his actions to the influence of the medications which he had been taking since his son died in 2004. Soon after the episode at the mall and his release from an overnight stay in jail, Reardon returned to a psychiatric facility, and was an inpatient for nearly two months. At that time, his doctors drastically reduced his medications and began to administer electroshock treatments. However, Reardon still had to stand trial.

Reardon was found not guilty of the charges by reason of drug-induced insanity. The judge ruled because Reardon had been taking anti-depressants and mood stabilizers, and he was distraught over his son&#x27;s death, there was no reasonable explanation for the robbery. In addition, Reardon was not required to be committed after the ruling.

After the death of their son, the Reardons established a foundation in Shane&#x27;s name dedicated to helping those struggling with addiction.

<doc id="804749" wikidata="Q784869" url="?curid=804749" title="The Hunger for More">
<text>The Hunger for More is the debut solo studio album by American rapper Lloyd Banks. Originally scheduled for a May 25, 2004 release, the album was ultimately released on June 29, 2004 through Interscope Records and 50 Cent&#x27;s G-Unit Records.

Recording sessions took place at Sony Studios, Spydadome, Right Track Studios and Teamwork Studios in New York, The Power House at Metropolis Studios in London, The Big House in Farmington, The Hit Factory Criteria in Miami, and 54 Sound in Detroit.

Production was handled by Eminem, Sha Money XL, Baby Grand, Black Jeruz, Chad Beat, Greg &quot;Jinx&quot; Doby, Havoc, Hi-Tek, Kwamé, Ron Browz, Scram Jones, Thayod Ausar, The Diaz Brothers and Timbaland, with co-producer Danja and additional producer Luis Resto. It features guest appearances from fellow G-Unit members 50 Cent (who executive produced the album), The Game, Tony Yayo and Young Buck, as well as Nate Dogg, Eminem and Snoop Dogg.

The album debuted atop the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200 albums chart in the United States, at number two on the Canadian Albums Chart and peaked at number 15 on the UK Albums Chart. It was certified Platinum by the Recording Industry Association of America and Music Canada and Gold by the British Phonographic Industry.

It was supported with three charted singles: &quot;On Fire&quot;, &quot;I&#x27;m So Fly&quot; and &quot;Karma&quot;. Its lead single received a Grammy Award for Best Rap Solo Performance nomination at the 47th Annual Grammy Awards.

==Background==
===Concept===
During an interview Lloyd Banks explained the reason behind naming the album. He said: 

===Recordings===


During the first week of &quot;The Hunger For More&quot;&#x27;s release, a distribution house in Manhattan was robbed of approximately eight boxes of the CDs (200 copies). A New York record store had nearly 100 copies of the CD stolen from its racks by a single perpetrator on the album&#x27;s first day in stores, though they were later recovered.

==Songs==
In support of the album, G-Unit/Interscope Records released three singles with accompanying music videos.

Its lead single, &quot;On Fire&quot;, was released prior to the album, on April 27, 2004. It peaked at number 8 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100, number 4 on the Hot R&amp;B/Hip-Hop Songs, and number 2 on the Hot Rap Songs in the US. It was nominated for a Grammy Award for Best Rap Solo Performance at the 47th Annual Grammy Awards held on February 13, 2005, but lost to Jay-Z&#x27;s &quot;99 Problems&quot;. On May 19, 2005, the song was certified Gold by the RIAA. The song can be heard in the fifth episode of the third season of TV series &quot;The Wire&quot; entitled &quot;Straight and True&quot; and in 2005 film &quot;Fantastic Four&quot;.

The second single off the album, &quot;I&#x27;m So Fly&quot;, was released on July 13, 2004. It did not make it to the US &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100, however, it peaked at number 2 on the Bubbling Under Hot 100 singles, number 32 on the Hot R&amp;B/Hip-Hop Songs and number 21 on the Hot Rap Songs. Music videos for the first two singles were directed by Jessy Terrero.

The album&#x27;s third and final single, &quot;Karma&quot;, was released on October 19, 2004. It reached number 17 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100, number 9 on the Hot R&amp;B/Hip-Hop Songs and number 6 on the Hot Rap Songs in the US. The music video, directed by Little X, and radio versions of the song features R&amp;B singer Avant instead of Kevin Cossom, who provided additional vocals on its album version.

In 2009, the song &quot;Warrior, Pt. 2&quot; was used in &quot;So You Think You Can Dance&quot; (American TV series) season 6.

==Critical reception==

&quot;The Hunger for More&quot; was met with generally favourable reviews from music critics. At Metacritic, which assigns a normalized rating out of 100 to reviews from mainstream publications, the album received an average score of 66 based on ten reviews.

Steve &#x27;Flash&#x27; Juon of RapReviews claimed: &quot;while it&#x27;s not better than 50&#x27;s national debut or G-Unit&#x27;s album, it&#x27;s certainly no worse&quot;. AllMusic&#x27;s David Jeffries called it &quot;another solid release from the crew&quot;, and also compared it with G-Unit&#x27;s previous releases, saying it is &quot;a couple steps down from 50 Cent&#x27;s &quot;Get Rich or Die Tryin&#x27;&quot; and a step above G-Unit&#x27;s &quot;Beg for Mercy&quot;&quot;. Rondell Conway of &quot;Vibe&quot; stated: &quot;while he excels in clever jousting, Banks lacks range and storytelling ability&quot;. E! Online reviewer found &quot;the one thing Banks lacks is Fiddy&#x27;s natural charisma--he&#x27;s also about eight bulletholes short in the &quot;life-experience department&quot;. Dean Kuipers of &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot; wrote: &quot;though not one of the songs on the album stands out in terms of head-popping new production -- there&#x27;s not a hit that will transcend the hip-hop hard-core -- each cut is utterly bulletproof, and Banks&#x27; lyrics provide a few new twists&quot;.

In mixed reviews, Chairman Mao of &quot;Blender&quot; resumed: &quot;while Banks&#x27;s wicked wordplay is impressive, his one-liners get him only so far&quot;. Jon Caramanica of &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; concluded: &quot;Banks... raps each verse as if his entire career depends on it&quot;.

==Commercial performance==
In the United States, the album debuted at the top of the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200, the Top R&amp;B/Hip-Hop Albums and the Top Rap Albums charts, with 434,000 copies sold in its first week of its release. It remained at number-one in the second week, selling close to 164,000 copies. &quot;That&#x27;s the kind of debut that veteran artists have&quot;, says Banks. &quot;That showed me that following 50&#x27;s moves and studying the way that he played the game had put me in an incredible position&quot;. On September 9, 2004, the album was certified platinum by the Recording Industry Association of America for 1 million units sold in America.

The album also debuted at number 2 on the Canadian Albums Chart. In October 2004, the album received a Platinum certification by the Canadian Recording Industry Association for sales of 100,000 copies in Canada.

In the United Kingdom, the album peaked at number 15 on the UK Albums Chart, number 7 on the Official Hip Hop and R&amp;B Albums Chart and number 19 on the Scottish Albums Chart. The album reached its Gold status by the British Phonographic Industry on June 17, 2016.

<doc id="804755" wikidata="Q260460" url="?curid=804755" title="Antecedent (logic)">
<text>An antecedent is the first half of a hypothetical proposition, whenever the if-clause precedes the then-clause. In some contexts the antecedent is called the protasis.

Examples:

* If formula_1, then formula_2.

This is a nonlogical formulation of a hypothetical proposition. In this case, the antecedent is P, and the consequent is Q. In the implication &quot;formula_3 implies formula_4&quot;, formula_3 is called the antecedent and formula_4 is called the consequent. Antecedent and consequent are connected via logical connective to form a proposition. 

* If formula_7 is a man, then formula_7 is mortal.

&quot;formula_7 is a man&quot; is the antecedent for this proposition while &quot;formula_7 is mortal&quot; is the consequent of the proposition.

* If men have walked on the Moon, then I am the king of France.

Here, &quot;men have walked on the Moon&quot; is the antecedent and &quot;I am the king of France&quot; is the consequent.

Let formula_11.

* If formula_12 then formula_13.

&quot;formula_12&quot; is the antecedent and &quot;formula_13&quot; is the consequent of this hypothetical proposition.

<doc id="804764" wikidata="Q4774480" url="?curid=804764" title="Anti-terrorism, Crime and Security Act 2001">
<text>The Anti-terrorism, Crime and Security Act 2001 is an Act of Parliament of the United Kingdom, formally introduced into Parliament on 19 November 2001, two months after the terrorist attacks in the United States on 11 September. It received royal assent and came into force on 14 December 2001. Many of its measures are not specifically related to terrorism, and a Parliamentary committee was critical of the swift timetable for such a long bill including non-emergency measures.

The Act was widely criticized, with one commentator describing it as &quot;the most draconian legislation Parliament has passed in peacetime in over a century&quot;. On 16 December 2004, the Law Lords ruled that Section 23 was incompatible with the European Convention on Human Rights, but under the terms of the Human Rights Act 1998 it remained in force. It has since been replaced by the Prevention of Terrorism Act 2005.

== Part 1 (Terrorist property) ==
Sections 1–3, along with schedules 1 and 100, applied to the finances of suspected terrorists and terrorist organizations. They rewrote parts of the Terrorism Act 2000 relating to seizure of suspected terrorist assets.

== Part 2 (Freezing orders) ==
This part re-enacted and widened provisions of the Emergency Laws (Re-enactments and Repeals) Act 1964, which in themselves dated from the Defence (General) Regulations 1939.

=== Usage against Iceland ===
In October 2008, prime minister Gordon Brown invoked this part of the Act within the Landsbanki Freezing Order 2008 to freeze the British assets of Icelandic bank Landsbanki during the Icelandic financial crisis, by virtue of the fact that the Treasury reasonably believed that &quot;action to the detriment of the United Kingdom&#x27;s economy (or part of it) has been or is likely to be taken by a person or persons&quot;.

Unless explicitly stated, the short title of an Act does not limit the powers expressed within it. The Act does not say &quot;terrorism-related action to the detriment of the United Kingdom&#x27;s economy&quot;. Indeed, the government had defeated attempts to restrict Part 2 to terrorism-related cases during the passage of the Bill through the House of Lords. The long title of the Act lists &quot;to provide for the freezing of assets&quot; as a separate item from &quot;To amend the Terrorism Act 2000; to make further provision about terrorism and security&quot;.

Iceland&#x27;s prime minister Geir Haarde protested against what he described &quot;a terrorist law ... being applied against us&quot;, calling it &quot;a completely unfriendly act&quot;.

== Part 3 (Disclosure of information) ==
This part gives new powers to Her Majesty&#x27;s Customs and Excise and Inland Revenue (now merged into His Majesty&#x27;s Revenue and Customs) to permit them to disclose information &quot;for law enforcement purposes&quot;. It also clarifies the existing requirements to disclose information for criminal investigations, particularly in relation to confidential information held by public bodies.

== Part 4 (Immigration and asylum) ==
Part 4 allowed for the Home Secretary to certify any non-British citizen whom he suspected to be a terrorist and detain them indefinitely, pending deportation, even when such a deportation would be prohibited. The Law Lords ruled against the law in a case brought by nine of the detained suspected terrorists on 16 December 2004 (by issuing against it a declaration of incompatibility with the European Convention on Human Rights, as provided in the Human Rights Act 1998). The measure was effectively abolished the following March when it was up for review. Its powers were replaced with &quot;control orders&quot;, brought in by the Prevention of Terrorism Act 2005.

=== Implementation ===

The Immigration Act 1971 allows for the deportation of those who are a threat to national security for cases where there is insufficient admissible evidence for prosecution; however, a ruling by the European Court of Human Rights in the case of Chahal v United Kingdom in 1996 ruled that deportation of persons to another country was not allowed if there were substantial grounds for believing that the person would be subjected to torture. As a result, the government argued that this provision was necessary to overcome this conjunction of legal and security problems, and allow indefinite detention without charge or trial.

Since this measure was known to step beyond the bounds of Article 5 of the ECHR, the government included section 30 to allow for a derogation (an opt out), claiming that since there was a &quot;state of emergency threatening the life of the nation&quot; (just one interpretation of the War on Terror) which allowed it to do this. The Special Immigration Appeals Commission was to oversee the process.

The derogation order came into force on 13 November 2001, and was repealed on 8 April 2005. Between those dates the government claimed that there existed in the United Kingdom a state of public emergency threatening the life of the nation, within the meaning of Article 15(1) of the ECHR.

This part was renewed by Parliament on 3 March 2003 without a vote, and on 3 March 2004 with a vote.

=== Cases ===
Between 2001 and 2003 sixteen foreign nationals had been detained and held using these powers at Belmarsh. Eight were detained in December 2001, one in February 2002, two in April 2002, one in October 2002, one in November 2002, two in January 2002 and one in October 2003. One further individual has been certified but is detained under other powers. Of the total detained, two have voluntarily left the United Kingdom. The other fourteen remained in detention as of 18 November 2003. The Council of Europe reported in a document dated 23 July 2004 that according to information supplied to their delegation by the authorities, in March 2004, there were fourteen persons certified as suspected international terrorists and deprived of their liberty in the United Kingdom. Twelve of them were being detained exclusively under Part 4 of the Anti-Terrorism, Crime and Security Act 2001, of whom half since December 2001.

The Act did provide a process for appealing to a judicial tribunal against the Home Secretary&#x27;s decision to detain in each case. However, the government had argued that a special appellate process was needed to deal with these appeals because of the possibility that much of the evidence or information upon which the Home Secretary&#x27;s suspicions may be based was likely to be sensitive information of a confidential nature whose release to the person detained or the public might compromise intelligence methods, operatives, and other persons. Therefore, the process established by the ATCSA involved special rules of evidence which most notably permitted the exclusion of the detainees and their legal representatives from proceedings. In an attempt to ensure that their rights were safeguarded at these times, special security-vetted &quot;special advocates&quot; were appointed in the place of their legal representatives. However, there is some evidence that these special advocates experienced difficulties effectively protecting their interests, and two of the special advocates subsequently resigned from their positions following the December 2004 ruling of the House of Lords.

In October 2002 the Special Immigration Appeals Commission decided that the Home Secretary&#x27;s derogation was lawful, and that there was indeed a &quot;state of emergency threatening the life of the nation&quot;.

A series of legal challenges were made in respect of the powers and processes established under the ATCSA and on 16 December 2004, the Law Lords ruled that the powers of detention conferred by Part 4 of ATCSA were incompatible with the UK&#x27;s obligations under the European Convention on Human Rights. The Court ruled by a majority of 8–1 that the purported derogation was not authorised by Article 15 of the European Convention on Human Rights since the measures taken could not rationally be held to be &quot;strictly required by the exigencies of the situation&quot;, and were also discriminatory contrary to Article 14 of the Convention.

The ruling could be summed up as follows:

* No detention pending deportation had lasted for more than seven days, let alone three years. 
* The law was unjustifiably discriminatory. What if a British citizen was also suspected of terrorism which required that they be detained indefinitely without trial? There was no way to do it. 
* There was no observable state of emergency threatening the life of the nation. No other European country which had experienced far more severe crises had declared such a state of emergency over such a long time period, and certainly without anyone noticing.

The Court quashed the order derogating from the UK&#x27;s obligations under the Convention, and issued a declaration pursuant to section 4 of the Human Rights Act 1998 that the provisions of the ATCSA which empowered the preventative detention of non-British suspected international terrorists were incompatible with the European Convention. The effect of such a declaration in British law is not to deprive the legislation of legal effect, and Parliament may, if it wishes, refuse to repeal or amend any provision declared to be incompatible. However the making of a declaration of incompatibility carries strong moral force, and creates considerable political pressure to address the incompatibility.

===Replacement of Part 4===

To this end Part 4 of the ATCSA was replaced by the Prevention of Terrorism Act 2005 in March 2005. This Act replaces detention in prison with &quot;control orders&quot; which allow for the imposition of an extensive and non-exhaustive set of conditions on the movements of the suspected person with restrictions approaching a form of house arrest.

Unlike Part 4 of the ATCSA, the powers in the Prevention of Terrorism Act 2005 can be applied to British and non-British suspected terrorists alike. At the time of its enactment there was considerable debate as to the compatibility of this Act&#x27;s provisions with domestic and international human rights laws.

Eleven control orders were issued on the night the act passed on 11 March 2005 against the terrorist suspects who were due to be released. By October of that year only three were still in force.

== Part 5 (Racial hatred) ==

This part substitutes &quot;racially aggravated&quot; with &quot;racially or religiously aggravated&quot; in some parts of the criminal law.

== Parts 6–8 (Weapons of mass destruction) ==

This part makes it illegal to deal in biological or chemical weapons, or set off a nuclear explosion. It also makes it illegal to disclose information &quot;which might prejudice the security of any nuclear site or of any nuclear material&quot;.

== Part 9 (Aircraft security) ==

This part allows for the Secretary of State to make new regulations, and for the detention of aircraft where there is suspicion of an act of violence against a person on the aircraft.

== Part 10 (Police powers) ==

This part allows the police to forcefully obtain fingerprints and other identifying features from an individual to ascertain their identity, and for the Ministry of Defence Police to operate as police officers outside of their normal MOD property jurisdiction in relation to non-MOD crime in certain circumstances as defined by the statute. It also allows members of the British Transport Police to operate as police officers outside of their &quot;natural jurisdiction&quot; (mainly the railways) in certain circumstances as defined by the statute.

== Part 11 (Retention of communications data) ==

This part creates wide powers for the Secretary of State to regulate telephone companies and internet providers to retain data for the purpose of national security.

== Part 12 (Bribery and corruption) ==

This part extends the laws against bribery to cases where &quot;functions of the person who receives or is offered a reward have no connection with the United Kingdom and are carried out in a country or territory outside the United Kingdom&quot;. It extends the laws against corruption so as to make prosecutions possible for &quot;act[s that] would, if done in the United Kingdom, constitute a corruption offence&quot;. The definitions of corruption offences are in Public Bodies Corrupt Practices Act 1889 and Prevention of Corruption Act 1906.

The Serious Fraud Office conducted an investigation into the Al Yamamah contract on the back of this strengthened legislation from late 2003 until 14 December 2006 when it was suddenly discontinued.

== Part 13 (Miscellaneous) ==

This part gives the Secretary of State the power to implement the Police and Judicial Co-operation in Criminal Matters section of the Maastricht Treaty.

== Part 14 (Supplemental) ==

This part outlines the timetable for the review of the Act by the independent reviewer of terrorism legislation.

<text>Greenwood is a village located in the western part of Kings County in Nova Scotia&#x27;s Annapolis Valley.

==History==
Greenwood was a small hamlet south of the Dominion Atlantic Railway&#x27;s Kingston Station. In 1942, the Royal Air Force established RAF Station Greenwood and built an aerodrome on nearby farmland to provide a facility for training aircrew under the British Commonwealth Air Training Plan. The Royal Canadian Air Force took over the facility in 1944, renaming it RCAF Station Greenwood, a name it maintained until the 1 February 1968 unification of the Canadian Forces which saw the airfield and associated facilities renamed CFB Greenwood. In July 1997 the air base became one of eleven operational wings in Canada, and was designated as 14 Wing Greenwood.

During the 1970s–2000s, the village of Greenwood expanded in population as numerous other air force bases in eastern Canada closed and their aircraft and personnel consolidated at CFB Greenwood. Much of the housing in the heart of Greenwood is for the military families stationed at the base, and are referred to as PMQs. Most of the non-military housing for the village is located on the outskirts.

==Schools==

<text>A consequent is the second half of a hypothetical proposition. In the standard form of such a proposition, it is the part that follows &quot;then&quot;. In an implication, if &quot;P&quot; implies &quot;Q&quot;, then &quot;P&quot; is called the antecedent and &quot;Q&quot; is called the consequent. In some contexts, the consequent is called the apodosis.

Examples:

* If formula_1, then formula_2.

formula_2 is the consequent of this hypothetical proposition.

* If formula_4 is a mammal, then formula_4 is an animal.

Here, &quot;formula_4 is an animal&quot; is the consequent.

* If computers can think, then they are alive.

&quot;They are alive&quot; is the consequent.

The consequent in a hypothetical proposition is not necessarily a consequence of the antecedent.

* If monkeys are purple, then fish speak Klingon.

&quot;Fish speak Klingon&quot; is the consequent here, but intuitively is not a consequence of (nor does it have anything to do with) the claim made in the antecedent that &quot;monkeys are purple&quot;.

<text>Cardiac surgery, or cardiovascular surgery, is a surgery on the heart or great vessels performed by cardiac surgeons. It is often used to treat complications of ischemic heart disease (for example, with coronary artery bypass grafting); to correct congenital heart disease; or to treat valvular heart disease from various causes, including endocarditis, rheumatic heart disease, and atherosclerosis. It also includes heart transplantation.

==History==

=== 19th century ===
The earliest operations on the pericardium (the sac that surrounds the heart) took place in the 19th century and were performed by Francisco Romero (1801) in the city of Almería (Spain), Dominique Jean Larrey (1810), Henry Dalton (1891), and Daniel Hale Williams (1893). The first surgery on the heart itself was performed by Axel Cappelen on 4 September 1895 at Rikshospitalet in Kristiania, now Oslo. Cappelen ligated a bleeding coronary artery in a 24-year-old man who had been stabbed in the left axilla and was in deep shock upon arrival. Access was through a left thoracotomy. The patient awoke and seemed fine for 24 hours but became ill with a fever and died three days after the surgery from mediastinitis.

=== 20th century ===
Surgery on the great vessels (e.g., aortic coarctation repair, Blalock–Thomas–Taussig shunt creation, closure of patent ductus arteriosus) became common after the turn of the century. However, operations on the heart valves were unknown until, in 1925, Henry Souttar operated successfully on a young woman with mitral valve stenosis. He made an opening in the appendage of the left atrium and inserted a finger in order to palpate and explore the damaged mitral valve. The patient survived for several years, but Souttar&#x27;s colleagues considered the procedure unjustified, and he could not continue.

Alfred Blalock, Helen Taussig, and Vivien Thomas performed the first successful palliative pediatric cardiac operation at Johns Hopkins Hospital on 29 November 1944, in a one-year-old girl with Tetralogy of Fallot. Their work on patient Eileen Saxon was dramatically portrayed by HBO in the 2004 television film &quot;Something The Lord Made&quot; as the birth of modern cardiac surgery. 

Cardiac surgery changed significantly after World War II. In 1947, Thomas Sellors of Middlesex Hospital in London operated on a Tetralogy of Fallot patient with pulmonary stenosis and successfully divided the stenosed pulmonary valve. In 1948, Russell Brock, probably unaware of Sellors&#x27;s work, used a specially designed dilator in three cases of pulmonary stenosis. Later that year, he designed a punch to resect a stenosed infundibulum, which is often associated with Tetralogy of Fallot. Many thousands of these &quot;blind&quot; operations were performed until the introduction of cardiopulmonary bypass made direct surgery on valves possible.

Also in 1948, four surgeons carried out successful operations for mitral valve stenosis resulting from rheumatic fever. Horace Smithy of Charlotte used a valvulotome to remove a portion of a patient&#x27;s mitral valve, while three other doctors—Charles Bailey of Hahnemann University Hospital in Philadelphia; Dwight Harken in Boston; and Russell Brock of Guy&#x27;s Hospital in London—adopted Souttar&#x27;s method. All four men began their work independently of one another within a period of a few months. This time, Souttar&#x27;s technique was widely adopted, with some modifications.

The first successful intracardiac correction of a congenital heart defect using hypothermia was performed by lead surgeon Dr. F. John Lewis (Dr. C. Walton Lillehei assisted) at the University of Minnesota on 2 September 1952. In 1953, Alexander Alexandrovich Vishnevsky conducted the first cardiac surgery under local anesthesia. In 1956, Dr. John Carter Callaghan performed the first documented open-heart surgery in Canada.

==Types of cardiac surgery==
=== Open-heart surgery ===
Open-heart surgery is any kind of surgery in which a surgeon makes a large incision (cut) in the chest to open the rib cage and operate on the heart. &quot;Open&quot; refers to the chest, not the heart. Depending on the type of surgery, the surgeon also may open the heart.

Dr. Wilfred G. Bigelow of the University of Toronto found that procedures involving opening the patient&#x27;s heart could be performed better in a bloodless and motionless environment. Therefore, during such surgery, the heart is temporarily stopped, and the patient is placed on cardiopulmonary bypass, meaning a machine pumps their blood and oxygen. Because the machine cannot function the same way as the heart, surgeons try to minimize the time a patient spends on it.

Cardiopulmonary bypass was developed after surgeons realized the limitations of hypothermia in cardiac surgery: Complex intracardiac repairs take time, and the patient needs blood flow to the body (particularly to the brain), as well as heart and lung function. In July 1952, Forest Dodrill was the first to use a mechanical pump in a human to bypass the left side of the heart whilst allowing the patient&#x27;s lungs to oxygenate the blood, in order to operate on the mitral valve. In 1953, Dr. John Heysham Gibbon of Jefferson Medical School in Philadelphia reported the first successful use of extracorporeal circulation by means of an oxygenator, but he abandoned the method after subsequent failures. In 1954, Dr. Lillehei performed a series of successful operations with the controlled cross-circulation technique, in which the patient&#x27;s mother or father was used as a &quot;heart-lung machine&quot;. Dr. John W. Kirklin at the Mayo Clinic was the first to use a Gibbon-type pump-oxygenator. Russell M. Nelson became the first surgeon to perform an open heart surgery in Utah in 1955.

Nazih Zuhdi performed the first total intentional hemodilution open-heart surgery on Terry Gene Nix, age 7, on 25 February 1960 at Mercy Hospital in Oklahoma City. The operation was a success; however, Nix died three years later. In March 1961, Zuhdi, Carey, and Greer performed open-heart surgery on a child, aged , using the total intentional hemodilution machine.

====Modern beating-heart surgery====
In the early 1990s, surgeons began to perform off-pump coronary artery bypass, done without cardiopulmonary bypass. In these operations, the heart continues beating during surgery, but is stabilized to provide an almost still work area in which to connect a conduit vessel that bypasses a blockage. The conduit vessel that is often used is the saphenous vein. This vein is harvested using a technique known as endoscopic vein harvesting (EVH).

===Heart transplant===
In 1945, the Soviet pathologist Nikolai Sinitsyn successfully transplanted a heart from one frog to another frog and from one dog to another dog.

Norman Shumway is widely regarded as the father of human heart transplantation, although the world&#x27;s first adult heart transplant was performed by a South African cardiac surgeon, Christiaan Barnard, using techniques developed by Shumway and Richard Lower. Barnard performed the first transplant on Louis Washkansky on 3 December 1967 at Groote Schuur Hospital in Cape Town. Adrian Kantrowitz performed the first pediatric heart transplant on 6 December 1967 at Maimonides Hospital (now Maimonides Medical Center) in Brooklyn, New York, barely three days later. Shumway performed the first adult heart transplant in the United States on 6 January 1968 at Stanford University Hospital.

===Coronary artery bypass grafting ===
Coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG), also called revascularization, is a common surgical procedure to create an alternative path to deliver blood supply to the heart and body, with the goal of preventing clot formation. This can be done in many ways, and the arteries used can be taken from several areas of the body. Arteries are typically harvested from the chest, arm, or wrist and then attached to a portion of the coronary artery, relieving pressure and limiting clotting factors in that area of the heart.

The procedure is typically performed because of coronary artery disease (CAD), in which a plaque-like substance builds up in the coronary artery, the main pathway carrying oxygen-rich blood to the heart. This can cause a blockage and/or a rupture, which can lead to a heart attack.

===Minimally invasive surgery===
As an alternative to open-heart surgery, which involves a five- to eight-inch incision in the chest wall, a surgeon may perform an endoscopic procedure by making very small incisions through which a camera and specialized tools are inserted.

In robot-assisted heart surgery, a machine controlled by a cardiac surgeon is used to perform a procedure. The main advantage to this is the size of the incision required: three small port holes instead of an incision big enough for the surgeon&#x27;s hands. The use of robotics in heart surgery continues to be evaluated, but early research has shown it to be a safe alternative to traditional techniques.

==Post-surgical procedures==
As with any surgical procedure, cardiac surgery requires postoperative precautions to avoid complications. Incision care is needed to avoid infection and minimize scarring. Swelling and loss of appetite are common.

Recovery from open-heart surgery begins with about 48 hours in an intensive care unit, where heart rate, blood pressure, and oxygen levels are closely monitored. Chest tubes are inserted to drain blood around the heart and lungs. After discharge from the hospital, compression socks may be recommended in order to regulate blood flow.

==Risks==
The advancement of cardiac surgery and cardiopulmonary bypass techniques has greatly reduced the mortality rates of these procedures. For instance, repairs of congenital heart defects are currently estimated to have 4–6% mortality rates.

A major concern with cardiac surgery is neurological damage. Stroke occurs in 2–3% of all people undergoing cardiac surgery, and the rate is higher in patients with other risk factors for stroke. A more subtle complication attributed to cardiopulmonary bypass is postperfusion syndrome, sometimes called &quot;pumphead&quot;. The neurocognitive symptoms of postperfusion syndrome were initially thought to be permanent, but turned out to be transient, with no permanent neurological impairment.

In order to assess the performance of surgical units and individual surgeons, a popular risk model has been created called the EuroSCORE. It takes a number of health factors from a patient and, using precalculated logistic regression coefficients, attempts to quantify the probability that they will survive to discharge. Within the United Kingdom, the EuroSCORE was used to give a breakdown of all cardiothoracic surgery centres and to indicate whether the units and their individuals surgeons performed within an acceptable range. The results are available on the Care Quality Commission website.

Another important source of complications are the neuropsychological and psychopathologic changes following open-heart surgery. One example is , described by Victor Skumin in 1978, which is a &quot;cardioprosthetic psychopathological syndrome&quot; associated with mechanical heart valve implants and characterized by irrational fear, anxiety, depression, sleep disorder, and weakness.

===Risk reduction===
Pharmacological and non-pharmacological prevention approaches may reduce the risk of atrial fibrillation after an operation and reduce the length of hospital stays, however there is no evidence that this improves mortality.

==== Non-pharmacologic approaches ====
Preoperative physical therapy may reduce postoperative pulmonary complications, such as pneumonia and atelectasis, in patients undergoing elective cardiac surgery and may decrease the length of hospital stay by more than three days on average. There is evidence that quitting smoking at least four weeks before surgery may reduce the risk of postoperative complications.

==== Pharmacological approaches ====
Beta-blocking medication is sometimes prescribed during cardiac surgery. There is some low certainty evidence that this perioperative blockade of beta-adrenergic receptors may reduce the incidence of atrial fibrillation and ventricular arrhythmias in patients undergoing cardiac surgery.

<text>Pad Abort Test 2 was the follow-on second abort test to Pad Abort Test 1 of the Apollo spacecraft .

==Objectives==
Apollo Pad Abort Test 2 was the fifth of six uncrewed Apollo missions that flight tested the capability of the launch escape system (LES) to provide for safe recovery of Apollo crews under critical abort conditions. This flight was the second test of the launch escape system with the abort initiated from the launch pad.

The launch escape system included qualified launch escape and pitch motors and was equipped with canards to orient the vehicle aft heat shield forward prior to tower jettison and parachute deployment. A boost protective cover was also provided. The spacecraft was BP-23A, a boilerplate Apollo command module that had been used on mission A-002 and refurbished to more nearly simulate a Block-I-type command module in mass and other characteristics. The Earth landing system was similar to the one used in mission A-003.

The test flight was conducted on June 29, 1965. The vehicle was lifted from Launch Complex 36 by the launch escape motor at 13:00:01 UTC (06:00:01 MST). The launch escape and pitch control motors ignited simultaneously, placing the test vehicle into the planned initial trajectory. A moderate roll rate developed at lift-off, which was due to the aerodynamic asymmetry of the vehicle configuration; however, the roll rate did not affect the success of the test.

The canard surfaces deployed and turned the vehicle to the desired orientation for drogue parachute deployment. During the turnaround maneuver, the launch escape tower and forward heat shield were jettisoned as planned. The boost protective cover, which was attached to the launch escape system, protected the conical surface of the command module and remained intact through a canard-induced pitch maneuver. At tower jettison, the soft boost protective cover, as expected, collapsed because of differential pressure during removal from the command module. No recontact or interference between the major components was evident during tower jettison and parachute deployment.

Although one of the pilot parachute steel cable risers was kinked, the Earth landing system functioned properly. The drogue parachutes inflated and stabilized the command module for pilot and main parachute deployment, and the rate of descent while on the main parachutes was satisfactory. The maximum altitude achieved was above mean sea level, approximately higher than predicted. The command module landed about from the launch site, some farther than planned.

Four glass samples had been mounted on the command module in the general area planned for the rendezvous and crew windows. No soot appeared on the samples, but an oily film was found on the exposed surfaces of three of the four samples. This film, however, was not expected to cause excessive degradation to the horizon scan or ground orientation ability during an abort. The test was highly successful and all planned objectives were fulfilled.

<doc id="804808" wikidata="Q1171232" url="?curid=804808" title="Kunimitsu Tezuka">
<text>is a fictional character in the manga and anime series &quot;The Prince of Tennis.&quot; He was created by Takeshi Konomi, who described Tezuka as the character with whom he has the least in common. Tezuka&#x27;s character is well received by readers and has ranked among the top five most popular characters in every Shonen Jump character popularity poll of the series. He is known for his seriousness, strictness, and fair leadership as the captain of the team. Tezuka often sacrifices his injured left arm to defeat opponents and lead his team to victory.

In the story, he is introduced as the strict and serious captain of Seishun Academy&#x27;s (&quot;Seigaku&quot; for short) tennis team who enforces order within his team, often forcing its members to run laps. With his all-around tennis style and advanced techniques, Tezuka is considered to be a national-level tennis player by many of the other characters.

==Description==
Tezuka encourages the series protagonist, Ryoma Echizen, to develop his own style of tennis, leading the latter to consider him as both a mentor and rival. Throughout the series, Tezuka continues to struggle with consistent pain in his left arm, which was inflicted on him two years prior to the main storyline by an upperclassman. However, he often sacrifices the use of his arm to defeat opponents and lead his team to the National Tennis Tournament. In addition to appearing in the series other media, including musicals, films, and soundtracks, different types of merchandise have been released in his likeness, including figurines and jewelry.

Tezuka&#x27;s character has been well received by readers since his introduction, having ranked in the top five most popular characters in every &quot;Shonen Jump&quot; character popularity poll of series. He has also remained in the top 10 annual Valentine Chocolate Recipient rankings that Takeshi Konomi releases in the manga, in which readers mail in who they want to send chocolate. However, in publications on manga and anime, his character has received mixed reviews. Reviewers comment on his lack of originality and that the impossibility of one of his techniques is part of why the story seems unrealistic. Though one reviewer questions his likability as a protagonist, his personality is praised, with one praising his devotion as one of the highlights of the series, and another commenting that he is a good captain who properly motivates the main character.

== Character outline ==

=== Background ===
Parts of Tezuka&#x27;s history are revealed throughout several flashbacks in the story. Three years prior, when he was still a relatively unknown tennis player, Tezuka easily defeated the Junior Tennis Tournament&#x27;s runner-up, Genichiro Sanada, and played evenly against the champion, Seiichi Yukimura. Upon his entrance into Seishun Academy nearly a year later, Tezuka was already a better tennis player than most of his upperclassman. However, when his teammates found out that he is left-handed even though he played against them with his right, they viewed him as arrogant, leading to a jealous teammate injuring his left arm. Despite having made a promise to Shuichiro Oishi that he would lead Seigaku to the Nationals, Tezuka decided to quit the tennis club because he did not want to be on the same team with people who used their racquets to hurt others. Nonetheless, his skills were recognized by then-captain Yūdai Yamato, who wanted Tezuka to become Seigaku&#x27;s &quot;pillar of support&quot;, and entrusted him with the dream of going to the Nationals, which convinced Tezuka to stay.

During that same year, Shusuke Fuji defeated Tezuka in a private tennis match, but Fuji was displeased with the outcome after learning about Tezuka&#x27;s injury, promising to play him again after his arm heals. Over time, Tezuka secured a regular spot on the team despite being a first-year. By his second year, he became the team&#x27;s vice-captain and defeated Hyotei Academy&#x27;s captain during a tournament. Despite not being at full strength due to his injury leading to chronic problems, and his sealing of a powerful technique that required the use of his left arm, Tezuka eventually became known as a National-level tennis player. He was invited to an elite tennis training camp, but due to persistent arm pain, he declined the invitation without explanation to the organization.

=== Personality ===
Tezuka&#x27;s personality remains consistent throughout the series as he is always serious about everything he does, especially his duties as captain of the tennis team. Despite being very strict, he is fair and sticks to his word, punishing everyone even if the rules are broken by only a few. He would often make the entire team run laps when they break the rules and one of his trademark phrases is . He is determined to lead his team to the Nationals, which often results in him ignoring his doctor&#x27;s warnings against him playing in arduous tennis matches – considering his health secondary to the team&#x27;s success, and continuing to risk re-injury in his matches to ensure their victory. Tezuka even risks it all during a match against Ryoma since he sees the boy as the one to succeed him as the team&#x27;s new &quot;pillar of support&quot;.

Also, no matter the situation, he is shown to be rather inexpressive, never changing his stoic expression. However, when he re-injures his arm during his match against Keigo Atobe, he is shown to writhe in pain. This becomes a traumatic memory that makes him unable to lift his arm over his shoulders, fearing the thought of feeling that pain again. He learns to overcome this during his medical retreat in Kyūshū. Due to his experiences, he dislikes those who use tennis to harm others.

In the manga series, Tezuka smiles for the first time after his team becomes the National champions, though he instantly reverts when Fuji points out the fact. In the anime series, he also smiles when Oishi&#x27;s uncle tells him his elbow was fully healed, and when he sees Momoshiro&#x27;s potential during a match. His seriousness is compounded by having picked up some character traits from his similarly stern grandfather; ironically, Tezuka looks older than his actual age and is often mistaken as his teammates&#x27; teacher. In the anime, his unyielding attitude even prevents him from showing any reaction when he accidentally drinks Sadaharu Inui&#x27;s vegetable juice, resulting in others believing he is immune to the dreaded concoction. However, he quickly and sternly declines an offer to drink it later on.

=== Tennis style and techniques ===
Portrayed as an all-rounder tennis player, otherwise known as an all-court player, Tezuka can use aspects of every tennis style depending on his needs. His dominant hand is his left hand, though in some parts of the story, he is shown to be capable of executing his techniques with his right hand as well.

One of the reasons why other characters acknowledge Tezuka as a National-level tennis player is his infamous &quot;Zero-Shiki (Degree) Drop shot&quot;. This shot causes the ball to roll away from the opponent and towards the net once it drops on their side of the tennis court (usually landing a foot away from the net), preventing them from hitting the ball again since it does not bounce toward them. He later develops a variation of this technique in the form of a serve called the &quot;Zero-Shiki Serve&quot;. Another one of Tezuka&#x27;s signature techniques is the , a technique which involves him putting enough spin on the ball in order to force nearly all hits to be &quot;sucked&quot; into his hit zone, making it unnecessary for him to move around the court. He is also able to use this technique so as to make the ball go out of bounds rather than toward him, with this being dubbed the &quot;Tezuka Phantom&quot;. However, in order to do this, Tezuka must create an even greater spin on the ball, which can result in Tezuka re-injuring his arm or being permanently sidelined if he uses it consecutively.

Tezuka has also opened all three doors of , which is a technique in the series that can only be achieved when a tennis player reached and surpasses his limits. Tezuka&#x27;s Tezuka Zone allows him to focus the effects of one of Muga&#x27;s doors, , into his left arm, preventing the loss of stamina, and giving him the ability to return balls with twice the strength, or spin, that they were hit with. The is another one of Muga&#x27;s doors, and it focuses the power of one&#x27;s mind, giving him a form of foresight during the game. He shows that he has opened the final door, Teni Muho No Kiwami, during a match in the Japanese U-17 camp.

== Plot overview ==

As the captain of Seishun Academy&#x27;s tennis club, Tezuka is the one to give Ryoma a chance to become a regular on the team. Despite being known as Seigaku&#x27;s &quot;strongest man&quot;, he initially remains on the sidelines during tournaments as another teammate sometimes plays his position or their opponent is defeated too early. Though he secretly challenges and defeats Ryoma in an unofficial match, his true skills are first shown during a match against Sadaharu Inui. During the Kanto tournament first-round match against Hyotei&#x27;s captain, Keigo Atobe, the pain from an old arm injury returns, and though he refuses to give up, the game ends with Atobe&#x27;s win. In order to receive medical treatment for his injuries, Tezuka goes to Kyūshū (he goes to Germany in the anime). He returns right before the National Tournament, where he unseals a technique that he used to use before his injury to defeat Higa Junior High&#x27;s captain, Eishiro Kite, in the first match, and then goes on to defeat Hyotei Academy&#x27;s Munehiro Kabaji in his next match. In the semi-finals, Tezuka plays one-on-one against Shitenhoji&#x27;s Senri Chitose despite it being a doubles match, and after unveiling two new techniques, Tezuka emerges victorious.

Before his match against Rikkai Junior High&#x27;s Genichiro Sanada, Tezuka tells Oishi that this will be his last tournament in Japan since he plans to go to Germany in order to become a professional tennis player. During his match, Tezuka develops a variation of one of his techniques, however, the combination of this technique and a strenuous serve, damages Tezuka&#x27;s arm, creating a weakness which Sanada soon uses to his advantage, and results in the latter&#x27;s victory. Though he lost, Ryoma&#x27;s win against Rikkai&#x27;s captain results in Tezuka finally achieving his goal of turning Seigaku into the National champions. Several months later, Tezuka becomes one of fifty middle school students invited to an elite training camp for the Japanese Under-17 tennis team. After defeating Seigaku&#x27;s former captain, Yūdai Yamato, in a ranking match, during which he&#x27;s shown to have completely mastered Muga no Kyochi, he realizes that he has achieved everything he has set out to do and resolves to leave for Germany.

== Appearances in other media ==

In addition to his original appearance in the manga, Tezuka has appeared in all of the series&#x27; adaptations and other media, including the anime, films, radio shows, musicals, video games, and many others. In the anime series, the timeline of certain events sometimes differ from the manga, as well as the places mentioned; in the anime, Tezuka goes to Germany for medical treatment rather than to Kyūshū. In addition, there are original events included in the anime, like Tezuka attending the Junior Senbatsu tennis training camp as a coach, and him winning an Interschool Ranking match against Fuji. In the OVA, &quot;A Day on Survival Mountain&quot;, when the Seigaku team travels to a tennis resort and encounters cocky, college tennis players, Tezuka ends up defeating the team&#x27;s arrogant coach in a match.

In &quot;The Prince of Tennis&quot; musicals, also known as Tenimyu, the events of the series are reenacted via various musical performances, in which the characters&#x27; traits are often parodied; the actor, in character, often has to point out in mid-performance that he is, in fact, only fourteen years of age. Tezuka is portrayed by several actors in the musical, including Eiji Takigawa, Yuu Shirota, Keisuke Minami, Daisuke Watanabe, Ryouma Baba, Takuma Wada, Hideya Tawada, and Takuma Zaiki.

As a member of the central tennis team in the series, Tezuka is featured in several of the anime&#x27;s soundtracks, as well as spawning a few character CDs featuring only his character. Also, since he is one of the few characters in the series who wear glasses, he, along with Sadaharu Inui and Yuushi Oshitari, is part of the ; character CDs focusing solely on the trio have been released.

Tezuka also appears in both the animated and live-action films. In the animated film, &quot;The Prince of Tennis: Futari no Samurai&quot;, his team is invited to a cruise trip where they are forced to play in rigged tennis matches. Initially, Tezuka was supposed to play against Ryoga Echizen, but plays and wins against a different person in order to let Ryoma play against Ryoga. In &quot;The Prince of Tennis&quot; live action film, the story follows the events that lead to Seigaku playing against Hyotei, and Tezuka is portrayed by Yuu Shirota.

== Reception ==
In every &quot;Shonen Jump&quot; character popularity poll of series, Tezuka has remained in the top five most popular characters; besides the first poll, where he came in fifth place, he has remained in the fourth spot since the second poll in 2002. In addition, in the annual Valentine Chocolate Recipient rankings Takeshi Konomi releases in the manga, Tezuka received the second largest number of chocolates in the 2001 rankings. However, since then, his rank has continued to decline; the following year, he took the fifth spot. in 2004, he slipped down a rank to sixth; and in 2005, his rank slipped to eighth place. During another one of Konomi&#x27;s manga segments, in which fans were to send postcards in order to have their name listed as one of Tezuka&#x27;s classmates, the replies were so overwhelming that the results had to be postponed for another volume. Also, in the &quot;Prince of Tennis Character Book 40.5&quot;, though Konomi comments that Tezuka is the character who is most unlike himself, he states that Tezuka would be the character he would pick to play doubles with, as well as want to be able to use his signature moves: Tezuka Zone and Tezuka Phantom. Various types of merchandise have been released in his likeness, including figurines, key chains, and jewelry.

In publications focused on manga and anime reviews, Tezuka&#x27;s character has received mixed reviews. First off, one of his techniques is negatively reviewed, with John Sinnott of DVD Talk seeing it as one of the reasons why the story is &quot;idiotic&quot;. Also, Chris Beveridge and Jarred Pine, reviewers from an entertainment website called Mania, both see him as unoriginal, with Chris describing him as one of the series&#x27; archetypes, more precisely as the &quot;serious prodigy...who will change the face of tennis,&quot; and Jarred calling him a &quot;cookie-cutter character&quot;. However, Chris also comments that since Tezuka takes his duties seriously, he is a good captain and is able to motivate the main character, Ryoma, in the right direction. Holly Ellingwood of ACTIVE Anime, an anime news and reviews site, praises his personality, citing that his willingness to sacrifice his arm for his team in the manga&#x27;s seventeenth volume is a &quot;noble action and higher deed&quot;, and is one of the reasons why this manga is at the top of its genre. In another review of volume 17, one of Mangalife&#x27;s reviewers, Michael Aronson, has a more negative comment, stating that he &quot;comes off looking more passive and stiff in contrast [to Keigo Atobe]&quot;, and despite his revealed backstory, he is held back from being a likable protagonist because he remains a mystery to readers.

<doc id="804848" wikidata="Q957441" url="?curid=804848" title="Ivan the Great Bell Tower">
<text>The Ivan the Great Bell Tower () is a church tower inside the Moscow Kremlin complex. With a total height of , it is the tallest tower and structure of the Kremlin. It was built in 1508 on Cathedral Square for the three Russian Orthodox cathedrals, namely the Assumption (closest to the tower), the Archangel and the Annunciation, which do not have their own belfries. It serves as a part of Moscow Kremlin Museums.

==History==
From 1329, Moscow&#x27;s first stone bell tower stood on this site, affiliated with the Church of St. Ivan of the Ladder-under-the Bell, hence the name &quot;Ivan&quot; in the title. This church was erected by Grand Duke Ivan Kalita, and was one of the first to be built in Moscow out of stone, rather than wood. During Grand Duke Ivan III’s major renovation of the Kremlin, he hired an Italian architect to replace this church. Construction was begun in 1505, the year of Ivan’s death, and was completed three years later under his son Vasily III. Vasilly also ordered that a new and unprecedentedly large tower be erected on the foundations of the old tower as a monument to honour his father.

The new bell tower, completed in 1508, originally had two belfries on different levels and a height of around 60 meters. Because of its height, the tower also served as an observation point against fires and the approach of enemies.

There&#x27;s a popular yet disputable legend, that when Napoleon captured Moscow in 1812 after the Battle of Borodino, he heard that the cross on the central dome of the Annunciation Cathedral had been cast in solid gold, and immediately gave orders that it should be taken down. But he confused the cathedral with the Ivan the Great Bell Tower, which only had a gilded iron cross. This cross resisted all attempts of French equipment and engineers to remove it from the tower. It was only after a Russian peasant volunteered to climb up to the dome that the cross was lowered on a rope. When he went up to Napoleon seeking a reward, the latter had him shot out of hand as a traitor to his fatherland.

==Architecture==
The Ivan the Great Bell Tower is an ensemble with three components. All of the buildings are made of brick, and are whitewashed in accord with the neighboring buildings of Cathedral Square.

==Bells==
The Ivan the Great Bell Tower today contains 22 bells. Of these, 18 small bells hang in the base and in the middle of the bell tower.

<text>Clocker, for clock, galvanic skin response sensor and digital delay system, is a minimalist electronic music piece by Alvin Lucier conceived in 1978, though Lucier felt there did not exist an appropriate digital delay system till 1988: &quot;With this new equipment, the sounds of the delayed clock now matched those of the original, creating clear copies and with them a more convincing illusion of time expanding and contracting. Later I added a bank of fixed delays which, as they splay out from the voltage controlled delay, create multiple reflections that almost convince the listener that the room is changing size.&quot;

What was played through the digital delay system, a Digitech RDS 7.6 with a continuously variable voltage control output, was the sounds of a clock, a Westclox Silver Bell Monogram, ticking, with the delay controlled by a galvanic skin response sensor (GSR). The GSR, by sending a small current through the body, reads minute differences in skin resistance which in turn is influenced by the performers thoughts and emotions: &quot;I had wanted to make a work in which a performer could speed up and slow down time, stopping it, if possible, simply by thinking.&quot;

The 1991 release was recorded in a stone room twenty foot square and thirty feet high. Six small loudspeakers where placed about the room aimed at various walls to create acoustic delays. Collins then routed the audio through different combinations of speakers according to a score written by Lucier, apparently for the occasion, in 1991.

Lucier notes a synchronistic event, his reading of &quot;If on a winter&#x27;s night a traveler&quot; by Calvino: &quot;What I would like most in the world...is to make clocks run backward...No, with thought, by concentrating until I force time to move back...polydyptic theatre, in which about sixty little mirrors lining the inside of a large box transform a bough into a forest, a lead soldier into an army, a booklet into a library.&quot;

<doc id="804878" wikidata="Q334844" url="?curid=804878" title="Driving Rain">
<text>Driving Rain is the twelfth solo studio album by English musician Paul McCartney, released on 12 November 2001 as a double LP, a single cassette, and single CD.

==Background==
Following the example of &quot;Run Devil Run&quot; brisk production schedule, &quot;Driving Rain&quot; – except for two songs – was cut with David Kahne producing in two weeks, starting in February 2001. McCartney used musicians who were scheduled to back him on tour.

==Album cover==
The cover of the album features a photograph taken with a Casio wristwatch containing a built-in camera.

==Music and lyrics==
&quot;Back in the Sunshine Again&quot; was co-written by McCartney and his son James. On 11 September 2001, McCartney was sitting on a plane in New York City when the terrorist attacks occurred, and was able to witness the events from his seat. Incensed at the tragedy and determined to respond, he composed &quot;Freedom&quot; and helped organise The Concert for New York City, a large all-star show at Madison Square Garden on 20 October.

The songs &quot;About You&quot; and &quot;Heather&quot; were written for his then wife Heather Mills, as thanks for helping McCartney grieve the death of his first wife, Linda.

==Release and reception==

In November 2001, &quot;Driving Rain&quot; was released to generally strong reviews but stunned many with its very low sales. The album sold 66,000 copies in its first week in the US. &quot;Driving Rain&quot; peaked at number 46 in the UK, and became McCartney&#x27;s lowest-selling album in his homeland. The US reaction was a little stronger, with the album peaking at number 26 and being certified Gold by the RIAA.

McCartney halted the pressing of &quot;Driving Rain&quot; so that &quot;Freedom&quot; could appear as a hidden track (since the artwork had already been printed). The just-released &quot;From a Lover to a Friend&quot; (which only reached number 45 in the UK) was repackaged with &quot;Freedom&quot;, although the single failed to re-chart.

Reviewing the album for &quot;Uncut&quot; magazine, Ian MacDonald commented on McCartney&#x27;s spontaneous approach to its recording, saying that &quot;In parts (for example, the lengthy closer &#x27;Rinse The Raindrops&#x27;), the results are almost ferocious, coming as close to a McCartney-esque Tin Machine as one could reasonably imagine.&quot; MacDonald considered the more &quot;polished and produced&quot; tracks to be &quot;the most successful&quot;, however, and concluded: &quot;Possibly a grower, this album is certainly better than anything Macca&#x27;s done for some while, if not the late masterpiece some of us have been hoping for.&quot; Fox News commentator Roger Friedman remarked that the chorus of the song &quot;Tiny Bubble&quot; is &quot;remarkably&quot; similar to &quot;Piggies&quot;, written by George Harrison and released on the Beatles&#x27; 1968 self-titled double album (also known as the &quot;White Album&quot;).

McCartney opened his tour in support of the album in April 2002. Titled the Driving USA tour, it was a commercial success, with extensions being added to the itinerary around the world. Four of the album&#x27;s sixteen songs were performed: &quot;Lonely Road,&quot; &quot;Your Loving Flame,&quot; &quot;Freedom&quot; and the title track. &quot;From a Lover to a Friend&quot; was also performed at the Concert for New York City on October 20, 2001.

iTunes exclusive track
#:* &quot;In 2007, upon adding McCartney&#x27;s catalogue of music, the iTunes Store added one of David Kahne&#x27;s two remixes of the song &quot;From a Lover to a Friend&quot; as an exclusive bonus track. This remix is the version released on CD-singles for this song and &quot;Freedom&quot;&quot;.

<text>Fun Factory is a German eurodance group formed in 1992, originally consisting of founding members Balca Tözün, Rodney Hardison, Toni Cottura and Stephan Browarczyk. They have been nicknamed simply Balja, Rod D., Smooth T. and Steve. The group enjoyed success throughout the &#x27;90s.

==Band history==

===1992–94: Formation, &quot;Non Stop-The Album&quot; and Balca&#x27;s departure===
The group was founded in 1992 with Balca Tözün from Turkey, Rodney Hardison from America, and Toni Cottura and Stephan Browarczyk from Germany. They released their first singles &quot;Fun Factory&#x27;s Theme&quot; and &quot;Groove Me&quot; in 1992 and 1993. Fun Factory released their debut album &quot;Nonstop! The Album&quot; in 1994. Before their third single release &quot;Close to You&quot; in late 1993, the group reported that lead singer Balca Tözün had been replaced with Marie-Anett Mey, an entertainer from Paris, France. &quot;Close to You&quot; became their first chart success, peaking at number 1 on the Canadian Dance chart. Follow-up singles were &quot;Take Your Chance&quot; and &quot;Pain&quot;, which peaked at 18 and 24 respectively on the German Singles Chart.

===1995–97: &quot;Fun-Tastic&quot; and disbandment===
In 1995, the band released their singles &quot;I Wanna B with U&quot;, &quot;Celebration&quot; and the Manfred Mann cover version &quot;Do Wah Diddy&quot;. They were all chart hits, peaking at nos. 11, 12 and 6 on the German Singles Charts. The same year, Fun Factory released their second Studio Album &quot;Fun-Tastic&quot;. By this time they began to become more popular throughout Europe, the United States, and Canada. The follow-up single release was &quot;Don&#x27;t Go Away&quot;, becoming their last chart success. Following the release of &quot;Don&#x27;t Go Away&quot;, Cottura left the band. As a trio, the group released two more singles, &quot;I Love You&quot; and &quot;Oh Yeah Yeah (I Like It)&quot;. For the single version of &quot;I Love You&quot;, the first rap verse by Cottura was re-recorded by Browarczyk. In 1996, Cottura started releasing solo singles and founded the record label Booya Family, where he produced tracks for a variety of artists including NANA, Marky Mark, &#x27;N Sync, and Backstreet Boys. In 1997, a Fun Factory &quot;Greatest Hits&quot; album was released. Hardison left Fun Factory in 1997; the remaining two members Mey and Browarczyk were joined by the new member Ray Horton and planned to continue with a rebranded band name &quot;Fun Affairs&quot;, but saw little success and Fun Factory split up.

===1998–08: Solo projects and Fun Factory spin-offs===

In 1998, a Fun Factory spin-off was introduced with an all-new line-up, with rotating members, first comprising singer Lian Ross (Josephine Hiebel), rappers T-Roc/Tiger One (Terrance Lamont Croom), Alfonso Losa-Eser and Alexander Walser from Liechtenstein. On some of their releases they have been credited as &quot;The New Fun Factory&quot;. The first studio album &quot;Next Generation&quot;, published on Marlboro Records, was released in 1999 and sold over 100,000 copies, along with the singles &quot;Party With Fun Factory&quot;, &quot;Sha-La-La-La-La&quot; and &quot;Wish&quot; in 1998 and 1999. In 2000, Mey released her first and only solo single, &quot;Be the One&quot;. In 2002, New Fun Factory&#x27;s studio album &quot;ABC of Music&quot;, saw moderate success and the group was soon dissolved. In 2008, a group with all new members, credited under the Fun Factory brand released their first single titled &quot;Be Good To Me&quot;. They performed at ZDF Fernsehgarten and toured in Germany, Poland, Slovakia and Romania. Two more singles, &quot;I Wanna B With U 2010&quot;, a cover version of the original, and &quot;On Top Of The World&quot;, were released in 2009 and 2013 respectively.

===2009–14: Return of Balca and comeback===
In December 2009, a promotional single titled &quot;Shut Up&quot; was released, which marked the first song since 1995 where founding members Cottura and Tözün were involved. In 2013, three of four founding members, Tözün, Cottura and Browarczyk, reunited for performances. They were joined by new rapper Ski (Anthony Freeman) from New York City. They gave their first full concert, credited as &#x27;The Originalz FF Members of Fun Factory&#x27;, in Poland on October 26, 2013, where they also presented the new song &quot;Hands Up (Give Me Your Heart)&quot;. In 2014, the group began performing as Fun Factory again.

===2015–2021: &quot;Back to the Factory&quot; and transition to S.T.S.B.===
On August 7, 2015, the single &quot;Let&#x27;s Get Crunk&quot; was released. On July 15, 2016, &quot;Turn It Up&quot; was released, followed by the group&#x27;s third studio album, &quot;Back to the Factory&quot;, in August. In February 2021, the group released &quot;Memories&quot;, which went on to be their last single. In July 2021, the band announced they were leaving the project and a cast for the new members was following. Balja, Toni, Steve and Anthony still perform together under &quot;S.T.S.B. fka Fun Factory&quot;.

===2023-present: The return of New Fun Factory members===
After over a year of inactivity, Fun Factory resurfaced with a new line up of Douglas, DGS, and Jasmin, the former two being former members of the New Fun Factory project that was active during Fun Factory&#x27;s first hiatus. In July 2023, the group released their newest single, &quot;Uh La La&quot;.

<text>Nicolas Jacques André Hulot (; born 30 April 1955) is a French journalist and environmental activist. He is the founder and honorary president of the Nicolas Hulot Foundation, an environmental group established in 1990.

Hulot ran as a candidate in the primary for the Europe Ecology – The Greens (EELV) party in 2011, but lost to Eva Joly in the second round. He declined offers to be a government minister for Jacques Chirac, Nicolas Sarkozy and François Hollande, but in May 2017, he agreed to serve under Emmanuel Macron and was appointed Minister of Ecological and Solidary Transition in the first government of Prime Minister Édouard Philippe. In August 2018, he announced his resignation from the Second Philippe government, citing policy disagreements and leadership issues.

Hulot is an officer in the Legion of Honour and a knight in the Ordre des Arts et des Lettres. In 2021, he announced his retirement from public life in response to a documentary outlining a series of sexual assault allegations against him.

== Early life ==

Hulot was born 30 April 1955 in Lille to Monique Marguerite Marie Hulot (née Moulun), a pharmaceutical sales representative, and Philippe Marie Joseph Hulot, a gold miner in Venezuela. Hulot had one brother, Gonzaga, and a sister, Beatrice.

Hulot&#x27;s father Philippe died when Hulot was fifteen years old. Gonzaga Hulot committed suicide on 24 December 1974 when Hulot was 19 years old.

Hulot took up rallying as a hobby when he was growing up and took part in the 1980 Dakar Rally, though he didn&#x27;t finish the race due to difficulties with his vehicle.

== Early career ==
From 1973 to 1978, Hulot worked as an agency photographer for Sipa Press where he documented the 1976 Guatemala earthquake and interviewed Ian Smith during the Rhodesian Bush War.

Hulot left Sipa Press in 1978 to move to France Inter after being offered work as a radio journalist and producer. Hulot debuted on television during the children&#x27;s program &quot;Les Visiteurs du mercredi.&quot; Hulot also presented the short-lived educational programme &quot;Les Pieds au mur.&quot; Following this, Hulot became an evening reporter focusing on motorcycle events. Hulot left France Inter in 1987.

Hulot presented the television programme, &quot;Ushuaïa, le magazine de l&#x27;extrême&quot; which was focused around extreme sport and natural landscapes throughout the world. The programme was broadcast on TF1 and was co-produced by Hulot&#x27;s then-girlfriend Dominique Cantien. &quot;Ushuaïa, le magazine de l&#x27;extrême&quot; made Hulot a household name in France. &quot;Ushuaïa, le magazine de l&#x27;extrême&quot; ran from 1987 to 1995. Hulot went on to present Opération Okavango (1996–1997) and &quot;Ushuaïa Nature&quot; (1998–2012). Hulot&#x27;s contract with TF1 ended in December 2011 though four of the remaining &quot;Ushuaïa Nature&quot; episodes aired in 2012.

== Fondation Nicolas Hulot ==
In 1990, Hulot founded the &quot;Ushuaia Foundation&quot; which became La Fondation Nicolas-Hulot pour la nature et l&#x27;homme in 1995 and which changed its name to La Fondation pour la nature et l&#x27;homme (The Foundation for Nature and Mankind) in April 2011.

Hulot and Gérard Feldzer, a former French airline pilot, experimented with airship prototypes originally developed by Didier Costes in 1992, and in 1993, the pair attempted to cross the Atlantic Ocean from Spain using an airship with pedals. The pair made it as far as 1,500 km before failing near the Cape Verde Islands.

Hulot set up partnerships for the Foundation with companies such as EDF, L&#x27;Oréal and TF1. In 2006, the National Museum of Natural History formed a partnership with &quot;La Fondation pour la nature et l&#x27;homme&quot;, organising annual events to bring people together to combat climate change.

In 2013, the foundation launched a think tank based around ecology.

== Political activities ==

In 2007, Nicolas Hulot told candidates in the presidential election that he would stand as a candidate if ecology were not one of the main themes of the election. Some polls estimated his support at around 15%. In response to his announcement, five of the twelve candidates in the election, including Nicolas Sarkozy, signed his &quot;Pacte écologique&quot; (ecology pact), stating that ecological issues would be central to all future political decisions.

=== 2011 Europe Écologie-Les Verts primary ===
On 13 April 2011, while speaking in Sevran, Seine-Saint-Denis, Nicolas Hulot announced his candidacy in the Europe Écologie-Les Verts primary for the 2012 French presidential election. The announcement came a month after Hulot&#x27;s calls for a referendum on nuclear energy following the Fukushima nuclear accident. Hulot was invited to a televised interview on the &quot;France Inter&quot; show &quot;7/9&quot; by Bruno Duvic.

Before the first round of the primary, some polls put Hulot ahead of Eva Joly, but he finally finished second with 40.22%, behind Joly with 49.75%. Hulot lost during the second round and Joly became the Europe Ecologie-Les Verts candidate.

For the French presidential election of 2012, Nicolas Hulot stated that he had voted for the Left Front&#x27;s candidate, Jean-Luc Mélenchon, during the first round. He said he found Melenchon more efficient on environmental issues than Joly. He supported François Hollande in the second round.

=== Minister for the Ecological and Inclusive Transition ===

On 17 May 2017, he was appointed Minister for the Ecological and Inclusive Transition. This is following Hulot turning down offers for ministerial positions from Jacques Chirac, Nicolas Sarkozy and François Hollande&#x27;s governments. The position&#x27;s responsibilities are focused around climate, air pollution, energy and transport. (The latter being done in collaboration with Transport minister, Élisabeth Borne.)

On 24 June 2017, he joined Emmanuel Macron in calling for the adoption of a Global Pact for the Environment along with public figures such as Laurent Fabius, Anne Hidalgo, Arnold Schwarzenegger, and Ban Ki-moon.

On 6 July 2017, Hulot announced the government&#x27;s five-year plan to outlaw all petrol and diesel vehicles by 2040. The plan would also attempt to make France carbon-neutral by 2050. Financial incentives would be offered to people who try to look for cleaner alternatives. This followed a proposal by Norway to ban all petrol and diesel vehicle sales by 2025.

On 10 July 2017, Hulot said on RTL Radio that France may close up to 17 nuclear reactors by 2025 in a new plan to reduce its share of nuclear power. Liberal think-tank Institut Montaigne released a report stating that the plan to convert from nuclear energy to wind and solar will cost €217 billion by 2035. In 2016, France&#x27;s Court of Audit estimated that prolonging the lifespan of France&#x27;s nuclear reactors would cost €100 billion. France currently derives 75 percent of its electricity from nuclear power.

In December 2017, to combat global warming, France adopted a law banning new fossil fuel exploitation projects and closing current ones by 2040 in all of its territories, becoming the first country to schedule the end of fossil fuel exploitation.

On 28 August 2018, Hulot resigned as Minister of Ecology during a live interview on France Inter radio, citing President Emmanuel Macron&#x27;s record on environmental issues and his own frustration over feeling alone in prioritising reform. He said that his time in office had been an &quot;accumulation of disappointments&quot;, and that he did not want to &quot;create the illusion that we&#x27;re facing up to these challenges&quot;. &quot;The Guardian&quot; wrote that &quot;Hulot&#x27;s departure is a major blow to Macron and calls into question the president&#x27;s credibility on the environment&quot;.

Nicolas Hulot received the title of Doctor Honoris Causa from the University of Mons in 2019.

== Assessment ==
Hulot has been criticised by some commentators, like &quot;Le Canard enchaîné&quot; and supporters of uneconomic growth and political ecology, who have criticised his use of the media and acceptance of funds from large firms, like EDF, L&#x27;Oréal and Rhône-Poulenc.

== Personal life ==
Hulot was in a relationship with Dominique Cantien, the TF1 director. Hulot married world champion rock-climber Isabelle Patissier in Saint-Malo on 2 September 1993. Hulot and Patissier divorced on 9 April 1996. Hulot remarried in Viens on 2 October 2002 to Florence Lasserre, a former municipal councillor and mother to his two sons.

In 2017, Hulot declared a personal wealth of over €7 million and stated he owned six cars.

=== Sexual assault allegations ===
In February 2018, French magazine &quot;&quot; reported that Hulot had been accused of sexual assault, related to events that took place in the 1990s. The accuser was later reported to be Pascale Mitterrand, granddaughter of former President François Mitterrand. Mitterrand had filed a police report in 2008, but no judicial charges were laid because the statute of limitations had run out.

In 2021, French investigative news show &quot;Envoyé spécial&quot; announced that it would be releasing a documentary in which a further six women accused Hulot of assaulting them. Before the broadcast of the documentary, Hulot appeared on BFM TV to deny the allegations and to announce that he would be retiring from public life. The documentary was screened, in which four women detailed their allegations, and subsequently reported.

<text>Magahi (), also known as Magadhi (), is a Indo-Aryan language spoken in Bihar, Jharkhand and West Bengal states of eastern India, and in the Terai of Nepal. Magadhi Prakrit was the ancestor of Magahi, from which the latter&#x27;s name derives.

It has a very rich and old tradition of folk songs and stories. It is spoken in approx eleven districts of Bihar (Gaya, Bhagalpur, Patna, Jehanabad, Aurangabad, Nalanda, Sheikhpura, Nawada, Lakhisarai, Arwal, Jamui), eight districts of Jharkhand (Hazaribag, Palamu, Chatra, Koderma, Jamtara, Bokaro, Dhanbad, Giridih) and in West Bengal&#x27;s Malda district. There are around 20,700,000 speakers of Magahi, including 12 million Magahi speakers and 8 million Khortha speakers, which is considered a dialect of Magahi.

Magahi derived from the ancient Magadhi Prakrit, which was created in the ancient kingdom of Magadha, the core of which was the area south of the Ganges and east of Son River.

Though the number of speakers in Magahi is about 12.7 million, it has not been constitutionally recognised in India. In Bihar, Hindi is the language used for educational and official matters. Magahi was legally absorbed under Hindi in the 1961 Census.

==History==
The ancestor of Magahi, Magadhi Prakrit, formed in the Indian subcontinent. These regions were part of the ancient kingdom of Magadha, the core of which was the area of Bihar south of the river Ganga.

The name &quot;Magahi&quot; is directly derived from the word Magadhi.

The development of the Magahi language into its current form is unknown. However, linguists have concluded that Magahi along with Assamese, Bengali, Bhojpuri, Maithili and Oriya originated from the Magadhi Prakrit during the 8th to 11th centuries. These different but sister dialects differentiated themselves and took their own course of growth and development. But it is not certain when exactly it took place. It was probably such an unidentified period during which modern Indian languages begin to take modern shape. By the end of the 12th century, the development of Apabhramsa reached its climax. Gujarati, Marathi, Bengali, Bhojpuri, Assamese, Oriya, Maithili and other modern languages took definite shape in their literary writings in the beginning of the 14th century. The distinct shape of Magadhi can be seen in the &quot;Dohakosha&quot; written by Sarahapa and Kauhapa.

Magadhi had a setback due to the transition period of the Magadha administration. Traditionally, strolling bards recite long epic poems in this dialect, and it was because of this that the word &quot;Magadhi&quot; came to mean &quot;a bard&quot;. Devanagari is the most widely used script in present times, while Bengali and Odia scripts are also used in some regions and Magahi&#x27;s old script was Kaithi script. The pronunciation in Magahi is not as broad as in Maithili and there are a number of verbal forms for each person. Historically, Magahi had no famous written literature. There are many popular songs throughout the area in which the language is spoken, and strolling bards recite various long epic poems which are known more or less over the whole of Northern India. In Magahi speaking area, folk singers sing a good number of ballads. The introduction of Urdu meant a setback to local languages as its Persian script was alien to local people.

The first success in spreading Hindi occurred in Bihar in 1881, when Hindi displaced Urdu as the official language of the province. After independence, Hindi was given the sole official status through the Bihar Official Language Act, 1950 ignoring the state&#x27;s own languages.

==Speakers of Magahi==
There are several dialects of Magahi. It is spoken in the area which formed the core of the ancient kingdom of Magadha - the modern districts of Patna, Nalanda, Gaya, Jehanabad, Arwal, Aurangabad, Lakhisarai, Sheikhpura and Nawada. Magahi is bounded on the north by the various forms of Maithili spoken in Mithila across the Ganga. On the west it is bounded by the Bhojpuri, On the northeast it is bounded by Angika. A blend of Magahi known as Khortha is spoken by non-tribal populace in North Chotanagpur division of Jharkhand which comprises districts of Bokaro, Chatra, Dhanbad, Giridih, Hazaribagh, Koderma and Ramgarh. People of Southern Bihar and Northern Jharkhand are mostly speakers of Magahi. Magahi is also spoken in Malda district of West Bengal. According to 2011 Census, there were approximately 12.7 million Magahi speakers. Apart from India it is spoken in various districts of south eastern Nepal.

<doc id="804939" wikidata="Q6417941" url="?curid=804939" title="Kitbashing">
<text>Kitbashing or model bashing is the practice of making a new scale model by taking pieces out of kits. These pieces may be added to a custom project or to another kit. For professional modelmakers, kitbashing is used to create concept models for detailing movie special effects. Commercial model kits are a ready source of &quot;detailing&quot;, providing any number of identical, mass-produced components that can be used to add fine detail to an existing model. Professionals often kitbash to build prototype parts which are then recreated with lightweight materials.

== Purposes, history, and methods ==
For the hobbyist, kitbashing saves time that would be spent scratch building an entire model. Hobbyists may kitbash to create a model of a subject (real or imaginary) for which there is not a commercial kit.

Although it has a long history, kitbashing came to the attention of a wider public via the fine modelwork seen in TV series such as &quot;Thunderbirds, Star Trek&quot; and the films &quot;2001: A Space Odyssey&quot; and &quot;Star Wars Episode IV: A New Hope&quot;. Many of the spaceship models created for these programs incorporated details from tank, speedboat and car kits. Another example is the Batmobile from the 2005 film &quot;Batman Begins&quot;, as seen in the special features disc of the film&#x27;s DVD.

It is not uncommon for parts to be cut and filed into shapes leaving gaps that are later filled with putty to hide defects. Textural details known as greebles may be added to enhance a model.

Sometimes, kitbashing has been used to create works of art. The Toronto sculptor Kim Adams has used HO gauge freight cars, containers, detail parts, figures and scenery to create artistic landscapes. American artist Kris Kuksi also uses kitbashing to detail his maximalist sculptures.

== Genres ==
A popular venue for kitbashing is diecast emergency vehicles such as fire apparatuses. Kitbashers often use models from manufacturers such as Code 3 and Corgi. The kitbash in such cases can be as simple as painting or redecaling a model, or as complex as tearing the model down and adding scratch-built components, followed by custom decals.

An important aspect of kitbashing in model railroading is the reconfiguration of structure kits, most often to fit the geometry of a specific space. Walls can be shortened or lengthened, and corner angles can be changed, to fit a given location on the layout. Another application is to use the wall parts to create a &quot;flat&quot;, or shallow relief model to be displayed against the backdrop. In this configuration the parts for the rear wall of a structure, often an industrial building, can instead be abutted to the front to double the length of the building. Plain sheet styrene or other material is typically added to the rear to strengthen the resulting model.

In model rocketry, kitbashing refers simply to using the pieces from one kit to build a different model. This is typically used to create unusual or especially complex models.

With radio-controlled aircraft, such kitbashing can be done to kitted aircraft as they are being built, or, more often, to so-called &quot;almost-ready-to-fly&quot; (ARF) aircraft to change their appearance or flight characteristics to suit the owner. This can even extend to &quot;plans-bashing&quot;, where a plans-built model has its construction plans partially re-drawn by the builder, either by hand or with computer-aided design software before any part of the model&#x27;s airframe has been fabricated from raw materials.

<text>Dehumanization is the denial of full humanity in others along with the cruelty and suffering that accompany it. A practical definition refers to it as the viewing and the treatment of other people as though they lack the mental capacities that are commonly attributed to humans. In this definition, every act or thought that regards a person as &quot;less than&quot; human is dehumanization.

Dehumanization is one form of incitement to genocide. It has also been used to justify war, judicial and extrajudicial killing, slavery, the confiscation of property, denial of suffrage and other rights, and to attack enemies or political opponents.

Behaviorally, dehumanization describes a disposition towards others that debases the others&#x27; individuality by either portraying it as an &quot;individual&quot; species or by portraying it as an &quot;individual&quot; object (e.g., someone who acts inhumanely towards humans). As a process, dehumanization may be understood as the opposite of personification, a figure of speech in which inanimate objects or abstractions are endowed with human qualities; dehumanization then is the disendowment of these same qualities or a reduction to abstraction.

In almost all contexts, dehumanization is used pejoratively along with a disruption of social norms, with the former applying to the actor(s) of behavioral dehumanization and the latter applying to the action(s) or processes of dehumanization. For instance, there is dehumanization for those who are perceived as lacking in culture or civility, which are concepts that are believed to distinguish humans from animals. Social norms define humane behavior and reflexively define what is outside of humane behavior or inhumane. Dehumanization differs from inhumane behaviors or processes in its breadth to propose competing social norms. It is an action of dehumanization as the old norms are depreciated to the competing new norms, which then redefine the action of dehumanization. If the new norms lose acceptance, then the action remains one of dehumanization. The definition of &quot;dehumanization&quot; remains in a reflexive state of a type-token ambiguity relative to both individual and societal scales.
In biological terms, dehumanization can be described as an introduced species marginalizing the human species, or an introduced person/process that debases other people inhumanely.

In political science and jurisprudence, the act of dehumanization is the inferential alienation of human rights or denaturalization of natural rights, a definition contingent upon presiding international law rather than social norms limited by human geography. In this context, a specialty within species does not need to constitute global citizenship or its inalienable rights; the human genome inherits both.

It is theorized that dehumanization takes on two forms: &quot;animalistic dehumanization&quot;, which is employed on a mostly intergroup basis; and &quot;mechanistic dehumanization&quot;, which is employed on a mostly interpersonal basis. Dehumanization can occur discursively (e.g., idiomatic language that likens individual human beings to non-human animals, verbal abuse, erasing one&#x27;s voice from discourse), symbolically (e.g., imagery), or physically (e.g., chattel slavery, physical abuse, refusing eye contact). Dehumanization often ignores the target&#x27;s individuality (i.e., the creative and exciting aspects of their personality) and can hinder one from feeling empathy or correctly understanding a stigmatized group.

Dehumanization may be carried out by a social institution (such as a state, school, or family), interpersonally, or even within oneself. Dehumanization can be unintentional, especially upon individuals, as with some types of &quot;de facto&quot; racism. State-organized dehumanization has historically been directed against perceived political, racial, ethnic, national, or religious minority groups. Other minoritized and marginalized individuals and groups (based on sexual orientation, gender, disability, class, or some other organizing principle) are also susceptible to various forms of dehumanization. The concept of dehumanization has received empirical attention in the psychological literature. It is conceptually related to infrahumanization, delegitimization, moral exclusion, and objectification. Dehumanization occurs across several domains; it is facilitated by status, power, and social connection; and results in behaviors like exclusion, violence, and support for violence against others.

&quot;Dehumanisation is viewed as a central component to intergroup violence because it is frequently the most important precursor to moral exclusion, the process by which stigmatized groups are placed outside the boundary in which moral values, rules, and considerations of fairness apply.&quot;

David Livingstone Smith, director and founder of The Human Nature Project at the University of New England, argues that historically, human beings have been dehumanizing one another for thousands of years. In his work &quot;The Paradoxes of Dehumanization&quot;, Smith proposes that dehumanization simultaneously regards people as human and subhuman. This paradox comes to light, as Smith identifies, because the reason people are dehumanized is so their human attributes can be taken advantage of.

=== Humanness ===
In Herbert Kelman&#x27;s work on dehumanization, humanness has two features: &quot;identity&quot; (i.e., a perception of the person &quot;as an individual, independent and distinguishable from others, capable of making choices&quot;) and &quot;community&quot; (i.e., a perception of the person as &quot;part of an interconnected network of individuals who care for each other&quot;). When a target&#x27;s agency and embeddedness in a community are denied, they no longer elicit compassion or other moral responses and may suffer violence.

=== Objectification ===
Psychologist Barbara Fredrickson and Tomi-Ann Roberts argued that the sexual objectification of women extends beyond pornography (which emphasizes women&#x27;s bodies over their uniquely human mental and emotional characteristics) to society generally. There is a normative emphasis on female appearance that causes women to take a third-person perspective on their bodies. The psychological distance women may feel from their bodies might cause them to dehumanize themselves. Some research has indicated that women and men exhibit a &quot;sexual body part recognition bias&quot;, in which women&#x27;s sexual body parts are better recognized when presented in isolation than in their entire bodies. In contrast, men&#x27;s sexual body parts are better recognized in the context of their entire bodies than in isolation. Men who dehumanize women as either animals or objects are more liable to rape and sexually harass women and display more negative attitudes toward female rape victims.

Philosopher Martha Nussbaum identified seven components of sexual objectification: , denial of autonomy, , fungibility, violability, ownership, and denial of subjectivity.

In this context, instrumentality refers to when the objectified is used as an instrument to the objectifier&#x27;s benefit. Denial of autonomy occurs in the form of the objectifier underestimating the objectified and denies their capabilities. In the case of inertness, the objectified is treated as if they are lazy and indolent. Fungibility brands the objectified to be easily replaceable. Volability is when the objectifier does not respect the objectified person&#x27;s personal space or boundaries. Ownership is when the objectified is seen as another person&#x27;s property. Lastly, the denial of subjectivity is a lack of sympathy for the objectified, or the dismissal of the notion that the objectified has feelings. These seven components cause the objectifier to view the objectified in a disrespectful way, therefore treating them so.

== History ==
===Native Americans===

Native Americans were dehumanized as &quot;merciless Indian savages&quot; in the United States Declaration of Independence. Following the Wounded Knee massacre in December 1890, author L. Frank Baum wrote:The &quot;Pioneer&quot; has before declared that our only safety depends upon the total extermination [sic] of the Indians. Having wronged them for centuries we had better, in order to protect our civilization, follow it up by one more wrong and wipe these untamed and untamable creatures from the face of the earth. In this lies safety for our settlers and the soldiers who are under incompetent commands. Otherwise, we may expect future years to be as full of trouble with the redskins as those have been in the past. In Martin Luther King Jr.&#x27;s book on civil rights, &quot;Why We Can&#x27;t Wait&quot;, he wrote:

Our nation was born in genocide when it embraced the doctrine that the original American, the Indian, was an inferior race. Even before there were large numbers of Negroes on our shores, the scar of racial hatred had already disfigured colonial society. From the sixteenth century forward, blood flowed in battles over racial supremacy. We are perhaps the only nation which tried as a matter of national policy to wipe out its indigenous population. Moreover, we elevated that tragic experience into a noble crusade. Indeed, even today we have not permitted ourselves to reject or to feel remorse for this shameful episode. Our literature, our films, our drama, our folklore all exalt it.

King was an active supporter of the Native American rights movement, which he drew parallels with his own leadership of the civil rights movement. Both movements aimed to overturn dehumanizing attitudes held by members of the public at large against them.
===Israelis and Palestinians===
Israel–Palestine relations have been historically hostile resulting in the ongoing Israeli–Palestinian conflict. During the 2014 Gaza War a survey using the Ascent of Man Scale found both sides on average when shown a version of the March of Progress image rated each other closer to an animal than a fully evolved human. On the scale with &quot;0 corresponding to the left side of the image (i.e., quadrupedal human ancestor), and 100 corresponding to the right side of the image (&#x27;full&#x27; modern-day human)&quot; Israelis on average rated Palestinians 39.81 points lower than their own group and Palestinians on average rated Israelis 37.03 points lower than their own group.

Dehumanizing zoomorphisms are found in both Israeli discourse and Palestinian discourse. During South Africa&#x27;s submission to the International Court of Justice (ICJ) that Israel was committing genocide against the Palestinians, the president of the ICJ cited Yoav Gallant for using the phrase &quot;human animals&quot; in reference to Palestinians.

== Causes and facilitating factors ==
Several lines of psychological research relate to the concept of dehumanization. Infrahumanization suggests that individuals think of and treat outgroup members as &quot;less human&quot; and more like animals; while Austrian ethnologist Irenäus Eibl-Eibesfeldt uses the term &quot;pseudo-speciation&quot;, a term that he borrowed from the psychoanalyst Erik Erikson, to imply that the dehumanized person or persons are regarded as not members of the human species. Specifically, individuals associate secondary emotions (which are seen as uniquely human) more with the ingroup than with the outgroup. Primary emotions (those experienced by all sentient beings, whether human or other animals) are found to be more associated with the outgroup. Dehumanization is intrinsically connected with violence. Often, one cannot do serious injury to another without first dehumanizing him or her in one&#x27;s mind (as a form of rationalization). Military training is, among other things, systematic desensitization and dehumanization of the enemy, and military personnel may find it psychologically necessary to refer to the enemy as an animal or other non-human beings. Lt. Col. Dave Grossman has shown that without such desensitization it would be difficult, if not impossible, for one human to kill another human, even in combat or under threat to their own lives.
According to Daniel Bar-Tal, delegitimization is the &quot;categorization of groups into extreme negative social categories which are excluded from human groups that are considered as acting within the limits of acceptable norms and values&quot;.

Moral exclusion occurs when outgroups are subject to a different set of moral values, rules, and fairness than are used in social relations with ingroup members. When individuals dehumanize others, they no longer experience distress when they treat them poorly. Moral exclusion is used to explain extreme behaviors like genocide, harsh immigration policies, and eugenics, but it can also happen on a more regular, everyday discriminatory level. In laboratory studies, people who are portrayed as lacking human qualities are treated in a particularly harsh and violent manner.

Dehumanized perception occurs when a subject experiences low frequencies of activation within their social cognition neural network. This includes areas of neural networking such as the superior temporal sulcus (STS) and the medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC). A 2001 study by psychologists Chris and Uta Frith suggests that the criticality of social interaction within a neural network has tendencies for subjects to dehumanize those seen as disgust-inducing, leading to social disengagement. Tasks involving social cognition typically activate the neural network responsible for subjective projections of disgust-inducing perceptions and patterns of dehumanization. &quot;Besides manipulations of target persons, manipulations of social goals validate this prediction: Inferring preference, a mental-state inference, significantly increases mPFC and STS activity to these otherwise dehumanized targets.&quot; A 2007 study by Harris, McClure, van den Bos, Cohen, and Fiske suggests that a person&#x27;s choice to dehumanize another person is due to decreased neural activity towards the projected target. This decreased neural activity is identified as low medial prefrontal cortex activation, which is associated with perceiving social information.

While social distance from the outgroup target is a necessary condition for dehumanization, some research suggests that this alone is insufficient. Psychological research has identified high status, power, and social connection as additional factors. Members of high-status groups more often associate humanity with the ingroup than the outgroup, while members of low-status groups exhibit no differences in associations with humanity. Thus, having a high status makes one more likely to dehumanize others. Low-status groups are more associated with human nature traits (e.g., warmth, emotionalism) than uniquely human characteristics, implying that they are closer to animals than humans because these traits are typical of humans but can be seen in other species. In addition, another line of work found that individuals in a position of power were more likely to objectify their subordinates, treating them as a means to one&#x27;s end rather than focusing on their essentially human qualities. Finally, social connection—thinking about a close other or being in the actual presence of a close other—enables dehumanization by reducing the attribution of human mental states, increasing support for treating targets like animals, and increasing willingness to endorse harsh interrogation tactics. This is counterintuitive because social connection has documented personal health and well-being benefits but appears to impair intergroup relations.

Neuroimaging studies have discovered that the medial prefrontal cortex—a brain region distinctively involved in attributing mental states to others—shows diminished activation to extremely dehumanized targets (i.e., those rated, according to the stereotype content model, as low-warmth and low-competence, such as drug addicts or homeless people).

=== Race and ethnicity ===

Racist dehumanization entails that groups and individuals are understood as less than fully human by virtue of their race.

Dehumanization often occurs as a result of intergroup conflict. Ethnic and racial others are often represented as animals in popular culture and scholarship. There is evidence that this representation persists in the American context with African Americans implicitly associated with apes. To the extent that an individual has this dehumanizing implicit association, they are more likely to support violence against African Americans (e.g., jury decisions to execute defendants). Historically, dehumanization is frequently connected to genocidal conflicts in that ideologies before and during the conflict depict victims as subhuman (e.g., rodents). Immigrants may also be dehumanized in this manner.

In 1901, the six Australian colonies assented to federation, creating the modern nation state of Australia and its government. Section 51 (xxvi) excluded Aboriginals from the groups protected by special laws, and section 127 excluded Aboriginals from population counts. The &quot;Commonwealth Franchise Act 1902&quot; categorically denied Aboriginals the right to vote. Indigenous Australians were not allowed the social security benefits (e.g., aged pensions and maternity allowances) which were provided to others. Aboriginals in rural areas were discriminated against and controlled as to where and how they could marry, work, live, and their movements.

In the U.S., African Americans were dehumanized by being classified as non-human primates. A California police officer who was also involved in the Rodney King beating described a dispute between an American Black couple as &quot;something right out of &quot;Gorillas in the Mist&quot;&quot;. Franz Boas and Charles Darwin hypothesized that there might be an evolutionary process among primates. Monkeys and apes were least evolved, then savage and deformed anthropoids, which referred to people of African ancestry, to Caucasians as most developed.

===Language===
Language has been used as an essential tool in the process of dehumanizing others. Examples of dehumanizing language when referring to a person or group of people may include animal, cockroach, rat, vermin, monster, dog, ape, snake, infestation, parasite, alien, savage, and subhuman. Other examples can include racist, sexist, and other derogatory forms of language. The use of dehumanizing language can influence others to view a targeted group as less human or less deserving of humane treatment. 

In Unit 731, an imperial Japanese biological and chemical warfare research facility, brutal experiments were conducted on humans who the researchers referred to as &#x27;maruta&#x27; (丸太) meaning logs. Yoshio Shinozuka, Japanese army medic who performed several vivisections in the facility said, &quot;We called the victims &#x27;logs.&#x27; We didn&#x27;t want to think of them as people. We didn&#x27;t want to admit that we were taking lives. So we convinced ourselves that what we were doing was like cutting down a tree.&quot;

Words such as migrant, immigrant, and expatriate are assigned to foreigners based on their social status and wealth, rather than ability, achievements, or political alignment. Expatriate is a word to describe the privileged, often light-skinned people newly residing in an area and has connotations that suggest ability, wealth, and trust. Meanwhile, the word immigrant is used to describe people coming to a new location to reside and infers a much less-desirable meaning.

The word &quot;immigrant&quot; is sometimes paired with &quot;illegal&quot;, which harbors a profoundly derogatory connotation. Misuse of these terms—they are often used inaccurately—to describe the other, can alter the perception of a group as a whole in a negative way. Ryan Eller, the executive director of the immigrant advocacy group Define American, expressed the problem this way: 
A series of language examinations found a direct relation between homophobic epithets and social cognitive distancing towards a group of homosexuals, a form of dehumanization. These epithets (e.g., &quot;faggot&quot;) were thought to function as dehumanizing labels because they tended to act as markers of deviance. One pair of studies found that subjects were more likely to associate malignant language with homosexuals, and that such language associations increased the physical distancing between the subject and the homosexual. This indicated that the malignant language could encourage dehumanization, cognitive and physical distancing in ways that other forms of malignant language do not. Another study involved a computational linguistic analysis of dehumanizing language regarding LGBTQ individuals and groups in the New York Times from 1986 to 2015. The study used previous psychological research on dehumanization to identify four language categories: (1) negative evaluations of a target group, (2) denial of agency, (3) moral disgust, and (4) likening members of the target group to non-human entities (e.g., machines, animals, vermin). The study revealed that LGBTQ people overall have been increasingly more humanized over time; however, they were found to be humanized less frequently than the New York Time&#x27;s in-group identifier &quot;American&quot;.

Aliza Luft notes that the role of dehumanizing language and propaganda plays in violence and genocide is far less significant than other factors such as obedience to authority and peer pressure.

=== Property takeover ===

Property scholars define dehumanization as &quot;the failure to recognize an individual&#x27;s or group&#x27;s humanity.&quot; Dehumanization often occurs alongside property confiscation. When a property takeover is coupled with dehumanization, the result is a dignity taking. There are several examples of dignity takings involving dehumanization.

From its founding, the United States repeatedly engaged in dignity takings from Native American populations, taking indigenous land in an &quot;undeniably horrific, violent, and tragic record&quot; of genocide and ethnocide. As recently as 2013, the degradation of a mountain sacred to the Hopi people—by spraying its peak pot with artificial snow made from wastewater—constituted another dignity taking by the U.S. Forest Service.

The 1921 Tulsa race massacre also constituted a dignity taking involving dehumanization. White rioters dehumanized African Americans by attacking, looting, and destroying homes and businesses in Greenwood, a predominantly Black neighborhood known as &quot;Black Wall Street&quot;.

During the Holocaust, mass genocide—a severe form of dehumanization—accompanied the destruction and taking of Jewish property. This constituted a dignity taking.

Jewish settlers in the West Bank have been criticized for dehumanizing Palestinians and land grabbing on illegal settlements. These illegal settlement activities involve systemic settler violence against Palestinians, military orders, and state-sanctioned support. These actions force Palestinians to gradually give up their land and farming activities and gradually choke their sources of dignified income. Israeli soldiers sometimes actively participate in violence against civilians or look on from the sidelines.

Undocumented workers in the United States have also been subject to dehumanizing dignity takings when employers treat them as machines instead of people to justify dangerous working conditions. When harsh conditions lead to bodily injury or death, the property destroyed is the physical body.

=== Media-driven dehumanization ===
The propaganda model of Edward S. Herman and Noam Chomsky argues that corporate media are able to carry out large-scale, successful dehumanization campaigns when they promote the goals (profit-making) that the corporations are contractually obliged to maximize. State media are also capable of carrying out dehumanization campaigns, whether in democracies or dictatorships, which are pervasive enough that the population cannot avoid the dehumanizing memes.

=== War propaganda ===
National leaders use dehumanizing propaganda to sway public opinion in favor of the military elite&#x27;s agenda or cause and to repel criticism and proper oversight. The Bush Jr administration used dehumanizing rhetoric to describe Arabs and Muslims collectively as backwards, violent fanatics who &quot;hate us for our freedom&quot; to justify his invasions of Afghanistan and Iraq and covert CIA operations in the Middle East and Africa. The media propaganda portrayed Arabs as a &quot;monolithic evil&quot; in the perception of the unwitting American public. They employed news, media, language, magazine stories, television, and popular culture to portray all Muslims as Arab and all Arabs as violent terrorists which much be feared, fought, and destroyed. Racism was also used by portraying all Arabs as dark-skinned and thus racially inferior and untrustworthy.

=== Non-state actors ===
Non-state actors—terrorists in particular—have also resorted to dehumanization to further their cause. The 1960s terrorist group Weather Underground had advocated violence against any authority figure and used the &quot;police are pigs&quot; meme to convince members that they were not harming human beings but merely killing wild animals. Likewise, rhetoric statements such as &quot;terrorists are just scum&quot;, is an act of dehumanization.

== In science, medicine, and technology ==

Relatively recent history has seen the relationship between dehumanization and science result in unethical scientific research. The Tuskegee syphilis experiment, Unit 731, and Nazi human experimentation on Jewish people are three such examples. In the former, African Americans with syphilis were recruited to participate in a study about the course of the disease. Even when treatment and a cure were eventually developed, they were withheld from the African-American participants so that researchers could continue their study. Similarly, Nazi scientists during the Holocaust conducted horrific experiments on Jewish people and Shiro Ishii&#x27;s Unit 731 also did so to Chinese, Russian, Mongolian, American, and other nationalities held captive. Both were justified in the name of research and progress, which is indicative of the far-reaching effects that the culture of dehumanization had upon this society. When this research came to light, efforts were made to protect future research participants, and currently, institutional review boards exist to safeguard individuals from being exploited by scientists.

In a medical context, some dehumanizing practices have become more acceptable. While the dissection of human cadavers was seen as dehumanizing in the Dark Ages (see history of anatomy), the value of dissections as a training aid is such that they are now more widely accepted. Dehumanization has been associated with modern medicine generally and has explicitly been suggested as a coping mechanism for doctors who work with patients at the end of life. Researchers have identified six potential causes of dehumanization in medicine: deindividuating practices, impaired patient agency, dissimilarity (causes which do not facilitate the delivery of medical treatment), mechanization, empathy reduction, and moral disengagement (which could be argued to facilitate the delivery of medical treatment).

In some US states, legislation requires that a woman view ultrasound images of her fetus before having an abortion. Critics of the law argue that merely seeing an image of the fetus humanizes it and biases women against abortion. Similarly, a recent study showed that subtle humanization of medical patients appears to improve care for these patients. Radiologists evaluating X-rays reported more details to patients and expressed more empathy when a photo of the patient&#x27;s face accompanied the X-rays. It appears that the inclusion of the photos counteracts the dehumanization of the medical process.

Dehumanization has applications outside traditional social contexts. Anthropomorphism (i.e., perceiving mental and physical capacities that reflect humans in nonhuman entities) is the inverse of dehumanization. Waytz, Epley, and Cacioppo suggest that the inverse of the factors that facilitate dehumanization (e.g., high status, power, and social connection) should promote anthropomorphism. That is, a low status, socially disconnected person without power should be more likely to attribute human qualities to pets or inanimate objects than a high-status, high-power, socially connected person.

Researchers have found that engaging in violent video game play diminishes perceptions of both one&#x27;s own humanity and the humanity of the players who are targets of the game violence. While the players are dehumanized, the video game characters are often anthropomorphized.

Dehumanization has occurred historically under the pretense of &quot;progress in the name of science&quot;. During the 1904 Louisiana Purchase Exposition, human zoos exhibited several natives from independent tribes worldwide, most notably a young Congolese man, Ota Benga. Benga&#x27;s imprisonment was put on display as a public service showcasing &quot;a degraded and degenerate race&quot;. After relocating to New York in 1906, public outcry led to the permanent ban and closure of human zoos in the United States.

== In philosophy ==

Danish philosopher Søren Kierkegaard explained his stance of anti-dehumanization in his teachings and interpretations of Christian theology. He wrote in his book Works of Love his understanding to be that &quot;to love one&#x27;s neighbor means equality… your neighbor is every man… he is your neighbor on the basis of equality with you before God; but this equality absolutely every man has, and he has it absolutely.&quot;

== In art ==
Spanish romanticism painter Francisco Goya often depicted subjectivity involving the atrocities of war and brutal violence conveying the process of dehumanization. In the romantic period of painting, martyrdom art was most often a means of deifying the oppressed and tormented, and it was common for Goya to depict evil personalities performing these acts; however, he broke convention by dehumanizing these martyr figures: &quot;...one would not know whom the painting depicts, so determinedly has Goya reduced his subjects from martyrs to meat&quot;.

<doc id="805000" wikidata="Q40035" url="?curid=805000" title="Richard Linklater">
<text>Richard Stuart Linklater (; born July 30, 1960) is an American filmmaker. He is known for making films that deal thematically with suburban culture and the effects of the passage of time. In 2015, Linklater was included on the annual &quot;Time&quot; 100 list of the most influential people in the world.

His films include the comedies &quot;Slacker&quot; (1990) and &quot;Dazed and Confused&quot; (1993); the &quot;Before&quot; trilogy of romance films: &quot;Before Sunrise&quot; (1995), &quot;Before Sunset&quot; (2004), and &quot;Before Midnight&quot; (2013); the music-themed comedy &quot;School of Rock&quot; (2003); the adult animated films &quot;Waking Life&quot; (2001), &quot;A Scanner Darkly&quot; (2006), and &quot;Apollo 10½: A Space Age Childhood&quot; (2022); the coming-of-age drama &quot;Boyhood&quot; (2014); the comedy film &quot;Everybody Wants Some!!&quot; (2016); and the romantic comedy &quot;Hit Man&quot; (2023).

Many of Linklater&#x27;s films are noted for their loosely structured narratives. The &quot;Before&quot; trilogy and &quot;Boyhood&quot; both feature the same actors filmed over an extended period of years. He has received five Academy Award nominations and won the Silver Bear for Best Director for &quot;Before Sunrise&quot;. He also won a Golden Globe Award for directing &quot;Boyhood&quot;.

==Early life==
Linklater was born in Houston, Texas, the son of Diane Margaret (née Krieger), who taught at Sam Houston State University, and Charles W. Linklater, III. He attended Huntsville High School in Huntsville, Texas, during grades 9–11, where he played football for Joe Clements as a backup quarterback for the #1 ranked team in the state. For his senior year, he moved to Bellaire High School in Bellaire, Texas, because he was better at baseball than football and Bellaire had a better baseball coach. As a teen he won a Scholastic Art and Writing Award.

Linklater studied at Sam Houston State University (where he also played baseball), until dropping out to work on an offshore oil rig in the Gulf of Mexico.

He frequently read novels on the rig, and upon returning to land, developed a love of film through repeated visits to a repertory cinema in Houston. At this point, Linklater realized he wanted to be a filmmaker. He used his savings to buy a Super-8 camera, a projector, and editing equipment, and moved to Austin, Texas.

==Career==
===1985–2000: Early directing===
Linklater founded the Austin Film Society in 1985 with his college professor Chale Nafus, University of Texas professor Charles Ramirez-Berg, SXSW founder Louis Black, and his frequent collaborator Lee Daniel. One of the mentors for the Film Society was former New York City critic for the &quot;SoHo Weekly News&quot; George Morris, who had relocated to Austin and taught film there.

For several years, Linklater made many short films that were exercises and experiments in film techniques. He finally completed his first feature, &quot;It&#x27;s Impossible to Learn to Plow by Reading Books&quot; (which is available in The Criterion Collection edition of his second feature, &quot;Slacker&quot;), a Super-8 feature that took a year to shoot and another year to edit.

Linklater created Detour Filmproduction (an homage to the 1945 low budget film noir by Edgar G. Ulmer), and subsequently made &quot;Slacker&quot; for only $23,000. It went on to gross more than $1.25 million. The film shows an aimless day in the life of the city of Austin, Texas showcasing its more eccentric characters.

While gaining a cult following in the independent film world, he made his third film, &quot;Dazed and Confused&quot;, based on his years at Huntsville High School and the people he encountered there. The film garnered critical praise and grossed $8 million in the United States while becoming a hit on VHS. This film was also responsible for the breakout of fellow Texas native Matthew McConaughey.

In 1995, Linklater won the Silver Bear for Best Director for the film &quot;Before Sunrise&quot; at the 45th Berlin International Film Festival. His next feature, &quot;subUrbia&quot;, had mixed reviews critically, and did very poorly at the box office. In 1998, he took on his first Hollywood feature, &quot;The Newton Boys&quot;, which received mixed reviews while tanking at the box office.

===2001–2013: Wider recognition===
With the rotoscope films &quot;Waking Life&quot; and &quot;A Scanner Darkly&quot;, and his mainstream comedies, &quot;School of Rock&quot; and the remake of &quot;Bad News Bears&quot;, he gained wider recognition.

In 2003, he wrote and directed a pilot for HBO with Rodney Rothman called &quot;$5.15/hr&quot;, about several minimum wage restaurant workers. The pilot deals with themes later examined in &quot;Fast Food Nation&quot;.

The British television network Channel 4 produced a documentary about Linklater, in which the filmmaker discussed the personal and philosophical ideas behind his films. &quot;St Richard of Austin&quot; was presented by Ben Lewis and directed by Irshad Ashraf and broadcast on Channel 4 in December 2004 in the UK.

Linklater was nominated for an Academy Award for Best Adapted Screenplay for his film &quot;Before Sunset&quot;.

&quot;Waking Life&quot; and &quot;A Scanner Darkly&quot; both used rotoscoping animation techniques. Working with Bob Sabiston and Sabiston&#x27;s program Rotoshop to create this effect, Linklater shot and edited both movies completely as live-action features, then employed a team of artists to &quot;trace over&quot; individual frames. The result is a distinctive &quot;semi-real&quot; quality, praised by such critics as Roger Ebert (in the case of &quot;Waking Life&quot;) as being original and well-suited to the aims of the film.

&quot;Fast Food Nation&quot; (2006) is an adaptation of the best selling book that examines the local and global influence of the United States fast food industry. The film was entered into the 2006 Cannes Film Festival before being released in North America on November 17, 2006, and in Europe on March 23, 2007. The film received mixed reviews.

Linklater fared better with the critics with &quot;A Scanner Darkly&quot; (released in the same year), &quot;Me and Orson Welles&quot; (2009), and &quot;Bernie&quot; (2011).

He was nominated for an Academy Award for Best Adapted Screenplay for &quot;Before Midnight&quot;, the third film in the &quot;Before...&quot; trilogy.

===2014–present: &quot;Boyhood&quot; and other works===
In 2014 he released the film &quot;Boyhood&quot;, which had been 12 years in the making. &quot;Boyhood&quot; received overwhelming critical acclaim. Linklater won the Golden Globes, Critics&#x27; Choice Movie Awards, and BAFTAs for Best Director and Best Picture. He also received his first nomination for the Academy Award for Best Director, along with nominations for Best Original Screenplay and Best Picture.

For a while Linklater was attached to direct a remake of &quot;The Incredible Mr. Limpet&quot; for Warner Bros. However, he dropped the project in favor of working on a spiritual successor to &quot;Dazed and Confused&quot;, titled &quot;Everybody Wants Some!!&quot;, with backing from Annapurna Pictures and Paramount distributing the film in North America. The film was released in March 2016 and was well received by critics, but it failed to recoup its budget of 10 million dollars, grossing only 4.6 million.

In the second half of the 2010s, Linklater wrote and directed the drama film &quot;Last Flag Flying&quot;, starring Bryan Cranston, Laurence Fishburne, and Steve Carell. A sequel to Hal Ashby&#x27;s 1973 film &quot;The Last Detail&quot;, it began filming in November 2016, and was released on November 3, 2017. Linklater then directed &quot;Where&#x27;d You Go, Bernadette&quot;, based on the novel by Maria Semple and produced by Annapurna Pictures.

Linklater was attached to direct an adaptation of Graeme Simsion&#x27;s novel &quot;The Rosie Project&quot; that would have starred Jennifer Lawrence in the lead role, but he dropped out of directing when Lawrence dropped out of the project.

In 2019, it was announced that Linklater would be filming an adaptation of Stephen Sondheim&#x27;s musical &quot;Merrily We Roll Along&quot;. Like &quot;Boyhood&quot;, it will be filmed over the course of several years, but, like the musical and the play it is based on, will be presented in reverse chronology.

In 2024, Linklater directed an episode of &quot;God Save Texas&quot; for HBO, focusing on the prison industrial complex in Huntsville, Texas.

===Directorial style===
Inspiration for Linklater&#x27;s work was largely based on his experience viewing the film &quot;Raging Bull&quot;.

It made me see movies as a potential outlet for what I was thinking about and hoping to express. At that point I was an unformed artist. At that moment, something was simmering in me, but &quot;Raging Bull&quot; brought it to a boil.

He was also influenced by Robert Bresson, Yasujirō Ozu, Rainer Werner Fassbinder, Eric Rohmer, François Truffaut, Josef Von Sternberg, and Carl Theodor Dreyer.

Many of Linklater&#x27;s films, including &quot;Slacker&quot;, &quot;Dazed and Confused&quot;, &quot;Tape&quot;, and all three installments of the &quot;Before Trilogy&quot;, take place in a single day. They are less plot-driven and more about human interactions.

==Personal life==
Linklater lives in Austin, Texas, and refuses to live or work in Hollywood for any extended period of time.

Linklater has been partnered with Christina Harrison since the 1990s. In 1994 they had a daughter, and twin girls in 2004. The oldest, Lorelei Linklater, co-starred in &quot;Boyhood&quot; as the sister of the main character.

Linklater has been a vegetarian since his early 20s. In 2015, he explained the dietary lifestyle in a &quot;Boyhood&quot;-style documentary for People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals.

<doc id="805020" wikidata="Q1189814" url="?curid=805020" title="Density 21.5">
<text>Density 21.5 is a composition for solo flute written by Edgard Varèse in 1936 and revised in 1946. The piece was composed at the request of Georges Barrère for the premiere of his platinum flute, the density of platinum being close to 21.5 grams per cubic centimetre.

==Structure==
AllMusic&#x27;s Sean Hickey writes, &quot;According to the composer, &quot;Density 21.5&quot; is based on two melodic ideas—one modal, one atonal—and all of the subsequent material is generated from these two themes. Despite the inherent limitations of writing for an unaccompanied melodic instrument, Varèse expertly explores new areas of space and time, utilizing registral contrasts to effect polyphonic continuity.&quot;

George Perle analyses the piece both harmonically and motivically, and describes its background structure. Formally, he says, the piece consists of two parts of nearly equal length, the end of the first section being bars 24–28. The piece uses interval cycles, &quot;inherently non-diatonic symmetrical elements&quot;. The opening ten bars outline a tritone, C–G, itself further divided into minor thirds (by E) with the upper minor third differentiated by a passing tone, F, that is lacking in the lower minor third. Thus the diminished seventh chord, or rather C31, interval cycle, partitions the octave, and &quot;places Varèse with Scriabin and the Schoenberg circle among the revolutionary composers whose work initiates the beginning of a new mainstream tradition in the music of our century&quot;.

He continues: &quot;the concept of the perfect fourth or fifth as a referential interval relative to which the tritone requires resolution ... has no relevance at all to &quot;Density 21.5&quot;&quot;. However, there still is a reference point, first in the differentiated minor third, C–(E–F–G)–B. The second tritone, created by C31, E–B, C64, is hierarchically related to the C–G tritone, C61. Thus regristral placement is taken into consideration, creating pitches rather than pitch classes. &quot;My reason for stressing this hierchical distinction between C61, and C64 is that there is a constant shifting of such distinctions, a constant reinterpretation of structural notes as passing notes and vice versa, and it is through this ambiguity, this perpetual change of function, that the composition unfolds. This is what the composition is &quot;.

The piece proceeds to outline new tritones, D–G, D–A, and then pauses, in measures 13–14, B–E, which is part of C3, &quot;right back where he had started&quot;, however, &quot;the relation between the two tritones of C31 becomes not less but more ambiguous&quot;. He sees the close of the first section as the attainment of the e–c missing from the E–G of bars 13–17. However, the B which divides G–D require an F, &quot;if we assume that the G–B–D collection represents an incomplete diminished-seventh chord, that the work is based on structural relations derived from the interval-3 cycle, and that this implies a tendency for each partition of the cycle to be completely represented&quot;.

From the second beat of bar 56 until the end, however, the piece uses an interval-2 cycle, C2, which still produces tritones, but partitions them differently. E–B is paired with D–(G) and C–F, rather than C–G. The only odd interval (outside the interval-2 cycle) is the F–C, &quot;which transfers us from C20 to C21. And here, in the last two notes of &quot;Density 21.5&quot; we at last find B paired with its tritone associate ... only as a consequence of an entirely new harmonic direction that the work takes in its closing bars.&quot; However, &quot;the music of the &#x27;common practice&#x27; offers many exemplars of such altogether unexpected digressions just as a work is drawing to its close, followed by a return, for the final cadence, to a consequently more emphatic confirmation of the structural relations implied in the body of the work.&quot;

In the foreground, the head motif, presumably Varèse&#x27;s atonal &quot;idea&quot;, does not contain a minor third or tritone, and thus each pitch, F–E–F, is a member of a different interval-3 cycle or diminished-seventh chord. The structural importance of each pitch is then dependent on its context, at which level it partitions the octave, the tritone which divides the octave, the minor third which divides the tritone, the major second which divides the major third, the minor second which divides the major second. &quot;This variable relation of the basic motive of &quot;Density 21.5&quot; to the harmonic structure of the piece, and its function in articulating and clarifying the formal design, are exactly what we would expect and take for granted in the relation between motive and background in traditional tonal music.&quot;

Defined by the head motif and its repetition in bar 3, is &quot;characterized by its relative pitch content (a three-note segment of the semitonal scale), by its interval order—down a half step and up a whole step—and by its rhythm (two sixteenth-notes on the beat followed by a tied eighth-note). This definitive version of the motive, combining all three attributes, occurs at only three different points (not counting the repetition in bar 3), each initiating a new and major formal subdivision of the piece.&quot;

Timothy Kloth interprets the head motif or, &quot;the molecular structure around which the entire composition is cast,&quot; as being the five-pitch-class motive which opens the piece, F–E–F–C–G. This is divided into two trichords: &quot;cell X&quot; (also Perle&#x27;s head motif, F–E–F) and &quot;cell Y&quot;, F–C–G.

<doc id="805037" wikidata="Q1167290" url="?curid=805037" title="The Crush (1993 film)">
<text>The Crush is a 1993 American psychological thriller film written and directed by Alan Shapiro, which stars Cary Elwes as Nick Eliot and Alicia Silverstone as Adrian Forrester, in her feature film debut. When writer Nick Eliot moves to a new city for a magazine job, Adrian Forrester, the teenage daughter of the landlords whose guesthouse he rents, instantly makes her attraction to Nick clear. Nick has trouble fending off Adrian&#x27;s advances, and as her obsession grows, the situation becomes increasingly dangerous.

&quot;The Crush&quot; received mostly negative reviews from critics on release, and was not a big box office success, although it became especially popular through the video rental market, and showings on cable television. In subsequent years it has been labeled a cult film.

==Plot==
Twenty-eight-year-old writer Nick Eliot secures a job at &quot;Pique&quot; magazine and lodging in a guest house belonging to Cliff and Liv Forrester. The handsome Nick soon becomes acquainted with and frequently visited by the couple&#x27;s fourteen-year-old daughter Adrian, a precocious girl who becomes intensely infatuated with him. She drops by the guest house one afternoon with a gift for Nick while he is taking a shower, and after he tells her he needs to get dressed, she sneaks a peek at his bare backside, and grins mischievously.

Adrian invites Nick to a party that her parents are throwing at their house. Without confirming that he will attend, Nick decides to stop in. As he enters the house, Nick is taken by Adrian&#x27;s impressive piano performance. Nick follows Adrian to her parents&#x27; outdoor balcony afterwards. He muses that if she were just ten years older, as she flirtatiously interrupts him, questioning what he would do. Redirecting the conversation, Adrian suddenly encourages Nick to take her for a ride in his convertible. Nick agrees to drive Adrian to a place of her choosing; a romantic secluded area where she kisses him. Though initially receptive to the kiss, Nick stops when he realizes he is being seduced. Without leading her on, Nick takes Adrian home. 
Adrian&#x27;s crush on Nick intensifies, but he quickly wises up and attempts to put her off. He begins a budding romance with coworker Amy. Adrian becomes jealous and meets Amy in the woods while she is gathering sticks for a marshmallow roast and corrects her when she spots a bee&#x27;s nest in a tree, identifying them as wasps in the form of a subtle warning. Adrian continues to boldly pursue Nick, sneaking into his room to rewrite his article (which impresses his boss, Michael) and even going so far as to undress in front of him when he accidentally hides in her closet.

When Nick continues to rebuff her advances, Adrian&#x27;s actions become destructive; she steals his favorite childhood photo, defaces a car he has restored, and erases his computer discs, yet he is unable to convince Adrian&#x27;s parents of her guilt. Cheyenne, a friend of Adrian&#x27;s, tries to warn Nick about her, but she has an &quot;accident&quot; at the riding school she and Adrian attend together when Adrian sabotages the saddle on her horse. After Adrian spies on Nick in bed with Amy, she locks Amy in her darkroom and empties a wasp&#x27;s nest into the vents, severely stinging her.

Amy survives, and Nick, now convinced that Adrian is big trouble, attempts to find new lodging. However, Adrian accuses him of sexually assaulting her with &quot;evidence&quot; obtained from a used condom from Nick&#x27;s trash; he is subsequently arrested. After Michael bails him out (and suspends him until trial), Cheyenne tells Nick that she knows he is innocent and that Adrian has an extensive history of obsessive behavior, citing a previous crush on a camp counselor named Rick who &quot;accidentally&quot; died from eating something poisonous. Cheyenne also informs Nick of a diary Adrian kept that can exonerate him.

After Cheyenne departs, Nick hears strange noises coming from the Forresters&#x27; house. He investigates and finds Cheyenne bound and gagged on the carousel in the attic. Adrian confronts and attacks him, leading Cliff to attack Nick after he mistakes him for the aggressor. Adrian then knocks Cliff unconscious in defense of Nick, enabling the latter to subdue her with one punch. Acquitted, Nick goes to live with Amy in Seattle while Adrian is confined to a psychiatric hospital. Though she laments that Nick refuses to speak to her, respond to the multiple letters she has written, or accept her apologies, her doctor comments that she is making good progress, unaware that she is now developing a crush on him. In the final scene, Adrian returns to her room in the hospital, where she glares at a photo of the doctor and his wife before her mouth slowly curves into a devious smile.

==Cast==
* Cary Elwes as Nicholas &quot;Nick&quot; Eliot
* Alicia Silverstone as Adrian/Darian Forrester
* Jennifer Rubin as Amy Maddik
* Kurtwood Smith as Cliff Forrester
* Gwynyth Walsh as Liv Forrester
* Amber Benson as Cheyenne
* Matthew Walker as Michael

==Lawsuit and character name change==
Writer and director Alan Shapiro based the film on events from his own life. The girl on whom he based Adrian sued him for using her real name, Darian, for Alicia Silverstone&#x27;s character. As a result, when the film was re-edited for television, the character&#x27;s name was changed from Darian to Adrian. Silverstone is still credited as having played Darian Forrester on IMDb.
The VHS and laser disc releases retained the original spoken dialogue that called the character Darian. The original theatrical trailer also refers to the character as Darian.

==Reception==
On Rotten Tomatoes, it has a 27% rating based on reviews from 30 critics. On Metacritic it has a score of 34% based on reviews from 16 critics, indicating &quot;generally unfavorable reviews&quot;. Audiences polled by CinemaScore gave the film an average grade of &quot;C+&quot; on an A+ to F scale.

Brian Lowry of &quot;Variety&quot; compared the film to &quot;Poison Ivy&quot; (1992) and called it &quot;another by-the-numbers thriller&quot; and was critical of lack of gore or nudity, suggesting the R rating must stand for &quot;ridiculous.&quot;
Hal Hinson of the &quot;Washington Post&quot; wrote: &quot;There&#x27;s something scuzzy about the whole exercise.&quot;
Janet Maslin of &quot;The New York Times&quot; said it &quot;Never succeeds in becoming either torrid or scary&quot; and that it &quot;is for the most part grindingly predictable and mechanically played.&quot;

<doc id="805053" wikidata="Q659609" url="?curid=805053" title="Before Sunrise">
<text>Before Sunrise is a 1995 romantic drama film directed by Richard Linklater and co-written by Linklater and Kim Krizan, and is the first installment in the &quot;Before&quot; trilogy. In the film, Jesse (Ethan Hawke) and Céline (Julie Delpy) meet on a Eurail train and disembark in Vienna to spend the night together.

Inspired by personal experiences, Linklater collaborated with Krizan, who previously appeared in his films &quot;Slacker&quot; (1991) and &quot;Dazed and Confused&quot; (1993), to develop the film&#x27;s screenplay. Casting was extensive; it took nine months for Hawke and Delpy to be cast. Principal photography took place in Vienna. The plot is considered minimalistic, consisting mostly of monologues and extended dialogue between the characters. The film explores themes and differing perspectives on life, love, time, death, self-discovery, and postmodern romance.

&quot;Before Sunrise&quot; premiered at the Sundance Film Festival on January 19, 1995, and was theatrically released in the United States eight days later. It grossed $22.5 million and received critical acclaim, particularly for its screenplay, Linklater&#x27;s direction, and acting performances. &quot;Before Sunrise&quot; also received a rating of 100% on Rotten Tomatoes, and appeared on many critics&#x27; lists of the greatest films of the year. The sequel &quot;Before Sunset&quot; was released in 2004, and &quot;Before Midnight&quot;, the third film, was released in 2013.

==Plot==
On June 16, 1994, Jesse meets Céline on a train from Budapest, and they strike up a conversation. Jesse is going to Vienna to catch a flight back to the United States, whereas Céline is returning to university in Paris after visiting her grandmother. When they reach Vienna, Jesse asks Céline to disembark with him, saying that 10 or 20 years down the road, she might not be happy with her significant other and might wonder how her life would have been different if she had picked someone else. Alternatively, she may just realize Jesse himself is not that different from the rest. Lacking the money to rent a room for the night, they decide to roam around in Vienna until Jesse&#x27;s flight the next morning.

After visiting a few landmarks in Vienna, they share a kiss at the top of the Wiener Riesenrad at sunset and start to feel a romantic connection. As they continue to roam around the city, they begin to talk more openly with each other, with conversations ranging from topics about love, life, religion, and their observations of Vienna.

When they are walking alongside the Donaukanal, they are approached by a man who offers to write them a poem with a word of their choice inside. Jesse and Céline decide on the word &quot;milkshake” and are soon presented with the poem &quot;Delusion Angel&quot; (written for the film by poet David Jewell)—a poem that Jesse cynically claims the man had already previously written and just inserts the words people choose.

Later, while playing pinball at a local club, Céline tells Jesse that her last boyfriend broke up with her six months ago, claiming that she &quot;loved him too much.” When questioned, Jesse reveals he had initially come to Europe to spend time with his girlfriend who was studying in Madrid, but they broke up soon after he was there. He found a cheap flight home, via Vienna, but it did not leave for two weeks so he bought a Eurail pass and traveled around Europe. In a Viennese café, Jesse and Céline stage fake phone conversations with each other, playing each other&#x27;s friends they pretend to call. Céline reveals that she was ready to get off the train with Jesse before he convinced her. Jesse reveals that after he broke up with his girlfriend, he bought a flight that really was not much cheaper, and all he really wanted was an escape from his life.

They admit their attraction to each other and how the night has made them feel, though they understand that they probably will not see each other again. They decide to make the best of what time they have left. They then get a bottle of wine and share it together in a park and begin discussing whether or not they should make love. Céline says that she doesn&#x27;t just want to be a one-night stand for Jesse, and then Jesse explains that, if given the choice, he would marry her instead of never seeing her again. They begin kissing passionately and embracing each other, then it is heavily implied Jesse and Céline make love in the park. The film ends the next day at the train station, where, just as Céline&#x27;s train is about to leave, the couple decide not to exchange any contact information but instead meet at the same place in six months.

==Production==
&quot;Before Sunrise&quot; was inspired by a woman named Amy Lehrhaupt, whom writer/director Richard Linklater met in a toy shop in Philadelphia in 1989. They walked around the city together, conversing deep into the night. In 2013, Linklater revealed that Lehrhaupt had died in a motorcycle accident before the release of &quot;Before Sunrise.&quot;

Originally, in the screenplay, who the two people were and the city they spend time in was vague. Linklater realized that because the film is so much a dialogue between a man and a woman, it was important to have a strong female co-writer. He chose Kim Krizan, who had small roles in his two previous films &quot;Slacker&quot; and &quot;Dazed and Confused&quot;. According to Linklater, he &quot;loved the way her mind worked – a constant stream of confident and intelligent ideas&quot;.

Linklater and Krizan long discussed the concept of the film and the characters. He wanted to explore the &quot;relationship side of life and discover two people who had complete anonymity and try to find out who they really were&quot;. He decided to put Jesse and Céline in a foreign country because &quot;when you&#x27;re traveling, you&#x27;re much more open to experiences outside your usual realm&quot;. He and Krizan worked on an outline. They wrote the actual screenplay in 11 days.

Linklater spent nine months casting the film because he had trouble finding the right actors for the roles of Jesse and Céline. When Linklater first considered casting Hawke, he thought that the actor was too young for the part. Linklater saw Hawke at a play in New York City and reconsidered after talking to the actor. For Céline, Linklater met Julie Delpy and liked her personality. After they did a final reading, Linklater knew that Delpy and Hawke were right for the roles. Once Delpy and Hawke agreed to do the film, they went to Austin and talked with Linklater and Krizan for a few days.

=== Authorship ===
In 2016, Delpy told &quot;Creative Screenwriting,&quot; &quot;Ethan and I basically re-wrote all of it. There was an original screenplay, but it wasn&#x27;t very romantic, believe it or not. It was just a lot of talking, rather than romance. Richard hired us because he knew we were writing and he wanted us to bring that romance to the film. We brought those romantic ideas and that&#x27;s how I wrote something that actually got made, without really getting credit for it. But, if I had written &quot;Before Sunrise&quot; and been credited, then I doubt it would have been financed&quot;. In 2019, credited screenwriter Kim Krizan disputed Delpy&#x27;s claim that the actors re-wrote the entire script. Linklater and Krizan are credited for writing &quot;Before Sunrise&quot;, while Delpy and Hawke are credited for co-writing the sequels and Krizan credited with story credit for &quot;Before Sunset&quot; and characters created by credit on &quot;Before Midnight&quot;.

==Themes==
&quot;Before Sunrise&quot; revolves largely around the twin themes of self-fulfillment and self-discovery through a significant other, charging the concept through the introduction of a twelve-hour time constraint in which the goals implicit to the two themes have to be realized. They are underlined by the poem &quot;Delusion Angel&quot;, which evokes a longing for complete and unifying, possibly even redeeming, understanding between two partners in a world which is itself unknowable, and over which one can exercise no control.

An important role is played by the theme of spontaneous and uninhibited response to one&#x27;s environment. It is reflected by the actions of Jesse and Céline, whose joint stream of consciousness, initiated by a previously unmeditated decision to leave the train together, allows them to temporarily detach themselves from the world, and enter a realm where only the other&#x27;s company is of importance. Come morning, Jesse remarks that he and Céline have again entered &quot;real time&quot;.

It could be argued that &quot;Before Sunrise&quot; subsumes its main themes under that of life. In one scene, Céline and Jesse visit the Friedhof der Namenlosen, the Cemetery of the Nameless in Simmering. The people buried in the cemetery have found anonymity in death; by learning to know and understand one another, Céline and Jesse experience and embrace life, suspending their own mortality.

The film leaves audience members to decide for themselves whether Jesse and Céline will meet again in six months. Critic Robin Wood has written that, after he published an essay on the film (in a 1996 issue of &quot;CineAction&quot;), Linklater wrote him to say that &quot;neither he nor the two actors ever doubted that the date would be kept.&quot;

The film takes place on June 16, Bloomsday.

==Reception==
&quot;Before Sunrise&quot; had its world premiere at the 1995 Sundance Film Festival. It was released in the United States on January 27, 1995.

===Critical reception===
The film was entered into the 45th Berlin International Film Festival where Linklater won the Silver Bear for Best Director. MTV Movie &amp; TV Award nominated Hawke and Delpy for the Best Kiss award.

Rotten Tomatoes reported that 100% of critics have given the film a positive review, based on 50 reviews, with an average rating of 8.4/10. The site&#x27;s critics consensus reads &quot;Thought-provoking and beautifully filmed, &quot;Before Sunrise&quot; is an intelligent, unabashedly romantic look at modern love, led by marvelously natural performances from Ethan Hawke and Julie Delpy.&quot; On Metacritic, the film has a weighted average score of 78 out of 100 based on 18 critics, indicating &quot;generally favorable reviews&quot;. Audiences surveyed by CinemaScore gave the film an average grade of &quot;B&quot; on an A+ to F scale.

Film critic Roger Ebert gave &quot;Before Sunrise&quot; three out of four and described Delpy as &quot;ravishingly beautiful and, more important, warm and matter-of-fact, speaking English so well the screenplay has to explain it (she spent some time in the States)&quot;. In her review for &quot;The New York Times&quot;, Janet Maslin wrote &quot;&quot;Before Sunrise&quot; is as uneven as any marathon conversation might be, combining colorful, disarming insights with periodic lulls. The film maker clearly wants things this way, with both these young characters trying on ideas and attitudes as if they were new clothes&quot;. Hal Hinson, in his review for &quot;The Washington Post&quot; wrote &quot;&quot;Before Sunrise&quot; is not a big movie, or one with big ideas, but it is a cut above the banal twentysomething love stories you usually see at the movies. This one, at least, treats young people as real people&quot;.

In his review for the &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot;, Peter Rainer wrote &quot;It&#x27;s an attempt to make a mainstream youth movie with a bit more feeling and mysteriousness than most, and, in this, it succeeds&quot;. Marjorie Baumgarten, in her review for &quot;The Austin Chronicle&quot;, wrote &quot;&quot;Before Sunrise&quot; represents a maturation of Linklater&#x27;s work in terms of its themes and choice of characters&quot;. In his review for &quot;The New Yorker&quot;, Anthony Lane wrote &quot;Just once, for a single day, Jesse and Céline have given life the sort of shape and charge that until now they have found only in fiction, and may never find again&quot;. &quot;Entertainment Weekly&quot; gave the film an &quot;A−&quot; rating and Owen Gleiberman wrote &quot;Small movies can be as daring as big ones, and Linklater, in his offhand way, is working without a net here. &quot;Before Sunrise&quot; may be the closest an American has come to the discursive talk gamesmanship of Eric Rohmer&quot;.

Online film critic James Berardinelli has cited the film as &quot;the best romance of all time&quot;. &quot;Entertainment Weekly&quot; rated &quot;Before Sunrise&quot; #25 on its Top 25 Modern Romances list. In a 2008 &quot;Empire&quot; poll, &quot;Before Sunrise&quot; was ranked as the 200th greatest movie of all time. In 2010 British newspaper &quot;The Guardian&quot; ranked &quot;Before Sunrise&quot;/&quot;Before Sunset&quot; #3 on its critics&#x27; list of 25 best romantic films of all time, and #2 in an online readers&#x27; poll.

===Box office===
The film grossed $1.4 million in 363 theaters on its opening weekend and grossed $5.5 million in the United States and Canada and $22.5 million worldwide, nine times its $2.5 million budget.

==Sequels==

&quot;Before Sunset&quot; was released in 2004 to equally positive reviews, and Rotten Tomatoes gives it a 95% &quot;Fresh&quot; rating. &quot;Before Midnight&quot; was released in 2013.

Jesse and Céline also had a brief scene together in Linklater&#x27;s 2001 animated film &quot;Waking Life&quot;.

<text>A-001 was the second abort test of the Apollo spacecraft.

==Objectives==
Mission A-001 was the second in the series of tests conducted to demonstrate that the launch escape system could safely remove the command module under critical abort conditions. Unlike Pad Abort Test 1, in which the launch escape system was ignited at ground level, this mission was flown to demonstrate the capability of the escape system to propel the command module safely away from a launch vehicle while in the high-dynamic-pressure (transonic) region of the Saturn trajectory.

The launch vehicle was the second in the series of Little Joe II vehicles, which had been developed to accomplish early and economical testing of the launch escape system. The Little Joe II was propelled by seven solid-propellant rocket motors - one Algol sustainer motor, which provided thrust for about 42 seconds, and six Recruit motors, which burned out approximately 1.5 seconds after ignition. The spacecraft consisted of a launch escape system and a boilerplate command and service module (BP-12).

==Flight==

Unacceptable wind conditions had forced a 24-hour postponement of the launch, but the vehicle was successfully launched on May 13, 1964, at 12:59:59.7 UTC (05:59 am MST). A ground commanded abort signal terminated thrust of the launch vehicle (by rupturing the Algol motor casing), ignited the launch escape and pitch control motors, and separated the command module from the service module. Some structural damage was incurred by the command module aft heat shield because of recontact with the booster at thrust termination. At approximately 44 seconds, the tower jettison motor was ignited and satisfactorily separated the launch escape tower from the command module.

The Earth landing sequence was normal until a riser for one of the three main parachutes broke as a result of its rubbing against the structure on the command module upper deck. The parachute separated; however, the command module, supported by the two remaining parachutes, descended at rates of instead of the predicted with three parachutes. The command module landed downrange at 350.2 seconds after attaining an altitude of above mean sea level. Except for the parachute failure, all test objectives were satisfied.

==Boilerplate location==
The boilerplate is currently located at the Columbia Memorial Space Center in Downey, California.

<doc id="805070" wikidata="Q6298800" url="?curid=805070" title="Juan Alejo de Arizmendi">
<text>Bishop Juan Alejo de Arizmendi (July 17, 1760 – October 12, 1814) was a patriot and the first Puerto Rican to be consecrated Bishop.

==Early years==
Arizmendi de la Torre (birth name: Juan Alejo de Arizmendi y de la Torre was born in San Juan, Puerto Rico, and there he studied in the convent of the Dominican Friars. He then went to Caracas, Venezuela. where he studied Canonical and Civil Law. He earned his doctorate in the Dominican Republic and on July 16, 1785, was ordained a priest.

==First Puerto Rican Bishop==
In 1803, the King of Spain, Carlos IV, made a petition to the Catholic Church, to have Arizmendi named Bishop. On March 25, 1804 Pope Pius VII consecrated Arizmendi, Bishop of San Juan.

Upon his return to Puerto Rico, Arizmendi dedicated himself to charity. He was especially interested in helping the poor and needy. Arizmendi financially supported the Hospital of the Conception of San Juan, with money from his own pockets. During his free time, he would make baskets of straw and sell them. He would then use the money to buy clothes, food and other items for the poor. Arizmendi, took it upon himself to nurse and to take care of the sick. He was the founder of the Conciliar Seminary in San Juan. In 1804, Rafael Cordero, a Puerto Rican of African ancestry who was to become known as &quot;The Father of Public Education in Puerto Rico&quot;, received the sacrament of Confirmation from the hands of Bishop Arizmendi.

==Patriot==
He was a stern supporter of Ramón Power y Giralt when this Puerto Rican-born veteran of the Spanish navy and past frigate Captain was elected to represent Puerto Rico in front of the Spanish Courts in Cadiz. Arizmendi gave Ramon Power his episcopal ring, &quot;as sure pledge that will sustain you in the memory of your resolution to protect and maintain the rights of our fellow countrymen, as I myself am resolved to die for my beloved flock&quot;. For Arizmendi this was also a national symbol of Puerto Rico by joining his country and God in his heart This occurred in 1809, and is the first known use of the word &quot;puertorriqueño&quot; (Puerto Rican). Arizmendi&#x27;s statement may have inspired the seizure in 1810 of all ecclesiastical stipends by the royal treasury.

In 1814, after traveling around the island in his second pastoral visit he fell ill in Hormigueros in whose Hermitage, now the Basilica Menor de la Virgen de Monserrate, he desired to be buried. Bishop Juan Alejo de Arizmendi died in the City of Arecibo, Puerto Rico on October 12, 1814. His remains are in the Cathedral of San Juan Bautista, in Puerto Rico.

==Honors and recognitions==
Arizmendi was immortalized by Puerto Rican artist Jose Campeche in a painting in 1803. Puerto Rico has honored Arizmendi&#x27;s memory by naming schools and avenues after him. The University of Puerto Rico has an Institute of Historic Studies Juan Alejo de Arizmendi. The Catholic Church also has a medal called the &quot;Bishop Juan Alejo de Arizmendi Medal&quot;.

<text>A picture cover is a type of book cover which uses a method of bookbinding that preserves the contents as well as a normal hardbound book, but has the look of a paperback book. The pages are collated, stitched and trimmed as for hardbound, but a cover with a picture on it is attached instead of the normal hardbound cover with printing on the spine, and perhaps also the front. A hardbound book can achieve a similar look with a dust cover, but the cover is fragile and inconvenient when reading, being most useful while the book is shelved.

The term &quot;picture cover&quot; is mostly used by book collectors. Many early series books and later children&#x27;s books have this binding, as do most modern textbooks.</text><links>

<text>School of Rock (titled onscreen as The School of Rock) is a 2003 comedy film directed by Richard Linklater, produced by Scott Rudin and written by Mike White. The film stars Jack Black, Joan Cusack, White and Sarah Silverman. Black plays struggling rock guitarist Dewey Finn, who is fired from his band and subsequently poses as a substitute teacher at a prestigious prep school. After witnessing the musical talent of the students, Dewey forms a band of fifth-graders to attempt to win the upcoming Battle of the Bands and use his winnings to pay his rent.

&quot;School of Rock&quot; was released on October 3, 2003 by Paramount Pictures, grossing $131 million worldwide on a $35 million budget. The film received positive reviews from critics, with praise for Black&#x27;s performance and humor. It was the highest-grossing music-themed comedy of all time until the release of &quot;Pitch Perfect 2&quot; in 2015. A stage musical adaptation opened on Broadway in December 2015, and a television adaptation aired for three seasons on Nickelodeon from March 2016 to April 2018.

==Plot==

Rock band No Vacancy performs at a nightclub three weeks before auditioning for the Battle of the Bands. Guitarist Dewey Finn creates on-stage antics, including an unsuccessful stage dive that abruptly ends the performance. The next morning, his roommate Ned Schneebly and Ned&#x27;s domineering girlfriend, Patty Di Marco, inform Dewey he must either pay his overdue share of the rent or move out. At a rehearsal session, Dewey is informed that he has been fired from No Vacancy and replaced by another guitarist, Spider. While trying to sell some of his equipment, Dewey answers a phone call from Rosalie Mullins, the principal of the Horace Green prep school, inquiring for Ned about a short-term position as a substitute teacher. Desperate for money, Dewey impersonates Ned and is hired. On his first day at the school, Dewey, who does not know how to spell &quot;Schneebly&quot;, adopts the name &quot;Mr. S&quot;. His erratic behavior confounds the students.

After observing the students&#x27; talent in music class, Dewey devises a plan to form a new band to audition for Battle of the Bands. He casts Zack Mooneyham as lead guitarist, Freddy Jones as drummer, cello player Katie as bassist, pianist Lawrence as keyboardist, and himself as lead vocalist and rhythm guitarist. He assigns the rest of the class to various roles of co-lead and backup singers, groupies and roadies, with overachiever Summer Hathaway as band manager. The project takes over normal lessons, but helps the students embrace their talents and overcome their insecurities, as well as realize that rock and roll can help them stand up for themselves. Dewey reassures Lawrence, who is worried about not being cool enough for the band; Zack, whose overbearing father disapproves of rock music; and Tomika, an overweight girl who is too self-conscious to audition for co-lead and backup singer despite having a powerful voice. &quot;Groupies&quot; Michelle and Eleni, with Summer&#x27;s approval, name the band &quot;The School of Rock&quot;.

Dewey sneaks the key band members out of school for the audition while the rest of the class stay behind to maintain cover. Despite the bill being full, the band is accepted after Summer tricks the staff into thinking that the kids are terminally ill. The next day, Rosalie decides to check on Dewey&#x27;s teaching progress, forcing him to attempt to teach the students actual academic material (using his guitar as a teaching aid). The day before Battle of the Bands, Ned receives a paycheck from the school via mail and realizes that Dewey impersonated him. During a parents&#x27; meeting at the school, the parents of the students question Dewey&#x27;s teaching methods. Ned, Patty and the police later arrive and confront him. When Rosalie appears, Dewey reveals his true identity and admits he is not a licensed teacher before fleeing. At home, a disappointed Ned reluctantly tells Dewey that he should move out.

The next day, the parents angrily confront Rosalie at her office. Not wanting their hard work to go to waste, the kids sneak out of the school and direct a bus to take them to pick up Dewey. They drive to the competition, while back at the school, the new substitute discovers the kids are missing. Rosalie and the parents race to the competition. Meanwhile, Ned stands up to Patty, breaks up with her and goes to Battle of the Bands. Backstage, Dewey proposes that they play a song Zack had written earlier. Immediately following No Vacancy, School of Rock plays Zack&#x27;s song and wins over the crowd. Although No Vacancy is declared the winner, the School of Rock is praised by the audience, who call for an encore. Though initially upset at the deception, the parents admit to being impressed by the kids&#x27; talent and confidence on stage, with Rosalie even becoming ecstatic.

Some time later, an after-school program known as the School of Rock opens and Summer has obtained many offers for shows and record deals from the band. Dewey now has his own residence and works as a music coach for the students, while Ned, having rediscovered his passion for rock music, teaches beginner students.

==Production==
Screenwriter Mike White&#x27;s concept for the film was inspired by &quot;The Langley Schools Music Project&quot;. Jack Black once witnessed a stage dive gone wrong involving Ian Astbury of rock band The Cult, which made its way into the film. Filming began on December 2, 2002. Many scenes from the movie were shot around the New York City area. The school portrayed in &quot;School of Rock&quot; is actually Main Hall at Wagner College in Staten Island. In the DVD commentary, the kids say that all of the hallway scenes were shot in one hallway. One of the theaters used in many of the shots was at Union County Performing Arts Center located in Rahway, New Jersey.

===Soundtrack===

The eponymous album was released on September 30, 2003. Sammy James Jr. of the band The Mooney Suzuki penned the title track with screenwriter Mike White, and the band backed up Jack Black and the child musicians on the soundtrack recording of the song. The film&#x27;s director, Richard Linklater, scouted the country for talented 13-year-old musicians to play the rock and roll music featured on the soundtrack and in the film. The soundtrack includes &quot;Immigrant Song&quot; by Led Zeppelin, a band that has a very long history of denying permission for use of their songs in film and television. Linklater came up with the idea to shoot a video on the stage used at the film&#x27;s ending, in which Jack Black begs the band for permission with the crowd extras cheering and chanting behind him. The video was sent directly to the living members of Led Zeppelin (Jimmy Page, Robert Plant, and John Paul Jones), who granted permission for the song. The video is included on the DVD and Blu-ray.

In its second weekend, the film declined just 21 percent, earning another $15,487,832 after expanding to 2,929 theaters, averaging $5,288 per venue and bringing the ten-day gross to $39,671,396.

This made &quot;School of Rock&quot; the highest-grossing music-themed comedy of all time, until it was overtaken in 2015 by &quot;Pitch Perfect 2&quot;.

===Critical response===
&quot;School of Rock&quot; received an approval rating of 92% on Rotten Tomatoes based on 202 reviews with an average rating of 7.7/10. The site&#x27;s critical consensus reads, &quot;Black&#x27;s exuberant, gleeful performance turns &quot;School of Rock&quot; into a hilarious, rocking good time.&quot; On Metacritic, the film has a score of 82 out of 100, based on 41 critics, indicating &quot;universal acclaim&quot;.

Rating the film 3.5 stars out of 4, Roger Ebert wrote that &quot;School of Rock&quot; &quot;proves you can make a family film that&#x27;s alive and well acted and smart and perceptive and funny—and that rocks.&quot;

In 2024, &quot;Looper&quot; ranked it number 41 on its list of the &quot;50 Best PG-13 Movies of All Time,&quot; writing &quot;As a feel-good movie for the whole family, its powerful messaging of championing creativity, self-expression, and the pursuit of passion leaves viewers of all ages with a sense of joy and optimism after every viewing.&quot;

===Awards and nominations===
The film was nominated for several awards, including Black receiving a Golden Globe Award nomination for Best Actor – Comedy or Musical (which he lost to Bill Murray for &quot;Lost in Translation&quot;), and winning an MTV Movie Award for Best Comedic Performance. In 2004, the film won Best Comedy Film at the British Comedy Awards.

==Legacy==

===Possible sequel===
In 2008, Jack Black said that a sequel was being considered. It was later reported that director Richard Linklater and producer Scott Rudin would return. Mike White was returning as screenwriter for the sequel, titled &quot;School of Rock 2: America Rocks&quot;, which picks up with Finn leading a group of summer school students on a cross-country field trip that delves into the history of rock &#x27;n&#x27; roll. In 2012, Black stated that he believed the sequel was unlikely, saying, &quot;I tried really hard to get all the pieces together. I wouldn&#x27;t want to do it without the original writer and director, and we never all got together and saw eye-to-eye on what the script would be. It was not meant to be, unfortunately,&quot; but added, &quot;never say never&quot;. Consequently to the latter statement, in 2023, Black revealed during an interview that a direct sequel film to &quot;School of Rock&quot; was in development along with a &quot;Tenacious D&quot; film, saying, &quot;Yup. Both of them. Breaking news. We&#x27;re thinking about doing both of those.&quot;.

===Stage adaptation===

On April 5, 2013, Andrew Lloyd Webber announced that he had bought the rights to &quot;School of Rock&quot; for a stage musical. On December 18, 2014, the musical was officially confirmed and it was announced that the show would receive its world premiere on Broadway in autumn 2015, at the Winter Garden Theatre. It ultimately began previews on November 9, 2015, and opened on December 6, 2015. The musical has a book by &quot;Downton Abbey&quot; creator Julian Fellowes, and is directed by Laurence Connor, with choreography by JoAnn M. Hunter, set and costume design by Anna Louizos and lighting by Natasha Katz. The musical features an original score composed by Lloyd Webber, with lyrics by Glenn Slater and sound design by Mick Potter, in addition to music from the original film. &quot;School of Rock&quot; became Lloyd Webber&#x27;s first show opening on Broadway before London since &quot;Jesus Christ Superstar&quot; in 1971. The stage adaptation eventually closed on January 20, 2019, having grossed $160,145,109 over the course of 1,309 performances.

===10-year reunion===
On August 29, 2013, a 10th-anniversary screening of the film was held in Austin, Texas, at the Paramount Theatre. Those in attendance included director Richard Linklater, Jack Black, Mike White, Miranda Cosgrove and the rest of the young cast members, except for Cole Hawkins (who played Leonard). Hosted by the Austin Film Society and Cirrus Logic, the event included a red carpet, a full cast and crew Q&amp;A after the screening, where the now-grown child stars discussed their current pursuits in life, and a VIP after-party performance by the School of Rock band during which &quot;School of Rock&quot;, &quot;The Legend of The Rent&quot;, &quot;Step Off&quot; and &quot;It&#x27;s a Long Way to the Top (If You Wanna Rock &#x27;n&#x27; Roll)&quot; were played.

===Television adaptation===

On August 4, 2014, Nickelodeon announced that it was working with Paramount Television to develop a television show adaptation of the film. Production started in the fall and the series premiered in 2016. It starred Breanna Yde, Ricardo Hurtado, Jade Pettyjohn, Lance Lim, Aidan Miner and Tony Cavalero. The series adaptation of &quot;School of Rock&quot; ran for three seasons from March 12, 2016 to April 8, 2018.

<text>Friedrich August Karl Ferdinand Julius von Holstein (24 April 1837 – 8 May 1909) was a civil servant of the German Empire and served as the head of the political department of the German Foreign Office for more than thirty years. He played a major role in shaping foreign policy after Bismarck was dismissed in 1890.

==Biography==

Holstein was born in Schwedt, Province of Brandenburg on 24 April 1837, the son of a Prussian military officer August Friedrich Carl Ernst Leopold von Holstein (1800-1863) and Karoline von Brünnow (1791-1858). He studied jurisprudence at the Frederick William University of Berlin, from which he was graduated in 1856. Holstein joined the diplomatic service and in 1860 became an attaché at the Prussian embassy in Saint Petersburg under the authority of Otto von Bismarck and later served as a member of the legations at Rio de Janeiro, London, Washington, Florence, and Copenhagen. During his time at Washington, 1866–1867, his relationship with Alice Mason Hooper, wife of Senator Charles Sumner, was a source of speculation. It is not clear if their relationship became romantic. The married couple soon became separated. Holstein was recalled back to Berlin around the time of the separation. It was believed that Sumner sent a letter to Bismarck informing him of Holstein&#x27;s close relationship with Alice; however, there is no record of any letter in any archives and Sumner would later deny that he sent any such letter.

With the establishment of the German Empire in 1871, Holstein became secretary of the ambassador in Paris, Harry von Arnim. Von Arnim was a patroniser of the French royalists and a fierce opponent of Chancellor Bismarck, who finally enforced Arnim&#x27;s discharge and conviction for breach of secrecy. Holstein returned to Berlin, where he assumed office as legation secretary in the &quot;Auswärtiges Amt&quot; in 1876, both an essential and a suspiciously eyed associate of Bismarck, who behind his back called him a &quot;hyena&quot;. Holstein&#x27;s career as an &quot;éminence grise&quot; was promoted by Bismarck&#x27;s dismissal in 1890. The new chancellor, Leo von Caprivi, was ignorant of foreign affairs; and Holstein, as a repository of the Bismarckian tradition, became indispensable.

Holstein remained a bachelor all his life, regarded as a skillful though devious man. His reluctance to emerge into publicity has been ascribed to the part he had played under Bismarck in the Arnim scandal, which had made him powerful enemies; it was, however, possibly due to a shrinking from the responsibility of office. Yet the weakness of his position lay just in the fact that he was not ultimately responsible. He protested against the despatch of the Kruger telegram, but protested in vain. On the other hand, where his ideas were acceptable, he was generally able to realize them.

Thus, it was as Political Secretary to the Foreign Office that he determined policy in the 1890s. It was almost entirely due to him that Germany acquired Tsingtao (now Qingdao) and asserted German interests in China; the acquisition of Samoa was also largely his work. If the skill and pertinacity with which Holstein carried through his plans in these matters was learned in the school of Bismarck, he had not acquired Bismarck&#x27;s faculty for foreseeing their ultimate consequences. This is seen by blunders made on the abandonment of the Reinsurance Treaty with Russia in 1890, his Chinese policy, and also of his part in the Moroccan crisis which led to the Algeciras Conference in 1906. The Kaiser&#x27;s journey to Tangier was undertaken on his advice, as a protest against the supposed attempt at Germany&#x27;s isolation. Holstein did not approve the later developments of German policy in the Morocco, on the ground that the result would merely be to strengthen the Anglo-French entente. From 12 March 1906 onward he took no active part in the matter and resigned one month later.

To the last he believed that Germany&#x27;s position would remain unsafe until an understanding had been arrived at with Britain, and it was this belief that determined his attitude towards the expansion of the Imperial Navy: beside this, he wrote in February 1909, all other questions were of lesser account. His views on this question were summarized in a memorandum of December 1907, of which Rath gives a résumé: Holstein objected to the programme of Admiral Alfred von Tirpitz and the Navy League on three main grounds: the ill-feeling likely to be aroused in South Germany, the inevitable dislocation of the finances through the huge additional charges involved, and the suspicion of Germany&#x27;s motives in foreign countries, which would bind Britain still closer to France. As for the idea that Germany&#x27;s power would be increased, he wrote in reply to a letter from Tirpitz&#x27;s opponent Admiral Karl Galster, this was a simple question of arithmetic: for how would the sea-power of Germany be relatively increased if for every new German ship Britain built two?
Holstein died on 8 May 1909 in Berlin and his body was buried in the Invalidenfriedhof Cemetery. His assets included extensive secret dossiers concerning German statesmen that were not published until 1956. Rumours that he may have been an informant of journalist Maximilian Harden in the Harden-Eulenburg Affair have never been conclusively established.

<doc id="805120" wikidata="Q652186" url="?curid=805120" title="Before Sunset">
<text>Before Sunset is a 2004 American romantic drama film directed by Richard Linklater, who co-wrote the screenplay with Ethan Hawke and Julie Delpy, from a story by Linklater and Kim Krizan. It is the first film by Warner Independent Pictures. The sequel to &quot;Before Sunrise&quot; (1995) and the second installment in the &quot;Before&quot; trilogy, &quot;Before Sunset&quot; follows Jesse (Hawke) and Céline (Delpy) as they reunite nine years later in Paris.

Linklater, Krizan, Hawke, and Delpy began developing a larger budget sequel in the 1990s, but failed to secure funding to begin production. After writing the film independently, with portions inspired by Hawke&#x27;s divorce from Uma Thurman, the writers came together in 2003 and incorporated elements of their individual screenplays, as well as other scenes written during development of &quot;Before Sunrise&quot;, to create the final screenplay. Principal photography took place entirely in Paris, and the film is considered to take place in real time. Delpy also contributed original music to the film&#x27;s soundtrack.

&quot;Before Sunset&quot; premiered at the Berlin International Film Festival on February 10, 2004, and was theatrically released in the United States on July 2, 2004. It grossed $15 million worldwide and received widespread critical acclaim, particularly for Linklater&#x27;s direction, the performances and chemistry of its leads, and its screenplay. It received numerous accolades, being nominated for the Academy Award for Best Adapted Screenplay, and appeared on many publications&#x27; lists of the best films of the year, with some calling it one of the best of the decade. It was followed by a third film, &quot;Before Midnight&quot;, in 2013.

==Plot==
Nine years after meeting Céline in Vienna, Jesse has written a bestselling novel, &quot;This Time&quot;, based on their time together. During a book tour in Europe, he does a reading at Shakespeare and Company, where three journalists interview him: one is convinced the novel&#x27;s characters meet again, another that they do not, and a third who wants them to but is doubtful that will occur. Céline also attends the reading.

Required to leave for the airport in an hour, Jesse and Céline use the time to roam Paris. Their conversations soon become deeply personal, and they passionately discuss work, politics and lament their failure to meet again in Vienna or exchange contact details. Céline informs she did not return as her grandmother died, and Jesse claims that he did not return either; after Céline asks him why he did not, he confesses that he did return.

They reveal how their lives have changed in the nine years apart: Jesse is married and has a son named Hank, while Céline works for an environmental non-governmental organization and is in a relationship with a photojournalist. Their old romantic feelings become slowly rekindled while walking around Paris. Jesse says his novel was inspired by the hope of seeing Céline again, and she says that reading it caused painful memories. They both admit that their previous night together had profoundly affected their perceptions of love, leading to dissatisfaction in both of their lives as Céline has had difficulty maintaining relationships while Jesse’s marriage is deeply strained.

Céline and Jesse arrive at her apartment, even after continuous insistence that Jesse should not miss his flight. Jesse persuades her to play a waltz on her guitar, which she wrote about their encounter in Vienna. Jesse plays Nina Simone&#x27;s &quot;Just in Time&quot; on her stereo, which Céline dances to as he watches, the pair acknowledging he will miss his flight.

==Cast==
==Production==
After the filming of &quot;Before Sunrise&quot;, Linklater, Krizan, Hawke, and Delpy discussed making a sequel. Linklater considered a version to be filmed in four locations and with a much larger budget. When his proposal did not secure funding, he scaled back the concept of the movie. In a 2010 interview, Hawke said that the four had worked on several potential scripts over the years. As time passed and they did not secure funding, they adapted elements of the earlier scripts for &quot;Before Sunrise&quot; in their final draft of &quot;Before Sunset.&quot;

Linklater described the process of completing the final version of the film as:

Hawke said, &quot;It&#x27;s not like anybody was begging us to make a second film. We obviously did it because we wanted to.&quot;

The movie was filmed entirely on location in Paris. It opens inside the Shakespeare and Company bookstore on the Left Bank. Other locations include their walking through the Marais district of the 4th arrondissement, Le Pure Café in the 11th arrondissement, the Promenade Plantée park in the 12th arrondissement, on board a &quot;bateau mouche&quot; from Quai de la Tournelle to Quai Henri IV, the interior of a taxi, and finally &quot;Céline&#x27;s apartment.&quot; Described in the film as located at 10 rue des Petites-Écuries, it was filmed in Cour de l&#x27;Étoile d&#x27;Or off rue du Faubourg St-Antoine.

The movie was filmed in 15 days, on a budget of about US$2–2.7 million. The film is noted for its use of the Steadicam for tracking shots and its use of long takes; the longest of the Steadicam takes lasts about 11 minutes. As the summer was one of the hottest on record, the cast and crew suffered along with the city residents, as temperatures exceeded 100 degrees F (38 °C) for most of the production.

The film is notable for essentially taking place in real time, i.e. the time elapsed in the story is the run time of the film. In the fast-changing temperate Paris climate, this created challenges for the cinematographer Lee Daniel to match the color and intensity of the skies and ambient light from scene to scene. The scenes were mostly shot in sequence, as they were still developing the screenplay. Producer Anne Walker-McBay worked with less time and less money than she had on &quot;Before Sunrise&quot;, but still brought the film in on time and on budget. The sequel was released nine years after &quot;Before Sunrise&quot;, the same amount of time that has lapsed in the plot since the events of the first film.

The film was released in the wake of Hawke&#x27;s divorce from Uma Thurman. Some commentators drew parallels between Hawke&#x27;s personal life and the character of Jesse in the film. Additional comment has noted that both Hawke and Delpy incorporated elements of their own lives into the screenplay. Delpy wrote two of the songs featured in the film, and a third by her was included in the closing credits and movie soundtrack.

==Release==
&quot;Before Sunset&quot; premiered at the Berlin International Film Festival in February 2004, and received a limited release in the United States on July 2, 2004.

===Box office===
In its opening weekend, the film grossed $219,425 in 20 theaters in the United States, averaging $10,971 per theater. During its entire theatrical run, the film grossed $5.8 million in the United States and nearly $16 million worldwide.

===Critical reception===
On Rotten Tomatoes, &quot;Before Sunset&quot; holds an approval rating of 94% based on 177 reviews, with an average rating of 8.30/10. The site&#x27;s critics consensus reads, &quot;Filled with engaging dialogue, &quot;Before Sunset&quot; is a witty, poignant romance, with natural chemistry between Hawke and Delpy.&quot; On Metacritic, the film has a weighted average score of 91 out of 100 based on 39 reviews from mainstream publications, indicating &quot;universal acclaim&quot;. The film appeared on 28 critics&#x27; top 10 lists of the best films of 2004, and took the 27th spot on Metacritic&#x27;s list of The Best-Reviewed Movies of the Decade (2000–09).

In comparing this film to its predecessor, American film critic Roger Ebert wrote, &quot;&quot;Before Sunrise&quot; was a remarkable celebration of the fascination of good dialogue. But &quot;Before Sunset&quot; is better, perhaps because the characters are older and wiser, perhaps because they have more to lose (or win), and perhaps because Hawke and Delpy wrote the dialogue themselves.&quot; In her review for the &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot;, Manohla Dargis lauded the film as a &quot;deeper, truer work of art than the first,&quot; and praised director Linklater for making a film that &quot;keeps faith with American cinema at its finest.&quot;

Reviewing the acting, Peter Travers of &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; observed, &quot;Hawke and Delpy find nuance, art and eroticism in words, spoken and unspoken. The actors shine.&quot; Philip French of &quot;The Observer&quot; wrote,

On the merits of the script, A. O. Scott of &quot;The New York Times&quot; noted, it was &quot;sometimes maddening,&quot; but &quot;also enthralling, precisely because of its casual disregard for the usual imperatives of screenwriting.&quot; He elaborated,

In the United Kingdom, the film was ranked the 110th-greatest movie of all time by a 2008 &quot;Empire&quot; poll. In 2010, the critics at &quot;The Guardian&quot; placed &quot;Before Sunrise/Before Sunset&quot; at number 3 in their list of the best romantic films of all time, and called the ending of &quot;Before Sunset&quot; &quot;one of the most tantalising and ingenious endings in all cinema.&quot;

In a video interview in November 2011, Hawke said that he, Delpy and Linklater &quot;have been talking a lot in the last six months... all three of us have been having similar feelings that we&#x27;re kind of ready to revisit those characters... there&#x27;s nine years between the first two movies... if we made the film next summer, it would be nine years again, so we started thinking that would be a good thing to do. So we&#x27;re going to try and write it this year.&quot; In June 2012, Hawke confirmed that the sequel to &quot;Before Sunset&quot; would be filmed in summer 2012. In September 2012, it was announced the sequel, titled &quot;Before Midnight&quot;, had completed filming and would premiere at the Sundance Film Festival in January 2013. The film was released in May to widespread acclaim, and received an Academy Award nomination for Best Adapted Screenplay.

<doc id="805130" wikidata="Q1735699" url="?curid=805130" title="Miss Match">
<text>Miss Match is an American comedy-drama television series created by Jeff Rake and Darren Star and produced by 20th Century Fox Television, Darren Star Productions, and Imagine Television. It aired in the United States on NBC from September 26 to December 15, 2003, including international networks aired in Australia on Seven Network, Arena, and Fox8, and in the United Kingdom on Living, Channel 4, and is on E4. Seventeen episodes of the series were filmed, with eleven aired in the United States. The entire series aired in both the UK and Canada.

Starring Alicia Silverstone and Ryan O&#x27;Neal, the show garnered poor ratings, which could have been due to its inability to compete in the Friday 8 pm ET timeslot (the &quot;Friday night death slot&quot;). It was based on the real-life story of Samantha Daniels.

==Premise==
A Los Angeles matrimonial attorney, Kate Fox (Alicia Silverstone), doubles as a high-end matchmaker even though her own love life is far from perfect.

==Cast and characters==
===Main===

* Alicia Silverstone as Kate Fox: A divorce lawyer by day who ends up becoming a match maker. Her own romantic life is complicated. Throughout the series she is involved with Michael and later his best friend, Adam. Kate often finds herself getting involved in the relationships she sets up for people. Various characters mention to her that she is addicted to love and lives through the lives of others.
* Lake Bell as Victoria Carlson: Kate&#x27;s best friend who is a bartender. She often oversees the dates Kate sets people up with. She tends to only have flings with men, like the one she starts with Nick. The only man we see her like as more than a hookup is Adam.
* David Conrad as Michael Mendelson: Kate&#x27;s on and off again boyfriend after she sets him up on several dates. His ex-girlfriend is Lauren who left him for his best friend Adam.
* Jodi Long as Claire: A secretary at Fox &amp; Associates.
* James Roday as Nick Paine: Kate&#x27;s co-worker who is a womanizer. He and Kate tolerate each other, at best. He later dates Victoria.
* Ryan O&#x27;Neal as Jerry Fox: Kate&#x27;s father who owned the law firm she works for. He was not a perfect father to Kate but they bonded over law. He is shown to still have feelings for Kate&#x27;s mother but is not hung up on her. Later in the series he is linked with Serena.

===Recurring===
* Charisma Carpenter as Serena Lockner: An old classmate of Kate who comes back into her life. Kate helps her adopt a baby and give it back to the mother when she realizes she made a mistake. She later returns and starts a romance with Kate&#x27;s father.
* Dina Meyer as Lauren Logan: Michael&#x27;s ex-girlfriend and Adam&#x27;s ex-wife. After finding out that Michael and Kate are involved, she makes Kate break it off. After finding out Adam and Kate are involved, she sues Kate&#x27;s law firm for malpractice.
* Nathan Fillion as Adam Logan: Adam comes to town after Lauren hires Kate as her divorce lawyer. He and Michael end up repairing their friendship but he soon becomes involved with Kate and Victoria.

NBC had a cross promotion where Deanna Wright, Galen Gering and McKenzie Westmore, who starred on NBC&#x27;s soap opera &quot;Passions&quot;, appeared in an episode of the series.

==Episodes==
== Production ==
The series was executive produced by Darren Star, who also directed the pilot, and Jeff Rake, who wrote the pilot, as well as David Nevins and Brian Grazer. After Alicia Silverstone, the first actors cast in &quot;Miss Match&quot; were David Conrad, Lake Bell and James Roday in February 2003. This was followed by the casting of Ryan O&#x27;Neal, as the divorce attorney father of Silverstone&#x27;s character, and Jodi Long, in early March 2003.

NBC ordered &quot;Miss Match&quot; (then titled &quot;Miss/Match&quot;) to series in May 2003. In December 2003 NBC added four episodes to the order for &quot;Miss Match&quot;, bringing the total number of produced episodes to 17.

== Reception ==
Based on 12 reviews, the show holds an 83% approval rating on review aggregator Rotten Tomatoes. The critics consensus reads, &quot;With the incredibly charming Alicia Silverstone at the helm, &quot;Miss Match&quot; is a sweet romantic comedy with echoes of &quot;Sex and the City&quot;.&quot;

<doc id="805139" wikidata="Q8026137" url="?curid=805139" title="Winston Tong">
<text>Winston Tong (born 1951 in San Francisco, California) is an actor, playwright, visual artist, puppeteer, and singer-songwriter. He is best known for his vocals in Tuxedomoon and for winning an Obie award in puppetry for &quot;Bound Feet&quot; in 1978.

==Early years==
Tong was born in the United States to Chinese parents exiled by the Communist revolution. He graduated with a degree in theatre from the California Institute of Arts in 1973. While at CalArts, he studied classical vocals with Marni Nixon. In 1969, Tong was commissioned to illustrate &quot;The Dinosaur Coloring Book&quot; by Malcolm Whyte, which was first published by Troubador Press and later by Price Stern Sloan.

==Performance art==
After graduating from California Institute of the Arts, Tong established his reputation in the Bay Area with a string of charismatic, left-field performance pieces such as &quot;Wild Boys&quot;, &quot;Eliminations&quot;, &quot;Frankie and Johnnie&quot; and the award-winning &quot;Bound Feet&quot;, which was loosely based on traditional Chinese puppet theater. 

Tong performed three of his solo pieces at La MaMa Experimental Theatre Club in April/May 1978. &quot;The Wild Boys&quot;, identified on the show&#x27;s program as a work in progress, incorporated work by William Burroughs, Brian Eno, George Olsen, Kawahara, Victoria Lowe, and Tuxedomoon. &quot;Bound Feet&quot; incorporated music by Erik Satie. &quot;À Rimbaud&quot; incorporated work by Arthur Rimbaud and Heitor Villa-Lobos. He returned to La MaMa with Tuxedomoon bandmate Bruce Geduldig in 1978 to perform two pieces, &quot;Nijinsky (Fragments)&quot; from the diary of Vaslav Nijinsky with music by Frederic Chopin and &quot;Bound Feet (Reformed)&quot;.

&quot;Frankie and Johnnie&quot; appeared in the 1981 documentary film &quot;Theater in Trance&quot; by Rainer Werner Fassbinder, who shot the film at the Theaters of the World Festival in June 1981 in Cologne. Geduldig directed himself and Tong in a production of &quot;Frankie and Johnnie&quot; at La MaMa Experimental Theatre Club in 1982.

==Musical career==
Tong joined Tuxedomoon in 1977. He sporadically recorded and performed live with the group, and also recorded solo material including the electropop dance album &quot;Theoretically Chinese&quot; in 1985, a 9-song album produced by Alan Rankine featuring guests such as Stephen Morris of New Order, Dave Formula, and Jah Wobble, as well as many other familiar musicians from Tong&#x27;s past. The album and its subsequent singles, &quot;Theoretical China&quot; and &quot;Reports From The Heart&quot;, were released on Les Disques du Crepuscule.

His composition &quot;In a Manner of Speaking&quot; from 1985&#x27;s &quot;Holy Wars&quot; was later covered by Martin Gore, Nouvelle Vague, and Amanda Palmer, and remains his best known song. Tong left Tuxedomoon in 1985.

In March 2005, Tong reunited with Tuxedomoon for two performances in San Francisco, the first time they had performed together in over twenty years.

Tong&#x27;s career, including his solo work, is detailed in Isabelle Corbisier&#x27;s 2008 book on Tuxedomoon, &quot;Music for Vagabonds – the Tuxedomoon Chronicles&quot;.

<text>Flor Ramos Contemplacion (7 January 1953 – 17 March 1995) was a Filipina domestic worker who was executed in Singapore after being convicted of murdering a fellow Filipina maid and the three-year-old boy whom she was babysitting. At the time, her case as well as her eventual sentencing severely strained diplomatic relations between the Philippines and Singapore, although relations soon recovered.

==Biography==
Flor Contemplacion was born in San Pablo City in the Laguna province of Luzon, and was the second youngest of ten children. Her father died when she was 7 years old, and due to the increased financial pressure on her rural family she moved to Manila to live with an elder sister when she was 10 years old. Contemplacion dropped out of school aged 12 and soon after began working as a housemaid. Contemplacion got married in 1972 when she was 19 years old and eventually had four children. Her husband walked out on the family in 1987, leaving Contemplacion as the sole breadwinner.
In 1988, she travelled to Singapore in search of work to support her young family, eventually finding employment as a domestic servant in the Cardiff Road area of Serangoon. Contemplacion often worked seven days a week from 6am until midnight, doing household chores and looking after her employer&#x27;s child.

== Background to arrest ==

On 4 May 1991, Delia Mamaril Maga (born on 6 October 1955, in Tarlac), a 34-year-old Filipino domestic worker, was found strangled to death in a five bedroom apartment on the ninth floor of HDB Block 147 on Gangsa Road in Bukit Panjang. A three-year-old boy, Nicholas Huang, whom Maga had been taking care of, was discovered lying next to her having been drowned in a bucket of water. The victims&#x27; bodies were discovered by Huang&#x27;s parents, who had employed Maga for the previous 4 years, after they had arrived home to their apartment shortly after 1pm. Their two-year-old daughter was located unharmed in Maga&#x27;s locked bedroom.

Singaporean police investigating the crime scene found no signs of a struggle or any ransacking of the flat, which combined with the fact the front door grille was locked when the owners returned home suggested that Maga knew her killer and granted them entry to the apartment. Interviews with neighbor Lucrecia Galuga revealed that she last saw Maga and the two children alive at 10am, and Maga had mentioned that a friend was due to visit her later on that morning. Detectives then began to identify, locate and question all of Maga&#x27;s known associates in Singapore.

At around 7pm, police arrested 38-year-old Filipino citizen Flor Ramos Contemplacion at HDB Block 633 on Veerasamy Road in Kallang, after eliminating all other suspects from their enquiries. Contemplacion was found in possession of luxury items (seven watches, a Konica Minolta brand camera and a pearl necklace) that were believed to have been stolen from Maga. Investigations revealed that Contemplacion had visited Maga at the apartment in Bukit Panjang several times before and had met Nicholas Huang on those occasions. This fact raised the possibility that Contemplacion killed Huang and Maga to prevent her being identified, however the life of the two-year-old girl was spared as she was unable to speak due to her young age.

During her interrogation by the police, Contemplacion claimed to have left her employer&#x27;s house on Cardiff Road the previous morning to deliver a package to her niece at Don Long Mansion in Katong, but she was not at home when Contemplacion arrived. However, when the police contacted the owner of the apartment to check Contemplacion&#x27;s alibi he denied she had visited the property. On the afternoon of 6 May 1991, Contemplacion finally confessed to killing both victims and gave two statements to police via a Tagalog interpreter. That evening, investigating officers brought Contemplacion and the interpreter to the crime scene on Gangsa Road, where she described to the detectives how she was admitted to the apartment by Maga and what happened inside on the day of the murders. On 7 May 1991, Contemplacion was charged with the double murder of Delia Mamaril Maga and Nicholas Huang and then remanded in custody to await trial.

== Trial ==
On 26 January 1993, Contemplacion&#x27;s trial began in the High Court of Singapore before Justice T. S. Sinnathuray. In her opening speech, Deputy Public Prosecutor Kamala Ponnampalam described how the victim&#x27;s dead bodies were discovered by Huang&#x27;s parents, who after failing to resuscitate Nicholas then called the police. Investigating officers examined Maga&#x27;s personal diary and discovered the name and address of Flor Contemplacion, who was then located and questioned. Testimony by forensic pathologist Doctor Wee Keng Poh revealed that Maga died from asphyxia due to strangulation and Huang&#x27;s death had been caused by drowning. According to the expert witness, another person had used an elastic cord wound around Maga&#x27;s neck to apply moderate force for approximately 5 minutes, while the immersion of a young child&#x27;s face in water for a similar time would cause them to drown.

Contemplacion&#x27;s lawyer Ng Wing Cheong challenged the admissibility of five statements she gave to police after her arrest, asserting that they were made under duress while she was fatigued after hours of intensive questioning by detectives. During cross examination, Contemplacion claimed police used a picture of the Virgin Mary to frighten her into incriminating herself, as being a Catholic her belief was sinners would not go to Heaven. Contemplacion also claimed she was not informed of her right to have a lawyer present prior to giving the statements, and that detectives shouted and screamed at her that she would be hanged if she did not tell the truth. 

However, Contemplacion conceded to the prosecutor that all statements were made voluntarily without any threat, inducement or promise being made before or during the recording of the statements by Tagalog interpreter Aurora Navarro (who was provided by the Philippine Embassy in Singapore) or herself. DPP Ponnampalam countered there was no evidence the Special Investigations Section had such a picture in their office, and that the police officers who interrogated Contemplacion confirmed that no pictures were shown to her during her questioning. Justice T.S Sinnathuray therefore ruled all five statements were given voluntarily and could be admitted as evidence.

The prosecution thereafter submitted as evidence the statements made by Contemplacion, where she described making friends with Maga in June 1990. On the morning of the murders, Contemplacion went to the apartment in Bukit Panjang to meet Maga, as she wanted to hand over a parcel that Maga would deliver to her parents during her upcoming holiday to the Philippines. However, Maga refused to take the package with her, saying it was too heavy to bring on the airplane. While Contemplacion was talking to Maga, she suddenly had a psychotic episode where she broke out into a cold sweat and felt the urge to harm Maga. Contemplacion then strangled Maga from behind with an elastic cord and when she was dead dragged her body into a bathroom. There she discovered Nicholas playing with toys in a bucket of water, and Contemplacion grasped him by the upper body and dunked his head under the water until he stopped moving. Contemplacion then grabbed some of Maga&#x27;s possessions and fled the apartment.

At the close of the prosecution&#x27;s case, Justice T.S Sinnathuray declared that prima facie evidence had been established against the accused and called on Contemplacion to make her defence against the charge of murdering Della Maga and Nicholas Huang. However, when called to the stand, Contemplacion opted to remain silent. Justice T.S Sinnathuray warned Contemplacion that if the prosecution&#x27;s case was unrebutted it would warrant a conviction on both murder charges, and her legal team also explained the consequences to her. When Justice T.S Sinnathuray thereafter invited the defence legal team to rebut the accusations against Contemplacion, her lead counsel Ng Wing Cheong informed the court that in light of his client&#x27;s refusal to give evidence he had decided not to call any witnesses or make any submissions on her behalf either. DPP Ponnampalam also declined to present any arguments due to the stance of the defence team.

== Verdict ==
On the afternoon of 29 January 1993, Flor Contemplacion was found guilty as charged and sentenced to death for the murder of Delia Mamaril Maga and Nicholas Huang, in accordance with Section 302 of the Penal Code of Singapore.Justice T.S Sinnathuray remarked that he was &quot;satisfied beyond all reasonable doubt&quot; that the prosecution had proved their case against her. When the death sentence was announced, Contemplacion broke down into tears and was so distraught she had to be supported by two prison officers as she was led from the dock.

== Appeals ==
On 26 January 1994, defence lawyer Sant Singh raised the defence of diminished responsibility during a hearing at the Court of Appeal in regards to Contemplacion&#x27;s conviction, stating that the issue of her mental state was never raised during her original trial and new exculpatory evidence had since come to light regarding her psychiatric condition during the murders. An affidavit containing observations from Gleneagles Hospital consultant psychiatrist Doctor Terence Burke, who had studied the case in detail and since examined Contemplacion personally, was requested to be submitted by Singh. The appeal judges thereafter suspended the hearing and ordered that the original trial judge re-open the case and review the new evidence.

=== Retrial ===
On 25 April 1994, Justice T. S. Sinnathuray heard arguments in the High Court regarding Contemplacion&#x27;s appeal. Taking the stand to give evidence in her own defence, Contemplacion claimed to have suffered from seizures from an early age, which gave her bouts of headaches and uncontrollable shaking. She also claimed that on the day of the murders a mysterious &quot;voice&quot; instructed her to visit Maga at the Bukit Panjang apartment. Contemplacion testified that on the way to the apartment she began to feel strange and started trembling all over. When she got there Maga appeared to be half her normal size and then looked like she was &quot;shrinking&quot;. Contemplacion suddenly realised she was gripping an elastic cord that was wrapped around Maga&#x27;s neck and ran into the bathroom to vomit. There she saw a young boy playing with water and he looked &quot;like a small cat&quot; to her. Contemplacion claimed she could not control herself, and she picked up the child then submerged his head in the bucket of water. Contemplacion asserted that she was suffering from severe psychiatric issues at the time of the killings, and was not guilty of murder but was admitting to manslaughter.

Testimony from Doctor Terence Burke asserted that Contemplacion suffered from a form of epilepsy known as a partial complex seizure, which was a mental illness that significantly impaired her responsibility for her actions on the day in question. Doctor Burke also testified that her low IQ and lack of education meant it was highly unlikely that Contemplacion would have been able to fabricate the symptoms of epilepsy. Deputy Public Prosecutor P.S. Raj argued that Contemplacion was simply suffering from a migraine on the day of the murders, adding that she had been examined previously by the consultant psychiatrist of Changi Prison hospital, Doctor Chan Khim Yew, and was determined to have no abnormality of the mind that would impair her mental reasoning abilities.

DPP Raj also highlighted that Contemplacion had not mentioned hearing voices or having hallucinations in any of her statements to the police after her arrest nor to Doctor Chan Khim Yew during his psychiatric examinations, having first reported these issues during interviews with Doctor Burke after her conviction and only submitting them in her defence during her retrial, which lead the court to consider her claims as fabrications and an exaggeration of a mild headache. DPP Raj further asserted that the evidence of Doctor Chan Khim Yew should take precedence over the testimony of Doctor Burke, as Contemplacion had first been examined by Doctor Chan Khim Yew a month after the murders and he had kept her under observation over 18 months throughout her detention in remand prison, whereas Doctor Burke had only had 4 interviews with her after she had been convicted. Doctor Chan Khim Yew also had years of previous experience on examining patients and then giving evidence on the issue of diminished responsibility, where as Doctor Burke had never testified on a case regarding diminished responsibility before, the DPP added.

After deliberation, the judge rejected Contemplacion&#x27;s testimony and confirmed her earlier death sentence, ruling that she did not suffer from any serious mental illness at the time of the double homicide, that she only displayed symptoms of a mild migraine, and that she had consciously and deliberately murdered both victims. The court&#x27;s judgement noted that the comprehensiveness of Contemplacion&#x27;s actions in the apartment, such as using two different methods to silently kill each victim and locking the youngest child in a bedroom to prevent the sound of her crying alerting any bystanders, coupled with her ability to remember the events of that day in clear detail, proved that she was not suffering from a partial complex seizure during the time of the murders. The fact that both women had argued over the size of the package Maga refused to take with her to the Philippines on Contemplacion&#x27;s behalf was attributed as a more likely motive for the fatal attack, according to the judge. 

Justice T. S. Sinnathuray also highlighted that both Doctor Burke and Doctor Chan Khim Yew had agreed that a person suffering a partial complex seizure would have no recollection of the events that occurred during the episode, where as Contemplacion had given a vivid and detailed step by step account of what happened in Della&#x27;s flat on the day of the murders, therefore her testimony satisfied him beyond reasonable doubt that she did not suffer from partial complex seizure at that time. The judge likewise dismissed claims that Contemplacion was unintelligent, as having witnessed her nimble performance during cross examination over several days he considered her a wilful and cunning person.

=== Appeal of Conviction ===
On 19 September 1994, Contemplacion&#x27;s appeal against her conviction was rejected by Singapore&#x27;s Court of Criminal Appeal. Defence lawyer Sant Singh argued that while the circumstances of the double murder she was convicted of were not in dispute, the original trial judge had erred in ruling the symptoms described by Contemplacion as a mild migraine rather than temporal lobe epilepsy, which was a core element in her pleading guilty by diminished responsibility. Although Doctor Chan Khim Yew had previously raised the fact that Contemplacion had not exhibited any unusual behaviour to her employers during the 3 years she worked for them, the defence asserted that they would only be able to observe her during evenings and weekends and therefore never had the chance to properly scrutinize her psychological condition. Defence lawyers also stated that Doctor Chan Khim Yew&#x27;s observations were irrelevant to Contemplacion&#x27;s mental state on the day of the murders as they took place after the fact. 

The Appeal Court judges rejected all defence arguments, highlighting how Doctor Chan Khim Yew had observed Contemplacion&#x27;s behaviour over 18 months while she was on remand and had ample time to diagnose any psychiatric issues. The court also gave credence to her faultless work history as evidence she was not suffering from any serious illness, as she was trusted to look after young children while living in the same house as her employers, who would have easily spotted Contemplacion having epileptic fits on a near monthly basis as she claimed. The original trial judge was also deemed to have correctly considered the calculated shrewdness of Contemplacion&#x27;s actions inside the flat on the day of the murders as evidence of a lack of mental abnormality on her part, as well as her alert and quick thinking performance while under cross examination being proof she was in fact a cunning and intelligent person.

=== President Ramos intervention ===
Philippines President Fidel V. Ramos wrote to Singapore President Ong Teng Cheong twice, once to grant clemency to Contemplacion and the other to delay execution to evaluate purported new evidence which had surfaced.

== Allegations against Huang&#x27;s father ==
In the days leading up to the scheduled execution, Filipina maid Emilia Frenilla, who had previously worked for Huang&#x27;s uncle, submitted a sworn statement to the Singaporean Embassy in Manila, claiming: 
* Nicholas Huang suffered from epilepsy
* Delia Maga was murdered by Huang&#x27;s father in a fit of rage when he discovered Huang had accidentally drowned after having a seizure and falling into a bucket of water
* Frenilla overheard Huang&#x27;s father and uncle discussing how he framed Contemplacion for the deaths
* Huang&#x27;s father and uncle spoke in a mixture of Malay and English, languages Frenilla was fluent in after previously working in Kota Kinabalu

However, after an investigation Singaporean authorities disregarded the new evidence, citing factual errors such as: 
* Nicholas Huang&#x27;s family doctor confirmed the boy had never been diagnosed with epilepsy
* Huang&#x27;s father did not name Contemplacion in any statements he made to the police and she was only identified as a suspect after the police themselves had found her details in Maga&#x27;s personal diary
* Huang&#x27;s father and uncle do not speak Malay, and only converse with each other in Chinese (Hakka and/or Mandarin)

Also, the fact that after her arrest Contemplacion revealed to police the location of luxury items she had stolen from Maga provided strong circumstantial evidence that she was linked to the murders.

== Allegations of mistreatment while in custody ==
Shortly after midnight on the morning of the scheduled execution, Filipina citizen Virginia Custodio Parumog, who in 1992 had shared a prison cell with Contemplacion in Changi Prison while serving a custodial sentence for prostitution, returned to Singapore via commercial airline and then attempted to submit an affidavit to Singaporean authorities containing claims such as: 
* Contemplacion had told her that when she arrived at the apartment in Bukit Panjang for a visit Nicolas was already dead, Maga then phoned Huang&#x27;s father who rushed home and strangled her to death in anger, and when the police arrived they arrested Contemplacion on the orders of Huang&#x27;s father
* Contemplacion did not give any statements to police after her arrest and strenuously denied all charges regarding the double murder she was accused of
* Contemplacion was twice forced to undergo electric shock therapy against her will while on remand
* Contemplacion was handcuffed to a bedframe in the Changi Prison hospital psychiatric ward for over a month
* Contemplacion was forced to take unknown tablets, possibly a tranquilizer, everytime she attended court during her trial
* Parumog herself was put into solitary confinement for attempting to smuggle a letter out of prison from Contemplacion to her husband

Shortly afterwards, the Ministry of Home Affairs released a communiqué denying all allegations, stating: 
* when the police arrived at the crime scene Contemplacion was not there, Huang&#x27;s father never mentioned Contemplacion&#x27;s name during questioning nor made accusations against any other named person, and Contemplacion was in fact arrested in another part of Singapore later that day after the police themselves identified her as a person of interest
* Contemplacion made five statements to police, all of which were translated by an interpreter from the Philippine Embassy in Singapore and written copies of each were then signed by Contemplacion herself
* although her original trial lawyer challenged their admissibility on a legal technicality, Contemplacion never disavowed the contents of the statements she gave to the police and she did not retract her original confession throughout her trial, appeal, or petition for clemency from the President of Singapore
* Contemplacion was given two EEG tests, one of which was in fact requested by her own defence psychiatrist Doctor Terence Burke, at Tan Tock Seng hospital to help determine her mental health, however she was never administered electric shocks at any point during her incarceration
* although Contemplacion was handcuffed to a bedframe while under psychiatric observation, this was standard procedure for all prisoners facing charges related to capital punishment for security reasons and was not intended as a form of mistreatment
* while Contemplacion was prescribed medication for headaches and a sore throat while on remand, medical records proved she was not given any sort of medicine at all during her trial
* Changi Prison officers did not detect any attempt to smuggle letters from Contemplacion by Parumog or any other inmate
* Parumog was sent to solitary confinement cells on four different occasions, not for any events linked to Contemplacion but instead twice for fighting with other prisoners, once for giving herself a tattoo against prison regulations and once for a suicide attempt

== Execution ==
Sister Gerard Fernandez (a Good Shepherd nun) accompanied Contemplacion on her final walk to the gallows, where they both sang the hymn Amazing Grace. Sister Gerard later described Contemplacion as being calm and at peace in her final moments.

Just before dawn on the morning of 17 March 1995, Flor Contemplacion was hanged at Changi Prison alongside three men convicted of drug trafficking. Her execution went ahead as scheduled despite a personal plea for clemency from President of the Philippines Fidel Ramos to the Singaporean government.

==Aftermath==
Many Filipinos believed that Contemplacion was innocent or at least insane, blaming the Singaporean government for a &quot;lack of compassion&quot;, and the Philippine government for &quot;not doing enough&quot; to stop the execution. The Philippine Secretary of Foreign Affairs, Roberto Romulo, and Secretary of Labor and Employment, Nieves Confesor, both resigned as a result of the controversy.

The Philippine Embassy in Singapore in particular was heavily criticised, since it did little to help Contemplacion during the two years she was on remand, apart from delivering food and books to her in prison, and did not even have a consular representative as an observer in court throughout her trial. The former Embassy labour attache Reynaldo Catapang later confirmed that they did not hire a private lawyer to represent Contemplacion and allowed the Singaporean authorities to appoint a public defender instead, nor did they keep any records of the legal proceedings or transcripts of the court case itself.

However, shortly after Contemplacion&#x27;s execution the Philippines&#x27; former consul general in Singapore Elizabeth Buensuceso said that Contemplacion had disregarded the Embassy&#x27;s warning not to make any admissions to the police until after she got proper legal representation in place. Buensuceso was also quoted by the Manila Chronicle that Contemplacion rejected their legal advice not to sign any confession after her arrest, saying &quot;she was very furious then and kept shouting that she had committed the crime&quot;. It was also revealed that Contemplacion was allowed to have at least nine private consultations with Philippine Embassy officials without Singaporean authorities being present, yet she did not withdraw her original confession or change any aspect of her testimony at any of these meetings.
Although President Ramos seemed initially resigned to the execution, he called Contemplacion a heroine. His wife, First Lady Amelita Ramos, went to receive Contemplacion&#x27;s coffin at Ninoy Aquino International Airport in Manila on 19 March. Contemplacion&#x27;s body was carried from the airport to San Pablo, and thousands of Filipinos lined the route. President Ramos sent a wreath to Contemplacion&#x27;s wake and offered financial assistance to Contemplacion&#x27;s four children, who were dependent on their mother&#x27;s income as a domestic worker, pledging one month of his salary to a scholarship fund. Prelates of the local Catholic Church also condemned the execution.

There were several protests held across the Philippines over Contemplacion&#x27;s execution, some of which were organized by politicians and labor organizations. Thousands of Singapore flags were burned in the protests. In one of the protests, the mayor of Davao City, Rodrigo Duterte, burned a flag of Singapore while leading 1,000 employees of Davao City in protest.

Several threats against Singaporeans and Singapore properties in the Philippines were reported. Singaporean tourists either shortened or canceled their holiday trips in the Philippines in view of their safety. Skilled Singaporean workers working in the Philippines either left the country or were recalled back to Singapore by their companies.

The Alex Boncayao Brigade, a Filipino assassination unit of the Philippine New People&#x27;s Army, had threatened to kill Filipino officials and diplomats if they fail to stop Contemplacion&#x27;s execution.

Following the execution, Prime Minister Goh Chok Tong&#x27;s planned trip to Manila, which was at the invitation of President Ramos, was postponed. President Ramos recalled the Filipino ambassador to Singapore, and many bilateral exchanges between the countries were cancelled.

A Presidential Fact Finding Commission was setup in the Philippines to investigate Contemplacion&#x27;s case and the findings were submitted to President Ramos on 6 April 1995. In a statement by President Ramos, a protective programme was approved to oversee the welfare of overseas Filipinos with the deployment of government staff, lawyers and doctors to various countries. In response to the findings, the Singapore government rejected the findings but agreed to President Ramos&#x27;s request to examine Maga&#x27;s remains by two Singaporean pathologists and three foreign consultants.

The first autopsy done by Singaporean pathologists concluded that Maga died of asphyxia due to strangulation which was disputed by the Philippines&#x27; National Bureau of Investigation experts. A final autopsy was conducted in July by an independent panel, whose results and would be final, and both governments required to accept the findings. If the findings determined that Maga did not die of asphyxia, the Singapore government will reopen Contemplacion&#x27;s case and re-investigate the deaths of Maga and Huang. The independent panel ultimately did determine that Maga&#x27;s cause of death was asphyxia, which the Philippines government accepted. Philippines and Singapore began to reconcile their bilateral relations.

== 1995 Presidential Fact Finding Commission ==
In April 1995, a Presidential Fact Finding Commission was set up by President Ramos to investigate the facts surrounding the death of Delia Maga and the conviction of Flor Contemplacion for her murder. The finished report recommended that the case be reopened, after gathering new testimony, in addition to earlier claims made by Parumog and Frenilla, such as: 
* claims by Lucena Songalia Sarceno, who was serving a 16-month custodial sentence for extortion in Changi Women&#x27;s Prison at the same time as Contemplacion was incarcerated there, that she overheard Philippine consul general Elizabeth Buensuceso advise Contemplacion in July 1992 to plead guilty and that she would only be sentenced to five years in prison if she did so
* Contemplacion had denied any involvement in the murders to Sarceno and claimed she had been forced to lie in a coffin filled with dry ice
* Sarceno asserted she personally witnessed Contemplacion being tortured by prison guards via electrocution involving a basin of water
* Sarceno also claimed Contemplacion appeared visibly drugged before going to court during her trial, often taking a few days to return to normal cognitive functioning, and Sarceno observed prison officers taking Contemplacion to the prison infirmary the day preceding each court appearance 
* Contemplacion&#x27;s niece Josie De Sagun claimed to have received a letter where Contemplacion made allegations of being raped and forced fed tranquilizers against her will
* Alicia Vinzon Mabulay claimed to have spoken to Contemplacion while she was briefly detained in Changi Prison for immigration offences in 1993, and was informed by Contemplacion that she was tortured and drugged by the guards
* the original trial judge should have considered a defence of diminished responsibility before finding Contemplacion guilty of murder and sentencing her to death

The Singaporean government described the findings as &quot;totally absurd&quot; and based on uncorroborated hearsay testimonies of individuals who did not witness the crime itself, and later released its own point by point rebuttal of the findings, such as: 
* Contemplacion had confessed to the murders over a year before meeting Buensuceso and Sarceno was not present in the part of the prison where the interview took place on the day in question
* no coffins are kept in any prisons in Singapore and Contemplacion never complained of mistreatment to Philippine embassy officials who had visited her dozens of times or to a nun (Sister Gerard Fernandez) who visited her weekly on death row.

* although Contemplacion underwent EEG tests, they took place in a hospital 10 miles away where Sarceno wasn&#x27;t present 
* while it was true Contemplacion received antibiotics and painkillers while on remand she was not issued any medication at all during her trial
* Contemplacion had never complained of being raped to visiting Philippine Embassy officials, all 70 letters sent by Contemplacion from prison were copied by authorities as a matter of policy and none of those contained any allegations of rape, and Contemplacion was detained in prisons with all female staff the entire time she was incarcerated
* Contemplacion was already segregated in the death row section of Moon Crescent Prison at the time Mabulay was imprisoned in the general population of Changi Women&#x27;s Prison, therefore it was impossible for them to have spoken to each other
* Contemplacion was examined before her trial by independent psychiatrist Doctor Fong Yeng Hoi, who found she was not suffering from any mental illness that would impair her perception of events or people via hallucinations and cause her to act irrationally, which therefore procedurally barred Contemplacion&#x27;s lawyer from submitting a defence based on pleading not guilty by reason of insanity

== Fate of Contemplacion&#x27;s family ==
On 20 October 2005, three of Contemplacion&#x27;s sons, Sandrex and twins Jun-Jun and Joel, were arrested for drug trafficking after a buy-bust sting operation by the San Pablo City police, where an undercover officer bought ₱3,000 worth of methamphetamine from the brothers. On 9 March 2011, all three were sentenced to life in prison and also fined ₱500,000 each for violation of the Comprehensive Dangerous Drugs Act of 2002. In August 2008, Contemplacion&#x27;s widower Efren and his new partner were arrested in a similar anti-drug operation by the same police force.

On 6 April 2013, Contemplacion&#x27;s other son, Romulo, was arrested in San Pablo City in connection with the murder of councilman Roland Acbang in Barangay San Crispin, and the attempted murder of Rardine Mercado in Barangay Francisco. A police raid on the Barangay San Diego house that Romulo and three other men were hiding in recovered firearms and hand grenades believed to be linked to the attacks. All four suspects were later charged with illegal possession of firearms and explosives, with murder charges also expected to be filed against them after police had finished their forensic evidence investigations.

==In popular culture==
&quot;The Flor Contemplacion Story&quot;, directed by Joel Lamangan and starring Nora Aunor in the role of Contemplacion, was released by Viva Entertainment and also won Best Picture in the Cairo Film Festival in 1995.

The story of Contemplacion, starring Gina Alajar in the role of Delia Maga, was also featured in another film by Regal Films and Golden Lions Films Productions, &quot;Victim No. 1: Delia Maga (Jesus, Pray for Us! : A Massacre In Singapore)&quot;, directed by Carlo J. Caparas.

In 1995, another documentary film on the incident, was released, titled &quot;Bagong Bayani&quot; (aka &quot;A New Hero&quot; or &quot;Unsung Heroine&quot;), and directed by Tikoy Aguiluz. It starred Helen Gamboa as Contemplacion and Chanda Romero as Maga.

The case of Flor Contemplacion was also featured in an episode of GMA Network&#x27;s crime documentary program, &quot;Case Unclosed&quot;.

The aftermath of Flor Contemplacion&#x27;s family after her execution was shown on GMA Network&#x27;s drama anthology series, &quot;Magpakailanman&quot;, starring Alessandra de Rossi as Flor&#x27;s daughter Russel, who suffered from a string of unfortunate events after her mother&#x27;s death including her widower’s drug addiction, the imprisonment of her father and siblings from drugs, and hardships on balancing work and motherhood. The episode was titled “Life After the Death of Flor Contemplacion” and originally aired on 13 April 2013.

In Singapore, the Flor Contemplacion murders was also one of the cases solved by Professor Chao Tzee Cheng, the senior forensic pathologist. It was later re-enacted by the Singaporean crime show &quot;Whispers of the Dead&quot; in 2014. The perpetrator Flor Contemplacion and her two victims Nicholas Huang and Della Maga had their names changed for dramatic purposes and to protect their identities, although the overall turn of events and trial proceedings remained reminiscent of the real life events.

<text>A-002 was the third abort test of the Apollo spacecraft.

==Objectives==
Mission A-002 was the third in the series of abort tests to demonstrate that the launch system would perform satisfactorily under selected critical abort conditions. The main objective of this mission was to demonstrate the abort capability of the launch escape vehicle in the maximum dynamic pressure region of the Saturn trajectory with conditions approximating the altitude limit at which the Saturn emergency detection system would signal an abort.

The launch vehicle was the third in the Little Joe II series. This vehicle differed from the previous two in that flight controls and instrumentation were incorporated, and the vehicle was powered by two Algol and four Recruit rocket motors. The launch escape system was also changed from previous configurations in that canards (forward control surfaces used to orient and stabilize the escape vehicle in the entry attitude) and a command module boost protective cover were incorporated. The Apollo spacecraft was simulated by a boilerplate command and service module (BP-23). The Earth landing system was modified from the previous configuration by the installation of modified dual-drogue parachutes instead of a single-drogue parachute.

==Flight==

The A-002 vehicle was launched on December 8, 1964, at 8:00:00 a.m. M.S.T. (15:00:00 UTC) by igniting all launch vehicle motors simultaneously. Conditions at abort initiation were selected from Saturn boost trajectories, and a nominal test point was used for the maximum dynamic pressure region. A pitch up maneuver and the abort were initiated by using a real-time plot of the dynamic pressure versus Mach number. However, an improper constant was used in the meteorological data input to the real-time data system, resulting in the pitch up maneuver being initiated 2.4 seconds early. Although the planned test point was not achieved, the early pitch up caused a higher maximum dynamic pressure than the design value.

Canard deployment took place as expected 11.1 seconds after abort initiation. The launch escape vehicle tumbled four times before stabilizing with the aft heat shield forward. During the first turnaround, the soft portion of the boost protective cover was torn away from the command module. Maximum altitude attained by the launch escape vehicle was 50,360 feet (15,350 m) above mean sea level.

Baro-switches initiated the Earth landing sequence at an altitude of approximately 23,500 feet (7,163 m) above mean sea level. All parachutes deployed properly and the command module, supported by the three main parachutes, descended at the planned rate of about 24 ft/s (7 m/s) to an Earth landing 32,800 feet (10 km) down range.

The abort conditions obtained were more than adequate in verifying the abort capability in the maximum dynamic pressure region. Only one test objective was not achieved: the boost protective cover was structurally inadequate for the environment experienced during the mission.

==Boilerplate location==
BP-23 was refurbished as BP-23A and used for Launch Pad Abort Test 2. BP-23A is on display as part of the SA-500D Saturn V exhibit at the US Space &amp; Rocket Center, Huntsville, Alabama.

WinShell includes a text editor, syntax highlighting, project management, spell checking, a table wizard, BibTeX front-end, Unicode support, different toolbars, user configuration options and it is portable (e.g. on a USB drive).
It is not a LaTeX system; an additional LaTeX compiler system for Microsoft Windows (such as MiKTeX or TeX Live) is required.

==Languages==
Supported languages are Brazilian Portuguese, Catalan, Chinese, Czech, Danish, Dutch, English, French, Galician, German, Hungarian, Italian, Japanese, Mexico Spanish, Polish, Portuguese, Russian, Serbian, Spain Spanish, Swedish and Turkish.

==Interoperability==

WinShell works with the MiKTeX, the TeX Live and the W32TeX distribution. At first start, WinShell recognizes the distribution and sets the command-line arguments automatically. Similarly with the viewer for the generated PDF documents. For Acrobat Reader, WinShell closes the PDF document before compiling. For SumatraPDF, WinShell automatically sets the correct commands to achieve forward and inverse search between WinShell and SumatraPDF.

==Notes==
After the announcement of the disqualification for doping of the athlete Yuri Bilonog (UKR), who won the gold medal at the time, there was a new distribution of medals in March 2013. The IOC upgraded original silver medalist Adam Nelson (USA) to gold, bronze medalist Joachim Olsen (DEN) to silver, and fourth place finisher Manuel Martínez (ESP) to bronze.
Adrian Annus (HUN) and Ivan Tsikhan (BLR) were disqualified due to doping. IOC decided to declare the silver and bronze medals vacant.
Crystal Cox (USA), who ran in the preliminary round of a relay team, admitted to using anabolic steroids from 2001 to 2004. The IOC decided to revoke the gold medal from Crystal Cox and asked the IAAF to make its decision about the US squad. The IOC and IAAF announced that the result would stand because, according to the rules of the time, a team should not be disqualified because of a doping offense by an athlete who did not compete in finals.
 Russian athlete Irina Korzhanenko lost her gold medal in women&#x27;s shot put due to doping, with Cuban Yumileidi Cumbá Jay replacing her as the Olympic champion, German Nadine Kleinert receiving the silver medal, and Svetlana Krivelyova of Russia receiving the bronze medal, however Krivelyova was later stripped of her bronze for the same reason. IOC decided to declare the bronze medal vacant.
Iryna Yatchenko (BLR), was disqualified due to doping. The IOC decided that the bronze medal was reallocated to the athlete Věra Pospíšilová-Cechlová (CZE) during the IOC Executive Board on 30 May 2013.

In 2008, Klosterman spent the summer as the Picador Guest Professor for Literature at the Leipzig University&#x27;s Institute for American Studies in Germany.

Klosterman was an original member of &quot;Grantland&quot;, a now-defunct sports and pop culture web site owned by ESPN and founded by Bill Simmons. Klosterman was a consulting editor. In 2020, he co-hosted a podcast titled &quot;Music Exists&quot; with Chris Ryan as part of &quot;The Ringer&quot; podcast network.

He also appeared as an animated version of himself in several episodes of the Adult Swim web feature &quot;Carl&#x27;s Stone Cold Lock of the Century of the Week&quot;, to discuss the week&#x27;s football games and to sometimes try to promote his latest book (Carl cuts him off each time). In one episode, Carl recites a list of facts and Klosterman asks &quot;Is this, perhaps, from Wikipedia?&quot;

In 2012, Klosterman appeared in the documentary &quot;Shut Up and Play the Hits&quot; about musical group LCD Soundsystem; Klosterman&#x27;s extended interview with the group&#x27;s frontman James Murphy &quot;forms the...backbone of the film&quot;.

His eighth book, titled &quot;I Wear the Black Hat,&quot; was published in 2013. It focuses on the paradox of villainy within a heavily mediated culture.

In 2015, Klosterman appeared on episodes 6 and 7 of the first season of IFC show &quot;Documentary Now!&quot; as a music critic for the fictional band The Blue Jean Committee.

His best-selling ninth book, &quot;But What If We&#x27;re Wrong? Thinking About the Present As If It Were the Past&quot;, was published June 7, 2016. It visualizes the contemporary world as it will appear in the future to those who will perceive it as the distant past.

In 2021, Klosterman appeared on the podcast &quot;Storybound&quot;, backed by an original Storybound remix with Portico Quartet.

His 12th book, &quot;The Nineties&quot;, debuted at No. 2 on &quot;The New York Times&quot; nonfiction bestseller list on February 27, 2022.

<doc id="805224" wikidata="Q91486" url="?curid=805224" title="Akira (manga)">
<text>is a Japanese cyberpunk post-apocalyptic manga series written and illustrated by Katsuhiro Otomo. It was serialized biweekly in Kodansha&#x27;s manga magazine &quot;Young Magazine&quot; from December 20, 1982, to June 25, 1990, with its 120 chapters collected into six volumes. It was initially published in the United States by Marvel Comics under its Epic imprint, becoming one of the first manga works to be translated in its entirety into English. It is currently published by Kodansha Comics in North America. Considered a watershed title for the medium, the manga is also famous for spawning the seminal 1988 cyberpunk anime film adaptation of the same name and the greater franchise.

Set in a post-apocalyptic and futuristic &quot;Neo-Tokyo&quot;, more than three decades after a mysterious explosion destroyed the city, the story centers on teenage biker gang leader Shotaro Kaneda, militant revolutionary Kei, a trio of Espers, and Neo-Tokyo military leader Colonel Shikishima, who attempt to prevent Tetsuo Shima, Kaneda&#x27;s mentally unbalanced childhood friend, from using his unstable and destructive telekinetic abilities to ravage the city and awaken a mysterious entity with powerful psychic abilities named &quot;Akira&quot;. Otomo uses conventions of the cyberpunk genre to detail a saga of political turmoil, social isolation, corruption, and power. Widely regarded as a landmark work in cyberpunk and credited with pioneering the Japanese cyberpunk subgenre, &quot;Akira&quot; received universal acclaim from readers and critics, with Otomo&#x27;s artwork, storytelling, characters, and exploration of mature themes and concepts subject to particular praise. The manga also achieved international commercial success, selling millions of copies worldwide.

An animated film adaptation released in 1988 shortened the plot considerably, but retained many of the manga&#x27;s primary characters and plot elements alongside additional scenes, settings, and motifs. The film was similarly lauded and has served as a significant influence to the anime industry and sci-fi media as a whole. The adaptation also marked Otomo&#x27;s transition from a career primarily in manga to one almost exclusively in anime.

&quot;Akira&quot; was instrumental in the surge in popularity of manga outside Japan, especially in the United States and France. The manga won several awards, including the Kodansha Manga Award, a Harvey Award, and four Eisner Awards.

==Plot==

===Volume 1: &quot;Tetsuo&quot;===
On December 6, 1982, an apparent nuclear explosion destroys Tokyo and starts World War III. By 2019, a new city called Neo-Tokyo has been built on artificial islands in Tokyo Bay. Although Neo-Tokyo is set to host the XXXII Olympic Games, the city is gripped by anti-government terrorism and gang violence. While exploring the ruins of old Tokyo, Tetsuo Shima, a member of the bōsōzoku gang led by Shōtarō Kaneda, is accidentally injured when his bike crashes after Takashi — a child Esper with wizened features — blocks his path. This incident awakens psychic powers in Tetsuo, attracting the attention of a secret government project directed by JSDF Colonel Shikishima. These increasing powers unhinge Tetsuo&#x27;s mind, exacerbating his inferiority complex about Kaneda and leading him to assume leadership of the rival Clown Gang through violence.

Meanwhile, Kaneda becomes involved with Kei, a member of a terrorist organization that stages anti-government attacks. Led by Ryusaku and opposition Diet leader Nezu, the terrorists get wind of the Colonel&#x27;s project and a mysterious figure connected with it known as &quot;Akira.&quot; They hope to use this leaked information and try to restrict Kaneda&#x27;s movements because of his involvement with their activities. However, when Tetsuo and the Clowns begin a violent citywide turf war, Kaneda instigates a counter-attack that unites all of Neo-Tokyo&#x27;s biker gangs against Tetsuo. While the Clown Gang is easily defeated, Tetsuo&#x27;s psionic powers make him virtually invincible. Tetsuo kills Yamagata, Kaneda&#x27;s second-in-command, and astonishingly survives after being shot by Kaneda. The Colonel arrives with the powerful drugs needed to suppress Tetsuo&#x27;s violent headaches, extending Tetsuo an offer to join the project.

===Volume 2: &quot;Akira I&quot;===
After confronting the JSDF, Kaneda, Kei, and Tetsuo are taken into military custody and held in a highly secure skyscraper in Neo-Tokyo. Kei soon escapes after becoming possessed as a medium by another Esper, Kiyoko. Kei/Kiyoko briefly does battle with Tetsuo and frees Kaneda. After rapidly healing from his wounds, Tetsuo inquires about Akira and forces Doctor Onishi, a project scientist, to take him to the other espers: Takashi, Kiyoko, and Masaru. There, a violent confrontation unfolds between Tetsuo, Kaneda, Kei, and the Espers. The Doctor decides to try to let Tetsuo harness Akira — the project&#x27;s test subject that destroyed Tokyo — despite Tetsuo&#x27;s disturbed personality. Upon learning that Akira is being stored in a cryogenic chamber beneath Neo-Tokyo&#x27;s new Olympic Stadium, Tetsuo escapes the skyscraper with the intent of releasing Akira.

Tetsuo enters the secret military base at the Olympic site the following day, killing many soldiers. The Colonel comes to the base and tries to talk Tetsuo out of his plan; Kaneda and Kei enter the site through the sewers and witness the unfolding situation. Tetsuo breaks open the underground cryogenic chamber and frees Akira, who turns out to be an ordinary-looking little boy. The terror of seeing Akira causes one of the Colonel&#x27;s men to declare a state of emergency that causes massive panic in Neo-Tokyo. The Colonel himself tries to use SOL, a laser satellite, to kill Tetsuo and Akira, but only succeeds in severing Tetsuo&#x27;s arm.

===Volume 3: &quot;Akira II&quot;===
Tetsuo disappears in the subsequent explosion, and Kaneda and Kei come across Akira outside the base. Vaguely aware of who he is, they take him back into Neo-Tokyo. Both the Colonel&#x27;s soldiers and the followers of an Esper named Lady Miyako begin scouring Neo-Tokyo in search of him. Kaneda, Kei, and a third terrorist, Chiyoko, attempt to find refuge with Akira on Nezu&#x27;s yacht. However, Nezu betrays them and kidnaps Akira for his use, attempting to have them killed. They survive the attempt and manage to snatch Akira from Nezu&#x27;s mansion. The Colonel, desperate to find Akira and fed up with the government&#x27;s tepid response to the crisis, mounts a coup d&#x27;état and puts the city under martial law. The Colonel&#x27;s men join Lady Miyako&#x27;s acolytes and Nezu&#x27;s private army in chasing Kaneda, Kei, Chiyoko, and Akira through the city.

The pursuit ends at a canal, with Kaneda&#x27;s group surrounded by the Colonel&#x27;s troops. As Akira is being taken into the Colonel&#x27;s custody, Nezu attempts to shoot Akira rather than have him be put into government hands; he is immediately fired upon and killed by the Colonel&#x27;s men. However, Nezu&#x27;s shot misses Akira and hits Takashi in the head, killing him instantly. The trauma of Takashi&#x27;s death causes Akira to trigger a second psychic explosion that destroys Neo-Tokyo. Kei, Ryu, Chiyoko, the Colonel, and the other two Espers survive the catastrophe; Kaneda, however, disappears as the blast surrounds him. After the city&#x27;s destruction, Tetsuo reappears and meets Akira.

===Volume 4: &quot;Kei I&quot;===
Sometime later, an American reconnaissance team led by Lieutenant George Yamada covertly arrives in the ruined Neo-Tokyo. Yamada learns that the city has been divided into two factions: the cult of Lady Miyako, which provides food and medicine for the destitute refugees, and the Great Tokyo Empire, a group of zealots led by Tetsuo with Akira as a figurehead; both worshiped as deities for performing &quot;miracles.&quot; The Empire constantly harasses Lady Miyako&#x27;s group and kills any intruders with Tetsuo&#x27;s psychic shock troops. Kiyoko and Masaru become targets for the Empire&#x27;s fanatical soldiers: Kei, Chiyoko, the Colonel, and Kai, a former member of Kaneda&#x27;s gang, ally themselves with Lady Miyako to protect them.

Yamada eventually becomes affiliated with Ryu and updates him on how the world has reacted to the events in Neo-Tokyo; they later learn that an American naval fleet lingers nearby. Tetsuo becomes heavily dependent on government-issued pills to quell his headaches. Seeking answers, he visits Lady Miyako at her temple and is given a comprehensive history of the government project that unleashed Akira. Miyako advises Tetsuo to quit the pills to become more powerful; Tetsuo begins a withdrawal. Meanwhile, Tetsuo&#x27;s aide, the Captain, stages an unsuccessful Empire assault on Miyako&#x27;s temple. After the Colonel uses SOL to attack the Empire&#x27;s army, a mysterious event opens a rift in the sky, dumping Kaneda and massive debris from Akira&#x27;s second explosion.

===Volume 5: &quot;Kei II&quot;===
Kaneda is reunited with Kei and joins Kai and Joker, the former Clown leader, in planning an assault on the Great Tokyo Empire. Meanwhile, an international team of scientists meets up on an American aircraft carrier to study the recent psychic events in Neo-Tokyo, forming Project Juvenile A. Ryu has a falling out with Yamada after learning that he plans to use biological weapons to assassinate Tetsuo and Akira; Yamada later meets up with his arriving commando team. Akira and Tetsuo hold a rally at the Olympic Stadium to demonstrate their powers to the Empire, culminating with Tetsuo tearing a massive hole in the Moon&#x27;s surface and encircling it with a ring of debris.

Following the rally, Tetsuo&#x27;s power begins to contort his physical body, causing it to absorb surrounding objects; he later learns that his abuse of his powers has caused them to expand beyond the confines of his body, giving him the ability to transmute inert matter into flesh and integrate it into his physical form. Tetsuo makes a series of visits on board the aircraft carrier to attack the scientists and do battle with American fighter jets. Eventually, Tetsuo takes over the ship and launches a nuclear weapon over the ocean. Kei—accepting the role of a medium controlled by Lady Miyako and the Espers—arrives and battles Tetsuo. Meanwhile, Kaneda, Kai, Joker, and their small army of bikers arrive at the Olympic Stadium to begin their all-out assault on the Great Tokyo Empire.

===Volume 6: &quot;Kaneda&quot;===
As Kaneda and the bikers launch their assault on the stadium, Tetsuo returns from his battle with Kei. As his powers continue growing, Tetsuo&#x27;s body begins involuntarily morphing, and his cybernetic arm is destroyed as his original arm regrows. He then faces Yamada&#x27;s team but absorbs their biological attacks and temporarily regains control of his powers. Tetsuo kills Yamada and the commandos; he also eludes the Colonel&#x27;s attempts to kill him by guiding SOL with a laser designator. Kaneda confronts Tetsuo, and the two begin to fight; Kei joins them. However, the brawl is interrupted when the Americans try to carpet bomb Neo-Tokyo and destroy the city outright with their laser satellite, FLOYD. Tetsuo flies into space and brings down FLOYD, causing it to crash upon the aircraft carrier, killing the fleet admiral and one of the scientists.

After the battle, Tetsuo tries to resurrect Kaori, a girl he loved who was killed in the battle. He succeeds to a small degree but is unable to maintain focus. He retreats to Akira&#x27;s cryogenic chamber beneath the stadium, carrying her body. Kaneda and his friends appear to fight Tetsuo once more, but his powers transform him into a monstrous, amoeba-like mass resembling a fetus, absorbing everything near him. Tetsuo pulls the cryogenic chamber above ground and drops it onto Lady Miyako&#x27;s temple. Lady Miyako dies while defying Tetsuo after guiding Kei into space to fire upon him with SOL. Kei&#x27;s attack awakens Tetsuo&#x27;s full powers, triggering a psychic reaction similar to Akira&#x27;s. With the help of Kiyoko, Masaru, and the spirit of Takashi, Akira cancels out Tetsuo&#x27;s explosion with one of his own. They are also able to free Kaneda, who was trapped in Tetsuo&#x27;s mass. He witnesses the truth about the Espers&#x27; power as they, alongside Akira and Tetsuo, ascend to a higher plane of existence.

The United Nations sends peacekeeping forces to help the surviving parties of Neo-Tokyo. Kaneda and his friends confront them, declaring the city&#x27;s sovereignty as the Great Tokyo Empire and warning them that Akira still lives. Kaneda and Kei meet up with the Colonel and part ways as friends. As Kaneda and Kei ride through Neo-Tokyo with their followers, they are joined by ghostly visions of Tetsuo and Yamagata. They also see the city shedding its ruined façade, returning to its former splendor.

==Characters==
;:Kaneda (born September 5, 2003), full name , is the main protagonist of &quot;Akira&quot;. He is an antiheroic, brash, carefree delinquent and the leader of a motorcycle gang. Kaneda is best friends with Tetsuo, a member who he has known since childhood, but their friendship was ruined after Tetsuo gained and abused his psychic powers. He becomes involved with the terrorist resistance movement and forms an attraction for their member Kei, which eventually develops into a strong romantic bond between the two. During the events of volume 3, Kaneda is surrounded by the explosion caused by Akira and is transported to a place &quot;beyond this world&quot;, according to Lady Miyako. Kaneda returns at the end of volume 4, and alongside the Colonel, Joker, Ryu, Kai, Miyako, the Espers and Kei, they take down Tetsuo. Kaneda is ranked as #11 on IGN&#x27;s Top 25 Anime Characters of All Time list.
;:Kei (born March 8, 2002), full name unknown, is the secondary protagonist of &quot;Akira&quot;. Strong-willed and sensitive, she is a member of the terrorist resistance movement led by the government mole Nezu. She initially claims to be the sister of fellow resistance fighter Ryu, though it is implied that this is not true. Kei at first views Kaneda with contempt, finding him arrogant, gluttonous and chauvinistic. However, in volume 4, Lady Miyako deduces that she has fallen in love with him, and they become romantically involved following Kaneda&#x27;s return in volume 5. Kei is a powerful medium who cannot use psychic powers of her own but can channel the powers of others through her body. She is taken in by Lady Miyako and plays a critical role in the final battle.
;:Tetsuo (born July 29, 2004), full name , is the main antagonist of &quot;Akira&quot;. He evolves from Kaneda&#x27;s best friend and gang member to his nemesis. He is involved in an accident at the very beginning of the story, which causes him to display immense psychic powers. He is soon recruited by the Colonel and became a test subject known as . It is mentioned that he is Akira&#x27;s successor; however, Tetsuo&#x27;s mental instability increases with the manifestation of his powers, which ultimately drives him insane and he ruins his friendship with Kaneda. Later in the story, he becomes Akira&#x27;s second-in-command, before he begins to lose control of his powers. Eventually, Kei battles Tetsuo, unlocking his full power and triggering another psychic explosion. Akira, watched by his fellow Espers, absorbs Tetsuo&#x27;s explosion by creating one of his own. With Akira and the espers, he ascends to a higher plane of existence.
;: The Colonel (born November 15, 1977), last name , is the head of the secret government project conducting research on psychic test subjects (including the Esper children, Tetsuo, and formerly Akira). Although he initially appears to be an antagonist, the Colonel is an honorable and dedicated soldier committed to protecting Neo-Tokyo from any second onslaught of Akira. Later in the story, he provides medical aid to an ill Chiyoko and works with Kei. He is usually referred to by Kaneda as &quot;The Skinhead&quot;, due to his distinctive crew cut.
;The Espers:The Espers, also known as , are three children who are test subjects for the secret project. They are the only survivors of the test, following that of Lady Miyako ( 19), and given numbers between twenty and thirty. 23 was shown in the final chapter to have been amongst those &quot;in whom the power awoke&quot; but &quot;were left with crippling handicaps&quot;. At the time of the story, test subjects 29, 30 and 31 are not mentioned, 32, 33, 36, 37, 38 and 40 had died from brain injuries during treatment and 34, 35 and 39, who was in the secret base when Akira destroyed Neo-Tokyo, were subsequently listed as missing (they do not appear in the story). Akira was the only one of this generation with true power, with the others being evaluated as &quot;harmless&quot; (their considerable powers notwithstanding; they did not, however, represent a destructive threat of Akira&#x27;s magnitude). The three have the bodies of children but chronologically are in their late 30s. Their bodies and faces have wizened with age, but they have not physically grown. They are former acquaintances of Akira and survived the destruction of Tokyo. The Espers include:
:;:Kiyoko (born 1979) is an Esper who is confined to a bed at all times due to her lack of strength, which is why her companions Takashi and Masaru are protective of her. She can use teleportation, precognition and psychokinesis (as shown when levitating herself and Takashi&#x27;s corpse when Akira destroys Neo-Tokyo). She predicted the demise of Neo-Tokyo and Tetsuo&#x27;s involvement with Akira but did not tell the Colonel the full story right away. She is also shown to be a mother figure and leader of the other Espers for decision making.
:; :Takashi (born 1980) is the first Esper to be introduced when he causes Tetsuo&#x27;s accident in self-defense. He has the power to use psychokinesis and communicates with his fellow psychics telepathically. Takashi is a quiet, softspoken boy who has conflicting thoughts of the government and the people who had sheltered him and his friends, which was why he escaped the Colonel&#x27;s facility; however, Takashi is concerned for Kiyoko&#x27;s safety, and that forces him to stay. Takashi is accidentally killed by Nezu in his attempt to assassinate Akira, and the psychic trauma revolving around it afterward caused Akira to destroy Neo-Tokyo with his immense powers. He is revived along with the rest of the deceased Espers near the end of the series.
:;:Masaru (born 1980) is overweight and confined either to a wheelchair or a special floating chair as a result of developing polio at a young age. He has the power to use psychokinesis and communicates with his fellow psychics telepathically. He is braver than Takashi and is the first to attack Tetsuo when he tries killing Kiyoko. Masaru looks after the well-being of his friends, especially that of Kiyoko who is physically frail.
;:Akira is the eponymous character of the series. He has immense psychic powers, although from outward appearances he looks like a small, normal child. He is responsible for the destruction of Tokyo and the beginning of World War III. After the war, he was placed in cryogenics not far from the crater created by him, and the future site of the Neo-Tokyo Olympic Games. Shortly after being awoken by Tetsuo, he destroys Neo-Tokyo during a confrontation between Kaneda and the Colonel&#x27;s forces. Later in the story, he becomes Emperor of the Great Tokyo Empire. When he first appears, Akira has not aged in the decades he was kept frozen. Akira is essentially an empty shell; his powers have overwritten and destroyed his personality, leaving someone who rarely speaks or reacts, with a constant blank expression on his face. In the end, he is shot by Ryu while psychically synced with the increasingly unstable Tetsuo. It is at this moment he is reunited with his friends and regains his personality.
;:Kai (born January 8, 2004) is a loyal, high-ranking member of Kaneda&#x27;s gang. He is known for his unorthodox fashion sense, such as neckties, which he adopts to appear intelligent and sophisticated. He is detained by the army and placed in a reform school following the climax of volume 1, but returns in volume 4. Forming alliances with Kei and Lady Miyako, as well as Joker and Kaneda, he plays an instrumental role in the build-up to Kaneda&#x27;s showdown with Tetsuo.
;:Yamagata (born November 9, 2003) is a member of Kaneda&#x27;s gang who serves as Kaneda&#x27;s right-hand-man. Known for his aggressive, ready-to-fight behavior, he is killed by Tetsuo&#x27;s powers in volume 1 after attempting to shoot him when Kaneda, unable to kill Tetsuo, loses his gun.
;: Joker is the leader of the Clowns, a motorcycle gang made up of junkies and drug addicts. Joker plays a small role in the beginning but becomes more prominent much later in the story as an ally of Kaneda and Kai. He wears clown face paint and often changes the pattern.
;:Nezu (born December 11, 1964) is an opposition parliament member who is also the leader of the terrorist resistance movement against the government. He seems to be the mentor of Kei and Ryu and purports to be saving the nation from the corrupt and ineffective bureaucrats in power. It soon becomes evident, however, that Nezu is just as corrupt, and all that he seeks to do is to seize power for himself. He later betrays Lady Miyako, as well as various other characters, as he attempts to take control of Akira. After losing Akira, he finds Ryu in a dark corridor with the boy in tow. He attempts to kill Ryu, thinking he is a member of Lady Miyako&#x27;s group all along. Ryu, however, shoots Nezu. He later tries to shoot Akira before he can be taken into the Colonel&#x27;s custody. He misses and shoots Takashi in the head, instantly killing him. He is in turn shot and killed by the Colonel&#x27;s men.
;:Ryu (born May 31, 1992), short for , is a comrade of Kei&#x27;s in the resistance movement. As the story progresses, Ryu abandons his terrorist roots and becomes more heroic, working with Yamada and guiding Kaneda to Akira&#x27;s chamber where Tetsuo is held up, but battles with alcoholism. In the final volume, Ryu reluctantly shoots and &quot;kills&quot; Akira when he begins to release his power; he is killed by falling elevator debris shortly afterward.
;: Chiyoko is a tough, heavyset woman and weapons expert who is involved in the resistance and eventually becomes a key supporting character. She acts as a mother figure to Kei.
;:The Doctor (born January 28, 1958), last name , is the head scientist of the secret psychic research project and also serves as the Colonel&#x27;s scientific advisor. He belonged to the second generation of scientists overseeing the project after Akira killed the first. It is his curiosity and negligence for anyone&#x27;s well-being that unlocks and nurtures Tetsuo&#x27;s destructive power in the first place. When Akira is freed by Tetsuo from his cryogenic lair, the Doctor fails to get inside the shelter and freezes to death.
;:Lady Miyako is a former test subject known as 19. She is shown to possess precognitive and telepathic powers, as well as, in the final altercation with Tetsuo, telekinetic abilities. She is the high priestess of a temple in Neo-Tokyo and a major ally of Kaneda and Kei as the story progresses. Lady Miyako is also an initial ally of Nezu and gives Tetsuo a lecture on his powers. She plays an instrumental role in the final battle with Tetsuo at the cost of her own life, and after her death speaks to Kaneda when he, having previously been absorbed by Tetsuo, is transported to a place &quot;beyond this world&quot;.
:;:Sakaki is an empowered and fond disciple of Lady Miyako and apparent leader of her team of three. Although small and unassuming, she uses her powers to become much faster and stronger than the average person. Tomboyish in appearance, she is sent to battle the Espers, the military, Kaneda, and Nezu to recover Akira. Sakaki only appears in the third volume, in which she is killed by the military. Before her death Lady Miyako utters Sakaki&#x27;s name, emphasizing their close relationship.
:;:Mozu is a girl, plump in appearance, who is an empowered and fond disciple of Lady Miyako. She later teams with Sakaki and Miki to recover Akira. Mozu only appears in the third volume, in which she is killed by a reluctant Takashi who psychically turns her attack back on her.
:;:Miki is an empowered girl, gaunt in appearance and third fond disciple of Lady Miyako. She only appears in the third volume, in which she is killed by Nezu&#x27;s henchmen.
;:The Great Tokyo Empire is a small army which rises amid the ruins of Neo-Tokyo after its destruction at the hands of Akira, made up of crazed zealots who worship Akira as an Emperor for the &quot;miracles&quot; he performs, though the power lies squarely with his so-called Prime Minister, Tetsuo. Disorganized and unruly, the army rejects outside aid and wars with Lady Miyako&#x27;s followers. Tetsuo secretly drugs the rations distributed to its members. At the end of the story, Kaneda and friends take the Empire&#x27;s name and declare Neo-Tokyo a sovereign nation, expelling the American and United Nations forces that land in the city.
:;:Kaori is a young girl who appears late in the story and is recruited as one of Tetsuo&#x27;s sex slaves. She later becomes an object of his sincere affections. Kaori also serves as Akira&#x27;s babysitter. She is later shot in the back by the Captain. Tetsuo attempts to resurrect her but fails.
:; :The Captain is an opportunist, posing as a fanatical devotee of Tetsuo who serves him as his aide-de-camp late in the story but secretly desires control of the Great Tokyo Empire. Despite his scheming, the Captain shows some compassion, begging Tetsuo not to kill or harm the young women he has procured for him as they still have families. During the confrontation between Tetsuo and the U.S. Marines, he is caught in the crossfire and is killed by the bacterial gas Yamada uses.
:; :The Birdman is one of Tetsuo&#x27;s elite psychic shock-troops. He wears a blindfold and is frequently standing atop ruined buildings and rafters, observing and reporting on the goings-on within the Empire&#x27;s turf, and essentially acting as a security system. It is implied that his psychic powers allow him to sense sights and sounds from a great distance, further embodied by the all-seeing eye drawn on his forehead. He also possesses telepathic (his announcements are observed by a Marine to be &quot;like a voice in my head&quot;) and telekinetic abilities. Birdman dies when Yamada knocks him from his perch, causing him to fall to his death.
:; :The Eggplant man is a member of Tetsuo&#x27;s shock troops. He is described as a fat, short man with glasses who encounters Yamada and the Marines at Olympic Stadium. He was friends with Birdman, and attempts to telekinetically crush a Marine&#x27;s heart before being executed by Yamada.
;:Lieutenant Yamada, full name , is a Japanese-American soldier who is sent on a mission to assassinate Akira and Tetsuo in the latter half of the story after Akira has leveled Neo-Tokyo. Yamada plans to kill the two powerful psychics with darts containing a biological poison. He is later joined by a team of U.S. Marines to carry out the mission at the Olympic Stadium after it becomes the headquarters for Akira and Tetsuo&#x27;s Great Tokyo Empire. However, the biochemical weapons fail to harm Tetsuo, instead giving him temporary control of his expanding powers again. He then kills Yamada.
;:Juvenile A is an international team of scientists who are appointed to investigate psychic events in Neo-Tokyo in the latter half of the story. Its members include , , , , , and lama .

==Production==
===Conception===

Kodansha had been repeatedly asking Katsuhiro Otomo to write a series for their new manga magazine &quot;Young Magazine&quot; for some time, but he was busy with other work for another publisher and turned them down. After finishing &quot;Kanojo no Omoide...&quot; (1980) and &quot;Farewell to Weapons&quot; (1981) for &quot;Young Magazine&quot;, he started thinking of a new project. From the first meeting with the publisher, &quot;Akira&quot; was to be a short work of about ten chapters &quot;or something like that,&quot; so Otomo said he was &quot;really not&quot; expecting it to be a success. Otomo had previously created &quot;Fireball&quot; (1979), a series in which he disregarded accepted manga art styles and established his interest in science fiction as a setting. &quot;Fireball&quot; anticipated a number of plot elements of &quot;Akira&quot;, with its story of young freedom fighters trying to rescue one of the group&#x27;s older brother who was being used by the government in psychic experiments, with the older brother eventually unleashing a destructive &quot;fireball&quot; of energy (the story may have drawn inspiration from Alfred Bester&#x27;s 1953 novel &quot;The Demolished Man&quot;). Otomo used a science-fiction setting again the following year in &quot;Domu&quot;, which won the Nihon SF Taisho Award and Seiun Award and became a bestseller. He then began his most ambitious work to date, &quot;Akira&quot;.

Due to a lack of planning, Otomo had to hastily end &quot;Fireball&quot; without the finale he wanted and stated, &quot;You could say that &quot;Akira&quot; was born from the frustration I had about that at the time.&quot; Not wanting to repeat what happened with that manga, he had the basic plot of &quot;Akira&quot; outlined from the start in a two-page synopsis and predicted he would finish it in six months. However, just like what happened with &quot;Domu&quot;, new ideas and problems immediately came up and expanded the story gradually as he wrote. Mitsuteru Yokoyama&#x27;s manga series &quot;Tetsujin 28-go&quot; (1956–1966) had particular influence on &quot;Akira&quot;, as Otomo wanted to pay homage to the children&#x27;s manga. He explained, &quot;the grand plot for &quot;Akira&quot; is about an ultimate weapon developed during wartime and found during a more peaceful era. So the accidents and story develop around that ultimate weapon. If you know, &quot;Tetsujin 28-go&quot; then this is the same overall plot.&quot; With &quot;Akira&quot;, Otomo also wanted to depict the later Showa period, including preparations for the Olympics, the rapid economic growth, and the student protests of the 1960s. &quot;I wanted to recreate the assorted elements that built this era and craft an exciting story that would seem believable enough in reality.&quot; Otomo said that while there had been post-apocalyptic works before, he could not think of one that depicted an apocalypse in the middle of the story and wanted to do that with &quot;Akira&quot;. Mark Schilling reported that Otomo has also cited influence from the 1977 live-action film &quot;Star Wars&quot; on his series.

===Development===
With &quot;Akira&quot;, Otomo wanted to &quot;dig deeper into [his] issues&quot; with speed and flow, telling a story with as few words as possible, &quot;edit it to gain that sense of speed and make people read it faster, and at the same time make them stop cold at the important scenes.&quot; When it started, he was drawing 20 pages a chapter, for a total of 40 pages a month. Otomo began the process for each chapter by fully completing the first page as practice. In order to save time, he did not bother with character-pose sketches or the like; he drew directly onto the page he was submitting to the editors. After he drew each page, his assistant inked the lines of the buildings and the rest of the backgrounds with a Rotring pen and a ruler. Otomo would complete the rough draft two days before his deadline. He would spend half a day drawing the characters, then finish the buildings by adding dust, crevices and cracks to windows. Otomo estimated that they would finish the final rough draft at 5 a.m. on Sunday, ink the characters by 7 p.m., and then submit the completed chapter at 8 a.m. Monday morning. When Otomo began production on the anime film adaptation of &quot;Akira&quot;, he said the manga had a weekly schedule of 20 pages a week. So he hired a second assistant to help, and occasionally brought in a third just to handle the screentone. &quot;When the manga deadline drew near, we’d pull several all-nighters, then I’d walk right into the anime studio the day after.&quot; Manga artist and film director Satoshi Kon was an uncredited assistant on the series.

The image model for the character Akira was Shōryū from &quot;Saiyūki&quot; (1960). Otomo liked his sorrowful expression and used him as a reference after deciding to make Akira a child. While editing his film &quot;Jiyū wo Warera ni&quot;, Otomo would often hear someone in the studio next door yell &quot;Akira!&quot;, which he took to be the name of the assistant director. Because in the film industry the name &quot;Akira&quot; is often used to refer to Akira Kurosawa, Otomo &quot;thought that gap&quot; was funny and decided to use the name in his work one day. The character names Tetsuo and Kaneda, and the Espers&#x27; codenames of Nos. 25–28, were taken from &quot;Tetsujin 28-go&quot;. Kaneda&#x27;s iconic motorcycle from the manga had no specific design. So Otomo said it came out &quot;kind of random&quot; and changed every time he drew it. The character Chiyoko was originally designed to be an old man, but Otomo felt that was too ordinary and &quot;a little boring&quot; and came up with the idea for an old lady, which then became a large old lady. The character grew on him as he drew and she ended up with a greater role than he originally planned.
The logo for the manga changed several times throughout its serialization, including switching between Japanese and English. The first 35 chapters used &quot;katakana&quot; in the font Thick Textbook, chosen by Otomo for its ease of understanding and impact. After getting tired of this logo and having entered &quot;Chapter 2&quot; a few chapters previously, he used English in Broadway for chapter 36 because he wanted an Art Deco feel. However, Otomo did not like it when he saw the magazine and for chapters 37–48 he changed the font to a different Art Deco-style and wrote his name in English as &quot;OHTOMO KATSUHIRO&quot;. Otomo was often drawing Art Deco-styled skyscrapers on the title pages at this time, but that stopped when Neo Tokyo is destroyed in the story, at which point the logo changed again and he removed the &quot;H&quot; from his surname. The fourth logo for &quot;Akira&quot;, used for chapters 49–71, returned to using &quot;katakana&quot; and was created by manga artist Hiroshi Hirata as Otomo wanted a Japanese calligraphy-style. Otomo&#x27;s name was still written in English until chapter 55. Having come to the &quot;final chapter&quot; of the series, Otomo figured he should change the logo again and went with an English font similar to Impact for the title and his name for chapters 72–120. He had already been using Impact with the top &quot;trimmed off&quot;, which gives a dignified and American comics feel, for the covers of the collected volumes. However, some fans believe some of the fonts actually used do not match the above named typefaces.

Otomo was meticulous in creating the collected volumes of &quot;Akira&quot;, often leading to them being released late. During serialization he faced not only schedule deadlines but also page limits and would have to cut content in order to fit said limit. He therefore would draw rough designs of what he actually &quot;wanted&quot; to draw in the margins of the chapters&#x27; manuscripts so that he would remember when time came to redraw the collected volume. He also had to make alterations in the collected volumes due to all the chapter title pages being removed, for example to make sure two-page spreads ended up on opposing pages. He wanted everything about the collected volumes, including the page count and paintings, to give a deep and full American comics feel. The covers are entirely in English, but he said this was not with an eye towards global distribution, he simply &quot;had this incredible enthusiasm to just try to make something new.&quot; With its all-English cover, B5 size and painted page edges, the first volume of &quot;Akira&quot; caused a sensation in Japan.

Otomo painted the cover illustration of the first volume very thick, while its inside cover illustration was influenced by Tetsuji Fukushima&#x27;s manga &quot;Sabaku no Maō&quot; and how he used colors like American comics. Because the first volume had a &quot;hot&quot; red cover, Otomo felt volume two should have a &quot;cool&quot; one. Its back cover image was created using video, and he said he ruined Kodansha&#x27;s VCR by repeatedly changing the color balance to get it right. Following the American and European cover images of the previous two volumes, Otomo felt the third should have an Asian one and so included the signs in its background. Its back cover is a composite photograph taken during a race at the Tokyo Racecourse when an image of &quot;Akira&quot; was shown on the jumbotron. Because the first three images had followed a pattern of &quot;action-silence-action,&quot; the artist figured volume four should continue it and so drew Akira sitting down for the cover. Its back cover features an original &quot;Akira&quot; pinball machine created by Taito with animation cels pasted onto it by Otomo. The cover of volume five was the first to feature an event actually related to the content inside the book. Its back cover features an Otomo-designed decorative bamboo rake that cost 2 million yen to make and features a custom made Miyako doll and mecha models. Otomo felt the sixth cover had to be cool because it was the final one, and as a result it went through the most number of rough designs as he had to really work to get Kaneda&#x27;s line of sight towards the reader without it feeling forced. For the back cover photograph, a life-size kiosk featuring numerous &quot;Akira&quot; goods was constructed in Kodansha&#x27;s studio with cooperation from Sudo Art Workshop and a stage manager from Nikkatsu. Construction, which included two fluorescent signs (cropped out of the final image) and handmade newspapers, and shooting took three days.

==Themes==
&quot;Akira&quot;, like some of Otomo&#x27;s other works (such as &quot;Domu&quot;), revolves around the basic idea of individuals with superhuman powers, especially psychokinetic abilities. However, these are not central to the story, which instead concerns itself with character, societal pressures and political machination. Motifs common in the manga include youth alienation, government corruption and inefficiency, and a military grounded in old-fashioned Japanese honor, displeased with the compromises of modern society.

Jenny Kwok Wah Lau writes in &quot;Multiple Modernities&quot; that &quot;Akira&quot; is a &quot;direct outgrowth of war and postwar experiences.&quot; She argues that Otomo grounds the work in recent Japanese history and culture, using the atomic bombing of Japan during World War II, alongside the economic resurgence and issues relating to overcrowding as inspirations and underlying issues. Thematically, the work centers on the nature of youth to rebel against authority, control methods, community building and the transformation experienced in adolescent passage. The latter is best represented in the work by the morphing experienced by characters.

Susan J. Napier identified this morphing and metamorphosis as a factor that marks the work as postmodern: &quot;a genre which suggests that identity is in constant fluctuation.&quot; She also sees the work as an attack on the Japanese establishment, arguing that Otomo satirizes aspects of Japanese culture: in particular, schooling and the rush for new technology. &quot;Akira&quot;″s central image of characters aimlessly roaming the streets on motorbikes is seen to represent the futility of the quest for self-knowledge. The work also focuses on loss, with all characters in some form orphaned and having no sense of history. The landscapes depicted are ruinous, with old Tokyo represented only by a dark crater. The nihilistic nature of the work is felt by Napier to tie into a wider theme of pessimism present in Japanese fantasy literature of the 1980s.

According to Dolores P. Martinez, the serial nature of the work influenced the storyline structure, allowing for numerous sub-plots, a large cast, and an extended middle sequence. This allowed for a focus on destructive imagery and afforded Otomo the chance to portray a strong sense of movement. The work has no consistent main character, but Kaneda and Tetsuo are featured the most prominently throughout.

==Publication==
Written and illustrated by Katsuhiro Otomo, &quot;Akira&quot; was serialized biweekly in Kodansha&#x27;s &quot;Young Magazine&quot; from December 20, 1982, to June 25, 1990. While drawing the manga, Otomo began work on an anime film adaptation, leading to a lengthy break between chapters 87 on April 20, 1987, and 88 on November 21, 1988. Otomo agreed to a film adaptation of the work, provided he retained creative control. This insistence was based on his experiences working on &quot;Harmagedon&quot;. The film was released theatrically in Japan in July 1988, and followed by limited theatrical releases in various Western territories from 1989 to 1991. Even when &quot;Young Magazine&quot; became a weekly publication in 1989, Otomo and &quot;Akira&quot; retained a biweekly schedule. The 120 chapters and more than 2,000 pages were collected and released in six volumes by publisher Kodansha between September 21, 1984, and March 23, 1993.

A five-volume anime comic version created using scenes from the film adaptation was published between August 29 and December 6, 1988, with newly painted covers by Otomo. The colored version created for America by Marvel Comics was published in Japan in 12 volumes between October 7, 1988, and September 20, 1996.

===English publication===
Otomo and Kodansha&#x27;s Yasumasa Shimizu visited New York City in 1983 to meet with Archie Goodwin of Marvel Comics, who had seen &quot;Akira&quot; and wanted to publish it in America. Shimizu said that Kodansha had received offers from many other publishers, including the newly established Viz Media, but Otomo chose Goodwin because he was really close to French artists that Otomo was a fan of. Otomo did not want &quot;Akira&quot; to be seen as some &quot;strange thing from Japan,&quot; leading to a meticulous and now-&quot;unimaginable&quot; process of altering the art and coloring to make it accessible to American audiences. Because Japanese manga is read right-to-left, the artwork had to be flipped to read the other way. But the process was not as simple as mirroring, backgrounds had to be redone in order to remove the Japanese sound effects and reshape the word balloons to fit the Roman alphabet. So Otomo went in and made substantial retouches and adjustments that are specific to the American version.

Japanese manga is largely in black and white, but it was decided to fully color the artwork in the English version of &quot;Akira&quot; to match most American and European comics. The coloring was done by Steve Oliff at Olyoptics, who was hand-picked for the role by Otomo after being introduced by Goodwin. Otomo sent Oliff illustrations that he colored with markers as samples. Oliff had also received slides from the anime film adaptation of &quot;Akira&quot; to use as reference. At one point, Otomo visited Oliff in Point Arena, California and worked alongside him for several days, but after the first 5 or 6 issues, Oliff said he was given free rein. Oliff persuaded Marvel to use computer coloring. The coloring was more subtle than that seen before and far beyond the capabilities of Japanese technology of the time. It played an important part in &quot;Akira&quot;″s success in Western markets, and revolutionized the way comics were colorized. Coloring lasted from 1988 to 1994, being delayed by Otomo&#x27;s work on &quot;Steamboy&quot;. &quot;Akira&quot; was the first comic in the world to be colored digitally, using computers. Its release in color led to the widespread adoption of computer coloring in comics and Oliff&#x27;s work on &quot;Akira&quot; earned him three consecutive Harvey Awards for Best Colorist (1990–1992) and the first Eisner Award for Best Coloring (1992).

&quot;Akira&quot; began being published in the American comic book format in the United States in 1988 by Epic Comics, an imprint of Marvel Comics. This colorized version ended its 38-issue run in 1995. Delays in the English publication were caused by Otomo&#x27;s retouching of artwork for the Japanese collected volumes. It was these collections that formed the basis for translation, rather than the initial magazine serialization. The Epic version suffered significant delays toward the end, requiring several years to publish the final 8 issues. Marvel planned to collect the colorized versions as a 13-volume paperback series, and teamed with Graphitti Designs to release six limited-edition hardcover volumes; however, these ceased in 1993, so the final 3 paperbacks and planned sixth hardcover volume were never published. British publisher Reed began releasing full color versions of the six &quot;Akira&quot; volumes in 1994. A partially colorized version was serialized in British comic/magazine &quot;Manga Mania&quot; in the early to mid-&#x27;90s. A new edition of &quot;Akira&quot; was published in six paperback volumes from 2000 to 2002 by Dark Horse Comics in North America and Titan Books in the UK. This version is in black-and-white with a revised translation, although Otomo&#x27;s painted color pages are used minimally at the start of each book as in the original Japanese volumes. In 2003, Tokyopop published the anime comic version in North America.

The English-language rights to &quot;Akira&quot; are currently held by Kodansha Comics, who re-released the manga from 2009 to 2011 through Random House. Kodansha&#x27;s version is largely identical to the Dark Horse version. In honor of the 35th anniversary of the manga, Kodansha released a box set in late October 2017, containing hardcover editions of all six volumes, as well as the &quot;Akira Club&quot; art book, and an exclusive patch featuring the iconic pill design. This release was presented in the original right-to-left format, with unaltered original art and Japanese sound effects with endnote translations.

===Sales and awards===
The first volume, which was released on September 14, 1984, significantly exceeded sales expectations, with its print run increasing from an initial 30,000 copies up to nearly 300,000 copies within two weeks, becoming the number-one best-seller in Japan before eventually selling about 500,000 copies. By 1988, &quot;Akira&quot; had sold approximately 2 million copies in Japan, from the first four volumes averaging about 500,000 copies each. The manga was published in the United States in 1988, followed by Spain in 1990, France and Italy by 1991, and then Germany, Sweden, South Korea, Taiwan, Indonesia, and Brazil thereafter. It was reported by Critique international that by 2000 &quot;Akira&quot; had sold over copies worldwide, including at least in Japan and overseas via the 38 issues of Epic Comics. By 2005, after the publication of the Dark Horse Comics editions in the original six tankobon volumes, &quot;Akira&quot; was published in more than a dozen languages worldwide. In 2020, the first volume of &quot;Akira&quot; became publisher Kodansha&#x27;s first manga to receive a 100th printing. At a price of in Japan and $24.95 overseas, the manga &quot;tankōbon&quot; volumes grossed estimated revenues of () in Japan and overseas, for an estimated total of grossed worldwide.

During its run, the &quot;seinen&quot; manga magazine where it was first serialized, &quot;Weekly Young Magazine&quot;, experienced an increase in its weekly circulation, from 1 million in 1986 to 1.5 million in 1990. At an average manga magazine price of at the time, the 120 issues serializing &quot;Akira&quot; sold an estimated total of 120–180.0 million copies and grossed an estimated ().

&quot;Akira&quot; has won much recognition in the industry, including the 1984 Kodansha Manga Award for Best General Manga. Fans in the United Kingdom voted it Favourite Comic at the 1990 Eagle Awards. It won a Harvey Award for Best American Edition of Foreign Material in 1993, and was nominated for a Harvey for Best Graphic Album of Previously Published Work in 2002. In 2002, &quot;Akira&quot; won the Eisner Awards for Best U.S. Edition of Foreign Material and Best Archival Collection. The 35th anniversary edition won Best Archival Collection again at the 2018 Eisner Awards, in addition to Best Publication Design.

===Critical reception===
&quot;Akira&quot; is credited with having introduced both manga and anime to Western audiences. According to Kodansha USA&#x27;s Naho Yamada, &quot;&quot;Akira&quot; ignited a new generation of dynamism not only in manga but also in European and American comics. Its impact shattered all borders.&quot; &quot;The Essential Guide to World Comics&quot; states that the translation of the work into French in 1991 by Glénat &quot;opened the floodgates to the Japanese invasion.&quot; The imagery in &quot;Akira&quot;, together with that of &quot;Blade Runner&quot;, formed the blueprint for similar Japanese works of a dystopian nature of the late 1990s, such as &quot;Ghost in the Shell&quot; and &quot;Armitage III&quot;. Yamada also said that &quot;Otomo jacked into his generation&#x27;s frustration with society, in the wake of the defeat of Japan&#x27;s liberal student movement, and created an epic that, in true Japanese fashion, processed societal trauma through cataclysmic visual symbolism.&quot; Writing for &quot;The Japan Times&quot;, Matt Schley said &quot;For many readers, &quot;Akira&quot; was a revelation. Each panel features a head-spinning amount of detail, and Otomo, an avowed film buff, keeps things moving at a breathless, cinematic pace.&quot; In her book &quot;The Fantastic in Japanese Literature&quot;, Susan J. Napier described the work as a &quot;no holds barred enjoyment of fluidity and chaos&quot;. &quot;Akira&quot; cemented Otomo&#x27;s reputation and the success of the animated adaptation allowed him to concentrate on film rather than the manga form in which his career began.

Katherine Dacey of &quot;MangaBookshelf&quot; called &quot;Akira&quot; one of manga&#x27;s &quot;greatest sci-fi epics.&quot; She also noted how Tetsuo and Kaneda seem like real teenage boys in the manga, not generic action figures like in the film&#x27;s &quot;grossly&quot; simplified depiction of their relationship. Although stating that &quot;Akira&quot;″s plot was still as topical as ever in the year 2009, Dacey felt that the art had not aged as gracefully.

In his reviews of the first three volumes of &quot;Akira&quot;, Mark Pellegrini of AIPT Comics strongly praised Otomo&#x27;s art as &quot;simple, but very lively&quot; and called him a master at drawing architecture. Pellegrini reviewed the series by making many comparisons to the animated film adaptation, calling the characterizations in the manga both &quot;better and on par&quot; with those in it.

Anime News Network had four writers review Kodansha USA&#x27;s 35th Anniversary box set of &quot;Akira&quot;. Austin Price and Lynzee Loveridge both gave it a perfect 5 out of 5 rating. Loveridge wrote that &quot;&quot;Akira&quot; still feels incredibly relevant 35 years later. Giving it a three ½ star rating, Amy McNulty praised Otomo&#x27;s art and setting. However, she called the characterizations weak and concluded that although &quot;Akira&quot; &quot;does little to appeal to those who aren&#x27;t interested in sci-fi, paranormal, or dystopian tales [...] manga fans owe it to themselves to at least check it out.&quot; Rebecca Silverman gave the series a rating of three out of five, calling &quot;Akira&quot; a must-read for anyone interested in manga.

While most of the character designs and basic settings were directly adapted from the original manga, the restructured plot of the movie differs considerably from the print version, changing much of the second half of the series. The film &quot;Akira&quot; is regarded by many critics as a landmark anime film: one that influenced much of the art in the anime world that followed its release.

A video game, simply titled &quot;Akira&quot;, based on the animated film was released on December 24, 1988, by Taito for the Famicom console. The game has the player in the role of Kaneda, with the storyline starting with Kaneda and his motorcycle gang in police custody. In 1994, a British-made action game was released for the Amiga CD32 and it&#x27;s considered one of the console&#x27;s worst games. In 2002, Bandai released a pinball simulation titled &quot;Akira Psycho Ball&quot; for the PlayStation 2.

On June 9, 1995, Kodansha released &quot;Akira Club&quot;, a compilation of various materials related to the production of the series. These include test designs of the paperback volume covers, title pages as they appeared in &quot;Young Magazine&quot;, images of various related merchandise and commentary by Otomo. Dark Horse collaborated with Kodansha to release an English-translated version of the book in 2007.

In 2002, Warner Bros. acquired rights to create an American live action film of &quot;Akira&quot;. Since the initial announcement, a number of directors, producers and writers have been reported to be attached to the film, starting with Stephen Norrington (writer/director) and Jon Peters (producer). By 2017, it was announced Taika Waititi would officially serve as the director of the live-action adaptation, from a screenplay he co-wrote with Michael Golamco. Warner Bros. planned to distribute the film on May 21, 2021, but after Waititi was officially confirmed to both direct and write &quot;&quot;, the film was put on hold and removed from the release slot.

On July 4, 2019, Bandai Namco Entertainment announced an anime television series to be made by Sunrise (now Bandai Namco Filmworks).

==Legacy==
&quot;Akira&quot; is considered a landmark work in the cyberpunk genre, credited with spawning the Japanese cyberpunk subgenre. It actually predates the seminal cyberpunk novel &quot;Neuromancer&quot; (1984), which was released two years after &quot;Akira&quot; began serialization in 1982 and was not translated into Japanese until 1985. &quot;Akira&quot; inspired a wave of Japanese cyberpunk-infused manga and anime works, including &quot;Ghost in the Shell&quot;, &quot;Battle Angel Alita&quot;, &quot;Cowboy Bebop&quot;, and &quot;Serial Experiments Lain&quot;. Tetsuo Hara cited &quot;Akira&quot; as an influence on the dystopian post-apocalyptic setting of his manga &quot;Fist of the North Star&quot; (1983 debut). Manga artist Tooru Fujisawa, creator of &quot;Great Teacher Onizuka&quot;, cited &quot;Akira&quot; as one of his greatest inspirations and said it changed the way he wrote. &quot;Naruto&quot; creator Masashi Kishimoto has cited both the &quot;Akira&quot; manga and anime as major influences, particularly as the basis of his own manga career. &quot;Bartkira&quot;, a fan-made web comic parody of &quot;Akira&quot; created by Ryan Humphrey, is a panel-for-panel retelling of all six volumes of the manga illustrated by numerous artists contributing several pages each, with Otomo&#x27;s characters being portrayed by members of the cast of &quot;The Simpsons&quot;: for example, Kaneda is represented by Bart Simpson, Milhouse Van Houten replaces Tetsuo, and Kei and Colonel Shikishima are portrayed by Laura Powers and Principal Skinner respectively.

The city depicted in the first two stages of the 1992 video game &quot;Last Resort&quot; is very similar to that of Neo Tokyo from the anime film. In the 1998 video game &quot;Half-Life&quot;, aspects of the level design were influenced directly by scenes from the manga. For example, the diagonal elevator leading down to the sewer canals as well as the design of the canals themselves are taken from scenes in the manga. This was confirmed by Brett Johnson, the developer who designed the levels. The &quot;NeoTokyo&quot; mod for its 2004 sequel, &quot;Half-Life 2&quot;, was also inspired by &quot;Akira&quot;. In the 2002 video game &quot;The King of Fighters 2002&quot;, Kusanagi and K9999 have an Akira-esque intro before they fight. Kaneda&#x27;s motorcycle appears in the 2020 video game &quot;Cyberpunk 2077&quot;.

The Akira Class starship from the &quot;Star Trek&quot; franchise, first introduced in the 1996 feature film &quot;Star Trek: First Contact&quot;, was named after the anime by its designer Alex Jaeger, of Industrial Light &amp; Magic. In the 1998 film &quot;Dark City&quot;, one of the last scenes, in which buildings &quot;restore&quot; themselves, is similar to the last panel of the &quot;Akira&quot; manga. Its writer-director Alex Proyas called the end battle a &quot;homage to Otomo&#x27;s &quot;Akira&quot;&quot;. Director Josh Trank cited &quot;Akira&quot; as an influence on the 2012 film &quot;Chronicle&quot;.

Rapper Kanye West has a tribute to the anime film in his 2007 music video for &quot;Stronger&quot;. Electronic pop group M83 created a three-part tribute to &quot;Akira&quot; (and other influences) with their music videos for &quot;Midnight City&quot;, &quot;Reunion&quot; and &quot;Wait&quot;. Rapper Lupe Fiasco&#x27;s 2015 album &quot;Tetsuo &amp; Youth&quot; was loosely inspired by the &quot;Akira&quot; character Tetsuo Shima.

In the original plans for the 2020 Tokyo Olympics and Paralympics Opening Ceremony, Akira was to be featured in order to appeal to Japan&#x27;s &quot;soft power&quot; among youth. The original plans featured Kaneda riding into the stadium on his motorcycle. As Japan scholar Tagsold notes, there is an inherent irony in the use of Akira to promote the 2020 Olympics. The original manga (and to a lesser extent the film) contains strong anti-Olympic sentiment and contains several references to the 1964 Olympics, and in the story the Olympics are also scheduled to be held in Tokyo in 2020, where they are to symbolize Japan&#x27;s rebirth and recovery from a nuclear disaster that takes place in the 1980s in the story setting (the dates differ between the manga and the film). Tagsold notes, &quot;By referencing the 1964 Games, Ōtomo paints a highly critical image of the first Tokyo Olympics, reflecting the mood of the early 1980s, when citizens vehemently opposed plans to host the Olympics in Nagoya.&quot; Nonetheless, the original plans also included Ōtomo creating an illustration for the ceremony, indicative of his own complex perspective on what the Olympics mean for Japan. Ultimately, the irony of an anti-Olympic story being used to promote the Olympics was avoided when the Olympics themselves were postponed due to the pandemic, and the original production team was replaced.

<text>A best practice is a method or technique that has been generally accepted as superior to alternatives because it tends to produce superior results. Best practices are used to achieve quality as an alternative to mandatory standards. Best practices can be based on self-assessment or benchmarking. Best practice is a feature of accredited management standards such as ISO 9000 and ISO 14001.

Some consulting firms specialize in the area of best practice and offer ready-made templates to standardize business process documentation. Sometimes a best practice is not applicable or is inappropriate for a particular organization&#x27;s needs. A key strategic talent required when applying best practice to organizations is the ability to balance the unique qualities of an organization with the practices that it has in common with others. Good operating practice is a strategic management term. More specific uses of the term include good agricultural practices, good manufacturing practice, good laboratory practice, good clinical practice, and good distribution practice. 

== In public policy ==

Best practice is a form of program evaluation in public policy. It is the process of reviewing policy alternatives that have been effective in addressing similar issues in the past and could be applied to a current problem. Determining best practices to address a particular policy problem is a commonly used but little understood tool of analysis because the concept is vague and should therefore be examined with caution. Vagueness stems from the term &quot;best&quot; which is subjective. While some research and evidence must go into determining a practice the &quot;best&quot; it is more helpful to simply determine if a practice has worked exceptionally well and why. Instead of it being &quot;the best&quot;, a practice might simply be a smart practice, a good practice, or a promising practice. This allows for a mix and match approach for making recommendations that might encompass pieces of many good practices. Eugene Bardach provides the following theoretical framework (eightfold path for best practices) in his book &quot;A Practical Guide for Policy Analysis&quot;, in 2011:

# Define the problem
# Assemble the evidence
# Construct the alternatives
# Select the criteria
# Project the outcomes
# Confront the trade-offs
# Decide
# Tell your story

Excessive optimism about the expected impact of untested smart practices is a common critique. If a current practice is known to be ineffective, implementing a promising alternative after weighing the alternatives may be worth the risk.

===Methodology according to Bretschneider et al.===

Bretschneider et al. offers an alternate methodology for Best Practices research in 2005. Bretschneider&#x27;s approach is much more technical than Bardach&#x27;s, and explores issues of completeness and comparability. He addresses the fact that fully establishing whether a practice is truly a best practice would require assessment in all contexts, while in practice, only example cases are analyzed. Bretschneider also stresses the fact that in order for something to be considered a &quot;best practice&quot; it must be arrived at through a comparative process between methodologies. In order for a &quot;best practice&quot; to be valid, it must take into account all relevant approaches, since neglecting to do so would lead to inappropriate usage of the term &quot;best.&quot; Comparing sample practices may yield a good practice, but may also be altogether unreliable, depending on how the sample was selected.

===Examples===

There are many examples of the use of best/smart practice evaluations in Public Policy. The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) produces a document called The Clean Energy-Environment Guide to Action, designed to share practices found to be successful and best by states, to determine what is most suitable for them to use in generating clean energy policies and programs. The guide includes 16 clean energy policies and programs that offer opportunities for states to save energy, improve air quality, lower greenhouse gas emission and increase economic development.

An example of a successful best practice from the guide is building codes for energy efficiency. This practice is to use building energy codes to set requirements that establish a minimum level of energy efficiency standards for residential and commercial buildings. California Energy Code Title 24 is one &quot;best practice&quot; that is highlighted in this guide. The following points for energy code implementation is to educate and train key audiences, supply the right resources, and to provide budget and staff for the program.

Eugene Bardach has a list of smart practice candidates in his book &quot;A Practical Guide for Policy Analysis&quot;, Eightfold Path (policy analysis). One example is the tutoring program for children in grades 1-3 called Reading One-to-One. The program from Texas includes one on one tutoring with supervision and simple structured instruction in phonemic awareness. Phonemic awareness is one highly regarded predictor of how well a child will learn to read in the first two years of school. The program takes advantage of the fact that many children, especially ESL students, fail in reading because it is very hard for second language students to understand and pronounce sounds in English. The program is easily duplicated at a relatively low cost because of the straight forward teaching materials, systematic methods and administrative oversight.

In September 2013 at the New York State Conference for Mayors and Municipal Officials, successes, ideas and information on best practices were shared among government peers. A best practice that was highlighted at the conference was how Salinas, California is rebuilding their economy by engaging technology companies with their agricultural business in order to grow jobs. Salinas is taking advantage of an idle opportunity. The area already has abundant lettuce fields and now the city is marketing itself as a lab for agricultural technology. This public/private partnership includes a new nonprofit called the Steinbeck Innovation Foundation to increase investment in new technologies to help the area&#x27;s agricultural industry.

==Use in health and human services==
In recent years, public agencies and non-governmental organizations have been exploring and adopting best practices when delivering health and human services. In these settings, the use of the terms &quot;promising practices&quot;, &quot;best practices&quot;, and &quot;evidence-based practices&quot; is common and often confusing as there is not a general consensus on what constitutes promising practices or best practices. In this context, the use of the terms &quot;best practices&quot; and &quot;evidence-based practices&quot; are often used interchangeably. Evidence-based practices are methods or techniques that have documented outcomes and ability to replicate as key factors. Despite these challenges, the literature suggests that there is some common use of and criteria for identifying best practices. For example, a general working definition used by the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) in referring to a promising practice is defined as one with at least preliminary evidence of effectiveness in small-scale interventions or for which there is potential for generating data that will be useful for making decisions about taking the intervention to scale and generalizing the results to diverse populations and settings.

Since evidence of effectiveness, the potential for taking the intervention to scale and generalizing the results to other populations and settings are key factors for best practices, the manner in which a method or intervention becomes a best practice can take some time and effort. The table below demonstrates the process for a promising practice to achieve the status of research-validated best practice.

The National Registry of Evidence-Based Programs and Practices (NREPP) is a searchable online registry of interventions supporting substance abuse prevention and mental health treatment that has been reviewed and rated by independent reviewers. NREPP accepts submissions for interventions that meet minimum requirements to be considered for review. Minimum requirements include (1) demonstration of one or more positive outcomes among individuals, communities, or populations; (2) evidence of these outcomes has been demonstrated in at least one study using an experimental or quasi-experimental design; (3) the results of these studies have been published in a peer-reviewed journal or other professional publication, or documented in a comprehensive evaluation report; and (4) implementation materials, training and support resources, and quality assurance procedures have been developed and are ready for use by the public. NREPP is not an exhaustive list of interventions and inclusion in the registry does not constitute an endorsement.

There is existing controversy about the lack of culturally appropriate evidence-based best practices and the need to utilize a research-based approach to validate interventions. Some communities have deployed practices over a long period of time that has produced positive outcomes as well as a general community consensus to be successful. The California Reducing Disparities Project (CRDP) is working to identify such practices. CRDP intends to improve access, quality of care, and increase positive outcomes for racial, ethnic and cultural communities. These communities have been identified as (1) African American, (2) Asian/Pacific Islanders, (3) Latinos, (4) lesbian, gay, bi-sexual, transgender, questioning, and (5) Native Americans. Strategic Planning Workgroups composed of mental health providers and community members as well as consumers and family members are given the task of identifying new approaches toward reducing disparities. The five Strategic Planning Workgroups work to identify new service delivery approaches defined by multicultural communities for multicultural communities using community-defined evidence to improve outcomes and reduce disparities. Community- defined evidence is defined as &quot;a set of practices that communities have used and determined to yield positive results as determined by community consensus over time and which may or may not have been measured empirically but have reached a level of acceptance by the community.&quot;

==In action==

===Clean air financing programs===
Financing Clean Air Programs, and example taken from NGA This is a quick guide put together by the NGA Center for Best Practices. It explores what clean air programs currently exist and how they are being financed. Rather than stating one best practice to tackling clean air, this report creates a table of the different programs, how they are being financed, and in what state. Governors and their staffs can then look for characteristics and solutions that are most realistic and applicable to their situation. The key is to tailor current practices that are in the world to the specific situation you are looking to solve. Best practices are meant to give insight into existing strategies.

=== Environmental management ===

The concept of best practice has been employed extensively in environmental management. For example, it has been employed in aquaculture such as recommending low-phosphorus feed ingredients, in forestry to manage riparian buffer zones, in livestock and pasture management to regulate stocking rates, and in particular, best management practices have been important to improving water quality relating to nonpoint source pollution of fertilizers in agriculture as well as the identification and adoption of best practice for controlling salinity. However, in the context of complex environmental problems such as dryland salinity, there are significant challenges in defining what is best in any given context. Best management practice for complex problems is context specific and often contested against a background of imperfect knowledge. In these contexts, it is more useful to think of best management practice as an adaptive learning process rather than a fixed set of rules or guidelines. This approach to best practice focuses on fostering improvements in quality and promoting continuous learning.

===Higher education===
STEM Program explanation is taken from Angela Baber&#x27;s report to the NGA. The NGA has identified science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) as important skills that need to be developed in community colleges in order to create a strong workforce. Many states are creating or have created STEM Programs to address this issue. In order for these programs to work governors should:
* &quot;Engage business to help ensure that community colleges meet regional STEM-skill needs
* Use community colleges to support new models of STEM education
* Reward community colleges and students for STEM course-completion
* Ensure that community colleges support more effective mathematics remediation
* Require that community college STEM credits and credentials are transferable.&quot;

===Health and human services===
The U.S. Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF) makes evidence-based recommendations on clinical preventive services. The Task Force recommendations are based on systematic reviews and assessment of the available medical evidence.
The San Francisco Public Health Department conducted The Transgender Best Practices Guide project, a best practices document for cultural and service competency in working with transgender clients within HIV/AIDS service- provision settings. Following an intensive literature search and consumer focus group, a Working Group composed of noted community leaders; activists, professionals, and transgender consumers participated in the development of the Best Practices guide. Topics covered by the Best Practices guide include mental health issues; gender identity; hormone use and clinical care practices. The Best Practices guide is currently in production; it will be published and distributed to EMA providers, as well as to select organizations nationwide. In addition, four large-scale EMA provider training will be provided to educate providers on the Best Practices recommendations and standard measures. This is the first national federally funded effort to develop a Best Practices guide for providers who serve the HIV positive transgender community.

===Charity/nonprofit sector===
The nonprofit/voluntary sector is generally lacking tools for sharing and accessing best practices. Steps are being taken in some parts of the world, for example in the European Union, where the Europe 2020 Strategy has as a top priority the exchange of good practices and networking (including the nonprofit sector). An initiative of sharing good practices in terms of human resources (HR) and leadership among European nonprofit organizations was financed by the EU and launched in 2013, called HR Twinning. The platform allows the public to search for good practices and its members the possibility to share their practices, engage in discussions in the forum section and enroll their organization. Membership is free. The project is currently limited to a European audience.

==Other domains==
Nearly every industry and professional discipline discusses best practices. Areas of note include information technology development (such as new software,) construction, transportation, business management, sustainable development and various aspects of project management. Best practices also occur in healthcare to deliver high-quality care that promotes best outcomes. Best practices are used within business areas including sales, manufacturing, teaching, computer programming, road construction, health care, insurance, telecommunication and public policy.

== Critique ==
There are some criticisms of the term &quot;best practice&quot;. Eugene Bardach claims that the work necessary to deem a practice the &quot;best&quot; is rarely done. Most of the time, one will find &quot;good&quot; practices or &quot;smart&quot; practices that offer insight into solutions that may or may not work for a given situation. Michael Quinn Patton jokes in his book about qualitative research and evaluation methods &quot;the only best practice in which I have complete confidence is avoiding the label &#x27;best practice and elaborates further:

The allure and seduction of best-practice thinking poisons genuine dialogue about both what we know and the limitations of what we know. ... That modeling of and nurturing deliberative, inclusive, and, yes, humble dialogue may make a greater contribution to societal welfare than the search for generalizable, &quot;best-practice&quot; findings – conclusions that risk becoming the latest rigid orthodoxies even as they are becoming outdated anyway.

Quinn proposes avoiding asking or entertaining the question &quot;Which is best?&quot; and says that more nuanced questions related to conditions and contexts should be asked instead. He further suggests terms which &quot;tend less toward overgeneralization&quot; like &quot;better practices, effective practices,&quot; or &quot;promising practices&quot;. Eric Darling states it is not best practice it&#x27;s common practice. Specifically relating to the field of projects based work Dr Darling asserts in the past work practices were pragmatic in order to get achieve the task, recent decades has seen rise in opinions with limited evidence of best. Further rather than best practice perhaps we should strive for evidence based practice. Scott Ambler challenges the assumptions that there can be a recommended practice that is best in all cases. Instead, he offers an alternative view, &quot;contextual practice&quot;, in which the notion of what is &quot;best&quot; will vary with the context. Similarly, Cem Kaner and James Bach provide two scenarios to illustrate the contextual nature of &quot;best practice&quot; in their article. In essence, such critiques are consistent with the contingency theory, which was developed during the 1950s and 1960s.

<text>State Route 46 (SR 46) is an east–west state highway in the U.S. state of California. It is a major crossing of the Coast Ranges and it is the southernmost crossing of the Diablo Range, connecting SR 1 on the Central Coast near Cambria and US 101 in Paso Robles with SR 99 at Famoso in the San Joaquin Valley.

The road that is now SR 46 was built and improved during the 1920s and was fully paved by 1930. The majority of SR 46 was originally designated as U.S. Route 466; however, after the latter was entirely removed from the U.S. Highway system, the eastern portion of the route became SR 46.

==Route description==
State Route 46 begins at SR 1 southeast of Cambria, about from the Pacific Ocean. It heads east as the Eric Seastrand Highway across the Santa Lucia Range on a relatively straight roadway built in the 1970s, bypassing the steep, curvy Santa Rosa Creek Road. After passing near several wineries, this first segment ends at US 101 north of Templeton, where SR 46 turns north, overlapping the US 101 freeway through the valley formed by the Salinas River to central Paso Robles. Immediately after splitting from US 101, SR 46 crosses the Salinas River, passing near the Paso Robles Municipal Airport, and then heads east through a hilly area with several wineries and the community of Whitley Gardens. It then runs partially alongside the Estrella River to a merge with SR 41 near Shandon and a rest area. There, it turns northeast, following Cholame Creek through Cholame Pass between the Cholame Hills and Temblor Range to the settlement of Cholame and the split with SR 41. After crossing into Kern County, the highway continues to rise as it heads east up the Antelope Grade to a summit near Bluestone Ridge before descending through Polonio Pass into the San Joaquin Valley. State Route 46 takes the southernmost crossing of the Diablo Range, which is one of the routes linking the Central Valley to the coast. Interstate 580, State Route 152, and State Route 46 are the major routes that cross the Diablo Range. This route is heavily used when the Grapevine is closed. Truckers who do not want to take SR 58 through Tehachapi can use this route to head to I-5 to the Bay Area, Northern California, and vice versa. Many people from the Bay Area also use this route to head to Tehachapi Pass to head to Interstate 40, the Antelope Valley, Las Vegas, and Mount Whitney if they do not want to use I-5.
Once it enters the San Joaquin Valley, SR 46, known as the Paso Robles Highway, follows an almost perfectly straight eastward alignment, crossing SR 33 at Blackwells Corner, passing through the Lost Hills Oil Field, and intersecting I-5 about past Lost Hills and the crossing of the California Aqueduct. SR 46 then passes through the Semitropic Oil Field about west of Wasco. SR 46 and SR 43 overlap for a short distance in the city of Wasco, and then SR 46 passes over Calloway Canal and Friant Canal before it ends at SR 99 in Famoso. The county-maintained Famoso Road continues east across SR 65 and into the Sierra Nevada foothills.

East of Paso Robles, SR 46 is part of the California Freeway and Expressway System, and east of US 101 is part of the National Highway System, a network of highways that are considered essential to the country&#x27;s economy, defense, and mobility by the Federal Highway Administration. The highway from SR 1 to SR 41 near Cholame is an eligible State Scenic Highway, but it is not officially designated as a scenic highway by the California Department of Transportation.

==History==
As part of the second state highway bond issue, approved by the state&#x27;s voters in 1916, Route 33 was created, linking the San Joaquin Valley trunk (Route 4, now SR 99) near Bakersfield with the coast trunk (Route 2, now US 101 in Paso Robles, passing through the Coast Ranges via Cholame Pass. The road was not yet built in 1919 when the Automobile Blue Book recommended only the county-maintained &quot;very poor road&quot; (now SR 58) via Simmler as a connection between the valley and Central Coast. By 1925, the Cholame Pass highway had been improved, and paving was completed in December 1930. An extension west to Route 56 (now SR 1) near Cambria was added in 1933; however, it ran along Santa Rosa Creek Road, north of today&#x27;s alignment.

The state sign route system was established in 1934 but the majority of Route 33 did not receive a state route designation, instead becoming part of the new U.S. Route 466. However, US 466 turned southwest from Cholame Pass along Legislative Route 125 (modern SR 41) to Morro Bay. Sign Route 41, which followed Legislative Route 125 northeast of Cholame, continued along Route 33 west to the coast. However, Route 125 had still not been paved between Cholame and Atascadero by the 1950s and so US 466 was moved to the longer but better-quality Route 33 via Paso Robles, replacing SR 41 to Paso Robles and overlapping US 101 to Atascadero. As SR 41 had not been signed over the unpaved road west of Paso Robles, it was truncated to Cholame. US 466 was eliminated in the 1964 renumbering, becoming SR 46 east from Paso Robles. However, instead of going south and west to Morro Bay, SR 46 continued west to Cambria and the road via Creston and Atascadero to Morro Bay (which had since been paved) became part of SR 41. A new two-lane expressway carrying SR 46 west from Paso Robles was built in the mid-1970s, replacing Santa Rosa Creek Road.
The two-lane stretch from Paso Robles to Cholame was known as &quot;Blood Alley&quot; for the large number of vehicle incidents, mainly head-on collisions, among the high volume of commuters, truck drivers and tourists. Between 1994 and 1999, there were 206 accidents along the corridor, resulting in 17 deaths, and another 38 deaths between 2000 and 2010. The intersection between SR 46 and SR 41, known locally as &quot;the Wye&quot;, was more accident-prone than the statewide average. The California State Legislature dedicated that intersection as the James Dean Memorial Junction on September 30, 2005, for the 50th anniversary of the actor&#x27;s death in a car crash near that site. The California Department of Transportation (Caltrans) carried out an interim safety project west of Cholame in December 1995, mandating daytime headlights and installing thermoplastic striping, a concrete barrier and rumble strips. In 2006, Caltrans identified SR 46 as a &quot;critical east-west corridor connecting the Central Coast and Central Valley areas of California&quot;, in an environmental impact statement that approved the road&#x27;s expansion. In 2010, the first stretch of newly widened road opened in Paso Robles, utilizing funds from a 2006 statewide ballot proposition. A series of additional projects and progressed eastward over the next decade.

In March 2022, construction began on the section near Cholame that led to the Wye. On April 25, 2023, workers broke ground on constructing a new grade-separated interchange at the James Dean Memorial Junction, which is scheduled to be completed in 2026. The portion of SR 46 leading to Kern County, known as the Antelope Grade Section, is scheduled to begin construction in 2026.

<text>At Last is the seventh studio album by American singer Cyndi Lauper. The album is a collection of covers of jazz standards, in addition to a cover of a contemporary song re-arranged into a jazz song. The album features a duet with Tony Bennett on &quot;Makin&#x27; Whoopee&quot; and was co-produced by Lauper with Russ Titelman. The album&#x27;s longbox was available only at Costco or Sam&#x27;s Club shops within the first two weeks when it was released. In 2008 Lauper said in an interview with Brazilian newspaper &quot;Extra&quot; that the album was a special project, with the intervention of the record company and that she does not consider it as a &quot;career album&quot;.

The album was well received by the public and music critics. AllMusic and &quot;Slant Magazine&quot; praised the album and gave it three stars out of five. The album debuted at #38 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200 with 47,000 copies sold in its first week, while the song &quot;Walk On By&quot; S.A.F. hit #10 on &quot;Billboard&quot;″s Hot Dance Club Play and the Eddie X Mixes version hit the same chart at #15.

To promote the album, Cyndi headlined &quot;VH1 Divas Live 2004&quot; alongside such artists as Patti LaBelle and Debbie Harry, performing &quot;Stay&quot; with Sheila E. on percussion. By 2012, it had sold 276,000 copies in the United States, according to Nielsen SoundScan.

<doc id="805258" wikidata="Q5253981" url="?curid=805258" title="Delilah (radio host)">
<text>Delilah Rene Luke (born February 15, 1960, in North Bend, Oregon) is an American radio personality, author, and songwriter, best known as the host of a nationally syndicated nightly U.S. radio song request and dedication program, with an estimated eight million listeners. She first aired in the Seattle market as Delilah Rene, though she is now known simply as Delilah.

==Early life==
In 1969, Delilah&#x27;s family moved from Coos Bay, Oregon, to neighboring Reedsport, where she attended school. At age 13, she secured her first radio job after winning a school speech contest judged by owners of KDUN, a local radio station. After graduating from high school in 1978, she worked at numerous stations in Oregon and Seattle before creating the format she became known for at KLSY in 1984.

==Radio show==

===Format===
The show, known simply as &quot;Delilah&quot;, begins at 7 p.m. and ends around midnight local time. She takes calls, emails, and letters sent in through her radio station’s website from her listeners. She encourages and supports her listeners and receives musical dedication requests. It is based in the Pacific Northwest.

One of the cornerstones of the show is its use of callers. Most of the time the caller tells Delilah their situation or story and then Delilah chooses the song that she feels best matches the caller&#x27;s situation. Callers are recorded during the show and replayed later, sometimes within the hour. Delilah also plays songs by direct request.

Originally heard only on weeknights, stations that carry the show have the option of carrying it six or even seven nights a week, with most stations airing at least one night of the weekend (usually Sunday) in addition to a weeknight show.

*Adult contemporary (AC): This is the most widely distributed version of the show between January and early November. It airs the usual adult contemporary music and is geared towards adults and their families. This is the version heard on most radio stations. It has also surfaced on hot adult contemporary and soft adult contemporary stations.
*Gold-based AC: A version of the show that features older adult contemporary hits.
*Christmas music: This is the only version that is produced between mid-November and Christmas.
*Christian adult contemporary (Christian AC) version: A version of the show featuring Christian adult contemporary music, specifically produced for stations and audiences favoring this genre.

The show includes &quot;Friday Night Girls&quot;, where she honors groups of her regular female listeners with prizes. She occasionally also calls &quot;Friday Night Girls&quot; chapters and speaks with them live on the air. 

She also airs a &quot;Delilah Dilemma&quot; each evening in the first and third hours of the broadcast, where she reads a dilemma submitted by a listener and offers advice on their situation.

===Distribution===
The program debuted on four stations at the beginning of 1996 and finished the year on a dozen stations. In 1997, Broadcast Programming started to distribute the program, which was later bought by Jones Radio Networks. Delilah moved to Premiere Radio Networks in 2004, where she remains to this day. There are nearly 170 radio stations, and the Armed Forces Radio Network, airing the program. Jane Bulman has been the executive producer of the show since its inception.

Many of the stations carrying the show are owned by Premiere parent iHeartMedia. In November 2006, WLTW in New York began carrying her. The version of the show that runs on WLTW is a separate, specially tailored version of the show produced just for that station, with music programmed by local WLTW Programming. In 2007, KODA Houston began carrying her show. In March 2012, she went on the air in Los Angeles on KFSH-FM, a Salem Broadcasting owned station playing Christian music. This addition debuted the Christian Music formatted version of the program. iHeartRadio has an online Delilah stream where listeners can hear the show all the time. 

In October 2017, Delilah temporarily went on hiatus after the suicide of one of her children.

On January 26, 2018, Seattle soft AC station KSWD announced that Delilah would host middays on the station beginning January 29. The station also picked up her syndicated show for Friday, Saturday, and Sunday nights.

In 2021, Delilah purchased KDUN in her hometown of Reedsport, Oregon, which carries her syndicated show.

===Audience===
The show is popular among women between the ages of 25 and 54. As of 2016, eight million people listen to the program at least once a week.

According to a Bloomberg interview, Delilah has seen her reported audience numbers plummet in cities where Nielsen Audio has adopted the Portable People Meter for tracking listenership.

===In popular culture===
The show plays a role in the Hallmark Channel television series &quot;Cedar Cove&quot;, which is based on writer Debbie Macomber&#x27;s book series and set in a fictional Pacific coast town in Washington state. Quotes and other inspirational pieces voiced by Delilah, especially for the series set up some of the plot devices that occur in the course of each episode.

The show can be heard in the 2018 film &quot;I Can Only Imagine&quot;, the biographical story of MercyMe lead singer Bart Millard.

In episode 5 of season 3 of the TV show &quot;Louie&quot; Maria Bamford mentions listening to Delilah and does an impression of a back and forth between a caller and Delilah.

==Personal life==
Delilah has been married four times and divorced three times. In October 2012, she married Paul Warner.

Delilah has had as many as 15 children, 11 of whom were adopted. Her 16-year-old son, Sammy Young Dzolali Rene, died on March 12, 2012, from complications from sickle-cell anemia. On October 3, 2017, her 18-year-old biological son Zachariah died by suicide. Her stepson Ryan died in December 2019.

She lives near Port Orchard, Washington.

<doc id="805262" wikidata="Q7349573" url="?curid=805262" title="Robert Sangster">
<text>Robert Edmund Sangster (23 May 1936 – 7 April 2004) was a British businessman, thoroughbred racehorse owner and breeder. Sangster&#x27;s horses won 27 European Classics and more than 100 Group One races, including two Epsom Derbys, four Irish Derbys, two French Derbys, three Prix de l&#x27;Arc de Triomphes, as well as the Breeders&#x27; Cup Mile and the Melbourne Cup. He was British flat racing Champion Owner five times.

From the mid-1970s, in partnership with John Magnier and Vincent O&#x27;Brien, Sangster transformed the sport of thoroughbred horseracing. Their dramatic buying of American-bred yearlings at the Keeneland Sales in Kentucky led to tremendous success and established the Coolmore Stud in Ireland as one of the principal powers in the bloodstock world.

==Early years and business career==
Sangster was the son of Vernon Sangster, who founded the Vernons Pools business in 1926, and his wife Peggy (Margaret) Smith. He was born in Liverpool and educated at Repton School, where he played cricket and boxed. He did National service with the Cheshire Regiment, winning a brigade heavyweight boxing championship in Berlin.

After National Service, Sangster joined the Vernons organisation, becoming managing director and then serving as chairman from 1980 to 1988. In that year, aware of plans for the creation of the National Lottery, he sold the Vernons Pools business to Ladbrokes for £90 million. Ladbrokes subsequently valued their acquisition at £1.

==Thoroughbred racing and breeding==
===Beginnings===
Sangster was introduced to thoroughbred racing through a friend, Nick Robinson, who recommended a bet on Chalk Stream, a horse owned by his grandfather, Sir Foster Robinson, in the 1960 Lincoln Handicap. Chalk Stream finished unplaced, but Sangster bought the horse as a wedding present for his fiancée and sent him to be trained by Eric Cousins. The horse won the Liverpool Autumn Cup that year and the Jubilee Handicap at Kempton Park the following May, hooking Sangster on racing. He started buying successful fillies with the aim of breeding his own horses and had his first win in a major flat race with Brief Star in the 1969 Ayr Gold Cup.

===The Brethren===
In October 1971 at Haydock Park, where he was sponsoring the Vernons Sprint Cup, Sangster was introduced to John Magnier, a stud farmer from County Cork who was then aged 23. Sangster entered into partnership with Magnier and the legendary Irish trainer Vincent O&#x27;Brien, investing in the Coolmore Stud in County Tipperary. The trio became known as &quot;the Brethren&quot;. Their idea was to use Sangster&#x27;s money to buy up the best yearlings at the Keeneland Sales in Kentucky, cornering the line of horses bred from the stallion Northern Dancer. Trained by O&#x27;Brien at his Ballydoyle stables these horses would go on to success on the track and command enormous fees standing at stud.

In 1975 they paid just under $1.8 million for a number of young horses, including The Minstrel, a colt by Northern Dancer out of Fleur, who went on to win The Derby in 1977. With the success of The Minstrel, Sangster and his partners established themselves as among the world&#x27;s leading racehorse owners, going on to extraordinary success. Between 1977-84 Sangster was Britain&#x27;s leading owner five times. There was a second Derby win in 1982 with Golden Fleece; three Prix de l&#x27;Arc de Triomphes, with Alleged, twice, in 1977 and 1978, and with Detroit in 1980; a Melbourne Cup victory with Beldale Ball, again in 1980; and a win in the Breeders&#x27; Cup Mile with Royal Heroine in 1984.

Initially, these horses were sold to stand at stud for syndicates at vast profits. The Minstrel, who had cost $200,000, was sold to America for $9 million; Alleged, bought for $175,000 as a two-year-old, went to Kentucky a year later for $16 million. These profits funded further purchases but by the mid-1980s, beginning with Be My Guest, Coolmore began to have its own champion sires in residence. Two of Sangster&#x27;s horses, Caerleon and Sadler&#x27;s Wells, the latter bred at Sangster&#x27;s Swettenham Stud, went on to be among the most successful stallions in the world. Sadler&#x27;s Wells&#x27;s legacy to Coolmore included Galileo and Montjeu, outstanding sires in their own right.

===Yearling sales===
Sangster continued to invest in yearlings in partnership with associates that included Danny Schwartz, who had made a fortune as a builder in California, and, from 1979, Stavros Niarchos, the Greek shipping tycoon and sometime rival of Sangster at the sales. In the mid-1980s competition, largely with buyers from the Middle East, pushed prices to extremely high levels. The average price at Keeneland&#x27;s July Select Sale rose from $53,000 in 1975 to more than $600,000 in 1984. In the same period the average at Newmarket&#x27;s Houghton Sales climbed from 7,600 guineas to 92,500 guineas. In 1983 Sheikh Mohammed al Maktoum paid $10.2 million at the Kentucky Sales for a yearling called Snaafi Dancer and two years later Sangster and his associates paid a record $13.1 million for Seattle Dancer. In response to these escalating prices, Sheikh Mohammed arranged two meetings in Dubai, the first with just Sangster and John Magnier, and a second including Vincent O&#x27;Brien and others. Although the details of these meetings were not revealed, what followed was a slump in bloodstock values at the sales of 1985 and 1986.

===Breeding empire===
Sangster&#x27;s thoroughbred racing and breeding empire included interests in England, Australia, Venezuela, the United States, Ireland, France and New Zealand. In the early 1970s he partnered with Magnier in developing the now common practice of shuttling stallions between the northern and southern hemispheres, helping to internationalise racing in Australia.
 He had bought Swettenham, a 200-acre stud farm in Cheshire, when he was 28 and in 1985 he paid £6 million for the famous Manton House stables near Marlborough in Wiltshire, which became the centre of his racing operations in Britain. He first installed Michael Dickinson as the trainer but replaced him with Barry Hills, then Peter Chapple-Hyam and, latterly, John Gosden.

Sangster largely withdrew from buying at the yearling sales, instead selling horses bred at his own studs. He won his final English Classic with Las Meninas in the 1000 Guineas at Newmarket in 1994, but saw horses he had bred win major races for other owners, including Dr Devious, who won the Derby in 1992, Balanchine, which won the Oaks and the Irish Derby in 1994, and Carnegie, which won the Arc in the same year. In 1993 Sangster sold his interest in Coolmore, although he retained breeding rights to a number of stallions, notably Sadler&#x27;s Wells and Danehill. His later breeding operations were focused mainly on Australia.

==Personal life==

Sangster enjoyed a lively social life, entertaining lavishly in his box at Royal Ascot. Barry Hills, who trained more than 30 Group-race winners for Sangster, said, &quot;We celebrated when we won, and usually celebrated when we lost&quot;. The racing correspondent Julian Wilson said of Sangster: &quot;His pleasures were boxing, champagne, golf, racing and beautiful women, in no particular order, and often more than one at the same time.&quot;

Sangster was married and divorced three times. In May 1960 he married Christine Street, leaving her in 1976 (divorcing in 1978) for socialite Susan Peacock, the ex-wife of Australian Liberal Party politician Andrew Peacock. That marriage did not last, with Sangster having well-publicised affairs with Jerry Hall and Susan Lilley. Sangster married Lilley in 1985, divorcing in 2000. By his first wife he had three sons, Guy, Ben and Adam, and a daughter, Kate. With Susan Lilley he had two sons, Sam and Max.

Sangster went into tax exile from the United Kingdom in 1975 and moved to the Isle of Man. Towards the end of his life he spent much of his time in Barbados and Australia.

==Death==
Sangster died of pancreatic cancer in London, on 7 April 2004, aged 67.

<doc id="805274" wikidata="Q1002202" url="?curid=805274" title="BugMeNot">
<text>BugMeNot is an Internet service that provides usernames and passwords allowing Internet users to bypass mandatory free registration on websites. It was started in August 2003 by an anonymous person, later revealed to be Guy King, and allowed Internet users to access websites that have registration walls (for instance, that of &quot;The New York Times&quot;) with the requirement of compulsory registration. This came in response to the increasing number of websites that request such registration, which many Internet users find to be an annoyance and a potential source of email spam.

==Use of the service==
BugMeNot allows users of their service to add new accounts for sites with free registration. It also encourages users to use disposable email address services to create such accounts. However, it does not allow them to add accounts for paid websites, as this could potentially lead to credit card fraud. BugMeNot also claims to remove accounts for any website, requesting that they do not provide accounts for non-registered users.

To help make access to their service easier, BugMeNot hosts a bookmarklet that can be used with any browser to automatically find a usable account from their service. They also host extensions for the web browsers Mozilla Firefox (but not on Firefox quantum yet), Internet Explorer, and Google Chrome (the extensions were created by Eric Hamiter with Dmytri Kleiner and Dean Wilson, respectively). There are also implementations in the form of a BugMeNot Opera widget, or UserJS scripts along with buttons, which makes it fully browser-integrated. An Android application is also available.

=== Opting out ===

BugMeNot provides an option for site owners to block their site from the BugMeNot database, if they match one or more of the following criteria:

* A community site where users register to change content, but not to view it (example: Wikipedia)
* The site is pay-per-view
* There is a fraud risk associated with the site due to accounts containing private financial information

No option is provided for users to request removing a block if a site ceases to meet the blocking criteria or has never met them in the first place.

Site blocking can be circumvented by BugMeNot users by publishing usernames and passwords under a similar, but different, domain name to which they apply. For example, the owners of the domain abc.def.com might request a block to be put in place, but this will not prevent users uploading access information under the name of def.abc.com. Since one domain owner cannot demand that another domain be blocked, the information remains and is accessibly provided that BugMeNot users tacitly agree that def.abc.com in fact refers to abc.def.com. For example, Wikipedia logins are in the database under wikipedia.net because wikipedia.com and wikipedia.org have been banned under the first criterion.

==Temporary shutdown and return ==
Nearly a year after it was created, BugMeNot was shut down temporarily by its service provider (at that time), HostGator. The site&#x27;s creator claimed BugMeNot&#x27;s host was pressured by websites to shut them down, though Hostgator claimed that the BugMeNot site was repeatedly crashing their servers.

The BugMeNot domain was transferred briefly to another hosting company, dissidenthosting.com, but before the site was set up, it began to redirect visitors to web pages belonging to racist groups, without the knowledge or consent of the site&#x27;s owner. BugMeNot moved again, to NearlyFreeSpeech.NET. BugMeNot&#x27;s move to this provider, which also hosts a number of highly controversial sites, prompted BugMeNot&#x27;s creator to say, &quot;Personally, I don&#x27;t care if I&#x27;m sharing a server with neo-Nazis. I might not agree with what they have to say, but the whole thing about freedom of speech is that people are free to speak.&quot;

Shortly after BugMeNot returned, reports surfaced that some news sites had begun to attempt to block accounts posted on BugMeNot, though the extent and effectiveness of such efforts, as well as compliance with BugMeNot&#x27;s Terms of Use, are not known.

==RetailMeNot==
The operators of BugMeNot expanded the &quot;MeNot&quot; network in October 2006 with the addition of RetailMeNot – a service for finding and sharing online coupon codes. Users can add coupons they have found through any method, as well as a description of the coupon and an expiration date. Users can also scan in printed coupons and upload them for others to print.

<text>Flo &amp; Eddie is a comedy rock duo consisting of Mark Volman (Flo, short for Phlorescent Leech) and Howard Kaylan (Eddie).

Kaylan and Volman were founding members of the mid-to late 1960s rock and pop band the Turtles. After the Turtles dissolved in 1970, Volman and Kaylan first joined Frank Zappa&#x27;s band the Mothers of Invention as &#x27;Phlorescent Leech &amp; Eddie&#x27;. Contractual restrictions imposed early in their career prevented Volman and Kaylan from using the name &#x27;the Turtles&#x27;, as well as their own names, in a musical context.

== History ==
===Career beginnings===
When the Mothers of Invention bandleader Frank Zappa was injured during a concert in London in 1971, Kaylan and Volman found themselves at an impasse, as the group was out of action for a time. They responded to this by recording &quot;The Phlorescent Leech &amp; Eddie&quot; on Reprise Records with most of the other members of the Mothers of Invention. Although this album failed to chart, the duo continued to release albums, including the more successful &quot;Flo &amp; Eddie&quot;; &quot;Illegal, Immoral and Fattening&quot;; &quot;Moving Targets&quot;; and &quot;Rock Steady with Flo &amp; Eddie&quot;.

===1970s===
During the 1970s, Kaylan and Volman continued to work as session musicians. They were backing vocalists on the T. Rex 1971 song &quot;Get It On&quot;, singing the inadvertent extra chorus that &quot;worked&quot;. The duo sang background vocals also on early T. Rex albums and were close friends of the band&#x27;s vocalist Marc Bolan. The duo was also in good relations with Alice Cooper, and they were the opening act on the &quot;Billion Dollar Babies Tour&quot; during the spring of 1973, going on to record background vocals for Cooper&#x27;s albums &quot;From the Inside&quot;, &quot;Flush the Fashion&quot; and &quot;Zipper Catches Skin&quot;. The duo was also the house band for the Canadian TV talk show &quot;90 Minutes Live&quot; with Peter Gzowski. They also sang background vocals on &quot;Telephone Booth&quot;, a 1974 song by Hoyt Axton.

===Early 1980s===
The duo sang backing vocals also on Bruce Springsteen&#x27;s first top ten hit on the &quot;Billboard&quot; chart, the 1980 song &quot;Hungry Heart&quot;, while in 1982, they released a four-song EP on Rhino Records (RNEP 603) under the name Checkpoint Charlie. The record is a dark but whimsical take on late 1970s/early 1980s German synth-pop, new wave and techno music, such as D.A.F. and Kraftwerk.

===Mid-1980s===
In 1984, as &#x27;The Turtles... featuring Flo &amp; Eddie&#x27; (together with three other groups from the 1960s: Gary Puckett, Spanky and Our Gang, and the Association), they traveled across the U.S. and Canada as The Happy Together Tour. The following year, they got together with the Buckinghams, Gary Lewis and the Grass Roots, for a 1985 version. For the eight months the tour was on the road, it was consistently one of the top 10 grossing tours in the country. 

===2000s===
On August 1, 2013, Flo &amp; Eddie, having gained ownership of The Turtles&#x27; recorded output, filed a lawsuit against satellite radio broadcaster Sirius XM for failing to pay sound-recording royalties in the states of New York, California, and Florida. On September 22, 2014, a California judge ruled that under state law, Sirius XM had to pay to digitally broadcast pre-1972 sound recordings. On June 22, 2015, a Florida judge ruled in favor of Sirius XM, as that state has no specific legislation concerning sound recording property rights. A few days later, Sirius XM agreed to pay $210 million to major record labels. On November 28, 2016, Sirius XM agreed to pay between $25–99 million to the pre-1972 song owners.

=== 2010s ===
During the summers of 2010 and 2011, Flo &amp; Eddie had heavy touring schedules throughout the U.S., both as part of the Happy Together: 25th Anniversary Tour, along with the Grass Roots, the Buckinghams, Mark Lindsay, and the Monkees&#x27; member Micky Dolenz (2010 only).

===Film and television work===
They also had a collaboration with animation studio Murakami-Wolf-Swenson, dating back to when this company made the cartoon scenes in Zappa&#x27;s film &quot;200 Motels&quot;. Flo &amp; Eddie did the music for their films &quot;Down and Dirty Duck&quot; and &quot;The Adventures of the American Rabbit&quot;, the television special &quot;Peter and the Magic Egg&quot;, and their &quot;Strawberry Shortcake&quot; television specials. The last one led this franchise creators at American Greetings to also bring in the duo for &quot;The Care Bears&quot; show.

<text>Dominican International School (), formerly Dominican School, is a private Catholic international school, located in Dazhi, Zhongshan District, Taipei City, Taiwan. The Sisters of the Congregation of the Religious Missionaries of St. Dominic own and manage the school.

The school is open to all foreign students. Dominican International School educates students from Kindergarten to Grade 12, including Advanced Placement.

==History==

=== Founding ===
In the latter part of 1956, permission from the Mother General of the Sisters was obtained to start a school that offered Catholic instruction to American dependents. The first school was organized for Pre-Kindergarten, Kindergarten and Grades 1 and 2 at a small rented house on Chang&#x27;an East Road.

In January 1957, the school was blessed by Anthony Riberi, D.D., Apostolic Internuncio, to China. Three Filipino Sisters started to teach the 16 enrolled children. Enrollment increased, and by June 1957, there were 76 students, and two additional Filipino Sisters had joined the faculty.

In the following school year, a larger house was rented on Liung Chung Street. In August 1958, a team of American Superintendents of Schools from Washington D.C. arrived. They examined the school and designated Dominican School as a U.S. Government contract school: a D.O.D. school. Grade 3 was added to the existing grades.

In 1959, a larger building was rented. Three more grades were added and more Sisters arrived from the Philippines. The first PTA was organized with volunteer officers. A vacant site was purchased for the erection of school buildings, including strips of land for granting access to the property. This remains the location of Dominican International School. Before materials could be brought in for the construction of the building, the access roads had to be completed.

The first cornerstone was blessed in a ceremony by a Dominican priest on August 4, 1959, after which construction started. On March 28, 1960, classes were held for the first time in the new school. On April 30, 1960, Thomas Cardinal Tien, S.V.D., D.D, blessed the school. Grades 7 and 8 were added in the following year. More Sisters came from the Philippines and the enrollment reached 600.

As time went by, a gymnasium was added, statues erected and a wall placed around the compound. In August 1960, 4 classrooms, a laboratory, a science room, a typing room and a music room were added to the existing school building. For the first time, there were Grade 9 classes and the enrollment reached 800. With the withdrawal of the American Forces from Taipei, Dominican School became an international school.

=== Twenty-first century ===
2006 was spent developing an electronic curriculum. This new system made the curriculum available online to all stakeholders. The initial stages of the development process were completed in time for the school&#x27;s 50th Year Celebrations in 2007.

In December 2008, the gymnasium, cafeteria, and the west wing of the main building were demolished to make way for the construction of new school buildings more suitable for modern education and technology. The groundbreaking ceremony for the new construction was held in June 2009, blessed by Archbishop John Hung, S.V.D. and construction started in August 2010.

Phase One, which included classrooms, an audio-visual room, an art room, science laboratories, and a brand new library were completed in the summer of 2013. State-of-the-art technology was installed. The remaining buildings will be demolished and rebuilt in 2014 and 2015.

== Academics ==
The modified American curriculum includes courses in Religious Studies.

The teaching faculty of the school represent many nations from four continents. Many faculty boast Master&#x27;s degrees or PhD&#x27;s.

In 2017 the school received accreditation from the United States.

== Extracurriculars ==
Students at DIS participate in many international events such as an annual Global Issues Network Conference (Manila in February 2012, Singapore in November 2012, Beijing in November 2013, and Jakarta in February 2014).

In January 2013 four Grade 12 girls and two Grade 9 boys went to an International Peace Conference

Students participate in the World Scholar’s Cup competition. They represented DIS with success in Shanghai (2010), Kuala Lumpur (2011), Bangkok (2012), and Dubai (2013).

== Athletics ==
