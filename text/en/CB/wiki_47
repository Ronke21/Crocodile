<text>Rod Liddle (born 1 April 1960) is an English journalist, and an associate editor of &quot;The Spectator&quot;. He was an editor of BBC Radio 4&#x27;s &quot;Today&quot; programme. His published works include &quot;Too Beautiful for You&quot; (2003), &quot;Love Will Destroy Everything&quot; (2007), &quot;The Best of Liddle Britain&quot; (co-author, 2007) and the semi-autobiographical &quot;Selfish Whining Monkeys&quot; (2014). He has presented television programmes, including &quot;The New Fundamentalists&quot;, &quot;The Trouble with Atheism&quot;, and &quot;Immigration Is A Time Bomb&quot;.

Liddle began his career at the &quot;South Wales Echo&quot;, then worked for the Labour Party, and later joined the BBC. He became editor of &quot;Today&quot; in 1998, resigning in 2002 after his employers objected to one of his articles in &quot;The Guardian&quot;. He currently writes for &quot;The Sunday Times&quot;, &quot;The Spectator&quot; and &quot;The Sun&quot;, among other publications.

==Early life and radio==
At 16, he was a member of the Socialist Workers Party, remaining a member for about a year, and was a supporter of the Campaign for Nuclear Disarmament (CND) around the same time. He recalled campaigning for Labour in the 1983 general election, canvassing votes by going door to door in full punk getup. He estimated that in doing so &quot;I must have singlehandedly lost my party a good 5,000 votes&quot;.

He attended the London School of Economics (LSE) as a mature student, where he read social psychology. His early career in journalism was with the &quot;South Wales Echo&quot; in Cardiff where he was a general news reporter and, for a time, the rock and pop writer. He worked between 1983 and 1987 as a speechwriter and researcher for the Labour Party.

Although Liddle considered becoming a secondary school teacher, he decided against it on the grounds that he &quot;could not remotely conceive of not trying to shag the kids&quot;, clarifying that he wouldn&#x27;t have &quot;dabbled much below Year 10.&quot;. Liddle instead returned to journalism after graduating from the LSE, and was taken on as a trainee producer by the BBC. 

Liddle was appointed editor of the &quot;Today&quot; programme in 1998. The programme had a strong reputation for its political interviews, but Liddle tried, with some success, to improve the programme&#x27;s investigative journalism. To this end he hired journalists from outside the BBC. Among the most controversial was Andrew Gilligan, who joined from &quot;The Sunday Telegraph&quot; in 1999. Gilligan&#x27;s 29 May 2003 report on &quot;Today&quot;—that the British government had &quot;sexed up&quot; the intelligence dossier on Iraq, a report broadcast after Liddle had left the programme—began a chain of events that included the death in July that year of David Kelly, the weapons inspector who was Gilligan&#x27;s source, and the subsequent Hutton Inquiry, a public inquiry into the circumstances of Kelly&#x27;s death. Liddle defended Gilligan throughout the controversy.

Under Liddle&#x27;s editorship, &quot;Today&quot; won a number of awards: a Sony Silver in 2002 for reports by Barnie Choudhury and Mike Thomson into the causes of race riots in the north of England; a Sony Bronze in 2003 for an investigation by Angus Stickler into paedophile priests; and an Amnesty International Media Award in 2003 for Gilligan&#x27;s investigation into the sale of illegal landmines, an investigation that attracted a lengthy legal action. While working for &quot;Today&quot;, Liddle also wrote a column for &quot;The Guardian&quot;. On 25 September 2002, referring to a march organised by the Countryside Alliance in defence of fox hunting, Liddle wrote that readers may have forgotten why they voted Labour in 1997, but would remember once they saw the people campaigning to save hunting. His column led &quot;The Daily Telegraph&quot; to accuse Liddle of bias and of endangering democracy.

The BBC concluded that Liddle&#x27;s comments breached his commitment to impartiality as a BBC programme editor, and gave him an ultimatum to stop writing his column or resign from his position on &quot;Today&quot;. He resigned on 30 September 2002. He said later that when he was editor he was ordered by BBC management to sack Frederick Forsyth from the show, and speculated that it was because of Forsyth&#x27;s right wing political views. The BBC replied that the decision was made for editorial reasons. Liddle also courted controversy discussing the public and police&#x27;s response to child pornography and highlighted the Pete Townshend case as a means to highlight problems with enforcing the law.

Since January 2025 he has presented a Saturday morning show on Times Radio.

==Television==
===&quot;The New Fundamentalists&quot;===
In &quot;The New Fundamentalists&quot;, a programme in the &quot;Dispatches&quot; strand broadcast in March 2006, Liddle, a member of the Church of England, condemned the rise of evangelicalism and Christian fundamentalism in Britain, especially the anti-Darwinian influence of such beliefs in faith schools; and criticised the social teaching and cultural influence of this strand of Christianity. The documentary was criticised by David Hilborn of the Evangelical Alliance, and by Rupert Kaye of the Association of Christian Teachers.

===&quot;The Trouble with Atheism&quot;===
In &quot;The Trouble with Atheism&quot;, Liddle argued that atheists can be as dogmatic and intolerant as the adherents of religion. Liddle said, &quot;History has shown us that it&#x27;s not religion that&#x27;s the problem, but any system of thought that insists that one group of people are inviolably in the right, whereas the others are in the wrong and must somehow be punished.&quot; Liddle argued, for example, that eugenic policies are the logical consequence of dogmatic adherence to Darwinism.

===&quot;Immigration Is a Time Bomb&quot;===
Liddle&#x27;s &quot;Immigration Is a Time Bomb&quot; was broadcast by Channel 4 in 2005. The complaints that followed it included that he should not have allowed British National Party leader Nick Griffin to speak unchallenged. Ofcom adjudicated that the programme was fair, and the complaints were dismissed. Liddle subsequently argued, after Griffin was acquitted in February 2006 of two charges of inciting racial hatred, that the charges were &quot;too ephemeral, too dependent upon the mindset and political disposition of the juror, and upon what is happening outside of the courtroom, on the streets.&quot;

===Other work===
In April 2007, Liddle presented a two-hour-long theological documentary called &quot;The Bible Revolution&quot; where he looked back in history to William Tyndale&#x27;s translation of the Bible in English and the effect this had upon the English language. On 21 May 2007, he presented an hour-long documentary, &quot;Battle for the Holy Land: Love Thy Neighbour&quot;, about the Israeli-Palestinian Conflict. He visited Bethlehem, Hebron and the Israeli settlement of Tekoa. Liddle sought to examine whether Israel was a true liberal democracy in light of its treatment of the Palestinians. He also appeared in Channel 4&#x27;s alternative election night episode of &quot;Come Dine with Me&quot; along with Edwina Currie, Derek Hatton and Brian Paddick.

With Kate Silverton, he presented the short-lived BBC2 political show &quot;Weekend&quot;, described by &quot;The Independent on Sunday&quot; as &quot;The worst programme anywhere, ever, in the history of time&quot;, and BBC Four&#x27;s &quot;The Talk Show&quot;. He continued to write for &quot;The Guardian&quot;, and became a team captain on &quot;Call My Bluff&quot;. He became an associate editor with &quot;The Spectator&quot;. He also writes for the men&#x27;s magazines, &quot;GQ&quot; and &quot;Arena&quot;, and a weekly column for &quot;The Sunday Times&quot;.

==Later print journalism==

===Allegations of misogyny and racism===
In August 2009, in his &quot;Spectator&quot; blog he wrote about Harriet Harman, deputy leader of the Labour Party, in unflattering terms. Liddle began the article by asking: &quot;So — Harriet Harman, then. Would you? I mean after a few beers obviously, not while you were sober.&quot; Tanya Gold wrote in &quot;The Guardian&quot; that Liddle had delivered a &quot;tissue-thin polemic.&quot; Pointing out that it was &quot;The Spectator&quot;″s cover story that week, Gold wondered if, after 100 years of striving to improve women&#x27;s rights, whether &quot;we&#x27;re back in the schoolyard – or is it the brothel?&quot; Rachel Cooke in &quot;The Observer&quot; nearly two months later recalled finding Liddle&#x27;s piece &quot;so disgusting I flushed violently all the way from my breastbone to my forehead when I first read it. I looked like I had German measles.&quot; Cooke went on to say: &quot;I would still like to do something really unpleasant to the man who wrote [the article].&quot;

Liddle said two months later that the Harman column &quot;was supposed to be a parody of guttural, base sexism&quot;, a joke he assumed readers would understand. After the negative response from Gold (and then Cooke, among other female journalists) he continued: &quot;And then I suppose I came to the conclusion – gradually – that I must have got it wrong.&quot; In June 2014, he said that of those he had offended, Harman was the one person to whom he would apologise.

In November 2009, again for &quot;The Spectator&quot; website, he offered &quot;a quick update on what the Muslim savages are up to,&quot; a brief article about the stoning to death of a 20-year-old woman in Somalia after she was accused of adultery, and the similar death of a 13-year-old the year before. He made remarks, considered sarcastic, that read: &quot;Incidentally, many Somalis have come to Britain as immigrants recently, where they are widely admired for their strong work ethic, respect for the law and keen, piercing, intelligence.&quot;

In December 2009, on his &quot;Spectator&quot; blog, Liddle referred to two black music producers, Brandon Jolie and Kingsley Ogundele, who had plotted to kill Jolie&#x27;s 15-year-old pregnant girlfriend, as &quot;human filth&quot; and said the incident was not an anomaly. He continued:

The overwhelming majority of street crime, knife crime, gun crime, robbery and crimes of sexual violence in London is carried out by young men from the African-Caribbean community. Of course, in return, we have rap music, goat curry and a far more vibrant and diverse understanding of cultures which were once alien to us. For which, many thanks.

When he was accused of racism, Liddle said he was instead engaging in a debate about multiculturalism. In March 2010 the Press Complaints Commission (PCC) upheld a complaint against Liddle, who became the first journalist to be censured over the contents of a blog, because he had not been able to prove his claim about the crime statistics. After the publication of London crime figures in June 2010, &quot;The Sunday Telegraph&quot; suggested Liddle was largely right on some of his claims, but that he was probably wrong on his claims about knife crimes and violent sex crimes.

In October 2010, Liddle called for the abolition of the Welsh language TV channel S4C as a result of the 2010 Comprehensive Spending Review. In his article for &quot;The Spectator&quot;, he described Welsh nationalists as &quot;miserable, seaweed munching, sheep-bothering pinch-faced hill-tribes&quot;.

Giving a speech at Durham University in December 2021, Liddle said: &quot;It is fairly easily proven that colonialism is not remotely the major cause of Africa&#x27;s problems, just as it is very easy to prove that the educational underachievement of British people of Caribbean descent or African Americans is nothing to do with institutional or structural racism.&quot;

===&quot;Independent&quot; editor rumour and Millwall supporters&#x27; website===
&quot;The Guardian&quot; reported on 8 January 2010 that the expected purchase of &quot;The Independent&quot; by Alexander Lebedev, a Russian billionaire, would be followed by the appointment of Liddle as editor. Roy Greenslade wrote on 11 January that the reports were provoking a &quot;major internal and external revolt&quot; by &quot;The Independent&quot;&#x27;s staff and readers. The stories about Liddle&#x27;s posts on Millwall Online apparently further reduced the likelihood of his being offered the job. Finally, on 19 February, Stephen Brook of &quot;The Guardian&quot; reported that Liddle was no longer in the running for the post. Tim Luckhurst, professor of journalism at the University of Kent, argued that Liddle&#x27;s prospects of editing &quot;The Independent&quot; were nullified &quot;by the people behind a viciously intolerant campaign of liberal bigotry&quot;.

In January 2010, the press drew attention to allegedly racist and misogynist comments posted under the username &quot;monkeymfc&quot;—a name Liddle has used—on Millwall Online, a fan club web forum with no official connection to Millwall Football Club. Liddle attributed some of the comments to opposition fans logging in under his name to embarrass him. He later said he had written some of the posts that were being criticised, including one in support of the BNP excluding Black and Asian people from the party. Another post, in which he joked about not being able to smoke at Auschwitz, led to his being asked to explain what he meant in &quot;The Jewish Chronicle&quot;. While he said in June 2014 that his comments were taken out of context, he said that he did not regret making them. &quot;No. Never. Absolutely not. I thought about my mates at Millwall Online, God I respect them so much more than these other people, these ghastly fucking people.&quot;

===Stephen Lawrence, Lee Rigby, disabled and transgender people===
In November 2011, an article by Liddle for &quot;The Spectator&quot; suggested the trial of two men accused (and later convicted) of murdering Stephen Lawrence would not be fair. It was referred to the Attorney General Dominic Grieve by the judge for possible contempt of court, and he ordered the jurors not to read it. Having decided that it might have breached a court order, Grieve passed the case on to the Crown Prosecution Service and the Director of Public Prosecutions. The decision that &quot;The Spectator&quot; was to be prosecuted by the CPS for breaching reporting restrictions was announced on 9 May 2012, with a court hearing scheduled for 7 June, although Liddle as the author was not himself liable for prosecution. Fraser Nelson, the magazine&#x27;s editor, announced that the prosecution would not be contested, and the magazine pleaded guilty at the hearing. The fine was £3,000, plus £2,000 compensation to Stephen Lawrence&#x27;s parents and £625 costs.

In January 2012, Liddle wrote that many people in the UK were &quot;pretending to be disabled&quot; in his column for &quot;The Sun&quot;, an opinion defended by James Delingpole who thought &quot;Rod&#x27;s point is well made&quot;. Frances Ryan in &quot;The Guardian&quot; accused him of &quot;belittling something that on a daily basis affects real people&quot; who can be &quot;a huge benefit to society. Maybe for a month Liddle would like to try that.&quot;

On 23 May 2013, Liddle wrote about the murder of soldier Lee Rigby near the Royal Artillery Barracks in Woolwich, London. In the original version of a blog article for &quot;The Spectator&quot;, he referred to the perpetrators as &quot;two black savages&quot;. After many objections to his language use, this phrase was modified. Liddle apologised.

In May 2015, the Independent Press Standards Organisation (IPSO) upheld a complaint from Trans Media Watch that Liddle had been discriminatory towards Emily Brothers, a blind and transgender Labour candidate at the 2015 general election, in two &quot;Sun&quot; columns published in December 2014 and January 2015. In commenting in the way he had Liddle had breached two sections of the editors&#x27; code.

===BBC coverage of the death of Nelson Mandela===
In December 2013 in a blog article for &quot;The Spectator&quot; website published shortly after Nelson Mandela died, Liddle wrote that the BBC coverage on his death was excessive. Richard Garside, director of the Centre for Crime and Justice Studies, tweeted a &quot;Rod Liddle decision tree&quot; which described Liddle as a &quot;wind-up merchant&quot;.

===Column on poppers and gay sex===
During a parliamentary debate on the Psychoactive Substances Bill – which &quot;makes it an offence to produce, supply, offer to supply, possess with intent to supply, possess on custodial premises, import or export psychoactive substances&quot; the Conservative politician Crispin Blunt admitted he used poppers:

And would be directly affected by this legislation. And I was astonished to find that it&#x27;s proposed they be banned and, frankly, so were very many gay men.

Liddle responded in his &quot;Spectator&quot; blog: So, Crispin Blunt MP feels hurt because laws proscribing (or &#x27;poppers&#x27;) would criminalise the entire gay community. ... I would have thought that the requirement for amyl nitrate to relax the sphincter muscle and lube to accommodate entry was God&#x27;s way of telling you that what you&#x27;re about to do is unnatural and perverse. Or your body&#x27;s way of telling you – your call. So eeeeuw. ... Crispin and others can always use a jemmy [crowbar] instead.

The satirical and current affairs magazine &quot;Private Eye&quot; described this as hypocritical, pointing out Liddle&#x27;s account in &quot;The Sunday Times&quot; of using Viagra in July 2004 in which he wrote that it was: &quot;The weirdest drug I ever took, far more psychologically disturbing than LSD. For the next six hours, I had this implacable, disembodied, unconscionably rigid appendage dragging me hither and thither&quot;.

A spokesperson from the LGBT rights charity &quot;Stonewall&quot; said of Liddle&#x27;s remarks: &quot;Comments like this are shocking and damaging, but we wouldn&#x27;t expect anything less from repeat offending bigots like Rod Liddle. The Government&#x27;s move for an immediate review of whether poppers are harmful is right, but banning them ... will cause confusion and drive gay and bi men who use poppers to seek out illegal drug suppliers from April onwards, putting their health at serious risk.&quot;

===Unfair treatment by &quot;Newsnight&quot;===
Liddle appeared on the BBC&#x27;s &quot;Newsnight&quot; hosted by Emily Maitlis to discuss Brexit on 15 July 2019. In the episode, Maitlis said Liddle wrote columns containing &quot;consistent casual racism week after week&quot; and asked Liddle if he would describe himself as a racist. After the episode was broadcast, a complainant alleged that Maitlis was &quot;sneering and bullying&quot; towards Liddle. An investigation by the BBC upheld these complaints, saying that Maitlis was &quot;persistent and personal&quot; in her criticism of Liddle thus &quot;leaving her open to the charge that she had failed to be even-handed&quot; in the discussion.

===Column on Muslim voters===
In October 2019, Liddle penned a column in &quot;The Spectator&quot; commenting on the forthcoming December 2019 UK general election, which suggested that the election should be held on a Muslim holy day to reduce the Labour vote.
The column was criticised by senior political figures including Chancellor of the Exchequer Sajid Javid and former Conservative Deputy Prime Minister David Lidington. Liddle defended the content as being humorous. The article also criticised the Labour MP Rosie Duffield&#x27;s recent speech about her experience of trying to exit an abusive relationship; Duffield described the article as &quot;racist and misogynistic&quot;.

==Books==
In 2003, Liddle wrote a collection of short stories, &quot;Too Beautiful For You&quot;. He said he has always wanted to be a writer, and saw journalism as a cop-out. He is also the author of &quot;Love Will Destroy Everything&quot; (2007) and the co-author of &quot;The Best of Liddle Britain&quot; (2007).

&quot;Selfish Whining Monkeys: How we Ended Up Greedy, Narcissistic and Unhappy&quot;, appeared in 2014. Admitting to having paid little attention to Liddle&#x27;s journalism, Will Self, in his review for &quot;The Guardian&quot; wrote: &quot;it&#x27;s so much more authoritative to hear a man condemned out of his own mouth over 200-plus pages than it is to assay him on the basis of newspaper columns, which, by and large, favour polarised views tendentiously expressed.&quot; Despite his serious reservations about Liddle&#x27;s writing, Self concludes: &quot;The peculiar thing is that I can&#x27;t find it in my heart of hearts to dislike the man, I think there&#x27;s good in him and that he can change his bilious complexion.&quot; Liddle responded to Self&#x27;s review in an interview with Archie Bland of &quot;The Independent&quot; a few weeks later: &quot;He reviewed what he thought I was, not what the book was about. Bizarre. I think it&#x27;s slightly deranged.&quot;

In July 2019 Liddle published &quot;The Great Betrayal&quot;, a book about Brexit. The book was reviewed positively by Professor Matthew Goodwin in &quot;The Sunday Times&quot;, who called it &quot;a no-holds-barred attack on the Establishment&#x27;s blocking of Brexit&quot;. Harry Mount at &quot;The Spectator&quot; called the book &quot;very engaging&quot;, despite noting concerns that the book&#x27;s claim of a betrayal of Brexit possibly proving to be unfounded. However, Fintan O&#x27;Toole writing for &quot;The Guardian&quot; said the book was &quot;as untroubled by facts as by logic&quot;.

==Personal life==
Liddle met Rachel Royce, a television presenter, at the BBC in 1993, and the couple soon became romantically involved. In January 2004 the couple married at a ceremony in Malaysia. They had been living in Heytesbury, Wiltshire, and had two sons together, Tyler and Wilder. Six months later, Liddle moved in with Alicia Monckton, a 22-year-old receptionist at &quot;The Spectator&quot;. It transpired that he had cut short his honeymoon with Royce so that he could be with Monckton. Following their divorce, Liddle and Royce exchanged attacks in the media. Liddle called her a &quot;total slut and slattern&quot;, and Royce wrote an article in the &quot;Daily Mail&quot; titled &quot;My cheating husband Rod, 10 bags of manure and me the bunny boiler. As for The Slapper... she&#x27;s welcome to him&quot;.

On 5 May 2005, he was arrested for common assault against Monckton, who was 20 weeks pregnant at the time. He admitted the offence and accepted a police caution, but asserted later that he did so only because it was the quickest way for him to be released, and that he had not assaulted her. The couple&#x27;s daughter, Emmeline, named after the suffragette, Emmeline Pankhurst, was born in October 2005. The couple married in September 2008.

==Political career==

Liddle stood as a candidate for the SDP in Middlesbrough South and East Cleveland during the 2024 United Kingdom General Election, a seat held at the time of the election by Sir Simon Clarke, a Conservative. Liddle gained 1,835 votes and came fourth, with the Labour Party defeating Clarke to win the seat. Liddle originally joined the SDP in 2019, noting that as a political movement &quot;it stresses the commonality shared between citizens, rather than the differences&quot;.

<doc id="816867" wikidata="Q411478" url="?curid=816867" title="Fluconazole">
<text>Fluconazole is an antifungal medication used for a number of fungal infections. This includes candidiasis, blastomycosis, coccidioidomycosis, cryptococcosis, histoplasmosis, dermatophytosis, and tinea versicolor. It is also used to prevent candidiasis in those who are at high risk such as following organ transplantation, low birth weight babies, and those with low blood neutrophil counts. It is given either by mouth or by injection into a vein.
Common side effects include vomiting, diarrhea, rash, and increased liver enzymes. Serious side effects may include liver problems, QT prolongation, and seizures. During pregnancy it may increase the risk of miscarriage while large doses may cause birth defects. Fluconazole is in the azole antifungal family of medication. It is believed to work by affecting the fungal cellular membrane.
Fluconazole was patented in 1981 and came into commercial use in 1988. It is on the World Health Organization&#x27;s List of Essential Medicines. Fluconazole is available as a generic medication. In 2022, it was the 160th most commonly prescribed medication in the United States, with more than 3million prescriptions.

==Medical uses==
Fluconazole is a first-generation triazole antifungal medication. It differs from earlier azole antifungals (such as ketoconazole) in that its structure contains a triazole ring instead of an imidazole ring. While the imidazole antifungals are mainly used topically, fluconazole and certain other triazole antifungals are preferred when systemic treatment is required because of their improved safety and predictable absorption when administered orally.

Fluconazole&#x27;s spectrum of activity includes most &quot;Candida&quot; species (but not &quot;Candida krusei&quot; or &quot;Candida glabrata&quot;), &quot;Cryptococcus neoformans&quot;, some dimorphic fungi, and dermatophytes, among others. Common uses include:
* The treatment of non-systemic &quot;Candida&quot; infections of the vagina (&quot;yeast infections&quot;), throat, and mouth.
* Certain systemic &quot;Candida&quot; infections in people with healthy immune systems, including infections of the bloodstream, kidney, or joints. Other antifungals are usually preferred when the infection is in the heart or central nervous system, and for the treatment of active infections in people with weak immune systems.
* The prevention of &quot;Candida&quot; infections in people with weak immune systems, such as those neutropenic due to cancer chemotherapy, those with advanced HIV infections, transplant patients, and premature infants. 
* As a second-line agent for the treatment of cryptococcal meningoencephalitis, a fungal infection of the central nervous system.

===Resistance===
Antifungal resistance to drugs in the azole class tends to occur gradually over the course of prolonged drug therapy, resulting in clinical failure in immunocompromised patients (e.g., patients with advanced HIV receiving treatment for thrush or esophageal &quot;Candida&quot; infection).

In &quot;C. albicans&quot;, resistance occurs by way of mutations in the &quot;ERG11&quot; gene, which codes for 14α-demethylase. These mutations prevent the azole drug from binding, while still allowing binding of the enzyme&#x27;s natural substrate, lanosterol. Development of resistance to one azole in this way will confer resistance to all drugs in the class. Another resistance mechanism employed by both &quot;C. albicans&quot; and &quot;C. glabrata&quot; is increasing the rate of efflux of the azole drug from the cell, by both ATP-binding cassette and major facilitator superfamily transporters. Other gene mutations are also known to contribute to development of resistance. &quot;C. glabrata&quot; develops resistance by up regulating CDR genes, and resistance in &quot;C. krusei&quot; is mediated by reduced sensitivity of the target enzyme to inhibition by the agent.

The full spectrum of fungal susceptibility and resistance to fluconazole can be found in the product data sheet. According to the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, fluconazole resistance among &quot;Candida&quot; strains in the US is about 7%.

=== Combating Resistance ===
The rising fungal resistance to fluconazole and related azole drugs spurs the need to find effective combative solutions swiftly. Rising resistance raises concerns since fluconazole is commonly used due to its inexpensiveness and ease of administration, according to the World Health Organization.

One possible solution to counter the increasing prevalence of Candida infections–fungal infections caused by the yeast Candida–is combination antifungal therapy, combining natural components with commercial antifungal drugs to combat resistance. Research shows that natural substances can have specified interactions with cell components, increasing the intracellular concentration of associated antifungal drugs and their effectiveness. For example, Brazilian red propolis, an organic bee liquid, synergizes with fluconazole to combat common yeast infections such as &quot;C. parapsilosis&quot; and &quot;C. glabrata&quot;. The essential oil from &quot;Nectandra lanceolata&quot;, a tree species native to wet tropical biomes, plays a similar role in ciclopirox, another common antifungal.

While combination therapy offers the benefits of faster and more extensive fungal eradication, including a reduced risk of resistance or tolerance, it also presents challenges. These include potential increases in toxicity, costs, and the need for standardized practices to test the efficacy of the combination. Therefore, it is crucial to critically evaluate the role of combination therapy. 

An alternative to combination therapy for those who had prior exposure to Azoles is antifungal drugs of class echinocandins, recommended as the first method of treatment against invasive candidiasis. The three echinocandins currently licensed for medical use, namely anidulafungin, caspofungin, and micafungin, are potent against candidiasis, which has grown resistant to fluconazole because of the differences in their action mechanism. However, resistance to echinocandins can still develop through point mutations within highly conserved regions of the FKS1 and FKS2 genes through the exposure of members of this class. These genes encode for an enzyme called β-1,3-glucan synthase, responsible for building the yeast’s cell wall. Mutations in this enzyme reduce resistance to antifungal medications that target this enzyme and affect the yeast’s ability to construct its cell wall. 

Another promising avenue is the integration of phage therapy, which has shown successive results in functional therapies. Phages, viruses that infect microbes including fungi, exhibit potent antimicrobial effects against various resistant fungal strains, demonstrating remarkable specificity and efficacy. These viruses are integral components of diverse ecosystems, including the human microbiome. Their unique attributes, such as specificity, potency, compatibility with biological systems, and ability to kill fungi, make them attractive candidates for therapeutic interventions. However, challenges remain in terms of their production scalability, formulation, stability, and the emergence of fungal resistance, which hinders their widespread adoption. Prior to clinical use, phages intended for therapy require thorough purification, characterization, and validation of their virulence. While further research is needed, phage therapy holds promise in the fight against antifungal resistance that other therapies struggle to address.

==Contraindications==
Fluconazole is contraindicated in patients who:
* Drink alcohol
* have known hypersensitivity to other azole medicines such as ketoconazole;
* are taking terfenadine, if 400 mg per day multidose of fluconazole is administered;
* concomitant administration of fluconazole and quinidine, especially when fluconazole is administered in high dosages;
* take SSRIs such as fluoxetine or sertraline.

==Side effects==
Adverse drug reactions associated with fluconazole therapy include:
* Common (≥1% of patients): rash, headache, dizziness, nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain, diarrhea, and/or elevated liver enzymes
* Infrequent (0.1–1% of patients): anorexia, fatigue, constipation
* Rare (&lt;0.1% of patients): oliguria, hypokalaemia, paraesthesia, seizures, alopecia, Stevens–Johnson syndrome, thrombocytopenia, other blood dyscrasias, serious hepatotoxicity including liver failure, anaphylactic/anaphylactoid reactions
* Very rare: prolonged QT interval, &quot;torsades de pointes&quot;
* In 2011, the US FDA reports that treatment with chronic, high doses of fluconazole during the first trimester of pregnancy may be associated with a rare and distinct set of birth defects in infants.

If taken during pregnancy it may result in harm. These cases of harm, however, were only in women who took large doses for most of the first trimester.

Fluconazole is secreted in human milk at concentrations similar to plasma.

Fluconazole therapy has been associated with QT interval prolongation, which may lead to serious cardiac arrhythmias. Thus, it is used with caution in patients with risk factors for prolonged QT interval, such as electrolyte imbalance or use of other drugs that may prolong the QT interval (particularly cisapride and pimozide).

Some people are allergic to azoles, so those allergic to other azole drugs might be allergic to fluconazole. That is, some azole drugs have adverse side-effects. Some azole drugs may disrupt estrogen production in pregnancy, affecting pregnancy outcome.
Oral fluconazole is not associated with a significantly increased risk of birth defects overall, although it does increase the odds ratio of tetralogy of Fallot, but the absolute risk is still low. Women using fluconazole during pregnancy have a 50% higher risk of spontaneous abortion.

Fluconazole should not be taken with cisapride (Propulsid) due to the possibility of serious, even fatal, heart problems. In rare cases, severe allergic reactions including anaphylaxis may occur.

Powder for oral suspension contains sucrose and should not be used in patients with hereditary fructose, glucose/galactose malabsorption or sucrase-isomaltase deficiency. Capsules contain lactose and should not be given to patients with rare hereditary problems of galactose intolerance, Lapp lactase deficiency, or glucose-galactose malabsorption 

== Interactions ==

Fluconazole is an inhibitor of the human cytochrome P450 system, particularly the isozyme CYP2C19 (CYP3A4 and CYP2C9 to lesser extent) In theory, therefore, fluconazole decreases the metabolism and increases the concentration of any drug metabolised by these enzymes. In addition, its potential effect on QT interval increases the risk of cardiac arrhythmia if used concurrently with other drugs that prolong the QT interval. Berberine has been shown to exert synergistic effects with fluconazole even in drug-resistant &quot;Candida albicans&quot; infections. Fluconazole may increase the serum concentration of Erythromycin (Risk X: avoid combination).

==Pharmacology==

===Pharmacodynamics===
Like other imidazole- and triazole-class antifungals, fluconazole inhibits the fungal cytochrome P450 enzyme 14α-demethylase. Mammalian demethylase activity is much less sensitive to fluconazole than fungal demethylase. This inhibition prevents the conversion of lanosterol to ergosterol, an essential component of the fungal cytoplasmic membrane, and subsequent accumulation of 14α-methyl sterols. Fluconazole is primarily fungistatic; however, it may be fungicidal against certain organisms in a dose-dependent manner, specifically &quot;Cryptococcus&quot;.

===Pharmacokinetics===
Following oral dosing, fluconazole is almost completely absorbed within two hours. Bioavailability is not significantly affected by the absence of stomach acid. Concentrations measured in the urine, tears, and skin are approximately 10 times the plasma concentration, whereas saliva, sputum, and vaginal fluid concentrations are approximately equal to the plasma concentration, following a standard dose range of between 100 mg and 400 mg per day. The elimination half-life of fluconazole follows zero order, and only 10% of elimination is due to metabolism, the remainder being excreted in urine and sweat. Patients with impaired renal function will be at risk of overdose.

In a bulk powder form, it appears as a white crystalline powder, and it is very slightly soluble in water and soluble in alcohol.

==History==
Fluconazole was patented by Pfizer in 1981 in the United Kingdom and came into commercial use in 1988. Patent expirations occurred in 2004 and 2005.

<text>A time ball or timeball is a time-signalling device. It consists of a large, painted wooden or metal ball that is dropped at a predetermined time, principally to enable navigators aboard ships offshore to verify the setting of their marine chronometers. Accurate timekeeping is essential to the determination of longitude at sea.

Although time balls have since been replaced by electronic time signals, some time balls have remained operational as historical tourist attractions.

==History==
The fall of a little ball was in antiquity a way to show to people the time. Ancient Greek clocks had this system in the main square of a city, as in the city of Gaza in the post-Alexander era, and as described by Procopius in his book on Edifices.
Time ball stations set their clocks according to transit observations of the positions of the sun and stars. Originally they either had to be stationed at the observatory, or had to keep a very accurate clock at the station which was set manually to observatory time. Following the introduction of the electric telegraph around 1850, time balls could be located at a distance from their source of mean time and operated remotely.

The first modern time ball was erected at Portsmouth, England, in 1829 by its inventor Robert Wauchope, a captain in the Royal Navy. Others followed in the major ports of the United Kingdom (including Liverpool) and around the maritime world. One was installed in 1833 at the Greenwich Observatory in London by the Astronomer Royal, John Pond, originally to enable tall ships in the Thames to set their marine chronometers, and the time ball has dropped at 1 p.m. every day since then. Wauchope submitted his scheme to American and French ambassadors when they visited England. The United States Naval Observatory was established in Washington, D.C., and the first American time ball went into service in 1845.

Time balls were usually dropped at 1 p.m. (although in the United States they were dropped at noon). They were raised half way about 5 minutes earlier to alert the ships, then with 2–3 minutes to go they were raised the whole way. The time was recorded when the ball began descending, not when it reached the bottom.
With the commencement of radio time signals (in Britain from 1924), time balls gradually became obsolete and many were demolished in the 1920s.

A contemporary version of the concept has been used since 31 December 1907 at New York City&#x27;s Times Square as part of its New Year&#x27;s Eve celebrations; at 11:59 p.m., a lit ball descends from a pole on the roof of One Times Square over the course of 60 seconds, reaching its conclusion at 12:00 a.m. The spectacle—which has given rise to many similar events—was inspired by an organizer having seen the time ball on the Western Union Building in operation.

==Around the world==
Over sixty time balls remain standing, though many are no longer operational. Existing time balls include:

===Australia===
* The Old Windmill, Brisbane, Queensland
* Fremantle, Western Australia
* Sydney Observatory, New South Wales
* Newcastle Customs House, New South Wales
* Semaphore, South Australia
* Williamstown Lighthouse, Victoria
* Geelong Telegraph Station, Victoria

===Canada===
* Citadelle of Quebec, Quebec City no longer true.
Clearly seen from the river and aligned on the meridian for observation purposes, Building 20, also known as the Ball House, is the former observatory and time ball tower. 

===New Zealand===
In March 1864 New Zealand&#x27;s first time ball was established at Wellington. This was followed by Port Chalmers in June 1867, Wanganui in October 1874, Lyttelton in December 1876 and Timaru in 1888. Attempts were made by some people in Auckland to establish time balls there from 1864 onwards, but these were not recognized by the authorities until a permanent time ball was mounted on the Ferry Building in August 1901.

* Port Chalmers
:Established by the Otago Provincial Council on top of Observation Point in Port Chalmers in June 1867 the time ball service initially operated at 1 pm on all days of the week except Sundays. The service was discontinued in October 1877, but following concerns raised by 11 shipmasters the service resumed in April 1882 as a weekly service. In 1910 the time keeping service was discontinued but the ball however continued to be used until 1931 as a warning device. It was removed in 1970 but a replacement was restored to service in 2020. 

* Lyttelton
:Established in December 1876 the Lyttelton Timeball Station in Lyttelton, New Zealand, was operational until it was damaged in the 2010 Canterbury earthquake. Further severe damage occurred in the February 2011 Christchurch earthquake, and a decision was made in March 2011 to dismantle the building, a danger to the public, but the tower collapsed during the major aftershock that hit the Lyttelton area on 13 June 2011. In November 2012, a large financial donation was made available to contribute towards rebuilding the tower, a project the community considered. On 25 May 2013, it was announced that the tower and ball would be restored, and that funds were to be sought from the community to rebuild the rest of the station. The station was officially reopened on 2 November 2018.

* Wellington
:The Wellington time ball service started in March 1864. It received its time information from the Dominion Observatory which was also communicated to the Lyttelton time ball service. Dunedin used local observatory facilities. 

:Wellington had two time ball sites – the time ball was erected at the first site by mid-January 1864 on top of the Custom House building on the Wellington waterfront and later relocated in 1888 to the J Shed Woolstore on top of the accumulator tower. This building and the time ball burnt down on 9 March 1909.

:Instead of replacing the Wellington time ball after the second site burnt down, time light signals were introduced at the Dominion Observatory. The earliest record of this was 22 February 1912. They were in use until 1937 when wireless signals took over as the new way to keep time.
===Poland===
* Gdańsk, Poland (The time ball was installed in 1876, moved to the Danzig (now Gdańsk) lighthouse in 1894, and removed in 1929. In 2008 it was reconstructed from original plans)

===South Africa===
* Victoria &amp; Alfred Waterfront, Cape Town

===Spain===
* The Real Instituto y Observatorio de la Armada in San Fernando, Cádiz continues to activate its time ball every day at 13:00 (ROA Time). After better timekeeping at sea made it obsolete, it was disabled, but it was reactivated in the late 20th century.
* The Royal House of the Post Office in Puerta del Sol, Madrid, operated a time ball for Madrid. Nowadays it is only used to mark the imminent start of the bell strikes that mark the New Year at midnight. The main Spanish TV networks broadcast the event, allowing spectators to eat the traditional Twelve Grapes.

===United Kingdom===
* Timeball Tower, Deal, Kent, England. Operates hourly and has recently been refurbished. 
* Margate Clock Tower, Kent, England
* Royal Observatory, Greenwich, England
* Time Ball Buildings, Leeds, England
* Guildhall, Kingston upon Hull, England. The only maritime timepiece on a municipal building. It dates back to 1918 and is the highest in the UK.
* Clock Tower, Brighton, East Sussex, England. (originally operated hourly, but was later stopped as it was too noisy)
* Nelson&#x27;s Monument on Calton Hill, Edinburgh, Scotland
* Flat Iron Building in Prescot, Merseyside. Added during restoration of the building, the timeball dates from the 1800s but is controlled by a newly-built mechanism.

===United States===
* United States Naval Observatory, Washington D.C.
* Titanic Memorial, New York City
* Plymouth Light, Gurnet Point, Plymouth, Massachusetts

<text>John William Ward (1922–1985), was the 14th President of Amherst College, a veteran of World War II, Professor of English and History at Princeton University, and Chairman of the Ward Commission.

==Early life and education==
Ward was born in Boston, Massachusetts, the son of John Joseph Ward, a physician, and Margaret Mary Carrigan. Ward attended Boston Latin school where he played football, captaining the team his senior season when it went undefeated. He entered Harvard College in 1941. However, he enlisted in the Marine Corps after the attack on Pearl Harbor. He served as a drill instructor at Paris Island (SC) and on the heavy cruiser USS &quot;Augusta&quot;. Demobilized in 1945, he returned to Harvard, changed his concentration from pre-med to history and literature, and graduated with honors in 1947-48, albeit as a member of the class of 1945 because of his wartime service. After a brief period in retail, he enrolled in the doctoral program in English and American Studies at the University of Minnesota, where his advisor was Henry Nash Smith. Leo Marx, another Smith student was also on the faculty, and he and Ward became life long friends and colleagues.

==Professor at Princeton and Amherst==
He went to become a professor of English and History at Princeton University from 1952 to 1964. At Princeton, he became Chair of the Special Program in American Civilization. He was also a teacher and mentor to Bill Bradley. He began his long association with Amherst College in 1964 when he accepted a Chair in History and American Studies. He was a professor from 1964 to 1971. It was during this time that Ward would publish &quot;Andrew Jackson: Symbol for an Age&quot; (1955), and &quot;Red, White, and Blue: Men, Books, and Ideas in American Culture&quot; 1969.

==President of Amherst College==
In 1971, Ward became the fourteenth President of Amherst College, a position he held until 1979. Perhaps more than anything, Ward&#x27;s presidency at Amherst was marked by the introduction of coeducation. The Trustees of the College reluctantly voted in favor of it in November 1974, the first female students were admitted in the fall of 1975, and the first women graduated in June 1976. Ward will also be remembered during his presidency for participating in a 1972 antiwar protest at Westover Air Force Base in Chicopee, Massachusetts, where he and 471 other protesters blocked traffic for more than thirty minutes. The protesters, including Ward, his wife Barbara, several Amherst faculty members and several hundred Amherst students, were arrested for disturbing the peace. Ward&#x27;s participation stirred both approval and outrage, as well as a large volume of media coverage and commentary, related to the appropriateness of a college president&#x27;s involvement in individual acts of civil disobedience. Ward resigned after eight years of the presidency to head the Ward Commission.

==American studies==
Best known as a central figure of the Myth and Symbol School of American studies scholarship, Ward was one of the few university presidents during the Vietnam era to participate in direct activism against the escalation of conflict in Southeast Asia, and was the only university president to be arrested for doing so. His decision to protest the war was informed by his basic view of history and the role of American mythologies in American life, including and most importantly the mythology of absolute freedom and equality implied by Jeffersonian democracy. For Ward, history was made when individuals put their ideals into action, and for this reason Ward spent much of his career exploring contradictions in ideology, especially emphasizing the contradiction between the individual&#x27;s freedom to act in socially responsible manner and the increasing bureaucratization of life that limited the possibility of such action. His most well known book, &quot;Andrew Jackson: Symbol for An Age&quot; treats Andrew Jackson as a symbol embodying 19th century ideology. Other figures who Ward treated as symbolic of contradictions in America&#x27;s myths about itself include John F. Kennedy, Henry David Thoreau, Charles Lindbergh, and the Anarchist activist Alexander Berkman.

Like many academics in the humanities during the Cold War, Ward refrained from direct opposition to American foreign policy for most of his career, although his work, much of which is included in his career retrospective &quot;Red, White, and Blue: Men, Books, and Ideas in American Culture&quot;, implies a dialectical approach to understanding culture that would influence the New Left and other expressly radical critics. As with many writers in the myth and symbol school, such as Leo Marx, who have been misunderstood by recent cultural critics writing in what has become known as the &quot;cold war consensus&quot; view of American academic history, Ward was attempting through the course of his career to forward a complex criticism of American culture rather than a mere celebration of American hegemony. For Ward, such criticism led inevitably to direct activism. The failure of the New Left to credit their own academic theories to the sometimes radical critiques underlying the myth and symbol criticism in which they were initiated as students has been referred to by recent writers as &quot;New Left amnesia&quot;..

==Ward Commission==
After resigning as Amherst College President in 1979, Ward worked for two years as Chairman of the Commission Concerning State and County Buildings in Massachusetts. Called the Ward Commission, it investigated corruption in public housing projects and other government projects. Ward was credited with a strong sense of ethics as he led the more than two and a half year study. The final document is over 2,000 pages in length and was released on December 31, 1981. A major outcome of the study was the creation of the Office of the Inspector General. This office has come into prominence in the monitoring of state agencies and government. It was the first such state agency in the country. Ward was acknowledged for his leadership.

In July 1982 Ward moved into the presidency of the American Council of Learned Societies, an umbrella organization over many academic societies devoted to the advancement of humanistic studies.

In 1985, he received an honorary doctorate from the University of Minnesota.

== Family life and death ==
Ward married Barbara Carnes in 1949, and they had three sons. Little has been published about their family life. His eldest son, David C. Ward served as Senior Historian of the National Portrait Gallery. He is also a published author and poet.

== Legacy ==
His son, Christopher O. Ward, was appointed Executive Director of the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey in 2008. He was appointed by New York&#x27;s first African American Governor, David Paterson. Paterson is the son of Basil Paterson member of the Gang of Four (Harlem). Chris Ward also served as Mayor Michael Bloomberg&#x27;s first DEP Commissioner from 2002 to 2005.

<doc id="816894" wikidata="Q3261410" url="?curid=816894" title="Louis Campau">
<text>Louis Campau (August 11, 1791 – April 13, 1871), also spelled Louis Campeau, was an important figure in the early settlement of Saginaw and Grand Rapids - two important Michigan cities in which he had established trading posts. Campau was also involved in negotiations between the local Native Americans and the federal government, including the Treaty of Detroit signed in 1855 by the local chief, Cobmoosa.

==Early years and personal life==

Campau was born in 1791 in Detroit, which at the time was functionally part of the Province of Quebec. He was a member of the prominent Campau family who were of French heritage. He began working the fur trade as a boy for his father, Louis Campau, Sr., and his uncle, Joseph Campau. During the War of 1812, he served under the United States Army.

His wife was Sophie Marsac, also born in Detroit. Sophie was the daughter of René Marsac, an early and notable family from New France. The Sophie de Marsac Campau Grand Rapids Chapter of the Daughters of the American Revolution was created in her memory and in so doing &quot;perpetuated the name of a woman of rare grace and character who was held in high esteem by the early pioneers.&quot;

==Saginaw==

He established the first trading post at what is today Saginaw, Michigan, as early as 1815. He played a key role in negotiating the Treaty of Saginaw in 1819. This Treaty was made between Gen. Lewis Cass and Native American tribes of the Great Lakes region (principally the Ojibwe, but also the Odawa (Ottawa) and Potawatomi) of Michigan. Native Americans ceded more than six million acres (24,000 km2) in the central portion of the Lower Peninsula of Michigan.

==Grand Rapids==

Shortly after, Isaac McCoy, a Baptist minister, established a mission station in what was to become Grand Rapids, Campau arrived in the area at the suggestion of William Brewster, a fur trader with American Fur Company, who was his competitor. Campau became known as the official founder of Grand Rapids.

In 1826, Campau built his cabin, trading post, and blacksmith shop on the east bank of the Grand River near the rapids, where he found that the area Native Americans were &quot;friendly and peaceable&quot;. Campau traveled to Detroit and returned a year later with his wife and $5,000 of trade goods to trade with the Odawa and Ojibwa for fur. Campau&#x27;s younger brother Touissant would often assist him with his enterprise.
In 1831, a federal survey was performed of the Northwest Territory and land was offered for sale. Campau bought 72 acres around his trading post and near the Baptist mission for $90 on September 19 of that year. Living at the post were his wife and several members of his family. Some of his brothers and nephews followed him to Grand Rapids. One year later, government surveyor Lucius Lyon purchased land north of Campau&#x27;s property. Campau surveyed and platted the village following Native American trails. Lyon had platted his property in an English grid format, which meant that there were two adjoining villages, with different platting formats. Campau had formatted his village streets with a row of 16 abutting row houses on Pearl Street that bordered Lyon&#x27;s village, which made travel through the two villages cumbersome. Travelers had to go north to Division Street to cross into Campau&#x27;s village.

Campau, who was described as short-tempered, and Lyon also disagreed about the naming of the town when it was platted. Lyon wanted to call it the village of Kent rather than Grand Rapids. Lyon and land speculators from New York had formed the Kent Company, which was named for judge James Kent in New York, and were interested in land development along the Grand River.

Although Lyon was able to obtain land near the river and created Canal Street to meet up with Campau&#x27;s Monroe Avenue, eventually the Kent Company was “forced out of existence”. The two villages were merged by Campau under the name of Grand Rapids. It was officially incorporated in 1838 and became a city in 1850.
In October 1883, he was the first settler in Kent County, Michigan to buy land from the White Pigeon land office, which was located on the Chicago Road (known earlier as the Sauk Trail) that linked Chicago and Detroit.

==Indian treaties==
Both Louis and his brother Antoine were involved in treaty negotiations that made them a lot of money. Louis was involved in the Treaty of Denver in 1855, and he received a sizeable payout for the negotiations. The Treaty of Detroit with the federal government meant that one of the signers, Cobmoosa, would relocate with his tribe from the Grand Rapids area to Oceana County, Michigan. The treaty was signed by 54 other leaders of Odawa and Chippewa tribes in Detroit. In exchange for their ancestral lands, roughly $540,000 in cash and goods were split among all of the represented tribes. Much of it went to &quot;white friends&quot;, like Campau; $500 went to the chiefs and $100 to headmen. It was to be paid out over 10 years.

<doc id="816897" wikidata="Q7303777" url="?curid=816897" title="Red Book (Liberal Party of Canada)">
<text>The Red Book, officially titled Creating Opportunity: The Liberal Plan for Canada, was the platform of the Liberal Party of Canada in the 1993 federal election. It earned its name from its bright red cover, red being the official colour of the Liberal Party. It was a 112-page booklet; many thousands of copies of it were printed, and it was widely distributed.

==Purpose==
It was exceptional in how specific it was; while platforms before and since have contained few substantive promises and many vague statements of principle, the Red Book laid out a long list of changes that the Liberals would make if brought to power.

It was also rare in Canada to have an entire platform released at once. Generally, a party would release a policy idea, wait for it to gather as much media attention as possible, and then release another. Those ideas had also been released during speeches by the party leader, not printed in unbending prose.

Perhaps most central was that the Liberal Red Book gave costs for each of their promises and summed them. Never before had a party attempted to clearly prove that its promises were fiscally responsible and practical. Paul Martin, the man who led the team that produced the Red Book was less complimentary about the book in private, as during his time in office as Finance Minister, he was often reported to have said: &quot;Don&#x27;t tell me about the Red Book, I wrote the damn thing, and I know that it is a lot of crap!&quot;

It was one of the first &quot;contract with the public&quot; type platforms, an idea used by the United States Republican Party in its 1994 Contract with America and Mike Harris&#x27; 1995 Common Sense Revolution in Ontario.

==1993 election==
The Liberals, out of power since 1984, were widely expected to win the 1993 election based on the great pan-Canadian dislike for the Progressive Conservative government of Brian Mulroney. The Liberals under Jean Chrétien were worried by a jump in Tory support with the selection of new leader Kim Campbell.

A larger concern was the general Canadian antipathy towards politicians after the tumultuous and scandal plagued Mulroney years. The 1992 referendum on the Charlottetown Accord was widely interpreted of a rejection of Canada&#x27;s political elite by the general population.

To attempt to break through the cynicism and distrust the Liberals felt that being more specific and making many promises would help ensure a victory, thus the Red Book was created.

The Red Book was drafted mainly by Paul Martin, who finished as runner-up in the 1990 Liberal leadership convention to Chrétien, and Chaviva Hošek a top policy official with the Liberals. By giving Martin a prominent role in the campaign, this was seen as Chrétien&#x27;s attempt to unify the Liberal Party.

===Impact===
The Liberals rolled out the Red Book on September 19, not long after the September 8 election call. Several days later, the Progressive Conservatives released the hastily assembled &quot;A Taxpayer&#x27;s Agenda&quot;, but the Liberals had captured the reputation of being the party with ideas since they had essentially released their entire platform. Thanks to the Red Book as well as a gradual decline in support for the governing Conservatives (unpopularity, vote splitting with Reform and Bloc), the Liberals won a strong majority government with 177 seats—the third-best result in the party&#x27;s history, and their best performance since their record 190 seats in the 1949 election. The Conservatives were nearly eliminated from the political scene, falling to two seats in the worst defeat ever suffered for a governing party at the federal level.

==Broken promises==
The specificity of the Red Book came back to haunt the Liberals, however, and much of the next few years were spent defending broken promises. The most notable of these was the Goods and Services Tax, which the Liberals had promised to replace but only did so in the Atlantic provinces.

In Chrétien&#x27;s view, the majority of the promises were kept. He famously argued that 78% were honoured, a mark he could live with. Others contest whether some of these promises were kept or not. Some of the most notable promises from the Red Book that were kept were the pledge to cancel the purchase of new naval helicopters, canceling the sale of Toronto Pearson International Airport, reforming unemployment insurance, legislating more gun control, and reducing the size of the armed forces with the end of the Cold War. Perhaps the most important pledge kept was that of returning Canada to fiscal solvency.

New Liberal Red Books were published for the 1997 and 2000 elections. These contained far fewer specifics and more generalities.

<text>The University of Chester is a public university located in Chester, England. The university originated as the first purpose-built teacher training college in the UK. As a university, it now occupies five campus sites in and around Chester, one in Warrington, and a University Centre in Shrewsbury. It offers a range of foundation, undergraduate and postgraduate courses, as well as undertaking academic research.

The university is a member of AACSB, the Association of Commonwealth Universities, the Cathedrals Group, the North West Universities Association and Universities UK. It holds an overall Silver Award in the 2023 Teaching Excellence Framework (TEF).

A 2021 article in &quot;Times Higher Education&quot; described the University of Chester as being the fifth-oldest higher education establishment in England, with only the universities of Oxford, Cambridge, Durham and London predating it.

== History ==

=== 1839 to 2000 ===

The university was founded as Chester Diocesan Training College in 1839 by a distinguished group of local leading figures in the Church of England, including future Prime Ministers William Ewart Gladstone and the 14th Earl of Derby. It was the UK&#x27;s first purpose-built teacher training college, which makes it one of the longest established higher education institutions in the country. In 1842, Gladstone opened the college&#x27;s original buildings for its first intake of ten male student teachers on the Parkgate Road site, (just outside the City Walls), that the university occupies today.

In 1921, Chester formally became an affiliated college of the University of Liverpool, which meant that the University of Liverpool awarded Chester&#x27;s qualifications and Chester&#x27;s students were able to use Liverpool&#x27;s facilities.

The institution was threatened with closure in the 1930s, but its future was secured by the Bishop of Chester in 1933. From then on, the college continued to grow steadily. By the 1960s, as the UK was massively expanding its higher education capacity in reaction to the Robbins Report, the college was considered as a possible candidate for university status. These proposals, however, were not followed through.

The college continued to expand and women were first admitted in 1961. In 1963, the government renamed teacher training colleges to colleges of education, so Chester&#x27;s name became Chester College of Education. In 1974, the number of courses was expanded beyond teacher education to include Bachelor of Arts and Bachelor of Science degrees. To reflect its wider remit, the college was renamed Chester College of Higher Education.

In the early 1990s the School of Nursing and Midwifery (now the Faculty of Health and Social Care) was established. The college also began to offer a Bachelor of Theology degree, HNDs and more postgraduate courses, such as master&#x27;s degrees and PhDs. It also embarked on a £10 million campus improvement programme. By 1996, Chester had earned the right to call itself University College Chester. This name, however, was short-lived as the government changed the requirements for university colleges in 1999 to include only those that had their own degree-awarding powers. Thus, Chester had to drop the &#x27;University College&#x27; tag and reverted to the title Chester College of Higher Education, though the more descriptive Chester, a College of the University of Liverpool was frequently used in publicity material.

=== 2000 to present ===

The college expanded in 2002 through the acquisition of the higher education faculty and campus of Warrington Collegiate Institute. (The further and adult education campuses of Warrington remained independent and was known as Warrington Collegiate, until in August 2017, when it merged with Mid Cheshire College.))

In 2003 Chester was granted its own degree-awarding powers, allowing it to be known as University College Chester once again. Due to its long (and well-advertised) association with the University of Liverpool, Chester continued to award Liverpool degrees until the 2005 intake of students.

In 2005, University College Chester was awarded full university status and became the University of Chester. This was followed by the right to award its own research degrees in 2007, ending Chester&#x27;s last validation arrangement with Liverpool.

Following the 2008 Research Assessment Exercise, some of the university&#x27;s research was declared to be of international quality, with a proportion of &#x27;World Leading&#x27; research in History (15% of submitted research), English, Sports Studies, and Drama (each 5% of submitted research).

In 2010, the Centre for Work Related Studies (CWRS) received a commendation by the UK quality body, for its radically flexible and high quality negotiated work based learning framework - enabling professionals to customise their own qualifications, &#x27;learn through work&#x27;, and enable rapid accreditation of commercial training provision. At the same time, the funding body showcased CWRS&#x27;s flexible approach to accrediting workplace learning.

=== Expansion ===

The university has expanded in recent years, buying buildings in Chester and constructing student accommodation at Parkgate Road Campus in 2013. 

In 2013 the university took over the Shell Technology Centre at Thornton-le-Moors from Shell UK, former owners of the adjacent Stanlow Oil Refinery. The Thornton Science Park, as it was renamed, was opened in 2014 by George Osborne, then the Chancellor of the Exchequer. The Science Park was used for a variety of science and engineering-based courses. However, following guidance from the Health and Safety Executive, in 2018 the local authority Cheshire West and Chester Council refused a retrospective planning application for continued use for educational purposes on safety grounds, due to the proximity to the refinery.

In 2014, Loyd Grossman, who holds an honorary degree from the university, officially opened the North West Food Research Development (NoWFOOD) Centre.

== Campuses ==
The University of Chester has six campuses and a University Centre in Shrewsbury. The Parkgate Road Campus, Chester, is located on Parkgate Road, just north of the City Walls. It has a mixture of Victorian buildings (such as Old College, which includes a chapel built by some of the original students in the 1840s) and modern buildings (such as the Students&#x27; Union). The Parkgate Road Campus also features a fitness centre, sports hall, swimming pool, science and language laboratories and bar.
Some departments are housed offsite at locations within walking distance of the main campus, for example, the Department of English is located in a Grade II-listed former Victorian vicarage, while the Law School is based at 67 Liverpool Road. The former County Hall, which is located in the city centre near the racecourse, houses the Faculty of Education and Children&#x27;s Services and the Faculty of Health and Social Care and is known as the Riverside Campus.
The university has also developed the Kingsway Campus in Newton with the addition of a three-storey teaching block, ground floor exhibition space and art gallery, learning resource centre and changing rooms. The site features a number of green innovations, such as ground source heating.

The university acquired a former Lloyds Bank corporate headquarters in Queen&#x27;s Park, Handbridge, Chester in 2015. This houses the Faculty of Business and Management and the Chester Business School. The university has modernised the facilities in Bridge House and Churchill House to cater for 2,700 students.

In the autumn of 2015, the university opened a sister institution in the Guildhall and Rowley&#x27;s House, Shrewsbury, Shropshire as part of a joint venture with Shropshire Council to establish University Centre Shrewsbury.

The university-owned student accommodation is primarily reserved for first year and overseas students. This consists of halls of residence and houses nearby.

The smaller Warrington campus originally hosted a camp for Canadian officers in World War II and is located in the Padgate area of Warrington. This campus includes the North West Media Centre, which has close ties to Granada Television, The Warrington School of Management, Social Sciences and Health and Social Care. The Warrington Campus is also the training ground for the rugby league team The Warrington Wolves, and Warrington town was the host for the Rugby League World Cup 2013, with the Campus hosting the Samoan players. In 2022 two new buildings, Time Square and Remond House, were opened in Warrington Town Centre.

The university also has a number of bases at NHS sites across Cheshire and the Wirral, and opened University Centre Birkenhead in September 2018.

=== Coat of arms ===

The university&#x27;s coat of arms was granted by the College of Arms in 1954. The arms, pictured above, are made up of an argent shield featuring the St George&#x27;s cross on which there is a golden wheatsheaf, representing the Earldom of Cheshire. In the first quarter of the shield is a clasped open book, symbolising learning. The crest features a mitre, signifying the institution&#x27;s founding by the Church of England, in front of two crossed swords, which are taken from the County of Cheshire&#x27;s coat of arms. The golden scroll contains the Latin motto, &quot;qui docet in doctrina&quot;, an extract from Saint Paul&#x27;s epistle to the Romans and translates as &quot;he that teacheth, on teaching&quot; or &quot;let the teacher teach&quot;.

The coat of arms was used as the college&#x27;s logo until the early 1990s when a new logo, with a depiction of the Old College building, was introduced. The coat of arms returned to the college&#x27;s logo in 2002 when a simplified version became part of the logo. The university&#x27;s current logo, introduced in 2005, features the shield and scroll from the coat of arms.

From 2015, as part of the 175th-anniversary celebrations, the university&#x27;s coat of arms was changed to include supporting griffins on either side – one in gold, and one in black reach referencing one of the institution&#x27;s founders. The gold griffin of Edward Smith-Stanley, 14th Earl of Derby bears the University Mace. The Black griffin of William Gladstone bears a sword. Each gorged with a collar of university colours red and white.

== Academic profile ==

There are approximately 1,737 administrative and academic members of staff. Many take part in research and often publish their work through the institution&#x27;s own publishing house, the University of Chester Press. The 2014 Research Assessment Exercise resulted in Chester&#x27;s research being declared world-leading in 14 areas of that submitted.

Former Archbishop of Canterbury Rowan Williams was, in 2011, bestowed a visiting professorship with the title Gladstone Professor of Literature and Theology. His inaugural lecture &#x27;The Messiah and the novelist: approaches to Jesus in fiction&#x27; took place in Chester Cathedral.

Peter Blair and Ashley Chantler edit &quot;Flash: The International Short-Short Story Magazine&quot;, a major literary periodical, which publishes stories and reviews of up to 360 words by writers from around the world.

At the beginning of April 2021, the university announced its intention to make up to 86 compulsory redundancies across staff in the Humanities department. The University and College Union has strongly condemned these plans, and student protests in opposition to the measures have taken place throughout the city.

=== Reputation and rankings ===
The Quality Assurance Agency for Higher Education (QAA) 2010 audit praised the university for its good practice in ensuring standards and enhancing the quality of learning opportunities, the supportive relationships that underpin the learning and working in the institution and the strength of its partnership work.

The Faculty of Education and Children&#x27;s Services also celebrated an &#x27;outstanding&#x27; outcome in its recent Ofsted inspection of Initial Teacher Training.

== Student life ==
Chester Students&#x27; Union (CSU) offers services and provides facilities for students and is a member of the NUS. Four sabbatical officers are elected each year and serve a maximum of two years.

The executive committee are the trustees of the Union. Members are elected each year before the end of March, with a president and vice-president, and each with a different role, such as Education representative, Activities representative and a Warrington representative. The support staff for the Union consists of a number of full-time employees, part-time student staff and volunteers from the elected Executive Committee and the Union Council.

The Union runs a bar &#x27;CH1&#x27; on the main Parkgate Road Campus, Chester. The previously known &#x27;Padgate Union Bar&#x27; on the Warrington campus was, in August 2010, taken over by the university, and is now known as &#x27;Bar and Club 2010&#x27;. The Union also has three shops. Two are on the Parkgate Road Campus, Chester, consisting of a general shop and a Starbucks Coffee franchise, and one at Warrington.

The Union also runs over 110 sports clubs and societies; with each campus having its own teams, many of which compete in British Universities and Colleges Sport competitions. Once a year, the Union runs an inter-campus competition known as &quot;Varsity&quot; on campus where sporting societies, such as seven-a-side football, and non-sporting societies, such as poker, compete. Non-sporting societies include the Debating Society (which has hosted hustings events which have featured on &#x27;BBC North West Tonight&#x27;), the Politics Forum, the Drama Society, the Amnesty International Society, the International Development Society and the People and Planet Society. A student radio station, &quot;The Cat Radio&quot;, is based on the Warrington campus and broadcasts daily, with presenters on air from September until July.

==Student body==

Most of Chester&#x27;s 14,900 students are from the United Kingdom. A quarter of students are mature and there are twice as many female students as male (partially due to the number of nursing, midwifery and teaching students). The increasing number of foreign students are mainly participants in the university&#x27;s active exchange policy.

<doc id="816923" wikidata="Q639360" url="?curid=816923" title="Karl Edward Wagner">
<text>Karl Edward Wagner (12 December 1945 – 14 October 1994) was an American writer, poet, editor, and publisher of horror, science fiction, and heroic fantasy, who was born in Knoxville, Tennessee and originally trained as a psychiatrist. He wrote numerous dark fantasy and horror stories. As an editor, he created a three-volume set of Robert E. Howard&#x27;s Conan the Barbarian fiction restored to its original form as written, and edited the long-running and genre-defining &quot;The Year&#x27;s Best Horror Stories&quot; series for DAW Books. His Carcosa publishing company issued four volumes of the best stories by some of the major authors of the so-called Golden Age pulp magazines. He is possibly best known for his creation of a series of stories featuring the character Kane, the Mystic Swordsman.

Although he held a degree in psychiatry, he became disillusioned with the medical profession, a disenchantment evident in the stories &quot;The Fourth Seal&quot; and &quot;Into Whose Hands&quot;. He described his personal philosophy as nihilistic, anarchistic and absurdist, and claimed, not entirely seriously, to be related to &quot;an opera composer named &quot;Richard&quot;. Wagner also admired the cinema of Sam Peckinpah, stating &quot;I worship the film &quot;The Wild Bunch&quot;&quot;.

==Biography==
Wagner was the fourth and youngest child of Aubrey J. Wagner and Dorothea Huber. His father was an official of the Tennessee Valley Authority. Wagner earned a history degree from Kenyon College in 1967, and a psychiatry M.D. from University of North Carolina School of Medicine. Wagner completed his residency and practiced for several years, and also studied toward a Ph.D in neurobiology. As noted above, Wagner ultimately disliked the medical profession, which he abandoned upon establishing himself as a writer.

Wagner was productive as both a writer and editor/anthologist; see below. His friends included the writer Manly Wade Wellman, two of whose collections he published with the Carcosa publishing imprint.

Wagner died in his home in Chapel Hill, North Carolina, on October 14, 1994, essentially due to the consequences of longterm alcoholism. It was reported in a late 1994 issue of the Newsletter of the Horror Writers of America that Wagner&#x27;s causes of death were heart failure and liver failure.

&quot;Exorcisms and Ecstasies&quot;, a posthumous volume of uncollected stories, miscellany, and tributes was published by small press publisher Fedogan &amp; Bremer in 1997. Night Shade Books has published the complete Kane stories (novels and shorts) in two hardcover volumes.

In 2020, a documentary on Wagner, &quot;The Last Wolf&quot; was released on Vimeo.

==Published works==
Some of Wagner&#x27;s work is set in Robert E. Howard&#x27;s universe (featuring Conan the Barbarian and Bran Mak Morn); he also edited three volumes of Howard&#x27;s original Conan tales, important to purists for being the first to restore the texts to their originally published forms. His three volumes of &quot;Echoes of Valor&quot; also featured restored versions of pulp-era fantasy stories by authors such as Fritz Leiber, C. L. Moore, Henry Kuttner, and Nictzin Dyalhis. Wagner wrote an unpublished Bran Mak Morn novel, &quot;Queen of the Night&quot;, which was originally scheduled to be published by Zebra books during 1978 and Ace Books during 1980. [Refer to David Drake&#x27;s Newsletter #105 in which he states &#x27;Queen of the Night&#x27; was never written.]

===Kane, the Mystic Swordsman===
Wagner created his own mystical and immortal pre-historical anti-hero, Kane, whose name and background are based on traditional conceptions of the biblical Cain. A powerful, left-handed warrior-sorcerer with red hair and blue eyes, the character was described by Wagner as one &quot;who could master any situation intellectually, or rip heads off if push came to shove&quot;. Kane is an immortal, somewhat like the Wandering Jew (or more specifically, Charles Maturin&#x27;s &quot;Melmoth the Wanderer&quot;, a novel which Wagner cites as a major influence in his essay &quot;The Once and Future Kane&quot;). Kane&#x27;s character also includes elements of Robert E. Howard&#x27;s Solomon Kane. He is an immortal, cursed to wander the Earth until he is destroyed by the violence that he himself has created. He sells his loyalty as a fighter to the highest bidder. He is a well-read and intelligent man who has traveled the world for centuries and is able to discuss music, poetry, politics, and many other subjects. He is also amoral and a born killer. The Kane stories are often classified as tales of sword and sorcery (although Wagner disliked the term), which some critics have compared favorably to those of Robert E. Howard and Michael Moorcock. In his story &quot;The Gothic Touch&quot;, Kane actually encounters Moorcock&#x27;s albino anti-hero Elric. The character Kane is considered one of the most memorable and original anti-heroes of heroic fantasy.

Inspired by the sword and sorcery adventures of Fritz Leiber&#x27;s Fafhrd and the Gray Mouser, and Robert E. Howard&#x27;s mighty-thewed barbarian Conan the Cimmerian, Wagner set about creating his own fantasy character while still attending medical school. The result was initially published as a 1970 paperback original with a lurid cover by West Coast pornography publisher Powell Publications. The novel&#x27;s text was altered by an unknown copy editor to conform with the cover art.

After publishing a pseudonymous pornographic novel with a small New York company, Wagner relinquished his chance to become a doctor and instead decided to write full-time. During 1973, Warner Paperback library published &quot;Death Angel&#x27;s Shadow&quot;, which collected the three original Kane tales (one novella, one novelette, and one short story). He also began selling his stories and poems regularly to the growing small press magazine market. Several of his tales were published in Gary Hoppenstand&#x27;s &quot;Midnight Sunn&quot;, a magazine initially devoted to Kane and the new school of epic fantasy writers. This was followed by publication of the first Kane novel, &quot;Bloodstone&quot;, during 1975. Warner Books commissioned a cover painting by Frank Frazetta (who had helped revive the Conan franchise, and who would paint a number of future covers for the series) and Wagner&#x27;s writing career improved.

After a novel featuring Howard&#x27;s Pictish hero Bran Mak Morn, Wagner&#x27;s next Kane book was &quot;Dark Crusade&quot; (1976). A Kane story published elsewhere, &quot;Two Suns Setting&quot;, won the 1977 British Fantasy Award and was also a World Fantasy Award nominee. Wagner published other Kane stories in magazines such as &quot;Chacal&quot;, &quot;Whispers&quot; and &quot;Escape!&quot; during 1977. Gerald W. Page, then editor of DAW Books &quot;Year&#x27;s Best Fantasy and Horror Stories&quot;, began to reprint Kane tales in the anthology series &quot;Night Winds&quot;; a collection of six previously published Kane tales followed (Warner Books, 1978). The publisher also reissued all previous Kane books including a new edition of &quot;Darkness Weaves&quot;, which reinstated the author&#x27;s preferred text.

&quot;The Book of Kane&quot; was the last published volume of Kane material (1985) until Night Shade Books&#x27; omnibus editions of novels and shorter tales.

A proposed fourth Kane novel, &quot;In the Wake of the Night&quot;, was never completed, although an excerpt was published as part of a World Fantasy Convention souvenir book of 1981; this also appears in the collection &quot;Midnight Sun&quot; (2003).

In 2004, it was reported that movie producer Lauren Moews had &quot;acquired &quot;Death Angel&#x27;s Shadow&quot;, and will produce a film based upon &quot;Reflections for the Winter of My Soul,&quot; the first of three short stories comprising &quot;Death Angel&#x27;s Shadow&quot;. The other two short stories, &quot;Cold Light&quot; and &quot;Mirage,&quot; are waiting in the wings to be developed into a possible KANE franchise for Tonic Films&quot;. Lauren Moews&#x27; Tonic Films Acquires Rights to Karl Edward Wagner&#x27;s Tome Death Angel&#x27;s Shadow As of 2020 the film had not entered production.

===Other writings===

Besides the Kane books, Wagner wrote contemporary horror stories (some of which, like &quot;At First Just Ghostly&quot;, also feature Kane). These were collected in the books &quot;In a Lonely Place&quot; (1983), &quot;Why Not You and I?&quot; (1987) and the posthumous &quot;Exorcisms and Ecstasies&quot; (1997). They range from the very literate and allusive (such as &quot;The River of Night&#x27;s Dreaming&quot;, which refers to Richard O&#x27;Brien&#x27;s &quot;The Rocky Horror Show&quot; and the myth of Carcosa used in the work of Ambrose Bierce and Robert W. Chambers), to the pulpy and parodic (such as &quot;Plan Ten from Inner Space&quot;, a crazed homage to Ed Wood&#x27;s &quot;magnum opus&quot; &quot;Plan 9 from Outer Space&quot;). His later stories, such as &quot;But You&#x27;ll Never Follow Me&quot; and &quot;Silted In&quot;, were described by Ramsey Campbell as tormented and deeply personal; some deal explicitly with drug addiction (e.g. &quot;More Sinned Against&quot;) and sexual subjects, including psychological repression (e.g. &quot;Brushed Away&quot;) and transsexualism (e.g. &quot;Lacunae&quot;).

During 1983 Wagner won the World Fantasy Award for his horror novella &quot;Beyond Any Measure&quot; and the British Fantasy Award during 1984 for &quot;Neither Brute Nor Human&quot;.

With his friends Jim Groce and David Drake, who were concerned that Arkham House would cease publication after the death of its founder, August Derleth, Wagner formed the Carcosa publishing house in North Carolina during 1973 to preserve the work of their favorite pulp magazine horror writers in hardcovers. Carcosa Press published four substantial volumes of horror tales: &quot;Murgunstrumm and Others&quot; by Hugh B. Cave, &quot;Far Lands, Other Days&quot; by E. Hoffmann Price, &quot;Worse Things Waiting&quot; and &quot;Lonely Vigils&quot;, both by Manly Wade Wellman. All books were edited by Wagner and illustrated profusely. A fifth collection was planned, &quot;Death Stalks the Night&quot;, by Hugh B. Cave; Lee Brown Coye was working on illustrating it when he died, causing Carcosa to abandon the project. The book was eventually published by Fedogan &amp; Bremer. Wagner later acted as the literary agent for Manly Wade Wellman&#x27;s estate.

Wagner collaborated with Drake on &quot;Killer&quot;, a science fiction horror novel set during the reign of the Roman emperor Domitian.

The illustrator of &quot;Murgunstrumm&quot; and &quot;Worse Things Waiting&quot; was the noted &quot;Weird Tales&quot; artist Lee Brown Coye. Coye&#x27;s macabre designs, incorporating mysterious lattices of twigs, were the inspiration for Wagner&#x27;s British Fantasy Award-winning story &quot;Sticks&quot;. The story was later included in a revised edition of Tales of the Cthulhu Mythos.
A connoisseur of rare horror stories, Wagner perspicaciously edited many horror and fantasy anthologies; perhaps his greatest achievement of this topic was the annual anthology series &quot;The Year&#x27;s Best Horror Stories&quot; (DAW Books), which he edited for fourteen years from volume VIII (1980) until volume XXII (1994). The series was canceled after Wagner&#x27;s death. However, while the original editions were paperback originals, Underwood-Miller preserved the series in a set of three limited-edition hardcovers.

Wagner was a frequent visitor to London to attend fantasy and horror conventions. Though he continued to edit, producing three volumes of the heroic fantasy anthology &quot;Echoes of Valor&quot; for Tor Books during the late 1980s and early 1990s, and published a steady sequence of short stories (most of which were apparently written some years earlier), his most productive time was finished. In the story &quot;The Gothic Touch&quot;, Kane teams up with the albino warrior-sorcerer Elric in a tribute anthology honoring the fiction of Michael Moorcock (&quot;Tales of the White Wolf&quot;).

Wagner wrote several unproduced screenplays and treatments including a film script for &quot;Conan III&quot; for movie producer Dino De Laurentiis and a TV script based on Robert E. Howard&#x27;s &quot;The Horror on the Mound&quot; (for &quot;Tales from the Darkside&quot;).

Wagner provided the foreword to &quot;Fat Face&quot;, a Cthulhu Mythos tale by Michael Shea published as a standalone book by Axolotl Press, 1987.

===Audio, television and comics adaptations===

====Television====
&quot;The River of Night&#x27;s Dreaming&quot; was adapted for the TV series &quot;The Hunger&quot; during 1998.

&quot;Sticks&quot; provided the inspiration for the lattice type structures used in the television series True Detective.

====Graphic novels====

Wagner was involved with several comics ventures. His Kane story &quot;In the Lair of Yslsl&quot; (which was later incorporated into the Kane novel &quot;Dark Crusade&quot;) was adapted by Bill Whitcomb and Steve Vance, and illustrated by Vance, Wes Smith, and Bill Black for the graphic medium in &quot;Dark Phantasms&quot; 1, Summer 1976. During 1993 Wagner co-wrote the graphic novel &quot;Tell Me Dark&quot; with John Ney Reiber and Kent Williams, contributing original characters and situations. It was published by DC Comics in both hardcover and trade paperback.

At the time of his death, he had just finished compiling &quot;Exorcisms and Ecstasies&quot;, and had started working on two novels, &quot;The Fourth Seal&quot; and &quot;Tell Me, Dark&quot;, the latter based on the graphic novel he disowned.

<text>The Southeastern United States, also known as the American Southeast or simply the Southeast, is a geographical region of the United States located in the eastern portion of the Southern United States and the southern portion of the Eastern United States. The region includes a core of states that reaches north to Maryland and West Virginia, bordering the Ohio River and Mason–Dixon line, and stretches west to Arkansas and Louisiana. 

There is no official U.S. government definition for the region, and it is defined variably among agencies and organizations.

==History==

The history of the present-day Southeastern United States dates to the dawn of civilization in approximately 11,000 BC or 13,000 BC. The earliest artifacts from the region were from the Clovis culture. Prior to the arrival of European colonialists, Native Americans occupied the region for several hundred years during the Woodland period.

The first Europeans to arrive in the region were conquistadors associated with the Spanish Empire. In 1541, Hernando de Soto journeyed through the southeast and crossed the Mississippi River. The region hosted the first permanent European settlement in North America, with the Kingdom of England establishing Jamestown, Virginia in 1607. Four southeast states, Georgia, North Carolina, South Carolina, and Virginia, were among the Thirteen Colonies who sent delegates to the Second Continental Congress in Philadelphia, which declared independence from the British Crown, which was established with the colonies&#x27; victory over the British in the American Revolutionary War.

During the American Civil War, the Confederate States of America consisted of the southeastern states of Florida, Alabama, Georgia, Mississippi, Tennessee, South Carolina, North Carolina, Virginia, Louisiana, and Arkansas. Texas was a Confederate State that isn&#x27;t defined as part of the southeast region. Missouri and Kentucky had dual competing Unionist and Confederate state governments in the Confederate government of Missouri and Confederate government of Kentucky, while Maryland and Delaware were neutral southern border states that remained with the Union. West Virginia split from Virginia during 1863, and also served as a border state that remained with the Union while being contested by the Confederacy and Confederate government of West Virginia. Following the Reconstruction era in the 1870s, many Southeast state legislatures passed Jim Crow laws. The American segregation era spanned from the late 19th century to the mid-1960s.

In the mid-to-late 20th century, the Southeast saw many shifting changes take place population wise and economically. The Southeast started to see a spur of new economic growth in the 1930s, which stemmed from New Deal policies such as the Tennessee Valley Authority and the Fair Labor Standards Act instituting a minimum wage for the entire nation. World War II further helped growth within the Southeast, as military bases and military production drew workers from farming or low-wage industries into a new economy. With farming mechanization picking up to speed in the 1940s, promotion of different industries, and federal spending on defense and space programs, the Southeast saw further economic transformation in the ensuing years and decades of the 20th century.

The Southeast benefitted from its business and warm climate in its population growth during the late 20th century, as it helped in attracting job seekers and retirees from other U.S. regions. Florida in particular went from being the 27th most populated U.S. state in 1940 with 1.9 million residents, to being the 4th most populated U.S. state and having nearly 13 million residents in 2000. Southeast states such as North Carolina and Georgia saw large population growth increases as well during the late 20th century.

==Geography==
The United States Geological Survey defines Southeastern United States as including the states of Alabama, Arkansas, Florida, Georgia, Kentucky, Louisiana, Mississippi, North Carolina, South Carolina, Tennessee, Puerto Rico, the United States Virgin Islands, and Virginia.

There is no official United States Census Bureau definition of the Southeastern United States. They instead divide a larger region which includes Texas, Oklahoma, Maryland, Delaware, Washington, D.C., and West Virginia, designated as &quot;the South,&quot; into three separate subregions, none of which are conventionally considered to define the Southeast.

The nonprofit American Association of Geographers defines the Southeastern United States as including Alabama, Florida, Georgia, Kentucky, Maryland, Mississippi, North Carolina, South Carolina, Tennessee, Virginia, and West Virginia. The OSBO (Organization Supporting Business Owners) uses the same states, but includes Arkansas and Louisiana. The states of Delaware and Missouri, along with the U.S. capital of Washington, D.C., are also sometimes added in definitions of the term.

==Demographics==
===Most populous states===
The most populous states in the region as of the 2020 United States census are: Florida (21,538,187), followed by Georgia (10,711,908), and North Carolina (10,439,388).

===U.S. territories===

Puerto Rico and the U.S. Virgin Islands are located southeast of Florida, and are considered to be in the South / Southeastern U.S. by the FAA, Agricultural Research Service, and the U.S. National Park Service.

===Largest cities===

 
These are the largest cities in the Southeastern region of the United States by population, according to the United States Census Bureau in 2015:


These are the metropolitan areas of the Southeastern region which exceed one million in population according to the United States Census Bureau&#x27;s 2023 estimates:as estimated by the United States Census Bureau

===Combined statistical areas===
&quot;Beyond Megalopolis&quot; by Virginia Tech&#x27;s Metropolitan Institute, an attempt to update Jean Gottmann&#x27;s work with current trends, defines two &quot;megapolitan areas&quot; contained within the Southeast, out of a total of ten such areas in the United States:
*&quot;Piedmont&quot; extending from North Carolina to Alabama
*&quot;Peninsula&quot; covering South Florida and Central Florida
Two others tie some areas on the margins of the Southeast to urban centers in other regions:
*&quot;Gulf Coast&quot; extending as far east as the western tip of Florida
*&quot;Northeast&quot; including much of Maryland, Central Virginia, and Eastern Virginia.

These are the combined statistical areas of the Southeastern region which exceed 1  million in population according to the United States Census Bureau&#x27;s 2016 estimates. Note that the metropolitan areas of Tampa and Richmond are not included in any CSAs, so they are included in the table without constituent areas.

==Culture==

The predominant culture of the Southeast U.S. has its origins with the settlement of the region by European colonists and African slaves during the 17th to 19th centuries, as large groups of English, Scottish, Scotch-Irish, Germans, Spanish, French, and Acadians migrated to the region. Since the late 20th century, the &quot;New South&quot; has emerged as the fastest-growing area of the United States economically. Multiculturalism has become more mainstream in the Southeastern states. African Americans remain a dominant demographic, at around 30% of the total population of the Southeast. Cities along this corridor from north to south include Raleigh-Durham area, Greensboro, Charlotte, Spartanburg, Greenville, Atlanta, and Montgomery.

==Climate==
Most of the southeastern part of the United States is dominated by the humid subtropical climate (Cfa/Cwa). As one nears the southern portion of Florida, the climate gradually becomes tropical, as the winter season and all months have a mean temperature above (the defined coldest monthly mean temperature of tropical climates).

Seasonally, summers are generally hot and humid throughout the entire region. The Bermuda High pumps hot and moist air mass from the tropical Atlantic Ocean and eastern Gulf of Mexico westward toward the southeast United States, creating the typical sultry tropical summers. Daytime highs are often in the upper 80s to lower 90s F. Rainfall is summer concentrated along the Gulf Coast and the South Atlantic coast from Norfolk, Virginia southward, reaching a sharp summer monsoon-like pattern over peninsular Florida, with dry winters and wet summers. Sunshine is abundant across the southeastern United States in summer, as the rainfall often comes in quick, but intense downpours. The mid-South, especially Tennessee, and the northern halves of Mississippi, Alabama, and Georgia, have maximum monthly rainfall amounts in winter and spring, owing to copious Gulf moisture and clashes between warm, moist air from the Gulf of Mexico and cold, dry air from Canada during the cold season. In this area, December, March, or April are typically the wettest months; August to October, the driest months (for example, in Tupelo, MS, Huntsville, AL and Memphis, TN).

Winters are cool in the northern areas like Tennessee, Virginia, Maryland, and western North Carolina, with average high temperatures in the range in January. Farther south, winters become milder across interior eastern North and South Carolina, Georgia, and Alabama, with average January highs in the range. As one nears the Gulf of Mexico, coastal plain, and coastal areas of Georgia and the Carolinas, winters become warm, with daytime highs near or over . Once in Florida, daytime highs are above from just south of St. Augustine on the Atlantic coast and Clearwater on the Gulf Of Mexico. Extreme southern Florida has the warmest winter temperatures (mid 70&#x27;s F) in the United States. Winters tend to be very dry and sunny across Florida, with a gradual increase in winter rainfall with increasing latitude, especially west of the Appalachian Mountains.

==Economy==

The Southeast economically has changed dramatically since the late 20th century. There has been a boom in its service economy, manufacturing base, high technology industries, and the financial sector. Examples of this include the surge in tourism in Florida and along the Gulf Coast; the numerous new automobile production plants such as Mercedes-Benz in Tuscaloosa; Hyundai in Montgomery; Toyota Motors in Blue Springs, Mississippi; Kia in West Point, Georgia; BMW production plant in Greer, South Carolina; Volkswagen in Chattanooga; GM manufacturing plant in Spring Hill, Tennessee; with the Nissan North American headquarters in Franklin, Tennessee; Mercedes-Benz USA; and Porsche North American headquarters in the Atlanta area; the two largest research parks in the country: Research Triangle Park in the Triangle area of North Carolina (the world&#x27;s largest) and the Cummings Research Park in Huntsville, Alabama (the world&#x27;s fourth largest); corporate headquarters of Bank of America, Truist Financial, and Wells Fargo in Charlotte, North Carolina, the corporate headquarters of Verso Paper and FedEx in Memphis, Tennessee as well as the corporate headquarters of the Coca Cola Company, Delta Airlines, the Home Depot and United Parcel Service in Atlanta, Georgia. Dillards, along with Heifer International, is headquartered in Little Rock, Arkansas. Walmart is also headquartered in Arkansas. 
In 2020, Fortune 500 companies having headquarters in the Southeast region include: 22 in Virginia, 18 in Georgia, 18 in Florida, 13 in North Carolina, and 10 in Tennessee. This economic expansion has enabled parts of the South to have some of the lowest unemployment rates in the United States. In Alabama, there is the large-scale manufacturing project owned by the German steel megacorporation ThyssenKrupp, which operates a massive, state-of-the-art facility in Mobile.

Even with certain states and areas in the Southeast doing well economically, many Southeast states and areas still have a high poverty rate when compared to the U.S. nationally. In 2017, seven Southeast states were in the top ten nationwide when it came to having the highest poverty rate.

===Research and development areas===
Research Triangle Park in the Raleigh–Durham urban area of North Carolina, has emerged as a major hub of technology, governmental, and biotechnological research and development. The Cummings Research Park in the Huntsville, Alabama area, is the second-largest research complex in the nation. Located in Huntsville is the Redstone Arsenal, United States Army Missile Command, the U.S. Space &amp; Rocket Center, NASA&#x27;s Marshall Space Flight Center and other key government, military, and aerospace agencies. Tullahoma, TN contains the Arnold Air Force Base. The base is home to the Arnold Engineering Development Complex (AEDC), the most advanced and largest complex of flight simulation test facilities in the world. 
The National High Magnetic Field Laboratory in Tallahassee, Florida, is the largest laboratory in the world devoted to the study of magnetism. The University of South Carolina is currently constructing a research campus in downtown Columbia, and the university is the nation&#x27;s only National Science Foundation-funded Industry/University Cooperative Research Center for Fuel Cells.

==Education==
===Higher education===

The region includes a number of notable universities, public and private, whose research exert influence globally. Chief among public universities are:

There are a number of well-known private institutions, as well. Notable among these are:

The region is home to the greatest number of historically black colleges and universities in the nation. The three largest in the region are: 

==Sports==
===Professional===

There are nine National Football League (NFL) franchises across the region: the Atlanta Falcons, Baltimore Ravens, Carolina Panthers, Jacksonville Jaguars, Miami Dolphins, New Orleans Saints, Tampa Bay Buccaneers, Tennessee Titans, and Washington Commanders. 

The Southeast has seven National Basketball Association (NBA) franchises: the Atlanta Hawks, Charlotte Hornets, Memphis Grizzlies, Miami Heat, New Orleans Pelicans, Orlando Magic, and Washington Wizards.

Major League Baseball (MLB) maintains five teams in the Southeast: the Atlanta Braves, Baltimore Orioles, Miami Marlins, Tampa Bay Rays, and Washington Nationals.

The Southeast has five National Hockey League (NHL) franchises: the Carolina Hurricanes, Florida Panthers, Nashville Predators, Tampa Bay Lightning, and Washington Capitals.

Major League Soccer currently holds six clubs: Atlanta United FC, Charlotte FC, DC United, Inter Miami CF, Nashville SC and Orlando City SC.

The majority of NASCAR teams are headquartered in the Charlotte area along with the sports operations headquarters and media outlets. Tracks in the region include Atlanta Motor Speedway,Bristol Motor Speedway,Charlotte Motor Speedway,Darlington Raceway, Daytona International Speedway, Homestead-Miami Speedway, Martinsville Speedway, Nashville Superspeedway, North Wilkesboro Speedway, Richmond Raceway, and Talladega Superspeedway.

The southeast also hosts two of the three legs of the American Triple Crown: the Kentucky Derby in Louisville, and the Preakness Stakes in Baltimore. The Derby is considered the western leg of the crown and the Preakness is traditionally considered the southern leg.

===College=== 

The Atlantic Coast Conference is an NCAA Division I conference with many Southeastern college teams, including the: Clemson Tigers, Duke Blue Devils, Florida State Seminoles, Georgia Tech Yellow Jackets, Louisville Cardinals, Miami Hurricanes, North Carolina Tar Heels, NC State Wolfpack, Virginia Cavaliers, Virginia Tech Hokies, and Wake Forest Demon Deacons.

<text>Retinal detachment is a condition where the retina pulls away from the tissue underneath it. It may start in a small area, but without quick treatment, it can spread across the entire retina, leading to serious vision loss and possibly blindness. Retinal detachment is a medical emergency that requires surgery.

The retina is a thin layer at the back of the eye that processes visual information and sends it to the brain. When the retina detaches, common symptoms include seeing floaters, flashing lights, a dark shadow in vision, and sudden blurry vision. The most common type of retinal detachment is rhegmatogenous, which occurs when a tear or hole in the retina lets fluid from the center of the eye get behind it, causing the retina to pull away.

Rhegmatogenous retinal detachment is most commonly caused by posterior vitreous detachment, a condition where the gel inside the eye breaks down and pulls on the retina. Risk factors include older age, nearsightedness (myopia), eye injury, cataract surgery, and inflammation.

Retinal detachment is usually diagnosed through a dilated eye exam. If needed, additional imaging tests can help confirm the diagnosis. Treatment involves surgery to reattach the retina, such as pneumatic retinopexy, vitrectomy, or scleral buckling. Prompt treatment is crucial to protect vision.

== Mechanism and classification ==

The retina is a thin layer of tissue located at the back of the eye. It processes visual information and transmits it to the brain. Retinal detachment occurs when the retina separates from the layers underneath it. This impairs its function, potentially leading to vision loss. Retinal detachment often requires urgent medical intervention to prevent permanent vision loss.

Retinal detachments are divided into three main types based on their distinct causes.

* Rhegmatogenous retinal detachment is caused by a tear or break in the retina. This allows vitreous humor, the fluid that normally sits in the center of the eye, to build up behind the retina. As a result, the retina can eventually separate from the tissues underneath it. This is the most common type of retinal detachment.
* Tractional retinal detachment occurs when scar tissue on the retina exerts a pulling force, leading to detachment. This is occurs in the absence of retinal tears or breaks and is most commonly associated with abnormal blood vessel growth due to proliferative diabetic retinopathy. Other causes include trauma, retinal vein occlusion, sickle cell retinopathy, and retinopathy of prematurity.
* Exudative retinal detachment occurs when fluid accumulates beneath the retina, causing it to detach. This occurs in the absence of retinal tears or breaks. Common causes include age-related macular degeneration, inflammatory diseases, ocular tumors, and injuries to the eye.

== Signs and symptoms ==

Retinal detachment is typically painless, with symptoms often starting in the peripheral vision.

Symptoms of retinal detachment, as well as posterior vitreous detachment (which often, but not always, precedes it), may include:
* Floaters suddenly appearing in the field of vision or a sudden increase in the number of floaters. Floaters may resemble cobwebs, specks of dust, or shapes such as ovals or circles
* Flashes of light in vision (photopsia)
*Experiencing a &quot;dark curtain&quot; or shadow moving from the peripheral vision toward the central vision
*Sudden blurred vision
Rarely, a retinal detachment may be caused by atrophic retinal holes, in which case symptoms such as floaters or flashes of light may not occur.

== Causes and risk factors ==
Rhegmatogenous retinal detachments are most often caused by posterior vitreous detachment (PVD). This occurs when the vitreous begins to liquefy and shrink, pulling away from the retina. While this process is typically harmless and often presents without symptoms, it can lead to retinal holes or tears that may progress to a full retinal detachment if left untreated.

=== Risk Factors Related to Posterior Vitreous Detachment ===
Factors that increase the likelihood of posterior vitreous detachment and therefore, retinal detachment, include:

* Age: The vitreous liquefies as a normal part of aging, increasing the risk for subsequent detachment. 
* Myopia (nearsightedness): Individuals with myopia have a longer axial length of the eyeball, which increases their risk of developing posterior vitreous detachment.
* Trauma: Blunt and penetrating trauma to the eye can disrupt the vitreous, leading to posterior vitreous detachment.
* Cataract surgery: Previous cataract surgery, particularly when associated with vitreous loss, is linked to shifts in the vitreous, increasing the risk of posterior vitreous detachment.
* Inflammation: Inflammatory eye conditions, such as uveitis, are associated with an increased risk of posterior vitreous detachment.

=== Other Risk Factors ===
Less frequently, rhegmatogenous retinal detachments can occur without PVD. Risk factors for retinal detachment that are not related to posterior vitreous detachment include:

* Family history of retinal detachment
* Previous retinal detachment in the other eye
* Lattice degeneration: Thinning of the retina, which increases its susceptibility to breaks or tears.
* Cystic retinal tuft: A small, raised spot present on the retina from birth that increases the risk for tears and detachment.

== Diagnosis ==

The gold standard for diagnosing retinal detachment is a dilated fundus examination to check the back of the eye using an indirect ophthalmoscope. This often involves a technique called scleral depression, which helps provide a clear view of the entire retina. A slit lamp examination of the front of the eye may also reveal small pigment particles, called Shafer&#x27;s sign, which may indicate a retinal tear.

If the view of the retina is not clear, imaging techniques such as ultrawide-field fundus photography, B-scan ultrasonography, and optical coherence tomography (OCT) may help to identify a detachment. Fundus photography provides a detailed view of the back of the eye, potentially revealing retinal tears or breaks. On B-scan ultrasonography, a detached retina typically appears as a membrane floating in the vitreous cavity, moving in a wave-like motion. OCT can detect fluid behind the retina, involvement of the macula (the central part of the retina), and other abnormalities within the retinal layers.

MRI and CT scans are less commonly used for the diagnosis of retinal detachment, but they may be useful in certain cases. In an emergency department setting, bedside ultrasonography can also be used for diagnosis.

== Treatment ==
Rhegmatogenous retinal detachment typically requires prompt surgical intervention to preserve vision. The 3 main options include pneumatic retinopexy, vitrectomy, and scleral buckle. These are selected based on how the patient presents, including the number, location and size of retinal tears, surgeon preference, and cost.

=== Pneumatic retinopexy ===
Pneumatic retinopexy is an office-based procedure often used for small and uncomplicated retinal detachments, particularly those involving a single tear in the superior part of the retina. A gas bubble is injected into the vitreous cavity to push the retina back into place against the back of the eye. Additionally, freezing (cryotherapy) or lasers are used to seal the retinal tears and prevent further detachment. Following the procedure, patients are advised to maintain a specific head position to ensure the gas bubble remains in place over the tear and to facilitate proper healing. Patients must also avoid air travel, high altitudes, and scuba diving until the gas bubble dissolves. Over time, the gas bubble will be naturally replaced by the eye’s vitreous fluid.

=== Vitrectomy ===

Vitrectomy is a surgical procedure used to treat complicated retinal detachments. It is especially useful for large retinal tears or tears that are not easily visible. Vitrectomy is also used for proliferative vitreoretinopathy, which is the growth of scar tissue on the retina that can occur after a retinal detachment. In this technique, the vitreous gel is removed from the eye to relieve the pulling force on the retina. Any fluid behind the retina is drained, and tears are sealed with freezing or lasers. The removed vitreous is then replaced with either a gas bubble or silicone oil, which stabilizes the retina. Patients treated with a gas bubble are advised to maintain a face-down position and refrain from air travel, high altitudes, and scuba diving. In patients treated with silicone oil, a follow-up surgery is required to remove the oil. For patients who have not previously undergone cataract surgery, vitrectomy increases the risk of developing a cataract in the treated eye.

=== Scleral buckle surgery ===
Scleral buckle surgery is a procedure in which one or more silicone bands are placed around the outer layer of the eye, known as the sclera. The procedure typically begins with freezing (cryotherapy) to seal retinal tears. Next, the silicone band is placed to create an indentation on the sclera, applying inward pressure that helps reattach the retina to the back of the eye. After surgery, the person is often positioned in a prone position to reduce the risk of hemorrhages by preventing blood from reaching the macula. The band typically remains in place permanently unless complications occur. During the procedure, subretinal fluid may also be drained, though it is sometimes left to reabsorb naturally. This approach is often preferred for younger patients, those who have not undergone cataract surgery, those without posterior vitreous detachment (PVD), and those with retinal dialysis, a type of tear commonly caused by trauma. Possible complications of this procedure include missed retinal breaks, improper positioning of the buckle, infection, inflammation, and double vision immediately after surgery, which typically resolves on its own. Scleral buckling can also be combined with vitrectomy for specific cases.

== Prognosis ==
If left untreated, retinal detachment can lead to permanent vision loss.

Rhegmatogenous retinal detachment repair has a success rate of approximately 95%, meaning the retina is successfully reattached in most cases. It is important for the repair to be successful the first time, as the chances of reattachment and good vision decrease with each additional surgery.

Visual outcomes may vary even after successful reattachment. The results for a patient’s vision depend greatly on whether the macula, the central part of the retina responsible for detailed vision, remains attached. If the macula detaches, the risk of poor vision increases, particularly if surgery is delayed.

Other factors that can affect the prognosis include the extent of the detachment and the timing of surgery, with earlier treatment generally leading to better outcomes.

Common causes of failure in retinal detachment repair include missed or poorly sealed retinal breaks, new retinal breaks, and proliferative vitreoretinopathy (PVR). PVR, a condition where scar tissue grows on the retina, occurs in approximately 8–10% of patients undergoing treatment for retinal detachment.

==Prevention==
Patients at high risk for rhegmatogenous retinal detachment, such as those with myopia (nearsightedness), those who have had cataract surgery, those with a previous detachment in the other eye, and those with lattice degeneration or posterior vitreous detachment (PVD), should be educated on the symptoms and warning sings of retinal detachment and seek urgent treatment if they occur.

They should also have regular eye exams, even if they are not experiencing symptoms.

Individuals with certain types of retinal tears or breaks may require treatments such as lasers or freezing (cryotherapy) to prevent detachment.

Additionally, these patients are advised to avoid contact sports, eye trauma, and other high-risk activities, and to wear protective eyewear to reduce the risk of eye injury.

== Epidemiology ==
Rhegmatogenous retinal detachment affects between 5.3 and 12.6 individuals per 100,000 each year, depending on the geographic region. The highest rates are seen in Europe, followed by the Western Pacific and then the Americas. Additionally, the prevalence of rhegmatogenous retinal detachment is increasing alongside the rising rates of myopia worldwide.

<doc id="817003" wikidata="Q4834807" url="?curid=817003" title="BBC Domesday Project">
<text>The BBC Domesday Project was a partnership between Acorn Computers, Philips, Logica, and the BBC (with some funding from the European Commission&#x27;s ESPRIT programme) to mark the 900th anniversary of the original &quot;Domesday Book&quot;, an 11th-century census of England. It has been cited as an example of digital obsolescence on account of the physical medium used for data storage.

This new multimedia edition of Domesday was compiled between 1984 and 1986 and published in 1986. It included a new &quot;survey&quot; of the United Kingdom, in which people, mostly school children, wrote about geography, history or social issues in their local area or just about their daily lives. This was linked with maps, and many colour photos, statistical data, video and &quot;virtual walks&quot;. The project also incorporated professionally prepared video footage, virtual reality tours of major landmarks and other prepared datasets such as the 1981 census. Over a million people participated in the project, including children from more than 9,000 schools.

== Purpose ==
Initially estimated to require the involvement of 10,000 schools and about one million children, the intention was to make the role of schools central in a data gathering project that would assign each school to a geographical area, have parents and local societies collect data, with the schools &quot;acting as a focus and providing the computer&quot;. Questionnaires about geography, amenities and land use were to be completed, with school pupils and other contributors also able to write about their local area and &quot;the issues affecting them&quot; in their own words.

In the context of the educational relevance of microcomputers and of information retrieval software operating on repositories of data that might potentially be built by children, it was felt that:
With regard to potential applications of the system and of its significance, one contemporary reviewer of the system reflected:
== Format ==


The project was stored on adapted LaserDiscs in the LaserVision Read Only Memory (LV-ROM) format, which contained not only analogue video and still pictures, but also digital data, with 300 MB of storage space on each side of the disc. Initial estimates indicated a total storage capacity of 2 GB per disc, described as sufficient for 80,000 pictures (including satellite images) and &quot;half a million text pages&quot; plus software to process maps and graphical information. The delivered product was estimated to offer a &quot;total potential capacity&quot; of around 1400 MB with half of that capacity filled.

Data and images were selected and collated by the BBC Domesday project based in Bilton House in West Ealing. Pre-mastering of data was carried out on a VAX-11/750 mini-computer, assisted by a network of BBC Micro microcomputers. The discs were mastered, produced, and tested by the Philips Laservision factory in Blackburn, England.

Viewing the discs required a BBC Master AIV - an Acorn BBC Master expanded with a SCSI controller and the 65C102 &quot;Turbo&quot; co-processor - which controlled a Philips VP415 LaserVision laserdisc player. The user interface consisted of the BBC Master&#x27;s keyboard and a trackball (more specifically the Marconi RB2 Trackerball rebranded by Acorn). The enhancements provided by the Philips VP415 permitted computer control and access to data stored on the discs.

The project was split over two laserdiscs:
*The &quot;Community Disc&quot; contained personal reflections on life in Britain and is navigated on a geographic map of Britain. The entire country was divided into blocks that were 4 km wide by 3 km long, based on Ordnance Survey grid references. Each block could contain up to 3 photographs and a number of short reflections on life in that area. Most, but not all, of the blocks are covered in this way. In addition more detailed maps of key urban areas and blocks of 40x30 km and regional views were captured, allowing &quot;zoom-out&quot; and &quot;zoom-in&quot; functions. The community disc was double sided, with a &quot;Southern&quot; and a &quot;Northern&quot; side, although country-wide data at the 40x30km level and above was on both sides.
*The &quot;National Disc&quot; contained more varied material, including data from the 1981 census, sets of professional photographs and virtual reality-like walkarounds shot for the project. Side 2 of the National disc contained video material. The material was stored in a hierarchy and some of it could be browsed by walking around a virtual art gallery, clicking on the pictures on the wall, or walking through doors in the gallery to enter the VR walkarounds. In addition a natural language search was provided, supported through the application of the Porter stemming algorithm.

== Supported platforms ==
The application software for the project was written in BCPL (a precursor to C) for portability between different hardware and software platforms, although the software required additional patches to run on the RM Nimbus version of the system. An Amiga version of the system was considered but not initiated.

== Concerns over electronic preservation ==

In 2002, concerns emerged over the potential unreadablility of the discs as computers capable of reading the format became rare and drives capable of accessing the discs even rarer. Aside from the difficulty of emulating the original code, a major issue was that the still images had been stored on the laserdisc as single-frame analogue video, which were overlaid by the computer system&#x27;s graphical interface. The project had begun years before JPEG image compression and before truecolour computer video cards had become widely available.

In November 2023, a podcast episode by Tim Harford, &quot;Laser Versus Parchment: Doomsday for the Disc,&quot; from the series &quot;Cautionary Tales&quot;, described and contextualized many of the troubled issues surrounding the historical trajectory of the BBC Domesday Project&#x27;s data.

=== CAMiLEON (2002) ===
However, the BBC later announced that the CAMiLEON project (a partnership between the University of Leeds and University of Michigan, led by Margaret Hedstrom and managed by researcher Paul Wheatley) had developed a system capable of accessing the discs using emulation techniques. The CAMiLEON project transferred the text and database files stored on the Domesday laserdiscs to a Linux-based computer using an SCSI connection to the player. Images, stored as still-frame video, were digitised at full resolution using video capture hardware and stored uncompressed, ultimately requiring around 70 GB of storage per side of each laserdisc. A modified version of the Free Software emulator, BeebEm, was then used to access the archived data, with enhancements introduced to support emulation of the Turbo co-processor, SCSI communication and laserdisc player functionality.

=== Videotape Digitisation Efforts (2003) ===
Another team, working for the UK National Archives (who hold the original Domesday Book) tracked down the original 1-inch videotape masters of the project. These were digitised and archived to Digital Betacam.

=== Domesday 1986 (2004-2008) ===
A version of one of the discs was created that runs on a Windows PC. This version was reverse-engineered from an original Domesday Community disc and incorporates images from the videotape masters. It was initially available only via a terminal at the National Archives headquarters in Kew, but was published on the web as Domesday 1986 (at domesday1986.com) in July 2004. This version was taken off-line early in 2008 when its programmer, Adrian Pearce, suddenly died.

=== Domesday Reloaded (2011-2018) ===


In 2011, a team at BBC Learning, headed by George Auckland, republished much of the Community disc data in a short-lived web-based format. This data comprising around 25,000 images was loaded onto the BBC Domesday Reloaded website which went online in May 2011 and offline in June 2018, being hosted in archived form at the National Archives thereafter. The data extraction underlying the Domesday Reloaded site was carried out in 2003 and 2004 by Simon Guerrero and Eric Freeman.

=== Domesday86 (2020) ===
Subsequent efforts by the Domesday86 project have taken a broader approach to preservation by attempting to preserve the technologies used to access Domesday and other interactive video content, along with the content itself, focusing on the laserdiscs as preservation artefacts in their own right. The stated objective of the group is to create hardware and software to permit the use of the BBC Domesday system without the need for the rare and expensive specialist hardware employed by the original system, also providing support for the original hardware, releasing developments under free software and open hardware licences.

=== Museum preservation initiatives (2020) ===
The Centre for Computing History in Cambridge has undertaken a similar project to preserve the data from the Domesday Project and made it available online. In 2011, with the National Disc and Community Disc processed, the museum was investigating copyright issues before releasing the URL to the general public. An emulator has since been made available in collaboration with the Domesday86 project. The museum has a working Domesday system on display and accessible to the public. They also have possibly the largest Domesday and interactive laserdisc archive in the world.

The National Museum of Computing based beside Bletchley Park in Milton Keynes has a working Domesday system in its BBC Micro Classroom for visitors to use.

== Archival of material ==
The deputy editor of the Domesday Project, Mike Tibbets, has criticised the UK&#x27;s National Data Archive to which the archive material was originally entrusted, arguing that the creators knew that the technology would be short-lived but that the archivists had failed to preserve the material effectively.

== Language and regional issues ==
An initial decision to only support the entry of text in English for the Domesday discs led to a dispute involving Welsh schools in areas where local education authorities supported both English and Welsh as first languages:
A compromise saw the BBC allowing ten pages of Welsh text that were to be accompanied by ten pages of English translation for each school submitting content in the Welsh language. With such schools effectively seeing their allocation being reduced from twenty pages to ten, some Welsh schools were apparently boycotting the project in protest at this apparent discrimination. Other concerns from Welsh schools were raised in relation to featured amenities to be surveyed by each school, these being less commonplace in rural areas, suggesting a bias towards urban areas in the design of the survey criteria.

Although as many as 13,000 schools showed an interest in collecting and submitting data, these schools mainly covered urban areas, leaving &quot;large gaps of knowledge&quot; in rural areas, and leading the Domesday Project team to reach out to the Women&#x27;s Institute, Scout Association, Guide Association and to farmers.

== Copyright issues ==
In addition to preserving the project, untangling the copyright issues also presents a significant challenge. In addition to copyright surrounding the many contributions made by the estimated 1 million people who took part in the project, there are also copyright issues that relate to the technologies employed. It is likely that the Domesday Project will not be completely free of copyright restrictions until at least 2090 (assuming no further extensions of copyright terms).

==Interactive video==
The BBC Master-based system used to deliver the Domesday Project content, known as the Domesday Advanced Interactive Video (AIV) System, was also intended as a platform to support other interactive video applications, integrating with programming languages such as BASIC and Logo via the operating system. Opportunities were perceived for the introduction of the technology beyond the education sector and into various areas of the public and private sectors, estimating &quot;300,000 potential business customers&quot;. Acorn set up a subsidiary, Acorn Video, offering the platform under the name Master Video with a choice of Philips or Pioneer laserdisc player for £3220, or £3750 for a more compact version. (This ostensibly followed on from earlier products: the Acorn Interactive System, based on the BBC Micro and Pioneer or Philips laserdisc player, which only supported unidirectional control of a laserdisc player via a serial link, and the Viewpoint Interactive Video Workstation.)

BBC Enterprises and Virgin released interactive video discs for education. Following on from the initial Domesday content, the &quot;Ecodisc&quot; from BBC Enterprises provided an ecological simulation of Slapton Ley nature reserve designed to complement biology and ecology field trips at secondary school level. It was priced at £169 plus VAT, with one side of the disc containing the interactive content and data, the other side containing the BBC Schools Television programme &quot;Ecology and Conservation&quot;.

Virgin&#x27;s &quot;North Polar Expedition&quot; title, in contrast to Ecodisc, provided the software to support interaction on separate floppy disks instead of as LV-ROM content. It was priced at £199 plus VAT, and was reportedly a &quot;testbed for CDI applications&quot; planned by Virgin Publishing. Having received one unfavourable verdict that the title offered &quot;a tired question and answer format in what should be an innovative new medium&quot;, a response to this particular review attempted to address such criticisms by noting the limitations of the interaction method employed by the Domesday system, the tightly coupled sound and video capabilities of the medium, and the need to deliver and improve the software without involving the &quot;expensive and complex LV-ROM mastering process&quot;. The response also questioned the future of the LV-ROM format, in contrast to Laservision and CD-ROM, also indicating that CD-I would remove various restrictions experienced with the laserdisc medium.

The BBC&#x27;s &quot;Countryside&quot; disc provided various census and agricultural datasets and was sponsored by a broad consortium of public and private sector organisations. The BBC&#x27;s &quot;Volcanoes&quot; disc, produced in association with Oxford University Press, featured volcanic eruption footage and animated computer graphics sequences by award-winning animator, Rod Lord, together with hypertext features. The &quot;Volcanoes&quot; disc (priced at £194.35) employed &quot;new AIV features like hypertext&quot; and had graphical content that was created on Archimedes computers. Shell Education Services offered an &quot;interactive video project pack&quot; intended for educational use in various subjects based on &quot;a system developed by Shell UK to provide route maps in filling stations&quot;. Epic Industrial Communications offered a &quot;complete course in solid state electronics&quot; for the AIV system, priced at £2300 plus VAT.

Support software was also made for the AIV platform such as the Domesday Display application suite which allowed users to extract data and pictures from the laserdiscs and to present them in the form of a slideshow. The Domesday Presenter application focused on Domesday and AIV system laserdiscs, whereas the Domesday Captions application allowed video frames to be selected from AIV system laserdiscs or any other CAV (constant angular velocity) laserdisc, with the user adding their own captions.

Although this particular interactive video implementation had progressed away from previous &quot;cumbersome and boring&quot; solutions relying on the navigation of sequential-access video tape, tape-based solutions persisted as competitors. For example, the tape-based VP170 Video Presenter package from Interactive Media Resources (whose system processor was packaged similarly to an Acorn second processor) and the Companion system from Bevan Technology which could control VHS-based tape and Philips LaserVision players, both apparently offered support for integration with applications using the Microtext language. Ivan Berg Software (a one-time partner with Acornsoft on various titles) offered the Take Five system on Betamax format video tape with the BBC Micro supplying &quot;question-and-answer frames&quot; in interactive training course material. The Polymedia PCL 1000 also offered a combination of BBC Micro and Sony Betamax video tape recorder bundled with interface, single disc drive, colour monitor and software for £2,450. Earlier competitors included the Felix Link interface from Felix Learning Systems, supporting laserdisc, VHD video discs, U-Matic tapes, with VHS tapes promised, along with Cameron Communications&#x27; Interact B system offering touchscreen control over a Thorn EMI VHD video disc player.

Acorn&#x27;s success in the interactive video market was reportedly hindered by Acorn&#x27;s financial difficulties of 1985 putting the company&#x27;s &quot;support or commitment&quot; into question, even leading to the BBC taking over the development of the Domesday Project&#x27;s retrieval software from Acorn. Consequently, a contract for 1500 machines with Lloyd&#x27;s Bank ended up being signed by Video Logic, and other potential customers had not progressed beyond trial purchases of Acorn&#x27;s machines. By early 1988, &quot;fewer than 2,000&quot; Domesday systems had been sold, with the total price of the system being around £5,200. However, a voucher scheme had been in operation, reducing the purchase price to £3000, and this was to be extended until the end of that year.

Subsequent Acorn machines were also featured in laserdisc solutions. For instance, a system was offered by Eltec Computers and the British Nuclear Forum consisting of a BBC A3000, LaserVision 406 player, genlock card, and three discs designed by educators at Newcastle University aimed at secondary schools. The system cost £1899. Some software on the RISC OS platform also supported use of laserdisc players such as the &quot;Key Plus&quot; data collection and analysis software for the educational market. Oak Solutions&#x27; &quot;Genesis&quot; product supported use of laserdisc hardware, with &quot;The Battle of the Somme&quot; title, produced by Netherhall School in conjunction with NCET and the Imperial War Museum, incorporating &quot;Laservision material which really brings the project alive&quot; and offering &quot;potentially a new beginning for that old Domesday system&quot;.

<doc id="817016" wikidata="Q629804" url="?curid=817016" title="Falkland Sound">
<text>The Falkland Sound () is a sea strait in the Falkland Islands. Running southwest-northeast, it separates West and East Falkland.

==Name==
The sound was named by John Strong in 1690 for Viscount Falkland, the name only later being applied to the archipelago and its two largest islands. The Spanish name &quot;Estrecho de San Carlos&quot; refers to the ship &quot;San Carlos&quot; which visited in 1768; confusingly the English name &quot;San Carlos Water&quot; is a much smaller inlet on East Falkland - and gives its name to San Carlos, Port San Carlos and the San Carlos River.

Captain John Strong of the &quot;Welfare&quot; made the first recorded landing on either of the main islands (West and East Falkland) on 29 January 1690, at Bold Cove (near Port Howard) just off Falkland Sound.

==Geography==
Islands in the Falkland Sound include Narrows Island, Great Island, the Tyssen Islands and the Swan Islands. Eddystone Rock is at the northern end of the Sound; the Arch Islands are at the southern end.

Settlements on it include Ajax Bay, New Haven, Port San Carlos, San Carlos on East Falkland and Port Howard and Fox Bay on West Falkland. A car ferry goes between Port Howard and New Haven.

Inlets and bays on the Sound include: Fox Bay, Port Howard (West Falkland); Grantham Sound, San Carlos Water, Ruggles Bay (East Falkland)

== Geology ==

About 400 million years ago the land that became the Falkland Islands and Antarctica&#x27;s Ellsworth Mountains, which had been part of Gondwana, broke from what is now Africa and drifted westwards relative to Africa. During the mid-Jurassic period (about 170 million years ago) the land fragment that was to become East Falkland and the land fragment that was to become West Falkland rotated about 120° relative to each other. As a result, the fold lines in West Falkland run almost south-west to north-east, parallel to the Sound. Those in the northern part of East Falkland run east-west, forming the eastern part of northern entrance to the Sound and bordering on the northern banks of San Carlos Water. The boundary between these two land fragments, the Falkland Sound Fault, lies close to and parallel with the western shore of the Sound. Lafonia (the southern half of East Falkland), which is a much newer formation, has no folds.

It is believed that at times during the Pleistocene era, the seabed was some lower than the present time–sufficient for the sound to be bridged.

==Records==
On 21st January 2025, Esther Bertram of Stanley and Nuala Knight of Fox Bay swam across Falkland Sound, beginning from Fanning Head, East Falkland. The swimmers reached Jersey Point on West Falkland after 2 hours 37 minutes.

<doc id="817030" wikidata="Q949268" url="?curid=817030" title="Nanda Empire">
<text>The Nanda Empire was a vast empire that governed in Magadha and Gangetic plains with an enormous geographical reach in 4th-century BCE northeastern India, with some accounts suggesting existence as far back as the 5th century BCE. The Nandas built on the successes of their Haryanka and Shaishunaga predecessors and instituted a more centralised administration. Ancient sources credit them with amassing great wealth, which was probably a result of the introduction of a new currency and taxation system.

Ancient texts also suggest that the Nandas were unpopular among their subjects because of their low-status birth, excessive taxation, and general misconduct. The last Nanda king Dhana Nanda was overthrown by Chandragupta Maurya, founder of the Maurya Empire.

Modern historians generally identify the ruler of the Gangaridai and the Prasii mentioned in ancient Greco-Roman accounts as a Nanda king. While describing Alexander the Great&#x27;s invasion of Punjab (327–325 BCE), Greco-Roman writers depict this kingdom as a great military power. The prospect of a war against this kingdom, coupled with the exhaustion resulting from almost a decade of campaigning, led to a mutiny among Alexander&#x27;s homesick soldiers, putting an end to his Indian campaign.

==Origins==
===Homeland===
The Nanda Empire became a significant ruling authority in Magadha, prior to the creation of the Maurya Empire who established a large empire in the Ganga valley. In the Buddhist accounts, the Nandas ascended the throne by open conquest in the field and not through secret intrigues or assassinations.

Greek authors refer to a great kingdom to the east of the kingdom of King Porus, beyond the Jhelum River. The kingdom is referred to as belonging to the Gangaridae and Prasioi, and the capital at &quot;Palibothra&quot;, which is generally accepted as referring to Pataliputra. Prasioi is derived from the Sanskrit term Prachya, meaning &quot;eastern,&quot; and Gangaridae is traced to the Gangetic plain. These references suggest that the kingdom of Magadha extended dominion over the country to the east of the Jhelum, and its capital was at Pataliputra.

===Ancestry===
Both Indian and Greco-Roman traditions characterise the dynasty&#x27;s founder as of low birth. According to Greek historian Diodorus (1st century BCE), Porus told Alexander that the contemporary Nanda king was thought to be the son of a barber. Roman historian Curtius (1st century CE) adds that according to Porus, this barber became the former queen&#x27;s paramour thanks to his attractive looks, treacherously assassinated the then king, usurped the supreme authority by pretending to act as a guardian for the then princes, and later killed the princes.

The Jain tradition, as recorded in the &quot;Avashyaka Sutra&quot; and the 12th-century text &quot;Parishishta-parvan&quot;, corroborates the Greco-Roman accounts, stating that the first Nanda king was the son of a barber. According to the 12th century text &quot;Parishishta-parvan&quot;, the mother of the first Nanda king was a courtesan. However, the text also states that the daughter of the last Nanda king married Chandragupta, because it was customary for Kshatriya girls to choose their husbands; thus, it implies that the Nanda king claimed to be a Kshatriya, that is, a member of the warrior class.

The Puranas name the dynasty&#x27;s founder as Mahapadma, and claim that he was the son of the Shaishunaga king Mahanandin. However, even these texts hint at the low birth of the Nandas, when they state that Mahapadma&#x27;s mother belonged to the Shudra class, the lowest of the varnas.

Since the claim of the barber ancestry of the dynasty&#x27;s founder is attested by two different traditions—Greco-Roman and Jain, it appears to be more reliable than the Puranic claim of Shaishunaga ancestry.

The Buddhist tradition calls the Nandas &quot;of unknown lineage&quot; (&quot;annata-kula&quot;). According to &quot;Mahavamsa&quot;, the dynasty&#x27;s founder was Ugrasena, who was originally &quot;a man of the frontier&quot;: he fell into the hands of a gang of robbers, and later became their leader. He later ousted the sons of the Shaishunaga king Kalashoka (or Kakavarna).

K. N. Panikkar suggested that the Nandas were the sole Kshatriyas in India &quot;at the time of the Mauryas&quot; and M. N. Srinivas suggested that the &quot;other Kshatriya castes have come into existence through a process of caste mobility from among the lower castes&quot;.

==Regnal period==
There is little unanimity among the ancient sources regarding the total duration of the Nanda reign or their regnal period. For example, the &quot;Matsya Purana&quot; assigns 88 years to the rule of the first Nanda king alone, while some manuscripts of the &quot;Vayu Purana&quot; state the total duration of the Nanda rule as 40 years. The 16th century Buddhist scholar Taranatha assigns 29 years to the Nandas.

It is difficult to assign precise date for the Nanda and other early dynasties of Magadha. Historians Irfan Habib and Vivekanand Jha date the Nanda rule from –322 BCE, relying on the Sri Lankan Buddhist tradition which states that the Nandas ruled for 22 years. Historian Upinder Singh dates the Nanda rule from 364/345 BCE to 324 BCE, based on the assumption that Gautama Buddha died in .

According to another theory, based on astronomical calculations, the first Nanda king ascended the throne in 424 BCE. Proponents of this theory also interpret the Hathigumpha inscription to mean that &quot;Nandaraja&quot; (the Nanda king) flourished in year 103 of the Mahavira Era, that is, in 424 BCE.

The 14th century Jain writer Merutunga, in his &quot;Vichara-shreni&quot;, states that king Chandra Pradyota of Avanti died on the same night as the Jain leader Mahavira. He was succeeded by his son Palaka, who ruled for 60 years. After that, the Nandas rose to power at Pataliputra and captured the Avanti capital Ujjayini. The Nanda rule, spanning the reigns of nine kings, lasted for 155 years, after which the Mauryas came to power. According to the Śvetāmbara Jain tradition, Mahavira died in 527 BCE, which would mean that the Nanda rule—according to Merutunga&#x27;s writings—lasted from 467 BCE to 312 BCE. According to historian R. C. Majumdar, while all the chronological details provided by Merutunga cannot be accepted without corroborative evidence, they cannot be dismissed as entirely unreliable unless contradicted by more reliable sources.

==Nanda kings==
The Buddhist, Jain, and Puranic traditions all state that there were 9 Nanda kings, but the sources differ considerably on the names of these kings.

According to the Greco-Roman accounts, the Nanda rule spanned two generations. For example, the Roman historian Curtius (1st century CE) suggests that the dynasty&#x27;s founder was a barber-turned-king, and that his son was the dynasty&#x27;s last king, who was overthrown by Chandragupta. The Greek accounts name only one Nanda king—Agrammes or Xandrames—who was a contemporary of Alexander. &quot;Agrammes&quot; may be a Greek transcription of the Sanskrit word &quot;Augrasainya&quot; (literally &quot;son or descendant of Ugrasena&quot;, Ugrasena being the name of the dynasty&#x27;s founder according to the Buddhist tradition).

The Puranas, compiled in India in (but based on earlier sources), also state that the Nandas ruled for two generations. According to the Puranic tradition, the dynasty&#x27;s founder was Mahapadma: the &quot;Matsya Purana&quot; assigns him an incredibly long reign of 88 years, while the &quot;Vayu Purana&quot; mentions the length of his reign as only 28 years. The Puranas further state that Mahapadma&#x27;s 8 sons ruled in succession after him for a total of 12 years, but name only one of these sons: Sukalpa. A &quot;Vayu Purana&quot; script names him as &quot;Sahalya&quot;, which apparently corresponds to the &quot;Sahalin&quot; mentioned in the Buddhist text &quot;Divyavadana&quot;. Dhundhi-raja, an 18th-century Puranic commentator, names one of the Nanda kings as Sarvatha-siddhi, and states that his son was Maurya, whose son was Chandragupta Maurya. However, the Puranas themselves do not talk of any relation between the Nanda and the Maurya dynasties.

According to the Sri Lankan Buddhist text &quot;Mahavamsa&quot;, written in Pali language, there were 9 Nanda kings – they were brothers who ruled in succession, for a total of 22 years. These nine kings were:

==Imperial extent==
The Nanda capital was located at Pataliputra (near present-day Patna) in the Magadha region of eastern India. This is confirmed by the Buddhist and Jain traditions, as well as the Sanskrit play &quot;Mudrarakshasa&quot;. The Puranas also connect the Nandas to the Shaishunaga dynasty, which ruled in the Magadha region. The Greek accounts state that Agrammes (identified as a Nanda king) was the ruler of the Gangaridai (the Ganges valley) and the Prasii (probably a transcription of the Sanskrit word &quot;prachya&quot;s, literally &quot;easterners&quot;). According to the later writer Megasthenes (), Pataliputra (Greek: Palibothra) was located in the country of the Prasii, which further confirms that Pataliputra was the Nanda capital.

The Nanda empire appears to have stretched from present-day Punjab in the west to Odisha in the east. An analysis of various historical sources – including the ancient Greek accounts, the Puranas, and the Hathigumpha inscription – suggests that the Nandas controlled eastern India, the Ganges valley, and at least a part of Kalinga. It is also highly probable that they controlled the Avanti region in Central India, which made it possible for their successor Chandragupta Maurya to conquer present-day Gujarat western India. According to the Jain tradition, the Nanda minister subjugated the entire country up to the coastal areas.

The Puranas state that the Nanda king Mahapadma destroyed the Kshatriyas, and attained undisputed sovereignty. The Kshatriyas said to have been exterminated by him include Maithalas, Kasheyas, Ikshvakus, Panchalas, Shurasenas, Kurus, Haihayas, Vitihotras, Kalingas, and Ashmakas.

* The Maithala (literally, &quot;of Mithilā&quot;) territory was located to the north of Magadha, on the border of present-day Nepal and northern Bihar. This region had come under the control of Magadha during the reign of the 5th century BCE king Ajatashatru. The Nandas probably subjugated the local chieftains, who may have retained some degree of independence from Magadha.
* The Kasheyas were the residents of the area around Kashi, that is, present-day Varanasi. According to the Puranas, a Shaishunaga prince was appointed to govern Kashi, which suggests that this region was under Shaishunaga control. The Nandas may have captured it from a successor of the Shaishunaga prince.
* The Ikshvakus ruled the historical Kosala region of present-day Uttar Pradesh, and had come into conflict with the Magadha kingdom during the reign of Ajatashatru. Their history after the reign of Virudhaka is obscure. A passage of the 11th century story-collection &quot;Kathasaritsagara&quot; refers to the Nanda camp (&quot;kataka&quot;) in the Ayodhya town of the Kosala region. This suggests that the Nanda king went on a military campaign to Kosala.
* The Panchalas occupied the Ganges valley to the north-west of the Kosala region, and there are no records of their conflict with the Magadha monarchs before the Nanda period. Therefore, it appears that the Nandas subjugated them. According to the Greek accounts, Alexander expected to face king Agrammes (identified as a Nanda king) if he advanced eastwards from the Punjab region. This suggests that the Nanda territory extended up to the Ganges river in the present-day western Uttar Pradesh.
* The Shurasenas ruled the area around Mathura. The Greek accounts suggest that they were subordinates to the king of the Prasii, that is, the Nanda king.
* The Kuru territory, which included the sacred site of Kurukshetra, was located to the west of the Panchala territory. The Greek records suggest that the king of Gangaridai and Prasii controlled this region, which may be taken as corrorobrative evidence for the Nanda conquest of the Kuru territory.
* The Haihayas ruled the Narmada valley in central India, with their capital at Mahishmati. The Nanda control over this territory does not seem improbable, given that their predecessors – the Shaishunagas – are said to have subjugated the rulers of Avanti in central India (according to the Puranas), and their successors – the Mauryas – are known to have ruled over Central India.
* The Vitihotras, according to the Puranas, were closely associated with the Haihayas. Their sovereignty is said to have ended before the rise of the Pradyota dynasty in Avanti, far earlier than the Nandas and the Shaishunagas came to power. However, a passage in the &quot;Bhavishyanukirtana&quot; of the Puranas suggests that the Vitihotras were contemporaries of the Shaishunagas. It is possible that the Shaishunagas restored a Pradyota prince as a subordinate ruler, after defeating the Pradyotas. The Nandas may have defeated this Vitihotra ruler. The Jain writers describe the Nandas as the successors of Palaka, the son of king Pradyota.
* The Kalingas occupied the coastal territory in present-day Odisha and Andhra Pradesh. The Nanda control of this region is corroborated by the Hathigumpha inscription of the later king Kharavela (). The inscription states that &quot;Nanda-raja&quot; (the Nanda king) had excavated a canal in Kalinga, and had taken a Jain idol from Kalinga. According to the inscription, this canal had been dug &quot;ti-vasa-sata&quot; years ago: the term is variously interpreted as &quot;three hundred&quot; or &quot;one hundred and three&quot;.
* The Ashmakas occupied the Godavari valley in the Deccan region. According to one theory, Nanded in this region was originally called &quot;Nau Nand Dehra&quot; (abode of the nine Nandas), which may be considered as evidence of the Nanda control of this area. However, there is no concrete evidence that the Nanda rule extended to the south of the Vindhya range.

The Amaravathi hoard of Punch marked coins have revealed imperial standard coins dating back to the Nandas besides other dynasties of Magadha, including the Mauryas; but it is not certain when this region was annexed by the Magadhan rulers.

Some Kuntala country (North Mysore) inscriptions suggest that the Nandas also ruled it, which included a part of present-day Karnataka in southern India. However, these inscriptions are relatively late (), and therefore, cannot be considered as reliable in this context. The Magadha empire included parts of southern India during the reign of the Mauryas – the successors of the Nandas – but there is no satisfactory account of how they came to control this area. For example, an inscription discovered at Bandanikke states:

==Military strength==
Alexander the Great invaded north-western India at the time of Agrammes or Xandrames, whom modern historians generally identify as the last Nanda king – Dhana Nanda. In the summer of 326 BCE, Alexander&#x27;s army reached the Beas River (Greek: Hyphasis), beyond which the Nanda territory was located.

According to Curtius, Alexander learned that Agrammes had 200,000 infantry; 20,000 cavalry; 3,000 elephants; and 2,000 four-horse chariots. Diodorus gives the number of elephants as 4,000. Plutarch inflates these numbers significantly, except the infantry: according to him, the Nanda force included 200,000 infantry; 80,000 cavalry; 6,000 elephants; and 8,000 chariots. It is possible that the numbers reported to Alexander had been exaggerated by the local Indian population, who had the incentive to mislead the invaders.

The Nanda army did not have the opportunity to face Alexander, whose soldiers mutinied at the Beas River, refusing to go any further in the east. Alexander&#x27;s soldiers had first started to agitate to return to their homeland at Hecatompylos in 330 BCE, and the stiff resistance that they had met in north-western India in the subsequent years had demoralised them. They mutinied, when faced with the prospect of facing the Nanda army, forcing Alexander to withdraw from India.

Greek authors also refer to the Gangaridae and Prasioi as having a fine military tradition, suggesting the fact that during Alexander the Great&#x27;s invasion of India in the late 4th century BCE, the country was under the rule of two factions. The two factions may have been a confederacy, or one may have overshadowed the other. The king referred to by Diodorus as Xandrames or Agrammes is thought to have been a Nanda king, and this would suggest that the Nandas were in control of this vast country to the east, including the land of the Gangaridae.

==Administration==
Little information survives on the Nanda administration today. The Puranas describe the Nanda king as &quot;ekarat&quot; (&quot;single ruler&quot;), which suggests that the Nanda empire was an integrated monarchy rather than a group of virtually independent feudal states. However, the Greek accounts suggest the presence of a more federated system of governance. For example, Arrian mentions that the land beyond the Beas River was governed by &quot;the aristocracy, who exercised their authority with justice and moderation.&quot; The Greek accounts mention the Gangaridai and the Prasii separately, although suggesting that these two were ruled by a common sovereign. Historian H. C. Raychaudhuri theorises that the Nandas held centralised control over their core territories in present-day Bihar and Uttar Pradesh, but allowed considerable autonomy in the frontier parts of their empire. This is suggested by Buddhist legends, which state Chandragupta was unable to defeat the Nandas when he attacked their capital but was successful against them when he gradually conquered the frontier regions of their empire.

The Nanda kings appear to have strengthened the Magadha kingdom ruled by their Haryanka and Shaishunaga predecessors, creating the first great empire of northern India in the process. Historians have put forward various theories to explain the political success of these dynasties of Magadha. Pataliputra, the capital of Magadha, was naturally protected because of its location at the junction of the Ganges and the Son rivers. The Ganges and its tributaries connected the kingdom with important trade routes. It had fertile soil and access to lumber and elephants of the adjacent areas. Some historians have suggested that Magadha was relatively free from the Brahmanical orthodoxy, which may have played a role in its political success; however, it is difficult to assess the veracity of this claim. D. D. Kosambi theorised that Magadha&#x27;s monopoly over iron ore mines played a major role in its imperial expansion, but historian Upinder Singh has disputed this theory, pointing out that Magadha did not have a monopoly over these mines, and the iron mining in the historical Magadha region started much later. Singh, however, notes that the adjoining Chota Nagpur Plateau was rich in many minerals and other raw materials, and access to these would have been an asset for Magadha.

===Ministers and scholars===
According to the Jain tradition, Kalpaka was the minister of the first Nanda king. He became a minister reluctantly, but after assuming the office, he encouraged the king to adopt an aggressive expansionist policy. The Jain texts suggest that the ministerial offices of the Nanda Empire were hereditary. For example, after the death of Shakatala, a minister of the last Nanda king, his position was offered to his son Sthulabhadra; when Sthulabhadra refused the offer, Shakatala&#x27;s second son Shriyaka was appointed as the minister.

The &quot;Brihatkatha&quot; tradition claims that under the Nanda rule, the city of Pataliputra not only became the abode of the goddess of material prosperity (Lakshmi), but also of the goddess of learning (Sarasvati). According to this tradition, notable grammarians such as Varsha, Upavarsha, Panini, Katyayana, Vararuchi, and Vyadi lived during the Nanda period. While much of this account is unreliable folklore, it is probable that some of the grammarians who preceded Patanjali lived during the Nanda period.

===Wealth===
Several historical sources refer to the great wealth of the Nandas. According to the &quot;Mahavamsa&quot;, the last Nanda king was a treasure-hoarder, and amassed wealth worth 80 &quot;kotis&quot; (800 million). He buried these treasures in the bed of the Ganges river. He acquired further wealth by levying taxes on all sorts of objects, including skins, gums, trees, and stones.

A verse by the Tamil poet Mamulanar refers to &quot;the untold wealth of the Nandas&quot;, which was &quot;swept away and submerged later on by the floods of the Ganges&quot;. Another interpretation of this verse states this wealth was hidden in the waters of the Ganges. The 7th-century Chinese traveller Xuanzang mentions the &quot;five treasures of king Nanda&#x27;s seven precious substances&quot;.

Greek writer Xenophon, in his &quot;Cyropaedia&quot; (4th century BCE), mentions that the king of India was very wealthy, and aspired to arbitrate in the disputes between the kingdoms of West Asia. Although Xenophon&#x27;s book describes the events of the 6th century BCE (the period of Cyrus the Great), historian H. C. Raychaudhuri speculates that the writer&#x27;s image of the Indian king may be based on the contemporary Nanda king.

The &quot;Kashika&quot;, a commentary on Panini&#x27;s grammar, mentions &quot;Nandopakramani manani&quot; – a measuring standard introduced by the Nandas. This may be a reference to their introduction of a new currency system and punch-marked coins, which may have been responsible for much of their wealth. A hoard of coins found at the site of ancient Pataliputra probably belongs to the Nanda period.

==Religion==
The Nandas and the Mauryas appear to have patronised the religions originating in the Greater Magadha region, namely Jainism and Ajivikism. However, the rulers of the empire never engaged in conversion of their subjects to other religions and there is no evidence that these rulers discriminated against any contemporary religion.

Greater Magadha, east of the confluence of the Ganges and the Yamuna, was the area where the second urbanisation took place, and where Jainism and Buddhism originated. It was outside Aryavarta, the heartland of Vedic Brahmanism west of the this confuence, associated with one single state, the Kuru kingdom. The Nanda emperors, and later the Mauryan emperors, had little interest in Brahmanism, and the conquest of the Vedic heartland by the Nanda and Maurya rule deprived the Brahmins of their patrons, threatening the survival of the Vedic ritual tradition, and creating opportunities for Buddhists and Jains to spread their religion outside the convines of Magadha. In response, Brahmins broadened their services, eventually resulting in the Hindu synthesis of Brahmanical orthodoxy with local religious traditions, which came to dominate India. Nevertheless, only with the Brahminical Shunga Empire (185 BCE–73 BCE) did the Brahmins gain some prominence in Maghadian society, though it was still not considered to be part of Aryavarta.

The Jain tradition suggests that several Nanda ministers were inclined towards Jainism. When Shakatala, a minister of the last Nanda king, died, his son Sthulabhadra refused to inherit his father&#x27;s office, and instead became a Jain monk. Sthulabhadra&#x27;s brother Shriyaka accepted the post.

==Architecture==

Pataliputra Voussoir Arch

A granite stone fragment of an arch discovered by K. P. Jayaswal from Kumhrar, Pataliputra has been analysed as a pre Maurya-Nanda period keystone fragment of a trefoil arch of gateway with mason&#x27;s marks of three archaic Brahmi letters inscribed on it which probably decorated a Torana. The wedge-shaped stone with indentation has Mauryan polish on two sides and was suspended vertically.

==Nanda era==
According to K. P Jayaswal, Nanda era is mentioned in three sources. Kharavela&#x27;s Hathigumpha inscription mentions Nandaraja constructing canal 103rd year of the Nanda period. According to Al-Biruni, the Sri-Harsha era was being used in areas of Kannauj and Mathura and there was a difference of 400 years between Sri-Harsha era and Vikrama era which would make it fall in 458 BCE, the attributes of which matched with the Nanda kings. According to 12th century Yedarava inscription of Chalukya king Vikramaditya VI, Nanda era along with Vikram era and Shaka era were extant which were abolished in favour of a new Chalukyan era, but other scholars have opined that evidences are too meager to make anything conclusive.

==Unpopularity and overthrow==
All historical accounts agree that the last Nanda king was unpopular among his subjects. According to Diodorus, Porus told Alexander that the contemporary Nanda king was a man of &quot;worthless character&quot;, and was not respected by his subjects as he was thought to be of low origin. Curtius also states that according to Porus, the Nanda king was despised by his subjects. According to Plutarch, who claims that Androkottos (identified as Chandragupta) met Alexander, Androkottos later declared that Alexander could have easily conquered the Nanda territory (Gangaridai and Prasii) because the Nanda king was hated and despised by his subjects, as he was wicked and of low origin. The Sri Lankan Buddhist tradition blames the Nandas for being greedy and for imposing oppressive taxation. The Puranas of India label the Nandas as &quot;adharmika&quot;, indicating that they did not follow the norms of &quot;dharma&quot; or righteous conduct.

The Nanda dynasty was overthrown by Chandragupta Maurya, who was supported by his mentor (and later minister) Chanakya. Some accounts mention Chandragupta as a member of the Nanda family. For example, the 11th century writers Kshemendra and Somadeva describe Chandragupta as a &quot;son of the genuine Nanda&quot; (&quot;purva-Nanda-suta&quot;). Dhundiraja, in his commentary on the &quot;Vishnu Purana&quot;, names Chandragupta&#x27;s father as Maurya; he describes Maurya as a son of the Nanda king Sarvatha-siddhi and a hunter&#x27;s daughter named Mura.

The Buddhist text &quot;Milinda Panha&quot; mentions a war between the Nanda general Bhaddasala (Sanskrit:Bhadrashala) and Chandragupta. According to the text, this war led to the slaughter of 10,000 elephants; 100,000 horses; 5,000 charioteers; and a billion foot soldiers. While this is obviously an exaggeration, it suggests that the overthrow of the Nanda dynasty was a violent affair.

<text>Barnaby Rudge: A Tale of the Riots of Eighty (commonly known as Barnaby Rudge) is a historical novel by English novelist Charles Dickens. &quot;Barnaby Rudge&quot; was one of two novels (the other was &quot;The Old Curiosity Shop&quot;) that Dickens published in his short-lived (1840–1841) weekly serial &quot;Master Humphrey&#x27;s Clock&quot;. &quot;Barnaby Rudge&quot; is largely set during the Gordon Riots of 1780.

&quot;Barnaby Rudge&quot; was the fifth of Dickens&#x27;s novels to be published. It had initially been planned to appear as his first, but changes of publisher led to many delays, and it first appeared in serial form in the &quot;Clock&quot; from February to November 1841.

It was Dickens&#x27;s first historical novel. His only other is &quot;A Tale of Two Cities&quot; (1859), also set in revolutionary times. &quot;Barnaby Rudge&quot; is one of his less popular novels; British historian and Dickens biographer Peter Ackroyd has called it &quot;one of Dickens&#x27;s most neglected, but most rewarding, novels&quot;.
It has rarely been adapted for film or television. The last production was a 1960 BBC production. Prior to that, silent films were made in 1911 and 1915.

==Plot summary==

Gathered around the fire at the Maypole Inn, in the village of Chigwell, on an evening of foul weather in the year 1775, are John Willet, proprietor of the Maypole, and his three cronies. One of the three, Solomon Daisy, tells an ill-kempt stranger at the inn a well-known local tale of the murder of Reuben Haredale which had occurred 22 years earlier on that very day. Reuben had been the owner of the Warren, a local estate which is now the residence of Geoffrey, the deceased Reuben&#x27;s brother, and Geoffrey&#x27;s niece, Reuben&#x27;s daughter Emma Haredale. After the murder, Reuben&#x27;s gardener and steward went missing and were suspects in the crime. A body was later found and identified as that of the steward, so the gardener was assumed to be the murderer.

Joe Willet, son of the Maypole proprietor, quarrels with his father because John treats 20-year-old Joe as a child. Finally having had enough of this ill-treatment, Joe leaves the Maypole and goes for a soldier, stopping to say goodbye to the woman he loves, Dolly Varden, daughter of London locksmith Gabriel Varden. He initially asks her to come with him and be his wife, but being &quot;a spoilt child&quot;, she shallowly rejects Joe&#x27;s proposal, despite his previously having risked his own life to save her from an assault by the lecherous Hugh.

Meanwhile, Edward Chester is in love with Emma Haredale. Both Edward&#x27;s father, Sir John Chester, and Emma&#x27;s uncle, the Catholic Geoffrey Haredale – these two are sworn enemies – oppose the union after Sir John untruthfully convinces Geoffrey that Edward&#x27;s intentions are dishonourable. Sir John intends to marry Edward to a woman with a rich inheritance, to support John&#x27;s expensive lifestyle and to pay off his creditors. Similar to Joe, Edward quarrels with his father and leaves home for the West Indies.

Barnaby Rudge, an &quot;innocent&quot;, wanders in and out of the story with his pet raven, Grip. Barnaby&#x27;s mother begins to receive visits from the ill-kempt stranger, whom she feels compelled to protect. She later gives up the annuity she had been receiving from Geoffrey Haredale and, without explanation, takes Barnaby and leaves the city hoping to escape the unwanted visitor.

The story advances five years to a chilly evening in early 1780. On the 27th anniversary of Reuben Haredale&#x27;s murder, Solomon Daisy, winding the bell tower clock, sees a ghost in the churchyard. He reports this hair-raising event to his friends at the Maypole, and John Willet decides that Geoffrey Haredale should hear the story. He departs in a winter storm taking the sinister Hugh, of the Maypole, as a guide. On the way back to the Maypole, John and Hugh are met by three men seeking the way to London. Finding that London is still 13 miles off, the men seek refuge for the night. Beds are prepared for them at the Maypole.

 These visitors prove to be Lord George Gordon; his secretary, Gashford; and a servant, John Grueby. Lord George makes an impassioned speech full of anti-papist sentiment, arguing (among other things) that Catholics in the military would, given a chance, join forces with their co-religionists on the Continent and attack Britain. Next day the three depart for London, inciting anti-Catholic sentiment along the way and recruiting Protestant volunteers, from whom Ned Dennis, the hangman of Tyburn, and the ill-mannered Simon Tappertit, former apprentice to Gabriel Varden, are chosen as leaders. Hugh, finding a handbill left at the Maypole Inn, joins the Protestant throng which Dickens describes as &quot;sprinkled doubtless here and there with honest zealots, but composed for the most part of the very scum and refuse of London, whose growth was fostered by bad criminal laws, bad prison regulations, and the worst conceivable police.&quot;

Barnaby and his mother have been living quietly in a country village, their whereabouts unknown despite Geoffrey Haredale&#x27;s attempts to find them. The mysterious stranger finds them and sends Stagg, a blind man, to attempt to get money from them. Barnaby and his mother then flee to London, hoping to lose their pursuers again.

When Barnaby and his mother arrive at Westminster Bridge, they see an unruly crowd heading for a meeting on the Surrey side of the river. Barnaby is duped into joining them, despite his mother&#x27;s pleas. The rioters then march on Parliament and burn several Catholic churches and the homes of Catholic families.

A detachment led by Hugh and Dennis head for Chigwell, intent on exacting revenge on Geoffrey Haredale, leaving Barnaby to guard The Boot, the tavern they use as their headquarters. The mob loots the Maypole Inn on their way to the Warren, then they burn the Warren to the ground. Emma Haredale and Dolly Varden (now Emma&#x27;s companion) are taken captive by the rioters, much to Hugh&#x27;s delight. Soldiers take Barnaby prisoner; he is held in Newgate, which the mob plans to storm.

Haredale captures the mysterious stranger haunting Mrs. Rudge at the smoldering ruins of the Warren. He turns out to be Barnaby Rudge Sr., the steward who had murdered Reuben Haredale and his gardener years earlier. It is revealed that he had switched clothes with the dead gardener to divert suspicion from himself.

The rioters capture Gabriel Varden, with the help of his wife&#x27;s maid Miggs, and attempt to have the locksmith help them break into Newgate to release prisoners. He refuses and is rescued by two men, one of whom has only one arm. The rioters then burn Newgate where Barnaby and his father are being held. All of the prisoners escape, but Barnaby, his father, and Hugh are later betrayed by Dennis the hangman and captured by soldiers. Dennis has changed sides, believing he will obtain the bounty offered for them as well as numerous clients needing his special talents. With the army patrolling the streets, the rioters scatter, and many are killed.

The one-armed man turns out to be Joe Willet, who has returned from fighting against the American revolutionaries. Joe and Edward Chester turn out to be the rescuers of Gabriel Varden. The pair then rescue Dolly and Emma.
Dennis is arrested and sentenced to die with Hugh and Barnaby. Hugh and Dennis are hanged. Barnaby, through the efforts of Gabriel Varden, is pardoned.

Joe and the now-grateful Dolly are married and become proprietors of the rebuilt Maypole. Edward Chester and Emma are married and go to the West Indies. Miggs tries to get her position back at the Varden household, is rejected, and becomes a jailer at a women&#x27;s prison. Simon Tappertit, his legs crushed in the riots, becomes a shoe-black. Gashford later commits suicide. Lord George Gordon is held in the Tower and is then judged to be innocent of inciting the riots. Sir John Chester, now a member of parliament, turns out to be the father of Hugh (Sir John had never revealed to his own son Edward that Hugh was his brother) and is killed in a duel by Geoffrey Haredale. Haredale escapes to the continent where he ends his days in a monastery. Barnaby and his mother live out their years tending a farm at the Maypole Inn where Barnaby can work effectively due to his physical strength.

==Allusions and references in other works==
The character Grip was based on a raven kept as a pet by Dickens. The raven inspired Edgar Allan Poe to write his most famous poem, &quot;The Raven&quot;.

Dickens based the Maypole Tavern on the Kings Head, Chigwell, a 17th-century public house, situated on High Road, opposite the entrance to Roding Lane.

==Adaptations==
Thomas Higgie adapted it into a three-act play in 1854. Charles Selby and Charles Melville did the same in 1875. The latter was produced at the English Opera House.

In 1915 Thomas Bentley directed &quot;Barnaby Rudge&quot;, &quot;the biggest-budget British film of its day&quot;, but it is now lost.

The BBC made a 13-episode TV series in 1960.

&quot;Barnaby Rudge&quot; was re-invented as a stage play, &quot;The Locksmith of London&quot;, by Eileen Norris. It was staged in 2012 at the Kings Theatre, Southsea, by Alchemy Theatre, where the Dickens Fellowship attended a performance during their annual conference.

BBC Radio 4 chose it for their &quot;Classic Serial&quot; in 2014, and cast an actor with Down&#x27;s Syndrome, Daniel Laurie, in the title role.

<text>In heraldry, an armiger is a (natural or juridical) person entitled to use a heraldic achievement (e.g., bear arms, an &quot;armour-bearer&quot;) either by hereditary right, grant, matriculation, or assumption of arms. Such a person is said to be armigerous; a family or a clan likewise.

==Etymology==
The Latin word literally means &quot;arms-bearer&quot;. In high and late medieval England, the word referred to an esquire attendant upon a knight, but bearing his own unique armorial device.

 was also used as a Latin cognomen, and is now found as a rare surname in English-speaking countries.

==Modern period==
Today, the term &quot;armiger&quot; is well-defined only within jurisdictions, such as Canada, the Republic of Ireland, Kenya, South Africa, Malta, Spain, and the United Kingdom, where heraldry is regulated by the state or a heraldic body, such as the College of Arms, the Chief Herald of Canada, the Court of the Lord Lyon or the Office of the Chief Herald of Ireland. A person can be so entitled either by proven (and typically agnatic) descent from a person with a right to bear a heraldic achievement, or by virtue of a grant of arms to himself. Merely sharing the same family name of an armiger is insufficient. British armigers are considered gentlemen and equated to untitled nobility by organisations such as the CILANE and the Order of Malta, a grant of arms confirms or confers such gentle (untitled noble) status. This is not the case for Continental armigers, who may bear noble or merely burgher arms with the latter according no social precedence.

The usage of a heraldic achievement is usually governed by legal restrictions; these restrictions are independent of the copyright status and independent of a coat of arms depiction. A coat of arms represents its owner. Though it can be freely represented, it cannot be appropriated, or used in such a way as to create a confusion with or a prejudice to its owner.

In the Netherlands, only the heraldry of noble families is regulated.

In Sweden and Finland the nobility has had, since 1762, the prerogative to use an open helmet, while others use a closed helmet. In Britain, the untitled nobility uses closed helmets.

In the Spanish nobility, &quot;armígero&quot; was a low specific rank to which a certain group of untitled nobles were entitled. In modern heraldry, the term &quot;blasonado&quot; is also used.

<doc id="817050" wikidata="Q2308372" url="?curid=817050" title="Rosh yeshiva">
<text>Rosh yeshiva (, pl. , &quot;&quot;; Anglicized pl. &quot;rosh yeshivas&quot;) is the title given to the dean of a yeshiva, a Jewish educational institution that focuses on the study of traditional religious texts, primarily the Talmud and the Torah, and &quot;halakha&quot; (Jewish law). 

The general role of the rosh yeshiva is to oversee the Talmudic studies and practical matters. The rosh yeshiva will often give the highest &quot;shiur&quot; (class) and is also the one to decide whether to grant permission for students to undertake classes for rabbinical ordination, known as &quot;semicha&quot;.

The term is a compound of the Hebrew words &quot;rosh&quot; (&quot;head&quot;) and &quot;yeshiva&quot; (a school of religious Jewish education). The rosh yeshiva is required to have a comprehensive knowledge of the Talmud and the ability to analyse and present new perspectives, called &quot;chidushim&quot; () verbally and often in print.

In some institutions, such as YU&#x27;s Rabbi Isaac Elchanan Theological Seminary, the title of &quot;rosh yeshiva&quot; is given to many rabbis and the dean of the yeshiva is known as the &quot;rosh ha-yeshiva.&quot;

==Role==

The primary role of the rosh yeshiva is not simply to be the dean, but is generally to give the highest-level lecture in the yeshiva, which is usually a program of at least two years. Students who have studied in a yeshiva are generally known as &quot;students of the Rosh Yeshiva&quot;, as their lecture is the one in which they usually attain their method of Talmudic analysis and critical reasoning, and this method is based on the particular style of that rosh yeshiva. 

In addition, since yeshivas play a central role in the life of certain communities within Orthodox Judaism, the position of rosh yeshiva is more than just the position within the yeshiva. A rosh yeshiva is often seen as a pillar of leadership in extended communities.

In Hasidic Judaism, the role of rosh yeshiva is secondary to the Rebbe, who is head of the Hasidic dynasty that controls it. In many Hasidic groups, the rosh yeshiva of a school will be the son or son-in-law of the rebbe, the assumed heir of the rebbe. However, the role that yeshivahs have within Hasidic communities is not nearly as important as it is in Lithuanian Jewish (Litvishe) communities. Hasidic students usually get married at the age of 18, which—in most cases—is the end of their yeshiva education. Students in the Lithuanian Jewish communities typically continue to study until they get married starting at around age 23, with the vast majority continuing their studies in a &quot;kollel&quot; after marriage. As a result, the role that a rosh yeshiva plays in Lithuanian Jewish communities is much more important than in the Hasidic ones.

==History==
Yeshivas continue the scholarly traditions of the sages of the Mishnah and Talmud who often headed academies with hundreds of students. In the Talmudic academies in Babylonia, the rosh yeshiva was referred to as the &quot;reish metivta&quot; (&quot;head of the academy&quot; in Aramaic) and had the title of &quot;gaon&quot;. Regard for the rosh yeshiva in many ways is the transplantation of Hasidic attitudes in the Lithuanian world.

==Dynasties==
Depending on the size of the yeshiva, there may be several rosh yeshivas, sometimes from one extended family. There are familial dynasties of rosh yeshivas, for example, the Soloveitchik, Finkel, Feinstein, Kotler, and Kook families, which head many yeshivas in the United States and Israel.

==Famous rosh yeshivas==
Prior to the Holocaust, most of the large yeshivas were based in Eastern Europe. Presently, the majority of the world&#x27;s yeshivas and their rosh yeshivas are located in the United States and Israel.

The following is a list of some famous rosh yeshivas:
* Yaakov Ades
* Ezra Attiya
* Chaim Yehuda Leib Auerbach
* Shlomo Zalman Auerbach
* Leib Bakst
* Naftali Zvi Yehuda Berlin
* Avraham Yitzchak Bloch
* Moshe Mordechai Epstein
* Moshe Feinstein
* Eliezer Yehuda Finkel
* Nosson Tzvi Finkel 
* Chaim Flom
* Mordechai Gifter
* Refael Reuvain Grozovsky
* Chaim Yaakov Goldvicht

* Chaim Shmuelevitz
* Joseph B. Soloveitchik
* Adin Steinsaltz
* Naftoli Trop
* Chaim Volozhin
* Elchonon Wasserman
* Yechiel Yaakov Weinberg
* Ezra Schochet
* Henoch Leibowitz

==Rosh mesivta==

The title &quot;rosh mesivta&quot; (alt. rosh metivta) has a long history, going back many centuries. The role is comparable to a dean in a university.

==Mashgiach Ruchani==

The personal and ethical development of the students in the yeshiva is usually covered by a different personality, known as the &quot;mashgiach&quot; or spiritual supervisor. This concept, introduced by the Mussar movement in the 19th century, led to perfection of character as one of the aims of attending a yeshiva. One typical and influential &quot;mashgiach&quot; was Eliyahu Eliezer Dessler.

<text>Outland is a comic strip written and illustrated by Berkeley Breathed from 1989 until 1995. It was a Sunday-only spin-off of Breathed&#x27;s strip &quot;Bloom County&quot;, featuring many of the same characters.

==Overview==
On September 3, 1989, a month after retiring &quot;Bloom County&quot;, Breathed began his second syndicated strip with a minor character from the previous strip. Ronald-Ann Smith, a little girl from the &quot;wrong side of the tracks&quot; in Bloom County, entering a magic doorway in a grimy alley that looked down into a cheery world of &quot;cotton-candy trees&quot; known as the Outland (the ground of her world did not align with that of Outland, so the door originally appears to be hovering in the sky above it).

In its earliest form, &quot;Outland&quot; had been intended to be an experimental strip for Breathed, featuring a channel for creativity in the forms of new characters (such as Mortimer Mouse, based on the rejected name for Disney&#x27;s Mickey Mouse) and bizarre backgrounds (many of which initially resembled those seen in &quot;Krazy Kat&quot;). However, Opus the Penguin returned in the strip&#x27;s third installment, and Bill the Cat appeared months after that. Before long, the premise of another world beyond a magic door had been lost completely.

Breathed wrote that the strip became &quot;&quot;Bloom County&quot; without the continuing narrative that a daily appearance allows&quot; in the first &quot;Outland&quot; book collection. Other characters from &quot;Bloom County&quot;, such as Milquetoast the Cockroach, Steve Dallas, Oliver Wendell Jones, and Michael Binkley, became major players in the strip. Some characters, such as Cutter John, made an occasional guest appearance. A few prominent members of &quot;Bloom County&quot;, such as Milo Bloom, did not make an active appearance at all (though Milo did appear in the second-to-last installment of &quot;Outland&quot;, as a background extra on a bus).

In 1991, Breathed wrote a children&#x27;s Christmas book entitled &quot;A Wish for Wings That Work&quot;. The story revolved around Opus and included several &quot;Outland&quot; characters (although the Outland itself was not explicitly referenced in the story). It was made into an animated television movie that same year.

Finally, on March 26, 1995, Breathed decided to end the strip and retire from cartooning. At the strip&#x27;s end, Steve Dallas came out as gay, and eloped to California with Mark Slackmeyer from the comic strip &quot;Doonesbury&quot;. Opus returned to Antarctica to live with his mother, whom he had finally located (some story arcs of the original comic &quot;Bloom County&quot; focused on his quest to find her).

Eight years later, Breathed abandoned retirement and picked up where &quot;Outland&quot; had left off. The result was the Sunday-only reunion strip, &quot;Opus&quot;.

Many &quot;Outland&quot; strips have never been reprinted in color, though all appeared in black &amp; white in &quot;Comics Revue&quot; magazine.

&quot;Outland&quot; strips also appeared in the 2004 book &quot;Opus: 25 Years of His Sunday Best&quot;, which reprinted strips from &quot;Bloom County&quot; and the new &quot;Opus&quot; strip as well.

The whole output of &quot;Outland&quot; was collected by The Library of American Comics in their series, &quot;Bloom County: The Complete Library&quot; in 2012.

<text>Outland is a 1981 science fiction thriller film written and directed by Peter Hyams and starring Sean Connery, Peter Boyle and Frances Sternhagen.

Set on Jupiter&#x27;s moon Io, it has been described as a space Western and bears narrative and thematic resemblances to the 1952 film &quot;High Noon&quot;.

The film depicts a new marshal who begins work at a mining facility on the moon Io. There he discovers a dirty secret but runs into dead ends as he tries to uncover those behind it, who also attempt to silence him.

==Plot==
Federal Marshal William O&#x27;Niel is assigned to a tour of duty at the titanium ore mining outpost Con-Am 27, operated by the company Con-Amalgamated on the Jovian moon of Io. Conditions on Io are difficult; gravity is 1/6 that of Earth&#x27;s with no breathable atmosphere, and spacesuits are cumbersome with limited air. Shifts are long but significant bonuses are paid. The general manager, Mark Sheppard, boasts that productivity has broken all records since he took over. Carol, O&#x27;Niel&#x27;s wife, feels she cannot raise their son Paul on Io and leaves with their child to the Jupiter space station to await a shuttle back to Earth. Tarlow, a miner, suffers an attack of stimulant psychosishe sees spiders and rips open his spacesuitresulting in death by explosive decompression. Cane, another miner, enters an elevator without his spacesuit during another psychotic episode and dies from decompression. With the reluctant assistance of Dr. Lazarus, O&#x27;Niel investigates the deaths.

Another incident involves a worker, Sagan, who takes a prostitute hostage and threatens to kill her with a knife. O&#x27;Niel attempts to calm the man while Montone, his sergeant, sneaks in via the air duct and kills Sagan with a shotgun. O&#x27;Niel and Lazarus discover that Sagan had traces of polydichloric euthimal, a powerful amphetamine-type drug in his bloodstream, which would allow a miner to work continuously for days at a time until they burn out and turn psychotic after approximately ten months of use. O&#x27;Niel uncovers a drug distribution ring run by Sheppard and sanctioned by now repentant Montone.

Using surveillance cameras, O&#x27;Niel finds and captures Nicholas Spota, one of Sheppard&#x27;s dealers, who is murdered before he can be questioned. Montone is found garrotted. In a meat locker, O&#x27;Niel finds the latest shipment of drugs, which was shipped from the space station. He is attacked there by another dealer, Russell Yario. O&#x27;Niel, wearing an anti-garrotting collar, knocks him out, then destroys the shipment of drugs. When Sheppard finds out, he threatens O&#x27;Niel and contacts his drug distributor, asking him to send in professional hitmen. O&#x27;Niel is prepared, having hacked into Sheppard&#x27;s communications.

O&#x27;Niel waits for the arrival of the hitmen on a supply shuttle from the other side of Jupiter. Realizing what is coming and with only Dr. Lazarus willing to help him, O&#x27;Niel sends a message to his family promising to return to Earth when his &quot;job is done&quot;. O&#x27;Niel ambushes the assassins one by one. Lazarus helps him kill the first by trapping him in a pressurized corridor; O&#x27;Niel activates a bomb, causing an explosive decompression that kills the man. The second is killed in a glass greenhouse structure of the outpost when O&#x27;Niel tricks him into shooting a window, causing it to break open and blow him out to his death.

O&#x27;Niel is then confronted and attacked by Sheppard&#x27;s inside man - one of his own deputies, Sgt. Ballard. The two fight outside the outpost near the satellite structure until O&#x27;Niel pulls Ballard&#x27;s oxygen hose, suffocating him as he pushes him into an electrical generation station, vaporizing him on impact. O&#x27;Niel then confronts the surprised Sheppard inside the outpost&#x27;s recreation bar, knocking him out with one punch. It is implied Sheppard will now be brought to justice or murdered by his own associates. O&#x27;Niel, however, has already contacted his superiors about Sheppard&#x27;s associates, some of whom are Con-Am executives, and shortly before his departure receives a communication that warrants have been issued for their arrests. (This plot point is not shown in all versions of the film, including the one available from the Amazon Prime streaming service.) O&#x27;Niel bids farewell to Lazarus and leaves on the shuttle to join his wife and son on the journey back to Earth.

==Cast==
==Production==
===Development===
Hyams recalled, I wanted to do a Western. Everybody said, &#x27;You can&#x27;t do a Western; Westerns are dead; nobody will do a Western&#x27;. I remember thinking it was weird that this genre that had endured for so long was just gone. But then I woke up and came to the conclusion – obviously after other people – that it was actually alive and well, but in outer space. I wanted to make a film about the frontier. Not the wonder of it or the glamour of it: I wanted to do something about Dodge City and how hard life was. I wrote it, and by great fortune Sean Connery wanted to do it. And how many chances do you get to work with Sean Connery?
The film was developed at Universal by Hyams and producer Richard Roth. Universal turned it down then Roth, who had a development deal at 20th Century Fox under Alan Ladd Jr, took the project to Ladd&#x27;s new company, The Ladd Company.

&quot;Outland&quot; was filmed at Pinewood Studios, Iver Heath, Buckinghamshire, UK, with an initial budget of $12 million.

The film&#x27;s working title was &quot;Io&quot; after the setting of the film. This was later changed because many people read it as the number 10, or &quot;Lo&quot; (&quot;low&quot;). Principal photography took place starting with the miniature models in May 1980 and with the actors beginning in June 1980. Post-production for the film was completed in February 1981.

&quot;Outland&quot; was pioneering as the first motion picture to use Introvision, a variation on front projection that allows foreground, mid-ground and background elements to be combined in the camera, as opposed to using optical processes such as bluescreen matting. This enabled characters to convincingly walk around miniature sets of the mining colony.

==Soundtrack==
The music to &quot;Outland&quot; was composed and conducted by veteran composer Jerry Goldsmith, who had previously worked with writer/director Peter Hyams on the science fiction thriller &quot;Capricorn One&quot; (1978) and had recently provided the soundtrack to &quot;Alien&quot; (which had a similar style to &quot;Outland&quot;, reflecting isolation, remoteness and fear). The soundtrack to &quot;Outland&quot; has been released three times on disc; 19 November 1993 through GNP Crescendo (with his score to &quot;Capricorn One&quot;), June 2000 through Warner Music Group, and a two-disc extended edition released 15 June 2010 through &quot;Film Score Monthly&quot;. The expanded release also includes the John Williams music for the Ladd Company logo, the material composed by Morton Stevens for the fight between O&#x27;Niel and Ballard and the source cues for the rec room by Michael Boddicker.

The distributed 35mm film prints have Dolby Stereo audio and the 70mm Anamorphic Blow-Up film prints featured Six-Track Dolby Stereo audio. All 70mm prints were encoded for a Megasound option, in which theaters needed to be outfitted with more speakers and sound equipment. &quot;Outland&quot; was one of four films released by Warner Bros. to officially make use of their Megasound movie theater sound system, in the early 1980s.

==Reception==
===Box office===
The film received mixed reviews and box office reception when it was released. It opened strongly with $3,059,638 in weekend box office receipts in the U.S. According to &quot;The New York Times&quot; on its opening weekend the film was &quot;sensational in Los Angeles and on New York&#x27;s East Side&quot; but &quot;played poorly in many small cities. By platforming &quot;Outland&quot; – opening it in less than 350 theaters to allow it to build an audience rather slowly – the company gambled that the movie would appeal to ticketbuyers; the picture will be in trouble if it drops off at the box office this weekend.&quot;

Total estimated box offices receipts in the country wound up being between $17,374,595 and $20,000,000, just above its $14 million budget.

===Awards===
The film was nominated for the Academy Award for Best Sound (John Wilkinson, Robert W. Glass Jr., Robert Thirlwell and Robin Gregory).

===Critical===
Gary Arnold at &quot;The Washington Post&quot; had this to say: &quot;In &quot;Outland&quot;, writer-director Peter Hyams has adapted the plot of &quot;High Noon&quot; to an intriguing sci-fi environment—a huge titanium mine located on Io, a volcanic moon of Jupiter. But the conventions that worked for &quot;High Noon&quot; break down in the high-tech atmosphere of &quot;Outland&quot; and the story seems trite and dinky&quot;.

In &quot;The Boston Globe&quot;, Michael Blowen was more favorable: &quot;The parallels between &quot;Outland&quot; and Fred Zinneman&#x27;s 1952 Western &quot;High Noon&quot; are apparent. Writer-director Peter Hyams has transported the characters and motifs from the dusty frontier town of Gary Cooper to the frontiers of space. While Hyams keeps the story barreling along, he also develops a corollary anti-capitalist theme. Io is an outpost for exploitation, and [...] whether the miners are digging gold in the Colorado hills or titanium on Jupiter&#x27;s moon, the greed of the corporate class will prevail. &quot;Outland&quot; marks the return of the classic Western hero in a space helmet. His outfit has changed and his environment has expanded but he&#x27;s still the same. When Connery stares down the barrel of that shotgun, you&#x27;d better smile&quot;.

Desmond Ryan at &quot;The Philadelphia Inquirer&quot; called it: &quot;A brilliant sci-fi Western. In many ways, Hyams has made a film that is more frightening than &quot;Alien&quot;, because he surmises that space will change us very little and the real monsters we are liable to encounter will be in the next space suit.&quot;

Christopher John reviewed &quot;Outland&quot; in &quot;Ares Magazine&quot; #10 and commented that &quot;&quot;Outland&quot; is a good movie, and not just for science fiction fans. Its success will undoubtedly inspire a few tired, low-grade imitations. Hopefully, it will inspire a few more solid, interesting and entertaining films as well.&quot;

On Rotten Tomatoes, &quot;Outland&quot; holds a rating of 55% from 29 reviews.

==Home media==
&quot;Outland&quot; was first released for home video on VHS, Beta, and V2000 videotape formats in November 1982. The film had many re-issues on VHS and between 1982 and 1998, including a widescreen NTSC VHS on 7 January 1997. Videodisc releases included the CED disc in August 1983, a Laserdisc release in 1984, and a remastered laserdisc with digital sound on 28 August 1991.

&quot;Outland&quot; was released on DVD on 18 November 1997. It was presented in both letterbox widescreen and full screen on a double sided disc with the soundtrack remastered in Dolby 5.1 surround sound. The Region 1 DVD received harsh criticism for its poor quality transfer, and absence of enhancement for widescreen televisions. A &quot;making of&quot; featurette, cast and credit notes, plus a theatrical trailer are included as special features on the disc. The film was released on DVD in the UK (Region 2) in 1998. This version is anamorphically enhanced for widescreen televisions, as is the Region 4 release. &quot;Outland&quot; was released on Blu-ray Disc on 10 July 2012. The film is presented in an aspect ratio of 2.40:1 with an English DTS-HD Master Audio 5.1 surround sound mix. The disc also features a brand new commentary audio-track with the director Peter Hyams.

==North American airings==

===Pay television===
&quot;Outland&quot; debuted on pay TV in the U.S. in September 1982 on the HBO and Showtime channels. In Canada, the film was first shown in October 1983 on Superchannel. The film was broadcast uncut, commercial-free, and periodically over several months, in both countries. These pay TV broadcasts of &quot;Outland&quot; used the same source as the initial NTSC home video release.

===Network television===
The network TV premiere for &quot;Outland&quot; was on 19 May 1984 via CBS in the U.S. and was simulcasted on CTV in Canada. This re-edited version of the film, broadcast exclusively on these networks, utilized cut footage not seen in the theatrical/home video version. One notable example is an extended scene showing a more lengthy exit from the station for O&#x27;Niel and also Ballard near the end of the film suited-up while exiting; these cutting-room-floor scenes were made available for the network to extend parts of the film which allowed them to sell more commercial slots to advertisers. The inclusion of left-over footage (if made available) was common practice during the 1970s to 1980s, for network film premieres and subsequently licensed broadcasts. This version was labeled &quot;edited for television&quot; to comply with U.S. network television censorship standards of the time and never released to home video.

<text>The Shishunaga dynasty (IAST: Śaiśunāga, literally &quot;of Shishunaga&quot;) was the second ruling dynasty of Magadha. According to the Hindu &quot;Puranas&quot;, this dynasty was the second ruling dynasty of Magadha, succeeding Nagadashaka of the Haryanka dynasty.

== History ==
Shishunaga, the founder of the dynasty. He was initially an &quot;amatya&quot; or &quot;minister&quot; of the last Haryanka dynasty ruler Nāgadāsaka and ascended to the throne after a popular rebellion in .

The capital of this dynasty initially was Vaishali; but later shifted to Pataliputra, near the present day Patna, during the reign of Kalashoka. 

According to tradition, Kalashoka was succeeded by his ten sons. This dynasty was succeeded by the Nanda dynasty in .

== Rulers ==

=== Shishunaga ===

Shishunaga founded his dynasty in 413 BCE with its capital in Rajgir and later Pataliputra (both in what is now Bihar). Buddhist sources indicate that he had a secondary capital at Vaishali, formerly the capital of Vajji, until it was conquered by Magadha. The Shaishunaga dynasty ruled one of the largest empires in the Indian subcontinent. Shishunaga ended the Pradyota dynasty of Avanti, ending the centuries old rivalry between their kingdoms and annexing Avanti into Magadha.

=== Kakavarna/Kalashoka ===

According to the &quot;Puranas&quot;, Shishunaga was succeeded by his son Kakavarna and according to the Sinhala chronicles by his son Kalashoka. On the basis of the evidence of the &quot;Ashokavadana&quot;, Hermann Jacobi, Wilhelm Geiger and Ramakrishna Gopal Bhandarkar concluded that both are the same. During Shishunaga&#x27;s reign, he was the governor of Varanasi. The two most significant events of his reign are the Second Buddhist council at Vaishali in 383 BC and the final transfer of the capital to Pataliputra. According to the Harshacharita, he was killed by a dagger thrust into his throat in the vicinity of his capital. According to Buddhist tradition, he had nine or ten sons, who were ousted by Ugrasena Nanda.

== Later rulers ==
According to Buddhist tradition, ten sons of &quot;Kalashoka&quot; ruled simultaneously. The &quot;Mahabodhivamsa&quot; states their names as &quot;Bhadrasena&quot;, &quot;Korandavarna&quot;, &quot;Mangura&quot;, &quot;Sarvanjaha&quot;, &quot;Jalika&quot;, &quot;Ubhaka&quot;, &quot;Sanjaya&quot;, &quot;Koravya&quot;, &quot;Nandivardhana&quot; and &quot;Panchamaka&quot;. Only one of them is mentioned in the Puranic lists, Nandivardhana.

According to the Bhagavata Purana, Kākavarṇa was succeeded by seven kings and lists them as following; Kṣemadharmā, Kṣetrajña, Vidhisāra, Ajātaśatru, Darbhaka, Ajaya, Nandivardhana, and Mahanandin.

Other &quot;Puranas&quot; list Nandivardhana as the ninth Shaishunaga king and his son Mahanandin as the tenth and the last Shaishunaga king. Mahanandin was killed by Mahapadma, his illegitimate son .

== Decline ==
According to &quot;Puranas&quot;, Shaishunagas were followed by the Nanda dynasty, which was founded by Mahanandin&#x27;s son Mahapadma Nanda.

<text>The Father Damien&quot; Statue, also called the Saint Damien of Moloka&quot;i Statue, is the centerpiece of the entrance to the Hawaii State Capitol and the Hawaii State Legislature in Honolulu, Hawaii. A second bronze cast is displayed in the National Statuary Hall Collection in the United States Capitol, along with the &quot;Kamehameha&quot; Statue. The landmark memorializes the famous Hawaii Catholic Church priest from Belgium who sacrificed his life for the lepers of the island of Molokai. Father Damien is considered one of the preeminent heroes of Hawaii, and was canonized by Pope Benedict XVI on October 11, 2009. Cast in bronze, the statue depicts Father Damien in his later years after being diagnosed with the disease of those he attended. Much attention was given to the recreation of the disfiguring scars on the priest&#x27;s face and his arm hanging from a sling.

==Marisol Escobar==
Sixty-six artists bid for the commissioned project. Only seven were selected to create models to be reviewed by the Hawaii State Statuary Hall Commission. Marisol Escobar, a New York City sculptor, won the bid. Commission members favored the contemporary feel and look of the Escobar design as opposed to the classical representations of Father Damien that others submitted. Her statue was based on a photo she saw of him near the end of his life, which is why he is wearing glasses and has his arm is in a sling.

Taking into consideration of Father Damien&#x27;s work as a carpenter, Escobar created her initial model in wood. She made another model in plaster from which the bronze cast would be created. Unfortunately, the plaster model was broken during shipping to the foundry in Viareggio, Italy. A second plaster model was lost during shipment. Escobar finally sent a wax mold to the foundry. Coincidentally, the other most sacred of statues in Hawaii, the &quot;Kamehameha&quot; Statue commissioned by King David Kalākaua, was also lost during travel (but later recovered).

==Father Damien Day==
The official unveiling of the &quot;Father Damien&quot; Statue took place in the United States Capitol Rotunda on Father Damien Day, April 15, 1969 alongside a reproduction of the &quot;Kamehameha&quot; Statue. Hawaii celebrates Father Damien Day annually, created by an act of the Hawaii State Legislature. On that day, the statue in Honolulu is ceremoniously draped in leis followed by solemn song and prayer. In Catholicism, Father Damien is the spiritual patron of the outcast and those afflicted with AIDS and HIV.

==Other statues==
Other statues of Father Damien are located in the United States Capitol as well as in Belgium, in the cities of Brussels, Leuven and Tremelo, his place of birth.

<text>Thums Up is a brand of cola. It was introduced in 1977 to offset the withdrawal of The Coca-Cola Company from India. The brand was later bought by Coca-Cola who re-launched it in order to compete against Pepsi to capture the market.

In 2018, Coca-Cola announced they will launch Thums Up in Bangladesh, Pakistan, Sri Lanka and Nepal. In 2021, the company became a billion-dollar brand in India.

==History==
Thums Up was created in 1977, after the American company Coca-Cola withdrew from India due to regulations requiring it to disclose its formula and sell 60% of its equity to an Indian company under a government plan for foreign-owned companies to share stakes with domestic partners. The Chauhan brothers owned part of the Parle company and already had two other brands of soda, Limca and Gold Spot, which were popular in India at the time. Thums Up quickly became the most popular cola brand in India and achieved a near-monopoly among cola products in India during the 1980s, standing above other cola products such as Campa Cola, Double Seven, Dukes and United Breweries Group&#x27;s McDowell&#x27;s Crush.

Ramesh Chauhan had developed the formula from scratch, experimenting with ingredients such as cinnamon, cardamom, and nutmeg. The company also wanted the drink to be fizzy, even when it was not ice-cold, so it could be sold by vendors. After much testing and experimentation, the Chauhan brothers and their research team created a cola that was fizzier and spicier than Coca-Cola. They originally planned to name the drink &quot;Thumbs Up,&quot; but removed the &quot;b&quot; to make the name unique.

In 1991, when the Indian government opened the market to multinationals, Pepsi was the first to come in. Thums Up and Pepsi subsequently engaged in heavy competition for endorsements. Pepsi advertisements included major Indian movie stars like Juhi Chawla, while Thums Up increased its spending on cricket sponsorship. Thums Up also introduced a larger bottle, branded &quot;MahaCola&quot; (meaning &#x27;great [in size] cola&#x27;; the original size was ). This nickname gained popularity in smaller towns where people would ask for &quot;Maha Cola&quot; instead of Thums Up.

In 1993, Coca-Cola re-entered the market, and the three companies competed intensely. Later in the year, Coca-Cola bought the Parle-owned drinks Gold Spot, Limca and Thums Up for $60 million (equivalent to $ million in ). When these were sold to Coca-Cola, Thums Up had a market share of 85 percent in India.

===Relaunch===
Despite its strong overall equity, the brand was losing its popularity among the core cola-drinking age group of 12- to 25-year-olds, partly due to a lack of advertising. At first, Coca-Cola cut advertising and production for Thums Up to drive customers to their flagship brand, but they soon realised that Thums Up customers would turn to Pepsi instead of Coca-Cola if Thums Up withdrew from the market. Instead, Coca-Cola decided to use Thums Up as a rival brand to Pepsi. The Coca-Cola Company by this time had about 60.5% share of the Indian soft-drink market but found out that if it took out Thums Up, it would remain with only 28.7% of the market, hence Thums Up was re-launched, targeting 30- to 40-year-olds.

The brand was re-positioned as a &quot;manly&quot; drink, drawing on its strong taste qualities. Thums Up started an advertising campaign directly attacking Pepsi&#x27;s television commercials, focusing on the strength of the drink hoping that the depiction of an &quot;adult&quot; drink would appeal to young consumers. &quot;Grow up to Thums Up&quot; was a successful campaign. The brand&#x27;s market share and equity increased.

==Ingredients==
Thums Up contains carbonated water, sugar, acidity regulator (E338), and caffeine, as well as natural colour (150d) and added flavours (&quot;natural, nature identical and artificial flavouring substances&quot;).

==Logo and marketing==

The original Thums Up logo was a red thumbs up hand gesture with a slanted, white, sans-serif typeface. This would later be modified by Coca-Cola with blue strokes and a more modern-looking typeface.

The famous slogan until the early 1980s was &quot;Happy days are here again&quot;, coined by copywriter Vasant Kumar. The slogan later became &quot;I want My Thunder&quot;, and subsequently &quot;Taste the thunder!&quot;

Product placement in films was used in the 1980s with Thums Up appearing in the background of many Hindi films.

Advertising campaigns from Thums Up build on its &quot;strength&quot; and its perception as a macho drink.

In February 2012, South Indian actor Mahesh Babu became a spokesperson for Thums Up. In October 2012, Coca-Cola India re-signed Salman Khan as the brand ambassador of Thums Up. The company also tied with Khan&#x27;s movie &quot;Dabangg 2&quot; and his charitable organisation as part of the deal.

In 2022, the company launched its advertising campaign &quot;Toofan&quot; with Indian cricketer Jasprit Bumrah. A similar video ad was created showcasing fast bowler Mohammed Siraj. Bollywood actor Shah Rukh Khan became brand ambassador. It also partnered with South Indian actor Vijay Deverakonda.

===Sponsorship===

====Cricket====
Thums Up was a major sponsor of cricket matches and had a notable presence at Sharjah cricket matches. In the early 1980s, it came out with several postcards featuring Sunil Gavaskar and Imran Khan.

In addition to sponsoring several Indian track drivers in Sholavaram races, they sponsored several regional car and bike rallies. They were also associated for several seasons with the Lakshmi Mills Super Speeds team.

====2020 Olympics====

Thums Up announced a worldwide partnership with the 2020 Summer Olympics in July 2021 to commemorate the 100th year of India&#x27;s participation in the Olympic Games. The brand rolled out a special athlete packaging, featuring Indian Olympians Bajrang Punia, Manu Bhaker, Vikas Krishan Yadav, Deepika Kumari, and Atanu Das.

==== Tokyo 2020 Paralympics ====
The company announced a worldwide partnership with the Tokyo 2020 Paralympics in August 2021. The brand rolled out a special athlete packaging, featuring six athletes including Mariyappan Thangavelu (high jump), Sakina Khatun (powerlifting), Suyash Yadav (swimming), Navdeep Singh (javelin throw), Sumit Antil (javelin throw), and Avani Lekhara (shooting).

<text>Sanfilippo syndrome, also known as [[mucopolysaccharidosis]] type III (MPS III), is a rare lifelong genetic disease that mainly affects the brain and spinal cord. It is caused by a problem with how the body breaks down certain large sugar molecules called glycosaminoglycans (also known as GAGs or mucopolysaccharides). In children with this condition, these sugar molecules build up in the body and eventually lead to damage of the central nervous system and other organ systems.

Children with Sanfilippo syndrome do not usually show any problems at birth. As they grow, they may begin having trouble learning new things and might lose previously learned skills. As the disease progresses, they may develop seizures and movement disorders. Most children with Sanfilippo syndrome live into adolescence or early adulthood.

==Signs and symptoms==
The age of onset, severity, and progression of the disease can vary greatly between patients with different subtypes and within the same subtype. Development during the prenatal and early post-natal stages progresses normally. Between the ages of one and four is when the disease typically manifests. Affected infants appear normal, although some mild facial dysmorphism may be noticeable. Of all of the MPS diseases, Sanfilippo syndrome produces the fewest physical abnormalities. Possible clinical somatic symptoms, although rare, include coarse facial features with broad eyebrows, dark eyelashes, dry and rough hair, and skeletal pathology that affects growth.

After an initial symptom-free interval, symptoms may arise during the early years of development, from the age of one to three. Children usually present with delayed cognitive development and/or behavioral problems, followed by progressive intellectual decline resulting in severe dementia and progressive motor disease. Acquisition of speech is often slow and incomplete. Although delayed cognitive development may occur, it tends to be mild in individuals with Sanfilippo syndrome.

Between the ages of three and ten, the disease progresses to increasing behavioral disturbance including temper tantrums, hyperactivity, destructive behavior, aggressive behavior, pica, difficulties with toilet training, and sleep disturbance. As affected children initially have normal muscle strength and mobility, the behavioral disturbances may be difficult to manage. The disordered sleep in particular presents a significant problem to care providers. People with this disorder may stay in this phase for five to ten years. After that, the behavioral disturbances subside. However, patients start to become increasingly immobile and unresponsive, as individuals with Sanfilippo syndrome will gradually lose their motor skills, often require wheelchairs, and develop swallowing difficulties and seizures. Persons with Sanfilippo Syndrome tend to regress to an unresponsive or vegetative state until they pass away. The life-span of a severely affected person does not usually extend beyond late teens to early twenties. However, patients with less severe phenotypes of the disease have varied life spans, with some cases even surviving into their seventies.

The most common symptoms seen in individuals with Sanfilippo syndrome are neurological and may include intellectual disabilities, impaired language development, abnormal movements, and trouble sleeping; however, other symptoms commonly seen are excessive hair growth, chronic ear infections, respiratory infections, and poor nutrient absorption. Other signs less frequently seen in persons with Sanfilippo syndrome include behavioral changes and musculoskeletal changes such as increased muscle and joint stiffness and changes in bone growth or density.

Children with Sanfilippo syndrome often have an increased tolerance to pain. Bumps, bruises, or ear infections that would be painful for other children often go unnoticed in children with Sanfilippo syndrome. Some children with Sanfilippo syndrome may have a blood-clotting problem during and after surgery.

Individuals with Sanfilippo syndrome are born within normal physiological ranges. At around age 2, individuals with Sanfilippo syndrome are significantly taller than children without the condition. By the age of 4, mostly male children with Sanfilippo syndrome were still taller than unaffected children. Growth velocity decelerates dramatically after the age of 5, and by the time children with Sanfilippo syndrome reach 17, all individuals are significantly shorter than their reference groups.

It is difficult to clinically distinguish symptomatic differences among the four types of Sanfilippo syndrome, although each of the types can vary in severity. Type A is usually the most severe subtype, characterized by the earliest onset, rapid clinical progression with severe symptoms, and short survival, with patients averaging between 15 and 18 years old. Type B is considered slightly less aggressive than type A, but still displays rapid clinical progression and short survival, with patients averaging between 17 and 19 years old. Type C is considered the least aggressive form of Sanfilippo syndrome, with patients&#x27; average life expectancy between 19 and 34 years of age, depending on the study. Type D is a rare subtype of Sanfilippo syndrome, and no data has been published on average life expectancy.

==Genetics==
Mutations in four different genes can lead to Sanfilippo syndrome. Each gene codes for a specific enzyme responsible for the breakdown of heparan sulfate. This disorder is inherited in an autosomal recessive pattern meaning a person must have two copies of the mutated gene (one from each parent) to develop the disorder. People with two working copies of the gene are unaffected. People with one working copy are genetic carriers of Sanfilippo syndrome and do not show symptoms, but they may pass down the affected gene to their children. People with two affected copies will suffer from Sanfilippo syndrome.

Risk factors for the Sanfilippo Syndrome are a family history of MPS disease(s), individuals who are from regions that have a high incidence of Sanfilippo syndrome, and individuals carrying the defective allele(s), as stated above.

Sanfilippo syndrome can also appear as a 5th mutation, type E. This mutation results from a deficiency in the N-glucosamine 3-O-sulfatase, ARSG, gene. Although it has been characterized on a molecular level and seen within dogs and mouse models, the genetic mutation has not been seen to manifest in humans.

==Mechanism==

Symptoms due to Sanfilippo Syndrome arise because the body cannot break down a type of sugar chain called heparan sulfate. These chains of sugar molecules, known as glycosaminoglycans or GAGs, are found in different parts of cells and tissues, such as the extracellular matrix and the cell membrane, or stored in the secretory granules (which are small particles inside cells). Normally, special enzymes found in lysosomes, the cell&#x27;s recycling centers, break down these sugar chains. These degrading enzymes include glycosidases, sulfatases, and acetyltransferases and a deficiency or absence in any one of these enzymes can lead to improper breakdown of heparan sulfate. The sugar chains buildup in the cell&#x27;s lysosomes eventually causing cell damage, dysfunction, and death; how it works is not fully understood. Heparan sulfate may also accumulate outside of cells or be excreted in urine. The build up of these sugar molecules can occur in the brain, spinal cord, and connective tissue of various organ systems which are what led to the range of symptoms associated with Sanfilippo syndrome.

The Sanfilippo Syndrome is associated with a wide range of symptoms is due to the protein heparan sulfate is attached to, heparan sulfate proteoglycans (HSPGs). HSPGs are key players in various signaling pathways, controls neural progenitor proliferation, and other essential processes within the CNS.

==Diagnosis==

Sanfilippo syndrome types A, B, C, and D are considered to be clinically indistinguishable, although mutations in different genes are responsible for each disease. Another subtype has been identified, but it has only been found in mice. The following discussion is therefore applicable to all four conditions. Thus, there are two main ways that can be used to confirm if an individual has Sanfilippo syndrome: a urinalysis and genetic testing.

A urinalysis can show elevated levels of heparan sulfate in the urine. All four types of Sanfilippo syndrome show increased levels of GAGs in the urine, so there is no distinction between the Sanfilippo syndrome subtypes based on a urinalysis alone; however, in MPS IIIA and IIIB patients, the plasma and CSF were also found to be elevated. Additionally, urinary GAG levels are higher in infants and toddlers than in older children. In order to avoid a false negative urine test due to dilution, it is important that a urine sample be taken first thing in the morning. The diagnosis may be confirmed by enzyme assay of skin fibroblasts and white blood cells, as well as gene sequencing. Through gene sequencing, known genetic defects can be detected in order to identify the disease. Aside from confirming diagnosis, genetic testing is also recommended to determine carriers and to understand development of the disease.

There are various stages in a child&#x27;s life in which they can be diagnosed with Sanfilippo syndrome. Diagnosing a child prior to presentation of symptoms is integral for experimental treatments to be beneficial. Prenatal diagnosis is possible by chorionic villus sampling or amniocentesis. Newborn diagnosis is also a possibility; however, no country has mandated testing for this specific disease. Testing for newborns includes examining their blood to locate the mutation. Although there is no current standard, largely due to economical reasons, a whole genome sequencing may prove to be beneficial in the future. This method can shorten the route for accurate diagnosis, which can ultimate help the individual and their families.

A diagnosis of Sanfilippo syndrome should be considered by providers if a child presents with symptoms associated with other disorders such as behavioral or attention deficit disorders or autism spectrum disorder as there is overlap of behaviors with these conditions. Diagnosing individuals with Sanfilippo syndrome can be challenging because of the rarity of the disease and variability of the presentation in early symptoms and an accurate diagnosis may take years. Due to the neurological symptoms presented in Sanfilippo syndrome, misdiagnoses can occur, such as developmental delays, attention deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), or autism spectrum disorder (ASD) diagnoses being made. Moreover, other medical conditions that present with physical symptoms such as juvenile idiopathic arthritis or behavioral issues such as Landau — Kleffner syndrome can be mistaken for the disease and prevent early diagnosis of Sanfilippo. Additionally, screening for Sanfilippo syndrome is not a routine procedure, which can also delay a proper diagnosis to have the best possible management.

Once a diagnosis has been made, it is important that children are monitored and seen regularly by their healthcare provider to assess the progression of disease, decline of normal function, and to identify other health issues associated with Sanfilippo syndrome such as cardiac, musculoskeletal, and gastrointestinal problems. Testing to monitor disease progression includes magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), x-rays, electroencephalography (EEG), electrocardiogram (ECG), and abdominal imaging. These tests are more specifically used to determine the source of neurological pain, cognitive and behavioral changes, physical symptoms of pain, cardiac abnormalities, and symptoms of gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD). Examples of routine monitoring includes physical, eye, ear, nutritional, and dental exams.

== Treatment ==
While treatment remains largely supportive, research advancements are being made in the fields of pharmacology, stem cell, and genetics to address the disease. Currently, there is no cure for any subtype of Sanfilippo syndrome.

Supportive therapies to manage Sanfilippo syndrome include the use of medications, physical therapy, medical equipment, surgery, and occupational therapy to treat behavioral and cognitive delays, musculoskeletal damage, and to improve overall quality of life. Evidence for medications that effectively manage behavioral problems and seizures in children with Sanfilippo syndrome are limited. Occupational and physical therapy can assist children with any movement restrictions. Staying up to date with vaccines against pneumococcal disease is also recommended due to the increased risk of contracting respiratory infections. Surgical interventions can be used to minimize ear infections, scoliosis, and other complications that occur during the disease progression. Due to the disease&#x27;s impact on different organs and systems, healthcare professionals from various fields are involved and integral in managing the child&#x27;s symptoms.

Pharmacological interventions for the management of symptoms associated with Sanfilippo syndrome vary depending on the affected organ system. These may include gastrointestinal medications, antibiotics, anticholinergics, melatonin for sleep disorders, or neurological medications to help modify behaviors or control seizures. It is important to note that behavioral disturbances of Sanfilippo syndrome may vary in response to medication, as each individual may react differently to the medications that are intended to treat the individual&#x27;s mental state. However, medication usage can still be pursued to treat an individual&#x27;s symptoms instead of managing Sanfilippo syndrome to improve their quality of life.

If an early diagnosis is made, bone marrow replacement may be beneficial. Patients that underwent bone marrow transplant before the age of two showed neurocognitive function stabilization. Although the missing enzyme can be manufactured and given intravenously (also known as enzyme replacement therapy) to help treat other non-neurological lysosomal storage diseases and Sanfilippo syndrome with minor neurological impacts, it cannot penetrate the blood–brain barrier and therefore cannot treat the moderate to severe neurological manifestations of MPS-III. Along with many other lysosomal storage diseases, MPS-III exists as a model of a monogenetic disease involving the central nervous system.

Gene therapy in particular is under Phase I/II clinical trial in France since October 2011 under the leadership of Paris-based biotechnology company Lysogene. Other potential therapies include chemical modification of deficient enzymes to allow them to penetrate the blood–brain barrier, stabilization of abnormal but active enzyme to prevent its degradation, and implantation of stem cells strongly expressing the missing enzyme. For any future treatment to be successful, it must be administered as early as possible. Currently, MPS-III is mainly diagnosed clinically, by which stage it is probably too late for any treatment to be very effective. Neonatal screening programs would provide the earliest possible diagnosis.

Another treatment currently being studied is enzyme replacement therapy, which works by replacing the enzyme that is not present or deficient by infusing the enzyme into the body. However, a challenge of this treatment option is that the enzymes being replaced do not have the ability to cross the blood-brain barrier, one of the places sulfate heparan accumulates. Additionally, antibodies that can break down the added enzyme are present in individuals with Sanfilippo syndrome, which can reduce the efficacy of enzyme replacement therapy. In studies, injection of the enzyme sulfamidase into the brain or cerebrospinal fluid of mice has been shown to reduce symptoms of the Sanfilippo Syndrome. Interestingly, injecting sulfamidase in places outside the CNS has not shown to be as effective.

Substrate reduction therapy (SRT) is also currently being studied to treat Sanfilippo syndrome. Since Sanfilippo syndrome occurs due to the body&#x27;s inability to break down GAGs, SRT functions by targeting the genes responsible for the synthesis of GAGs to restore the balance of production and breakdown of GAGs. While this therapy is innovative, the technology to deliver the therapy to ensure effectiveness is not yet available. A part of SRT, genistein is also believed to play a role in reducing GAG synthesis in cells by blocking hormones that are responsible for enhancing GAG production. The safety of oral genistein has been confirmed in clinical trials with children; however, results on its effectiveness are inconclusive. One clinical trial showed reduction of heparan sulfate but no clinical benefit, while another trial showed behavioral improvement due to reduction in heparan sulfate and neuroinflammation. There is currently one clinical trial ongoing on genistein therapy.

Several support and research groups have been established to speed the development of new treatments for Sanfilippo syndrome.

==Prognosis==
According to a study of people with Sanfilippo syndrome, the median life expectancy varies depending on the subtype. In Sanfilippo syndrome type A, the mean age at death (± standard deviation) was 15.22 ± 4.22 years; for Type B, it was 18.91 ± 7.33 years; and, for Type C, it was 23.43 ± 9.47 years. The mean life expectancy for Type A has increased since the 1970s. In severe cases of Sanfilippo syndrome, less than twenty percent of people survive past 20 years of age.

==Epidemiology==

It is estimated that approximately 1 in 70,000 newborns are born with Sanfilippo syndrome. The point prevalence (the proportion of people in a population that has the trait at a given point of time) can vary from 1 to 9 in 1,000,000 people. Sanfilippo syndrome varies geographically, with approximately 1 case per 280,000 live births in Northern Ireland, 1 per 66,000 in Australia, and 1 per 50,000 in the Netherlands. Globally, there are an estimated 12,000 to 19,000 individuals living with types A, B, and C. Subtypes A and B are predominately found in Europe, with subtype A specific to the northern region and subtype B specific to the southern region.

Studies were performed across several countries assessing the mean age of diagnosis for each type of Sanfilippo syndrome. For patients with Sanfilippo syndrome type A, mean age at diagnosis was found to between 3.5 and 4.9 years of age. For patients with Sanfilippo syndrome type B, mean age at diagnosis was found to be between 3.5 and 4.9 years of age. For patients with Sanfilippo syndrome type C, mean age at diagnosis was found to be between 4.5 and 19 years of age. For patients with Sanfilippo syndrome type D, mean age at diagnosis was found to be between 8.2 and 8.3 years of age.

Worldwide, Sanfilippo syndrome Type A and B affects the most people with Types C and D seen less commonly; however, the actual number of persons affected may be more than reported due to incorrect or delayed diagnosis of the disorder. An Australian study estimated the following incidences for each subtype of Sanfilippo syndrome in the Australian population:

Over 50% of individual with Sanfilippo syndrome type A&#x27;s die from pneumonia. The remaining causes of death for type A are spread out between cardiorespiratory failure, gastrointestinal complications, central nervous system complications, and other. Pneumonia is also the primary cause of death for Sanfilippo syndrome type B. Over 30% of individuals with Sanfilippo syndrome type B die from pneumonia. The remaining causes of death for type B are spread out between cardiorespiratory failure, gastrointestinal complications and other. Due to the rarity of Sanfilippo syndrome type C and D, not enough data was collected to estimate mortality rates.

==History==
The condition is named after Sylvester Sanfilippo, the pediatrician who first described the disease in 1963.

== Society and culture ==
The economic burden of Sanfilippo syndrome worldwide has not been studied; however new research shows the disease&#x27;s impact in monetary and disability-adjusted life year (DALYs) terms in the United States. DALYs stands for &quot;disability-adjusted life years&quot; and the article describes it as &quot;...years of life lost from early death and the years lived with a disability or ill-health, compared to a typical healthy life.&quot; The disease is estimated to cost the U.S. $1.55 billion in the next twenty years, and due to the heavy burden caregivers of children with Sanfilippo syndrome carry, they were estimated to lose an average of 2.08 DALYs (father) or 4.08 DALYs (mother), with an economical loss of $4.54 million and $5.61 million DALYs. A child diagnosed with the disease loses 53 (male) or 58 DALYs (female).

==Caregiver impact==
Caregivers for children with Sanfilippo syndrome face a unique set of challenges because of the disease&#x27;s complex nature. There is little understanding among clinicians of the family experience of caring for patients with Sanfilippo and how a caregiver&#x27;s experiences change and evolve as patients age. The burden and impact on caregivers&#x27; quality of life is poorly defined and best-practice guidance for clinicians is lacking; however, quantitative data revealed that parents of children with Sanfilippo syndrome have reported they would like to see therapies that target both behavioral issues such as lack of communication, hyperactivity, and frustration, as well as physical symptoms such as motor and sleep issues. They believe these types of treatments would greatly reduce the burden for both parties. Parents also specified their willingness to try experimental treatments, but were disappointed that most clinical trials limited access to younger children with less disease progression.

A best-practice guidance to help clinicians understand the challenges caregivers face was published July 2019 in the Orphanet Journal of Rare Diseases by a group of international clinical advisors with expertise in the care of pediatric patients with Sanfilippo, lysosomal storage disorders, and life as a caregiver to a child with Sanfilippo.

The group reviewed key aspects of caregiver burden associated with Sanfilippo B by identifying and quantifying the nature and impact of the disease on patients and caregivers. Recommendations were based on findings from qualitative and quantitative research.

The article&#x27;s authors reported that: &quot;Providing care for patients with Sanfilippo B impinges on all aspects of family life, evolving as the patient ages and the disease progresses. Important factors contributing toward caregiver burden include sleep disturbances, impulsive and hyperactive behavior, and communication difficulties...Caregiver burden remained high throughout the life of the patient and, coupled with the physical burden of daily care, had a cumulative impact that generated significant psychological stress.&quot;

Additionally, the authors call for changing the narrative associated with Sanfilippo: &quot;The panel agreed that the perceived aggressive behavior of the child may be better described as &#x27;physical impulsiveness&#x27; and is often misunderstood by the general public. Importantly, the lack of intentionality of the child&#x27;s behavior is recognized and shared by parents and panel members...Parents may seek to protect their child from public scrutiny and avoid situations that many engender criticism of their parenting skills.&quot;

<text>Eversholt is a village and civil parish located in Bedfordshire, England. It was mentioned in the Domesday Book and is over 1000 years old. &quot;Eversholt&quot; comes from Anglo-Saxon meaning &quot;wood of the wild boar&quot;.

== Overview ==
For many years, most of the land in the village was owned by the Dukes of Bedford, and most of the inhabitants worked on the Bedford estate. The estate still forms an important, although lesser, part of village life.

Most of the land is used for agriculture. There are about a dozen small businesses operating in converted farm buildings. The current population is about 420. The last shop in the village closed in 1994.

The Church of Saint John the Baptist was originally built at the centre of the village in the twelfth century, and is still used regularly. There is a modern village hall (a replacement for the old Reading Room which burned down in 1984), a tennis court, a pond built by the residents themselves, an open-air swimming pool, and a pub, the Green Man (owned by Candice Brown, 2016 champion of The Great British Bake Off). Eversholt Cricket Club plays matches every week in summer. Eversholt Lower School educates children from five to nine years old, and has around 80 pupils from the village and surrounding areas. At age nine (the end of Year 4) children transfer to Parkfields Middle School in nearby Toddington.

There is a school for children from four to nine years old, with about 70 pupils from the village and surrounding area.

The cricket ground was, for many years, one of the only grounds in the world to have trees in the playing field - there were two. Local rules dictated that a ball hitting any part of a tree was dead and two runs were awarded. A copper beech at the Pavilion end of the ground was declared diseased and taken down in 1987 and a beech tree at the Village Hall end fell in October 2002, just a few weeks before it was due to be cut down. It fell whilst small children were playing at a Sunday football club, but none were harmed. The tree was then made into wood chips for the local school playground, various wooden objects such as bowls which were auctioned for charity, and a bench was made for the pond area.

The Millennium Pond, built in 2000 was transformed from an old field. It is now an area of woodland and plants containing a large pond connected to a stream. The residents built this themselves, and many organisations donated plants or trees, including the school.

The Eversholt Village Charity has been operating for at least 200 years. It owns properties in the village, and distributes income annually to students, to pensioners, and to the church.

==Transport==
Ridgmont railway station is the nearest train station to the village and can be reached via frequent bus services.

==Notable residents==
*E. W. Royce (1841–1926), actor and dancer at the Gaiety Theatre was born here.

<doc id="817161" wikidata="Q7786801" url="?curid=817161" title="Thomas-Everard family">
<text>The Thomas-Everard family are a family of British farmers who became known to the public during the 2001 foot and mouth crisis. The son Guy Thomas-Everard made an impassioned plea against his healthy farm animals being killed as part of a pre-emptive cull designed by the Ministry for Agriculture, Fisheries and Food (MAFF) to save Exmoor animals from foot and mouth disease. The plea and threatened legal challenge was ultimately successful.

The case saw the Thomas-Everard family enter politics, campaigning on rural affairs. The father, Chris Thomas-Everard, is a leading member of the Countryside Party. He stood as the first candidate for the party in the South West England region at the 2004 European election. Thomas-Everard failed to get a seat in the European Parliament, though the party did retain its deposit in the region.

On 7 May 2001 MAFF decided to kill the animals at two farms between Bridgetown and Dulverton because a farm worker on one of the farms had come into contact with the disease at other farms near Taunton. If the two farms became infected they were expected by MAFF officials to act as a &quot;gateway&quot; for the disease to spread from there to the rest of Exmoor. However, vets examined the animals on Thomas-Everard&#x27;s farm and were happy that they were uninfected. Initially MAFF decided to go ahead with the cull regardless. Thomas-Everard was furious. In an interview with the BBC he said

:&quot;All we can do is to try and make MAFF see sense. And stop trying to blackmail us, and stop this bloody nonsense of saying all our neighbours want us culled. It&#x27;s a bloody lie!&quot;

He blocked the entrance to the farm with a truck and said that he had instructed lawyers to prevent MAFF carrying out the cull. On 10 May, following intensive media coverage, MAFF announced that the risk of contraction of disease at the farm had been re-assessed and downgraded. Thus the cull was not carried out.

Guy Thomas-Everard joined a group of farmers, businessmen and media organisations who brought an unsuccessful legal challenge to the government&#x27;s decision not to hold a public inquiry into the foot and mouth crisis. The Government held three inquiries all of which published its findings publicly, but gathered their information in private.

<doc id="817165" wikidata="Q967779" url="?curid=817165" title="Lance Berkman">
<text>William Lance Berkman (born February 10, 1976), nicknamed &quot;Fat Elvis&quot; and &quot;Big Puma&quot;, is an American baseball coach and former professional baseball outfielder and first baseman, who is the former head baseball coach of the Houston Christian Huskies. He played 15 seasons in Major League Baseball (MLB) for the Houston Astros, New York Yankees, St. Louis Cardinals and Texas Rangers. Berkman is a six-time MLB All-Star and won a World Series championship and the National League Comeback Player of the Year Award with the Cardinals in 2011. He stands , and weighs . Berkman spent various seasons of his career as a regular at all three outfield positions.

A standout baseball player at Canyon High School, Berkman attended Rice University, where he played college baseball for the Owls. The Astros selected Berkman in the first round of 1997&#x27;s amateur draft, and he debuted in the major leagues in 1999. He joined the Astros&#x27; vaunted &quot;Killer B&#x27;s&quot; lineup that included Jeff Bagwell and Craig Biggio as all three players were instrumental in the club&#x27;s playoff success. The Astros traded Berkman to the Yankees at the 2010 trade deadline. He signed with the Cardinals as a free agent for the 2011 and 2012 seasons. Berkman played a key part in the Cardinals winning the 2011 World Series, hitting a game-tying single in the bottom of the tenth inning of Game 6, with the Cardinals just one strike away from elimination. He played the 2013 season with the Rangers before signing a one-day contract with Houston to officially retire as an Astro. In fifteen seasons of baseball, he had an Adjusted On-base plus slugging (OPS)+ at 150 or above six times (the baseline average is 100) while having 100 walks in a seasons three times and 100 RBIs in a season six times. Among OPS leaders all-time, he is tied for 30th all-time while being 23rd among players with less than 10,000 plate appearances.

Active in charity work, &quot;Forbes&quot; recognized him on their list of &quot;30 most generous celebrities&quot; in 2012. He has led a group called &quot;Berkman&#x27;s Bunch,&quot; an outreach for 50 underprivileged kids to meet Berkman before each Saturday home game for autographs and other gifts. In 2013, he purchased a fire truck and donated it to the City of West, Texas, after the West Fertilizer Company explosion.

==Early life==
Berkman was born in Waco, Texas, the son of Cynthia Ann (née Thomas) and Larry Gene Berkman. His paternal grandfather, whose family&#x27;s surname was originally &quot;Björkman&quot;, was of Swedish descent. Berkman graduated from Canyon High School in New Braunfels, Texas, in 1994.

==College career==
Berkman then attended Rice University playing on the Owls baseball team, where he played for the legendary Wayne Graham, and was named a first team All-America by Collegiate Baseball Magazine, &quot;Baseball America&quot; and &quot;The Sporting News&quot;. He was invited to visit the White House and dined with President Clinton along with the rest of the Baseball America honorees.

Throughout college, he batted a collective .385 with 67 home runs and 272 RBI. His 41 home runs in 1997 ranked third-most in NCAA history. That year he also made the all-time record book in RBIs (2nd-134), slugging percentage (6th-1.031) and total bases (4th-263) while leading the Rice Owls to their first College World Series appearance.

In 1996, he played collegiate summer baseball with the Wareham Gatemen of the Cape Cod Baseball League (CCBL), where he won the league&#x27;s Thurman Munson Award for leading all hitters with a .352 batting average. Berkman was named to the CCBL Hall of Fame in 2023.

Berkman returned to Rice in 2014 to finish his degree.

==Professional career==
===Draft and minor leagues===
The Houston Astros of Major League Baseball (MLB) selected Berkman in the first round, with the 16th overall selection, of the 1997 MLB draft. The team assigned him to play with the Kissimmee Cobras, their Class A-Advanced affiliate, of the Florida State League. In 53 games, he hit .293 with 12 home runs and 35 RBI.

In , his second minor league season, the Astros promoted Berkman to the Jackson Generals of the Class AA Southern League. His potential was beginning to show, as he hit .306 with 24 home runs and 89 RBI over 122 games. The Astros granted him a mid-season promotion to the New Orleans Zephyrs of the Class AAA Pacific Coast League. He played 17 games in New Orleans, and 1998 would prove to be his last full season in the minor leagues. In , Berkman was midway through a great season in New Orleans when he was called up to the parent club, the Houston Astros. Prior to the promotion, he had been hitting .323 with 8 home runs and 49 RBI through 64 games.

===Houston Astros (1999–2010)===
====1999–2004: Early Astros career====
Throughout his entire high school, college, and minor league career, Berkman had almost exclusively played first base. The Astros, who called him up to the major leagues for the first time in 1999 and already had Jeff Bagwell entrenched at first, shifted Berkman to the outfield so he could regularly hit in the starting lineup. Because of his last name and reputation as a strong hitter, Berkman gained distinction as one of the Astros&#x27; &quot;Killer B&#x27;s&quot; early in his career, which included Bagwell and Craig Biggio, two formidable veteran players who helped established the club as perennial playoff contenders in the 1990s and 2000s. In fact, journalist Dayn Perry jocosely noted in 1999 that the Astros, &quot;in pursuit of arcane history, used eight players whose last names began with &#x27;B.&#x27;&quot; The eight included Bagwell, Paul Bako, Glen Barker, Derek Bell, Sean Berry, Berkman, Biggio, and Tim Bogar. After appearing in 34 games in 1999, Houston demoted Berkman to the minor leagues for more seasoning.

The demotion proved brief, however; 31 games into the 2000 season, Houston again promoted Berkman. Moving from left field to right field, he dramatically increased his offensive production by hitting .297 with 21 home runs and 67 RBI, resulting in him becoming a starter for the rest of his career in Houston. Berkman would receive a single vote in 2000 National League Rookie of the Year voting, tying him for sixth place with Juan Pierre and Chuck Smith. In 2001, Berkman hit .331, fourth in the National League (NL), posted a .430 on-base percentage (OBP) (5th in the NL), and drove in 126 runs (7th in the league). He also scored 110 runs and hit 34 home runs, while his 55 doubles led the league. 2001 also marked his first All-Star appearance (he would repeat in 2002, 2004, 2006, and 2008) and he was 5th in Most Valuable Player voting.

2002 saw his batting average drop to .292, although he kept his OBP high at .405. His power output increased also, resulting in 42 home runs. Berkman scored 106 runs and drove in 128, good enough to lead the league. He made his second All-Star appearance and was third in the NL in the Most Valuable Player voting.

In 2003, Berkman&#x27;s batting average dipped to .288, but his OBP remained high at .412. He hit 25 home runs, and drove in 93 runs, scoring 110. In the field, he played every game in left field, moving to center field once. Berkman also continued his reputation for being colorful and outspoken, advocating for the use of instant replay in games. In a game against the Chicago Cubs at Wrigley Field, fans waved twinkies at Berkman during the a pitching change in the seventh inning on June 1. He responded by asking for twinkies to be thrown to his glove, and when two came to him, he proceeded to eat one of them while putting the other in his pocket. He subsequently hit a home run in the next innings earning chants of &quot;Twinkie Power&quot; when he came back to the field in the ninth.

In May 2004, Berkman produced a .785 slugging percentage with 24 RBI winning the National League Player of the Month honors for the first time in his career. Berkman made the All-Star team, his third All-Star appearance, and placed second in the 2004 Home Run Derby behind Miguel Tejada. He hit the longest home run of the tournament at . Berkman&#x27;s average for the season increased to .316 from the year before, and his OBP was .450, having walked 127 times. He hit 30 home runs, drove in 106, and scored 104 runs. He also hit 40 doubles and appeared in 160 games, the most in his career for a single season. Defensively, Berkman split 2004 between left and right field. Berkman would finish 7th in Most Valuable Player voting.

====2005–10====
Berkman signed a six-year, $85-million deal in March 2005. He moved to first base early in the 2005 season while Bagwell spent a significant portion of the season injured. Berkman ended the season with 24 home runs and 82 RBIs. He would finish tied for 14th with Bobby Abreu in NL MVP voting.

In Game 4 of the 2005 National League Division Series against the Atlanta Braves, Berkman hit a grand slam in the 8th inning. That brought the score to 6–5 in favor of the Braves, but the game was tied in the next inning on a two-out solo home run by Brad Ausmus. The teams then battled for 9 more innings in what became the longest game in Major League Baseball playoff history, with the Astros eventually winning the game (and the series) in the bottom of the 18th inning on a Chris Burke home run. Burke had replaced Berkman as a pinch runner in the 10th. In the 2005 World Series, Berkman&#x27;s first, the Astros were swept by the Chicago White Sox in four games, though Berkman compiled a .385 average with two doubles. His six RBIs during that series were the most of any of the Astros&#x27; hitters.

On Mother&#x27;s Day, May 14, 2006, Berkman was one of more than 50 hitters who brandished a pink bat to benefit the Breast Cancer Foundation. On September 13, 2006, Berkman became only the second switch hitter in Major League history to hit 40 or more homers in multiple seasons, with Mickey Mantle being the first.

During the 2006 season, Berkman hit 45 home runs and had 136 RBI. He broke the Astros&#x27; single season record for RBI, previously set by Bagwell in 1997 with 135. He also had a .315 batting average, an on-base percentage of .420, as well as a slugging percentage of .621. He also hit a career high 5 home runs from the right side of the plate. He finished third in the MVP voting behind Ryan Howard and Albert Pujols.

Berkman started the 2007 season in a bit of a slump, batting .261, well below his career average, but rebounded for a strong second half of the season. Berkman finished the 2007 season with a .278 batting average, 34 home runs and 102 RBIs, along with 7 stolen bases.

Berkman started the 2008 season batting well above .385 through April, won the NL Player of the Month in May and two separate Player of the Week awards, one which he went 29–32 (batted .906) with 6 home runs, including a McCovey Cove splash landing. At the All-Star break, he was in the NL&#x27;s top four in batting average, with 22 home runs, and was on pace for 130+ RBIs. However, despite the rest of the team picking up steam behind the likes of Roy Oswalt, Wandy Rodríguez, Hunter Pence, and Ty Wigginton&#x27;s rebound second half, Berkman&#x27;s individual performance dipped significantly, and by season&#x27;s end, he batted .312, with 29 home runs (7 of which were right-handed, setting a new career high), 106 RBI, and an NL-leading 46 doubles. Berkman was fifth in the voting for the 2008 NL MVP award, behind Albert Pujols, Ryan Howard, Ryan Braun, and Manny Ramirez.

Berkman hit his 300th home run against Arizona Diamondbacks starter Jon Garland on June 13, 2009.

===New York Yankees (2010)===

On July 31, 2010, Berkman was traded to the New York Yankees for minor leaguers Jimmy Paredes and Mark Melancon. He served as both a designated hitter and backup first baseman during his tenure with New York. During the 2010 ALCS, Berkman served first base for the rest of the post-season when Mark Teixeira went on the disabled list due to a hamstring injury. The Yankees eventually lost the ALCS to the Texas Rangers in 6 games.

The Yankees announced on October 27 that the club declined to exercise their option for Berkman for 2011.

===St. Louis Cardinals (2011–2012)===

====2011 season: Comeback and World Series championship====
Berkman was under contract with the Cardinals for the 2011 and 2012 seasons. An advertisement was made of him because he was unable to wear no. 17, and many other numbers, as they were all retired.

On July 5, 2011, Berkman hit his 350th career home run, and his long-ball was the second farthest home run ever hit in the new Busch Stadium.

2011 became a comeback year for Berkman, as he was one of the team leaders in batting average, home runs and RBI. He was named the NL Comeback Player of the Year. Berkman would also finish 7th in NL MVP voting, the sixth and final time he would finish inside the top ten in MVP voting.
Berkman made key contributions in Game 6 of the 2011 World Series against the Texas Rangers. He hit his first home run in a World Series game in the first inning and in the ninth, with St. Louis down to their final strike before elimination, Berkman was driven home followed by Albert Pujols after a game-tying 2-run triple by David Freese. After Texas scored two runs in the top of the tenth and Ryan Theriot hit a run-scoring groundout, Berkman hit a two-out two-strike RBI single scoring Jon Jay to tie the game. Berkman won his first World Series championship as the Cardinals defeated the Texas Rangers in the series in 7 games.

====2012 season====
On April 22, 2012, Berkman was placed on the disabled list due to a calf injury. On May 21, 2012, Berkman was again placed on the disabled list due to right knee injury. An MRI revealed that there was significant cartilage damage to both sides of the knee and a torn meniscus, requiring arthroscopic surgery. Berkman returned on July 14, 2012. He was then placed on the 15-day disabled list on August 3, 2012 due to knee inflammation. It was the third time Berkman went on the DL in the 2012 season. On September 10, 2012, he was again put on the disabled list after having to go for a secondary meniscus surgery in the same knee. On October, 3rd, 2012, Berkman had his last at bat as a Cardinal. He spent the 2012 postseason on the physically unable to perform list as the Cardinals won the 2012 NLDS against the Washington Nationals but lost the 2012 NLCS against the San Francisco Giants.

===Texas Rangers===

On January 5, 2013, Berkman agreed to a one-year contract with the Texas Rangers for approximately $10 million. In 73 games, Berkman hit .242 with six home runs and 34 RBIs in 256 at bats. On October 31, the Rangers declined his option, which made him a free agent. On January 29, 2014, he decided to retire. Berkman, along with former teammate Roy Oswalt signed a one-day contract with Houston to officially retire as a member of the Astros on April 5, 2014.

===Career statistics===
In 1,879 games over 15 seasons, Berkman posted a .293 batting average (1,905-for-6,491) with 1,146 runs, 422 doubles, 30 triples, 366 home runs, 1,234 RBI, 86 stolen bases, 1,201 bases on balls, .406 on-base percentage and .537 slugging percentage. He finished his career with a .991 fielding percentage playing at all three outfield positions and first base. In 52 postseason games, he hit .317 (59-for-186) with 38 runs, 11 doubles, 1 triple, 9 home runs, 41 RBI and 31 walks.

==Coaching career==
In 2009, Berkman stated that after his major league career he would like to coach baseball at the University of Texas at Austin even though he attended Rice University. Since he didn&#x27;t finish his degree at Rice, he would need to return to school and complete three more semesters to earn a business degree with a minor in sports management. He hypothesized then that &quot;I know [Texas Coach Augie] Garrido&#x27;s going to coach four or five more years. I figured that might dovetail nicely with the end of my career.&quot; With Berkman&#x27;s retirement in 2014, however, it is at his alma mater, Rice, that the former Owl has spent time assisting young hitters. Rice coach Wayne Graham has made it clear that Rice would be interested, stating that &quot;[i]t sounds like he wants to coach. Hopefully at one time or another it will be here. We’ll manage to always find a place for him.&quot;

As of 2015, Berkman is serving as the head baseball coach at Second Baptist School in Houston, Texas, along with his former Astros teammate Andy Pettitte serving as assistant coach. Berkman and Pettitte led Second Baptist to a Tapps State Title in 2016.

Berkman was eligible for the Baseball Hall of Fame in 2019. He received 5 votes, or 1.4%, which is less than 5% threshold and became thus ineligible for further consideration.

He was an assistant manager for the University of St. Thomas baseball team during the 2021 season.

On May 31, 2021, Berkman was named the head baseball coach of the Houston Christian Huskies.

On May 24, 2024, Berkman announced he was stepping down from his head coaching position at HCU.

==Personal life==
Berkman and his wife, Cara, live in Houston with their four daughters. Berkman has been very outspoken about his Christian beliefs throughout his career. Berkman uses his position as a professional athlete to discuss his religious beliefs with others. He told The 700 Club in May 2007: &quot;What you’re running after, what you’re trying to find will not provide you with any lasting fulfillment. The only place you can find that is Jesus Christ. It&#x27;s in the service of God you’ll find that lasting fulfillment.&quot;

In 2001, Berkman began leading a charity called &quot;Berkman&#x27;s Bunch&quot; where 50 underprivileged kids could meet Berkman before each Saturday home game for autographs and other gifts. In April 2012, Forbes named Berkman one of the 30 most generous celebrities as he and his wife had donated $2,412,245 to a foundation they established called To The Lord&#x27;s Fund.

In July 2013, Berkman purchased a fire truck and had it overhauled by the City of Arlington. He then donated it to the City of West, Texas, in the wake of the West Fertilizer Company explosion that took place earlier in the year. The fire truck is white with a red Maltese cross on the doors and the name Berkman over the cross with his number &quot;17&quot; encircled within the cross.

Berkman filmed an advertisement against the Houston Equal Rights Ordinance, which was aimed at protecting LGBT individuals from discrimination. The ordinance sought to ban discrimination on a variety of levels, including sex, race, color, ethnicity and other classifications. Despite the wording of the ordinance, HERO&#x27;s opponents including Berkman, instead honed in on the sexual orientation and gender identity protections. Berkman took to the airwaves to repeat a popular stance of HERO’s critics, arguing that the law would allow male predators dressed in drag to enter women’s bathrooms, rather than open public accommodations to transgender people. Berkman’s appearance garnered criticism from many, including former Minnesota Vikings punter Chris Kluwe. The controversy flared when Houston Mayor Annise Parker stated of Berkman, &quot;That someone who made his name in our city would inject himself into this debate by taking to the airwaves to discredit an effort to ban discrimination in all forms did upset me. This ordinance protects all Houstonians and his remarks diminished it to something trivial.&quot; The ordinance was rejected by Houston voters in a ballot initiative in November 2015.

==Nicknames==
He is most popularly known as &quot;Fat Elvis&quot; and &quot;The Big Puma.&quot; Before the 2006 season started, in an interview with a local Houston sports radio station, Lance joked &quot;I&#x27;m more like a puma so I&#x27;m not sure why people call me Fat Elvis.&quot; The show&#x27;s hosts, John Granato and Lance Zierlein, ran with the moniker and Houston fans and media latched onto &quot;The Big Puma.&quot; When questioned further, Berkman explained the nickname is simply logical. &quot;Agile, athletic, sleek ... all the things that describe my game&quot;, he said, somewhat tongue-in-cheek. With his outstanding start in 2008, this nickname also became known on a national level. That same year, a Lance Berkman fan club calling themselves &quot;The Little Pumas&quot; emerged. During Berkman&#x27;s long tenure with the Astros, they could be seen wearing puma costumes and foam puma paws at most Astros home games near the Conoco Pump in left-center field. The group became relatively well-known among Astros fans, as they were shown often during Astros broadcasts on Fox Sports Houston.

Berkman was also one of the Astros&#x27; &quot;Killer B&#x27;s&quot; in the mid-2000s, along with Jeff Bagwell, Craig Biggio, and Derek Bell.

<text>Biological dispersal refers to both the movement of individuals (animals, plants, fungi, bacteria, etc.) from their birth site to their breeding site (&#x27;natal dispersal&#x27;) and the movement from one breeding site to another (&#x27;breeding dispersal&#x27;).
Dispersal is also used to describe the movement of propagules such as seeds and spores.
Technically, dispersal is defined as any movement that has the potential to lead to gene flow. 
The act of dispersal involves three phases: departure, transfer, and settlement. There are different fitness costs and benefits associated with each of these phases.
Through simply moving from one habitat patch to another, the dispersal of an individual has consequences not only for individual fitness, but also for population dynamics, population genetics, and species distribution. Understanding dispersal and the consequences, both for evolutionary strategies at a species level and for processes at an ecosystem level, requires understanding on the type of dispersal, the dispersal range of a given species, and the dispersal mechanisms involved. Biological dispersal can be correlated to population density. The range of variations of a species&#x27; location determines the expansion range.

Biological dispersal may be contrasted with geodispersal, which is the mixing of previously isolated populations (or whole biotas) following the erosion of geographic barriers to dispersal or gene flow.

Dispersal can be distinguished from animal migration (typically round-trip seasonal movement), although within population genetics, the terms &#x27;migration&#x27; and &#x27;dispersal&#x27; are often used interchangeably.

Furthermore, biological dispersal is impacted and limited by different environmental and individual conditions. This leads to a wide range of consequences on the organisms present in the environment and their ability to adapt their dispersal methods to that environment.

== Types of dispersal ==

Some organisms are motile throughout their lives, but others are adapted to move or be moved at precise, limited phases of their life cycles. This is commonly called the dispersive phase of the life cycle. The strategies of organisms&#x27; entire life cycles often are predicated on the nature and circumstances of their dispersive phases.

In general, there are two basic types:

; Passive Dispersal (Density-Independent Dispersal)
: In passive dispersal, the organisms cannot move on their own but use other methods to achieve successful reproduction or facilitation into new habitats. Organisms have evolved adaptations for dispersal that take advantage of various forms of kinetic energy occurring naturally in the environment. This can be done by taking advantage of water, wind, or an animal that is able to perform active dispersal themselves. Some organisms are capable of movement while in their larval phase. This is common amongst some invertebrates, fish, insects and sessile organisms such as plants) that depend on animal vectors, wind, gravity or current for dispersal.
: Some invertebrates, like sea sponges and corals, pass gametes through water. In this way, they are able to successfully reproduce because the sperm move around, while the eggs are moved by currents. Plants act in similar ways as they can also use water currents, winds, or moving animals to transport their gametes. Seeds, spores, and fruits can have certain adaptations that aid in facilitation of movement. 
; Active Dispersal (Density-Dependent Dispersal)
: In active dispersal, an organism will move locations by its own inherit capabilities. Age is not a restriction, as location change is common in both young and adult animals. The extent of dispersion is dependent on multiple factors, such as local population, resource competition, habitat quality, and habitat size. Due to this, many consider active dispersal to also be density-dependent, as density of the community plays a major role in the movement of animals. However, the effect is observed in age groups differently, which results in diverse levels of dispersion.
: When it comes to active dispersal, animals that are capable of free movement over large distances are ideal, achieved through flying, swimming, or walking. Nonetheless, there are restrictions enforced by geographical location and habitat. Walking animals are at the biggest disadvantage when it comes to this, as they can be prone to being stopped by potential barriers. Although some terrestrial animals traveling by foot can travel great distances, walking uses more energy in comparison to flying or swimming, especially when passing through adverse conditions. 

Due to population density, dispersal may relieve pressure for resources in an ecosystem, and competition for these resources may be a selection factor for dispersal mechanisms. Dispersal of organisms is a critical process for understanding both geographic isolation in evolution through gene flow and the broad patterns of current geographic distributions (biogeography).

A distinction is often made between natal dispersal where an individual (often a juvenile) moves away from the place it was born, and breeding dispersal where an individual (often an adult) moves away from one breeding location to breed elsewhere.

==Costs and benefits ==
In the broadest sense, dispersal occurs when the fitness benefits of moving outweigh the costs.

There are a number of benefits to dispersal such as locating new resources, escaping unfavorable conditions, avoiding competing with siblings, and avoiding breeding with closely related individuals which could lead to inbreeding depression.

There are also a number of costs associated with dispersal, which can be thought of in terms of four main currencies: energy, risk, time, and opportunity.
Energetic costs include the extra energy required to move as well as energetic investment in movement machinery (e.g. wings). Risks include increased injury and mortality during dispersal and the possibility of settling in an unfavorable environment.
Time spent dispersing is time that often cannot be spent on other activities such as growth and reproduction.
Finally, dispersal can also lead to outbreeding depression if an individual is better adapted to its natal environment than the one it ends up in. In social animals (such as many birds and mammals) a dispersing individual must find and join a new group, which can lead to loss of social rank.

== Dispersal range ==

&quot;Dispersal range&quot; refers to the distance a species can move from an existing population or the parent organism. An ecosystem depends critically on the ability of individuals and populations to disperse from one habitat patch to another. Therefore, biological dispersal is critical to the stability of ecosystems.

=== Urban Environments and Dispersal Range ===
Urban areas can be seen to have their own unique effects on the dispersal range and dispersal abilities of different organisms. For plant species, urban environments largely provide novel dispersal vectors. While animals and physical factors (i.e. wind, water, etc.) have played a role in dispersal for centuries, motor vehicles have recently been considered as major dispersal vectors. Tunnels that connect rural and urban environments have been shown to expedite a large amount of and diverse set of seeds from urban to rural environments. This could lead to possible sources of invasive species on the urban-rural gradient. Another example of the effects of urbanization could be seen next to rivers. Urbanization has led to the introduction of different invasive species through direct planting or wind dispersal. In turn, rivers next to these invasive plant species have become vital dispersal vectors. Rivers could be seen to connect urban centers to rural and natural environments. Seeds from the invasive species were shown to be transported by the rivers to natural areas located downstream, thus building upon the already established dispersal distance of the plant.

In contrast, urban environments can also provide limitations for certain dispersal strategies. Human influence through urbanization greatly affects the layout of landscapes, which leads to the limitation of dispersal strategies for many organisms. These changes have largely been exhibited through pollinator-flowering plant relationships. As the pollinator&#x27;s optimal range of survival is limited, it leads to a limited supply of pollination sites. Subsequently, this leads to less gene flow between distantly separated populations, in turn decreasing the genetic diversity of each of the areas. Likewise, urbanization has been shown to impact the gene flow of distinctly different species (ex. mice and bats) in similar ways. While these two species may have different ecological niches and living strategies, urbanization limits the dispersal strategies of both species. This leads to genetic isolation of both populations, resulting in limited gene flow. While the urbanization did have a greater effect on mice dispersal, it also led to a slight increase in inbreeding among bat populations.

=== Environmental constraints ===

Few species are ever evenly or randomly distributed within or across landscapes. In general, species significantly vary across the landscape in association with environmental features that influence their reproductive success and population persistence. Spatial patterns in environmental features (e.g. resources) permit individuals to escape unfavorable conditions and seek out new locations. This allows the organism to &quot;test&quot; new environments for their suitability, provided they are within animal&#x27;s geographic range. In addition, the ability of a species to disperse over a gradually changing environment could enable a population to survive extreme conditions. (i.e. climate change).

As the climate changes, prey and predators have to adapt to survive. This poses a problem for many animals, for example, the Southern Rockhopper Penguins. These penguins are able to live and thrive in a variety of climates due to the penguins&#x27; phenotypic plasticity. However, they are predicted to respond by dispersal, not adaptation this time. This is explained due to their long life spans and slow microevolution. Penguins in the subantarctic have very different foraging behavior from those of subtropical waters; it would be very hard to survive by keeping up with the fast-changing climate because these behaviors took years to shape.

=== Dispersal barriers ===

A dispersal barrier may result in a dispersal range of a species much smaller than the species distribution. An artificial example is habitat fragmentation due to human land use. By contrast, natural barriers to dispersal that limit species distribution include mountain ranges and rivers. An example is the separation of the ranges of the two species of chimpanzee by the Congo River.

On the other hand, human activities may also expand the dispersal range of a species by providing new dispersal methods (e.g., ballast water from ships). Many such dispersed species become invasive, like rats or stinkbugs, but some species also have a slightly positive effect to human settlers like honeybees and earthworms.

== Dispersal mechanisms ==

Most animals are capable of locomotion and the basic mechanism of dispersal is movement from one place to another. Locomotion allows the organism to &quot;test&quot; new environments for their suitability, provided they are within the animal&#x27;s range. Movements are usually guided by inherited behaviors.

The formation of barriers to dispersal or gene flow between adjacent areas can isolate populations on either side of the emerging divide. The geographic separation and subsequent genetic isolation of portions of an ancestral population can result in allopatric speciation.

=== Plant dispersal mechanisms ===
Seed dispersal is the movement or transport of seeds away from the parent plant. Plants are limited by vegetative reproduction and consequently rely upon a variety of dispersal vectors to transport their propagules, including both abiotic and biotic vectors. Seeds can be dispersed away from the parent plant individually or collectively, as well as dispersed in both space and time. The patterns of seed dispersal are determined in large part by the specific dispersal mechanism, and this has important implications for the demographic and genetic structure of plant populations, as well as migration patterns and species interactions. There are five main modes of seed dispersal: gravity, wind, ballistic, water, and by animals.

=== Animal dispersal mechanisms ===

==== Non-motile animals ====
There are numerous animal forms that are non-motile, such as sponges, bryozoans, tunicates, sea anemones, corals, and oysters. In common, they are all either marine or aquatic. It may seem curious that plants have been so successful at stationary life on land, while animals have not, but the answer lies in the food supply. Plants produce their own food from sunlight and carbon dioxide—both generally more abundant on land than in water. Animals fixed in place must rely on the surrounding medium to bring food at least close enough to grab, and this occurs in the three-dimensional water environment, but with much less abundance in the atmosphere.

All of the marine and aquatic invertebrates whose lives are spent fixed to the bottom (more or less; anemones are capable of getting up and moving to a new location if conditions warrant) produce dispersal units. These may be specialized &quot;buds&quot;, or motile sexual reproduction products, or even a sort of alteration of generations as in certain cnidaria.

Corals provide a good example of how sedentary species achieve dispersion. Broadcast spawning corals reproduce by releasing sperm and eggs directly into the water. These release events are coordinated by the lunar phase in certain warm months, such that all corals of one or many species on a given reef will be released on the same single or several consecutive nights. The released eggs are fertilized, and the resulting zygote develops quickly into a multicellular &quot;planula&quot;. This motile stage then attempts to find a suitable substratum for settlement. Most are unsuccessful and die or are fed upon by zooplankton and bottom-dwelling predators such as anemones and other corals. However, untold millions are produced, and a few do succeed in locating spots of bare limestone, where they settle and transform by growth into a polyp. All things being favorable, the single polyp grows into a coral head by budding off new polyps to form a colony.

==== Motile animals ====

The majority of animals are motile. Motile animals can disperse themselves by their spontaneous and independent locomotive powers. For example, dispersal distances across bird species depend on their flight capabilities. On the other hand, small animals utilize the existing kinetic energies in the environment, resulting in passive movement. Dispersal by water currents is especially associated with the physically small inhabitants of marine waters known as zooplankton. The term plankton comes from the Greek, πλαγκτον, meaning &quot;wanderer&quot; or &quot;drifter&quot;.

====Dispersal by dormant stages====
Many animal species, especially freshwater invertebrates, are able to disperse by wind or by transfer with an aid of larger animals (birds, mammals or fishes) as dormant eggs, dormant embryos or, in some cases, dormant adult stages. Tardigrades, some rotifers and some copepods are able to withstand desiccation as adult dormant stages. Many other taxa (Cladocera, Bryozoa, Hydra, Copepoda and so on) can disperse as dormant eggs or embryos. Freshwater sponges usually have special dormant propagules called gemmulae for such a dispersal. Many kinds of dispersal dormant stages are able to withstand not only desiccation and low and high temperature, but also action of digestive enzymes during their transfer through digestive tracts of birds and other animals, high concentration of salts, and many kinds of toxicants. Such dormant-resistant stages made possible the long-distance dispersal from one water body to another and broad distribution ranges of many freshwater animals.

== Quantifying dispersal ==

Dispersal is most commonly quantified either in terms of rate or distance.

Dispersal rate (also called migration rate in the population genetics literature) or probability describes the probability that any individual leaves an area or, equivalently, the expected proportion of individual to leave an area.

The dispersal distance is usually described by a dispersal kernel which gives the probability distribution of the distance traveled by any individual. A number of different functions are used for dispersal kernels in theoretical models of dispersal including the negative exponential distribution, extended negative exponential distribution, normal distribution, exponential power distribution, inverse power distribution, and the two-sided power distribution. The inverse power distribution and distributions with &#x27;fat tails&#x27; representing long-distance dispersal events (called leptokurtic distributions) are thought to best match empirical dispersal data.

== Consequences of dispersal ==

Dispersal not only has costs and benefits to the dispersing individual (as mentioned above), it also has consequences at the level of the population and species on both ecological and evolutionary timescales. Organisms can be dispersed through multiple methods. Carrying through animals is especially effective as it allows traveling of far distances. Many plants depend on this to be able to go to new locations, preferably with conditions ideal for precreation and germination. With this, dispersal has major influence in the determination of population and spread of plant species.

Many populations have patchy spatial distributions where separate yet interacting sub-populations occupy discrete habitat patches (see metapopulations). Dispersing individuals move between different sub-populations which increases the overall connectivity of the metapopulation and can lower the risk of stochastic extinction. If a sub-population goes extinct by chance, it is more likely to be recolonized if the dispersal rate is high. Increased connectivity can also decrease the degree of local adaptation.

Human interference with the environment has been seen to have an effect on dispersal. Some of these occurrences have been accidents, like in the case of zebra mussels, which are indigenous to Southeast Russia. A ship had accidentally released them into the North American Great Lakes and they became a major nuisance in the area, as they began to clog water treatment and power plants. Another case of this was seen in Chinese bighead and silver carp, which were brought in with the purpose of algae control in many catfish ponds across the U.S. Unfortunately, some had managed to escape into the neighboring rivers of Mississippi, Missouri, Illinois, and Ohio, eventually causing a negative impact for the surrounding ecosystems. However, human-created habitats such as urban environments have allowed certain migrated species to become urbanophiles or synanthropes. 

Dispersal has caused changes to many species on a genetic level. A positive correlation has been seen for differentiation and diversification of certain species of spiders in the Canary Islands. These spiders were residing in archipelagos and islands. Dispersion was identified as a key factor in the rate of both occurrences. 

== Human-Mediated Dispersal ==
Human impact has had a major influence on the movement of animals through time. An environmental response occurs in due to this, as dispersal patterns are important for species to survive major changes. There are two forms of human-mediated dispersal:

; Human-Vectored Dispersal (HVD)
: In Human-Vectored Dispersal, humans directly move the organism. This can occur deliberately, like for the usage of the animal in an agricultural setting, hunting or more. However, it can also occur accidentally, if the organism attaches itself to a person or vehicle. For this process, the organism first has to come in contact with a human and then movement can start. This has become more common has the human population all over the world has increased and movement through the world has also become more prevalent. Dispersal through a human can be many times more successful in distance compared to movement by wild or other environmental means. 

; Human-Altered Dispersal (HAD)
: Human-Altered Dispersal signifies the effects that have occurred due to human interference with landscapes and animals. Many of these interferences have caused negative consequences in the environment. For example, many areas have suffered habitat loss, which in turn can have a negative effect on dispersal. Researchers have found that due to this, animals have been reported to move further distances in an attempt to find isolated places. This can especially be seen through construction of roads and other infrastructures in remote areas.

Long-distance dispersals are observed when seeds are carried through human vectors. A study was conducted to test the effects of human-mediated dispersal of seeds over long distances in two species of Brassica in England. The main methods of dispersal compared with movement by wind versus movement by attachment to outerwear. It was concluded that shoes were able to transport seeds to further distances than what would be achievable through wind alone. It was noted that some seeds were able to stay on the shoes for long periods of time, about 8 hours of walking, but evenly came off. Due to this, the seeds were able to travel far distances and settle into new areas, where they were previously not inhabiting. However, it is also important that the seeds land in places where they are able to stick and grow. Specific shoe size did not seem to have an effect on prevalence. 

== Dispersal observation methods ==
Biological dispersal can be observed using different methods. To study the effects of dispersal, observers use the methods of landscape genetics.  This allows scientists to observe the difference between population variation, climate and well as the size and shape of the landscape. An example of the use of landscape genetics as a means to study seed dispersal, for example, involves studying the effects of traffic using motorway tunnels between inner cities and suburban area.

Genome wide SNP dataset and species distribution modelling are examples of computational methods used to examine different dispersal modes. A genome-wide SNP dataset can be used to determine the genomic and demographic history within the range of collection or observation [Reference needed]. Species distribution models are used when scientists wish to determine which region is best suited for the species under observation [Reference needed]. Methods such as these are used to understand the criteria the environment provides when migration and settlement occurs such as the cases in biological invasion.

Human-aided dispersal, an example of an anthropogenic effect, can contribute to biological dispersal ranges and variations. 

Informed dispersal is a way to observe the cues of biological dispersal suggesting the reasoning behind the placement. This concept implies that the movement between species also involve information transfer. Methods such as GPS location are used to monitor the social cues and mobility of species regarding habitat selection. GPS radio-collars can be used when collecting data on social animals such a meerkats. Consensus data such as detailed trip records and point of interest (POI) data can be used to predict the movement of humans from rural to urban areas are examples of informed dispersal [Reference needed].

Direct tracking or visual tracking allows scientists to monitor the movement of seed dispersal by color coding. Scientists and observers can track the migration of individuals through the landscape. The pattern of transportation can then be visualized to reflect the range in which the organism expands.

<text>Hans Scholl (born 1942) is a German astronomer, who worked at the Astronomisches Rechen-Institut in Heidelberg, Germany, and at the Côte d&#x27;Azur Observatory in Nice, France. In 1999, he was part of a team that discovered three moons of Uranus: Prospero, Setebos and Stephano. He has also co-discovered 55 minor planets together with Italian astronomer Andrea Boattini at ESO&#x27;s La Silla Observatory site in northern Chile during 2003–2005.

Scholl is known for his theoretical work on the orbits of minor planets. He has studied the orbital resonance of outer main-belt asteroids, as well as the orbits of 2062 Aten, a near-Earth object, and 2060 Chiron, a centaur and comet. His broad range of minor planet research included problems from mass determination to asteroid missions and from libration to depletion. He was honored by the outer main-belt asteroid 2959 Scholl, discovered by English–American astronomer Edward Bowell in 1983.

<text>The Faber Book of Twentieth-Century Women&#x27;s Poetry is a poetry anthology edited by Fleur Adcock that was published in 1987 by Faber and Faber. Sixty-four writers born between 1869 (Charlotte Mew) and 1945 (Selima Hill) are represented. Adcock organizes the anthology chronologically according to the birth of each contributor. The poets are mainly from the UK or the US, with several others from Australia (4), Canada (4), Ireland (2), and New Zealand (4), as may be discovered from the appended biographical sketches. Two hundred and twenty-five (225) complete poems or excerpts of longer poems comprise the collection. In the introduction, Adcock argues that there is &quot;no particular tradition&quot; to distinguish women&#x27;s poetry from that of men. She writes, &quot;What is different about poetry by women, of course, is not its nature but the fact that until recently it has been undervalued and to some extent neglected.&quot;

<doc id="817208" wikidata="Q7755357" url="?curid=817208" title="The Original Amateur Hour">
<text>The Original Amateur Hour is an American radio and television program. The show was a continuation of &quot;Major Bowes Amateur Hour&quot;, which had been a radio staple from 1934 to 1945. Major Edward Bowes, the originator of the program and its master of ceremonies, left the show in 1945 and died the following year. He was ultimately succeeded by Ted Mack, when the show was brought into television in 1948.

The show is a progenitor of later, similar programs such as &quot;Star Search&quot;, &quot;American Idol&quot; and &quot;America&#x27;s Got Talent&quot;.

== Format and notable contestants ==
The format was almost always the same. At the beginning of the show, the talent&#x27;s order of appearance was determined by spinning a wheel. After it was announced how many episodes the current one marked (the final broadcast on CBS being the 1,651st), the wheel was spun. As the wheel spun, the words &quot;Round and round she goes, and where she stops nobody knows&quot; were always intoned. (From the late 1950s forward, the wheel was gone: it was symbolized by flute arpeggios as Ted Mack invoked the traditional phrase.)

Various acts, sometimes singers or other musicians, quite often vaudeville fare such as jugglers, tap dancers, baton twirlers, and the like, would perform, with the audience being asked to vote for their favorites by postcard or telephone. The telephone number JUdson 6-7000 was on a banner at the bottom of the screen for viewers to call.

As the show gained markets outside New York, Mack would give the address (&quot;Box 191 Radio City Station&quot;) where viewers could send their postcards; he did this after every act. The winners were invited to appear on the next week&#x27;s show. Three-time winners were eligible for the annual championship, with the grand-prize winner receiving a $2000 scholarship.

Ted Mack ensured that the show was very fast-paced. Despite the program&#x27;s title, it was generally only a half-hour show, the only exception to this rule being from March 1956 to June 1957 on ABC, when it was expanded to an hour.

Some contestants became minor celebrities at the time, but few ever became really big show-business stars, like the six Ebe Sisters, whose fame was short-lived. The two greatest successes of the show&#x27;s television era were Gladys Knight, then only a child, and Pat Boone. Boone&#x27;s appearances on the show probably caused the closest thing that it ever had to a scandal. After he had appeared, and won, for several weeks, it was revealed that he had appeared on the rival CBS Television show &quot;Arthur Godfrey&#x27;s Talent Scouts&quot;, meaning that he was technically not an &quot;amateur&quot; singer. He was removed from the program, but by then his fame was assured. At twenty-three, Boone was hosting his own variety show on ABC, &quot;The Pat Boone Chevy Showroom&quot;, which aired from 1957 to 1960.

Other future celebrities discovered on the show include Ann-Margret (in 1958), Jose Feliciano (in 1962), Irene Cara (in 1967) and Tanya Tucker (in 1969). Louis Farrakhan appeared in 1949 playing a violin, under his birth name Louis Wolcott. Future child actor Roger Mobley appeared with an older brother and older sister in a musical trio. Future comedian Robert Klein appeared as part of a doo-wop singing group, &quot;The Teen Tones.&quot; The greatest fame attained by anyone appearing on the show was that achieved by Frank Sinatra, who appeared on the show during its radio days with &quot;The Hoboken Four&quot;.

During World War II, some in the American armed forces believed that someone involved with the program was a Nazi sympathizer because after many episodes aired, an American naval vessel would supposedly be sunk. The claim was that coded information was passed out in the course of the broadcast. Some accused Bowes himself, but none of these accusations could ever be proved. Bowes was one of President Franklin D. Roosevelt&#x27;s closest friends and was personally responsible for having the swimming pool constructed at the White House when FDR was in office. As the years went by, the audience for this program aged as well. The Sunday-afternoon version of the series, which aired on CBS in the 1960s, was invariably sponsored by Geritol and other patent medicines manufactured by their long-time sponsor, the J. B. Williams Company, best known for Aqua Velva after-shave lotion (&quot;There&#x27;s something about an Aqua Velva man!&quot;) and Lectric Shave pre-shave lotion.

== History ==
=== Radio years ===
Bowes started the radio show on WHN in New York City in 1934. Bowes&#x27; field assistant was Ted Mack, who scouted and auditioned talent for the program. Mack brought the show back in 1948 on ABC Radio, where it ran until 1952. When Mack assumed the host duties, his position in the field was taken by Albert Fisher.

The official archives of &quot;The Original Amateur Hour&quot; and the rights to the original programs and related material are now owned by Fisher. He has donated the radio recordings and television films and tapes to the Library of Congress, and has compiled a DVD collection of highlights from the series.

=== Television debut (1948–1954) ===
The television debut came on January 18, 1948 on the DuMont Television Network with Mack as the host. The regular staff for the television show included Lou Goldberg (aka Lewis Graham); Lloyd Marx, musical director; accompanist Dotty Marx, his wife; Jac Hein, writer/producer; and Marguerite (Dwyer) Scheid, talent scout. The show regularly traveled to other cities across the United States and made at least two trips to Europe for the USO. In the early 1950s, the show went to Washington, D.C., for a program featuring contestants from the United States Congress and the Truman administration.

The series is one of only six shows—the others were &quot;The Arthur Murray Party&quot;; &quot;Down You Go&quot;; &quot;The Ernie Kovacs Show&quot;; &quot;Pantomime Quiz&quot;; and &quot;Tom Corbett, Space Cadet&quot;—to appear on all four TV networks during the Golden Age of Television. The series was broadcast weekly, on early Sunday evenings, on DuMont until September 25, 1949, then moved to NBC Television in October 1949 where it remained until September 1952. NBC then hosted it from April 1953 to September 1954.

&quot;The Original Amateur Hour&quot; finished at #27 in the Nielsen ratings for the 1950–1951 season.

=== Move to other networks (1955–1970) ===
The show moved to ABC (October 1955 to June 1957), then returned to NBC (July 1957 to October 1958). It then ran from May 1959 to October 1959 on CBS, before returning to ABC for a last prime-time run from March 1960 to September 26, 1960. Even then the show wasn&#x27;t finished—it ran for another decade as a late-Sunday-afternoon feature on CBS, beginning on October 2, 1960.

Many long-running CBS shows were canceled in 1970–71 because they attracted viewers of an advanced age. Mack&#x27;s show was among the first to go, though not as a direct result of the other cancellations. Its Sunday afternoon timeslot was subsumed by the NFL on CBS at the start of the 1970 season as a result of the AFL–NFL merger and its expanded game slate, with CBS beginning to carry football doubleheaders. The network announced the show&#x27;s cancellation on November 2, as Geritol dropped its sponsorship of the series, one of the last vestiges of the Golden Age where single-series sponsors were more common.

The final show was broadcast on September 27, 1970.

=== Revival on The Family Channel (1992) ===
In 1992 Albert Fisher revived the program (as &quot;The New Original Amateur Hour&quot;) on cable television network The Family Channel (now Freeform) hosted by weatherman Willard Scott. This revival lasted one season, in spite of its popularity and high ratings.

It featured the debut of highly successful and famous Backstreet Boys member Nick Carter. This was a catalyst for other child stars including Elizabeth Byler, who starred in &quot;October Sky&quot;, &quot;Ernest Goes to Camp&quot;, and &quot;Other Voices, Other Rooms&quot;, and Summer Pulley, who went on to become a cast member of Disney Channel&#x27;s &quot;The Mickey Mouse Club&quot;, Nickelodeon&#x27;s &quot;Clarissa Explains It All&quot; and the 1989 film &quot;Parenthood&quot;. The show also revived the practice of counting the number of the original episodes, with the first being show number 1,652 and the last, show number 1,664.

<text>.au is the Internet country code top-level domain (ccTLD) for Australia. It was created on 5March 1986. Domain name policy is managed by .au Domain Administration (auDA). As of July 2018, the registry is operated by Afilias.

==History==
The domain name was originally allocated by Jon Postel, operator of the Internet Assigned Numbers Authority (IANA) to Kevin Robert Elz of Melbourne University in 1986. 

After an approximately five-year process in the 1990s, the Internet industry created a self-regulatory body called .au Domain Administration (auDA) to operate the domain. 

It obtained assent from ICANN in 2001, and commenced operating a new competitive regime for domain registration on 1July 2002. 

Since this new regime, any registration has to be ordered via a registrar.

==Operation==
Oversight of .au is by auDA, a not-for-profit organisation whose membership is derived from Internet organisations, industry members and interested individuals. 

The organisation operates with the endorsement of the Australian Government and with the delegated authority of ICANN.

Policy for .au is devised by policy development panels. These panels are convened by auDA and combine public input with industry representation to derive policy. 

The day-to-day operation of the .au registry technical facility is tendered out by auDA. 

AusRegistry has performed the registry role since the initial tender in 2002. 

In December 2017, Afilias won a competitive tender process to take over the running of the registry from AusRegistry. 

The registry does not sell domain registration services direct to the consumer, rather consumers who wish to register a domain must do so via a domain name registrar. 

After the industry&#x27;s liberalisation in 2002, there is an active competitive market in registrars with a variety of prices and services.

In 2008, auDA changed its longstanding policy and allowed changes in ownership of .au domains. Although the secondary market was initially slow to take off, there have recently been signs of increasing maturity in the .au aftermarket culminating in the record $125,500 sale of investmentproperty.com.au. 

The auDA information security standard (ISS) is an industry initiative aimed at improving the security of .au registrar businesses, protecting .au registrants and enhancing the overall stability and integrity of the .au domain space. 

auDA introduced the ISS in October 2013 as a mandatory requirement, with all accredited registrars required to be certified as ISS compliant within 24 months.

==Structure==
The naming rules for .au require registrations under second-level categories that describe a type of entity. &quot;.com.au&quot;, for example, is designed for commercial entities. This follows a similar allocation policy to that formerly used in other countries such as the United Kingdom and New Zealand.

Registrations are currently permitted below a second-level domain, such as &quot;yourname.com.au&quot;. 

In April 2016, auDA announced it would introduce registrations directly at the second level, such as &quot;yourname.au&quot;. 

Direct registrations were due to be implemented in 2017, although an ongoing debate on how cybersquatting would be mitigated led to a delay, with a new launch date of 24March 2022.

Registration of a .au domain is completed through a reseller, known as a registrar, with the registry acting as the wholesale provider. auDA manages domain name policy as the ICANN and Australian Government-endorsed manager of the .au DNS.

===Second-level domains===

The .edu.au, .gov.au and .csiro.au namespaces are referred to as &quot;closed&quot; namespaces, since registration is not available to the general public. All other second-level namespaces are referred to as &quot;open&quot; namespaces.

According to an annual report filed by .au Domain Association (auDA) in Q4 2022, one in six .au domains were a second-level domain.

===.au Direct namespace===
The direct second-level domain namespace, marketed as &quot;.au Direct&quot; has been made available to the public from 24 March 2022. The .au Direct namespace is intended to complement rather than replace the existing second-level domain namespaces and to provide domain holders with the option to register &quot;shorter, simpler domain names&quot;.

Unlike the existing second-level domain namespaces, there is no restriction on the domain names that can be registered in the .au Direct namespace, provided the domain name applicant satisfies the Australian presence requirement.

In 2019, auDA released a priority implementation policy, whereby existing domain name holders could apply for priority registration of a matching domain name in the new .au Direct namespace. Three priority categories exist:

Eligible domain name holders could apply during an allocated sunrise period commencing 24 March 2022 until 20 September 2022. 

For example, the holders of &quot;domain.com.au&quot;, &quot;domain.org.au&quot; and &quot;domain.net.au&quot; were each eligible to apply for priority registration of &quot;domain.au&quot; during the sunrise period.

If there were more than one priority application for a given domain name, priority is allocated as follows:
# Category 1 applications had priority over Category 2 applications.
# Where there are two or more Category 1 applications, priority was allocated by agreement between the respective holders, with allocation being placed on hold until consensus is reached or there is only one remaining Category 1 applicant.
# Where there are two or more Category 2 applications, priority was allocated to the holder with the earliest creation date.
Any unclaimed domain names were released to general availability at the end of the sunrise period.

===State and Territory Namespaces===

Introduced in 2004, &quot;community geographic domain names&quot; (CGDNs), later renamed to &quot;state and territory namespaces&quot;, are intended to be used for &quot;community websites that reflect community interests such as local business, tourism, historical information, culture, sporting groups, local events and news&quot; of a local community. These domains were initially managed by the .au Community Domains Trust (auCD) on behalf of auDA. The funding of auCD was provided from a ballot of locality names in the .com.au and .net.au domain spaces; previously, any locality with a postcode had been restricted from being registered as a commercial domain name.

CGDNs use the state or territory&#x27;s common abbreviation as the second level of the domain. For example, a community based in Victoria would receive a domain ending in &quot;.vic.au&quot;, a Northern Territory community would use &quot;.nt.au&quot;, and so on. The third level of the domain must be an addressable locality within that state or territory, of the form &quot;townname.vic.au&quot;. Where a name is duplicated within a state – for instance, between a smaller town, and a suburb of a larger town or city — the locality name may be suffixed with the name of the local government area, town or city to which it is associated (e.g. &quot;suburbname-cityname.vic.au&quot;).

Holders of CGDNs must be &quot;a legally registered, not-for-profit entity; and [...] representative of the local community for the purpose of holding the domain name licence.&quot; In particular, commercial entities and local governments are not permitted to hold a CGDN in their own right; they are however permitted to hold membership in such entities set up to hold a CGDN.

As of November 2009, the auCD site claims 91 active CGDNs across Australia, with a further 115 either approved or awaiting approval.

===Third-level domains===
The use of &quot;.gov.au&quot; as a second level domain is for Australian Federal government and for its initiatives, while the use of a third-level domain, being an Australian state abbreviation, is an identifier that the domain belongs to either the relevant state government or a local government inside the state. The &quot;.edu.au&quot; is also split up into state-based categories in most cases.

auDA has delegated responsibility of the .edu.au domain to Australian Information and Communications Technology in Education Committee (AICTEC), which formed a specialist sub-committee, .edu.au Domain Administration Committee (eDAC).

Schools use a domain name that reflect their locale, and these state-based third-level domains are managed independently by the states. For example, a school in Western Australia would register &quot;schoolname.wa.edu.au&quot;. Similarly, replacing the state part of these domains, Victoria would use &quot;.vic&quot;, Queensland would use &quot;.qld&quot;, South Australia would use &quot;.sa&quot;, Tasmania would use &quot;.tas&quot;, Northern Territory would use &quot;.nt&quot; and the Australian Capital Territory would use &quot;.act&quot;. However, after a change of internet services in Queensland State Schools their domain names were changed from &quot;schoolname.qld.edu.au&quot; to &quot;schoolname.eq.edu.au&quot; (&quot;eq&quot; is an abbreviation of the government department name &quot;Education Queensland&quot;). This is not the case for private schools in Queensland. Often, domains can even contain a fourth level: for instance, a NSW public school might have the domain &quot;schoolname.schools.nsw.edu.au&quot;.

Tertiary institutions are typically exempt from requiring state-based distinctions. For example, Edith Cowan University in Western Australia has a domain of &quot;ecu.edu.au&quot; rather than &quot;ecu.wa.edu.au&quot;, RMIT University in Victoria uses &quot;rmit.edu.au&quot; rather than &quot;rmit.vic.edu.au&quot;. This difference can be associated with states having responsibility for primary and secondary education while the Commonwealth has responsibility for tertiary education; tertiary institutions often having a presence in multiple states.

===Historic second-level domains===
Some second-level domain names are no longer actively used. Whilst registrations are grandfathered for some, no new registrations are accepted.
==Registration policies and rules==
The .au domain namespace has strict licensing and eligibility requirements, compared to other gTLDs. This &quot;policy rich&quot; approach to the name space, begun by Robert Elz and continued by auDA, has meant the .au domain space has avoided the cybersquatting and fraudulent uses of domains prevalent in other more permissive domains.

auDA has been known to suspend or cancel domain registrations that potentially breach this policy in response to public outcry, such as when the Liberal Party redirected Albanese.com.au — the surname of Labor leader Anthony Albanese — to its own homepage in during the 2022 Australian federal election campaign.

auDA maintains a set of formal published policies and rules which apply to all domains registered in the .au namespace.

===&quot;Domain Name Eligibility and Allocation Policy Rules&quot; (2002 to 2021)===
The &quot;Domain Name Eligibility and Allocation Policy Rules&quot; were first adopted in May 2002. Several revisions were subsequently introduced in 2005, 2008, and 2012 (subsequently updated in 2018).

Under the 2012 Eligibility Rules, registering a domain in the &quot;open&quot; .au namespace required that:
* the registrant must:
** be an Australian organization or individual, the holder of an Australian trade mark, or a foreign company licensed to trade in Australia; and
** conform to the specific registrant eligibility requirements the second-level domain; and
* the domain name must:
** be an exact match, abbreviation, or acronym of the registrant&#x27;s name or trade mark; or 
** have a &quot;close and substantial connection&quot; to the registrant.

=== auDA rules: Licensing (2021–present) ===
auDA adopted revised rules for domain names in 2021. The new rules (known as the &quot;.au Domain Administration Rules: Licensing&quot;) apply to all domain names created or renewed after 12 April 2021.

The new rules provide an &quot;Australian presence&quot; requirement for all domain name holders. To satisfy the Australian presence requirement, an individual must be an Australian permanent resident or citizen, while an organisation must either be incorporated in Australia or hold an Australian Business Number (ABN). Holders of an Australian trade mark also satisfy the Australian presence requirement, provided the domain name is an exact match of the trade mark.

For most domain types, the licensing rules also require that the domain name must be:
* a match, acronym or abbreviation of the name of the holder; or
* a match of the name of products, services, events, programs, premises or activities associated with the domain name holder; or
* a match of the holder&#x27;s Australian trade mark.

Sublicensing of a domain name is prohibited, unless the domain name holder is a parent company of the licensee.

Domain name monetisation is prohibited in the .org.au, .asn.au, .id.au and .edu.au and State/Territory geographic namespaces. Domain Name Monetisation is defined in the Licensing Rules as the practice of &quot;application for a licence by a Person with the sole purpose of selling, leasing or holding the applied for Domain Name to generate revenue.&quot; and includes warehousing or acquiring domain name licenses for the sole purpose of transfer to another purpose.

===.au Dispute Resolution Policy (auDRP)===
Domain name disputes between parties are handled under the &quot;.au Dispute Resolution Policy&quot; (&quot;auDRP&quot;), which was adapted from the UDRP by Philip Argy for auDA.

The auDRP was adopted in 2016, and applies to all domain names in the Australian open 2LD&#x27;s registered after 2002. All domain registrants and registrars are contractually required to agree to the auDRP under the terms of registration or accreditation, and are bound by decisions issued by auDRP Dispute Resolution Providers.

auDRP complaints are determined by an external accredited dispute resolution provider. The resolution provider is chosen by the complainant. As of 2022, there are two auDA-approved dispute resolution providers:
* the World Intellectual Property Organization; and
* the Resolution Institute (formerly LEADR &amp; IAMA).

A single domain name dispute may concern one or more Australian domain names.

The decision-making panel comprises either a single panelist or three panelists, at the complainant&#x27;s election. If the complainant elects a single panelist, the respondent (domain holder) may elect to have the proceeding determined by three panelists instead. The decision is made &quot;on the papers&quot; (that is, on the basis of written submissions by the complainant and the respondent) and no hearings are required.

Upon lodgement of an auDRP complaint, the domain name&#x27;s registrar of record is required to impose a registry lock on the domain name until the completion of the proceeding. This is to prevent the respondent from altering or transferring the domain name during the dispute.

Panelists must follow the auDRP. In addition to the formal auDRP Rules, each Resolution Provider may prescribe Supplemental Rules, relating to their requirements for format of submissions, timing and processes. Panellists are not bound to follow formal rules of evidence, or precedent. However, there are published practice guidelines for auDRP panelists.

To succeed in a domain name complaint under the auDRP, the complainant must establish all three of the following grounds:
# the complainant has rights in a trademark and the disputed domain name is identical or confusingly similar to that trademark;
# the respondent (domain holder) has no legitimate rights or interests in respect of the domain name; and
# the respondent has registered &quot;or&quot; used the domain name in bad faith. (This criterion is a key difference from the UDRP, which requires registration &quot;and&quot; use in bad faith.)

There are two remedies available to a successful complainant:
* cancellation of the domain name (the domain name is dropped and returned to the pool of available domain names); or
* transfer of the domain name to the complainant, provided the complainant satisfies the eligibility requirements to hold the domain name.
If a successful decision is issued, then unless Court proceedings are commenced within 10 business days, the remedy is implemented automatically by the domain name&#x27;s registrar of record without input from the respondent.

Decisions issued under the auDRP are published in an archive database.

== Domain statistics ==
auDA issues an Annual Report as at the end of each financial year (30 June). Since 2019, auDA has also issued quarterly statistical reports. These reports contain statistical information about the performance of the .au domain and other information about auDA&#x27;s operations during the reporting period.

According to auDA&#x27;s Annual Reports, the total domains under management (being the total number of active domain names) and average new domains created per month are as follows:

The .com.au second-level domain namespace accounts for the vast majority of domain name registrations. In 2020–21, the number of .com.au domains registered exceeded 3 million for the first time.

==Other Australian domain names==
.au is not the only top-level domain name assigned to Australia. Some Australian territories have their own ISO 3166-1 alpha-2 code, and therefore have their own ccTLD as well:

As the appropriate authorities were late in recognising the need to manage these, most were registered by entrepreneurs for use as vanity domains unrelated to the locale they serve. .cc, for example, is now operated by VeriSign. .hm represents a nature preserve with no human inhabitants.

Some Australian local government authorities have adopted *.cc domains as a convenient abbreviation for &quot;City Council&quot;. For example, the Brisbane City Council uses the domain name &quot;bne.cc&quot; as a URL shortener.

There are also two geographic top-level domain names assigned to Australia in which are used by individuals and businesses within a particular region, they are:

<text>East Stirlingshire Football Club is a Scottish association football club based in the town of Falkirk. The club was founded in 1881 and competes in the , the fifth tier of the Scottish football league system. The club&#x27;s origins can be traced to 1880 when a local cricket club formed a football team under the name &quot;Bainsford Britannia&quot;.

The club was elected to the Scottish Football League in 1900–01 and has competed in the league system for most of its existence. East Stirlingshire has won the second tier of Scottish football once and finished runners-up once, earning promotion to the top-flight on both occasions. The club&#x27;s highest league ranking came during the two solitary seasons it competed in the top flight in 1932–33 and 1963–64. In 2016, East Stirlingshire became the first club ever to be relegated out of the national league system.

East Stirlingshire first entered in the Scottish Cup in 1882, its best result reaching the quarter-finals on three occasions, the last in 1981. The club&#x27;s best result in a national cup competition was in the 2000–01 season when it reached the semi-finals of the Scottish Challenge Cup, losing to Livingston for a place in the final. In 2008, the club left Firs Park and moved to Ochilview Park to ground-share with local rivals Stenhousemuir. Since the start of the 2018–19 season the club have ground-shared with their neighbour club Falkirk at the Falkirk Stadium.

==History==
East Stirlingshire&#x27;s official date of formation was in 1881, but its origins can be traced to the previous year when a local cricket club called Bainsford Bluebonnets formed a football team under the name Britannia. The team&#x27;s first recorded match was a friendly against Falkirk&#x27;s second eleven in December 1880 and resulted in a 7–0 defeat while its first match as East Stirlingshire was against the same opponent in August 1881. The club&#x27;s nickname is &quot;The Shire&quot;, which refers to the Stirlingshire part of the club name. After joining the Scottish Football Association, the club became eligible to compete in the Scottish Cup, Scotland&#x27;s main association football knock-out competition, eliminated in its first game in 1882. In December 1883, the Stirlingshire Football Association was founded, with membership open to clubs exclusively from the county of Stirlingshire. It resulted in the establishment of a new regional tournament called the Stirlingshire Cup, with the club reaching the final in its first season. East Stirlingshire dominated the tournament in its early years, winning it for a record four consecutive seasons 91885 and 18890, including an emphatic 9–0 victory against Falkirk in the 1888 final. Two goals came from Lawrence McLachlan who was an influential goalscorer in the club&#x27;s early successes; scoring more times than any other East Stirlingshire player with 135 known goals.

The latter years of the 19th century was East Stirlingshire&#x27;s most successful era in the Scottish Cup. In the 1888–89 and 1890–91 tournaments, the club reached the quarter-finals in what was to be the last time for 91 years, losing to Celtic and Hearts respectively. In the 1888–89 tournament, the club recorded its highest win and equalled it in successive rounds with a 10–1 victory against local rivals Stenhousemuir in the first round and an 11–2 win over Vale of Bannock in the second round. It was during this period that four East Stirlingshire players earned international caps for their countries. The first was the Wales national team captain, Humphrey Jones, who earned five caps whilst with the club. Three other players, David Alexander, Archibald Ritchie, and James McKee made appearances for the Scotland national team from 1891 to 1898.

Between 1891 and 1899, the club competed in regional leagues, including winning the Midland Football League and Central Football Combination, before being elected to the second tier of Scotland&#x27;s main national league competition – the Scottish Football League – in 1900–01, ending its first season ranked 7th from ten. In March 1905, a proposal was raised for the club to merge with neighbours Falkirk with an aim to creating a bigger and more financially stable club, which Falkirk accepted in a vote. However, East Stirlingshire&#x27;s vote was not in favour and the club rejected the proposal. The years following included finishing bottom of the league in 1905–06, recording only one win from 22 games, contrasting with finishing as high as third in table in 1912–13, narrowly missing out on winning the championship by two points.&lt;ref name=&quot;SFL_League_table_1912/13&quot;&gt;Scottish Football League Championship Tables – Season 1912/13 , Scottish Football League. Retrieved 17 March 2013.&lt;/ref&gt; The club remained in Division Two until 1914–15 when it, and the Scottish Cup, were both suspended due to World War I.

At the end of World War I, the club was re-elected to the old Division Two which was re-established in the 1921–22 season. The year beforehand saw the club move to Firs Park after leaving their old ground of Merchiston Park in 1920. In the same year, a record home attendance of 12,000 was set when the club played eventual champions, Partick Thistle, in the Scottish Cup in February 1921. The club was relegated to the newly created, but short lived, Division Three in 1922–23, earning promotion back to Division Two after one season; setting a record of 23 home games without a loss. A decade later, East Stirlingshire won promotion to Division One, Scotland&#x27;s top flight, for the first time. En route to promotion, the club spent 32 weeks at the top of Division Two, ending the season equal on 55 points with St Johnstone, with East Stirlingshire winning the championship on a superior goal average. East Stirlingshire spent one season in its first spell in the top flight, ending the year bottom of the league in 20th with seventeen points. Back in Division Two in the 1935–36 season, the club&#x27;s heaviest league defeat of 12–1 was inflicted by Dundee United in April 1936. In 1938–39, the final season before the league was suspended due to World War II, East Stirlingshire finished second-bottom of the league, ahead of only Edinburgh City, but despite finishing low, Malcolm Morrison became the club&#x27;s highest league goalscorer in a single season with 36 goals.

The club was excluded from a wartime league in 1939 and was also denied re-entry to the Scottish Football League Division Two at the end of World War II, along with six other small league clubs. As a result, the clubs competed in a newly created Division C along with the reserve teams of some of Scotland&#x27;s top clubs. In the second season in Division C, East Stirlingshire won the league and was promoted back to Division Two, now renamed &quot;Division B&quot;, but finished last after one season in 1948–49, and were relegated back to the &quot;C Division&quot;.

After another six seasons competing in &quot;Division C&quot; the club rejoined Division Two in 1955–56 when the &quot; C Division&quot; was abolished and the number of teams in the Scottish Football League was expanded. The club sold many young players to larger clubs, including defender Eddie McCreadie to Chelsea in 1962 who earned 23 international caps for Scotland and is tenth in Chelsea&#x27;s all-time appearance list with 410. The money earned from the transfer helped attract new players and in the 1962–63 season, the club won promotion to the top flight for a second time, as runners-up in Division Two behind St Johnstone. Like the previous occasion in 1932–33, East Stirlingshire spent one solitary season in the top tier before being relegated.

After relegation from Scotland&#x27;s top flight, East Stirlingshire was controversially merged with Clydebank Juniors in 1964. The new club was renamed &quot;East Stirlingshire Clydebank&quot; – often E.S. Clydebank for short – and relocated to Kilbowie Park in Clydebank against fans&#x27; wishes. However, the merge lasted only one season, with East Stirlingshire shareholders winning several court cases against it and thus the club reverted to its original legal status and moved back to Falkirk. During the single season as E.S. Clydebank, the club set a record attendance at Kilbowie Park when 14,900 spectators attended a Scottish Cup first round replay against Hibernian in February 1965.

In 1966, Lawrence Binnie became the club&#x27;s first official manager, prior to his appointment the board of directors took responsibility for management roles. After de-merging with Clydebank Juniors, the club spent ten seasons in Division Two before being moved by league reconstruction to a new Second Division for the 1975–76 season, now the third tier with the creation of the Premier Division at the top of the Scottish Football League. During this period, the club progressed past the group stage of Scottish League Cup for the first time since it was inaugurated in 1947. The year beforehand saw the club appoint its most famous manager, Alex Ferguson, who was at the club during 1974 before moving to St Mirren. In 1979–80, East Stirlingshire won promotion to the First Division, which is the last time the club was promoted in the league. Managed by Billy Lamont, the club finished runners-up by one point to rivals Falkirk in the Second Division.&lt;ref name=&quot;SFL_League_table_1979/80&quot;&gt;Scottish Football League Championship Tables – Season 1979/80 , Scottish Football League. Retrieved 11 March 2013.&lt;/ref&gt; The clubs shared the top two spots in the league for most of the season and entered the final match equal on points, with East Stirlingshire required to better Falkirk&#x27;s result to win the championship due to an inferior goal difference. However, Falkirk won its match and East Stirlingshire drew and so finished second.

In the 1994–95 season, the Scottish Football League was again restructured and East Stirlingshire was moved to a new Third Division, now the fourth-tier. The club finished its first season in the Third Division ranked fourth from ten and repeated it again in 1997–98. With these exceptions East Stirlingshire generally finished below mid-table, including a final day victory against Arbroath in the 1996–97 season to avoid finishing last. In 2000–01, the club reached the semi-final of a national cup competition for the first time in its history, losing 2–1 to Livingston for a place in the final of the Scottish Challenge Cup.

At the start of the 21st century the club struggled financially, paying players £10-a-week and manager Dennis Newall became the first unpaid manager at senior level in Scottish football. As a result, the club ranked last in the Scottish Football League for five consecutive seasons from 2002–03 to 2006–07, losing 24 consecutive league games in the 2003–04 season, recording only 8 points from two wins and two draws in 36 games.&lt;ref name=&quot;statto_results_2003/04&quot;&gt;East Stirlingshire 2003–2004 : Results , &quot;statto.com&quot;. Retrieved 15 March 2013.&lt;/ref&gt; From the 2005–06 season, it was determined if a club finished bottom of the Third Division twice in successive years, it would face the risk of being reduced to associate member status, meaning the loss of voting rights. In East Stirlingshire&#x27;s case, a league vote was held and concluded in favour of the club retaining full member status with the condition that it did not finish last the following season in 2008. The club won its final game of the season to move off the bottom of the table in a 3–1 win against Montrose, which was also the last game at Firs Park. The following season, retaining full member status, the club moved to Ochilview Park in a ground-share agreement with neighbours Stenhousemuir.

Under manager Jim McInally, the club finished third in successive years to qualify for the promotion play-offs to the Second Division. However, a second-bottom place finish in the 2010–11 season saw McInally sacked and replaced by John Coughlin. The club would subsequently post another two bottom-place finishes in the seasons to follow, which could have again put them in danger of reduction to associate member status, but due to ongoing negotiations about league restructuring for the 2013–14 season, the league opted not to enforce the rule. The negotiations ultimately saw the formation of a new governing body, the Scottish Professional Football League, following the merger of the Scottish Football League and Scottish Premier League. East Stirlingshire joined the Scottish League Two, the successor to the old Third Division. In October 2015, on loan Raith Rovers forward Jonny Court scored the SPFL&#x27;s 5000th goal (across all four divisions, but not including play-offs), in a 2–0 home win over Elgin City. Having finished bottom of 2015–16 Scottish League Two, East Stirlingshire faced a play-off against Edinburgh City for a place in 2016–17 Scottish League Two. Edinburgh City won 2–1 on aggregate, relegating East Stirlingshire to the Lowland League and ending their 61-year tenure in the Scottish national league set-up.
==Colours and crest==
East Stirlingshire&#x27;s home colours have been black and white hoops for most of its existence since 1882. The club&#x27;s first strip was thin blue and white hoops between 1880 and 1882, before changing to colours similar to the present day. An all-black shirt was introduced between 1960 and 1962, and again between 2008 and 2010, while the club&#x27;s centenary strip in 1981 was all-white. In 1996–97, the stripes were changed from horizontal to vertical for a full season; a similar design featured for one month in August 1982 before changing back.

The first company to supply kits for East Stirlingshire was Bukta between 1979 and 1987. For the 1998–99 season, the club signed a deal with French kit supplier Le Coq Sportif who failed to deliver the kits in time for the start of the season so sent a set of Queen&#x27;s Park strips with East Stirlingshire&#x27;s crest and sponsors ironed on top of the original. The supplier for the 2012–13 season is Jako. Past suppliers include Hummel, Umbro and Joma.

The club crest is a shield with black and white stripes and a stylised football, with a banner displaying the club name at the top. It has several variations with the football and banner coloured black, white or orange in different versions.

==Grounds==
East Stirlingshire has played at several grounds over its history. In the club&#x27;s early existence as &quot;Britannia&quot;, it played one of its first known matches at Burnhouse against a Falkirk 2nd XI, which ended in a 7–0 defeat for the team. Burnhouse is thought to be the location that was to become Merchiston Park, where the club played many of its matches in the late 19th century. Some home matches were also played at Randyford Park in the town.

Merchiston Park was a football ground located in the village of Bainsford, approximately north of Falkirk. It was situated on the northern bank of the Forth and Clyde Canal near to present day Main Street in Bainsford.
The ground hosted East Stirlingshire&#x27;s first Scottish Football League match in 1900–01 which ended in a 3–2 defeat to Airdrieonians. Merchiston Park remained the club&#x27;s home until 1921 when a nearby iron works acquired the ground for expansion and the club moved to Firs Park.

Firs Park was located to the south of the canal in the centre of Falkirk, named after the street in which it was situated, Firs Street. The club moved to the ground in 1921 and in the same year, the club&#x27;s record attendance was set at a Scottish Cup match against Partick Thistle when 12,000 spectators attended. Firs Park was East Stirlingshire&#x27;s home for 87 years, except a solitary season in 1964 when the club played at Kilbowie Park in Clydebank after being controversially merged with Clydebank Juniors. As a result of the merger, Firs Park was closed, however, after only one season, the merger was disbanded and East Stirlingshire moved back to the ground, where it remained until the end of the 2007–08 season. The decision was taken by the club to close Firs Park due to the prohibitive costs of potential refurbishing to meet new Scottish Football Association stadium criteria. At the time of closure, the ground had a capacity of 1,800 with 200 seated in the main stand.

After leaving Firs Park in 2008 they played their home matches at Ochilview Park the home of local rivals Stenhousemuir; the club entered a groundshare agreement with Stenhousemuir, originally intended to be for a period of five years, during which the club planned to develop a new stadium in Falkirk.

Since the summer of 2018, East Stirlingshire have been playing their home matches at Falkirk Stadium which is the home ground of local rivals Falkirk. In May 2014, the club entered into a partnership with LK Galaxy Sports and others to develop a new playing facility at the former BP Club site at Little Kerse, between Grangemouth and Polmont. The site would also host other sports in due course. Planning was approved by Falkirk Council, but did not proceed at the time due to a lack of funds. The club trained at Little Kerse until the 2018 switch to the Falkirk Stadium, when all operations were moved to that venue.

==Rivalries==

East Stirlingshire&#x27;s traditional rival is Falkirk. The club&#x27;s first match known as both &quot;Britannia&quot; and &quot;East Stirlingshire&quot; were friendly games against Falkirk in 1880 and 1881. Both clubs are based in Falkirk and have competed against each other in competitions such as Stirlingshire Cup since the late 19th century. East Stirlingshire was elected to the bottom tier of the Scottish Football League in 1900, closely followed by Falkirk two seasons later in 1902–03. The first competitive league meeting between the clubs ended in a 2–0 win for Falkirk at Merchiston Park in August 1902. The two clubs&#x27; old grounds of Firs Park and Brockville Park were geographically close, separated by less than half a mile (0.8 km).

On a regional scale, East Stirlingshire has rivalries with football clubs from the historical county of Stirlingshire, who have competed in the Stirlingshire Cup against each other since the early 1880s such as Stenhousemuir and since 1945, Stirling Albion and Alloa Athletic. East Stirlingshire played its home matches in a ground-share agreement with rivals Stenhousemuir at their Ochilview Park home until 2018.

==Notable players==

Gordon Russell holds the record for the most number of Scottish Football League appearances for East Stirlingshire with 415 between 1983 and 2002. He also went on to become the manager of the club for a short period in 2002.

East Stirlingshire players have been capped for their country at full international level 9 times by four players. The first person to do so was Humphrey Jones, who captained the Wales national team four times out of the five caps he earned whilst at East Stirlingshire. His first came in a British Home Championship match against England in 1889. The three other players to make an appearance for their country are Archibald Ritchie, David Alexander and James McKee, all for the Scotland national team at the British Championship. Each of them made their début against Wales, although in different seasons. Archibald Ritchie&#x27;s one and only Scotland cap came in March 1891 against Wales, who were captained by former East Stirlingshire player Humphrey Jones. David Alexander made two appearances, one against Ireland and scoring against Wales at the 1894 British Home Championship which Scotland won. James McKee scored twice during his only appearance for Scotland, in a 5–2 victory over Wales in 1898. He is the last East Stirlingshire player to be capped by his country. Murray Brown was a steadfast defender during the late 90s having performed to a high standard at West Bromwich Albion during his teenage years.

==Notable managers==

East Stirlingshire did not officially appoint a manager until 1966. Before then, all management decisions were taken by the board of directors at the club. The first person to manage the club was Lawrence Binnie in 1966. The club&#x27;s most famous manager is former Manchester United manager, Sir Alex Ferguson, who in his first position as manager, stayed at East Stirlingshire during 1974 before moving to St Mirren.

No manager has won a league title with the club, however, Billy Lamont managed East Stirlingshire to promotion to the 1980–81 Scottish First Division after finishing runners-up in Division Two, one point behind rivals Falkirk. He also took East Stirlingshire to the quarter-finals of the Scottish Cup, the furthest stage of the tournament the club has reached since reaching the same stage 91 years beforehand in 1889–90.

After five consecutive seasons finishing bottom of the Scottish Football League in the mid-2000s, Jim McInally also changed fortunes at the club, managing East Stirlingshire to successive third-place finishes in the Third Division between 2008 and 2010 to qualify for the promotion play-offs.

==Records and statistics==
The club&#x27;s record Scottish Football League victory is 8–0 against Arthurlie in August 1927 in Division Two and its record defeat is 12–1 to Dundee United in April 1936 in the same division. In the Scottish Cup, the club&#x27;s record winning margin is 9 goals which it achieved in consecutive rounds of the 1888–89 Scottish Cup tournament: 10–1 against Stenhousemuir in the first round on 1 September 1888 and 11–2 against Vale of Bannock in the second round on 22 September 1888. In only its second season of competing in the cup, East Stirlingshire recorded its greatest loss: 2–10 to Renton in October 1884.

East Stirlingshire&#x27;s record home attendance is 12,000 for a third round Scottish Cup match against Partick Thistle on 19 February 1921 at Firs Park.

Gordon Russell holds the record for East Stirlingshire league appearances, playing 445 first-team matches between 1983–84 and 2000–01.

<text>The National Innovation System (also NIS, National System of Innovation) is the flow of technology and information among people, enterprises and institutions which is key to the innovative process on the national level. According to innovation system theory, innovation and technology development are results of a complex set of relationships among actors in the system, which includes enterprises, universities and government research institutes.

==Origins of term==
The term &quot;National System of Innovation&quot; originated when Christopher Freeman and Bengt-Åke Lundvall worked together in the late 1980s. Freeman&#x27;s research drew heavily on political economy of Friedrich List and his historical account of the rise of Japan as an economic superpower. Lundvall&#x27;s work explored the important social interactions between suppliers and customers and their role in encouraging innovation in Denmark. Apart from a general definition, as above, there is no canonical definition of national innovation systems. A few dominant definitions are listed below (quoted in an OECD publication) which overlap quite a bit:

A national system of innovation has been defined as follows:

* &quot;... the network of institutions in the public and private sectors whose activities and interactions initiate, import, modify and diffuse new technologies.&quot;
* &quot;... the elements and relationships which interact in the production, diffusion and use of new, and economically useful, knowledge ... and are either located within or rooted inside the borders of a nation state.&quot;
* &quot;... a set of institutions whose interactions determine the innovative performance ... of national firms.&quot;
* &quot;... the national institutions, their incentive structures and their competencies, that determine the rate and direction of technological learning (or the volume and composition of change generating activities) in a country.&quot;
* &quot;... that set of distinct institutions which jointly and individually contribute to the development and diffusion of new technologies and which provides the framework within which governments form and implement policies to influence the innovation process. As such it is a system of interconnected institutions to create, store and transfer the knowledge, skills and artefacts which define new technologies.&quot;

A country’s innovative performance largely depends on how these actors relate to each other as elements of a collective system of knowledge creation and use as well as the technologies they use. For example, public research institutes, academia and industry serve as research producers carrying out research and development (R&amp;D) activities. On the other hand, governments either central or regional play the role of coordinator among research producers in terms of their policy instruments, visions and perspectives for the future. Furthermore, in order to promote innovation the different innovative actors must have strong links with each other based on a strong level of trust and governments should promote and activate trust among the different innovation actors. The links can take the form of joint research, personnel exchanges, crosspatenting, and purchase of equipment. Finally, NSI are shaped by distinct socio-cultural qualities of national communities. Therefore, there are national trajectories of innovativeness, technology orientation and learning, which results in each nation, either highly developed or not, having some kind of NSI, no matter if working well or not. Furthermore, the success factors of NSI have been seen by many scholars in the creation of supportive institutions and organizations (with a key role of education) and collaboration links Bridging Scales in Innovation Policies throughout the various elements that constitute a NSI. Examples include public R&amp;D and companies, as well as common objectives and innovative cultures of agents, altogether entailing self/reinforcing progress and synergies. Differences in the structures and strategies of NSI among various economically successful countries indicate, however, that there is no universal best practise recipe.

<doc id="817243" wikidata="Q3435209" url="?curid=817243" title="Port Louis, Falkland Islands">
<text>Port Louis is a settlement on northeastern East Falkland. It was established by Louis de Bougainville on 5 April 1764 as the first French settlement on the islands, but was then transferred to Spain in 1767 and renamed &quot;Puerto Soledad&quot; (In Spanish, East Falkland is known as &quot;Isla Soledad&quot;).
==History==
The settlement has seen several name changes. The original French settlers named the settlement Port Saint Louis, which was changed to Puerto Soledad after capture by Spain. Vernet reverted to a Spanish version of the original name when he formed his settlement, Puerto Luis. The British renamed the settlement Anson&#x27;s Harbour for a while before reverting once more to the original French name, Port Louis.

For a time, the town became the Spanish capital of the islands, which were claimed by Spain and administered from Montevideo as a naval outpost (Presidio). The Spanish removed the governor in 1806 and abandoned the settlement in 1811.

In October 1820, following damage to his ship &quot;Heroína&quot; in a storm, Colonel David Jewett was forced to put into the islands to shelter in Puerto Soledad. This was the culmination of a disastrous eight-month voyage that saw a mutiny and most of his crew disabled by scurvy and other diseases. While in harbour, there was another attempt at mutiny by the crew who wished to return to Buenos Aires. With many of his crew disabled by scurvy, Jewett sought the assistance of the British Antarctic explorer James Weddell in preparing his ship for sea once more.

On 6 November 1820, Jewett raised the flag of the United Provinces of the River Plate (now Argentina) at Port Louis. Weddell witnessed the ceremony.

After resting in the islands and repairing his ship, Jewett returned to Buenos Aires.

===Luis Vernet===

In 1823, the United Provinces of the River Plate granted fishing rights to Jorge Pacheco and the Hamburg-born merchant Luis Vernet. The partnership of Pacheco and Vernet did not last, with Vernet forming a new company in 1825. An expedition in 1826 proved to be a failure; sailings to the Islands were disrupted by a Brazilian blockade and the boggy terrain of the Islands prevented the Gauchos catching wild cattle in their traditional way.

In 1828, the United Provinces of the River Plate granted Vernet all of East Falkland together with exclusive fishing and sealing rights. Included in the grant was a clause that provided a colony was established within three years, it would be exempt from taxes. Settling in the former Spanish capital of Puerto Soledad, Vernet reverted to the use of its original name Puerto Luis. By 1831, the colony was well established and advertising for new colonists, although the &quot;Lexington&quot;&#x27;s report (see below) suggests that the conditions on the islands were quite miserable. 

The colony was largely archaic, and the Argentine government hoped that Vernet&#x27;s appointment would bolster the economic and political status of the colony, given his extensive business operations.
Vernet was well aware of British claims to the islands. Prior to both the 1826 and 1828 expedition, he approached the British consulate with the grant of the United Provinces of the River Plate and obtained their stamp. While visiting the consulate, he expressed the wish that if the British returned they would take his colony under their protection. Vernet also provided written reports on the suitability of the Islands for the British Government.

Vernet used Puerto Soledad/Puerto Luis as a seal hunting base. The United Provinces of the River Plate granted him a monopoly in the islands and he curbed sealing by others. Vernet later seized the American ship &quot;Harriet&quot; for breaking the restrictions on seal hunting. Property on board the ship was seized and the captain was returned to Buenos Aires to stand trial. Vernet also returned for the trial. The American Consul in the United Provinces of the River Plate protested the actions by Vernet, stating that the United States did not recognise its sovereignty in the Falklands. 

The consul dispatched the warship USS &quot;Lexington&quot; to Puerto Luis to retake the confiscated property, as well as the &quot;Superior&quot; and &quot;Breakwater&quot; which had also been seized. The &quot;Lexington&quot; destroyed the guns and powder of Puerto Luis in 1832, an act later condoned by the American ambassador in Buenos Aires, who declared the Falkland Islands to be &quot;res nullius&quot; (&quot;free from any power&quot;). 40 settlers took the opportunity to leave on board the &quot;Lexington&quot;, leaving twenty-four behind.

===Re-establishment of British rule on the Falklands===
Amid the turmoil, the British took over the settlement in 1833. In March/April that year, Charles Darwin visited from HMS &quot;Beagle&quot;. He commented that:
Admiral George Grey conducted a survey of the islands in 1836, and his view was a little more positive. In November 1846 he wrote:
After they transferred the administration to Stanley in 1845, it became the quiet sheep farming settlement it is today, known for its nineteenth-century houses, waterfowl and wading birds.

<text>Bathsheba Grossman (born 1966) is an American artist who creates sculptures using computer-aided design and three-dimensional modeling, with metal printing technology to produce sculpture in bronze and stainless steel. Her bronze sculptures are primarily mathematical in nature, often depicting intricate patterns or mathematical oddities (for instance, a figure with only one side but three edges). Her website also has crystals that have been laser etched with three-dimensional patterns, including models of nearby stars, the DNA macromolecule, and the Milky Way Galaxy.

Grossman&#x27;s works have featured in art galleries around the world, as well as &quot;The New York Times&quot;, and the television series &quot;Numb3rs&quot; and &quot;Heroes&quot;. In July 2012, her work &quot;The Rygo&quot; was installed in the VanDusen Botanical Garden in Vancouver; at 2 meters high, as of the time of installation it is the largest 3D print in North America.

She studied under sculptor Erwin Hauer at Yale University as a mathematics undergraduate, and later with Robert Engman at the University of Pennsylvania.

Her brothers are the writers Austin Grossman and Lev Grossman. She is the daughter of the poet Allen Grossman and the novelist Judith Grossman. Grossman&#x27;s father was born Jewish and her mother was raised Anglican.

<doc id="817286" wikidata="Q17030471" url="?curid=817286" title="Kansas City preventive patrol experiment">
<text>The Kansas City preventive patrol experiment was a landmark experiment carried out between 1972 and 1973 by the Kansas City Police Department of Kansas City, Missouri and the Police Foundation, an independent nonprofit research organization today known as the National Policing Institute. It was designed to test the assumption that the presence (or potential presence) of police officers in marked cars reduced the likelihood of a crime being committed. It was the first study to demonstrate that research into the effectiveness of different policing styles could be carried out responsibly and safely.

==Design==
The experiment was designed to answer the following questions:
# Would citizens notice changes in the level of police patrol and crime?
# Would different levels of visible police patrol affect recorded crime or the outcome of victim surveys?
# Would citizen fear of crime and attendant behavior change as a result of differing patrol levels?
# Would their degree of satisfaction with police change?

The design took three different police beats in Kansas City, and varied patrol routine in them. The first group received no routine patrols, instead the police responded only to calls from residents. The second group had the normal level of patrols, while the third had two to three times as many patrols.

The experiment had to be stopped and restarted three times because some patrol officers believed the absence of patrols would endanger citizens. This was upheld for 12 months, from 1 October 1972 to 30 September 1973. 

Victim surveys, reported crime rates, arrest data, a survey of local businesses, attitudinal surveys, and trained observers who monitored police-citizen interaction were used to gather data. These were taken before the start of the experiment (September 1972), and after (October 1973), giving &#x27;before&#x27; and &#x27;after&#x27; conditions for comparison.

==Major findings==
# Citizens did not notice the difference when the frequency of patrols was changed.
# Increasing or decreasing the level of patrol had no significant effect on resident and commercial burglaries, auto thefts, larcenies involving auto accessories, robberies, or vandalism–crimes.
# The rate at which crimes were reported did not differ significantly across the experimental beats.
# Citizen reported fear of crime was not affected by different levels of patrol.
# Citizen satisfaction with police did not vary.

==Conclusions drawn==
The Kansas City Police Department drew the conclusion that routine preventive patrol in marked police cars has little value in preventing crime or making citizens feel safe and that resources normally allocated to these activities could safely be allocated elsewhere.

A significant factor realised was that crime prevention was more highly dependent on the willingness of citizens to report suspicious and/or criminal behaviour to police than the levels or types of patrol.

<text>&quot;A Nice Cup of Tea&quot; is an essay by English author George Orwell, first published in the &quot;London Evening Standard&quot; on 12 January 1946. It is a discussion of the craft of making a cup of tea, including the line: &quot;Here are my own eleven rules, every one of which I regard as golden.&quot;

Orwell wrote that &quot;tea is one of the mainstays of civilisation in this country and causes violent disputes over how it should be made&quot;, and his rules cover such matters as the best shape for a teacup, the advisability of using water that is still boiling, and his preference for very strong tea. He also considers what he calls &quot;one of the most controversial points of all&quot; – whether to put tea in the cup first and add the milk after, or the other way around, acknowledging, &quot;indeed in every family in Britain there are probably two schools of thought on the subject&quot;. Orwell says tea should be poured first because &quot;one can exactly regulate the amount of milk whereas one is liable to put in too much milk if one does it the other way round&quot;. &quot;I maintain that my own argument is unanswerable&quot;, he writes.

<text>San Fernando de Henares is a municipality in Spain, in the province and autonomous community of Madrid. It has an area of 39.9 km2 and 38,904 inhabitants (2022). Its agricultural production includes olives, cereals, vegetables, cattle and wool. Its industries include metalworking, mechanical engineering, food processing and graphic arts.

==History==

In 1746 King Philip V bought the area where San Fernando now stands to install a royal fabric factory. After the king&#x27;s death shortly thereafter, the project was developed by Ferdinand VI, who appointed &quot;Ventura de Argumosa&quot; as the governor of the Royal Place.

Around the factory workers&#x27; dwellings were built, which resulted in the origin of the town. In front of the factory a great square was opened (at present named &quot;Plaza de España&quot;) which was linked with another now named &quot;Plaza de Fernando VI&quot;. The whole area has been recently declared a historic and artistic monument so it cannot be modified, to protect the original houses that still remain.

Throughout its 200-year history, the municipality has suffered ups and downs. Its emblematic building, the factory, has been intended for several uses, notably as a hospice. Currently only the main façade stands; has been restored and incorporated into the new city hall.

==Communications==
*Direct access form the A II (km 15) and the M-40 and M-45 highways (Exits 27 and 32, respectively)
*Public transport
**Bus from Madrid, (Avenida de América, Ciudad Líneal and Vicálvaro) línes 281 to 289)
**Also UR-2 and U-1 lines into the city.
**Metro station.

==Politics==

<text>Oakwood is a London Underground station. It is the second most northerly station on the Piccadilly line, between Southgate and Cockfosters stations, and is in Travelcard Zone 5. The station is on the edge of the Oakwood area of Enfield (N14) and is situated at the junction of Bramley Road (A110) and Chase Road (the other end of Chase Road is close to Southgate Underground station). This station has step-free access after the upgrades made to the station between October and December 2007.

==History==
The station opened on 13 March 1933 as part of the Cockfosters extension, its original name being &quot;Enfield West&quot;. The station did not appear on the original plans to extend the Piccadilly line beyond Finsbury Park, which only provided for seven additional stations, however it served as the line&#x27;s terminus for a brief period before Cockfosters station was opened.

The station building is a fine example of the architecture Charles Holden designed for the Piccadilly line extensions, with a large and imposing box-shaped ticket hall surrounded by lower structures containing shops. The ceiling of the booking hall is particularly monumental and bold. The whole design mirrors proportions found in classical architecture, albeit in a distinctly 20th century structure. The dimensions of the ticket hall are approximately a &quot;double-cube&quot; (its front elevation is roughly twice its height and width). The station is similar to Holden&#x27;s slightly earlier designs for Sudbury Town and Acton Town stations at the western end of Piccadilly line. Oakwood Station is a Grade II* listed building.

Like other extensions of the London Underground lines, the opening of the Cockfosters extension stimulated the rapid development of new suburbs and much of the open countryside that existed in 1930 when construction started was quickly covered by new housing developments.

==2006–07 upgrade==

In early October 2006 to December 2007, the station underwent an upgrade as part of London Underground&#x27;s £10billion upgrade to the whole of the London Underground Network. As part of this, a new lift was installed to provide step-free access to the platforms. The Public Address system was also improved, with new information indicators installed on the platforms and inside the ticket hall. In addition 27 new CCTV cameras were installed in the station bringing the total number to 29.

==Station name==

Before the station opened, the Underground Electric Railways Company of London (forerunner of London Underground) suggested names for it including &quot;Oakwood&quot;, &quot;Merryhills&quot; and &quot;East Barnet&quot;, but it was named &quot;Enfield West&quot; at opening and renamed &quot;Enfield West (Oakwood)&quot; the following year.

The Enfield West station name proved unpopular with passengers heading for shops and offices in Enfield, as it is about 2 miles away.

Following protests from Southgate Council, it was eventually renamed &quot;Oakwood&quot; on 1 September 1946.

==Operations==
Currently a few trains in the early morning and late evening enter/leave service at Oakwood, from Cockfosters Depot (which has an entrance point north of Oakwood station). There is additionally a crossover for trains to reverse, and the possibility of an extra platform built using an existing siding has been mooted to provide extra peak-hour reversing capacity.

==Connections==
*London Buses routes 121, 307 and 377 serve the station.

<doc id="817343" wikidata="Q945882" url="?curid=817343" title="Wood Green tube station">
<text>Wood Green is a London Underground station. It is on the Piccadilly line between Turnpike Lane and Bounds Green stations and is in Travelcard Zone 3. It is located at the junction of High Road, Wood Green and Lordship Lane. It serves Wood Green Shopping City and the nearby Haringey Council administrative complex as well as a densely populated residential area. It is also the closest tube station to Alexandra Palace.

==History==
The station opened on 19 September 1932 when the first section of the Cockfosters extension from Finsbury Park was opened.

Like all stations on the extension, Wood Green set new aesthetic standards, not previously seen on London&#x27;s Underground. When the Cockfosters extension was planned, alternative names for this station—&quot;Lordship Lane&quot; and &quot;Wood Green Central&quot;—were considered, but rejected. Architecturally, this station, designed by Charles Holden, is a well-preserved example of the modernist house style Holden developed for London Transport in the 1930s. Located on a corner site, the main frontage is curved and is flanked by two ventilation towers, although these are later additions to the station. On the northern side, the structure also incorporates a shop which forms part of the parade in High Road. The other end of the parade features a large London Underground sub-station.

Since July 2011, the station has been a grade II listed building, which now means every station building between Turnpike Lane and Cockfosters is listed.
The below surface areas of the station are tiled in biscuit-coloured tiles lined with green friezes. The station tunnels—in common with those of Manor House and Turnpike Lane—are diameter and were designed for the greater volume of traffic expected. In contrast, the platform tunnels at both Bounds Green and Southgate have a diameter of only . The construction of &quot;suicide pits&quot; between the rails was a new innovation.

To the north of the station is a reversing siding. This is used for reversing northbound trains so that they can return towards central London and Heathrow Airport or Uxbridge. Until the 1990s trains were regularly turned back here – now only one train per day Monday to Thursday is scheduled to reverse at Wood Green, with the siding used mostly in times of service disruption, or to regain time after late running.

On 16 March 1976, the station was the site of a Provisional IRA bombing, when a device exploded on an empty train as it prepared to enter the reversing siding, before heading west to pick up football supporters at Arsenal. There was one passenger standing on the platform and was injured by flying glass.

The National Rail station now called Alexandra Palace was formerly called Wood Green; it was renamed in 1984.

== Services ==

==Crossrail==
With the Chelsea-Hackney line, otherwise known as Crossrail 2 under discussion, proposals have included Wood Green as a possible station on a spur between Angel and Alexandra Palace stations. Wood Green station is a route option between New Southgate and Seven Sisters in the 2015 consultation.

<text>The National Policing Institute, formerly known as the Police Foundation, is an American non-profit organization dedicated to advancing policing through innovation and independent scientific research. It is headquartered in Arlington, Virginia.
== History ==
Since its creation in 1970 by the Ford Foundation, the National Policing Institute has conducted research in police behavior, policy, and procedure, and continues efforts in new evidence-based practices and innovations in policing.

The National Policing Institute has conducted studies and evaluations in policing, including the Kansas City preventive patrol experiment, that examined the effects of preventive patrol on crime, the Newark Foot Patrol Experiment that examined the effectiveness of foot patrol on reducing crime and Reducing the Fear of Crime in Houston and Newark, that assessed community perceptions of police and safety, and the Shift Length Experiment, which tested the impacts of different police shift lengths on patrol officers and agencies.

One early study, “Women in Policing,” that found significant underrepresentation among women in policing, leading the Institute to establish a Research Center on Women in Policing to encourage greater hiring of women in law enforcement.

Research supported by the National Policing Institute and conducted by collaborating scholars was also featured in Malcolm Gladwell’s book &quot;Talking to Strangers: What We Should Know About the People We Don’t Know&quot; and in TIME (November, 2022).

== Research, Evaluation, Training, and Technical Assistance Programs ==
The National Policing Institute has conducted research on many topics throughout its history, including police patrols, fear of crime, community policing, police accountability, and crime reduction approaches. 

Following the murder of George Floyd, the National Policing Institute&#x27;s Board or Directors authorized a $1 million campaign to support the Institute&#x27;s policing reforms agenda, including the creation of a Council on Policing Reforms and Race, the creation of a visiting scholar on policing, race, and crime position, and two research experiments related to improving understanding of police labor relations and agreements and the efficacy of civilian oversight bodies.

As of 2023, active research projects on hot spots policing, problem-oriented policing, procedural justice, alternative and crisis response strategies, disparities in stops and arrests, police supervision models, and use of force policies are underway. Training and technical assistance programs in areas including crisis response, gun violence reduction and gun crime investigation, officer safety, and rural crime reduction aim to improve responses to crime and victimization in communities throughout the U.S.

== Publications ==
The National Policing Institute maintains a publication library as well as specialized collections, such as the After Action Review Library and the OnPolicing blog. The Institute publishes an annual report detailing its key work and accomplishments, new publications and financial overviews.

== Organization ==
The National Policing Institute is overseen by an independent Board of Directors and led by its president, Jim Burch. As of 2022, the Institute had just over 50 staff members and an annual revenue of just over $14 million.

== Funding ==
The National Policing Institute was launched exclusively with private support from the Ford Foundation in 1970 but operates today with funding support from many public (federal, state and local governments) and private sources as well as donations.

<doc id="817351" wikidata="Q1757107" url="?curid=817351" title="Turnpike Lane tube station">
<text>Turnpike Lane is a London Underground station, located in Turnpike Lane in the London Borough of Haringey in North London, England. It is on the Piccadilly line between Manor House and Wood Green stations, and is in Travelcard Zone 3. The station was opened on 19 September 1932 as part of the Cockfosters extension. 

==History==
It was opened on 19 September 1932. It was the first Underground station in the Municipal Borough of Tottenham and was located at the meeting point of the boroughs of Tottenham, Hornsey and Wood Green, all now part of the London Borough of Haringey.

Like all stations on the Cockfosters extension, Turnpike Lane set new aesthetic standards not previously seen on the Underground. During the planning period for the extension to Cockfosters, two alternate names for this station, &quot;North Harringay&quot; and &quot;Ducketts Green&quot; (Ducketts Common is located opposite) were considered but rejected.

==Design==
The station was designed by the architect Charles Holden and is a well-preserved example of the modernist house style of London Transport in the 1930s. It was listed at Grade II in 1994. The ticket hall is an enormous brick box, with two large ventilation towers, half-sunk into the surrounding ground. Its high walls contain segmented windows that allow natural light to shine far into the station. The effect in late afternoon light is akin to that in a cathedral transept. Two of the street entrances gave access to the tram routes to and from Alexandra Palace via tramway island exits into Turnpike Lane. The tram services were withdrawn in 1938 and replaced by buses; these continued to use the tram islands until 1968, when they were removed.
The sub-surface areas are tiled in biscuit coloured tiles lined with yellow friezes. The booking hall is 12 feet (3.7 metres) below street level. In common with Manor House and Wood Green, the station tunnels have a diameter of 23 feet (7 metres) and were designed for the greater volume of traffic expected. Bounds Green and Southgate have only 21-foot (6.4 metres) diameter platform tunnels. The construction of &quot;suicide pits&quot; between the rails was also innovative. These were built in connection with a system of passageways under the platforms to give access to the track.

The station originally featured a large lamp standard and sign in the space in front of the station which was part of Holden&#x27;s original design, but this has since been removed.

==Bus station==
Turnpike Lane bus station is situated behind the tube station complex. It is owned and maintained by Transport for London. There are three stands at the bus station and the main operators that serve it are London General, Arriva London, Metroline and Sullivan Buses.

===History===
In the 1920s buses operated from a garage on the adjacent Whymark Avenue until in 1932 Turnpike Lane station was built. It was originally conceived as an integrated bus, train and tram station, with the bus interchange located behind the main building. It was roofed over in the 1960s.

By the 1990s the bus station was deemed too small, both for the number of buses using it and the increasing length of vehicles. A new bus station was thus built which involved demolishing an adjacent cinema to extend the hardstanding.
==Location==
It is located on the junction of, and directly serves, Turnpike Lane, Wood Green High Road Wood Green and Green Lanes.

London Buses routes 29, 41, 67, 121, 123, 141, 144, 184, 217, 221, 230, 231, 232, 329, 444 and W4 and night routes N29 and N91 serve the station.

==Future==
In May 2013, the government confirmed the station to be on its main consultation route for the Crossrail 2 proposal, to be on the blue-printed New Southgate branch.

==Popular culture==
The station is mentioned in the song &quot;Junkie Doll&quot; by Mark Knopfler on his album &quot;Sailing to Philadelphia&quot;, and also in &quot;Los Angeles Waltz&quot; by Razorlight on their self-titled album &quot;Razorlight&quot;.

<text>The concept of the innovation system stresses that the flow of technology and information among people, enterprises, and institutions is key to an innovative process. It contains the interactions between the actors needed in order to turn an idea into a process, product, or service on the market.

==Development and diffusion of the concept==
Systems of Innovation are frameworks for understanding innovation which have become popular particularly among policy makers and innovation researchers first in Europe, but now anywhere in the world as in the 1990s the World Bank and other UN-affiliated institutions accepted. The concept of a &#x27;system of innovation&#x27; was introduced by B.-Å. Lundvall in 1985; &quot;however, as he and his colleagues would be the first to agree (and as Lundvall himself points out), the idea actually goes back at least to Friedrich List&#x27;s conception of &quot;The National System of Political Economy&quot; (1841), which might just as well have been called &quot;The National System of Innovation&quot;. Christopher Freeman coined the expression &quot;National Innovation System&quot; in his 1988 study of the success of the Japanese economy.
The concept, similarly used as &quot;National System of Innovation&quot; or &quot;National Innovation System&quot; was later applied to regions and sectors. According to innovation system theory, innovation and technology development are results of a complex set of relationships among actors in the system, which includes enterprises, universities and research institutes.

Innovation systems have been categorised into national innovation systems, regional innovation systems, local innovation systems, technological innovation systems and sectoral innovation systems.

There is no consensus on the exact definition of an innovation system, and the concept is still emerging. However, some define an innovation system as &quot;a set of components and the causal relations influencing the generation and utilization of innovations and the innovative performance&quot;. Innovation is often the result of the interaction among an ecology of actors, and the term &quot;innovation ecosystem&quot; is occasionally used to emphasise this. For some, the expression &quot;innovation ecosystem&quot; is a subset or synonym of &quot;innovation system&quot;. Others separate between the expressions, using the expression &quot;innovation system&quot; for labelling a planned innovation environment, and &quot;innovation ecosystem&quot; for an ecological innovation environment. Due to growing interest of the &quot;innovation ecosystem&quot; concept, many argue that it has developed into a distinctive concept that is different from the innovation system concept. A contemporary conceptual review by Granstrand and Holgersson (2020) led to the definition of innovation ecosystems as &quot;the evolving set of actors, activities, and artifacts, and the institutions and relations, including complementary and substitute relations, that are important for the innovative performance of an actor or a population of actors&quot;. 

Recently, the debate also started to study the problems that affect green innovation since in addition to the issues typical of innovation generally (such as market failures related to limited appropriability of economic benefits of knowledge), green growth innovation is also hindered by market failures related to the environment (pollution externalities). It is possible (and not uncommon) for an innovation system to successfully support innovation in many technology areas, but not in ones related to green growth. For this reason, it is necessary to focus on addressing both kinds of failures in order to drive innovation towards a green growth trajectory.

== Standards of Innovation ==
The International Organization for Standardization published their standard ISO 56002, which contains all of the elements that is required to set up a structured management system for innovation. It builds on the overarching standard for management systems and follows the directives of all standard management systems. This standard was standardised into the European Norms and British Standards, and is known in the UK as BS EN ISO 56002:2019.

==Examples of definitions of National Innovation Systems ==
A national system of innovation has been defined as follows:

* &quot;... the network of institutions in the public and private sectors whose activities and interactions initiate, import, modify and diffuse new technologies.&quot; (Freeman, 1987)
* &quot;... the elements and relationships which interact in the production, diffusion and use of new, and economically useful, knowledge ... and are either located within or rooted inside the borders of a nation state.&quot; (Lundvall, 1992)
* &quot;... a set of institutions whose interactions determine the innovative performance ... of national firms.&quot; (Nelson, 1993)
* &quot;... the national institutions, their incentive structures and their competencies, that determine the rate and direction of technological learning (or the volume and composition of change generating activities) in a country.&quot; (Patel and Pavitt, 1994)
* &quot;... that set of distinct institutions which jointly and individually contribute to the development and diffusion of new technologies and which provides the framework within which governments form and implement policies to influence the innovation process. As such it is a system of interconnected institutions to create, store and transfer the knowledge, skills and artefacts which define new technologies.&quot; (Metcalfe, 1995)
* &quot;... all important economic, social, political, organisational, institutional, and other factors that influence the development, diffusion, and use of innovations.&quot; (Edquist, 2005).

* &quot;... a human social network that behaves like a sociobiological system, wherein people have developed patterns of behaviour that minimise transaction costs caused by social barriers resulting from geography, lack of trust, differences in language and culture, and inefficient social networks.&quot; (Hwang and Horowitt, 2012)

<text>Maurice Lindsay CBE (21 July 1918 – 30 April 2009) was a Scottish broadcaster, writer and poet. He was born in Glasgow. He was educated at The Glasgow Academy where he was a pupil from 1928-36. In later life, he served as an honorary governor of the school.

After serving in World War II, with the 7th Cameronians, he became a radio broadcaster, also editing the 1946 anthology &quot;Modern Scottish Poetry&quot;, and writing music criticism. He later was programme controller at Border Television.

In 1962, Scottish composer Thea Musgrave set five of his children&#x27;s poems in Scots to music for voice and piano, in a song cycle called &quot;A Suite o Bairnsangs&quot;.

His &quot;Collected Poems&quot; (1974) drew on 12 published collections. He wrote a number of other books, including one on Robert Burns and a seminal biography of the composer Francis George Scott and mid-twentieth century Scottish classical music, entitled &quot;Francis George Scott and the Scottish Renaissance&quot; (1980).

Dr Lindsay was director of the Scottish Civic Trust, president of the Association for Scottish Literary Studies from 1989 to 1993, and was honorary secretary-general of Europa Nostra.

<doc id="817358" wikidata="Q1549573" url="?curid=817358" title="Manor House tube station">
<text>Manor House is a London Underground station. It is on the Piccadilly line between Finsbury Park and Turnpike Lane stations, and is on the boundary between Travelcard Zone 2 and Zone 3. It straddles the border between the London Boroughs of Hackney and Haringey, the postal address and three of the entrances being in the former, and one entrance in the latter.

==Description==
The station is situated at the junction of Seven Sisters Road and Green Lanes. Named after the former public house that used to be located on the crossroads, it was designed by Charles Holden and opened on 19 September 1932. 

Like all stations on the Cockfosters extension, Manor House station set new aesthetic standards, not previously seen on London&#x27;s Underground. The sub-surface areas of the station were tiled in biscuit coloured tiles lined with blue friezes (refurbished in 2005).

When first constructed, the station was equipped with nine street level entrances, two of which gave access to tram routes to and from Tottenham, Edmonton and Stamford Hill via tramway island exits into Seven Sisters Road. The last of these tram services were withdrawn in 1938 and replaced by trolleybuses and the exits were removed in 1951.
The station tunnels have, in common with those of Turnpike Lane and Wood Green, a diameter of 23 feet (7 metres) and were designed for the greater volume of traffic expected. In contrast, Bounds Green and Southgate have only 21 foot (6.4 metres) diameter platform tunnels. The construction of &quot;suicide pits&quot; between the rails was also innovative. These were built in connection with a system of passageways under the platforms to give access to the track.

Next to the northern exit is the former Metropolitan Electric Tramways Headquarters (M.E.T) building, later the Eastern Divisional Office of London Transport Buses.

==Plan to transfer station to the Victoria line==
During the planning of the Victoria line, a proposal to transfer Manor House station to the Victoria line was put forward. New tunnels were also proposed for the Piccadilly line between Finsbury Park and Turnpike Lane, which would have considerably reduced the travelling time from outer North London to Central London. The inconvenience caused during re-construction, as well as the cost, ensured that the ideas were not pursued.

The Victoria line tunnels as built run underneath the station. At the northern end of the eastbound (towards Cockfosters) platform one can hear Victoria line trains running beneath.

==Connections==
London Buses routes 29, 141, 253, 254, 259, 279 and 341 and night routes N29, N253 and N279 serve the station.

<text>Program Manager is the shell of Windows 3.x and Windows NT 3.x operating systems. This shell exposed a task-oriented graphical user interface (GUI), consisting of &quot;icons&quot; (shortcuts for programs) arranged into &quot;program groups&quot;. It replaced MS-DOS Executive, a file manager, as the default Windows shell.

OS/2 2.0 and later included the Program Manager as part of its Win-OS/2 compatibility layer. Win-OS/2, including the Program Manager, are still included in later derivatives of OS/2 such as ArcaOS.

==Overview==
Program Manager descends from &quot;Desktop Manager&quot; (also known as Presentation Manager), the shell for OS/2 1.2. Unlike Desktop Manager, which presents its program groups in a simple list, and opens each group in a separate window, Program Manager opens program groups in child windows using the new multiple document interface in Windows 3.x. The icons used to represent Program Manager itself, program groups, and DOS applications in Windows 3.0 are carried over from OS/2 1.2. Windows 3.1 uses updated versions of these icons.

When executables were dropped into Program Manager from File Manager, Program Manager automatically used the executable&#x27;s default icon embedded as data inside the .EXE file. Additionally, the Windows Setup program, which populated Program Manager with the standard icons of a fresh install, could also be used to add new icons in bulk after installation. Using SETUP /P from the command line, a standard layout could be installed on many machines in an enterprise using a single SETUP.INF configuration file.

Beginning with Windows 3.1, Program Manager contained a StartUp group. Programs and files placed into that group would be loaded when Windows starts.

Holding down the shift key while selecting File then Exit Windows will save the current configuration of Program Manager to PROGMAN.INI, including the position of all program group icons, assuming that auto-arrange has been disabled. This allowed Microsoft testers to try many different configurations, but the feature remained in the shipped version.

In later versions of Microsoft Windows, starting with Windows 95 and Windows NT 4.0, Program Manager was replaced by Windows Shell. The Start menu, the Desktop, and the Taskbar took over program organization and launching duties.

Program Manager was still included in later versions of Windows, and could be accessed by executing codice_1 from the command line or &quot;Run&quot; dialog. It could be used as the default shell by specifying the &quot;Shell&quot; value in Windows Registry at either codice_2 (per machine) or codice_3 (per user).

Microsoft replaced Program Manager in Windows XP Service Pack 2 with a compatibility stub that simply redirects to Windows Explorer. In Windows Vista and later, codice_1 was permanently removed from the operating system.

<text>The Old Curiosity Shop is the fourth novel by English author Charles Dickens; being one of his two novels (the other being &quot;Barnaby Rudge&quot;) published along with short stories in his weekly serial &quot;Master Humphrey&#x27;s Clock&quot;, from 1840 to 1841. It was so popular that New York readers reputedly stormed the wharf when the ship bearing the final instalment arrived in 1841.

&quot;The Old Curiosity Shop&quot; was printed in book form in 1841. Queen Victoria read the novel that year and found it &quot;very interesting and cleverly written&quot;.

The plot follows the journey of Nell Trent and her grandfather, both residents of The Old Curiosity Shop in London, whose lives are thrown into disarray and destitution due to the machinations of an evil moneylender and the grandfather&#x27;s addiction to gambling.

==Plot==
=== Background ===
The events of the book seem to take place around 1825. 
* In Chapter 29, Miss Monflathers refers to the death of Lord Byron, who died on 19 April 1824. 
* When the inquest rules (incorrectly) that Quilp committed suicide, his corpse is ordered to be buried at a crossroads with a stake through the heart, a practice banned in 1823. 
* Nell&#x27;s grandfather, after his breakdown, fears that he shall be sent to a madhouse, and there chained to a wall and whipped; these practices went out of use after about 1830. 
* In Chapter 13, the lawyer Mr. Brass is described as &quot;one of Her Majesty&#x27;s attornies&quot; , putting him in the reign of Queen Victoria, which began in 1837, but given all the other evidence, and the fact that Kit, at his trial, is charged with acting &quot;against the peace of our Sovereign Lord the King&quot; (referring to William IV), this must be a slip of the pen.

===Synopsis===

&quot;The Old Curiosity Shop&quot; tells the story of Nell Trent, a beautiful and virtuous young girl of &quot;not quite fourteen&quot;. An orphan, she lives with her maternal grandfather (whose name is never revealed) in his shop of odds and ends. Her grandfather loves her dearly, and Nell does not complain, but she lives a lonely existence with almost no friends her own age. Her only friend is Kit, an honest boy employed at the shop, whom she is teaching to write.

Secretly obsessed with ensuring that Nell does not die in poverty as her parents did, her grandfather attempts to provide Nell with a good inheritance through gambling at cards. He keeps his nocturnal games a secret, but borrows heavily from the evil Daniel Quilp, a malicious, grotesquely deformed, hunchbacked dwarf moneylender. In the end, he gambles away what little money they have, and Quilp seizes the opportunity to take possession of the shop and evict Nell and her grandfather. Her grandfather suffers a breakdown that leaves him bereft of his wits, and Nell takes him away to the Midlands of England, to live as beggars.

Convinced that the old man has stored up a large fortune for Nell, her wastrel older brother, Frederick, convinces the good-natured but easily led Dick Swiveller to help him track Nell down, so that Swiveller can marry Nell and share her supposed inheritance with Frederick. To this end, they join forces with Quilp, who knows full well that there is no fortune, but sadistically chooses to &#x27;help&#x27; them in order to enjoy the misery it will inflict on all concerned.

Quilp begins to try to track Nell down, but the fugitives are not easily discovered. To keep Dick Swiveller under his eye, Quilp arranges for him to be taken as a clerk by Quilp&#x27;s lawyer, Mr. Brass. At the Brass firm, Dick befriends the mistreated maidservant and nicknames her &#x27;the Marchioness&#x27;.

Nell, having fallen in with a succession of characters, some villainous and some kind, finally succeeds in leading her grandfather to safety in a far-off village (identified by Dickens as Tong, Shropshire), but this comes at a considerable cost to Nell&#x27;s health.

Meanwhile, Kit has found new employment with the kind Mr and Mrs Garland. Here he is contacted by a mysterious &#x27;single gentleman&#x27; who is looking for news of Nell and her grandfather. The &#x27;single gentleman&#x27; and Kit&#x27;s mother go after them unsuccessfully, and encounter Quilp, who is also hunting for the runaways. Quilp forms a grudge against Kit and has him framed as a thief. Kit is sentenced to transportation. However, Dick Swiveller proves Kit&#x27;s innocence with the help of his friend the Marchioness. Quilp is hunted down and dies trying to escape his pursuers.

At the same time, a coincidence leads Mr Garland to knowledge of Nell&#x27;s whereabouts, and he, Kit, and the single gentleman (who turns out to be the younger brother of Nell&#x27;s grandfather) go to find her. Sadly, by the time they arrive, Nell has died as a result of her arduous journey. Her grandfather, already mentally infirm, refuses to admit she is dead and sits every day by her grave waiting for her to come back until, a few months later, he dies himself.

==Framing device==
&quot;Master Humphrey&#x27;s Clock&quot; was a weekly serial that contained both short stories and two novels (&quot;The Old Curiosity Shop&quot; and &quot;Barnaby Rudge&quot;). Some of the short stories act as frame stories to the novels.

Originally the conceit of the story was that Master Humphrey was reading it aloud to a group of his friends, gathered at his house around the grandfather clock in which he eccentrically kept his manuscripts. Consequently, when the novel begins, it is told in the first person, with Master Humphrey as the narrator. However, Dickens soon changed his mind about how best to tell the story, and abandoned the first-person narrator after chapter three. Once the novel was ended, &quot;Master Humphrey&#x27;s Clock&quot; added a concluding scene, where Master Humphrey&#x27;s friends (after he has finished reading the novel to them) complain that the &#x27;single gentleman&#x27; is never given a name; Master Humphrey tells them that the novel was a true story, that the &#x27;single gentleman&#x27; was in fact himself, and that the events of the first three chapters were fictitious, intended only to introduce the characters. This was Dickens&#x27;s after-the-fact explanation of why the narrator disappeared and why (if he was their near relation) he gave no sign in the first three chapters of knowing who they were. At least one editor thinks this device &quot;need not be taken seriously.&quot;

Dickens&#x27;s original artistic intent was to keep the short stories and the novels together, and the short stories and the novels were published in 1840 in three bound volumes under the title &quot;Master Humphrey&#x27;s Clock&quot;, which retains the original full and correct ordering of texts. However, Dickens himself cancelled &quot;Master Humphrey&#x27;s Clock&quot; before 1848, and describes in a preface to &quot;The Old Curiosity Shop&quot; that he wishes the story to not be tied down to the miscellany within which it began. Most later anthologies published the short stories and the novels separately.

==Characters==

===Major===

*Nell Trent, the novel&#x27;s main character. Portrayed as infallibly good and angelic, she leads her grandfather on their journey to save them from misery. Her health gradually becomes weaker throughout the journey.
*Nell&#x27;s Grandfather, Nell&#x27;s guardian. After losing both his wife and daughter, he sees Nell as the embodiment of their good spirits. His grandson Fred is seen as the successor to his son-in-law, who he felt unworthy of his daughter. As such, he shows him no affection. He is paranoid about falling into poverty and gambles to try to stave that off; as his money runs out, he turns to Quilp for loans to continue to furnish for Nell the life he feels she deserves. After believing Kit has revealed his secret addiction, he falls ill and is mentally unstable afterwards. Nell then protects him as he had done for her.
*Christopher &quot;Kit&quot; Nubbles, Nell&#x27;s friend and servant. He watches out for Nell when she is left in the shop alone at night (although she doesn&#x27;t know he&#x27;s there) and will &#x27;never come home to his bed until he thinks she safe in hers&#x27;. After Quilp takes over the shop, Kit offers Nell a place in his house. His mother is concerned about his attachment to Nell, and at one point jokes, &#x27;some people would say that you&#x27;d fallen in love with her&#x27;, at which Kit becomes very bashful and tries to change the subject. He is later given a position at the Garlands&#x27; house, and becomes an important member of their household. His dedication to his family earns him the respect of many characters and the resentment of Quilp. He is framed for robbery, but is later released and joins the party traveling to recover Nell.

*Daniel Quilp, the novel&#x27;s primary villain. He mistreats his wife, Betsy, and manipulates others to his own ends through a false charm he has developed over the years. He lends money to Nell&#x27;s grandfather and takes possession of the curiosity shop during the old man&#x27;s illness (which he had caused by revealing his knowledge of the old man&#x27;s bad gambling habit). He uses sarcasm to belittle those he wishes to control, most notably his wife, and takes a sadistic delight in the suffering of others. He eavesdrops so as to know all of &#x27;the old man&#x27;s&#x27; most private thoughts, and teases him, saying &#x27;you have no secrets from me now&#x27;. He also drives a wedge between Kit and the old man (and as a result between Kit and Nell) by pretending it was Kit who told him about the gambling.
*Richard &quot;Dick&quot; Swiveller, in turn, Frederick Trent&#x27;s manipulated friend, Sampson Brass&#x27;s clerk, and the Marchioness&#x27; guardian and eventual husband. He delights in quoting and adapting literature to describe his experiences. He is very laid-back and doesn&#x27;t seem to worry about anything, despite the fact that he owes money to just about everybody. Following Fred&#x27;s departure from the story, he becomes more independent and eventually is seen as a strong force for good, securing Kit&#x27;s release from prison and the Marchioness&#x27;s future. His transformation from an idle and vacant youth to a key helpmate bridges the depiction of the main characters that are either mostly villainous or goodly in nature.
*The Single Gentleman, who is never named, is the estranged younger brother of Nell&#x27;s grandfather. He leads the search for the travelers after taking lodging in Sampson Brass&#x27; rooms and befriending Dick, Kit, and the Garlands.

===Minor===
*Mrs. Betsy Quilp, Quilp&#x27;s mistreated wife. She is mortally afraid of her husband but appears to love him in spite of everything, as she was genuinely worried when he disappeared for a long period.
*Mr. Sampson Brass, an attorney (what would now be called a solicitor) of the Court of the King&#x27;s Bench. A grovelling, obsequious man, he is an employee of Mr. Quilp, at whose urging he frames Kit for robbery.
*Miss Sarah &quot;Sally&quot; Brass, Mr. Brass&#x27; obnoxious sister and clerk. She is the real authority in the Brass firm. She is occasionally referred to as a &quot;dragon&quot;, and she mistreats the Marchioness. Quilp makes amorous advances towards her, but is rebuffed.
*Mrs. Jarley, proprietor of a travelling waxworks show, who takes in Nell and her grandfather out of kindness. However, she only appears briefly.
*Frederick Trent, Nell&#x27;s worthless older brother, who is convinced that his grandfather is secretly wealthy (when in actuality he was the primary cause of the old man&#x27;s poverty, according to the single gentleman). Initially a major character in the novel and highly influential over Richard Swiveller, he is dropped from the narrative after chapter 23. Briefly mentioned as travelling to Great Britain and the wider world following his disappearance from the story, before being found injured and drowned in the River Seine after the story&#x27;s conclusion. The character was named after the novelist&#x27;s younger brother, Frederick Dickens.
*Mr. Garland, a kind-hearted man, father of Abel Garland and employer of Kit.
*The Small Servant, Miss Brass&#x27; maidservant. Dick Swiveller befriends her and, finding that she does not know her age or name (Sally Brass simply refers to her as &quot;Little Devil&quot;) or parents, nicknames her &quot;The Marchioness&quot; and later gives her the name Sophronia Sphynx. In the original manuscript, it is made explicit that the Marchioness is in fact the illegitimate daughter of Miss Brass, possibly by Quilp, but only a suggestion of this survived in the published edition.
*Isaac List and Joe Jowl, professional gamblers. They are fellow guests at the public house where Nell and her grandfather, unable to get home, pass a stormy night. Nell&#x27;s grandfather is unable to resist gambling with them and fleeces Nell of what little money she has to this end. That same night, he also robs her of even more money.
*Mr. Chuckster, the dogsbody of the notary Mr. Witherden, who employs Mr. Abel Garland. He takes a strong dislike to Kit after Mr. Garland overpays Kit for a job and Kit returns to work off the difference; he shows his dislike at every opportunity, calling Kit &#x27;Snobby&#x27;.
*Mr. Marton, a poor schoolmaster. He befriends Nell and later inadvertently meets her and her grandfather on the roads. Nell approaches him to beg for alms, not realising who he is. She faints from a combination of shock and exhaustion, and, realising she is ill, he takes her to an inn and pays for the doctor, and then takes her and her grandfather to live with him in the distant village where he has been appointed parish clerk.
*Thomas Codlin, proprietor of a travelling Punch and Judy show.
*Mr. Harris, called &#x27;Short Trotters&#x27;, the puppeteer of the Punch and Judy show.
*Barbara, the maidservant of Mr. and Mrs. Garland and future wife of Kit.
*The Bachelor, brother of Mr. Garland. Lives in the village where Nell and her grandfather end their journey, and unknowingly alerts his brother to their presence through a letter.
*Mrs. Jiniwin, Mrs. Quilp&#x27;s mother and Quilp&#x27;s mother-in-law. She resents Quilp for the way he treats her daughter, but is too afraid to stand up to him.

==Literary significance and criticism==
Probably the most widely repeated criticism of Dickens is the remark reputedly made by Oscar Wilde that &quot;one must have a heart of stone to read the death of little Nell without laughing.&quot; Nell&#x27;s deathbed is not actually described, however. Of a similar opinion was the poet Algernon Swinburne, who commented that &quot;a child whom nothing can ever irritate, whom nothing can even baffle, whom nothing can ever misguide, whom nothing can ever delude, and whom nothing can ever dismay, is a monster as inhuman as a baby with two heads&quot;.

The Irish leader Daniel O&#x27;Connell famously burst into tears at the finale, and threw the book out of the window of the train in which he was travelling.

The excitement surrounding the conclusion of the series was unprecedented. (However, stories that Dickens fans stormed the docks in New York City, eager for the latest installment of the novel, or news of it, are apocryphal.) In 2007, many newspapers claimed that the excitement at the release of the last instalment of &quot;The Old Curiosity Shop&quot; was the only historical comparison that could be made to the excitement at the release of the last Harry Potter novel, &quot;Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows&quot;.

The Norwegian author Ingeborg Refling Hagen is said to have buried a copy of the book in her youth, stating that nobody deserved to read about Nell, because nobody would ever understand her pain. She compared herself to Nell, because of her own miserable situation at the time.

==Allusions to actual history and geography==

===The Old Curiosity Shop===
A shop named &quot;The Old Curiosity Shop&quot; can be found at 13–14 Portsmouth Street, Holborn, London, WC2A 2ES, and is now owned by the London School of Economics. The building dates back to the sixteenth century (1567) in an area known as Clare Market, but the shop name was added after the novel was released, as it was thought to be the inspiration for Dickens&#x27;s description of the antique shop. At one time it functioned as a dairy on an estate given by King Charles II to one of his many mistresses. It was built using timber from old ships, and survived the bombs of World War II. The shop was restored in 2023 to repair structural problems and will be rented out again as a shop.

===The Route They Took===
* Nell and her grandfather meet Codlin and Short in a churchyard in Aylesbury.
* The horse races where Nell and her grandfather go with the show people are at Banbury.
* The village where they first meet the schoolmaster is Warmington, Warwickshire.
* They meet Mrs. Jarley near the village of Gaydon, Warwickshire.
* The town where they work at Jarley&#x27;s Waxworks is Warwick.
* The heavily industrialised town where Nell spends the night by the furnace is Birmingham (after they have travelled on the Warwick and Birmingham Canal).
* The town in which Nell faints and is rescued by the school master is Wolverhampton in the Black Country.
* The village where they finally find peace and rest and where Nell dies is Tong, Shropshire.

Other real locations used in the novel include London Bridge, Bevis Marks, Finchley, and Minster-on-Sea.

It is reported by local Coventry historian David McGrory that Charles Dickens used Coventry&#x27;s Whitefriars gatehouse in &quot;The Old Curiosity Shop&quot;. This gatehouse building still exists in Much Park Street.&lt;br&gt;
==Adaptations ==
Lotta Crabtree performed for years as Nell in &quot;Little Nell and the Marchioness&quot;.

* There were several silent film adaptations of the novel including two directed by Thomas Bentley:
** &quot;The Old Curiosity Shop&quot; (1914)

<doc id="817371" wikidata="Q7960386" url="?curid=817371" title="Wait Listing Service">
<text>A wait-listing service (WLS) provided by a domain name registry provides the ability to option a domain name that is already registered. The option-holder then has the ability to have first rights to that domain name if the current registrant should cancel their registration.

Taking such an option is no guarantee a person will be able to register the domain name, merely that the person will be able to if the domain name becomes otherwise available. If the existing holder continues to renew their domain name, the option-holder will never get the domain through the procedure.

A move to introduce this service by ICANN-accredited registries drew fire in 2003 as anti-competitive. Currently domain name registrars provide a similar, non-guaranteed service by continually querying the registry if a domain name is available. If it should become available, the registrar quickly tries to register the domain to the new party. The consequence of this process is that, if multiple registrars are vying for the domain, the beneficiary of the new domain name may come down to luck and circumstance.

== ICANN proposal ==
The Waiting List Service was proposed as an ICANN service by Verisign on March 21, 2002, and requested ICANN to include the WLS in the .com and .net registry agreements for a $35 subscription fee.

<doc id="817392" wikidata="Q1443637" url="?curid=817392" title="Tetralogy">
<text>A tetralogy (from Greek τετρα- &quot;&quot;, &quot;four&quot; and -λογία &quot;-logia&quot;, &quot;discourse&quot;) is a compound work that is made up of four distinct works. The name comes from the Attic theater, in which a tetralogy was a group of three tragedies followed by a satyr play, all by one author, to be played in one sitting at the Dionysia as part of a competition.

==Examples==
===Literature===
* Tetrateuch is a sometime name for the first four books of the Bible. The Tetrateuch plus Deuteronomy are collectively referred to as the Pentateuch. 
* &quot;Tintitives&quot; by Antiphon of Rhamnus; the author was an orator, and &quot;Tintitives&quot; is a kind of textbook for students. Each book consists of four speeches: the prosecutor&#x27;s opening speech, the first speech for the defense, the prosecutor&#x27;s reply, and the defendant&#x27;s conclusion. Three of his tetralogies are known to have survived.
* The traditional arrangement of the works of Plato into nine tetralogies, including some doubtful works, and the Letters as a single work. 
* The &quot;Henriad&quot;, two tetralogies of history plays of William Shakespeare. The First Tetralogy in order of composition begins with the three Henry VI plays. The Second Tetralogy finishes with the history of Henry V.

==Other information==
In the early modern period of literature, Shakespeare drafted a pair of tetralogies, the first consisting of the three &quot;Henry VI&quot; plays and &quot;Richard III&quot;, and the second, what we now call a prequel because it is set earlier, consisting of &quot;Richard II&quot;, the two &quot;Henry IV&quot; plays, and &quot;Henry V&quot;.

As an alternative to &quot;tetralogy&quot;, &quot;quartet&quot; is sometimes used, particularly for series of four books. The term &quot;quadrilogy&quot;, using the Latin prefix quadri- instead of the Greek, and first recorded in 1865, has also been used for marketing the &quot;Alien&quot; movies.

<doc id="817396" wikidata="Q2001958" url="?curid=817396" title="Kill switch">
<text>A kill switch, also known more formally as an emergency brake, emergency stop (E-stop), emergency off (EMO), or emergency power off (EPO), is a safety mechanism used to shut off machinery in an emergency, when it cannot be shut down in the usual manner. Unlike a normal shut-down switch or shut-down procedure, which shuts down all systems in order and turns off the machine without damage, a kill switch is designed and configured to abort the operation as quickly as possible (even if it damages the equipment) and to be operated simply and quickly (so that even a panicked operator with impaired executive functions or a bystander can activate it). Kill switches are usually designed to be noticeable, even to an untrained operator or a bystander.

Some kill switches feature a removable, protective barrier against accidental activation (e.g. a plastic cover that must be lifted or glass that must be broken), known as a. Kill switches are features of mechanisms whose normal operation or foreseeable misuse might cause injury or death; industrial designers include kill switches because damage to or the destruction of the machinery is less important than preventing workplace injuries and deaths.

A similar system, usually called a dead man&#x27;s switch, is a device intended to stop a machine (or activate one) if the human operator becomes incapacitated or leaves the machine unattended, and is a form of fail-safe. They are commonly used in industrial applications (e.g., locomotives, tower cranes, freight elevators) and consumer applications (e.g., lawn mowers, tractors, personal watercraft, outboard motors, snow blowers, motorcycles and snowmobiles). The switch in these cases is held by the user, and turns off the machine if they let go. Some riding lawnmowers have a kill switch in the seat which stops the engine and blade if the operator&#x27;s weight is no longer on the seat.

==Vehicles==

On railways, an emergency stop is a full application of the brakes in order to bring a train to a stop as quickly as possible. This occurs either by a manual emergency stop activation, such as a button being pushed on the train to start the emergency stop, or on some trains automatically, when the train has passed a red signal or the driver has failed to respond to warnings to check that they are still alert, which is known as a dead man&#x27;s switch. A similar mechanism is the watchdog timer.

In large ships, an emergency stop button pulls the countershaft for the fuel pumps to the stop position, cutting off the fuel supply and stopping the engines. With a controllable-pitch propeller, the stop button may declutch the engine from the propeller.

NASCAR requires all their stock cars to be equipped with a steering wheel–mounted kill switch, in case the accelerator pedal sticks and the driver needs to shut down the engine.

A related concept is the dead man&#x27;s switch, where the operator must be holding a button or lever any time the vehicle is operating. A common example of this is the kill switches used by boaters and jetskiers wherein a cord connects the kill switch to the operator (usually by the operator&#x27;s life jacket or clothing), and if the operator is thrown overboard in an accident, the cord will pull the switch and immediately shut down the vessel&#x27;s engine. This prevents it from becoming a runaway vessel that could impose a danger to other vessels or swimmers at sea, and allows the operator to swim back to the vessel and re-board it without the risk of being injured by the boat&#x27;s propeller. A similar device is featured on most lawnmowers: a lever on the handle either disables the ignition system and applies a brake to the flywheel (on a gasoline lawnmower), or cuts the power to the motor (on an electric lawnmower), as long as it is not held down.

Monster Truck Racing Association requires all of their monster trucks to be equipped with kill switches (either remote or in cab), in case the monster truck loses control and the driver needs to shut off the engine. Monster trucks&#x27; kill switches are tested before races. 

===Pioneer-era planes and World War I aircraft===
Early aviators using rotary engine–powered aircraft from the beginnings of their use in 1908, up through the end of World War I in 1918 had what could be called a reversed functionality version of the &quot;dead man&#x27;s switch&quot; for cutting the ignition voltage to the spark plugs on such a power-plant, to give a degree of in-flight speed control for a rotary engine. This was often called a &quot;blip switch&quot; or &quot;coupe switch&quot; (from the French term , or &quot;cut&quot;) and when not being pressed, allowed the high voltage from the engine&#x27;s magnetos to operate the ignition with normal engine operation in flight—pressing the &quot;blip switch&quot; cut the flow of high voltage from the magnetos, stopping the combustion process in the cylinders. When such a &quot;blip switch&quot; was intermittently used on landing approach, this allowed a limited degree of engine speed control, as rotary engines generally did not have a conventional throttle in their carburettors to regulate engine speed, but only for governing the fuel-air ratio for start-up and full-speed operation.

==Anti-theft==
Kill switches are also used on land vehicles as an anti-theft system and as an emergency power off. Such devices are often placed in bait cars and configured so that observing police can trigger the switch remotely. This same idea can make the stolen object, such as a smartphone, useless to both the thief and whoever buys it, yet allow the true owner to reactivate it when/if it is recovered.

===Smartphones===

In smartphones, a kill switch is a security feature that allows the phone&#x27;s owner to remotely render the smartphone inoperable if it is lost or stolen. From 2015 this feature is legally required in California for smartphones. There are also &quot;hardware kill switches&quot; on some phones, such as PinePhone, where the user can, by moving a hardware switch inside the phone, disable hardware like the camera, microphone, Wi-Fi or LTE.
===Software===
: &quot;See also Brick (electronics) – an electronic device that can no longer function due to software malfunction&quot;

By analogy to physical kill switches, &quot;kill switch&quot; can be used to refer to a mechanism incorporated in software that can be activated by its manufacturer or licensor, for example if the product is withdrawn, or a maintenance fee has not been paid, or a device has been lost or stolen. It can also refer to kill switches for the stopping of malware such as in the WannaCry ransomware attack. 

There is a debate about implementing kill switches in robots and advanced artificial intelligence systems.

====In AI====

Google started to work on a hardware kill switch for AI in 2016.

==Industrial machinery==

On large industrial machines, an emergency stop button is typically located on the panel, and possibly in several other areas of the machine. Often, an emergency stop is made wireless using a remote control. This provides a rapid means to disconnect the energy source of the device to protect workers. For fail-safe operation, the emergency stop button is a normally closed switch, which ensures that a broken wire will not prevent it from being activated, but may accidentally activate the emergency stop.

In the European Union, most types of machinery are required to be equipped with an emergency stop according to the Directive 2006/42/EC. Exceptions apply for machinery in which an emergency stop would not lessen the risk as well as for portable hand-held/hand-guided machinery.

===Nuclear power plants===

A kill switch in a nuclear reactor plant is called SCRAM. It is usually characterized as an acronym for &quot;safety control rod axe man&quot;, though this is probably a backronym.

==Machine tools==
Emergency stop functions are frequently used on machine tools, including equipment like wood and metal sawing machines, grinding machines, drilling machines, milling machines and machining centres and lathes. The emergency stop safety function, and general requirements for emergency stop devices are set out in ISO 13850. Machine specific (type-C) standards often include specific requirements for the emergency stop functions, but in the absence of a relevant type-C standard, the risk assessment should be used to determine whether or not an emergency stop function would be useful in avoiding or limiting harm. The ISO machinery safety standard types are defined in ISO 12100, and this nomenclature is used by other standards development organizations, like ANSI in the US, and CSA in Canada.

===Complementary protective measure===

A machinery&#x27;s emergency stop control is considered a complementary protective measure because it is intended to complement the primary safeguarding measures like fixed guards, movable interlocked guards or safeguarding devices. The primary safeguarding measures prevent injury automatically, either by enforcing distance between a hazard and a person, or by eliminating the hazard by stopping hazardous motion or switching off a source of hazardous energy.

By contrast, an emergency stop requires a deliberate action on the part of a person who must first recognize that some hazardous condition is about to arise or is arising, and who then must activate the emergency stop function by pressing the emergency stop button or activating another emergency stop device such as a pull-cord switch.

==Fuel stations and road vehicles==
A kill switch is also used for gasoline pumps or any other device that pumps large amounts of explosive or flammable chemicals. There is commonly a single kill switch for all pumps at a pumping station.

==Elevators and escalators==
Elevators often have a red two-way button on the control panel which is either marked &quot;Emergency Stop&quot; or &quot;Run/Stop&quot;. Normally, the button is in the &quot;up&quot; or unpushed position, allowing the elevator to &quot;run&quot; in normal service. When the button is pushed, the elevator comes to an immediate stop. When the button is pulled back out, it resumes normal service, thus the reason for the use of the phrase &quot;Run/Stop&quot;. Escalators will typically have a key-operated control that will turn the escalator off, or change its direction to up or down. Next to the key switch will be a red &quot;Emergency Stop&quot; button, which is used in the event of equipment failure, or where there is a potential for injury, such as when someone&#x27;s shoe gets stuck in the &quot;comb&quot; at the top or bottom of the escalator and there is a risk of serious injury. The key switch is used to return the escalator to service after it has been stopped.

==Gym==
Treadmills often use a safety key with one end magnetically attached to the machine and the other end clipped to the user&#x27;s waist. If the safety key is pulled out, such as in the event of a fall, the treadmill stops immediately. In other cases, some other treadmills have a more traditional kill switch, often mounted towards the rear of one of the hand railings.

==Amusement rides==
The emergency stop on an amusement ride is similar to that on industrial equipment. Typically brakes on a ride are designed to be disengaged when power is applied; disconnecting power will cause all brakes to engage. Most amusement rides have a computer that can, similar to the rail example provided above, engage the emergency stop when such a ride is determined to be out of operating specification, or an accident involving a passenger or ride employee has happened.

==Spaceflight==
Range safety systems can automatically destroy errant vehicles in-flight. Range-safety officers may also manually destroy vehicles; this method was used to destruct errant solid rocket boosters in the Space Shuttle &quot;Challenger&quot; disaster.

<doc id="817400" wikidata="Q1535683" url="?curid=817400" title="Sea Islands">
<text>The Sea Islands are a chain of over a hundred tidal and barrier islands on the Atlantic Ocean coast of the Southeastern United States, between the mouths of the Santee and St. Johns rivers along South Carolina, Georgia and Florida. The largest is Johns Island, South Carolina. Sapelo Island is home to the Gullah people. All of the islands are acutely threatened by sea level rise due to climate change.

==History==
Settled by indigenous cultures thousands of years ago, the islands were selected by Spanish colonists as sites for founding of colonial missions. Historically the Spanish influenced the Guale and Mocama chiefdoms by establishing Christian missions in their major settlements, from St. Catherine&#x27;s Island south to Fort George Island (at present-day Jacksonville, Florida). 

Both chiefdoms extended to the coastal areas on the mainland. The Mocama Province included territory to the St. Johns River in present-day Florida. The mission system ended under pressure of repeated raids by English South Carolina colonists and Indian allies. Spain ceded its territory of Florida to Great Britain in 1763.
After 18th-century European-American settlement of Georgia and Florida, planters purchased and enslaved Africans for labor. Many were used to work the labor-intensive cotton, rice, and indigo plantations on the Sea Islands, which generated much of the wealth of the colony and state. The Sea Islands were known historically for the production of Sea Island cotton. The enslaved workers developed the notable and distinct Gullah culture and language which has survived to contemporary times.
During the American Civil War, the Union Navy and the Union Army soon occupied the islands. The white planter families had fled to other locations on the mainland, sometimes leaving behind their slaves. The slaves largely ran their own lives during this period. They had already created cohesive communities, because planter families often stayed on the mainland to avoid malaria and the isolation of the islands. Large numbers of slaves worked on the rice and indigo plantations, and had limited interaction with whites, which enabled them to develop their own distinct culture. During the war, the Union Army managed the plantations and assigned plots of land to slaves for farming.
After President Abraham Lincoln&#x27;s Emancipation Proclamation became effective on January 1, 1863, more than 5,000 slaves on Union-occupied islands obtained their freedom. After the war, although the freedmen hoped to be given land as compensation for having worked it for so many years in slavery, the federal government generally returned properties to the planters returning from their refuges or exile. Many of the freedmen stayed in the area, working on their former plantations as sharecroppers, tenant farmers or laborers as the system changed to free labor.

The area was home to multiple plantations; in 1863 Fanny Kemble published &quot;Journal of a Residence on a Georgian Plantation in 1838–1839&quot; about her experience on her husband&#x27;s plantations in St. Simon&#x27;s Island and Butler Island.

After President Abraham Lincoln&#x27;s Emancipation Proclamation became effective on January 1, 1863, more than 5,000 slaves on Union-occupied islands obtained their freedom.

In 1893, a deadly major hurricane struck the Sea Islands.

<text>Giuseppe Guerini (born 14 February 1970) is a retired Italian professional road bicycle racer. He was known throughout his career as a climbing specialist and had pronounced success in cycling&#x27;s Grand Tour events. He completed six editions of the Tour de France, five Vuelta a Españas and four Giros, managing two third-place finishes in the 1997 and 1998 Giro d&#x27;Italia.

He began his professional career in 1993 with Navigare and subsequently joined Team Polti in 1996. It was during his tenure with team Polti that he achieved two podium finishes at the Giro d&#x27;Italia. He then switched to the German T-Mobile Team from 1999 to 2007. He retired from cycling at the end of 2007.

Further career highlights include a stage win in the 1998 Route du Sud, a stage win in the 1998 Volta a Portugal, a stage win in the 1999 Tour de France and again in the 2005 Tour de France, a stage win in the 2002 Catalan Week, and second place in the 2003 Tour de Suisse.

He is also remembered for an incident during the difficult Alpe d&#x27;Huez stage of the 1999 Tour de France. Guerini was leading the field and only a few hundred meters from the finish line when a cycling fan knocked him off his bicycle while attempting to take a photograph. Guerini was able to remount his bicycle and finish 21 seconds ahead of Pavel Tonkov.

Guerini is a native of Gazzaniga, Lombardy.

<text>Descriptions des Arts et Métiers, faites ou approuvées par messieurs de l&#x27;Académie Royale des Sciences (French for &quot;Descriptions of the Arts and Trades, made under the direction of the gentlemen of the Royal Academy of Sciences&quot;), is a collection of books on crafts that was published by the Parisian Royal Academy of Sciences between 1761 and 1788. The full series comprises 113 folio volumes along with three supplements, and provide detailed accounts of a wide range of handcraft and manufacturing processes carried out in France at that time. The volumes are well-illustrated, with precise engravings by Jean Elie Bertrand (1737–1779) a noted typographer from Neuchâtel, where the printing was done. Many of them provide the background for shorter articles in Diderot&#x27;s &quot;Encyclopedia&quot;, which was appearing at much the same time.

The project had its origin in request from Colbert in 1675 to the Academy Royal des Sciences for detailed accounts of various mechanic arts to be prepared and for new machines to be reported upon. This led to the formation of the Bignon Commission under Abbé Bignon. René-Antoine Ferchault de Réaumur (1683–1757) became editor soon after he joined the academy. He inherited number of drawings (the earliest prepared in 1693) and an illustrated manuscript on printing, type and book binding, which had been prepared in 1704. It was left to Réaumur&#x27;s successor Duhamel du Monceau to bring about the publication of the series, probably as the result of the competition from the &quot;Encyclopedia&quot;.

The articles and engravings in the &quot;Descriptions&quot; are more detailed and accurate than those in the &quot;Encyclopedia&quot;, and so are of more value for technical historians today. There is evidence that proofs of some 150 plates were stolen by agents of Diderot who had them re-engraved for his project. There is a similarity between many of the plates used in the two works.

The first of the volumes appeared in 1761, and the last in 1788.

<text>Ballsh () is a town and a former municipality in Fier County, southern Albania. At the 2015 local government reform it became a subdivision and the seat of the municipality Mallakastër. It was the seat of the former District of Mallakastër. The population at the 2011 census was 7,657.

==Name==
It was centre of Malkasra (Turkish of &quot;Mallakastër&quot;) kaza in Sanjak of Berat in Yanya Vilayet during Ottoman rule between 1670 and 1912. Its name evolved from the name of the ancient town Byllis, located in proximity of Ballsh. Church sources report the variants &quot;Byllis&quot;, &quot;Bellis&quot;, &quot;Ballis&quot; and &quot;Vallis&quot;.

==History==
Ballsh is close to the ancient city of Byllis, a city during the Illyria era. The Slavic invasions of the 6th and 7th centuries caused the decline of Byllis while Ballsh was built with materials plundered from Byllis.
==Economy==
The city&#x27;s surrounding fields are rich in crude petroleum and are dotted by a series of oil wells established during the socialist era. Only a fraction of these wells are operating today, but the city includes a working refinery, and outputs of naphthas are significant.

The refinery was owned by Taçi Oil through ARMO (Anika Mercuria Refinery Associated Oil, owned by Anika Enterprises). In 2013 ARMO was sold to Heaney Assets Corporation, an Azerbaijan corporation.

==Sports==
The city&#x27;s team KS Bylis Ballsh, plays at the Adush Muça Stadium.

<doc id="817428" wikidata="Q721113" url="?curid=817428" title="Evolution (professional wrestling)">
<text>Evolution was a villainous American professional wrestling stable in WWE which was a part of the Raw brand from 2003 to 2005, as well as during 2007 and 2014. They are widely regarded as one of the greatest wrestling stables of all time.

At the height of its original existence, the group consisted of Triple H, Ric Flair, Randy Orton and Batista. The group has been referred to as a modern iteration of Flair&#x27;s former stable, The Four Horsemen. Evolution slowly began dissolving after SummerSlam 2004, when Orton won the World Heavyweight Championship and was kicked out of the group. After winning the Royal Rumble in 2005, Batista turned on Triple H and decided to pursue the World Heavyweight Championship himself. Although Batista&#x27;s departure was largely the end for the group, the final break up came when Triple H turned on and attacked Flair. During the breakup, each member faced one another at least once.

Evolution later reformed on April 14, 2014 as a sub-group to The Authority after Batista joined forces with Triple H and Orton. Evolution Reunited on the 1000th Episode of Smackdown 

== Concept ==
Each member of Evolution represented the best in: &quot;the past&quot; (Ric Flair), &quot;the present&quot; (Triple H), and &quot;the future&quot; (Randy Orton and Batista) of professional wrestling. Triple H would reveal on his 2013 &quot;Triple H - Thy Kingdom Come&quot; DVD that Mark Jindrak was originally planned to be in the group in Batista&#x27;s role as the Arn Anderson-like enforcer, with Jindrak even shooting vignettes with the rest of the group, before it was decided to make Batista part of the group instead. This was further elaborated in 2020, when it was revealed that Vince McMahon wanted Jindrak in the group to replace Batista due to his triceps injuries in 2003. However, Triple H felt that Jindrak was not mature enough for the group and also felt that he was dragging Orton down, an assessment mutually agreed by Jindrak himself. Ultimately, management decided to place Jindrak in a tag team with Garrison Cade while the rest of Evolution waited for Batista to return to health, which proved to work out for all parties involved, including Jindrak, who would become a major star in Mexico following his WWE departure in 2005.

Flair&#x27;s character trademarks of coming out in suits and being a noted Playboy, along with his and Triple H&#x27;s trademark heel ruthlessness, were traits that carried over into the entire stable, both during and for a couple of years after Evolution.

== History ==
===Original run (2002–2005)===
==== Formation (2002–2003)====

At Unforgiven on September 22, 2002, Triple H defended the World Heavyweight Championship against Rob Van Dam. During the match, Ric Flair, who had been verbally mocked by Triple H in the locker room earlier in the night following Flair&#x27;s loss to Chris Jericho, came down to the ring and grabbed the sledgehammer from Triple H and teased hitting him before hitting Van Dam instead, allowing Triple H to get the win. From that point on, Flair accompanied Triple H to the ring as his manager. Shortly thereafter, Batista moved from &quot;SmackDown!&quot; to &quot;Raw&quot; and Flair also began accompanying him to the ring as a manager and mentor while continuing to second Triple H. On the January 20, 2003 episode of &quot;Raw&quot;, Randy Orton, who had been out of action due to a shoulder injury, returned and joined Triple H, Flair, and Batista in attacking Scott Steiner to complete the group. Two weeks later, the group officially got its name when Triple H, after the group jumped Tommy Dreamer, spoke about how the four men were examples of pro wrestling&#x27;s evolution from the past (Flair) to the present (himself) to the future (Batista and Orton). On the May 26 episode of &quot;Raw&quot;, Orton attacked both Shawn Michaels and Kevin Nash after a two-on-one handicap match with Michaels and Flair (who eventually turned on Michaels during the match) taking on Triple H. During the group&#x27;s early stages, however, Batista was out of action for nearly eight months due to a triceps tear.

==== Dominance (2003–2005) ====

At Bad Blood on June 15, Flair was able to defeat Shawn Michaels after Orton struck Michaels with a chair. Later that night, Triple H retained his World Heavyweight Championship in a Hell in a Cell match against Kevin Nash. On the June 23 episode of &quot;Raw&quot;, Triple H defended the World Heavyweight Championship against Kane in a match with a &quot;Title vs. Mask&quot; stipulation. After Triple H defeated Kane, he would finally be unmasked completely for the audience to see. At Unforgiven on September 21, Orton, who began developing a &quot;Legend Killer&quot; gimmick, defeated Michaels to prove that he was indeed a &quot;Legend Killer&quot;. Later that night, Triple H defended the World Heavyweight Championship against Goldberg, to whom he lost the title. On the September 29 episode of &quot;Raw&quot;, Triple H issued a $100,000 bounty to anybody who could take out Goldberg. Three weeks later on the October 20 episode of &quot;Raw&quot;, Batista made his return from injury during a World Heavyweight Championship match between Goldberg and Michaels and attacked Goldberg, finishing by stomping on a steel chair with Goldberg&#x27;s ankle sandwiched in it to claim the bounty. At Survivor Series on November 16, Orton participated in the Team Bischoff versus Team Austin elimination tag team match, in which Orton was the sole survivor. Later that night, Goldberg defended the World Heavyweight Championship against Triple H in a rematch from Unforgiven, which Goldberg won despite repeated interference from Flair, Orton, and Batista. At the height of Evolution&#x27;s power, the group controlled all of the male-based championships of &quot;Raw&quot; after Armageddon on December 14. Batista teamed with Flair to win the World Tag Team Championship from the Dudley Boyz (Bubba Ray Dudley and D-Von Dudley) in a Tag Team Turmoil match, Orton captured the Intercontinental Championship from Rob Van Dam, and Triple H regained the World Heavyweight Championship from Goldberg (in a Triple Threat match that also involved Kane), with the help of the other members.

On January 25, 2004 at the Royal Rumble, Flair and Batista successfully defended the World Tag Team Championship against the Dudley Boyz in a Tables match, and World Heavyweight Champion Triple H fought Shawn Michaels to no contest in a Last Man Standing match, thus retaining the championship. On the February 16 episode of &quot;Raw&quot;, Flair and Batista lost the World Tag Team Championships to Booker T and Rob Van Dam. At WrestleMania XX on March 14, Evolution defeated the Rock &#x27;n&#x27; Sock Connection (The Rock and Mick Foley) in a 3-on-2 handicap match. Later that night, Triple H lost the World Heavyweight Championship to Chris Benoit (in a triple threat match that also involved Shawn Michaels) when he tapped out to the Crippler Crossface. On the March 22 episode of &quot;Raw&quot;, Flair and Batista defeated Booker T and Van Dam to regain the World Tag Team Championship. At Backlash on April 18, Flair lost to Shelton Benjamin in one-on-one action. Later that night, Orton defended the Intercontinental Championship successfully against Cactus Jack (Mick Foley) in a Hardcore match, while Chris Benoit retained the World Heavyweight Championship in a triple threat match against Triple H and Shawn Michaels, this time forcing Michaels to submit with the Sharpshooter.
While still World Heavyweight Champion, Benoit teamed with Edge to win the World Tag Team Championship from Flair and Batista on the April 19 episode of &quot;Raw&quot;. Triple H and Shawn Michaels would later continue their feud at Bad Blood on June 13 inside a Hell in a Cell, which was won by Triple H and thus ending their feud.
In mid-2004, Eugene befriended Triple H, and Triple H seemingly reciprocated the friendship. At Vengeance on July 11, it was revealed that Triple H had used Eugene to try and regain the World Heavyweight Championship. The angle concluded after Eugene accidentally caused Triple H&#x27;s loss to Chris Benoit at Vengeance. On the same night, Edge defeated Randy Orton to end his seven-month-long Intercontinental Championship reign.

Triple H received one final shot at the World Heavyweight Championship, on the July 26 episode of &quot;Raw&quot; in a 60-minute Iron Man match. Earlier that night, Orton won a battle royal to determine the number-one contender for the World Heavyweight Championship, so a title match between Triple H and Orton could have potentially taken place at SummerSlam on August 15. However, Eugene interfered in the Iron Man match and helped Benoit take the lead and retain the title in the final seconds. As a result, the main event of SummerSlam was now a title match between Benoit and Orton. At SummerSlam, Orton pinned Benoit to become the new World Heavyweight Champion and the youngest World Champion in WWE history to date. On the August 16 episode of &quot;Raw&quot;, Orton was kicked out of Evolution following a successful defense of the title in a rematch against Chris Benoit. Batista hoisted Orton on to his shoulders in what appeared to be a celebration, but following the thumbs down from Triple H, the group proceeded to attack Orton. The next week on Raw, Triple H demanded that Randy Orton &quot;make the right decision&quot; and give him the World Heavyweight Championship belt. In return, he would forget Orton ever existed. Orton refused and then spat in Triple H&#x27;s face. Afterwards backstage, Triple H was livid and demanded that general manager Eric Bischoff resolve this. Bischoff said he would and promised Triple H a match against Orton at Unforgiven on September 12 for the World Heavyweight Championship.

At Unforgiven, Triple H beat Orton to regain the World Heavyweight Championship, with help from Flair, Batista, and Jonathan Coachman. Orton&#x27;s feud with Evolution continued until Survivor Series on November 14 where Triple H, Batista, Gene Snitsky, and Edge were defeated by Orton, Maven, Chris Jericho, and Chris Benoit in a Survivor Series match, where the winning team would gain control of &quot;Raw&quot; over the following month.

On the December 6 episode of &quot;Raw&quot;, the World Heavyweight Championship was vacated when a triple threat match the previous week with Triple H, Edge, and Benoit ended in a double pin (Edge tapped out to Benoit&#x27;s Crippler Crossface while he simultaneously had Benoit pinned to the ground), and the title was to be decided in an Elimination Chamber match at New Year&#x27;s Revolution on January 9, 2005.

==== Breakup (2005) ====

In the Elimination Chamber match at New Year&#x27;s Revolution, Batista, Orton, and Triple H were the last three remaining in the match. Orton eliminated Batista with a RKO and Triple H pinned Orton with Batista&#x27;s help to win the title. On the following night&#x27;s &quot;Raw&quot;, a number-one contender&#x27;s match saw Orton pin Batista to gain a title shot at the Royal Rumble on January 30. Triple H suggested that Batista not enter the Royal Rumble match, wanting the group to focus on Triple H retaining the title. Batista declined, entered the Royal Rumble match at number 28 and won, last eliminating John Cena. Earlier as part of the match&#x27;s storyline, Orton was concussed and then pinned to have Triple H retain the title, finally ending their feud.

Following Batista&#x27;s Royal Rumble win, Triple H tried to persuade him to challenge the WWE Champion John &quot;Bradshaw&quot; Layfield (JBL) of SmackDown! rather than challenge him for his World Heavyweight Championship. This involved Triple H plotting a feud between JBL and Batista, showing JBL badmouthing Batista in an interview and staging an attack on Batista with a limousine designed to look like JBL&#x27;s. The scheme was unsuccessful and at the brand contract signing ceremony, Batista chose to remain on Raw, powerbombing Triple H through a table and thus leaving the faction turning face in the process. Batista defeated Triple H for the World Heavyweight Championship at WrestleMania 21 on April 3, then defended and retained the title in rematches at Backlash on May 1, and at Vengeance on June 26 in a Hell in a Cell match. On the June 30 episode of &quot;SmackDown!&quot;, Batista was drafted to SmackDown! as the last pick in the 2005 WWE draft lottery, effectively ending Triple H&#x27;s World Heavyweight Championship pursuits.

After Vengeance, Triple H took some time off, not being seen on WWE television for four months. In the interim, Flair turned face before going on to win the Intercontinental Championship from Carlito at Unforgiven on September 18. Triple H returned to action at the &quot;WWE Homecoming&quot; episode of &quot;Raw&quot; on October 3, where he teamed with Flair in a tag team match in a winning effort against Carlito and Chris Masters. After the match, Triple H betrayed Flair and attacked him with a sledgehammer, marking the definitive end of Evolution. Flair would then go on to defeat Triple H in a Steel Cage match to retain the Intercontinental Championship at Taboo Tuesday on November 1. Triple H then defeated Flair in a Last Man Standing match at Survivor Series on November 27.

===Reunions (2007–present)===
On December 10, 2007, Evolution had an in-ring reunion as faces on the &quot;Raw&quot; 15th Anniversary special episode, where Batista, Flair, and Triple H defeated the team of Orton, Edge and Umaga.

At SummerSlam on August 18, 2013, Triple H and Orton once again joined forces to form the heel stable The Authority. Then at WrestleMania XXX on April 6, 2014, the two men would be later joined by Batista after Daniel Bryan defeated Triple H in the opening match, and then defeated Orton and Batista in the main event in a Triple Threat match to win the WWE World Heavyweight Championship. The night after WrestleMania on the April 7 episode of &quot;Raw&quot;, Batista and Orton teamed together for the first time in ten years to face The Usos for the WWE Tag Team Championship, but the match ended in a no contest due to both teams being counted out. Later that night, Batista and Orton, along with Kane, attacked Bryan before he was set to defend his title against Triple H. Before Triple H could defeat Bryan, however, The Shield interrupted by spearing him and taking out Orton, Batista, and Kane. This allowed Bryan to retain his title via no contest.
On the April 14 episode of &quot;Raw&quot;, Triple H, Randy Orton and Batista came down to the ring to attack The Shield after their 11-on-3 handicap match, using the name and the theme of Evolution, officially reuniting the group. The Shield defeated Evolution in a six-man tag team match at Extreme Rules on May 4, and again the following month in a six-man No Holds Barred elimination tag match at Payback on June 1, in which none of The Shield were eliminated. On the June 2 episode of &quot;Raw&quot;, Batista quit the WWE (kayfabe) after his title match request was denied by Triple H due to Daniel Bryan&#x27;s neck injury at the time rendering Bryan unable to complete. This was done to write Batista off WWE television so he could promote &quot;Guardians of the Galaxy&quot;. However, Batista would legitimately quit after an appearance at an NXT event on June 12 due to creative differences. Later that night, Triple H declared that he had resorted to &quot;Plan B&quot; in his quest to destroy The Shield, prompting Seth Rollins to betray and attack Dean Ambrose and Roman Reigns, joining The Authority and dissolving The Shield.

Evolution reunited on SmackDown&#x27;s 1000th episode on October 16, 2018, cutting a promo leading to a match between Batista and Triple H at WrestleMania 35 on April 7, 2019.
