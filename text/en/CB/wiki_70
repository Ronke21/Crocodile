<text>Volothamp &quot;Volo&quot; Geddarm, created by Jeff Grubb, is a fictional character of the &quot;Forgotten Realms&quot; campaign setting for the &quot;Dungeons &amp; Dragons&quot; fantasy role-playing game.

== Origin ==
Volo&#x27;s first appearance was in &quot;Forgotten Realms Adventures&quot; (1990). Volo was created by Jeff Grubb, a game designer at TSR who collaborated with the &quot;Forgotten Realms&quot; creator Ed Greenwood. 

It is through Volo&#x27;s perspective that Greenwood authored his detailed Forgotten Realms lore-books of the &quot;Volo&#x27;s Guide&quot; series: &quot;Volo&#x27;s Guide to Waterdeep&quot; (1993), &quot;Volo&#x27;s Guide to the North&quot; (1993), &quot;Volo&#x27;s Guide to the Sword Coast&quot; (1994), &quot;Volo&#x27;s Guide to Cormyr&quot; (1995), &quot;Volo&#x27;s Guide to the Dalelands&quot; (1996), &quot;Volo&#x27;s Guide to All Things Magical&quot; (1996), &quot;Volo&#x27;s Guide to Baldur&#x27;s Gate II&quot; (2000) and &quot;Volo&#x27;s Guide to Monsters&quot; (2016)&quot;.&quot; Shannon Appelcline, author of &quot;Designers &amp; Dragons&quot;, commented that &quot;Greenwood enjoyed writing these books in part because he got to use an unreliable narrator&quot; with Greenwood stating &quot;that this allowed him to create details without worrying about contradicting the readers&#x27; own campaigns&quot;. Appelcline also noted that &quot;the idea of Volo always getting in trouble for what he writes is a long-running joke that carries through all the Guides&quot;.

== Fictional description ==
Volo was a too-curious-for-his-own-good travelling scholar and minor wizard. Always on the lookout for an exposé, he all too frequently was at odds with Elminster, who preferred some things to be kept in the dark. In fact, it was his assembling his &quot;first&quot; guide—Volo&#x27;s &quot;Guide to All Things Magical&quot;—that put him on the &quot;path&quot; to making his other guides. As for Elminster, it is he who edits every guide that Volo has published, as evident in the many footnotes in each, including Volo&#x27;s &quot;Guide to All Things Magical&quot;, which almost got Volo killed making it.

&quot;Volo&quot; is not to be confused with &quot;Marcus Volo&quot;, real name &quot;Marcus Wands&quot;, of the Wands family of Waterdeep. A trouble-making bard, Wands gained Volothamp&#x27;s moniker after he stole an artifact from a powerful wizard, and laid the blame on the far more infamous scapegoat of the real Volo. Pursued by the mad mage and his forces, and protected by adventurers hired by his father, Marco came into his own at the finale, when the artifact was revealed as containing a god from another world, who had come to Toril along with Marco&#x27;s family. The Sunstaffs, as they were known then, had through the generations been destined to keep the god imprisoned, and Marco awakened to his destiny with the help of the adventurers, Volothamp himself, and the gods Tyr, Sune, and Corellon Larethian.

He has also had several adventures of his own, as told in &quot;Once Around the Realms&quot; and &quot;The Mage in the Iron Mask&quot;.

==Reception==
Chroniclers of &quot;D&amp;D&quot; Michael Witwer and Kyle Newman considered &quot;the great Volo Geddarm&quot; as &quot;one of D&amp;D&#x27;s most famous&quot; and &quot;most beloved&quot; characters. Trenton Webb, writing for the British magazine &quot;Arcane&quot;, thought of Volo as &quot;a sort of magically empowered Magenta DeVine&quot;. 

Paul Pettengale, also writing for &quot;Arcane&quot;, described him as &quot;a famous &quot;AD&amp;D&quot; adventurer who, in an effort to help adventurers in Faerûn, has written a number of guides to regions within the Realms. He&#x27;s one of those characters that everyone&#x27;s heard about, and one that just about every Dungeon Master must have been tempted to introduce to their campaign at some point or another.&quot; Claudio Chianese from &quot;Giochi Per Il Mio Computer&quot; magazine described the character as &quot;the most multifaceted and entertaining figure of the Forgotten Realms. Explorer of lost lands, writer [...], womanizer and unrepentant trouble seeker&quot;. The reviewer saw his function for the role-playing game in contrasting his less-than-reliable view &quot;with that of the serious wizard Elminster&quot; and to &quot;add a touch of comedy&quot;.

Cameron Kunzelman of &quot;Paste&quot; described Volo as a &quot;drunk&quot; Ken Jennings who &quot;really cared about being able to name all the animals of the zoo, and was the sole grantor of Michelin stars across the world&quot;. Kunzelman highlighted the mechanical use of Volo as an unreliable narrator – &quot;as a character, Volo is brilliant because he is a device through which the designers of the Forgotten Realms can give Dungeon Masters a set of bounds.[...] That &#x27;thinks he knows&#x27; is crucial, because having Volo write the guide means that he can be &quot;wrong&quot;. From a design perspective, Volo is a way of giving DMs a toolbox that they don&#x27;t have to be completely adherent to. Whatever Volo thinks or writes can be slightly off the mark. Maybe he only saw a tavern during the daytime. Maybe he cut some corners. Nesting world design within the subjective opinions of an expansive, world-trotting character with a penchant for embellishment solves a lot of problems and generally makes the job of being a DM a little more fun&quot;.

==Appearances in other media==
Volo makes minor appearances in the computer games &quot;Baldur&#x27;s Gate&quot; and &quot;Baldur&#x27;s Gate II: Throne of Bhaal&quot;, where he appears in taverns near the beginning of each game. In &quot;Baldur&#x27;s Gate II: Throne of Bhaal&quot; he informs the player that he is writing a novel chronicling the events of the games and will give the player previews of how he intends to describe your companions in the game. The printed manual for &quot;Baldur&#x27;s Gate&quot; and &quot;Baldur&#x27;s Gate II&quot; itself also contains annotations supposedly written by Volo (and also by Elminster). Volo also appears in &quot;Baldur&#x27;s Gate 3&quot;.

He is also a major character in &quot;Neverwinter Nights 2: Storm of Zehir&quot; where he acts as narrator and features prominently in the plot itself. He is responsible for inviting the player&#x27;s party aboard the ship that you begin the game aboard. The opening and closing sequences are presented in such a way as to imply that the game is one of his books.

Volo was featured as a &quot;&quot; card among other &quot;Iconic D&amp;D creatures, villains, heroes, and more [which] grace the &quot;Adventures in the Forgotten Realms&quot; set&quot;.

<text>Antônio Reginaldo Pizzonia Júnior (born 11 September 1980) is a Brazilian professional racing driver who has raced in Formula One and the Champ Car World Series. Born in Manaus, he started his car racing career in the Formula Vauxhall Junior series in 1997 and then progressed through various junior formulae, winning the Formula Vauxhall Junior Winter Festival in 1997, the Formula Vauxhall Junior and Formula Renault Winter Festival in 1998, the Formula Renault 2.0 UK in 1999, and the British Formula 3 Championship in 2000.

For 2001 and 2002, he entered the Formula 3000, with his best championship finish being sixth in 2001. In 2003, he was signed by the Jaguar Formula One team, but following poor results, was released during the season. In 2004, he replaced the injured Ralf Schumacher at Williams in several events, securing his first Formula One points in the process.

In 2005, he replaced Nick Heidfeld at Williams, but was released from his contract at the end of the season. Since then, he has competed in multiple series, such as the Champ Car World Series, the Superleague Formula, Stock Car Brasil, and the FIA GT1 World Championship.

==Racing career==

===Pre-Formula One===
From 1991 to 1996 he competed in various karting series. In 1997 he moved to Britain and competed in Formula Vauxhall Junior; Pizzonia placed second, and won the Winter Festival. In 1998, in addition to taking the Championship in Formula Vauxhall Junior, he won the Formula Renault Winter Festival.

His 1999 season was even more successful, winning the Formula Renault 2.0 UK series and finishing second in the Formula Renault 2.0 Eurocup. In 2000, Pizzonia took five wins on his way to winning the British Formula 3 Championship. For 2001, Pizzonia switched to the Formula 3000 series, winning one race and finishing sixth in the championship.

===Formula One===
In 2002, Pizzonia was hired as test driver for Williams, but also continued in F3000, placing 8th. After impressive testing performances, he was signed by the Jaguar team to partner Mark Webber for 2003, replacing the axed Pedro de la Rosa
. However, following a string of poor results, he was dropped late in the season and replaced by Minardi&#x27;s Justin Wilson.

In 2004 he returned to Williams as test driver. Before the German Grand Prix, it was announced that Pizzonia would take over from Marc Gené, who had been filling in for the injured Ralf Schumacher. At the German Grand Prix, he finished 7th to take his first 2 career points; he repeated the feat at the Hungarian Grand Prix.

In Belgium, he briefly led an F1 race for the first time, but failed to finish the race due to a gearbox problem, whilst running in 3rd place. He claimed a further 2 points in Italy (during which he achieved the fastest ever recorded top speed in a F1 race at the time, 369.9 km/h, until Juan Pablo Montoya eclipsed this record the following year), but with the announcement of Ralf Schumacher&#x27;s return for the Chinese Grand Prix, Pizzonia&#x27;s racing was over for the year.

Prior to the 2005 season, Pizzonia was in a virtual shoot-out with German Nick Heidfeld for the second race seat at Williams alongside Webber. Despite Pizzonia&#x27;s experience with the team and financial support from Petrobras, Heidfeld was given the seat.

Pizzonia was still employed at Williams as a test driver, and when Heidfeld complained of headaches after being concussed in a crash during the Friday Practice Session at Monza, Pizzonia gained the chance to race. Having not entered an F1 race since the 2004 Italian Grand Prix, the Brazilian qualified 16th, coming through the field to emulate his 2004 race result — picking up 7th place and 2 points. He then raced in the Belgian Grand Prix. where he incurred a fine for taking out 2nd placed Juan Pablo Montoya just a few laps from the end. Pizzonia also took the drive in the Brazilian Grand Prix, but his race was over before the first corner after taking out his own teammate Mark Webber resulting from a collision with David Coulthard.

Despite some speculation that GP2 champion Nico Rosberg would be given an opportunity in the last two races of the season, Pizzonia completed the season for Williams. He retired from the Japanese Grand Prix early after spinning off, and retired from (but was classified as a finisher in) the Chinese Grand Prix after a puncture. Having been replaced by Nico Rosberg for 2006, Pizzonia&#x27;s Formula One career was over.

===Post-Formula One===

In 2006, he drove for Paul Gentilozzi&#x27;s Rocketsports team in the Champ Car World Series&#x27; Long Beach Grand Prix and returned to the team towards the end of the season for races where Tõnis Kasemets did not have sponsorship to race.

In 2007, Pizzonia was racing for Fisichella Motor Sport in the GP2 series. In May, he was dropped in favour of Adam Carroll after only scoring 1 point in 5 races. After that, he returned to Brazil and entered into competition in Stock Car Brasil, a Brazilian national championship, from July. He has competed in the series every year since then, and has also raced in Superleague Formula (SC Corinthians) and the FIA GT1 World Championship.

In 2012, Pizzonia made a one-off guest appearance in the Auto GP World Series when the championship visited the Brazilian Curitiba circuit. Driving for the Ombra Racing team, he won both races, immediately slotting himself into ninth position in the championship.

In 2014 and 2015, Pizzonia competed in the Auto GP series, with Zele Racing.
Pizzonia returned to open-wheel racing in 2023, in the BOSS GP series, with HS Engineering in a Gibson-engined Dallara T12, winning both races overall at the season-opener at Paul Ricard. He has subsequently won every race in his class. He won the Open class title at TT Circuit Assen.

<doc id="831981" wikidata="Q1206595" url="?curid=831981" title="Corps de ballet">
<text>In ballet, the corps de ballet (; French for &quot;body of the little dance&quot;) is the group of dancers who are not principal dancers or soloists. They are a permanent part of the ballet company and often work as a backdrop for the principal dancers.

A &quot;corps de ballet&quot; works as one, with synchronized movements and corresponding positioning on the stage. Well-known uses of the &quot;corps de ballet&quot; include the titular swans of &quot;Swan Lake&quot; and &quot;The Nutcracker&quot;&#x27;s snow scene and the Waltz of the Flowers sequence.

== Function == 
The &quot;corps de ballet&quot; sets the mood, scene, and nuance of the ballet, builds connection and camaraderie among the members of a ballet company, and creates large stage pictures through ensemble movement an choreography.

Beyond the physical world-building provided by the &quot;corps de ballet&quot;, it also serves as a vital stepping stone for younger, incoming dancers, where they learn about company life and the structure of classical ballets before possibly being promoted to perform as a soloist or principal.

== History ==
Some scholars argue the nineteenth-century &quot;corps de ballet&quot; finds its roots in French revolutionary choral festivities, themselves rooted in festivals from antiquity.

=== &quot;Le petit rats&quot; === 

Dancers who filled out the Paris Opéra&#x27;s &quot;corps de ballet&quot; often included pupils, some as young as 14, affectionately known as &quot;les rats&quot; or &quot;les petit rats&quot;. Many etymological explanations exist for the term; among them Emile Littré&#x27;s suggestion that the term &quot;demoiselles d&#x27;opéra&quot; (young lady of the opera) had been shortened simply to &quot;ra&quot;, or the belief that the sound the &quot;corps de ballet&quot;&#x27;s pointe shoes made on the wooden floors of the rehearsal rooms may be likened to the skittering of rats.

In 1866, Théophile Gautier (author of &quot;Giselle&quot;), published an essay entitled &quot;Le Rat&quot;, a fond and humorous description of the habits of these young dancers.
The role of the &quot;corps&quot; during the late 1800s at the Paris Opéra Ballet could also include an underside. The &quot;foyer de la danse&quot; where dancers warmed up before performances also functioned as a kind of men&#x27;s club, where wealthy male opera subscribers (&quot;abonnés&quot;) could conduct business, socialize, and proposition the ballerinas. Because many &quot;petit rats&quot; came from working-class backgrounds, and due to the power structures in place, they would have had financial and career incentive to submit to the affections and propositions of these subscribers. However, little surviving contemporary writing on the subject chronicles the experiences or perspectives of &quot;le petit rats&quot; themselves, often erring instead on the side of gossip.

===20th century and beyond===
Ballets like &quot;Flames of Paris&quot;, which featured an enormous &quot;corps&quot; of 24-32 dancers, pioneered an active use of the &quot;corps de ballet&quot; in storytelling.

Throughout the 21st century, the demands on corps dancers have changed, calling for them to be &quot;more versatile and virtuosic as individuals&quot; and causing them to &quot;face more emotional and physical challenges than ever, amplified by heavy work schedules&quot;. They are typically among the lowest-paid members of the company, and often not guaranteed year-round employment. Despite the challenges, many corps dancers feel pride and connection with their positions in the &quot;corps&quot;: as Karin Ellis-Wentz, a now-retired dancer and faculty member at the Joffrey Ballet put it, &quot;people need to know that you can have a fabulous career and stay in the corps.&quot;

== In media == 
Impressionist painter Edgar Degas often featured the dancers of the Paris Opera Ballet in his works, among them some of his most well-known. In total, approximately 1,500 of his paintings, monotypes, and drawings are dedicated to the ballet, as well as some sculpture.

<text>Weltpolitik (, &quot;world politics&quot;) was the imperialist foreign policy adopted by the German Empire during the reign of Emperor Wilhelm II. The aim of the policy was to transform Germany into a global power. Though considered a logical consequence of the German unification by a broad spectrum of Wilhelmine society, it marked a decisive break with the defensive &quot;Realpolitik&quot; of the Bismarckian era.

The origins of the policy can be traced to a Reichstag debate on 6 December 1897 during which German Foreign Secretary Bernhard von Bülow stated, &quot;in one word: We wish to throw no one into the shade, but we also demand our own place in the sun.&quot; (&quot;Mit einem Worte: wir wollen niemand in den Schatten stellen, aber wir verlangen auch unseren Platz an der Sonne&quot;).

Nancy Mitchell says that the creation of &quot;Weltpolitik&quot; was a change in the appliance of German foreign policy. Up until Wilhelm&#x27;s dismissal of Otto von Bismarck, Germany had concentrated its efforts on stopping the possibility of a two-front war in Europe. Prior to &quot;Weltpolitik&quot;, there was a greater focus on using its army and subtle diplomacy to maintain its status. In particular, Bismarck had initially been wary of acquiring overseas colonies and wished to reserve the role of Germany as an &quot;honest broker&quot; in continental affairs, though the 1878 Congress of Berlin had revealed the limits of his mediation.

However, despite Bismarck&#x27;s initial scepticism, the foundations of the German colonial empire were already laid during his tenure from 1884 onwards, when the government began to place the privately acquired properties of colonisers like Adolf Lüderitz, Adolph Woermann, Carl Peters, and Clemens Denhardt under the protection of the German Empire, necessitating costly action such as in the 1888 Abushiri revolt. According to German historian Hans-Ulrich Wehler, German colonial policy in the 1880s was an example of a &quot;pragmatic&quot; social imperialism, a device that allowed the government to distract public attention from domestic problems and preserve the existing social and political order.

Under &quot;Weltpolitik&quot;, despite a two-front war still being at the forefront of Germany&#x27;s concerns as proven through the Schlieffen Plan, Wilhelm II was far more ambitious. Colonial policies officially became a matter of national prestige, promoted by pressure groups like the Pan-German League; in the ongoing Scramble for Africa, Germany was a latecomer and had to stand firm to catch up. However, only relatively small acquisitions were made, such as Kiautschou Bay and Neukamerun, whereas Wilhelm&#x27;s support for a policy of colonisation was shown in his Kruger telegram in 1896 and response to the Venezuelan crisis of 1902–1903. Colonial ambitions were further reflected in the Herero and Nama genocide from 1904 onwards and the suppression of the Maji Maji Rebellion from 1907, as well as in the First and Second Moroccan Crisis of 1905 and 1911.

The Anglo-German naval arms race was likely lost when Germany failed to keep up with the British after the advent of dreadnought battleships from 1906 onwards; with the Anglo-Russian Convention and the Triple Entente of 1907, &quot;Weltpolitik&quot; showed itself unable to forestall the threat of a two-front war. The policy&#x27;s ultimate failure would be sealed in the First World War.

<text>Culzean Castle ( , see yogh; ) is a castle overlooking the Firth of Clyde, near Maybole, Carrick, in South Ayrshire, on the west coast of Scotland. It is the former home of the Marquess of Ailsa, the chief of Clan Kennedy, but is now owned by the National Trust for Scotland. The clifftop castle lies within the Culzean Castle Country Park and is opened to the public. 
From 1972 until 2015, an illustration of the castle was featured on the reverse side of five pound notes issued by the Royal Bank of Scotland.

As of 2021, the castle was available for rent.

== History ==
Culzean Castle was constructed as an L-plan castle by order of the 10th Earl of Cassilis. He instructed the architect Robert Adam to rebuild a previous, but more basic, structure into a fine country house to be the seat of his earldom. The castle was built in stages between 1777 and 1792. It incorporates a large drum tower with a circular saloon inside (which overlooks the sea), a grand oval staircase and a suite of well-appointed apartments.

The castle was the venue, on 14 November 1817, when the 1st Marquess of Ailsa&#x27;s daughter, Margaret Radclyffe Livingstone Eyre, married Thomas, Viscount Kynnaird. Margaret would become a noted philanthropist.

In 1945, the Kennedy family gave the castle and its grounds to the National Trust for Scotland (thus avoiding inheritance tax). In doing so, they stipulated that the apartment at the top of the castle be given to General of the Army Dwight D. Eisenhower in recognition of his role as Supreme Commander of the Allied Forces in Europe during the Second World War. The General first visited Culzean Castle in 1946 and stayed there four times, including once while President of the United States.

The Ayrshire (Earl of Carrick&#x27;s Own) Yeomanry, a British Yeomanry cavalry regiment, was formed by the Earl of Cassillis at Culzean Castle in about 1794. On 24 June 1961, the regiment returned to the castle to be presented with its first guidon by General Sir Horatius Murray, KBE, CB, DSO.

The castle re-opened in April 2011 after a refurbishment funded by a gift in the will of American millionaire William Lindsay to the National Trust for Scotland. Lindsay, who had never visited Scotland, requested that a significant portion of his $4 million go towards Culzean. Lindsay was reportedly interested in Eisenhower&#x27;s holidays at the castle.

Culzean Castle received 333,965 visitors in 2019.

== Features ==
The armoury contains a propeller from a plane flown by Leefe Robinson when he shot down a German airship north of London in 1916.

To the north of the castle is a bay containing the &quot;Gas House&quot;, which provided town gas for the castle up until 1940. This group of buildings consists of the gas manager&#x27;s house (now containing an exhibition on William Murdoch), the Retort House and the remains of the gasometer.

There are sea caves beneath the castle which are currently not open generally, but are open for tours throughout the summer.

The castle grounds include a walled garden, which is built on the site of the home of a former slave owned by the Kennedy family, Scipio Kennedy.

==Ghosts==
The castle is reputed to be home to at least seven ghosts, including a piper and a servant girl.

<doc id="832032" wikidata="Q1700602" url="?curid=832032" title="Open Programming Language">
<text>Open Programming Language (OPL) is a programming language for embedded systems and mobile devices that run the operating systems EPOC and Symbian. It was released by the British company Psion in 1984.

==Use==
Originally designed for use on their classic Psion PDAs such as the Series 3, 5/5mx, Series 7, and netBook–netPad, and the Psion produced MC218, OPL was provided as part of the standard application suite. It can also be installed on the Nokia 9200, 9300 and 9500 Communicator series mobile telephone and personal digital assistant (PDA) and the Sony Ericsson P800, P900, P910 series. OPL is also included in Psion Teklogix industrial handhelds such as the Workabout mx, and it also appeared in the lesser known Oregon &#x27;Osaris&#x27; organiser, a broadly compatible EPOC32 device that uniquely used version 4 of the OS. OPL is an interpreted language similar to BASIC. A fully Visual Basic-compatible language OVAL has also been developed.

==History==
The language was originally named &quot;Organiser Programming Language&quot;, developed by Psion Ltd for the Psion Organiser. Designed by Colly Myers with the first iteration implemented by Richard Harrison and Martin Stamp. The first implementation (without graphics) was for the original Psion Organiser (now referred to as the Psion Organiser I, 1984), and it came bundled with the Science, Finance and Math data packs. It became truly accessible as built-in software in the Psion Organiser II (1986), and the language went on to be used in the Psion Series 3 and later. After Psion retired from the personal digital assistant market, a project aiming to bring OPL to Symbian came to fruition, when the fledgling Symbian Developer Program released it as open-source software. The language is now available on SourceForge in a project named &quot;opl-dev&quot;.

The language is currently unavailable for Symbian OS v8 and later. With the subsequent retirement of the Symbian OS, it seems unlikely OPL will be made available for later generations of Symbian devices. As of 2010, Nokia device developers were encouraged to use Python for S60 instead (See Python for S60).

==Examples==
Here is the console version of a &quot;Hello, World!&quot; program:

 PROC main:
 PRINT &quot;Hello World!&quot;
 PAUSE 40
 ENDP

And here is a GUI version for Nokia&#x27;s Series 80 user interface:

 CONST KKeyEnter%=13
 PROC hello:
 dINIT &quot;Hello&quot;
 dTEXT &quot;&quot;,&quot;Hello World!&quot;
 dBUTTONS &quot;OK&quot;,KKeyEnter%
 DIALOG
 ENDP

OPL is a structured programming language. OPL programs contain PROCedures, which are much like functions (subroutines) in other programming languages.
* The dINIT keyword in this example initializes a dialog box (intuitively enough, all dialog-box related functions begin with a letter &#x27;d&#x27;; for clarity, this letter is in lower case, but the language is case independent). The first argument of the dialog is an optional string, which is used for the title of the dialog, displayed in the title bar.
* The dTEXT function displays text, with two compulsory arguments: a left-aligned &#x27;prompt&#x27; string, and a main string.
* The dBUTTONS keyword allows you to put buttons on the dialog box - here there is a button with the text &quot;OK&quot;. The second argument to each button is both the special notation of the shortcut key for that button and the dialog&#x27;s return code, in this case the &quot;Enter&quot; key.
* Finally, the DIALOG keyword is required for the previously initialized dialog box to be shown on the screen.

===Testing dialog responses===
An example:

 PROC test:
 dINIT &quot;Your Challenge&quot;
 dTEXT &quot;&quot;,&quot;Will your answer to this question be no?&quot;
 dBUTTONS &quot;Yes&quot;,%y,&quot;No&quot;,%n
 IF DIALOG=%y
 PRINT &quot;No it wasn&#x27;t!&quot;
 ELSE
 PRINT &quot;Yes it was!&quot;
 ENDIF
 GET
 ENDP

In this cruel interrogative program, the Yes button is assigned the shortcut of Ctrl+y, while No has Ctrl+n, represented by %y and %n respectively. The user&#x27;s input from the DIALOG is tested in the IF statement, PRINTing appropriate responses to the screen. Note that the &#x27;GET&#x27; keyword, which gets user input without using a dialog box, is here used simply to wait for a keypress before terminating the program (otherwise it would end immediately without giving time for the user to read the text). The output from DIALOG can also be stored in a variable.

Variables specific to a procedure must be declared with the LOCAL keyword; global variables are defined with the GLOBAL keyword.

===Variable types===
The table below uses an example variable named codice_1.

==Minutiae==

OPL interfaced with advanced Psion Series 3 features by means of operating system CALLs, but in the later Psion Series 5mx this was changed to a so-called codice_2 library, stored in the system read-only memory (ROM), termed the Z drive. &#x27;OPX&#x27; libraries were also made available for the Nokia 9210, Nokia 9300 and Nokia 9500 Communicators, adding OPXs routines for handling Short Message Service (SMS) and managing Bluetooth communication.

Other OPL features include those starting with a letter: codice_3 for graphical functions, codice_4 for menus, and codice_5 for dialogs.

<doc id="832034" wikidata="Q2731483" url="?curid=832034" title="Distinguished Service Medal (U.S. Air and Space Forces)">
<text>The Distinguished Service Medal (DSM) is a military decoration of the United States Air Force and United States Space Force and is presented to airmen and guardians to recognize distinguished and exceptionally meritorious service to the United States while serving in a duty or position of great responsibility. The Distinguished Service Medal was created by an act of the United States Congress on July 6, 1960 and was first awarded in 1965. Prior to the creation of the Distinguished Service Medal in 1960, United States Air Force airmen were awarded the Army Distinguished Service Medal.

The Distinguished Service Medal is equivalent to the Army&#x27;s Distinguished Service Medal, Naval Service&#x27;s Navy Distinguished Service Medal, and the Coast Guard Distinguished Service Medal.

The interpretation of the phrase &quot;great responsibility&quot; means that this medal is generally awarded only to officers who hold at least the rank of major general. However, as is customary for most military decorations, the requirements for the Distinguished Service Medal are interpreted more liberally when awarded upon retirement. As a result, it is the typical decoration for a retiring brigadier general, and in recent years it has also been awarded to the Chief Master Sergeant of the Air Force upon retirement. Cases of the award of this decoration to an individual who was not a general officer, or the Chief Master Sergeant of the Air Force, are unusual. Two notable exceptions are astronauts Colonel Buzz Aldrin and Colonel David Scott (who flew on Gemini 8, Apollo 9, and Apollo 15) who was awarded the medal twice.

Recipients during the medal&#x27;s first 6 years included General Emmett E. &quot;Rosie&quot; O&#x27;Donnell Jr. (a United States Air Force four-star general who served as Commander in Chief, Pacific Air Forces from 1959 to 1963). O&#x27;Donnell also led the first B-29 Superfortress attack upon Tokyo during World War II after the 1942 Doolittle Raid. 
Another early recipient of the Distinguished Service Medal was Major General Osmond J. Ritland, USAF, who received his medal on November 30, 1965, upon his retirement.

Additional awards are denoted with oak leaf clusters.

This award is comparable to the Department of the Air Force Decoration for Exceptional Civilian Service given to civilian employees of the Department of the Air Force.

<text>Brodick Castle is a castle situated outside the port of Brodick on the Isle of Arran, an island in the Firth of Clyde, Scotland. It was previously a seat of the Dukes of Hamilton, but is now owned by the National Trust for Scotland. The castle is a Category A listed building and the grounds are included in the Inventory of Gardens and Designed Landscapes in Scotland.

==History==

===Early and High Medieval===
A fortress has been on the site since at least the fifth century, when Gaelic invaders from Antrim expanded their kingdom of Dál Riata.
By the tenth century Norse influence had grown, and Arran formed part of Sudreys or &quot;Súðreyjar&quot;, administered either from Dublin or Orkney (Nordreys or &quot;Norðreyjar&quot;) and nominally under the control of the King of Norway. This can be deduced by the number of Scandinavian place-names on the island including Brodick, or &quot;Breiðvík&quot; (Broad Bay, also spelt variously Brethwic, Brathwik, Brethwik, Brathwic, Bradewik, and Braizay). The site is thought to have been a centre of relative importance, on account of its strategic position on the Firth of Clyde.

By the mid-thirteenth century Arran was part of the Kingdom of Mann and the Isles ruled by two &quot;Gall Gaidheal&quot; kings, Magnus of Mann and Dougal of the Isles, sub-rulers of Hákon Hákonarson, King of Norway. Alexander III of Scotland had inherited his father&#x27;s desire to control the islands in order to stabilise his kingdom, and made numerous unsuccessful advances to that effect. In 1262 the Earl of Ross sacked and pillaged Skye with the king&#x27;s blessing. King Hákon determined to avenge this slight and set out in July 1263, with a large fighting fleet (&quot;leiðangr&quot;) for Scotland. 

After linking up with the fleets of Magnus and Dougal, and showing his might throughout the Hebrides, Hákon&#x27;s force anchored in Lamlash Bay on Arran, where they were approached by envoys from the Scots King. The Scots envoys were unsuccessful, and battle was engaged at Largs, a short distance across the firth.
Although no rout, the Scots were victorious, and Hákon&#x27;s forces retreated to Arran, and thence to Orkney to over-winter, where Hákon died. The ensuing Treaty of Perth in 1266 ceded the Sudreys to the Kingdom of Scotland.

===Interregnum and Wars of Independence===
When both Alexander III and his heir, Margaret, Maid of Norway died, the Kingdom of Scotland was thrown into turmoil. In 1291, Edward I of England, was called on to choose the most suitable successor. John de Balliol was chosen and was forced to admit Edward as his suzerain. John defied Edward in 1295, and did not answer his request for assistance in his war in France. Edward invaded Scotland the following year and forced John to abdicate. At some point around this time an English garrison was stationed at Brodick. During Robert the Bruces&#x27;s time in hiding, following his escape from the English after his coronation and defeat at the Battle of Methven, he is said to have had his legendary encounter with a spider on Arran.

On the behest of Robert the Bruce, James Douglas, Lord of Douglas, early in the winter of 1306/07 previous to their attack on Carrick, attacked forces supplying Brodick castle giving a first minor victory and gaining their forces much needed supplies.

Acting with Sir Robert Boyd of Kilmarnock, Douglas was able in January 1307 to dislodge the English from Brodick, one of the first castles to fall to Bruce&#x27;s forces in his struggle to regain his country.

===Late Middle Ages===

In 1406 – the same year that James I was captured by English pirates and Robert III died – the castle was badly damaged by an English force that had sailed into Brodick bay. Further destruction was inflicted by John of Islay, Lord of the Isles, in 1455. At some point after 1470 the castle was granted by James III to his brother-in-law, James Hamilton, 1st Lord Hamilton. His son, James Hamilton, 2nd Lord Hamilton was created Earl of Arran in 1503. At this point Hamilton added the Lymphad of the Isles to his Armorial bearings

==The Hamiltons==
===Earls of Arran===

The castle had been rebuilt by the Earl by 1510 in the form of a tower house, but suffered at the hands of the Campbells and the MacLeans. During the &quot;Rough Wooing&quot; of Mary, Queen of Scots, Brodick castle was attacked by an English force led by the Earl of Lennox on behalf of Henry VIII, in revenge for the actions of the 2nd Earl. Lord Arran was the Regent of Scotland whilst Mary was in her infancy, and was second in line to the Scots throne. In 1543, he had been heavily involved in arranging the marriage of Mary to the Dauphin of France, prior to this she had been promised to Edward, Prince of Wales. Arran was rewarded for his efforts, however, and was created Duke of Châtellerault in the Peerage of France. During Regent Arran&#x27;s tenure at Brodick he continued to enlarge and expand the castle. 

In the summer of 1550 Andrew Hamilton and Dean John Slater worked on the building. In March 1552 live partridges and hares were sent to Brodick for the Regent&#x27;s table and a special boring tool called a &quot;wombill&quot; was bought to make holes at the rabbit warren. In June a carpenter Peter Moffett made new doors. Some timber spars for the new building were supplied by the Laird of Luss on Loch Lomond.

In May 1579 the Earl of Argyll took Brodick for James VI and Ninian Stewart was installed as keeper for the crown. In 1602 Paul Hamilton, captain of Brodick for Marquess of Hamilton, with his companions all armed with pistols attacked a farmer Marrarat MacMillan at North Sannox and took his horse and cattle, and wool and plaids and imprisoned Duncan MacElloway at Brodick.

===Dukes of Hamilton===

Brodick Castle did not escape the religious paroxysms that affected seventeenth century life &quot;(see the Wars of the Three Kingdoms).&quot; In 1639, Scotland was divided between the Presbyterianism of the Lords of the Congregation, and the Episcopalianism favoured by King Charles I. James Hamilton, 3rd marquess of Hamilton, the King&#x27;s advisor on all things Scottish, was sent north to enforce the King&#x27;s will, he had previously dissolved the General Assembly of the Church of Scotland when they had abolished the Episcopacy. Archibald Campbell, 1st Marquess of Argyll, was the de facto ruler of Scotland and leader of the presbyterian faction. Argyll seized Hamilton&#x27;s castle of Brodick. Hamilton was made a Duke in 1643 and recovered his castle the following year at the outbreak of the Scottish Civil War. It was lost again to the Campbells in 1646, as the Royalists fortunes foundered. The Duke was captured after the disastrous Battle of Preston, and faced the block in March 1649. He was succeeded by his brother William, Earl of Lanark, but the second Duke died of wounds received at the Battle of Worcester in 1651. The Duchy of Hamilton and Earldom of Arran passed to the first Duke&#x27;s only surviving child, Anne. She had been unwittingly sent to Brodick for safety. In 1650, Oliver Cromwell&#x27;s Roundheads had taken control of the castle and had extended it by building an Artillery battery to defend the Firth at this strategic position.

Duchess Anne returned to her estates in Lanarkshire and West Lothian and in 1656 married William Douglas, 1st Earl of Selkirk. Anne did not return to Brodick, however her husband the newly created Duke of Hamilton for life, used the castle as a base for hunting excursions.

In the following years Brodick was used mainly as an occasional sporting estate. In the nineteenth century, it became residence for the eldest son of the 10th Duke, styled the Marquess of Douglas and Clydesdale.

William, 11th Duke of Hamilton, married in 1843, Princess Marie of Baden, youngest daughter of the Grand Duke of Baden and Stéphanie de Beauharnais, adopted daughter of Napoleon Bonaparte. In 1844, massive building work was undertaken at the castle, almost tripling the size of the building, under the architect James Gillespie Graham. The Twelfth Duke, William, had no male heirs, so although his titles passed to his distant cousin Alfred Douglas-Hamilton upon his death, he entailed the castle upon his only daughter the Lady Mary Louise Douglas-Hamilton. She married the 6th Duke of Montrose in 1906. Unlike in 1651, when the property also passed through the female line and the then spouse assumed the Hamilton name, at this time, after more than five hundred years, Brodick Castle was no longer possessed by someone bearing the Hamilton name.

==Today==
The Castle and gardens were acquired by the National Trust for Scotland from the Lady Jean Fforde in 1958, in lieu of death duties upon the death of her mother, the Dowager Duchess of Montrose. The 2017 obituary in &quot;The Times&quot; of London of Lady Jean (who, among other things, had worked at Bletchley Park, the principal centre of Allied code-breaking during the Second World War) quotes her as saying that the loss &quot;of the castle and all its contents . . . was like losing my whole life.&quot;

The castle is open to the public during the summer, with Brodick Country Park open all year round. The site welcomed 68,423 visitors during 2019.

A black-and-white copy of William Woollett&#x27;s engraving of the painting &quot;The Death of General Wolfe&quot; by Benjamin West can be seen at the castle.

Since 1972, an illustration of the castle has featured on the reverse side of twenty pound notes issued by the Royal Bank of Scotland. The 1998 film &quot;The Governess&quot;, starring Minnie Driver, was filmed at Brodick Castle.

==Gardens==
Bee boles can be seen in the Walled Garden, which was built in 1710.

<doc id="832065" wikidata="Q890839" url="?curid=832065" title="Bohnanza">
<text>Bohnanza is a German-style card game based on the game mechanics of trading and politics, designed by Uwe Rosenberg and released in 1997 (in German) by Amigo Spiele and (in English) by Rio Grande Games. It is played with a deck of cards with comical illustrations of eleven different types of beans of varying scarcity, which the players are trying to plant and sell in order to earn money. The principal restriction is that players may only farm two or three types of beans at once (limited by the number of fields they own), but they obtain beans of all different types &quot;randomly&quot; from the deck and so must engage in trade with the other players to be successful.

The original game is for 3–5 players and takes about 1 hour to play, but the Rio Grande edition adds alternative rules to the official rulebook to allow for games for 2–7 players. The name &quot;Bohnanza&quot; is a pun on the words &quot;Bohne&quot; (German for &quot;bean&quot;) and &quot;bonanza&quot; (an English word for &quot;an exceptionally large and rich mineral deposit&quot; as well as a reference to the long-running Western show &quot;Bonanza&quot;).

== Rules ==
=== Cards ===
 The Coffee, Wax and Cocoa Beans were added in an expansion in the German edition. In the English edition of the game, they are included in the standard set. They are also included in the 25th anniversary edition.

 The English edition of the game changed the &quot;Weinbrandbohne&quot; (Brandy Bean) into the Wax Bean.

 In German, &quot;blaue Bohnen&quot; is slang for bullets, explaining the illustration of the blue bean dressed as a cowboy.

 In German, green beans are called &quot;Brechbohnen&quot;, from the verb &quot;brechen&quot;, meaning &quot;to break&quot; (as in &quot;breaking&quot; the beans from the bush in order to harvest them); but &quot;brechen&quot; in German can also mean &quot;to vomit&quot;, explaining the illustration of the vomiting green bean.

 Only included in the 25th anniversary Edition; Field Bean originally included in an expansion.

 Only playable in a 4-5 player game. When Harvested, it grants the player an extra field by turning over the playmat to show three fields.

=== Setup ===
Each player is dealt a hand of cards to start (typically five cards, though hand size varies with expansion sets and number of players). A rule unique to Bohnanza is that &quot;cards in hand must be kept in the order in which they are dealt at all times&quot;; they may not be rearranged.

Each player has two fields (or three in a three-player game) in which to plant beans. In older editions of the game, a third field could be bought by any player at any point during the game for three coins, though in more recent editions this ability has been removed. Each field may contain any number of bean cards, but all beans in a field must be of the same bean type. If a bean of a type different from those already growing in a field is planted into that field, the beans previously in it must be &quot;harvested&quot; for coins. A field containing just one bean &quot;may not&quot; be harvested by a player unless all of their fields have 1 or fewer beans in them. Each player also has a trading area to hold cards gained through trades and a treasury to hold the player&#x27;s earned coins.

Cards in the hand are kept hidden. Cards in trading areas and fields are visible to all players. The number of cards in each player&#x27;s treasury is kept secret from the other players. The discard pile is face up, but only the top card is visible; players may not examine the pile. When the deck runs out, the discard pile is reshuffled and re-used as the deck.

=== Turn sequence ===
During their turn, each player does the following:

# They &quot;must&quot; play the first card in their hand &quot;(the one at the front; i.e., the one dealt to them earliest)&quot; into a field. &quot;This may result in them having to harvest beans!&quot;
# They &quot;may&quot; play the next card in their hand into a field.
# They &quot;must&quot; take the top two cards from the deck and place them face up into their trading area.
# Trading opens. Players may make offers and trade cards from &quot;(and only from)&quot; their hands &quot;(but they may offer/trade any card(s) in their hands in any order)&quot; and the cards in the active player&#x27;s trading area. Traded cards go into the recipient&#x27;s trading area. Trade may only occur with the player whose turn it is. No cards may ever be traded from fields. No cards can ever get placed &quot;into&quot; a player&#x27;s hand by trading. No cards that have been traded once may be traded again - once a bean has been traded it must be planted in a field of the person it has been traded with.
# Trading ends whenever the player whose turn it is decides it should. At the end of trading, each player must plant all cards in their trading area into their fields. &quot;This may involve harvesting beans, possibly several times; take note of the order in which beans are planted into fields if there are more types of beans being planted than fields they are being planted into.&quot;
# The player ends their turn by drawing cards from the deck, one by one, and placing them at the &quot;back&quot; of their hand (so they get played last). &quot;Again, the exact number of cards drawn here varies. If players started with a hand of five, three cards are drawn in this stage.&quot;

This turn sequence can be summarized with these four phrases: &quot;Must plant, may plant,&quot; &quot;Turn up two,&quot; &quot;Trade and plant trades,&quot; and &quot;Draw three cards.&quot;

=== Harvesting ===
Each bean card carries a list of how many beans of that type are needed in order to obtain one, two, three and four coins when harvesting a field. To harvest a field, a player counts the beans in it and consults the list to determine the largest amount of coins he or she can obtain from them. (If not enough beans were harvested, this may end up being none at all.) The player places that many of the cards face down in his or her treasury (each card has a coin on the back). The rest of the cards go on top of the discard pile, face up. Because some of the cards are set aside as coins, the number of cards in the deck becomes fewer with each reshuffle (in practice, the first reshuffle marks approximately halfway through the game).

As mentioned, a field containing just one bean &quot;may not&quot; be harvested by a player who also owns a field containing more than one bean. 

=== Winning ===
When the deck runs out, the discard pile is reshuffled and re-used as the deck; this happens twice. The game ends instantly the third time the deck runs out. At that point, all players harvest all beans in their fields. The player with the most coins in their treasury wins. In case of a tie, the player with the most cards remaining in their hand wins the game.

== Expansions ==
Uwe Rosenberg and Hanno Girke have designed a number of expansions to the game, some of which were released as limited editions by Lookout Games.

;&quot;Erweiterungs-Set&quot; (1997):Adds three more bean types, allowing up to seven people to play. These beans were included in the English edition of the game. This expansion was revised by Amigo in 2001 to include an additional bean type and Order cards.
;&quot;La Isla Bohnitâ&quot; (1999):Adds two new bean types, trading ships, which help bean trading, and pirate ships, which steal beans. While the name parodies Madonna&#x27;s song, the game is Rosenberg&#x27;s answer to &quot;Seafarers of Catan&quot;.
;&quot;High Bohn&quot; (2000):A wild west-themed expansion (cf. &quot;High Noon&quot;) which adds buildings which can be purchased when a player cashes in a field. There is one building type for each bean type, and they each give the player a different advantage to planting, harvesting or trading. Buildings also add to a player&#x27;s score at the end of the game. This expansion was revised by Amigo in 2001 to include Prohibohn, an expansion for &quot;Al Cabohne&quot;. It was released in English by Rio Grande as &quot;High Bohn Plus&quot; in 2004. The English version contains the additional material from the Amigo revision as well as the cards from the &quot;Erweiterungset&quot; revision.
;&quot;Mutabohn&quot; (2001):A GM-themed expansion. In &quot;Mutabohn&quot;, players may &quot;mutate&quot; their beans into less-valuable beans, allowing them to plant different crops in the same field. Bonus cards award points for specific sequences of mutations.
;&quot;Ladybohn&quot; (2002):Adds female versions of the bean types available. Players can earn more thalers by cashing in a field with a female bean at the top. Allows a two player game. This has later (2007) been reworked as &quot;Ladybohn: Manche Mögen&#x27;s Heiss!&quot;
;&quot;Bohnaparte&quot; (2003):A Napoleonic expansion where players play &quot;Bohnanza&quot; to finance a military campaign to conquer the Bohnreich. Girke describes this game as &quot;&quot;Bohnanza&quot; meets &quot;Risk&quot;&quot;.
;&quot;Dschingis Bohn&quot; (2003):Another military expansion where Mongols attack the Bohnreich (cf. Genghis Khan). &quot;Dschingis Bohn&quot; can be combined with &quot;Bohnaparte&quot; to allow seven player games. A combined version of &quot;Bohnaparte&quot; and &quot;Dschingis Bohn&quot; was released in both German and English in 2004.
;&quot;Telebohn&quot; (2004):An expansion in which hostile takeovers replace trading.
;&quot;The Bohnentaler&quot; (2004):Adds a plastic playing piece which allows a player to draw four cards instead of three. A player can only take the piece if they have enough unharvested beans in his fields.
;&quot;Bohnröschen&quot; (2007):An expansion where the players are princes hacking through the briars to reach Sleeping Beauty in her castle. Each step through the briars is represented by a card that needs to be fulfilled in game terms e.g., harvest exactly one bean from a field, and so on) before the player can move on to the next step. This is the first expansion that explicitly states that it needs either &quot;Bohnanza&quot; or &quot;Ladybohn: Manche Mögen&#x27;s Heiss!&quot; to play, but many of the older expansions will work with either base game.
;&quot;Auf der schwäb&#x27;schen Eisenbohn&quot; (2008):An expansion that adds a train that travels between five cities, each of which buy beans from the players at slightly different prices. The name is derived from the German folk song &quot;Auf de Schwäb’sche Eisenbahne&quot;.
;&quot;Bohnedikt&quot; (2009):An expansion that introduces two new types of bean fields, churches and cemeteries. Pope Benedict himself appears in the game as a wild card that can make decrees that affect trading.

== Spinoffs ==

&quot;Bohnanza&quot; has inspired six spinoffs; additionally, one Amigo card game, &quot;Nicht die Bohne&quot;, is named in parody of the game.

;&quot;Space Beans&quot; (1999): A simpler game than &quot;Bohnanza&quot;. Players have one &quot;public&quot; and one &quot;secret&quot; field and can harvest when the number of beans in a field matches the number on a bean, for that number of points. The first player to harvest 30 beans wins.
;&quot;Al Cabohne&quot; (2000): A mafia-themed spinoff (cf. Al Capone) allowing solitaire and two-player games.
;&quot;Bean Trader&quot; (2002): A board game based on &quot;Bohnanza&quot;, released by Amigo and Rio Grande. The German version is called &quot;Bohnhansa&quot; which elaborates the pun as &quot;Hansestadt&quot; refers to a city in the Hanseatic League (i.e. a free port).
;&quot;Rabohnzel&quot; (2005): A spinoff which adds magic to the game of &quot;Bohnanza&quot;
;&quot;Bohnkick&quot; (2006): A card game released in time for the FIFA World Cup 2006 in Germany. It&#x27;s a soccer themed game with beans playing soccer. Most of the beans are caricatures of real soccer players (i.e. Ronaldinho, David Beckham, Zinedine Zidane etc. with Pierluigi Collina as referee)
;&quot;Kannibohne&quot; (2006): A two-player cannibal themed spinoff where the players have magic abilities which can be used to attack each other. These abilities depends on the beans planted.
;&quot;Ladybohn: Manche Mögen&#x27;s Heiss!&quot; (2007): (&quot;Ladybean: Some like it hot&quot;): This is a standalone version of Ladybohn. The title refers to the 1959 Marilyn Monroe movie &quot;Some Like It Hot&quot; and the cover depicts a female bean in Monroe&#x27;s famous air vent pose from &quot;The Seven-Year Itch&quot;.

<doc id="832087" wikidata="Q1073910" url="?curid=832087" title="FSC Żuk">
<text>The Żuk (pl. &quot;beetle&quot;) is a van and light truck produced in Lublin, Poland, between 1958 and 1998 by FSC. It was based on FSO Warszawa, which in turn was licensed from the Soviet passenger car GAZ-M20 Pobeda. The chassis, suspension and engine from FSO Warszawa formed the basis of the Żuk and the Nysa light vans designed in the late 1950s. About were manufactured.

The Żuk was mainly sold to state organizations, but also to individuals. After 1989, with the liberalization of the Polish economy, the Żuk was able to maintain sales to the traditional markets and expand the number sold to individual consumers. The final few years of production was in parallel to its successor, the Lublin van, as a cheaper alternative.

The Żuk came in a range of body styles. The most common were van and light 1.1-ton pickup truck. Rarer variants were minibus and a long-cab truck. Rare for a van, it had independent front suspension. It was very angular, with a number of wide channels running along the side of the body and a completely flat windscreen/windshield. After about ten years in production the front of the cab was restyled, from then on the distinctive side channels no longer continued around onto the front to meet the grille. No further changes were made, except a minor change to the number of vents located above the headlights.

The Żuk was a favourite of farmers, and a common place to find groups of them was at any local market when they were used to transport crops from the fields to the farmers’ own stalls. The Polish postal service (Poczta Polska) used large numbers of Żuks painted in a dull orange colour, and local fire services used them as personnel carriers or even as mini fire engines in country districts.

The Żuk was shipped to the Soviet Union in the panel van form. From the 1970s to about 1990, it was also manufactured in Egypt under licence as ELTRAMCO RAMZES.

== Variants ==
There were two main types of Żuk trucks, the ones with the original slightly &quot;rounded&quot; front and the more angular improved version. The change was made at the end of 1960s. Other modifications were indicated with suffixes M, B and C (for example A11M, A15B or A151C). 

A03: older version pickup with optional tarpaulin cover

A05: older version van, rear compartment has only rear window, no side windows

A06: newer version van, similar to A05 except the nose

A07: van for cargo or passengers (&quot;tow-os&quot;), similar to A06, the rear compartment has side windows

A09: older version flatbed truck with optional tarpaulin covered box

A11: newer version of the A09 flatbed truck

A13: newer version pickup, similar to A03 

A15: firefighter truck, first based on the A05 then later on the A06 van, with reinforced roof structure, added ladder and firefighting equipment storage on the roof, with a portable fire pump and additional equipment (hoses, pickaxe, etc.) in the rear compartment. Also added rotating emergency lights above the cab and a siren (electronic or electromechanical).

A151: firefighter truck similar to A15, with a front-mounted fire pump. The pump was powered by the crankshaft of the truck&#x27;s engine via an electromagnetically actuated clutch

A16: &quot;crew cab&quot; version of the A11, with shorter bed

<doc id="832112" wikidata="Q7980218" url="?curid=832112" title="Weimar political parties">
<text>In the fourteen years the Weimar Republic was in existence, some forty parties were represented in the &quot;Reichstag&quot;. This fragmentation of political power was in part due to the use of a peculiar proportional representation electoral system that encouraged regional or small special interest parties and in part due to the many challenges facing the nascent German democracy in this period.

After the Nazi seizure of power, they used the provisions of the Reichstag Fire Decree to effectively eliminate their chief adversaries, first the Communists (March 1933) and then the Social Democrats (22 June 1933) through arrests, confiscation of assets and removal from office. Other parties were pressured into disbanding on their own or were swept away by the &quot;Law Against the Formation of Parties&quot; (14 July 1933) which declared the Nazi Party to be Germany&#x27;s only legal political party.

==Weimar political parties==
== Other political organizations ==
Besides the larger parties, there were also a multitude of smaller groups and parties that were either affiliated with the electoral coalitions of larger parties or were organizationally independent and participated with their own lists either throughout the entire Republic or only in individual constituencies.
== Unions ==
*&quot;Allgemeiner Deutscher Gewerkschaftsbund&quot; (ADGB)
*&quot;Allgemeiner freier Angestelltenbund&quot; (AfA) white-collar employee union affiliated with the SPD-dominated free trade unions. (Pro-Weimar Republic)
*&quot;Deutscher Landarbeiterverband&quot; (German Agricultural Workers&#x27; Union) SPD-organized. (Pro-Weimar Republic)
*&quot;Deutschnationaler Handlungsgehilfenverband (DHV)&quot; (National Association of Clerical Employees) — the conservative white-collar worker union. The DHV leadership did not fully support the NSDAP because it didn&#x27;t recognize the independence of unions. (Against the government)
*&quot;Freie Arbeiter-Union Deutschlands (FAUD)&quot; — an anarcho-syndicalist trade union that participated in the revolution in Germany and continued to be involved in the German labor movement in the early 1920s.
*&quot;Gesamtverband Deutscher Beamtengewerkschaften (GDB)&quot; was a conservative civil service union.
*&quot;Gewerkschaftsbund der Angestellten (GdA)&quot; was a Hirsch-Duncker union.
*&quot;Gewerkschaftsbund deutscher Angestelltenverbände (Gedag)&quot; was a conservative white-collar union.
*&quot;Reichsbund Deutscher Angestellten-Berufsverbände&quot; was a conservative white-collar union.
*&quot;Vereinigung der chrislichen-deutschen Bauernvereine&quot; (Association of Christian-German Peasant Unions)
*&quot;Zentralverband der Angestellten (ZdA)&quot;, an association of white-collar unions started by the SPD. (Pro-Weimar Republic)

== Other Organizations ==

=== Secret societies ===
*&quot;Bund Wiking&quot; — Viking League. A paramilitary organization founded in Munich in 1923 by members of the banned Organisation Consul as a successor group. Its stated aim was the establishment of a military dictatorship and modification of the Treaty of Versailles by armed means, including provocations intended to incite workers into violence and provide the pretext for a coup.
*&quot;Organisation Consul (OC)&quot; — An ultra-nationalist and anti-Semitic terrorist organization that operated from 1920 to 1922. It was formed by Hermann Ehrhardt and several members of his &quot;Freikorps&quot; brigade. It was responsible for political assassinations, including former Minister of Finance Matthias Erzberger and Foreign Minister Walther Rathenau, that had the goal of destroying the Republic and replacing it with a right-wing dictatorship. The group was banned by the German government in 1922.
*&quot;Schwarze Reichswehr&quot; — Black &quot;Reichswehr&quot;. Extra-legal paramilitary formations promoted by the German &quot;Reichswehr&quot; to circumvent manpower restrictions imposed by the Versailles Treaty.

<doc id="832122" wikidata="Q1652427" url="?curid=832122" title="Space hopper">
<text>A space hopper (also known as a moon hopper, skippyball, kangaroo ball, bouncer, hippity hop, hoppity hop, sit and bounce, or hop ball) is a rubber ball (similar to an exercise ball) with handles that allow one to sit on it without falling off. The user can attempt to hop around on the toy, using its elastic properties to move forward.

The term &quot;space hopper&quot; is more common in the United Kingdom. The toy is less familiar in the United States and may be known as a &quot;hoppity hop&quot;, &quot;hippity hop&quot;, or a &quot;sit and bounce&quot;. A similar toy, popular in the United States in the 1980s, was the pogo ball, which has a hard plastic ring encircling the ball instead of a handle.

==Use==
The space hopper is a heavy rubber ball about in diameter, with two rubber handles protruding from the top. A valve at the top allows the ball to be inflated by a bicycle pump or car tire pump.

A child can sit on top, holding the two handles, and bounce up and down until the ball leaves the ground. By leaning, the driver can make the ball bounce in a particular direction. In practical terms, this is a very inefficient form of locomotion, but its simplicity, ease of use, low cost, and cheerful appearance appeal to children.

==History==
The space hopper was invented by Aquilino Cosani of Ledragomma, an Italian company that manufactured toy rubber balls. He patented the idea in Italy in 1968, and in the United States in 1971. Cosani called the toy &quot;Pon-Pon&quot;.

Space hoppers were introduced to the United Kingdom in 1969. The &quot;Cambridge Evening News&quot; contained an advertisement for the hopper in November of that year and described it as a trend. The space hopper became a major craze for several years and remained widely popular through the 1980s. The toy is sometimes considered a symbol of the 1970s.

The original space hopper in the United Kingdom was manufactured by Mettoy (Mettoy-Corgi). Wembley made a similar model, which had smooth handles rather than the ribbed original. The orange kangaroo design is now available in adult-sized versions in the UK.

In the United States, the first mass-marketed hopping ball was a version of an earlier European toy—the Hoppity Hop, released by the Sun company after it introduced the ball in 1968 at the American International Toy Fair in New York.

Within the first three months, more than 300,000 units were sold across the country. Because of market and media saturation of this toy, any such ball, regardless of origin, is now generally known in the US by that name.

The earliest Hoppity Hops were made of rubber (usually red or blue) with a round ring handle on top and an automotive tire valve for inflation. In the 1970s, Sun introduced various character versions of the Hoppity Hop, such as the Hoppity Horse or Disney&#x27;s Mickey Mouse and Donald Duck (with hard plastic versions of the character&#x27;s head attached to the ball).

The Hoppity Hop sold steadily for decades, but by the 1990s, sales began to slip due to increased competition from foreign hoppers.

According to advertising materials, the Hoppity Hop&#x27;s original targets were both adults and children. Since the balls only inflated to around , however, it is doubtful that any but the shortest adults could have gotten much use out of one.

The European &quot;Hop!&quot; balls appeared in the beginning of the 1990s and are still available. Made by Italy&#x27;s Ledragomma/Ledraplastic, these are essentially an exercise ball with a handle attached. The sizes of these balls range from the &quot;Hop! 45&quot; to the &quot;Hop! 66&quot; (66 cm, about 26 in).

The Hop! 66 is still primarily child-sized. Demand for truly adult-proportioned hopping balls was met with two notable items: The first was Kitt 2000 Velp, of the Netherlands Mega Skippyballs, a large hopping ball that, by virtue of its size, was intended only for adult use. It came in three sizes: , , and .

The Mega Skippyballs are made of extra-strong vinyl, and in the Netherlands, there are various Skippyball races and championships.

<doc id="832128" wikidata="Q358333" url="?curid=832128" title="Liquefied natural gas">
<text>Liquefied natural gas (LNG) is natural gas (predominantly methane, CH4, with some mixture of ethane, C2H6) that has been cooled to liquid form for ease and safety of non-pressurized storage or transport. It takes up about 1/600th the volume of natural gas in the gaseous state at standard conditions for temperature and pressure.

LNG is odorless, colorless, non-toxic and non-corrosive. Hazards include flammability after vaporization into a gaseous state, freezing and asphyxia. The liquefaction process involves removal of certain components, such as dust, acid gases, helium, water, and heavy hydrocarbons, which could cause difficulty downstream. The natural gas is then condensed into a liquid at close to atmospheric pressure by cooling it to approximately ; maximum transport pressure is set at around (gauge pressure), which is about 0.25 times atmospheric pressure at sea level.

The gas extracted from underground hydrocarbon deposits contains a varying mix of hydrocarbon components, which usually includes mostly methane (CH4), along with ethane (C2H6), propane (C3H8) and butane (C4H10). Other gases also occur in natural gas, notably CO2. These gases have wide-ranging boiling points and also different heating values, allowing different routes to commercialization and also different uses. The &quot;acidic&quot; elements such as hydrogen sulphide (H2S) and carbon dioxide (CO2), together with oil, mud, water, and mercury, are removed from the gas to deliver a clean sweetened stream of gas. Failure to remove much or all of such acidic molecules, mercury, and other impurities could result in damage to equipment. Corrosion of steel pipes and amalgamization of mercury to aluminum within cryogenic heat exchangers could cause expensive damage.

The gas stream is typically separated into the liquefied petroleum fractions (butane and propane), which can be stored in liquid form at relatively low pressure, and the lighter ethane and methane fractions. These lighter fractions of methane and ethane are then liquefied to make up the bulk of LNG that is shipped.

Natural gas was considered during the 20th century to be economically unimportant wherever gas-producing oil or gas fields were distant from gas pipelines or located in offshore locations where pipelines were not viable. In the past, this usually meant that natural gas produced was typically flared, especially since unlike oil, no viable method for natural gas storage or transport existed other than compressed gas pipelines to end users of the same gas. This meant that natural gas markets were historically entirely local, and any production had to be consumed within the local or regional network.

Developments of production processes, cryogenic storage, and transportation created the tools required to commercialize natural gas into a global market which now competes with other fuels. Furthermore, the development of LNG storage also introduced a reliability in networks which was previously thought impossible. Given that storage of other fuels is relatively easily secured using simple tanks, a supply for several months could be kept in storage. With the advent of large-scale cryogenic storage, it became possible to create long term gas storage reserves. These reserves of liquefied gas could be deployed at a moment&#x27;s notice through regasification processes, and today are the main means for networks to handle local peak shaving requirements.
== Specific energy content and energy density ==
The heating value depends on the source of gas that is used and the process that is used to liquefy the gas. The range of heating value can span ±10 to 15 percent. A typical value of the higher heating value of LNG is approximately 50 MJ/kg or 21,500 BTU/lb. A typical value of the lower heating value of LNG is 45 MJ/kg or 19,350 BTU/lb.

For the purpose of comparison of different fuels, the heating value may be expressed in terms of energy per volume, which is known as the energy density expressed in MJ/litre. The density of LNG is roughly 0.41 kg/litre to 0.5 kg/litre, depending on temperature, pressure, and composition, compared to water at 1.0 kg/litre. Using the median value of 0.45 kg/litre, the typical energy density values are 22.5 MJ/litre (based on higher heating value) or 20.3 MJ/litre (based on lower heating value).

The volumetric energy density of LNG is approximately 2.4 times that of compressed natural gas (CNG), which makes it economical to transport natural gas by ship in the form of LNG. The energy density of LNG is comparable to propane and ethanol but is only 60 percent that of diesel and 70 percent that of gasoline.

== History ==
Experiments on the properties of gases started early in the 17th century. By the middle of the seventeenth century Robert Boyle had derived the inverse relationship between the pressure and the volume of gases. About the same time, Guillaume Amontons started looking into temperature effects on gas. Various gas experiments continued for the next 200 years. During that time there were efforts to liquefy gases. Many new facts about the nature of gases were discovered. For example, early in the nineteenth century Cagniard de la Tour showed there was a temperature above which a gas could not be liquefied. There was a major push in the mid to late nineteenth century to liquefy all gases. A number of scientists including Michael Faraday, James Joule, and William Thomson (Lord Kelvin) did experiments in this area. In 1886 Karol Olszewski liquefied methane, the primary constituent of natural gas. By 1900 all gases had been liquefied except helium, which was liquefied in 1908.

The first large-scale liquefaction of natural gas in the U.S. was in 1918 when the U.S. government liquefied natural gas as a way to extract helium, which is a small component of some natural gas. This helium was intended for use in British dirigibles for World War I. The liquid natural gas (LNG) was not stored, but regasified and immediately put into the gas mains.

The key patents having to do with natural gas liquefaction date from 1915 and the mid-1930s. In 1915 Godfrey Cabot patented a method for storing liquid gases at very low temperatures. It consisted of a Thermos bottle-type design which included a cold inner tank within an outer tank; the tanks being separated by insulation. In 1937 Lee Twomey received patents for a process for large-scale liquefaction of natural gas. The intention was to store natural gas as a liquid so it could be used for shaving peak energy loads during cold snaps. Because of large volumes it is not practical to store natural gas, as a gas, near atmospheric pressure. However, when liquefied, it can be stored in a volume 1/600th as large. This is a practical way to store it but the gas must be kept at .

There are two processes for liquefying natural gas in large quantities. The first is the cascade process, in which the natural gas is cooled by another gas which in turn has been cooled by still another gas, hence named the &quot;cascade&quot; process. There are usually two cascade cycles before the liquid natural gas cycle. The other method is the Linde process, with a variation of the Linde process, called the Claude process, being sometimes used. In this process, the gas is cooled regeneratively by continually passing and expanding it through an orifice until it is cooled to temperatures at which it liquefies. This process was developed by James Joule and William Thomson and is known as the Joule–Thomson effect. Lee Twomey used the cascade process for his patents.

=== Commercial operations in the United States ===
The East Ohio Gas Company built a full-scale commercial LNG plant in Cleveland, Ohio, in 1940 just after a successful pilot plant built by its sister company, Hope Natural Gas Company of West Virginia. This was the first such plant in the world. Originally it had three spheres, approximately 63 feet in diameter containing LNG at −260 °F. Each sphere held the equivalent of about 50 million cubic feet of natural gas. A fourth tank, a cylinder, was added in 1942. It had an equivalent capacity of 100 million cubic feet of gas. The plant operated successfully for three years. The stored gas was regasified and put into the mains when cold snaps hit and extra capacity was needed. This precluded the denial of gas to some customers during a cold snap.

The Cleveland plant failed on October 20, 1944, when the cylindrical tank ruptured, spilling thousands of gallons of LNG over the plant and nearby neighborhood. The gas evaporated and caught fire, which caused 130 fatalities. The fire delayed further implementation of LNG facilities for several years. However, over the next 15 years new research on low-temperature alloys, and better insulation materials, set the stage for a revival of the industry. It restarted in 1959 when a U.S. World War II Liberty ship, the &quot;Methane Pioneer&quot;, converted to carry LNG, made a delivery of LNG from the U.S. Gulf Coast to energy-starved Great Britain. In June 1964, the world&#x27;s first purpose-built LNG carrier, the &quot;Methane Princess&quot;, entered service. Soon after that a large natural gas field was discovered in Algeria. International trade in LNG quickly followed as LNG was shipped to France and Great Britain from the Algerian fields. One more important attribute of LNG had now been exploited. Once natural gas was liquefied it could not only be stored more easily, but it could be transported. Thus energy could now be shipped over the oceans via LNG the same way it was shipped in the form of oil.

The LNG industry in the U.S. restarted in 1965 with the building of a number of new plants, which continued through the 1970s. These plants were not only used for peak-shaving, as in Cleveland, but also for base-load supplies for places that never had natural gas before this. A number of import facilities were built on the East Coast in anticipation of the need to import energy via LNG. However, a recent boom in U.S. natural gas production (2010–2014), enabled by hydraulic fracturing (&quot;fracking&quot;), has many of these import facilities being considered as export facilities. The first U.S. LNG export was completed in early 2016.

By 2023, the U.S. had become the biggest exporter in the world, and projects already under construction or permitted would double its export capacities by 2027. The largest exporters were Cheniere Energy Inc., Freeport LNG, and Venture Global LNG Inc. The U.S. Energy Information Administration reported that the U.S. had exported 4.3 trillion cubic feet in 2023.

== LNG life cycle ==
The process begins with the pre-treatment of a feedstock of natural gas entering the system to remove impurities such as H2S, CO2, H2O, mercury and higher-chained hydrocarbons. Feedstock gas then enters the liquefaction unit where it is cooled to between -145 °C and -163 °C. Although the type or number of heating cycles and/or refrigerants used may vary based on the technology, the basic process involves circulating the gas through aluminum tube coils and exposure to a compressed refrigerant. As the refrigerant is vaporized, the heat transfer causes the gas in the coils to cool. The LNG is then stored in a specialized double-walled insulated tank at atmospheric pressure ready to be transported to its final destination.

Most domestic LNG is transported by land via truck/trailer designed for cryogenic temperatures. Intercontinental LNG transport travels by special tanker ships. LNG transport tanks comprise an internal steel or aluminum compartment and an external carbon or steel compartment with a vacuum system in between to reduce the amount of heat transfer. Once on site, the LNG must be stored in vacuum insulated or flat bottom storage tanks. When ready for distribution, the LNG enters a regasification facility where it is pumped into a vaporizer and heated back into gaseous form. The gas then enters the gas pipeline distribution system and is delivered to the end-user.

==Production==
The natural gas fed into the LNG plant will be treated to remove water, hydrogen sulfide, carbon dioxide, benzene and other components that will freeze under the low temperatures needed for storage or be destructive to the liquefaction facility. LNG typically contains more than 90% methane. It also contains small amounts of ethane, propane, butane, some heavier alkanes, and nitrogen. The purification process can be designed to give almost 100% methane. One of the risks of LNG is a rapid phase transition explosion (RPT), which occurs when cold LNG comes into contact with water.

The most important infrastructure needed for LNG production and transportation is an LNG plant consisting of one or more LNG trains, each of which is an independent unit for gas liquefaction and purification. A typical train consists of a compression area, propane condenser area, and methane and ethane areas.

The largest LNG train in operation is in Qatar, with a total production capacity of 7.8 million tonnes per annum (MTPA). LNG is loaded onto ships and delivered to a regasification terminal, where the LNG is allowed to expand and reconvert into gas. Regasification terminals are usually connected to a storage and pipeline distribution network to distribute natural gas to local distribution companies (LDCs) or independent power plants (IPPs).

===World total production===


The LNG industry developed slowly during the second half of the last century because most LNG plants are located in remote areas not served by pipelines, and because of the high costs of treating and transporting LNG. Constructing an LNG plant costs at least $1.5 billion per 1 MTPA capacity, a receiving terminal costs $1 billion per 1 bcf/day throughput capacity and LNG vessels cost $200 million–$300 million.

In the early 2000s, prices for constructing LNG plants, receiving terminals and vessels fell as new technologies emerged and more players invested in liquefaction and regasification. This tended to make LNG more competitive as a means of energy distribution, but increasing material costs and demand for construction contractors have put upward pressure on prices in the last few years. 
The standard price for a 125,000 cubic meter LNG vessel built in European and Japanese shipyards used to be US$250 million. When Korean and Chinese shipyards entered the race, increased competition reduced profit margins and improved efficiency—reducing costs by 60 percent. Costs in US dollars also declined due to the devaluation of the currencies of the world&#x27;s largest shipbuilders: the Japanese yen and Korean won.

Since 2004, the large number of orders increased demand for shipyard slots, raising their price and increasing ship costs. The per-ton construction cost of an LNG liquefaction plant fell steadily from the 1970s through the 1990s. The cost reduced by approximately 35 percent. However, recently the cost of building liquefaction and regasification terminals doubled due to increased cost of materials and a shortage of skilled labor, professional engineers, designers, managers and other white-collar professionals.

Due to natural gas shortage concerns in the northeastern U.S. and surplus natural gas in the rest of the country, many new LNG import and export terminals are being contemplated in the United States. Concerns about the safety of such facilities create controversy in some regions where they are proposed. One such location is in the Long Island Sound between Connecticut and Long Island. Broadwater Energy, an effort of TransCanada Corp. and Shell, wishes to build an LNG import terminal in the sound on the New York side. Local politicians including the Suffolk County Executive raised questions about the terminal. In 2005, New York Senators Chuck Schumer and Hillary Clinton also announced their opposition to the project. Several import terminal proposals along the coast of Maine were also met with high levels of resistance and questions. On September 13, 2013, the U.S. Department of Energy approved Dominion Cove Point&#x27;s application to export up to 770 million cubic feet per day of LNG to countries that do not have a free trade agreement with the U.S. In May 2014, the FERC concluded its environmental assessment of the Cove Point LNG project, which found that the proposed natural gas export project could be built and operated safely. Another LNG terminal is currently proposed for Elba Island, Georgia, US. Plans for three LNG export terminals in the U.S. Gulf Coast region have also received conditional Federal approval. In Canada, an LNG export terminal is under construction near Guysborough, Nova Scotia.

==Commercial aspects==

===Global Trade===

In the commercial development of an LNG value chain, LNG suppliers first confirm sales to the downstream buyers and then sign long-term contracts (typically 20–25 years) with strict terms and structures for gas pricing. Only when the customers are confirmed and the development of a greenfield project deemed economically feasible, could the sponsors of an LNG project invest in their development and operation. Thus, the LNG liquefaction business has been limited to players with strong financial and political resources. Major international oil companies (IOCs) such as ExxonMobil, Royal Dutch Shell, BP, Chevron, TotalEnergies and national oil companies (NOCs) such as Pertamina and Petronas are active players.

LNG is shipped around the world in specially constructed seagoing vessels. The trade of LNG is completed by signing an SPA (sale and purchase agreement) between a supplier and receiving terminal, and by signing a GSA (gas sale agreement) between a receiving terminal and end-users. Most of the contract terms used to be DES or ex ship, holding the seller responsible for the transport of the gas. With low shipbuilding costs, and the buyers preferring to ensure reliable and stable supply, however, contracts with FOB terms increased. Under such terms the buyer, who often owns a vessel or signs a long-term charter agreement with independent carriers, is responsible for the transport.

LNG purchasing agreements used to be for a long term with relatively little flexibility both in price and volume. If the annual contract quantity is confirmed, the buyer is obliged to take and pay for the product, or pay for it even if not taken, in what is referred to as the obligation of take-or-pay contract (TOP).

In the mid-1990s, LNG was a buyer&#x27;s market. At the request of buyers, the SPAs began to adopt some flexibilities on volume and price. The buyers had more upward and downward flexibilities in TOP, and short-term SPAs less than 16 years came into effect. At the same time, alternative destinations for cargo and arbitrage were also allowed. By the turn of the 21st century, the market was again in favor of sellers. However, sellers have become more sophisticated and are now proposing sharing of arbitrage opportunities and moving away from S-curve pricing. 

Research from Global Energy Monitor in 2019 warned that up to US$1.3 trillion in new LNG export and import infrastructure currently under development is at significant risk of becoming stranded, as global gas risks becoming oversupplied, particularly if the United States and Canada play a larger role.

The current surge in unconventional oil and gas in the U.S. has resulted in lower gas prices in the U.S. This has led to discussions in Asia&#x27; oil linked gas markets to import gas based on Henry Hub index. Recent high level conference in Vancouver, the Pacific Energy Summit 2013 Pacific Energy Summit 2013 convened policy makers and experts from Asia and the U.S. to discuss LNG trade relations between these regions.

Receiving terminals exist in about 40 countries, including Belgium, Chile, China, the Dominican Republic, France, Greece, India, Italy, Japan, Korea, Poland, Spain, Taiwan, the UK, the US, among others. Plans exist for Bahrain, Germany, Ghana, Morocco, Philippines, Vietnam and others to also construct new receiving (regasification) terminals.

===LNG Project Screening===
Base load (large-scale, &gt;1 MTPA) LNG projects require natural gas reserves, buyers and financing. Using proven technology and a proven contractor is extremely important for both investors and buyers. Gas reserves required: 1 tcf of gas required per Mtpa of LNG over 20 years.

LNG is most cost efficiently produced in relatively large facilities due to economies of scale, at sites with marine access allowing regular large bulk shipments direct to market. This requires a secure gas supply of sufficient capacity. Ideally, facilities are located close to the gas source, to minimize the cost of intermediate transport infrastructure and gas shrinkage (fuel loss in transport). The high cost of building large LNG facilities makes the progressive development of gas sources to maximize facility utilization essential, and the life extension of existing, financially depreciated LNG facilities cost effective. Particularly when combined with lower sale prices due to large installed capacity and rising construction costs, this makes the economic screening/ justification to develop new, and especially greenfield, LNG facilities challenging, even if these could be more environmentally friendly than existing facilities with all stakeholder concerns satisfied. Due to high financial risk, it is usual to contractually secure gas supply/ concessions and gas sales for extended periods before proceeding to an investment decision.

==Uses==
The primary use of LNG is to simplify transport of natural gas from the source to a destination. On the large scale, this is done when the source and the destination are across an ocean from each other. It can also be used when adequate pipeline capacity is not available. For large-scale transport uses, the LNG is typically regassified at the receiving end and pushed into the local natural gas pipeline infrastructure.

LNG can also be used to meet peak demand when the normal pipeline infrastructure can meet most demand needs, but not the peak demand needs. These plants are typically called LNG Peak Shaving Plants as the purpose is to shave off part of the peak demand from what is required out of the supply pipeline.

LNG can be used to fuel internal combustion engines. LNG is in the early stages of becoming a mainstream fuel for transportation needs. It is being evaluated and tested for over-the-road trucking, off-road, marine, and train applications. There are known problems with the fuel tanks and delivery of gas to the engine, but despite these concerns the move to LNG as a transportation fuel has begun. LNG competes directly with compressed natural gas as a fuel for natural gas vehicles since the engine is identical. There may be applications where LNG trucks, buses, trains and boats could be cost-effective in order to regularly distribute LNG energy together with general freight and/or passengers to smaller, isolated communities without a local gas source or access to pipelines.

===Use of LNG to fuel large over-the-road trucks===

China has been a leader in the use of LNG vehicles with over LNG-powered vehicles on the road as of Sept 2014.

In the United States the beginnings of a public LNG fueling capability are being put in place. An alternative fuelling centre tracking site shows 84 public truck LNG fuel centres as of Dec 2016. It is possible for large trucks to make cross country trips such as Los Angeles to Boston and refuel at public refuelling stations every 500 miles. The 2013 National Trucker&#x27;s Directory lists approximately 7,000 truckstops, thus approximately 1% of US truckstops have LNG available.

While as of December 2014 LNG fuel and NGV&#x27;s were not taken to very quickly within Europe and it was questionable whether LNG will ever become the fuel of choice among fleet operators, recent trends from 2018 onwards show different prospect.
During the year 2015, the Netherlands introduced LNG-powered trucks in transport sector. Additionally, the Australian government is planning to develop an LNG highway to utilise the locally produced LNG and replace the imported diesel fuel used by interstate haulage vehicles.

In the year 2015, India also began transporting LNG using LNG-powered road tankers in Kerala state. In 2017, Petronet LNG began setting up 20 LNG stations on highways along the Indian west coast that connect Delhi with Thiruvananthapuram covering a total distance of 4,500 km via Mumbai and Bengaluru. In 2020, India planned to install 24 LNG fuelling stations along the 6,000 km Golden Quadrilateral highways connecting the four metros due to LNG prices decreasing.

Japan, the world&#x27;s largest importer of LNG, is set to begin use of LNG as a road transport fuel.

=== High-power, high-torque engines ===

Engine displacement is an important factor in the power of an internal combustion engine. Thus a 2.0 L engine would typically be more powerful than an 1.8 L engine, but that assumes a similar air–fuel mixture is used.

However, if a smaller engine uses an air–fuel mixture with higher energy density (such as via a turbocharger), then it can produce more power than a larger one burning a less energy-dense air–fuel mixture. For high-power, high-torque engines, a fuel that creates a more energy-dense air–fuel mixture is preferred, because a smaller and simpler engine can produce the same power.

With conventional gasoline and diesel engines the energy density of the air–fuel mixture is limited because the liquid fuels do not mix well in the cylinder. Further, gasoline and diesel fuel have autoignition temperatures and pressures relevant to engine design. An important part of engine design is the interactions of cylinders, compression ratios, and fuel injectors such that pre-ignition is prevented but at the same time as much fuel as possible can be injected, become well mixed, and still have time to complete the combustion process during the power stroke.

Natural gas does not auto-ignite at pressures and temperatures relevant to conventional gasoline and diesel engine design, so it allows more flexibility in design. Methane, the main component of natural gas, has an autoignition temperature of , whereas gasoline and diesel autoignite at approximately and respectively.

With a compressed natural gas (CNG) engine, the mixing of the fuel and the air is more effective since gases typically mix well in a short period of time, but at typical CNG pressures the fuel itself is less energy-dense than gasoline or diesel, so the result is a less energy-dense air–fuel mixture. For an engine of a given cylinder displacement, a normally-aspirated CNG-powered engine is typically less powerful than a gasoline or diesel engine of similar displacement. For that reason turbochargers are popular in European CNG cars. Despite that limitation, the 12-litre Cummins Westport ISX12G engine is an example of a CNG-capable engine designed to pull tractor–trailer loads up to showing CNG can be used in many on-road truck applications. The original ISX G engine incorporated a turbocharger to enhance the air–fuel energy density.

LNG offers a unique advantage over CNG for more demanding high-power applications by eliminating the need for a turbocharger. Because LNG boils at approximately , by using a simple heat exchanger a small amount of LNG can be converted to its gaseous form at extremely high pressure with the use of little or no mechanical energy. A properly designed high-power engine can leverage this extremely-high-pressure, energy-dense gaseous fuel source to create a higher-energy-density air–fuel mixture than can be efficiently created with a CNG-powered engine. The result when compared to CNG engines is more overall efficiency in high-power engine applications when high-pressure direct-injection technology is used. The Westport HDMI2 fuel system is an example of a high-pressure direct-injection system that does not require a turbocharger if paired with an appropriate LNG heat exchanger. The Volvo Trucks 13-litre LNG engine is another example of an LNG engine leveraging advanced high-pressure technology.

Westport recommends CNG for engines 7 litres or smaller and LNG with direct-injection for engines between 20 and 150 litres. For engines between 7 and 20 litres either option is recommended. See slide 13 from their NGV Bruxelles – Industry Innovation Session presentation.

High-power engines in the oil drilling, mining, locomotive, and marine fields have been or are being developed. Paul Blomerus has written a paper concluding as much as 40 million tonnes per annum of LNG (approximately 26.1 billion gallons/year or 71 million gallons/day) could be required just to meet the global needs of such high-power engines by 2025 to 2030.

As of the end of first quarter of 2015, Prometheus Energy Group Inc claimed to have delivered over 100 million gallons of LNG to the industrial market within the previous four years and is continuing to add new customers.

===Use of LNG in maritime applications===

LNG bunkering has been established in some ports via truck-to-ship fueling. This type of LNG fueling is straightforward to implement, assuming a supply of LNG is available.

Feeder and short-sea shipping company Unifeeder has been operating the world&#x27;s first LNG powered container vessel, the Wes Amelie, since late 2017, transiting between the port of Rotterdam and the Baltics on a weekly schedule.
Container shipping company Maersk Group has decided to introduce LNG-powered container ships. The DEME Group has contracted Wärtsilä to power its new generation &#x27;Antigoon&#x27; class dredger with dual fuel (DF) engines. Crowley Maritime of Jacksonville, Florida, launched two LNG-powered ConRo ships, the Coquí and Taino, in 2018 and 2019, respectively.

In 2014, Shell ordered a dedicated LNG bunker vessel. It is planned to go into service in Rotterdam in the summer of 2017

The International Convention for the Prevention of Pollution from Ships (MARPOL), adopted by the IMO, has mandated that marine vessels shall not consume fuel (bunker fuel, diesel, etc.) with a sulphur content greater than 0.5% from the year 2020 within international waters and the coastal areas of countries adopting the same regulation. Replacement of high sulphur bunker fuel with sulphur-free LNG is required on a major scale in the marine transport sector, as low sulphur liquid fuels are costlier than LNG. Japan&#x27;s is planning to use LNG as bunker fuel by 2020.

BHP, one of the largest mining companies in the world, is aiming to commission minerals transport ships powered with LNG by late 2021.

In January 2021, 175 sea-going LNG-powered ships were in service, with another 200 ships ordered.

===Use of LNG on rail===
Florida East Coast Railway has 24 GE ES44C4 locomotives adapted to run on LNG fuel.

==Trade==
The global trade in LNG is growing rapidly from negligible in 1970 to what is expected to be a globally substantial amount by 2020. As a reference, the 2014 global production of crude oil was per day or per year.

In 1970, global LNG trade was of 3 billion cubic metres (bcm) (0.11 quads). In 2011, it was 331 bcm (11.92 quads). The U.S. started exporting LNG in February 2016. The Black &amp; Veatch Oct 2014 forecast is that by 2020, the U.S. alone will export between or by heating value . E&amp;Y projects global LNG demand could hit 400 mtpa (19.7 quads) by 2020. If that occurs, the LNG market will be roughly 10% the size of the global crude oil market, and that does not count the vast majority of natural gas which is delivered via pipeline directly from the well to the consumer.

In 2004, LNG accounted for 7 percent of the world&#x27;s natural gas demand. The global trade in LNG, which has increased at a rate of 7.4 percent per year over the decade from 1995 to 2005, is expected to continue to grow substantially. LNG trade is expected to increase at 6.7 percent per year from 2005 to 2020.

Until the mid-1990s, LNG demand was heavily concentrated in Northeast Asia: Japan, South Korea and Taiwan. At the same time, Pacific Basin supplies dominated world LNG trade. The worldwide interest in using natural gas-fired combined cycle generating units for electric power generation, coupled with the inability of North American and North Sea natural gas supplies to meet the growing demand, substantially broadened the regional
markets for LNG. It also brought new Atlantic Basin and Middle East suppliers into the trade.
By the end of 2017, there were 19 LNG exporting countries and 40 LNG importing countries. The three biggest LNG exporters in 2017 were Qatar (77.5 MT), Australia (55.6 MT) and Malaysia (26.9 MT). The three biggest LNG importers in 2017 were Japan (83.5 MT), China (39 MT) and South Korea (37.8 MT). LNG trade volumes increased from 142 MT in 2005 to 159 MT in 2006, 165 MT in 2007, 171 MT in 2008, 220 MT in 2010, 237 MT in 2013, 264 MT in 2016 and 290 MT in 2017. Global LNG production was 246 MT in 2014, most of which was used in trade between countries. During the next several years there would be significant increase in volume of LNG Trade. For example, about 59 MTPA of new LNG supply from six new plants came to market just in 2009, including:
*Northwest Shelf Train 5: 4.4 MTPA
*Sakhalin-II: 9.6 MTPA
*Yemen LNG: 6.7 MTPA
*Tangguh: 7.6 MTPA
*Qatargas: 15.6 MTPA
*Rasgas Qatar: 15.6 MTPA

In 2006, Qatar became the world&#x27;s biggest exporter of LNG. As of 2012, Qatar is the source of 25 percent of the world&#x27;s LNG exports. As of 2017, Qatar was estimated to supply 26.7% of the world&#x27;s LNG.

Investments in U.S. export facilities were increasing by 2013, these investments were spurred by increasing shale gas production in the United States and a large price differential between natural gas prices in the U.S. and those in Europe and Asia. Cheniere Energy became the first company in the United States to receive permission and export LNG in 2016. After a US-EU agreement in 2018, exports from USA to EU increased. In November 2021, U.S. producer Venture Global LNG signed a twenty-year contract with China&#x27;s state-owned Sinopec to supply liquefied natural gas. China&#x27;s imports of U.S. natural gas will more than double. U.S. exports of liquefied natural gas to China and other Asian countries surged in 2021, with Asian buyers willing to pay higher prices than European importers. This reversed in 2022, when most of US LNG went to Europe. US LNG export contracts are mainly made for 15–20 years. Exports from the U.S. are likely to reach 13.3 Bcf/d in 2024 due to projects coming online on the Gulf of Mexico.

===Imports===
In 1964, the UK and France made the first LNG trade, buying gas from Algeria, witnessing a new era of energy.

In 2014, 19 countries exported LNG.

Compared with the crude oil market, in 2013 the natural gas market was about 72 percent of the crude oil market (measured on a heat equivalent basis), of which LNG forms a small but rapidly growing part. Much of this growth is driven by the need for clean fuel and some substitution effect due to the high price of oil (primarily in the heating and electricity generation sectors).

Japan, South Korea, Spain, France, Italy and Taiwan import large volumes of LNG due to their shortage of energy. In 2005, Japan imported 58.6 million tons of LNG, representing some 30 percent of the LNG trade around the world that year. Also in 2005, South Korea imported 22.1 million tons, and in 2004 Taiwan imported 6.8 million tons. These three major buyers purchase approximately two-thirds of the world&#x27;s LNG demand. In addition, Spain imported some 8.2 MTPA in 2006, making it the third largest importer. France also imported similar quantities as Spain. Following the Fukushima Daiichi nuclear disaster in March 2011 Japan became a major importer accounting for one third of the total.
European LNG imports fell by 30 percent in 2012, and fell further by 24 percent in 2013, as South American and Asian importers paid more. European LNG imports increased to new heights in 2019, remained high in 2020 and 2021, and increased even more in 2022. Main contributors were Qatar, USA, and Russia.

In 2017, global LNG imports reached 289.8 million tonnes of LNG. In 2017, 72.9% of global LNG demand was located in Asia.

===Cargo diversion===
Based on the LNG SPAs, LNG is destined for pre-agreed destinations, and diversion of that LNG is not allowed. However, if Seller and Buyer make a mutual agreement, then the diversion of the cargo is permitted — subject to sharing the additional profit created by such a diversion, by paying a penalty fee. In the European Union and some other jurisdictions, it is not permitted to apply the profit-sharing clause in LNG SPAs.

===Cost of LNG plants===

For an extended period of time, design improvements in liquefaction plants and tankers had the effect of reducing costs.

In the 1980s, the cost of building an LNG liquefaction plant cost $350/tpa (tonne per annum). In the 2000s, it was $200/tpa. In 2012, the costs can go as high as $1,000/tpa, partly due to the increase in the price of steel.

As recently as 2003, it was common to assume that this was a &quot;learning curve&quot; effect and would continue into the future. But this perception of steadily falling costs for LNG has been dashed in the last several years.

The construction cost of greenfield LNG projects started to skyrocket from 2004 afterward and has increased from about $400 per ton per year of capacity to $1,000 per ton per year of capacity in 2008.

The main reasons for skyrocketed costs in LNG industry can be described as follows:

#Low availability of EPC contractors as result of extraordinary high level of ongoing petroleum projects worldwide.
#High raw material prices as result of surge in demand for raw materials.
#Lack of skilled and experienced workforce in LNG industry.
#Devaluation of US dollar.
#Very complex nature of projects built in remote locations and where construction costs are regarded as some of the highest in the world.

Excluding high cost projects the increase of 120% over the period 2002-2012 is more in line with escalation in the upstream oil &amp; gas industry as reported by the UCCI index

The 2007–2008 financial crisis and the Great Recession led to a general decline in raw material and equipment prices, which somewhat lessened the construction cost of LNG plants. However, by 2012 this was more than offset by increasing demand for materials and labor for the LNG market.

====Small-scale liquefaction plants====
Small-scale liquefaction plants are suitable for peakshaving on natural gas pipelines, transportation fuel, or for deliveries of natural gas to remote areas not connected to pipelines. They typically have a compact size, are fed from a natural gas pipeline, and are located close to the location where the LNG will be used. This proximity decreases transportation and LNG product costs for consumers. It also avoids the additional greenhouse gas emissions generated during long transportation.

The small-scale LNG plant also allows localized peakshaving to occur—balancing the availability of natural gas during high and low periods of demand. It also makes it possible for communities without access to natural gas pipelines to install local distribution systems and have them supplied with stored LNG.

==LNG pricing==

There are three major pricing systems in the current LNG contracts:
*Oil indexed contract, used primarily in Japan, Korea, Taiwan and China;
*Oil, oil products and other energy carriers indexed contracts, used primarily in Continental Europe; and
*Market indexed contracts, used in the US and the UK.

The formula for an indexed price is as follows:

CP = BP + β X
*BP: constant part or base price
*β: gradient
*X: indexation

The formula has been widely used in Asian LNG SPAs, where base price represents various non-oil factors, but usually a constant determined by negotiation at a level which can prevent LNG prices from falling below a certain level. It thus varies regardless of oil price fluctuation.

===Henry Hub Plus===
Some LNG buyers have already signed contracts for future US-based cargos at prices linked to Henry Hub prices. Cheniere Energy&#x27;s LNG export contract pricing consists of a fixed fee (liquefaction tolling fee) plus 115% of Henry Hub per million British thermal units of LNG. Tolling fees in the Cheniere contracts vary: US with BG Group signed in 2011; with Spain&#x27;s GNF signed in 2012; and with South Korea&#x27;s Kogas and Centrica signed in 2013.

===Oil parity===

Oil parity is the LNG price that would be equal to that of crude oil on a barrel of oil equivalent (BOE) basis. If the LNG price exceeds the price of crude oil in BOE terms, then the situation is called broken oil parity. A coefficient of 0.1724 results in full oil parity. In most cases the price of LNG is less than the price of crude oil in BOE terms.

In 2009, in several spot cargo deals especially in East Asia, oil parity approached the full oil parity or even exceeded oil parity. In January 2016, the spot LNG price of has broken oil parity when the Brent crude price (≤32 US$/bbl) has fallen steeply. By the end of June 2016, LNG price has fallen by nearly 50% below its oil parity price, making it more economical than more-polluting diesel/gas oil in the transport sector. LNG briefly touched the oil parity in winter of 2018/2019 and then rose above it during the recent global energy crisis in mid-2021 only falling below it in early 2024.

=== S-curve ===
Most of the LNG trade is governed by long-term contracts. Many formulae include an S-curve, where the price formula is different above and below a certain oil price, to dampen the impact of high oil prices on the buyer, and low oil prices on the seller. When the spot LNG price is cheaper than long term oil price indexed contracts, the most profitable LNG end use is to power mobile engines for replacing costly gasoline and diesel consumption.

In most of the East Asian LNG contracts, price formula is indexed to a basket of crude imported to Japan called the Japan Crude Cocktail (JCC). In Indonesian LNG contracts, price formula is linked to Indonesian Crude Price (ICP).

In continental Europe, the price formula indexation does not follow the same format, and it varies from contract to contract. Brent crude price (B), heavy fuel oil price (HFO), light fuel oil price (LFO), gas oil price (GO), coal price, electricity price and in some cases, consumer and producer price indexes are the indexation elements of price formulas.

===Price review===
Usually there exists a clause allowing parties to trigger the price revision or price reopening in LNG SPAs. In some contracts there are two options for triggering a price revision. regular and special. Regular ones are the dates that will be agreed and defined in the LNG SPAs for the purpose of price review.

==Quality of LNG==
LNG quality is one of the most important issues in the LNG business. Any gas which does not conform to the agreed specifications in the sale and purchase agreement is regarded as &quot;off-specification&quot; (off-spec) or &quot;off-quality&quot; gas or LNG. Quality regulations serve three purposes:

:1 – to ensure that the gas distributed is non-corrosive and non-toxic, below the upper limits for H2S, total sulphur, CO2 and Hg content;

:2 – to guard against the formation of liquids or hydrates in the networks, through maximum water and hydrocarbon dewpoints;

:3 – to allow interchangeability of the gases distributed, via limits on the variation range for parameters affecting combustion: content of inert gases, calorific value, Wobbe index, Soot Index, Incomplete Combustion Factor, Yellow Tip Index, etc.

In the case of off-spec gas or LNG the buyer can refuse to accept the gas or LNG and the seller has to pay liquidated damages for the respective off-spec gas volumes.

The quality of gas or LNG is measured at delivery point by using an instrument such as a gas chromatograph.

The most important gas quality concerns involve the sulphur and mercury content and the calorific value. Due to the sensitivity of liquefaction facilities to sulfur and mercury elements, the gas being sent to the liquefaction process shall be accurately refined and tested in order to assure the minimum possible concentration of these two elements before entering the liquefaction plant, hence there is not much concern about them.

However, the main concern is the heating value of gas. Usually natural gas markets can be divided in three markets in terms of heating value:

*Asia (Japan, Korea, Taiwan), where gas distributed is rich, with a gross calorific value (GCV) higher than 43 MJ/m3(n), i.e. 1,090 Btu/scf,
*the UK and the US, where distributed gas is lean, with a GCV usually lower than 42 MJ/m3(n), i.e. 1,065 Btu/scf,
*Continental Europe, where the acceptable GCV range is quite wide: approx. 39 to 46 MJ/m3(n), i.e. 990 to 1,160 Btu/scf.

There are some methods to modify the heating value of produced LNG to the desired level. For the purpose of increasing the heating value, injecting propane and butane is a solution. For the purpose of decreasing heating value, nitrogen injecting and extracting butane and propane are proven solutions. Blending with gas or LNG can be a solution; however all of these solutions while theoretically viable can be costly and logistically difficult to manage in large scale. Lean LNG price in terms of energy value is lower than the rich LNG price.

==Liquefaction technology==

There are several liquefaction processes available for large, baseload LNG plants (in order of prevalence):
#AP-C3MR – designed by Air Products &amp; Chemicals, Inc. (APCI)
#Cascade – designed by ConocoPhillips
#AP-X – designed by Air Products &amp; Chemicals, Inc. (APCI)
#AP-SMR (Single Mixed Refrigerant) – designed by Air Products &amp; Chemicals, Inc. (APCI)
#AP-N (Nitrogen Refrigerant) – designed by Air Products &amp; Chemicals, Inc. (APCI)
#MFC (mixed fluid cascade) – designed by Linde
#PRICO (SMR) – designed by Black &amp; Veatch
#AP-DMR (Dual Mixed Refrigerant) – designed by Air Products &amp; Chemicals, Inc. (APCI)
#Liquefin – designed by Air Liquide

As of January 2016, global nominal LNG liquefaction capacity was 301.5 MTPA (million tonnes per annum), with a further 142 MTPA under construction.

The majority of these trains use either APCI AP-C3MR or Cascade technology for the liquefaction process. The other processes, used in a small minority of some liquefaction plants, include Shell&#x27;s DMR (double-mixed refrigerant) technology and the Linde technology.

APCI technology is the most-used liquefaction process in LNG plants: out of 100 liquefaction trains onstream or under-construction, 86 trains with a total capacity of 243 MTPA have been designed based on the APCI process. Phillips&#x27; Cascade process is the second most-used, used in 10 trains with a total capacity of 36.16 MTPA. The Shell DMR process has been used in three trains with total capacity of 13.9 MTPA; and, finally, the Linde/Statoil process is used in the Snohvit 4.2 MTPA single train.

Floating liquefied natural gas (FLNG) facilities float above an offshore gas field, and produce, liquefy, store and transfer LNG (and potentially LPG and condensate) at sea before carriers ship it directly to markets. The first FLNG facility is now in development by Shell, due for completion in 2018.

===Storage===

Modern LNG storage tanks are typically of the full containment type, which has a prestressed concrete outer wall and a high-nickel steel inner tank, with extremely efficient insulation between the walls. Large tanks are low aspect ratio (height to width) and cylindrical in design with a domed steel or concrete roof. Storage pressure in these tanks is very low, less than . Sometimes more expensive underground tanks are used for storage.
Smaller quantities (say and less) may be stored in horizontal or vertical, vacuum-jacketed, pressure vessels. These tanks may be at pressures anywhere from less than 50 to over  kPa ().

LNG must be kept cold to remain a liquid, independent of pressure. Despite efficient insulation, there will inevitably be some heat leakage into the LNG, resulting in vaporisation of the LNG. This boil-off gas acts to keep the LNG cold (see &quot;Refrigeration&quot; below). The boil-off gas is typically compressed and exported as natural gas, or it is reliquefied and returned to storage.

===Transportation===


LNG is transported in specially designed ships with double hulls protecting the cargo systems from damage or leaks. There are several special leak test methods available to test the integrity of an LNG vessel&#x27;s membrane cargo tanks.

The tankers cost around US$200 million each.

Transportation and supply is an important aspect of the gas business, since natural gas reserves are normally quite distant from consumer markets. Natural gas has far more volume than oil to transport, and most gas is transported by pipelines. There is a natural gas pipeline network in the former Soviet Union, Europe and North America. Natural gas is less dense, even at higher pressures. Natural gas will travel much faster than oil through a high-pressure pipeline, but can transmit only about a fifth of the amount of energy per day due to the lower density. Natural gas is usually liquefied to LNG at the end of the pipeline, before shipping.

Short LNG pipelines for use in moving product from LNG vessels to onshore storage are available. Longer pipelines, which allow vessels to offload LNG at a greater distance from port facilities, are under development. This requires pipe-in-pipe technology due to requirements for keeping the LNG cold.

LNG is transported using tanker trucks, railway tanker cars, and purpose built ships known as LNG carriers. LNG is sometimes taken to cryogenic temperatures to increase the tanker capacity. The first commercial ship-to-ship transfer (STS) transfers were undertaken in February 2007 at the Flotta facility in Scapa Flow with 132,000 m3 of LNG being passed between the vessels Excalibur and Excelsior. Transfers have also been carried out by Exmar Shipmanagement, the Belgian gas tanker owner in the Gulf of Mexico, which involved the transfer of LNG from a conventional LNG carrier to an LNG regasification vessel (LNGRV). Before this commercial exercise, LNG had only ever been transferred between ships on a handful of occasions as a necessity following an incident. The Society of International Gas Tanker and Terminal Operators (SIGTTO) is the responsible body for LNG operators around the world and seeks to disseminate knowledge regarding the safe transport of LNG at sea.

Besides LNG vessels, LNG is also used in some aircraft.

====Terminals====

Liquefied natural gas is used to transport natural gas over long distances, often by sea. In most cases, LNG terminals are purpose-built ports used exclusively to export or import LNG.

The United Kingdom has LNG import facilities for up to 50 billion cubic meters per year.

===Refrigeration===
The insulation, as efficient as it is, will not keep LNG cold enough by itself. Inevitably, heat leakage will warm and vapourise the LNG. Industry practice is to store LNG as a boiling cryogen. That is, the liquid is stored at its boiling point for the pressure at which it is stored (atmospheric pressure). As the vapour boils off, heat for the phase change cools the remaining liquid. Because the insulation is very efficient, only a relatively small amount of boil-off is necessary to maintain temperature. This phenomenon is also called auto-refrigeration.

Boil-off gas from land based LNG storage tanks is usually compressed and fed to natural gas pipeline networks. Some LNG carriers use boil-off gas for fuel.

==Environmental concerns==
Natural gas could be considered the least environmentally harmful fossil fuel because it has the lowest CO2 emissions per unit of energy and is suitable for use in high efficiency combined cycle power stations. For an equivalent amount of heat, burning natural gas produces about 30 percent less carbon dioxide than burning petroleum and about 45 per cent less than burning coal. Biomethane is considered roughly -neutral and avoids most of the -emissions issue. If liquefied (as LBM), it serves the same functions as LNG.

On a per kilometer transported basis, emissions from LNG are lower than piped natural gas, which is a particular issue in Europe, where significant amounts of gas are piped several thousand kilometers from Russia. However, emissions from natural gas transported as LNG can be higher than those of natural gas produced regionally and piped to the point of combustion, as emissions associated with transport are lower for the latter.

However, on the West Coast of the United States, where up to three new LNG importation terminals were proposed before the U.S. fracking boom, environmental groups, such as Pacific Environment, Ratepayers for Affordable Clean Energy (RACE), and Rising Tide had moved to oppose them. They claimed that, while natural gas power plants emit approximately half the carbon dioxide of an equivalent coal power plant, the natural gas combustion required to produce and transport LNG to the plants adds 20 to 40 percent more carbon dioxide than burning natural gas alone. A 2015 peer-reviewed study evaluated the full end-to-end life cycle of LNG produced in the U.S. and consumed in Europe or Asia. It concluded that global production would be reduced due to the resulting reduction in other fossil fuels burned. 

Some scientists and local residents have raised concerns about the potential effect of Poland&#x27;s underground LNG storage infrastructure on marine life in the Baltic Sea. Similar concerns were raised in Croatia.

===Safety and accidents===
Natural gas is a fuel and a combustible substance. To ensure safe and reliable operation, particular measures are taken in the design, construction and operation of LNG facilities. In maritime transport, the regulations for the use of LNG as a marine fuel are set out in the IGF Code.

In its liquid state, LNG is not explosive and can not ignite. For LNG to burn, it must first vaporize, then mix with air in the proper proportions (the flammable range is 5 percent to 15 percent), and then be ignited. In the case of a leak, LNG vaporizes rapidly, turning into a gas (methane plus trace gases), and mixing with air. If this mixture is within the flammable range, there is risk of ignition, which would create fire and thermal radiation hazards.

Gas venting from vehicles powered by LNG may create a flammability hazard if parked indoors for longer than a week. Additionally, due to its low temperature, refueling an LNG-powered vehicle requires training to avoid the risk of frostbite.

LNG tankers have sailed over 100 million miles without a shipboard death or even a major accident.

Several on-site accidents involving or related to LNG are listed below:
* October 20, 1944, Cleveland, Ohio, U.S. The East Ohio Natural Gas Co. experienced a failure of an LNG tank. 128 people perished in the explosion and fire. The tank did not have a dike retaining wall, and it was made during World War II, when metal rationing was very strict. The steel of the tank was made with an extremely low amount of nickel, which meant the tank was brittle when exposed to the cryogenic nature of LNG. The tank ruptured, spilling LNG into the city sewer system. The LNG vaporized and turned into gas, which exploded and burned.
* February 10, 1973, Staten Island, New York, U.S. During a cleaning operation, 42 workers were inside one of the TETCo LNG tanks, which had supposedly been completely drained ten months earlier. However, ignition occurred, causing a plume of combusting gas to rise within the tank. Two workers near the top felt the heat and rushed to the safety of scaffolding outside, while the other 40 workers died as the concrete cap on the tank rose 20–30 feet in the air and then came crashing back down, crushing them to death.
* October 6, 1979, Lusby, Maryland, US. A pump seal failed at the Cove Point LNG import facility, releasing natural gas vapors (not LNG), which entered an electrical conduit. A worker switched off a circuit breaker, which ignited the gas vapors. The resulting explosion killed a worker, severely injured another and caused heavy damage to the building. A safety analysis was not required at the time, and none was performed during the planning, design or construction of the facility. National fire codes were changed as a result of the accident.
* January 19, 2004, Skikda, Algeria. Explosion at Sonatrach LNG liquefaction facility. 27 killed, 56 injured, three LNG trains destroyed, a marine berth damaged. 2004 production was reduced by 76 percent. Total loss was US$900 million. A steam boiler that was part of an LNG liquefaction train exploded, triggering a massive hydrocarbon gas explosion. The explosion occurred where propane and ethane refrigeration storage were located. Site distribution of the units caused a domino effect of explosions. It remains unclear if LNG or LNG vapour, or other hydrocarbon gases forming part of the liquefaction process initiated the explosions. One report, of the US Government Team Site Inspection of the Sonatrach Skikda LNG Plant in Skikda, Algeria, March 12–16, 2004, has cited it was a leak of hydrocarbons from the refrigerant (liquefaction) process system.

==Security concerns==

On 8 May 2018, the United States withdrew from the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action with Iran, reinstating Iran sanctions against their nuclear program. In response, Iran threatened to close off the Strait of Hormuz to international shipping. The Strait of Hormuz is a strategic route through which a third of the world&#x27;s LNG passes from Middle East producers.

In January 2024, Qatar halted tankers of liquefied natural gas through the strait of Bab-el-Mandeb after US-led airstrikes on Houthi targets in Yemen increased risks in the strait. The LNG tankers were forced to sail around Africa via the Cape of Good Hope to avoid the war zone.

<text>Frank James Malzone (February 28, 1930 – December 29, 2015) was an American Major League Baseball third baseman who played for the Boston Red Sox (1955–65) and California Angels (1966).

==Early years==
Malzone was born on February 28, 1930, in the Bronx, New York. He was the son of an Italian immigrant, Francis Malzone, and Pauline (Dazago) Malzone. He was signed as a free agent out of Samuel Gompers High School by the Boston Red Sox in 1947, and was the first Gompers graduate to reach the major leagues.

==Career==
Malzone spent 11 seasons with Boston and is among the all-time Red Sox leaders in several categories. He batted .276 with 131 home runs and 716 runs batted in in 1359 games. He finished up with the Angels, playing 82 games in 1966.

=== Minor league and military career ===
In 1948, shortly after turning 18, the Red Sox assigned Malzone to the Milford Red Sox. The team was located in Milford, Delaware, part of the Eastern Shore League. He had a .304 batting average that year. In 1949, he was assigned to the Oneonta Red Sox of the Canadian-American League, where he hit .329, with 107 runs scored and 92 runs batted in, with 26 doubles and 26 triples. He suffered an ankle injury in 1950, and played in only two games. In 1951, he played for the Scranton Red Sox in the Eastern League, but served in the U.S. Army in 1952 and 1953. He played for the Louisville Colonels of the American Association in 1954 and 1955, hitting .270 and .310 respectively.

=== Major league career ===

Malzone made his Boston debut in September 1955, playing in six games for the Red Sox that year. On September 20, 1955, he went 6-for-10 in a doubleheader against Baltimore. In 1956, he started out with the Red Sox and played in 27 games, but was hitting poorly. He was sent to the San Franscisco Seals of the Pacific Coast League, playing in 87 games. Some in the organization thought the death of his 15-month old daughter Suzanne weighed heavily on Malzone.

In 1957, in his first full season with the Red Sox, he became the starting third baseman, and hit .292 and had a career-high 103 RBI. He tied an American League record for a third baseman with 10 assists in a game. He became the first player to lead the league at his position in games played, putouts, errors, assists, double plays and fielding percentage. He received the inaugural Gold Glove Award at third base, which was given to only one player in both leagues for each position in 1957. Casey Stengel also chose him as a reserve for the 1957 American League All-Star Team.

In 1958, Malzone led the league with 627 at-bats, games played (playing in every Red Sox game), and hit a career-high .295. Malzone had been third in the league in games played in 1957 (153), would be second in 1959 (154), and fifth in 1960 (152). The American League regular season went from 154 games to 162 games in 1961 (followed by the National League in 1962). Malzone played in over 150 games seven years in a row (1957-1963), and had a streak of playing in 475 consecutive games.

Through 1961, he tied an American League record by leading all third basemen in double plays for five seasons (with Ken Keltner), and was the first to do so in five consecutive seasons, both of which still stand as of 2024. As of 2024, Malzone was 34th all time in double plays made by third basemen, even though only playing 12 years. Malzone enjoyed his best season in 1962, batting .283 with 21 home runs and 95 RBI. When Red Sox legend Carl Yastrzemski joined the team in 1961, Malzone took Yastrzemski under his wing.

He was an All-Star at third base eight times (1957, 1958, twice in 1959, twice in 1960, 1963, and 1964). From 1959 to 1962, there were two All-Star Games annually, the second game to raise money for the players&#x27; pension fund. In 1959&#x27;s second All-Star Game, Malzone hit a home run against future hall of fame pitcher Don Drysdale. Malzone won three straight Gold Glove Awards; in 1957 for both leagues, and in 1958-1959 for the American League. He was the last American League third baseman to win a Gold Glove prior to Brooks Robinson&#x27;s 16-year run at third base.

The Red Sox released Malzone after the 1965 season, but informed him he would have a place with the team once he retired. In 1966, Malzone&#x27;s final season as a player, he played 82 games with the California Angels, batting only .206.

In his playing career, Malzone compiled a total record of a .274 lifetime batting average, 133 home runs, 728 RBI, 647 runs, 239 doubles, 21 triples, and 14 stolen bases in 1,441 games.

=== Scouting and consulting ===
After leaving the Angels, Malzone became a scout for the Red Sox in New England. He was an advance scout, following other teams the Red Sox played in the 1967 pennant race and World Series and providing reports on these opponents. In total, he was an advance scout for 28 years. He also did instructional work with Red Sox players, such as Rico Petrocelli and Jim Rice. He remained on the Red Sox payroll as a &quot;player development consultant&quot; for many years after his retirement from scouting.

Malzone was inducted into the Boston Red Sox Hall of Fame in its inaugural Class of 1995.

== Death ==
He died on December 29, 2015.

<text>The Finn Brothers are a New Zealand musical duo consisting of brothers Neil and Tim Finn. In June 1993 both members were awarded the OBE for their contribution to music.

The two brothers began making music together at a young age; later, when Neil was 18, he was invited to join older brother Tim in Split Enz. Neil would go on to write one of the band&#x27;s biggest hits, &quot;I Got You&quot;. Tim released his first solo album &quot;Escapade&quot; before leaving Split Enz, and the band folded soon after. Neil started his own group, Crowded House and subsequently recorded two solo albums after Crowded House split in 1996. He reformed Crowded House in 2007, releasing three albums since then. Neil and Tim have also released a series of separate solo albums.

After working on a few songs with Neil, Tim joined Crowded House for the &quot;Woodface&quot; album and accompanying tour in 1991.

==History==
===&quot;Woodface&quot; and &quot;Finn&quot;===
Tim and Neil intended to start the Finn brothers project after a three-week song writing spree in 1989. However, most of the songs written during this time were deemed suitable for inclusion on a Crowded House album and they appeared on Woodface, which was released in 1991 and led to Tim joining Crowded House. Many of the original demo recordings from these sessions were subsequently released as B-sides on Finn Brothers singles and recently collected on a vinyl re-release of Finn. Tim left Crowded House while they were touring Europe in support of the &quot;Woodface&quot; album.

Tim and Neil reconvened in 1995, and the eclectic, lo-fi album which resulted was simply called Finn. In the UK the duo changed both their name and that of the album to Finn Brothers, to avoid confusion with a band going under the moniker Fin. This title was kept for all future collaborations. However re-releases of the original album in Australia and New Zealand still go by the original title &quot;Finn&quot;.

===&quot;Everyone Is Here&quot;===
Their second album, &quot;Everyone Is Here&quot; was released in 2004. It was recorded twice, once in upstate New York with producer Tony Visconti, bassist Bones Hillman and Ross Burge on drums, then again six months later in Los Angeles with Crowded House producer Mitchell Froom and different session musicians. Some of the songs from the first recording session were kept as B sides and later appeared on a special edition of the album. The album featured the Split Enz song &quot;Edible Flowers&quot;, the inspiration for the music video. The music video features two people in a donkey suit, however its wearers cannot be seen. In the 2005 tour, Neil and Tim Finn wore a donkey suit onto stage for many performances also.

Following the Boxing Day tsunami, The Finn Brothers appeared at the Wave Aid fundraising concert in Sydney to help raise funds for aid organisations working in disaster affected areas. As well as their own material, they performed a cover of Hunters and Collectors&#x27; &quot;Throw Your Arms Around Me.&quot;

==Television and film==
Their song, &quot;Anything Can Happen&quot; was used in the first episode of Scrubs&#x27; fifth season, &quot;My Intern&#x27;s Eyes&quot;. 
The song was used when we first meet Keith Dudemeister (albeit through his eyes) as he walks into his first day at Sacred Heart. 

This song was also used on the final session of the last day of the 2005 England vs. Australia Ashes cricket series on Channel 4 Television, at the end of the last day of cricket being shown on British terrestrial television.

The song &quot;Anything Can Happen&quot; was also featured in movie &quot;Aurora Borealis&quot;.

Their song &quot;Luckiest Man Alive&quot; was played during the closing credits of the television broadcast of the 2005 Indianapolis 500.

<doc id="832158" wikidata="Q191356" url="?curid=832158" title="Icelanders">
<text>Icelanders () are an ethnic group and nation who are native to the island country of Iceland. They speak Icelandic, a North Germanic language.

Icelanders established the country of Iceland in mid 930 CE when the (parliament) met for the first time. Iceland came under the reign of Norwegian, Swedish and Danish kings but regained full sovereignty from the Danish monarchy on 1 December 1918, when the Kingdom of Iceland was established. On 17 June 1944, Iceland became a republic. Lutheranism is the predominant religion. Historical and DNA records indicate that around 60 to 80 percent of the male settlers were of Norse origin (primarily from Western Norway) and a similar percentage of the women were of Gaelic stock from Ireland and peripheral Scotland.

== History ==
Iceland is a geologically young land mass, having formed an estimated 20 million years ago due to volcanic eruptions on the Mid-Atlantic Ridge. One of the last larger islands to remain uninhabited, the first human settlement date is generally accepted to be 874, although there is some evidence to suggest human activity prior to the Norse arrival.

=== Initial migration and settlement ===
The first Viking to sight Iceland was Gardar Svavarsson, who went off course due to harsh conditions when sailing from Norway to the Faroe Islands. His reports led to the first efforts to settle the island. Flóki Vilgerðarson (b. 9th century) was the first Norseman to sail to Iceland intentionally. His story is documented in the manuscript, and he is said to have named the island Ísland (Iceland). The first permanent settler in Iceland is usually considered to have been a Norwegian chieftain named Ingólfur Arnarson. He settled with his family in around 874, at a place he named &quot;Bay of Smokes&quot;, or Reykjavík in Icelandic.

Following Ingólfur, and also in 874, another group of Norwegians set sail across the North Atlantic Ocean with their families, livestock, slaves, and possessions, escaping the domination of the first King of Norway, Harald Fairhair. They traveled in their Viking longships to the island of Iceland. These people were primarily of Norwegian, Irish or Gaelic Scottish origin. The Irish and the Scottish Gaels were either slaves or servants of the Norse chiefs, according to the Icelandic sagas, or descendants of a &quot;group of Norsemen who had settled in Scotland and Ireland and intermarried with Gaelic-speaking people&quot;. Genetic evidence suggests that approximately 62% of the Icelandic maternal gene pool is derived from Ireland and Scotland, which is much higher than other Scandinavian countries, although comparable to the Faroese, while 37% is of Nordic origin. About 20–25% of the Icelandic paternal gene pool is of Gaelic origin, with the rest being Nordic.

The Icelandic Age of Settlement () is considered to have lasted from 874 to 930, at which point most of the island had been claimed and the (Althing), the assembly of the Icelandic Commonwealth, was founded at Þingvellir.

=== Hardship and conflict ===
In 930, on the Þingvellir () plain near Reykjavík, the chieftains and their families met and established the Alþingi, Iceland&#x27;s first national assembly. However, the Alþingi lacked the power to enforce the laws it made. In 1262, struggles between rival chieftains left Iceland so divided that King Haakon IV of Norway was asked to step in as a final arbitrator for all disputes, as part of the Old Covenant. This is known as the Age of the Sturlungs.

Iceland was under Norwegian leadership until 1380, when the Royal House of Norway died out. At this point, both Iceland and Norway came under the control of the Danish Crown. With the introduction of absolute monarchy in Denmark, the Icelanders relinquished their autonomy to the crown, including the right to initiate and consent to legislation. This meant a loss of independence for Iceland, which led to nearly 300 years of decline: perhaps largely because Denmark and its Crown did not consider Iceland to be a colony to be supported and assisted. In particular, the lack of help in defense led to constant raids by marauding pirates along the Icelandic coasts.

Unlike Norway, Denmark did not need Iceland&#x27;s fish and homespun wool. This created a dramatic deficit in Iceland&#x27;s trade, and no new ships were built as a result. In 1602, Iceland was forbidden to trade with other countries by order of the Danish Government, and in the 18th century climatic conditions had reached an all-time low since Settlement.
In 1783–84, Laki, a volcanic fissure in the south of the island, erupted. The eruption produced about of basalt lava, and the total volume of tephra emitted was 0.91 km3. The aerosols that built up caused a cooling effect in the Northern Hemisphere. The consequences for Iceland were catastrophic, with approximately 25–33% of the population dying in the famine of 1783 and 1784. Around 80% of sheep, 50% of cattle, and 50% of horses died of fluorosis from the 8 million tons of fluorine that were released. This disaster is known as the Mist Hardship (Icelandic: &quot;Móðuharðindin&quot;).

In 1798–99, the Alþingi was discontinued for several decades, eventually being restored in 1844. It was moved to Reykjavík, the capital, after being held at Þingvellir for over nine centuries.

=== Independence and prosperity ===

The 19th century brought significant improvement in the Icelanders&#x27; situation. A protest movement was led by Jón Sigurðsson, a statesman, historian, and authority on Icelandic literature. Inspired by the romantic and nationalist currents from mainland Europe, Jón protested strongly, through political journals and self-publications, for &#x27;a return to national consciousness&#x27; and for political and social changes to be made to help speed up Iceland&#x27;s development.

In 1854, the Danish government relaxed the trade ban that had been imposed in 1602, and Iceland gradually began to rejoin Western Europe economically and socially. With this return of contact with other peoples came a reawakening of Iceland&#x27;s arts, especially its literature. Twenty years later in 1874, Iceland was granted a constitution. Icelanders today recognize Jón&#x27;s efforts as largely responsible for their economic and social resurgence.

Iceland gained full sovereignty and independence from Denmark in 1918 after World War I. It became the Kingdom of Iceland. The King of Denmark also served as the King of Iceland but Iceland retained only formal ties with the Danish Crown. On 17 June 1944 the monarchy was abolished and a republic was established on Jón Sigurðsson&#x27;s 133rd birthday. This ended nearly six centuries of ties with Denmark.

== Demographics and society ==
=== Genetics ===

Due to their small founding population and history of relative isolation, Icelanders have often been considered highly genetically homogeneous as compared to other European populations. For this reason, along with the extensive genealogical records for much of the population that reach back to the settlement of Iceland, Icelanders have been the focus of considerable genomics research by both biotechnology companies and academic and medical researchers. It was, for example, possible for researchers to reconstruct much of the maternal genome of Iceland&#x27;s first known black inhabitant, Hans Jonatan, from the DNA of his present-day descendants partly because the distinctively African parts of his genome were unique in Iceland until very recent times.

Genetic evidence shows that most DNA lineages found among Icelanders today can be traced to the settlement of Iceland, indicating that there has been relatively little immigration since. This evidence shows that the founder population of Iceland came from Scandinavia, Ireland and Scotland: studies of Y-chromosomes and mitochondrial DNA indicate that 75% of Icelanders&#x27; patrilineal ancestry derives from Scandinavia (with most of the rest being from the Irish and British Isles), while 62% of their matrilineal ancestry derives from Scotland and Ireland (with most of the rest being from Scandinavia).

Other studies have identified other ancestries, however. One study of mitochondrial DNA, blood groups, and isozymes revealed a more variable population than expected, comparable to the diversity of some other Europeans. Another study showed that a tiny proportion of samples of contemporary Icelanders carry a more distant lineage, which belongs to the haplogroup C1e, which can possibly be traced to the settlement of the Americas around 14,000 years ago. This hints a small proportion of Icelanders have some Native American ancestry arising from Norse colonization of Greenland and North America.

Icelanders also have an anomalously high Denisovan genetic heritage.

Despite Iceland&#x27;s historical isolation, the genetic makeup of Icelanders today is still quite different from the founding population, due to founder effects and genetic drift. One study found that the mean Norse ancestry among Iceland&#x27;s settlers was 56%, whereas in the current population the figure was 70%. This indicates that Icelanders with increased levels of Norse ancestry had higher reproductive success.

=== Emigration ===

==== Greenland ====
The first Europeans to emigrate to and settle in Greenland were Icelanders who did so under the leadership of Erik the Red in the late 10th century and numbered around 500 people. Isolated fjords in this harsh land offered sufficient grazing to support cattle and sheep, though the climate was too cold for cereal crops. Royal trade ships from Norway occasionally went to Greenland to trade for walrus tusks and falcons. The population eventually reached a high point of perhaps 3,000 in two communities and developed independent institutions before fading away during the 15th century. A papal legation was sent there as late as 1492, the year Columbus attempted to find a shorter spice route to Asia but instead encountered the Americas.

==== North America ====

According to the &quot;Saga of Eric the Red&quot;, Icelandic immigration to North America dates back to Vinland . The colony was believed to be short-lived and abandoned by the 1020s. European settlement of the region was not archeologically and historically confirmed as more than legend until the 1960s. The former Norse site, now known as L&#x27;Anse aux Meadows, pre-dated the arrival of Columbus in the Americas by almost 500 years.

A more recent instance of Icelandic emigration to North America occurred in 1855, when a small group settled in Spanish Fork, Utah. Another Icelandic colony formed in Washington Island, Wisconsin. Immigration to the United States and Canada began in earnest in the 1870s, with most migrants initially settling in the Great Lakes area. These settlers were fleeing famine and overcrowding on Iceland. Today, there are sizable communities of Icelandic descent in both the United States and Canada. Gimli, in Manitoba, Canada, is home to the largest population of Icelanders outside of the main island of Iceland.

=== Immigration ===

From the mid-1990s, Iceland experienced rising immigration. By 2017 the population of first-generation immigrants (defined as people born abroad with both parents foreign-born and all grandparents foreign-born) stood at 35,997 (10.6% of residents), and the population of second-generation immigrants at 4,473. Correspondingly, the numbers of foreign-born people acquiring Icelandic citizenship are markedly higher than in the 1990s, standing at 703 in 2016. Correspondingly, Icelandic identity is gradually shifting towards a more multicultural form.

== Culture ==
=== Language and literature ===

Icelandic, a North Germanic language, is the official language of Iceland (&quot;de facto&quot;; the laws are silent about the issue). Icelandic has inflectional grammar comparable to Latin, Ancient Greek, more closely to Old English and practically identical to Old Norse.

Old Icelandic literature can be divided into several categories. Three are best known to foreigners: Eddic poetry, skaldic poetry, and saga literature, if saga literature is understood broadly. Eddic poetry is made up of heroic and mythological poems. Poetry that praises someone is considered skaldic poetry or court poetry. Finally, saga literature is prose, ranging from pure fiction to fairly factual history.

Written Icelandic has changed little since the 13th century. Because of this modern readers can understand the Icelanders&#x27; sagas. The sagas tell of events in Iceland in the 10th and early 11th centuries. They are considered to be the best-known pieces of Icelandic literature.

The elder or &quot;Poetic Edda&quot;, the younger or &quot;Prose Edda&quot;, and the sagas are the major pieces of Icelandic literature. The &quot;Poetic Edda&quot; is a collection of poems and stories from the late 10th century, whereas the younger or &quot;Prose Edda&quot; is a manual of poetry that contains many stories of Norse mythology.

=== Religion ===
Iceland embraced Christianity in c. 1000, in what is called the &quot;kristnitaka&quot;, and the country, while mostly secular in observance, is still predominantly Christian culturally. The Lutheran church claims some 84% of the total population. While early Icelandic Christianity was more lax in its observances than traditional Catholicism, Pietism, a religious movement imported from Denmark in the 18th century, had a marked effect on the island. By discouraging all but religious leisure activities, it fostered a certain dourness, which was for a long time considered an Icelandic stereotype. At the same time, it also led to a boom in printing, and Iceland today is one of the most literate societies in the world.

While Catholicism was supplanted by Protestantism during the Reformation, most other world religions are now represented on the island: there are small Protestant Free Churches and Catholic communities, and even a nascent Muslim community, composed of both immigrants and local converts. Perhaps unique to Iceland is the fast-growing &quot;Ásatrúarfélag&quot;, a legally recognized revival of the pre-Christian Nordic religion of the original settlers. According to the Roman Catholic Diocese of Reykjavík, there were only approximately 30 Jews in Iceland as of 2001. The former First Lady of Iceland Dorrit Moussaieff was an Israeli-born Bukharian Jew.

=== Cuisine ===

Icelandic cuisine consists mainly of fish, lamb, and dairy. Fish was once the main part of an Icelander&#x27;s diet but has recently given way to meats such as beef, pork, and poultry.

Iceland has many traditional foods called Þorramatur. These foods include smoked and salted lamb, singed sheep heads, dried fish, smoked and pickled salmon, and cured shark. Andrew Zimmern, a chef who has traveled the world on his show &quot;Bizarre Foods with Andrew Zimmern&quot;, responded to the question &quot;What&#x27;s the most disgusting thing you&#x27;ve ever eaten?&quot; with the response &quot;That would have to be the fermented shark fin I had in Iceland&quot;. Fermented shark fin is a form of Þorramatur.

=== Performance art ===

The earliest indigenous Icelandic music was the &quot;rímur&quot;, epic tales from the Viking era that were often performed a cappella. Christianity played a major role in the development of Icelandic music, with many hymns being written in the local idiom. Hallgrímur Pétursson, a poet and priest, is noted for writing many of these hymns in the 17th century. The island&#x27;s relative isolation ensured that the music maintained its regional flavor. It was only in the 19th century that the first pipe organs, prevalent in European religious music, first appeared on the island.

Many singers, groups, and forms of music have come from Iceland. Most Icelandic music contains vibrant folk and pop traditions. Some more recent groups and singers are Voces Thules, The Sugarcubes, Björk, Sigur Rós, and Of Monsters and Men.

The national anthem is &quot;Ó Guð vors lands&quot; (), written by Matthías Jochumsson, with music by Sveinbjörn Sveinbjörnsson. The song was written in 1874, when Iceland celebrated its one thousandth anniversary of settlement on the island. It was originally published with the title &quot;A Hymn in Commemoration of Iceland&#x27;s Thousand Years&quot;.

=== Sports ===

Iceland&#x27;s men&#x27;s national football team participated in their first FIFA World Cup in 2018, after reaching the quarter finals of its first major international tournament, UEFA Euro 2016. The women&#x27;s national football team has yet to reach a World Cup; its best result at a major international event was a quarterfinal finish in UEFA Women&#x27;s Euro 2013. The country&#x27;s first Olympic participation was in the 1912 Summer Olympics; however, they did not participate again until the 1936 Summer Olympics. Their first appearance at the Winter Games was at the 1948 Winter Olympics. In 1956, Vilhjálmur Einarsson won the Olympic silver medal for the triple jump. The Icelandic national handball team has enjoyed relative success. The team received a silver medal at the 2008 Olympic Games and a 3rd place at the 2010 European Men&#x27;s Handball Championship.

<text>Structural violence is a form of violence wherein some social structure or social institution may harm people by preventing them from meeting their basic needs or rights.

The term was coined by Norwegian sociologist Johan Galtung, who introduced it in his 1969 article &quot;Violence, Peace, and Peace Research&quot;. Some examples of structural violence as proposed by Galtung include institutionalized racism, sexism, and classism, among others. Structural violence and direct violence are said to be highly interdependent, including family violence, gender violence, hate crimes, racial violence, police violence, state violence, terrorism, and war. It is very closely linked to social injustice insofar as it affects people differently in various social structures.

== Definitions ==

=== Galtung ===
According to Johan Galtung, rather than conveying a physical image, &quot;structural violence&quot; is an &quot;avoidable impairment of fundamental human needs.&quot;

Galtung contrasts structural violence with &quot;classical violence:&quot; violence that is &quot;direct,&quot; characterized by rudimentary, impermanent &quot;bodily destruction&quot; committed by some actor. Galtung places this as the first category of violence. In this sense, the purest form of structural violence can be understood as violence that endures with no particular beginning, and that lacks an &#x27;actor&#x27; to have committed it.

Following this, by excluding the requirement of an identifiable actor from the classical definition of &quot;violence&quot;, Galtung lists poverty (i.e., the &quot;deprival of basic human needs&quot;) as the second category of violence and &quot;structurally conditioned poverty&quot; as the first category of structural violence.

Asking why violence necessarily needs to be done to the human body for it to be considered &quot;violence&quot;—&quot;why not also include violence done to the human mind, psyche or how one wants to express it&quot;—Galtung proceeds to repression (i.e., the &quot;deprival of human rights&quot;) as the third category of violence, and &quot;structurally conditioned repression&quot; (or, &quot;repressive intolerance&quot;) as the second type of structural violence.

Lastly, Galtung notes that repression need not be violence associated with repressive regimes or declared on particular documents to be human-rights infractions, as &quot;there are other types of damage done to the human mind not included in that particular tradition.&quot; From this sense, he categorizes alienation (i.e., &quot;deprival of higher needs&quot;) as the fourth type of violence, leading to the third kind of structural violence, &quot;structurally conditioned alienation&quot;—or, &quot;repressive tolerance,&quot; in that it is repressive but also compatible with repression, a lower level of structural violence.

Since structural violence is avoidable, he argues, structural violence is a high cause of premature death and unnecessary disability.

Some examples of structural violence as proposed by Galtung include institutionalized adultism, ageism, classism, elitism, ethnocentrism, nationalism, racism, sexism, and speciesism. Structural violence and direct violence are said to be highly interdependent, including family violence, gender violence, hate crimes, racial violence, police violence, state violence, terrorism, and war.

=== Others ===
In his book &quot;Violence: Reflections on a National Epidemic&quot;, James Gilligan defines &quot;structural violence&quot; as &quot;the increased rates of death and disability suffered by those who occupy the bottom rungs of society, as contrasted with the relatively lower death rates experienced by those who are above them.&quot; Gilligan largely describes these &quot;excess deaths&quot; as &quot;non-natural&quot; and attributes them to the stress, shame, discrimination, and denigration that results from lower status. He draws on Richard Sennett and Jonathan Cobb (i.e., &quot;The Hidden Injuries of Class&quot;, 1973), who examine the &quot;contest for dignity&quot; in a context of dramatic inequality.

In her interdisciplinary textbook on violence, Bandy X. Lee wrote &quot;Structural violence refers to the avoidable limitations that society places on groups of people that constrain them from meeting their basic needs and achieving the quality of life that would otherwise be possible. These limitations, which can be political, economic, religious, cultural, or legal in nature, usually originate in institutions that exercise power over particular subjects.&quot; She goes on to say that &quot;[it] is therefore an illustration of a power system wherein social structures or institutions cause harm to people in a way that results in maldevelopment and other deprivations.&quot;

Rather than the term being called &quot;social injustice&quot; or &quot;oppression&quot;, there is an advocacy for it to be called &quot;violence&quot; because this phenomenon comes from, and can be corrected by, human decisions, rather than just natural causes.

==Forms==
===Cultural violence===

Cultural violence refers to aspects of a culture that can be used to justify or legitimize direct or structural violence, and may be exemplified by religion &amp; ideology, language &amp; art, and empirical science &amp; formal science.

Cultural violence makes both direct and structural violence look or feel &#x27;right&#x27;, or at least not wrong, according to Galtung. The study of cultural violence highlights the ways the act of direct violence and the fact of structural violence are legitimized and thus made acceptable in society. Galtung explains that one mechanism of cultural violence is to change the &quot;moral color&quot; of an act from &quot;red/wrong&quot; to &quot;green/right,&quot; or at least to &quot;yellow/acceptable.&quot;

===Institutional violence===
Institutional violence is a form of structural violence in which organizations employ attitudes, beliefs, practices, and policies to marginalize or exploit vulnerable groups. Rossiter and Rinaldi (2018) argue that particular organizational traits serve as the structural elements allowing for the reconstruction of one&#x27;s sense of inhumane behavior (e.g., moral justification), its deleterious effects (e.g., minimizing), the responsibility for its impact (e.g., denial), and the subject harmed (e.g., dehumanization), which influences moral abdication and thus create an ethos of violence. The authors mention that, as one example of such traits, the social or physical distance of organizations themselves from the wider society can be a key mechanism.

== Cause and effects ==
In &quot;The Sources of Social Power&quot; (1986), Michael Mann makes the argument that within state formation, &quot;increased organizational power is a trade-off, whereby the individual obtains more security and food in exchange for his or her freedom.&quot;

Siniša Malešević elaborates on Mann&#x27;s argument: &quot;Mann&#x27;s point needs extending to cover all social organizations, not just the state. The early chiefdoms were not states, obviously; still, they were established on a similar basis—an inversely proportional relationship between security and resources, on the one hand, and liberty, on the other.&quot; This means that, although those who live in organized, centralized social systems are not likely subject to hunger or to die in an animal attack, they are likely to engage in organized violence, which could include war. These structures make for opportunities and advances that humans could not create for themselves, including the development of agriculture, technology, philosophy, science, and art; however, these structures take tolls elsewhere, making them both productive and detrimental. In early human history, hunter-gatherer groups used organizational power to acquire more resources and produce more food; yet, at the same time, this power was also used to dominate, kill, and enslave other groups in order to expand territory and supplies.

Although structural violence is said to be invisible, it has a number of influences that shape it. These include identifiable institutions, relationships, social phenomenon, and ideologies, including discriminatory laws, gender inequality, and racism. Moreover, this does not solely exist for those of lower classes, though the effects are much heavier on them, including higher rates of disease and death, unemployment, homelessness, lack of education, powerlessness, and shared fate of miseries. The whole social order is affected by social power; other, higher-class groups, however have much more indirect effects on them, with the acts generally being less violent.

Due to social and economic structures in place today—specifically divisions into rich and poor, powerful and weak, and superior and inferior—the excess premature death rate is between 10 and 20 million per year, which is over ten times the death rates from suicide, homicide, and warfare combined.

The work of Yale-based German philosopher, Thomas Pogge, is one major resource on the connection between structural violence and poverty, especially his book &quot;World Poverty and Human Rights&quot; (2002).

===Access to health care===
Structural violence affects the availability of health care insofar as paying attention to broad social forces (racism, gender inequality, classism, etc.) can determine who falls ill and who will be given access to care. It is therefore considered more likely for structural violence to occur in areas where biosocial methods are neglected in a country&#x27;s health care system. Since situations of structural violence are viewed primarily as biological consequences, it neglects problems stimulated by people&#x27;s environment, such as negative social behaviours or the prominence of inequality, therefore ineffectively addressing the issue.

Medical anthropologist Paul Farmer argues that the major flaw in the dominant model of medical care in the US is that medical services are sold as a commodity, remaining only available to those who can afford them. As medical professionals are not trained to understand the social forces behind disease, nor are they trained to deal with or alter them, they consequently have to ignore the social determinants that alter access to care. As a result, medical interventions are significantly less effective in low-income areas. Similarly, many areas and even countries cannot afford to stop the harmful cycle of structural violence.

The lack of training has, for example, had a significant impact on diagnosis and treatment of AIDS in the United States. A 1994 study by Moore et al. found that black Americans had a significantly lesser chance of receiving treatment than white Americans. Findings from another study suggest that the increased rate of workplace injury among undocumented Latino immigrants in the United States can also be understood as an example of structural violence.

If biosocial understandings are forsaken when considering communicable diseases such as HIV, for example, prevention methods and treatment practices become inadequate and unsustainable for populations. Farmer therefore also states that structural forces account for most if not all epidemic diseases.

Structural violence also exists in the area of mental health, where systems ignore the lived experiences of patients when making decisions about services and funding without consulting with the ill, including those who are illiterate, cannot access computers, do not speak the dominant language, are homeless, are too unwell to fill out long formal surveys, or are in locked psychiatric and forensic wards. Structural violence is also apparent when consumers in developed countries die from preventable diseases 15–25 years earlier than those without a lived experience of mental health.

==== Solutions ====
Farmer ultimately claims that &quot;structural interventions&quot; are one possible solution to such violence. However, for structural interventions to be successful, medical professionals need to be capable of executing such tasks; as stated above, though, many of professionals are not trained to do so. Medical professionals still continue to operate with a focus on individual lifestyle factors rather than general socio-economic, cultural, and environmental conditions. This paradigm is considered by Farmer to obscure the structural impediments to changes because it tends to avoid the root causes that should be focused on instead.

Moreover, medical professionals can rightly note that structural interventions are not their job, and as result, continue to operate under conventional clinical intervention. Therefore, the onus falls more on political and other experts to implement such structural changes. One response is to incorporate medical professionals and to acknowledge that such active structural interventions are necessary to address real public health issues.

Countries such as Haiti and Rwanda, however, have implemented (with positive outcomes) structural interventions, including prohibiting the commodification of the citizen needs (such as health care); ensuring equitable access to effective therapies; and developing social safety nets. Such initiatives increase the social and economic rights of citizens, thus decreasing structural violence.

The successful examples of structural interventions in these countries have shown to be fundamental.

Although the interventions have enormous influence on economical and political aspects of international bodies, more interventions are needed to improve access.

Although health disparities resulting from social inequalities are possible to reduce, as long as health care is exchanged as a commodity, those without the power to purchase it will have less access to it. Biosocial research should therefore be the main focus, while sociology can better explain the origin and spread of infectious diseases, such as HIV or AIDS. For instance, research shows that the risk of HIV is highly affected by one&#x27;s behavior and habits. As such, despite some structural interventions being able to decrease premature morbidity and mortality, the social and historical determinants of the structural violence cannot be omitted.

==International scope==

Petra Kelly wrote in her first book, &quot;Fighting for Hope&quot; (1984):

The violence in structural violence is attributed to the specific organizations of society that injure or harm individuals or masses of individuals. In explaining his point of view on how structural violence affects the health of subaltern or marginalized people, medical anthropologist Paul Farmer writes:

This perspective has been continually discussed by Farmer, as well as by Philippe Bourgois and Nancy Scheper-Hughes. Farmer ultimately claims that &quot;structural interventions&quot; are one possible solution to such violence; structural violence is the result of policy and social structures, and change can only be a product of altering the processes that encourage structural violence in the first place.

Theorists argue that structural violence is embedded in the current world system; this form of violence, which is centered on apparently inequitable social arrangements, is not inevitable. Ending the global problem of structural violence will require actions that may seem unfeasible in the short term. To some, this indicates that it may be easier to devote resources to minimizing the harmful impacts of structural violence. Others, such as futurist Wendell Bell, see a need for long-term vision to guide projects for social justice. Many structural violences, such as racism and sexism, have become such a common occurrence in society that they appear almost invisible. Despite this fact, sexism and racism have been the focus of intense cultural and political resistance for many decades. Significant reform has been accomplished, though the project remains incomplete.

Farmer notes that there are three reasons why structural violence is hard to see:

# Suffering is exoticized—that is, when something/someone is distant or far away, individuals tend to not be affected by it. When suffering lacks proximity, it&#x27;s easy to exoticise.
# The weight of suffering is also impossible to comprehend. There is simply no way that many individuals are able to comprehend what suffering is like.
# Lastly, the dynamics and distribution of suffering are still poorly understood.

Anthropologist Seth Holmes studied suffering through the lens of structural violence in his 2013 ethnography &quot;Fresh Fruit Broken Bodies: Migrant Farmworkers in the United States&quot;. He analyzed the naturalization of physical and mental suffering, violence continuum, and structural vulnerability experienced by Mexican migrants in the U.S. in their everyday lives. Holmes used examples like governmental influences of structural violence—such as how American subsidization of corn industries force Mexican farmers out of business, thereby forcing them to make the very dangerous trip across the border, where the U.S. Border Patrol hinder these migrants&#x27; chances of finding work in America, and the impact this all has on the migrants’ bodies.

==Criticism==

The concept of structural violence has come under criticism for being &quot;increasingly outdated and poorly theorized&quot;.

<text>Security police usually describes a law enforcement agency which focuses primarily on providing security and law enforcement services to particular areas or specific properties. They may be employed by governmental, public, or private institutions. Security police are generally considered distinct from security guards as security police personnel typically hold some level of law enforcement authority. The exact powers held by security police vary widely between jurisdictions. Examples of these types of agencies include the United States&#x27; DoD Police and FBI Police, the Indian Central Industrial Security Force, and the British Civil Nuclear Constabulary.

In some countries, &quot;security police&quot; is the name given to the secret security and intelligence services charged with protecting the state at the highest level, including responsibilities such as personal protection of the head of state, counter-espionage, and anti-terrorism. Examples of these agencies include the Japanese Security Police and the Georgian Security Police Department.

==Types of security police agencies==
Types of security police may include:

* &quot;Airport police&quot;, who provide law enforcement and security services to airports
* &quot;Campus police&quot; and &quot;school police&quot;, who provide law enforcement and security services to specific public and private schools, colleges, universities, and other educational institutions
* &quot;Housing authority police&quot;, who primarily protect publicly-owned housing or housing projects
* &quot;Hospital police&quot;, who provide law enforcement and security services to specific medical institutions and their facilities and properties
* &quot;Park police&quot; and &quot;park rangers&quot;, who primarily protect parks facilities and their grounds
* &quot;Capitol police&quot;, who protect state properties such as legislative, executive buildings, state/national capitol buildings, and their grounds, and can also include executive protection functions
* &quot;Company police&quot; and &quot;private police&quot;, who provide law enforcement and security services on company or private property (working either directly for the company/private entity or for a third-party entity which provides law enforcement services by contract), where local law permits private organizations to establish their own law enforcement agencies

Generally, any law enforcement agency dedicated to the security of a particular property or properties may be considered a security police agency.

== Security police powers and authority ==
Security police differ from security guards in that personnel of security police agencies are considered law enforcement officers, while security guards generally are not. Even where security guards hold some form of policing powers beyond that of the average individual they are not generally considered &quot;security police.&quot; The powers and authority of security police vary by jurisdiction, but at a minimum they generally hold detainment and arrest powers.

Some security police agencies enjoy enhanced authority in certain circumstances. For example, the Belfast Harbour Police of Northern Ireland may, in addition to having authority to enforce the law of Northern Ireland and of the United Kingdom, enforce the Belfast Harbour Commissioners’ by-laws.

Security police are generally trained to a similar — if not identical — standard as other law enforcement officers of their nation, though standards do vary widely between jurisdictions.

== Security police around the world ==
=== Australia ===
The RAAF Security Police is responsible for base security and policing the RAAF and they work closely with the Airfield Defence Guards. The Military Working Dog Unit also provides a further security function.

Most state police force in Australia employs a team of officers known as &quot;Protective Services Officers&quot; (PSOs). Stationed in and around public or government buildings, these PSOs are armed (to varying degrees) and wear slightly different uniforms. They are also called upon by regular police officers if the need arises. They generally undergo training at the state police college and share many resources. Some police officers have used the PSO path as a stepping stone to their current roles.

In New South Wales, an armed internal unit of the New South Wales Police Force is staffed by special constables who hold identical powers and immunities of police officers at the rank of constable. Special constables wear similar uniforms to police officers, carry arms and appointments and are issued warrant cards and badges. Special constables provide security services to select government and police complexes.

=== Germany ===
The Polizei beim Deutschen Bundestag (Polizei DBT, commonly known as &quot;Bundestagspolizei&quot;) is the smallest and least known police agency in Germany. It is responsible for the protection of the premises of the Bundestag in Berlin. Because the chief of the &quot;Bundestagspolizei&quot; is the president of the Bundestag (Federal Parliament of Germany) and not the minister of the interior, it can not be called a federal police agency. The number of their officers is not published yet. The &quot;Bundestagspolizei&quot; recruit their staff from all German police agencies.

=== Hong Kong ===
A special division of the Hong Kong Police Force, known as the Airport Security Unit (ASU), has been engaged by airports in Hong Kong (HK), to provide security services. These personnel have higher fitness standards and are issued with heavier firepower, than ordinary HK police officers.

=== India ===
The Central Industrial Security Force (CISF) is the primary federal security police agency of India. It has a strength of more than 365,000 personnel and is responsible for protecting over 300 government industries, 66 of the 137 civilian airports of India and all the 13 major seaports of India. It also protects the Delhi Metro, the Visva-Bharti University, certain Indian Space Research Organization (ISRO) buildings and 11 private establishments. In addition to this, it also provides consultancy services for more than 150 government and private establishments.

The Railway Protection Force (RPF) is responsible for protecting the Indian Railways and ensuring safety of citizens in trains. It has a strength of around 75,000 officers. 

The Defence Security Corps (DSC) protects military installations and property belonging to the Ministry of Defence (MoD).

In addition, many states may have their own police units or government agencies responsible for providing security for industries not protected by the CISF. These include various State Industrial Security Forces (SISF).

===Japan===
In Japan, security police, also known as &quot;SP&quot; are law enforcement officers that provide security for domestic and foreign dignitaries. Their role in dignitary protection is similar to that of the United States Secret Service.

===Malaysia===

The Royal Malaysia Police are generally responsible for protecting and policing the airports, seaports and government sites in Malaysia. Unlike several other countries, there is no state police for individual states.

===Portugal===
The Navy Establishments Police () is a small security police force responsible for protecting several of the facilities of the Portuguese Navy, including the navy central administration buildings, the Lisbon Naval Base and the Navy Museum. 

The Navy Establishments Police is a non-military service, in contrast with the Naval Police (&quot;Polícia Naval&quot;) which is the Portuguese Navy&#x27;s military police.

===South Africa===
During the 1960s the South African Security Police were known for detaining and interrogating members of the public, often leading to the victims death or disappearance, especially in the height of the Apartheid era.

===Sri Lanka===
During the 1990s the Sri Lanka Police created a sub unit with its members known as &quot;police security assistants&quot;. They were mostly limited to protection of police and governmental facilities.

===Sweden===

An &quot;ordningsvakt&quot; (”order-guard”) is a person deputized by the Swedish Police Authority to act as a law enforcement officer with limited police powers. Their main mission is to assist in maintaining public order. 

An &quot;ordningsvakt&quot; may carry a baton, firearm, and handcuffs, may use a police dog, and is authorized to use force if necessary to maintain order. An &quot;ordningsvakt&quot; may reject, remove and, if necessary, detain, a person who disturbs the public order in his area of responsibility. He may also detain persons suffering from alcohol intoxication, seize alcoholic beverages, make a citizen&#x27;s arrest (as everyone else), seize evidence after a citizen&#x27;s arrest, and search a detained person. Detained persons and evidence are to be turned over to the police, who has a general command authority over him. An &quot;ordningsvakt&quot; carries a special badge, and, since 2012, wears a standardized uniform (irrespective of employer). 

In February 2021, there were 7,830 persons deputized as &quot;ordningsvakter&quot; in Sweden. Of these, about 4,100 were employed by security companies while the rest had personal assignments from private or public clients. Previously, the assignments were mostly on a persona basis keeping public order at public events of a short duration such as soccer games and dances. 

Nowadays they also serve as employees of security firms on a permanent basis in the Stockholm metro, in courts and at public meetings in municipalities and regions. The number of sworn police officers in Sweden were at about the same time 20,942.

===Taiwan===
The special police (保安警察, &quot;Bao-an Jingcha&quot;) is known as the Security Police of Taiwan.

===United Kingdom===

====Northern Ireland====
The Northern Ireland Security Guard Service (not to be confused with MOD Police or MPGS) is a civilian armed guard service in which all civilian security officers are armed. They provide security at Ministry of Defence establishments in Northern Ireland.

The Belfast International Airport Constabulary is a small, armed, specialised police force responsible for policing Belfast International Airport, Northern Ireland.

===United States===
In the United States, the laws concerning peace officers vary widely from federal / state / city. Each state legislature with approval from the governor has the ability to modify the powers of peace officers in their state through legislation.

====Federal====
Most of the federal government&#x27;s uniformed police officers are security police who primarily serve to protect federal property and personnel. An example is the Federal Protective Service who protect federal buildings and the various agencies of the Department of Defense Police in protecting military installations and properties.

====By states====
Some major cities such as Washington, D.C., Los Angeles, San Francisco and Boston have a security police service separate from their city police. These may be employees of a public agency or private contractors.

=====California=====
The complexity of special policing and special police authority is illustrated by these examples, which are not meant to be exhaustive.

In California, peace officer powers are granted by the California Penal Code under a number of different code sections. Cities, counties and special districts are authorized to form their own law enforcement agencies. Peace officer training is regulated by a state agency, Peace Officer Standards and Training or &quot;POST&quot;. This training can consist of as little as a 40-hour PC 832 course (for park rangers, probation officers or fire investigators who might make an arrest in the course of their duties), or as much as a 700-hour POST Basic Academy (for entry level peace officers).

Security guards (including off duty peace officers) may only carry firearms in private employment if licensed by the state licensing authority, the Bureau of Security and Investigative Services. Persons regularly employed by public agencies as security guards, however, may be exempt from BSIS regulation, if they have completed POST-certified training in accordance with PC 832 or other penal code sections. However, security guards employed by a private employer are still regulated by BSIS even though the client may be a public agency.

======Orange County======
Orange County Sheriff&#x27;s Department special officers are duly appointed and dedicated California public officers under California Penal Code section 831.4. (a) (1), who provide citation enforcement and security services for the department in connection with the county bus system, airport, the operations of the local courts and the custody of local prisoners.

These sheriff&#x27;s special officers attend a 16-week training academy at the Orange County Sheriff&#x27;s Regional Training Academy that instructs new officers on laws of arrest, firearms training, arrest and control techniques, physical fitness, field and patrol tactics, first responder medical training, and corrections-custody training. Being duly non-sworn California public officers, Orange County Sheriff&#x27;s special officers maintain public officer authority while on duty

======Los Angeles======
In the Los Angeles metropolitan area, there are numerous examples of security police with different levels of authority and responsibility.

* Los Angeles County Sheriff&#x27;s Department - employs Security assistants (security officer I) and Security officers (security officer II) who assist deputy sheriffs in the protection of various county government facilities. The LASD absorbed the Los Angeles County Office of Public Safety on June 30, 2010.
** Security assistants are assigned to the Transit Services Bureau serve as fare inspectors. Security assistants and security officers assigned to the Court Services Division provide weapons screening and general security of the county&#x27;s superior and municipal courts. Security officers assigned to the Community College Division provide campus security to the county&#x27;s community colleges. Additionally, security officers may also be assigned to provide security at other county facilities.
** Sheriff&#x27;s security officers in compliance with applicable laws and regulations, such as peace officer (&quot;POST&quot;) training, have limited peace officer powers while on duty and are outside the authority of the state security guard licensing agency, the Bureau of Security and Investigative Services (BSIS) with respect to their work for the county.
* Los Angeles County Metropolitan Transportation Authority - transit security officers are uniformed, 836.5 (a) PC public officers, who serve the MTA (Metro) by providing security for critical transportation infrastructure and internal revenue protection. Transit security officers undergo a selection process that is similar to that for police (including an identical background investigation, as well as a psychological review and physical agility test), as well as an 800-hour internal training program and POST-certified arrest and firearms course.

=====New Orleans=====
The City of New Orleans Department of Police in accordance with New Orleans Home Rule Charter section 4-502 (2) (a) (b) and New Orleans Municipal Code 17-271 MCS 90–86, deputizes armed security officers, private investigators, college campus police, city, state, and federal agencies, within the city limits, with limited police powers as New Orleans Police special officers. 

New Orleans Municipal Code 17-271 MCS 30-1122 states that it shall be unlawful for any person to act as an armed guard unless they are a peace officer. Louisiana R.S. 40:1379.1 (b) states that the special officer, when performing those tasks requiring a special officer&#x27;s commission, shall have the same powers and duties as a peace officer. Special officers may make arrests for felony or misdemeanor offenses on the property or area they are to protect, patrol, or in relation to their direct assignment. The special officer, when making an arrest, may pat down the arrested subject for weapons. Special officers are to turn over arrested subjects and pertaining evidence to a New Orleans Police officer. Special officers are to honor all subpoenas on arrest made and appear in court to testify. Special officers, when not on a particular assignment, are regarded as private citizens and have no police powers. However, special officers still may make arrests for a felony, whether in or out of their presence, while not on a particular assignment, under Louisiana Law CCRP art.214 arrest by private person; when lawful.

===Venezuela===
The Internal Security Division is a security police unit of the Bolivarian Service of National Intelligence. Dressed with black berets and armed with M16s and M4s. This unit provides security at counterintelligence territorial bases and other facilities. They have police powers.

==Obsolete uses==

===Finland===
*The &quot;Suojelupoliisi&quot; or Finnish Security and Intelligence Service used the English title of “Finnish Security Police” until 2010. The name change was to emphasize its state security functions over any internal policing tasks it may have.

===Nazi Germany===
* The &quot;Sicherheitspolizei&quot;, often abbreviated as SiPo, was a term used in Nazi Germany to describe the state political and criminal investigation security agencies. It was made up by the combined forces of the &quot;Gestapo&quot; (secret state police) and the &quot;Kripo&quot; (criminal police) between 1936 and 1939. As a formal agency, the SiPo was folded into the RSHA in 1939, but the term continued to be used informally until the end of the Third Reich.
* The &quot;Reichssicherheitsdienst&quot; (RSD) was the security police assigned to protect dignitaries.

===United States===
* &quot;Security police&quot; is a term once used for the United States Air Force Security Forces, who function as the military police of the United States Air Force.

<text>In abstract algebra and multilinear algebra, a multilinear form on a vector space formula_1 over a field formula_2 is a map

:formula_3

that is separately formula_2-linear in each of its formula_5 arguments. More generally, one can define multilinear forms on a module over a commutative ring. The rest of this article, however, will only consider multilinear forms on finite-dimensional vector spaces.

A multilinear formula_5-form on formula_1 over formula_8 is called a (covariant) formula_9-tensor, and the vector space of such forms is usually denoted formula_10 or formula_11.

== Tensor product ==
Given a formula_5-tensor formula_13 and an formula_14-tensor formula_15, a product formula_16, known as the tensor product, can be defined by the property

: formula_17

for all formula_18. The tensor product of multilinear forms is not commutative; however it is bilinear and associative:

: formula_19, formula_20

and

: formula_21

If formula_22 forms a basis for an formula_23-dimensional vector space formula_1 and formula_25 is the corresponding dual basis for the dual space formula_26, then the products formula_27, with formula_28 form a basis for formula_10. Consequently, formula_10 has dimension formula_31.

==Examples==

===Bilinear forms===
If formula_32, formula_33 is referred to as a bilinear form. A familiar and important example of a (symmetric) bilinear form is the standard inner product (dot product) of vectors.

===Alternating multilinear forms===
An important class of multilinear forms are the alternating multilinear forms, which have the additional property that

: formula_34

where formula_35 is a permutation and formula_36 denotes its sign (+1 if even, –1 if odd). As a consequence, alternating multilinear forms are antisymmetric with respect to swapping of any two arguments (i.e., formula_37 and formula_38):

: formula_39

With the additional hypothesis that the characteristic of the field formula_2 is not 2, setting formula_41 implies as a corollary that formula_42; that is, the form has a value of 0 whenever two of its arguments are equal. Note, however, that some authors use this last condition as the defining property of alternating forms. This definition implies the property given at the beginning of the section, but as noted above, the converse implication holds only when formula_43.

An alternating multilinear formula_5-form on formula_1 over formula_8 is called a multicovector of degree formula_9 or formula_9-covector, and the vector space of such alternating forms, a subspace of formula_10, is generally denoted formula_50, or, using the notation for the isomorphic &quot;k&quot;th exterior power of formula_51(the dual space of formula_1), formula_53. Note that linear functionals (multilinear 1-forms over formula_8) are trivially alternating, so that formula_55, while, by convention, 0-forms are defined to be scalars: formula_56.

The determinant on formula_57 matrices, viewed as an formula_23 argument function of the column vectors, is an important example of an alternating multilinear form.

==== Exterior product ====
The tensor product of alternating multilinear forms is, in general, no longer alternating. However, by summing over all permutations of the tensor product, taking into account the parity of each term, the &quot;exterior product&quot; (formula_59, also known as the &quot;wedge product&quot;) of multicovectors can be defined, so that if formula_60 and formula_61, then formula_62:

: formula_63

where the sum is taken over the set of all permutations over formula_64 elements, formula_65. The exterior product is bilinear, associative, and graded-alternating: if formula_60 and formula_61 then formula_68. 

Given a basis formula_22 for formula_1 and dual basis formula_25 for formula_72, the exterior products formula_73, with formula_74 form a basis for formula_50. Hence, the dimension of formula_50 for &quot;n&quot;-dimensional formula_1 is formula_78.

===Differential forms===
Differential forms are mathematical objects constructed via tangent spaces and multilinear forms that behave, in many ways, like differentials in the classical sense. Though conceptually and computationally useful, differentials are founded on ill-defined notions of infinitesimal quantities developed early in the history of calculus. Differential forms provide a mathematically rigorous and precise framework to modernize this long-standing idea. Differential forms are especially useful in multivariable calculus (analysis) and differential geometry because they possess transformation properties that allow them be integrated on curves, surfaces, and their higher-dimensional analogues (differentiable manifolds). One far-reaching application is the modern statement of Stokes&#x27; theorem, a sweeping generalization of the fundamental theorem of calculus to higher dimensions. 

The synopsis below is primarily based on Spivak (1965) and Tu (2011).

==== Definition of differential k-forms and construction of 1-forms ====
To define differential forms on open subsets formula_79, we first need the notion of the tangent space of formula_80at formula_81, usually denoted formula_82 or formula_83. The vector space formula_83 can be defined most conveniently as the set of elements formula_85 (formula_86, with formula_87 fixed) with vector addition and scalar multiplication defined by formula_88 and formula_89, respectively. Moreover, if formula_90 is the standard basis for formula_80, then formula_92 is the analogous standard basis for formula_83. In other words, each tangent space formula_83 can simply be regarded as a copy of formula_80 (a set of tangent vectors) based at the point formula_81. The collection (disjoint union) of tangent spaces of formula_80 at all formula_87 is known as the tangent bundle of formula_80 and is usually denoted formula_100. While the definition given here provides a simple description of the tangent space of formula_80, there are other, more sophisticated constructions that are better suited for defining the tangent spaces of smooth manifolds in general (&quot;see the article on tangent spaces for details&quot;). 

A differential formula_9-form on formula_79 is defined as a function formula_104 that assigns to every formula_105 a formula_5-covector on the tangent space of formula_80at formula_81, usually denoted formula_109. In brief, a differential formula_5-form is a formula_5-covector field. The space of formula_5-forms on formula_113 is usually denoted formula_114; thus if formula_104 is a differential formula_5-form, we write formula_117. By convention, a continuous function on formula_113 is a differential 0-form: formula_119.

We first construct differential 1-forms from 0-forms and deduce some of their basic properties. To simplify the discussion below, we will only consider smooth differential forms constructed from smooth (formula_120) functions. Let formula_121 be a smooth function. We define the 1-form formula_122 on formula_113 for formula_105 and formula_125 by formula_126, where formula_127 is the total derivative of formula_128 at formula_81. (Recall that the total derivative is a linear transformation.) Of particular interest are the projection maps (also known as coordinate functions) formula_130, defined by formula_131, where formula_132 is the &quot;i&quot;th standard coordinate of formula_133. The 1-forms formula_134 are known as the basic 1-forms; they are conventionally denoted formula_135. If the standard coordinates of formula_125 are formula_137, then application of the definition of formula_122 yields formula_139, so that formula_140, where formula_141 is the Kronecker delta. Thus, as the dual of the standard basis for formula_83, formula_143 forms a basis for formula_144. As a consequence, if formula_104 is a 1-form on formula_113, then formula_104 can be written as formula_148 for smooth functions formula_149. Furthermore, we can derive an expression for formula_122 that coincides with the classical expression for a total differential:

: formula_151

[&quot;Comments on&quot; &quot;notation:&quot; In this article, we follow the convention from tensor calculus and differential geometry in which multivectors and multicovectors are written with lower and upper indices, respectively. Since differential forms are multicovector fields, upper indices are employed to index them. The opposite rule applies to the &quot;components&quot; of multivectors and multicovectors, which instead are written with upper and lower indices, respectively. For instance, we represent the standard coordinates of vector formula_86 as formula_153, so that formula_154 in terms of the standard basis formula_90. In addition, superscripts appearing in the &quot;denominator&quot; of an expression (as in formula_156) are treated as lower indices in this convention. When indices are applied and interpreted in this manner, the number of upper indices minus the number of lower indices in each term of an expression is conserved, both within the sum and across an equal sign, a feature that serves as a useful mnemonic device and helps pinpoint errors made during manual computation.]

==== Basic operations on differential k-forms ====
The &quot;exterior product&quot; (formula_59) and &quot;exterior derivative&quot; (formula_158) are two fundamental operations on differential forms. The exterior product of a formula_5-form and an formula_14-form is a formula_161-form, while the exterior derivative of a formula_5-form is a formula_163-form. Thus, both operations generate differential forms of higher degree from those of lower degree.

The exterior product formula_164 of differential forms is a special case of the exterior product of multicovectors in general (&quot;see above&quot;). As is true in general for the exterior product, the exterior product of differential forms is bilinear, associative, and is graded-alternating.

More concretely, if formula_165 and formula_166, then

: formula_167

Furthermore, for any set of indices formula_168,

: formula_169

If formula_170, formula_171, and formula_172, then the indices of formula_173 can be arranged in ascending order by a (finite) sequence of such swaps. Since formula_174, formula_175 implies that formula_176. Finally, as a consequence of bilinearity, if formula_104 and formula_178 are the sums of several terms, their exterior product obeys distributivity with respect to each of these terms. 

The collection of the exterior products of basic 1-forms formula_179 constitutes a basis for the space of differential &quot;k&quot;-forms. Thus, any formula_117 can be written in the form

: formula_181

where formula_182 are smooth functions. With each set of indices formula_183 placed in ascending order, (*) is said to be the standard presentation of formula_104. &lt;br&gt;

In the previous section, the 1-form formula_122 was defined by taking the exterior derivative of the 0-form (continuous function) formula_128. We now extend this by defining the exterior derivative operator formula_187 for formula_188. If the standard presentation of formula_5-form formula_104 is given by (*), the formula_163-form formula_192 is defined by

: formula_193

A property of formula_158 that holds for all smooth forms is that the second exterior derivative of any formula_104 vanishes identically: formula_196. This can be established directly from the definition of formula_158 and the equality of mixed second-order partial derivatives of formula_198 functions (&quot;see the article on closed and exact forms for details&quot;).

==== Integration of differential forms and Stokes&#x27; theorem for chains ====
To integrate a differential form over a parameterized domain, we first need to introduce the notion of the pullback of a differential form. Roughly speaking, when a differential form is integrated, applying the pullback transforms it in a way that correctly accounts for a change-of-coordinates. 

Given a differentiable function formula_199 and formula_5-form formula_201, we call formula_202 the pullback of formula_178 by formula_128 and define it as the formula_5-form such that

: formula_206

for formula_207, where formula_208 is the map formula_209.

If formula_210 is an formula_23-form on formula_80 (i.e., formula_213), we define its integral over the unit formula_23-cell as the iterated Riemann integral of formula_128:

: formula_216

Next, we consider a domain of integration parameterized by a differentiable function formula_217, known as an &quot;n&quot;-cube. To define the integral of formula_218 over formula_219, we &quot;pull back&quot; from formula_220 to the unit &quot;n&quot;-cell:

: formula_221

To integrate over more general domains, we define an formula_222-chain formula_223 as the formal sum of formula_23-cubes and set

: formula_225

An appropriate definition of the formula_226-chain formula_227, known as the boundary of formula_228, allows us to state the celebrated Stokes&#x27; theorem (Stokes–Cartan theorem) for chains in a subset of formula_229: &quot;If formula_104 is a&quot; &quot;smooth&quot; formula_226&quot;-form on an open set formula_232&quot; &quot;and formula_228&quot; &quot;is a smooth&quot; formula_23&quot;-chain in formula_220, thenformula_236.&quot;Using more sophisticated machinery (e.g., germs and derivations), the tangent space formula_237 of any smooth manifold formula_238 (not necessarily embedded in formula_229) can be defined. Analogously, a differential form formula_240 on a general smooth manifold is a map formula_241. Stokes&#x27; theorem can be further generalized to arbitrary smooth manifolds-with-boundary and even certain &quot;rough&quot; domains (&quot;see the article on Stokes&#x27; theorem for details&quot;).

<text>A Thin Line Between Love and Hate is a 1996 American comedy thriller film starring and directed by Martin Lawrence in his feature film directorial debut. It tells the story of Darnell Wright (Lawrence), a ladies&#x27; man who finds himself stalked by one of his obsessed lovers: Brandi (Lynn Whitfield), an attractive and successful, but unstable older realtor businesswoman.

==Plot==
Nightclub manager Darnell Wright is a perpetual playboy and hopeless male chauvinist. He works for a nightclub called &quot;Chocolate City&quot; and aspires to be its co-owner. He trades VIP privileges at the club for favors from women. Though he is an expert at conning women, he sometimes worries about what his childhood sweetheart Mia thinks of his adventures. He realizes he has feelings for her.

When the beautiful and wealthy Brandi Web steps out of a limousine to enter the club, Darnell feels that he&#x27;s met his ultimate challenge.

She initially rejects his come-ons, which only fuels his appetite. He pursues her, showing up with flowers at her office. He finally wins over Brandi, only to find out that he&#x27;s really in love with Mia. He breaks ties with all his other girlfriends.

One morning, Darnell awakes to find Brandi in his kitchen making bacon and pancakes. She wants him to hold her, but he pushes her off aggressively. However, Brandi doesn&#x27;t take kindly to rejection. She becomes an obsessed femme fatale: stalking him, nearly running him over, taking all four wheels off his SUV to ground him from his rounds, shattering his windshield, and setting his nightclub on fire. She hits herself with a fruit-stuffed stocking to cause herself bruises without fingerprints, and repeatedly slams a door on her arm injuring herself.

When Darnell goes to see Mia at the hospital, Brandi is there instead and he is arrested for a false domestic violence charge. She continues harassing and stalking Darnell, then threatens Mia&#x27;s life.

Ending his relationship with Mia is not enough to satisfy Brandi who finally administers Darnell&#x27;s punishment for his womanizing. Darnell quickly learns the hard way that if you &quot;play&quot;, you have to &quot;pay.&quot;

Darnell, now suffering from a gun wound attempts to take the gun from Brandi when she attempts to shoot Mia. The struggle causes Brandi, Mia, and him to fall out of a window and land in a pool.

Darnell awakes from the fall in a hospital, with all his friends, family, and Mia standing over him. He decides to change his life for the better and start a life with Mia. Darnell is grateful that Brandi showed him what love really is. Brandi is arrested and imprisoned.

<doc id="832232" wikidata="Q184591" url="?curid=832232" title="10 (1979 film)">
<text>10 is a 1979 American romantic comedy film written, produced and directed by Blake Edwards and starring Dudley Moore, Julie Andrews, Robert Webber, and Bo Derek. It was considered a trendsetting film at the time of its release and became one of the year&#x27;s biggest box-office hits. The film follows a middle-aged man who becomes infatuated with a young woman whom he has never met, leading to a comic chase and an encounter in Mexico.

== Plot ==
During a surprise 42nd birthday party for the wealthy and famous composer George Webber thrown by his actress girlfriend Samantha Taylor, George finds that he is coping badly with his age. From his car, George glimpses a bride on her way to be married and is instantly obsessed with her beauty. Following her to the church, he crashes into a police cruiser, is stung by a bee and nearly disrupts the wedding ceremony.

Later that night, Sam and George argue over his treatment of women and his habit of spying on the intimate acts of a neighbor with his consent.

George visits the minister who performed the wedding and learns that the woman is Jenny Miles, daughter of a prominent Beverly Hills dentist. The following day, while spying on his neighbor, George hits himself with the telescope and falls down an embankment, causing him to miss Sam&#x27;s phone call. Still obsessed with Jenny, he schedules a dental appointment with her father and learns that Jenny and her husband David have gone to Mexico for their honeymoon. The effects of a comically implausible amount of treatment accompanied by a heavy dose of novocaine, aggravated by immediate heavy drinking, leave George completely incoherent. Sam finally reaches him on the phone, but mistakes him for an intruder and calls the police, who hold George at gunpoint while trying to understand his gibberish. George visits his neighbor&#x27;s house to take part in an ongoing orgy, but Sam spots him through his telescope, widening the rift between them.

George impulsively boards a plane to follow the newlyweds to their exclusive resort in Mexico. In the bar, George encounters old acquaintance Mary Lewis, who lacks self-confidence. When they attempt a fling, Mary interprets George&#x27;s inadequacy in bed as confirmation of her own insecurities.

At the beach, George sees Jenny in a swimsuit and is awestruck again by her beauty. Noticing that her husband has fallen asleep on a surfboard, George rents a catamaran and rescues David, making him a hero. Sam sees George on a TV newscast and tries to contact him unsuccessfully. David is hospitalized with sunburn, allowing Jenny and George to spend time alone together. Jenny smokes marijuana and seduces George, but he is horrified when Jenny takes a call from David and casually informs him of George&#x27;s presence. George is even more confused with David&#x27;s complete lack of concern. Jenny explains she is in an open marriage and married David only because of pressure from her conservative father. George leaves after realizing that Jenny sees their tryst as nothing more than a casual fling.

After flying home, George reconciles with Sam by performing an apologetic new song and demonstrating greater maturity. He suggests getting married, but they agree they should first work on arguing less and making love more. George takes an idea from Jenny when he starts &quot;Boléro&quot; on his phonograph and he makes love with Sam in full view of the neighbor&#x27;s telescope, though the neighbor has already stopped watching out of frustration that he provides erotic entertainment for George and gets nothing in return.

== Production ==
&quot;10&quot; originally had a budget of $5-6 million and was due to start filming on October 2, 1978 but George Segal didn&#x27;t show up and the production was cancelled. Dudley Moore was a last-minute replacement and the script was rewritten. Edwards sued Segal and won $270,000. Due to the stopping and restarting of production, the budget was expected to be higher than originally planned. Filming took place in Los Angeles and Mexico.

Peter Sellers originally had a cameo as a night club drummer but the scene was cut.

== Release ==
&quot;10&quot; was released by Warner Bros. on October 5, 1979, opening in 706 theaters. It was released on DVD through Warner Home Video on May 21, 1997, and a Blu-ray edition was released on February 1, 2011. The supplemental material consists of the original theatrical trailer and a four-minute promotional documentary, present on both media.

== Reception ==
&quot;10&quot; opened at number one in the United States, grossing $3,526,692 ($ in ) for its opening weekend. The film went on to make a total of $74,865,517 ($ in ) in the U.S. and Canada by the end of 1980, making it one of the top-grossing films released in 1979. Worldwide, it grossed over $107 million. It received mostly positive reviews from critics. On Rotten Tomatoes, it has an approval rating of 65% based on 26 reviews, with an average rating of 6.40/10. The site&#x27;s consensus states: &quot;Blake Edwards&#x27; bawdy comedy may not score a perfect 10, but Dudley Moore&#x27;s self-deprecating performance makes this midlife crisis persistently funny.&quot; On Metacritic, the film has a score of 68% based on reviews from seven critics, indicating &quot;generally favorable reviews&quot;.

Vincent Canby of &quot;The New York Times&quot; described &quot;10&quot; as &quot;frequently hilarious&quot;, praising the performances by Moore and Andrews and concluding that the film &quot;is loaded with odd surprises&quot;. Roger Ebert gave the film four stars in his review for the &quot;Chicago Sun-Times&quot;, calling it &quot;one of the best films Blake Edwards has ever made&quot;; he also ranked it 10th on his annual top-ten list. Gene Siskel of the &quot;Chicago Tribune&quot; called the film &quot;a very funny comedy that couldn&#x27;t be more serious about the plight of its lead character&quot;. He also noted that the film &quot;turns out to be a gentle essay on the problems of male menopause&quot;.

&quot;The New York Times&quot; included the film on its &quot;Best 1,000 Movies Ever&quot; list from 2003.

=== Accolades ===
== Cultural impact ==
Bo Derek&#x27;s role shot her to instant stardom and status as a sex symbol. Her beaded and plaited cornrow hairstyle in the film was widely copied.

The film also brought renewed fame to the one-movement orchestral piece &quot;Boléro&quot; by Maurice Ravel, whose music was still under copyright at the time. As a result of the film, sales of &quot;Boléro&quot; generated an estimated $1 million in royalties and briefly made Ravel the best-selling classical composer 40 years after his death. Derek appeared in a 1984 film named &quot;Bolero&quot;, titled to capitalize upon the piece&#x27;s renewed popularity.

==Remake==
In 2003, it was announced that Blake Edwards would direct a remake to be titled &quot;10 Again&quot; for MDP Worldwide, but the project was abandoned.

<doc id="832240" wikidata="Q1938502" url="?curid=832240" title="Fungus-growing ants">
<text>Fungus-growing ants (tribe Attini) comprise all the known fungus-growing ant species participating in ant–fungus mutualism. They are known for cutting grasses and leaves, carrying them to their colonies&#x27; nests, and using them to grow fungus on which they later feed.

Their farming habits typically have large effects on their surrounding ecosystem. Many species farm large areas surrounding their colonies and leave walking trails that compress the soil, which can no longer grow plants. Attine colonies commonly have millions of individuals, though some species only house a few hundred.

They are the sister group to the subtribe Dacetina. Leafcutter ants, including &quot;Atta&quot; and &quot;Acromyrmex&quot;, make up two of the genera. Their cultivars mostly come from the fungal tribe Leucocoprineae of family Agaricaceae.

Attine gut microbiota is often not diverse due to their primarily monotonous diets, leaving them at a higher risk than other beings for certain illnesses. They are especially at risk of death if their colony&#x27;s fungus garden is affected by disease, as it is most often the only food source used for developing larvae. Many species of ants, including several &quot;Megalomyrmex&quot;, invade fungus-growing ant colonies and either steal from and destroy these fungus gardens, or they live in the nest and take food from the species.

Fungus-growing ants are only found in the Western Hemisphere. Some species stretch as far north as the pine barrens in New Jersey, USA (&quot;Trachymyrmex septentrionalis&quot;) and as far south as the cold deserts in Argentina (several species of &quot;Acromyrmex&quot;). This New World ant clade is thought to have originated about 60 million years ago in the South American rainforest. This is disputed, though, as they could have possibly evolved in a drier habitat while still evolving to domesticate their crops.

== Evolution ==

Early ancestors of attine ants were probably insect predators. They likely began foraging for leaf sections, but then converted their primary food source to the fungus these leaf cuts grew. Higher attines, such as &quot;Acromyrmex&quot; and &quot;Atta&quot;, are believed to have evolved in Central and North America about 20 million years ago (Mya), starting with &quot;Trachymyrmex cornetzi.&quot; While the fungal cultivars of the &#x27;lower&#x27; attine ants can survive outside an ant colony, those of &#x27;higher&#x27; attine ants are obligate mutualists, meaning they cannot exist without one another.

Generalized fungus farming in ants appears to have evolved about 55–60 Mya, but early 25 Mya ants seemed to have domesticated a single fungal lineage with gongylidia to feed colonies. This evolution of using gongylidia appears to have developed in the dry habitats of South America, away from the rainforests where fungus-farming evolved. About 10 million years later, leaf-cutting ants likely arose as active herbivores and began industrial-scaled farming. The fungus the ants grew, their cultivars eventually became reproductively isolated and co-evolved with the ants. These fungi gradually began decomposing more nutritious material like fresh plants.

Shortly after attine ants began keeping their fungus gardens in dense aggregations, their farms likely began suffering from a specialized genus of &quot;Escovopsis&quot; mycopathogens. The ants evolved cuticular cultures of Actinomycetota that suppress &quot;Escovopsis&quot; and possibly other bacteria. These cuticular cultures are both antibiotics and antifungals. The mature worker ants wear these cultures on their chest plates and sometimes on their surrounding thoraces and legs as a biofilm.

== Behavior ==

=== Mating ===

Typically, one queen lives per colony. Every year after the colony is about three years old, the queen lays eggs of female and male alates, the reproductive ants that will pass on the genes of the queens. Before leaving the nest, queens stuff some of the fungus&#x27; mycelia in her cibarium. These winged males and queens then take their nuptial flights to mate high in the air. In some areas, species flights are synchronized with all local colonies&#x27; virgin royalty flying at the same time on the same day, such as &quot;Atta sexdens&quot; and &quot;Atta texana&quot;.

Some species&#x27; queens mate with only one male, as in &quot;Seriomyrmex&quot; and &quot;Trachymyrmex&quot;, while some are known to mate with as many as eight or 10, such as &quot;Atta sexdens&quot; and many&quot; Acromyrmex&quot; spp. After mating, all males die, but their sperm stays alive and usable for a long time in the spermatheca, or sperm bank, of their mate, meaning that many ants father offspring years after their death.

=== Colony foundation ===
After their mating flights, queens cast off their wings and begin their descent into the ground. After creating a narrow entrance and digging straight down, she creates a small chamber. In here, she spits on a small wad of fungus and starts her colony&#x27;s garden. After about three days, fresh mycelia are growing out of the fungus wad and the queen has lain three to six eggs. In a month, the colony has eggs, larvae, and often pupae surrounding the ever-growing garden.

Until the first workers are grown, the queen is the sole worker. She grows the garden, fertilizing it with her fecal liquid, but does not eat from it. Instead, she gains energy from eating 90% of the eggs she lays, in addition to catabolizing her wing muscles and fat reserves.

Though the first larvae feed on the eggs of the queen, the first workers begin growing and eating from the garden. Workers feed malformed eggs to the hungry larvae while the garden is still fragile. After about a week of this underground growth, workers open the closed entrance and begin foraging, staying close to the nest. The fungus begins growing at a much faster rate [] an hour. From this point on, the only work the queen does is egg-laying.

Colonies grow slowly for the first two years of existence, but then accelerate for the next three years. After around five years, growth levels out and the colony begins to produce winged males and queens.

The founding of a nest by these queens is highly difficult, and successful cases are not likely. After three months, newly founded colonies of &quot;Atta capiguara&quot; and &quot;Atta sexdens&quot; are 0.09% and 2.53% likely to still exist, respectively. Some species have better odds, such as &quot;Atta cephalotes&quot;, which are 10% likely to survive a few months.

== Caste system ==

Attines have seven castes performing roughly 20–30 tasks, meaning the potential exists for development of more specialized castes performing individual tasks for &quot;Atta&quot;&#x27;s future. For now, a reproductive caste, made of male drones and female queens, and a worker class, that vary greatly in size, are known. Queens have much larger ovaries than females in the working castes. Since their needs are constantly taken care of, queens rarely move from a single location, which is typically in a centralized fungal garden. Workers take their eggs and move them to other fungal gardens. Differences in size between worker castes begin to develop after a colony is well established.
=== Workers ===

==== Description ====
Lower attines have very minor polymorphism within the minor workers, though higher attines commonly have very different sizes of worker ants. In the higher attines, though, head width varies eight-fold and dry weight 200-fold between different castes of workers. The size differences in workers is nearly nonexistent in newly founded colonies.

Due to the variety of tasks needed to be performed by a colony, the widths of workers heads are important and good measures of what jobs workers are likely to perform. Those with the heads about wide tend to work as gardeners, although many with heads wide participate in brood care.

Workers need heads only about 0.8 mm wide to do the work of caring for the very delicate hyphae of the fungus, which they care for by stroking with their antennae and moving with their mouths. These tiny workers are the smallest and most abundant and are called minim. Ants of appear to be the smallest workers that cut vegetation, but they cannot cut very hard or thick leaves. Most foragers have heads around wide.

Attines, particularly the workers that cut leaves and grass, have large mandibles powered by strong muscles. On average, 50% of worker ants&#x27; head mass and 25% of their full body mass is the mandibular muscles alone.

==== Behavior ====
Though all castes defend their nests in the event of invasion, a true soldier caste, with individuals called majors, exists. They are larger than other workers, and use their large, sharp mandibles, powered by huge adductor muscles, to defend their colonies from large enemies, such as vertebrates. When a foraging area is threatened by conspecific or interspecific ant competitor, the majority of respondents are smaller workers from other castes, since they are more numerous, and therefore better suited for territorial combat.

Tasks are divided not only by size, but by the age of individuals workers, as well. Young workers of most subcastes tend to work inside the nest, but many older workers take on tasks outside. Minims, which are too small to cut or carry leaf fragments, are commonly found at foraging sites. They often ride from the foraging site to the nest by climbing onto the fragments carried by other workers. Most likely, they are older workers that defend carriers from parasitic phorid flies that attempt to lay eggs on the backs of the foragers.

All size groups defend their colonies from invaders, but older workers have been found to attack and defend territories most often. At least three of four physical castes of &quot;A. sexdens&quot; change their behavior based on their age.

== Habitat ==
Lower attines mostly live in inconspicuous nests with 100–1000 individuals and relatively small fungus gardens in them. Higher attines, in contrast, live in colonies made of 5–10 million ants that live and work within hundreds of interconnected fungus-bearing chambers in huge subterranean nests. Some colonies are so large, they can be seen from satellite photos, measuring up to .

== Farming ==

The majority of fungi that are farmed by attine ants come from the family Agaricaceae, mostly from the genera &quot;Leucoagaricus&quot; and &quot;Leucocoprinus&quot;, though variance occurs within the tribe. Some species in the genus &quot;Apterostigma&quot; have changed their food source to fungi in the family Tricholomataceae. Some species cultivate yeast, such as &quot;Cyphomyrmex rimosus.&quot;

Some fungi that have supposedly been vertically transmitted are believed to be millions of years old. It was previously assumed that the cultures are always transmitted vertically from colony to young queen, but some lower attines have been found to be growing recently domesticated Lepiotaceae. Some species transfer cultures laterally, such as &quot;Cyphomyrmex&quot; and occasionally some species of &quot;Acromyrmex&quot;, whether by joining a neighboring tribe, stealing, or invading another colony&#x27;s garden.
Lower attines do not use leaves for the majority of the substrate for their gardens, and instead prefer dead vegetation, seeds, fruits, insect feces, and corpses. The lower attine ant species &quot;Mycocepurus goeldii&quot; has been found to farm &quot;Leucocoprinus attinorum&quot; whilst the sand dwelling &quot;Mycetophylax morschi&quot; farms the closely related species &quot;Leucocoprinus dunensis.&quot; &quot;Apterostigma&quot; &quot;dentigerum&quot; cultivates &quot;Myrmecopterula velohortorum&quot; in veiled hanging gardens whereas &quot;Apterostigma manni&quot; cultivates &quot;Myrmecopterula nudihortorum&quot; in spongelike masses in cavities in the ground or under logs.

=== Worker recruitment ===
The number of ants that are recruited to cut varies greatly based on the leaf quality available in addition to the species and location of the colony. Leaf quality is complex to measure because many variables exist, including &quot;leaf tenderness, nutrient composition, and the presence and quantity of secondary plant chemicals&quot; such as sugar.

Early studies found the pheromones used to mark foraging trails come from poison gland sacs. Studies suggest there are two purposes for marking the trails this way: worker recruitment and orientation cues. The trail recruitment pheromone methyl-4-methylpyrrole-2-carboxylate (MMPC), was the first whose chemical structure was identified. It is also the main trail recruitment pheromone in all &quot;Atta&quot; species except &quot;Atta sexdens&quot;, which uses 3-ethyl-2,5-dimethylpyrazine.

MMPC is incredibly potent and effective at attracting ants. One milligram is theoretically powerful enough to create a path that &quot;A. texana&quot; and &quot;A. cephalotes&quot; would follow three times the Earth&#x27;s circumference [] and that 50% of &quot;A. vollenweideri&quot; foragers would follow 60 times around the Earth [].

=== Harvesting vegetation ===
Most harvesting sites are in tree canopies or patches of savanna grasses.

After following the pheromone trail to vegetation, ants climb onto leaves or grass and begin cutting off sections. To do this, they place one mandible, called the fixed mandible, onto a leaf and anchor it. Then they open the other, called the motile mandible, and place it on the leaf tissue. The ant moves the motile jaw and pulls the fixed jaw behind it by closing them together until the fragment detaches. Which jaw is fixed and which is motile varies depending on the direction in which the ant chooses to cut a fragment.

The sizes of leaf fragments have been found in some studies to vary based on the size of ants due to the ants&#x27; anchoring of their hind legs while cutting, though other studies have not found correlations. This is likely because many factors affect how ants cut leaves, including neck flexibility, body axis location, and leg length. Load sizes that do not impact the running speed of the collecting ants are favored.

Often, ants stridulate while cutting vegetation by raising and lowering their gasters in a way that makes a cuticular file on the first gastric tergite and a scraper on the postpetiole rub together. This makes a noise, audible by people with great hearing sitting very close to them and visible using laser-Doppler vibrometry. It also causes the mandibles to move like a vibratome and cut through tender leaf tissue more smoothly.

The metabolic rate of the ants while and after cutting vegetation is above standard. Their aerobic scope is in the range of flying insects, which are among the most metabolically active animals.

The behavior of the foragers that bring the material back to the nest varies greatly among species. In some species, especially those that harvest close to their nests, the harvesters bring the litter back to their colony themselves. Species such as &quot;A. colombica&quot; have one or more cache sites along a trail for foragers to grab litter. Other species, such as &quot;A. vollenweideri&quot;, that carry leaves as far as , have two to five carriers per leaf. The first carrier takes the segment a short distance toward the nest and then drops it. Another picks it up and drops it, and this repeats until the last carrier brings it the greatest distance until reaching the nest. Data does not show that this behavior maximizes load transportation, so scientists have explained this behavior in other ways, though the data are still inconclusive. One theory is that this type of task partitioning increases the efficiency of individual workers as they become specialists. Another is that the chains accelerate communication between ants about the quality and species of the plants being cut, recruits more workers, and reinforces territorial claims by reinforcing the scent markings.

=== Gardening process ===
First, foragers bring in to and drop leaf fragments on the nest&#x27;s chamber floor. Workers that are usually slightly smaller clip these pieces into segments that are about across. Smaller ants then crush these fragments and mold them into damp pellets by adding fecal droplets and kneading them. They add the pellets into a larger pile of other prill.

Smaller workers then pluck loose strands of fungus from dense patches and plant them on the surface of the freshly made pile. The smallest workers, the minim, move around and keep up the garden by delicately prodding the piles with their antennae, licking the surfaces, and plucking out the spores and hyphae of unwanted mold species.

=== Nutrition ===
Higher attine fungi grow gongylidia, which form clusters called staphylae. The staphylae are rich in carbohydrates and lipids. Though workers can also eat the hyphae of the fungi, which is richer in protein, they prefer staphylae and appear to live longer while eating them.

Cellulose has been found to be poorly degraded and assimilated by fungus, if at all, meaning that the ants that eat the fungus do not get much energy from the cellulose in plants. Xylan, starch, maltose, sucrose, laminarin, and glycoside apparently play the important roles in ant nutrition. It is not known yet how ants can digest laminarin, but myrmecologists E.O. Wilson and Bert Hölldobler hypothesize that fungal enzymes may occur in the ants&#x27; guts, as evidenced by the enzymes found in larval extract.

In a laboratory experiment, only 5% of workers&#x27; energy needs were met by fungal staphylae, and the ants also feed on tree sap as they collect greens. Larvae seem to grow on all or nearly all fungi, whereas queens obtain their energy from the eggs nonqueen females lay and workers feed to them.

=== Bacterial symbionts ===
The actinomycete bacterium &quot;Pseudonocardia&quot; is acquired by pupae from the workers that care for them two days after pupae eclose for metamorphosis. Within 14 days, the ants are covered in the bacteria, where they are stored in crypts and cavities found in the exoskeletons. The bacteria produce small molecules that can prevent the growth of a specialized fungus garden pathogen.

Attine ants have very specialized diets, which seem to reduce their microbiotic diversity.

=== Impact of farming ===
The scale of the farming done by fungus-farming ants can be compared to human&#x27;s industrialized farming. A colony can &quot;[defoliate] a mature eucalyptus tree overnight&quot;. The cutting of leaves to grow fungus to feed millions of ants per colony has a large ecological impact in the subtropical areas in which they reside.

<text>The Veterans Health Administration (VHA) is the component of the United States Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) led by the Under Secretary of Veterans Affairs for Health that implements the healthcare program of the VA through a nationalized healthcare service in the United States, providing healthcare and healthcare-adjacent services to veterans through the administration and operation of 146 VA Medical Centers (VAMC) with integrated outpatient clinics, 772 Community Based Outpatient Clinics (CBOC), and 134 VA Community Living Centers (VA Nursing Home) Programs. It is the largest division in the department, and second largest in the entire federal government, employing over 350,000 employees. All VA hospitals, clinics and medical centers are owned by and operated by the Department of Veterans Affairs (as opposed to private companies), and all of the staff employed in VA hospitals are federal employees. Because of this, veterans that qualify for VHA healthcare do not pay premiums or deductibles for their healthcare but may have to make copayments depending on the medical procedure. VHA is not a part of the US Department of Defense Military Health System.

Many evaluations have found that by most measures VHA care is equal to, and sometimes better than, care provided in the private sector, when judged by standard evidence-based guidelines. A 2009 Congressional Budget Office report on the VHA found that &quot;the care provided to VHA patients compares favorably with that provided to non-VHA patients in terms of compliance with widely recognized clinical guidelines — particularly those that VHA has emphasized in its internal performance measurement system. Such research is complicated by the fact that most users of VHA&#x27;s services receive at least part of their care from outside providers.&quot;

==History==
The first Federal agency to provide medical care to veterans was the Naval Home in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. The home was created in 1812 and was followed by the creation of Soldiers Home in 1853 and St. Elizabeth&#x27;s Hospital in 1855. Congress created the National Home for Disabled Volunteer Soldiers in 1865 in response to the high number of Civil War casualties. These homes were initially intended to be room and board for disabled veterans. However, by the late 1920s, the homes were providing a level of care comparable to hospital care.

President Hoover created the Veterans Administration (VA) in 1930 to consolidate all veteran services. General Omar N. Bradley was appointed to VA administrator and Bradley appointed Major General Paul Hawley as director of VA medicine, both in 1945. Hawley successfully established a policy that affiliated new VA hospitals with medical schools. Hawley also promoted resident and teaching fellowships at VA hospitals. Ultimately, Hawley was responsible for starting the hospital-based research program at the VA. Bradley resigned in 1947. However, upon resignation, 97 hospitals were in operation and 29 new hospital had been built. As a result, the VA health system was able to serve a much larger population of veterans than it had served in previous years.

In 1988, President Reagan signed the Department of Veterans Affairs Act, which elevated the VA to Cabinet-level, then becoming known as the Department of Veterans Affairs. The Department of Veterans Affairs oversees the Veterans Health Administration.

In the mid-1980s the VHA was criticized for their high operative mortality. To that end, Congress passed Public Law 99–166 in December 1985 which mandated the VHA to report their outcomes in comparison to national averages and the information must be risk-adjusted to account for the severity of illness of the VHA surgical patient population. In 1991 the National VA Surgical Risk Study (NVASRS) began in 44 Veterans Administration Medical Centers. By December 31, 1993, there was information for 500,000 non-cardiac surgical procedures. In 1994 NVASRS was expanded to all 128 VHA hospitals that performed surgery. The name was then changed to the National Surgical Quality Improvement Program.

Beginning in the mid-1990s VHA underwent what the agency characterizes as a major transformation aimed at improving the quality and efficiency of care it provides to its patients. That transformation included eliminating underutilized inpatient beds and facilities, expanding outpatient clinics, and restructuring eligibility rules. A major focus of the transformation was the tracking of a number of performance indicators—including quality-of-care measures—and holding senior managers accountable for improvements in those measures.

=== 1993-2000: Dr. Kenneth W. Kizer and VHA Reform ===
The Clinton Healthcare Plan was a health care reform proposed by the Clinton Administration. Even though the reform was not successful, a task force was created in response to the Clinton Healthcare Reform proposal to determine if the VA was ready for managed care. The negative results of market research forced the VA system to re-evaluate its current operations. Research revealed that three out of four veterans would leave the VA network if a national healthcare system were adopted. They also found that there was a high demand for primary care throughout the VA system. Research showed that many VA facilities believed that 55 percent of patients would choose to receive primary care at the VA facility if a primary care system was fully implemented in 1993. The study also showed that the VA facilities believed that 83 percent of veterans would choose to receive primary care at the VA if fully implemented by 1998. These results made it clear to the administration that it was time for a reform. As a result, the VA issued a directive in 1994, that required all VA healthcare facilities to have primary care teams by year 1996. As a result, percentage of patients receiving primary care at the VA increased from 38 percent to 45 percent to 95 percent, during 1993, 1996, and 1999. This mandate served as the foundation for the VA reorganization under Dr. Kenneth W. Kizer.

Dr. Kizer, a physician trained in emergency medicine and Public Health, was appointed by President Bill Clinton as Director of U.S. Veterans Health Administration in 1994. He was hired to update and modernize the VA health system in order to eliminate negative perception and to align the system with current market trends. Core issues included advancements in technology and biomedical knowledge, aging and socioeconomically disadvantaged Medicare patients, coordinating care, and rising healthcare costs. There was much opposition to a major reform. Many legislators preferred an incremental change over a wide-scale reform. However, Kizer was known as being very innovative. To publicize his vision he expressed his mission and vision of the &quot;new VHA&quot; and outlined seven key principles to guide change. His ultimate goal was to provide coordinated, high quality care at a low cost.

He launched his reorganization plan in 1995 by decentralizing the VA system. He organized all VA operating units into 22 geographic based networks known as Veterans Integrated Service Networks (VISNs). This allowed networks to manage themselves and adapt to the demographics of their location. Patients were then assigned to a group of doctors who would provide coordinated care. One director was hired for each VISN network. Instead of hiring all directors internally, a third of the newly hired VISN directors were hired outside of the VA system. The directors were responsible for meeting performance goals and improving upon measurable key efficiency and quality indicators. Directors monitored performances and reports were generated to show each network&#x27;s performance. Some of these indicators included chronic disease quality, prevention performance, patient satisfaction ratings, and utilization management.

The reform also changed the procedure for allocating funds to the various VISNs. Historically, funds were distributed between hospitals based on historical costs. However, it was found that this method affected efficiency and quality of services. Therefore, funding for each VISN was distributed based on the number of veterans seen in each network, rather than on historical values.

The New England Journal of Medicine conducted a study from 1994–2000 to evaluate the efficacy of the healthcare reform. They gathered the results of the evaluated key indicators from each of the networks and interpreted the results. There were noticeable improvements, compared with the same key indicators used for the Medicare fee for service system, as soon as two years after the reorganization. These improvements continued through year 2000. These results indicate that the changes made throughout the VA healthcare system, under the leadership of Kizer, did improve the efficiency and quality of care in VA healthcare system.

===Veterans Health Administration scandal of 2014===
In 2014, Congress passed the Veterans Access, Choice, and Accountability Act, commonly known as simply the Choice Act. VA Secretary Robert Wilkie assured veterans that the VA wouldn&#x27;t be privatized and that veterans would still be able to get the same quality of care they had been receiving. In May 2014, major problems with scheduling timely access to medical care became public. According to a retired doctor at the center interviewed by CNN, at least 40 veterans died waiting for care at the Phoenix, Arizona Veterans Health Administration facilities. An investigation of delays in treatment throughout the Veterans Health Administration system was conducted by the Veterans Affairs Inspector General, but it only found six deaths during the delay. On May 30, 2014, Secretary of Veterans Affairs Eric Shinseki resigned from office due to the fallout from the scandal. Despite the negative exposure and the subsequent vows by Washington lawmakers to take action, the major problems still exist.

On June 24, 2014, Senator Tom Coburn, Republican from Oklahoma, and a medical doctor, released a report called Friendly Fire: Death, Delay, and Dismay at the VA which detailed the actions and misconduct of employees of the Department of Veteran Affairs. The report is based on yearlong investigations conducted by Senator Coburn&#x27;s office on Veterans Health Administration facilities across the nation. The report details the many veterans who have died waiting for health care as a result of the VA misconduct. Secret waiting lists, poor patient care, the millions of dollars that are intended for health care that has gone unspent every year and reports of bonuses paid out to employees who have lied and covered up statistics are also detailed in the report.

However, a VA Inspector General&#x27;s report issued on August 26, 2014, reported that six, not forty, veterans had died experiencing “clinically significant delays” while on waiting lists to see a VA doctor, and in each of these six cases, “we are unable to conclusively assert that the absence of timely quality care caused the deaths of these veterans.”

=== 2014 - present: Improving care, MISSION Act/Community Care, expansion of Mental Health eligibility ===
With the Choice Act in place, wait times (and ultimately care) at VHA facilities began to improve. According to a study conducted by the Journal of the American Medical Association (JAMA) in 2014, the average wait times to receive health care were 22.5 for VHA and 18.7 days for the private sector. However, by 2017, VHA wait times were significantly shorter than wait times to see a private doctor dropping to 17.7 days for VHA, while the wait for a private doctor increased to 29.8 days. Based on the successes of the original program, Congress expanded the eligibility of the program by passing the John S. McCain III, Daniel K. Akaka, and Samuel R. Johnson VA Maintaining Internal Systems and Strengthening Integrated Outside Networks (MISSION) Act of 2018 (), which permanently codified the Choice Act features access (wait time and travel distance) standards into a new Veterans Community Care Program. It also established several additional criteria that qualify the Veteran to receive community care, such as if a Veteran needs a service not available at any VA facility (i.e., maternity care for women), a Veteran lives in a U.S. state (Alaska, Hawaii, New Hampshire) or territory (Guam, American Samoa, Northern Mariana Islands, U.S. Virgin Islands) without a full-service VA medical facility, or it is in the best medical interest of the Veteran, based on Veteran and provider agreement. Additional regulations issued by VA also changed the access standards that would make a Veteran eligible reducing the time from 30 days to 20 days of a request or at a facility within 30 minutes of average driving for a primary care appointment or 28 days and 60 minutes for a specialty appointment.

In 2018, as a result of the passage of the 2018 Consolidated Appropriations Act, VHA was allowed to combat veterans and victims of military sexual trauma who were discharged administratively with an other than honorable discharge (OTH) to access mental health treatment in VA or community care facilities. it also allowed all veterans with a discharge that would typically bar veterans&#x27; health care and benefits to petition the Secretary (through the Veterans Benefits Administration) to determine whether or not the character of their discharge is a complete bar to benefits. Even if VBA makes a determination that they are ineligible for monetary and educational benefits, they may still find that such a Veteran is eligible for health care benefits for any service-connected disability.

== Structure ==

The system is divided into 21 distinct service regions, called Veterans Integrated Services Network (VISN), that provide funding and care to the systems 1,293 medical centers and their associated clinics. Funding for each VISN is based on the anticipated number of Veterans enrolled in care within the covered region. When a VISN sees a large influx of number of Veterans, the funding levels for that region will increase proportionally, while other areas may see a decrease (especially if they are losing Veteran population). As of 2021, the Desert Pacific Network (VISN 22) was the largest region by population, with over 1.7 million total veterans (2018 estimate), while the Pacific Northwest Network (VISN 20) is the largest by geography -- , including the highly rural state of Alaska.

Doctors who work in the VHA system are typically paid less in core compensation than their counterparts in private practice. However, VHA compensation includes benefits not generally available to doctors in private practice, such as lesser threat of malpractice lawsuits, freedom from billing and insurance company payment administration, and the availability of the government&#x27;s open-source electronic records system VistA. Currently the VHA is experiencing a physician shortage and as of 2018 10% of jobs in the VHA remain unfilled. This shortage can be especially harmful to Veterans since a quarter of Veterans live in rural areas. These are the kind of areas that are most vulnerable to a shortage since they are already isolated and it can be hard to get access to the healthcare they need. However, since 2018, these shortages have been decreasing steadily, with the greatest need being mental health providers and nursing corps.

== Funding ==
The funding the VA receives is split into mandatory, which is an amount of spending dictated by law, and discretionary spending, which is spending that can be adjusted year to year. VHA&#x27;s budget is part of the discretionary spending and is by far the largest portion of the department, reaching nearly 90% of the department&#x27;s annual amount allocated annually by Congress in FY2022. For FY2022, the department&#x27;s budget requested a total of $269.9 billion USD, of which $97.5 billion USD was allocated for various VHA programs, including $58.8 billion to support direct care in VA facilities, and $23.4 billion in support of community care claims. This was an increase of 10% over the FY 2021 appropriations, which were under $250 billion USD.

==Initiatives==
The VHA has expanded its outreach efforts to include men and women veterans and homeless veterans.

The VHA, through its academic affiliations, has helped train thousands of physicians, dentists, and other health professionals. Several newer VA medical centers have been purposely located adjacent to medical schools.

The VHA support for research and residency/fellowship training programs has made the VA system a leader in the fields of geriatrics, spinal cord injuries, Parkinson&#x27;s disease VA.gov | Veterans Affairs, and palliative care.

The VHA has initiatives in place to provide a &quot;seamless transition&quot; to newly discharged veterans transitioning from Department of Defense health care to VA care for conditions incurred in the Iraq War or war in Afghanistan.

The Veterans Health Administration Office of Research and Development&#x27;s research into developing better-functioning prosthetic limbs, and treatment of PTSD are also heralded. The VHA has devoted many years of research into the health effects of the herbicide Agent Orange used by military forces in the Vietnam War.

The VHA has also adopted Boston University&#x27;s Project RED program, designed to improve the discharge process for veterans in hopes that, by educating patients, the VHA will experience a reduced number of readmission among veterans and provide more information on telerehabilitation.

=== Use of electronic records ===
VHA is especially praised for its efforts in developing a low cost open source electronic medical records system VistA which can be accessed remotely (with secure passwords) by health care providers. With this system, patients and nurses are given bar-coded wristbands, and all medications are bar-coded as well. Nurses are given wands, which they use to scan themselves, the patient, and the medication bottle before dispensing drugs. This helps prevent four of the most common dispensing errors: wrong med, wrong dose, wrong time, and wrong patient. The system, which has been adopted by all veterans&#x27; hospitals and clinics and continuously improved by users, has cut the number of dispensing errors in half at some facilities and saved thousands of lives.

At some VHA medical facilities, doctors use wireless laptops, putting in information and getting electronic signatures for procedures. Doctors can call up patient records, order prescriptions, view X-rays or graph a chart of risk factors and medications to decide treatments. Patients have a home page that have boxes for allergies and medications, records every visit, call and note, and issues prompts reminding doctors to make routine checks. This technology has helped the VHA achieve cost controls and care quality that the majority of private providers cannot achieve.

== Services ==

=== Eligibility ===

To be eligible for VA health care benefit programs one must have served in the active military, naval or air service and separated under any condition other than dishonorable. Current and former members of the Reserves or National Guard who were called to active duty (other than for training only) by a federal order and completed the full period for which they were called or ordered to active duty also may be eligible for VA health care.

The minimum duty requirements are that veterans who enlisted after September 7, 1980, or who entered active duty after October 16, 1981, must have served 24 continuous months or the full period for which they were called to active duty in order to be eligible. The minimum duty requirement may not apply to veterans who were discharged for a disability incurred in the line of duty, for a hardship or &quot;early out.&quot; The VA determines the minimum requirements when the veteran enrolls for VA health care benefits.

To apply for entry into the VA health care system the veteran must complete VA Form 10-10EZ, Application for health care benefits.

Eligible veterans will receive a VA Veterans Health Identification Card (VHIC) formerly Veteran identification card (VIC) for use at all VA medical facilities.

By federal law, eligibility for benefits is determined by a system of eight priority groups. Retirees from military service, veterans with service-connected injuries or conditions rated by VA, and Purple Heart recipients are within the higher priority groups.

Current and former members of the Reserves and the National Guard who were called to active duty (other than for monthly drills and annual training) by a federal executive order may be eligible for VA health care benefits.

Veterans without rated service-connected conditions may become eligible based on financial need, adjusted for local cost of living. Veterans who do not have service-connected disabilities totaling 50% or more may be subject to copayments for any care they received for nonservice-connected conditions.

=== Medical Care ===

==== Primary &amp; Specialty Care ====
Primary care is provided through what is referred to as Patient Aligned Care Teams (PACT). PAC Teams provide accessible, patient-centered care and are managed by primary care providers with the active involvement of other clinical and non-clinical staff. Veteran patients will be at the center of a &quot;teamlet,&quot; which will include a primary care provider, RN care manager, LPN/health tech, and a medical support assistant (MSA). This teamlet is supported by a broader &quot;team,&quot; which includes social workers, dieticians, pharmacists, and mental health specialists.

General care includes health evaluation and counseling, disease prevention, nutrition counseling, weight control, smoking cessation, and substance abuse counseling and treatment as well as gender-specific primary care, e.g., cervical cancer screens (Pap smears), breast cancer screens (mammograms), birth control, preconception counseling, Human Papillomavirus (HPV) vaccine and menopausal support (hormone replacement therapy). This care is provided mainly by VA-owned hospitals but may also be done in VA-owned community-based outpatient clinics (CBOC). VA hospitals are also capable of providing emergency care, although a Veteran can go to any hospital in an emergency.

VHA also provides management and screening of a number of chronic conditions includes heart disease, diabetes, cancer, glandular disorders, osteoporosis and fibromyalgia as well as sexually transmitted diseases such as HIV/AIDS and hepatitis. Rehabilitation, home care, and long-term care referrals are given to those in need of rehabilitation therapies such as physical therapy, occupational therapy, speech-language therapy, exercise therapy, recreational therapy, and vocational therapy.

VA also provides some home health care through its Skilled Home Health Care Services (SHHC) and Homemakers and Home Health Aide Services (H/HHA) programs. SHHC services are in-home services provided by specially trained personnel, including nurses, physical therapists, occupational therapists and social workers. Care includes clinical assessment, treatment planning and treatment provision, health status monitoring, patient and family education, reassessment, referral and follow-up. H/HHA Services are personal care and related support services that enable frail or disabled Veterans to live at home.

If the need arises, veterans are eligible for transplant service. VA has sixteen transplant centers across the country that provides solid organ transplants for most major organs, such as the heart, lung and kidneys, Patients will be referred to these transplant centers by their Primary Care Team. Travel to these centers is either free of charge to the Veteran or is reimbursed to them upon completion.

==== Mental health ====
Mental health treatment includes evaluation and assistance for issues such as depression, mood, and anxiety disorders; intimate partner and domestic violence; elder abuse or neglect; parenting and anger management; marital, caregiver, or family-related stress; and post-deployment adjustment or post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD). Veterans who may also have experienced sexual harassment or sexual assault, known as military sexual trauma (MST) during their service are also eligible for service. VHA provides free, confidential counseling and treatment for MST-related mental and physical health conditions. The percentage of patients with a mental illness was 15 percent in 2007. The percentage of veterans with mental illnesses has trended up. The VHA allocated an extra $1.4 billion per year to mental health program between 2005 and 2008. Mental health services in 2006 were evaluated as a part of the Mental Health Strategic Plan. The report concluded:

In 2009, the VA implemented an initiative called Suicide Assessment and Follow-Up Engagement: Veteran Emergency Treatment (SAFE VET) to identify and treat veterans at risk of suicide by providing care coordination for outpatient mental health services and community-based support.

===== PTSD =====
Veteran Affairs utilization rates among Iraqi and Afghanistan-war veterans in the mid-Atlantic region with PTSD diagnosis between 2002 and 2008 were tracked using ICD-9 codes of those newly diagnosed. When compared to veterans already being treated, veterans new to VA treatment program were less likely to complete follow up visits, and had fewer medication-possession days (74.9 days versus 34.9 days); also long wait times hindered VA medical utilization. Limitations to this study included: type of treatment intervention was not delineated; only looked at PTSD treatment over a short period of time (180 days).

Another study found there was an increase in demand of the VA health system among veterans. Nearly 250,000 veterans were identified between 2001 and 2007; Iraq and Afghanistan war veterans had a 40 percent utilization rate, compared to only 10 percent of Vietnam veterans. Veterans were categorized into three groups: non-mental health diagnosis, non-PTSD mental diagnosis, and PTSD mental diagnosis. The most prevalent diagnosis was PTSD. The typical veteran affected by PTSD was male, from the Army or Marines, and a lower-ranked officer. Veterans with PTSD had a high utilization of the VA system at over 91 percent.

While this was a comprehensive study, there is more to be studied and understood about the effects of PTSD on returning veterans from active combat. A major limitation is that this study only captured the utilization of veterans within the VA health system. There was no data on veterans who sought medical services outside of the VA health system. We can have a better understanding of the mental health needs of veterans returning to civilian life. Moreover, it would be beneficial to explore and examine how utilization of mental health services is affected by the stigma that persists among veterans. Additional awareness of medical resources available to veterans can help to erase the stigma of seeking mental health treatment.

==== Women Veterans Programs ====
With the population of women veterans projected to rise from 1.6 million in 2000 to 1.9 million in 2020, the VA has worked to integrate quality women&#x27;s medical services into the VA system. However, studies show that 66.9 percent of women who do not use the VA for women&#x27;s services consider private practice physicians more convenient. Also, 48.5 percent of women do not use women&#x27;s services at the VA due to a lack of knowledge of VA eligibility and services.

Women&#x27;s care at VHA hospitals and clinics include reproductive health care such as limited maternity care, infertility evaluation and limited treatment, sexual problems, tubal ligation, urinary incontinence, and others. VHA is prohibited from providing either in-vitro fertilization or abortion services. Maternity and pregnancy care is usually provided in non-VA contracted hospitals at VA expense; care is usually limited to a mother. (VA may furnish health care services to a newborn child of a woman Veteran who is receiving maternity care furnished by VA for not more than seven days after the birth if the Veteran delivered the child in (1) a VA facility, or (2) another facility pursuant to a VA contract for services relating to such delivery).

==== Dental Care ====
For VA dental care a veteran must have a service-connected compensable dental disability or condition. Those who were prisoners of war (POWs) and those whose service-connected disabilities have been rated at 100 percent or who are receiving the 100 percent rate by reason of individual unemployability (IU) are eligible for any needed dental care, as are those veterans actively engaged in a 38 USC Chapter 31 vocational rehabilitation program and veterans enrolled who may be homeless and receiving care under VHA Directive 2007–039.

=== Non-Medical Programs ===

==== Family Caregivers Program ====
VA&#x27;s Family Caregivers Program provides support and assistance to caregivers of post 9/11 Veterans and Servicemembers being medically discharged. Eligible primary Family Caregivers can receive a stipend, training, mental health services, travel and lodging reimbursement, and access to health insurance if they are not already under a health plan care. Each state has their own criteria and board members for approval, denial, and appeal.

As part of this program, VHA also will provide respite supportive care to Veterans on a short-term basis to give the caregiver planned relief from the physical and emotional demands associated with providing care. Respite care can be provided in the home or other institutional settings.

==== Residential Care ====
The Domiciliary Care Program of the Department of Veterans Affairs provides residential rehabilitative and clinical care to veterans who have a wide range of problems, illnesses, or rehabilitative care needs which can be medical, psychiatric, substance use, homelessness, vocational, educational, or social. The Domiciliary Care Program provides a 24-hour therapeutic setting utilizing a peer and professional support environment. The programs provide a strong emphasis on psychosocial rehabilitation and recovery services that instill personal responsibility to achieve optimal levels of independence upon discharge to independent or supportive community living. The VA Domiciliary Care Program also provides rehabilitative care for homeless veterans. Eligibility is extended to veterans whose annual gross household income does not exceed the maximum annual rate of VA pension or to veterans who the Secretary of Veterans Affairs determines have no adequate means of support. The copays for extended care services apply to domiciliary care.

VA also provides nursing home services to Veterans through VA owned and operated Community Living Centers (CLC), State Veterans&#x27; Homes, owned and operated by the states, and the community nursing home program. Each program has admission and eligibility criteria specific to the program. Nursing home care is available for enrolled Veterans who need nursing home care for a service-connected disability, or Veterans or who have a 70 percent or greater service-connected disability and Veterans with a rating of total disability based on individual unemployability. VA provided nursing home care for all other Veterans is based on available resources.

The Vet Center Program was established by Congress in 1979 in response to the readjustment problems that a significant number of Vietnam-era veterans were continuing to experience after their return from combat. In subsequent years, Congress extended eligibility to all combat veterans who served on active duty from previous conflicts. All community based Vet Centers provide readjustment counseling, outreach services and referral services to help veterans make a satisfying post-war readjustment to civilian life. Services are also available for their family members for military related issues. Vet Centers are staffed with small multidisciplinary teams some of whom are combat veterans themselves.

==== VA travel reimbursement ====
Veterans may be eligible for mileage reimbursement or special mode transport in association with obtaining VA health care services if the veteran has a service-connected rating of 30 percent or more, or is traveling for treatment of a service-connected condition, receives a VA pension, the veteran&#x27;s income does not exceed the maximum annual VA pension rate, the veteran is traveling for a scheduled compensation or pension examination, is in certain emergency situations. has a medical condition that requires a special mode of transportation and travel is pre-authorized, as are certain non-veterans when related to care of a veteran (caregivers, attendants and donors).

=== Other Specialized Care ===

==== OEF/OIF/OND Care Management Team ====
The Operation Enduring Freedom/Operation Iraqi Freedom/Operation New Dawn (OEF/OIF/OND) Care Management Team helps returning service members achieve a smooth transition of health care services. A specialized OEF/OIF/OND care management team provides case management and care coordination for all severely ill, injured and impaired combat veterans, including those suffering from:
* Mental illness
* Traumatic brain injury
* Spinal cord injury
* Blindness
* Burns
* Amputation
* Terminal Illness/Injury
* Polytrauma
* Other conditions not mentioned above that cause significant impairment to daily living

==== Intimate Partner Violence Prevention ====
VHA also programs for women (and men) veterans who are victims of intimate partner violence (IPV). A 2017 study found that nearly one in five VHA women had experienced IPV in the preceding year, and research has shown that many military women reporting IPV experiences in the past year use VHA primary care as their main source of healthcare. VHA does not have an upper age limit for IPV screening, acknowledging that IPV is not limited by age. However, it is believed that early detection is helpful towards allowing victims to access much needed resources earlier and thus the U.S. Preventive Services Task Force suggests providers especially regularly screen women of childbearing age for IPV. The best care is provided when practitioners do not make assumptions about IPV on the basis of an individual&#x27;s sexual orientation or other factors.

No matter one&#x27;s age, there are chronic health risks associated with IPV victimization, for both men and women. Early detection is key to providing effective support systems to victims in the armed forces and reducing potential negative health consequences that are associated with such violence.

Barriers to disclosure of IPV to providers in the VHA include lack of universal routine screening, patients not being comfortable about disclosure, and individual concerns over potential negative consequences on benefits or personal items, depending on how info is shared or used.  Barriers to providing the most effective responses to IPV cases include providers lacking time and information to help, and untrained personnel creating more harm than good.

== Evaluations ==
&quot;Patients routinely rank the veterans system above the alternatives&quot;, according to the American Customer Satisfaction Index. In 2008, the VHA got a satisfaction rating of 85 for inpatient treatment, compared with 77 for private hospitals. In the same report VHA outpatient care scored 3 points higher than for private hospitals.

&quot;As compared with the Medicare fee-for-service program, the VA performed significantly better on all 11 similar quality indicators for the period from 1997 through 1999. In 2000, the VA outperformed Medicare on 12 of 13 indicators.&quot;

A study that compared VHA with commercial managed care systems in their treatment of diabetes patients found that in all seven measures of quality, the VHA provided better care.

A RAND Corporation study in 2004 concluded that the VHA outperforms all other sectors of American health care in 294 measures of quality. Patients from the VHA scored significantly higher for adjusted overall quality, chronic disease care, and preventive care, but not for acute care.

A Harvard Medical School-led study shows that cancer care provided by the Veterans Health Administration for men 65 years and older is at least as good as, and by some measures better than, Medicare-funded fee-for-service care obtained through the private sector.

== Controversies ==
=== Coronavirus (COVID-19) ===

In the midst of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) outbreak, 5,000,000 masks meant for hospitals of the Veterans Health Administration were seized by FEMA and redirected to the Strategic National Stockpile, stated Richard Stone, Executive in Charge, Veterans Health Administration. After an appeal from Veterans Affairs Secretary Robert Wilkie to FEMA, the agency provided the VA with 500,000 masks.

According to documents obtained by BuzzFeed News, at VA&#x27;s Greater LA Healthcare System, medical personnel caring for patients who had tested positive for COVID-19 would receive only a single surgical mask per shift rather than the N95 respirators recommended by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Those working in parts of the hospital without positive COVID-19 cases would be issued only a single surgical mask each week. The American Federation of Government Employees (AFGE) has filed an Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) complaint with the Department of Labor regarding safety or health hazards at VA facilities.

Veterans Affairs lists current statistics on confirmed infections and deaths due to COVID-19. , VA has 9,771 confirmed cases and 771 deaths.

<text>A clinic (or outpatient clinic or ambulatory care clinic) is a health facility that is primarily focused on the care of outpatients. Clinics can be privately operated or publicly managed and funded. They typically cover the primary care needs of populations in local communities, in contrast to larger hospitals which offer more specialized treatments and admit inpatients for overnight stays.

Most commonly, the English word &quot;clinic&quot; refers to a general practice, run by one or more general practitioners offering small therapeutic treatments, but it can also mean a specialist clinic. Some clinics retain the name &quot;clinic&quot; even while growing into institutions as large as major hospitals or becoming associated with a hospital or medical school.

==Etymology==
The word &quot;clinic&quot; derives from Ancient Greek &quot;klinein&quot; meaning to slope, lean or recline. Hence &quot;klinē&quot; is a couch or bed and &quot;klinikos&quot; is a physician who visits his patients in their beds. In Latin, this became &quot;clīnicus&quot;.

An early use of the word clinic was &quot;one who receives baptism on a sick bed&quot;.

==Overview==
Clinics are often associated with a general medical practice run by one or several general practitioners. Other types of clinics are run by the type of specialist associated with that type: physical therapy clinics by physiotherapists and psychology clinics by clinical psychologists, and so on for each health profession. (This can even hold true for certain services outside the medical field: for example, legal clinics are run by lawyers.)

Some clinics are operated in-house by employers, government organizations, or hospitals, and some clinical services are outsourced to private corporations which specialize in providing health services. In China, for example, owners of such clinics do not have formal medical education. There were 659,596 village clinics in China in 2011.

Health care in India, China, Russia and Africa is provided to those regions&#x27; vast rural areas by mobile health clinics or roadside dispensaries, some of which integrate traditional medicine. In India these traditional clinics provide ayurvedic medicine and unani herbal medical practice. In each of these countries, traditional medicine tends to be a hereditary practice.

==Function==
The function of clinics differs from country to country. For instance, a local general practice run by a single general practitioner provides primary health care and is usually run as a for-profit business by the owner, whereas a government-run specialist clinic may provide subsidized or specialized health care.

Some clinics serve as a place for people with injuries or illnesses to be seen by a triage nurse or other health worker. In these clinics, the injury or illness may not be serious enough to require a visit to an emergency room (ER), but the person can be transferred to one if needed.

Treatment at these clinics is often less expensive than it would be at a casualty department. Also, unlike an ER these clinics are often not open on a 24/7/365 basis. They sometimes have access to diagnostic equipment such as X-ray machines, especially if the clinic is part of a larger facility. Doctors at such clinics can often refer patients to specialists if the need arises.

==Large outpatient clinics==
Large outpatient clinics vary in size, but can be as large as hospitals.

===Function===
Typical large outpatient clinics house general medical practitioners (GPs) such as doctors and nurses to provide ambulatory care and some acute care services but lack the major surgical and pre- and post-operative care facilities commonly associated with hospitals.

Besides GPs, if a clinic is a polyclinic, it can house outpatient departments of some medical specialties, such as gynecology, dermatology, ophthalmology, otolaryngology, neurology, pulmonology, cardiology, and endocrinology. In some university cities, polyclinics contain outpatient departments for the entire teaching hospital in one building.

===Internationally===
Large outpatient clinics are a common type of healthcare facility in many countries, including France, Germany (long tradition), Switzerland, and most of the countries of Central and Eastern Europe (often using a mixed Soviet-German model), as well as in former Soviet republics such as Russia and Ukraine; and in many countries across Asia and Africa.

In Europe, especially in the Central and Eastern Europe, bigger outpatient health centers, commonly in cities and towns, are called policlinics (derived from the word polis, not from poly-).

Recent Russian governments have attempted to replace the policlinic model introduced during Soviet times with a more western model. However, this has failed.

In the Czech Republic, many policlinics were privatized or leasehold and decentralized in the post-communist era: some of them are just lessors and coordinators of a healthcare provided by private doctor&#x27;s offices in the policlinic building.

India has also set up huge numbers of polyclinics for former defense personnel. The network envisages 426 polyclinics in 343 districts of the country which will benefit about 33 lakh (3.3 million) ex-servicemen residing in remote and far-flung areas.

Policlinics are also the backbone of Cuba&#x27;s primary care system and have been credited with a role in improving that nation&#x27;s health indicators.

===Mobile clinics===

Providing health services through mobile clinics provides accessible healthcare services to these remote areas that have yet to make their way in the politicized space. For example, mobile clinics have proved helpful in dealing with new settlement patterns in Costa Rica. Before foreign aid organizations or the state government became involved in healthcare, Costa Rica&#x27;s people managed their own health maintenance and protection. People relied on various socio-cultural adaptations and remedies to prevent illnesses, such as personal hygiene and settlement patterns. When new settlements that sprang up along the coast became &quot;artificial&quot; communities, and due to lack of traditional home healing practices here, alternative methods such as mobile clinics had to be implemented in these communities for the protection and prevention of diseases.

A study done in rural Namibia revealed the health changes of orphans, vulnerable children and non-vulnerable children (OVC) visiting a mobile clinic where health facilities are far from the remote villages. Over 6 months, information on immunization status, diagnosis of anemia, skin and intestinal disorders, nutrition, dental disorders was collected and showed that visits to mobile clinics improved the overall health of children that visited regularly. It concluded that specified &quot;planning of these programs in areas with similarly identified barriers may help correct the health disparities among Namibian OVC and could be a first step in improving child morbidity and mortality in difficult-to-reach rural areas.&quot;

Food supplementation in the context of routine mobile clinic visits also shows to have improved the nutritional status of children, and it needs further exploration as a way to reduce childhood malnutrition in resource-scarce areas. A cross-sectional study focussed on comparing acute and chronic undernutrition rates prior to and after a food-supplementation program as an adjunct to routine health care for children of migrant workers residing in rural communities in the Dominican Republic. Rates of chronic undernutrition decreased from 33% to 18% after the initiation of the food-supplementation program and shows that the community members attending the mobile clinics are not just passively receiving the information but are incorporating it and helping keep their children nourished.

==Types==
There are many different types of clinics providing outpatient services. Such clinics may be public (government-funded) or private medical practices.
* A CLSC are in Quebec; they are a type of free clinic funded by the provincial government; they provide service not covered by Canada&#x27;s healthcare plan including social workers
* In the United States, a free clinic provides free or low-cost healthcare for those with little or without insurance.
* A retail-based clinic is housed in supermarkets and similar retail outlets providing walk-in health care, which may be staffed by nurse practitioners.
* A general out-patient clinic offers general diagnoses or treatments without an overnight stay.
* A polyclinic or policlinic provides a range of healthcare services (including diagnostics) without need of an overnight stay
* A specialist clinic provides advanced diagnostic or treatment services for specific diseases or parts of the body. This type contrasts with general out-patient clinics.
** A sexual health clinic deals with sexual health related problems, such as prevention and treatment of sexually transmitted infections.
** A gender identity clinic provides services relating to transgender health care.
** A fertility clinic aims to help women and couples to become pregnant.
** An abortion clinic is a medical facility providing abortion services to women. 
** An ambulatory surgery clinic offers outpatient or same day surgery services, usually for surgical procedures less complicated than those requiring hospitalization.
**An ultrasound clinic offers medical ultrasound investigations for patients. An ultrasound clinic is normally run privately.

<doc id="832326" wikidata="Q1359804" url="?curid=832326" title="Tutu (clothing)">
<text>A tutu is a dress worn as a costume in a classical ballet performance, often with attached bodice. It may be made of tarlatan, muslin, silk, tulle, gauze, or nylon. Modern tutus have two basic types: the Romantic tutu is soft and bell-shaped, reaching the calf or ankle; the Classical tutu is short and stiff, projecting horizontally from the waist and hip.

==Etymology==
The word tutu can refer to only the skirt part of the costume. The bodice and tutu make up what is usually the entire costume, but which is called the tutu (by synecdoche, wherein the part – the skirt – can embody the whole).

The derivation of the word &quot;tutu&quot; is unknown. The word was not recorded anywhere until 1881. One theory is that it is simply derived from the word &quot;tulle&quot; (one of the materials from which it is made).

A second theory is that the word comes from the slang of French children that refers to the buttocks (&quot;cul&quot;). During that era, the &quot;abonnés&quot; (rich male subscribers at the Paris Opera Ballet) were accustomed to mix with the ballet girls in the foyer and arrange assignations. It is suggested the expression came from the abonnés playfully patting the back of the tulle dress with the saying &quot;pan-pan cucul&quot; (French for &quot;I&#x27;ll spank your bottom&quot;).

A third, related theory suggests a derivation from the more vulgar French word &quot;cul&quot; (which can be used to refer to the bottom or genital area). During this era, women (including dancers) wore pantalettes as underwear, which were open at the crotch. The abonnés favoured the very front rows in the hope of a scandalous view, and the skirt was modified for that reason. This is supported by the description by nineteenth-century balletomane, Charles Nuitter, who defined &quot;tutu&quot; as &quot;a slang term for the very short petticoat worn by &quot;danseuses&quot; in the interest of modesty.&quot;

==History==
Marie Taglioni (1829) is believed to be the first person to sport the tutu, but the first designs of tutus actually originated two years before Taglioni performed on stage. Hippolyte Lecomte designed the basic silhouette of the Romantic tutu for Pauline Montessu in La Somnambule (1827); Taglioni&#x27;s Sylphide costume&#x27;s designs were not actually found. Ivor Guest points out the costume is very similar to what ballerinas would wear in class. The part of Creuse in Noverre&#x27;s ballet Jason et Medée was danced by Mlle Guimard who wore a pale dress in 1770. The La Sylphide tutu may have been inspired by the use of muslin petticoats to give the skirt volume instead of using the usual hoops.

Towards the end of the 18th century, female dresses had higher waistlines and became slimmer as well; dancers appeared to begin dancing without panniers (hips hoops to accentuate skirt designs) for a more natural theme that displayed the human body and allowed more freedom in movements. These translated well in costumes in order to accent the lines of the dancers. Skin-colored tights were also worn with these evolved form-fitting costumes to preserve modesty, but replace the unseemly shapes of knickers.

However, the skirt that became known specifically as the romantic tutu made its first appearance in 1832 at the Paris Opera, where Marie Taglioni wore a gauzy white skirt cut to reveal her ankles, designed by Eugene Lami in &quot;La Sylphide&quot;. From the late 19th century onwards, the tutu was steadily shortened, for ease of movement and to show off the dancer&#x27;s legs. Romantic tutus were effective in portraying the ethereal creatures that exist in many ballet repertoires, but as ballet became more modernized, the flouncy but stiff tutus would be replaced by softer more relaxed skirts. The traditional tutu is a symbol of historical dance and its past.

During the twentieth century, the tutu reached its peak form with a platelike shape; French critic André Levinson highlighted the contrast between the stiff and immobile features of the skirt and the energetic and alive movements of the dancers. The tutu&#x27;s simple design and timeless class are the product of countless adaptations to finally present the dancer in a flattering light.

Oftentimes, tutus and costumes evolved alongside fashion during their respective eras. Skirts became shorter, fuller, and necklines were even lowered in the 1870s to display &quot;sexual attractiveness.&quot; Fashion designers have often been involved in design for ballet. Fashion designers including Cecil Beaton, Christian Lacroix, and Isaac Mizrahi in the United States have all designed tutus. Among the leading makers of tutus around the world, few designers have matched the reputation of Barbara Karinska (1886–1983), the Ukrainian-born costumer for the New York City Ballet for many years, She designed and constructed tutus of extraordinary beauty and durability.

==Styles==

The Romantic tutu is still based on Marie Taglioni&#x27;s original costume, though modern materials mean it is lighter and may be more transparent. The hem falls between the knee and ankle.

The inverted bell tutu is midway between the classical tutu and the Romantic tutu. It is made of several layers of tulle which jut out similar to a classical tutu, but the layers are longer and have a downward droop, usually to mid-thigh.

There are several versions of the modern tutu:

Classical tutu: a skirt made of 10-12 layers of stiff tulle sewn on to a pantie and basque at hip level. The lower, short layers of tulle support the top layers, making them jut out from the hip.

Pancake tutu: this tutu is supported by a hoop and is very flat, with few ruffles.

Platter tutu: similar to the pancake tutu but sitting at the waist instead of the hip.

American tutu (also known as the Balanchine, Karinska or powderpuff tutu): Very short ruffles of tulle are loosely sewn on to a pantie to give a soft effect.

<text>Clinton Banker Ford (March 1, 1913 – September 23, 1992) was an American investor, musician and amateur astronomer specializing in the observation of variable stars.

== Birth and family ==
Clinton Banker Ford, born on March 1, 1913, in Ann Arbor, Michigan, was the son of Walter and Edith (Banker) Ford. Ford had one brother, Sylvester Ford (1906–1956). The Ford side of the family hailed from Oneonta, New York where it survived until the 1930s. Ford&#x27;s mother&#x27;s family came from Ovid, New York.

Ford&#x27;s father, Walter, was a mathematics professor at the University of Michigan at Ann Arbor. Ford&#x27;s first brush with the stars came in August 1927 when he went with his father to Boulder, CO to a meeting of the AMA. It was at this point in his life that Ford first saw the splendor the sky could show.

== First brush with the stars ==
In the Spring of 1927 Professor Ralph Curtiss loaned Ford two books: &quot;Splendour of the Heavens&quot; and &quot;The Friendly Stars&quot;. In the back of the latter book&#x27;s original edition there was an invitation by William Tyler Olcott of the AAVSO to contribute to the advancement of astronomy by observing variable stars. Ford took Olcott and the AAVSO up on that invitation and on September 23, 1927, he reported his first variable star estimate - 184205 R Scuti at 5.3 magnitude.

Ford made over 60,000 variable star observations and became the youngest member of the American Association of Variable Star Observers at the age of fifteen.

== The voyage to Europe ==
Ford, by virtue of a sabbatical his father took, was lucky enough to tour Europe, the Middle East, and Egypt when he was fifteen. Ford spent his sixteenth birthday in Alexandretta. Among several adventures Ford had at the time, one included climbing to the top of the Great Pyramid and carving his name into it.

Ford also visited several observatories, astronomers, and museums. He used the 6&quot; refractor at the University of Leiden, for example, to make 36 variable star estimates for the AAVSO at this time. Later he visited American astronomer George W. Ritchey then on staff at the Observatoire de Paris where Ritchey told Ford all about his wish to create the 300&quot; Apalantic Supertelescope. We now know this general design today as the Ritchey-Chrétien telescope. Ford also attended a meeting of the Société Astronomique de France while in Paris.

Ford&#x27;s astronomical adventures in Europe were brought to a conclusion when he visited Greenwich Observatory and stood, on May 31, &quot;right below the transit slit, with one foot at 23h 59m 59.999s and the other one at 00h 00m 00.001s.&quot;

== High school and college ==
Upon returning from Europe, and as he finished high school, Ford found himself working for the aging Professor Edwin B. Frost at Yerkes Observatory, partially on the strength of an article he&#x27;d written for &quot;Popular Astronomy&quot; magazine. While at Yerkes he managed to do some variable star observing with some of the smaller telescopes, trace copies of the AAVSO charts that were in the Yerkes files, and learn about developing astronomical plates.

College saw Ford at the University of Michigan. Here he nearly decided to major in English and waited until his sophomore year to take his first astronomy course. In August and September 1932 Ford traveled to Maine to view the total solar eclipse on August 31. In the spring of 1933 Ford resolved to &quot;return to science&quot; with regard to his studies. A year later he gained Professor Heber D. Curtis, famous for his part in the Shapley-Curtis Debate on the nature of the galaxy, as his advisor.

== Post-college ==
He served in the US Navy in World War II. Later in life, he played violin with the Stamford Symphony Orchestra of Stamford, Connecticut.

He became a member of the Ithaca College Board of Trustees in 1966 and was awarded honorary status in 1988. The college has named its observatory in his honor.

He was famous in amateur astronomical circles for his quote: &quot;Never sleep more than 90 feet from your telescope.&quot; In 1987 he won the Amateur Achievement Award of the Astronomical Society of the Pacific.

The headquarters of the AAVSO in Cambridge, Massachusetts, is named the Clinton B. Ford Astronomical Data and Research Center.

When he died, aged 79, he bequeathed a substantial endowment to the AAVSO, which continues to serve as its primary source of operating income.

== Ford Observatories ==
The AAVSO previously owned the Ford Observatory named in his honor in southern California, near Wrightwood (Observatory Code 674); it was donated to the Los Angeles Astronomical Society (LAAS) in 2012. Ithaca College in New York owns another observatory of the same name, Ford Observatory, named in his honor in 1998 (Observatory Code 845); it was previously known as Ithaca College Observatory.

==Amateur music==

Ford was an avid amateur violinist and chamber music player. He carried his violin with him on travels and in every location sought out local players to join him in string quartet sessions. He was one of the leading amateur musicians in the Associated Chamber Music Players (ACMP), an organization that encourages amateur chamber music and publishes an international directory of chamber music players. On his death, he bequeathed 6 million dollars to ACMP to establish a fund to advance chamber music education.

<text>[[Warsaw]] is one of the most important education centres of Poland. It is home to four major universities and over 62 smaller schools of higher education. The overall number of students of all grades of education in Warsaw is almost 500,000 (29.2% of the city population; 2002). The number of university students is over 255,000.

The University of Warsaw (&quot;Uniwersytet Warszawski&quot;, 55,000 students, 19 faculties) was established in 1816, when the partitions of Poland separated Warsaw from the oldest and most influential Polish academic center, in Kraków. Warsaw University of Technology (&quot;Politechnika Warszawska&quot;, 31,000 students, 18 faculties) is the second academic school of technology in the country, and one of the largest in Central Europe, employing 2,000 professors. It was established in 1898 as the Nicolas II&#x27;s Technical Institute, in 1915 changed the name at the present one. Other institutions for higher education:
* Medical University of Warsaw (&quot;Warszawski Uniwersytet Medyczny&quot;, the largest medical school in Poland and one of the most prestigious – established in 1950 as the Medical Academy (earlier a medicine was being lectured at the Medical Faculty of the University of Warsaw), the present name obtained in 2008; 10,000 students, 4 faculties;
* National Defence University University (&quot;AON&quot;), highest military academic institution in Poland, established in 1951 with seven faculties;
* Fryderyk Chopin University of Music (&quot;Uniwersytet Muzyczny Fryderyka Chopina&quot;), the oldest and largest music school in Poland, and one of the largest in Europe, established in 1810 with six faculties;
* Warsaw School of Economics (&quot;SGH&quot;), the oldest and most renowned economic university in the country, established in 1906 as “August Zieliński&#x27;s Men&#x27;s Private Trade Courses”, the present name obtained in 1916, but between 1949 and 1991 had the name “Main School of Planning and Statistics”; 18,000 students. There are no faculties as all the professors work in the five colleges and the educational programs are being made by the whole university, not by a given college;
* University of Life Science (&quot;SGGW&quot;) - the largest agricultural university founded in 1816 as the Agronomic Institute, since 1840 – Institute of Forestry and Farming, since 1919 – the Main School of Farming (this is still the university&#x27;s name in Polish); 30,000 students, 13 faculties;
* Academy of Physical Education (&quot;AWF&quot;) – established in 1929 as the Central Institute of Physical Education, the present name obtained in 1949; it has three faculties.
The Copernicus Science Centre, a science museum, is located on the bank of the Vistula River in Warsaw. It contains over 450 interactive exhibits that enable visitors to single-handedly carry out experiments and discover the laws of science for themselves. The centre is the largest institution of its type in Poland and one of the most advanced in Europe.

<doc id="832384" wikidata="Q8100696" url="?curid=832384" title="Special police">
<text>Special police usually describes a law enforcement agency or unit within a such an agency whose duties and responsibilities are significantly different from other forces in the same nation, jurisdiction, or from other personnel within the same agency, although there is no consistent international definition. Generally, special police personnel hold some level of police powers; sometimes they hold the same powers and authority of other law enforcement officers within their jurisdiction, more rarely they will have no powers beyond that of the average citizen, but at a minimum they will typically possess enhanced detainment and arrest authority. &#x27;Special police&#x27; may also be used to describe individuals who are granted police powers incidental to their primary duties, such as welfare fraud investigators, certain security guards, child welfare investigators, and agricultural inspectors. Special police personnel may work for governmental, public, or private, entities. Special police personnel may be armed or unarmed.

&#x27;Special police&#x27; is also occasionally used when referring to an &#x27;elite&#x27; law enforcement agency or unit, such as special weapons and tactics (SWAT) units or other similar paramilitary forces who have some level of police powers.

== Canada ==
&quot;Special police&quot; is not a term used in Canada, but specialized police agencies exist in Alberta, British Columbia, Nova Scotia, and Ontario. Canada also makes use of special constables, a similar concept to &quot;special police&quot;.

In Alberta, special police forces can be maintained by transit authorities and universities and are usually referred to as protective services. Protective services are staffed by unarmed community peace officers who have law enforcement powers but cannot enforce criminal legislation.

In British Columbia, any provincially-approved entity or First Nation can establish a designated policing unit (DPU) to supplement &quot;the policing and law enforcement otherwise provided by the provincial police force or a municipal police department.&quot; Although officers of a DPU are armed police officers with the same authority as any other municipal police officer, designated policing units must comply with stricter regulations compared to municipal police services and are led by a Chief Officer, who has less authority over their staff than an ordinary police chief. As of 2022, there are three designated policing units in the province: the Metro Vancouver Transit Police, which provides police services to TransLink, the regional transit provider in the Vancouver metropolitan area; the Organized Crime Agency of British Columbia, which is responsible for investigating and prosecuting organized crime rings; and the Stlʼatlʼimx Tribal Police Service, which serves ten St&#x27;at&#x27;imc communities in the northern end of the Squamish-Lillooet Regional District.

There is one special police force in Nova Scotia, the Halifax-Dartmouth Bridge Commission Bridge Patrol. The Patrol is composed of special constables with limited police authority to enforce traffic violations on or near Bridge Commission property.

In Ontario, any organization can request the authority to raise a special constabulary from the local police services board. With some exceptions, officers employed by special constabularies do not carry guns and cannot refer to themselves as police. In general, special constables in Ontario employed by special constabularies have full police powers — including the ability to enforce the Criminal Code — but only on, between, or in relation to property owned by the organization that is responsible for the special constabulary. As of 2022, there is one special constabulary with armed employees, the Niagara Parks Police Service, which is responsible for providing police services to property owned or maintained by the Niagara Parks Commission. Special constabularies are also maintained by universities, transit systems, and public housing authorities.

== Former Yugoslavia ==

The Special Police were a branch of the Regular Police who were used for restoring peace and stability if it had been heavily disturbed, counter-terrorism, countering violent groups, and repressing riots (especially in prisons). The Special Police also provided security and public peace, investigated and prevented organized crime, terrorism and other violent groups; protected state and private property; and helped and assisted civilians and other emergency forces in cases of emergency, natural disasters, civil unrest and armed conflicts.

== Greece ==
The term &quot;Special (Police) Guards&quot; () describes a special class of police personnel, employed on a 5-year contract to supplement regular police officers. The idea for the creation of the category is attributed to Michalis Chrisochoidis and Chief Ioannis Georgakopoulos and was realised in 1999. Special Guards number 2,000 out of the 65,000-strong force.

== Indonesia ==
Special police in Indonesia, locally known as , refer to law enforcement agencies outside the Indonesian National Police. These law enforcement agencies are under supervision and are trained by the National Police. They include the Agricultural and Animal Quarantine Police, Forestry Police, Municipal Police, Prison Police, Railroad Police and Special Police for Management of Marine, Coastal Region and Remote Islands.

The Indonesian National Police also have their own special police unit, the POLSUSPAS (Police Special Penitentiary). It is a Special Police Corps (Special Police) as well as ASN (Civil Servants) under the Ministry of Law and Human Rights. It is tasked with supervising, coaching, security and safety for convicts and detainees. 

== New Zealand ==
Aside from the New Zealand Police, special powers are derived in legislation for customs officers, Fisheries Officers, and Fire Police. The Fire Police hold the full legal powers of a Police Constable when on official duty; Customs Officers, Fishery Officers, and Aviation Security Officers have limited powers (including the power to arrest or detain) in particular circumstances.

== Northern Cyprus ==

* TRNC Special Operation Department

== United Kingdom ==
In the United Kingdom, special police force has a special meaning in law and describes one of the forces defined as such in legislation including:

* Serious Organised Crime and Police Act 2005
* Police, Public Order and Criminal Justice (Scotland) Act 2006
* Police and Justice Act 2006

These are managed by government departments other than the Home Office, and have duties and responsibilities associated with particular legal or illegal activities rather than the geographical areas which are served by a single territorial police force.

There are three such forces:
* British Transport Police: Responsible for policing the rail network in Great Britain.
* Civil Nuclear Constabulary: Non-military nuclear installations and non-military nuclear material in transit.
* Ministry of Defence Police: Ministry of Defence property, personnel, other defence interests, UK nuclear weapons and special nuclear materials.

The National Crime Agency (whose full powers are limited to England and Wales) is not a police force but an agency responsible &quot;to the Home Secretary and, through the Home Secretary, to Parliament.&quot; The NCA has the power to direct police forces within England and Wales, and the British Transport Police, to provide officers or undertake specific activities. Within Scotland and Northern Ireland, however, the power to direct assistance is limited to reflect the devolved administration of policing. The NCA enabling legislation does not allow the Home Secretary to give &quot;directed tasking arrangements&quot; to Scottish or Northern Irish police forces. NCA officers can be &#x27;triple warranted&#x27; – with powers of a police officer, immigration officer and customs officer.

== United States ==
Within the United States, &#x27;special police&#x27; may refer to:
* Auxiliary, reserve, or special police; members of volunteer, unpaid or paid, part-time unit of a larger, full-service law enforcement agency (such as the NYPD Auxiliary)
* Company or private police (see private policing in the United States)
* Fire police
* Security police or private security officers granted law enforcement authority
* State- or jurisdiction-specific variations of &quot;special police officer&quot;, such as Massachusetts&#x27; &quot;Special State Police Officer&quot;, or Kentucky and New Jersey&#x27;s &quot;Special Law Enforcement Officer&quot;

While no single definition of &quot;special police&quot; prevails across the United States, it is typically understood to mean either a law enforcement agency working for a unique jurisdiction (such as a hospital or park) or a law enforcement officer whose authority, training, and experience may differ somewhat from a &quot;regular&quot; law enforcement officer (LEO).

The term can also refer to limited police power granted in some jurisdictions to lifeguards, SPCA personnel, teachers, and other public sector employees which is incidental to their main responsibilities.

The specific powers granted to special police officers vary widely from state to states and sometimes within a single state. Some states, such as Maryland, New York, and the District of Columbia, grant full police/peace officer authority to SPOs for use in whatever area they are employed to protect. They may make traffic stops in their jurisdiction if they have had accredited training. They are also permitted to conduct traffic control and investigations pertaining to the area protected by them.

In some jurisdictions, SPOs may be granted only limited arrest authority in specific circumstances, while in still other jurisdictions, SPOs are granted no more authority than an otherwise private citizen could exercise in effecting a citizen&#x27;s arrest. Many jurisdictions permit SPOs to carry a firearm (some even while off-duty, with some SPOs being covered under LEOSA), but some are not permitted to do so. Even in the latter case, however, they are typically permitted to carry at least OC spray (pepper spray), a baton, and/or handcuffs.

Some SPOs are permitted to conduct traffic stops. In these cases, the SPOs typically (although not always) hold &quot;full&quot; police powers. SPOs that are primarily responsible for law enforcement in a given jurisdiction (such as hospital or campus police) are more likely to hold this authority than, for example, an SPO working for a municipality&#x27;s law enforcement agency as an auxiliary law enforcement officer.

Uniforms of SPOs also vary widely. SPOs that hold no or limited police authority are typically uniformed in a manner that makes it immediately apparent that they are not &quot;regular&quot; law enforcement. This may range from distinctly different color uniforms than what local regular LEOs wear to some sort of patch or badge clearly identifying them as &quot;special&quot;, &quot;reserve&quot;, or &quot;auxiliary&quot; LEOs. SPOs whom hold &quot;full&quot; law enforcement authority typically wear uniforms that are similar to other local LEOs. While individual departments are usually given a wide latitude in the wear of their uniforms, some states have specific laws, codes, or regulations that require special police to be clearly identified as such.

=== California ===
The San Francisco Patrol Special Police is a neighborhood police force authorized in the City Charter, with officers appointed and regulated by the Police Commission after an initial security review by the San Francisco Police Department. Hourly rates for service are principally paid by private clients, with some cost to the city for general program administration concerning standards of professional performance, but not concerning day-to-day operations. Thus, the nature of this special police force is both quasi-private and quasi-public. The force has been in operation in the United States, city of San Francisco for over 162 years. By current City Code the force provides patrols on the streets of San Francisco as well as at fixed locations, and also provides a range of other safety services as requested by private clients.

=== Kentucky ===
In Kentucky, special police officers are Special Law Enforcement Officers (SLEO). They are sworn peace officers with limited jurisdiction. They have full legal police powers; explicitly including arrest authority, the ability to carry a weapon, and use emergency vehicles. However, their jurisdiction is specifically limited to public property that they have been hired to protect. While Kentucky law allows both the State and local governments to use SLEO&#x27;s, most are used by the Kentucky State Police in the Facilities Security Branch.

=== Massachusetts ===
Within the Commonwealth of Massachusetts, &quot;special police&quot; usually refers to Special State Police Officers (SSPOs) whom are law enforcement officers typically employed by a college, university, or hospital police force. SSPOs must attend and graduate either the 16-week SSPO Academy hosted by the Massachusetts State Police (MSP) in New Braintree, Massachusetts, or any of the 20-week Recruit Officer Courses (the same academies attended by municipal LEOs across the commonwealth) approved by the Municipal Police Training Council (MPTC). Prospective SSPOs may have the training requirement waived by the Massachusetts State Police if they have completed an MPTC-approved Reserve/Intermittent Academy, have worked at least 2,000 hours as a part-time LEO, and have an associate&#x27;s degree or higher in criminal justice; SSPO candidates whom have a significant full-time LE work history and have previously completed any LE academy may also apply for a training waiver from the MSP. SSPOs typically have the same police powers as &quot;regular&quot; police officers within the commonwealth, although they may only exercise it pursuant to their duties and usually only while on their employer&#x27;s property.

Massachusetts law provides that campus police officers of the University of Massachusetts be accorded the powers and status of a &quot;regular&quot; police officer when duly appointed.

Massachusetts law also provides the apparatus for appointment as &quot;regular&quot; police officers for campus police officers of other state universities and colleges as well as community colleges. This is covered under two statutes; MGL, Part I, Title XII, Chapter 73, Section 18 and MGL, Part I, Title II, Chapter 15A, Section 22. However, it has become nearly universal practice for such institutions&#x27; law enforcement agencies to obtain SSPO commissions for their officers, in addition to the powers statutorily granted to them. This practice is only statutorily required of campus police officers employed by &quot;private&quot; institutions, as outlined by MGL, Part I, Title II, Chapter 22C, Section 63. This practice does not accord such officers any additional authority - nor does it serve to limit to it - and it is unclear why this practice has become commonplace.

Officers and investigators of the Massachusetts Department of Correction (MADOC) and parole officers of the Massachusetts Parole Board (MPB) are also authorized to be sworn as SSPOs upon recommendation by the MADOC commissioner or chairman of the Massachusetts Parole Board, respectively, given they meet SSPO training requirements. Like other SSPOs, they may only exercise their police powers while on-duty and pursuant to their specific duties. MADOC SSPOs are permitted to exercise their police powers in and around Massachusetts penal institutions, while transporting prisoners, and in order to prevent a prisoner from escaping. Both MADOC and MPB SSPOs are permitted to serve warrants issued by the governor, the MADOC commissioner or by the MPB chairman. MPB SSPOs may also execute warrants issued by Massachusetts courts. MPB SSPOs may also arrest parolees that have violated their parole conditions or have committed a crime before the parole officer, and have full police powers when assisting a &quot;regular&quot; police officer. Probation officers of the Massachusetts Probation Service are, unlike parole officers, not sworn as SSPOs. Instead, Massachusetts General Law specifically empowers them as &quot;regular&quot; police officers whom may exercise such authority throughout the commonwealth, and are required to attend a Probation Service academy.

Locally, some towns and cities may use the term &quot;special police officer&quot; to refer to reserve/part-time members of their police departments, such as in Wellesley and Lincoln, MA. If they are sworn, the state requires all special police officers to complete 372.5 hours of training, with an additional 56 hours for those carrying a firearm, the same as other part-time or reserve officers in Massachusetts.

There are also a plethora of &quot;special police officers&quot; whom work in the city of Boston; these officers either work directly for the city (Boston School Police, Boston Municipal Protective Services, Boston Public Health Commission Police, Boston Housing Authority Police, or Boston Fire Department arson investigators) or for private security and armored car companies. The city of Boston required these agencies to attend a Boston Police Department-approved academy which was a minimum of 160 training hours. However, as of 1 July 2021, most Boston special police officers were stripped of their police powers and the automatic right to carry a firearm on-duty, due to the passage of Massachusetts bill S.2963. The bill requires anyone exercising police powers, including Boston special police officers, to have graduated from an MPTC-approved academy or the MSP-sponsored SSPO Academy; The city of Boston is still permitted to issue special police officer licenses, but prospective officers must meet the aforementioned requirements. As of September 2021, only 6 licenses had been re-issued, all to Boston Housing Authority special police officers.

Special police officers and SSPOs whom work for a &quot;public agency&quot;, (i.e. any state or municipal agency, school, or hospital) and are authorized to carry firearms on-duty, qualify to carry a firearm concealed, off-duty, anywhere in the United States, as per the Law Enforcement Officers Safety Act. This act does not grant any additional police authority to individuals that fall under it. Individuals employed by private agencies, i.e. security companies, private schools, or private hospitals, do not qualify for LEOSA protections, even if they are sworn SSPOs whom are authorized to carry a firearm on-duty.

=== New Jersey ===
In New Jersey, &quot;special police&quot; generally refers to &quot;Special Law Enforcement Officers&quot; (SLEOs), whom are typically utilized to supplement full-time &quot;regular&quot; police officers. As codified within New Jersey state law, there are currently three classes of SLEOs, divided into &quot;Class I&quot;, &quot;Class II&quot;, and &quot;Class III&quot;.

Class I SLEOs are allowed to conduct routine traffic detail, spectator control, and similar duties, but are not authorized to carry a firearm while on duty. Such SLEOs are required to attend and graduate a state-approved &quot;Class I academy&quot;.

Class II SLEOs must attend a state-approved &quot;Class II academy&quot; and are afforded full police powers while on-duty. They are authorized to carry a firearm.

Class III SLEO licenses are reserved for retired and fully-trained police officers who are under the age of 65 years old. They serve on a part-time basis and authorized to provide security while on school or college premises during hours when the school or college is normally in session or when occupied by students, teachers, or professors. These Officers do not replace regular law enforcement officers or school resource officers currently employed in schools.

By law, all armed SLEOs must return their firearm to the station house unless the firearm is owned by the SLEO in compliance with unit policy on personally owned firearms. All Class II and Class III SLEOs are fully trained and certified police officers in the State of New Jersey. Class I SLEOs go through different certifications, but still have police officer status. Class Two Officers in Newark carry weapons off duty.

=== New Orleans, Louisiana ===
The Superintendent of the New Orleans Police Department in accordance with New Orleans Home Rule Charter section 4-502 (2) (a) (b) and New Orleans Municipal Code 17271 MCS 90–86, may deputize private Security Guards, within the city limits, with limited Police Power as New Orleans Police Special Officers. Louisiana R.S. 40:1379.1 (b) states the Special Officer, when performing those tasks requiring a Special Officer&#x27;s commission, shall have the same powers and duties as a Peace Officer, however, that when not performing these tasks directly related to the special officer&#x27;s commission, he shall be regarded as a private citizen and his commission shall not be in effect. Special Officers may make arrest for felony or misdemeanor offenses on the property or area they are to protect, patrol, or in relation to their direct assignment. However, Special Officers still may make an arrest, as a private person, for a felony, whether in or out of his presence, under Louisiana Law CCRP Art.214 Arrest by private person; when lawful.

=== North Carolina ===
In North Carolina, some private companies have their own special police forces. These include hospitals, hotels, race tracks, and shopping malls and are more properly referred to as &quot;Company Police&quot;. There are also companies that offer contract special police services for a fee to anyone who has property they wish to protect. In the state of North Carolina, special police differ greatly from security companies. North Carolina Special police officers have full arrest powers on any property they are hired to protect within the state as granted by the North Carolina Attorney General. Special police officers must also attend and pass the Basic Law Enforcement Training program like all other police officers. Security officers do not have arrest powers as their job is to mainly observe and report.

=== Oregon ===
Historically, Oregon had many more special police officers than the state does presently, beginning in the 19th century. While the roles they served have largely been replaced by more conventional law enforcement officers, some special police officers and the authorities for commissioning them remain. For instance, under Oregon law, mayors or similar officials who oversee a municipal water supply system are permitted to appoint special police officers which possess police powers for the purposes of maintaining the purity of drinking water. The regional government Metro appoints special police for the purposes of enforcing parking laws and codes. The city of Portland also commissions special police officers for this purpose.

=== Smithsonian Museum Special Police in NY, Virginia, &amp; DC ===

The Smithsonian museum utilizes federal employees designated as &quot;special police&quot; under the United States Code (Title 10, Chapter 63, §6306). These officers patrol Smithsonian property in New York, Virginia, and the District of Columbia. Smithsonian Special Police Officers carry firearms, mace and handcuffs and have arrest authority on federal Smithsonian property.

=== Tennessee ===
Tennessee code annotated 3-18-118 &amp; T.C.A. 4-3-1106 defines the laws of the commissioning of special police officers/deputies in the state of Tennessee. Tennessee requires all special police officers to hold an active armed security license and possess equivalent military or civilian law enforcement training. These officers traditionally work for private companies as company police or in hospitals or private universities and their jurisdiction is limited to the property to which they are employed. While on duty these officers have full arrest powers and are able to act in law enforcement capacity.

The Department of Safety and Homeland Security maintains a unit of special police officers known as Facility Protection Officers who were created by the Tennessee General Assembly in T.C.A. 4-3-2019. These F.PO.s are managed by the Protective Services Division of the Tennessee Highway Patrol&#x27;s Facility Protection Unit and provide police services to state facilities. F.P.O.s are granted the authority to make arrests for public offenses committed against state officials or employees or committed upon, about, or against property owned or leased by the state or on public roads or rights-of-way passing through such owned or leased property.

=== Texas ===
The Texas Special Police were formed along with the Texas State Police during the administration of Texas Governor Edmund J. Davis on July 22, 1870, to combat crime statewide in Texas. There were thirty special policemen assigned as auxiliary officers throughout the state. On April 22, 1873, the law authorizing the state police was repealed by the newly elected Democratic-controlled state legislature.

Texas state law authorizes mayors to appoint special police officers to enforce the municipality&#x27;s laws, avert danger, or protect life or property; because of riot, outbreak, calamity, or public disturbance; or because of threat of serious violation of law or order, of outbreak, or of other danger to the municipality or its inhabitants.

Municipal special police officers are distinct and separate from municipal Marshals and their deputies, as special police derive their authority from the office of the mayor, while Marshals and their deputies derive their authority from the municipal council, and are generally permitted to perform a wider scope of duties such as issuing and executing warrants for arrest.

=== Virginia ===
Virginia possesses special police officers employed, typically, in the private police field. These officers are regulated by the Virginia Department of Criminal Justice Services and are termed special conservators of the peace (SCOP). These officers must meet specific training requirements and be sworn in by the district court judge or magistrate in the area where they request a commission. These officers, when so sworn and certified, are permitted to utilize the term &quot;police&quot; (this was removed by the state legislature in 2018 and they may no longer use the term) and are permitted to operate emergency vehicles equipped with red flashing/strobing lights (municipal law enforcement operates either blue or combinations of blue and red).

This class of officers should not be confused with armed security officers who in Virginia possess arrest authority on the property they are employed to protect. Armed security officers do not have fresh pursuit authority (off of their grounds/property) whereas SCOP officers do.

=== Washington, D.C. ===
Washington utilizes special police in both the public and private security sectors. Most work for private security companies although many security officers in the Washington, D.C., area also have special police status. Special police are required to be licensed and are appointed by the Mayor.

<doc id="832458" wikidata="Q3564463" url="?curid=832458" title="Maritime geography">
<text>Maritime geography is a collection of terms used by naval military units to loosely define three maritime regions: brown water, green water, and blue water.

==Definitions==
The elements of maritime geography are loosely defined and their meanings have changed throughout history. The USA&#x27;s 2010 Naval Operations Concept defines blue water as &quot;the open ocean&quot;, green water as &quot;coastal waters, ports and harbors&quot;, and brown water as &quot;navigable rivers and their estuaries&quot;. Robert Rubel of the US Naval War College includes bays in his definition of brown water, and in the past US military commentators have extended brown water out to from shore.

During the Cold War, green water denoted those areas of ocean in which naval forces might encounter land-based aircraft and brown water, land-based artillery. The development of long-range bombers with antiship missiles turned most of the oceans to &quot;green&quot; and the term all but disappeared. After the Cold War, US amphibious taskforces were sometimes referred to as the green-water navy, in contrast to the blue-water carrier battlegroups. This distinction disappeared as increasing threats in coastal waters forced the amphibious ships further offshore, delivering assaults by helicopter and tiltrotor from over the horizon. This prompted the development of ships designed to operate in such waters - the Zumwalt class destroyer and the littoral combat ships. Rubel has proposed redefining green water as those areas of ocean which are too dangerous for high-value units, requiring offensive power to be dispersed into smaller vessels such as submarines that can use stealth and other characteristics to survive. Under his scheme brown water would be zones in which ocean-going units could not operate at all, including rivers, minefields, straits and other choke points.

==Regions==

===Brown water===
The brown water environment starts from the shoreline through to the end of the continental shelf. A brown-water navy focuses on littoral operations and primarily takes a defensive role. &quot;Brown water&quot; or &quot;brown ocean&quot; is also used by meteorologists to refer to intertidal wetlands where the border between the ocean and dry land is not clear-cut.

===Green water===
The green water environment extends from the outer edge of the brown-water layer past any continental shelves, archipelagos and islands; perhaps a few hundred miles from shore. It is the most important maritime arena, including most coastal traffic and territorial waters, in which are found the great majority of a nation&#x27;s maritime police, customs, environmental, and economic concerns. A green-water navy is capable of defense of its nation in depth and is a significant offensive force within its territory.

===Blue water===

The blue water environment extends from the outer edge of the green-water zone to the deep ocean of the world. A blue-water navy can project its nation&#x27;s power throughout the world. The blue water policy was a long-standing political philosophy in Britain in the 18th century, which sought to advance British power through use of the Royal Navy, although the term &quot;blue water&quot; did not appear until 1834.

<text>Der Hamburger und Germania Ruder Club (DHuGRC) is a rowing club from Rotherbaum, Hamburg, Germany. It was founded in 1836 as &quot;Der Hamburger Ruder Club&quot;, the club is the fourth oldest rowing club in the world (2nd if only counting non-academically affiliated clubs) after Brasenose College Boat Club, Jesus College Boat Club (Oxford) and Leander Club . The &quot;Germania Ruder Club&quot;, which was founded in 1854 merged with &quot;Der Hamburger Ruder Club&quot; in 1934, with the joint club adapting the current name. 

The current boathouse at Außenalster was opened in 2016.

==Notable Rowers==
Bastian Seibt from this club represented Germany at the 2008 Summer Olympics in Beijing, China.

<text>Clinton Ford (born Ian George Stopford Harrison; 4 November 1931 – 21 October 2009) was an English popular singer of the 1950s and 1960s.

==Biography==
He was born to George Henry Harrison and Annie Simpson who, in 1911, lived in Howard Street, off Eccles New Road in Salford, Lancashire.

Initially, he worked as a laboratory assistant, but in 1957 became a Butlins Redcoat in Pwllheli, and worked there for three summer seasons. During the winter season he sang with the Jazz Band called &#x27;Merseysippi&#x27; at the Cavern Club in Liverpool, recording several songs with them, including &quot;Get Out and Get Under&quot;.

He began his recording career as Clinton Ford with the Oriole record label, changing his name because his own did not fit some of his American songs. He performed skiffle in the Backwoods Skiffle Group and recorded some unsuccessful singles with the Hallelujah Skiffle Group. He appeared at the Royal Albert Hall, and with Ken Dodd on Dodd&#x27;s television shows. He also appeared in &quot;Stars and Garters&quot;, &quot;The Billy Cotton Band Show&quot;, and &quot;The Good Old Days&quot;.

Ford had his first success with a cover of the Red Foley song &quot;Old Shep&quot;, which appeared on the chart in 1959. Ford donated all his royalties from this recording to the Guide Dogs for the Blind. It was the only version of the song ever to chart in the UK. His next singles were &quot;Too Many Beautiful Girls&quot;, followed by &quot;Fanlight Fanny&quot; which was his most successful single, reaching 22 in the UK Singles Chart in March 1962. His album &quot;Fanlight Fanny&quot; (1962) reached number 16 in the UK Albums Chart. He toured with Kenny Ball &amp; His Jazzmen and played at the Cavern Club in Liverpool around the time that the Beatles were starting to become popular.

His career outlasted many of his contemporaries, with his singles appearing in the UK charts over a span of more than eight years. He was also in great demand on BBC Radio programmes, such as &quot;Saturday Club&quot;, where a live singer was required to sing standards and also covers of current hit songs.

After recording for Columbia Records, in 1966 Ford changed record label to Piccadilly Records. In 1967 &quot;Run To The Door&quot; again made the UK chart, and other singles including &quot;Dandy&quot; (popularized by Herman&#x27;s Hermits) backed with another Formby number &quot;Why Don&#x27;t Women Like Me&quot;, and &quot;This Song Is Just For You&quot; were released. In 1968 Ford made the comic album &quot;Clinton The Clown&quot; with George Chisholm and the Inmates in a single all-night session. The album included &quot;The Old Bazaar in Cairo&quot;, which Ford co-wrote with Ken Morris and Charlie Chester, and the suggestive &quot;My Baby&#x27;s Wild About My Old Trombone&quot;.

He set up a guest house with his wife on the Isle of Man but continued to tour throughout the 1980s and 1990s. BBC Radio 2&#x27;s veteran DJ, Brian Matthew, who was best man at Ford&#x27;s wedding, revealed on his &quot;Sounds of the &#x27;60s&quot; show, on 10 March 2007, that Ford was living on the Isle of Man but was seriously ill, unable to work and bed-ridden.

Clinton Ford died on 21 October 2009. He is survived by his wife, Margaret (Maggie) née Worsfold, whom he married in 1962, and four children, Georgina, Susannah, Rebecca and Ian.

Ford&#x27;s track &quot;Dance With a Dolly (With a Hole in Her Stocking)&quot; was chosen by the television producer Anne Wood as one of her &quot;Desert Island Discs&quot; in October 2011.

<text>William Healey Dall (August 21, 1845 – March 27, 1927) was an American naturalist, a prominent malacologist, and one of the earliest scientific explorers of interior Alaska. He described many mollusks of the Pacific Northwest of North America, and was for many years America&#x27;s preeminent authority on living and fossil mollusks.

Dall also made substantial contributions to ornithology, zoology, physical and cultural anthropology, oceanography, and paleontology. In addition he carried out meteorological observations in Alaska for the Smithsonian Institution.

==Biography==

===Early life===
Dall was born in Boston, Massachusetts. His father Charles Henry Appleton Dall, (1816–86), a Unitarian minister, moved in 1855 to India as a missionary. His family however stayed in Massachusetts, where Dall&#x27;s mother Caroline Wells Healey was a teacher, transcendentalist, reformer, and pioneer feminist.

In 1862, Dall&#x27;s father, on one of his few brief visits home, brought his son in contact with some naturalists at Harvard University, where he had studied, and in 1863, when Dall graduated from high school, he took a keen interest in mollusks. In 1863 he became a pupil of Louis Agassiz of Harvard&#x27;s Museum of Comparative Zoology, in natural science. He encouraged Dall&#x27;s interest in malacology, a field still in its infancy. He also studied anatomy and medicine under Jeffries Wyman.

===First positions, first expeditions===

Dall took a job in Chicago. There he met the famous naturalist Robert Kennicott (1835–1866) at the Chicago Academy of Sciences Museum. In 1865 the Western Union Telegraph Expedition was mounted to find a possible route for a telegraph line between North America and Russia by way of the Bering Sea. Kennicott was selected as the scientist for this expedition, and with the influence of Spencer Fullerton Baird of the Smithsonian Institution, he took Dall as his assistant, because of his expertise in invertebrates and fish. Aboard the clipper &quot;Nightingale&quot;, under the command of the naturalist Charles Melville Scammon, Dall explored the coast of Siberia, with first several stops in Alaska (still Russian territory at that time). Scammon Bay, Alaska was named after Charles Scammon.

In 1866, Dall continued this expedition to Siberia. On a stop at St. Michael, Alaska, he was informed that Kennicott had died of a heart attack on May 13, 1866, while prospecting a possible telegraph route along the Yukon River. Set on finishing Kennicott&#x27;s Yukon River work, Dall stayed on the Yukon during the winter. Because of cancellation of his own expedition, he had to continue this work at his own expense until autumn 1868. Meanwhile, in 1867, the U.S. had acquired Alaska from Russia for 7.2 million dollars. This was uncharted country, with a fauna and flora still waiting to be explored and described, a task Dall took upon himself as a surveyor-scientist.

Back at the Smithsonian, he started cataloguing the thousands of specimens he had collected during this expedition. In 1870 he published his account of his pioneering travels in &quot;Alaska and Its Resources&quot;, describing the Yukon River, the geography and resources of Alaska, and its inhabitants. Also in 1870, Dall was appointed Acting Assistant to the United States Coast Survey (renamed the United States Coast and Geodetic Survey in 1878).

Dall went on several more reconnaissance and survey missions to Alaska between 1871 and 1874. His official mission was to survey the Alaska coast, but he took the opportunity to acquire specimens, which he collected in great numbers. In 1871–72, he surveyed the Aleutian Islands. In 1874 aboard the United States Coast Survey schooner &quot;Yukon&quot;, he anchored in Lituya Bay, which he compared to Yosemite Valley in California, had it retained its glaciers.

He sent his collection of mollusks, echinoderms, and fossils to Louis Agassiz at Harvard&#x27;s Museum of Comparative Zoology; plants went to Asa Gray at Harvard; archaeological and ethnological material went to the Smithsonian. In 1877–1878 he was associated with the &quot;Blake&quot; expeditions&quot;, along the east coast of the United States. The major publications on the Blake Expeditions were published in the Bulletin of the Museum of Comparative Zoology Harvard.

Dall was in Europe in August 1878, sent to a meeting in Dublin of the British Association for the Advancement of Science. He took the opportunity to visit mollusk collections and meet European scholars.

===1880 and after===
Dall married Annette Whitney in 1880. They travelled to Alaska on their honeymoon. After arriving in Sitka, his wife went back home to Washington, D.C. He began his final survey season aboard the schooner &quot;Yukon&quot;. He was accompanied, among others, by the ichthyologist Tarleton Hoffman Bean (1846–1916).

In 1882 Dall contributed for the Republican Congressional Campaign Committee.

In 1884, Dall left the United States Coast and Geodetic Survey (known until 1878 as the U.S. Coast Survey), having already written over 400 papers. In 1885 he transferred to the newly created United States Geological Survey, obtaining a position as paleontologist. He was assigned to the U.S. National Museum as honorary curator of invertebrate paleontology, studying recent and fossil mollusks. He would hold this position until his death.

As part of his work for the U.S. Geological Survey, Dall made trips to study geology and fossils: in the Pacific Northwest (1890, 1892, 1895, 1897, 1901, and 1910), in Florida (1891), and in Georgia (1893).

In 1899 he and an elite crew of scientists, such as the expert in glaciology John Muir, were members of the Harriman Alaska Expedition along the glacial fjords of the Alaska coast and the Aleutian Islands and to the Bering Strait aboard the steamer . Many new genera and species were described. Dall was the undisputed expert on Alaska, and the scientists aboard were often surprised by his erudition, both in biology and in respect to the cultures of the native Alaskan peoples. His contributions to the reports of the Harriman Alaska Expedition, include a chapter &quot;Description and Exploration of Alaska&quot;, and Volume 13, &quot;Land and Fresh-water Mollusks&quot;.

He spent two months at the Bishop Museum in Honolulu, Hawaii, examining its shell collection.

===Societies and honors===
He was elected member of most of the U.S. scientific societies, vice-president of American Academy of Arts and Sciences (AAAS) (1882, 1885), a founder of the National Geographic Society, and the Philosophical Society of Washington. In 1897 he was elected to both the National Academy of Sciences and the American Philosophical Society. He was a Foreign Member of the Geological Society of London. His eminence also earned him several honorary degrees. Mount Dall, an peak in the Alaska Range, now in Denali National Park and Preserve, was named after Dall by A. H. Brooks of the U.S. Geological Survey in 1902. In 1912, he was elected to the American Academy of Arts and Sciences.

Dall published over 1,600 papers, reviews, and commentaries. He described 5,427 species, many of them mollusks. Many of his papers were short, but a number of his publications were comprehensive monographs.

<doc id="832478" wikidata="Q969732" url="?curid=832478" title="Ryan McGinley">
<text>Ryan McGinley (born October 17, 1977) is an American photographer and lives in New York City. He began taking photographs in 1998. In 2003, at the age of 25, he was one of the youngest artists to have a solo show at the Whitney Museum of American Art. He was named Photographer of the Year in 2003 by American Photo Magazine. In 2007, he was given the Young Photographer Infinity Award by the International Center of Photography. In 2009, he was honored at The Young Collectors Council&#x27;s Artists Ball at the Guggenheim Museum. A 2014 GQ article declared McGinley, &quot;the most important photographer in America.&quot;

==Early life and education==
McGinley was born in Ramsey, New Jersey and is the youngest of eight children. From an early age his peers and mentors were skateboarders, graffiti artists, musicians, and artists who were considered to be on the fringes of society. As a teenager, McGinley was a snowboard instructor at Campgaw Mountain, New Jersey and competed in the east coast amateur circuits from 1992 to 1995. He enrolled as a graphic design student at Parsons School of Design in New York in 1997. In 1998, he moved to the East Village, and covered the walls of his apartment with Polaroid pictures of everyone who visited there.

==Work==
As a student at Parsons, McGinley began experimenting with photography. In 1999, he put these early images together in a handmade, self-published book called &quot;The Kids Are Alright,&quot; titled after a film about The Who. He had his first public exhibition in 2000 at 420 West Broadway in Manhattan in a DIY opening. One copy of &quot;The Kids Are Alright&quot; was given to scholar and curator Sylvia Wolf, who later organized McGinley&#x27;s solo exhibition at the Whitney. In an essay about McGinley, Wolf wrote, &quot;The skateboarders, musicians, graffiti artists and gay people in Mr. McGinley&#x27;s early work &#x27;know what it means to be photographed.[...] His subjects are performing for the camera and exploring themselves with an acute self-awareness that is decidedly contemporary. They are savvy about visual culture, acutely aware of how identity can be not only communicated but created. They are willing collaborators.&quot; While he was a student at Parsons, McGinley was also the acting photo editor at &quot;Vice&quot; magazine from 2000 to 2002.

McGinley has been long time friends with fellow Lower Manhattan artists Dan Colen and the late Dash Snow. McGinley said of Snow, &quot;I guess I get obsessed with people, and I really became fascinated by Dash.&quot;

Ariel Levy, writing in &quot;New York&quot; magazine about McGinley&#x27;s friend and collaborator, Snow, said, &quot;People fall in love with McGinleyʼs work because it tells a story about liberation and hedonism: Where Goldin and Larry Clark were saying something painful and anxiety producing about Kids and what happens when they take drugs and have sex in an ungoverned urban underworld, McGinley started out announcing that &#x27;The Kids Are Alright,&#x27; fantastic, really, and suggested that a gleeful, unfettered subculture was just around the corner—&#x27;still&#x27;—if only you knew where to look.&quot;

McGinley&#x27;s early work was primarily shot on 35mm film and using Yashica T4s and Leica R8s. Since 2004, McGinley&#x27;s style has evolved from documenting his friends in real-life situations towards creating envisioned situations that can be photographed. He casts his subjects at rock ‘n’ roll festivals, art schools, and street castings in cities. In describing the essence of youth and adventure central to McGinley&#x27;s work, Jeffrey Kluger wrote in &quot;Time&quot;, &quot;Photography is about freezing a moment in time; McGinley&#x27;s is about freezing a stage in a lifetime. Young and beautiful is as fleeting as a camera snap—and thus all the more worth preserving.&quot; In 2007, critic Philip Gefter wrote, &quot;He was a fly on the wall. But then he began to direct the activities, photographing his subjects in a cinema-verite mode. &#x27;I got to the point where I couldn&#x27;t wait for the pictures to happen anymore,&#x27; he said. &#x27;I was wasting time, and so I started making pictures happen. It borders between being set up or really happening. There&#x27;s that fine line.&#x27;&quot; The transition to creating work with an emphasis on heavy pre-production is embodied in McGinley&#x27;s famous summer cross-country road trip series. In a 2014 feature, GQ said, &quot;His road trips, legendary among city-dwelling creatives under 30 (they all know someone who knows someone who went on one), have been annual summer occasions for almost a decade. McGinley and his assistants start planning the journey in January. They consult maps, newspapers, travel books. It usually starts with a specific desire—wanting to shoot kids in a cypress tree with Spanish moss, say—and the trip itself is plotted according to where such a setting can be found.&quot; As McGinley continued the series, he began incorporating different elements into his photos, such as shooting with fireworks, animals, and in extreme locations like caves.

In conversation with filmmaker Gus Van Sant, McGinley described his practice of making photographs on the road and outside of his New York City based studio, &quot;Such a big part of what I do is removing myself and other people from the city. Taking people to these beautiful and remote locations, being together for long periods of time, getting that intimacy, and doing all these intense activities together every day. In a way, it&#x27;s like a bizarre summer camp or like touring in a rock band or traveling circus. It&#x27;s all those things combined. Just taking everyone out of their element so you have their full attention.&quot;

In 2009, McGinley returned to the studio as he began experimenting within the confines of traditional studio portraiture. It was also the beginning of what became by 2010, an all entirely digital photography practice, his 2010 exhibition, &quot;Everybody Knows This Is Nowhere&quot;, at Team Gallery in NYC, where he displayed his first collection of black and white nudes. The series marked a significant shift in the style and production of McGinley&#x27;s photographs. His continued work within the realm of digital studio portraiture eventually evolved into his &quot;Yearbook&quot; series. Team Gallery describes the 2014 installation as, &quot;(...) a single artwork that consists of over five hundred studio portraits of some two hundred models, always in the nude, printed on vinyl and adhered to every available inch of the gallery&#x27;s walls and ceilings. The installation&#x27;s effect is hugely impressive in its standalone visual power, an enveloping entity flooding the entire space with bold color and form. Although the sheer abundance of available images renders a total &quot;reading&quot; impossible, there is never any sense of incompleteness, as each individual image functions autonomously, granting the viewer access to a delicate, once-private moment.&quot; Yearbook is a traveling exhibition, and while it has evolved in size and application process, it has been exhibited internationally in various forms in San Francisco; Amersfoort, the Netherlands; Basel, Switzerland; and Tokyo.

Throughout his career, McGinley has worked with various high-profile charities. Influenced by the death of his brother in 1995 due to HIV/AIDS-related complications, McGinley is vocally passionate about raising funds for HIV/AIDS awareness and treatment research. At the 2014 amfAR Gala, a photograph donated by McGinley was purchased by Miley Cyrus, who narrowly outbid Tom Ford, for a record breaking price. Also in 2014 McGinley photographed Ines Rau, a transgender person, fully nude for a spread in &quot;Playboy&quot; magazine called &quot;Evolution.&quot;

In recent years, McGinley has become well known for the circle of successful younger artists surrounding him and his studio, prompting the New York Times to refer to him as, &quot;The Pied Piper of the Downtown Art World&quot;. McGinley describes his mentorship practices as, &quot;In a way, it&#x27;s a curriculum, as I can give people advice because I’ve been through it.&quot;

In 2014, McGinley gave the commencement address at Parsons School of Design. To graduating students he offered the advice, &quot;Say yes to almost everything and try new things. Don&#x27;t be afraid to fail, and don&#x27;t be afraid to work hard. Do your pictures—don&#x27;t try and do somebody else&#x27;s pictures. Don&#x27;t get lost inside your head, and don&#x27;t worry what camera you’re using.&quot; He continued, &quot;I once heard the legendary indie director Derek Jarman had three rules for making his art films: &#x27;Show up early, hold your own light, and don’t expect to get paid.&#x27; That always stuck with me. Approach art like it&#x27;s your job. Show up for photography every day for eight hours. Take it as seriously as a doctor would medicine.&quot; Since 2005, McGinley has periodically lectured and critiqued works of MFA photography students at Yale University. He has been a member of the School of Visual Arts Mentors program.

===Music===
McGinley is credited for the formation of the New York City based band The Virgins after introducing and photographing two of its members in Tulum in 2004. He said of the band, &quot;Their lyrics are really poetic and very much about New York and the life that we live.&quot; In 2008, the Icelandic post-rock band Sigur Rós used one of McGinley&#x27;s images for their fifth album &quot;Með suð í eyrum við spilum endalaust&quot;. The video for the first track from the album, &quot;Gobbledigook&quot;, was inspired by his work. In 2012, McGinley reunited with the band to direct the video for &quot;Varúð&quot;. The non-profit Art Production Fund partnered with the NYC Taxi Commission to show the film in 3,000 cabs. The next year, it was screened in Times Square as part of Art Production Fund&#x27;s Midnight Moment series, in which every night at midnight for one month the video played simultaneously on electronic billboards and newspaper kiosks throughout Times Square.

McGinley has photographed musicians for both album artwork and editorial projects. In 2012, he provided the artwork for Bat for Lashes&#x27;s album &quot;The Haunted Man&quot;. In 2013, he created images for Katy Perry&#x27;s fourth studio album, &quot;Prism&quot;. He photographed Beyonce for BEAT Magazine, Lady Gaga for Rolling Stone, and Lorde for Dazed and Confused.

===Commercial and editorial work===
McGinley contributed editorially to &quot;The New York Times Magazine&quot; including his 2004 Olympic Swimmers, 2008 Oscars Portfolio, and 2010 Winter Olympics.

He has worked in fashion editorial and advertising. In 2009, McGinley helped launch Levi&#x27;s &quot;Go Forth&quot; campaign. In 2012 and 2013, he worked with U2 singer Bono on producing a short film and photographs for fashion brand EDUN. Additionally, he has made photographs for beauty and fragrance campaigns by Calvin Klein, Dior, Hermès, and Stella McCartney.

McGinley has also been featured as a model in campaigns by The Gap, Marc Jacobs, Salvatore Ferragamo, and Uniqlo.

==Exhibitions==
In 2003, the Whitney Museum gave McGinley a solo show as part of their &quot;First Exposure&quot; series. He has had solo shows at MoMA P.S.1 in New York (2004), and at the MUSAC in Leon, Spain (2005). In 2005, he was the laureate of the Rencontres d&#x27;Arles Discovery Award. In 2007 McGinley exhibited &quot;Irregular Regulars&quot; at Team Gallery in SoHo. Art critic David Velasco, in his review of the show, wrote, &quot;McGinley went on a two-year road trip, traveling to dozens of Morrissey concerts in the US, the UK, and Mexico. The resultant photos, many of which are densely saturated in the concerts’ colored lights, feature candid shots of fans, regularly zooming in for seductive close-ups of enamored youngsters—a celebration of the ecstatic cult of fame and its ardent enablers.&quot;

In 2008 he exhibited &quot;I Know Where the Summer Goes&quot;, also at Team Gallery. Kluger, writing in &quot;Time&quot;, said, &quot;But his favorite subject remains youth, as his 2008 exhibit, &#x27;I Know Where the Summer Goes,&#x27; proves. In that collection, McGinley&#x27;s troupe travels the country as he photographs them, sometimes clothed and often not, while they leap fences, lounge in a desert, play together in a tree.&quot;

In 2010, McGinley debuted his first collection of black and white studio nudes, &quot;Everybody Knows This Is Nowhere&quot;, at Team Gallery in New York. Later in 2010, his exhibition &quot;Life Adjustment Center&quot; was held at Ratio 3 in San Francisco. There he debuted two new portfolios of black and white portraits and color photographs. In 2012, he had simultaneous shows at Team Gallery&#x27;s two SoHo locations. &quot;Animals&quot; and &quot;Grids&quot; juxtaposed two new series of photographs: nudes with animals and large grids of intimate portraits of young concert-goers. In 2013, McGinley exhibited his largest project to date,&quot;Yearbook&quot;. A collection of hundreds of colorful studio portraits but conceived as a single artwork, the installation covered every available inch of the walls of San Francisco&#x27;s Ratio 3. In 2014, the exhibition grew larger, this time staged at Team Gallery. &quot;Yearbook&quot; continued to travel in 2015, showing at Kunsthal kAdE in Amersfoort and Art Unlimited at Art Basel.

In 2015, McGinley&#x27;s work further departed from his summer road trip series with bicoastal exhibitions &quot;Fall&quot; and &quot;Winter&quot;, at Team Gallery&#x27;s SoHo and Venice Beach locations. His work was featured in the Guggenheim Museum&#x27;s 2015 exhibition, &quot;Storylines&quot;. The show was described as &quot;an expansive view of the new paradigms for storytelling forged during the past ten years to communicate ideas about race, gender, sexuality, history, and politics, among other trenchant themes.&quot;

<doc id="832480" wikidata="Q1790042" url="?curid=832480" title="National pipe thread">
<text>American National Standard Pipe Thread standards, often called national pipe thread standards for short, are United States national technical standards for screw threads used on threaded pipes and pipe fittings. They include both tapered and straight thread series for various purposes, including rigidity, pressure-tight sealing, or both. The types are named with a full name and an abbreviation, such as NPT, NPS, NPTF, or NPSC.

MIP is an abbreviation for male iron pipe, and FIP is an abbreviation for female iron pipe.

Outside North America, some US pipe thread sizes are widely used, as well as many British Standard Pipe threads and ISO 7–1, 7–2, 228–1, and 228-2 threads.

==Types==
The various types are each named with an abbreviation and a full name, as follows:

== Uses ==
Threaded pipes can provide an effective seal for pipes transporting liquids, gases, steam, and hydraulic fluid. These threads are now used in materials other than steel and brass, including PTFE, PVC, nylon, bronze, and cast iron.

The taper on NPT threads allows them to form a seal when torqued as the flanks of the threads compress against each other, as opposed to parallel/straight thread fittings or compression fittings in which the threads merely hold the pieces together and do not provide a seal. The various types of pipe threads are designed for use both with or without thread sealants, as particular applications demand. The sealants, where used, are typically thread seal tape thread sealant or a thread seal paste pipe dope (sometimes similar in composition to plumber&#x27;s putty).

Because the thread body is tapered (), a larger diameter keeps compressing into a smaller diameter and finally forms a seal (no clearance remains between the crests and roots of the threads because of the taper). This means that NPT fittings should be burr-free and lubricated using a lubricant like lubricating paste or thread seal tape. The use of tape also helps to limit corrosion on the threads, which otherwise can make future disassembly nearly impossible.

Commonly used sizes are , , , , , 1, , , 2, , 3, , 4, 5, and 6 inch, as pipe and fittings by most US suppliers. Sizes smaller than  inch are occasionally used for compressed air, while sizes larger than 6 inches are often joined by other methods.

==Specifications==
NPT is defined by ANSI/ASME standard B1.20.1.

The taper rate for all NPT threads is 1 inch of diameter in 16 inches of length () measured by the change of diameter (of the pipe thread) over distance of thread. The half-angle (between the taper surface and the axis of the pipe) is arctan() ≈ 1.7899° ≈ 1° 47′.

The standard for Nominal Pipe Size (often abbreviated NPS, which should not be confused with the abbreviation NPS for the straight thread form standard) is loosely related to the inside diameter of Schedule 40 series of sizes. Because of the pipe wall thickness of Schedule pipe, the actual diameter of the NPT threads is larger than the Nominal Pipe Size diameter, and considerably so for small sizes. Pipe of a given size in a different Schedule than Schedule 40 provides a different wall thickness while maintaining the same outside diameter and thread profile as Schedule 40. Thus the inside diameter of a given size of Schedule pipe differs from the Nominal Pipe Size, while outside diameters for a given nominal Schedule size are the same between Schedules.

=== Thread form ===
National Pipe Thread series have the same 60° included angle as Sellers thread. On the other hand, for sealing capability, tapered (pressure-tight) threads have crest and root shapes that differ from Sellers. For example, the NPT has a crest width of 0.038 to 0.062 pitch, which is sharper than the 0.125 pitch of Sellers.
=== National pipe taper fuel (NPTF) ===
National Pipe Taper Fuel (NPTF, also called Dryseal American National Standard Taper Pipe Thread, defined by ASME B1.20.3) is designed to provide a more leak-free seal without the use of PTFE tape (often referred to by the popular brand name &quot;Teflon&quot;) or another sealant compound. NPTF threads have the same basic shape but with crest and root heights adjusted for an interference fit, eliminating the spiral leakage path.

== Standard sizes ==

==History==

In 1864, William Sellers, then president of Franklin Institute, presented a standard for nuts, bolts, and screws. Out of this effort came the first United States Standard threads, including pipe threads.

<doc id="832482" wikidata="Q105584" url="?curid=832482" title="Rotten Tomatoes">
<text>Rotten Tomatoes is an American review-aggregation website for film and television. The company was launched in August 1998 by three undergraduate students at the University of California, Berkeley: Senh Duong, Patrick Y. Lee, and Stephen Wang. Although the name &quot;Rotten Tomatoes&quot; connects to the practice of audiences throwing rotten tomatoes in disapproval of a poor stage performance, the direct inspiration for the name from Duong, Lee, and Wang came from an equivalent scene in the 1992 Canadian film &quot;Léolo&quot;.

Since January 2010, Rotten Tomatoes has been owned by Flixster, which was in turn acquired by Warner Bros. in 2011. In February 2016, Rotten Tomatoes and its parent site Flixster were sold to Comcast&#x27;s Fandango ticketing company. Warner Bros. retained a minority stake in the merged entities, including Fandango.

The site is influential among moviegoers, a third of whom say they consult it before going to the cinema in the U.S. It has been criticized for oversimplifying reviews by flattening them into a fresh vs. rotten dichotomy. It has also been criticized for being easy for studios to manipulate by limiting early screenings to critics inclined to be favorable, among other tactics.

==History==
Rotten Tomatoes was launched on August 12, 1998, as a spare-time project by Senh Duong. His objective in creating Rotten Tomatoes was &quot;to create a site where people can get access to reviews from a variety of critics in the U.S&quot;. As a fan of Jackie Chan, Duong was inspired to create the website after collecting all the reviews of Chan&#x27;s Hong Kong action movies as they were being released in the United States. The catalyst for the creation of the website was &quot;Rush Hour&quot; (1998), Chan&#x27;s first major Hollywood crossover, which was originally planned to release in August 1998. Duong coded the website in two weeks and the site went live the same month, but the release of &quot;Rush Hour&quot; was delayed until September 1998. Besides Jackie Chan films, he began including other films on Rotten Tomatoes, extending it beyond Chan&#x27;s fandom. The first non-Chan Hollywood movie whose reviews were featured on Rotten Tomatoes was &quot;Your Friends &amp; Neighbors&quot; (1998). The website was an immediate success, receiving mentions by Netscape, Yahoo!, and &quot;USA Today&quot; within the first week of its launch; it attracted &quot;600–1,000 daily unique visitors&quot; as a result.

Duong teamed up with University of California, Berkeley classmates Patrick Y. Lee and Stephen Wang, his former partners at the Berkeley, California-based web design firm Design Reactor, to pursue Rotten Tomatoes on a full-time basis. They officially launched it on April 1, 2000.

In June 2004, IGN Entertainment acquired Rotten Tomatoes for an undisclosed sum. In September 2005, IGN was bought by News Corp&#x27;s Fox Interactive Media. In January 2010, IGN sold the website to Flixster. The combined reach of both companies is 30 million unique visitors a month across all different platforms, according to the companies. In 2011, Warner Bros. acquired Rotten Tomatoes.

In early 2009, Current Television launched &quot;The Rotten Tomatoes Show&quot;, a televised version of the web review site. It was hosted by Brett Erlich and Ellen Fox and written by Mark Ganek. The show aired Thursdays at 10:30 EST until September 16, 2010. It returned as a much shorter segment of &quot;InfoMania&quot;, a satirical news show that ended in 2011.

By late 2009, the website was designed to enable Rotten Tomatoes users to create and join groups to discuss various aspects of film. One group, &quot;The Golden Oyster Awards&quot;, accepted votes of members for various awards, spoofing the better-known Academy Awards or Golden Globes. When Flixster bought the company, they disbanded the groups.

As of February 2011, new community features have been added and others removed. For example, users can no longer sort films by Fresh Ratings from Rotten Ratings, and vice versa.

On September 17, 2013, a section devoted to scripted television series, called TV Zone, was created as a subsection of the website.

In February 2016, Rotten Tomatoes and its parent site Flixster were sold to Comcast&#x27;s Fandango Media. Warner Bros retained a minority stake in the merged entities, including Fandango.

In December 2016, Fandango and all its various websites moved to Fox Interactive Media&#x27;s former headquarters in Beverly Hills, California.

In July 2017, the website&#x27;s editor-in-chief since 2007, Matt Atchity, left to join &quot;The Young Turks&quot; YouTube channel. On November 1, 2017, the site launched a new web series on Facebook, &quot;See It/Skip It&quot;, hosted by Jacqueline Coley and Segun Oduolowu.

In March 2018, the site announced its new design, icons and logo for the first time in 19 years at South by Southwest.

On May 19, 2020, Rotten Tomatoes won the 2020 Webby People&#x27;s Voice Award for Entertainment in the Web category.

In February 2021, the Rotten Tomatoes staff made an entry on their Product Blog, announcing several design changes to the site: Each film&#x27;s &#x27;Score Box&#x27; at the top of the page would now also include its release year, genre, and runtimes, with an MPAA rating to be soon added; the number of ratings would be shown in groupings – from 50+ up to 250,000+ ratings, for easier visualization. Links to critics and viewers are included underneath the ratings. By clicking on either the Tomatometer Score or the Audience Score, the users can access &quot;Score Details&quot; information, such as the number of Fresh and Rotten reviews, average rating, and Top Critics&#x27; score. The team also added a new &quot;What to Know&quot; section for each film entry page, which could combine the &quot;Critics Consensus&quot; blurb with a new &quot;Audience Says&quot; blurb, so users can see an at-a-glance summary of the sentiments of both certified critics and verified audience members.

==Features==
===Critics&#x27; aggregate score===
Rotten Tomatoes staff collect reviews from writers who are certified members of various writing guilds or film critic-associations. To be accepted as a critic on the website, a critic&#x27;s original reviews must garner a specific number of &quot;likes&quot; from users. Those classified as &quot;Top Critics&quot; generally write for major newspapers. The critics upload their reviews to the movie page on the website, and need to mark their review &quot;fresh&quot; if it is generally favorable or &quot;rotten&quot; otherwise. It is necessary for the critic to do so as some reviews are qualitative and do not grant a numeric score, making it impossible for the system to be automatic.

The website keeps track of all the reviews counted for each film and calculates the percentage of positive reviews (called the &quot;Tomatometer&quot;). If the positive reviews make up 60% or more, the film is considered &quot;fresh&quot;. If the positive reviews are less than 60%, the film is considered &quot;rotten&quot;. An average score on a 0 to 10 scale is also calculated. With each review, a short excerpt of the review is quoted that also serves a hyperlink to the complete review essay for anyone interested to read the critic&#x27;s full thoughts on the subject.

&quot;Top Critics&quot;, such as Roger Ebert, Desson Thomson, Stephen Hunter, Owen Gleiberman, Lisa Schwarzbaum, Peter Travers and Michael Phillips are identified in a sub-listing that calculates their reviews separately. Their opinions are also included in the general rating. When there are sufficient reviews, the staff creates and posts a consensus statement to express the general reasons for the collective opinion of the film.

This rating is indicated by an equivalent icon at the film listing, to give the reader a one-glance look at the general critical opinion about the work. The &quot;Certified Fresh&quot; seal is reserved for movies that satisfy two criteria: a Tomatometer of 75% or better and at least 80 reviews (40 for limited release movies) from Tomatometer critics (including 5 Top Critics). Films earning this status will keep it unless the positive critical percentage drops below 70%. Films with 100% positive ratings that lack the required number of reviews may not receive the &quot;Certified Fresh&quot; seal.

For a Tomatometer score to be displayed, a film must meet a minimum number of critic reviews. The threshold changes depending on the film&#x27;s projected box office in the United States, with the financial forecast provided by an &quot;independent outside source&quot;. For films projected to make more than $120 million, they must receive 40 critic reviews before they receive a Tomatometer score; for projections of $60 million or more, 20 reviews are required; and for projections of under $60 million, or for films lacking a projection, 10 reviews are required.

When a film or TV show reaches the requirements for the &quot;Certified Fresh&quot;, it is not automatically granted the seal; &quot;the Tomatometer score must be consistent and unlikely to deviate significantly&quot; before it is thus marked. Once certified, if a film&#x27;s score drops and remains consistently below 70%, it loses its Certified Fresh designation.

====Golden Tomato Awards====
In 2000, Rotten Tomatoes announced the RT Awards honoring the best-reviewed films of the year according to the website&#x27;s rating system. The awards were later renamed the Golden Tomato Awards. The nominees and winners are announced on the website, although there is no actual awards ceremony.

The films are divided into wide release and limited release categories. Limited releases are defined as opening in 599 or fewer theaters at initial release. Platform releases, movies initially released under 600 theaters but later receiving wider distribution, fall under this definition. Any film opening in more than 600 theaters is considered wide release. There are also two categories purely for British and Australian films. The &quot;User&quot;-category represents the highest rated film among users, and the &quot;Mouldy&quot;-award represents the worst-reviewed films of the year. A movie must have 40 (originally 20) or more rated reviews to be considered for domestic categories. It must have 500 or more user ratings to be considered for the &quot;User&quot;-category.

Films are further classified based on film genre. Each movie is eligible in only one genre, aside from non-English-language films, which can be included in both their genre and the respective &quot;Foreign&quot; category.

Once a film is considered eligible, its &quot;votes&quot; are counted. Each critic from the website&#x27;s list gets one vote (as determined by their review), all weighted equally. Because reviews are continually added, manually and otherwise, a cutoff date at which new reviews are not counted toward the Golden Tomato awards is initiated each year, usually the first of the new year. Reviews without ratings are not counted toward the results of the Golden Tomato Awards.

===Audience score and reviews===
Each movie features a &quot;user average&quot;, called the &quot;Popcornmeter&quot;, which calculates the percentage of registered users who have rated the film positively on a 5-star scale, similar to calculation of recognized critics&#x27; reviews.

For a Popcornmeter score to be displayed, a film must meet a minimum number of audience reviews. The threshold changes depending on the film&#x27;s projected box office in the United States. For films projected to make more than $120 million, they must receive 500 audience reviews before they receive a Popcornmeter score; for projections of $60 million or more, 300 reviews are required; for projections of $5 million or more, 100 reviews are required; and for projections of less than $5 million, or films lacking a projection, 50 reviews are required.

On May 24, 2019, Rotten Tomatoes introduced a verified rating system that would replace the earlier system where users were merely required to register to submit a rating. So, in addition to creating an account, users will have to verify their ticket purchase through ticketing company Fandango Media, parent company of Rotten Tomatoes. While users can still leave reviews without verifying, those reviews will not account for the average audience score displayed next to the Tomatometer.

On August 21, 2024, Rotten Tomatoes rebranded its audience score as the Popcornmeter and introduced a new &quot;Verified Hot&quot; badge. The designation is only given to films which have reached an audience score of 90 percent or higher among users whom Rotten Tomatoes has verified as having purchased a ticket to the film through Fandango. A representative for Rotten Tomatoes stated that their goal is to include other services in the future for users who do not use Fandango. Upon its creation, the &quot;Verified Hot&quot; badge was installed retroactively on over 200 films which achieved a verified audience score of 90% or higher since the launch of Rotten Tomatoes&#x27; verified audience ratings in May 2019.

===&quot;What to Know&quot;===

In February 2021, a new &quot;What to Know&quot; section was created for each film entry, combining the &quot;Critics Consensus&quot; and a new &quot;Audience Says&quot; blurbs within it, to give users an at-a-glance summary of the general sentiments of a film as experienced by critics and audiences. Prior to February 2021, only the &quot;Critics Consensus&quot; blurb was posted for each entry, after enough certified critics had submitted reviews. When the &quot;Audience Says&quot; blurbs were added, Rotten Tomatoes initially included them only for newer films and those with a significant audience rating, but suggested that they may later add them for older films as well.

==== &quot;Critics Consensus&quot; / &quot;Audience Says&quot; ====
Each movie features a brief blurb summary of the critics&#x27; reviews, called the &quot;Critical Consensus&quot;, used in that entry&#x27;s Tomatometer aggregate score. 

In February 2021, Rotten Tomatoes added an &quot;Audience Says&quot; section; similar to the &quot;Critics Consensus&quot;, it summarizes the reviews noted by registered users into a concise blurb. The Rotten Tomatoes staff noted that for any given film, if there were any external factors such as controversies or issues affecting the sentiments of a film, they may address it in the &quot;Audience Says&quot; section to give users the most relevant info regarding their viewing choices.

===Localized versions===
Localized versions of the site available in the United Kingdom, India, and Australia were discontinued following the acquisition of Rotten Tomatoes by Fandango. The Mexican version of the site, , remains active.

===API===
The Rotten Tomatoes API provides limited access to critic and audience ratings and reviews, allowing developers to incorporate Rotten Tomatoes data on other websites. The free service is intended for use in the US only; permission is required for use elsewhere. As of 2022, API access is restricted to approved developers that must go through an application process.

==Influence==
Major Hollywood studios have come to see Rotten Tomatoes as a potential threat to their marketing. In 2017, several blockbuster films like &quot;Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Men Tell No Tales&quot;, &quot;Baywatch&quot; and &quot;The Mummy&quot; were projected to open with gross receipts of $90 million, $50 million and $45 million, respectively, but ended up debuting with $62.6 million, $23.1 million and $31.6 million. Rotten Tomatoes, which scored the films at 30%, 19% and 16%, respectively, was blamed for undermining them. That same summer, films like &quot;Wonder Woman&quot; and &quot;Spider-Man: Homecoming&quot; (both 92%) received high scores and opened at or exceeded expectations with their $100+ million trackings.

As a result of this concern, 20th Century Fox commissioned a 2015 study, titled &quot;Rotten Tomatoes and Box Office&quot;, that stated the website combined with social media was going to be an increasingly serious complication for the film business: &quot;The power of Rotten Tomatoes and fast-breaking word of mouth will only get stronger. Many Millennials and even Gen X-ers now vet every purchase through the Internet, whether it&#x27;s restaurants, video games, make-up, consumer electronics or movies. As they get older and comprise an even larger share of total moviegoers, this behavior is unlikely to change&quot;. Other studios have commissioned a number of studies on the subject, with them finding that 7/10 people said they would be less interested in seeing a film if the Rotten Tomatoes score was below 25%, and that the site has the most influence on people 25 and younger.

The scores have reached a level of online ubiquity which film companies have found threatening. For instance, the scores are regularly posted in Google search results for films so reviewed. Furthermore, the scores are prominently featured in Fandango&#x27;s popular ticket purchasing website, on its mobile app, on popular streaming services like Peacock, and on Flixster, which led to complaints that &quot;rotten&quot; scores damaged films&#x27; performances.

Others have argued that filmmakers and studios have only themselves to blame if Rotten Tomatoes produces a bad score, as this only reflects a poor reception among film critics. As one independent film distributor marketing executive noted, &quot;To me, it&#x27;s a ridiculous argument that Rotten Tomatoes is the problem ... make a good movie!&quot;. ComScore&#x27;s Paul Dergarabedian had similar comments, saying: &quot;The best way for studios to combat the &#x27;Rotten Tomatoes Effect&#x27; is to make better movies, plain and simple&quot;.

Some studios have suggested embargoing or cancelling early critic screenings in a response to poor reviews prior to a film&#x27;s release affecting pre-sales and opening weekend numbers. In July 2017, Sony embargoed critic reviews for &quot;The Emoji Movie&quot; until mid-day the Thursday before its release. The film ended up with a 9% rating (including 0% after the first 25 reviews), but still opened to $24 million, on par with projections. Josh Greenstein, Sony Pictures President of Worldwide Marketing and Distribution, said, &quot;&quot;The Emoji Movie&quot; was built for people under 18 ... so we wanted to give the movie its best chance. What other wide release with a score under 8 percent has opened north of $20 million? I don&#x27;t think there is one&quot;. Conversely, Warner Bros. also did not do critic pre-screenings for &quot;The House&quot;, which held a score of 16% until the day of its release, and opened to just $8.7 million; the lowest of star Will Ferrell&#x27;s career.

That marketing tactic can backfire, and drew the vocal disgust of influential critics such as Roger Ebert, who was prone to derisively condemn such moves, with gestures such as &quot;The Wagging Finger of Shame&quot;, on &quot;At the Movies&quot;. Furthermore, the very nature of withholding reviews can draw early conclusions from the public that the film is of poor quality because of that marketing tactic.

On February 26, 2019, in response to issues surrounding coordinated &quot;bombing&quot; of user reviews for several films, most notably &quot;Captain Marvel&quot; and &quot;Star Wars: The Rise of Skywalker&quot;, prior to their release, the site announced that user reviews would no longer be accepted until a film is publicly released. The site also announced plans to introduce a system for &quot;verified&quot; reviews, and that the &quot;Want to See&quot; statistic would now be expressed as a number so that it would not be confused with the audience score.

Despite arguments on how Rotten Tomatoes scores impact the box office, academic researchers so far have not found evidence that Rotten Tomatoes ratings affect box office performance.

In April 2024, &quot;The Hollywood Reporter&quot; reported that directors&#x27; past Rotten Tomatoes scores are brought up by producers in pitch meetings. One director representative said, &quot;Critical acclaim is now gamified. The Rotten Tomatoes score is the first thing people look at when I go pitch a director. It inevitably affects decision-making around hiring a director.&quot;

==Criticism==
===Oversimplification===
In January 2010, on the occasion of the 75th anniversary of the New York Film Critics Circle, its chairman Armond White cited Rotten Tomatoes in particular and film review aggregators in general as examples of how &quot;the Internet takes revenge on individual expression&quot;. He said they work by &quot;dumping reviewers onto one website and assigning spurious percentage-enthusiasm points to the discrete reviews&quot;. According to White, such websites &quot;offer consensus as a substitute for assessment&quot;. Landon Palmer, a film and media historian and an assistant professor in the Department of Journalism and Creative Media director in the College of Communication and Information Sciences at the University of Alabama agreed with White, stating that &quot;[Rotten Tomatoes applies a] problematic algorithm to pretty much all avenues of modern media art and entertainment&quot;.

Director and producer Brett Ratner has criticized the website for &quot;reducing hundreds of reviews culled from print and online sources into a popularized aggregate score&quot;, while expressing respect for traditional film critics. Writer Max Landis, following his film &quot;Victor Frankenstein&quot; receiving an approval rating of 24% on the site, wrote that the site &quot;breaks down entire reviews into just the word &#x27;yes&#x27; or &#x27;no&#x27;, making criticism binary in a destructive arbitrary way&quot;.

=== Review manipulation ===
&quot;Vulture&quot; ran an article in September 2023 that raised several criticisms of Rotten Tomatoes&#x27;s system, including the ease at which large companies are able to manipulate reviewer ratings. The article cited publicity company Bunker 15 as an example of how scores can be boosted by recruiting obscure, often self-published reviewers, using the example of 2018&#x27;s &quot;Ophelia&quot;.

Rotten Tomatoes responded by delisting several Bunker 15 films, including &quot;Ophelia&quot;. It told &quot;Vulture&quot; in a statement, &quot;We take the integrity of our scores seriously and do not tolerate any attempts to manipulate them. We have a dedicated team who monitors our platforms regularly and thoroughly investigates and resolves any suspicious activity.&quot;

&quot;WIRED&quot; published an article in February 2024 written by Christopher Null, a former film critic, that argued such methods are standard activities performed by all PR agencies. In particular, Null points out that sponsoring legitimate, honest reviews has a long history in other industries and is a &quot;common tactic employed by indie titles to get visibility&quot;.

===Other criticisms===
American director Martin Scorsese wrote a column in &quot;The Hollywood Reporter&quot; criticizing both Rotten Tomatoes and CinemaScore for promoting the idea that films like &quot;Mother!&quot; had to be &quot;instantly liked&quot; to be successful. Scorsese, in a dedication for the Roger Ebert Center for Film Studies at the University of Illinois later continued his criticism, voicing that Rotten Tomatoes and other review services &quot;devalue cinema on streaming platforms to the level of content&quot;.

In 2015, while promoting the film &quot;Suffragette&quot; (which has a 73% approval rating) actress Meryl Streep accused Rotten Tomatoes of disproportionately representing the opinions of male film critics, resulting in a skewed ratio that adversely affected the commercial performances of female-driven films. &quot;I submit to you that men and women are not the same, they like different things,&quot; she said. &quot;Sometimes they like the same thing, but sometimes their tastes diverge. If the Tomatometer is slighted so completely to one set of tastes that drives box office in the United States, absolutely&quot;. Critics took issue with the sentiment that someone&#x27;s gender or ethnic background would dictate their response to art.

Rotten Tomatoes deliberately withheld the critic score for &quot;Justice League&quot; based on early reviews until the premiere of its &quot;See It/Skip It&quot; episode on the Thursday before its release. Some critics viewed the move as a ploy to promote the web series, but some argued that the move was a deliberate conflict of interest on account of Warner Bros.&#x27; ownership of the film and Rotten Tomatoes, and the tepid critical reception of the DC Extended Universe films at the time.

&quot;The New York Times&quot; aggregated statistics on the critical reception of audience scores versus critic scores, and noticed in almost every genre that &quot;The public rates a movie more positively than do the critics. The only exceptions are black comedies and documentaries. Critics systematically rate films in these genres more highly than do Rotten Tomatoes users&quot;. &quot;Slate&quot; magazine collected data in a similar survey that revealed a noticeable favor for movies released before the 1990s, that &quot;may be explained by a bias toward reviewers reviewing, or Rotten Tomatoes scoring, only the best movies from bygone eras&quot;.

<text>Radio Free Asia (RFA) is a news service that publishes online news, information, commentary and broadcasts radio programs for its audiences in Asia. The service, which provides editorially independent reporting, has the stated mission of providing accurate and uncensored reporting to countries in Asia that have poor media environments and limited protections for speech and press freedom. 

RFA is American government-funded, operates as a non-profit corporation, headquartered in Washington, D.C, with news bureaus and journalists in Asia, Europe, and Australia.

RFA was established by the US International Broadcasting Act of 1994 with the stated aim of &quot;promoting democratic values and human rights&quot;, and countering the narratives and monopoly on information distribution of the Chinese Communist Party, as well as providing media reports about the North Korean government. It is funded and supervised by the U.S. Agency for Global Media (formerly Broadcasting Board of Governors), an independent agency of the United States government.

RFA digitally publishes news articles, photos, videos, and podcasts on its website and social media channels including Facebook, YouTube, Instagram, X in ten Asian languages for audiences in Mainland China, Hong Kong, North Korea, Laos, Cambodia, Vietnam and Myanmar.

==History==

After the 1989 Tiananmen Square protests and massacre, a bipartisan group of senators and congressmen led by Jesse Helms and Joe Biden came together and sponsored legislation to create Radio Free Asia. Republican House Speaker Newt Gingrich supported Radio Free Asia as a means to press China on human rights. The International Broadcasting Act was passed by the Congress of the United States and signed by President Bill Clinton in 1994, officially establishing Radio Free Asia.

Radio Free Asia was incorporated in March 1996, and began broadcasting in September 1996. Although RFA directors preferred to broadcast under the name &quot;the Asia-Pacific Network&quot;, Republican representatives including Chris Smith and Jesse Helms insisted on returning the name to Radio Free Asia before broadcasting began, to which president Richard Richter complied. Radio Free Asia was forced to change the name in part due to financial pressures from the US government, for although they operated with an independent board, their initial $10 million dollar annual budget came from the Treasury.

In 1997, the then US Deputy Secretary of State, Strobe Talbott, began talks with the government of Australia to purchase abandoned transmission facilities near Darwin, Northern Territory for the purpose of expanding RFA&#x27;s signal to overcome jamming. Richter personally lobbied in Canberra to support this effort. Although the Australian Government intended to sell the facilities to a foreign broadcaster, preference was given to the BBC over the fledgling RFA due to fears that such a sale would anger China, with Australian Minister for Foreign Affairs Alexander Downer stating, &quot;we are certainly not in the game of provocatively damaging our relations with China.&quot;

In response to radio jamming efforts from China, Newt Gingrich and House Republican leaders helped to increase the budget of RFA and VOA, with further funding of RFA proposed as a way to combat China&#x27;s political repression without levying trade restrictions that would anger American businesses.

With the passage of the International Broadcasting Act in 1994, RFA was brought under auspices of the United States Information Agency where it remained until the agency&#x27;s cessation of broadcasting duties and transitioned to U.S. Department of State operated Broadcasting Board of Governors in 1999. In September 2009, the 111th Congress amended the International Broadcasting Act to allow a one-year extension of the operation of Radio Free Asia.

On June 25, 2010, the US Senate unanimously approved Republican Senator Richard Lugar&#x27;s legislation to promote the free dissemination of information in East Asia through the permanent authorization of RFA. The House of Representatives passed Lugar&#x27;s bill S.3104 to grant Radio Free Asia permanent Congressional authorization on June 30 and it was signed into law on July 13, 2010.

RFA broadcasts in nine languages, via shortwave, satellite transmissions, medium-wave (AM and FM radio). 

The first transmission was in Mandarin Chinese and it is RFA&#x27;s most broadcast language at twelve hours per day. RFA also broadcasts in Cantonese, Tibetan (Kham, Amdo, and Uke dialects), Uyghur, Burmese, Vietnamese, Lao, Khmer (to Cambodia) and Korean (to North Korea). The Korean service launched in 1997 with Jaehoon Ahn as its founding director. Broadcasts in Khmer to Cambodia that began under the country&#x27;s communist regime continue despite the country no longer being communist. In 2017, RFA and other networks, such as Voice of America, were put under the then newly created U.S. Agency for Global Media that also sends representatives to its board of directors.

In January 2022, RFA announced that it had appointed Carolyn Bartholomew as the new chair of its board of directors. As of December 2023, its board members include: Michael J. Green, Michael Kempner, Keith Richburg, Shanthi Kalathil, and Allison Hooker. RFA receives its funding through annual budget allocations from the U.S. Agency for Global Media.

In March 2024, RFA announced the closure of its Hong Kong bureau, citing journalist safety concerns from Hong Kong&#x27;s enactment of the Safeguarding National Security Ordinance.

===Radio jamming and Internet blocking===

Since broadcasting began in 1996, Chinese authorities have consistently jammed RFA broadcasts.

Three RFA reporters were denied access to China to cover U.S. President Bill Clinton&#x27;s visit in June 1998. The Chinese embassy in Washington had initially granted visas to the three but revoked them shortly before President Clinton left Washington en route to Beijing. The White House and United States Department of State filed complaints with Chinese authorities over the matter but the reporters ultimately did not make the trip.

The Vietnamese-language broadcast signal was also jammed by the Vietnamese government from the beginning. Human rights legislation has been proposed in Congress that would allocate money to counter the jamming. Research by the OpenNet Initiative, a project that monitors Internet filtering by governments worldwide, showed that the Vietnamese-language portion of the Radio Free Asia website was blocked by both of the tested ISPs in Vietnam, while the English-language portion was blocked by one of the two ISPs.

To address radio jamming and Internet blocking by the governments of the countries that it broadcasts to, the RFA website contains instruction on how to create anti-jamming antennas and information on web proxies.

On March 30, 2010, China&#x27;s domestic internet censor, known as the Great Firewall, temporarily blocked all Google searches in China, due to an unintentional association with the long-censored term &quot;rfa&quot;. According to Google, the letters, associated with Radio Free Asia, were appearing in the URLs of all Google searches, thereby triggering China&#x27;s filter to block search results.

===Arrests of Uyghur journalists&#x27; relatives===

In 2014–2015 China arrested three brothers of RFA Uyghur Service journalist Shohret Hoshur. Their jailing was widely described by Western publishers as Chinese authorities&#x27; efforts to target Hoshur for his reports on otherwise unreported violent events of the Xinjiang conflict. Much larger numbers of relatives of RFA&#x27;s Uyghur-language staff have since been detained, including the family of Gulchehra Hoja.

RFA is the only station outside China that broadcasts in the Uyghur language. It has been recognized by journalists of &quot;The Atlantic&quot;, &quot;The Washington Post&quot;, &quot;The New York Times&quot;, and &quot;The Economist&quot; for playing a role in exposing Xinjiang internment camps. In particular, &quot;The New York Times&quot; regards certain RFA articles as part of the few reliable sources of information about Xinjiang.

==== Xinjiang internment camps ====
In 2018, after RFA journalist Hoja published an interview with an individual who had been detained in the Xinjiang internment camps, Chinese authorities detained approximately two dozen of Hoja&#x27;s relatives. Later that year, Chinese authorities forcibly disappeared two brothers and five cousins of an editor for RFA&#x27;s Uyghur language service.

&quot;National Review&quot; has reported that as of 2021, eight of Radio Free Asia&#x27;s fifteen staff of Uyghur ethnicity have family members who are detained in the Xinjiang internment camps.

==Mission==
Radio Free Asia&#x27;s functions, as listed in , are to:
# provide accurate and timely information, news, and commentary about events in Asia and elsewhere; and
# be a forum for a variety of opinions and voices from within Asian nations whose people do not fully enjoy freedom of expression.

Additionally, the International Broadcasting Act of 1994 (Title III of ), which authorized the creation of the RFA, contains the following paragraph:

According to a Congressional Research Service report titled &quot;U.S. International Broadcasting: Background and Issues for Reform&quot; updated on December 15, 2016:RFA’s target audiences are mandated by legislation and include countries in Asia where governments prohibit access to a free press, specifically the People’s Republic of China and its regions of Tibet and Xinjiang, Burma, Cambodia, Laos, North Korea and Vietnam. RFA was authorized as a nonfederal, private nonprofit corporation that would operate under a BBG grant, much like RFE/RL. The RFA&#x27;s mission statement is outlined on its website as follows:

==Reception==

In 1999, Catharin Dalpino of the Brookings Institution, a former assistant secretary deputy for human rights, called Radio Free Asia &quot;a waste of money&quot; and elaborated that she believed its goals had more to do with domestic political symbolism than with supporting democratic movements in Asia, stating that &quot;Wherever we feel there is an ideological enemy, we&#x27;re going to have a Radio Free Something.&quot; Dalpino said she had reviewed scripts of RFA&#x27;s broadcasts and viewed the station&#x27;s reporting as unbalanced due to focus on the testimony of dissidents in exile rather than the events occurring in the countries themselves. Lynne Weil, a director of communications and external affairs for the U.S. Agency for Global Media, has disputed descriptions of government-funded outlets as propaganda, referring to outlets such as BBC as examples of non-propagandist journalism funded by a government entity. In 2001, Richter stated that congressional interference in the organization was minimal, saying that he &quot;wanted to make sure we weren&#x27;t just getting set up to be a kill-the-Commie organization.&quot;

Monroe Price, director of the Center for Global Communication Studies, described RFA as &quot;a modern iteration of Cold War use of the airwaves, emphasizing a turn from the traditional Cold War targets to new ones&quot; and argued that the goals of RFA prove that the &quot;instruments of international broadcasting are a reflection of the priorities and internal politics of the sending nation.&quot;

Vietnamese newspapers such as the state-run &quot;Nhân Dân&quot; have criticized the goals of RFA and broadcasts into the country, with a writer for &quot;Nhân Dân&quot; accusing the network of attempting to &quot;interfere in other countries&#x27; internal affairs.&quot;

Chinese citizens calling in to RFA have expressed a wide range of opinions on the network, both positive and negative, many calling from pay phones to hide their identities.

== Controversies and disputes ==
In early November 2012, Ngabo Jigme, director of the Tibetan language department of Radio Free Asia (RFA), was suddenly fired. It is said that the reason why Ngapoi Jigme was fired by RFA was that he allowed the Tibetan language department to express &quot;opposition to the Tibetan government-in-exile&quot; and because Ngapoi Jigme was &quot;disrespectful&quot; to the 14th Dalai Lama. This caused dissatisfaction with the Tibetan government-in-exile; RFA was pressured to fire Ngabo Jigme. Although the Tibetan government-in-exile and RFA denied it, the incident was still questioned by many parties. RFA&#x27;s long-term consultant Maura Moynihan called it a &quot;scandal&quot; and Tibetan writer An Leye Calling this a &quot;farce&quot;, American Tibetologist Elliot Sperling said &quot;there are several assertions that the political conspiracy of exiled government leaders to put pressure on the RFA was the main reason for Ngabo Jigme&#x27;s dismissal&quot;.

On May 10, 2020, RFA published a news article titled &quot;China Border Inspection Strengthens Inspection of Entry and Exit Nationals, International Students Had Their Passports Cut,&quot; which contained a screenshot of a Reddit post by a user who said his passport had been clipped by China&#x27;s border inspections. However, it was later revealed that the user&#x27;s attached picture was stolen from someone else. The news triggered criticism from mainland Chinese media, saying that the facts stated in the news were inconsistent with the situation.

On 11 May 2021, Fact-checker First Draft News found that Chinese- and Cantonese-language versions of Radio Free Asia (RFA) published anti-vaccine misinformation regarding the Chinese vaccines, particularly the ones manufactured by Sinopharm and Sinovac. The investigation found the RFA articles amplified misleading claims about the vaccine programs, and its stories were reprinted by popular tabloid newspapers to reinforce the anti-vaccine misinformation. The RFA site did not cover suspected adverse events related to Western-made vaccines. Wen-Ying Sylvia Chou, program director at the National Cancer Institute, believed these articles caused vaccine hesitancy and global public health risks. Masato Kajimoto, a misinformation expert and journalism professor at the University of Hong Kong, suggested the articles were biased toward anti-Beijing messages and repeated unsubstantiated claims made by unreliable sources, such as &quot;The Epoch Times&quot;.

<text>Château d&#x27;Yquem () is a &quot;Premier Cru Supérieur&quot; (Fr: &quot;Superior First Growth&quot;) wine from the Sauternes, Gironde region in the southern part of the Bordeaux vineyards known as Graves. In the Bordeaux Wine Official Classification of 1855, Château d&#x27;Yquem was the only Sauternes given this rating, indicating its perceived superiority and higher prices over all other wines of its type. Yquem&#x27;s success stems largely from the site&#x27;s susceptibility to attack by &quot;noble rot&quot; (a particular kind of infestation by &quot;Botrytis cinerea&quot;).

Wines from Château d&#x27;Yquem are characterised by their complexity, concentration and sweetness, which is balanced by relatively high acidity. With proper care, a bottle will keep for a century or more, and the fruity overtones will gradually fade and integrate with more complex secondary and tertiary flavours.

Since 1959, Château d&#x27;Yquem has also produced a dry white wine called &quot;Ygrec&quot; (the name of the letter &quot;Y&quot; in French), made predominantly from Sauvignon blanc and a few lots of Sémillon. It was originally produced only in select years; since 2004 it has been produced every year.

== History ==
Chateau d&#x27;Yquem was acquired by Jacques de Sauvage in December 1593. De Sauvage acquired the property from the French monarchy by exchanging other lands that he owned for what was then referred to as the &#x27;House of Yquem&#x27;. The site has been home to a vineyard since at least 1711 when the estate became fully owned by Léon de Sauvage d&#x27;Yquem. In 1785 it passed to the Lur-Saluces family when Françoise-Joséphine de Sauvage d&#x27;Yquem married Count Louis-Amédée de Lur-Saluces, a godson of Louis XV and Lady Victoire de France. Monsieur Lur-Saluces died three years later, and his wife subsequently focused her energy on sustaining and improving the estate.

While Minister Plenipotentiary to France, Thomas Jefferson visited the château and later wrote, &quot;Sauterne.[sic] This is the best white wine of France and the best of it is made by Monsieur de Lur-Saluces.&quot; Jefferson ordered 250 bottles of the 1784 vintage for himself, and additional bottles for George Washington. However, at that time the technique of allowing noble rot to infect grapes had not yet been discovered, so the wine Jefferson was drinking was a different and less sweet wine.

The 1811 Château d&#x27;Yquem, a comet vintage, has exhibited what wine experts like Robert Parker have described as exceptional longevity with Parker scoring the wine a perfect 100 points when tasted in 1996.

===Since 1968===

After the 1968 death of the Marquis Bernard de Lur-Saluces, the château was run by Comte Alexandre de Lur-Saluces, a minority (7%) owner. The Comte inherited a typical annual production of 66,000 bottles a year. After the 1973 oil crisis, demand fell and prices plummeted. The price of a bottle of d&#x27;Yquem dropped to 35 francs; prices began to rise only in the 1980s.
Under the Comte&#x27;s leadership, &quot;tractors replaced horses, collapsing cellars were renovated, and unused acreage was planted&quot;, with production in good years reaching 100,000 bottles and sales about $10 million.

Following a bitter family feud and the decision of Eugene de Lur-Saluces (Alexandre&#x27;s other brother) to sell part of his 47% share of the business, on 28 November 1996, to the French luxury goods giant LVMH Moët Hennessy – Louis Vuitton bought 55% of Château d&#x27;Yquem from the family of the Comte Alexandre de Lur-Saluces for about $100 million. The Comte, after first challenging the sale in court for over two years, was kept as the manager of the estate.

On 17 May 2004, the Comte retired and was replaced by the current managing director of Château Cheval Blanc, Pierre Lurton. The Comte had been known for being particularly dedicated towards maintaining quality, going so far as to reject an entire batch of the wine if he did not like the results of a randomised testing.

In 2006, a 135-year vertical (containing every vintage from 1860 to 2003) was sold by The Antique Wine Company in London for $1.5 million, one of the highest prices ever paid for a single lot of wine. Also that year, Dior and Château d&#x27;Yquem together created a skin care product made from the sap of the Yquem vines.

In July 2011, an 1811 bottle of Château d&#x27;Yquem sold for £75,000 ($117,000) at The Ritz Hotel, London to a private collector, Christian Vannequé, to become the most expensive bottle of white wine ever sold.

== Production ==

The vineyard has in the Sauternes appellation, though only are in production at any time. Each year, vines from two to three hectares are grubbed up and left fallow for a year. Since grapes from newly planted vines are not worthy of the chateau name for five to seven years, about 20 hectares are held in reserve each year. The vines consist of 80% Sémillon and 20% Sauvignon blanc, though the latter&#x27;s vigour implies the proportions are more nearly equal in the final wine.

Harvesting is carefully timed, and on average six tries through the vineyard are undertaken each year to ensure that only the botrytized grapes are selected. The yield averages nine hectolitres per hectare (2.5 acres), compared to the usual twelve to twenty hectolitres per hectare in Sauternes. The grapes are pressed three times and transferred to oak barrels for maturation over a period of about three years.

On average, 65,000 bottles are produced each year. In a poor vintage, the entire crop is deemed unworthy of bearing the Château&#x27;s name and sold anonymously; this happened nine times in the 20th century: 1910, 1915, 1930, 1951, 1952, 1964, 1972, 1974, and 1992 and in the 21st century one time: 2012.

<text>Hampstead is a London Underground station in Hampstead, North London, England. It is on the Edgware branch of the Northern line, between Golders Green and Belsize Park stations. The branch&#x27;s northernmost subterranean station, it is on the boundary between Travelcard Zone 2 and Zone 3.

Designed by architect Leslie Green, it was opened on 22 June 1907 by the Charing Cross, Euston &amp; Hampstead Railway. As it is at the junction of Heath Street and Hampstead High Street, the name Heath Street was proposed before opening, and the original tiled signs on the platform walls still read Heath Street. Because Hampstead is on a steep hill, the station&#x27;s platforms are the deepest on the London Underground network, at below ground level; and it has the deepest lift shaft on the Underground, at . Its high-speed lifts, originally manufactured by Otis, were modernised by the Wadsworth Lift Company, and again in 2014 by Accord.

To the north, between Hampstead and Golders Green stations, is the uncompleted North End or Bull &amp; Bush station. London Overground&#x27;s Hampstead Heath station on the North London line is a 10–15 minute walk east on South End Road.
==Connections==
London Buses routes 46 and 268, schools service 603 and night bus N5 serve the station.

<doc id="832501" wikidata="Q5036916" url="?curid=832501" title="Captiva (album)">
<text>Captiva is the third studio album from Christian rock band Falling Up, released on October 2, 2007. The band recorded the album with Seattle producer Aaron Sprinkle, who also handled the production duties for the band&#x27;s debut, &quot;Crashings&quot;.

As opposed to the band&#x27;s first two albums, &quot;Crashings&quot; and &quot;Dawn Escapes&quot;, &quot;Captiva&quot; is more alternative and experimental rock driven as a whole, similar to some elements that were present on &quot;Dawn Escapes&quot;, but much less hard rock-driven, and continues to show a change in the band&#x27;s musical direction. It also features much less distorted guitar rhythms, and nearly all turntable effects present on previous albums are omitted. It is the final album to feature keyboardist Adam Taylor and only album with guitarist Micah Sannan, who would both depart from the group shortly before the album&#x27;s release.

&quot;Hotel Aquarium&quot; was the album&#x27;s first single. &quot;Goodnight Gravity&quot;, &quot;How They Made Cameras&quot;, &quot;A Guide to Marine Life&quot;, and &quot;Maps&quot; have also been posted on the band&#x27;s PureVolume page. The album reached the &quot;Billboard&quot; Top Christian albums chart peaking at No. 19 and reached the Top Heatseekers albums chart peaking at No. 7. It has sold just over 20,000 copies worldwide.

<doc id="832508" wikidata="Q2981120" url="?curid=832508" title="Coast Guard Distinguished Service Medal">
<text>The Coast Guard Distinguished Service Medal (CGDSM) is a military decoration of the United States Coast Guard that was established 4 August 1949 and is presented to coast guardsmen for &quot;Exceptionally meritorious service to the government in a duty of great responsibility.&quot; Prior to this date, members of the Coast Guard were eligible to receive the Navy Distinguished Service Medal. The Homeland Security Distinguished Service Medal, which replaced the Transportation Distinguished Service Medal in 2002, is another higher precedence Distinguished Service Medal that may be awarded to coast guardsmen. The Coast Guard Distinguished Service Medal is equivalent to the Army&#x27;s Army Distinguished Service Medal, Naval Service&#x27;s Navy Distinguished Service Medal, and the Air and Space Forces&#x27; Air Force Distinguished Service Medal.

==Criteria==
The Coast Guard Distinguished Service Medal is awarded to coast guardsmen who distinguish themselves by exceptionally meritorious service to the United States Government in a duty of great responsibility. The medal may also be awarded to members of the uniformed services of the United States who distinguish themselves while working with the U.S. Coast Guard. The exceptional performance of duty must be clearly above what is normally expected and must have contributed materially to the success of a major command or project. The decoration is typically awarded to senior flag officers, such as the commandant of the Coast Guard. However, this does not preclude the award of the medal to any person who meets the eligibility requirements.

The bestowing authority of the Coast Guard Distinguished Service Medal is the secretary of homeland security. Prior to 2003, the award was authorized by the secretary of transportation, and prior to 1967, it was authorized by the secretary of the treasury.

===Devices===
Additional awards of the CGDSM are denoted by inch gold stars.

==Notable recipients==
*Admiral Jonathan Greenert - Chief of Naval Operations
*Admiral Alfred C. Richmond, first recipient of the medal, 1961
*General Richard Myers, Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff
*General Peter Pace, Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, 2005
*General Norman Schwarzkopf Jr., Commander of Operation Desert Storm, 1991
*General Eric Shinseki US Army Chief of Staff
*General Colin Powell Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff
*Master Chief Petty Officer of the Coast Guard Rick Trent, first enlisted recipient of the medal, 1998
*Master Chief Petty Officer of the Coast Guard Vincent W. Patton III
*Master Chief Petty Officer of the Coast Guard Frank A. Welch
*Master Chief Petty Officer of the Coast Guard Charles W. Bowen

<text>The Ohio Senate is the upper house of the Ohio General Assembly. The State Senate, which meets in the Ohio Statehouse in Columbus, first convened in 1803. Senators are elected for four year terms, staggered every two years such that half of the seats are contested at each election. Even numbered seats and odd numbered seats are contested in separate election years. The president of the Ohio Senate presides over the body when in session, and is currently Rob McColley.

Currently, the Senate consists of 24 Republicans and 9 Democrats, with the Republicans controlling two more seats than the 22 required for a supermajority vote. Senators are limited to two consecutive terms. Each senator represents approximately 349,000 Ohioans, and each Senate district encompasses three corresponding Ohio House of Representatives districts.

<text>Blackwall is a Docklands Light Railway (DLR) station in Blackwall, London, England. It is located very close to the northern entrance to the Blackwall road tunnel under the River Thames. The station is on the Beckton branch of the DLR between Poplar and East India stations.

The DLR station opened, with the Beckton Branch, on 28 March 1994. There was a previous station very close to this site, called Poplar station, which was served by the London and Blackwall Railway from 6 July 1840 to 3 May 1926. Poplar station was along the route of Aspen Way just to the south and east of the DLR station. Blackwall station on the London and Blackwall Railway was actually farther east, on what is today Jamestown Way. A crossover west of the station allows trains from Beckton and Poplar to reverse here.

==Services==
The typical off-peak service in trains per hour from Blackwall is:
* 6 tph to Tower Gateway
* 6 tph to Bank
* 6 tph to Beckton
* 6 tph to 

Additional services call at the station during the peak hours, increasing the service to up to 16 tph in each direction.

<text>Christopher Pearse Cranch (March 8, 1813 – January 20, 1892) was an American writer and artist often associated with Transcendentalism and the Hudson River School.

==Biography==
Cranch was born March 8, 1813, in Alexandria, Virginia. His conservative father, William Cranch, was Chief Judge of the United States Circuit Court of the District of Columbia. Cranch was the youngest of 13 siblings, including his brother John who would go on to become a painter. 

He graduated from Columbian College (now George Washington University) in 1835 before attending Harvard Divinity School and becoming a licensed preacher. During his years at Harvard, he came in contact with people like John Sullivan Dwight and Theodore Parker, through whom he was introduced to Unitarianism. He traveled as a Unitarian minister, preaching in Providence, Andover, Richmond, Bangor, Portland, Boston, Washington, and St. Louis. Later, he pursued various occupations: a magazine editor, caricaturist, children&#x27;s fantasy writer (the &quot;Huggermugger&quot; books), poet (&quot;The Bird and the Bell with Other Poems&quot; in 1875), translator, and landscape painter. He married Elizabeth DeWindt in 1843. His daughter, Caroline Cranch, was a painter.

Though not one of its founding members, Cranch became associated with the Transcendental Club; he read Ralph Waldo Emerson&#x27;s &quot;Nature&quot; by December 1836 and beginning in June 1837 served as a substitute editor of the &quot;Western Messenger&quot; in the absence of James Freeman Clarke. For that journal, Cranch reviewed Emerson&#x27;s Phi Beta Kappa address at Harvard in August 1837 known as &quot;The American Scholar&quot;. He referred to the speech as &quot;so full of beauties, full of original thought and illustration&quot; and its author as &quot;the man of genius, the bold deep thinker, and the concise original writer&quot;.
Cranch&#x27;s connection with the Transcendentalists ultimately diminished his demand as a minister. He soon became disillusioned with his harsh experiences in the west and returned to Boston in 1839.

His poetry was published in &quot;The Harbinger&quot; and &quot;The Dial&quot; among other publications. He sent &quot;Enosis&quot;, which Hazen Carpenter noted as perhaps Cranch&#x27;s most well-known poem, to Emerson for &quot;The Dial&quot; on March 2, 1840.
Cranch left the ministry to focus on a career in the arts and spent about 20 years in Italy and France studying and practicing painting. As an artist, Cranch painted landscapes similar to the work of Thomas Cole, the Hudson River School, and the Barbizon school in France. In one foray into historical painting, Cranch depicted the burning of P. T. Barnum&#x27;s American Museum in New York City. Later in life, Cranch painted scenes from Venice and Italy. Cranch&#x27;s caricatures of Emerson were later bound as &quot;Illustrations of the New Philosophy: Guide&quot;. Perhaps his most well-remembered and recognized artwork is a hand-drawn caricature illustrating Emerson&#x27;s concept of the &quot;transparent eyeball&quot;. In 1850, he was elected into the National Academy of Design as an Associate Academician, and became a full Academician in 1864.

In 1863, Cranch returned to the United States with his family, including his wife Elizabeth De Windt. Their son George enlisted in the Union Army during the Civil War and was killed shortly thereafter. Cranch spent the last couple decades of his life in Cambridge, Massachusetts, and contributed to publications like &quot;Harper&#x27;s&quot;, &quot;The Atlantic&quot;, &quot;Putnam&#x27;s&quot;, and &quot;Lippincott&#x27;s&quot; as well as publishing three books of poetry. He died at his home in Cambridge on January 20, 1892, and was buried at Mount Auburn Cemetery in Massachusetts.

<text>Tampere United is a Finnish football club from the city of Tampere. In the 2025 season, the club plays in Ykkönen, the third highest level of football in Finland.

The club had a team in Veikkausliiga, the premier football league in Finland, until the end of the 2010 season. It was excluded from participating in Finnish football during the 2011 season amid suspicions of money laundering. The club was kept alive by its supporters, who entered a team called TamU-K in Kutonen, the lowest level of football in Finland, in 2012. The club earned three promotions in four years, and all its teams were taken over by Tampere United in the lead up to the 2016 season. Tampere United is now a fan-owned club and controlled by the same supporters who ran TamU-K.

==History==
The club was formed in July 1998. The initial plan was to merge two local football clubs FC Ilves and TPV but TPV decided to continue as its own team. FC Ilves continued to play in lower divisions and Tampere United inherited its place in the second highest division.

In their first season, 1999 they won promotion to the top division, 15 months after the formation of the club. During season 2000 they reached sixth place in the league. In their third season 2001 they won the Finnish championship.

In 2002, they finished in fifth place, and in 2003, third place. In 2006, Tampere United won their 2nd Finnish Championship and one year later, in 2007, they were the champions yet again taking home their 3rd title.

During the 2007 season, Tampere United also reached the third qualifying round of the UEFA Champions League. Tampere defeated Bulgarian champions Levski Sofia 2–0 on aggregate in the second qualifying round. Tampere United failed to reach the Champions League group stage when Rosenborg BK defeated them 5–0 on aggregate. In the UEFA Cup first round, United lost to Girondins de Bordeaux 4–3 on aggregate.

===Exclusion and collapse===

On 14 April 2011 the club were suspended indefinitely by the Football Association of Finland because they had received money from a dubious company based in Singapore, known for involvement in fixed games and money laundering. The club was excluded from the 2011 season of Veikkausliiga. Players under contract were released due to lack of funds.

The club did not participate in any league in 2012 or 2013. In April 2013 the Turku Court of Appeal found the former CEO Deniz Bavautdin and the former chairman of the board Harri Pyhältö guilty of money laundering.

===Revival by the supporters===

Supporters of Tampere United founded a supporters&#x27; trust in 2009 after the club had hit financial difficulties. The aim was to help fans gain a voice within the club and to buy shares of the club.

In 2012 the supporters&#x27; trust founded a new team named after the supporters&#x27; trust, TamU-K, In 2012 the team played in Kutonen, the bottom division in Finnish football, and gained promotion to Vitonen. The promotion playoff match that decided promotion had the attendance of 441. In 2013 the team was promoted to Vitonen and in 2014 the team made it to penalties in the promotion playoff and lost. After another season in Nelonen TamU-K was promoted to Kolmonen,

In the lead up to the 2016 season, Tampere United took over all the teams that played under TamU-K. Thereby the first team played in Kolmonen in 2016, and after the season it got promoted Kakkonen. In 2017 Tampere United finished sixth in Kakkonen Group B and in 2018 it finished ninth in Group C, and remains in Kakkonen in the 2019 season.

<text>The properties of the [[Holy See]] are regulated by the 1929 Lateran Treaty signed with the Kingdom of Italy. Although part of Italian territory, some of them enjoy extraterritoriality similar to those of foreign embassies, including tax exemptions. Nonetheless, those visiting these properties are generally required to follow the immigration rules of Italy. For example, American seminarians at the Pontifical North American College need an Italian visa, despite residing, and studying, in extraterritorial property of the Holy See.

==Name of trust==
The Trust was originally named &quot;The Reform Research Trust&quot; however it sometimes refers to itself as the abbreviated &quot;Reform&quot; such as the website www.reform.uk which has led to some disputes regarding the name.

In November 2020 the trust voiced its opposition to the electoral committee when the Brexit Party, a British political party, intended to change its name to Reform UK. The charity feared that its non-partisan status would be brought into disrepute by the name change, and requested for the party to come up with an alternative. In January 2021, the Electoral Commission approved of the Brexit Party&#x27;s name change to Reform UK.

== Funding ==
In November 2022 Reform was given a &#x27;B&#x27; grade for funding transparency by Who Funds You?, meaning that they named at least 85% of donors that provided more than £5,000 of funding.

<doc id="832518" wikidata="Q920870" url="?curid=832518" title="Intellectualism">
<text>Intellectualism is the mental perspective that emphasizes the use, development, and exercise of the intellect, and is identified with the life of the mind of the intellectual. In the field of philosophy, the term &quot;intellectualism&quot; indicates one of two ways of critically thinking about the character of the world: (i) rationalism, which is knowledge derived solely from reason; and (ii) empiricism, which is knowledge derived solely from sense experience. Each intellectual approach attempts to eliminate fallacies that ignore, mistake, or distort evidence about &quot;what ought to be&quot; instead of &quot;what is&quot; the character of the world.

==Ancient moral intellectualism==
The first historical figure who is usually called an &quot;intellectualist&quot; was the Greek philosopher Socrates (c. 470 – 399 BC), who taught that intellectualism allows that &quot;one will do what is right or [what is] best, just as soon as one truly understands what is right or best&quot;; that virtue is a matter of the intellect, because virtue and knowledge are related qualities that a person accrues, possesses, and improves by dedication to the use of reason. Philosopher Dominic Scott refers to a &quot;standard criticism&quot; of Socrates&#x27; attitude to human nature: that he treats human nature as more rational than it really is.

Socrates&#x27;s definition of moral intellectualism is a basis of the philosophy of Stoicism, wherein the consequences of that definition are called &quot;Socratic paradoxes&quot;, such as &quot;There is no weakness of will&quot;, because a person either knowingly does evil or knowingly seeks to do evil (moral wrong); that anyone who does commit evil or seeks to commit evil does so involuntarily; and that virtue is knowledge, that there are few virtues, but that all virtues are one.

The concepts of truth and knowledge in contemporary philosophy are unlike Socrates&#x27;s concepts of truth, knowledge, and ethical conduct, and cannot be equated with modern, post–Cartesian conceptions of knowledge and rational intellectualism. In that vein, by way of detailed study of history, Michel Foucault demonstrated that in classical antiquity (800 BC – AD 1000), &quot;knowing the truth&quot; was akin to &quot;spiritual knowledge&quot;, which is integral to the principle of &quot;caring for the self&quot;. In an effort to become a moral person the care for the self is realised through ascetic exercises meant to ensure that knowledge of truth was learned and integrated to the Self. Therefore, to understand truth meant possessing &quot;intellectual knowledge&quot; that integrated the self to the (universal) truth and to living an authentic life. Achieving that ethical state required continual care for the self, but also meant being someone who embodies truth, and so can readily practice the Classical-era rhetorical device of &quot;parrhesia&quot;: &quot;to speak candidly, and to ask forgiveness for so speaking&quot;; and, by extension, to practice the moral obligation to speak truth for the common good, even at personal risk.

==Medieval theological intellectualism==
Medieval theological intellectualism is a doctrine of divine action, wherein the faculty of intellect precedes, and is superior to, the faculty of the will (&quot;voluntas intellectum sequitur&quot;). As such, intellectualism is contrasted with voluntarism, which proposes the will as superior to the intellect, and to the emotions; hence, the stance that &quot;according to intellectualism, choices of the Will result from that which the intellect recognizes as good; the will, itself, is determined. For voluntarism, by contrast, it is the Will which identifies which objects are good, and the Will, itself, is indetermined&quot;. From that philosophical perspective and historical context, the Spanish Muslim polymath Averroës (1126–1198) in the 12th century, the English theologian Roger Bacon, the Italian Christian theologian Thomas Aquinas (1225–1274), and the German Christian theologian Meister Eckhart (1260–1327) in the 13th century, are recognised intellectualists.

<doc id="832519" wikidata="Q2412005" url="?curid=832519" title="Bothwell Castle">
<text>Bothwell Castle is a large medieval castle, sited on a high, steep bank, above a bend in the River Clyde in South Lanarkshire, Scotland. It is located between Bothwell and Uddingston, about south-east of Glasgow. Construction of the castle was begun in the 13th century by the ancestors of Clan Murray, to guard a strategic crossing point of the Clyde. Bothwell played a key role in Scotland&#x27;s Wars of Independence, changing hands several times.

The huge cylindrical donjon was built in the 13th century, but before the rest of the castle was completed it was severely damaged in a series of sieges. Rebuilding in the early 15th century enlarged the castle, but it was abandoned by the 18th century. The present ruin is rectangular, with the remains of the donjon to the west, and the later Great Hall to the east. The courtyard is enclosed by long curtain walls, with round towers at the south-east and south-west corners. The castle was described by Scottish archaeologist William Douglas Simpson as one of the &quot;foremost secular structures of the Middle Ages in Scotland&quot;.

==History==
King David I granted the barony of Bothwell to David Olifard (or Olifant), Justiciar of Lothian, in the mid 12th century. The lands passed to his descendants including his daughter who had married William de Moravia son of William son of Freskin, who was deceased by 1226 circa. Then by 1252 the barony became the property of their son Walter de Moravia, or Walter of Moray He began construction of the castle, but by the start of the Wars of Scottish Independence in 1296, only the main donjon, the prison tower, and the short connecting curtain wall were completed. Foundations of the remainder were probably in place, and would have been defended by a wooden palisade.

===Wars of Scottish Independence===
The forces of King Edward I of England invaded Scotland at the start of the war, and seized Bothwell. The castle was at this time held by Walter&#x27;s son, William Moray of Bothwell. The English garrison holding the castle was besieged by the Scots for 14 months in 1298—1299, and eventually capitulated. Edward I returned in 1301, capturing the castle once more with a force of 6800 men, and specially constructed siege engines. Bothwell became the headquarters of Aymer de Valence, 2nd Earl of Pembroke, Edward&#x27;s appointed Warden of Scotland, and remained in English hands for several years.
Following Robert the Bruce&#x27;s victory at Bannockburn in 1314, the castle provided shelter for several English nobles. However, the castle&#x27;s constable, Sir Walter FitzGilbert, surrendered the castle to the approaching Scots. For this act, he was granted the barony of Cadzow, where his descendants became the powerful Hamilton family. The Scots slighted the castle after its surrender.

In 1336 the English returned again, this time under Edward III. The English king had the castle repaired, and again made it his headquarters in Scotland. The following year, however, Sir Andrew Murray, great-nephew of Sir William and the rightful owner of Bothwell, recaptured the stronghold, again using siege engines. Following his victory he slighted the castle once more, pulling down the west side of the donjon and tumbling it into the Clyde, in order that it could not be reoccupied by the enemy. The castle remained derelict until the 1360s.

===Douglas===
In 1362, Joan Moray of Bothwell, heiress of the Morays, married Archibald Douglas, nicknamed &quot;the Grim&quot; and later to be Lord of Galloway and Earl of Douglas. Douglas commenced rebuilding Bothwell, repairing the donjon and completing the walls. The work was continued by his son, Archibald, the 4th Earl. By 1424 they had constructed the Great Hall and adjacent chapel, with towers at the north-east and south-east corners, and curtain walls connecting to the donjon, enclosing the courtyard.

The &quot;Black&quot; Douglases were forfeited in 1455, and their lands returned to the crown. James III granted Bothwell to Lord Crichton, and then to Sir John Ramsay, who were both forfeited in turn. In 1488 Bothwell was granted again to Patrick Hepburn, 2nd Lord Hailes, and the Earldom of Bothwell was created for him. Hepburn did not retain Bothwell Castle for long, however, exchanging it with Archibald Douglas, 5th Earl of Angus, known as &quot;Bell-the-Cat&quot;, in return for Hermitage Castle in Liddesdale. James IV visited Bothwell in 1503 and 1504.
Bothwell thus reverted to the Douglases, and descended through the Earls of Angus and Marquesses of Douglas to the Earls of Forfar. Archibald Douglas, 1st Earl of Forfar, began construction of a new mansion nearby, demolishing the castle&#x27;s north-east tower for its stone. (His house was demolished in 1926 due to mining subsidence in the area). After the death of the 2nd Earl at Sheriffmuir in 1715, the castle reverted to the senior line of the Douglas family, represented by the 1st Duke of Douglas and his heirs. The castle then descended to the Earls of Home. In 1935 the 13th Earl gave Bothwell into state care. It is now managed by Historic Environment Scotland as a scheduled monument, and was open to the public (with admission charge) until the castle was closed in 2020 due to safety issues.

==Design==
While the castle was never completed to its original design, its design is similar to the strongholds of Coucy, Kildrummy and Dirleton as it has a round keep (&quot;or donjon&quot;). The keep, while currently in ruins, was originally high and in diameter with walls which were thick. Thick walls and a powerful gatehouse were later added to the structure and the castle was considered &quot;one of the most important military strongholds in Scotland&quot;.

==Popular culture==
The castle features in &quot;The Scottish Chiefs&quot;.

<text>High-performance computing (HPC) is the use of supercomputers and computer clusters to solve advanced computation problems.

==Overview==
HPC integrates systems administration (including network and security knowledge) and parallel programming into a multidisciplinary field that combines digital electronics, computer architecture, system software, programming languages, algorithms and computational techniques.
HPC technologies are the tools and systems used to implement and create high performance computing systems. Recently, HPC systems have shifted from supercomputing to computing clusters and grids. Because of the need of networking in clusters and grids, High Performance Computing Technologies are being promoted by the use of a collapsed network backbone, because the collapsed backbone architecture is simple to troubleshoot and upgrades can be applied to a single router as opposed to multiple ones.

The term is most commonly associated with computing used for scientific research or computational science. A related term, high-performance technical computing (HPTC), generally refers to the engineering applications of cluster-based computing (such as computational fluid dynamics and the building and testing of virtual prototypes). HPC has also been applied to business uses such as data warehouses, line of business (LOB) applications, and transaction processing.

High-performance computing (HPC) as a term arose after the term &quot;supercomputing&quot;. HPC is sometimes used as a synonym for supercomputing; but, in other contexts, &quot;supercomputer&quot; is used to refer to a more powerful subset of &quot;high-performance computers&quot;, and the term &quot;supercomputing&quot; becomes a subset of &quot;high-performance computing&quot;. The potential for confusion over the use of these terms is apparent.

Because most current applications are not designed for HPC technologies but are retrofitted, they are not designed or tested for scaling to more powerful processors or machines. Since networking clusters and grids use multiple processors and computers, these scaling problems can cripple critical systems in future supercomputing systems. Therefore, either the existing tools do not address the needs of the high performance computing community or the HPC community is unaware of these tools. A few examples of commercial HPC technologies include:
* the simulation of car crashes for structural design
* molecular interaction for new drug design
* the airflow over automobiles or airplanes

In government and research institutions, scientists simulate galaxy creation, fusion energy, and global warming, as well as work to create more accurate short- and long-term weather forecasts. The world&#x27;s tenth most powerful supercomputer in 2008, IBM Roadrunner (located at the United States Department of Energy&#x27;s Los Alamos National Laboratory) simulated the performance, safety, and reliability of nuclear weapons and certifies their functionality.

==TOP500==

TOP500 ranks the world&#x27;s 500 fastest high-performance computers, as measured by the High Performance LINPACK (HPL) benchmark. Not all existing computers are ranked, either because they are ineligible (e.g., they cannot run the HPL benchmark) or because their owners have not submitted an HPL score (e.g., because they do not wish the size of their system to become public information, for defense reasons). In addition, the use of the single LINPACK benchmark is controversial, in that no single measure can test all aspects of a high-performance computer. To help overcome the limitations of the LINPACK test, the U.S. government commissioned one of its originators, Jack Dongarra of the University of Tennessee, to create a suite of benchmark tests that includes LINPACK and others, called the HPC Challenge benchmark suite. This evolving suite has been used in some HPC procurements, but, because it is not reducible to a single number, it has been unable to overcome the publicity advantage of the less useful TOP500 LINPACK test. The TOP500 list is updated twice a year, once in June at the ISC European Supercomputing Conference and again at a US Supercomputing Conference in November.

Many ideas for the new wave of grid computing were originally borrowed from HPC.

== High performance computing in the cloud ==

Traditionally, HPC has involved an on-premises infrastructure, investing in supercomputers or computer clusters. Over the last decade, cloud computing has grown in popularity for offering computer resources in the commercial sector regardless of their investment capabilities. Some characteristics like scalability and containerization also have raised interest in academia. However security in the cloud concerns such as data confidentiality are still considered when deciding between cloud or on-premise HPC resources.

<text>Guillaume-Antoine Olivier (; 19 January 1756, Les Arcs near Toulon – 1 October 1814, Lyon) was a French entomologist and naturalist.

==Life==
Olivier studied medicine in Montpellier, where he became good friends with Pierre Marie Auguste Broussonet. With Jean Guillaume Bruguière and Jean-Baptiste Lamarck .Jean-Baptiste-François Gigot d&#x27;Orcy later employed Olivier who was then able to travel to England and Holland meeting Thomas Martyn in London. In 1789 and 1790 he published the first two volumes of the &quot;Histoire naturelle des Coléoptères&quot; for Gigot d&#x27;Orcy, and simultaneously, thanks to Daubenton&#x27;s recommendation, collaborated in the &quot;Dictionnaire de l&#x27;Histoire naturelle des Insectes, Papillons, Crustacés&quot; and collaborated in the creation of &quot;Journal d&#x27;Histoire Naturelle&quot; (1792). Afterwards, he served as a naturalist on a 6-year scientific journey that took him to Asia Minor, Persia, Egypt, Cyprus and Corfu. He returned to France in 1798 with a large collection of natural history specimens from his travels. Later, he was associated with the &quot;École nationale vétérinaire d&#x27;Alfort&quot;, where in 1811, he was appointed professor of zoology. Olivier was a close friend of Johan Christian Fabricius and a patron of Pierre André Latreille.

Although primarily an entomologist, Olivier also worked in the scientific field of herpetology, describing several new species of Asian lizards. He also described a few plant species, including &quot;Prunus arabica&quot; and &quot;Quercus libani&quot;.

==Works==
Olivier was the author of &quot;Coléoptères&quot; Paris Baudouin 1789–1808 (11 editions), &quot;Entomologie, ou histoire naturelle des Insectes&quot; (1808) and &quot;Le Voyage dans l&#x27;Empire Othoman, l&#x27;Égypte et la Perse&quot; (1807). He was a contributor to &quot;Encyclopédie Méthodique&quot;.

==Legacy==

Today, most of his collection is housed at the Museum National d&#x27;Histoire Naturelle in Paris.

A species of lizard, &quot;Mesalina olivieri&quot;, is named in his honor.

<doc id="832537" wikidata="Q265044" url="?curid=832537" title="Adolph Alexander Weinman">
<text>Adolph Alexander Weinman (December 11, 1870 – August 8, 1952) was a German-born American sculptor and architectural sculptor.

==Early life and education==

Adolph Alexander Weinman was born in Durmersheim, near Karlsruhe, Germany. He immigrated to the United States in 1885 at the age of 14. At 15, he attended evening classes at Cooper Union. He later studied at the Art Students League of New York with sculptors Augustus Saint-Gaudens and Philip Martiny.

==Career==
He was an assistant to the sculptors Charles Niehaus, Olin Warner, and Daniel Chester French before opening his studio in 1904. Although Weinman is now best remembered as a medalist, he considered himself to be an architectural sculptor. His steadiest income was derived from the sale of small bronze reproductions of his larger works, such as &quot;Descending Night&quot;, originally commissioned for the Panama–Pacific International Exposition, San Francisco, 1915.

Weinman was a member of the National Sculpture Society and served as its president from 1927 to 1930. His work was also part of the sculpture event in the art competition at the 1928 Summer Olympics. He served on the U.S. Commission of Fine Arts from 1929 to 1933. He was also a member of the American Academy of Arts and Letters, the National Institute of Arts and Letters, the National Academy of Design, and the New York City Art Commission, among other organizations.

==Death==
Weinman died in Port Chester, New York, on August 8, 1952. Following a Mass at Manhattan&#x27;s St. Patrick&#x27;s Cathedral, he was buried at Calvary Cemetery in Queens. Weinman&#x27;s papers are at the Smithsonian Archives of American Art.

His son Robert Weinman was also a sculptor, and his son Howard Weinman designed the Long Island Tercentenary half dollar commemorative coin.

==Works==

Despite his objections, Weinman is still best remembered as the designer of the Walking Liberty Half Dollar, a design now used for the obverse of the American Silver Eagle one-ounce bullion coin, and the &quot;Mercury&quot; dime along with various medals for the Armed Services of the United States. Among these are the identical reverses of the Asiatic-Pacific Campaign Medal, the European-African-Middle Eastern Campaign Medal, and the American Campaign Medal. Weinman was one of many sculptors and artists who employed Audrey Munson as a model.

Weinman&#x27;s work as an architectural sculptor can be found on the Wisconsin, Missouri, and Louisiana state capitols. He became the sculptor of choice for the architecture firm McKim, Mead, and White and designed sculpture for their Manhattan Municipal Building, Madison Square Presbyterian Church (completed 1906 and demolished 1919), Prison Ship Martyrs&#x27; Monument, and Pennsylvania Railroad Station (completed 1910 and demolished 1963), all in New York City. A photograph of one of his angels, &quot;Day&quot;, in a landfill in New Jersey is one of the saddest reminders of the destruction of Penn Station in 1963, but two of his eagles were retained as trophies outside the entrance to the new subterranean Penn Station. Elsewhere he created the dramatic frieze on the Elks National Veterans Memorial in Chicago and executed sculpture for the Post Office Department Building, the Jefferson Memorial, and the interior of the U.S. Supreme Court, all in Washington, D.C.

Weinman&#x27;s non-architectural works include the Macomb and the Maybury monuments in Detroit. Another example of his non-architectural work is his Abraham Lincoln Statue (Kentucky) located in the center of Hodgenville, Kentucky.

Weinman collaborated with Polish American sculptor Joseph Kiselewski to create a sculpture on the Bronx County Court House in New York City in the early 1930s.

Weinman was one of 250 sculptors who exhibited at the 3rd Sculpture International held at the Philadelphia Museum of Art in the summer of 1949.

Weinman&#x27;s works are mostly executed in a lyrical neoclassical style. His figures typically wear classical drapery, but there is a fluidity found in his work that is a harbinger of the Art Deco style that was to follow him. His bronze statuette &quot;The Nude Golfer&quot; epitomizes this style. This work evokes classical sculpture in its attention to anatomy and movement and the nude status of the athlete while the subject, a modern golfer, provides a modern twist.

Weinman also taught; among his pupils was Eleanor Mary Mellon.

The tall taller figure is Columbia, with her arms spread wide holding the United States flag. The youthful maiden at her side represents the Louisiana Purchase Territory. Emblematic of her reception into the union, the maiden is divesting herself of the cloak of France, the material decorated with bees, the emblem of Napoleon. In the background is the rising sun, marking the dawn of a new era of progress to the nation. Encircling the two figures are the words “Universal Exposition – Saint Louis – United States of America.”
 The reverse shows an architectural tablet inscribed with “Gold Medal” and “Louisiana Purchase Exposition”. Below the tablet are two dolphins symbolizing the nations’ eastern and western boundaries, the Atlantic and Pacific oceans. Above the tablet is a large eagle with its wings spread. The inscription reads “Gold Medal (Silver and Bronze Medals were also given out) Louisiana Purchase Exposition 1904”. In addition to the medal a diploma of award was also given to the recipient. The medal weights approximately 3.5 ounces.

<text>The northern red snapper (Lutjanus campechanus) is a species of marine ray-finned fish, a snapper belonging to the family Lutjanidae. It is native to the western Atlantic Ocean, the Caribbean Sea, and the Gulf of Mexico, where it inhabits environments associated with reefs. This species is commercially important and is also sought-after as a game fish.

==Taxonomy==
The northern red snapper was first formally described in 1860 as &quot;Mesoprion campechanus&quot; by the Cuban zoologist Felipe Poey with the type locality given as Campeche in Mexico. The specific name reflects the type locality.

==Characteristics==

The northern red snapper&#x27;s body is very similar in shape to other snappers, such as the mangrove snapper, mutton snapper, lane snapper, and dog snapper. All feature a sloped profile, medium-to-large scales, a spiny dorsal fin, and a laterally compressed body. Northern red snapper have short, sharp, needle-like teeth, but they lack the prominent upper canine teeth found on the mutton, dog, and mangrove snappers. They are rather large and are red in color.
This snapper reaches maturity at a length of about . The common adult length is , but may reach . The maximum published weight is 50 lb, 4 oz (22.79 kg) and the oldest reported age is 57+ years.
Coloration of the northern red snapper is light red, with more intense pigment on the back. It has 10 dorsal spines, 14 soft dorsal rays, three anal spines and eight to 9 anal soft rays. Juvenile fish (shorter than 30–35 cm) can also have a dark spot on their sides, below the anterior soft dorsal rays, which fades with age.

== Distribution ==

The northern red snapper is found at a depth of 30 to 620 feet in the Gulf of Mexico, the Caribbean Sea, and the southeastern Atlantic coast of Mexico and the United States and much less commonly northward as far as Massachusetts. In Latin American Spanish, it is known as &#x27;, &#x27;, &#x27;, or &#x27;.

This species commonly inhabits waters from , but can be caught as deep as on occasion. They stay relatively close to the bottom, and inhabit rocky bottoms, ledges, ridges, and artificial reefs, including offshore oil rigs and shipwrecks. Like most other snappers, northern red snapper are gregarious and form large schools around wrecks and reefs. These schools are usually made up of fish of very similar size.

The preferred habitat of this species changes as it grows and matures due to increased need for cover and changing food habits. Newly hatched red snapper spread out over large areas of open benthic habitat, then move to low-relief habitats, such as oyster beds. As they near one year of age, they move to intermediate-relief habitats as the previous year&#x27;s fish move on to high-relief reefs with room for more individuals. Around artificial reefs such as oil platforms, smaller fish spend time in the upper part of the water column while more mature (and larger) adults live in deeper areas. These larger fish do not allow smaller individuals to share this territory. The largest red snapper spread out over open habitats, as well as reefs.

==Reproduction and growth==
Diaz reported weight vs. length data for &quot;L. campechanus&quot; for the National Marine Fisheries Service (US). As northern red snapper grow longer, they increase in weight, but the relationship between length and weight is not linear. The relationship between total length (L, in inches) and total weight (W, in pounds) for nearly all species of fish can be expressed by an equation of the form:

formula_1

Invariably, b is close to 3.0 for all species, and c is a constant that varies among species. Diaz reported that for red snapper, c=0.000010 and b=3.076. These values are for inputs of length in cm and result in weight in kg.

Szedlmayer et al. reported length vs. age data for &quot;L. campechanus&quot; in a primarily artificial reef environment off the coast of Alabama, US: TL(age) = 1,025 (1 – e^( -0.15 age)), N=409, R = 0.96. For the first five years, growth can be estimated as being approximately linear: TL(age) = 97.7 age + 67.6, N = 397, R = 0.87 (for each equation, age is in years and total length is in mm). Szedlmayer &amp; Shipp 1994, Patterson 1999, Nelson and Manooch 1982, Patterson et al 2001, Wilson &amp; Nieland 2001, and Fischer et al 2004 show &quot;L. campechanus&quot; growing most rapidly over its first 810 years.

Northern red snappers move to different types of habitats during their growth process. When they are newly spawned, red snapper settle over large areas of open benthic habitat(s). Below age 1, the red snapper move to low-relief habitats for food and cover. If available, oyster shell beds are preferred. The second stage is when these fish outgrow low-relief habitats and move to intermediate-relief habitats as age 1 snapper leave to move on to another growth stage. Next, at about age 2, snapper seek high-relief reefs having low densities of larger snapper. Next, at platforms, smaller snapper occupy the upper water column. Then, the larger, older snapper occupy the deeper areas of the platforms and large benthic reefs and they prevent smaller snapper and other fish from using these habitats. In spite of local habitat preferences, Szedlmayer reported that of 146 &quot;L. campechanus&quot; tagged, released and recaptured within about a year, 57% were still approximately at their respective release site, and 76% were recaptured within 2 km of their release site. The greatest movement by a single fish was 32 km.

A northern red snapper attains sexual maturity at two to five years old, and an adult snapper can live for more than 50 years. Research from 1999–2001 suggested the populations of red snapper off the coast of Texas reach maturity faster and at a smaller size than populations off of the Louisiana and Alabama coasts.

==Commercial and recreational use==
Northern red snapper are a prized food fish, caught commercially, as well as recreationally. It is sometimes used in Vietnamese canh chua (&quot;Sour soup&quot;). Red snapper is the most commonly caught snapper in the continental US (almost 50% of the total catch), with similar species being more common elsewhere. They eat almost anything, but prefer small fish and crustaceans. They can be caught on both live and cut bait, and also take artificial lures, but with less vigor. They are commonly caught up to and in length, but fish over have been taken.

Recreational fishing for northern red snapper has been popular for a long time, restricted mostly by fishing limits intended to ensure a sustainable population. The first minimum size limit was introduced in 1984, after a 1981 report described quickly declining harvests (both commercial and recreational) From 1985 to 1990, the annual recreational catch of red snapper was about 1.5 million. From 1991 to 2005, the catch was substantially higher, varying from year to year from 2.5 to 4.0 million.

When northern red snapper bite on a line, they tend to be nibblers and pickers, and a soft touch is needed when trying to catch them. Because the older red snapper like structure, anglers use bottom fishing over reefs, wrecks, and oil rigs, and use line and supplies in the 50-lb class. Since the anglers have to both choose the right bait and present it correctly, they tend to use multiple hooked baits. Favorite baits include squid, whole medium-sized fish, and small strips of fish such as amberjack. Although many northern red snapper are caught on the bottom, in some situations the larger fish are caught on heavy jigs (artificial lures), often tipped with a strip of bait or by freelining baits at the proper upper level.

Interest in recreational fishing for northern red snapper, and in the Gulf of Mexico in general, has increased dramatically. From 1995–2003, the number of Louisiana fishing charter guide license holders increased eight-fold. In 2017, the Gulf of Mexico Fishery Management Council estimated the commercial value of the red snapper fishery to be $129 million. While specific numbers on the economic impact of recreational red snapper fishing are not available, it is clear that the activity has a significant economic impact on coastal communities through tourism and fishing-related activities.

Since 1990, the total catch limit for northern red snapper has been divided into 49% for recreational fishermen and 51% for commercial. Commercially, they are caught on multiple-hook gear with electric reels. Fishing for red snapper has been a major industry in the Gulf of Mexico, but permit restrictions and changes in the quota system for commercial snapper fishermen in the Gulf have made the fish less commercially available. Researchers estimate the bycatch of young red snapper, especially by shrimp trawlers, is a significant concern.

Genetic studies have shown many fish sold as red snapper in the US are not actually &quot;L. campechanus,&quot; but other species in the family. Substitution of other species for red snapper is more common in large chain restaurants which serve a common menu nationwide. In these cases, suppliers provide a less costly substitute (usually imported) for red snapper. In countries such as India, where the actual red snapper is not available in its oceans, John snapper, Russell snapper are sold as &quot;red snapper&quot;.

==Stocking in artificial reefs==
Juvenile northern red snappers have been released on artificial reef habitats off the coast of Sarasota, Florida, to conduct investigations into the use of hatchery-reared juveniles to supplement native populations in the Gulf of Mexico. Artificial reefs off the coast of Alabama have proven to be a favorite habitat of red snapper two years old and older. Gallaway et al. (2009) analyzed several studies and concluded, in 1992, 70 – 80% of the age two red snapper in that area were living around offshore oil platforms.

==Other species mistaken for red snapper==
* &quot;Sebastes&quot;, rockfish, are called red snapper or Pacific red snapper.
* Several species of bigeye (Priacanthidae)
* Lane snapper
* Blackfin snapper

<text>James Henry Cousins (22 July 1873 – 20 February 1956) was an Irish-Indian writer, playwright, actor, critic, editor, teacher and poet. He used several pseudonyms, including Mac Oisín and the Hindu name Jayaram.

==Life==
Cousins was born at 29, Cavour Street in Belfast, Ireland, the descendant of Huguenot refugees. His father was James Cousins, a mariner, and Susan, née Davis. Largely self-educated at night schools, he worked some time as a clerk and became private secretary and speechwriter to Sir Daniel Dixon, 1st Baronet, the Lord Mayor of Belfast. In 1897 he moved to Dublin where he became part of a literary circle which included William Butler Yeats, George William Russell and James Joyce. He is believed to have served as a model for the Little Chandler character in Joyce&#x27;s short story collection Dubliners. Cousins was significantly influenced by Russell&#x27;s ability to reconcile mysticism with a pragmatic approach to social reforms and by the teachings of Madame Blavatsky. He had a lifelong interest in the paranormal and acted as reporter in several experiments carried out by William Fletcher Barrett, Professor of physics at Trinity College Dublin and one of the founders of the Society for Psychical Research. Cousins worked as a teacher in The High School, Dublin.

Cousins produced several books of poetry whilst in Ireland as well as acting in the first production of Cathleen Ní Houlihan (under the stage name of H. Sproule) with the famous Irish revolutionary and beauty Maud Gonne in the title role. His plays were produced in the first years of the twentieth century in the Abbey Theatre, the most famous being &quot;the Racing Lug&quot;. After a dispute with W. B. Yeats, who objected to &#x27;too much Cousins&#x27; the Irish National Theatre movement split with two-thirds of the actors and writers siding with Cousins against Yeats. He also wrote widely on the subject of Theosophy and in 1915 travelled to India with the voyage fees paid for by Annie Besant the President of the Theosophical Society. He spent most of the rest of his life in the sub-continent, apart from a year as Professor of English Literature at Keio University in Tokyo and another lecturing in New York. He formally converted to Hinduism in 1937. At the core of Cousins&#x27;s engagement with Indian culture was a firm belief in the &quot;shared sensibilities between Celtic and Oriental peoples&quot;.

Whilst in India he became friendly with many key Indian personalities including the poet Rabindranath Tagore, the Indian classical dancer Rukmini Devi Arundale, the painter Abdur Rahman Chughtai and Mahatma Gandhi. He gave the William Miller Memorial Lectures at Madras in 1938 on &quot;The Idea, Expression, and Fulfillment of Beauty,&quot; and he was the person who brought change into the life of poetry of the Great Renowned Kannada Poet and Writer Kuvempu. He wrote a joint autobiography with his wife Margaret Elizabeth Cousins (formerly Gretta Gillespie), a suffragette and one of the co-founders of the Irish Women&#x27;s Franchise League and All India Women&#x27;s Conference (AIWC).

In his &quot;The Future Poetry&quot; Sri Aurobindo has acclaimed Cousins&#x27; &quot;New Ways in English Literature&quot; as &quot;literary criticism which is of the first order, at once discerning and suggestive, criticism which forces us both to see and think.&quot; He has also acknowledged that he learnt to intuit deeper, being alerted by Cousins&#x27; criticisms of his poems. In 1920 Cousins came to Pondicherry to meet the Mother and Sri Aurobindo. The appreciation is palpable in the following citations:

From &quot;The Future Poetry&quot; by Sri Aurobindo:

&quot;It will be more fruitful to take the main substance of the matter for which the body of Mr.Cousins&#x27; criticism gives a good material. Taking the impression it creates for a starting-point and the trend of English poetry for our main text, but casting our view farther back into the past, we may try to sound what the future has to give us through the medium of the poetic mind and its power for creation and interpretation. The issues of recent activity are still doubtful and it would be rash to make any confident prediction; but there is one possibility which this book strongly suggests and which it is at least interesting and may be fruitful to search and consider. That possibility is the discovery of a closer approximation to what we might call the mantra in poetry that rhythmic speech which, as the Veda puts it, rises at once from the heart of the seer and from the distant home of the Truth, — the discovery of the word, the divine movement, the form of thought proper to the reality which, as Mr. Cousins excellently says,

&quot; &quot;lies in the apprehension of a something stable behind the instability of word and deed, something that is reflection of the fundamental passion of humanity for something beyond itself, something that is a dim foreshadowing of the divine urge which is prompting all creation to unfold itself and to rise out of its limitations towards its Godlike possibilities. Poetry in the past has done that in moments of supreme elevation; in the future there seems to be some chance of its making it a more conscious aim and steadfast endeavour.&quot;
==Vegetarianism==
Cousins and wife Margaret were interested in anti-vivisection, theosophy, vegetarianism and women&#x27;s suffrage. They were both strict vegetarians and in 1905 founded the Irish Vegetarian Society. Cousins lectured on &quot;The Cruelties and Diseases Connected with Flesh-Eating&quot; which was awarded first prize at the Vegetarian Federal Union in June 1907.

<doc id="832568" wikidata="Q2188884" url="?curid=832568" title="Motel 6">
<text>Motel 6 is an American chain of motels with locations in the United States and Canada. The chain was founded in Santa Barbara, California, in 1962 by William W. Becker and Paul Greene, and derives its name from the fact that rooms initially cost only six dollars.

Motel 6 also operates Studio 6, a chain of extended-stay hotels. Since 1986, the chain has also run radio advertisements narrated by Tom Bodett and featuring the slogan &quot;we&#x27;ll leave the light on for you&quot;.

In 2012, The Blackstone Group acquired the hotel brand from Accor Hotels, and began managing it as part of its real estate business. In September 2024, Oyo Rooms, an Indian hospitality chain, announced an agreement to acquire Motel 6 and Studio 6 in an all-cash transaction valued at $525 million. 

On December 17, 2024, OYO&#x27;s parent company, Oravel Stays, announced that it had completed the purchase of G6 Hospitality, which until then controlled hotels under the Motel 6 and Studio 6 brands.

==History==


Motel 6 was founded in Santa Barbara, California, in 1962, by two local building contractors: William Becker and Paul Greene. The partners developed a plan to build motels with rooms at low cost rates. They decided on a $6 room rate per night (equivalent to $ in ), which would cover building costs, land leases, and janitorial supplies.

Becker and Greene had specialized in building low-cost housing developments, and they wanted to provide an alternative to other major hotel chains, such as Holiday Inn, whose locations were becoming increasingly upscale in quality and price in the 1960s, after starting out with a budget-oriented concept. Becker and Greene spent two years formulating their business model and searched for ways to cut costs as much as possible. During the chain&#x27;s early years, Motel 6 emphasized itself as a &quot;no-frills&quot; lodging chain with rooms featuring coin-operated black-and-white television receivers instead of the free color televisions found in the more expensive motels, along with functional interior decor, to reduce the time it took to clean the rooms. The first location in Santa Barbara had no restaurant on-site, a notable difference from other hotels of the era. To this day, most motels have no on-site dining, though there is usually a choice of restaurants nearby.

As the 1960s progressed, the Motel 6 idea became very popular in the lodging industry, and other chains began to imitate the concept, as Motel 6 was slowly beginning to take a small share of the market away from the traditional hotels. In 1965, Motel 6 opened its 15th property, and first location outside California, in downtown Salt Lake City, Utah. Realizing the need to move quickly, Becker and Green set out on an ambitious expansion program and had opened its 25th location in Gilroy, California, by 1966. The occupancy rate by then was about 85 percent, well above the industry average, and as a result of their success, Motel 6 became an attractive acquisition target. Becker and Greene sold the chain to an investment group in 1968.

In the early 1970s, Motel 6 opened its largest location, Motel 6 Tropicana, in Las Vegas, Nevada. Additionally, the chain moved east and opened a location in Fort Lauderdale, Florida, in 1972. By 1980, Motel 6 had reached 300 locations. It was sold to Kohlberg Kravis Roberts in 1985, who moved the chain away from its &quot;no frills&quot; approach and began including amenities such as telephones and color television.

Market share declined throughout the 1980s, in part because of increased competition from other budget hotels. During this time, it bought out the Sixpence Inn chain in the western U.S., and Envoy Inn (formerly Budgetel and Bargaintel) in the Midwestern United States and Pennsylvania. Regal 8 Motels were acquired in 1991. In 1990, the company was bought by the French-based Accor. In 1993, it opened its first high-rise location—Motel 6 LAX in Los Angeles, California.

Unlike the majority of hotel chains, Motel 6 directly owns and operates most of its locations. To expand more rapidly outside its traditional Western United States base, the chain started franchising in 1994. Accor management also took over motels that had been franchised by other chains. Motel 6 began to renovate all bedrooms, sold under-performing locations, and upgraded door locks and other security measures. Newer properties, as well as acquisitions, have interior corridors. Its competitors include America&#x27;s Best Value Inn, Days Inn, Econo Lodge, and Super 8 Motels. In 1999, Motel 6 launched Studio 6 Extended Stay, hotels with suites that are designed for longer stays and feature kitchenettes.

In 2000, Motel 6 went international by opening its first location outside the U.S. in Burlington, Ontario, Canada. Then, in 2002, Motel 6 celebrated its 40th anniversary at its first location in Santa Barbara, California.

In 2006, Accor and Motel 6 invested more than $6 million in properties to help rebuild New Orleans and Gulfport following Hurricane Katrina. One of the Motel 6 co-founders, William Becker, died of a heart attack at the age of 85 the next year.

The company was sold by Accor to The Blackstone Group in 2012 for $1.9 billion. Blackstone announced that Motel 6 would be operated on a stand-alone basis.

In September 2017, immigration attorneys accused Motel 6 desk clerks at two locations in the area of Phoenix, Arizona, of notifying U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement when guests checked in with identification from Mexico. The attorneys said court records showed that federal immigration agents arrested at least 20 people at the Motel 6 locations over the course of seven months in 2017. Motel 6 said the practice was &quot;implemented at the local level without the knowledge of senior management&quot; and every location had been given a directive that they were &quot;prohibited from voluntarily providing daily guest lists to ICE.&quot; Motel 6 was sued for discrimination and privacy violations in connection with the case and on November 2, 2018, agreed to settle with the plaintiffs for $7.6 million.

Additionally, Washington state filed a lawsuit in January 2018 against Motel 6 for giving the names of thousands of other motel guests to U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement officers. In April 2019, Motel 6 agreed to pay $12 million to settle the lawsuit.

On April 24, 2018, the American Customer Satisfaction Index published a study of America&#x27;s most popular hotel chains, placing G6 Hospitality&#x27;s Motel 6 at the bottom of the category for the second year in a row.

As of August 2022, the most expensive motel in the entire Motel 6 chain was the first one in Santa Barbara, California. It had charged $6 per night before taxes for a room when it first opened in 1962. Sixty years later, during the late summer of 2022, the first Motel 6 was reportedly charging $426 per night for a room, before taxes.

In September 2024, Indian hospitality chain Oyo Rooms agreed to buy Motel 6 and Studio 6 in an all-cash deal worth $525 million.

== Services ==

Motel 6 locations offer guests free basic wireless internet access, and some locations offer an upgrade to premium wireless internet access with the charge not exceeding $4.99.

In March 2008, Motel 6 began a system-wide renovation program called the &quot;Phoenix Project&quot; to update the look and amenities of all bedrooms. Before the remodel, most rooms had colorful road-trip inspired bed covers, carpeted floors, shower curtains, CRT televisions and beige furnishings. Stained carpets and dirty shower curtains were a common complaint on online customer reviews. The remodel was designed with an eye towards not only modernizing rooms but keeping room rates low for years to come. Designers accomplished this by making the rooms more energy efficient, easy to clean, and easier to keep clean in the long term (keeping housekeeping and maintenance costs low). The remodel earned Motel 6 Travel &amp; Leisure magazine&#x27;s 2010 design award for Best Large Hotel.

==Advertising==
Beginning in 1986, Motel 6 has advertised through radio commercials featuring the voice of writer and National Public Radio commentator Tom Bodett, with the tagline &quot;We&#x27;ll leave the light on for you.&quot; The ads were created by Dallas advertising agency The Richards Group. They feature a tune composed by Tom Faulkner, performed by him on guitar and Milo Deering on fiddle. The first spots were conceived and written by David Fowler. In 1996, the ads won a Clio Award. The campaign itself has won numerous national and international awards and was selected by &quot;Advertising Age&quot; magazine as one of the Top 100 Advertising Campaigns of the Twentieth Century.

<text>Long Ashton is a village and civil parish in Somerset, England. It falls within the unitary authority of North Somerset and is one of a number of large villages just outside the boundary of city of Bristol urban area. The parish has a population of 6,044. The parish includes the hamlet of Yanley, and the residential area of Leigh Woods (although most of the woods themselves are in the neighbouring parish of Abbots Leigh).

The village is built on the south-facing slopes of a valley running from east to west, and on the old road from Bristol to Weston-super-Mare.

==History==

Prehistoric and Roman artefacts have been found in the area, at the site of the Gatcombe Roman Settlement, but the village originated in Saxon times. The Domesday Book records it as &quot;Estune&quot; (the place by the ash tree) and, afterwards, it was granted to Bishop Geoffrey of Coutances. The village is near two waterways being The Longmoor Brook and The Ashton Brook, thus the name Long Ashton. 

The parish was part of the hundred of Hartcliffe.

The manor house dates to 1265 and, in the late 15th century shares in the estate were purchased by Richard Amerike (one of the possible sources of the name America). Previously the manor had passed through the hands of the Lyons, Choke and finally Smyth families. By 1603 the Smyths had become the principal landowners in the parish and were lords of Long Ashton for four centuries—the estate finally being sold in 1946. A deserted medieval farmstead and part of a Romano-British field system north of Fenswood Farm has been identified including three enclosures which are thought to be the foundations of buildings, each surrounded by rubble banks.

The parish church of All Saints dates from about 1380, and the arms of its founder (Thomas de Lyons) are on the outside of the tower. The interior has some fine tombs, and some relatives of the poet Robert Southey are buried in the churchyard.

The other Church, Hebron Church was founded in 1934 by Ernest Dyer, who cycled to the village from Keynsham to run a Sunday School. Many of the people who have grown up in the village passed through this Sunday School.

Since the earliest recorded times, agriculture has been the major occupation of the parish, and there are still several working farms, some just outside the village. The Ashton Court estate provided occupations such as gamekeepers and foresters, and there have been several mills in the parish including a snuff-mill on the Land Yeo at Gatcombe in 1769, however the current building dates from the early 19th century. By 1846 it had been converted to grind mustard, annatto and drugs, but by 1874 was a flour mill. The internal machinery is still in place and the mill has been designated as a Grade II listed building. Kincott Mill had stood since at least the 13th century. By the early 19th century rented out for snuff grinding and in the 1830s a steam engine was installed to power a flour and corn mill. Later it was owned by an iron founder, who made edge tools and other farm implements and installed cast-iron water wheels.

Stone has been quarried for lime burning, as well as for building and road making. There was an iron foundry in the 19th century and coal mines — the Bedminster-Ashton coalfield finally closed in 1924.

The &quot;Angel Inn&quot;, near the church, is the oldest pub in the village, dating from 1495 and originally being a church-house. There are two other historic pubs in the village, The Bird in Hand and The Miners Rest which are very popular with visitors from Bristol—a horse-drawn bus ran from Redcliffe Street, Bristol to the &quot;Bird-in-Hand&quot; several times a week in the late 19th century.

The National Fruit and Cider Institute opened at Fenswood on the edge of the village in 1903. It became the Agricultural and Horticultural Research Station in 1912, and was known as Long Ashton Research Station until it was closed in 2003. During the Second World War it developed rose hip syrup and Ribena.
A Parochial School opened in 1818 and moved several times — the current Primary School, called Northleaze, opened in 1867 and moved to new premises in Brook Close in 2006. There have been other schools in the village, including boarding schools for &quot;Young Gentlemen&quot;.

Long Ashton railway station was opened by the Great Western Railway in Yanley Lane, where the Bristol to Taunton Line passes below the village, on 12 July 1926 but it was closed on 6 October 1941.

Colonel Reginald Dyer CB (9 October 1864 – 23 July 1927) spent his last two years in Long Ashton. As a temporary brigadier-general he was responsible for the Jallianwala Bagh massacre in Amritsar on 13 April 1919. The massacre was depicted in the 1982 film, &quot;Gandhi&quot;.

==Governance==

The parish council has responsibility for local issues, including setting an annual precept (local rate) to cover the council&#x27;s operating costs and producing annual accounts for public scrutiny. The parish council evaluates local planning applications and works with the local police, district council officers, and neighbourhood watch groups on matters of crime, security, and traffic. The parish council&#x27;s role also includes initiating projects for the maintenance and repair of parish facilities, such as the village hall or community centre, playing fields and playgrounds, as well as consulting with the district council on the maintenance, repair, and improvement of highways, drainage, footpaths, public transport, and street cleaning. Conservation matters (including trees and listed buildings) and environmental issues are also of interest to the council.

The parish falls within the unitary authority of North Somerset which was created in 1996, as established by the Local Government Act 1992. It provides a single tier of local government with responsibility for almost all local government functions within their area including local planning and building control, local roads, council housing, environmental health, markets and fairs, refuse collection, recycling, cemeteries, crematoria, leisure services, parks, and tourism. They are also responsible for education, social services, libraries, main roads, public transport, Trading Standards, waste disposal and strategic planning, although fire, police and ambulance services are provided jointly with other authorities through the Avon Fire and Rescue Service, Avon and Somerset Constabulary and the South Western Ambulance Service.

North Somerset&#x27;s area covers part of the ceremonial county of Somerset but it is administered independently of the non-metropolitan county. Its administrative headquarters are in the town hall in Weston-super-Mare. Between 1 April 1974 and 1 April 1996, it was the Woodspring district of the county of Avon. Before 1974 that the parish was part of the Long Ashton Rural District.

The village falls within the &#x27;Wraxall and Long Ashton&#x27; electoral ward. The ward starts in the west at Wraxall and proceeds easterly to &quot;Long Ashton&quot;. The total population of the ward as at the 2011 census was 7,793.

The parish is represented in the House of Commons of the Parliament of the United Kingdom as part of the North Somerset constituency. It elects one Member of Parliament (MP) by the first past the post system of election, currently Sadik Al-Hassan, a member of the Labour Party.

==Cricket==
Long Ashton Cricket Club plays in Yanley Lane. It runs two Saturday sides as well as a number of junior teams.
The team won the Bristol &amp; District Cricket Association League in 1977.

Famous players have included Chris Broad, who went on to become international cricketer of the year. Shane Warne, who was named as one of the five cricketers of the 20th century, played a few games for Long Ashton on tour in Cornwall in the early 1980s. The famous Victorian cricketer W G Grace attended school in Long Ashton.

== Football ==

Long Ashton first team play in the Somerset County League Division 2. The reserve team play in the Bristol and Suburban League Division 2. Their pitch is at Keedwell Hill.

==Golf==

The golf course at Long Ashton started its life in 1893 as a nine-hole course. However, this was all to change by 1905 when a further addition of land provided the stepping stone to adjoin the second nine holes.

==Open spaces==
Leigh Woods has been built on since 1865, and the land south of Nightingale Valley was fully developed by 1909. The rest has been preserved by gifts of land by the Wills family and is now owned by the National Trust.

The Clifton Suspension Bridge was opened in 1864 and provided an alternative route to Bristol; in 1906, a swing bridge was opened to give access to Hotwells. Traffic continued to grow throughout the 20th century, and a bypass was opened in 1968.

Ashton Court is a large estate that lies at the east end of the village. It was originally owned by the Smyth family until they were forced to donate it to Bristol City Council in lieu of inheritance tax. Ashton Court is host to several festivals each year, including the Bristol International Balloon Fiesta and the scenic landscaped grounds with views of Bristol are widely used by local residents for walking, golf and mountain biking.

Dawsons walk is an area of green space donated to the people of Long Ashton. It has been developed into a circular woodland and countryside walk. Access to the walk is from Lampton Road or from public footpath between Bourton Mead and 40 Long Ashton Road.

The Long Ashton Footpath Users Group have replaced 29 stiles on the public rights of way around the village with kissing gates to create a complete circular walk around the village, accessible to older people and those with mobility problems, although it can be muddy in places. The route, way marked with yellow Village Circular Walk discs, takes in views of the valley, passing through local farms and woodland.

Land next to the recreation ground has been turned into a public space in memory of Andrée Peel (13 February 1905 – 5 March 2010). Known as Agent Rose, she was a member of the French Resistance during World War II and spent her last years in the village. She died peacefully at the Lampton House nursing home on 5 March 2010.

<text>Ghazi al-Jabali (born 1946) is a Palestinian police officer. He was the Gaza Strip Chief of the Preventive Security Service, appointed by the Palestinian Authority. Al-Jabali, who held the rank of Major general at the close of his tenure in the Palestinian security forces, had been a police commander and chief of the Gaza police since the early 1990s.

Since 1994 he has been the target of repeated attacks by Palestinian groups opposed to the Fatah-led Palestinian Authority, including gunfire aimed at his offices and a bomb that destroyed part of his house. He has also been the subject of a 1997 arrest warrant and extradition request from Israel, based on accusations that he ordered Palestinian police officers to attack an Israeli checkpoint in July 1997.

Al-Jabali was the target of protests after the shooting deaths of three Palestinian teenagers during clashes with police forces; demonstrators claimed that al-Jabali had given police officers orders to shoot protesters throwing stones during a Hamas organized demonstration in support of Osama bin Laden.

Al-Jabali resigned from his post as chief of police in Gaza in June 2002, during a security forces shake-up that also saw the dismissal of Colonel Jibril Rajoub and the resignation of Colonel Mohammed Dahlan. Along with his resignation he announced his intention to oppose Yaser Arafat as a candidate for president of the Palestinian Authority. He was appointed chief of Palestinian Civil Police Forces in both the Gaza Strip and the West Bank in October 2003.

A February 2004 gunfight Gaza police headquarters was construed by some officials as an attempt on al-Jabali&#x27;s life. Other officials blamed violence on his rival Mohammad Dahlan members of the body he formerly commanded, Preventive Security Service.

Al-Jabali was criticised for corruption and curbing press freedoms, as well as the arrest of Eyad Sarraj, a civil rights activist.

On July 17, 2004, he was kidnapped at gunpoint by the Jenin Martyr&#x27;s Brigade part of the Popular Resistance Committees, who ambushed his convoy and wounded two bodyguards. Al-Jabali was only released after Palestinian President Yasser Arafat agreed to fire him. He was replaced with Arafat&#x27;s cousin, Musa Arafat, a move which did little to restore public confidence in Police.

<text>The rangeomorphs are a group of Ediacaran fossils. Ediacarans are the oldest large fossil organisms on earth, and many are not self-evidently related to anything else that has ever lived. However, some Ediacarans clearly resemble each other. Palentologists have not been able to agree on what else, if anything, is related to these organisms, so Ediacarans are usually classified into groups based on their appearance. These &quot;form taxa&quot; allow scientists to study and discuss Ediacarans when they cannot know what kind of living things they were, or how they were genetically related to each other. Rangeomorphs look roughly like fern fronds or feathers arranged around a central axis; the group is defined as Ediacarans with a similar appearance and structure to the genus &quot;Rangea&quot;. Some researchers, such as Pflug and Narbonne, believe all rangeomorphs were more closely related to each other than to anything else. If true, this would make the group a natural taxon called Rangeomorpha (just as all insects are more closely related to each other than to any non-insects, and therefore are a natural taxon called Insecta). 

Rangeomorphs are a key part of the Ediacaran biota, which survived about 30 million years, until the base of the Cambrian, . They were especially abundant in the cold, deep-ocean environments of the early Ediacaran, as shown in the Mistaken Point assemblage in Newfoundland.

== Body plan ==

Rangeomorphs are fractal and self-similar in form: they are made of branching sections, and each section repeats the same shape as the whole. The body &quot;frond&quot; is formed of branching &quot;frond&quot; elements, each a few centimetres long. Each of these is formed of many smaller &quot;frondlets.&quot; Structurally, these are tubes held up by a semi-rigid organic skeleton. This body plan could have been formed using fairly simple developmental patterns.

== Ecology ==

Rangeomorphs dwelt in shallow to abyssal marine environments, were unable to move, and had no apparent reproductive organs. They may have reproduced asexually by dropping fronds. Since many lived below the lowest level of the ocean where sunlight can penetrate, they could not have survived by photosynthesis. There is no evidence of a gut or mouth. One hypothesis is that nutrients from seawater were concentrated in their bodies by osmosis. Among living organisms, only osmotrophic bacteria live in this way, but the fractal branching tube structure of rangeomorphs gave them an unusual amount of surface area for every unit of body volume. This structure may have made it possible for osmotrophic organisms to grow to large sizes However, other researchers argue this way of life is implausible, and suggest filter feeding or other mechanisms. 

Most rangeomorphs were attached to the sea floor by a stalk ending in a circular holdfast. Holdfasts were often torn from the frond by wave action or decay before fossilization, and are preserved as separate disc-shaped fossils that were given their own genus names (e.g. Aspidella). Other rangeomorphs (such as the spindle-shaped &quot;Fractofusus&quot;) lay flat on the sediment surface.

Though we do not know what rangeomorphs were, aspects of their lives are revealed by the fossil record. In some areas, numbers of fronds of the same genus are found together. Analysis suggests that the genus &quot;Fractofusus&quot; could reproduce in two ways, first by setting a particle of tissue loose in the ocean to land on the sea floor and develop into a new individual (a &quot;grandparent&quot;), and second, by &quot;grandparents&quot; spreading rapidly with stolons to form surrounding groups of smaller &quot;parent&quot; and &quot;child&quot; fronds, just as modern plants such as strawberries spread by runners. 

Fossil assemblages from Newfoundland and the UK reveal that rangeomorphs could live in large groups. At least seven genera are associated with filaments or stolons up to four meters long. These filaments ran across or through the bacterial mats on which Ediacarans lived, connected with the holdfasts (or the center of the body in genera without holdfasts), and at least in some cases, connected individuals together. This evidence suggests rangeomorphs may have fed by absorbing nutrients from the bacterial mats, and might even have been colonial organisms (such as corals are today) rather than groups of unrelated individuals.

== Affinity ==

Rangeomorph communities are similar in structure to those of modern, suspension-feeding animals, but it is difficult to relate their morphology to any modern animals. Early researchers thought they were sea pens (Cnidaria), but examination of well-preserved specimens of Charnia reveals that the branching fronds of rangeomorphs were fundamentally different from sea pens in both anatomy and growth pattern, and the modern consensus is that they are unrelated. Rangeomorphs have at times been assigned to a range of modern animal and protist groups, but none of these classifications has withstood scrutiny; they probably represent an extinct stem group to either the animals or fungi. The fractal construction could be an adaptation to osmotic feeding that evolved independently in different groups, but most paleontologists now consider it to be a basic body characteristic inherited from a shared ancestor, which would mean the rangeomorphs are a natural taxon of organisms more closely related to each other than to anything else. The quilted construction suggests a close affinity to the erniettomorphs, another form taxon of Ediacarans whose bodies were made from sheets of many small tubes.

<text>South Ruislip is an area of west London in the London Borough of Hillingdon. 

A 2017 estimation put the population of South Ruislip ward as 13,150 residents.

The population, according to the 2001 UK census, was 10,823. By 2008, this had reached 11,116.

==Education==
Schools in South Ruislip include Bourne Primary, Deanesfield, Field End, St Swithun Wells and Queensmead.

==Sports==
McGovern Park is located on West End Road and is the headquarters of London GAA. It is the primary venue for playing hurling and Gaelic football in Britain.

==Transport==
South Ruislip station is served by the Central line of the London Underground. Chiltern Railways serve hourly, with trains to London Marylebone and . Although no bus route directly serves the station, London Buses route E7 serves one end of nearby Station Approach and route 114 serves the other.
The Royal Air Force station, RAF Northolt, is situated in South Ruislip near the A40 and the tube station. Most early RAF airfields were named after the nearest railway station; in this case Northolt Junction, the original name of South Ruislip station.

==Demography==

In the 2011 UK census, the racial makeup of South Ruislip was: 73% White, 16% Asian, 5% Black. 75.8% of the working age population was economically active. 38% of residents lived in semi-detached houses; 28% in terraced houses; 27% in flats/maisonettes/apartments; and 8% in detached houses. 69.4% of households owned their homes, 19% were privately rented, 10.1% were socially rented.

==Landmarks==

Polish fighter pilots during the Battle of Britain were based at RAF Northolt, and the Polish War Memorial was built later after the conflict. The memorial stands next to the A40 adjacent to the airfield, and is dedicated to the memory of the Polish airmen who fought with the Royal Air Force during the Second World War.

A damaged Vickers Wellington, attempting to land at RAF Northolt, crashed in Station Approach in October 1942. The resulting fire caused the remaining ammunition on board to detonate, and 21 people were killed.

In the 1950s and 1960s RAF South Ruislip supported by RAF West Ruislip was Headquarters, 7th Air Division of the Strategic Air Command (SAC), supporting SAC operations in the UK until 1958 when the 7th Air Division relocated to RAF High Wycombe, and the station became Headquarters, 3d Air Force and transferred to United States Air Forces, Europe. In 1972 HQ, 3d Air Force relocated to RAF Mildenhall and the buildings remained empty until 1995 when they were demolished.

In 2012, the BBC announced it would be moving the Digital Media Services branch of BBC Studios and Post Production from BBC Television Centre to the Odyssey Business Park opposite RAF Northolt between February and March 2013.

<text>Salman Pak (, ) is a city located approximately south of Baghdad near a peninsula formed by a broad eastward bend of the Tigris. It is named after Salman the Persian, a companion of the Islamic prophet Muhammad who is believed to be buried in Salman Al-Farsi Mosque in the city.

The city overlaps with the ancient metropolis of al-Mada&#x27;in, which includes the ruins of ancient Ctesiphon and ancient Seleucia. It is also quite close to the Salman Pak facility, an Iraqi military installation which was a key center of Saddam Hussein&#x27;s biological and chemical weapons programs, though none of these were found. The site included training grounds used by Iraqi intelligence to direct Special Operations Forces.

<text>The National Medal of Arts is an award and title created by the United States Congress in 1984, for the purpose of honoring artists and patrons of the arts. A prestigious American honor, it is the highest honor given to artists and arts patrons by the United States government. Nominations are submitted to the National Council on the Arts, the advisory committee of the National Endowment for the Arts (NEA), who then submits its recommendations to the White House for the President of the United States to award. The medal was designed for the NEA by sculptor Robert Graham.

==Laureates==
In 1983, prior to the official establishment of the National Medal of Arts, through the President&#x27;s Committee on the Arts and Humanities, President Ronald Reagan awarded a medal to artists and arts patrons.

==Recipients of the National Medal of Arts==
The National Medal of Arts was first awarded in 1985. The ceremony was not held in 2021 or 2022 due to the COVID-19 pandemic therefore the 2021 recipients were given the award in 2023.

==Declined honors==
In 1989, composer and conductor Leonard Bernstein refused his award, allegedly due to how a federal grant to an art show on AIDS had been revoked.

In 1992, composer and lyricist Stephen Sondheim refused his award, claiming that the NEA had &quot;become a victim of its own and others&#x27; political infighting and is rapidly being transformed into a conduit and a symbol of censorship and repression rather than encouragement and support&quot;.

In 1997, poet Adrienne Rich refused her award as a protest against &quot;inconsistencies&quot; between art and &quot;the cynical politics&quot; of the Clinton administration.

<text>Voices on the Verge was an American folk, country, and rock band formed as a collaboration between four young, formerly-independent, female musicians: Jess Klein, Erin McKeown, Rose Polenzani, and Beth Amsel.

The group formed in 1998 as a way to show the merits of each artist. They mostly played songs that one of the artists had previously written and recorded separately. The four artists were able to add harmonies and dynamics not present on individual recordings of their songs.

Their music was often compared to Ani DiFranco or Dar Williams. The group no longer plays together as a group, but , all four artists are still recording and performing separately. Their only CD, &quot;Live in Philadelphia&quot;, was released on October 2, 2001 on the Rykodisc label.

<text>South Ruislip () is a station served by London Underground and Chiltern Railways in South Ruislip in West London. The station is owned, managed and staffed by London Underground. The station is in Travelcard Zone 5.

==History==
The GWR/GCR Joint line to High Wycombe carried services from both Paddington and Marylebone. They met at Northolt Junction, situated slightly to the east of the station, from where four tracks ran westwards to Ruislip Gardens and West Ruislip; there the route shrank to two tracks only. Opened on 1 May 1908 and originally known as Northolt Junction, the station became South Ruislip &amp; Northolt Junction from September 1932 and received its present name on 30 June 1947. In October 1942, a Wellington bomber flying to the nearby airfield at RAF Northolt crashed near the station, killing all the crew and six civilians.

The station was designed by Brian Lewis and F.F.C. Curtis and first served by Central line trains on 21 November 1948 when the Central line extension from London towards West Ruislip was completed after being delayed by World War II. The rounded booking hall was not completed until 1960. The concrete, glass and granite chip frieze in the booking hall is one of the earliest public works by glass artist, Henry Haig.

In late 1973 and early 1974 the track layout was simplified and the manual signal box was removed in early 1990, along with other manual signal boxes on this line, and its function replaced by colour light signalling and power operated points, both controlled from Marylebone. The track alignments were improved to allow higher speed running at the junction for the services from Marylebone, and the pointwork which had allowed trains from Paddington to call at the westbound Chiltern station platform was removed. All eastbound services were moved to the former through road; the eastbound road, which had formerly extended from the platform road at West Ruislip, was closed and lifted, and the eastbound platform widened. The alignment of the turnout towards Marylebone was improved to allow higher-speed running. Fragments of the old trackwork can still be seen to the north of the line at this point. The trackwork at this station has been upgraded and now permits higher speed running up to .

The station was transferred from the Western Region of British Rail to the London Midland Region on 24 March 1974.

==The station today==
Ticket barriers control access to all platforms.

A large West London Waste Authority bulk rubbish handling depot lies to the east of the station which sees a daily waste train in operation. There is also a single-track connection with the Acton–Northolt line.

The lines to Marylebone formerly passed either side of West Waste. As part of Chiltern Railways&#x27; Evergreen 3 route improvements works, Northolt Junction was remodelled and included provision to the north of the waste transfer depot of a new down main line alongside the existing up main to allow services to be accelerated. The new down main line has a line speed limit of compared with the former . The existing down main was remodelled to become the down loop line, used by trains stopping at South Ruislip station.

The bridge outside which carries the lines over Station Approach is lower than others locally at and is often hit by high vehicles. Either side of it, false deck beams have been installed so the danger of any impacts causing damage to the bridge itself has been lessened.

==Services==
===National Rail===
National Rail services at South Ruislip are operated by Chiltern Railways.

The station&#x27;s weekday off-peak service pattern is unusual in that it&#x27;s served by trains at different frequencies in each direction. The station is served by one train every two hours to London Marylebone and one train per hour to . Services to and from London operate as stopping services calling at most stations. Additional services call at the station during the peak hours.

On weekends, the service is increased to hourly in each direction and northbound services are extended beyond High Wycombe to and from via .

===London Underground===
The typical off-peak London Underground service on the Central line in trains per hour is:
* 9 tph to 
* 9 tph to Epping

Additional services call at the station during the peak hours, increasing the service to up to 12 tph in each direction.

<text>Jaume Plensa i Suñé (; born 23 August 1955) is a Spanish visual artist, sculptor, designer and engraver. He has also created opera sets, video projections and acoustic installations.

==Biography==

Plensa was born in Barcelona, Catalonia, Spain. He left the studies of fine arts in Barcelona and continued to train in a self-taught way.

==Works==
Plensa&#x27;s works include the &quot;Crown Fountain&quot; at Millennium Park in Chicago, Illinois, which opened in July 2004. The fountain is composed of a black granite reflecting pool placed between a pair of glass brick towers. The towers are tall, and they use light-emitting diodes (LEDs) to display digital videos on the inward faces. In the summer of 2007, he participated in the Chicago public art exhibit, &quot;Cool Globes: Hot Ideas for a Cooler Planet&quot;.

Another Plensa piece is &quot;Blake in Gateshead&quot; in North East England, a laser beam that on special occasions shines high into the night sky over Gateshead&#x27;s Baltic Centre for Contemporary Art.

In 2007, working closely with a group of local ex-miners, he was also commissioned to create a new work on the landmark site of a former colliery near St Helens, Merseyside, as part of the Big Art Project, a major national public art initiative linked to Channel 4. Unveiled in spring 2009, &quot;Dream&quot; consists of an elongated white structure tall, weighing 500 tons, which has been carved to resemble the head and neck of a young woman with her eyes closed in meditation. The structure is coated in sparkling white Spanish dolomite, as a contrast to the coal which used to be mined there.

On 16 June 2008, Plensa&#x27;s sculpture of a listening glass entitled &quot;Breathing&quot; was dedicated by the incumbent Secretary-General of the United Nations, Ban Ki-moon, as a memorial to journalists killed whilst undertaking their work. The sculpture in steel and glass sits atop a new wing of Broadcasting House in London. At 22:00 GMT each evening a beam of light will be projected from the sculpture extending 1 km into the sky for 30 minutes to coincide with the BBC News at Ten.

In 2010, Plensa&#x27;s &quot;Alchemist&quot; was installed in front of the Stratton Student Center, facing the main entrance of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology in Cambridge, Massachusetts. It is a large, hollow seated figure similar to other contemporary Plensa figures, except that it is composed of numerals and mathematical symbols, to honor MIT&#x27;s traditional STEM-focused teaching and research. The sculpture was donated anonymously on the occasion of MIT&#x27;s 150th anniversary.

On 21 September 2010, Spillover II was unveiled in Atwater Park in Shorewood, Wisconsin, United States. A 260 cm (102 in) tall statue consisting of steel letters welded together in the shape of a man on top of a concrete base. 

&quot;El alma del Ebro&quot; was created for the International Exposition in Zaragoza, the theme of which was &quot;Water and Sustainable Development&quot;. It is eleven meters high, the sculpted letters representing cells of the human body which is over 60% water. Its white letters and hollow structure invite the viewer to look inside and reflect on the relationship between human beings and water. A similar sculpture entitled &quot;Singapore Soul&quot; (2011) was installed in front of the Ocean Financial Centre in Singapore. And an ensemble piece entitled &quot;I, You, She, He...&quot; with three figures composed of the letters, each seated on large flat boulders, can be seen at the Frederik Meijer Gardens &amp; Sculpture Park, in Grand Rapids, Michigan.

From May to mid-August 2011, the work &quot;Echo&quot; was displayed in Madison Square Park in Manhattan.

In November 2012, the Albright–Knox Art Gallery in Buffalo, New York unveiled a 32-ton sculpture by Plensa called &quot;Laura&quot;. The tall sculpture is composed of 20 massive pieces of marble from the south of Spain.

In 2013, Plensa installed a sculpture named &quot;Ainsa I&quot; at the entrance of the Olin Business School of Washington University in St. Louis.

In 2017, &quot;Love&quot; was installed in the Frisian city of Leeuwarden, Netherlands.

In 2019, the MACBA Museum of Contemporary Art Barcelona organized the most ambitious solo exhibition in his hometown, curated by the museum&#x27;s director, Ferran Barenblit. The exhibition traveled to the Museum of Modern Art Moscow, where it achieved notable success. 

In 2020, &quot;Dreaming&quot; was installed outside of the Richmond-Adelaide Centre in Toronto. Also in 2020, &quot;Behind the Walls&quot; was installed outside the University of Michigan Museum of Art.

&quot;Water&#x27;s Soul&quot; (2021) is along the Hudson River Waterfront Walkway in the Newport section of Jersey City.

<text>Filetopia is a free, multi-platform peer-to-peer file sharing client and networking tool that allows users to share files and send instant messages to others. Users can share files in public chat rooms or privately with contacts. 

== History ==
Filetopia software development started in October 1998, and the first public beta was released in March 1999. The classic Filetopia software version was 3.04d, 2002. In 2003, Filetopia v3.04 was reviewed in &quot;PC Magazine&quot; and rated 3/5. In 2004, the author of Filetopia was interviewed on the website Slyck.com.

In April 2012, development began on a project to completely rewrite the program in JavaFX. This version was eventually released as Filetopia FX.

=== Filetopia FX (from 2015) ===

Filetopia FX no longer allows global-wide file searching and instead encourages meeting new people. It is a complete rewrite of the original.

In this version, the maximum file size limit of 2 GB was removed; users gained the ability to post images and HTML fragments, which are filtered for security purposes; Room Walls have new features, such as comments, votes, and moderation; the ability to notify admins and subscribers was added; and the Log was given a search function.

Users could also host their own rooms, which are excluded from the main P2P network.
