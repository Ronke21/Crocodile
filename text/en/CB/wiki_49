<text>Bubba Ho-Tep is a 2002 American comedy horror film written, co-produced and directed by Don Coscarelli. It stars Bruce Campbell as Sebastian Haff, a man residing in a nursing home who claims to be the real Elvis Presley. The film also stars Ossie Davis as Jack, a black man who claims to be John F. &quot;Jack&quot; Kennedy, explaining that he was patched up after the assassination, dyed black, and abandoned.

It is based on the novella of the same name by Joe R. Lansdale, which originally appeared in the anthology &quot;The King Is Dead: Tales of Elvis Post-Mortem&quot;. Originally the film was &quot;roadshowed&quot; by the director across the country. Only 32 prints were made and circulated around various film festivals, though this garnered critical success, and it went on to win the Bram Stoker Award for Best Screenplay. By the time it was released on DVD, it had already achieved cult status due to positive reviews, lack of access, and inclusion of Campbell.

While the novella and film revolve around an ancient Egyptian mummy (played by Bob Ivy) terrorizing a retirement home, &quot;Bubba Ho-Tep&quot; also deals with the deeper theme of aging, identity, mortality, and existentialism. The film also features a cameo by Reggie Bannister from Coscarelli&#x27;s &quot;Phantasm&quot; series.

==Plot==
An elderly man at The Shady Rest Retirement Home in East Texas is known to the staff as Sebastian Haff, but claims to be the real Elvis Presley. He explains that during the 1970s, he grew tired of the demands of his fame and switched places with an Elvis impersonator named Sebastian Haff; he claims it was Haff who died in 1977, while he lived in quiet, happy anonymity and made a living pretending to be himself. After a propane explosion destroyed documentation which was the only proof that he was actually Elvis, he was unable to return to his old life. He also falls into a coma after injuring himself during a performance.

Twenty years later in the present, Elvis contemplates his age and dignity; his only friend is a man named Jack who insists he is President John F. Kennedy (who was nicknamed Jack) claiming to have had his skin dyed black after an assassination attempt and abandoned by Lyndon Johnson in a nursing home. Initially skeptical of Jack&#x27;s story, Elvis does spot a mysterious scar on the back of Jack&#x27;s head, but is ultimately unsure of its origin.

Eventually, Elvis and Jack are forced to face off against a re-animated ancient Egyptian mummy that was stolen during a U.S. museum tour, and then lost during a severe storm in East Texas when the thieves&#x27; bus veered into a river near the nursing home. The mummy takes on the garb of a cowboy and feeds on the souls of the residents of the home. Jack surmises that it feeds at the nursing home because the residents are weak and that nobody will suspect that it is killing them off. It is dubbed &quot;Bubba Ho-Tep&quot; by Elvis, who has a telepathic flashback of the mummy&#x27;s life and death when he looks into its eyes. Due to their age, Jack and Elvis lack mobility and use a motorized wheelchair and a walker to get around the grounds.

Elvis and Jack create an elaborate plan to destroy the mummy. Destruction of the mummy would release the trapped souls of the other inhabitants, and they would be able to go to their final resting place. Elvis and Jack battle the mummy in the middle of the night, with Jack in an electric wheelchair and Elvis wielding a makeshift flamethrower. Jack is knocked out of his wheelchair by the mummy and is about to have his soul devoured; Elvis commandeers the wheelchair and taunts the mummy to draw it off Jack. With the mummy doused, set aflame, fallen on the ground, and burning, Elvis rouses the dying Jack long enough to receive a useless incantation. The mummy standing again, Elvis crashes himself and the wheelchair into the mummy. The two tumble down the riverbank below the bridge; Elvis receiving a deep mortal wound. Resigned to his death, Elvis knocks over the broken sprayer, spilling the rest of the gasoline towards the mummy. He throws a match to relight the mummy, killing it this time.

Elvis lies near the riverbank, dying from the gash and broken ribs. He contemplates that he does not fear death, knowing he still has his soul and has saved everyone at the Shady Rest Retirement Home. Reflecting on this, the stars align into a message for Elvis, saying: &quot;all is well&quot;. Elvis says, &quot;Thank you, thank you very much&quot;, and dies.

==Cast==
* Bruce Campbell as Elvis Presley / Sebastian Haff
* Ossie Davis as John F. &quot;Jack&quot; Kennedy
* Ella Joyce as The Nurse
* Heidi Marnhout as Callie Thomas
* Bob Ivy as Bubba Ho-Tep
* Larry Pennell as Kemosabe
* Daniel Roebuck as Hearse Driver 
* Reggie Bannister as Rest Home Administrator

==Production==
Many of &quot;Bubba Ho-Tep&quot;″s crew also worked on the films in Coscarelli&#x27;s &quot;Phantasm&quot; series. Several actors from the series also have small roles including Heidi Marnhout, Bob Ivy, and Reggie Bannister. Coscarelli kept much of the original short story&#x27;s exposition, but had some difficulty trying to &quot;integrate Elvis&#x27; voice&quot;.

==Critical reception==
Review aggregator Rotten Tomatoes reports a rating of 79% based on 107 reviews, and an average of 6.8/10. The site&#x27;s consensus was a tongue-in-cheek statement, &quot;The best movie to star both the King and JFK.&quot; Metacritic gives it a weighted average rating of 57/100 based on 28 reviews, indicating &quot;mixed or average reviews&quot;.

Peter Travers of &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; gave the film three out of four stars saying, &quot;This absurdly clever caper is elevated by Bruce Campbell&#x27;s pensive Elvis into a moving meditation on the diminutions of age and the vagaries of fame.&quot; Todd McCarthy of &quot;Variety&quot; gave a negative review, stating, &quot;[The] introduction of the mummy plot basically derails the film at about the 45-minute point, and the silly climax...is so rote and generic that it could have come out of any ordinary horror film&quot;, although McCarthy does admit, &quot;Campbell&#x27;s Elvis stands as one of the very best screen interpretations of the King seen thus far, even if he&#x27;s arguably not even playing the real thing.&quot;

Roger Ebert of the &quot;Chicago Sun-Times&quot; gave the film three out of four stars, highlighted the film&#x27;s &quot;delightful wackiness&quot; and stated, &quot;It has the damnedest ingratiating way of making us sit there and grin at its harebrained audacity, laugh at its outhouse humor, and be somewhat moved (not deeply, but somewhat) at the poignancy of these two old men and their situation.&quot;

=== Accolades ===
&quot;Bubba Ho-Tep&quot; won the Bram Stoker Award for Best Screenplay in 2003.

==Proposed sequel==
Coscarelli didn&#x27;t intend to create a sequel to &quot;Bubba Ho-Tep&quot;, and the end credits announcement of a second film entitled &quot;Bubba Nosferatu: Curse of the She-Vampires&quot; was meant as a joke. He changed his mind after the positive reception of the first film and after several people inquired about the sequel. The sequel would center around the production of a &#x27;lost&#x27; Elvis movie from the 1950s or 1960s, and would bring in Paul Giamatti as Colonel Tom Parker.

In 2007 Bruce Campbell reported that he was no longer involved in the sequel, as he and Coscarelli had &quot;a few points [developing the screenplay] that we couldn&#x27;t reconcile&quot; and that he parted ways with the project as a way of keeping his friendship with the director. The project was briefly reported as &quot;dead&quot; by Joe Lansdale in February 2008, but later that same year Giamatti asserted that the film was still alive and that Ron Perlman was interested in taking over the role of Elvis. Due to the amount of time that had passed since the release of &quot;Bubba Ho-Tep&quot;, Coscarelli and Giamatti had trouble raising funding for the film and the movie went back into development hell. However Giamatti reported that they were still trying to get the film made and that they had plans to create a franchise that would include plot lines such as Elvis battling aliens. In 2013 Giamatti confirmed that a script has been written and that it was &quot;really great&quot;, and that he hoped that they would be able to eventually make the film.

Ultimately, Lansdale developed ideas discussed for the follow-up movie into a novella, &quot;Bubba and the Cosmic Bloodsuckers&quot;, published in 2017. This story took place earlier in Elvis&#x27;s life, during a period in which he worked for Colonel Parker battling monsters prior to exchanging identities with Sebastian Haff.

In 2018, IDW Publishing released a five-issue limited series adaptation of the novella, retitled &quot;Bubba Ho-Tep and the Cosmic Blood-Suckers&quot;. The series was supervised by Lansdale, written by Joshua Jabcuga, and illustrated by Tadd Galusha. In 2019, Dynamite Entertainment published a four-issue crossover miniseries, &quot;Army of Darkness/Bubba Ho-Tep&quot;, which followed up the original story and saw Elvis team up with Ash Williams, another character portrayed by Bruce Campbell.

<doc id="817919" wikidata="Q2382780" url="?curid=817919" title="PyQt">
<text>PyQt is a Python binding of the cross-platform GUI toolkit Qt, implemented as a Python plug-in. PyQt is free software developed by the British firm Riverbank Computing. It is available under similar terms to Qt versions older than 4.5; this means a variety of licenses including GNU General Public License (GPL) and commercial license, but not the GNU Lesser General Public License (LGPL). PyQt supports Microsoft Windows as well as various kinds of UNIX, including Linux and MacOS (or Darwin).

PyQt implements around 440 classes and over 6,000 functions and methods including:

* a substantial set of GUI widgets
* classes for accessing SQL databases (ODBC, MySQL, PostgreSQL, Oracle, SQLite)
* QScintilla, Scintilla-based rich text editor widget
* data aware widgets that are automatically populated from a database
* an XML parser
* SVG support
* classes for embedding ActiveX controls on Windows (only in commercial version)

To automatically generate these bindings, Phil Thompson developed the tool SIP, which is also used in other projects.

== History ==
PyQt was first released by Riverbank Computing in 1998.

In August 2009, Nokia sought for the Python binding to be available under the LGPL license. At the time, Nokia owned Qt Software, the developer of QT. After failing to reach an agreement with Riverbank Computing, Nokia released its binding, PySide, providing similar functionality.

==Main components==

PyQt4 contains the following Python modules.

* The &quot;QtCore&quot; module contains the core non-GUI classes, including the event loop and Qt&#x27;s signal and slot mechanism. It also includes platform independent abstractions for Unicode, threads, mapped files, shared memory, regular expressions, and user and application settings.
* The &quot;QtGui&quot; module contains the majority of the GUI classes. These include a number of table, tree and list classes based on the model–view–controller design pattern. Also provided is a sophisticated 2D canvas widget capable of storing thousands of items including ordinary widgets.
* The &quot;QtNetwork&quot; module contains classes for writing UDP and TCP clients and servers. It includes classes that implement FTP and HTTP clients and support DNS lookups. Network events are integrated with the event loop making it very easy to develop networked applications.
* The &quot;QtOpenGL&quot; module contains classes that enable the use of OpenGL in rendering 3D graphics in PyQt applications.
* The &quot;QtSql&quot; module contains classes that integrate with open-source and proprietary SQL databases. It includes editable data models for database tables that can be used with GUI classes. It also includes an implementation of SQLite.
* The &quot;QtSvg&quot; module contains classes for displaying the contents of SVG files. It supports the static features of SVG 1.2 Tiny.
* The &quot;QtXml&quot; module implements SAX and DOM interfaces to Qt&#x27;s XML parser.
* The &quot;QtMultimedia&quot; module implements low-level multimedia functionality. Application developers would normally use the phonon module.
* The &quot;QtDesigner&quot; module contains classes that allow Qt Designer to be extended using PyQt.
* The &quot;Qt&quot; module consolidates the classes contained in all of the modules described above into a single module. This has the advantage that you don&#x27;t have to worry about which underlying module contains a particular class. It has the disadvantage that it loads the whole of the Qt framework, thereby increasing the memory footprint of an application. Whether you use this consolidated module, or the individual component modules is down to personal taste.
* The &quot;uic&quot; module implements support for handling the XML files created by Qt Designer that describe the whole or part of a graphical user interface. It includes classes that load an XML file and render it directly, and classes that generate Python code from an XML file for later execution.
PyQt5 contains the following Python modules:
* QtQml Module
* QtQuick Module
* QtCore Module
* QtGui Module
* QtPrintSupport Module
* QtWidgets Module
* QGLContext Module
* QGLFormat Module
* QGLWidget Module
* QtWebKit Module
* QtWebKitWidgets Module

==Versions==

PyQt version 4 works with both Qt 4 and Qt 5. PyQt version 5 only supports Qt version 5, and drops support for features that are deprecated in Qt 5.

==Hello World example==

The below code written for PyQt6 shows a small window on the screen.
#!/usr/bin/env python3
Here we provide the necessary imports.
The basic GUI widgets are located in QtWidgets module.
import sys
from PyQt6.QtWidgets import QApplication, QWidget

# Every PyQt application must create an application object.
# The application object is located in the QtWidgets module.
app = QApplication([])

# The QWidget widget is the base class of all user interface objects in PyQt.
# We provide the default constructor for QWidget. The default constructor has no parent.
# A widget with no parent is called a window.
root = QWidget()

root.resize(320, 240) # The resize() method resizes the widget.
root.setWindowTitle(&quot;Hello, World!&quot;) # Here we set the title for our window.
root.show() # The show() method displays the widget on the screen.

sys.exit(app.exec()) # Finally, we enter the mainloop of the application.

<doc id="817923" wikidata="Q17011333" url="?curid=817923" title="How Ya Like Me Now">
<text>How Ya Like Me Now is the second solo studio album by American rapper Kool Moe Dee from the Treacherous Three. It was recorded at Battery Studios in London, England and released on November 3, 1987, via Jive Records.

The album was produced by Teddy Riley, Bryan &quot;Chuck&quot; New, LaVaba Mallison, Pete Q. Harris, and Kool Moe Dee. It peaked at No. 35 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200 and No. 4 on the Top R&amp;B/Hip-Hop Albums. It is his best-selling album to date, achieving platinum certification by the RIAA. The album spawned three singles: &quot;How Ya Like Me Now&quot;, &quot;Wild Wild West&quot; and &quot;No Respect&quot;.

== Recording and production ==
Mixing and recording for &quot;How Ya Like Me Now&quot; took place in London at Battery Studios. Alongside Kool Moe Dee, audio production was shared with and handled by Teddy Riley, Bryan &quot;Chuck&quot; New, LaVaba Mallison and Pete Q. Harris, with whom he worked on his previous self-titled album.

On the front cover made by Doug Rowell, Moe Dee takes musical aim at rival rapper LL Cool J, by crushing a red Kangol hat under a front wheel of the Jeep Wrangler in the backdrop. The long running feud began when Kool Moe Dee claimed that LL had stolen his rap style. He also felt that LL was disrespecting rap pioneers like Melle Mel and Grandmaster Caz, by proclaiming that he was &quot;rap&#x27;s new grandmaster&quot; without paying due respect to those who came before him. The feud persisted into the mid-1990s with more songs, and ended with both MCs proclaiming themselves the victor.

The photograph was taken on 4th St in Manhattan between Avenues C and D in Alphabet City, in an empty lot across from the San Isidoro y San Leandro Western Orthodox Catholic Church of the Hispanic Mozarabic Rite. Moe Dee references aspects the neighborhood in lyrics on the album.

== Release and promotion ==
Following &quot;Kool Moe Dee&quot;, &quot;How Ya Like Me Now&quot; was released through Jive Records with distribution by RCA Records, making it Kool Moe Dee&#x27;s second album on the label. It was dropped on November 3, 1987, and was supported by three singles: &quot;How Ya Like Me Now&quot;, &quot;Wild Wild West&quot; and &quot;No Respect&quot;, and its music videos.

Its self-titled single peaked at #22 on the US &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot R&amp;B/Hip-Hop Songs and #86 on the UK Singles Chart. &quot;Wild Wild West&quot; peaked at #62 on the US &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100 and #4 on the US &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot R&amp;B/Hip-Hop Songs. The single &quot;No Respect&quot; did not get into any major music chart.

==Reception==

=== Commercial ===
Reaching a peak position of number thirty-five on the US &quot;Billboard&quot; 200, &quot;How Ya Like Me Now&quot; remained on the chart for a total of 50 weeks. The album has been certified gold by the Recording Industry Association of America on April 14, 1988, and then went platinum on November 14, 1988, indicating US sales of over one million units.

=== Critical ===

In a contemporary review, the &quot;Washington Post&quot; compared the album to work by hip hop artists Schooly D and LL Cool J, stating that Kool Moe Dee &quot;comes across like a hip guidance couselor&quot; and that the album was a &quot;def aural collage: James Brown beats on the title cut, Queen on &quot;Rock You&quot; even Paul Simon on &quot;50 Ways&quot;. The production is sophisticated without sacrificing the improvisational swagger that is central to rap&#x27;s appeal.&quot; American music journalist Robert Christgau described the album as &quot;out-of-kilter swing generated by his electronic percussion [...] - trick rhymes, variable lengths, filters, double tracks, sung refrains, and the occasional extra instrument all work to shift the beat without undercutting its dominance&quot;. Alex Henderson of AllMusic said that Kool Moe Dee &quot;had a major hit with his sophomore effort&quot; and that &quot;it definitely has its share of classics&quot;.

== Accolades ==
In 2017, the album was ranked #35 on &quot;Consequence of Sound&quot; Top 50 Albums of 1987, and #41 of &quot;Complex&quot; 50 Greatest Rap Albums 1980s.

==Legacy==
In 2008, the title track &quot;How Ya Like Me Now&quot; was ranked #31 on VH1&#x27;s 100 Greatest Hip Hop Songs.

In 2017, the song &quot;How Ya Like Me Now&quot; was used in the &quot;Empire&quot; episode &quot;Strange Bedfellows&quot;.

<doc id="817944" wikidata="Q3078573" url="?curid=817944" title="George Campbell Hay">
<text>George Campbell Hay (1915–1984) was a Scottish Symbolist poet and translator, who wrote in Scottish Gaelic, Scots and English. He used the patronymic Deòrsa Mac Iain Dheòrsa. He also wrote poetry in French, Italian and Norwegian, and translated poetry from many languages into Gaelic.

==Life==
He was born in Elderslie, Renfrewshire, and brought up in Tarbert, Kintyre and Argyll, where his father, the novelist John MacDougall Hay, had been born. He was educated at Fettes College (which he despised) and the University of Oxford. He served in the British Army in North Africa, Italy and Macedonia during World War II, a region which featured in much of his work and then lived for a long period in Edinburgh where he worked in the National Library of Scotland.

He was a Scottish nationalist. His life was difficult, with long periods of hard living, including hospitalisation and homelessness.

==Work==
He was a multilingual poet and published three collections between 1947 and 1952: &quot;Fuaran slèibh&quot; (1947), &quot;Wind on Loch Fyne&quot; (1948) and &quot;O na ceithir àirdean&quot; (1952). Some of his poetry was set to music by Francis George Scott.

He was a frequent contributor to &quot;Gairm&quot; magazine, and other Gaelic periodicals. The critic Kurt Wittig suggested Gaelic traits were more evident in his English than his Scots poetry. &quot;Mochtàr is Dùghall&quot;, an unfinished epic about a Highland soldier, and a North African Arab in World War II was published in 1982.

His &quot;Collected Poems and Songs&quot; appeared in 2000, edited by Michel Byrne, and has attracted new attention to his work.

<doc id="817953" wikidata="Q2355101" url="?curid=817953" title="Lyric Suite (Berg)">
<text>The Lyric Suite is a six-movement work for string quartet written by Alban Berg between 1925 and 1926 using methods derived from Arnold Schoenberg&#x27;s twelve-tone technique. Though publicly dedicated to Alexander von Zemlinsky (from whose &quot;Lyric Symphony&quot; it quotes), the work has been shown to possess a &quot;secret dedication&quot; and to outline a &quot;secret programme&quot;.

Berg arranged three of the &quot;pieces&quot; (movements) for string orchestra in 1928.

==Composition and analysis==
The string quartet has six movements:

As Berg&#x27;s friend and fellow Schoenberg pupil Erwin Stein wrote in the preface to the score, &quot;[t]he work (Ist and VIth part, the main part of the IIIrd and the middle section of the Vth) has been mostly written strictly in accordance with Schoenberg&#x27;s technique of the &#x27;Composition with 12 inwardly related tones.&quot; A set of 12 different tones gives the rough material of the composition, and the portions which have been treated more freely still adhere more or less to the technique&quot;. George Perle points out that the first movement is not strictly twelve-tone, with the opening four chords being derived not from the series but from the interval-7 cycle.

The first analysis was undertaken by H. F. Redlich, who notices that &quot;the first movement of the &quot;Lyric Suite&quot; develops out of the disorder of intervals in its first bar, the notes of which, strung out horizontally, present the complete chromatic scale, and from this in the second and following bars, grows the Basic Set in its thematic shape&quot;.

Theodor W. Adorno called the quartet &quot;a latent opera&quot;. Redlich described &quot;the concealed vocality of the &quot;Lyric Suite&quot;&quot; despite having no knowledge of the setting of Baudelaire&#x27;s &quot;De profundis clamavi&quot; in the finale movement, deciphered by Douglass M. Green from what Perle calls &quot;Berg&#x27;s cryptic notations&quot;.

Perle discovered a complete copy of the first edition annotated by Berg for his dedicatee, Hanna Fuchs-Robettin (Franz Werfel&#x27;s sister, with whom Berg had an affair in the 1920s), later that year. Berg used the signature motif, A-B-H-F (in German notation, B means B, while H means B), to combine Alban Berg (A. B.) and Hanna Fuchs-Robettin (H. F.). This is most prominent in the third movement. Berg also quotes a melody from Zemlinsky&#x27;s &quot;Lyric Symphony&quot; in movement four which originally set the words &quot;You are mine own&quot;. In the last movement, according to Berg&#x27;s self-analysis, the &quot;entire material, the tonal element too... as well as the Tristan motif&quot; is developed &quot;by strict adherence to the 12-note series&quot;.

=== I. Allegretto giovale ===
According to René Leibowitz, the first movement is &quot;entirely written in the twelve-tone technique, [it] is a sonata movement without the development. Thus the recapitulation follows directly upon the exposition; but, because of the highly advanced twelve-tone technique of variation, &quot;everything&quot; in this movement is developmental&quot;.

The tone row of the first movement is
:

Pople adds a bar line to group the first and the last six pitches. He also depicts it as:
:

Whenever a given row-form is immediately repeated, a reversed coupling of the hexachords is employed to produce a secondary set. Berg had used the row previously, in 1925, in his first twelve-tone work, his second setting of &quot;Schliesse mir die Augen beide&quot;.

=== III. Allegro misterioso – Trio estatico ===
In the third movement, the outer sections of the &quot;Allegro misterioso&quot; present the same music forwards and then backwards, while the &quot;Trio estatico&quot;, the B section of the ABA, is through-composed. Berg generates a characteristic rhythmic cell through partitioning the series into a seven-note chromatic segment and a complementary five-note motive from the remaining notes.

According to Wolfgang Martin Stroh, the tone row of the third movement is
which can be partitioned into a rising chromatic segment and remaining pitches:

George Perle, gives

Despite assertions by Berg and others, George Perle, however, &quot;had not yet been informed, as Leibowitz and Redlich were by the time they came to write their respective books, that everything in the &#x27;strictly&#x27; dodecaphonic first movement had to be derived from a single serial ordering of the twelve notes of the chromatic scale.&quot; Rather, he, &quot;recognized that the first three chords unfold tetrachordal segments of a single statement of the cycle of fifths (C7), and that at the bottom of the same page, in bars 7–9, the cello presents a linear statement of the same cycle.&quot; The second violin unfolds &quot;the initial tetrachordal segmentation of the perfect-5th cycle,&quot; again at the beginning of the recapitulation. He asks: &quot;How could one [think] of the initial bar as &#x27;disordered&#x27;? If anything is to be designated as an &quot;Urform&quot; here, surely it is this perfect-5th cycle, given its background role in relation to the tone row and other components of the movement.&quot;

=== VI. Largo desolato ===
In the sixth movement, tone row 1 is
:
while tone row 2, derived from tone row 1, is
:

In 1928, Berg arranged the second, third and fourth movements of the &quot;Lyric Suite&quot; for string orchestra. According to Adorno:

<text>Didrik Pining ( 1430 – 1491) was a German privateer, nobleman, and governor of Iceland and Vardøhus.

In 1925, researcher Sofus Larson proposed that Pining may have landed in North America in the 1470s, almost twenty years before Columbus&#x27; voyages of discovery. Some of the claims concerning Pining are controversial because information about him is relatively sparse and partially contradictory.

==Biography==

===Early life===
Didrik Pining has been found by modern German genealogists to have been a native of Hildesheim in Germany, and this has been, according to a report, &quot;suddenly and conclusively proved.&quot; It had been assumed that he was a Dane or Norwegian until the 1930s.

In Hanseatic records until 1468, he is mentioned as a privateer or naval captain in the service of Hamburg, charged with hunting down English merchant ships in the North Atlantic. From 1468 to 1478, he was in the service of Denmark (by 1470 as an &quot;admiral&quot;) first under Christian I of Denmark (ruled 1448–1481), and later for his son, John of Denmark (ruled 1481–1513). Before his employment by the Danes, Pining and his partner Hans Pothorst had also been regarded by the Hanseatic League as &quot;pirates who did much damage to the Hanse towns.&quot; During the later years of the reign of Christian I, Pining and Pothorst are said to have distinguished themselves &quot;not less as capable seamen than as matchless freebooters.&quot;

===Alleged trip to America===
====Sofus Larsen&#x27;s theory====
The theory of the Pining voyage reaching America was published for the first time by Sofus Larsen of the University of Copenhagen in his book &quot;The Discovery of North America Twenty Years Before Columbus&quot; in 1925. Larsen based his claims on various sources (mainly three) which had no immediately apparent connection. Pining was according to Larsen appointed leader of an expedition to the north towards Greenland in the early 1470s. He, together with Hans Pothorst (also from Hildesheim), and the Portuguese explorers João Vaz Corte-Real and Álvaro Martins, were said to have been the principals in the expedition. The navigator was supposedly the semi-mythical figure named John Scolvus. According to Larsen, the mission likely started off from Bergen, went on through to Iceland and Greenland, and eventually discovered &quot;Terra do Bacalhau&quot;, the &quot;Land of Codfish&quot;, later presumed to be Newfoundland or Labrador. While it is known that Pining and Corte-Real were respectively appointed governors of Iceland (1478) and the Azores (1474), these appointments were according to Larsen a reward for having discovered the Land of Codfish.

====General research====
Larsen&#x27;s claims have enjoyed strong scholarly and public support in Scandinavia and Portugal, but they have been more disputed among German scholars. Reception of the account by American and English historians has generally ranged from ridicule to acceptance of the plausibility of at least part of it. Many further circumstances are known to support the theory, although it is generally concluded that the theory is &quot;not proven&quot; (nor sufficiently &quot;disproven&quot;), with any possible &quot;final proof&quot; lacking.

Regardless, no sources explicitly support that Pining and Pothorst had any connections with the journey by Corte-Real, nor that they reached North America (excluding Greenland). What is known however, is that Pining and Pothorst were sent out by a royal Danish order to find out which of several possible policies concerning trade in Iceland should be developed, in which settlements and harbours. Pining&#x27;s orders further included investigating what formerly, in the 11th century, had been called the &quot;regiones finitimae&quot; (i.e. &quot;the coasts opposite those still-remembered but obsolete settlements in Greenland&quot;). In 1476, they made this trip, which likely went to Greenland, where they were reported to have encountered hostile Inuit, and no Norse people. The location they visited is assumed by some to have been around Angmagssalik. Nothing specific suggests it went further west than this.

===Later years===
In 1478, Didrik Pining became the governor (&quot;höfuðsmaðr&quot;) of Iceland, serving until 1481, when he is mentioned as having &quot;fared out of Iceland.&quot; He replaced the former governor Thorleif Björnsson, whose struggle to marry his own cousin Ingvild was supported by Pining. The following year, Thorleif gave Pining silver and a horn of walrus ivory to pay the king for a license for his union. The agreement was constituted in 1484, merging two of Iceland&#x27;s most fortunate political dynasties. In the same year, there came complaints of Pining and his men having raped women and stolen money from farmers. In 1481, Pining was present at the funeral of Danish king Christian I. He also made state visits of homage to Bergen and Copenhagen, became knighted in Norway, and employed his personal coat of arms which featured a grappling hook. Some years later, in 1489 and 1490, he is again described as &quot;governor (&quot;hirdstjore&quot;) over the whole of Iceland&quot; in two Icelandic laws or edicts (the so-called Pining&#x27;s Laws). A later chronicler says about him that &quot;he was in many ways a serviceable man and put many things right that were wrong.&quot; His godson and nephew, Didrik Pining the Younger, succeeded him in 1490, and was governor for the two following years.

Pining, together with Hans Pothorst, patrolled North Atlantic waters and played prominent roles in the Anglo-Danish Naval War (1484–90). Around 1484, he captured, off the coast of England or Brittany and in the Spanish Sea, three Spanish or Portuguese ships which he brought to King John of Denmark in Copenhagen. He accompanied John to Bergen in 1486 as admiral of the royal fleet. In 1487, he led a fleet to the island of Gotland in the Baltic Sea, and secured it for Denmark. In a treaty concluded between John of Denmark and the Dutch in 1490, it is, however, expressly stated that Didrik Pining (and another admiral named Bartold Busch) were to be excluded from the peace. He was then also spoken of as a lord of Iceland. In the same year, Pining was appointed governor of Vardøhus, and may thus have been commander-in-chief of the seas and lands in northern waters.

Didrik Pining likely died (was possibly killed) around Finnmark or the North Cape in 1491. In the &quot;Skibby Chronicle&quot;, Pining (and Pothorst) are mentioned among many pirates who &quot;met with a miserable death, being either slain by their friends or hanged on the gallows or drowned in the waves of the sea,&quot; although this has been disputed by some modern historians.

==Later references==
In a letter to Christian III of Denmark in 1551, the mayor of Kiel, Carsten Griep, sent the king two maps of the north Atlantic made during the expeditions of Pining and Pothorst, &quot;who were sent out by your majesty&#x27;s royal grandfather King Christian the First, at the request of his majesty of Portugal, with certain ships to explore new countries and islands in the north, have raised on the rock &quot;Wydthszerck&quot;, lying off Greenland and towards &quot;Sniefeldsiekel&quot; in Iceland on the sea, a great sea-mark on account of the Greenland pirates (presumably Inuit).&quot;
Olaus Magnus wrote in 1555 that Pining and Pothorst, due to their piracy, had &quot;by the Nordic kings been excluded from all human contact and declared outlaws, as a result of their extremely violent robberies and numerous cruel acts against all sailors that they could catch, whether close or distant.&quot; They then took refuge at a cliff called Hvidserken, which apparently was located between Iceland and Greenland. Magnus added that in &quot;1494&quot;, the pirates created a giant compass out of a considerable circular space at the top of the cliff, with rings and lines formed of lead, to make it easier for them to know in which direction they could seek a great plunder. Modern historians have suggested that they may in fact have set up some mark at the coast of Greenland to reclaim it for the Danish king.

In 1625, a report from London talks about Pining and Pothorst (&quot;Punnus&quot; and &quot;Potharse&quot;) and states that Pining &quot;gave the Islanders their Lawes,&quot; referred to later as Pining&#x27;s Law, the written Icelandic law.

<text>Project X was a short-lived hardcore punk/youth crew band from New York City, and also the name of their only release, being a five-track EP. The band consisted of members of other prominent NYC hardcore bands Gorilla Biscuits, Youth of Today, Side by Side and Judge.

The record had a pressing of 500, and according to the band&#x27;s bio on Bridge Nine Records&#x27; website, the majority of the records sold out at a gig in Connecticut. The record was out of print for 18 years (although it was illegally bootlegged more than once during that time), but was finally re-released in 2005 on Bridge Nine Records.

The 7-inch remained Project X&#x27;s only recorded output. So when Porcelly as a joke put &quot;Project X – The Edge of Quarrel LP&quot; on his Maximum RocknRoll playlist during a San Francisco visit, record collectors began searching high and low for this fabled LP, but alas, it never existed. The band did however write one song that was only performed live, &quot;Can&#x27;t Keep Me Down&quot;. Later the lyrics were changed, and it became the Youth of Today song &quot;Live Free&quot; on the band&#x27;s &quot;We&#x27;re Not in This Alone&quot; album.

The band played few shows, estimated as low as five. These included some on the east coast of the United States, including Irving Plaza, and a few during Youth of Today&#x27;s European tour in 1989. The band played again a couple of times in 2015 while touring with Gorilla Biscuits.

<doc id="817969" wikidata="Q689373" url="?curid=817969" title="Moral Re-Armament">
<text>Moral Re-Armament (MRA) was an international moral and spiritual movement that, in 1938, developed from American minister Frank Buchman&#x27;s Oxford Group. Buchman headed MRA for 23 years until his death in 1961. In 2001, the movement was renamed Initiatives of Change.

==History==
===Beginning===
In 1922, Frank Buchman left his teaching position at the Hartford Seminary Foundation to pursue a ministry focused on individual spiritual transformation and global evangelism. His tenets focused on the &#x27;Four Absolutes&#x27; which were absolute honesty, absolute purity, absolute unselfishness, and absolute love. This approach emphasized divine guidance, adherence to moral principles, and personal interaction as catalysts for change.

Buchman relocated his activities to Princeton University, where student discussions he organized included public confessions of sexual activities. The discussions generated controversy, resulting in university president John Hibben banning Buchman from campus. He subsequently gained support at the University of Oxford in England, where the movement became known as the Oxford Group. The Oxford Group held increasingly popular conferences across multiple countries, attracting thousands of participants. These gatherings served as platforms to disseminate the group&#x27;s philosophy.

The Oxford Groupers or Buchmanites were rebranded in 1938 when Buchman launched Moral Re-Armament. &quot;The crisis is fundamentally a moral one,&quot; he said. &quot;The nations must re-arm morally. Moral recovery is essentially the forerunner of economic recovery. Moral recovery creates not crisis but confidence and unity in every phase of life.&quot;

The phrase caught the mood of the time, and many public figures in Britain spoke and wrote in support. British tennis star H. W. Austin edited the book &quot;Moral Rearmament (The Battle for Peace)&quot;, which sold half a million copies. In 1940, the novelist Daphne du Maurier published &quot;Come Wind, Come Weather&quot;, stories of ordinary Britons who had found hope and new life through MRA. She dedicated it to &quot;Frank Buchman, whose initial vision made possible the world of the living characters in these stories.&quot; The book sold 650,000 copies in Britain alone.

===World War II===

When World War II started, many of those active in the campaign for Moral Re-Armament joined the Allied forces. MRA did try unsuccessfully to obtain exemptions from military service for its members. 

When MRA was established in the United States in 1941, it was considered by some to be an effective way to combat communism. Senator (later President) Harry Truman, Chair of the Senate&#x27;s Truman Committee investigating war contracts, told a Washington press conference in 1943: &quot;Suspicions, rivalries, apathy, greed lie behind most of the bottlenecks. This is where the Moral Re-Armament group comes in. Where others have stood back and criticized, they have rolled up their sleeves and gone to work.&quot; Truman supported the work of the MRA throughout the war, with his longtime aid, John R. Steelman, stating the MRA &quot;as the greatest single force in the nation for reconciliation.&quot; Truman supported the MRA-produced play &quot;The Forgotten Factor&quot;, calling it &quot;the most important play produced by the war.&quot;

Buchman and the MRA faced criticism for Buchman&#x27;s pro-Nazism and Anti-semitic statement, &quot;I thank heaven for a man like Adolf Hitler, who built a front-line of defense against the anti-Christ of Communism. My barber in London told me Hitler saved all Europe from Communism. That’s how he felt. Of course, I don’t condone everything the Nazis do. Anti-Semitism? Bad, naturally. I suppose Hitler sees a Karl Marx in every Jew.&quot; He continued, &quot;But think what it would mean to the world if Hitler surrendered to God. Or Mussolini. Or any dictator. Through such a man God could control a nation overnight and solve every last, bewildering problem.&quot; The quote caused the MRA to have problems recruiting members.

Buchman also supported a theocratic fascist state to defeat communism, &quot;Spain has taught us what godless Communism will bring. Human problems aren’t economic. They’re moral, and they can’t be solved by immoral measures. They could be solved within a God-controlled democracy, or perhaps I should say a theocracy, and they could be solved through a God-controlled Fascist dictatorship.&quot;

===Post-war===
When the war concluded, the MRA continued their mission on anti-communism and fighting the moral evils in conjunction with their theological beliefs.

In 1946, 50 Swiss families active in the work of MRA bought and restored a large, derelict hotel at Caux, Switzerland. This became a centre of European reconciliation, attended by thousands in the following years, including German Chancellor Konrad Adenauer and French Foreign Minister Robert Schuman. Buchman was awarded the Croix de Chevalier of the Légion d&#x27;honneur by the French Government, and also the German Grand Cross of the Order of Merit. The historians Douglas Johnston and Cynthia Sampson described the work as an &quot;important contribution to one of the greatest achievements in the entire record of modern statecraft: the astonishingly rapid Franco-German reconciliation after 1945.&quot;

In Britain, hundreds donated money for the purchase of the Westminster Theatre in London, as a living memorial to the men and women of Moral Re-Armament who had died in war service. Many servicemen gave their gratuities. For the next 50 years, the theatre presented a host of plays and musicals. The theatre was successfully, but the plays were bias to the MRA&#x27;s societal beliefs which struggled to stay relevant through the decades.

In France, the well-known existentialist Catholic philosopher Gabriel Marcel edited a book, &quot;Un Changement d&#x27;Espérance à la Rencontre du Réarmament Moral&quot;, which brings together the stories of a French socialist leader, a Brazilian docker, an African chief, a Buddhist abbot, a Canadian industrialist, and many others who found a new approach through MRA. The English edition, published by Longman, was titled &quot;Fresh Hope for the World&quot;.

MRA began holding conferences on Mackinac Island, Michigan, in 1942, first at The Island House, rehabilitating it and much of the nearby grounds. They then purchased the abandoned Mission House hotel and adjacent property on the island&#x27;s east end. The lease was temproarily blocked by the Michigan Attorney General office causing greater scrutiny on the organization before the deal was eventually passed. Between 1954 and 1960, they constructed an extensive training center there, including a theatre and a soundstage. The soundstage was used for the production of motion pictures, including &quot;The Crowning Experience&quot;, &quot;Voice of the Hurricane&quot;, and &quot;Decision at Midnight&quot;. In 1966, MRA deeded much of the property on the island to Mackinac College. The property later became Mission Point Resort, a summer resort hotel.

===Global spread===

In the 1950s and 1960s, MRA&#x27;s work expanded across the globe. Buchman was a pioneer in multi-faith initiatives. As he said, &quot;MRA is the good road of an ideology inspired by God upon which all can unite. Catholic, Jew and Protestant, Hindu, Muslim, Buddhist and Confucianist – all find they can change, where needed, and they can travel along this good road together.&quot;

These ideas appealed to many in the African and Asian countries, which were then moving towards independence from colonial rule. Leaders of these independence struggles have paid tribute to MRA for helping to bring about unity between groups in conflict, and for helping to ease the transition to independence. In 1956, King Mohammed V of Morocco sent a message to Buchman: &quot;I thank you for all you have done for Morocco in the course of these last testing years. Moral Re-Armament must become for us Muslims as much an incentive as it is for you Christians and for all nations.&quot; In 1960, Archbishop Makarios and Dr Kucuk, President and vice-president of Cyprus, jointly sent the first flag of independent Cyprus to Frank Buchman at Caux in recognition of MRA&#x27;s help.

In 2001, the MRA movement changed its name to Initiatives of Change (IofC).

===Criticism===
Buchman and the MRA faced criticism for his views on Hitler, Naziism, and fascism. 

In 1951, the Catholic Church ordered its members not to join the MRA because it supported the heresy of illuminism. The organization was criticized by Radio Moscow Overseas Service for its anticommunist ideals, in November 1952 saying, &quot;Moral Re-Armament supplants the inevitable class war by the &#x27;permanent struggle between good and evil&#x27;,&quot; and &quot;has the power to attract radical revolutionary minds.&quot;

The MRA has been described as a &quot;ineffective cult&quot; with absolutes that were naïve, impossible to fulfill, and overly dependent on personal revelations. Actress Glenn Close, whose parents were part of the movement, publicly called the organization a cult.

==In the media==
The group is also mentioned in Raymond Chandler&#x27;s book &quot;Farewell, My Lovely&quot;. A cop says to Philip Marlowe: &quot;I think we gotta make this little world all over again. Now take Moral Rearmament. There you&#x27;ve got something. M. R. A. There you&#x27;ve got something, baby.&quot;

In the music video for Smile Empty Soul&#x27;s 2003 single &quot;Bottom of The Bottle,&quot; lead singer Sean Danielsen is seen wearing a T-shirt with the slogan &quot;And God said unto thee, MRA.&quot;

In the 2006 Sue Grafton novel &quot;S is for Silence,&quot; one of the points of contention between two main characters is adherence to the principles of Moral Re-Armament. “I was the Moral Re-Armament princess,” Kathy says, reflecting on her teen years.

<text>Blacklisted was an American hardcore punk band from Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. They have toured North America, Europe, Australia, New Zealand, and Japan.

==History==
The band formed in the early 2000s, and comprised George Hirsch (vocals), Jon Nean (guitar), Tim Smith (bass), and Zach Trotta (drums). The band self-released their debut self-titled 7-inch EP in 2003. This led to a deal with the Stillborn label, and another EP, &quot;Our Youth Is Wasted&quot;. Pepito left to form Reign Supreme. The band then recorded a series of split releases for the Deathwish label, who also reissued the band&#x27;s first two releases together as &quot;We&#x27;re Unstoppable&quot;, described by PopMatters as &quot;a furiously brief dose of old-school punk and hardcore dissonance&quot;. The band&#x27;s release, &quot;No One Deserves To Be Here More Than Me&quot;, featured a stylistic turn to an early 90s grunge sound, abandoning most of the speed and favoring heavy, repetitive grooves.

In November 2013, Blacklisted frontman George Hirsch released an acoustic solo album titled &quot;There&#x27;s Honey In the Soil So We Wait for the Till&quot; under the moniker Harm Wülf.

Blacklisted began writing a fourth studio album and follow up to 2009&#x27;s &quot;No One Deserves To Be Here More Than Me&quot; in late 2013. Their fourth studio album titled &quot;When People Grow, People Go&quot; was produced by Will Yip and was released in February 2015 through Deathwish. The album&#x27;s sound is a mix of Blacklisted&#x27;s style on the experimental album &quot;No One Deserves To Be Here More Than Me&quot; with the style on the hardcore album &quot;Heavier Than Heaven, Lonelier Than God&quot;.

In 2023, the band announced a reunion co-headlining show with the newly reunited Unbroken at the First Unitarian Church in Philadelphia with support from Damnation A.D, Entry, and Crashing Forward. This show sold out in under a minute, therefore, a second night was added with support from Indecision, Magnitude, and Scarab.

<text>Frances Hyland (April 25, 1927 – July 11, 2004) was a Canadian stage, film and television actress. She earned recognition for roles on stage (including ten seasons with Stratford Festival) and screen (including her performance as Nanny Louisa on &quot;Road to Avonlea&quot;). Honoured with the Governor General&#x27;s Performing Arts Award in 1994, she was called &quot;the first lady of Canadian theatre&quot;.

==Early life and education==
Hyland was born in 1927 in Shaunavon, Saskatchewan, a small town south-west of Swift Current, to Jessie (née Worden), a teacher, and Thomas Hyland, a salesman. She lived there until her parents divorced when she was one year old. She was raised by her mother&#x27;s family in Ogema, Saskatchewan. When she was seven, she moved to Regina when her parents tried, and failed, to save their marriage. She had no relationship with her father after 1937.

Hyland&#x27;s dreams were clouded because her family did not have a great deal of money, but she always believed that she could achieve her dreams. . As did her mother, who put herself through teacher&#x27;s college in order to support her daughter&#x27;s education and acting career 

Thus Hyland graduated in 1948 from the University of Saskatchewan with a BA in English. She earned a scholarship to and graduated from the prestigious Royal Academy of Dramatic Art (RADA) in London England where she won a silver medal for merit in passing her exams. 

== Career ==
After graduating from the Royal Academy, Hyland remained in London, and made her professional debut on London&#x27;s West End, starring as Stella in Tennessee William&#x27;s acclaimed A Streetcar Named Desire.

In 1954, Hyland was invited by the renowned theater director Tyrone Guthrie to open his first season of Canada&#x27;s Stratford Festival, playing Isabella in Shakespeare&#x27;s &quot;Measure for Measure.&quot; She went on to perform at the festival through the next ten seasons. Her roles included Portia (in &quot;The Merchant of Venice&quot;), Olivia (in &quot;Twelfth Night&quot;), Perdita (in &quot;The Winter&#x27;s Tale&quot;), Desdemona (in &quot;Othello&quot;) and Ophelia opposite Christopher Plummer in an acclaimed production of Hamlet. 

Hyland directed the Stratford Festival&#x27;s 1979 production of &quot;Othello&quot;. She also performed with the Shaw Festival and on Broadway (opposite Tony Perkins in &quot;Look Homeward, Angel&quot;).

On television, Hyland co-starred in the Canadian television series &quot;The Albertans&quot; and played Nanny Louisa on &quot;Road to Avonlea.&quot;

As the leading Shakespearean actress in Canada, Hyland also used her position to champion Canadian actors&#x27; campaign for higher status and pay.

Hyland married George McCowan, a fellow Canadian actor and director. They had a son, Evan, in 1957. The couple separated shortly after.

==Death==
On Sunday, July 11, 2004, Hyland was admitted to St. Michael&#x27;s Hospital in Toronto, Canada for respiratory failure from complications of a prior appendix surgery. She was pronounced deceased the following day by her son.
== Awards and honours ==
In 1970, Hyland was appointed an Officer of the Order of Canada. In 1994, Hyland received the Governor General&#x27;s Performing Arts Award, Canada&#x27;s highest honour in the performing arts, for her lifetime contribution to Canadian theatre.

<doc id="817996" wikidata="Q1810871" url="?curid=817996" title="Liquid Sky">
<text>Liquid Sky is a 1982 American independent science fiction film directed by Slava Tsukerman and starring Anne Carlisle and Paula E. Sheppard. It debuted at the Montreal Film festival in August 1982 and was well received at several film festivals thereafter. It was produced with a budget of $500,000. It became the most successful independent film of 1983, grossing $1.7 million worldwide.

The film is seen as heavily influencing a club scene that emerged in the early 2000s in Brooklyn, Berlin, Paris, and London called electroclash.

==Plot==
A New Wave fashion show is being held in a crowded Manhattan nightclub. Among the models are bisexual, cocaine-addicted Margaret and her similarly cocaine-addicted nemesis Jimmy. Margaret&#x27;s drug-dealing girlfriend, Adrian, is constantly hassled by Jimmy because he does not have the money to pay for more drugs.

A small frisbee-shaped UFO lands on the roof of the penthouse apartment occupied by Margaret and Adrian. Jimmy accompanies Margaret home before the show, trying to find Adrian&#x27;s drugs. Margaret and Jimmy return to the club to participate in the show. During preparations, both agree to a photo shoot the following night on Margaret&#x27;s rooftop. Margaret is subsequently raped by a man she meets in the nightclub.

German scientist Johann Hoffman has been secretly observing the aliens from the Empire State Building. Johann needs somewhere to continue his surveillance when the observation deck closes. He seeks help from the only person he knows in the U.S., college drama teacher Owen, who is on his way to meet a former student. Johann shows him a photo of the alien, which looks like a retina. Seeking a vantage point on his own, Johann stumbles into Sylvia&#x27;s building. Sylvia, who is Jimmy&#x27;s mother, invites him to her apartment for dinner. Across town, Katherine states her objection to the heroin use of her boyfriend, failed writer and addict Paul.

Margaret is seduced by Owen, her former acting professor. Owen, after having sex with Margaret, dies, and a translucent crystal protrudes from his head. She removes it, revealing no blood, and when completely free of the wound, it evaporates into thin air.

Adrian returns to the penthouse and discovers Owen&#x27;s corpse, but she is not bothered. Adrian decides to lead a hell-themed wake for Owen. In a bout of psychopathic narcissism and necrophelia, Adrian mounts Owen&#x27;s face and climaxes while Margaret watches, pleading for her to stop. A fight ensues, and Adrian draws a switchblade on Margaret. They struggle over control of the knife and eventually give up. Adrian then puts Owen&#x27;s body in a cardboard box and drags it onto the roof where she comforts Margaret, saying they will leave the body behind and depart for Berlin; she leaves to retrieve food for dinner.

While out at the liquor store, Adrian is confronted by Johann, who attempts to warn her, but is snubbed by a paranoid Adrian, who is convinced Johann is a cop. While Margaret is alone in the apartment, Paul, Adrian&#x27;s client, returns. When Paul tries to rape her, she vengefully kills him by forcing him to climax, realizing everyone she has sex with dies.

From Sylvia&#x27;s apartment, Johann continues his observation between dinner and dodging Sylvia&#x27;s attempts to seduce him. Adrian arrives home and they prepare a rotisserie chicken and potatoes in aluminum pans on their bed. They are interrupted when the crew arrives at the apartment for the fashion shoot.

During the shoot, Margaret is taunted by Jimmy and the crew, so she forces him to have oral sex with her, knowing it will kill him, which it does, baffling everyone (some of whom leave). Adrian, confronted by this anomalous death, antagonizes Margaret into having sex with her, to prove her wrong while playing into her egotistic complex of dominance over the submissive Margaret, who pleads with her not to. Margaret is then held down by the stylist and her companion while Adrian rapes Margaret, achieving climax; she then disappears.

Margaret unplugs all the lights, and applies glow make up while she rants about her identity, upbringing, society, and the culture of 1980s Manhattan. She then goes back to the club and sees the strange man who raped her, and convinces him to go back with her to her apartment, as he is thrilled by her newfound deadly prowess.

Margaret has sex with the date rapist; his body disappears afterwards. She then looks out the window and speaks to the invisible entity &quot;Indian&quot; that she associates with the deaths, and she puts on a white gown. After witnessing the deaths through the window in Sylvia&#x27;s apartment, Johann goes across the street to Margaret&#x27;s apartment.

Johann reveals that the alien in the UFO is extracting endorphins produced by the brain when an orgasm occurs. Margaret survived because she never experienced an orgasm. Margaret stabs Johann to death, which Sylvia witnesses through a telescope. Seeing the alien craft leaving, Margaret injects herself with heroin to induce a wild autoerotic orgasm to ensure the aliens take her with them.

Sylvia and Katherine arrive at the apartment together and reach the penthouse in time to see Margaret getting abducted by the aliens. The UFO floats off into outer space.

==Production==
&quot;Liquid Sky&quot; was an adaption and formation from a previous script titled &quot;Sweet Sixteen&quot; from director Slava Tsukerman. After not being able to fund the script, Tsukerman knew he needed to write a new script that would be producible. His wife, Nina V. Kerova, had been writing scripts based on a woman who could not orgasm. He had an idea for a movie about aliens from outer space. He and his wife started collaborating; because of language barriers and American speech, they hired friend &amp; co-writer Anne Carlisle to help them write the script. After the three writers collaborated over dinner one night, the title &quot;Liquid Sky&quot; was born.

&quot;Liquid Sky&quot; was produced and directed by Slava Tsukerman, who, prior to making &quot;Liquid Sky&quot;, had had a successful career as a documentary and TV film director in the USSR and Israel. The screenplay was written by Tsukerman, his wife and ubiquitous co-producer Nina V. Kerova, and Anne Carlisle, who also enacted the film&#x27;s two leading roles. The director of photography, Yuri Neyman, a Russian émigré, was also the film&#x27;s special effects expert. Anne Carlisle also wrote a novel based on the film in 1987.

Although the film is loosely centered around early 1980s punk subculture, the film&#x27;s score uses a series of strident synthesizer music pieces. The music was composed by Slava Tsukerman, Clive Smith and Brenda Hutchinson using the Fairlight CMI. Most of it was original, but included interpretations of Baroque composer Marin Marais&#x27;s &quot;Sonnerie de Ste-Geneviève du Mont-de-Paris&quot;, Carl Orff&#x27;s &quot;Trionfo di Afrodite&quot;, and Anthony Philip Heinrich&#x27;s &quot;Laurel Waltz&quot;. All of these were orchestrated in a series of ominous, dissonant arrangements and nightmarish marches. Excerpts from &quot;Beautiful Bend&quot; by Boris Midney are also featured.

==Release==
===Home media===
The film was digitally restored in 4K resolution in 2017 by Vinegar Syndrome, and released as a Blu-ray/DVD combo pack on April 24, 2018.

==Filming==
&quot;Liquid Sky&quot; was shot without any major actors, large funding, or even permits. It was shot in several downtown New York City locations.

==Cinematography==
Yuri Neyman, A.S.C., is both the cinematographer and special effects director for Liquid Sky. Director Slava Tsukerman, cinematographer Yuri Neyman, and Production Designer Marina Levikova worked closely together to create the distinct, unique cinematic look and vivid feel of Liquid Sky. The overall look and feel of the film was inspired by German Expressionism and Bertolt Brecht. At the time, &quot;punk&quot; was not well known. The crew and cinematographer knew that they needed to &quot;create&quot; a feel and look for &quot;punk&quot;. The cinematography in &quot;Liquid Sky&quot; is a form of expressionism. The film was shot to make you feel the emotions of the characters, expressed through powerful light, colors, contrast, composition, and movement. The reality of the cinematography is a world expressed and painted with emotion rather than practicality. All three department heads were successful filmmakers from the USSR who discovered filmmaking in their teenage years. The cinematography was well received by the community and filmmakers. In a 1984 February issue of &quot;American Cinematographer&quot;, reviewers of &quot;Liquid Sky&quot; cinematography were quoted as saying it is &quot;the picture&#x27;s asset&quot; and &quot;On its simplest level, it could be just as satisfying to be watched with its sound off, as a spectacular work of moving art.&quot; The magazine would go as far as to comment &quot;New York has never been photographed better before.&quot;
The film was shot on 35mm film and had an aspect ratio of 1.85:1. It was re-released in 2017 with 4K master restore to digital.

==Sound design==

To create unusual sounds by manipulating real-world sounds, director Slava Tsukerman chose to use a digital sampling synthesizer known as the Fairlight CMI. Brenda Hutchinson and Clive Smith were the music composers for the soundtrack. During the process, Tsukerman brought over three or four classical music pieces that would be programmed into the Fairlight CMI. Much like a computer, every sound and every note would be programmed with a code. When composing, Tsukerman would tap a rhythm or hum a melody, and Hutchinson and Smith would play around with ideas on the Fairlight. Percussion sounds were used throughout the movie. Tsukerman often rejected re-recording a tape when not perfect, loving the rawness of the imperfections. He was quoted as saying &quot;No, I like it. Let’s make it quick and dirty.&quot; During foley and sound design, materials such as wind chimes, metal, glass, and wood were used to create the sounds of the alien creatures. While composing, Smith never saw a visual from the film. He did not see his work integrated with the visuals until the premiere. He created music and sound solely from what Tsukerman communicated to him. He said that he and Hutchinson were the composers, but that Tsukerman had the vision.

==Reception==

J. Hoberman of The New York Times wrote: &quot;On &quot;Variety&quot;’s top-grossing film chart for over half a year, &quot;Liquid Sky&quot; was perhaps the most successful independent film of its day&quot;.

===Critical reception===
On review aggregator website Rotten Tomatoes, the film holds an approval rating of 93%, based on 27 reviews, and an average rating of 7.2/10.

===Awards===
* Montreal World Film Festival – First Jury Award
* Sydney Film Festival – Audience Award
* Cartagena Film Festival – Special Jury Prize for Visual Impact
* Brussels International Film Festival – Special Prize of the Jury
* Cinemanila International Film Festival – Special Jury Prize

==Sequel==
In a 2014 interview with &quot;The Awl,&quot; Slava Tsukerman confirmed that he intended to make a sequel, &quot;Liquid Sky 2&quot;; with Anne Carlisle returning in the role of Margaret.

As of 2020, however, the script had still not been completed, Tsukerman claiming that Carlisle was returning to New York to work with him on it.

== Novelization ==
Anne Carlisle wrote a novel &quot;Liquid Sky&quot; based on the screenplay of the movie. It was published as a Dolphin (Doubleday) paperback in 1987.

<text>Double Jeopardy is a 1999 American crime adventure drama thriller film directed by Bruce Beresford, and starring Ashley Judd, Tommy Lee Jones, and Bruce Greenwood. Released on September 24, the film received mixed reviews from critics and grossed $177 million.

== Plot ==
Libby and Nick Parsons are wealthy residents of Whidbey Island, Washington. Libby&#x27;s friend Angela watches their four-year-old son, Matty, so they can spend a romantic weekend sailing. Libby awakens after a night of lovemaking below the boat&#x27;s deck to find blood everywhere and Nick missing. The Coast Guard arrive, after receiving a call from Nick who claims to have been stabbed, and finds Libby on the boat holding a bloody knife.

Although Nick&#x27;s body is not found, Libby is convicted of murder. Her motive is assumed to be a $2 million life insurance policy and her alleged knowledge that Nick was under investigation for embezzlement. Libby asks Angela to adopt Matty and care for him while she is in prison. When Angela unexpectedly stops bringing Matty to prison to visit Libby, Libby tracks Angela to San Francisco (all via the prison&#x27;s pay phone) and calls her. During their conversation, Nick enters Angela&#x27;s apartment and Matty calls out, &quot;Daddy!&quot;; Libby immediately realizes that Nick is alive and had faked his death. 

After Libby tries and fails to have Nick&#x27;s insurer look into his death, Margaret, a fellow inmate and former lawyer, advises her to get paroled by good behavior and by falsely claiming remorse to the parole board for &quot;killing&quot; Nick. Once free, Margaret tells her, Libby can kill Nick with impunity due to the Double Jeopardy Clause in the US Constitution, meaning that she cannot be convicted of the same murder twice.

After six years in prison, Libby is paroled to a halfway house under the supervision of parole officer Travis Lehman, a former law professor whose wife and daughter left him due to his alcoholism. To search for Nick, Libby violates curfew and is caught breaking into Matty&#x27;s old school on Whidbey Island to get Angela&#x27;s records, as Angela had been an administrator there. As Lehman is taking Libby back to prison, she drives his car off a ferry in Puget Sound, grabs his gun, and swims to shore. She then goes to her mother, who gives her cash and a pickup truck.

Libby obtains Angela&#x27;s new address in Colorado but learns from a neighbor that Angela died three years earlier in a explosion caused by a natural gas leak. An archived newspaper photo of Angela at a gallery reveals a painting by Wassily Kandinsky that previously hung in Nick&#x27;s home. Libby traces him to New Orleans. Lehman almost catches her at the gallery, but she escapes. In New Orleans, she finds Nick running a small luxury hotel under the alias &quot;Jonathan Devereaux&quot;.

Libby confronts Nick during a fund-raising auction at his hotel and demands he return Matty in exchange for her leaving him for good. Nick claims to her that he faked his death to avoid prison and to provide her and Matty with the insurance money, not believing she would be convicted, and says that Angela&#x27;s death was accidental. Libby scoffs at his apparent lies. During their conversation, Lehman arrives at the hotel, and Libby slips out. Lehman informs &quot;Jonathan&quot; that Libby believes he is her supposedly dead ex-husband and informs the local police that she is in the area.

Libby arranges to meet Nick at Lafayette Cemetery to get Matty. Nick has a local boy lure her into one of the mausoleums, where he attacks her and tries to bury her alive. She frees herself, but he manages to escape. Meanwhile, Lehman is in &quot;Jonathan&#x27;s&quot; office and notices the Kandinsky artwork Libby was searching for in the gallery. Now unsure of Libby&#x27;s guilt, Lehman contacts his boss and asks him to fax over a photocopy of Nicholas Parsons&#x27; driver&#x27;s license.

Lehman intercepts Libby and she breaks down sobbing. He goes to Nick&#x27;s hotel and reveals to Nick that he knows Nick&#x27;s true identity. After Lehman agrees to take a $1 million bribe for his silence but expresses concern that Libby could blow their deal, Nick states that Libby would not be a concern, joking that he has &quot;buried&quot; that problem. Libby then enters the room with Lehman&#x27;s gun and both she and Lehman tell Nick that she can kill him with impunity due to the double jeopardy law. After Nick says where Matty is — at a boarding school in Georgia — Lehman reveals he had recorded Nick&#x27;s confession to burying Libby and plays it back to Nick. Nick pulls a gun, quickly shooting and wounding Lehman. In the ensuing struggle, Nick is about to shoot Lehman again, but Libby kills him. Lehman insists they return to Washington to win her pardon. They later find Matty at the boarding school, where he immediately recognizes his mother, and they embrace.

== Production ==
After Michelle Pfeiffer, Meg Ryan and Brooke Shields all declined the role, Jodie Foster was attached to star in the film as Libby Parsons and Bruce Beresford met with her several times about the script:

She said to me once, when we were having... not an argument, we had different points of view over something, and she said, &quot;We&#x27;ll have to do it my way, I&#x27;m afraid.&quot; And I said, &quot;Why, Jodie?&quot; And she said, &#x27;Because I&#x27;m so intelligent. I&#x27;m such an intelligent person that there is no point in disagreeing with me because I&#x27;m always right.&quot; I thought she was joking, but she wasn&#x27;t! [laughs] She had this extraordinary opinion of her own IQ.

&quot;Double Jeopardy&quot; was filmed from Jul 15, 1998 to Oct 21, 1998.

== Reception ==
On Rotten Tomatoes the film holds an approval rating of 28% based on 87 reviews and an average rating of 4.5/10. The site&#x27;s critics consensus reads: &quot;A talented cast fails to save this unremarkable thriller.&quot; On Metacritic, it has a weighted average score of 40 out of 100 based on 30 critics, indicating &quot;mixed or average reviews&quot;. Audiences polled by CinemaScore gave the film an average grade of &quot;B+&quot; on an A+ to F scale.

Roger Ebert gave the film two and a half stars out of four, and said &quot;This movie was made primarily in the hopes that it would gross millions and millions of dollars, which probably explains most of the things that are wrong with it.&quot; Leonard Maltin gave the film 3 out of 4 stars, calling it &quot;slick entertainment&quot;. Mick LaSalle from the&quot; San Francisco Chronicle&quot; wrote that the film is a &quot;well-acted diversion, directed by Bruce Beresford (&quot;Driving Miss Daisy&quot;) with an intelligent grasp of the moment-to-moment emotion&quot;. For her performance in the film Ashley Judd won Favorite Actress at the 6th Blockbuster Entertainment Awards.

=== Accolades ===
=== Box office ===
The film spent three weeks as the No. 1 film. It grossed $116 million in the US and $61 million overseas.

==Misinterpretation of the concept of double jeopardy==
The film incorrectly implies that the Double Jeopardy Clause of the Fifth Amendment gives someone a free pass to commit a subsequent crime if they are wrongfully convicted. The newspaper column &quot;The Straight Dope&quot; observed, &quot;a crime, for double jeopardy purposes, consists of a specific set of facts. Change the facts and you&#x27;ve got a new crime ... no one would believe that a person convicted of beating Richard Roe to a pulp on December 8th could avoid another conviction for tracking down poor Rich in February and whaling on him again.&quot; Further, as murder is a state crime, and Washington and Louisiana are separate sovereigns, Libby&#x27;s prosecution for Nick&#x27;s murder in the latter state would in no sense be precluded given her previous conviction (although it would seem, naturally, to preempt a retrial for the murder committed in the former).

<text>The Oxford Group was a Christian organization founded by American Lutheran minister Frank Buchman in 1921, originally under the name First Century Christian Fellowship. Buchman believed that fear and selfishness were the root of all problems. He also believed that the solution to living without fear and selfishness was to &quot;surrender one&#x27;s life over to God&#x27;s plan&quot;. It featured surrender to Jesus Christ by sharing with others how lives had been changed in the pursuit of four moral absolutes: honesty, purity, unselfishness, and love.

Buchman said that he had a spiritual experience at a chapel in Keswick, England when he attended a decisive sermon by Jessie Penn-Lewis in the course of the 1908 Keswick Convention. He resigned a part-time post at Hartford Seminary in 1921 to found a movement called the &quot;Moral Re-Armament (MRA) movement&quot;. By 1928, the Fellowship had come to be known as &quot;The Oxford Group&quot; or &quot;Oxford Groups&quot;.

&quot;The Oxford Group&quot; enjoyed wide popularity and success in the 1930s. In 1932, Archbishop of Canterbury Cosmo Lang said, &quot;There is a gift here of which the church is manifestly in need.&quot; Buchman encouraged participants in his group to continue as members of their own churches. 

Two years later, Archbishop of York William Temple paid tribute to &quot;The Oxford Groups&quot; &quot;which are being used to demonstrate the power of God to change lives and give to personal witness its place in true discipleship&quot;. As a Protestant movement, it was criticized by some Roman Catholic authorities, yet praised by others.

The tenets and practices of an American &quot;Oxford Group&quot; greatly influenced the steps of Alcoholics Anonymous. Ebby Thacher’s sobriety led to Bill Wilson&#x27;s victory over alcoholism. Wilson&#x27;s efforts to carry the &quot;spiritual solution&quot; of the Group to suffering alcoholics led to Dr. Bob’s sobriety in 1935. Bill Wilson and Dr. Bob shortly after founded Alcoholics Anonymous (AA).

In 1938, Buchman proclaimed a need for &quot;moral re-armament&quot; and that expression became the &quot;Oxford Groups&quot; movement&#x27;s new name. Buchman headed the Moral Re-Armament for 23 years until his retirement in 1961. In 2001 the movement was renamed Initiatives of Change.

==Frank Buchman==

Frank Buchman, originally a Lutheran, was deeply influenced by the Higher Life movement whose strongest contribution to evangelism in Britain was the Keswick Convention.

Buchman had studied at Muhlenberg College in Allentown, Pennsylvania and at the Lutheran Theological Seminary at Philadelphia and was ordained a Lutheran minister in June 1902. Having hoped to be called to an important city church, he accepted a call to Overbrook, a growing Philadelphia suburb, which did not yet have a Lutheran church building. He arranged the rental of an old storefront for worship space, and lived upstairs.

After a visit to Europe, he decided to establish a hostel for mentally disabled in Overbrook, along the lines of Friedrich von Bodelschwingh’s colony for the mentally ill in Bielefeld, Germany, and inspired by Toynbee Hall charitable institution in East London.

Conflict developed with the hospice&#x27;s board. In Buchman&#x27;s recollection the dispute was due to the board&#x27;s &quot;unwillingness&quot; to fund the hospice adequately. However, the Finance Committee of the Lutheran church body of Pennsylvania, aka Pennsylvania Ministerium, which oversaw the budget, had no funds with which to make up an ongoing deficit and wanted the hospice to be self-supporting. Buchman resigned.

Exhausted and depressed, Buchman took his doctor&#x27;s advice of a long holiday abroad, and this is how, still in turmoil over his resignation, Buchman attended the &quot;Keswick Convention&quot; in 1908, hoping to meet pastor F. B. Meyer, one of the leading lights of the &quot;Keswick Convention&quot; and one of the main advocates of Quiet Time as a means to be &quot;inspired by God&quot;.

F.B. Meyer was not present, and Frank Buchman chose to attend the sermon by Jessie Penn-Lewis instead, which became &quot;a life-changing experience&quot; for him
&quot;I thought of those six men back in Philadelphia (the hospice&#x27;s board) who I felt had wronged me. They probably had, but I&#x27;d got so mixed up in the wrong that I was the seventh wrong man... I began to see myself as God saw me, which was a very different picture than the one I had of myself. I don&#x27;t know how to explain it, I can only tell you I sat there and realized how my sin, my pride, my selfishness and my ill-will had eclipsed me from God in Christ... I was the center of my own life. Not Him. That big &#x27;I&#x27; had to be crossed out. I saw my resentments against those men standing out like tombstones in my heart. I asked God to change me and He told me to put things right with them. It produced in me a vibrant feeling, as though a strong current of life had suddenly been poured into me and afterwards a dazed sense of a great spiritual shaking-up.&quot;
 Buchman wrote letters of apology to the six board members asking their forgiveness for harboring ill will. Buchman regarded this as a foundation experience and in later years frequently referred to it with his followers.

F. B. Meyer and the Keswick Convention&#x27;s influence on Buchman was a major one. Meyer had published &quot;The Secret of Guidance&quot; in 1896. One of his mottos was: &quot;Let no day pass without its season of silent waiting before God.&quot; Meyer personally coached Buchman into &quot;daily guidance&quot;.

The theology of the Keswick Convention at the time was that of the Holiness movement with its idea, originally derived from Methodism, of the second work of grace which would allow &quot;entire sanctification&quot;: Christians living &quot;in close union with Christ&quot; could remain &quot;free from sin&quot; through the Holy Spirit. That is where Buchman&#x27;s assertion (bizarre to many Lutheran or Reformed ears) that &quot;human nature can change&quot; originates. Another assertion was &quot;Absolute moral standards belong by Holiness&quot;, even though this formula used by Buchman had been formulated by the American Presbyterian missionary Robert Elliott Speer. 

From 1909 to 1915, Buchman was YMCA secretary at Pennsylvania State University. Despite quickly more than doubling the YMCA membership to 75% of the student body, he was dissatisfied, questioning how deep the changes went. Alcohol consumption in the college, for example, was unaffected. During this time he began the practice of a daily &quot;quiet time&quot;. 

Buchman finally got to meet Frederick Brotherton Meyer, who when visiting the college, asked Buchman, &quot;Do you let the Holy Spirit guide you in all you are doing?&quot; Buchman replied that he did indeed pray and read the Bible in the morning. &quot;But,&quot; persisted Meyer, &quot;do you give God enough uninterrupted time really to tell you what to do?&quot;

Another decisive influence appears to have been Yale University theology professor Henry Burt Wright (1877–1923) and his 1909 book &quot;The Will of God and a Man&#x27;s Lifework&quot;, which was itself influenced by Frederick Brotherton Meyer and Henry Drummond, among others.

Frank Buchman was also very influenced by Presbyterian Yale theology professor Henry Burt Wright (see &quot;The Four Absolutes&quot; infra).

Buchman&#x27;s devotion to &quot;personal evangelism&quot;, and his skill at re-framing the Christian message in contemporary terms, were admired by campus ministry leaders. Maxwell Chaplin, YMCA secretary at Princeton University, wrote, after attending one of the Buchman&#x27;s annual &quot;YMCA Week&quot; campaigns: &quot;In five years the permanent YMCA secretary at Penn State has entirely changed the tone of that one-time tough college.&quot; 

Lloyd Douglas, author of &quot;The Robe&quot; took part in the same campaign. &quot;It was,&quot; he wrote afterwards, &quot;the most remarkable event of its kind I ever witnessed... One after another, prominent fraternity men ... stood up before their fellows and confessed that they had been living poor, low-grade lives and from henceforth meant to be good.&quot;

In 1915, Buchman&#x27;s YMCA work took him to India with evangelist Sherwood Eddy. There he met, briefly, Mahatma Gandhi (the first of many meetings), and became friends with Rabindranath Tagore and Amy Carmichael, founder of the Dohnavur Fellowship. Despite speaking to audiences of up to 60,000, Buchman was critical of the large-scale approach, describing it as &quot;like hunting rabbits with a brass band&quot;.

From February to August 1916 Buchman worked with the YMCA mission in China and eventually returned to Pennsylvania due to the increasing illness of his father.

Buchman next took a part-time post at Hartford Theological Seminary as a personal evangelism lecturer. There he began to gather a group of men to assist in the conversion of China to Christianity. He was asked to lead missionary conferences at Guling and Beidaihe, which he saw as an opportunity to train native Chinese leaders at a time when many missionaries held attitudes of white superiority. Through his friendship with Xu Qian (Vice-Minister of Justice and later acting Prime Minister,) he got to know Sun Yat-sen. However, his criticism of other missionaries in China, with an implication that sin, including homosexuality, was keeping some of them from being effective, led to conflict. Bishop Logan Roots, deluged with complaints, asked Buchman to leave China in 1918.

While still based at Hartford, Buchman spent much of his time traveling and forming groups of Christian students at Princeton University and Yale University, as well as Oxford.

Sam Shoemaker, a Princeton graduate and one-time secretary of the Philadelphian Society, who had met Buchman in China, became one of his leading American disciples.

In 1922, after a prolonged spell with students in Cambridge, Buchman resigned his position at Hartford to &quot;live by faith&quot; and launch the &quot;First Century Christian Fellowship&quot;.

==First Century Christian Fellowship to Oxford Groups==
Following a dissent with Princeton University, Buchman found greater support in England where he designed a strategy of holding &quot;house parties&quot; at various locations, during which he hoped for Christian commitment to his &quot;First Century Christian Fellowship&quot; among those attending. In addition, men trained by Buchman began holding regular &quot;lunchtime meetings&quot; in the study of Julian Thornton-Duesbery, then Chaplain of Corpus Christi College, Oxford.

By 1928, numbers had grown so large that the &quot;meetings&quot; moved to the ballroom of the Oxford Randolph Hotel, before being invited to use the library of the Oxford University Church, St Mary&#x27;s.

In response to criticism by Tom Driberg in his first scoop in the &quot;Daily Express&quot; that this &quot;strange new sect&quot; involved members holding hands in a circle and publicly confessing their sins (a fabrication according to those who were there), the &quot;Daily Express&quot; printed a statement by Canon L.W. Grensted, Chaplain and Fellow of University College and a university lecturer in psychology bearing &quot;testimony not only to [their] general sanity and good health but also to [their] real effectiveness. Men student whom I have known have not only found a stronger faith and a new happiness, but have also made definite progress in the quality of their study, and in their athletics too.&quot;

The name &quot;Oxford Group&quot; appeared in South Africa in 1929, as a result of a railway porter writing the name on the windows of those compartments reserved by a traveling team of Frank Buchman&#x27;s &quot;First Century Christian Fellowship&quot; followers. They were from Oxford and in South Africa to promote the movement. The South African press picked up on the name and it stuck. It stuck because many of the campaigns of the &quot;Oxford Group&quot; were undergirded by Oxford University students and staff. And every year between 1930 and 1937 &quot;house-parties&quot; were held at the University.
In June 1939, the &quot;Oxford Group&quot; was legally incorporated.

==Spiritual life, not religion==
The &quot;Oxford group&quot; literature defines the group as &quot;not being a religion&quot;, for it had &quot;no hierarchy, no temples, no endowments, its workers no salaries, no plans but God&#x27;s plan&quot;. Their chief aim was &quot;A new world order for Christ, the King&quot;.

In fact one could not &quot;belong&quot; to the &quot;Oxford group&quot; for it had no membership list, badges, or definite location. It was simply &quot;a group of people from all walks of life who have surrendered their life to God&quot;. Their endeavour was to lead a &quot;spiritual life&quot; &quot;under God&#x27;s Guidance&quot; and their purpose was to carry their message so others could do the same.

The group was more like a spiritual revolution, unhampered by institutional ties; it combined social activities with religion, it had no organized board of officers. The group declared itself to be not an &quot;organization&quot; but an &quot;organism&quot;. Though Frank Buchman was the group&#x27;s founder and leader, group members believed their true leader to be the Holy Spirit and &quot;relied on God Control&quot;, meaning &quot;guidance received from God&quot; by those people who had &quot;fully surrendered to God&#x27;s will&quot;. By working with people from all the churches, regardless of denomination, they drew new members.
A newspaper account in 1933 described it as &quot;personal evangelism — one man or woman talking to another and discussing his or her problems was the order of the day&quot;. In 1936, &quot;Good Housekeeping&quot; magazine described the group as having neither membership, nor dues, nor paid leaders, nor new theological creed, nor regular meetings; it was simply a fellowship of people who desire to follow a way of life, a determination, and not a denomination.

=== Primary purpose ===
Frank Buchman&#x27;s speeches include references to &quot;The Oxford Group&#x27;s primary purpose&quot;.

* The &quot;Oxford Group&quot; seeks to be &quot;living Christianity&quot;. It builds on the &quot;accomplished work of Jesus Christ&quot; as set forth in the New Testament. Its aim is to bring to life and make real for each person the articles of faith with which their own Church provides them.

* The international problems and wars are said by the group to be personal problems at bottom, of selfishness and fear. Ways of life must therefore be changed if problems are to be solved. According to the group, peace in the world could only spring from peace in the hearts of men. A dynamic experience of God&#x27;s free spirit is said to be the answer to international, national and regional antagonism, economic depression, racial conflict and international strife.

* The secret is said to be &quot;God Control&quot;, the only sane people in an insane world being those controlled by God. God-controlled personalities would make God-controlled nationalities. This is the aim of the &quot;Oxford Group&quot;. The true patriot should surrender his life to God to bring his nation &quot;under God&#x27;s control&quot;. World peace could only come through nations which have achieved &quot;God-control&quot;. And &quot;everybody can listen to God. You can. I can. Everybody can have a part.&quot;

* &quot;There are those who feel that internationalism is not enough. Nationalism can unite a nation. Supernationalism can unite a world. &quot;God-controlled&quot; supernationalism seems to them to be the only sure foundation for world peace!&quot;

* This is all in this declaration by Buchman: &quot;I challenge Denmark to be a miracle among the nations, her national policy dictated by God, her national defense the respect and gratitude of her neighbors, her national armament an army of life-changers. Denmark can demonstrate to the nations that spiritual power is the first force in the world. The true patriot gives his life to bring about his country&#x27;s resurrection.&quot;

===The Four Absolutes===
Moral standards of
* &quot;Absolute honesty&quot;,
* &quot;Absolute &quot;,
* &quot;Absolute unselfishness&quot;, and
* &quot;Absolute love&quot;,
though recognized as impossible to attain, were guidelines to help determine whether a course of action was &quot;directed by God&quot;. 

The &quot;Four Absolutes&quot; seem to have first appeared in a book by Robert E. Speer, titled &quot;The Principles of Jesus&quot;. In the Chapter, &quot;Jesus and Standards&quot;, Speer laid down &quot;Four Principles&quot; (honesty, purity, unselfishness, love) that he believed represented the distilled, uncompromising, moral principles taught by Jesus. Speer quoted Bible verses for each &quot;Principle&quot;. 

In 1909, Professor Henry Burt Wright of Yale, citing Speer&#x27;s work, dug up many more Bible verses that set forth these same Principles in the YMCA book: &quot;The Will of God and a Man&#x27;s Lifework&quot;. Wright dubbed them &quot;Absolute&quot; rather than &quot;Principles&quot;. Next, Frank Buchman and the &quot;Oxford Group&quot; adopted and popularized the phrase &quot;The Four Absolutes&quot;.

In &quot;Oxford Group&quot; terms, sin was &quot;anything that kept one from God or one another&quot; and is &quot;as contagious as any bodily disease&quot;. The soul needs cleansing: &quot;We all know &#x27;nice&#x27; sinless sinners who need that surgical spiritual operation as keenly as the most miserable sinner of us all.&quot;

=== Spiritual practices ===
To be &quot;spiritually reborn&quot;, the &quot;Oxford Group&quot; advocated four practices set out below:
* &quot;&quot;Sharing&quot; our sins and temptations with another Christian&quot;.
* &quot;&quot;Restitution&quot; to all whom we have wronged, directly or indirectly&quot;.
* &quot;&quot;Surrender&quot; our life past, present and future, to God&#x27;s keeping and direction&quot;.
* &quot;Listening for &quot;God&#x27;s guidance&quot;, and carrying it out&quot;.

====Sharing====
In the &quot;Oxford Group&quot;, &quot;sharing&quot; was considered a necessity. &quot;Sharing&quot; referred to telling others, in small or big groups, about personal life details of sins, steps to change behaviours and their results, as well as telling others what &quot;guidance&quot; was received during a &quot;quiet time&quot;. It allowed one to be healed, therefore it was also a blessing to share. &quot;Sharing&quot; was considered to not only bring relief, but &quot;honest sharing&quot; of sin, and of &quot;victory over sin&quot;, was considered a way to help others to open about themselves. &quot;Sharing&quot; built trust. The message one brings to others by speaking of one&#x27;s own sins, one&#x27;s own experiences, the power of God in guiding one&#x27;s life would bring hope to others that a spiritually changed life gives strength to overcome life&#x27;s difficulties. It must be done with total conviction for &quot;Half measures will be as fruitless as no measures.&quot;

Some found public confession disturbing. Beverley Nichols stated &quot;And all that business about telling one&#x27;s sins in public... It is spiritual nudism!&quot;

However Cuthbert Bardsley, who worked with Buchman for some years and later became Bishop of Coventry, said, &quot;I never came across public confession in &quot;house parties&quot; — or very, very rarely. Frank [Buchman] tried to prevent it, and was very annoyed if people ever trespassed beyond the bounds of decency.&quot; Buchman&#x27;s biographer, Garth Lean, wrote that he attended meetings from 1932 on &quot;and cannot recall hearing any unwise public confessions&quot;.

====Guidance====
The central practice to the &quot;Oxford Group&quot; members was &quot;guidance&quot;, which was usually sought in a &quot;quiet time&quot; early morning, using pen and paper. The grouper would normally read the Bible or other spiritual literature, then take time in quiet with pen and paper, seeking &quot;God&#x27;s directions&quot; for the day ahead, trying to find &quot;God&#x27;s perspective&quot; on whatever issues were on the listener&#x27;s mind. He or she would test their thoughts against the standards of &quot;absolute honesty, purity, unselfishness and love&quot;, and normally check with a colleague.

&quot;Guidance&quot; was also sought collectively from groupers when they formed teams. They would take a &quot;quiet time&quot;, each individual writing his or her sense of &quot;God&#x27;s direction&quot; on the matter in question. They would then check with each other, seeking consensus on the action to take.

Some church leaders criticized this practice. Others supported it. The Oxford theologian, B.H. Streeter, Provost of Queen&#x27;s College, made it the subject of the Warburton Lectures, given at Oxford University in 1933-1935. These lectures were published under the title &quot;The God Who Speaks&quot;. Throughout the ages, he wrote, men and women have sought God&#x27;s will in quiet and listening. The Oxford Group was following a long tradition.

Sometimes groupers were banal in their descriptions of &quot;guidance&quot;. However, innumerable examples were given by them of groupers discovering creative initiatives through times of &quot;quiet time seeking God&#x27;s direction&quot;, as can be seen in books about the &quot;Oxford Group&quot; such as &quot;For Sinners Only&quot; by A. J. Russell (1885-1953), which went through 17 editions in two years, or &quot;Frank Buchman - a life&quot; by Garth Lean (1912-1993).

Buchman would share the thoughts which he felt were guided by God, but whether others pursued those thoughts was up to them.

===The Five Cs===
The &quot;Five Cs&quot;:
* &quot;Confidence&quot;,
* &quot;Confession&quot;,
* &quot;Conviction&quot;,
* &quot;Conversion&quot;, and
* &quot;Continuance&quot;
was the process of life changing undertaken by the &quot;life changer&quot;:

* &quot;Confidence&quot;: the grouper had to have confidence and know his secrets would be kept .

* &quot;Confession&quot;: the grouper had to be honest about the real state of their life.

* &quot;Conviction&quot;: the acknowledgement of the seriousness of their sins by the grouper and the need to be freed of them.

* &quot;Conversion&quot;: the process of the grouper&#x27;s decision to &quot;surrender to God&quot; had to be the grouper&#x27;s own free will.

* &quot;Continuance&quot;: the grouper was responsible as a &quot;life changer&quot; to help new groupers become all that God wanted them to be.

Only God could change a person, and the work of the &quot;life changer&quot; had to be done under God&#x27;s direction.

==Methods==

===&quot;House Parties&quot;===
The first &quot;First Century Christian Fellowship&quot; &quot;House Party&quot; was held in China in 1918. 

In the summer of 1930 the first &quot;International House Party&quot; was held at Oxford, followed by another the next year attended by 700 people. In the summer of 1933, 5,000 guests turned up for some part of an event which filled six colleges and lasted seventeen days. Almost 1,000 were clergy, including twelve bishops.By 1934 the &quot;International House Party&quot; had grown and was attended by representatives from 40 nations, and by 1935 it had grown further more, and was attended by 50 nations, to the total of 10,000 representatives. The 1936 &quot;International House Party&quot; at Birmingham drew 15,000 people, and The &quot;First National Assembly&quot; held in Massachusetts drew almost 10,000 people.

* There were also &quot;travelling teams&quot; organized &quot;house parties&quot; : featured out-of-town people came to the &quot;party&quot; to relate their experiences in the &quot;Group Way of Life&quot;. Attendance was by printed invitation. Invitations were also sent to &quot;key people&quot; in the community.

* &quot;House parties&quot; were held in a variety of locations: wealthy homes, fashionable hotels, inns, or summer resorts, as well as outdoor camps, and, at times, less fashionable locations such as college dorms. &quot;House parties&quot; were held from a weekend up to two weeks. A &quot;house party team&quot; would meet in advance for training and preparation. The team would remain throughout the meetings and handle a number of details. &quot;Oxford Group&quot; literature was on display.

* Meetings followed no formal agenda and were not like church meetings, as singing and public prayer were absent. Time was devoted to talks by the team members on subjects such as sin, &quot;surrender&quot;, &quot;quiet time&quot;, the &quot;four absolutes&quot;, &quot;guidance&quot;, and &quot;intelligent witness&quot;.
However, the &quot;Oxford Group&quot; had its own song: 

&quot;On sure foundation 
Build we God&#x27;s new nation, 
strong and clear each year
On God&#x27;s word
Shall we stand
and build together 
what none can ever, 
bridges from man to man, 
the whole wide earth to span.&quot;

===Slogans===
Most were coined through Buchman&#x27;s &quot;quiet time&quot;; he knew slogans would catch attention, be more easily remembered and more readily repeated. They provided simple answers to problems people face in themselves and others. A few are listed below

* &quot;Pray: stands for Powerful Radiograms Always Yours&quot;,
* &quot;Constipated Christians come clean&quot;,
* &quot;Every man is a force, not a field&quot;,
* &quot;Interesting sinners make compelling saints&quot;,
* &quot;When a man listens, God speaks&quot;
* &quot;A spiritual radiophone in every home&quot;,
* &quot;Sin blinds, sin binds&quot;,
* &quot;World changing through life-changing&quot;

===Literature===
Some of the Oxford Group literature is available online. See references. 
* &quot;For Sinners Only&quot; by Arthur James Russell (1932) was characterized as the Oxford Group &quot;bible&quot; 
* &quot;Soul Surgery&quot; by H. A. Walter (1919) 
* &quot;What Is the Oxford Group?&quot; by The Layman with a Notebook (1933) and 
* &quot;The Eight Points of the Oxford Group&quot; by C. Irving Benson (1938)

About alcoholics who found sobriety in the Oxford Group, there were three autobiographies by Oxford Group members who were active alcoholics which were published in the 1930s. These books provided accounts of the alcoholics&#x27; failed attempts to make their lives meaningful until, as a result of their Oxford Group membership, they found a transformation in their lives and sobriety through surrendering to God. The books were;
* &quot;I Was a Pagan&quot; by V. C. Kitchen (1934)
* &quot;Life Began Yesterday&quot; by Stephen Foot (1935)
* &quot;The Big Bender&quot; by Charles Clapp (1938).
* The stories contained in Alcoholics Anonymous &quot;Big Book&quot;, are very similar in style to these much earlier works.

==History==

===Campaigns through Europe===
The &quot;Oxford Group&quot; conducted campaigns in many European countries. In 1934 a team of 30 visited Norway at the invitation of Carl J. Hambro, President of the Norwegian Parliament. 14,000 people crammed into three meetings in one of Oslo&#x27;s largest halls, and there were countless other meetings across the country. At the end of that year the Oslo daily &quot;Tidens Tegn&quot; commented in its Christmas number, &quot;A handful of foreigners who neither knew our language, nor understood our ways and customs, came to the country. A few days later the whole country was talking about God, and two months after the thirty foreigners arrived, the mental outlook of the whole country has definitely changed.&quot; On April 22, 1945 Bishop Fjellbu, Bishop of Trondheim, preached in the church of St Martin-in-the-Fields, London. &quot;I wish to state publicly,&quot; he said, &quot;that the foundations of the united resistance of Norwegian Churchmen to Nazism were laid by the Oxford Group&#x27;s work&quot;.

Similar stories can be told of campaigns in Denmark, where the Primate of Denmark, Bishop Fuglsang-Damgaard said that the Oxford Group &quot;has opened my eyes to that gift of God which is called Christian fellowship, and which I have experienced in this Group to which I now belong&quot;. When the Nazis invaded Denmark, Bishop Fuglsang-Damgaard, Bishop of Copenhagen, was sent to a concentration camp. Before imprisonment he smuggled a message to Buchman saying that through the Oxford Group he had found a spirit which the Nazis could not break and that he went without fear.

===Attempt to reach Nazi leaders in Germany===
In the 1930s, the &quot;Oxford Group&quot; had a substantial following in Germany. They watched the rise of the Nazi Party with alarm, as did those elsewhere in Europe and America. Buchman kept in close touch with his German colleagues, and felt compelled to attempt to reach the Nazi leaders in Germany, and win them to a new approach.

Buchman was convinced that without a change in the heart of the National Socialist regime, a world war would become inevitable. He also believed that any person, including the German leaders, could find a living Christian faith with a commitment to Christ&#x27;s moral values.

He tried to meet Hitler, but was unsuccessful. He met with Himmler three times at the request of Moni von Crammon, an &quot;Oxford Group&quot; adherent, the last time in 1936. To a Danish journalist and friend he said a few hours after the final interview that the doors were now closed. &quot;Germany has come under the domination of a terrible demonic power. A counter-action is absolutely necessary.&quot;

As study of Gestapo documents has revealed, the Nazis watched the &quot;Oxford Group&quot; with suspicion from 1934 on. A first detailed secret Gestapo report about &quot;The Oxford Group or Movement&quot; was published in November 1936 warning that &#x27;it had turned into a dangerous opponent of National Socialism&#x27;. The Nazis also classified the Stalinist version of Bolshevism and non-Nazi, right-wing groups such as Catholic Action as dangerous to Nazism.

Upon his return to New York from Berlin, Buchman gave a number of interviews. He was quoted as reportedly saying, &quot;I thank heaven for a man like Adolf Hitler, who built a front line of defence against the anti-Christ of Communism.&quot; The Rev. Garrett Stearly, one of Buchman&#x27;s colleagues from Princeton University who was present at the interview, wrote, &quot;I was amazed when the story came out. It was so out of key with the interview.&quot; Buchman chose not to respond to the article, feeling that to do so would endanger his friends among the opposition in Germany.

During the war, the &quot;Oxford Group&quot; in Germany divided into three parts. Some submitted to Himmler&#x27;s demand that they cut all links with Buchman and the Oxford Group abroad. The largest group continued the work of bringing Christian change to people under a different name, &quot;Arbeitsgemeinschaft für Seelsorge&quot; (&quot;Working team for the Care of Souls&quot;), without being involved in politics and always subject to surveillance. A third group joined the active opposition. Moni Von Crammon&#x27;s son-in-law was one of those executed along with Adam von Trott zu Solz. They were executed under Hitler&#x27;s orders after the July 20 plot.

After World War II, further Gestapo documents came to light; one from 1939 states: &quot;The Group preaches revolution against the national state and has quite evidently become its Christian opponent.&quot; Another, from 1942, states: &quot;No other Christian movement has underlined so strongly the character of Christianity as being supernational and independent of all racial barriers.&quot;

Some from the &quot;Oxford Group&quot; in Germany continued to oppose the Nazi regime during the war. In Norway, Bishop Arne Fjellbu of Trondheim said in 1945: &quot;I wish to state publicly that the foundations of the united resistance of Norwegian Churchmen to Nazism were laid by the &quot;Oxford Group&quot; work.&quot;

===Presence in the United States===
In 1927, after his two years trial as a rector to Calvary Church in Manhattan, Sam Shoemaker gradually set the U.S.s headquarters of Frank Buchman&#x27;s &quot;First Century Christian Fellowship&quot; soon to be named &quot;Oxford Group&quot; at Calvary House adjacent to the church.

By 1936, the organization had already come to national attention from the media and Hollywood.

===Transformation into &quot;Moral Re-Armament&quot;===

In 1938, Buchman made a speech in East Ham Town Hall, London, in which he stated: &quot;The crisis is fundamentally a moral one. The nations must re-arm morally. Moral recovery is essentially the forerunner of economic recovery.&quot; The same year the British tennis star H. W. Austin edited the book &quot;Moral Rearmament (The Battle for Peace)&quot;, which sold half a million copies. Gradually the former &quot;Oxford Group&quot; developed into &quot;Moral Re-Armament&quot;.

A number of &quot;Oxford Groups&quot; as well as individuals dissociated themselves from Buchman as a result of his launching of &quot;Moral Re-Armament&quot;. Some &quot;Oxford Group&quot; members disapproved Buchman&#x27;s attention to matters not purely personal, or his &#x27;going into politics.&#x27; Buchman&#x27;s view was that if &quot;Moral Re-Armament&quot; was the car, the &quot;Oxford Group&quot; was the engine, and that individual change was the basis of both. He had said to his students of Penn State and Hartford as early as 1921 that the &quot;First Century Christian Fellowship&quot; was &quot;a program of life issuing in personal, social, racial, national and supernational change&quot; or that it had &quot;nothing to do with politics, yet everything to do with politics, because it leads to change in politicians&quot;. Nonetheless, while maintaining a lot of Christian language, &quot;Moral Re-Armament&quot; became inclusive of all shades of religious and philosophical convictions, Buchman comparing in a speech &quot;Moral Re-Armament&quot; to &quot;the good road of an ideology inspired by God upon which all can unite. Catholic, Jew and Protestant, Hindu, Muslim, Buddhist and Confucianist - all find they can change, where needed and travel along this good road together&quot;.

In Britain, the &quot;Oxford Group/Moral Re-Armament&quot; was very active. The novelist Daphne du Maurier published &quot;Come Wind, Come Weather&quot;, stories of ordinary Britons who had found hope and new life through the group. She dedicated it to &quot;Frank Buchman, whose initial vision made possible the world of the living characters in these stories&quot;, and added, &quot;What they are doing up and down the country in helping men and women solve their problems, and prepare them for whatever lies ahead, will prove to be of national importance in the days to come.&quot; The book sold 650,000 copies in Britain alone.

When war broke out, &quot;Moral Re-Armament&quot; workers joined the Allied Forces in large numbers, and were decorated for valour in many theatres of war. Others worked to heighten morale and overcome bottlenecks, particularly in war-related industries. About 30 &quot;Oxford Group&quot; workers were exempted from military service to continue this work. However, when Ernest Bevin became Minister of Labour in 1940, he decided to conscript them. Over 2,500 clergy and ministers signed a petition opposing this, and 174 Members of Parliament put down a motion stating the same. Bevin made it clear that he would resign from the Government if he was defeated, and the Government put a three-line whip upon its supporters. As a result, the &quot;Oxford Group&quot; workers were excluded from the Exemption from Military Service bill.

In the United States, where &quot;Moral Re-Armament&quot; was doing similar work, Senator (later President) Harry Truman, Chair of the Senate Committee investigating war contracts, told a Washington press conference in 1943: &quot;Suspicions, rivalries, apathy, greed lie behind most of the bottlenecks. This is where the &quot;Moral Re-Armament&quot; group comes in. Where others have stood back and criticized, they have rolled up their sleeves and gone to work. They have already achieved remarkable results in bringing teamwork into industry, on the principles not of &#x27;who&#x27;s right&#x27;, but of &#x27;what&#x27;s right&#x27;.&quot;

At the end of the war, the &quot;Moral Re-Armament&quot; workers returned to the task of establishing a lasting peace. In 1946, &quot;Moral Re-Armament&quot; bought and restored a large, derelict hotel at Caux, Switzerland, and this became a centre for reconciliation across Europe, bringing together thousands, including German Chancellor Konrad Adenauer and French Foreign Minister Robert Schuman. Its work was described by the historians Douglas Johnston and Cynthia Sampson as an &quot;important contribution to one of the greatest achievements in the entire record of modern statecraft: the astonishingly rapid Franco-German reconciliation after 1945&quot;.

In the following decades, &quot;Moral Re-Armament&quot; work expanded across the globe, particularly into the African and Asian countries moving towards independence from colonial rule. Many leaders of these independence struggles have paid tribute to &quot;Moral Re-Armament&quot; contribution towards bringing unity between groups in conflict, and helping ease the transition into independence. In 1956 King Mohammed V of Morocco sent a message to Buchman: &quot;I thank you for all you have done for Morocco in the course of these last testing years. &quot;Moral Re-Armament&quot; must become for us Muslims as much an incentive as it is for you Christians and for all nations.&quot; In 1960 Archbishop Makarios and Dr Kucuk, President and Vice-President of Cyprus, jointly sent the first flag of independent Cyprus to Frank Buchman at Caux in recognition of &quot;Moral Re-Armament&quot; help.

In 2001 &quot;Moral Re-Armament&quot; became &quot;Initiatives of Change&quot;, a name expressing the emphasis of the organization in effecting social change beginning with personal change. &quot;Initiatives of Change&quot; claims spiritual roots but no religious affiliation, and invites &quot;those with a faith...both to explore the roots of their own tradition, and to discover and respect the beliefs of others&quot;.

==Impact and legacy==

===Impact on industry===
In Buchman&#x27;s view, management and labour could &quot;work together like the fingers on the hand&quot;, and in order to make that possible he aimed to answer &quot;the self-will in management and labour who are both so right, and so wrong&quot;. MRA&#x27;s role was to offer the experience which would free those people&#x27;s hearts and minds from the motivations or prejudices which prevent just solutions.

William Grogan, an International Vice-President of the American Transport Workers&#x27; Union, said that &quot;between 1946 and 1953 national union leaders, local union officials, shop stewards and rank and file union members from 75 countries had received training&quot; in MRA principles. Evert Kupers, for 20 years President of the Dutch Confederation of Trades Unions, stated that &quot;the thousands who have visited Caux have been deeply impressed by its message for our age and by the real comradeship they found there.&quot; In France Maurice Mercier, Secretary-General of the textile workers within the Force Ouvriere, said: &quot;Class war today means one half of humanity against the other half, each possessing a powerful arsenal of destruction... Not one cry of hatred, not one hour of work lost, not one drop of blood shed - that is the revolution to which Moral Re Armement calls bosses and workers.&quot;

===Alcoholics Anonymous===

In Akron, Ohio, Jim Newton, an Oxford Group member, knew that one of Harvey S. Firestone&#x27;s sons, Russell, was a serious alcoholic. He took him first to a drying-out clinic and then on to an Oxford Group conference in Denver. The young man &quot;gave his life to God&quot;, and thereafter enjoyed extended periods of sobriety. The family doctor called it a &quot;medical miracle&quot;. Harvey Firestone Senior was so grateful that, in January 1933, he invited Buchman and a team of sixty to conduct a ten-day campaign in Akron. They left behind them a strong functioning group which met each week in the house of T. Henry Williams, amongst whom were an Akron surgeon, Bob Smith, and his wife Anne. Bob was a secret drinker.

Rowland Hazard, claimed that it was Carl Jung who caused him to seek a &quot;spiritual solution&quot; to his alcoholism, which led to Rowland joining the Oxford Group. He was introduced by Shep Cornell to Cornell&#x27;s friend Ebby Thacher. Ebby had a serious drinking problem. Hazard introduced Ebby to Jung&#x27;s theory and then to the Oxford Group. For a time Ebby took up residence at Sam Shoemaker&#x27;s Calvary Rescue Mission that catered mainly to saving down-and-outs and drunks. Shoemaker taught inductees the concept of God being that of one&#x27;s understanding.

Ebby Thacher, in keeping with the Oxford Teachings, needed to keep his own conversion experience real by carrying the Oxford message of salvation to others. Ebby had heard that his old drinking buddy Bill Wilson was again drinking heavily. Thacher and Cornell visited Wilson at his home and introduced him to the Oxford Group&#x27;s religious conversion cure. Wilson, who was then an agnostic, was &quot;aghast&quot; when Thacher told him he had &quot;got religion&quot;.

A few days later, in a drunken state, Wilson went to the Calvary Rescue Mission in search of Ebby Thacher. It was there that he attended his first Oxford Group meeting and would later describe the experience: &quot;Penitents started marching forward to the rail. Unaccountably impelled, I started too... Soon, I knelt among the sweating, stinking penitents ... Afterward, Ebby ... told me with relief that I had done all right and had given my life to God.&quot; The Call to the Altar did little to curb Wilson&#x27;s drinking. A couple of days later, he re-admitted himself to Charles B. Towns Hospital. Wilson had been admitted to Towns hospital three times earlier between 1933 and 1934. This would be his fourth and last stay.

Bill Wilson obtained his &quot;spiritual awakening&quot; going through the steps with Ebby in Towns Hospital where he had his conversion. Wilson claimed to have seen a &quot;white light&quot;, and when he told his attending physician, William Silkworth about his experience, he was advised not to discount it. After Wilson left the hospital, he never drank again.

After his release from the hospital, Wilson attended Oxford Group meetings and went on a mission to save other alcoholics. His prospects came through Towns Hospital and the Calvary Mission. Though he was not able to keep one alcoholic sober, he found that by engaging in the activity of trying to convert others he was able to keep himself sober. It was this realization, that he needed another alcoholic to work with, that brought him into contact with Bob Smith while on a business trip in Akron, Ohio. 

Earlier Bill Wilson had been advised by Dr Silkworth to change his approach and tell the alcoholics they suffered from an illness, one that could kill them, and afterward apply the Oxford Practices. The idea that alcoholism was an illness, not a moral failing, was different from the Oxford concept that drinking was a sin. This is what he brought to Bob Smith on their first meeting. Smith was the first alcoholic Wilson helped to sobriety. Dr. Bob and Bill W., as they were later called, went on to found Alcoholics Anonymous.

Wilson later acknowledged in &quot;Alcoholics Anonymous Comes of Age&quot;: &quot;The early AA got its ideas of self-examination, acknowledgement of character defects, restitution for harm done, and working with others straight from the Oxford Group and directly from Sam Shoemaker, their former leader in America, and from nowhere else.&quot;

In 1934, James Houck joined the Oxford Group and became sober on December 12, one day after Wilson did. AA was founded on June 10, 1935. In September 2004, Houck was the last surviving person to have attended Oxford Group meetings with Wilson, who died in 1971. At the age of 98, Houck was still active in the group, now renamed Moral Re-armament, and it was his mission to restore the Oxford Group&#x27;s spiritual methods through the &quot;Back to Basics program&quot;, a twelve step program similar to AA. Houck believed the old Oxford Group spiritual methods were stronger and more effective than the ones currently practiced in A.A. Houck was trying to introduce the program into the prison systems.

Houck&#x27;s assessment of Wilson&#x27;s time in the Oxford Group: &quot;He was never interested in the things we were interested in; he only wanted to talk about alcoholism; he was not interested in giving up smoking; he was a ladies man and would brag of his sexual exploits with other members&quot;, and in Houck&#x27;s opinion he remained an agnostic.

==Influences==
Because of its influence on the lives of several highly prominent individuals, the group attracted highly visible members of society, including members of the British Parliament and other European leaders and such prominent Americans as the Firestone family, founders of the Firestone Tire and Rubber Company of Ohio. Though sometimes controversial (the group attracted opposition from the Roman Catholic Church), the group grew into a well-known, informal and international network of people by the 1930s. The London newspaper editor Arthur J. Russell joined the group after attending a meeting in 1931. He wrote &quot;For Sinners Only&quot; in 1932, which inspired the writers of &quot;God Calling&quot;.

Among those influenced by the Oxford Group and Frank Buchman, one also finds:
*Paul Tournier, the Swiss physician and author whose &quot;Medicine of the Person&quot; became a worldwide success
*Emil Brunner, the Swiss Protestant (Reformed) theologian
*Theophil Spoerri, a Swiss writer and academic who was instrumental in setting up the Gotthardbund, a civil society organisation which fought against Nazi propaganda in Switzerland from 1940 to 1945.
*Gabriel Marcel, French philosopher, playwright and leading Christian existentialist

==Evaluation and critics==

===Carl Jung on the Oxford Group===
Carl Jung on the matter of an individual and his involvement in the Oxford Group:
===Published literature critical of the Oxford Group===
In 1934 Marjorie Harrison, an Episcopal Church member, published a book, &quot;Saints Run Mad&quot;, that challenged the group, its leader and their practices.

The theologian Reinhold Niebuhr criticized Buchman&#x27;s philosophy and pursuit of the wealthy and powerful. &quot;The idea is that if the man of power can be converted, God will be able to control a larger area of human life through his power than if a little man were converted. This is the logic which has filled the Buchmanites with touching solicitude for the souls of such men as Henry Ford or Harvey Firestone&quot;. He called its moral principles &quot;a religious expression of a decadent individualism... bourgeois optimism, individualism and moralism expressing itself in the guise of religion&quot;, and added, &quot;no wonder the rather jittery plutocrats of our day open their spacious summer homes to its message!&quot;

==Confusion with Oxford Movement==
The Oxford Group is occasionally confused with the Oxford Movement, an effort that began in the 19th-century Anglican Communion to encourage high-church practice and demonstrate the church&#x27;s apostolic heritage. Though both had an association with members and students of the University of Oxford at different times, the Oxford Group and the Oxford Movement are unrelated.

<doc id="818016" wikidata="Q1440316" url="?curid=818016" title="Fra Mauro (crater)">
<text>Fra Mauro is the worn remnant of a walled lunar plain. It is part of the surrounding Fra Mauro formation, being located to the northeast of Mare Cognitum and southeast of Mare Insularum. Attached to the southern rim are the co-joined craters Bonpland and Parry, which intrude into the formation forming inward-bulging walls. The crater is named after Italian geographer Fra Mauro.

==Description==

The surviving rim of Fra Mauro is heavily worn, with incisions from past impacts and openings in the north and east walls. The rim is the most prominent in the southeast, where it shares a wall with Parry. The remainder consists of little more than low, irregular ridges. The maximum elevation of the outer rim is 0.7 km.

The floor of this formation has been covered by basaltic lava. This surface is almost divided by clefts running from the north and south rims. There is no central peak, although the tiny crater Fra Mauro E lies at almost the midpoint of the formation.

==Apollo missions==

The area north of Fra Mauro crater was the intended landing site of the ill-fated Apollo 13 mission, which was aborted after an oxygen tank aboard the spacecraft exploded. The crew later returned safely to Earth. The next mission, Apollo 14, landed at Fra Mauro. The Apollo 14 crew (Alan Shepard and Edgar Mitchell) sampled breccia that had been deposited here by the Imbrium basin-forming impact, and which partly covers Fra Mauro. This rough debris blanket of ejecta is referred to as the &quot;Fra Mauro Formation&quot;.

==Satellite craters==
By convention these features are identified on lunar maps by placing the letter on the side of the crater midpoint that is closest to Fra Mauro.

<doc id="818025" wikidata="Q8031054" url="?curid=818025" title="Women's Royal Army Corps">
<text>The Women&#x27;s Royal Army Corps (WRAC; sometimes pronounced acronymically as , a term unpopular with its members) was the corps to which all women in the British Army belonged from 1949 to 1992 except medical, dental and veterinary officers and chaplains, who belonged to the same corps as the men; the Ulster Defence Regiment, which recruited women from 1973, and nurses, who belonged to Queen Alexandra&#x27;s Royal Army Nursing Corps.

==History==
The WRAC was formed on 1 February 1949, by Army Order 6, as the successor to the Auxiliary Territorial Service (ATS) that had been founded in 1938. For much of its existence, its members performed administrative and other support tasks. In March 1952 the ranks of the WRAC, which had previously been Subaltern, Junior Commander, Senior Commander and Controller were harmonised with the rest of the British Army.

In 1974, two soldiers of the corps were killed by the Provisional IRA in the Guildford pub bombings.

In October 1990 WRAC officers employed with other corps were transferred to those corps and in April 1992 the WRAC was disbanded and its remaining members transferred to the Corps they served with. Those who served with the Royal Army Pay Corps, the Corps of Royal Military Police, the Military Provost Staff Corps, the Royal Army Educational Corps, the Army Legal Corps and the Staff Clerks from the Royal Army Ordnance Corps were transferred to the newly formed Adjutant General&#x27;s Corps. The post of Director WRAC, which carried the rank of Brigadier, was also abolished and it was seven years before a woman, Brigadier Patricia Purves, again reached that rank.

==Senior posts==
The highest rank available to a serving officer was brigadier, held by the Director WRAC, although the Controller-Commandant, a member of the Royal Family, held a higher honorary rank. Princess Mary held the post from 1949 to her death in 1965 (beginning as a major general and being promoted general on 23 November 1956) and the Duchess of Kent held it from 1967 to 1992 (with the rank of Major-General).

==List of directors WRAC==
Directors of the WRAC were:
*Brigadier Dame Mary Tyrwhitt, 1949–1950
*Brigadier Dame Mary Coulshed, 1950–1954
*Brigadier Dame Mary Railton, 1954–1957
*Brigadier Dame Mary Colvin, 1957–1961
*Brigadier Dame Jean Rivett-Drake, 1961–1964
*Brigadier Dame Joan Henderson, 1964– 25 August 1967
*Brigadier Dame Mary Anderson, 1967–1970
*Brigadier Sheila Heaney, 1970–1973
*Brigadier Eileen Nolan, 1973–1977
*Brigadier Anne Field, 1977–1982
*Brigadier Helen Meechie, 1982–1986
*Brigadier Shirley Nield, 1986–1989
*Brigadier Gael Ramsey, 1989–1992
*Brigadier Joan Roulstone, 1992–1994 (as Director Women (Army) during transitional period)

==The Staff Band of the WRAC==
The Staff Band of the Women&#x27;s Royal Army Corps was an all female military band. It was formed in 1949, and was the only all-female band in the British Armed Forces by the time it was disestablished. The Central Band of the Women&#x27;s Royal Air Force, which was one of only two all-female bands to exist, transferred some of its musicians to the Band of the AGC after it was disbanded in 1972. Since the mid-1990s, women have served in all British Army bands. The instruments, assets and personnel of the former WRAC Band became the new Band of the Adjutant General&#x27;s Corps.

==Reunion meetings==
The WRAC organizes Reunion Meetings to promote solidarity among its former members.

Although the Emmy-nominated actor may be best known for his work on the series &quot;Ally McBeal&quot;, &quot;VR.5,&quot; &quot;Total Recall 2070, One Life to Live and General Hospital,&quot; he is also the author of several critically-acclaimed novels, including the trilogy &quot;Soul Stealer,&quot; and is an accomplished director whose films have earned multiple independent film awards.

==Acting career==
Born in Inglewood, California, Easton was raised and educated in the US and Ireland. He attended high school and then UCLA when he returned to the United States, and graduated with a double major in English and History.

His first major series role was a two-year stint on NBC&#x27;s &quot;Days of Our Lives&quot;, playing Tanner Scofield when he was just 25. While on the show, he was featured in People Magazine’s “50 Most Beautiful Issue” in 1992, and left the role when his mother was diagnosed with ovarian cancer in 1993. Easton returned to Los Angeles to care for her until her death in 1994.

Easton returned to acting in 1995 with Fox&#x27;s &quot;VR.5&quot; as Duncan, co-starring with &quot;Fame&quot; alumna Lori Singer and &quot;Buffy the Vampire Slayer&quot;’s Anthony Head. This was followed up with a turn as the lead in showrunner Stephen J. Cannell&#x27;s &quot;Two&quot;. He played the dual roles of a Seattle professor who is framed for murder by his previously unknown twin, and is forced to go on the run from the FBI in order to clear himself of his brother&#x27;s crimes. Easton co-wrote the episode “A.D.”, and also penned the series finale, “The Reckoning”.

In 1997, he landed a role on Damon Wayans’ &quot;413 Hope Street&quot; with Jesse L. Martin and Richard Roundtree. Easton played Nick Carrington, a former drug addict and counselor at an inner-city crisis center. The show tackled topics including the struggles of drug addiction and recovery, homelessness, racism, hate crimes, HIV and AIDS, social justice, income inequality, and disproportionate Black conviction and incarceration. Easton later described the experience as one of the most creatively and personally rewarding of his career.

In 1998, Easton was featured in a multi-episode arc of &quot;Ally McBeal&quot; as Glenn, for which one episode was awarded a Primetime Emmy. He went on to play the role in a short arc on the award-winning series &quot;The Practice&quot;. Both shows were the brainchildren of producer David E. Kelley.
The Showtime series &quot;Total Recall 2070&quot; featured him in the leading role as David Hume, a detective partnered with a sentient and self-aware android. The series was shot in Toronto, and is a loose adaptation of Philip K. Dick’s short story &quot;We Can Remember It for You Wholesale&quot; and novel &quot;Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep?&quot;. The classic cult film &quot;Blade Runner&quot; was also a major influence on the series’ narrative tone and visual style, exploring themes of eugenics, class/caste systems, rule by minority, and oligarchy juxtaposed with human rights and individual rights and autonomy. 

Easton returned to Daytime with ABC&#x27;s &quot;Port Charles&quot;, a spinoff of &quot;General Hospital&quot; that took a more supernatural turn, as he helped shape and create the vampire antagonist Caleb Morley. 

When &quot;Port Charles&quot; ended, Michael began work as Detective John McBain on &quot;One Life to Live&quot; in 2003 – a role he played for the next nine years. Easton reprised his &quot;One Life to Live&quot; role on &quot;General Hospital.&quot; He rejoined the GH cast on March 22, 2016, playing Dr. Hamilton Finn, an infectious disease specialist and epidemiologist with a penchant for waistcoats and a bearded dragon named Roxy . His performance as the character battled addiction and subsequent struggle in withdrawal and recovery earned him a Daytime Emmy nomination in 2018. He exited the role after eight years, departing with his final episode airing June 27, 2024. 

==Writing/Directing==
Easton is a prolific novelist, screenwriter and director. His 2011 graphic novel trilogy &quot;Soul Stealer&quot; was a critical success and praised by Ain&#x27;t It Cool News as &quot;Graphic Novel of the Year&quot; in 2010. The story, combined with artist Christopher Shy&#x27;s visualizations, made a collaborative partnership of words and pictures.

Easton has also maintained a long friendship with Peter Straub – who had been a dedicated &quot;One Life to Live&quot; viewer. The author visited the set in New York and left a copy of &quot;Koko&quot; in Easton&#x27;s mailbox. It was a novel Michael&#x27;s mother had loved and which he had been reading to her during her last days of battling cancer. Years later, Easton collaborated with Straub to write the horror graphic novel &quot;The Green Woman&quot; for DC Comics. Easton&#x27;s most recent solo novel is &quot;Credence&quot;, published by Blackwatch Comics.

A member of the Writers Guild of America, Michael also adapted and wrote the screenplay for &quot;Daedelus is Dead&quot;, a short film based on an unfinished script by Doors legend Jim Morrison. The film has screened at more than a dozen major film festivals and was bought by The Sundance Channel. His feature detailing the life of actor Montgomery Clift is being produced by Relativity Media, while another screenplay about Ella Fitzgerald is in development with Norman Lear.

In 2015, he also wrote and directed short films &quot;Dreamliner&quot; and the award-winning &quot;Ultraviolent&quot; – both starring his friend and former OLTL castmate Trevor St. John. In 2020 he teamed up again with St. John, and former co-stars Sherri Saum and Rebecca Budig on the short film &quot;About a Girl&quot;, written by Budig and directed by Easton. The film won the Outstanding Achievement Award in the 2020 Best Shorts Film Festival, praising the “Deft direction, beautiful craft, and achingly authentic performance by Budig.” 

Easton&#x27;s collection of poetry, &quot;Eighteen Straight Whiskeys,&quot; was initially written while on a four-month break in Paris, France in the aftermath of his mother&#x27;s death. The first and second editions of the book both sold out. The 20th Anniversary Collector&#x27;s Edition was released in 2018, updated with thirty new poems and a new cover design by Chip Kidd. The Hollywood Reporter praised the work as “A 96-page collection of hard-edged musings on drinking and drugs...not flowery paeans to romance, lost love, or lyrical pastoral introspections”

==Books/Screenplays==

===&quot;Eighteen Straight Whiskeys&quot;===

&quot;Eighteen Straight Whiskeys&quot; is a collection of poetry. The first printing was in 1994 and the second in 1998; both sold out. A third, signed Collector&#x27;s Edition with thirty new poems was released by Bowery Press in 2018.

===&quot;Soul Stealer&quot;===

&quot;Soul Stealer&quot; is a graphic novel series about a Frankenstein-like protagonist, Kalan, who searches for his lost love Oxania over the span of several centuries. The horror-fantasy trilogy was illustrated by artist Christopher Shy and released by Blackwatch Comics, with a foreword by Peter Straub.
===&quot;Credence&quot;===

In 2013, Easton released &quot;Credence&quot; with Blackwatch Comics. 

Easton released a video and special preview edition of the sequel novel, with art by Steven Perkins, at San Diego Comic-Con in 2015.

===&quot;The Green Woman&quot;===

Easton co-wrote &quot;The Green Woman&quot; for Vertigo Comics (a division of DC Comics) with award-winning horror writer Peter Straub. The artwork was by John Bolton. 

Straub&#x27;s novels have received several notable honors, including the Bram Stoker Award, World Fantasy Award, and International Horror Guild Award. &quot;The Green Woman&quot; was his first graphic novel collaboration.

===Screenplays===

Easton&#x27;s screenplay &quot;Beautiful Loser&quot;, a biopic of Montgomery Clift, is currently in development. Producer Norman Lear subsequently tapped him to write the screenplay &quot;Queen of Jazz&quot;, about Ella Fitzgerald&#x27;s life and legacy. While working on &quot;Two&quot; as the series lead, he also wrote the episodes “A.D.” and &quot;The Reckoning&quot;.

In 2001 Easton adapted a short film based on an unfinished screenplay by Doors front man Jim Morrison. &quot;Daedelus is Dead&quot; appeared at more than a dozen film festivals and was later bought by The Sundance Channel.

In 2015, Easton&#x27;s &quot;Ultraviolent&quot;, chronicling the last, bizarre night of filmmaker Donald Cammell, won the Best Shorts Showcase at LA Shorts Fest and was awarded the Grand Prize at both the Barcelona and Canadian International Film Festivals. He followed up with &quot;First Strike Butcher Knife,&quot; which premiered at the 2017 Los Angeles Film Festival.

==Personal life==
Easton married model Ginevra Arabia in 2004. The couple has two children: Lilah Bell, born on April 15, 2011, and Jack Boru, born on September 7, 2013.

<text>Yahoo! Music Radio (formerly known as LAUNCHcast) was an Internet radio service. The service, which featured both an advertising supported free version and a subscription fee-based premium version, allowed users to create personalized Internet radio stations by rating songs selected by a recommender system. Users were also able to listen to music from 150 preset Internet radio stations.

==History==
The service was developed by Todd Beaupré and Jeff Boulter of LAUNCH Media and debuted on November 11, 1999. In June 2001, after the bursting of the dot-com bubble, the company faced financial difficulty and was acquired by Yahoo! for $12 million, after which it was integrated into Yahoo! Music. At that time, the service had 7.4 million users.

In December 2008, the service was integrated into CBS Radio due to a rise in royalty rates, with CBS taking full control of the service, including advertising and sales and adding compatibility with Firefox and Safari.

The service was integrated into iHeartRadio in June 2012, providing listeners exclusive access to music events such as the iHeartRadio Music Festival. The service was shut down in early 2014 without any announcement.

==Legal issues==
In January 2003, the company settled a lawsuit with Sony Music over its license covering use of Sony-owned recordings.

On April 27, 2007, Yahoo defeated Sony BMG in a copyright infringement lawsuit involving LAUNCHcast&#x27;s personalization features. At issue was whether or not LAUNCHcast&#x27;s &quot;personal radio station&quot; constitutes an &quot;interactive&quot; service, which requires a negotiated license agreement with a record company, or a &quot;non-interactive&quot; service, which requires a cheaper &quot;compulsory license&quot; from SoundExchange. In an &quot;interactive&quot; service, users can play songs on demand, but with LAUNCHcast they can only influence whether or not a particular song appears in their station.

After a six-year litigation, a jury decided that LAUNCHcast was not required to negotiate licenses as an &quot;interactive&quot; service, and that the service&#x27;s compulsory licenses as a &quot;non-interactive&quot; service were sufficient. The plaintiffs appealed the decision but on August 21, 2009, the United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit upheld the lower court&#x27;s decision, finding that users did not have sufficient control over the playlists generated by LAUNCHcast to render it an &quot;interactive service&quot;.

<text>Thomas Jackson Denson (January 20, 1863 – September 14, 1935) was a notable Alabama musician and singing school teacher within the Sacred Harp tradition. 
==Family and marriage==
He was the youngest of the four sons of the Levi Phillip Denson, a farmer, a gold miner in Arbacoochee, Cleburne County and a Methodist minister, and Julia Ann Jones Denson. Thomas J. Denson was born in 1863 in Arbacoochee and named after Stonewall Jackson. He was married to Amanda Burdette, a music and literary teacher, a singer, and song composer, until her death in 1910; she was the younger sister of Sidney Burdette, his brother&#x27;s wife. They had five children: two sons, Paine W. Denson and William Howard Denson; and three daughters, Anna Eugenia Denson, Maggie Francis Denson, and Jarusha (Aunt Rush/Ruth) Henrietta Denson. In 1914, he married Lola Mahalia Akers, with whom he had three daughters: Violet Denson Hinton, Vera Denson Nunn, and Tommye Mahalia Denson Mauldin.
==Career==
Along with his brother Seaborn McDaniel Denson, Thomas Denson formed the Sacred Harp Publishing Co. In 1933 they purchased the rights to the 1911 J. S. James &quot;Sacred Harp&quot; and began a revision of it. This revision, known as the &quot;Original Sacred Harp (Denson Revision)&quot;, was published in 1936. A. M. Cagle worked for Denson early in his life, and took lessons with the elder musician as well; Denson would go on to become Cagle&#x27;s brother-in-law for a brief time.

Thomas J. Denson was a popular singing school professor and taught singing schools from Georgia to Texas. Some claim that he taught more Sacred Harp singers than any other man. He was affectionately known to many as &quot;Uncle Tom.&quot; 
==Recognition==
A granite monument to the memory of Thomas J. and Seaborn M. Denson was erected on the courthouse square in Double Springs, Alabama. This was done in 1944, the centennial year of the Sacred Harp. Part of the inscription reads, &quot;By the loving hands of their families, pupils of their singing schools, and legions of singers and friends.&quot; .
==Death==
Thomas J. Denson died September 14, 1935. When he died suddenly in a community near Jasper, Alabama, he was preparing to go to a singing. Mrs. Edwards wrote in the hymnal: &quot;Birmingham news reporters estimated a crowd of 15,000 people in attendance&quot; at Fairview Cemetery in Double Springs His brother Seaborn died in 1936, and Tom&#x27;s son, Paine Denson worked with his sister Ruth Denson Edwards and other members of the revision committee to see the &quot;Denson&quot; edition of the Sacred Harp through to completion.

<text>MHSnet is a store-and-forward Message Handling System for wide area networks. MHSnet and its precursor, SUNIII, were used to implement the Australian Computer Science network, commonly known as ACSnet, which connected Australia&#x27;s Universities to each other and to ARPANET.

MHSnet was originally developed at the University of Sydney by Piers Lauder and Bob Kummerfeld and was originally known as SUNIII (Sydney University Network version 3). Technically, it is similar in concept to UUCP in that it enabled the transfer of email, Usenet, and files in an efficient manner over non-dedicated links. In addition, it supported dynamic routing and a hierarchical name space avoiding the limitations of hardwired network addresses.

MHSnet was a key technology in the introduction of Internet access in Australia. Due to the prohibitive costs of telecommunications structure, and the small amount of bandwidth available both internally and to other countries, MHSnet provided a system that could more efficiently use network resources. Gateways between ACSnet and the Internet were provided by many universities, and access to non-academic users was granted in the early 1990s.

In 1989, with the introduction of AARNet which directly connected Australia&#x27;s Universities to the Internet, the ACSnet and MHSnet became obsolete.

ACSnet connected hosts in Australia resided in a .oz domain, which was moved into the Internet&#x27;s .au namespace as .oz.au.

<text>Belmullet (, IPA:[ˌbʲeːlənˠˈwʊɾˠhəd̪ˠ]) is a coastal Gaeltacht town with a population of 1,019 on the Mullet Peninsula in the barony of Erris, County Mayo, Ireland. It is the commercial and cultural heart of the barony of Erris, which has a population of almost 10,000. According to the 2016 census 50% of people in the town were able to speak Irish while only 4% spoke it on a daily basis outside the education system.

Belmullet has two bays, Blacksod Bay and Broadhaven Bay, linked by Carter&#x27;s Canal running through the town.

==History==
The origin of the name &quot;Belmullet&quot; is not clear. It may have come from Irish &quot;Béal Muileat&quot; or &quot;Béal an Mhuileat&quot;, which has been translated as &quot;mouth of the isthmus&quot;. Bernard O&#x27;Hara in &quot;Mayo: Aspects of its Heritage&quot; suggests that &quot;A change from &#x27;L&#x27; to &#x27;R&#x27;, which is quite common in Irish, may have given &quot;Béal an Mhuireat&quot; which in turn became &quot;Béal an Mhuirhead&quot;&quot;. It has also been suggested that the latter half of the name may refer to the fish or the star shape used in heraldry.

===18th century===
According to Richard Pococke, in about 1715, Sir Arthur Shaen &quot;began building a little town&quot; where Belmullet now stands. During the reign of Queen Elizabeth I, an admiral chased pirates into Broadhaven Bay, hauled his boats across the isthmus, and caught up with them near the Iniskea Islands. To drain the area and form a passageway from Blacksod Bay into Broadhaven Bay, Shaen had a canal excavated, known thereafter as Shaen&#x27;s Cut, large enough for small boats to pass through from one bay to the other. However, little development of the town occurred, and by 1752 the canal was choked up and impassable. Belmullet was the scene of Monster meetings of the Land League at the end of the 19th century. In the early 19th century Belmullet consisted of little more than a few thatched buildings.

===19th century===
In 1820, the first post office in Erris opened in the new town of Belmullet. In 1822, a coastguard station was built. William Henry Carter had inherited huge tracts of Shaen&#x27;s land in Erris when he married Shaen&#x27;s daughter and began to put plans in place to develop the town. William Henry Carter had inherited huge tracts of Shaen&#x27;s land in Erris when he married Shaen&#x27;s daughter and began to put plans in place to develop the town. Carter tasked engineer and Castlebar native Patrick Knight to design and plan the new town between Broadhaven and Blacksod bays. Knight published his town plan in his 1836 treatise &quot;Erris in the Irish Highlands,&quot; where he described Belmullet as a &#x27;mirage in the desert&#x27;, positioned between two sheltered bays which provided potentially safe anchorage for Atlantic trade. A new road was built which connected Belmullet with Castlebar, which was completed in 1824. In 1825, Carter built a pier large enough to accommodate vessels of 100 tons. Carter&#x27;s stated objective was to &quot;create a home market for produce that did not previously exist nearer than thirty miles by land,&quot; and his aim was to thrust the older village of An Geata Mór (Binghamstown), a village founded by the powerful Bingham family on the Mullet peninsula into a secondary position. By 1826, the Erris Hotel was opened.

In 1829, Alexander Nimmo, an engineer on the Erris roads, wrote the following: &quot;at Belmullet, the advance is quite surprising; the place only commenced four years ago; it now consists of about seventy respectable houses etc... five ships were loaded with grain and kept; iron hoops and coal were imported; spirits, beer and wine. British manufacturers and tea and sugar were sold; the produce of the fisheries were admitted to a market.&quot;
In 1836, Patrick Knight documented in his book &quot;Erris in the Irish Highlands&quot; that during the construction of the Belmullet-Bangor road, workers &quot;unnecessarily destroyed the fine dolmen in the glen rather than divert the road a few feet to one side&quot;.

By 1831, the population of Belmullet was 585. A Roman Catholic chapel was built in 1832 at the cost of £300. There was a daily postal service between Ballina and Belmullet. In 1833, a courthouse was built also costing £300 which held weekly court sessions, demonstrating that the town was rapidly growing. In the 1830s, a visitor described it as &quot;the youngest town in Ireland and like all young things it is comparatively fresh and fair. The town itself contains a few thatched cabins but consists of small streets of moderately sized slated houses branching from a little square, or market place; the shops looked to be well furnished with not only necessaries but articles conducive to comfort and convenience. Buildings are going on and speculation is progressing.&quot; He also commented that the approach to the town was &quot;spoiled by deformed, wretched bog huts.&quot; Two new roads were built – one to the east went to Ballycastle and one to the south to Newport. The export of meal from the area to England started. The local Protestant Church was built in 1843. In 1845, work began to re-open the canal which had been constructed by Arthur Shaen. Because of the Irish Famine, the canal was not completed until 1851. During the Relief work for the Distress (in the middle of the Great Famine) in 1846 and 1847, the footpaths were formed and flagged.

In the latter half of the 19th century rural unrest was a common occurrence across Mayo. In November 1881, over 100 police officers needed in order to protect two process servers who were serving writs in the town. The police were confronted by an angry crowd throwing rocks and sticks. The police were obliged to charge the crowd and fire buckshot resulting in a large number of injuries. The police made 20 arrests.

A workhouse was erected on the site of the current hospital. The Head of the Treasury, Charles Trevelyan, notoriously decreed that relief was only to be given to workhouse people. Starving people crowded to the workhouse. At one stage at the height of the Famine, 3,000 people were recorded as being in Belmullet workhouse.
The area around Belmullet was severely impacted by the Great Irish Famine in the 19th century and in the next 100 years many people emigrated from the area to the United States and to England. Throughout the second half of the 19th century, many proposals were made regarding the development of a railway line in to Belmullet and Erris region. Three routes were surveyed and discussed:

*Route One: Ballina – Ballycastle – Belmullet
*Route Two: Newport – Mulrany – Belmullet
*Route Three: Ballina – Crossmolina – Belmullet

People along these routes lobbied for the railway lines to pass through their district. However the merchants of Belmullet were more skeptical and feared that the introduction of a railway line would adversely affect their trading position, putting Ballina within easy reach of the population. Plans for a Blacksod railway terminus, which would have served trans-Atlantic shipping, were therefore postponed. Many still pressed the authorities for a rail line, and this movement gained momentum during the latter days of the First World War, when it was proposed that a line would improve lines of communication between both London and Canada, and between London and the United States. However, when the war ended in 1918, the hopes for a railway service to Blacksod ended with it. In the early 1920, the Sligo Steam Navigation Company ran weekly sailings between Belmullet, Sligo and Liverpool.

In July 1865, two local men – Richard Barrett and James Hogan were found guilty of piracy. They were convicted of plundering the schooner Elizabeth McClure of Indian meal near the island of Iniskea. Both men were sentenced to five years hard labour.

Belmullet established a monthly cattle fair, and the town began to take trade from &quot;An Geatta Mór&quot;. The Bingham family fought back, but their village was more or less deserted by the cattle traders by the late 19th century.

===Early 20th century===

John Millington Synge, author of &quot;The Playboy of the Western World&quot; and &quot;&quot;, visited Belmullet in 1904, and reported: &quot;Belmullet in the evening is noisy and squalid, lonely and crowded at the same time and without appeal to the imagination. So at least one stays for a moment. When one has passed six times up and down hearing a gramophone in one house, a fiddle in the next, then an accordion and a fragment of a traditional lullaby, with many crying babies, pigs and donkeys and noisy girls and young men jostling in the darkness, the effect is not indistinct. All the light comes from doors or windows of shops. Last night was St. John’s Eve and bonfires were lighted all over the country, the largest of all being placed at the Town Square at Belmullet. Today, again, there was a large market in the square, where a number of country people, with their horses and donkeys, stood about bargaining for young pigs, heather brooms, homespun flannels, second hand clothing, blackening brushes, tinker’s goods and many other articles&quot;.

=== Irish War of Independence ===
One of the two R.I.C. Policemen killed in the January 1919 Soloheadbeg ambush – Constable McDonnell – was born in Belmullet. The event triggered the War of Independence. Constable McDonnell was 50 at the time of his death. He left a widow and five children.

On 26 October 1919 a young boy was shot and wounded by a sentry guarding the local wireless station. The boy was driving cows near his home early in the morning, when he was shot in the shoulder. The incident caused great indignation among the local population.

In June 1920, an R.I.C. policeman was killed and three were injured during a riot on the main street of the town. The policemen intervened to arrest a man for causing a disturbance during a fair. The crowd attending the fair resented the intervention and turned on the police officers. The police retreated and took refuge in a house, One of the officers – Constable Doogue – was later discovered on the street with a wound to the head. When the doctor arrived, he was found to be dead.

In late August 1920, the local Coastguard station was attacked. The raiders were interrupted by a police patrol, and shots were exchanged. The raiders escaped but not before the station was destroyed.

During the latter stages of the conflict, a Republican Court was established in the town. In January 1921 Two Ballina Solicitors – P. J. Ruttledge and Henry Bourke – were arrested and charged by the British military authorities for participating in the court. Mr. Ruttledge declined to recognize the British court and was subsequently jailed in Castlebar.

A breach of the Anglo Irish Truce occurred in the Town in October 1921. Two Republican Policemen were quelling a row that broke out in the evening after the town&#x27;s regular fair. The Republican policemen were attacked by six R.I.C. officers. The fighting escalated as more RIC and IRA men joined the affray. Later, shots were exchanged by the two sides.

=== Irish Civil War ===
The conflict was fought between two opposing groups of Irish nationalists: those who supported the Anglo-Irish Treaty under which the Irish Free state was established, and the republican opposition, for whom the Treaty represented a betrayal of the Irish Republic. When hostilities broke out, Belmullet was under the control of the Republican opposition, also known as irregulars.

During the early weeks of the Civil War, Belmullet was under the control of the Irregulars. However, support for the Republican cause was not universal. A prominent member of the North Mayo brigade of the IRA – Mr P. Kelly – was arrested by the Irregulars due to his support of the government. Kelly was the Assistant Clerk of the Belmullet Union. In July 1922, the National Army entered Mayo and established control over the county on behalf of the Free State government. However, Irregular activity continued in Belmullet for months after. In September, Irregulars entered the town, took petrol and left. The National Army pursued the irregulars and arrested six of them. In October 1922, Irregulars established temporary control over the town. They stopped all traffic and raided all the banks in the town taking away a large sum of money. They also forced all the local public houses to pay a &quot;Republican licensing fee&quot;. The mail van was also held up.

=== Second World War ===
On 6 August 1940, during the Second World War, Garda William Cullen of Belmullet station received a phone call from coast-watchers at the nearby Annagh Head lookout post. He learned that the Atlantic currents had washed ashore the body of a British soldier. From his army pay-book, Cullen identified 21-year-old Donald Domican of the 5th Battalion, the Welsh Regiment. On the evening of 6 August, Domican&#x27;s body was brought to Belmullet hospital. He was buried the following day at the Church of Ireland cemetery in the town. The next day another body of a British soldier was washed up at the same site.

=== Post-War ===
In 1958, Belmullet became the site of a conflict between Erskine Childers, Minister of Lands, and local workmen who refused to construct a fence through an area thought to be occupied by fairies. The Government was unable to find other workers to build the fence, so finally relented and &quot;bent&quot; the fence around the disputed hill.

===21st century===
In the early 21st century, improvement in the Irish economy has reversed population decline, and Belmullet has seen some immigration. Despite job losses in the area since the recession started in 2007, as with all over Ireland, Belmullet and the Mullet Peninsula has good natural resources in terms of fishing, tourism and small local industries are present such as Mayo Mats and the Corrib Gas terminal.

==Culture and tourism==
Although officially part of the Mayo Gaeltacht, it is both an English- and Irish-speaking town. The area plays host in summer months to students enrolled in local Irish language summer schools.

John Millington Synge&#x27;s play &quot;The Playboy of the Western World&quot; was based on his experience of the Belmullet area. Synge also wrote a poem entitled &quot;Danny&quot; about a character who was murdered by a group of local men as he was on his way back into Belmullet from Bangor Erris.

The area is popular for fishing, with both fresh-water and sea-angling off Broadhaven Bay. Watersports are also common, with surfing, windsurfing, kitesurfing and sailing.

Belmullet is the nearest town to the Carne Golf Links, the last complete design from renowned Irish golf architect Eddie Hackett, frequently listed in the top 100 golf courses in the world.

This area of Erris was the setting for the Ulster Cycle legend of the Táin Bó Flidhais or the Mayo Táin.

In 2007, a new arts centre, Áras Inis Gluaire, opened in the town. Its mission was to become a leading bilingual arts centre in Ireland. As well as serving as the towns library and art gallery, the centre has a state of the art theatre, which has seen many accomplished artists perform in the town, among them being Mick Flannery and Damien Dempsey.
Since being included on the Wild Atlantic Way, and after the wider Erris region was named &#x27;Best Place to Go Wild in Ireland&#x27; by The Irish Times in 2014, the town has experienced an increase in tourism.

==Festivals==
*Féile Iorras – International Arts Festival held in the town for a period of about ten days each July. It was set up in 1996 by Mayo County Council Arts Office to promote understanding and integration between the people of Erris and communities throughout the world. The festival encompasses all forms of folk art from dancing to visual arts to music. All the pubs in Belmullet participate.
*Lá an Logha – 15 August (also known as Ladies Day) each year sees the busiest time of the year in the town. This festival started off as a farmer&#x27;s market and a day for men to propose to their future wives and go parading around the town with her on this special day.
*Féile na Seachtaine, another arts based festival follows Lá an Logha. The town&#x27;s annual Heritage Day is held during this time. Many people who have emigrated from Erris return to the area during the month of August.

==Climate==

==Transport==
The Belmullet Aerodrome is located west of the town.

Bus Éireann route 446 links Belmullet with Bangor Erris, Crossmolina and Ballina. There is one service a day in each direction, including Sundays. On Friday evenings an extra journey operates from Ballina. Onward bus and rail connections are available at Ballina.

<doc id="818067" wikidata="Q17080885" url="?curid=818067" title="Initiatives of Change">
<text>Initiatives of Change (IofC) is a global organisation dedicated to &quot;building trust across the world&#x27;s divides&quot; of culture, nationality, belief, and background. Initiatives of Change was known as Moral Re-Armament (MRA) from 1938 to 2001, and the Oxford Group starting in 1929.

==Principles==
These principles are taken from those of the organization&#x27;s predecessor, Moral Re-Armament (MRA), founded in 1938 by Frank Buchman. Initiatives of Change has spiritual roots but no religious affiliation, and invites &quot;those with a faith...both to explore the roots of their own tradition, and to discover and respect the beliefs of others.&quot;
The name &quot;Initiatives of Change&quot; was adopted in 2001, expressing the emphasis of the organization in effecting social change beginning with personal change.

==Programs==
Initiatives of Change has programs in over 60 countries. In the United States, Hope in the Cities promotes &quot;honest conversations&quot; on race, reconciliation and responsibility. Their approach was integrated in the One America Dialogue Guide published by the White House at the initiative of U.S. President Bill Clinton in 1998. The programme Trust and Integrity in the Global Economy hold events in a number of Western countries, focusing on overcoming corruption and building cooperation. In Switzerland, the Caux Forum for Human Security, brings together people working for peace and human security. In India, the IC Centre for Governance works with development experts, policy makers, social activists and others to strengthen the role of citizens in governance. Foundations for Freedom aims to support the development of democratic societies in Central and Eastern Europe. In Sierra Leone, Hope Sierra Leone is active in reconciling and rebuilding the country ravaged by civil war. In France &quot;&quot; (Education for Peace) is teaching students about civic responsibility, including the skills of conflict resolution.

Since 1991, when it was launched at the Initiatives of Change conference centre in Caux, Switzerland, the Creators of Peace (CoP) global peacemakers network has been active in many countries, particularly in Africa.

==Initiatives of Change International==
Initiatives of Change International, a non-governmental organization based in Caux, Switzerland, is the legal and administrative entity that coordinates the national bodies of Initiatives of Change; It holds Special Consultative Status with the United Nations Economic and Social Council, and Participatory Status at the Council of Europe. Its first president was Cornelio Sommaruga, formerly President of the International Committee of the Red Cross. He was succeeded by Mohamed Sahnoun, formerly Senior Advisor to UN Secretary-General Kofi Annan. In 2009 Prof. Rajmohan Gandhi, historian and biographer of his grandfather Mahatma Gandhi, was elected president. In 2012 Dr Omnia Marzouk, a paediatrician originally from Egypt and now based in UK, was elected president. In 2014 Initiatives of Change was awarded the Ousseimi Prize for Tolerance. In 2019 Suresh Vazirani, founder of one of India&#x27;s largest medical diagnostic companies, was elected president. Gerald Pillay, Vice Chancellor and Rector of Liverpool Hope University in England, took over from Suresh Vazirani in January 2022. 

==Conference centres==
Initiatives of Change has centres in numerous countries. The largest conference centres are Mountain House, formerly the Caux Palace Hotel in Caux, near Montreux, and Asia Plateau, in Panchgani in India.

Mountain House was a derelict hotel in 1946, when it was bought by 100 Swiss families, and restored as a place where the warring nations of Europe could meet. In the following years thousands came there, including German Chancellor Adenauer and French Foreign Minister Robert Schuman. At Caux many found reconciliation with former enemies, notably the French socialist leader Irène Laure who had been active in the French Resistance and who, thereafter, devoted herself to building Franco-German understanding. Edward Luttwak described the work of Caux as an &quot;important contribution to one of the greatest achievements in the entire record of modern statecraft: the astonishingly rapid Franco-German reconciliation after 1945.&quot;

In the following decades Caux welcomed people from African and Asian countries moving towards independence from colonial rule. In 1956, soon after Morocco became independent, King Mohammed V of Morocco sent a message to Frank Buchman: &quot;I thank you for all you have done for Morocco in the course of these last testing years.&quot; In 1960 Archbishop Makarios and Dr Kucuk, President and Vice-President of Cyprus, jointly sent the first flag of independent Cyprus to Caux in recognition of the center&#x27;s help. More recently, groups of opposing factions in the Great Lakes area of Africa, Sierra Leone and other areas of conflict, have met there.

Also prominent in the center&#x27;s programs have been meetings between management and unions. The Caux Round Table was launched there in 1986, and continues to meet there. It developed a program of Principles for Business which are now used widely in business and industry. 
Each summer the centre holds a series of conferences dealing with specific subjects, attended by both teenagers and adults. In 2008 the first Caux Forum for Human Security, initiated by Mohamed Sahnoun, brought together 300 people working for peace and human security. and this has developed into an annual conference on &#x27;Just Governance for Human Security&#x27;. &#x27;Land, Lives, Peace&#x27; brings together people from many countries working to restore degraded land to productive use. &#x27;Children as Actors for Transforming Society&#x27; deals with children&#x27;s rights and children&#x27;s participation in partnership with a coalition of civil society organisation such as the Child-to-Child Trust and Learning for Well-being or the International Janusz Korczak Association.

Asia Plateau in India holds conferences throughout most of the year, dealing with ethical governance, cooperation for development and conflict resolution. These bring together workers and managers from many industries, NGO leaders, public servants, and others. It also holds international conferences such as &#x27;Making democracy real&#x27; and &#x27;Dialogue on Just Governance&#x27;, which bring together participants from over 40 countries.

<text>Abaiara is a city in the region of the Kiriri people, in the state of Ceará, Brazil. The population in 2020 was 11,853 people.

== Etymology ==
The city was first named, in 1873, &quot;Distrito de São Pedro&quot;, as a tribute to the Brazilian emperor Pedro II. In 1938 the name was changed to &quot;Pedro Segundo&quot;. In 1943 the city received its current name, &quot;Abaiara&quot;, this name in Tupi means &quot;the lord of men&quot;, (still as a reference and tribute to D. Pedro II).

==History==
Its history goes back to the 19th century, when two farmers, José Leite da Cunha and José Júlio Sampaio, settled in the area.

== Political evolution ==
The first political event occurred just after the creation of the &quot;Distrito da Paz&quot; on March 27, 1873. Abaiara was first elevated to the condition of Vila on December 20, 1938, under the name of &quot;Pedro Segundo&quot;. The name was not very popular with the inhabitants and was soon replaced with the current name on December 30, 1943. Abaiara was elevated to the status of municipality on March 25, 1957.

== Religion ==
The first non-indigenous religious event took place when Father José Antônio de Araújo erected the first church which later became the central point in the city. With the growth of the city and the natural degradation of the first church, it became obvious that a new church was necessary. This second was built next to the first one (to avoid hurting the feelings of the population). The second church was dedicated to the &quot;Immaculate Heart of Mary&quot; and was made possible due to the actions of José Júlio Sampaio. However, the official saint remained &quot;Sacred Heart of Jesus&quot;.

== Climate ==
The climate is warm tropical and semi-arid with rainfall of 669 millimeters and concentrated rains between January and April. The average temperature is between 30 °C and 18 °C.

<text>Jericoacoara is a virgin beach hidden behind the dunes of the west coast of Jijoca de Jericoacoara, Ceará, Brazil. Selected by &quot;The Washington Post&quot; as one of the Top 10 most beautiful beaches in the world, &quot;Jeri&quot; consists of blue lagoons, calm seas and huge dunes.

==Etymology==
The name &quot;Jericoaquara&quot; comes from the Tupi language and means &quot;lair of the turtles&quot; (&quot;îurukûá&quot; means &quot;sea turtle&quot; and &quot;kûara&quot; means &quot;lair, hole&quot;).

==History==

In 1984, the area around Jericoacoara was declared an environmental protection area. It became national park in 2002. As a result, many restrictions on building and tourism were introduced to help preserve the area. The distance to bigger cities and limited road access also helped to keep the beach and the village isolated.

Fairly recently, Jeri was just a fishing village with little contact with modern life. Electricity was generated by diesel engines, and street lighting was provided only by the moon and the stars. After the selection by &quot;The Washington Post&quot; was published, tourism grew rapidly, and the beach village became a popular destination. Electricity arrived in 1998, and today hot showers and air conditioning are no longer luxuries. However, electrical street illumination is still forbidden by local law.

==Characteristics==
Getting to Jeri can still be challenging. The road from Fortaleza to Jericoacoara presents beaches and rustic villages. The last 45 minutes of the journey takes place off-road, among dunes and along a beach. It is one of several places in Brazil from which one can see the sun sink into the ocean. Both visitors and locals often view this show from the tall &quot;sunset dune&quot; just next to the village.

The village has streets covered in sand from the dunes. Jericoacoara is a popular spot for windsurfing, kitesurfing and sailing.

==Attractions==

*Duna do Pôr do Sol: Sunset Dune
*Igreja de Nossa Senhora da Consolação: Church of Our Lady of Consolation
*Serrote: rock formation about 95 feet tall

<text>Caxias do Sul () is a city in Rio Grande do Sul, Southern Brazil, situated in the state&#x27;s mountainous Serra Gaúcha region. It was established by Italian immigrants on June 20, 1890. Today it is the second largest city in the state of Rio Grande do Sul. In 2020, the population of Caxias do Sul was estimated at 517,451 people, many of whom are of Italian and German descent. The demonym of the citizens of Caxias do Sul is &quot;Caxiense&quot;.

== History ==


The history of Caxias do Sul began before the arrival of the Italian immigrants when the region was being roamed by cattlemen and occupied by Indigenous peoples. The region was called &quot;Indians&#x27; Field&quot; in that period. The arrival of Italian immigrants, mostly farmers in search of a better life from the Veneto, Lombardy, Trento (northern Italy) as well as other regions in Italy, began in 1875 in Nova Milano. Although they received governmental support such as tools, supplies, and seeds, everything had to be reimbursed to the federal government.

Two years later, the colonial headquarters of the Indians&#x27; Field was given the name Caxias Colony. The town was created on July 20, 1890, and acknowledged in the same year, on August 24. Many economic cycles marked the evolution of the city throughout that century. The first one is connected to the most significant aspect of its cultural identity: the cultivation of vineyards and the production of wine, first for its own consumption, and later on, for commercialization.

On June 1, 1910, Caxias do Sul was elevated to the category of city. On the same day, the first train arrived connecting the region to the state capital. Although the immigrants were farmers, many of them worked in other economic sectors. They settled down, urbanized the region, and started a fast-paced process of industrialization.

In the countryside, subsistence agriculture concentrates on the cultivation of grapes, wheat, and corn. Home-based manufacturing started to emerge and overproduction was commercialized. Home-based manufacturing and Caxias do Sul evolved from having small home-based workshops to large scale factories, some of which are known internationally.

Nowadays, Caxias do Sul is an important city, and due to its industrious colonists, is home to vast vineyards, wineries, a varied industrial park, and a rich and dynamic market. Those attributes grant the land great importance; for such reason Caxias do Sul is often called &quot;Pearl of the Colonies&quot;, is considered the center of the Italian presence in Southern Brazil.

Today Caxias do Sul is one of the region&#x27;s central hubs, hosting some of Brazil&#x27;s most diverse economies besides its size; with its industrial parks, vast vineyards, wine commerce, cattle and plantation farms give the land a further dimension.

==Caxiense==
A &quot;Caxiense&quot; () is a citizen of the city of Caxias do Sul. A possible anglicization of Caxiense would be &quot;Caxian&quot;. Caxiense is also the name of a bus line with headquarters in Caxias do Sul. Caxiense provides transport service with a fleet of coaches to cities in the Serra Gaúcha. Caxiense also offers a bus service from Caxias do Sul to Porto Alegre and the Porto Alegre Salgado Filho International Airport.

== Demographics ==
The following table shows the development of the number of inhabitants according to census data of IBGE.

== Culture ==

Culture in Caxias do Sul was not greatly favoured by the first Italian settlers, as they were mostly involved with survival concerns in an area until then unexplored. In the beginning of the 20th century, however, there was some cultural interest developing, and some sculptors, painters and decorators made a significant career in the city and around, like as Pietro Stangherlin, Francisco Meneguzzo and the Zambelli family. They left the first examples of artworks worth of mention, specially in sacred art and building decoration. Julio Calegari and Ulysses Geremia, both photographers, also deserve close attention for their huge collections of portraits and views of the old city.

As of historical architecture, one may find a few eclectic houses built for rich families, public buildings and Neo-Gothic churches, like as the Cathedral and the Chapel of the Holy Sepulchre. The first houses of the immigrants, made of stone, and later traditional wooden buildings, nearly all disappeared as the city developed, but some survive in the rural area, as well as many old chapels. Current laws protect every building older than 50 years, but many have been destroyed or altered, despite official protection.

The city nowadays has many intensely active museums and cultural centers, both private and official, and the Universidade de Caxias do Sul (UCS) which sponsors an art gallery, a museum, a huge library and a symphonic orchestra.

The city hosted the 2022 Summer Deaflympics between May 1 to 15, 2022, postponed two times due to the COVID-19 pandemic, becoming the first ever Deaflympics to be ever held in South America and the Latin America.

Visitors may eat cheese, grapes and various Brazilian wines. Visitors interested in the regions wine can also visit the Château Lacave Castle, a 6th Century-style medieval structure that currently functions as a winery. Caxias do Sul is also one of the four settlements along the Caminhos da Colônia scenic tourist route in the Serra Gaúcha.

<text>Seaborn McDaniel Denson (1854 – April 18, 1936) was a notable Alabama musician and singing school teacher within the Sacred Harp tradition. He was a son of The Rev. Levi Phillips Denson, a Methodist minister, and Julia Ann Jones Denson. Seaborn Denson was born April 9, 1854, in Arbacoochee, Alabama. He married Sidney Burdette.

S. M. Denson wrote most of the alto lines that were added to the 1911 J. S. James &quot;Original Sacred Harp&quot;. Along with his brother Thomas Jackson Denson, Seaborn Denson formed the Sacred Harp Publishing Co. In 1933 they purchased the rights to James&#x27; &quot;Sacred Harp&quot; and began a revision. This revision, known as the &quot;Original Sacred Harp (Denson Revision)&quot;, was published in 1936. Both died before its publication and Paine Denson, Thomas J.&#x27;s son, saw the &quot;Denson&quot; edition of the Sacred Harp through to completion.
A granite monument to the memory of Thomas J. and Seaborn M. Denson was erected on the courthouse square in Double Springs, Alabama. This was done in 1944, the centennial year of the Sacred Harp. Part of the inscription reads &quot;By the loving hands of their families, pupils of their singing schools, and legions of singers and friends.&quot;

A. M. Cagle, himself later to become an important figure in the Sacred Harp movement, studied music under Seaborn Denson.

<text>Scottish nationalism promotes the idea that the Scottish people form a cohesive nation and national identity.

Scottish nationalism began to shape from 1853 with the National Association for the Vindication of Scottish Rights, progressing into the Scottish National Movement in the 1920s maturing by the 1970s and achieved its present ideological maturity in the 1980s and 1990s.

The nation&#x27;s origin, political context and unique characteristics including the Gaelic language, poetry and film maintains an individual&#x27;s distinct identification and support of Scotland.

==Origins==
Scottish Nationalism, the concept of Scotland as an individual nation state became prominent within Scotland in the Middle Ages. During the Anglo-Scottish Wars, the campaign led by Scotland was to obtain Scottish independence as a separate sovereign state. The campaign was successful, and following the Declaration of Arbroath, a formal letter sent to Pope John XXII, Scotland, and the nation&#x27;s individual identity were officially recognised as sovereign in 1328.

Scotland proceeded to operate as an independent nation state until the Acts of Union which merged both the Parliaments and Kingdoms of Scotland and England in 1707 to be &quot;united into one Kingdom of Great Britain&quot;, a united state retaining separate legal system, however a distinct Scottish institution continues to exist.

==Scottish Nationality==
Scottish national identity, those identifying as Scottish only nationals has been effectively measured over recent years, evaluated officially where Scottish citizens were asked within the UK Census to identify as Scottish only, British and Scottish or just British.

In the last two census completions, the majority of Scottish citizens had identified with predominantly a Scottish only identity on the nationality questionnaire.

In the 2011 Census in Scotland:
*62.4% identified themselves as Scottish only

82% of respondents who took part had selected they had some Scottish National Identity.

In the 2021 Census in Scotland:
*65.5% identified themselves as Scottish only

89.8% of respondents who took part had selected they had some Scottish National Identity.

The UK Office for National Statistics 2021s statement on National identity clarifies that National identity is a self-determined assessment of their own identity; it could be the country or countries where they feel they belong or think of as home. It is not dependent on ethnic group or citizenship. Respondents could select more than one national identity.

From measurable statistics, the 2021 UK census held had concluded that the majority of Scottish nationals, those in Scotland identify Scotland as their only Nation or country, supporting the idea that the Scottish people form a cohesive nation and national identity.

==Language==
Scottish Gaelic, also known as the founding or Native language of Scotland is currently the oldest Scottish language still in use today.

The History of Scottish Gaelic itself has been through a tremendous legacy of turmoil, from Scots nobles learning only English as a first language as far back as the 13th century, the implementation of the Statutes of Iona in 1609 forcing Scots nobles to learn English, or the 1616 Education Act implemented by the Scottish Privy Council which declared that no heir of a Gaelic chief could inherit unless he could write, read and speak English

Around ten such Acts were raised between 1494 and 1698, passed by the Scots Parliament to make English the first language, Gaelic had struggled to retain a foothold over Scotland. As Scotland and Great Britain were united under the Acts of Union 1707, Gaelic lost its legitimacy as a legal and administrative language. Gaelic did however continued to gain importance as the language of the Highland clans, and the language of the Jacobites.

Prior to the Education (Scotland) Act 1872, the Act of Proscription 1746 was implemented to assimilate Highland Scots into Lowland &amp; British culture. Following the Government victory over the Jacobites,
Jacobitism as a significant political force diminished, Highland dress was outlawed, banned, and Highland culture &amp; Language deterred, those speaking Gaelic, or wearing highland dress historically received various forms of punishment. On 1 July 1782, royal assent was given to Repeal of the Act Proscribing the Wearing of Highland Dress 22 George III, Chap. 63, 1782 and a proclamation issued in Gaelic and English. Under the Education (Scotland) Act, school attendance was compulsory and only English was taught, or tolerated in the schools of both the Lowlands and the Highlands and Islands. As a result, any student who spoke Scottish Gaelic in the school or on its grounds could expect what Ronald Black calls the, &quot;familiar Scottish experience of being thrashed&quot; for speaking their native language of Gaelic.

Since devolution and the passing of the Gaelic Language (Scotland) Act 2005, Scottish nationalists have spearheaded an effort to bring Scottish Gaelic back from the brink of extinction through the spread of immersion schools funded by the Scottish Parliament.

The lowland Scots Language, previously known as Inglis/Early Scots is a member of the West Germanic languages which also has a reported history of being deterred within Scottish Education. Scots speakers today agree that they have received various forms of punishment for speaking Scots. For this reason, the protection and revival of both Scottish Gaelic and Lowland Scots play a key role in nationalist ideology.

Linguistic independence is primarily associated with the poetry of Robert Burns about the events of the Wars of Scottish Independence, before it experienced a resurgence during the Scottish Renaissance, as led by Hugh MacDiarmid.

==Politics==
Within politics, Scottish nationalism was held as a key ideology by the National Party of Scotland which later became the Scottish National Party (SNP). Their rise in popularity since being elected to government at Holyrood in 2007 led to the 2014 Scottish independence referendum. The referendum was held on Thursday 18 September 2014, and was a victory for the Better Together campaign; who advocated keeping Scotland part of the United Kingdom, with 55% of the Scottish electorate across all 32 council areas voting &quot;No&quot; to independence. However, four of the thirty-two local authority council areas in Scotland did have a majority &quot;Yes&quot; vote in support of independence: Dundee, Glasgow, North Lanarkshire and West Dunbartonshire, which accounted for the wishes of 1,617,989 people who voted in favour of independence across Scotland as a whole.

Despite the nationalist side losing the referendum, the SNP experienced a surge in support in the following months, and won a landslide majority in Scotland at the UK general election the following year; ending 51 years of dominance by Scottish Labour. Many long-serving Labour politicians lost their seats in the biggest political upset in decades, with the SNP winning all but three Scottish House of Commons seats and displacing the Liberal Democrats to become the third party of the United Kingdom; despite only standing for election in Scotland. On Thursday, 23 June 2016, the United Kingdom held a referendum on continuing membership of the European Union, which resulted in 52% of the British electorate voting for the United Kingdom to leave the European Union. A second Scottish independence referendum has been proposed, as 62% of the Scottish electorate voted for the UK to remain in the European Union, and guaranteed prosperity through single market access was part of the Better Together campaign&#x27;s argument to convince the Scottish people to vote to stay part of the UK.

In 2021, former SNP Leader and First Minister of Scotland Alex Salmond launched the Alba Party and announced it would run in the 2021 Scottish Parliament election, to try to achieve &quot;supermajority&quot; for Scottish independence. However, the party failed to win any seats in Parliament.

On 15 June 2022, First Minister Nicola Sturgeon declared that she planned to hold a second Scottish independence referendum in October 2023. Her decision was unanimously struck down as null and void by the Supreme Court of the United Kingdom on 23 November 2022.

== Ultranationalism and paramilitary groups ==

The Scottish National Liberation Army, a paramilitary group also known as the Tartan Terrorists was formed by Adam Busby after the 1979 Scottish devolution referendum. The SNLA claimed responsibility for many letter bomb deliveries to public figures such as Margaret Thatcher and Diana, Princess of Wales, along with a string of arson attacks during the 1980s, including a firebomb attack at the Conservative party headquarters located in Glasgow, in addition to larger scale attacks at targets such as the British Ministry of Defence Headquarters and a British Airways office in London. The organisation is still is believed to exist in present day Scotland, however there have been no further reports of any activity carried out by the group since 2009, when it was reported that Adam Busby Jr., the son of the organisation founder, was sentenced to six years in jail for sending packages containing shotgun cartridges accompanied by notes bearing threats of violence to various political figures, such as then-First Minister Alex Salmond, Liberal Democrat MSP Mike Rumbles and Glasgow City Council.

Siol nan Gaidheal, an ultranationalist group was founded by Tom Moore in 1978 which bases membership of the nation on blood descent or heredity, often articulated in terms of common blood or kinship such as the traditional Scottish clan system rather than on political, or civil membership.

Arm nan Gaidheal was a short lived paramilitary wing of SNG, which was responsible for various petrol bomb attacks in the early 1980s after a failed referendum on Scottish devolution. Currently, Siol nan Gaidheal is remains a banned group in Scotland under the Scottish National Party.

Frederick Boothby led and created the Army of the Provisional Government, otherwise known as the Tartan Army, who were responsible for a series of bombings in 1975 and a failed attempted bank robbery where Boothby was apprehended.

== Popular culture ==
=== Poetry ===
* In 1375, Scottish makar, or court poet, John Barbour completed the epic poem &quot;The Brus&quot;, which retells and celebrates the deeds of Robert the Bruce, who led the Scottish people in their Wars of Independence against Kings Edward I and Edward II of England and who ultimately became King of Scotland.
* Around 1488, Scottish makar Blind Harry wrote the epic poem &quot;The Wallace&quot;, about the life and death of Scottish nationalist leader William Wallace.
* Alasdair mac Mhaighstir Alasdair (), a Jacobite war poet and major figure in Scottish Gaelic literature, has also been having a growing influence upon both Scottish nationalism and republicanism. Despite his own personal monarchism and passionate loyalty to the House of Stuart, Alasdair&#x27;s many poetic denunciations and satires against the House of Hanover, the ancestors of the modern British royal family, have been admired, praised, and translated by poets and writers who favour Scottish independence.
* The events of the Scottish Wars of Independence are also a regular theme in the verse of Scotland&#x27;s national poet, Robert Burns.
* Hugh MacDiarmid (1892 - 1978) was a Scottish poet, considered one of the principal forces behind the Scottish Renaissance, he had a great influence on Scottish culture and politics.

=== Film ===
* &quot;Braveheart&quot; is a historical war film that dramatizes the life of William Wallace during the First War of Scottish Independence. Mel Gibson portrayed Wallace onscreen, as well as directing the film. Screenwriter Randall Wallace had largely based the screenplay upon the poem &quot;The Wallace&quot; by Blind Harry. Although the film caused a rise in Scottish nationalism, with Lin Anderson, author of &quot;Braveheart: From Hollywood To Holyrood&quot;, claiming the film helped Scotland get its first devolved parliament since 1707, the film has been criticized for its historical inaccuracy, but its alleged inaccuracies have entered into popular culture itself. 
* What was intended to be a more accurate film about the Wars of Scottish Independence was written and directed by David Mackenzie and titled &quot;Outlaw King&quot;. &quot;Outlaw King&quot; has faced its own critics for inaccuracy. A notable example is how Robert the Bruce (Chris Pine) is portrayed as an enigmatic and well-behaved man of the people who desires to restore Scotland to the Scottish people. However, historian Fiona Watson notes the real King Robert I was most likely cold, canny, machiavellian, and driven by his personal ambition. Edward, Prince of Wales (Billy Howle), Bruce&#x27;s main enemy, was also depicted as a cruel and sadistic person who is eager to succeed his father, King Edward Longshanks (Stephen Dillane). In reality, Prince Edward was reluctant to assume the kingship and was known to be generous with his servants.

<text>Joseph Paul Gaimard (31 January 1793 – 10 December 1858) was a French naval surgeon and naturalist.

== Biography ==
Gaimard was born at Saint-Zacharie on January 31, 1793. He studied medicine at the naval medical school in Toulon, subsequently earning his qualifications as a naval surgeon. Along with Jean René Constant Quoy, he served as naturalist on the ships &quot;L&#x27;Uranie&quot; under Louis de Freycinet 1817–1820, and &quot;L&#x27;Astrolabe&quot; under Jules Dumont d&#x27;Urville 1826–1829. During this voyage they discovered the now extinct giant skink of Tonga, &quot;Tachygia microlepis&quot;.

From his studies of cholera in Europe, he co-authored &quot;Du choléra-morbus en Russie, en Prusse et en Autriche, pendant les années 1831-1832&quot; (Cholera morbus in Russia, Prussia and Austria in the years 1831 and 1832).
He was the scientific leader on &quot;La Recherche&quot; (1835–1836) during its expedition to the Arctic Sea, making voyages to coastal Iceland and Greenland — from 27 April to 13 September 1835 and from 21 May to 26 September 1836. Along with exploratory and scientific goals, the crew of the expedition was asked to search for French explorer Jules de Blosseville, who had disappeared aboard the &quot;Lilloise&quot; in Arctic waters a few years earlier. Out of these trips came the 9-volume &quot;Voyage en Islande et au Groënland&quot; (8 text volumes, one of geographical illustrations), which was said at the time to be the definitive study of the islands.

From 1838 to 1840, again aboard &quot;La Recherche&quot;, Gaimard was the leader of a scientific expedition to Lapland, Spitzbergen, and the Faroe Islands.

==Eponyms==
Numerous species have been named in his honor; including the following:
*&quot;Bettongia gaimardi&quot; – eastern bettong 
*&quot;Byblis gaimardi&quot; 
*&quot;Eualus gaimardii&quot; 
*&quot;Lophurella gaimardii&quot; – a marine alga
*&quot;Poikilocarbo gaimardi&quot;, – red-legged cormorant
*&quot;Stenophis gaimardi&quot; – a colubrid snake

== Writings ==
His scientific publications include a major work on the results of each of these four great expeditions.
*&quot;Voyage autour du monde … pendant les années 1817, 1818, 1819 et 1820&quot; (with Louis Claude Desaulses de Freycinet, Jean René Constant Quoy, et al.), 1824.
*&quot;Voyage de la corvette l&#x27;Astrolabe exécuté par ordre du Roi, pendant les années 1826-1827-1828-1829 sous le commandement de M. J. Dumont d&#x27;Urville&quot;, (with Jules-Sébastien-César Dumont d&#x27;Urville, J Tastu, Jean René Constant Quoy), 1829–1835.

<text>Jean René Constant Quoy (10 November 1790 in Maillé – 4 July 1869 in Rochefort) was a French naval surgeon, zoologist and anatomist.

In 1806, he began his medical studies at the school of naval medicine at Rochefort, afterwards serving as an auxiliary-surgeon on a trip to the Antilles (1808–1809). After earning his medical doctorate in 1814 at Montpellier, he was surgeon-major on a journey to Réunion (1814–1815).

Along with Joseph Paul Gaimard, he served as naturalist and surgeon aboard the &quot;Uranie&quot; under Louis de Freycinet from 1817 to 1820, and on the &quot;Astrolabe&quot; (1826–1829) under the command of Jules Dumont d&#x27;Urville. In July 1823 he and Gaimard presented a paper to the Académie royale des Sciences on the origin of coral reefs, taking issue with the then widespread belief that these were constructed by coral polyps from bases in very deep water and arguing instead that the original bases must have been in shallow water because reef-building polyps were confined to water depths of just a few tens of metres. Their work was quoted by Charles Darwin in his seminal monograph on the origin on reefs and atolls. While on the &quot;Astrolabe&quot; expedition Quoy and Gaimard collected and described &quot;Tachygia microlepis&quot;, the now extinct giant skink of Tonga.

Along with his skills as a naturalist, Quoy was acclaimed for his work as an artist.

In 1824, he was appointed professor of anatomy at the Rochefort Naval School, where from 1832 to 1835, he was a professor of medicine. He then continued his career at naval hospitals in Toulon (1835–1837) and in Brest (1838–1848), afterwards being chosen inspector general of the Naval Bureau of Medicine and Surgery (serving from 1848 to 1858).

==Taxonomy==
The following genera or species were named in his honor:
*&quot;Cracticus quoyi&quot; – the black butcherbird
*&quot;Quoya&quot; – a genus of sea slugs
*&quot;Quoyia&quot; – a genus of extinct marine gastropods
*&quot;Terebra quoygaimardi&quot; – a species of sea snail
*&quot;Pilumnus quoyi&quot; – a species of crab
*&quot;Ischnochiton quoyanus&quot; – a species of chiton
*&quot;Eulamprus quoyii&quot; – a species of skink
*&quot;Quoya&quot; – a genus of Australian plants

<text>In the history of Mexico, the Plan of Casa Mata () was a plan formulated to elect a new constituent congress, which the monarchy of Agustín de Iturbide had dissolved in 1822. The Plan of Casa Mata sought to establish a republic.

In December 1822, Antonio López de Santa Anna and Guadalupe Victoria signed the on February 1, 1823, as a beginning to their efforts to overthrow Emperor of Mexico Agustín de Iturbide. Iturbide had formulated the Plan of Iguala in 1821, which united insurgents and royalist forces and Mexico&#x27;s independence in September 1821. The plan called for a constitutional monarchy, and when no European monarch presented himself as a candidate, the Mexican Congress proclaimed Iturbide as Emperor of Mexico in May 1822. Commanding the country as he had commanded the army, he dissolved the Congress and ordered dissidents imprisoned.

Several insurrections arose in the provinces and were choked by the army, except for the one headed by Santa Anna in Veracruz, because he had an agreement with General Echávarri, who commanded the imperial forces that fought Santa Anna. By agreement of the two the was proclaimed on February 1, 1823. This plan did not recognize the First Mexican Empire and called for a new Constituent Congress. The insurrectionists sent their proposal to the provincial delegations and requested their support for the plan. In the course of only six weeks, the had arrived at remote places, like Texas, and almost all the provinces had been united behind the plan.

When a provincial delegation accepted the , it withdrew its allegiance from the imperial government and asserted sovereignty within its province. Agustín de Iturbide was isolated without support outside of Mexico City and some factions of the army. He reinstated the dissolved constituent Congress, abdicated the crown, and left the country in March 1823, for Italian exile with the promise of a 25,000 peso annual payment if he remained there. The 1824 Constitution was adopted the following year.

<text>Marvel Two-in-One is an American comic book series published by Marvel Comics featuring Fantastic Four member the Thing in a different team-up each issue.

==Publication history==
===Original series===
The concept of teaming the Thing with a different character in each issue was given a test run in &quot;Marvel Feature&quot; #11-12 and proved a success. &quot;Marvel Two-in-One&quot; continued from the team-up stories in the final two issues of &quot;Marvel Feature&quot; and lasted for 100 issues from January 1974 through June 1983. Seven &quot;Annual&quot;s were also published. Artist Ron Wilson began his long association with the title with issue #12 (November 1975) and worked on it throughout its run. With issue #17, the series had a crossover with &quot;Marvel Team-Up&quot; #47, which featured Spider-Man. The second &quot;Marvel Two-in-One Annual&quot; was a crossover with &quot;Avengers Annual&quot; #7, both of which were written and drawn by Jim Starlin. The &quot;Project Pegasus&quot; storyline in &quot;Marvel Two-in-One&quot; #53-58 saw the introduction of the name &quot;Quasar&quot; for the Wendell Vaughn character and the transformation of Wundarr into the Aquarian.

Due to a binding error, three copies of issue 74 were released with the cover of DC&#x27;s &quot;The New Teen Titans&quot; issue #6 in April 1981.

Comics creators who contributed to the series include Steve Gerber, Jack Kirby (who did pencils on several covers during its run), Marv Wolfman, John Buscema, John Byrne, Frank Miller, and George Pérez.

&quot;Marvel Two-In-One&quot; ended after 100 issues and seven &quot;Annual&quot;s. It was immediately replaced by a &quot;Thing&quot; solo series.

===Revival===
As part of &quot;Marvel Legacy&quot;, a soft relaunch of the Marvel Universe, &quot;Marvel Two-In-One&quot; (stylized as &quot;Marvel 2-in-One&quot;) was revived in December 2017 with a new story titled &quot;The Fate of the Four&quot; that revolves around the Thing and the Human Torch going on a road trip to investigate the disappearance of Reed Richards, Sue Storm, Franklin, and Valeria Richards. The series was written by Chip Zdarsky and ran for 12 issues and one &quot;Annual&quot;. The series was penciled by Jim Cheung (issues #1, 2, and 6), Valerio Schiti (issues #3–5), Ramon K. Perez (issues #7–12), and Declan Shalvey (&quot;Annual&quot; #1).

<text>Judgment Night is a 1993 American action film directed by Stephen Hopkins. Emilio Estevez, Cuba Gooding Jr., Jeremy Piven and Stephen Dorff star as a group of friends on the run from a gang of drug dealers (led by Denis Leary) after they witness a murder.

==Plot==
Frank Wyatt, his younger brother John and their friends, Mike Peterson and Ray Cochran meet up in their suburban neighborhood to take a road trip in Ray&#x27;s luxurious RV to watch a professional boxing match in Chicago for the night.

With the freeway gridlocked, Ray exits the expressway and cuts through an extremely run-down and destitute residential neighborhood. The four friends are alarmed when they accidentally hit a man named Teddy.

A long argument ensues regarding contacting the police, which Ray, who had been driving the RV when it hit Teddy, does not want to happen due to the fact the friends had been drinking during their journey. Frank makes the decision to exit the RV to help the victim.

Inspecting Teddy, they find that he has been shot and has a paper bag filled with money. The injured young man is brought into the RV so the friends can get him to a hospital.

The RV is sideswiped by a car, leaving it lodged in a narrow alleyway. Three dangerous men — Sykes, Rhodes and Travis — force their way into the window at the back of the RV and drag Teddy outside. Fallon, a local crime lord, arrives and executes Teddy for stealing the money, the execution witnessed by Frank and his brother and friends. Fallon then sets his sights to kill the four witnesses.

The friends are chased by Fallon&#x27;s men into a rail yard. They hide in an old streetcar in which several homeless people are sheltering. They blackmail the four men into handing over their valuables but are heard by the pursuing gang members. The four friends and homeless people from multiple train cars flee. Fallon shoots and kills one of the homeless people, mistaking them for his quarry.

Taking refuge in an apartment building, the four friends convince a resident to call the police but Fallon and his men arrive at the complex, going door to door terrorizing the occupants to hand over the four friends if they were inside.

The resident demands the four friends to leave immediately as their presence in her home is putting her and her baby as well as her roommates lives in grave danger. The roommate takes some pity and tells the four friends that there is an escape route to another building via the roof.

The friends use a ladder to cross over an alley onto the other rooftop but are pursued by Fallon and his men. Ray stays behind and tries to bribe the drug gang into letting them go. Fallon, disgusted by Ray&#x27;s tactics and privileged upbringing, throws Ray from the roof, killing him.
The trio are chased into the sewers by Fallon and his henchmen. Mike shoots and kills Sykes, allowing them to escape. Discovering Sykes&#x27; body, a comment made by Travis annoys Fallon and he drowns Travis in a fit of rage.

The trio then break into a swap meet, hoping to summon the police by setting off the building&#x27;s alarm and are arrested by two security guards. Fallon and Rhodes arrive and kill the guards as the trio hide in the store. Rhodes and Mike engage in a shootout that kills Rhodes but leaves Mike wounded. John retrieves Mike, but Fallon shoots John in the leg. The three friends make their way to a bathroom where Frank tends to their wounds. Frank leaves to try to get help but spots Fallon, who is about to discover John and Mike.

Frank shouts out, causing Fallon to search for him. A fight ensues where Frank ultimately overpowers Fallon and throws him off a ledge to his death.

Police and paramedics arrive, taking Mike and John to a hospital where they are expected to survive their wounds. Frank then exits the building to his waiting wife.

==Production==
=== Development ===
The project had been in the works for several years when screenwriter Kevin Jarre had written the first spec script for the movie (under its original title, &quot;Escape&quot;) sometime around 1989 or earlier, which was based on a story idea by Richard DiLello and producer Lawrence Gordon, who produced films like &quot;Predator&quot; (1987) and &quot;Die Hard&quot; (1988), bought it in January 1990, as one of a few film projects for his production company, Largo Entertainment.

At the 25th anniversary screening of the film during Cinepocalypse film festival in Chicago, director Stephen Hopkins said that Jarre&#x27;s script, which was a lot darker and more violent, was one of several scripts commissioned by the producers, with many different writers, including John Carpenter, William Wisher, Randall Wallace, and Christopher Crowe all writing a draft, some of the different script versions involved bikers in the desert outside L.A. and rooftop motorcycle chases, in the same interview at Cinepocalypse, Hopkins further stated: &quot;I was given a lot of scripts, and it was quite a long process, we wanted to work hard to get it right&quot;.

The final script would be written by Lewis Colick, based on a story Colick had co-written with novelist Jere Cunningham. The script would undergo more work when screenwriter Larry Ferguson was hired to do rewrites on the script.

=== Casting ===
According to Hopkins, he wanted John Travolta in the lead role and Kevin Spacey in the main villain role; other actors, including Ray Liotta, Tom Cruise, Samuel L. Jackson, and Christian Slater, were either offered or had turned down roles in the film.

Comedian Adam Carolla was a stand-in for one of the &quot;bad guy&quot; actors, Michael Wiseman. He was friends with the assistant director. It was his first foray into film.

=== Filming ===
Filming took place in Chicago, Illinois, primarily at night, in the Cabrini-Green neighborhood. According to Hopkins, the studio was so taken aback by the bleak tone of the dailies that they thought the crew were using a matte painting.

Hopkins further mentioned that when they were filming the scene where Ray (Jeremy Piven) is confronted by Fallon (Denis Leary), a shooting had occurred near the set, and as a result the Army came in and temporarily shut production down.

==Reception==
===Box office===
The movie debuted at No. 5. The film grossed a total of $12,136,938 at the US box office.

===Critical response===
On Rotten Tomatoes, the film has an approval rating of 38% based on 21 reviews and an average rating of 4.2/10. On Metacritic it has a score of 46% based on reviews from 11 reviews, indicating &quot;mixed or average reviews&quot;. Audiences polled by CinemaScore gave the film an average grade of &quot;B&quot; on an A+ to F scale.

Leonard Klady of &quot;Variety&quot; wrote, &quot;The most chilling aspect of the urban thriller &quot;Judgment Night&quot; is how infinitely superior its craft is to its art. This is an exceedingly well directed, cleverly filmed and edited, tension-filled affair. It is also a wholly preposterous, muddled, paranoid&#x27;s view of the inner-city nightmare where the slightest misstep is sure to have a fateful result.&quot; Richard Harrington of &quot;The Washington Post&quot; felt the movie was &quot;regrettably familiar fare&quot; and said, &quot;The filmmakers have made a big deal of a soundtrack that features 11 collaborations between rappers and rockers (...), but their casting consciousness is less adventurous.&quot;

==Soundtrack and score==
A soundtrack for the film, titled &quot;Judgment Night: Music from the Motion Picture&quot; (featuring rock and rap collaborations), was released the same year. The score for the film, composed and conducted by Alan Silvestri, is fully orchestral. Silvestri previously collaborated with Hopkins on &quot;Predator 2&quot;.

In 2005, Intrada released a complete version of Silvestri&#x27;s orchestral score, containing two rejected tracks that he composed with electronic synthesized elements.

<text>Space are a band from Liverpool, England, who formed in 1992 initially as a trio of Tommy Scott (vocals, bass, guitar), Jamie Murphy (vocals, guitar) and Jamie Island (drums), who was later replaced by Andy Parle in 1993. Keyboard player Franny Griffiths joined the line-up a year later, and the band signed to Gut Records in 1995, eventually rising to prominence with hit singles such as &quot;Female of the Species&quot;, &quot;Me and You Versus the World&quot;, &quot;Neighbourhood&quot;, &quot;Avenging Angels&quot; and &quot;The Ballad of Tom Jones&quot;, the latter a duet with Cerys Matthews of Catatonia.

Space pursued an eclectic sound dubbed &quot;queasy listening&quot; by critics, embracing electronica and sampling in their work and drawing from genres as diverse as hip hop, techno, post-punk, ska, lounge music, easy listening and film scores, the result of the difference in tastes between band members. The group were also noted for their deliberately tongue-in-cheek, dark-humoured lyrics inspired by films, which frequently deal with topics such as serial killers, failed relationships, social outcasts, and mental illness. Whilst Space&#x27;s eclecticism and camp humour polarised listeners and critics, they have maintained a devoted cult following.

Space experienced several lineup changes, with Scott being the only consistent member. Their first two albums, &quot;Spiders&quot; (1996) and &quot;Tin Planet&quot; (1998), achieved great success and went platinum in the UK, along with scoring eight UK Top 40 singles. Work on their proposed third album, &quot;Love You More than Football&quot;, was marred by difficulties, and it was eventually shelved once the band were released from their contract with Gut. The band disbanded in 2005, following low sales and a lukewarm reception of their fourth album &quot;Suburban Rock &#x27;n&#x27; Roll&quot; (2004), which was nonetheless acclaimed by fans.

Scott went on to form The Drellas, which in 2011 morphed into the second incarnation of Space after Griffiths (and briefly Murphy) joined the group. Space have continued to perform live and release studio albums, including &quot;Attack of the Mutant 50ft Kebab&quot; (2014) and &quot;Give Me Your Future&quot; (2017). In 2019, twenty years after it was recorded, &quot;Love You More than Football&quot; was officially released as part of a career-spanning &quot;Anthology&quot; boxset. The band&#x27;s seventh album, &quot;Music for Pleasure Music for Pain&quot;, was released in 2021.

==Biography==
Tommy Scott and Jamie Murphy first met when Murphy was hired as a roadie for Scott&#x27;s then band The Australians. After The Australians split in 1992, the pair started a new band called The Substitutes (after the song by The Who), with Murphy playing guitar and Scott filling the role of bassist. Murphy would rename the band Space after the working title for the song &quot;My Own Dream&quot; by The Real People, and performed their first gig under the name on 15 May 1992 at The Picket in Liverpool. Jamie Island was briefly the band&#x27;s drummer before being replaced by Andy Parle, and on 5 July 1993 they released a 12-inch single entitled &quot;If Its Real&quot;.

In 1994, Franny Griffiths, who had previously played with Scott in Hello Sunset and The Australians, was brought in to join them on keyboards and electronics, and would eventually establish their distinct style. On 15 January 1995, the band secured a recording contract with Gut Records, who released their first single, &quot;Money&quot;, in November that year. The single &quot;Neighbourhood&quot;&#x27; followed in March 1996, but it was not until the release of their next single, &quot;Female of the Species&quot;, that they achieved top 40 success. This song was also the theme song to the UK programme &quot;Cold Feet&quot;.

Their debut album &quot;Spiders&quot;, released in September 1996, enjoyed success and went platinum in the UK. &quot;Female of the Species&quot; also gained moderate airplay on college radio and MTV in the United States, and was widely seen and heard in Australia on the nationally broadcast ABC-TV music video show &quot;rage&quot; and on the ABC national rock station Triple-J. The line-up increased with the addition of bassist/multi-instrumentalist Yorkie – who started working with the band years before their success with &quot;Spiders&quot; – in late 1996, so that Scott could concentrate more on vocals and guitar.

A tour of the US followed in mid-1997, during which bandmembers suffered from homesickness, Murphy experienced a nervous breakdown, and Scott lost his voice for two months. The death of Palmer&#x27;s mother devastated the band, and Parle left the group straight after the second album was complete. He was replaced by Leon Caffrey.

The new record, entitled &quot;Tin Planet&quot;, was a more mature, focused release than &quot;Spiders&quot; and was issued in spring 1998, hitting number three in the UK Albums Chart. Like its predecessor, it became a success, but it did upset some fans due to its more softer, pop-friendly songs and the lack of the much more aggressive tracks found on &quot;Spiders&quot;. In late 1998, for a Honda advertisement, Space recorded a version of The Animals&#x27; &quot;We Gotta Get out of This Place&quot;, which was featured on &quot;The Bad Days EP&quot;. The band also recorded a track together with singer Tom Jones for his album &quot;Reload&quot;, released in 1999.

In 2001, Space parted ways with Gut following certain issues with the label, including the constant postponing of their third album &quot;Love You More than Football&quot;. Murphy departed from the band the same year, leading to the band retreating from the public eye and release their music to their fans via their website. These recordings were known as &quot;Music for Aliens&quot;.

After a three-year break from public attention, Space returned in 2004 to release &quot;Suburban Rock &#x27;n&#x27; Roll&quot;, their first proper release of new material since &quot;Tin Planet&quot;. It failed to earn critical and commercial recognition. The lukewarm reception of the releases and the problems with getting a recording contract, made it financially impossible to carry on. In 2005, Space announced their decision to go their separate ways.

Since the band&#x27;s original break-up, most of the former members have continued to play in bands and music industry: Scott, along with Phil Hartley, a former live technician for the group, formed a punk band called the Drellas, which in its final incarnation included Allan Jones on drums and Ryan Clarke on vintage keys. Hartley, who plays bass, also produces for the band, along with other Antipop Records acts such as Metro Manila Aide, The Dead Class, The Temps and Fraktures. Franny Griffiths was with Murphy and Vinnie Camilleri (who played guitar for The Beatles Pre- Ringo drummer Pete Best) with their band Dust, and also making R&amp;B under the name Subway Showdown, while Yorkie is producing for Shack. Franny also co-writes &amp; produces with Vinnie Camilleri for Spaceman V Man.

Andy Parle died on 1 August 2009, aged 42, in Liverpool. Police said they were treating Parle&#x27;s death as &quot;unexplained&quot; after he was seen to fall while crossing the road. Eyewitnesses described him tripping and falling after trying to run across a road in Liverpool at around 11.30 pm. He was taken to Royal Liverpool Hospital where he died. Palmer stated that he was a &quot;brilliant drummer&quot; and that his death was &quot;the saddest, most tragic end you could have.&quot;

In November 2011, Space announced they would reunite for a gig at Christmas at the O2 Academy in Liverpool. The line-up reunited original members Scott, Murphy and Griffiths, and included other musicians who had played with Scott in The Red Scare. They band announced the release of a new album, entitled &quot;Attack of the Mutant 50ft Kebab&quot;, and a world tour in 2012. After two years in the making (which were disrupted by Murphy&#x27;s second departure), the album was eventually released in March 2014, preceded by the lead single &quot;Fortune Teller&quot;. In July, keyboardist Ryan Clarke left the group to focus on other projects. As part of their 20th anniversary, Space announced a tour throughout March 2014 alongside Republica.
In November 2015, Space released the single &quot;Strange World&quot; as a stopgap between albums. In 2016, the band announced that they were working on a new album entitled &quot;Give Me Your Future&quot;, recorded with Steve Levine.

In November 2019, a box set entitled &quot;The Anthology&quot; was released, containing the band&#x27;s first five studio albums, including the previously unreleased &quot;Love You More than Football&quot; album, plus B-sides and rarities.

On 27 August 2021, Space released &quot;Hell No&quot;, the first single from their seventh album &quot;Music for Pleasure Music for Pain&quot; which was first made available during a meet and greet at Wax &amp; Beans Records on 23 October 2021, with general distribution set for 12 December 2022. In September 2022, the band announced a 25th anniversary tour for &quot;Spiders&quot; and &quot;Tin Planet&quot; in 2023, playing both albums in their entirety, and that Murphy would rejoin them for those shows.

In April 2024, Space announced an autumn tour in support of their upcoming eighth studio album, &quot;Blood and Bubblegum&quot;. An updated version of &quot;The Anthology&quot; boxset, adding &quot;Give Me Your Future&quot; and &quot;Music for Pleasure Music for Pain&quot;, is set for release November 22, 2024.

==Musical style==

Space&#x27;s sound is noted for its highly eclectic and cinematic nature, which, according to &quot;Scouse Pop&quot; author Paul Skillen, &quot;challenges convention in an industry that likes to categorize artists into marketable genres&quot;. Their embrace of synthesizers and state-of-the-art recording techniques such as looping, sampling, and beats derived from hip hop and dance music helped them stand out from other Liverpool bands of the time, who tended towards more &#x27;traditional&#x27; and &#x27;authentic&#x27; 1960s-inspired guitar pop. 

This also enabled them to sidestep the &#x27;retro-gazing&#x27; characteristic of the Britpop movement, which they were frequently associated with. Journalist Jennifer Blake wrote that &quot;Space are from Liverpool, but any attempts to cast the band under the somewhat meaningless title of &#x27;Britpop&#x27; should be quickly dismissed. Other than the fact that the members of Space are British and make superb pop music, they have little in common with bands like Blur and Oasis. In fact, they have little in common with any other band. Their quirky originality is what makes them so much fun to watch, leaving the audience not sure what to expect.&quot;

Space&#x27;s lyrics cover a broad range of subjects, frequently referencing celebrities and fictional characters, as well as a recurring interest in science fiction and horror films, which is often reflected in their music videos, live shows, and record sleeves. In an interview with Stuart Maconie, frontman Tommy Scott stated the motivation for his songwriting is inspired more by movies and television rather than other musicians: &quot;I&#x27;m into films and telly. The songs I write depends on what film I&#x27;m into at the time. Some days I&#x27;m Noël Coward, some days I think I&#x27;m Quentin Tarantino, some days it&#x27;s Speedy Gonzales&quot; Scott has described Space&#x27;s approach to creating music as a democratic process: 

Scott claimed it was never the band&#x27;s intent to write &quot;odd music&quot; and that they &quot;just didn&#x27;t want to be like every other band. We went into a practice room with a song; we then recorded it and released it. We didn&#x27;t know what would happen after that. There was no plan; it was just natural. If Space had been contrived, it would have been rubbish.&quot; He also stated that, due to the tongue-in-cheek, campy nature of their lyrics, he would get defensive whenever critics would dismiss them as &quot;quirky&quot; or as a novelty act:

<text>Hopetown is a town which lies at the edge of the Great Karoo in South Africa&#x27;s Northern Cape province. It is situated on an arid slope leading down to the Orange River. The first diamond discovered in South Africa, the Eureka Diamond, was found at Hopetown.

==History==

Hopetown was founded in 1850 when Sir Harry Smith extended the northern frontier of the Cape Colony to the Orange River. A handful of settlers claimed ground where there was a natural ford over the Orange River, and by 1854 a frontier town had developed. Hopetown was named after William Hope, Auditor-General and Secretary of the Cape Colony Government at the time, and is often mistaken for a town in the Free State, South Africa, called Hoopstad.

Hopetown was a quiet farming area until several large diamonds, most notable the Eureka Diamond and the Star of South Africa, were discovered there between 1867 and 1869.
The Cape Government Railways were founded in 1872, and the Cape government decided to run the main western line, between the Kimberley diamond fields and Cape Town on the coast, directly through Hopetown. The ford was upgraded to a railway bridge in 1884.

<doc id="818329" wikidata="Q1104012" url="?curid=818329" title="Co-counselling">
<text>Co-counselling (spelled co-counseling in American English) is a grassroots method of personal change based on reciprocal peer counselling. It uses simple methods. Time is shared equally and the essential requirement of the person taking their turn in the role of counsellor is to do their best to listen and give their full attention to the other person. It is not a discussion; the aim is to support the person in the client role to work through their own issues in a mainly self-directed way.

Co-counselling was originally formulated in the early 1950s by the American Harvey Jackins and originated in a schism in the Dianetics movement (itself in part derived from schisms in general semantics and cybernetics). Jackins founded the Re-evaluation Counseling (RC) Communities, with headquarters in Seattle, Washington, United States. His son, Tim Jackins, is currently the international leader of Re-evaluation Counseling and its main affiliates. Like other offshoots of Dianetics such as Scientology and the Landmark Forum, Re-evaluation Counseling has features of a cult and an authoritarian leadership structure that actively suppresses dissent and critique.

There are a number of smaller, separate, independent organizations that have resulted from breakaways from, or re-workings of, Re-evaluation Counseling. The principal one of these is Co-Counseling International (CCI).

==General description==
The main activity in co-counselling involves participants arranging to meet regularly in pairs to give each other peer-to-peer counselling, in turn taking the role of counsellor and client, with equal amounts of time allocated to each. Co-counselling functions by giving people an opportunity to work on whatever issues they choose with the accepting support of another person. The person in the role of counsellor acts as a facilitator to the client, sometimes as a third-party observer and sometimes as a second-party confidant. While co-counselling is sometimes practiced outside a formal organisation, formal co-counselling organisations have developed leadership and support structures, including trainings and retreats.

Safety (in the sense of being very low risk) and the sense that a co-counselling session is a safe space is important to the methods. There are strict rules of confidentiality. In most circumstances, the counsellor may not talk about a client&#x27;s session without explicit and specific permission by the client. This is stricter than in other practices where practitioners discuss clients with supervisors, colleagues and sometimes with all sorts of other people. The peer relationship makes a considerable contribution to a sense of trust.

The nature of the co-counselling session opens up the possibility for people to get in touch with emotions that they would avoid in any other circumstance. A belief in the value of working with emotions has become a core focus of the approach. Co-counselling training emphasizes methods for accessing and working with emotions, and co-counsellors aim to develop and improve emotional competence through the practice. Evidence as to the actual effectiveness of this method is undemonstrated.

To get involved in co-counselling, it is usually first necessary to complete a Fundamentals course. The training involves learning how to carry out the roles of client and counsellor. Trainers may be counsellors or simply experienced members of the community. It also covers the guidelines or rules affecting co-counselling for the particular organization. Differences in approach mean that each organization normally requires completion of one of its own courses as a prerequisite for membership, even if someone has already completed a course with another organization.

==Theoretical framework and assumptions==
The original theory of co-counselling centres on the concept of distress patterns. These are patterns of behaviour, that is, behaviour that tends to be repeated in a particular type of circumstance, that are irrational, unhelpful or compulsive. The theory is that these patterns are driven by the accumulated consequences in the mind of (not currently) conscious memories of past events in which the person was unable to express or discharge the emotion appropriate to the event. Co-counselling enables release from the patterns by allowing &quot;emotional discharge&quot; of the past hurt experiences. Such cathartic discharge includes crying, warm perspiration, trembling, yawning, laughing and relaxed, non-repetitive talking. In day-to-day life, these &quot;discharging&quot; actions may be limited by social norms, such as, for example, taboos around crying, which are widespread in many cultures.

Having temporary, undivided, supportive attention from another person often gives rise to strong feelings towards that person; your counsellor often becomes your best friend for life. Sometimes people &quot;fall in love&quot; with each other. This is similar to the phenomenon of transference, particularly when one of the partners is felt to have more authority because, for instance, they are more experienced, are teachers of co-counselling, or have authority roles within the organisation. The organisations differ in the ways that they handle this. The inability to trust and feel in real relationships is sometimes exacerbated by the intimacy of co-counselling relationship, making transference a possibility. But participants are strongly encouraged and supported to counsel through these feelings, often leading to profound changes in their perspectives and abilities around closeness. For the most part, co-counselling relationships become life-long, therapeutic partnerships that enable the participant to have healthier relationships in general.

==Therapeutic context==
Many co-counsellors take the view, often quite strongly, that co-counselling is not psychotherapy. In the beginning, this was because Re-evaluation Counseling decided not to draw on any discipline of psychotherapy for its theory and practice, although RC did incorporate some ideas from psycho-analysis such as &quot;unconscious promptings&quot; which Jackins adapted and relabeled &quot;restimulation&quot;. A similar view is taken by some non-RC co-counsellors who regard psychotherapy as involving specialist techniques used by a therapist on a client and is therefore not peer and the client has little or no control over the process.

Others consider that co-counselling is psychotherapeutic, in that it enables change or therapy to take place in the psyche, soul affect or being of an individual. Co-counselling takes a positive view of the person (i.e. we are all essentially good), considers the mind and body as an integrated whole and acknowledges the value of catharsis; it is regarded as an approach within humanistic psychology, a view that would be rejected by some within RC.

==Re-evaluation Counseling==
The core organization structure of RC consists of classes and local communities set up by experienced co-counsellors, which are in turn organized by regions and country.

The term &quot;re-evaluation&quot; refers to the client&#x27;s need to rethink their past distress experiences after the emotional hurt in those experiences have been discharged, and thereby regain (&quot;re-emerge&quot; with) their natural intellectual and emotional capacities. The RC organization and literature do not accept the description of its practice as psychotherapy, maintaining instead that the process of developing distress patterns that dissolve through emotional discharge in the context of appreciative attention is simply a natural process that does not imply either psychopathology on the part of the individual or the need for professional treatment. Re-evaluation Counseling regards other forms of &quot;mainstream counselling&quot; and psychotherapy in general as frequently inadequate attempts to bring about relief from distress using methods that do not focus on discharge and re-emergence.

In RC, the client and counsellor are expected to work co-operatively, participants are expected to provide non-judgmental active listening and to &quot;contradict&quot; the misinformation or other conditions thought to be associated with distress patterns. RC also engages techniques such as &quot;non-permissive&quot; counselling, in which the counsellor intervenes to &quot;interrupt&quot; client patterns without the consent of the client. The structure of RC is one of clearly defined leadership, to encourage clarity in the difficult struggles many people have to achieve breakthroughs against their distresses. RC encourages counsellors to think very hard about all possible ways to assist the client in discharging.

RC approaches the issue of feelings between co-counsellors by having a strict &quot;no-socialising&quot; rule. RC co-counsellors are expected not to socialise or have social or sexual relationships with other co-counsellors unless these relationships pre-dated their becoming co-counsellors. RC specifically rejects the label &quot;transference&quot; for this phenomenon, as this is seen as part of a &quot;symptomatic&quot; method typical in psychology; the original theory of co-counselling (from RC) teaches that the best thing to do in these circumstances is repeatedly counsel on, and &quot;discharge&quot; about, such feelings. In addition, methods of &quot;getting attention out of distress&quot; are available which help with the difficulty of &quot;switching roles&quot; between counsellor and client. When taught correctly, counsellors are soon able to grasp the difference between counselling relationships and those from outside life. However, sometimes there is a marked pull to &quot;socialise&quot; or confuse the boundaries of the co-counselling relationship with other types of relationships. This is one reason why many consider a well-organised community of co-counsellors with clear rules to be essential in the successful practise of co-counselling.

Re-evaluation Counseling places a high importance on the need to understand and adhere to a comprehensive theory about the nature of the universe and of human beings (known in general as the &quot;Benign Reality&quot;), the best ways of assisting the discharge process and of pro-liberation attitudes in co-counselling. RCers believe that, when taken together, these enable the counsellor to keep a clear picture of the client&#x27;s &quot;re-emergence&quot; and are therefore very effective. People disagreeing with the theoretical perspective are asked to think and discharge on the points at issue before actively challenging such perspectives. The main aim is to provide a safe, stable and supportive atmosphere within which people can client skillfully and also lead &quot;re-emergent lives&quot; where they are not dependent in a therapeutic sense, but instead become more energetic and effective (a state known as &quot;zestfulness&quot; in RC).

==Co-Counselling International==
Co-Counselling International (CCI) was started in 1974 as a breakaway from Re-evaluation Counseling by John Heron, who was at the time director of the Human Potential Research Project, University of Surrey UK, and Tom Sargent and Dency Sargent from Hartford, Connecticut, United States. Unlike other breakaways from RC, which involved changes of leadership but otherwise continued to practice in similar ways to RC, the CCI break was ideological, and CCI developed in significantly different ways.

==Relations between CCI and RC==

The existence of other co-counselling organisations is generally not mentioned in RC, and RC co-counsellors are often not aware of their existence.

Amongst those within RC who know about it, CCI is often seen as an &quot;attack organisation&quot; and was specifically condemned as such in many private and public conversations by Jackins, who claimed that Heron had started it against a specific agreement not to, and in breach of RC guidelines he had previously agreed to. In turn, Heron and many of his supporters claimed that RC was authoritarian and cult-like, and later, that Jackins engaged in sexual abuse of clients. RC supporters parried that CCI fostered a sexually-liberal atmosphere that blurred the boundaries of co-counselling and relationships. 

The history of co-counselling including its origins with RC is normally taught on CCI Fundamentals courses. CCI, by its nature, has no corporate opinion about RC, and individual CCI co-counsellors have their own views. Most CCI co-counsellors have a benevolent view toward RC, regarding it as a different, alternative approach to co-counselling. Membership of RC is not a bar to membership of CCI, and a few people manage to do both despite the RC ban.

<doc id="818332" wikidata="Q1553059" url="?curid=818332" title="Joktan">
<text>Joktan (also written as Yoktan; ; ) was the second of the two sons of Eber (Book of Genesis 10:25; 1 Chronicles 1:19) mentioned in the Hebrew Bible. He descends from Shem, son of Noah.

In the Book of Genesis 10:25 it reads: &quot;And unto Eber were born two sons: the name of one was Peleg; for in his days was the earth divided; and his brother&#x27;s name was Joktan.&quot;

Joktan&#x27;s sons in the order provided in , were Almodad, Sheleph, Hazarmaveth, Jerah, Hadoram, Uzal, Diklah, Obal, Abimael, Sheba, Ophir, Havilah, and Jobab.

In Pseudo-Philo&#x27;s account (ca. 70), Joktan was first made prince over the children of Shem, just as Nimrod and Phenech were princes over the children of Ham and Japheth, respectively. In his version, the three princes command all persons to bake bricks for the Tower of Babel; however, twelve, including several of Joktan&#x27;s own sons, as well as Abraham and Lot, refuse the orders. Joktan smuggles them out of Shinar and into the mountains, to the annoyance of the other two princes.

== South Arabian narrative ==
There is an Arab tradition that Joktan was the progenitor of all the purest tribes of Southern Arabia. Joktan has been identified with Qahtān (Arabic: قحطان), the ancestral figure of Qahtanites, in traditional Arab genealogy. Three of Joktan&#x27;s sons have connections to South Arabia. Sheba is identified as the ancient South Arabian kingdom of Saba. Hazarmaveth (Biblical Hebrew: חֲצַרְמָוֶת, tr. Ḥăṣarmāweṯ; Arabic: حضرموت) has been identified with the South Arabian region of Hadhramaut and according to various Bible dictionaries, the name &quot;Hazarmaveth&quot; means &quot;court of death&quot; which reflects a meaning similar to the Arabic folk etymologies of the region. Hadoram according to Rabbi Aryeh Kaplan is interpreted as denoting &quot;the south&quot; and it was a fortress to the south of Yemen&#x27;s Sana&#x27;a.

== Mongoloid race theory ==
Theories (based on a literal reading of , which states that Joktan&#x27;s descendants migrated eastward) suggested that Joktan is the progenitor of the Mongoloid race, including east Asians and the indigenous peoples of the Americas, with the Yucatan Peninsula supposedly being named after Joktan. One early proponent of this theory was the theologian Benito Arias Montano, who proposed a link between the names of Ophir, Joktan&#x27;s son, and Peru.

<text>George Gilbert Scott Jr. (8 October 1839 – 6 May 1897) was an English architect working in late Gothic and Queen Anne revival styles.

Known in later life as &#x27;Middle Scott&#x27;, he was the eldest son of Sir Gilbert Scott (George Gilbert Scott), and father of Sir Giles Gilbert Scott and Adrian Gilbert Scott, all also architects.

The last years of his life after the death of his father were marred by mental instability and excessive drinking. He died of cirrhosis of the liver in the Midland Grand Hotel, St Pancras, a building designed by his father.

==Biography==

Scott was born on 8 October 1839, in London, eldest son of Sir Gilbert Scott (George Gilbert Scott) and Caroline Oldrid. After a scholarship at Eton College, he began training at his father&#x27;s office. He was admitted to Jesus College, Cambridge in 1863, taking a first-class degree in moral sciences in 1866 (graduating B.A. 1867, M.A. 1870).

During the 1860s and 1870s, he worked for his father in his architectural practice. He married Ellen King Sampson in the 1870s.

He founded Watts &amp; Company in 1874 along with two other leading 19th century architects: George Frederick Bodley (the architect of Washington National Cathedral) and Thomas Garner. Bodley, Garner, and Scott all lived in Church Row in London&#x27;s Hampstead district in the 1860s and 70s and would regularly meet to discuss ideas.

Among the buildings he designed was St John the Baptist Church, Norwich, which became a Roman Catholic cathedral. He was also responsible for buildings in three of the University of Cambridge&#x27;s colleges: Christ&#x27;s, Pembroke and Peterhouse. He masterminded the main buildings of Dulwich College in South London. Some of his finest works, the churches of All Hallows, Southwark (1877), and St Agnes, Kennington (1880) were destroyed by Second World War bombing. His best remaining residential work is found in the Avenues area of Kingston upon Hull, which are in a Queen Anne revival style. Much of his work was in the Queen Anne revival style, or in imitation of later Gothic architectural styles.

After his father died in 1878, he became distant from the architectural business, and was supported by his inheritance. In 1880 Scott became a Roman Catholic, to the astonishment of his family. The later part of his life saw his mental stability questioned, and in 1883 he was placed in Bethlem Hospital. A petition of his brothers and wife resulted in his being found of unsound mind in a public examination in 1884. He escaped to Rouen in France but, returning to England in 1885, he was confined to hospital again in 1885 and 1891–1892.

Scott died on 6 May 1897 from cirrhosis of the liver whilst in residence in the Midland Grand Hotel, St Pancras, which had been designed by his father, and was buried on 11 May 1897 at St John-at-Hampstead.

He had six children, four of whom survived past childhood – two of his sons, Sir Giles Gilbert Scott and Adrian Gilbert Scott, went on to become noted architects.

<doc id="818377" wikidata="Q2152" url="?curid=818377" title="Moons of Uranus">
<text>Uranus, the seventh planet of the Solar System, has 28 confirmed moons. The 27 with names are named after characters that appear in, or are mentioned in, William Shakespeare&#x27;s plays and Alexander Pope&#x27;s poem &quot;The Rape of the Lock&quot;. Uranus&#x27;s moons are divided into three groups: thirteen inner moons, five major moons, and ten irregular moons. The inner and major moons all have prograde orbits and are cumulatively classified as regular moons. In contrast, the orbits of the irregular moons are distant, highly inclined, and mostly retrograde.

The inner moons are small dark bodies that share common properties and origins with Uranus&#x27;s rings. The five major moons are ellipsoidal, indicating that they reached hydrostatic equilibrium at some point in their past (and may still be in equilibrium), and four of them show signs of internally driven processes such as canyon formation and volcanism on their surfaces. The largest of these five, Titania, is 1,578 km in diameter and the eighth-largest moon in the Solar System, about one-twentieth the mass of the Earth&#x27;s Moon. The orbits of the regular moons are nearly coplanar with Uranus&#x27;s equator, which is tilted 97.77° to its orbit. Uranus&#x27;s irregular moons have elliptical and strongly inclined (mostly retrograde) orbits at large distances from the planet.

William Herschel discovered the first two moons, Titania and Oberon, in 1787. The other three ellipsoidal moons were discovered in 1851 by William Lassell (Ariel and Umbriel) and in 1948 by Gerard Kuiper (Miranda). These five may be in hydrostatic equilibrium. The remaining moons were discovered after 1985, either during the &quot;Voyager 2&quot; flyby mission or with the aid of advanced Earth-based telescopes.

== Discovery ==
The first two moons to be discovered were Titania and Oberon, which were spotted by Sir William Herschel on January 11, 1787, six years after he had discovered the planet itself. Later, Herschel thought he had discovered up to six moons (see below) and perhaps even a ring. For nearly 50 years, Herschel&#x27;s instrument was the only one with which the moons had been seen. In the 1840s, better instruments and a more favorable position of Uranus in the sky led to sporadic indications of satellites additional to Titania and Oberon. Eventually, the next two moons, Ariel and Umbriel, were discovered by William Lassell in 1851. The Roman numbering scheme of Uranus&#x27;s moons was in a state of flux for a considerable time, and publications hesitated between Herschel&#x27;s designations (where Titania and Oberon are Uranus II and IV) and William Lassell&#x27;s (where they are sometimes I and II). With the confirmation of Ariel and Umbriel, Lassell numbered the moons I through IV from Uranus outward, and this finally stuck. In 1852, Herschel&#x27;s son John Herschel gave the four then-known moons their names.

No other discoveries were made for almost another century. In 1948, Gerard Kuiper at the McDonald Observatory discovered the smallest and the last of the five large, spherical moons, Miranda. Decades later, the flyby of the &quot;Voyager 2&quot; space probe in January 1986 led to the discovery of ten further inner moons. Another satellite, Perdita, was discovered in 1999 by Erich Karkoschka after studying old &quot;Voyager&quot; photographs.

Uranus was the last giant planet without any known irregular moons until 1997, when astronomers using ground-based telescopes discovered Sycorax and Caliban. From 1999 to 2003, astronomers continued searching for irregular moons of Uranus using more powerful ground-based telescopes, resulting in the discovery of seven more Uranian irregular moons. In addition, two small inner moons, Cupid and Mab, were discovered using the Hubble Space Telescope in 2003. No other discoveries were made until 2021 and 2023, when Scott Sheppard and colleagues discovered one more irregular moon of Uranus (and five more candidates waiting to be announced) using the Subaru Telescope at Mauna Kea, Hawaii.

=== Spurious moons ===
After Herschel discovered Titania and Oberon on 11 January 1787, he subsequently believed that he had observed four other moons: two on 18 January and 9 February 1790, and two more on 28 February and 26 March 1794. It was thus believed for many decades thereafter that Uranus had a system of six satellites, though the four latter moons were never confirmed by any other astronomer. Lassell&#x27;s observations of 1851, in which he discovered Ariel and Umbriel, however, failed to support Herschel&#x27;s observations; Ariel and Umbriel, which Herschel certainly ought to have seen if he had seen any satellites besides Titania and Oberon, did not correspond to any of Herschel&#x27;s four additional satellites in orbital characteristics. Herschel&#x27;s four spurious satellites were thought to have sidereal periods of 5.89 days (interior to Titania), 10.96 days (between Titania and Oberon), 38.08 days, and 107.69 days (exterior to Oberon). It was therefore concluded that Herschel&#x27;s four satellites were spurious, probably arising from the misidentification of faint stars in the vicinity of Uranus as satellites, and the credit for the discovery of Ariel and Umbriel was given to Lassell.

== Names ==

Although the first two Uranian moons were discovered in 1787, they were not named until 1852, a year after two more moons had been discovered. The responsibility for naming was taken by John Herschel, son of the discoverer of Uranus. Herschel, instead of assigning names from Greek mythology, named the moons after magical spirits in English literature: the fairies Oberon and Titania from William Shakespeare&#x27;s &quot;A Midsummer Night&#x27;s Dream&quot;, and the sylph Ariel and gnome Umbriel from Alexander Pope&#x27;s &quot;The Rape of the Lock&quot; (Ariel is also a sprite in Shakespeare&#x27;s &quot;The Tempest&quot;). It is uncertain if John Herschel was the originator of the names, or if it was instead William Lassell (who discovered Ariel and Umbriel) who chose the names and asked Herschel for permission.

Subsequent names, rather than continuing the airy spirits theme (only Puck and Mab continued the trend), have focused on Herschel&#x27;s source material. In 1949, the fifth moon, Miranda, was named by its discoverer Gerard Kuiper after a thoroughly mortal character in Shakespeare&#x27;s &quot;The Tempest&quot;. The current IAU practice is to name moons after characters from Shakespeare&#x27;s plays and &quot;The Rape of the Lock&quot; (although at present only Ariel, Umbriel, and Belinda have names drawn from the latter; all the rest are from Shakespeare). The outer retrograde moons are all named after characters from one play, &quot;The Tempest&quot;; the sole known outer prograde moon, Margaret, is named from &quot;Much Ado About Nothing&quot;.

Some asteroids, also named after the same Shakespearean characters, share names with moons of Uranus: 171 Ophelia, 218 Bianca, 593 Titania, 666 Desdemona, 763 Cupido, and 2758 Cordelia.

== Characteristics and groups ==
The Uranian satellite system is the least massive among those of the giant planets. Indeed, the combined mass of the five major satellites is less than half that of Triton (the seventh-largest moon in the Solar System) alone. The largest of the satellites, Titania, has a radius of 788.9 km, or less than half that of the Moon, but slightly more than that of Rhea, the second-largest moon of Saturn, making Titania the eighth-largest moon in the Solar System. Uranus is about 10,000 times more massive than its moons.

=== Inner moons ===
As of , Uranus is known to have 13 inner moons, whose orbits all lie inside that of Miranda. The inner moons are classified into two groups based on similar orbital distances: these are the Portia group, which includes the six moons Bianca, Cressida, Desdemona, Juliet, Portia, and Rosalind; and the Belinda group, which includes the three moons Cupid, Belinda, and Perdita. All of the inner moons are intimately connected with the rings of Uranus, which probably resulted from the fragmentation of one or several small inner moons. The two innermost moons, Cordelia and Ophelia, are shepherds of Uranus&#x27;s ε ring, whereas the small moon Mab is a source of Uranus&#x27;s outermost μ ring. There may be two additional small (2–7 km in radius) undiscovered shepherd moons located about 100 km exterior to Uranus&#x27;s α and β rings.

At 162 km, Puck is the largest of the inner moons of Uranus and the only one imaged by &quot;Voyager 2&quot; in any detail. Puck and Mab are the two outermost inner satellites of Uranus. All inner moons are dark objects; their geometrical albedo is less than 10%. They are composed of water ice contaminated with a dark material, probably radiation-processed organics.

The inner moons constantly perturb each other, especially within the closely-packed Portia and Belinda groups. The system is chaotic and apparently unstable. Simulations show that the moons may perturb each other into crossing orbits, which may eventually result in collisions between the moons. Desdemona may collide with Cressida within the next million years, and Cupid will likely collide with Belinda in the next 10 million years; Perdita and Juliet may be involved in later collisions. Because of this, the rings and inner moons may be under constant flux, with moons colliding and re-accreting on short timescales.

=== Large moons ===
Uranus has five major moons: Miranda, Ariel, Umbriel, Titania, and Oberon. They range in diameter from 472 km for Miranda to 1578 km for Titania. All these moons are relatively dark objects: their geometrical albedo varies between 30 and 50%, whereas their Bond albedo is between 10 and 23%. Umbriel is the darkest moon and Ariel the brightest. The masses of the moons range from 6.7 kg (Miranda) to 3.5 kg (Titania). For comparison, the Moon has a mass of 7.5 kg. The major moons of Uranus are thought to have formed in the accretion disc, which existed around Uranus for some time after its formation or resulted from a large impact suffered by Uranus early in its history. This view is supported by their large thermal inertia, a surface property they share with dwarf planets like Pluto and Haumea. It differs strongly from the thermal behaviour of the Uranian irregular moons that is comparable to classical trans-Neptunian objects. This suggests a separate origin.

All major moons comprise approximately equal amounts rock and ice, except Miranda, which is made primarily of ice. The ice component may include ammonia and carbon dioxide. Their surfaces are heavily cratered, though all of them (except Umbriel) show signs of endogenic resurfacing in the form of lineaments (canyons) and, in the case of Miranda, ovoid race-track like structures called coronae. Extensional processes associated with upwelling diapirs are likely responsible for the origin of the coronae. Ariel appears to have the youngest surface with the fewest impact craters, while Umbriel&#x27;s appears oldest. A past 3:1 orbital resonance between Miranda and Umbriel and a past 4:1 resonance between Ariel and Titania are thought to be responsible for the heating that caused substantial endogenic activity on Miranda and Ariel.
One piece of evidence for such a past resonance is Miranda&#x27;s unusually high orbital inclination (4.34°) for a body so close to the planet. The largest Uranian moons may be internally differentiated, with rocky cores at their centers surrounded by ice mantles. Titania and Oberon may harbor liquid water oceans at the core/mantle boundary. The major moons of Uranus are airless bodies. For instance, Titania was shown to possess no atmosphere at a pressure larger than 10–20 nanobar.

The path of the Sun in the local sky over the course of a local day during Uranus&#x27;s and its major moons&#x27; summer solstice is quite different from that seen on most other Solar System worlds. The major moons have almost exactly the same rotational axial tilt as Uranus (their axes are parallel to that of Uranus). The Sun would appear to follow a circular path around Uranus&#x27;s celestial pole in the sky, at the closest about 7 degrees from it, during the hemispheric summer. Near the equator, it would be seen nearly due north or due south (depending on the season). At latitudes higher than 7°, the Sun would trace a circular path about 15 degrees in diameter in the sky, and never set during the hemispheric summer, moving to a position over the celestial equator during the Uranian equinox, and then invisible below the horizon during the hemispheric winter.

=== Irregular moons ===

Uranus&#x27;s irregular moons range in size from 120 to 200 km (Sycorax) to under 10 km (S/2023 U 1). Due to the small number of known Uranian irregular moons, it is not yet clear which of them belong to groups with similar orbital characteristics. The only known group among Uranus&#x27;s irregular moons is the Caliban group, which is clustered at orbital distances between and inclinations between 141°–144°. The Caliban group includes three retrograde moons, which are Caliban, S/2023 U 1, Stephano.

The intermediate inclinations 60° &lt; i &lt; 140° are devoid of known moons due to the Kozai instability. In this instability region, solar perturbations at apoapse cause the moons to acquire large eccentricities that lead to collisions with inner satellites or ejection. The lifetime of moons in the instability region is from 10 million to a billion years. Margaret is the only known irregular prograde moon of Uranus, and it has one of the most eccentric orbits of any moon in the Solar System.
== List ==
The Uranian moons are listed here by orbital period, from shortest to longest. Moons massive enough for their surfaces to have collapsed into a spheroid are highlighted in light blue and bolded. The inner and major moons all have prograde orbits. Irregular moons with retrograde orbits are shown in dark grey. Margaret, the only known irregular moon of Uranus with a prograde orbit, is shown in light grey. The orbits and mean distances of the irregular moons are variable over short timescales due to frequent planetary and solar perturbations, therefore the listed orbital elements of all irregular moons are averaged over a 8,000-year numerical integration by Brozović and Jacobson (2009). These may differ from osculating orbital elements provided by other sources. The orbital elements of major moons listed here are based on the epoch of 1 January 2000, while orbital elements of irregular satellites are based on the epoch of 1 January 2020.

<text>A cave automatic virtual environment (better known by the recursive acronym CAVE) is an immersive virtual reality environment where projectors are directed to between three and six of the walls of a room-sized cube. The name is also a reference to the allegory of the Cave in Plato&#x27;s &quot;Republic&quot; in which a philosopher contemplates perception, reality, and illusion.

The CAVE was invented by Carolina Cruz-Neira, Daniel J. Sandin, and Thomas A. DeFanti at the University of Illinois, Chicago Electronic Visualization Laboratory in 1992. The images on the walls were in stereo to give a depth cue.

==General characteristics==
A CAVE is typically a video theater situated within a larger room. The walls of a CAVE are typically made up of rear-projection screens, however large-scale LED displays are becoming more common. The floor can be a downward-projection screen, a bottom projected screen, or a flat panel display. The projection systems are very high-resolution due to the near distance viewing which requires very small pixel sizes to retain the illusion of reality. The user wears 3D glasses inside the CAVE to see 3D graphics generated by the CAVE. People using the CAVE can see objects apparently floating in the air, and can walk around them, getting a proper view of what they would look like in reality. This was initially made possible by electromagnetic sensors, but has converted to infrared cameras. The frame of early CAVEs had to be built from non-magnetic materials such as wood to minimize interference with the electromagnetic sensors; the change to infrared tracking has removed that limitation. A CAVE user&#x27;s movements are tracked by the sensors typically attached to the 3D glasses and the video continually adjusts to retain the viewers perspective. Computers control both this aspect of the CAVE and the audio aspect. There are typically multiple speakers placed at multiple angles in the CAVE, providing 3D sound to complement the 3D video.

==Technology==

A lifelike visual display is created by projectors positioned outside the CAVE and controlled by physical movements from a user inside the CAVE. A motion capture system records the real time position of the user. Stereoscopic LCD shutter glasses convey a 3D image. The computers rapidly generate a pair of images, one for each of the user&#x27;s eyes, based on the motion capture data. The glasses are synchronized with the projectors so that each eye only sees the correct image. Since the projectors are positioned outside the cube, mirrors are often used to reduce the distance required from the projectors to the screens. One or more computers drive the projectors. Clusters of desktop PCs are popular to run CAVEs, because they cost less and run faster.

Software and libraries designed specifically for CAVE applications are available. There are several techniques for rendering the scene. There are three popular scene graphs in use today: OpenSG, OpenSceneGraph, and OpenGL Performer. OpenSG and OpenSceneGraph are open source; while OpenGL Performer is free, its source code is not included.

==Calibration==

To be able to create an image that will not be distorted or out of place, the displays and sensors must be calibrated. The calibration process depends on the motion capture technology being used. Optical or Inertial-acoustic systems only requires to configure the zero and the axes used by the tracking system. Calibration of electromagnetic sensors (like the ones used in the first cave) is more complex. In this case a person will put on the special glasses needed to see the images in 3D. The projectors then fill the CAVE with many one-inch boxes set one foot apart. The person then takes an instrument called an &quot;ultrasonic measurement device&quot; which has a cursor in the middle of it, and positions the device so that the cursor is visually in line with the projected box. This process can go on until almost 400 different blocks are measured. Each time the cursor is placed inside a block, a computer program records the location of that block and sends the location to another computer. If the points are calibrated accurately, there should be no distortion in the images that are projected in the CAVE. This also allows the CAVE to correctly identify where the user is located and can precisely track their movements, allowing the projectors to display images based on where the person is inside the CAVE.

==Applications==
The concept of the original CAVE has been reapplied and is currently being used in a variety of fields. Many universities own CAVE systems. CAVEs have many uses. Many engineering companies use CAVEs to enhance product development. Prototypes of parts can be created and tested, interfaces can be developed, and factory layouts can be simulated, all before spending any money on physical parts. This gives engineers a better idea of how a part will behave in the product in its entirety. CAVEs are also used more and more in the collaborative planning in construction sector. Researchers can use CAVE system to conduct their research topic in a more accessible and effective method. For example, CAVEs was applied on the investigation of training subjects on landing an F-16 aircraft.

The EVL team at UIC released the CAVE2 in October 2012. Similar to the original CAVE, it is a 3D immersive environment but is based on LCD panels rather than projection.

<text>The International Association of Machinists and Aerospace Workers (IAM) is an AFL–CIO/CLC trade union representing over 600,000 workers as of 2024 in more than 200 industries with most of its membership in the United States and Canada.

== Origin ==

On May 5, 1888, Thomas W. Talbot, a railroad machinist in Atlanta, Georgia, founded the Order of United Machinists and Mechanical Engineers. Talbot and 18 others had been members in the Knights of Labor. Talbot believed that a union needed to be formed for railroad machinists that would resist wage cuts. He wanted to provide insurance against unemployment, illness, and accidents but also wanted railroad machinists to be recognized for their craft skill. Unlike the Knights of Labor, who accepted everyone, Talbot&#x27;s union accepted only white US citizens, preferably native-born. The union excluded blacks, women, and non-citizens, and had secret passwords. Despite the secrecy, the order spread beyond Georgia, thanks in part to &quot;boomers&quot;, men who traveled the railway lines for work. These boomers established local lodges in new areas. Within one year there were 40 lodges, and by 1891, there were 189.

On May 6, 1889, the Machinists held their first major convention in Atlanta. Talbot was elected the Grand Master Machinist (later known as the international president), and William L. Dawley was elected as Grand Secretary (now known as General Secretary-Treasurer). The Organization&#x27;s name was changed to the National Association of Machinists (NAM) and a constitution was drawn up. The NAM began publishing the 16-page &quot;Machinists Monthly Journal&quot;. Also in 1889, Frank French designed an emblem for the union. The emblem consisted of a flywheel, a friction joint caliper, and a machinist&#x27;s square with the initials of the organization. According to French, the flywheel represented the ongoing power of the union once it started, and the caliper signified an extended invitation to all persons of civilized countries. The square signified that IAM was square and honest.

In 1890 and 1891, NAM reached Canada, making Canadians the first international members. Locals were also formed in Mexico. To reflect this, in 1891 the name was changed from National Association of Machinists to International Association of Machinists (IAM), at a conference in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania.

In 1892, IAM signed a contract with the Atchison, Topeka and Santa Fe Railway, establishing the first organized shop at a railroad in the United States. Because IAM had a color bar, the American Federation of Labor (AFL) did not accept IAM right away.

After IAM finally did join the AFL, AFL President Samuel Gompers urged IAM to drop its whites-only rule. But IAM maintained racial segregation, arguing that it needed to retain Southern members. Talbot wanted the union to be a fraternity of white men born in the United States who possessed good moral character. His sentiments were echoed by other AFL member unions, whose locals routinely discriminated against black workers through racial exclusion policies, which the AFL rarely commented on.

==1920s–1940s==
World War I and wartime production drove membership in the Machinists to 300,000 in 1918, making it the country&#x27;s largest union. Just five years later, membership dropped to 80,000. Amid the Great Depression, membership declined further, to 50,000—some 23,000 of whom were unemployed. In 1935, the machinists started to organize with the airline industry. In 1936, the Boeing Company in Seattle, Washington, signed the industry&#x27;s first labor agreement. By 1938, the IAM negotiated the first union agreement in air transportation with Eastern Air Lines. In 1944, IAM union members established an education department to publish a supplemental journal. Initially published weekly by &quot;The Machinist,&quot; the IAM newspaper, the journal&#x27;s production was eventually reduced to twice a year, then voted out of existence in 1956. It was replaced with a quarterly magazine entitled &quot;The IAMW Journal&quot;.

===Break with AFL===
In 1945, IAM disaffiliated with the AFL, which had failed to settle a jurisdictional dispute between IAM and the United Brotherhood of Carpenters and Joiners of America as well as the Amalgamated Association of Street and Electric Railway and Motor Coach Employees of America. 

In 1947 Congress passed the Taft Hartley Act, officially known as the Labor-Management Relations Act, which placed restrictions on union activities. This act also contained provisions that made closed shops illegal and outlawed boycotts. The second section of the Taft Hartley Act was controversial because it allowed states to pass right-to-work laws, which enabled them to regulate the number of union shops. Furthermore, the machinists worked with AFL unions to repeal the act. The limitations imposed on union political activity by this act led to the creation of the Machinists&#x27; Non-Partisan Political League. In 1948, Lodge 751 went on strike against the Boeing Company in Seattle, Washington. The machinists preserved longstanding seniority rules that the company wanted to abolish and achieved a 10 percent per hour raise. IAM also competed for members with the United Auto Workers of America in the automotive industry and with the United Aerospace Workers for aircraft working in that union. In 1949, IAM signed no-raiding agreements with both unions. Those agreements become the model for other unions when AFL and the CIO merged in 1955.

==Recent history==

The 1950s was a period of rapid growth for IAM. The production of jet engines during the war led IAM to expand to the aircraft industry. By 1958, IAM had more than 900,000 members. This was because IAM took steps to begin to move away from its racist past. In 1955, under the leadership of President Al Hayes IAM became more of an industrial union; it began to shift from railroad work to metal fabrication. IAM had more union members as well as workers in the aircraft industry. Thus, Aerospace workers were attracted to join IAM. The trade union produced a first-of-its-kind radio show, Boomer Jones, to tell their history in a modern way.

In 1964, IAM changed its name to the International Association of Machinists and Aerospace Workers. IAMAW began to strike against five major airlines, including Eastern, National, Northwest, Trans World, and United Airlines. 35,400 IAMAW members in 231 cities grounded the airlines for 43 days finally winning 5 percent raises in three successive years. IAM membership nearly doubled in the 1950s, in large part due to the burgeoning airline industry, from 501,000 members in 1949 to 903,000 members in 1958. As a result of the influx of members from the airlines and the new American space program, the delegates voted to change the name to the International Association of Machinists and Aerospace Workers at the 1964 convention. In 1982, due to individual and corporate bankruptcies IAM membership dropped to 820,211 members from a high of 927,000 in 1973. Also, in 1982 boycott was initiated by the IAM against Brown &amp; Sharpe, a machine, precision, measuring and cutting tool manufacturer, headquartered in Rhode Island. The boycott was called after the firm refused to bargain in good faith (withdrawing previously negotiated clauses in the contract), and forced the union into a strike, during which police sprayed pepper gas on some 800 picketers at the company&#x27;s North Kingston plant in early 1982. Three weeks later, a machinist narrowly escaped serious injury when a shot fired into the picket line hit his belt buckle.

The National Labor Relations Board later charged Brown &amp; Sharpe with regressive bargaining, and of entering into negotiations with the express purpose of not reaching an agreement with the union. It was not until 1998, nearly seventeen years after the strike began, that the Rhode Island Supreme Court ended the legal battle, ultimately siding with Brown &amp; Sharpe in its plea that it had not illegally forced the strike. By this point, both Brown &amp; Sharpe and its erstwhile work force were retreating from manufacturing in Rhode Island.

From 1981 to 1990 the union owned and operated an Indy Car racing team, Machinists Union Racing.

In 1991, the union absorbed the Pattern Makers&#x27; League of North America. The Transportation Communications International Union (TCU) merged with the IAM, after a TCU member vote in July 2005.

On September 7, 2008, the union began a 57-day strike against Boeing over issues with outsourcing, job security, pay and benefits.

The union continues to expand into different companies today. In December 2013 the union&#x27;s attempt to represent workers at an Amazon.com fulfillment center in Middletown, Delaware, failed. In 2020, the union began a strike at Bath Iron Works, a major shipyard in Bath, Maine, over disagreements regarding a new labor contract with the company. The strike, occurring during the COVID-19 pandemic, was described by the IAM President as &quot;the largest strike in the United States of America right now.” The strike ended after two months, with new labor contract agreements viewed as favorable to the union members.

On September 12, 2024, IAM District 751 voted to strike against Boeing over a proposed contract&#x27;s pay and benefits with 94.6% of votes in and 96% in favor of a strike. The union leadership had reached a tentative agreement with Boeing prior to the vote and endorsed the contract.

==Composition==

According to IAM&#x27;s Department of Labor records, since 2005, when membership classifications were first reported, the union&#x27;s membership has been generally in a slow decline, including &quot;dues paying&quot;, &quot;retired&quot;, and &quot;exempt&quot; members. Despite this, &quot;life&quot; members were reported to have had a 22 percent increase during this period, and &quot;unemployed&quot; members momentarily increased to a peak in 2009, before also declining. Members classified as &quot;on strike&quot; have varied considerably throughout, although remaining less than 1 percent of the total membership. IAM contracts also cover some non-members, known as agency fee payers, which since 2005 have grown to number comparatively just over 1 percent of the size of the union&#x27;s membership. As of 2013, this accounts for about 145,000 &quot;retirees&quot; (25 percent), 52,000 &quot;life&quot; members (9 percent), 26,000 &quot;exempt&quot; members (5 percent), and 14,000 &quot;unemployed&quot; members (2 percent), plus about 7,000 non-members paying agency fees, compared to about 333,000 dues paying&quot; members (58 percent).

==Legal issues==
The association was sued in 2010 after an election of local union officers went badly. A lawsuit was brought by the officers against the union and claimed libel, defamation, and invasion of privacy. While the court ruled for the defendant, the case exposed thousands of grievances filed against the union, dubious handling of the election, and other misconduct; including using union computer equipment for viewing pornography, missing promotional items purchased with union funds, and significant mishandling of union funds.

In 1980, the union sued the Federal Election Commission for issues surrounding political action committee contributions. This case eventually went to the Supreme Court.

In 2022, a Boeing worker sued the union over unlawful dues deductions. The settlement required IAM to return illegally seized dues.

The association sued furniture maker IKEA over unsafe workplace issues in 2010.

<text>Stelle is an unincorporated community located in Rogers Township in northern Ford County, Illinois, United States. As of 2013, its estimated population is 100.

The community was established as an intentional community in the early 1970s. In 1982, Stelle transitioned to a standard homeowner&#x27;s association, a structure it maintains today.

== Historical overview ==

Stelle was founded in 1973 by the &quot;Stelle Group&quot;, a Chicago-based organization established by Richard Kieninger, a writer and teacher who also played a role in founding Adelphi, Texas. In the 1950s, Kieninger was a student of the Lemurian Fellowship in Ramona, California.

Its founders, who belonged to a recently formed group from Chicago, purchased farmland in the northern part of Ford County and developed a suburban-style community. Stelle initially operated as a private community.

In 1982, Stelle transitioned into a homeowner association and opened to the public. Following the transition, Stelle became notable for the incorporation of solar panels on many homes and residents&#x27; emphasis on cooperative enterprises. The village has its own telephone company, providing telephone, television, and internet services. Additional community features include a community garden co-op, a tool co-op, and a weekly communal dinner. Stelle also hosts educational events open to the public.

<text>Bath Spa University is a public university in Bath, England, with its main campus at Newton Park, about west of the centre of the city. The university has other campuses in the city of Bath, and one at Corsham Court in Wiltshire.

The institution gained full university status in August 2005, having been previously known as Bath College of Higher Education, and later Bath Spa University College.

== History ==
The institution can trace its roots back to the foundation of the Bath School of Art in 1852, following the impact of The Great Exhibition of 1851.

In 1946, Bath Teacher Training College was opened on the Newton Park campus, as part of the post-war initiatives to fill wartime teaching shortages. It was a women&#x27;s college offering two year courses, under the Principal Mary Dawson. The present institution was formed in 1975 as Bath College of Higher Education by the merger of Bath Teacher Training College and Bath College of Domestic Science. In 1983 Bath Academy of Art also merged into the college.

In 1992, the college was granted degree-awarding powers and in 1997 adopted the name Bath Spa University College. In March 2005 the institution was granted university status, becoming Bath Spa University in August 2005.

In 2013, the university was the UK&#x27;s sixth-largest provider of teacher education.

== Campuses ==

=== Newton Park ===

The Newton Park campus, to the west of Bath near the village of Newton St Loe, is the largest of the university&#x27;s three main campuses. It is here that courses from all schools are taught, with the exception of art and design and most post-graduate courses. The campus is in Newton Park, in grounds designed by English landscape architect Lancelot &quot;Capability&quot; Brown and leased from the Duchy of Cornwall.

The campus has buildings from a mixture of ages. These include the Grade I listed Main House built between 1762 and 1765 by Stiff Leadbetter for Joseph Langton MP; the remnants of the 14th-century Newton St Loe Castle, a scheduled monument also with Grade I listed status; and Grade II* listed stable buildings, gardens and a walled garden.

It is the university&#x27;s only campus to have student accommodation on site, and is also home to the Students&#x27; Union. The site has a lake, nature reserve, woodlands and arable farmland. The site underwent extensive development in the 2010s.

==== &#x27;Commons&#x27; academic building ====
In the summer of 2012, work began on the development of a new academic building called &quot;Commons&quot;, roughly in the centre of the Newton Park campus. Next to the academic building is an outside amphitheatre, primarily for use by the School of Music and Performing arts. The building was officially opened on 5 June 2014 by film producer Lord Puttnam.

==== Michael Tippett Centre ====
The Michael Tippett Centre is the only purpose-built concert hall in Bath. The building has many teaching rooms and spaces, and the hall is used for lectures, mainly by the School of Music and Performing Arts. The hall is also used for exhibitions, musical performances and plays from student performers as well professional acts from around the country.

==== University Theatre ====
The University Theatre, completed in 2006, was part of a £5.7m scheme designed by Fielden Clegg Bradley Architects LLP. It consists of a 186-seat auditorium with backstage and technical facilities, and three large teaching studios. The venue is used by the School of Music and Performing Arts for teaching actors, directors, production managers, choreographers and dancers.

=== Bath School of Art and Design, Sion Hill, Bath ===
The Sion Hill campus in the north of Bath, in the Lansdown district, houses the Bath School of Art and Design and the majority of art and design courses are taught here. Its history extends to the original Bath School of Art which was founded in 1852. One of the earliest Masters of the school was Anthony Carey Stannus, an Irish painter noted for marine scenes, who later helped establish a society which evolved into the Royal Ulster Academy.

Until 2009, the university also owned the nearby Somerset Place. The sale of this listed Georgian crescent was intended to finance a new campus in the city centre. This development, alongside the Dyson School of Design Innovation, did not proceed due to planning issues relating to the chosen riverside site.

=== Corsham Court, Corsham ===

The university has a specialist centre for postgraduate research and teaching in Corsham Court, Corsham, Wiltshire. The university developed this centre in 2008 after an absence of more than 20 years from the site. Corsham Court became the home of the Bath Academy of Art (now Bath School of Art and Design and part of the university) when its premises were destroyed during the Second World War. Walter Sickert, who taught there, was also a mentor to Lord Methuen, owner of the Court.

The centre handles the majority of postgraduate courses, and includes development support for research projects, postgraduate workshops, studios and seminar rooms providing facilities for the academic schools, specialist facilities for music, photography, film and textiles, a library, shared quiet study and social learning spaces for Masters and PhD research students, a common room, a university research office which works with schools on the development of funding bids to external agencies, and a gallery which is managed by the Bath School of Art and Design in support of undergraduate and postgraduate curriculum activities.

===Rush Hill, Bath===
This campus is in the Southdown area of Bath. It is next to Bath Community Academy (formerly Culverhay School) and was formerly the school&#x27;s Humanities block. The campus is the home to most of the university&#x27;s Postgraduate Certificate in Education secondary and middle years education courses, including history, music, English, geography, mathematics and religious education. Facilities at the campus are not as extensive as those found in Newton Park but there are IT facilities and a common room.

===Additional teaching sites===

The university maintains smaller satellite teaching spaces around Bath for use by students on certain courses, often those that require large amounts of space that are not available at the other campuses.

* Dartmouth Avenue, Bath was developed as a series of painting and media studios as well as a project space for year two students by the Bath School of Art and Design. This was to offset the loss of space incurred with the sale of Somerset Place. The site has been expanded into an adjoining building to accommodate creative studios and a second, larger, project space (the first now being predominantly used for life drawing classes).
* Burdall&#x27;s Yard, Bath is an Arts Centre for the School of Music and Performing Arts. The centre is used as a teaching, rehearsal and performance space and also hosts cultural events. These have included Party in the City (Bath Festival) and a UK Songwriting Festival gig with singer/songwriter Eddi Reader.
* Ashman&#x27;s Yard, Bath is home to the Theatre Production Centre for the School of Music and Performing Arts. Located between Newton Park campus and Bath City centre, it was formally opened by the Vice Chancellor, Christina Slade, in 2012. Students based here undertake practical work on the BA (Hons) theatre production course. Facilities include a construction workshop, costume workshop, prop making workshop, production office with Mac editing suite, and a student common room.
* Artswork Media Ltd at Paintworks, Bristol is the university&#x27;s media production company that is run by media professionals and third year students. It offers training, professional practice and experiential learning for students of various programmes. It provides a production office, edit suites, lighting equipment and video cameras.
* It also includes the Bath Academy of Media Makeup among its affiliates.

=== Expansion ===
Since 2012, substantial development has been undertaken at the Newton Park campus and plans exist for further development in the future, subject to being granted planning permission. The campus buildings were gradually refurbished and modified to deal with the influx of students expected in the 2010s. In 2011 the Duchy of Cornwall, the university&#x27;s landlord, raised objections to these plans.

====Locksbrook Campus====
In October 2015, the university announced that it had submitted proposals for the purchase and redevelopment of the former Herman Miller furniture factory on Locksbrook Road, Bath, about west of Bath city centre. The site would become a new home for Bath School of Art and Design, as the Sion Hill campus did not provide enough academic space for the university&#x27;s needs. The proposals detail changes that would be made to car parking provision on the site, as well as a more general transport plan for the campus. The factory was designed by Nicholas Grimshaw, completed in 1977 and Grade II listed in 2013.

In 2016, the purchase went ahead, and the planning application for the redevelopment was approved by Bath and North East Somerset Council in September 2017. Remodelling and refurbishment was again designed by Grimshaw Architects, and the building was opened as the Locksbrook Campus in October 2019.

==Academic profile ==
===Rankings and reputation===
 
In 2005, 2006 and 2008 the university was named in the top 10 modern British universities by &quot;The Sunday Times&quot;, at positions 8, 5 and 8 respectively. The university was again ranked 8th best modern university in the UK by &quot;The Sunday Times&quot; in their 2016 university guide.

According to the 2014 Research Excellence Framework assessment, 51% of the research undertaken at the university was either world-leading or internationally significant, up from 19% in 2008. Acceptance rate was 12%.

Bath Spa University was ranked in 2017 as one of the top five creative universities in the UK by &quot;Which?&quot;&#x27;s student survey.

=== Partnership and collaboration ===
The university has formed partnerships with a number of regional Further Education Colleges and institutions. Under the partnership, students take the first year of their higher education course in their local college and, if successful, the rest of their course at Bath Spa University. The British and Irish Modern Music Institute campus in Bristol has all of its courses verified by Bath Spa University.
The partners are:
*Circomedia
*Bath College
*City of Bristol College
*New College, Swindon
*Weston College
*Wiltshire College at Trowbridge and Salisbury
*British and Irish Modern Music Institute in Bristol

=== Student satisfaction ===
The university has seen a significant dip in student satisfaction in recent years, slipping to 113th place in the UK with an overall satisfaction rate of 71.7% in 2021 according to the Office for Students. In 2015, by contrast, Bath Spa University was ranked joint 20th in the United Kingdom with 90% student satisfaction, 4% above the national average of 86%. In 2013 and 2014, student satisfaction was 87% and 89% respectively.

== Student life ==
=== Student accommodation ===
The university currently offers accommodation to 2,264 students in several locations around the Bath area, as well as on its main Newton Park campus.

==== Newton Park Campus ====
The Newton Park Campus currently houses 868 students in single, shared and en-suite study bedrooms. The accommodation forms two groups of buildings at either end of the campus, known as Lakeside and Gardens. Bus stops by the library building and Lakeside accommodation service the U5 bus. Both groups of accommodation have access to laundrette facilities. Because of the limited availability of parking, students living on campus are not permitted to bring a car, however bicycle racks and some motorcycle parking spaces are available.

In June 2013, work began on the development of a new &quot;student village&quot; in the main Newton Park campus, known as Gardens, which houses 561 first year students in separate &quot;houses&quot; of up to ten students. Building work was completed during the summer of 2014 in time for the start of the academic year in October. Work on the surrounding landscaping and car parks was completed during early 2015.

Mail services at the university are handled at a building called &#x27;The Vinery&#x27;, which also contains the estates and management team and is located adjacent to the Students&#x27; Union building, and next to the estates and management workshops and garages. The university also has two Amazon Lockers on campus, situated in the Refectory and outside Stanton building.

==== City accommodation ====
* Waterside Court: Offers 316 en-suite bed spaces and is run by student accommodation company Unite Students. It is next to the Charlton Court accommodation on the Lower Bristol Road, and is only a short distance from the centre of Bath and has a nearby bus stop with buses running to the centre as well as the university itself.
* Charlton Court: Offers 294 en-suite bed spaces and is run by Unite Students. It is located next to the Waterside Court accommodation on the Lower Bristol Road.
* Twerton Mill: In 2015 the university acquired 277 rooms at the new Twerton Mill development on the Lower Bristol Road. These rooms were made available as of the 2015/2016 academic year. The development is a carless site, with only four total parking spaces; three disabled spaces and one maintenance space. This development consists of a mixture of en-suite and traditional town houses with shared bathrooms and kitchens. Run by CRM, facilities at Twerton Mill include: laundry facilities, common room, secure bicycle storage, inclusive bills, basic Endsleigh contents insurance included in the tenancy and wifi with a base speed of 50Mb wired.
* Bankside House: Situated 10 minutes from the Sion Hill campus, and comprises 10 flats making a total of 40 student bed spaces. It is near the Sion Hill campus, the Circus, Dartmouth Avenue and City of Bath College

=== Students&#x27; Union ===

The main Students&#x27; Union facilities are at the Newton Park campus, although the Union maintains a presence in all campuses. The Main union building runs a bar, café, gym and shop, and hosts regular events throughout the academic year. There are 12 sports societies, 43 interest societies and 16 sports clubs run by the union, many of which compete in the BUCS. The sports facilities include rugby and football pitches at the top of the campus, as well as a netball court and changing facilities inside the walled garden adjacent to the union building. The walled garden itself is also a social space, featuring BBQs, games tables, seating and tables, a small pond, greenhouses and small allotment style areas. The Union is in charge of organising the Freshers events, as well as the Winter and Summer balls. It also has facilities to run health campaigns and give academic advice to students, volunteering and skill development opportunities, travel opportunities, and it liaises directly with the university and organisations nationally and in the local area to campaign about and discuss issues that affect students.

The Union also has its own student card called Student Zest, founded by students in 2012 which offers discounts on goods and services offered in over 100 local businesses. There is a dedicated website that deals with matters concerning this card.

The Students&#x27; Union building at Newton Park campus was refurbished during the summer of 2014, doubling the size of the shop, reconfiguring the bar/cafe area, improving the gym, and updating the toilet facilities. There is also a new footpath around the front entrance of the building, improving access. The Students&#x27; Union is also working with the university, the student body, and architects, to produce a long-term plan to completely rebuild the Union.

===Alumni community===
Bath Spa University&#x27;s growing alumni community is a network of over 80,000 graduates, former students and staff, honorary graduates, friends and benefactors. It publishes an annual alumni magazine and promotes raising philanthropic income for a wide range of important projects for the university, particularly the Bath Spa Students Fund and bursaries. The president is Mary Berry, who is a former student of the Bath College of Domestic Science and is the recipient of an honorary doctorate from the university.

===Oak Tree Day Nursery===
Oak Tree Day Nursery was established in 1995 and operates from two adjoining houses in the parkland grounds of the university&#x27;s Newton Park campus. It is a full day-care nursery offering both full and part-time places for the children of university staff and students as well as the local community. It has won numerous awards, including The Baby Quality Award in 2011, the Children&#x27;s and Young People&#x27;s Rights Gold Award in 2012, and the Director of Public Health Award in 2013.

<doc id="818432" wikidata="Q7818659" url="?curid=818432" title="Guard, Tomb of the Unknown Soldier Identification Badge">
<text>The Guard, Tomb of the Unknown Soldier Identification Badge is a military badge of the United States Army that honors those soldiers who have been chosen to serve as members of the Honor Guard, known as &quot;Sentinels&quot;, at the Tomb of the Unknown Soldier. It is the third-least awarded badge in the US Military, after the Military Horseman Identification Badge and the Astronaut Badge. , 722 soldiers have been awarded this badge.

==Design==
The badge itself is made of heavy sterling silver approximately two inches in diameter. The obverse design consists of an inverted wreath, a sign of mourning, and the East face of the Tomb which contains the figures of Peace, Valor and Victory. Superimposed on the bottom of the Tomb under the three figures are the words &quot;Honor Guard&quot;.
The badge was designed in 1956 and first issued to members of the Honor Guard at the Tomb of the Unknown Soldier on February 7, 1958. The badge was first issued only as a temporary wear item, meaning the Soldiers could only wear the badge during their tenure as members of the Honor Guard. Upon leaving the duty, the badge was returned and reissued to incoming Soldiers. In 1963, regulations were changed to allow the badge to be worn as a permanent part of the military uniform after the Soldier&#x27;s completion of duty at the Tomb of the Unknown Soldier. It was also permanently awarded to those who had previously earned it.

==Award process==
The bestowing authority of the Guard, Tomb of the Unknown Soldier Identification Badge is the Commanding Officer, 4th Battalion, 3rd U.S. Infantry in accordance with Army Regulation 600-8-22. For a service member to permanently receive the badge, they must serve nine months as a member of the Honor Guard and receive a recommendation from the Commanding Officer of the Honor Guard Company.

The Guard, Tomb of the Unknown Soldier Identification Badge can be revoked if a Soldier disgraces him or herself in a manner that brings dishonor on the Tomb. This action can happen even after the Soldier completes his or her tour as a member of the Honor Guard.

==Recipients==
The first recipient of this badge was William Daniel, a former prisoner of war who served as a tomb sentinel and sergeant of the guard at the Tomb of the Unknown Soldier from February 1957 to June 1960. He retired with the rank of Master Sergeant in 1965 after 22 years of Army service. Daniel died in 2009 and is interred in Section 35 at Arlington National Cemetery, located just south of the Tomb.

Women were not eligible to receive the badge until a woman in a military police unit was assigned to The Old Guard in 1993, thus enabling women to volunteer for guard duty at the Tomb. The first female soldier to earn the badge was Sgt. Heather Lynn Johnsen.

<text>Midwestern State University (MSU Texas) is a public liberal arts university in Wichita Falls, Texas. As of Fall 2024, MSU Texas enrolled 5,324 students. It is the state&#x27;s only public institution focused on the liberal arts.

==History==
Founded in 1922 as the municipally-owned Wichita Falls Junior College, it was renamed Hardin Junior College in 1937 when it moved from Wichita Falls High School to its present location off Taft Boulevard. In 1946, a senior division was added and it was renamed Hardin College. In January 1950, the name changed to Midwestern University, with the junior college division remaining Hardin Junior College. In March 1948, the university became a member of the Association of Colleges and Secondary Schools. In January 1959, the university added a graduate school which received full approval from the State Board of Education in August of that year.

A further change in the school&#x27;s status came September 1, 1961, when by action of the 56th session of the Texas State Legislature, Midwestern University was transferred from the city of Wichita Falls to the Texas Colleges and Universities System and the junior college division was dissolved. In 1975, the Texas Legislature changed the name to Midwestern State University.

From its beginnings as a municipal junior college housed in a high school building, Midwestern has become a state university whose campus of 255 acres and 70 buildings offers a wide variety of academic programs in liberal and fine arts, mathematics, sciences, business, and applied sciences.

On March 9, 2015, the university announced that Suzanne Shipley was selected to become its next president, following Jesse Rogers&#x27; retirement after 48 years of service to the school.

On December 13, 2016, the university broke ground on a new campus in Flower Mound, Texas. The two-story facility shares space with North Central Texas College and opened in June 2018.

The Robert and Carol Gunn College of Health Sciences and Human Services officially opened up their new building, Centennial Hall, on September 6, 2019.

On August 6, 2020, the Texas Tech University System and Midwestern State University agreed to a memorandum of understanding to begin the process of MSU Texas becoming the fifth university to join the system. The process was completed on September 1, 2021, when HB 1522 went into effect.

==Academics==

Midwestern State University is organized into seven colleges with 16 undergraduate programs offering 43 majors and 30 minors, and 9 graduate programs offering 28 majors and 15 minors.

MSU is the only university in Texas with membership in the Council of Public Liberal Arts Colleges and was the first public university in Texas to establish a core curriculum. The university is also a member of the Association of American Colleges and Universities and the Association for Core Texts and Courses.

The Dalquest Desert Research Station is located on 3,000 acres of West Texas soil north of the Big Bend Ranch State Park. The land was a gift from Walter W. Dalquest, a professor at MSU, and his wife, Rose, on the condition that it be used for scientific research by biologists and geologists. Today, the site is used by professors, students, naturalists, scientists, and educators.

==Athletics==

The campus newspaper and production studio are housed in the Mass Communication wing of the Fain Fine Arts Center.

=== Housing and dining services ===

== Controversies ==
*Since 2018, several incidents of racially-motivated vandalism and harassment have been reported at Midwestern State University. The university administration has been repeatedly criticized by students of color for its handling of such incidents, as well as for its perceived indifference to issues facing racial minorities more generally.
*In 2018 the Midwestern State University faced widespread criticism from students in response to the administration&#x27;s perceived indifference to sexual harassment and violence on campus. A university administrator reportedly made a rape joke at a campus forum intended to discuss the issue.
*In 2019 a Midwestern State University graduate student was publicly outed as a white supremacist. The university was roundly criticized for its handling of the ensuing controversy.
*In 2020 Midwestern State University was widely and publicly criticized for its response to a right-wing harassment campaign that had been directed against former philosophy professor Nathan Jun in response to controversial Facebook posts. The following year the university was again criticized for allegedly forcing Jun to resign his tenured position by denying him a requested disability accommodation. The allegation prompted an open letter of protest that was eventually signed by more than 500 faculty members.

<doc id="818452" wikidata="Q4526932" url="?curid=818452" title="Echelon (2001 video game)">
<text>Echelon () is a 3-D science fiction flight simulator video game developed by Saint Petersburg developers MADia Entertainment. It was published in Russia by Buka Entertainment, and in all other territories by Bethesda Softworks.

==Gameplay==

It involves flying futuristic fighters in combat scenarios. The game can be played locally or on a local area network with up to 32 players. The Russian version of the game is called &quot;Шторм&quot; (&quot;Storm&quot;). &quot;&quot; (also developed by MADia) takes place in the same continuity as &quot;Echelon&quot;. 

==Plot==
In the game, you decide the fate of the entire Galactic Federation. The aggressors from the planet Velian, having new weapons that make them almost invincible, are trying to destroy the Federation and capture all of its colonies. The Velians are ruthless to those who are trying to get in their way. They calmly burn entire planets if they show resistance.
The player will have to go from the cadet of the Training Center of the Air Force of the Federation to one of the best Air Force aces, who is assigned the most difficult tasks.

==Development==
The game went gold on April 26, 2001. The game was originally called &quot;Storm&quot; but that name later proved unavailable. Pete Hines (Bethesda&#x27;s director of marketing and public relations) and Bethesda&#x27;s Todd Vaughn were given the task of renaming the game. One morning Todd came to Hine&#x27;s desk and said, &#x27;How about Echelon?&#x27; They liked the military reference and it just sounded cool, so they went with it, hoping there would be no conflicts. The name idea was sent to Brent Erickson, who was VP of development at Bethesda West the company&#x27;s subsidiary that developed the Bethesda racing titles for a number of years. Erickson liked the name.

==Reception==
&quot;Echelon&quot; received above-average reviews according to the review aggregation website Metacritic. Steve Butts of &quot;IGN&quot; said, &quot;In all &quot;Echelon&quot; is a very welcome addition to the flight sim genre. It takes an approach that most other developers have neglected. Still, the execution and design aren&#x27;t entirely up to the possibility of the concept. You&#x27;ll play it, you&#x27;ll enjoy and, ultimately, put it aside for more traditional games that offer a lot more sparkle.&quot; &quot;GameSpot&quot; said, &quot;In spite of its problems, Echelon does hit close enough to the mark to offer some fast and flashy, but ultimately shallow, thrills.&quot; However, Jim Preston of &quot;NextGen&quot; said of the game, &quot;Credit to Buka for trying to combine two genres, but predictably it neither soars nor crashes.&quot;

===Awards===
The game was a runner-up for &quot;Sci-Fi Simulation Game of the Year&quot; at &quot;GameSpot&quot;″s Readers&#x27; Choice Awards 2001.

==Sequel==
==Controversy==

There was controversy regarding the U.S release of the game in which Bethesda refused to pay MADia for boxed sales of the game.

<doc id="818457" wikidata="Q5908762" url="?curid=818457" title="Hospital of St John the Baptist, High Wycombe">
<text>The Hospital of St John the Baptist was a hospital in High Wycombe in Buckinghamshire, England between 1180 and 1548. It was situated on the main road that ran from Oxford to London (what is now the A40) east of the town centre.

==The Hospital==
In the 12th century hospitals were used as almshouses for the poor or infirm. 

The Hospital of St John the Baptist was founded by the Catholic church. The foundation date is not recorded, but the surviving capitals suggest a date in the 1170s or ‘80s. The founder was perhaps one Adam Walder, as in an inquisition of 1245 it was recorded that the brethren and sisters of the house were to pray for his soul. 

The hospital was run by a Master (normally a monk or other religious figure) and a small community of brothers and sisters (other members of the church) who cared for the people who came to them for help. Three further beds at the hospital were also set aside for other poor or infirm people who were passing through on the road either to London or to Oxford. The earliest known Master was Brother Gilbert who, in 1236, wrote to Pope Gregory IX in Rome asking for permission to establish a chapel dedicated to St John the Baptist at the hospital. This permission was granted by Papal decree in 1239 and the chapel built shortly after. It is not known whether the hospital took on the name of St John the Baptist at this time, or whether it had already received that dedication.

In 1245 a study found the brothers distributed bread to the poor annually on Lady Day (25th Martch). By 1344 the hospital was in the patronage of the mayor and burgess of Wycombe.

The hospital continued to run until the Dissolution of the Monasteries in the mid 16th century when all property belonging to the Catholic church was seized by King Henry VIII. Officially the property of the King from that point in history, the hospital struggled to survive and eventually closed in 1548. The last recorded Master was Charles Chalfont, who ran the hospital from 1541 to 1548.

==The school==
In 1550 the buildings of the hospital were acquired by the mayor and burgesses of the town who wished to establish a school. The school took in boys by subscription and trained them in academic studies such as reading, writing, arithmetic and the classics. Most if not all of the boys who attended the school would have then gone on to university, probably at Oxford. In 1562 the school received a Royal charter from Queen Elizabeth. From that point on the school was (and still is) known as the Royal Grammar School.

The school operated in the old hospital until 1883 when funds were found for a new building. This was constructed just to the north of the old hospital, and the ancient building was finally demolished. In 1915 the school was then moved from this location altogether to its current location on Amersham Hill.

==National Monument==
Part of the original hospital building was pulled down in 1767 to make way for the widening of the main road so that it could be established as a turnpike. The south wall of the hall was taken down at this time, and the hall shortened from 15 metres to about 12 metres. At the time of demolition most of the remaining buildings were pulled down, but some parts of the building were left standing. This includes the north wall and five columns of the hall with four arches showing typical 12th century decoration and the north chapel wall with two half lattice windows from the 13th–14th centuries. These ruins still remain today.

At the end of the 19th century the ruins left from the original demolition were strengthened using brick buttresses; in the early 20th century the columns and both walls were given stronger foundations of cement.

In 1993 the ruins were declared an English national monument by English Heritage. Today they are well looked after and are lit up at night making them a local landmark.

<doc id="818487" wikidata="Q2139" url="?curid=818487" title="Moons of Neptune">
<text>The planet Neptune has 16 known moons, which are named for minor water deities and a water creature in Greek mythology. By far the largest of them is Triton, discovered by William Lassell on 10 October 1846, 17 days after the discovery of Neptune itself. Over a century passed before the discovery of the second natural satellite, Nereid, in 1949, and another 40 years passed before Proteus, Neptune&#x27;s second-largest moon, was discovered in 1989.

Triton is unique among moons of planetary mass in that its orbit is retrograde to Neptune&#x27;s rotation and inclined relative to Neptune&#x27;s equator, which suggests that it did not form in orbit around Neptune but was instead gravitationally captured by it. The next-largest satellite in the Solar System suspected to be captured, Saturn&#x27;s moon Phoebe, has only 0.03% of Triton&#x27;s mass. The capture of Triton, probably occurring some time after Neptune formed a satellite system, was a catastrophic event for Neptune&#x27;s original satellites, disrupting their orbits so that they collided to form a rubble disc. Triton is massive enough to have achieved hydrostatic equilibrium and to retain a thin atmosphere capable of forming clouds and hazes.

Inward of Triton are seven small regular satellites, all of which have prograde orbits in planes that lie close to Neptune&#x27;s equatorial plane; some of these orbit among Neptune&#x27;s rings. The largest of them is Proteus. They were re-accreted from the rubble disc generated after Triton&#x27;s capture after the Tritonian orbit became circular. Neptune also has eight more outer irregular satellites other than Triton, including Nereid, whose orbits are much farther from Neptune and at high inclination: three of these have prograde orbits, while the remainder have retrograde orbits. In particular, Nereid has an unusually close and eccentric orbit for an irregular satellite, suggesting that it may have once been a regular satellite that was significantly perturbed to its current position when Triton was captured. Neptune&#x27;s outermost moon S/2021 N 1, which has an orbital period of about 27 Earth years, orbits farther from its planet than any other known moon in the Solar System.

==History==
===Discovery===
Triton was discovered by William Lassell in 1846, just seventeen days after the discovery of Neptune. Nereid was discovered by Gerard P. Kuiper in 1949. The third moon, later named Larissa, was first observed by Harold J. Reitsema, William B. Hubbard, Larry A. Lebofsky and David J. Tholen on 24 May 1981. The astronomers were observing a star&#x27;s close approach to Neptune, looking for rings similar to those discovered around Uranus four years earlier. If rings were present, the star&#x27;s luminosity would decrease slightly just before the planet&#x27;s closest approach. The star&#x27;s luminosity dipped only for several seconds, which meant that it was due to a moon rather than a ring.

No further moons were found until &quot;Voyager 2&quot; flew by Neptune in 1989. &quot;Voyager 2&quot; rediscovered Larissa and discovered five inner moons: Naiad, Thalassa, Despina, Galatea and Proteus. In 2001, two surveys using large ground-based telescopes found five additional outer irregular moons, bringing the total to thirteen. Follow-up surveys by two teams in 2002 and 2003 respectively re-observed all five of these moons, which are Halimede, Sao, Psamathe, Laomedeia, and Neso. The 2002 survey also found a sixth moon, but it could not be re-observed enough times to determine its orbit, and it thus became lost.

In 2013 Mark R. Showalter discovered Hippocamp while examining Hubble Space Telescope images of Neptune&#x27;s ring arcs from 2009. He used a technique similar to panning to compensate for orbital motion and allow stacking of multiple images to bring out faint details. After deciding on a whim to expand the search area to radii well beyond the rings, he found an unambiguous dot that represented the new moon. He then found it repeatedly in other archival HST images going back to 2004. &quot;Voyager 2&quot;, which had observed all of Neptune&#x27;s other inner satellites, did not detect it during its 1989 flyby, due to its dimness.

In 2021, Scott S. Sheppard and colleagues used the Subaru Telescope at Mauna Kea, Hawaii and discovered two more irregular moons of Neptune, which were announced in 2024. These two moons are provisionally designated S/2021 N 1 and S/2002 N 5. The latter turned out to be a recovery of the lost moon from 2002.

===Names===

Triton did not have an official name until the twentieth century. The name &quot;Triton&quot; was suggested by Camille Flammarion in his 1880 book &quot;Astronomie Populaire&quot;, but it did not come into common use until at least the 1930s. Until this time it was usually simply known as &quot;the satellite of Neptune&quot;. Other moons of Neptune are also named for Greek and Roman water gods, in keeping with Neptune&#x27;s position as god of the sea: either from Greek mythology, usually children of Poseidon, the Greek equivalent of Neptune (Triton, Proteus, Despina, Thalassa); lovers of Poseidon (Larissa); other mythological creatures related to Poseidon (Hippocamp); classes of minor Greek water deities (Naiad, Nereid); or specific Nereids (Halimede, Galatea, Neso, Sao, Laomedeia, Psamathe).

For the &quot;normal&quot; irregular satellites, the general convention is to use names ending in &quot;a&quot; for prograde satellites, names ending in &quot;e&quot; for retrograde satellites, and names ending in &quot;o&quot; for exceptionally inclined satellites, exactly like the convention for the moons of Jupiter. Two asteroids share the same names as moons of Neptune: 74 Galatea and 1162 Larissa.

==Characteristics==
The moons of Neptune can be divided into two groups: regular and irregular. The first group includes the seven inner moons, which follow circular prograde orbits lying in the equatorial plane of Neptune. The second group consists of all nine other moons including Triton. They generally follow inclined eccentric and often retrograde orbits far from Neptune; the only exception is Triton, which orbits close to the planet following a circular orbit, though retrograde and inclined.

===Regular moons===
In order of distance from Neptune, the regular moons are Naiad, Thalassa, Despina, Galatea, Larissa, Hippocamp, and Proteus. All but the outer two are within Neptune-synchronous orbit (Neptune&#x27;s rotational period is 0.6713 day or 16 hours) and thus are being tidally decelerated. Naiad, the closest regular moon, is also the second smallest among the inner moons (following the discovery of Hippocamp), whereas Proteus is the largest regular moon and the second largest moon of Neptune. The first five moons orbit much faster than Neptune&#x27;s rotation itself ranging from 7 hours for Naiad and Thalassa, to 13 hours for Larissa.

The inner moons are closely associated with Neptune&#x27;s rings. The two innermost satellites, Naiad and Thalassa, orbit between the Galle and LeVerrier rings. Despina may be a shepherd moon of the LeVerrier ring, because its orbit lies just inside this ring. The next moon, Galatea, orbits just inside the most prominent of Neptune&#x27;s rings, the Adams ring. This ring is very narrow, with a width not exceeding 50 km, and has five embedded bright arcs. The gravity of Galatea helps confine the ring particles within a limited region in the radial direction, maintaining the narrow ring. Various resonances between the ring particles and Galatea may also have a role in maintaining the arcs.

Only the two largest regular moons have been imaged with a resolution sufficient to discern their shapes and surface features. Larissa, about 200 km in diameter, is elongated. Proteus is not significantly elongated, but not fully spherical either: it resembles an irregular polyhedron, with several flat or slightly concave facets 150 to 250 km in diameter. At about 400 km in diameter, it is larger than the Saturnian moon Mimas, which is fully ellipsoidal. This difference may be due to a past collisional disruption of Proteus. The surface of Proteus is heavily cratered and shows a number of linear features. Its largest crater, Pharos, is more than 150 km in diameter.

All of Neptune&#x27;s inner moons are dark objects: their geometric albedo ranges from 7 to 10%. Their spectra indicate that they are made from water ice contaminated by some very dark material, probably complex organic compounds. In this respect, the inner Neptunian moons are similar to the inner Uranian moons.

===Irregular moons===
In order of their distance from the planet, the irregular moons are Triton, Nereid, Halimede, Sao, S/2002 N 5, Laomedeia, Psamathe, Neso, and S/2021 N 1, a group that includes both prograde and retrograde objects. The seven outermost moons are similar to the irregular moons of other giant planets, and are thought to have been gravitationally captured by Neptune, unlike the regular satellites, which probably formed &quot;in situ&quot;.

Triton and Nereid are unusual irregular satellites and are thus treated separately from the other seven irregular Neptunian moons, which are more like the outer irregular satellites of the other outer planets. Firstly, they are the largest two known irregular moons in the Solar System, with Triton being almost an order of magnitude larger than all other known irregular moons. Secondly, they both have atypically small semi-major axes, with Triton&#x27;s being over an order of magnitude smaller than those of all other known irregular moons. Thirdly, they both have unusual orbital eccentricities: Nereid has one of the most eccentric orbits of any known irregular satellite, and Triton&#x27;s orbit is a nearly perfect circle. Finally, Nereid also has the lowest inclination of any known irregular satellite.

====Triton====

Triton follows a retrograde and quasi-circular orbit, and is thought to be a gravitationally captured satellite. It was the second moon in the Solar System that was discovered to have a substantial atmosphere, which is primarily nitrogen with small amounts of methane and carbon monoxide. The pressure on Triton&#x27;s surface is about 14 μbar. In 1989 the &quot;Voyager 2&quot; spacecraft observed what appeared to be clouds and hazes in this thin atmosphere. Triton is one of the coldest bodies in the Solar System, with a surface temperature of about . Its surface is covered by nitrogen, methane, carbon dioxide and water ices and has a high geometric albedo of more than 70%. The Bond albedo is even higher, reaching up to 90%. Surface features include the large southern polar cap, older cratered planes cross-cut by graben and scarps, as well as youthful features probably formed by endogenic processes like cryovolcanism. &quot;Voyager 2&quot; observations revealed a number of active geysers within the polar cap heated by the Sun, which eject plumes to the height of up to 8 km. Triton has a relatively high density of about 2 g/cm3 indicating that rocks constitute about two thirds of its mass, and ices (mainly water ice) the remaining one third. There may be a layer of liquid water deep inside Triton, forming a subterranean ocean. Because of its retrograde orbit and relative proximity to Neptune (closer than the Moon is to Earth), tidal deceleration is causing Triton to spiral inward, which will lead to its destruction in about 3.6 billion years.

====Nereid====

Nereid is the third-largest moon of Neptune. It has a prograde but very eccentric orbit and is believed to be a former regular satellite that was scattered to its current orbit through gravitational interactions during Triton&#x27;s capture. Water ice has been spectroscopically detected on its surface. Early measurements of Nereid showed large, irregular variations in its visible magnitude, which were speculated to be caused by forced precession or chaotic rotation combined with an elongated shape and bright or dark spots on the surface. This was disproved in 2016, when observations from the Kepler space telescope showed only minor variations. Thermal modeling based on infrared observations from the Spitzer and Herschel space telescopes suggest that Nereid is only moderately elongated which disfavours forced precession of the rotation. The thermal model also indicates that the surface roughness of Nereid is very high, likely similar to the Saturnian moon Hyperion.

Nereid dominates the normal irregular satellites of Neptune, having about 98% of the mass of Neptune&#x27;s entire irregular satellite system altogether (if Triton is not counted). This is similar to the situation of Phoebe at Saturn. If it is counted as a normal irregular satellite (but not Triton), then Nereid is also by far the largest normal irregular satellite known, having about two-thirds the mass of all normal irregular moons combined.

====Normal irregular moons====
Among the remaining irregular moons, Sao, S/2002 N 5, and Laomedeia follow prograde orbits, whereas Halimede, Psamathe, Neso and S/2021 N 1 follow retrograde orbits. There are at least two groups of moons that share similar orbits, with the prograde moons Sao, S/2002 N 5, and Laomedeia belonging to the Sao group and the retrograde moons Psamathe, Neso, and S/2021 N 1 belonging to the Neso group. The moons of the Neso group have the largest orbits of any natural satellites discovered in the Solar System to date, with average orbital distances over 125 times the distance between Earth and the Moon and orbital periods over 25 years. Neptune has the largest Hill sphere in the Solar System, owing primarily to its large distance from the Sun; this allows it to retain control of such distant moons. Nevertheless, the Jovian moons in the Carme and Pasiphae groups orbit at a greater percentage of their primary&#x27;s Hill radius than the Neso group moons.

==Formation==
The mass distribution of the Neptunian moons is the most lopsided of the satellite systems of the giant planets in the Solar System. One moon, Triton, makes up nearly all of the mass of the system, with all other moons together comprising only one third of one percent. This is similar to the moon system of Saturn, where Titan makes up more than 95% of the total mass, but is different from the more balanced systems of Jupiter and Uranus. The reason for the lopsidedness of the present Neptunian system is that Triton was captured well after the formation of Neptune&#x27;s original satellite system, and experts conjecture much of the system was destroyed in the process of capture.
Triton&#x27;s orbit upon capture would have been highly eccentric, and would have caused chaotic perturbations in the orbits of the original inner Neptunian satellites, causing them to collide and reduce to a disc of rubble. This means it is likely that Neptune&#x27;s present inner satellites are not the original bodies that formed with Neptune. Only after Triton&#x27;s orbit became circularised could some of the rubble re-accrete into the present-day regular moons.

The mechanism of Triton&#x27;s capture has been the subject of several theories over the years. One of them postulates that Triton was captured in a three-body encounter. In this scenario, Triton is the surviving member of a binary Kuiper belt object disrupted by its encounter with Neptune.

Numerical simulations show that there is a 0.41 probability that the moon Halimede collided with Nereid at some time in the past. Although it is not known whether any collision has taken place, both moons appear to have similar (&quot;grey&quot;) colors, implying that Halimede could be a fragment of Nereid.
==List==
The Neptunian moons are listed here by orbital period, from shortest to longest. Irregular (captured) moons are marked by color. The orbits and mean distances of the irregular moons are variable over short timescales due to frequent planetary and solar perturbations, therefore the listed orbital elements of all irregular moons are averaged over a 30,000-year period: these may differ from osculating orbital elements provided by other sources. Their orbital elements are all based on the epoch of 1 January 2020. Triton, the only Neptunian moon massive enough for its surface to have collapsed into a spheroid, is emboldened.

<text>Michaela Schaffrath (&#x27;Jänke; born 6 December 1970) is a German television actress and former pornographic actress. 

A former nurse, she got started in the adult film industry after she posed nude for &quot;Coupé&quot;, a German adult magazine. She gained international attention during her career as a pornographic actress under the stage name Gina Wild. She won two Venus Awards, for Best New Starlet in 1999 and Best German Actress in 2000.

In 2000, Schaffrath retired from pornography and moved into mainstream acting, and has since appeared in numerous German television series, such as &quot;TV total&quot;, &quot;In aller Freundschaft&quot;, and &quot;Wer wird Millionär?&quot;. In 2005, she put the rights to her stage name and the brand &#x27;Gina Wild&#x27; up for sale, in an attempt to shed her porn star past. 

She is managed by her former husband, and as of 2009, lived in both Frankfurt and Hamburg.

<text>Bob Lanier Middle School, formerly Sidney Lanier Junior High School/Middle School, is a middle school (lower secondary school) in Houston, Texas, United States, with a ZIP code of 77098. Lanier, a school of the Houston Independent School District (HISD), handles grades 6 through 8. Named after former mayor of Houston Bob Lanier, the school is located in Neartown and near Montrose and has both neighborhood non-magnet and Vanguard/IBMYP (of the International Baccalaureate) gifted/talented programs. Lanier&#x27;s neighborhood program serves Montrose, Afton Oaks, Boulevard Oaks, River Oaks, Southampton, and other communities.

==History==

The school was originally going to be designated Abraham Lincoln School, but after criticism from veterans of the U.S. Civil War who fought for the Confederate States of America, the name was changed before opening to Sidney Lanier, a Confederate soldier who later became recognized as the &quot;Poet of the Confederacy&quot;. As of 2014, there were at least ten high schools named after Lanier. Lanier opened in 1926 as one of HISD&#x27;s first junior high schools. In 1926, the Purple Pup was adopted as Lanier&#x27;s mascot.

In 1935, students from Lanier created a petition to rename Woodhead Street, named after John Woodhead, to Higginbotham Street, after the principal, Blanch Higginbotham. According to the article &quot;Historic Houston Streets: The Stories Behind the Name,&quot; students at other schools used &quot;Wood head&quot; as a derogatory label for Lanier students, implying that they lacked intelligence. After hearing testimony about Woodhead&#x27;s character, the Houston City Council decided to keep the previous street name. The students apologized to E. S. Woodhead, John Woodhead&#x27;s brother and a Houstonian. Lanier was previously reserved for white children but it desegregated by 1970.

In 1973, Lanier&#x27;s Vanguard program was instated. Lanier received a re-dedication after renovations in 1982.

In September 1991 Lanier was one of 32 HISD schools that had capped enrollments; in other words, the school was filled and excess students had to attend other schools.

Lanier&#x27;s first floor flooded in 1998 due to Tropical Storm Frances. In the early 2000s (decade), to reduce echo in the classrooms and to allow easier installation of network hardware, a false ceiling was installed in almost all classrooms and hallways. Sometime after 2001, televisions that were in every classroom were removed.

Before the 2008/2009 school year, Lanier had a third temporary building that housed bathrooms and water fountains, though only one water fountain out of three was operational as of 2005. At the start of this school year, the building housing the bathrooms was removed, and the other two temporary buildings were moved from the field to other parts of the campus.

Lanier was renovated during the 2008/2009 school year, with a new paint job, new interior signage, and new walkways to the new locations of the temporary buildings.

Dr. Katie Bradarich became principal in July 2017. She was abruptly reassigned on November 28, 2018, according to a voice message received by the parents of the students.

===2016 Renaming===
On February 12, 2016, the HISD board voted to require Lanier to change its name again to purge HISD of school names based on Confederate figures, even though Lanier&#x27;s students approved of keeping the school&#x27;s name. Former teacher Jim Henley stated that Lanier was known as a creative artist and that he was not known as a Confederate soldier. Mike Tolson of the &quot;Houston Chronicle&quot; wrote that since Lanier had only a small number of works, he &quot;is not studied much these days[...]and students who are not from his native Georgia are unlikely even to know his name.&quot; Tolson argued that &quot;For the majority-minority board, [Lanier] was low-hanging fruit, along with other men who actually served the Confederate cause in a more serious way and are not studied in classes on American poetry.&quot;

In May 2016 the HISD board voted to rename the school after Bob Lanier, former mayor of Houston. &quot;Lanier Watchdogs&quot;, a group of Lanier parents, accused the HISD board of omitting the cost of renaming the school; this group hired Wayne Dolcefino to assist in their investigation.

In April 2016 a group of parents asked HISD board member Jolanda Jones to apologize to students who opposed the name change after she accused them of bullying other students in favor of the name change during a board meeting. Dolcefino investigated the issue and found no evidence of bullying. Jones refused to apologize despite the apparent discredit of her claims.

In May 2016 a group of residents threatened to sue HISD if it followed through with renaming Lanier. In June 2016 a group of eight Houston area residents, including alumni and parents, had given HISD a second request; when HISD did not accept it, they sued HISD to get an injunction to prevent the name changes. Dolcefino serves as their spokesperson.

Columnist John Nova Lomax argued against the renaming in &quot;Texas Monthly&quot; because Bob Lanier had a mixed political legacy.

==Admissions and neighborhoods served==
Students zoned to Lanier automatically are eligible to attend the school, and are automatically able to attend the Vanguard program if they qualify. Several areas of Houston inside the 610 Loop are zoned to Lanier, including Afton Oaks, River Oaks, Boulevard Oaks, Avalon Place, Southampton Place (including Broadacres,), Shadyside, portions of the Neartown area west of Montrose Boulevard (including portions of Montrose west of Montrose Boulevard, Castle Court, Cherryhurst and Cherryhurst Addition, Lancaster Place, Mandell Place, Park, Richwood, Vermont Commons, and WAMM, as well as much of Hyde Park, and portions of North Montrose), Weslayan Plaza, Oak Estates, Royden Oaks, Ranch Estates, Highland Village, Lynn Park, West Lane Place, Rice Village, and most of Upper Kirby (areas of the district located west of Edloe and north of Westpark, residential areas located east of Edloe, west of Kirby, north of U.S. Route 59, and areas located east of Kirby).

Notable apartment and condominium complexes zoned to Lanier include 2727 Kirby, The Driscoll at River Oaks, The Huntingdon, and Residences at La Colombe d&#x27;Or.

For non-zoned students to attend Lanier, parents must submit Vanguard magnet application forms. Admissions from this point on are drawn randomly on a lottery-basis. 256 students are drawn each year. Students beyond this are put on a wait-list.

==Academics==
In the 1995–1996 school year, 82% of black students and 70% of Hispanic students at Lanier passed state tests. 98% of White students had passed the same tests. Tom Monaghan, the principal, said &quot;If you looked at the big picture, we looked pretty good. But we said, &#x27;That&#x27;s not good enough. We have to look at the zoned kids.&#x27;&quot;

The school added an extra teacher for mathematics remediation for 8th graders, established new instructional strategies for language arts, added additional mathematics instruction for 7th graders in need of help in mathematics content, and created after-school reading and writing groups for Latino students. In the 2000–2001 school year, after the measures were taken, 89% of black students and 86% of Hispanic students passed state tests.

As of 2011 Lanier had received Texas Gold Performance Awards based on performance in language arts, mathematics, reading, science, social studies, and writing.

Languages: Spanish, French, Mandarin Chinese.

==Location and campus==
The campus consists of a three-story main building, a separate building (containing a band and a drama room), and 2 temporary buildings (for the health room). Lanier has an indoor pool located in the basement of the main building. Lanier also has an auditorium with a wraparound balcony located in the center of the campus between the South and North Patios, the latter officially named the &quot;Tom Hutch-Hutchings Memorial Gardens&quot; in honor of a longtime Lanier World Cultural Studies teacher. There is also a Chess Patio where one can play chess located next to the cafeteria. Lunch may be eaten on the South (also known as Purple) or Chess Patio, in addition to the cafeteria.

In the main building, the first and second floors have 6th and 7th grade classes. The third floor has 8th grade, core classes, and electives.

Lanier&#x27;s campus has been expanded numerous times since it was first built. The most notable expansion was the addition of the area of the building housing the cafeteria and gymnasium. This expansion has resulted in some quirks in the building that are still visible today, most notably a door leading to stairs to the basement that is only half-exposed above the floor of the hallway. These stairs are no longer in service, though the door can be opened even though it&#x27;s blocked by the hallway floor. Students aren&#x27;t allowed to open the door and/or go down those stairs. Prior to this expansion, the cafeteria was located where the library is today, on the third floor. A dumbwaiter, located where the elevator is today, carried food to the cafeteria.(:

The windows at Lanier were upgraded at some point. Originally, they were 4-panel window panes that could each be opened. They were upgraded to standard slide-open windows. Possibly at this point, for currently unknown reasons, many of the windowsills in the back side of the school were bricked up.

&quot;The Pipe of Peace&quot;, a mural by the artist Grace Spaulding John, was originally located in the front of the school before being painted over. It was repainted in the summer of 2015, in its original place, in the front of the school. In addition to &quot;The Pipe of Peace&quot; there was a mural of the story of King Arthur on the third floor, and a mural of half black and white painting of the school from 1926 and the a color version of the school in the early 1990s to 2000s. Both of the latter Murals have been painted over.

Lanier is located in Winlow Place blocks 2 and 5, in the Neartown community. Lanier is nearby single-family houses and small shops. A convenience store, a hardware store, and a few restaurants are near Lanier Middle School.

The Upper Kirby district, which is near Lanier, plans to establish a &quot;teen center&quot; at Richmond at Wake Forest geared toward students at Lanier, St. John&#x27;s, Lamar, and other Upper Kirby schools and schools near Upper Kirby. Funding issues have delayed establishment of the center.

==School uniform==
All Lanier students are required to wear school uniforms consisting of monogrammed LMS polo shirts in colors of red, black, or white monday thru thursday, and late in the 2013 school year (around May) purple shirts were brought back. They had not been available for about 10 years. The polo shirts purchased at the school and pairs of khaki bottoms (trousers, shorts, capris, or skirts). GSG leaders wear maroon and green shirts. This uniform was instituted at the start of the 1997/1998 school year. The school also provides used uniforms for students who may not be able to afford them.

The Texas Education Agency specifies that the parents and/or guardians of students zoned to a school with uniforms may apply for a waiver to opt out of the uniform policy so their children do not have to wear the uniform; parents must specify &quot;bona fide&quot; reasons, such as religious reasons or philosophical objections.

== Student discipline ==
The school enacted attendance policies meant to maintain a high level of student attendance, and the school threatens to criminally prosecute parents of students consistently committing truancy. The school had received awards for having high student attendance rates.

==Student body==
During the 2016/2017 school year, Lanier had 1,469 students.

24% qualified for free or reduced lunch.

<text>A mitrailleuse (; from French &quot;mitraille&quot;, &quot;grapeshot&quot;) is a type of volley gun with barrels of rifle calibre that can fire either all rounds at once or in rapid succession. The earliest true mitrailleuse was invented in 1851 by Belgian Army captain Fafschamps, ten years before the advent of the Gatling gun. It was followed by the Belgian Montigny mitrailleuse in 1863. Then the French 25 barrel &quot;Canon à Balles&quot;, better known as the Reffye &quot;mitrailleuse&quot;, was adopted in great secrecy in 1866. It became the first rapid-firing weapon deployed as standard equipment by any army in a major conflict when it was used during the Franco-Prussian War of 1870–71.

A steel block containing twenty-five 13 mm (.51 calibre) centre-fire cartridges was locked against the breech before firing. With the rotation of a crank, the 25 rounds were discharged in rapid succession. The sustainable firing rate of the Reffye mitrailleuse was 100 rounds per minute and its maximum range was about 2000 yards (1800 m), a distance that placed their batteries beyond the reach of Prussian Dreyse needle rifle fire. Reffye mitrailleuses were deployed in six-gun batteries and were manned by gunners as a form of special artillery.

Although innovative and capable of good ballistic performance, the Reffye &quot;mitrailleuse&quot; was a tactical failure because its basic concept and operational use were flawed. Only 210 Reffye mitrailleuses were in existence at the beginning of the Franco-Prussian War in 1870. Their field use was discontinued by the French Army after 1871. After the Gatling gun was replaced in service by newer recoil- or gas-operated weapons, multi-barrelled weapons fell into disuse for many decades. Some examples were developed during the interwar years but only as prototypes or were rarely used. The word &quot;mitrailleuse&quot; became the generic term for a machine gun in the French language because of its early appearance in the field of weapons, although the &quot;mitrailleuse&quot; was manually operated.

==Origin==

The first &quot;mitrailleuse&quot; was a manually fired 50-barrel volley gun. It was developed in Belgium in 1851 by Belgian Army Captain Fafschamps, who made a rough prototype and drawings of his invention. The system was improved during the 1850s by Louis Christophe and the Belgian engineer Joseph Montigny, with the completion of the 37-barrel Montigny mitrailleuse in 1863. From 1859, Joseph Montigny proposed his design to Napoleon III, which led to the development of the French Reffye mitrailleuse, which was designed by Jean-Baptiste Verchère de Reffye in collaboration with Montigny, and which was adopted by the French Army in 1865. Initially kept under wraps as a secret weapon, it was widely used in battle by French artillery during the Franco-Prussian War (1870–71). Smaller numbers of other designs, including the Gatling gun, were also purchased by the French government during the latter part of that conflict. The Reffye model had initially been built in small numbers and in secrecy: only about 200 were available at the beginning of the conflict. This also kept regular French field artillery in a neglected position in the eyes of French emperor Napoleon III, with dire consequences during the Franco-Prussian War of 1870–71.

==Technical characteristics==
===Design===
Several variants of the mitrailleuse concept were developed, with common elements to all of their designs. They were characterized by a number of rifled barrels clustered together and mounted on a conventional artillery chassis or (in the case of one model) a tripod. The ammunition was secured in a single block and placed into the breech, behind the open ends of the barrels. All of the barrels were loaded simultaneously by a manual closing lever or large horizontal screw. A second lever could be worked rapidly (or in some models, a crank could be turned) to fire each barrel in succession. This earned the weapon its French nickname of &quot;moulin à café&quot; (coffee grinder). (A very similar name was earned by the hand-cranked, mechanically loaded, continuous-firing, &quot;coffee mill gun&quot; in America during the American Civil War.)

The ammunition plate or block had to be removed by hand before another loaded plate could be inserted. Unlike in the Gatling gun and later rapid-firing automatic weapons, the entire loading and firing process was manual. The mitrailleuse&#x27;s major innovation was that it greatly increased the speed of these processes when compared to standard infantry rifles of the era.

The different variants of the mitrailleuse concept were distinguished by their number of barrels and their different calibers, as the following table summarizes.

Most variants of the mitrailleuse were mounted on an artillery-style carriage. This made them heavy and cumbersome to handle on the battlefield, with gun and carriage weighing up to 900 kg (2,000 lb).

===Ammunition and firing rates===
The mitrailleuse&#x27;s dependence on manual loading meant that its firing rate depended greatly on the skill of its operators. A skillfully manned Reffye mitrailleuse could sustain four volleys (100 rounds) per minute in ordinary operation and reach five volleys (125 rounds) per minute during emergencies. The rapidity of discharge of each individual volley (25 rounds) was controlled by the gunner&#x27;s action on a small manual crank on the right side of the breech. The weapon&#x27;s 25 barrels were not discharged all at once, but in rapid succession. Because it was so heavy (1,500 lbs), the Reffye mitrailleuse did not recoil during firing and thus did not need to be re-sighted on its target after each volley. This essential absence of recoil during firings was promoted by Reffye as a considerable advantage over conventional field artillery. Each regular battery of Reffye mitrailleuses lined up six guns firing together, more or less side by side.

The Reffye mitrailleuse used a 13 mm (.512 inch) centerfire cartridge, designed by Gaupillat, which represented the state of the art in ammunition design at the time. It was rather similar to an elongated modern shotgun shell: centerfire with a rimmed brass head and a dark blue hardened cardboard body. The , 13 mm (0.512 inch) patched bullet was propelled by 185 grains (12 grams) of compressed black powder at a muzzle velocity of , three and a half times more powerful than Chassepot or Dreyse rifle ammunition. This was, by far, the most potent rifle caliber ammunition in existence at the time. The Montigny and Reffye mitrailleuse systems were not designed to function with paper cartridges such as the 11 mm Chassepot combustible paper cartridge.

The 13 mm centerfire Reffye mitrailleuse cartridges were loaded into interchangeable steel breech blocks, unlike the Montigny mitrailleuse, whose ammunition was held by the cartridge base in plates. When firing the mitrailleuse, three breech blocks were kept in continuous use: one being fired, one being pressed down on the extractor and one being loaded from a single pre-packaged 25-round box. Adjusting the elevation of the mitrailleuse in accordance to the distance to the designated target was performed with an elevating screw identical to that on a regular artillery piece. The mitrailleuse&#x27;s barrel could also be moved sideways while firing, to the right and left, in order to adjust for range and provide lateral sweeping fire if needed. The lateral sweep was narrow, however, thus most effective at far distances only. The weapon&#x27;s field of fire was so narrow that Prussian soldiers were often hit by several bullets at once. During an early engagement of the Franco-Prussian War, at Forbach in Alsace on August 6, 1870, a Prussian general officer (General Bruno von François) was brought down by a very closely spaced volley of four bullets. According to the Prussian regimental record, those four mitrailleuse bullets had been fired from 600 meters away. French artillery attempted to rectify this problem by developing special ammunition capable of firing three bullets from the same cartridge for short-range point-defence.

In summary, the Reffye mitrailleuse was rarely used to deliver sweeping fire at close range like modern machine guns. The mitrailleuse six-gun batteries had been designed to deliver fire on targets too distant to be reached with Chassepot infantry rifles or artillery grapeshot. To fulfill this role, at least during the early weeks of the campaign, the mitrailleuses were deployed together with the older &quot;Napoleon&quot; muzzle loaded field guns (&quot;canon obusier de 12&quot;) used by the French Army during the Franco-Prussian War. The mitrailleuse crews are on record of having generally objected to being placed in proximity to regular artillery batteries.

==Development==
The mitrailleuse is best known for its service with the French Army but in fact it was first used in Belgium in the 1850s as a static weapon to defend the moats of fortresses. It was a 50-barrel needle fire, paper cartridge weapon which had been designed by a Captain T.H.J. Fafschamps. Then, after 1863, it was improved with only 37 barrels, 11×70mmR centerfire ammunition and the weapon&#x27;s placement on a wheeled artillery carriage. This transformation was carried out as an industrial venture by Christophe and Joseph Montigny of Fontaine-l&#x27;Évêque near Brussels, who sought to sell the new weapon to the rest of Europe.

The French military became interested in the Christophe and Montigny mitrailleuse in 1863 and the French Army&#x27;s Artillery Committee undertook an investigation into the possible adoption of the Belgian weapon. However it was decided to do otherwise and to create a proprietary mitrailleuse weapon by sole French industrial means. In May 1864, General Edmond Le Bœuf submitted a preliminary report entitled &quot;Note sur le Canon à balles&quot; to the Emperor Napoleon III. Full-scale manufacture began in September 1865, in great secrecy, under the leadership of Lieutenant-Colonel Verchère de Reffye (1821–1880). Assembly and some manufacturing took place at the workshops in Meudon but many parts came from the private industrial sector. Production was slow due to limited funding (the army had already spent much of its five-year budget on the Mle 1866 Chassepot rifle), forcing Napoleon III to pay for development and manufacture out of secret funds. The new weapon was thoroughly tested in 1868 at the military firing range at Satory, near Versailles, in conditions of great secrecy. Due to a fear of spies, test guns were concealed in tents while being fired at distant targets. The mitrailleuse performed mechanically with remarkable efficiency and much was expected of it in a combat situation.

A total of 215 mitrailleuses and five million rounds of ammunition had been manufactured by July 1870, but only 190 were operational and available for field service when war with Prussia broke out.

==Operational doctrine==

The French Army used the mitrailleuse as an artillery weapon, rather than an infantry support weapon—a role later filled by the machine gun. As a matter of fact, the official name of the Reffye mitrailleuse in the French Army was &quot;le Canon à Balles&quot;, a designation that translates literally as: &quot;cannon that fires bullets&quot;:

Having been developed by the artillery they were, naturally, manned by artillerymen and attached to artillery groups equipped with regular four-pounder field guns. Each mitrailleuse battery comprised six guns, each with a crew of six. One man on the front right fired the gun while another man on the front left swiveled the gun sideways for sweeping fire. The four other men attended to aiming, loading, and unloading. Auguste Verchère de Reffye himself consistently viewed the mitrailleuse as an artillery weapon:

The battlefield use of the mitrailleuse as artillery was a fatally flawed concept. To avoid being hit by Dreyse rifle fire, the mitrailleuse batteries were systematically deployed beyond about 1,400 m (1,500 yards) from the Prussian lines. Although the maximum range of the mitrailleuses was 3,400 m (3,700 yards), the distances at which they were typically engaged rarely exceeded 2,000 m (2100 yards) which was less than the reach of French field artillery. However accurate fire at 1500 yards was always extremely difficult to achieve with the typical open sights present on the mitrailleuse. For instance, mitrailleuse bullet impacts on the ground could not be observed in the far distance unless enemy ranks had been disrupted by hits from them. It may be noted that modern machine guns are typically used at ranges far shorter than their maximum range—the M60 machine gun, for instance, is normally used well within its effective range of 1,100 m (1,200 yards), compared to its maximum range of 3,725 m (4,074 yards). The mitrailleuse, by contrast, was often used at the outer edges of its range and without the benefit of optical range finding equipment. These deficiencies in the operational usage of the Reffye mitrailleuse proved disastrous in the Franco-Prussian War.

==Use in war==
===Franco-Prussian War (1870–71)===

Mitrailleuses were used in many of the major engagements of the Franco-Prussian War (1870–71), but their small numbers greatly restricted their effectiveness. Their flawed usage was a serious problem on the battlefield. While the mitrailleuses were inherently accurate, in a ballistic sense, they were often unable to zero in on targets quickly enough at great distances. Individual 25 round salvos were also too tightly grouped and lacked lateral dispersion. To make matters worse, the complex firing mechanism was vulnerable to damage at the hands of inexperienced crews. Fouling of the mechanism by black powder combustion residues and thus difficulties in closing the breech were reported as a problem after prolonged firings.
In a few instances where the Reffye mitrailleuses were put to good use, they showed that they could have a significant impact. Captain Barbe&#x27;s mitrailleuse battery at the Battle of Gravelotte devastated massed Prussian infantry when they had quickly found the range on their targets, contributing to the exceptionally high Prussian death toll in that battle. Other examples of effective mitrailleuse fire have also been described for the battle of Mars-la-Tour. For the most part, however, mitrailleuses proved ineffective. It was concluded after the war that Chassepot rifle fire had caused a far greater number of Prussian casualties than the Reffye mitrailleuses. However, about 100,000 Chassepot rifles were engaged in combat in contrast with fewer than 200 Reffye mitrailleuses used in battle at any given time.

The Prussians and foreign observers were not impressed by the performance of the mitrailleuse. In the case of the Prussians, their views were undoubtedly coloured by propaganda. They had very few machine guns or volley guns of their own and, not least for reasons of maintaining morale in the face of a new weapon technology, they scorned the effectiveness of the mitrailleuse. They nonetheless saw the weapon as a threat and Prussian artillery always made it a priority to engage and destroy mitrailleuse batteries. The weapon&#x27;s characteristic &quot;snarling rasp&quot; does appear to have made some impression—the Prussian troops called the mitrailleuse the &quot;Höllenmaschine&quot; (&quot;Hell/Infernal Machine&quot;)

Its failure to have much effect in the field led to a belief that rapid-fire weapons were useless. United States Army General William Babcock Hazen, who observed the war, commented that &quot;The French mitrailleuse had failed to live up to expectations. The Germans hold it in great contempt, and it will hardly become a permanent military arm.&quot; Strictly speaking, manually operated volley guns such as the Reffye mitrailleuse were a technological dead-end, and they were soon replaced by fully automatic machine guns.

After Napoleon III&#x27;s abdication following the disastrous French defeat in the Battle of Sedan, French war powers fell into the hand of a republican government led by Léon Gambetta. He vigorously organized national defense and the continued manufacture of war equipment. Most of the conventional weapon manufacturing was located in provincial France, but some mitrailleuse repair and even construction continued inside Paris during the city&#x27;s four-month siege.

The manufacture of the mitrailleuse and its ammunition was resumed under the direction of De Reffye in the coastal city of Nantes in western France. An additional 122 mitrailleuses were manufactured in Nantes to replace the nearly 200 mitrailleuses that had already been destroyed or captured.

===After the war===

After the armistice with Prussia in May 1871, one of the last recorded uses of Reffye mitrailleuses was by troops under the command of Adolphe Thiers, when a battery executed captured &quot;Communards&quot; in the Bois de Boulogne, following the suppression of the Paris Commune. Similar incidents involving the Reffye mitrailleuse are reported to have taken place at the Caserne Lobau, a barracks in the center of Paris.

A fairly large number of the French Army&#x27;s Reffye mitrailleuses (268 altogether) survived the Franco-Prussian War. An additional 122 Reffye mitrailleuses, which had been captured during the 1870–71 campaign, were all sold back to France by Germany through a London military surplus dealer in 1875. By 1885, many of the mitrailleuses in the overall remaining French inventory were designated to static point-defence duties, for the purpose of providing flanking fire in the moats of eastern French fortifications. The last surviving Reffye mitrailleuses were removed from several forts in eastern France as late as 1908 and scrapped.

===Other campaigns===
The mitrailleuse is reported to have been used by the Mexican Federal Forces against the Yaqui Indian forces in Sonora, then under the command of Cajemé José Maria Leyba, a prominent leader of that tribe from 1874 to 1887. Three mitrailleuse were used in March, 1886, with two mitrailleuse under the command of the forces of Generals Leiva and Carillo, and one under the command of General Camano.

In September 1926, the Mexican military, at first just under General Miguel Pina, made preparations to use the mitrailleuse against the Yaqui people in Sonora, then led by their military chief Luis Matus (Matius in some later accounts), and his lieutenant, Albin Cochemea. The 1st, 8th, and 18th infantry battalions prepared to bring a more modern state of warfare against the indigenous inhabitants of Vicam and other Yaqui pueblos along the river. By October 5, after intense fighting, the remaining Yaqui soldiers had retreated to the mountains above the river, and the Mexican forces decided to mount a vast offensive against them. More than 12,000 Mexican Federal troops, under the command of General Obregon, General Abundio-Gomez, and General Manzo, directed the operations against the remaining Yaqui forces, using munitions that included 8mm mitrailleuse, and aeroplanes carrying poison gas.

Following their campaign against Arabi Pasha in Egypt during 1882, the British recorded having seized several mitrailleuses. None of these seemed to have been used in combat.

Even the Kingdom of Dahomey had some of these guns.

==Impact on military development==
The long-term effects of the mitrailleuse&#x27;s poor performance have been the subject of some dispute among historians. In &quot;Machine Guns: An Illustrated History&quot;, J. Willbanks argues that the weapon&#x27;s ineffectiveness in the Franco-Prussian War resulted in long-standing opposition among European armies to adopting machine gun weapons, particularly in Continental Europe. It is true that the French Army did not adopt an automatic machine gun until 1897, when they chose the Hotchkiss machine gun, later to be followed by the Hotchkiss M1914 machine gun. The French armed forces also adopted another automatic machine gun, the St. Étienne Mle 1907. It has been suggested that the relative slowness displayed by the French services to adopt machine guns was the result of wariness occasioned by the failure of the mitrailleuse. There is some evidence for that suggestion, as the Maxim gun had repeatedly been tested by the French armed services ever since its inception.

In the immediate aftermath of the war, the French put a much greater emphasis on improving their field artillery. The failure of French artillery during the 1870–71 campaign served as a strong incentive to fast track the De Bange field artillery piece (1877) and eventually the well-known Canon de 75 modèle 1897 field gun. At a normal 15 shells per minute rate of fire, one single 75 mm gun could deliver 4,350 lethal shrapnel balls within one minute, up to 6 km away, versus the 75 bullets per minute that were delivered at up to 2 km distance by one Reffye mitrailleuse. Evidently, weapon system efficiency had increased by two orders of magnitude in 30 years.

Despite such improvements in longer-range artillery, there still remained a need to develop better short- and medium-range infantry support weapons. During the period from 1871 to the 1890s, a variety of new European- and American-designed manual machine guns were adopted by many European armies. Large numbers of Gatling guns were purchased from the United States and were used by Western European powers in colonial wars in Africa, India, and Asia. Twenty-five Gatling guns also saw active service in French hands during the Franco-Prussian war, in early 1871. They performed particularly well at an engagement at Le Mans in western France. Furthermore, the French armed services purchased, for their navy and eastern fortifications, a large number of manual, rapid fire 37 mm multi-barrel guns (so-called Hotchkiss &quot;canon-revolvers&quot;) made in France after 1879 by the firm of American expatriate Benjamin B. Hotchkiss. By the 1890s however, European armies began to retire their Gatling guns and other manual machine guns in favor of fully automatic machine guns, such as the Maxim gun, the Colt–Browning M1895, and, in 1897, the Hotchkiss machine gun. Such weapons became universal—and notorious—with the outbreak of the First World War in 1914.

===Modern uses of the term &quot;mitrailleuse&quot;===
A machine gun is still referred to as a &quot;mitrailleuse&quot; in French, following the pattern set by the adoption of the &quot;Mitrailleuse Hotchkiss&quot; in 1897. The FN 5.56 mm NATO machine gun, the Minimi, derives its name from the term &quot;Mini-Mitrailleuse&quot;, &quot;small machine gun&quot;. Submachine guns may be called &quot;mitraillettes&quot;, the diminutive of &quot;mitrailleuse&quot;, although they are also called &quot;pistolets mitrailleurs&quot; (&quot;mitrailleuse pistols&quot;).

In Dutch as spoken in the Netherlands, the word &quot;mitrailleur&quot; is widely used as a synonym for &quot;machinegeweer&quot; (machine gun). Obviously, this word is derived from the original &quot;mitrailleuse&quot; by changing the gender of the French word. In Dutch-speaking parts of Belgium, however, the word &quot;mitrailleur&quot; is rarely used, largely because it is regarded as poor French.

The term is also used in Norwegian. Although spelled slightly differently as &quot;mitraljøse&quot;, the pronunciation is similar. In Norway, the term nowadays is used to refer to a machine gun (the MG3, labeled as &quot;mitr-3&quot;, to be specific) mounted on a tripod. This is similar to the German term &quot;Schweres Maschinengewehr&quot;, which refers to a regular machine gun mounted on a tripod (since the introduction of General purpose machine guns).

In Turkish the term &quot;mitralyöz&quot;, which is apparently derived from &quot;mitrailleuse&quot;, was widely used as a synonym for machine guns before becoming an archaic term. Currently, &quot;makineli tüfek&quot; (machine rifle) is considered the accepted term.

A related word, &quot;metralhadora&quot;, is used in Portuguese. Although it is derived from the French &quot;mitrailleuse&quot;, its pronunciation is different. It describes any automatic firearm. Similarly, in Spanish &quot;ametralladora&quot; is the word for a machine gun, &quot;metralleta&quot;, connected to French &quot;mitraillette&quot; for a sub-machine gun.

The word also survived in Romania, where the generic term for a machine gun is &quot;mitralieră&quot;. In Slovenian, Croatian and Serbian it is &quot;mitraljez&quot;, and in Albanian a machine gun is referred to as &quot;mitraloz&quot;. In Greek, &quot;mydraliovolo&quot; (μυδραλιοβόλο) is a—now somewhat archaic—term for a machine gun.

The word &quot;mitrailleuse&quot; is surely the source for the modern Italian term: &quot;Mitragliatrice&quot;, describing a machine gun, as well.

<text>The Royal Grammar School, High Wycombe, is a selective boys&#x27; grammar school situated in High Wycombe, Buckinghamshire, England. As a state school, it does not charge fees for pupils to attend, but they must pass the 11 plus, an exam that some primary schools administer. In February 2011, the school became an Academy.

Established by Royal Charter in 1562 (originally established as a school in 1551), it is situated on Amersham Hill to the north of the town and has a capacity of about 1,370 boys aged between 11 and 19, open Monday to Friday from 8:00am to 3:30pm and later for co-curricular activities. The school has boarding facilities and was a DfES-designated Language College until 2010. From 2007-2010, it was also a Mathematics and ICT College. OFSTED gave it a Good ranking in its 2019 inspection.

==History==
Originally established by the mayor and burgesses of the town in 1551, in the ecclesiastical premises previously acquired by Sir Edmund Peckham (c. 1495 – 1564) during the Dissolution of the Monasteries, the school received its Royal charter in 1562 (which still survives today at the school&#x27;s current location). It was based in the buildings of the former Hospital of St John the Baptist in the town centre until 1883. After the old hospital was demolished, the school was moved to new buildings nearby for a short time, and was moved to its current location in 1915.

The school expanded greatly under the headmastership of Edmund Tucker from 1933 to 1964, celebrating the 400th anniversary of its Royal Charter in 1962 with a visit from Queen Elizabeth II. To commemorate the visit, the school&#x27;s main hall became &quot;Queen&#x27;s Hall&quot; and bore an engraving to mark the occasion. In 1997 a new building was erected (the Language Block) entirely dedicated to the teaching of languages, which was opened by the Duchess of Gloucester.

There are several Royal Grammar School sites in the UK, of which High Wycombe, Colchester, Clitheroe and Lancaster have maintained their grammar school status, whilst Guildford, Newcastle upon Tyne and Worcester are now privately funded, private schools.

In 2006, tabloid accusations against then-headmaster Timothy Dingle led to an independent investigation. The school&#x27;s governors concluded that he should be dismissed for &quot;gross misconduct&quot;, but he had already resigned to take the position of head at a private school in Argentina. Dingle did not take up the position.

In 2016, the school made headlines after a question set in a practice maths test by a volunteer (a retired teacher) was deemed homophobic after it stated &quot;marriage is between one man and one woman, as God intended when he made humans male and female&quot;. The school immediately withdrew the practice test when informed of the question by students. Headmaster Philip Wayne apologised &quot;on behalf of the whole school community of governors, staff and boys&quot; and said the volunteer who set the question would not be returning.

==Headmaster==
The current headmaster is Philip Wayne, who was Headmaster of Chesham Grammar School for eight years before joining RGSHW. He succeeded Roy Page in September 2015.

==Entry==
In order to gain entry to the school, pupils from primary schools in the local area are invited to do an entrance exam, the eleven-plus exam. RGS admits 182 day boys each year and 10 boarding boys. Entry for boarding is somewhat different, with the school having extra requirements for applications such as interviews beyond the 11+ exam requirement. Prospective boys who did not take the 11+ (e.g. those who join in later years or those who come from different counties or countries not taking the 11+) also take the school&#x27;s own entry tests, consisting of a test in both their Mathematics and English subject abilities.

==Boarding==
Though primarily a day school, some pupils have boarded at the school since the 1800s. For most of the 20th century, boarders were lodged in one of three boarding houses: School House, a purpose-built residence on the school premises, and Uplyme and Tyler&#x27;s Wood, two converted private houses located near the school. In September 1999 the entire boarding facility was consolidated into the newly built &quot;Fraser Youens Boarding House&quot;. It incorporates en-suite bedrooms, communication technology, three resident Housemasters and a committee of House Tutors. It has room for 70 resident boys, who stay throughout the week and return home for weekends. The house is named after alumni Ian Edward Fraser and Frederick Youens, who were awarded the Victoria Cross during the Second World War and First World War respectively.

==Sixth form==
RGS has a sixth form. Boys from other schools can join the sixth form but need to have achieved eight GCSEs at grades 5–9 with a grade 6 or above in seven of those (including mathematics and English).

===Available subjects===

==Facilities==

A music centre was opened in late 2004, so that the school can offer A Level Music Technology.

There is an on-site Combined Cadet Force. Other activities include the Public Speaking Society, music and orchestras, drama, social service, fencing and other sports. The school has two playing fields. The RGS also has its own .22 25 yard indoor range which is used by the shooting team of the school.

In 2013, planning permission for an All Weather Pitch was granted, and in 2014, work began raising £1m to fund the creation of this 3G floodlit pitch, a new grass pitch, which was completed in April 2016, and to renovate the 100-year-old Main Block classrooms.

==Activities==
=== Stage Lighting and Sound Team ===

In 2019 the Stage Lighting and Sound Team (SLST) could be joined by some boys at or after, Academic Year 9.

===Combined Cadet Force===
The Combined Cadet Force has Navy, Army and RAF sections open for boys in KS4 &amp; 5 (Years 10 and above) where they learn skills such as field-craft, map and compass, drill, leadership and first aid, while also taking part in activities such as weapon handling, sailing and flying.

===Music===
Senior groups have featured at the National Festival of Music for Youth having been the National Youth Choir of the Year in 2014.

=== Gilbert and Sullivan operas ===
In 1947 Bernarr Rainbow directed the first of the Gilbert and Sullivan Savoy operas to be performed at the school. These continued until at least 1976.

===Sport===
Its alumni founded the town&#x27;s local rugby club High Wycombe RFC, originally known as Old Wycombiensians FC. Sporting alumni include golfer Luke Donald, 2003 Rugby World Cup winner Matt Dawson, 1993 Rugby World Cup Sevens winner Nick Beal., 400 metres hurdles athlete Martin Gillingham, England Hockey Captain Jon Wyatt, and the cricketers Phil Newport and Saif Zaib.

===Rowing===
The school has an active rowing club called the Royal Grammar School High Wycombe Boat Club which is based on the River Thames at the Longridge Activity Centre, Quarry Wood Road. The club is affiliated to British Rowing (Boat code HWG) and produced two junior national champion crews at the 2014 British Rowing Junior Championships.

== Notable alumni and teachers ==

Alumni of the RGS are known as Old Wycombiensians, or OWs, and include Chris Grayling, former UK Secretary of State for Transport, the singers Ian Dury and Howard Jones, the comedian Jimmy Carr and the philosopher Roger Scruton. The Old Wycombiensians&#x27; Committee hosts an annual reunion dinner for Old Wycombiensians at the RGS. Notable sporting alumni include former England rugby union player Matt Dawson, Ryder-Cup winning captain golfer Luke Donald and sprinter Martin Gillingham.

T. S. Eliot taught for a term at the school in the autumn of 1915.

==Popular culture==
*In 2001, the school was used as one of the sets in the 2001 thriller film &quot;The Hole&quot;, as a county prison. Various scenes were also filmed inside the school&#x27;s old boarding house.
*In 2003, the school served as the location for two seasons of the television series &quot;That&#x27;ll Teach &#x27;em&quot; for Channel 4. The school was re-branded as &quot;King&#x27;s Grammar School&quot; and took thirty sixteen-year-olds for a summer of 1950s style boarding school education. This first series was nominated for a BAFTA. The second series in 2004 saw thirty sixteen-year-olds of lesser academic achievement experience 1960s style Secondary Modern School education; in this case the school was re-branded &quot;Hope Green Secondary Modern&quot;. However, different parts of the school were used in each series, giving the impression that the school used in the second series was not that used in the first.
*On 1 May 2009 BBC TV show Top Gear recorded at the school. They filmed in the Quadrangle (teacher&#x27;s car park) against the old main building and clock tower for a segment where Jeremy Clarkson, Richard Hammond and James May were undertaking the challenge, Finding the perfect car for 17-year-olds. Clarkson used a Volvo estate, Hammond a Hyundai S-Coupe and May a Volkswagen Golf. The episode was aired in June 2009.
*In 2011 the corridors of the same building appeared in the opening and closing scenes of the BBC Documentary series, &quot;Our War&quot;, in which former history teacher and CCF leader Bjorn Rose talks about the tragic loss of comrade Chris Gray during his service for the British Army in Afghanistan.

<text>The Cold Cash War is a 1977 science fiction novel by Robert Asprin.

The book is an expanded version of the novelette &quot;Cold Cash War&quot;, published in the August 1977 issue of &quot;Analog&quot;. It takes place in a semi-dystopian near-future in which the enormous corporate cartels that have come to dominate the West have begun resolving their disputes with small-scale, nonlethal wars, fought by professional mercenaries.

==Setting==
The novel has been noted as an early example of proto-cyberpunk: capitalism is ascendant (the Communist bloc has severed relations with the West after a ruinous Sino-Soviet war), nation-states are losing relevancy in world affairs to corporations, communications technology is of prime importance, and the West is coming to terms with the rising economic power of Japan. Intercorporate conflicts are normally fought under nonlethal rules of engagement, using &quot;killsuits&quot;—a reverse version of powered armor, which immobilizes the wearer if the on-board computer detects a disabling hit.

==Plot==
Major Stephen Tidwell, a veteran mercenary commander employed by the Communications Combine, finds himself dismissed and blacklisted over a string of inexplicable failures in the field. Tidwell and his friend, Oil Coalition mercenary Michael Clancy, are almost immediately offered an extremely lucrative contract by the Zaibatsu—a conglomerate of major Japanese corporations—who wish to raise a strike force trained to Western standards. Tidwell accepts, and learns that the Japanese have infiltrated Communications and Oil at the highest levels, and were behind his dismissal. Upon his arrival in Japan, he is further astonished by the high standard of the Zaibatsu troops he is to lead, consisting of recruits from ultranationalist groups descended from Yukio Mishima&#x27;s Tatenokai. (The narrative does not specify a date, but it does mention that Mishima&#x27;s suicide occurred &quot;over twenty years ago,&quot; suggesting the early 1990s.)

==Sequel==
Asprin revisited the setting in 1989 with Cold Cash Warrior, an interactive fiction coauthored with Bill Fawcett and using the Combat Command TRPG system. Mainly a tabletop RPG rulebook and scenario, it also contained roughly a novelette&#x27;s worth of prose, constituting a detailed description of a tactical encounter in one of the inter-corporate conflicts of the setting.

<text>Dennis Walsh (12 June 1933 – 1 June 2005) was an English astronomer. He was an early radio astronomer, as well as an optical astronomer. He was best known for his discovery in 1979 of the first example of a gravitational lens, B0957+561, using an optical telescope.

== Personal life ==
He was born into a poor family in Dukinfield, east of Manchester.

He married Pamela Lawton in 1957, with whom he had four sons, named Colin, Timothy, Paul and Brian (the latter three born in the USA). Dr. Walsh taught and also oversaw 16 Ph.D courses for various students, including one who would later go on herself to teach acclaimed British physicist and maker of documentaries, Brian Cox.

In his last years Dr. Walsh suffered from Lewy body disease. He died at home at the age of 71.

== Career ==
He developed an early aptitude for mathematics and physics. He received a scholarship from the University of Manchester, where he received a first class honours degree in Physics at the age of 19. In 1953 he started studying for a PhD from Jodrell Bank, supervised by Robert Hanbury Brown, where he constructed a 92MHz receiver for the Transit Telescope. Working with Cyril Hazard, he used the receiver to carry out a radio source survey, detecting 134 sources. The survey was limited by source confusion, an issue that Dennis and Cyril identified for the first time.

He completed his PhD in 1957. He worked for Ferranti for a short time, before moving to the University of Michigan in 1959 to teach and to research low-frequency radio emission in the ionosphere, for which he used sounding rockets. He returned to the University of Manchester in 1967 in order to work on atmospheric research using the Ariel 3 satellite, and to lead the &quot;survey group&quot;, while supervising PhD students.

He used a wide variety of optical telescopes, having learnt about optical observing using the Isaac Newton Telescope, before being one of the first western astronomers to use the Soviet BTA-6 telescope.

The Jodrell Bank 966MHz survey was led by the survey group at Jodrell Bank. Walsh&#x27;s spectroscopic follow-up of quasars in this survey led to the 1979 discovery of the first example of a gravitational lens, B0957+561, using an optical telescope at the Kitt Peak National Observatory.

Dr. Walsh was a long serving council member of the Royal Astronomical Society, where he held the post of Treasurer from 1988 for eight years. He organised the finances for the International Astronomical Union&#x27;s General Assembly meeting in Manchester in August 2000.

<doc id="818642" wikidata="Q363392" url="?curid=818642" title="Michel Aoun">
<text>Michel Naim Aoun (, ; born 30 September 1933) is a Lebanese politician and former general who served as the 13th president of Lebanon from 31 October 2016 to 30 October 2022.

Born in Haret Hreik to a Maronite Christian family, Aoun joined the Military Academy in 1955 and graduated as an artillery officer in the Lebanese Army. In 1984, he became the youngest Commander of the Army, at the age of 49. On 22 September 1988, during the fourth phase of the Lebanese Civil War, the departing President Amine Gemayel appointed him as the interim Prime Minister of a military government after the parliament failed to elect a new president, and dismissed the current government headed by the Acting Prime Minister Selim Hoss. This controversial decision saw the rise of two rival governments contending for power at that time, with Aoun being supported mainly by Christians and Iraq, while the other being supported by Muslims and Syria.

Aoun declared the War of Liberation against Syrian Army forces on 14 March 1989, opposed the Taif Agreement, refused to recognize the newly elected presidents René Moawad and Elias Hrawi, clashed with the Lebanese Forces led by Samir Geagea, and survived an assassination attempt on 12 October 1990. On 13 October, the Syrian forces launched a decisive operation against Aoun, invading his strongholds including the Presidential Palace in Baabda and killing hundreds of Lebanese soldiers and civilians. Aoun fled to the French Embassy in Beirut where he declared his surrender and was later granted asylum in France where he lived in exile for 15 years.

In exile, Aoun founded the Free Patriotic Movement, and advocated for the Syria Accountability Act by testifying in the US Congress. In 2005, a chain of widespread demonstrations triggered by the assassination of Rafic Hariri erupted in Lebanon, resulted in the withdrawal of Syrian troops from the country. On 7 May, Aoun returned to Lebanon.

Aoun was elected to the Parliament for the first time in the same year, while his party won 21 seats in the parliament, forming the largest Christian bloc, and second biggest bloc in the Parliament. In 2006, he signed a memorandum of understanding with Hezbollah, starting a major alliance that has remained ever since. Despite the bloody history with the regime of Hafez al-Assad, father of Bashar al-Assad, Aoun visited Syria in 2008, ending his long rivalry with Damascus.

In 2016, Aoun reconciled with Geagea after signing the Maarab Agreement, and was endorsed by the Lebanese Forces, Future Movement, Progressive Socialist Party as well as Hezbollah to become the thirteenth President of Lebanon. He is the oldest president, taking office at the age of 83 years. After his election, he was sworn in and succeeded Michel Suleiman.

In 2019, the country descended into chaos with a popular uprising, bringing millions of Lebanese in Lebanon and abroad to take to the streets, mainly caused by the liquidity crisis, political corruption and sectarianism.

==Early years==
With family origins from Haret el Maknouniye, Jezzine, Aoun was born in the mixed Christian-Shiite suburb of Haret Hreik, to the south of Beirut. His father was Naim Aoun who worked as a butcher, while his mother was Marie Aoun, a Lebanese woman who was born in the United States. His family was generally poor.

In 1941, he was forced to leave the house where he was living, as it was occupied by British and Australian forces. He finished his secondary education at the College Des Frères Furn Al Chebbak in 1955 and finished a degree in Maths. He enrolled in the Military Academy as a cadet officer, and graduated as an artillery officer in the Lebanese Army three years later.

==Military career==
After his graduation, Aoun joined the Second Artillery Regiment in 1958, and was sent to France to receive further military training at Châlons-sur-Marne. He finished it the following year, and was promoted to Second Lieutenant on 30 September.

He was serving during the failed coup of the Syrian Social Nationalist Party in 1961, and was decorated for that. He was trained at Fort Sill in Oklahoma, and became the Assistant of The Commander of the Second Artillery Battalion, the Commander of the Command and Service Company and Commander of the Administrative Detachment in 1970.

At the start of the civil war, Aoun was the commander of the Second Artillery Corps of the Army. He took part in the Tel al-Zaatar massacre, claiming that he developed and planned the siege of the camp and its storming. He directed the attack, which resulted in destruction of it, and the Palestinian refugees being displaced. In 1978, he went to France again for more military training at École Supérieure de Guerre.

In 1980, Aoun returned to Lebanon and was appointed later as the interim commander of the mainly Christian 8th Infantry Brigade, that is credited for protecting the Palestinian refugee camp of Borj Al Barajneh from the sinister fate of Sabra and Chatila, and fought against the pro-Syrian Druze and Palestinian militias at the Battle of Souk El Gharb during the Mountain War. During the Israeli invasion, Aoun&#x27;s office was at the Museum Crossing.

He was promoted to General and appointed as the tenth Commander of the Armed Forces on 23 June 1984, succeeding General Ibrahim Tannous. At the age of 49 years, he was the youngest Commander since the establishment of the position.

According to French journalist Alain Ménargues, Aoun had strong relationships with Bachir Gemayel and Israel. He suggested that Aoun proposed to Gemayel signing a mutual recognition agreement between Lebanon and Israel along with a joint defense pact, and was accompanied by Israeli officers in his patrols. He also had a meeting with Israeli Minister of Defence Ariel Sharon.

===Rival governments: 1988===
On 22 September 1988, 15 minutes before the expiration of his term, the outgoing president Amine Gemayel appointed Aoun as Prime Minister, heading a military government to be formed by six members of the Martial Court, three of which are Christian and three are Muslims. He also dismissed the civilian administration of acting Prime Minister Salim al-Huss. The Muslims refused to serve, and submitted their resignations on the next day. Gemayel accuses Syria of forcing them to do so, claiming that they accepted their roles when he contacted them. He also says that he considered forming a cabinet of judges or politicians. Having failed to form a political caretaker government, and feeling that judges &quot;can&#x27;t defend themselves&quot;, he opted for a military cabinet. Indeed, Amine Gemayel had recognized that his own nemesis throughout his presidency, the militia his slain brother Bachir Gemayel had founded, the Lebanese Forces, would also attempt to undermine the authority of a caretaker government. Backed by Syria and its local allies, Al-Hoss declared his dismissal invalid. Two governments emerged, one civilian and mainly Muslim in West Beirut, headed by Hoss as the Acting Prime Minister, the other, military and Christian, in East Beirut, led by Michel Aoun as the Interim Prime Minister. Aoun held the additional portfolio of minister of defense.

Gemayel&#x27;s move was of questionable validity, as it violated the unwritten National Pact of 1943, which reserved the position of prime minister for a Sunni Muslim. Gemayel argued, however, that as the National Pact also reserved the &quot;presidency&quot; for a Maronite Christian, and as the Prime Minister assumes the powers and duties of the President in the event of a vacancy, it would be proper to fill that office temporarily with a Maronite. Gemayel referenced the historical precedent of 1952, when General Fouad Chehab, a Christian Maronite, was appointed as prime minister of a transition government following the resignation of President Bechara El Khoury.

===Liberation war against Syria: 1989===
On 15 February 1989 General Aoun launched an offensive, with those Lebanese Army Brigades loyal to him (30% of whom were Sunni), against Geagea&#x27;s Lebanese Forces (LF) positions around Christian East Beirut. Nine days later, 24 February, with seventy people killed and the intervention of the Maronite Patriarchate the LF agreed to hand over to Aoun control of Beirut&#x27;s port&#x27;s fifth basin with its estimated $300,000 per month tax revenue. Suleiman Frangieh, in the north, also returned control of Ras Salaata port in Batroun District The following month, Aoun launched a blockade against the unregulated seaports south of Beirut at Jieh and Khalde. On 8 March 1989 Aoun&#x27;s patrol boats intercepted a boat heading for PSP controlled port at Jieh. This precipitated a series of indiscriminate artillery barrages, with Amal shelling East Beirut harbour and Jouneh port, and Aoun&#x27;s army brigades shelling Souk El Gharb. On the 12 March, Aoun ordered the closure of Beirut International Airport and two days later launched an hour-long bombardment of East Beirut, which killed 40 civilians.
At the end of the month Aoun announced a ceasefire with the issue of the militia run ports unresolved. The area had seen the worst violence for three years, with over 90 people killed and several hundred wounded.

In October 1989, Lebanese National Assembly members met to draw up the Taif Agreement in an attempt to settle the Lebanese conflict. This accord was later revealed to have been prepared two years earlier by Rafic Hariri. Aoun refused to attend, denounced the politicians who did so as traitors, and issued a decree dissolving the assembly. After the Taif accord was signed over his opposition, Aoun further denounced it for not appointing a date for the withdrawal of the Syrian army from Lebanon. After it signed the Taif Accord (in Taif, Saudi Arabia), the assembly met to elect René Moawad as president in November. Despite heavy-handed pressure from Syria to dismiss Aoun, Moawad relented; his presidency ended 17 days later when he was assassinated. Elias Hrawi was elected in his place. After assuming office as president, Hrawi appointed General Émile Lahoud as commander of the army and ordered Aoun out of the Presidential Palace. Aoun rejected his dismissal.

In February 1990 General Aoun launched an offensive against Samir Geagea&#x27;s Lebanese Forces (LF) in East Beirut. The three months of intermittent fighting caused more destruction of property in the Christian part of Beirut than the previous 15 years of civil war. It ended with the LF remaining in control of East Beirut, the harbour and Kisrawan province. Around 1000 people were killed and both East and West Beirut left without electricity and badly damaged water supply.

The Gulf War had its repercussions on Aoun&#x27;s government. Aoun had asked for help and the only unconditional help he received was from Saddam Hussein, who until 1989 was an ally of the West. On 2 August 1990, Hussein launched his invasion of Kuwait and the US established a coalition against Iraq to liberate Kuwait. President Hafez al-Assad of Syria sided with the coalition, a choice rewarded with a &quot;green light&quot; to crush Aoun&#x27;s revolt. On 12 October 1990, Aoun survived an assassination attempt as he was addressing his supporters from his balcony. The assailant was identified as Lebanese Communist Party member, Francois Halal, emerged from the crowd wielding a pistol and shooting twice but missed him. Minutes later he continued his speech. On 13 October Syrian forces attacked the presidential palace in Baabda. The same morning, Aoun took refuge at the French Embassy, where he radioed his units to surrender to Lebanese Army Units under General Lahoud, who had pledged loyalty to Hrawi and his government.

== Exile (1990–2005) ==

=== Asylum, National Conference and FPM: 1991–2000 ===
France granted Aoun political asylum, but the Lebanese government wanted to take him to trial. After months of negotiations, he was given conditional amnesty and left to Cyprus and then to France on a French warship on 29 August 1991, where he started his exile.

On 14 July 1994, he established the Free Patriotic Movement in what he called &quot;The National Conference&quot;.

On 27 May 2000, two days after the Resistance and Liberation Day Michel Aoun wrote an article titled &quot;When is the Liberation?&quot; () in which he said: &quot;Till the day of actual liberation becomes a reality, we refuse to participate in festivities of freezing and leave its ecstasy for the drug addicts&quot;.

=== United States, SALSRA and testimony in congress: 2001–2004 ===
In 2001, Aoun started working with the Council of Lebanese American Organizations and the Lebanese expatriates in order to change the American public opinion regarding Lebanon. At the time, the United States supported the Syrian occupation and viewed Syria as an important factor for the stability of Lebanon.

He contacted Eliot Engel, an American representative, to propose a bill that would help ending the occupation. In July 2001, he was invited to attend a symposium on the Middle East, and after further delays from the State Department, he was granted an entry visa on 11 September, right before the same day attacks. After some hesitation about going, Aoun did travel to the United States, and met with several senators and representatives, but could not enter the congress because of the anthrax attacks. His talks did not lead to the result that he was seeking.

Although the Bush administration refused dealing with Aoun initially, they sent him a delegation of officials responsible for Lebanese affairs from the State Department, and explained the American position on the issue.

Later on, tensions grew between the United States and Syria, with the latter being accused of supporting terrorism and not standing by the United States in the War on Terror. Engel introduced the Syria Accountability and Lebanese Sovereignty Restoration Act in the House of Representatives on 12 April 2003. Aoun was invited to testify in congress, which he did on 17 September.

In his testimony, he criticized Syria in several ways. Aoun&#x27;s testimony was condemned by the Lebanese Council of Ministers and pro-Syrian politicians and organizations, and he was accused of plotting with the Zionist Lobby against Lebanon, Syria and the Arab Nation.

The bill was approved by both the Senate with an 89–4 vote on 11 November, and the House with a 408–8 vote on 20 November, and was signed by President George W. Bush on 11 December.

In the same year, an avowed Aounist candidate, Hikmat Dib, came surprisingly close to winning a key by-election in the Baabda–Aley constituency against the state-sponsored candidate, Henri Helou.

=== Cedar Revolution and return to Lebanon: 2005 ===
Aoun ended 15 years of self-imposed exile when he returned to Lebanon on 7 May 2005, following the withdrawal of the Syrian Army from Lebanon after the assassination of Rafic Hariri on 14 February 2005. Hariri&#x27;s killing was a catalyst for dramatic political change in Lebanon. The massive protests of the Cedar Revolution helped achieve the withdrawal of Syrian troops and security forces from Lebanon, and a change in governments, paving the way for return of Aoun to Lebanon. Aoun held a short press conference at Beirut International Airport before heading with a convoy of loyalists and journalists to the &quot;Grave of the Un-named Soldiers and Martyrs&quot;. After praying and expressing his gratitude and blessing to the people, he went on to the grave site of former Prime Minister Rafic Hariri. Then, he visited Samir Geagea who was in the 11th year of a lifetime jail sentence, condemned for alleged and disputed responsibility for politically motivated assassinations during the 15-year civil war. His journey continued to Martyr&#x27;s Square where he was greeted by supporters of the Cedar Revolution.

After his arrival, Aoun moved into a home in Lebanon&#x27;s Rabieh district, where he was visited on 8 May by a large delegation from the disbanded Lebanese Front (LF), who were among Aoun&#x27;s former enemies. Aoun and Sethrida Geagea, wife of the imprisoned LF leader Samir Geagea (since given amnesty), publicly reconciled. Other prominent visitors included National Liberal Party leader Dory Chamoun, Solange Gemayel, Nayla Moawad (widow of assassinated President René Moawad), and opposition MP Boutros Harb. Patriarch Nasrallah Boutros Sfeir of the Maronite community sent a delegation to welcome him, and even the Shiite Muslim Hezbollah Party sent a delegation.

==Political career==
===2005 elections===

In the election at the end of May 2005, the political leaders of the Syrian occupation imposed to run the elections with the 2000 electoral law; a law that Critics argue was implemented by Syrian intelligence chief Ghazi Kanaan and Rafic Hariri, that does not provide for a real popular representation and marginalizes many communities especially the Christian one throughout the country. Aoun opposed this electoral law choice and was fought by a quadruple alliance grouping Anti-Syrian (the Future Movement, the Progressive Socialist Party, the Lebanese Forces and some other parties) and Pro-Syrian (Amal and Hezbollah) main political parties against the Free Patriotic Movement headed by General Michel Aoun. In this context, Aoun surprised many observers by entering into electoral alliances with a number of former opponents, including some pro-Syrian politicians like Michel Murr and Suleiman Frangieh Jr.

Aoun&#x27;s party, the Free Patriotic Movement, made a strong showing, winning 21 of the 58 seats contested in that round, including almost all of the seats in the Christian heartland of Mount Lebanon. Aoun also won major Christian districts such as Zahle and Metn. Aoun himself was elected to the National Assembly. The FPM failed however to win any seats in Northern Lebanon due mainly to the 2000 electoral law that gave the pro Hariri Muslim community of Tripoli an easy veto over any Christian candidate in its electoral district, thus falling short of its objective of holding the balance of power between the main &quot;anti-Syrian&quot; opposition coalition (formerly known to be Syria&#x27;s strong allies) led by Saad Hariri (which won an absolute majority) and the Shiite-dominated Amal-Hezbollah alliance.

The FPM won 21 seats in the parliament, and formed the largest Christian bloc in Lebanon, and second biggest bloc in the Lebanese Parliament.

===Memorandum of understanding between the FPM and Hezbollah===

In 2006, Michel Aoun and Hassan Nasrallah met in Mar Mikhayel Church, Chiyah, a venue that symbolizes Christian–Muslim coexistence as the Church, located in the heart of the mainly Muslim Beirut southern suburb, was preserved throughout the wars. The FPM signed a memorandum of understanding with Hezbollah organizing their relation and discussing Hezbollah&#x27;s disarmament given some conditions. The second and third conditions for disarmament were the return of Lebanese prisoners from Israeli jails and the elaboration of a defense strategy to protect Lebanon from the Israeli threat. The agreement also discussed the importance of having normal diplomatic relations with Syria and the request for information about the Lebanese political prisoners in Syria and the return of all political prisoners and diaspora in Israel.

After this event, Aoun and his party became part of the March 8 Alliance.
=== Lebanese anti-government protests: 2006–2008 ===
On 1 December 2006, Michel Aoun declared to a crowd of protesters that the current government of Lebanon was unconstitutional claiming that the government had &quot;made corruption a daily affair&quot; and called for the resignation on the government. Hundreds of thousands of supporters of this party, the Amal Movement and Hezbollah, according to the Internal Security Forces (ISF), gathered at Downtown Beirut trying to force Fouad Siniora to abdicate. On December 1, 2006, Michel Aoun declared to a crowd of protesters that the current government of Lebanon was unconstitutional, claiming that the government had &quot;made corruption a daily affair&quot; and called for the resignation of the government. Hundreds of thousands of supporters of this party, the Amal Movement and Hezbollah, according to the Internal Security Forces (ISF), gathered in Downtown Beirut trying to force Fouad Siniora to abdicate.

On 11 July 2008, Aoun&#x27;s party entered the Lebanese government. FPM members, Issam Abu Jamra as Deputy-Prime Minister, Gebran Bassil as Minister of Telecommunications, and Mario Aoun as Minister of Social Affairs were elected into government. It is the Movement&#x27;s first participation in any Lebanese Government.

===2009 elections and government formation===

The results of the 2009 elections granted the FPM 27 parliamentary seats. One of them was won by Aoun from Keserwan.

In November 2009, and after 6 months of strong political pressure by General Michel Aoun himself, by refusing any participation in the government that was inferior to the 2008 participation, Prime Minister Saad Hariri eventually gave in. The Free Patriotic Movement nominated three ministers to join the first government headed by Saad Hariri, who would receive the ministry of telecommunications, the ministry of energy and water, and the ministry of tourism.

Aoun and his allies got one third of the government, but were one minister short of having veto power. On 12 January 2011, in a move orchestrated from Aoun&#x27;s house in Rabieh, the Hariri government was toppled through the resignation of the FPM ministers and their allies. On 13 June 2011, a new government headed by Prime Minister Najib Mikati saw light where Aoun&#x27;s parliamentary Reform and Change Bloc assumed 10 ministries.

=== 2016 presidential candidacy ===
Lebanese Forces (LF) leader Samir Geagea and Michel Aoun turned a historic page in intra-Christian relations when the former March 14 presidential nominee officially endorsed on Monday Aoun&#x27;s candidacy for the presidency. &quot;I announce after long consideration, discussions and deliberations between members of the executive body of the Lebanese Forces, our endorsement of the candidacy of [former] General Michel Aoun for the presidency,&quot; Geagea said in joint news conference with his March 8 rival. Speaking from the LF&#x27;s headquarters in Maarab where he had met with Aoun shortly before the news conference, Geagea read a 10-point understanding that summarized the key points of the Declaration of Intent struck between the LF and FPM in June.

The commitment to the implementation of the Taif Accord, the need to stop the flow of arms and militants across the Lebanese-Syrian border in both directions, the ratification of a new electoral law and compliance with international resolutions were among the key points agreed upon between the LF and FPM, Geagea said. As he read the key points of his understanding with Aoun, Geagea paused for a moment to tell a joke. With humor, the LF leader asked Aoun to urge his son-in-law Foreign Minister Gebran Bassil to act in accordance with the sixth point of their agreement. Geagea was referring to his understanding with the former general over &quot;the need to adopt an independent foreign policy that guarantees Lebanon&#x27;s interests and complies with international law.&quot; For his part, Aoun thanked Geagea for his support and said he would extend his hands to all political parties.

Geagea&#x27;s official endorsement of Aoun&#x27;s nomination would provide a significant boost for the former general&#x27;s presidential bid but it remains unclear how the Future Movement would react to this initiative. Before his arrival to the LF&#x27;s headquarters, Aoun met with Maronite Patriarch Bechara Boutros al-Rahi, who has repeatedly voiced his support for initiatives aimed at breaking the presidential deadlock. &quot;We came to inform the patriarch of the agreement&quot;, Aoun said from the seat of the Maronite church.

Earlier in the day, Rai had met with former Prime Minister and head of the Future Movement parliamentary bloc Fouad Siniora. Following his meeting with the patriarch, Siniora stressed the need to elect a president who enjoys the support of all Lebanese factions. &quot;We have to work hard to elect a person who can unite all Lebanese people from all political affiliations and promote coexistence among them,&quot; said Siniora. Geagea&#x27;s endorsement of Aoun is the first time the country&#x27;s two leading Christian parties have come together on such a pivotal issue after decades of animosity.

Geagea, the former March 14 presidential candidate, was caught by surprise when his ally Future Movement leader and former Prime Minister Saad Hariri reportedly nominated Marada Movement Chief Suleiman Frangieh Jr. for the presidency. Geagea has staunchly opposed the deal, which stirred up controversy both within the March 8 and 14 camps.

Aoun, on the other hand, had shown no signs of giving up his presidential ambitions in favor of Franjieh, a longtime ally of Hezbollah and a member of Aoun&#x27;s reform and Change parliamentary bloc. For weeks Hezbollah remained silent over Hariri&#x27;s proposed settlement, as Franjieh sought to win the support of its allies. Hezbollah finally broke its media silence on 29 December 2015, and reaffirmed its support for Aoun&#x27;s presidential bid.

In the first official statement since Hariri&#x27;s initiative emerged, Hezbollah&#x27;s Politburo Chief Sayyed Ibrahim Amin al-Sayyed announced from the seat of the Maronite patriarchate that his party is committed to supporting the presidential bid of its ally Aoun. Aoun and Geagea kicked off talks a year ago. The talks culminated in a Declaration of Intent that paved the way for a surprise visit by Geagea to Aoun&#x27;s residence in Rabieh in June. The Declaration of Intent has since brought Aoun and Geagea closer together, putting an end to the bitter rivalry between the Christian leaders who fought a devastating war in 1990. Lebanon&#x27;s top post has been vacant since May 2014 as Lebanese politicians failed to agree on a consensus president.

On 20 October 2016, Saad Hariri declared publicly his support and that of his parliamentary block to voting Michel Aoun for president. This support increased his chances tremendously of getting elected president during the parliamentary session scheduled for 31 October.

===Election as president===
On 31 October 2016, Aoun was elected the president of Lebanon, ending a 29-month vacuum at the head of the state. After 45 failed attempts to achieve a parliamentary quorum for presidential elections by the Lebanese Parliament, the 127-seat chamber convened for a 46th time on 31 October under the leadership of house speaker Nabih Berri.

The first round of voting required a two-thirds majority of the house, meaning 85 votes of the 127 member chamber, but Aoun closely failed to secure the necessary votes for the round winning just 83 votes, two less than required, while there were 36 blank ballots, 6 cancelled ballots and one ballot for MP Gilberte Zouein.

The second round of voting had to be repeated three times before ballots were read out loud after the parliament&#x27;s secretariat counted 128 envelopes instead of 127, which is the number of MPs who participated in the presidential election. In the second round, an absolute (50 percent plus one) majority of the quorum was needed, meaning 64 votes required for election. Eventually Aoun received 83 votes and was elected. There were 36 blank ballots in the second round, 7 ballots cancelled and 1 vote for MP Sethrida Geagea, the wife of Samir Geagea.

Aoun was quickly sworn in as president, pledging political and economic reform and urging a &quot;real partnership&quot; among notoriously divided Lebanese political factions. Following the parliament session, Aoun was driven to the presidential palace in the southeastern Beirut suburb of Baabda, returning exactly 26 years after he was forced out of it as army commander and interim premier by Syrian forces.

== Presidency (2016–2022) ==

=== Second Hariri Cabinet ===
After the resignation of Tammam Salam, Aoun designated Saad Hariri to form a new cabinet following binding parliamentary consultations. This came as a result of the consensus that led to the election of Aoun, and it was the second time Hariri held the position. The cabinet consisted of 30 ministers as a national unity government. On 28 December, it won the confidence of the parliament with an 87 MPs majority.

On 4 November 2017, Hariri resigned from office in a televised statement from Saudi Arabia and blamed it on Iran policies and it is &quot;interference in the Lebanese affairs&quot;. He also described Hezbollah a threat to the security of Lebanon, and compared the situation in Lebanon with the one before the assassination of Rafic Hariri. Iran called his resignation part of a plot by the United States, Israel, and Saudi Arabia to heighten Middle Eastern tensions. The secretary general of Hezbollah Hassan Nasrallah considered this a Saudi declaration of war on Lebanon. After his 12-day stay in Saudi Arabia, Aoun informed the foreign ambassadors that he is detained there.

On 21 November, Hariri returned to Beirut to participate in the Independence Day celebrations. He decided to suspend the resignation after meeting Aoun, who told him to postpone the thing until other consultations. On 5 December, he officially withdrew his resignation.

In August 2017, Aoun signed the country&#x27;s first animal protection bill into law, guaranteeing that domestic and wild animals would be legally protected from abuse.

=== Third Hariri cabinet ===
On 6 January 2019, a new Lebanese government was formed, headed by Prime Minister Saad Hariri. The government took nine months to form, following extended negotiations with various political factions. It is a national unity cabinet, and was composed of 30 ministers.

=== 2019 protests ===
Large-scale anti-government demonstrations ignited in the country from 17 October. Initially triggered in response to a rise in gas and tobacco prices as well as a new tax on messaging applications, the demonstrations quickly turned into a revolution against the stagnation of the economy, cabinet failure, unemployment, Lebanon&#x27;s sectarian and hereditary political system, corruption and the government&#x27;s inability to provide essential services such as water, electricity and sanitation, involving hundreds of thousands of people from every region and sect of the country. President Michel Aoun addressed the population on 24 October, stating his willingness to hold a dialogue with the protesters and find the best solution forward. He supported Hariri&#x27;s reforms but did confirm a need to &quot;review the current government&quot; within the &quot;state institutions&quot;, and not through protesting. Hariri supported this review through Lebanon&#x27;s &quot;constitutional mechanisms&quot;, but the protesters rejected any calls for dialogue until the government has resigned.

Aoun gave a live interview at 8:30PM on 12 November, during which he rejected calls for a fully technocratic government, warned against a run on the bank further damaging the economic sector, and called for an immediate end to the protests to prevent a &quot;catastrophe&quot;. Aoun accused protesters of &quot;stabbing the nation with a dagger&quot; and accused protesters that blocked roads of &quot;violating international law&quot;. Aoun also stated that &quot;anyone who cannot find faith in the current Lebanese government can leave Lebanon and live somewhere else&quot;. Aoun&#x27;s interview proved exceedingly unpopular with the protest movement, which began blocking dozens of arterial roads in Beirut and across Lebanon. Alaa Abou Fakhr, a Lebanese national, was shot and killed in Khalde at the ensuing protests.

Protesters began appearing in the early morning of 13 November near the heavily fortified Baabda Presidential Palace to express dissatisfaction with President Aoun&#x27;s speech a few hours earlier and picked up in pace as the day progressed.

==== Hassan Diab cabinet and premiership vacuum ====
Diab was appointed prime minister by President Michel Aoun following the resignation of Saad Hariri following the 2019–20 Lebanese protests, that started in October 2019. A new Lebanese cabinet led by Prime Minister Hassan Diab was formed in Lebanon on 21 January 2020, after agreement was reached by the heads of the involved political parties after nearly three months. The already delegitimized government assigned Diab and his new cabinet, despite ongoing public outrage against the new cabinet and citizen requests for a competent, independent, and technocratic government. The marketing campaign by the authoritative powers around the new cabinet were mired by supposed untruths such as Diab claiming to have met reformist representatives of the revolution but turned out to be regime supporters or the regime using the term &quot;techno-political&quot; to describe the new cabinet in order to justify the majority partisan appointments.

On 10 August 2020, the government resigned following public anger over the 2020 Beirut explosion on 4 August but continued to govern as a caretaker government. Aoun appointed Moustapha Adib as prime minister designate on 31 August to succeed Diab. The latter renounced to form a government on 26 September 2020, because of the dissensions between political parties concerning the attribution of the ministries. Saad Hariri later announced on October that he was &quot;definitely a candidate&quot; for the formation of a new government. He was again appointed President of the Council of Ministers after binding parliamentary consultations led by Michel Aoun. On 6 March 2021, while Saad Hariri has still not managed to form a government, Diab denounces the situation of political and economic crisis and threatens to stop expediting current affairs by leaving office immediately. 

On 22 March, and after several meetings between Prime Minister-designate Saad Hariri and President Aoun, Hariri said that the demands of the President were &quot;unacceptable&quot;, therefore Lebanon witnessed a failure to form a new government which will worsen the crisis. According to Hariri, President Aoun presented him with a line-up granting his team a third of all cabinet seats, which would enable them to have veto power over decision making in the Lebanese government. Hariri was said to have been criticized by Aoun for disclosing his proposed government with the media, because the distribution of the ministries was unjust which was his reason for not agreeing to the line-up, according to Al Jazeera. After the meeting which only lasted for just 35 minutes, another date for a new meeting between Hariri and Aoun could not be confirmed.

In conflict with Aoun concerning the distribution of ministerial posts, Hariri gave up on a government formation on 15 July 2021.

==== 2020 Beirut port explosion ====

On 4 August 2020, a large amount of ammonium nitrate stored at the Port of Beirut in the capital city of Lebanon exploded, causing at least 218 deaths, 7,000 injuries, and US$15 billion in property damage, as well as leaving an estimated 300,000 people homeless. A cargo of 2,750 tonnes of the substance (equivalent to around 1.1 kilotons of TNT) had been stored in a warehouse without proper safety measures for the previous six years after having been confiscated by the Lebanese authorities from the abandoned ship . The explosion was preceded by a fire in the same warehouse. As of , the exact cause of the explosion is still under investigation. Aoun expressed intention government would make up to 100billion pounds (US$66million) in aid available to support recovery operations. On 10 August 2020, Hassan Diab and his cabinet stepped down from office. Michel Aoun accepted the resignation of the government and the Prime Minister, and asked the government to stay on in a caretaker capacity until a new cabinet is formed. Aoun denied allegations of being involvement however did admit to being aware of the ammonium nitrate.

===Succession===
Aoun signed the government&#x27;s resignation decree, a day before his six-year term officially ended, and Prime Minister Najib Mikati&#x27;s government remains in office in a caretaker capacity after numerous attempts failed to form a new cabinet. His term officially ended on 31 October 2022 after 6 years in office, with no successor designated, similarly to his predecessors.

In June 2023, former president Michel Aoun visited the Syrian capital, Damascus. In their meeting, Syrian President Bashar al-Assad assured that he would not interfere in the selection of the next president in Lebanon.&lt;ref name=&quot;middleeastmonitor.com/&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; On the thirteenth session of voting, Joseph Aoun (not related), was elected to succeed him as president of Lebanon in January 2025 after a two-year vacancy.

==Political strategy==
In an unprecedented move, Aoun signed a memorandum of understanding with Hezbollah on 6 February 2006. His present strategy is an alleged &quot;war against corruption&quot;.

Since the end of the Syrian occupation of Lebanon, General Aoun has been seeking to improve his country&#x27;s relationship with Syria. He has treated all Lebanese parties as potential partners in the process of change and reform of the country. The memorandum of understanding with Hezbollah enters in this context.

In September 2015, Aoun sponsored the candidacy of his son-in law, Foreign Minister Gebran Bassil, to the FPM leadership post. Bassil was elected by acclamation after his main contender, MP Alain Aoun (Michel&#x27;s nephew), was convinced to quit the race.

==Political views and relations==
===The West===
Aoun explained why he turned back on the West and forged an alliance with the Axis of Resistance in a speech in May 2008 by saying:

=== Iran and Hezbollah ===
Aoun&#x27;s political bloc has formed a significant alliance with Hezbollah, which has been crucial for his political survival. He has defended Hezbollah&#x27;s right to bear arms, framing its military capabilities as essential for Lebanon. In February, he told the Egyptian TV CBC that the &quot;arms of the resistance&quot; are needed to fight &quot;against the Israeli occupation.&quot; Hezbollah has also used its alliance with Aoun to claim Christian credibility and expand its alliances paving a way for Hezbollah&#x27;s influence in the presidential seat.

===United States===

In a December 1995 interview with the &quot;Middle East Quarterly&quot; journal, Aoun replied when asked if he disliked the United States:
=== Syria ===
During the Lebanese Civil War, Aoun, as head of a disputed Christian government, waged a &quot;war of liberation&quot; against Syrian forces deployed in Lebanon. After returning to Lebanon in 2005, Aoun began advocating for better relations with Syria, saying &quot;This is an old story that is now over. We must have better relations with Syria.&quot; Aoun visited Syria in 2008, predicting a &quot;bright future&quot; for ties between Lebanon and Syria after talks with President Bashar al-Assad. As president, Aoun adopted a friendlier position towards Syria and dispatched ministers to Damascus to secure the return of Syrian refugees. 

In 2015, he stated that there are no Lebanese detainees remaining in Syria. This was proved false after the fall of the Assad regime where thousands of prisoners were freed, including multiple Lebanese who have been held there since the Lebanese Civil War and endured torture. Aoun became heavily criticized for his neglection and his political opponents called for him to be held accountable. 

==Personal life==
A son of Naim and Marie Aoun, he married Nadia El-Chami on 30 November 1968 and together, they have three daughters. The first, Mireille Aoun, who works as his personal advisor and is married to Roy Hachem, the CEO of Aoun&#x27;s OTV. The second one is Claudine Aoun who serves as the president of the Arab Women Organization since 2019 and the National Commission For Lebanese Women since 2017, and married to Brigadier-General Chamel Roukoz, a decorated officer who took part in Aoun&#x27;s liberation war, Nahr al-Bared conflict and Battle of Sidon. He is also a Member of Parliament, elected in 2018. The third, Chantal, is married to Gebran Bassil, whom she met at an FPM conference in Paris in 1996. He served as a minister in different cabinets, and succeeded Aoun as president of the Free Patriotic Movement in 2015.

His nephew, Alain Aoun, is a Member of Parliament, elected in 2009, 2018 and 2022.

He is unrelated to Joseph Aoun, who was Commander of the Lebanese Armed Forces during his presidency and succeeded him in 2025 as President of Lebanon.

<doc id="818660" wikidata="Q500325" url="?curid=818660" title="Gex (series)">
<text>Gex is a platformer video game series, developed by Crystal Dynamics, that details the adventures of an anthropomorphic gecko named Gex. He has served as the mascot of Crystal Dynamics, appearing on their company logo for several years up until the year 2000. In the North American version, Gex is voiced by the comedian Dana Gould; the United Kingdom version features Gould as well as Leslie Phillips and Danny John-Jules as the voice of Gex. Gex was voiced by Mitsuo Senda in the Japanese release of the second game.

The Gex games are largely inspired by American TV culture, Gex contributing to the games with wise-cracking remarks laced with media and references to popular culture.

Sony Interactive Entertainment published &quot;Gex 3: Deep Cover Gecko&quot; on October 1, 2009, &quot;Gex&quot; on November 5, 2009, and &quot;Gex: Enter the Gecko&quot; on February 4, 2014 under the &quot;PS one Classics&quot; banner in the PlayStation Network. The ports are compatible with the PlayStation 3, Portable and Vita. Additionally, Square Enix published &quot;Gex&quot; at GOG.com, a distribution platform for legacy games, on October 16, 2014.

==Plot==
Gex is a gecko who has a passion for television which makes him a target for the cybernetic being Emperor Rez. Emperor Rez is determined to overthrow The Media Dimension, the &quot;world&quot; of television.

==Games==
===&quot;Gex&quot; (1995)===
===&quot;Gex: Enter the Gecko&quot; (1998)===
===&quot;Gex 3: Deep Cover Gecko&quot; (1999)===

===Cancelled projects===
A fourth &quot;Gex&quot; entry was in development for the PlayStation 2 and GameCube, but was canceled due to lack of interest from Eidos Interactive. Many of the ideas and aspects were later used for &quot;Whiplash&quot; for the PS2 with only concept art existing of the &quot;Gex 4&quot; idea.

An unreleased PS1 prototype demo for a cancelled 2001 game referred to as &quot;Gex Jr.&quot; was leaked online in April 2022.

==Characters==
*Gex - Gex is a smart aleck, wise-cracking gecko who lives with his family in Maui, Hawaii. He spends his days with his friends, surfing, playing the ukulele, and throwing poi parties down on the beach with the local lady lizards. After his father&#x27;s death, he begins watching mass amounts of TV to get over the tragedy. He eventually inherits over twenty billion dollars from his deceased great uncle and buys the world&#x27;s largest television. He has his own island hideaway called the GEXCave located in the South Pacific. His catchphrase is &quot;It&#x27;s tail time!&quot;, due to his primary attack being tail whips. Gex is voiced by Dana Gould in all three installments in North America. The PAL (European and Australian game formats) versions feature three separate voice actors; Dana Gould in the original game, Leslie Phillips in the second game, and Danny John-Jules in the third game.

*Rez - Rez is a megalomaniac, cybernetic entity, and the main antagonist of the series. His one true ambition is to control the entire Media Dimension and ensure the longevity of bad TV shows and Z-Grade movies. His entire essence is made up of Liquid Rez, liquid noise spread throughout the series. He also claims to be Gex&#x27;s father. Rez is voiced by Bruce Robertson.

*Agent Xtra - Agent Xtra is Gex&#x27;s crime-fighting partner, who also loves TV as well. She is kidnapped by Rez and communicates to Gex through video signals in mission control. She is portrayed in live-action sequences by Marliece Andrada.

*Alfred The Tortoise - Alfred is Gex&#x27;s butler. He is a turtle who wears a bow tie and glasses. He provides Gex with constant help to defeat Rez. He is voiced by Marc Silk.

*Rex - Rex is a small, red &quot;Tyrannosaurus rex&quot; and Gex&#x27;s prehistoric ancestor. He was seen frozen in a block of ice at the &quot;Holiday Broadcasting&quot; channel that Gex can melt to set him free.

*Cuz - Cuz is Gex&#x27;s overweight cousin and seems to be a leopard gecko. He is saved by Gex after being locked in a cage by the gangsters on the &quot;Gangsters TV&quot; channel.

* Gex&#x27;s Father - Gex&#x27;s Dad works for NASA by doing various research projects. He and ten other volunteers are chosen to eat tapioca pudding in zero gravity, though their rocket explodes due to a Band-Aid floating into one of the fuel tanks, killing them. His mother later moves to California, and after gaining money inherited from Gex&#x27;s great-uncle, Charlie, she purchases 51 percent ownership in NASA, fires everyone, sells the rockets to some third world countries, and converts Mission Control into &quot;Space Monkeys&quot;, a theme restaurant featuring robotic dancing chimps wearing spacesuits. In the novel, Rez claims that he is Gex&#x27;s real father and became the way he was after the explosion, whether this is true or not is unclear, although Rez makes the same claim in &quot;Gex 2&quot; but with a different story (saying he fell into a scrapheap while trying to get free cable).

==Future==
In February 2016, Square Enix announced that they would allow developers to create games based on some of their old Eidos intellectual properties via the Square Enix Collective project, including the &quot;Gex&quot; intellectual property. In December 2021, Square Enix filed a new &quot;Gex&quot; trademark in the European Union, and subsequently in February a new trademark for &quot;Gex&quot; in Japan. Three months later, Embracer Group made an agreement to purchase Crystal Dynamics and Eidos IPs from Square Enix, which did not include &quot;Gex&quot;. In July 2023, Limited Run Games announced &quot;Gex Trilogy&quot;, a compilation release of all three games emulated through Limited Run&#x27;s Carbon Engine. The compilation will be released for Nintendo Switch, PlayStation 4, PlayStation 5, Windows and Xbox Series X/S.

==Legacy==
Gex appears as an unlockable character in the North American and European versions of &quot;Hot Shots Golf 2&quot; and &quot;Mad Dash Racing,&quot; with the latter featuring Billy West as the voice of Gex.

Starting in the mid-2010s &quot;Gex&quot; gained a cult following as an internet meme due to the game’s fourth wall breaking humor and its status as a dormant 1990s mascot platform franchise. Additionally, popular YouTube gaming personalities, including videogamedunkey and Scott the Woz, have referenced the franchise in running gags.

The titular character has been associated with the hyperpop duo 100 gecs, where he was featured on the cover their self-titled debut EP.

In June 2022, a fan animation of the game was uploaded to YouTube by FlippinDingDong. It was presented as a tape recording of a 1990s animated series that aired on Toon Disney. The clip features Gex&#x27;s characteristic one-liners. The animation would later become viral on YouTube. FlippinDingDong would later provide animation for both the reveal trailer and the LRG 2024 trailer for &quot;Gex Trilogy&quot;. 

Gex appears in Astro Bot as an unlockable bot found in the game&#x27;s Winter Wonder level, released in a free update on December 12, 2024.

<text>James Boyle (born 1959) is a Scottish intellectual property scholar. He is the William Neal Reynolds Professor of Law and co-founder of the Center for the Study of the Public Domain at Duke University School of Law in Durham, North Carolina. He is most prominently known for advocating looser copyright policies in the United States and worldwide.

==Teaching and activism==
Boyle graduated from the University of Glasgow in 1980 and subsequently studied at Harvard Law School. He joined Duke University School of Law in July 2000. He had previously taught at American University, Yale, Harvard, and the University of Pennsylvania Law School.

In 2002, he was one of the founding board members of Creative Commons, and held the position of Chairman of the Board in 2009, after which he stepped down. He also co-founded Science Commons, which aims to expand the Creative Commons mission into the realm of scientific and technical data, and ccLearn, a division of Creative Commons aimed at facilitating access to open education resources.

In 2006, he earned the Duke Bar Association Distinguished Teaching Award.

The courses he teaches include &quot;Intellectual Property&quot;, &quot;The Constitution in Cyberspace&quot;, &quot;Law and Literature&quot;, &quot;Jurisprudence&quot;, and &quot;Torts&quot;.

==Written works==
He is the author of &quot;The Line: AI &amp; The Future of Personhood&quot;, &quot;Shamans, Software and Spleens: Law and Construction of the Information Society&quot; as well as a novel published under a Creative Commons license, &quot;The Shakespeare Chronicles&quot;.

In his work on intellectual property, &quot;The Public Domain: Enclosing the Commons of the Mind&quot; (2008), Boyle argues that the current system of copyright protections fails to fulfill the original intent of copyright: rewarding and encouraging creativity. It was also published under a non-commercial CC BY-NC-SA Creative Commons license.

Boyle also contributes a column to the &quot;Financial Times&quot; New Technology Policy Forum.

In 2011, Boyle was one of five experts consulted for the &quot;Hargreaves Review of Intellectual Property and Growth&quot;, a comprehensive analysis of the United Kingdom&#x27;s intellectual property system that made suggestions for data-driven reform of the system.

<doc id="818683" wikidata="Q157999" url="?curid=818683" title="Oj, svijetla majska zoro">
<text>&quot;&quot; (, ; ) is the national anthem of Montenegro adopted in 2004. Before its adoption, it was a popular folk song with many variations of its text. The oldest version dates back to the second half of the 19th century.

==Lyrics==
Many verses are repeated in order to follow the rhythmic composition.
;English translation
:𝄆 O bright dawn of May blazes forth 𝄇
:𝄆 Our mother Montenegro 𝄇
:𝄆 We are the sons of your gravel 𝄇
:𝄆 And guardians of your candour 𝄇
:We love you, your craggy highlands
:And your magnificent gorges
:Which never came to experience
:The chains of shameful slavery
:𝄆 Our mother Montenegro 𝄇

:𝄆 O bright dawn of May blazes forth 𝄇
:𝄆 Our mother Montenegro 𝄇
:For the cause of our Lovćen
:Our unity gives us wings
:All proud and lauded shall we be
:Our dear homeland beloved
:Estuary of our waves
:That surges into the two seas
:𝄆 Shall bear voice into the ocean
:That Montenegro is ageless 𝄇
:That Montenegro is ageless!

== History ==
===Original version from the 19th century===
The following is the oldest known version of the anthem, known as &quot;O Bright Dawn of Bravery, Oi!&quot; (&quot;&quot;). It was played in public for the first time in 1863 in the national theater in Belgrade. It was a component song of the &quot;Battle of Grahovo or blood feud in Montenegro&quot; () heroic play in three parts. The play and the Montenegrin folk song was also played/sung in the National Theater again in 1870 and 1876.

===World War II collaborationist version===
In 1944, Sekula Drljević, a Montenegrin fascist collaborator, rearranged the lyrics of the Montenegrin patriotic song &quot;Oj, svijetla majska zoro&quot; to celebrate the creation of the Montenegrin puppet regime that had been established in July 1941.

===World War II partisan version===


=== Popular song ===
The song survived until today under various names as a popular Montenegrin folk song under the name &quot;O Bright Dawn of May&quot; (&quot;&quot;). This version of the song has been one of the several versions proposed in 1993 during the first discussion on the official state anthem, however, on which there was no consensus because of the disputed melodic value.

== Controversies ==
As the president of Montenegro, Filip Vujanović participated on several occasions public debates regarding the disputed parts of the national anthem, which was made official in 2004. On that occasion, the official text of the anthem also included two stanzas (third and fourth) sung by the Montenegrin fascist and war criminal Sekula Drljević. Controversy over the disputed parts of the anthem in the following years led to open divisions among the citizens of Montenegro, and Vujanović himself on various occasions publicly criticized the adoption of Drljevic&#x27;s stanzas, from which he distanced himself, advocating changes to the official text of the anthem. Vujanović repeatedly pointed out that the adoption of Drljevic&#x27;s verses was not acceptable because their creator was a fascist or Nazi, and on the same occasion he warned of the danger of strengthening extreme Montenegrin nationalism and chauvinism.

<text>Edinburgh Waverley (also known simply as Edinburgh; ) is the principal railway station serving Edinburgh, Scotland. It is the second busiest station in Scotland, after Glasgow Central. The station serves as the northern terminus of the East Coast Main Line, from , although some trains operated by London North Eastern Railway continue to other Scottish destinations beyond Edinburgh.

==History==
=== Origins ===

Edinburgh&#x27;s Old Town, perched on a steep-sided sloping ridge, was bounded on the north by a valley in which the Nor Loch had been formed. In the 1750s overcrowding led to proposals to link across this valley to allow development to the north. The &quot;noxious lake&quot; was to be narrowed into &quot;a canal of running water&quot;, with a bridge formed across the east end of the loch adjacent to the physic garden. This link was built from 1766 as the North Bridge and at the same time plans for the New Town began development to the north, with Princes Street to get unobstructed views south over sloping gardens and the proposed canal. The loch was drained as work on the bridge proceeded. 

In 1770 a coachbuilder began work on properties feued at the corner between the bridge and Princes Street, and feuers on the other side of the street strongly objected to this construction blocking their views to the south. A series of court cases ended with the decision that the buildings nearing completion could stay, immediately to the west of that some workshops would be allowed below the level of Princes Street, and further west a park would be &quot;kept and preserved in perpetuity as pleasure ground&quot; in what became Princes Street Gardens.

===Edinburgh and Glasgow railway===

In the mid-1830s proposals for a railway from Glasgow running along the gardens to a station at the North Bridge were set out in a prospectus with assurances that the trains would be concealed from view, and smoke from them &quot;would scarcely be seen&quot;. An association of &quot;Princes Street Proprietors&quot; who had feued houses in the street, and had spent large sums turning the &quot;filthy and offensive bog&quot; of the Nor Loch into quiet gardens, strongly opposed the railway and in late 1836 put forward their case against the Act of Parliament for the railway. 

The Edinburgh and Glasgow Railway opened in 1842 with its terminus at Haymarket railway station, stopping short of Princes Street. In the Railway Mania of the 1840s, the railway sought another Act of Parliament allowing access along the gardens, and at the same time two other railways proposed terminus stations at the North Bridge site. By then several of the Princes Street properties were shops or hotels with an interest in development, and agreement was reached in 1844 on walls and embankments to conceal the Edinburgh and Glasgow railway line in a cutting, with compensation of almost £2,000 for the proprietors.

===North Bridge Station===
The North Bridge station was opened on 22 June 1846 by the North British Railway as the terminus for its line from Berwick-upon-Tweed. The Edinburgh and Glasgow Railway&#x27;s General station opened on 17 May 1847, on the same day as the Canal Street station of the Edinburgh, Leith and Newhaven Railway, serving Leith and Granton via a long rope-hauled tunnel under the New Town. The collective name &quot;Waverley&quot;, after the Waverley Novels by Sir Walter Scott, was used for the three from around 1854 when the through &quot;Waverley&quot; route to Carlisle opened. Canal Street station was also known as Edinburgh Princes Street, not to be confused with the Caledonian Railway railway station later built at the West End which was named Princes Street station from 1870.

From 1866 to 1868, the North British Railway acquired the stations of its rivals, demolished all three and closed the Scotland Street tunnel to Canal Street. The present Victorian station was built on the site. Along the tracks of this first station, Hanna, Donald &amp; Wilson built some very impressive roofs. The station was extended in the late 19th century. In 1897, the impressive glass dome was added. Waverley has been in continual use since, under the auspices of the North British, the LNER, British Railways (rebranded as British Rail after 1965), Railtrack and now Network Rail. From its opening in its current form by the eastward tunnelled extension from Haymarket, Waverley has been the principal railway station in Edinburgh. From 1870 to 1965, the city had a second major station, Princes Street, operated by the rival Caledonian Railway, but this was never as important as Waverley.

The railway company constructed a hotel beside their station. The North British Hotel, adjacent to the station at the corner between Princes Street and North Bridge, on the site of the coachworks, opened in 1902.
It closed in 1988, but was re-opened by new owners as the Balmoral Hotel in 1991.

===Recent history===
British Rail brought railway electrification in 1991 with electric trains on the East Coast Main Line to Glasgow Central and via York to London King&#x27;s Cross. The station&#x27;s large size and the unusual topography of its surroundings mean that it contains a large amount of valuable, centrally located land. The station&#x27;s successive owners, British Rail, Railtrack and its current owner Network Rail have been criticised for underusing the valuable city-centre spaces available within, there being a legal covenant preventing any upwards extension, which would obstruct the view of Arthur&#x27;s Seat from Princes Street. The elevated walkway linking the Waverley Steps (from Princes Street to Market Street) has been upgraded with the recommissioning of the suburban platforms (at the south) and provision of additional through platforms to the north to serve the increased proportion of through rail traffic.

During 2006 and 2007, parts of Waverley were extensively refurbished, including two new through platforms and the electrification of platforms 12 to 18 in preparation for electric trains from the Airdrie-Bathgate Rail Link and future lines in Scotland to be electrified by the EGIP (Edinburgh/Glasgow Improvement Project).

From 2010 to 2012, the glazing of the roof of Waverley station was entirely replaced with new strengthened clear glass panels, replacing the old of mixed surfaces including felt, cloudy wired glass and plastic sheet. Part of a £130 million upgrade, this has greatly increased the amount of natural light in the station.

From 2012 to 2014, improvements included: a new set of covered escalators at Waverley Steps leading to Princes Street (narrowing the huge set of previously open-air steps); a rebuilt and widened entrance from Market Street; a rebuilding of the canopies on the southern suburban line; a restoration of the central space in the ticket hall; and major improvements to the Calton Road access. Internally, several new lifts and escalators have greatly aided circulation. A new drop-off point and disabled parking/access was added on the Calton Road access in 2014.

In mid-2017, as part of the Edinburgh to Glasgow Improvement Programme, platform 12 was extended. At the same time the former Motorail bay platforms were extended into a former car park area and taxi rank to allow platforms 5 and 6 to be extended to accommodate additional London North Eastern Railway services. Platforms 5 and 6 were brought into use on 28 February 2019.

Work began in 2020 to reopen a corridor from the ticket office to the eastern concourse; this will also see the toilets replaced and a Changing Places facility installed.

== Location ==
Waverley station is situated in a steep, narrow valley between the medieval Old Town and the 18th century New Town. Princes Street, the premier shopping street, runs close to its north side. The valley is bridged by the North Bridge, rebuilt in 1897 as a three-span iron and steel bridge, on huge sandstone piers. This passes high above the station&#x27;s central section, with the greater half of the station being west of North Bridge.

The central booking hall is just west of the northern massive stone pier of the bridge and cleverly hides it within its bulk. Waverley Bridge lies at the western end of the station (though platforms extend below it) and it is this road which, by means of ramps, formerly afforded vehicular access to the station and still provides two of the six pedestrian entrances to the station.

The valley to the west of the station, formerly the site of the Nor Loch, is the public parkland of Princes Street Gardens. Directly east of the station are St Andrew&#x27;s House, which accommodates part of the Scottish Government and Governor&#x27;s House.

Lumo started operating services from London King&#x27;s Cross to Edinburgh Waverley via Stevenage, Newcastle and Morpeth in October 2021.

===Routes – present and past===











==Layout==

The main station facilities are located in the middle of what is essentially a large island platform which is surrounded by platforms on all four sides. There are 20 numbered platforms, in a clockwise direction from the north east. There are three pairs of platforms which share the same tracks.
*There are two tracks on the north side. The northernmost track is split between Platform 20 (west) and Platform 1 (east) and the other is split between Platform 19 (west) and Platform 2 (east).
*There are four east-facing bay platforms, Platforms 3–6.
*There are four tracks on the south side. From north to south, these are:
**A track which is split between Platform 11 (west) and Platform 7 (east).
**Platform 10.
**Platform 9, which is subdivided into &quot;9w&quot; (west) and &quot;9e&quot; (east) sections.
**Platform 8, which is subdivided likewise.
*There are seven west-facing bay platforms, Platforms 12–18.

==Other transport connections==
Although there is currently no direct interchange, the nearest tram stop on the Edinburgh Trams service between Edinburgh Airport and Newhaven is St Andrew Square. The tram stop also serves the adjacent Edinburgh bus station, about 200 metres from Waverley station. Some bus services also stop outside the station at Princes Street while taxi ranks are located outside at Market Street.

==Future developments==
In March 2019, Network Rail announced proposals to redevelop Waverley station in order to meet an anticipated increase in passenger demand by 2048. The Waverley Masterplan drawn up by engineering firm Arup Group envisages the creation of a new mezzanine level concourse above the main platforms to facilitate passenger circulation within the station, with a link through to the neighbouring Waverley Mall shopping centre. As part of the redevelopment, the entrance ramps from Waverley Bridge into the station would be removed and the new concourse would be enclosed in plate glass to provide panoramic views over the Old Town. The plans also make reference to a &quot;transport hub&quot;, although a direct interchange with Edinburgh Trams is not specified.

<doc id="818706" wikidata="Q1159332" url="?curid=818706" title="Dance with a Stranger">
<text>Dance with a Stranger is a 1985 British film directed by Mike Newell. Telling the story of Ruth Ellis, the last woman to be hanged in Britain (1955), the film won critical acclaim, and aided the careers of two of its leading actors, Miranda Richardson and Rupert Everett. The screenplay was by Shelagh Delaney, author of &quot;A Taste of Honey&quot;, and was her third major screenplay. The story of Ellis has resonance in Britain because it provided part of the background to the extended national debates that led to the progressive abolition of capital punishment from 1965.

The theme song, a cover version of Peggy Lee&#x27;s 1951 track &quot;Would You Dance with a Stranger?&quot;, was performed by Mari Wilson and released as a single.

==Plot==
A former nude model and prostitute, Ruth is manageress of a drinking club in London that has racing drivers as its main clients. Ruth lives in a flat above the bar with her illegitimate son Andy. Another child is in the custody of her estranged husband&#x27;s family.

In the club, she meets David, an immature, young man from a well-off family who wants to succeed in motor racing but suffers from lack of money and overuse of alcohol. Ruth falls for his looks and charm, but it is a doomed relationship. Without a job, he cannot afford to marry her, and his family would never accept her. When he makes a drunken scene in the club, she is discharged from her job, which means that she is made homeless.

Desmond, a wealthy admirer, secures a flat for her and her son, but she still sees David. When she tells him she is pregnant, he does nothing about it, and she miscarries. Distraught, she goes to a house in Hampstead where she believes David is at a party. He comes out and goes with a girl to a pub. Ruth waits outside the pub, and when he emerges, she shoots him dead with four shots. She is arrested, tried and hanged.

<text>Marvel Team-Up is an American comic book series published by Marvel Comics. The series featured two or more Marvel characters in one story. The series was originally published from March 1972 through February 1985, and featured Spider-Man as the lead &quot;team-up&quot; character in all but ten of its 150 issues, and in six of its seven &quot;Annual&quot;s. It was the first major ongoing spin-off series for Spider-Man, being preceded only by the short-lived &quot;The Spectacular Spider-Man&quot; magazine. Of the issues that did not star Spider-Man, the Human Torch headlines six issues (#18, 23, 26, 29, 32, 35); the Hulk, four (#97, 104, 105, and &quot;Annual&quot; #3); and Aunt May, one (#137). Publication of most of the issues starring the Human Torch coincided with that of &quot;Giant-Size Spider-Man&quot;, an alternate Spider-Man &quot;team-up&quot;-themed series by the regular &quot;Marvel Team-Up&quot; creative team. When cancelled with #150 in 1985, the title was replaced by &quot;Web of Spider-Man&quot;.

The second series was published for 11 issues from September 1997 through July 1998 and originally featured Spider-Man; Namor the Sub-Mariner was the featured character starting with #8. From 1995 to 1997, a quarterly series titled Spider-Man Team-Up fulfilled much the same purpose as the original title. The third &quot;Marvel Team-Up&quot; series, written by Robert Kirkman, began publication in January 2005 and frequently featured Spider-Man. This volume often reintroduced lesser-known Marvel characters that had fallen into obscurity, in addition to featuring a crossover with Kirkman&#x27;s Image Universe series &quot;Invincible&quot;, which in 2024 would be adapted to the television series adaptation&#x27;s second season.

The spirit of &quot;Marvel Team-Up&quot; was carried on by &quot;Avenging Spider-Man&quot; and later by &quot;Superior Spider-Man Team-Up&quot;.

==Publication history==
Comics journalist Jonathan Miller summarized &quot;Marvel Team-Up&quot; in a retrospective article: 

The series debuted with a March 1972 cover-dated issue featuring Spider-Man and the Human Torch in a story by writer Roy Thomas and artist Ross Andru. Spider-Man and the Human Torch were originally the permanent headliners on the series, but the creators found this format limiting, and after just three issues the Human Torch was dropped in favor of a rotating co-star slot. The main artists on the series for the first several years were Andru, Gil Kane, Sal Buscema, and Jim Mooney.

In 1974, Marvel started publishing &quot;Giant-Size Spider-Man&quot;, which was a quarterly 68-page comic that lasted for six issues which complemented &quot;Marvel Team-Up&quot;. The series featured team-ups, with each issue featuring a new story with a back-up reprint, except the last issue, which only featured a reprint.

Due to the limitations of the typically single-issue team-up stories, the supporting cast of Spider-Man&#x27;s other titles rarely appeared in &quot;Marvel Team-Up&quot;. The series often featured non-superhero characters in the co-star slot. A multi-issue time travel story arc began in issue #41 with Spider-Man and the Scarlet Witch traveling to the Salem witch trials in 1692, and pushed the barriers of continuity by having Spider-Man team up with two characters who had no established connection to the mainstream Marvel Universe, Killraven and Deathlok. Though the series did often team Spider-Man with other highly popular characters, it regularly gave the co-star slot to obscure characters that the average reader was unlikely to even recognize, particularly during writer J. M. DeMatteis&#x27;s run. DeMatteis recounted, &quot;I was always attracted to the more obscure characters, mainly because they were ripe for exploration. You could crack them open and really develop them. … I just looked at these fringe characters as more inviting than the mainstream, more established characters – who all had their set-in-stone continuity. I wanted room to play and those characters gave me all the room I wanted. And let&#x27;s face it, our lead character was as mainstream as you can get, so the obscure ones made for a nice contrast.&quot;

With issue #47, the series had a crossover with &quot;Marvel Two-in-One&quot; #17, which featured the Thing. Jean DeWolff was introduced as a supporting character in the Spider-Man/Iron Man story in issue #48.

John Byrne, who would later become the artist on &quot;The Uncanny X-Men&quot;, first drew the characters in &quot;Marvel Team-Up&quot; #53. Byrne and his &quot;Uncanny X-Men&quot; collaborator, writer Chris Claremont worked together on several issues of &quot;Marvel Team-Up&quot;. Captain Britain, a character created for Marvel UK, made his first appearance in an American comic book in &quot;Marvel Team-Up&quot; #65 (January 1978).

Karma, a character that later joined the New Mutants, was created by Claremont and artist Frank Miller in #100&#x27;s lead story. A photo cover by Eliot R. Brown was used for the Spider-Man/Captain America team-up in issue #128.

Though published for well over a decade, the series format never truly caught on with readers. Upon taking a serious look at sales figures for &quot;Marvel Team-Up&quot;, Marvel&#x27;s editorial staff found that sales dramatically rose or fell with each issue depending solely on the popularity of that issue&#x27;s co-star. Taking this into consideration, Marvel editor-in-chief Jim Shooter concluded that it would make more sense to have another Spider-Man solo series with guest stars appearing when the storyline and/or promotional needs called for it, rather than a team-up series which unnaturally forced guest-stars upon the story. The series ended with issue #150 (February 1985), to be replaced by &quot;Web of Spider-Man&quot;.

A Hulk and the Human Torch story written by Jack C. Harris and drawn by Steve Ditko in the 1980s that was intended for &quot;Marvel Team-Up&quot; was published by Marvel as &quot;Incredible Hulk and the Human Torch: From the Marvel Vault&quot; #1 in August 2011.

&quot;Spider-Man Team-Up&quot; was a brief attempt to revive the concept of the series and was soon followed by &quot;Marvel Team-Up&quot; vol. 2 which was published from September 1997 to July 1998. The third &quot;Marvel Team-Up&quot; series launched in January 2005 and ran for 25 issues which starred a variety of characters. The fourth series began with a June 2019 cover date and contains legacy numbering.

==Adaptation==
The storyline &quot;Spider-Man and Invincible&quot; from &quot;Marvel Team-Up&quot; #14 was loosely adapted to &quot;I Thought You Were Stronger&quot;, the second season finale of the Amazon Prime Video television series adaptation of &quot;Invincible&quot;, which aired April 4, 2024. Due to Amazon and Robert Kirkman not having the rights to adapt any Marvel Universe characters from the issue to the adaptation, Robert Kirkman consulted with Amazon&#x27;s legal department to &quot;figure out a way to keep that moment somewhat intact from the comics&quot;, ultimately creating the legally distinct parody characters &quot;Agent Spider&quot; and &quot;Prof Ock&quot; to replace Spider-Man and Doctor Octopus, with the former to be voiced by &quot;an actor who had done Spider-Man before&quot;. On recommendation of supervising director Dan Duncan, Josh Keaton was cast to voice the parody character, after previously voicing Spider-Man in the animated series &quot;The Spectacular Spider-Man&quot;, the video games &quot;Spider-Man: Shattered Dimensions&quot;, &quot;Marvel vs. Capcom 3&quot; and &quot;Spider-Man: Edge of Time&quot;, and the film &quot;Spider-Man: Across the Spider-Verse&quot; (with the character&#x27;s dialogue in the episode alluding to the latter film franchise&#x27;s events).

<text>The running bowline is a knot consisting of a bowline looped around its own standing end to create a noose. 

The running bowline is strong and secure. It slides easily and can be undone just as simply.

== Tying ==
Tie a bowline in the end of a line with a small loop, and by appearance one then passes the standing part through the loop to form the noose. However, this method of forming the noose is practicable only for a short piece of line. Alternatively, one can tie the bowline tied directly around the standing part or, having tied the bowline first, one would form a bight in the standing part and pull it through the loop of the bowline.&lt;BR&gt;

<text>Macapá () is a city in Brazil with a population of 512,902 (2020 estimate), and is the capital of Amapá state in the country&#x27;s North Region, located on the northern channel of the Amazon Delta near its mouth on the Atlantic Ocean. The city is on a small plateau on the Amazon in the southeast of the state of Amapá. The only access by road from outside the province is from the overseas French department of French Guiana, although there are regular ferries to Belém, Brazil. Macapá is linked by road with some other cities in Amapá. The equator runs through the middle of the city, leading residents to refer to Macapá as &quot;The capital of the middle of the world.&quot; It covers and is located northwest of the large inland island of Marajó and south of the border with French Guiana.

==History==

Macapá is a corruption of the Tupi word &quot;macapaba&quot;, or &quot;place of many bacabas&quot;, the fruit of the local palm tree. The Spaniard Francisco de Orellana claimed the region in 1544 and called it &quot;Nueva Andalucía&quot; (New Andalusia). The modern town began as the base of a Portuguese military detachment, stationed there in 1738. On February 4, 1758, Sebastião Veiga Cabral, the illegitimate child of the military governor of Trás-os-Montes, Sebastião Veiga Cabral, founded the town of São José de Macapá, under the authority of the governor of Pará, Francisco Xavier de Mendonça Furtado. The fortress of São Joselito de Macapá was first laid out in 1764, but took 18 years to complete, due to illness among the Indian workers, and numerous escapes made by black slaves. Macapá experienced an intense hurricane in the Summer of 1811 causing extensive damage to the fortifications there but leaving much of the city intact. Around 1834 Macapá a strange, month-long storm caused flooding upwards of six inches a day for the region. Macapá was elevated to city status in 1854.

Macapá gained international notoriety in December 2001 when international yachtsman Peter Blake, from New Zealand, was murdered while anchored on his explorer yacht &quot;Seamaster&quot; in Macapá port. According to &quot;Business Insider&quot;, Macapá is the 69th most violent city in the world, with 26.06 homicides per 100,000 people.

==Demography==
Macapá has a population of 499,163 in its metropolitan area, the 3rd largest in the North Region. The city alone accounts for sixty percent of the population of state of Amapá and 3.50% of the population of the entire northern region of Brazil. According to the 2010 census, the city has a population of 397,913, of which 97.92% live in urban areas and 2.08% live in rural districts. With an area of , the population density of Macapá is approximately 60.62 inhabitants per km2.

==Transportation==
Macapá has a few roads to other cities in Brazil but is mainly connected to the rest of the country by air and sea. Macapá is located from Belém, but the cities are separated by the large inland island of Marajó and have no direct highway connections; the city is accessible only by boat or airplane. Macapá is connected to French Guiana by the Brazilian federal highway BR-156, which runs north of the city through the Amazonian jungle. The city is connected with the rest of the North Region via the following highways: the AP-010, linking Macapá to Santana to the southwest; the AP-030, linking to the city of Mazagão; the BR-156, linking the south of Amapá and Laranjal do Jari to the northern town of Oiapoque. The Oyapoque River Bridge has been open to traffic since March 20, 2017, linking Brazil and French Guiana by road for the first time.

===Airport===
Macapá International Airport (officially: &quot;Aeroporto Internacional de Macapá – Alberto Alcolumbre&quot;) is located from the city center and serves as a vital link between Macapá and other cities in Brazil. Commercial flights connect Macapá to Belém, Brasília, Fortaleza, Recife Airport, Rio de Janeiro, Salvador, and São Paulo. The airport traces its history to a small air base built by the United States during World War II to secure strategic bases in the South Atlantic region.

==Economy==

Macapá is an economic center of northern Brazil and serves as a commercial hub of the state of Amapá. Gold, iron, lumber, manganese, oil, timber, and tin ore from the interior of the state pass through Amapá on to Port of Santana in the neighboring municipality of Santana.

It is the fifth wealthiest city in northern Brazil, with a GDP of R$2,826,458,000 (2005). The city has a notably high rate of economic growth and a per capita income of R$7,950 (2005).

==Education==
Portuguese is the official national language, and the primary language taught in schools. English and French are also part of the official high school curriculum.

===Educational institutions===
* Universidade Federal do Amapá (UNIFAP)
* Universidade Estadual do Amapá (UEAP)
* Instituto Federal do Amapá (IFAP)
* Faculdade de Macapá (Fama)
* Faculdade de Tecnologia do Amapá (META)
* Instituto Macapaense do Melhor Ensino Superior (IMMES)
* Faculdade Seama

==Landmarks==

===Fortress of St. Joseph=== 

The fortress of St. Joseph is a Vauban-style star fort built between 1764 and 1782 to replace two previous fortifications located in the city. It was built to safeguard the northern extremity of Brazil and to control the Amazon Delta. It is one of the main sights of the city of Macapa.

===Marco Zero monument===
The was built to mark the position of the equator in the city and to show the passage of the sun. At the spring and the autumn equinox the sun rises and sets on the line of the equator and shines on the monument along the Avenue Equatorial, which runs for a mile due east of it. 
===Milton Corrêa stadium===
The &quot;Estádio Milton Corrêa&quot;, usually known as the &quot;Zerão&quot; (&quot;Big Zero&quot;, from its position with the midfield line exactly on the equator), is a multi-purpose stadium located in central Macapá on the R. Ilvaldo Alves Veras east of the university (UNIFAP).
The stadium has a maximum capacity of 10,000 people and was built in 1990.
It is used mostly for football matches and hosts the home matches of several local teams.

==Geography==
The municipality contains the Parazinho Biological Reserve, created in 1985 to protect an island in the Amazon River.
It contains the Rio Curiaú Environmental Protection Area, created in 1992 to protect an area near the urban center from city sprawl, and to protect the culture of the traditional inhabitants.
It contains the Fazendinha Environmental Protection Area, created in 2004.

===Climate===
The Macapá region includes large tracts of tropical rainforest and experiences relatively high rainfall. Macapá features a tropical monsoon climate (&quot;Am&quot;) under the Köppen climate classification, with a lengthy wet season from December through July, and a relatively short dry season that covers the remaining four months. However, a noticeable amount of rain is observed even during the dry season, a trait common to a number of other areas with this climate. Average temperatures are relatively consistent throughout the year, hovering around in the mornings and in the afternoon.

===Subdivisions===

The municipality is subdivided in five districts:
* Macapá, the city proper
* Bailique
* Carapanantuba
* Fazendinha

In 1992, the villages of Curiaú de Dentro, Curiaú de Fora, Casa Grande, Curralinho and Mocambo in the municipality of Macapá were recognised as &quot;quilombos&quot;, settlements by escaped slaves, resulting in the establishment of the Rio Curiaú Environmental Protection Area.

<doc id="818755" wikidata="Q2914153" url="?curid=818755" title="Amotivational syndrome">
<text>Amotivational syndrome is a chronic psychiatric disorder characterized by signs that are linked to cognitive and emotional states such as detachment, blunted emotion and drives, executive functions like memory and attention, disinterest, passivity, apathy, and a general lack of motivation. This syndrome can be branched into two subtypes: marijuana amotivational syndrome, or cannabis-induced amotivational syndrome, which is caused by usage of or dependency on that substance, and is primarily associated with long-term effects of cannabis use, and SSRI-induced amotivational syndrome or SSRI-induced apathy, caused by the intake of SSRI medication dosage. According to the Handbook of Clinical Psychopharmacology for Therapists, amotivational syndrome is listed as a possible side effect of SSRIs in the treatment of clinical depression. It is a disorder of diminished motivation.

==Signs and symptoms==
Amotivational syndrome has been suspected to affect the frontal cortex or frontal lobe of the brain by the impairment of that region which monitors cognitive functions and skills that revolve around emotional expression, decision making, prioritisation, and internal, purposeful mental action. It is most often detected through signs that are linked to apathy such as disinhibited presentations, short and long term memory deficit or amnesia, a lack of emotional display also known as emotional blunting, relative disinterest, passivity, and reluctance to participate in prolonged activities that require attention or tenacity. Common symptoms that may also be experienced include incoherence, an inability to concentrate on tasks, emotional distress, a diminished level of consciousness, selective attention or attentional control, and being withdrawn and asocial. These symptoms are also generally linked to cannabis consumption and abuse, as well as SSRI medication that are often used as forms of antidepressant medication.

==Subtypes==

===Cannabis amotivational syndrome===
The term amotivational syndrome was first devised to understand and explain the diminished drive and desire to work or compete among the population of youth who are frequent consumers of cannabis and has since been researched through various methodological studies with this focus on cannabis, or marijuana. Cannabis amotivational syndrome is often used interchangeably with marijuana amotivational syndrome and marijuana or cannabis induced or related amotivational syndrome. Cannabis related amotivational syndrome is closely tied with cannabis use disorder which is recognized in the fifth version of the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM-5) and has similar conditions such as withdrawing and giving up from daily activities and neglecting major roles and responsibilities. It is one of the major complications of chronic exposure to cannabis as it includes the effects and elements of cognitive deficit or cognitive impairment that are similar to what appears in schizophrenia and depression. It is characterized by a gradual detachment and disconnect from the outer world due to a loss of emotional reactivity, drives, and aims. Responsiveness to any stimuli is limited, and those affected are unable to experience or anticipate any pleasure except through the use of cannabis. Marijuana amotivational syndrome has been looked at within the context of how motivation-related constructs influence the young adult in the context of the school or workplace as those affected have poor levels of school-related functioning, are unable to focus on schoolwork due to their lack of motivation, are less satisfied with participating in educational activities, and easily enter into conflict with scholastic authorities. Additionally, marijuana amotivational syndrome is closely linked to self-efficacy, a psychological concept which encapsulates how one values their capabilities and the amount of confidence they hold in their capabilities to persevere - this is related to motivation as people who hold a high amount of self-efficacy are more likely to make efforts to complete a task and persist longer in those efforts compared to those with lower self-efficacy.

===SSRI-induced amotivational syndrome===
Amotivational syndrome caused or related to SSRI dosage is also commonly known as apathy syndrome, SSRI-induced apathy syndrome, SSRI-induced apathy, and antidepressant apathy syndrome. &quot;Apathy is defined as the presence of diminished motivation in an individual - a development that is not attributable to a reduced level of consciousness, cognitive impairment (e.g., dementia), or emotional distress (i.e., depression)&quot;. This syndrome is linked to the consumption and dosage of selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs), which are typically used as antidepressants, and has been reported in patients undergoing SSRI treatment as SSRIs may modulate and alter the activity occurring in the frontal lobe of the brain, one of the four major lobes in the brain that contains most of the dopaminergic pathways that are associated with reward, attention, short-term memory tasks, planning, and motivation. This syndrome may be related to serotonergic effects on the frontal lobes and/or serotonergic modulation of mid-brain dopaminergic systems which project to the prefrontal cortex, both suggesting the possibility of frontal lobe dysfunction due to the alteration of serotonin levels. This brings on a number of similar symptoms that lead to dose dependency and apathy, however, it has often been unrecognized and undiagnosed due to the lack of prevalent data and its subtle and delayed onset. When looking at SSRI-induced amotivational syndrome as a clinical side effect, it can be looked at through a behavioural perspective as well as an emotional perspective. When looked at as a behavioural syndrome the association between apathy or low motivation and SSRI prescription has been recognized as a potential side effect, for example, behavioural apathy has been noted in several case reports. Aside from a behavioural perspective, an emotional perspective emphasizes the emotional aspects of indifference such as a lack of emotional responsiveness, a reduction in emotional sensitivity such as numbing or blunting emotion, affected patients often describe having a restricted range of emotions including those emotions that are a part of everyday life, and distinct emotional themes in affected patience that include a general reduction in the intensity or experience of all emotions, both positive and negative, and feeling emotionally detached and &quot;just not caring&quot;, diminishing emotionality in both personal and professional interpersonal relationships.

==Treatment and evaluation==
===Cannabis amotivational syndrome===
Treatment of cannabis amotivational syndrome is like the treatment for cannabis dependence in which there should be careful evaluation for any signs of depression that predate the development of the amotivational syndrome and may be the basis for cannabis dependence and usage. The user is slowly weaned off usage through urine monitoring, self-help groups, education, and therapy in different treatment settings such as group, family, and individual therapy in order to separate themselves from cannabis consumption and any cannabis-related environment as both contribute to the cognitive aspects of amotivational syndrome.

===SSRI-induced amotivational syndrome===
Treatments include gradually reducing or discontinuing the SSRI, changing the SSRI to another antidepressant class, or co-prescribing with the SSRI a medication that boosts dopamine, such as the antidepressant bupropion.

==Current research and discourse==

===Cannabis amotivational syndrome===
Though there is a prevalent relationship between cannabis consumption and amotivational syndrome, there is still some considerable debate that exists around cannabis consumption causing amotivational syndrome meaning that it may not be a single entity but rather a collection of behaviors that form the result of a combination of effects of an already existent or reactive depression that occurs alongside cannabis’s ability to facilitate a unique attention state. Trait absorption is often mentioned within discourses surrounding cannabis-induced amotivational syndrome and it states that the traits associated with a large majority of marijuana users, which are similar to traits found in those who have amotivational syndrome, such as boredom and a general feeling of disconnect, are absorbed and taken up by the cannabis user. It is used as a common argument against cannabis potentially being able to cause amotivational syndrome, instead, many cannabis users have stated that users often absorb what is often thought of as the typical set of traits marijuana consumers possess, which overlap with some of the traits found in amotivational syndrome. As a result, many have proposed that rather than cannabis being thought of as a psychologically harmful substance, it is instead thought of as an active placebo in which its effects on the mind are placebo effects in response to minimal physiological action rather than being a direct cause of the psychological changes seen in users.

Additionally, though research has been conducted, it is recognized that there is not enough substantial empirical research to conclude that the use of cannabis leads to amotivational syndrome. Anecdotal information such as statements taken from cannabis users includes feeling listless and lethargic. Amotivational syndrome still ranks high among the key problems associated with the drug, with researchers having adopted the phrase &quot;amotivational&quot; to describe lethargic cannabis users. The US Department of Health and Human Services also warns that usage in youth may result in amotivational symptoms such as an apathetic approach to life, fatigue, and poor academic and work performance. However, empirical research on the effects of cannabis on users’ motivation implies that there is no strong correlation and that there are numerous alternative explanations of these negative outcomes as a review of laboratory performance research, education data, and employment statistics fail to offer consistent evidence that directly link cannabis to any symptoms associated with amotivational syndrome. Though several studies contain data in which heavy cannabis users have reported feeling a lack of motivation, it has also been acknowledged that other variables such as comorbid drug use and baselines for low motivation may not be examined.

=== Cannabis amotivational syndrome controversy ===
There is directly conflicting evidence as to whether or not cannabis amotivational syndrome is real. A 2024 study found that cannabis had no effect on motivation. Participants in this study demonstrated &quot;the same willingness to exert effort on tasks while high as when they were not&quot;. Cannabis use did however led to &quot;decreased self-regulation, making users more impulsive and less orderly&quot;, which could be mistaken for amotivational syndrome.

===SSRI-induced amotivational syndrome===
Most research in psychological fields regarding amotivational syndrome caused by SSRI treatment has revolved around case studies and anecdotal reports to understand how SSRI medication influences levels of motivation and apathy in patients. There is considerable overlap in the clinical presentations of apathy and amotivation and depression. Many patients with amotivational or apathy syndrome reported that they felt a lack of motivation that was unlike what they had sometimes experienced during previous episodes or depression, or that their feelings of apathy had no link to depression. Apathy syndrome has also been reported in a number of patients that have received or are receiving selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI) treatment over the last decade, which has also been linked to a deficit in the performance and activities of daily living, signaling a functional decline. It is a common behavioural problem that often goes undiagnosed and untreated, which is why it is considered to be clinical significant. Neuropsychological research has shown that a common feature of amotivational syndrome involves the presence of lesions and other abnormalities in the circulation of the frontal lobe. Neuroimaging studies of clinical populations have also reported correlations between apathy and structural and functional changes in the frontal lobe in the anterior cingulate gyrus and subregions of the basal ganglia. Recent case-control studies have also reported that apathy has appeared to be greater in patients who were treated with SSRI medication compared to patients who were not. Current findings are consistent with other findings supporting the correlation of SSRI and apathy due to the occurrence of abnormalities found within various regions of the frontal lobe. Though amotivational syndrome has been an emerging concern for pharmacotherapeutic industries to consider, there is still a growing body of empirical investigations that need to continue in order for the development of novel therapeutic interventions to improve, as well as treatment. Currently, empirical studies are limited and there is not a substantial enough amount of research to fully understand the link between frontal lobe abnormalities caused by SSRIs and thus resulting in amotivational syndrome. There is a lack of large-scale clinical studies that focus on the prevalence of SSRI-induced amotivational syndrome with regards to emotional blunting and apathy in both psychiatric or primary care populations, despite the high prescription rates for SSRI medication. There are also no current clinically popular scales to measure and assess SSRI-induced apathy. The Oxford Questionnaire of Emotional Side Effects of Antidepressants (OQESA) is a scale under development and presents a 26-item, Likert-style, self-report scale that aims to understand respondents’ emotional experiences such as a general reduction in emotions, a reduction in positive emotions, emotional detachment and blunting, and feelings of not caring. Respondents are also asked to what extent they believe their antidepressant is responsible for these emotional symptoms.

<text>Maceió (), formerly sometimes Anglicised as Maceio, is the capital and the largest city of the coastal state of Alagoas, Brazil. The name &quot;Maceió&quot; is an Indigenous term for a spring.

Most maceiós flow to the sea, but some get trapped and form lakes (&quot;lagoas&quot;, in Portuguese). There are numerous maceiós and lakes in this part of Brazil; because of this, the city was named Maceió, and the state, Alagoas. The new Zumbi dos Palmares International Airport connects Maceió with many Brazilian cities and also operates some international flights. The city is home to the Federal University of Alagoas.

==Etymology==
The name &quot;Maceió&quot; has origin in the term &quot;tupi maçayó&quot; or &quot;maçaio-k&quot;, that means &quot;what it covers the swamp&quot;. The Aurélio Dictionary says that the term &quot;maceió&quot; means a temporary and cyclic lagoon that is located at the edge of the sea at the mouth of a watercourse small enough to be interrupted by a silicate bar until the high tide opens the way temporarily cyclically related to the season, river flow, lunar seasons, etc.

Nineteenth-century shipping reports, which reported on ships bringing cotton from Maceió, spelt it as Macaio.

==History==

The city began in an old sugar mill and plantation complex around the 19th century. Its development started with the arrival of ships taking wood from Jaraguá bay.

With the installation of the sugar mills, Maceió started to export sugar, then tobacco, coconut, leather, and some spices. Prosperity made it possible for the settlement to become a village on December 5, 1815. Thanks to its continued growth, Maceió became the capital of the Alagoas state on December 9, 1839.

Maceió is also a port city and due to its port development about 200 years ago it changed from a village into a city.

==Geography==
The city is located between the Mundaú Lagoon and the Atlantic Ocean, with a tropical climate with average temperature of . , its metropolitan area had a total population of 1,354,973 inhabitants.

=== Climate ===
Maceió has a typical tropical climate, specifically a tropical monsoon climate (Köppen climate classification: &quot;Am&quot;, somewhat bordering on &quot;As&quot;), with very warm to hot temperatures and high relative humidity all throughout the year. However, these conditions are relieved by a near absence of extreme temperatures and trade winds blowing from the ocean.

January is the warmest month, with mean maximum of and minimum of and more sun; July experiences the coolest temperatures, with mean maximum of and minimum of accompanied by higher humidity and much more rain.

The natural vegetation surrounding Maceió is tropical rainforest. Rainforests are characterized by high rainfall, with definitions setting minimum normal annual rainfall between . The soil can be poor because high rainfall tends to leach out soluble nutrients.

==Economy==
One substantial local industry is based on chemical products from brine pumped from deep wells on the outskirts of Maceió. Another substantial industry is the production of ethanol and sugar from sugarcane grown in the region. In the last thirty years the tourist industry has transformed the coastal areas of the city into vibrant centers of entertainment for Brazilian and foreign tourists (Americans, Italians, French, Germans, Argentinians, etc.).

These coastal neighborhoods include coconut palm trees, playgrounds, squares, open-to-the-public football, volleyball, and basketball fields, residential buildings, bars, nightclubs, tourist-oriented shops, restaurants, banks, hotels, and gambling houses (slot machines and bingo only, since casino games are illegal in Brazil).

The GDP for the city was R$23,400,000,000 (); The per capita income for the city was R$22,976.51 ().

Strong point in the municipality&#x27;s economy is tourism. Maceió has a great potential to attract tourists due to its natural beauties and great cultural diversity. In addition, Maceió offers several leisure options and modern spaces for business, such as the new Cultural and Exhibition Center of Maceió, in the Jaraguá District. In September 2005, the new Zumbi dos Palmares International Airport, one of the most modern in Brazil, was inaugurated. The Jaraguá neighborhood was very popular during the end of the 1990s, with large investments by the Maceió prefecture. Nowadays, the Jaraguá is a commercial district, equipped with banks, museums, pubs and colleges. Nordeste Invest, an event of tourism and real estate investments of international scope, happened in Maceió in the editions of years 2006 and 2009.

===Festa Junina===
Festa Junina was introduced to Northeastern Brazil by the Portuguese for whom St John&#x27;s day (also celebrated as Midsummer Day in several European countries), on June 24, is one of the oldest and most popular celebrations of the year. Differently from what happens on the European Midsummer Day, the festivities in Brazil do not take place during the summer solstice but during the southern hemisphere winter solstice. The festivities traditionally begin after June 12, on the eve of St Anthony&#x27;s day, and last until the 29th, which is Saint Peter&#x27;s day. During these fifteen days, there are bonfires, fireworks, and folk dancing in the streets (step names are in French, which shows the mutual influences between court life and peasant culture in the 17th, 18th, and 19th-century Europe). Typical refreshments and dishes are served. Like during Carnival, these festivities involve costumes-wearing (in this case, peasant costumes), dancing, heavy drinking, and visual spectacles (fireworks display and folk dancing). Like what happens on Midsummer and St John&#x27;s Day in Europe, bonfires are a central part of these festivities in Brazil.

This is a typical Alagoas revelry that resulted from the union of Reisado (an Epiphany celebration), Auto dos Caboclinhos (Caboclinhos&#x27; Play), Chegança (public folk play depicting a naval battle) and Pastoril (outdoor folk play). Its choreography and costumes with colored ribbons and beads reproduce the cathedral&#x27;s façades on the monumental hats covered with mirrors.

This is a dramatic dance motivated by the sea. It tells the sea adventures of the first navigators in its songs accompanied by guitar and ukulele.

Boi do Carnaval is a popular culture display derived from Bumba-Meu-Boi. It is always presented together with La Ursa (The Bear), Vaqueiro (Cowboy) and a percussion band whose rhythm captivates everyone that hears it.

Gogó da Ema was a famous palm tree with a crooked trunk roughly shaped like a curvilinear letter &quot;N&quot;. The tree fell on July 27, 1955, at 2:20 in the afternoon. It has become a symbol for Maceian culture and tourism, and there is a beach named after the celebrated tree. The tree also appears in folkloric art and music throughout northeastern Brazil.

==Main sights==

Maceió is home to numerous beaches, the color of sea varying from emerald green to blue; the water is always clear. The sand is white and there are many coconut plantations.

The Maceió sea has natural pools and reefs a few meters off the coast, that can be accessed by boat or raft sailings. The Mundaú lake is another option for sailing and bathing in transparent water.

Historical buildings include the Cathedral of Our Lady of Pleasures (1840), the Deodoro Theatre, the Municipal Market, the Historical Institute Museum and the Floriano Peixoto Palace, seat of Alagoas State government.

==Food==
Gastronomy include fishes, shrimps, crabs and lobsters are some of Maceió&#x27;s specialties. Fresh seafood is prepared from local recipes, such as tapioca, acaraje, carne-de-sol, cuscuz de tapioca. A kind of mollusk, the sururu, is appreciated in the city and is incorporated in many typical dishes.

==Transportation==

===International Airport===
Zumbi dos Palmares International Airport located outside Maceió serves the area with international connections to Lisbon in Portugal and Buenos Aires in Argentina, as well as cities throughout Brazil.

In 2021 the airport handled 1,893,812 passengers.

===Port===
The Port of Jaraguá is a Brazilian port located in Maceió. The commercial and economic development of the Port of Jaraguá, next to the margins of the Mundaú lagoon, was responsible for the emergence of an important settlement that received the name of Maceió and later became the present capital of Alagoas. The Port of Jaraguá is situated in a natural port area that facilitates the ships docking. During the Brazilian colonial period, the most important products exported from there port were sugar, tobacco, coconut and spices. The Biggest Cruise Ship to attract at port was MSC Seashore in 2022.

<text>Lotus Cortina is the commonly used term for the Ford Cortina Lotus, a high-performance sports saloon, which was produced in the United Kingdom from 1963 to 1970 by Ford in collaboration with Lotus Cars. The original version, which was based on the Ford Cortina Mark 1, was promoted by Ford as the &quot;Consul Cortina developed by Lotus&quot;, with &quot;Consul&quot; later being dropped from the name. The Mark 2 was based on the Ford Cortina Mark II and was marketed by Ford as the &quot;Cortina Lotus&quot;. Lotus gave the model the type number designation Type 28.

There were 3,306 Mark I and 4,093 Mark 2 Lotus Cortinas produced.

==Mk1==
The history of the Cortina Lotus began in 1961. Colin Chapman had been wishing to build his own engines for Lotus, mainly because the Coventry Climax unit was so expensive. Colin Chapman&#x27;s chance came when he commissioned Harry Mundy (a close friend and designer of the Coventry Climax engine and technical editor for &quot;Autocar&quot;) to design a twin-cam version of the Ford Kent engine. Most of the development of the engine was done on the 997cc and 1,340cc bottom end, but in 1962 Ford released the 116E five bearing 1,498 cc engine and work centred on this. Keith Duckworth, from Cosworth, played an important part in tuning of the engine. The engine&#x27;s first appearance was in 1962 at the Nürburgring in a Lotus 23 driven by Jim Clark. Almost as soon as the engine appeared in production cars (Lotus Elan), it was replaced with a larger capacity unit (82.55 mm bore to give 1,557 cc). This was in order to get the car closer to the 1.6 litre capacity class in motorsport.

Whilst the engine was being developed, Walter Hayes (Ford) asked Colin Chapman if he would fit the engine to 1,000 Ford saloons for Group 2 homologation. Chapman quickly accepted, although it must have been very busy in the Cheshunt plant, with the Elan about to be launched. The Type 28 or Lotus Cortina or Cortina Lotus (as Ford liked to call it) was duly launched. Ford supplied the 2-door Cortina bodyshells and took care of all the marketing and selling of the cars, whilst Lotus did all the mechanical and cosmetic changes. The major changes involved installing the 1,557 cc () engine, together with the same close-ratio gearbox as the Elan. The rear suspension was drastically altered and lightweight alloy panels were used for doors, bonnet and boot. Lightweight casings were fitted to gearbox and differential. All the Lotus factory cars were painted white with a green stripe (although Ford built some for racing in red, and one customer had a dark blue stripe due to being superstitious about green). The cars also received front quarter bumpers and round Lotus badges were fitted to rear wings and to the right side of the radiator grille.

Interior modifications were limited to a centre console designed to accommodate the new gear lever position, different seats and the later style dashboard, featuring tachometer, speedometer, oil pressure, water temperature and fuel level gauges. A wood-rimmed steering wheel was fitted.

The suspension changes to the car were quite extensive; the car received shorter struts up front, forged track control arms and 5.5J by 13 steel wheel rims. The rear was even more radical with vertical coil spring/dampers replacing the leaf springs and two trailing arms with a A- bracket (which connected to the differential housing and brackets near the trailing arm pivots) sorting out axle location. To support this set-up, further braces were put behind the rear seat and from the rear wheelarch down to chassis in the boot. The stiffening braces meant that the spare wheel had to be moved from the standard Cortina&#x27;s wheel well and was bolted to the left side of the boot floor. The battery was also relocated to the boot, behind the right wheelarch. Both of these changes made big improvements to overall weight distribution. Another improvement the Cortina Lotus gained was the new braking system ( front discs) which were built by brake specialist Girling. This system also was fitted to Cortina GTs but without a servo, which was fitted in the Cortina Lotus engine bay.

Initially, the engines were built by J. A. Prestwich of Tottenham and then Villiers of Wolverhampton. In 1966, Lotus moved to Hethel in Norwich where they had their own engine building facilities. The Cortina Lotus used a diaphragm-spring clutch, whereas Ford fitted coil-spring clutches to the rest of the range. The remainder of the gearbox was identical to the Lotus Elan. This led to a few problems because although the ultra-close gear ratios were perfect for the race track or open road, the clutch was given a hard time in traffic: the ratios were later changed.

The early cars were very popular and earned some rave reviews; one magazine described the car as a tin-top version of a Lotus 7. It was &#x27;THE car&#x27; for many enthusiasts who before had to settle for a Cortina GT or a Mini-Cooper and it also amazed a lot of the public who were used to overweight &#x27;sports cars&#x27; like the Austin-Healey 3000. The launch was not perfect however, the car was too specialist for some Ford dealerships who did not understand the car; there are a few stories of incorrect parts being fitted at services. There were a few teething problems reported by the first batch of owners, (most of these problems show how quickly the car was developed) some of the engines were down on power, the gear ratios were too close and the worst problem was the differential housing coming away from the casing. This problem was mainly caused by the high loads put on the axle because of the A bracket it was an integral part of the rear suspension. This was made even worse by the fact any oil lost from the axle worked its way on to the bushes of the A bracket. There were four main updates made to the Mk1 Lotus during its production to solve some of these problems. The first change was a swap to a two-piece prop shaft and the lighter alloy transmission casing was changed to the standard Ford item; this also included swapping the ultra-close ratio gears for Cortina GT gear ratios, the main difference being that first, second and reverse were much lower (numerically higher) ratios. From 1964, standard steel panels were used rather than the light alloy ones, though alloy items and ultra-close ratios could still be specified when buying a new car.

The second main change came in late 1964 when the entire Cortina range had a facelift which included a full-width front grille and ventilation outlets on the rear C-pillar - because the Cortina Lotus also gained Ford&#x27;s new Aeroflow system as well as an update to the interior. The third and probably most important change came in mid-1965, when the Lotus rear suspension was changed for the leaf springs and radius arms of the Cortina GT. This replaced all the stiffening tubing as well. The last update also came in 1965 when the rear drums were swapped for self-adjusting items and also the famous 2000E gearbox ratios were used. These lowered first and reverse about halfway between the Cortina GT ratios and the ultra close-ratio box. All these changes made the cars less specialised but far more reliable and all the special parts were still available for competition as well as to members of the public.

The Cortina Lotus had by this time earned an impressive competition reputation. It was also being made in left hand drive when production finished around late 1966 and the Mk2 took over.
==Mk2==
Ford wanted to change a few things for the Mk2, the Mk1 had done all and more than they could expect in competition, but the public linked its competition wins with Lotus and its bad points with Ford. Ford still wanted to build a Mk2 Lotus and compete with it, but Lotus were moving from Cheshunt to Hethel so it was a bad time for them to build another model. Ford were also concerned with the unreliability of the Lotus built cars, so a decision was made at Ford that to continue with its competition drive and make the car more cost effective they would make the car at Dagenham themselves, alongside the other Cortina models. In order to do this the Mk2 had to be much easier to build than the Mk1 so that it could be made alongside Mk2 GT production, just with a different engine and suspension. The Mk2 took a while to appear, first appearing in 1967. The main difference was the choice of colours and the lack of a stripe, although most had them fitted at Ford dealers at extra cost. The only cosmetic changes made were a black front grille, 5.5J x 13 steel wheels and Lotus badges on rear wings and by the rear number plate. The badge on the front grille was an option at first. Unlike the Mk1, the Mk2 was also made in left hand drive from the start of production. The Mk2 Cortina Lotus also gained an improved and more powerful () engine, which was formerly supplied as the special equipment engine option on Lotus Elan and the Cortina Lotus Mk1. The gearbox ratios remained 2000E ones but the car now used the Mk2 GT remote-control gearchange. The car also had a different final drive of 3.77:1 rather than 3.9:1. The Mk2 was a wider car than the Mk1, so although they looked the same, the steel wheels had a different offset so as not to upset the tracking, and radial tyres were now standard. Another attraction was the larger fuel tank. The spare wheel could now be mounted in its wheel well, but the battery remained in the boot to aid weight distribution.

The only real difference to the engine bay was the air cleaner mounted on top of the engine. The interior was almost identical to a GT. The Mk2 did exactly what Ford wanted, it was far more reliable whilst still quick enough to be used in competition, until it was replaced by the Escort Twin Cam. The car did receive a few updates, but none as urgent as the Mk1&#x27;s. Only a few months after production started, the Lotus badge on the rear panel was cancelled and a new TWIN CAM badge was fitted under the Cortina script on the boot lid. Despite the badge changes, Ford UK continued to market the model as the &quot;Cortina Lotus&quot;. The new combined clock and centre console was fitted. In late 1968 the entire Mk2 range received some cosmetic changes; for the Lotus, this meant that the 4 dials on top of the dash were brought down and made part of the dash. An internal bonnet release and a more conventional mounting for the handbrake were also phased in. A new single-rail gearshift mechanism was used. The car stayed in production until 1970.

The Cortina Lotus was marketed in Europe as the Cortina Twin Cam in 1969/70.

Two 4-door versions were supplied to the Mid-Anglia Constabulary for evaluation as use as a fast patrol and pursuit car by British Police forces. The trial never went beyond the two vehicles, which are both still in existence.

==Racing==
To homologate the car for Group 2 Touring Car racing, 1000 were required to be built in 1963, and the car was duly homologated in September 1963. In the same month, in the car&#x27;s first outing, in the Oulton Park Gold Cup, the car finished 3rd and 4th behind two Ford Galaxies, but beat the 3.8-litre Jaguars which had been dominant in saloon car racing for so long. Soon Ford were running cars in Britain, Europe, and the US, with Team Lotus running cars in Britain for Ford, and Alan Mann Racing running cars in Europe, also on behalf of Ford. The Cortina Lotus was able to beat almost anything except the 7-litre V8 Ford Galaxies, and later, Ford Mustangs.

In 1964, a Cortina Lotus leading around a bend with its inside front wheel in fresh air became a familiar sight, as the cars were set up with soft rear suspension and a hard front end. Jim Clark won the British Saloon Car Championship easily, in the US, Jackie Stewart and Mike Beckwith won the Malboro 12-hour, and Alan Mann Racing also performed well in the European Touring Car Challenge, including a 1–2 victory in the &#x27;Motor&#x27; Six Hour International Touring Car Race at Brands Hatch. A Boreham-built car also won its class, came 4th outright, and won the handicap section, in the 4000 mile 10-day Tour de France. Other Cortina Lotus achievements included the Austrian Saloon Car Championship, the South African National Saloon Championship, the Swedish Ice Championship, and the Wills Six-Hour in New Zealand.

1965 saw the Cortina Lotus winning regularly, the car being more competitive due to the increased reliability of the new leaf spring rear end. Driving for Alan Mann Racing, Sir John Whitmore dominated and won the European Touring Car Championship in KPU-392C, Jack Sears won his class in the British Saloon Car Championship (a Mustang won outright), Jackie Ickx won the Belgian Saloon Car Championship, and a Cortina Lotus won the New Zealand Gold Star Saloon Car Championship. Other wins were the Nürburgring Six-Hour race, the Swedish National Track Championship, and the Snetterton 500.

In 1966, Team Lotus registered new cars for the British Saloon Car Championship, which was now open to Group 5 Special Touring Cars, as regulations had been changed. Fuel-injection and dry sumping were allowed, and with Lucas injection and tuning by BRM, the engines could produce at 7750 rpm, increasing their ability to stay with the Mustangs. The cars also had the MacPherson struts replaced with coil springs and shock absorbers and a revised wishbone geometry. They scored 8 class wins, many driven by Jim Clark. In the European Touring Car Challenge, Sir John Whitmore scored another four wins, not enough to give him the title, being beaten by Alfa Romeo Giulia GTAs.

Cortina Lotus Mark 1&#x27;s are a consistent class winner in modern Historic Touring Car racing throughout the world. The fastest official recorded speed is at Mount Panorama Bathurst in Australia by Marc Ducquet. The recorded speed by radar on Conrod Straight was 143 mph. The car was owned by Bob Pearson and had a 203HP Twin Cam engine built by Randall Edgell in New Zealand. 185/60-13 Radial tyres, 4.3 differential and 9,500 RPM. Considering the relatively low horsepower of the standard pushrod GT500 Cortina and the Lightweight alloy panelled Cortina Lotus this speed is achievable. For example, the legendary Australian driver &quot;Gelignite Jack&quot; Murray driving a Cortina GT500 - Australia&#x27;s answer to the Cortina Lotus produced to comply with the local build requirements to be able to be raced of 100 units; initial batch 122, as opposed to running the Cortina Lotus which would have been imported with a minimum requirement of 250 - built by and intended for Harry Firth in the 1965 Bathurst 500 was clocked at 118 mph down Conrod Straight using a 3.9 diff, Lotus gearbox, large diameter (non radial) tyres and 7,900 rpm.

The Cortina is well known in the US for its competitiveness in the under 2000 cc class of the Trans Am Series. Canadian born Australian Allan Moffat shocked the outright class cars, winning Round 3 of the inaugural series in 1966 at the Bryar Motorsports Park in Loudon, New Hampshire.

==Rallying==
Whilst the Cortina Lotus is somewhat overshadowed by the success of the Ford Escort in rallying, it performed admirably in the mid-1960s, which might be surprising, given its reputation for unreliability. The first Cortina Lotus to be rallied was a Cortina GT with the Lotus engine, in the 1963 Spa-Sofia-Liege rally in September, just to try out the engine, and driven by Henry Taylor to 4th place. The first outing in a rally by a Cortina Lotus proper was in the 1963 RAC Rally, campaigned again by Taylor, with co-driver Brian Melia. It finished 6th somehow, in spite of its A-bracket rear end needing constant attention. The A-bracket was persevered with by Vic Elford and David Seigle-Morris for the 1964 Tour de France Automobile, a 10-day, event, as it was run completely on sealed roads, unlike the rough RAC Rally. Their car came 4th outright in the Touring Car category, and first in the Handicap category, in a mix of one-hour sprints, hillclimbs, and mountain road rallying.

Still, the general dodginess of the A-bracket suspension meant that Ford decided to replace it with the more conventional GT rear suspension. This became available in June 1965, and while the car still seemed to be afflicted with bad luck, a few victories were racked up. Four of the newly updated cars competed in the Alpine rally of July 1965, and Vic Elford&#x27;s car led outright, all the way. Well, until less than an hour from finishing, when a piece of the distributor fell out and delayed the car 26 minutes. All four cars retired from that year&#x27;s RAC rally, which was severely snow-affected. The first works victory came in December 1965, when Roger Clark and Graham Robson won the Welsh International.

In 1966, Ford managed to homologate the car for Group 1, which requires 5000 cars to be built. In the Monte Carlo Rally, Roger Clark finished 4th, only to be disqualified, and then Elford finished 1st in the Rallye Sanremo (Rally of the Flowers), only to be disqualified as well. Elford came 2nd in the Tulip Rally. Bengt Söderström was named victor of the Acropolis Rally, after the 1st-placed Mini Cooper S was disqualified. New cars were used for the Coupe des Alpes (Alpine Rally), where Elford&#x27;s engine blew up after leading, while Roger Clark finished second. Clark was always competitive, but suffered with unreliable cars, coming 3rd in the Canadian Shell 4000, 2nd in Greece, and 4th in Poland. The Cortina Lotus finally proved itself with an outright win in the RAC rally. F1 World Champion Jim Clark crashed his (twice), but Söderström saw his through to a 13-minute victory, with Gunnar Palm. Other victories in 1966 were in the Geneva rally by Staepelaere, and by Canadian Paul MacLellan in the Shell 4000. A final win before the advent of the Mk. II was also pulled off by Söderström in the snowy Swedish Rally of February 1967.Australian rally driver Harry Firth did win the first edition of the Australian Rally Championship in 1968 with the Lotus Cortina.

<text>Patricia Castle Richardson (born February 23, 1951) is an American actress best known for her portrayal of Jill Taylor on the ABC sitcom &quot;Home Improvement&quot;, for which she was nominated four times for the Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Lead Actress in a Comedy Series and twice for the Golden Globe Award for Best Actress in a Television Series – Comedy or Musical. She also received an Independent Spirit Award nomination for her performance in &quot;Ulee&#x27;s Gold&quot; (1997).

==Early life and education==
Richardson attended multiple schools including Holton-Arms School and Hockaday School. She is a 1972 graduate of Southern Methodist University, where she was friends with classmates Beth Henley and Stephen Tobolowsky, who was slated to be a cast member of &quot;Home Improvement&quot;, but had other contractual commitments when the series began filming. Tobolowsky initially suggested to producers of &quot;Home Improvement&quot; that Richardson be considered for the role of Jill Taylor after Frances Fisher was deemed too serious for the role.

==Career==
Richardson began as the understudy for the role of Gypsy Rose Lee in Angela Lansbury&#x27;s Broadway production of &quot;&quot; in 1974, also playing several small chorus parts. In the next ten years she worked in regional theater, commercials, and other Broadway and Off- Broadway plays. She had roles in programs such as &quot;The Equalizer, Spencer For Hire,&quot; and &quot;Kate &amp; Allie&quot;. She appeared in one episode of &quot;The Cosby Show&quot; in the third season with her real-life husband, playing a woman giving birth to her ninth child. Richardson also appeared in the films &quot;Christmas Evil&quot; and &quot;C.H.U.D.&quot;. In 1989, she appeared in one episode of &quot;Quantum Leap&quot; as a radio station owner.

In 1983, she left New York for LA briefly to do a sitcom centered on Katey Sagal&#x27;s twin sisters, Liz and Jean Sagal, called &quot;Double Trouble&quot;, for Norman Lear. When asked to go back and do a second season after her contract had expired, she passed in order to stay in New York and continue performing in Beth Henley&#x27;s &quot;The Miss Firecracker Contest&quot; off-Broadway. A few years later Allan Burns, who co-created &quot;The Mary Tyler Moore Show&quot;, brought her back to Los Angeles to star in two sitcoms he produced: &quot;Eisenhower and Lutz&quot; and &quot;FM&quot;. Both shows ran for 13 episodes.

In 1991, three months after giving birth to twins, Richardson became a last-minute replacement for Frances Fisher in what would be her breakout role as Jill Taylor on the ABC sitcom &quot;Home Improvement&quot;. Richardson received four Emmy nominations, and two Golden Globe nominations in this role. While working on &quot;Home Improvement,&quot; she hosted the Emmys with Ellen DeGeneres, starred in the miniseries &quot;Undue Influence&quot; with Brian Dennehy, &quot;Sophie and the Moonhanger&quot; on Lifetime with Lynn Whitfield, and earned an Independent Spirit nomination in 1997 for her first major theatrical film role in &quot;Ulee&#x27;s Gold&quot;.

In 2002, Richardson replaced Janine Turner in the Lifetime medical drama series &quot;Strong Medicine&quot;, as a new character, Dr. Andy Campbell. She was nominated for two Prism Awards for her work in &quot;Strong Medicine&quot;. After three seasons on that show, she was cast in a recurring role as Sheila Brooks, campaign manager for Republican presidential candidate Arnold Vinick (Alan Alda) in the final two seasons of NBC political drama &quot;The West Wing&quot;.
Richardson appeared in the first season of &quot;Law &amp; Order: Special Victims Unit&quot;. In 2008, she was the executive producer of the video documentary &quot;Long Story Short&quot;, which tells the story of Larry and Trudie Long, a popular Asian American nightclub act of the &#x27;40s and &#x27;50s, told through the eyes of their daughter and her friend, actress Jodi Long. In 2010, she appeared in an NBC made-for-TV film, &quot;The Jensen Project&quot;, and in 2011, she appeared in the Lifetime television film &quot;Bringing Ashley Home&quot;, also starring A.J. Cook and Jennifer Morrison. In 2012, she starred in the coming-of-age film &quot;Beautiful Wave&quot; and in the following year appeared in the Hallmark Channel TV film &quot;Smart Cookies&quot;. Since then, Richardson has filmed several small independent films and two more movies for the Hallmark channel, &quot;Friend Request&quot; and &quot;Snow Bride&quot;.

On the twelfth episode of the fourth season of &quot;Last Man Standing&quot; titled &quot;Helen Potts&quot;, Richardson guest-starred as the titular character and reunited with her former &quot;Home Improvement&quot; co-star, Tim Allen. At the end of the episode, it was revealed that one of her sons&#x27; name is Randy, who was portrayed by her other &quot;Home Improvement&quot; co-star; Jonathan Taylor Thomas. She returned as Helen Potts in the next season.

In 2015, she ran for the position of national president of the SAG-AFTRA, after she had served on the board for one term. She lost the election narrowly to incumbent President Ken Howard. She was re-elected to the National and Local Los Angeles Boards of SAG-AFTRA.

In 2016, Richardson returned to the stage in Steel Magnolias at the Bucks County Playhouse in New Hope, Pennsylvania. This production was directed by four time Oscar nominee Marsha Mason, and also starred Elaine Hendrix, Lucy DeVito, Jessica Walter and Susan Sullivan.
On June 9, 2016, this production became the highest-grossing show in the history of the Bucks County Playhouse.

==Personal life==
Richardson married fellow actor Ray Baker in 1982. They had three children together: Henry Richardson Baker, twins Roxanne Elizabeth Baker and Joseph Castle Baker, before they divorced in August 1995. Richardson is the godmother of actress Betty Gilpin, the daughter of actor Jack Gilpin. 

Richardson had a long-term relationship with retired psychologist Mark Cline, whom she had met when they were both students at Southern Methodist University.

Richardson served many years on the Board of Directors and is the National Spokesperson for &quot;Cure PSP&quot;, a patient advocacy and research organization for progressive supranuclear palsy, corticobasal degeneration, multiple system atrophy and related &quot;Prime Of Life&quot; diseases. Her father died of PSP in 2005.

<text>Rio Branco (, &quot;White River&quot;) is a Brazilian municipality, capital of the state of Acre. Located in the valley of the Acre River in northern Brazil, it is the most populous municipality in the state, with 387,852 inhabitants, according to 2024 IBGE estimates, almost half the state population. Rio Branco was one of the first settlements to develop in the region, being the westernmost major settlement in the country and the 4th-oldest state capital city in Northern Brazil, after Belém, Manaus and Macapá.

In 1913, it became a county. In 1920, it became the capital of the territory of Acre, and in 1962, the state capital. It is the administrative center for the economic, political and cultural region.

== History ==


The capital of the state of Acre developed from the rubber plantation founded on December 28, 1882, by migrant settlers from the Northeastern Region of Brazil. Then called Seringal Volta da Empresa, it was located on the right bank of the Acre river. The Gameleira tree marks this site. This is now classified as the Second District of the city.

Almost 150 years ago, the construction of workers&#x27; shacks had begun, in lands previously occupied by the Aquiri, Canamari, and Maneteri Amazonian indigenous tribes. Years later, the same Gameleira tree survived the battles fought at Volta da Empresa, between Acre revolutionaries and Bolivian troops, during the critical period of the Acre War. As a result, Brazil acquired Acre at the beginning of the 20th century.

By August 1904, Villa Rio Branco had become the main urban center of the entire Acre valley, and was the richest and most productive in the region. During this period of the rubber boom, the streets around the Gameleira were the center of commercial and urban life in this part of the Amazon. Bars, cafes, and casinos supplied the city&#x27;s nightlife; commercial representatives came here of the chief national and foreign Aviation houses that handled thousands of Contos de Réis. There were many wealthy families in the city.

The urban elite was largely composed of liberal professionals and civil servants. The political administration of the Territory was transferred to the left bank of the Acre River, because its lands were higher and not as subject to flooding as the old city centre. The early commercial zone gradually became dominated by Syrian and Lebanese immigrants. By the mid-1930s, one area was known as &quot;Bairro Beirut&quot; (Beirut neighborhood).

By the 1950s, this older section had become run down and known as the Second District. As a large part of its main commercial houses had transferred to the city&#x27;s First District, on the left bank of the river, following the construction there of the main public offices and residences of the most important families. Today, Rio Branco is seeking to find ways to reinvent itself, through relations with neighboring countries, developing heritage and eco-tourism, building on the local fish farming industry, and so on.
