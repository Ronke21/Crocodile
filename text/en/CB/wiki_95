<text>The Werribee line is a commuter railway line in the city of Melbourne, Victoria, Australia. Operated by Metro Trains Melbourne, it is the city&#x27;s ninth longest metropolitan railway line at . 

The line runs from Flinders Street station in central Melbourne to Werribee station in the south-west, serving 17 stations via Footscray, Newport, and Altona. The line operates for approximately 19 hours a day (from approximately 5:00 am to around 12:00 am) with 24 hour service available on Friday and Saturday nights. During peak hour, headways of up to 5–20 minutes are operated with services every 20–30 minutes during off-peak hours. Trains on the Werribee line run with a two three-car formation of Comeng, Siemens Nexas, and X&#x27;Trapolis 100 trainsets.

Part of the line initially opened in 1857 by the Geelong and Melbourne Railway Company. The line was progressively finished within the next two years, allowing trains to travel from Melbourne to Geelong. In April 1885, a short branch was opened off the Werribee line just past Newport to Williamstown Racecourse, and in November 1888, a branch was opened off the Racecourse branch to Altona, terminating at a station named Altona Beach. The construction of these lines played important parts in the development of Geelong and Melbourne&#x27;s west during the 19th and 20th centuries, with the line continuing to be an important asset in the 21st century.

Since the 2010s, due to the heavily utilised infrastructure of the Werribee line, improvements and upgrades have been made. Works have included replacing sleepers, upgrading signalling technology, the removal of level crossings, planning for new infrastructure, the introduction of new rolling stock, and station accessibility upgrades.

== History ==

=== 19th century ===

In 1857, the Geelong and Melbourne Railway Company (G&amp;MRC) opened the Werribee to Little River section of the line they were building between Newport and Geelong, then in June of that year, they opened the section between Werribee and a temporary station near Newport, known as Greenwich. The intention was to connect to the Williamstown line being built by the Melbourne, Mount Alexander and Murray River Railway Company, with whom they had arranged permission to run the former company&#x27;s trains over the latter company&#x27;s tracks to Melbourne, but the Williamstown line was not yet ready.

However, by October 1857, construction of the Williamstown line had sufficiently advanced to allow the Geelong trains to run to the terminus at Williamstown Pier, so Greenwich station was closed and a connection was made to the Williamstown line towards Williamstown. From Williamstown Pier, passengers could connect to a ferry across Hobsons Bay to Port Melbourne.

The Williamstown line fully opened in January 1859, so the connection near Newport towards Williamstown was removed and replaced with a connection to Newport, and the through running of Geelong trains to Melbourne commenced.

In April 1885, a short branch was opened off the Werribee line just past Newport to Williamstown Racecourse, and in November 1888, a branch was opened off the Racecourse branch to Altona, terminating at a station named Altona Beach. This branch was opened by the Altona and Laverton Bay Freehold and Investment Company to encourage people to buy their land in the area. However, the line closed less than two years later, in August 1890.

=== 20th century ===
A portion of the Altona Beach line near Williamstown Racecourse was leased by the Victorian Railways (VR) in 1906 to store race trains. Sometime between 1911 and 1919, the line reopened for goods trains with a siding built from Altona Beach to the Melbourne and Altona Colliery Company mine. From November 1917, the VR worked on the line on behalf of the then owners, Altona Beach Estates Ltd., but to a relocated Altona Beach station, short of the original terminus.

The VR electrified the Williamstown line and the branch to Williamstown Racecourse in August 1920. In October 1924, the VR took total control of the Altona Beach line, and electrified it in October 1926. Automatic Block Signalling was commissioned between South Kensington and Yarraville in August 1927, and then on to Newport. The Automatic and Track Control system was installed from Newport South towards Geelong, enabling bidirectional use of the then single track line.

The Williamstown Racecourse branch closed in May 1950. Duplication of the Werribee line occurred in stages between 1960 and 1968, with the Altona branch converted to Automatic Block Signalling in October 1967. First announced by the Transport Minister Joe Rafferty in 1977, electrification was extended from Altona Junction to Werribee in September 1983, whilst in January 1985, the Altona line was extended to Westona.

By the early 1980s, the Altona Loop was under threat of closure, as recommended in the Lonie Report. In October 1981, the rail service was drastically cut, with all shuttle services withdrawn, and only two morning and evening trains being operated to and from Melbourne. However, a change of state government in 1982 saw the restitution of many services in July of that year. On 21 January 1985, the line was subsequently extended to Westona and, in April of that year, was extended from Westona to Laverton. In April 1985, Altona to Westona, which had temporarily been operated by Staff and Ticket safeworking, was converted to Automatic and Track Control, and a few days later, the line was extended to Laverton and therefore connecting with the Werribee line.

=== 21st century ===

Initially, almost every Werribee bound service ran via Westona, but a timetable re-write in May 2011 saw this section converted to a separate service for the majority of the time. The rewrite introduced the controversial practice of having trains serving the Altona Loop run as a shuttle service between Laverton and Newport during off peak hours. Shuttle services were ended in August 2017, with direct services to and from the city being reinstated to the Altona Loop.

In June 2015, the completion of the Regional Rail Link allowed for the rerouting of Geelong and Warrnambool services via the 90 km of new track constructed between Little River and Deer Park stations. Instead of stopping at select stations on the Werribee line, services now stop at new stations at Wyndham Vale and Tarneit which are in Melbournes growing western suburbs. The separation of suburban and regional trains has reduced overcrowding, increased capacity, and improved service reliability on the Werribee line in addition to the benefits seen on Geelong services.

In January 2021, a major timetable rewrite resulted in increased frequencies and weekend daytime shuttle services being extended from Newport to Flinders Street. Peak hour weekday services now stop at South Kensington, which simplifies stopping patterns on the Sunbury line. In addition, peak hour frequencies were also made more consistent for the Altona Loop.

== Future ==
=== Level crossing removals ===

The Level Crossing Removal Project has announced the removal of all remaining level crossings on the Werribee line, to be completed in stages from 2018 to 2030. In 2018, one level crossing was removed at Kororoit Creek Road, Williamstown North. The crossing was removed by raising the rail line onto a rail bridge above the road with partial duplication of the Altona Loop completed as part of the project. In 2019, another level crossing was removed at Aviation Road, Laverton. The crossing was removed by raising the road onto a bridge above the rail line with upgrades to Aircraft station in conjunction with the project. The upgrades included a redesigned station forecourt and construction of a new pedestrian underpass. In 2021, a total of 3 level crossings were removed at various locations along the line. Crossings were removed at Old Geelong Road in Hoppers Crossing and Werribee Street and Cherry Street in Werribee. Two of these crossings were removed with road bridges and one with a rail bridge. The removal of the crossing at Old Geelong Road in Hoppers Crossing also included an upgrade to Hoppers Crossing station with a new overpass, station forecourt, and bus interchange. The final five crossings along the line (excluding the ones on the Altona Loop) will be removed by 2030. The crossing at Hudsons Road, Spotswood and Maddox Road, Newport will be removed by constructing two separate rail bridges with a new Spotswood station also being built. In addition, the crossing at Maidstone Street will be removed with the construction of a road bridge and two crossings—Anderson Street and Champion Road—will be closed off. At the end of these works, the Werribee line will be fully level crossing free by 2030.

=== Network reconfiguration ===
When the new cross-city rail corridor being built by the Metro Tunnel opens in 2025 there will be a reorganisation of the Melbourne rail network. The Victorian Department of Transport and Planning plans to return the Frankston line to the City Loop, with dedicated use of the Caulfield group tunnel track. This will mean Frankston line trains will no longer through-run with Werribee and Williamstown line trains, and will again stop at City Loop stations Flagstaff, Melbourne Central, and Parliament. As part of the reconfiguration, the Werribee and Williamstown lines would instead begin through-running services to Sandringham for the first time.

=== Melbourne Metro 2 ===
The 2012 Network Development Plan identified the need for an east-west tunnel connecting the Werribee (and potentially) the Geelong line to the Mernda line. The project would split the Mernda line from the Hurstbridge line after Clifton Hill into a new tunnel, travelling east stopping at a new station in the &quot;inner north&quot;, before connecting with at Parkville, Flagstaff, and Southern Cross stations. Exiting the CBD, the line would continue in a tunnel stopping at a new station in the suburb of Fishermans Bend, before crossing underneath the Yarra River and arriving at Newport station. The line would then exit the tunnel and travel further west to connect with the Werribee line bypassing the Altona Loop. The Werribee and Williamstown lines will be reconfigured to provide better and simpler service. This project was initially meant to be completed in the 2020s, however, no funding or planning has taken place, with the revised Victorian Rail Plan stating that the project would be completed under Stage 6 of the plan.

As part of the Melbourne Metro 2, the Werribee and Williamstown lines would be reconfigured to provide simpler service. The Sandringham line would continue running to Williamstown with the line also travelling to and terminating at Laverton via the Altona Loop. Express services (not via the Altona Loop) would instead be served by trains exiting the Melbourne Metro 2 tunnel towards Werribee (and potentially Geelong).

=== Geelong Fast Rail ===

The Western Rail Plan is a plan that aims to improve the quality of rail services in Melbournes western suburbs through infrastructure upgrades on a range of metropolitan and regional lines. Geelong Fast Rail was one project identified in the Western Rail Plan as a matter of priority, as it would allow for Geelong and Warrnambool services to travel back via the Werribee line, cutting travel time and allowing electrification of other corridors to occur which are currently being served exclusively by V/Line trains. Phase 1 of Geelong Fast Rail will consist of the following projects aimed at cutting travel times by 15 minutes:

* New track between Werribee and Laverton dedicated to regional services
* Upgrades and widening of bridges over main roads, creeks, and rivers
* Upgraded stations at Werribee and Laverton
* Signalling and train control system upgrades

Construction on the project expected to get underway in 2023, with the Australian and Victorian governments committing $2 billion each to the project which is expected to create 2800 new jobs.

== Network and operations ==
=== Services ===
Services on the Werribee line operates from approximately 5:00 am to around 12:00 am daily. In general, during peak hours, train frequency is 5–15 minutes (reduced frequencies on the Altona Loop) while services during non-peak hours drops to 20 minutes throughout the entire route. Instead of running through the City Loop, services terminate at Flinders Street and then continue onto the Frankston line, with boosted frequencies in combination with the Williamstown line. The Night Network operates on Friday nights and weekends, with services running 24 hours a day, with 60 minute frequencies available outside of normal operating hours.

Train services on the Werribee line are also subjected to maintenance and renewal works, usually on selected Fridays and Saturdays. Shuttle bus services are provided throughout the duration of works for affected commuters.

=== Operators ===

The Werribee line has had a total of 10 operators since its opening in 1857. Early in 1857, the Geelong and Melbourne Railway Company (G&amp;MR) opened the Werribee to Little River section of the line they were building between Newport and Geelong. 2 years later in 1859, the government acquired the line and begun operations under the newly formed Victorian Railways (VR). The railway to Altona was constructed by the Altona Beach Estate Company, a private land developer, and opened on 9 November 1888 to a station named Altona Beach, which was about a kilometre to the east of the current station. As a result of the collapse of the 1880s Land Boom, regular services to Altona Beach ceased after August 1890, and the Victorian Government declined the offer of the owners to gift it the line. In 1917, the owners of the estate entered into an agreement with the Victorian Railways (VR) to provide a regular passenger service, having guaranteed to cover any operating losses. The majority of operations throughout its history have been government run: from its government acquisition in 1859 until the 1999 privatisation of Melbourne&#x27;s rail network, four different government operators have run the line. These operators, Victorian Railways, the Metropolitan Transit Authority, the Public Transport Corporation, and Bayside Trains have a combined operational length of 140 years.

Bayside Trains was privatised in August 1999 and later rebranded M&gt;Train. In 2002, M&gt;Train was placed into receivership and the state government regained ownership of the line, with KPMG appointed as receivers to operate M&gt;Train on behalf of the state government. Two years later, rival train operator Connex Melbourne took over the M&gt;Train operations including the Williamstown line. Metro Trains Melbourne, the current private operator, then took over the operations in 2009. The private operators have had a combined operational period of years.
=== Route ===

The Werribee line forms a mostly straight route from the Melbourne central business district to its terminus in Werribee. The route is long and is fully doubled tracked from Flinders Street to its terminus, excluding during the Altona Loop. After changing from Frankston services at Flinders Street, the Werribee line traverses mainly flat country with few curves and fairly minimal earthworks for most of the line. Few sections of the line has been elevated or lowered to remove level crossings. All remaining level crossings will be removed by 2030.

The line follows the same alignment as the Williamstown line with the two services splitting onto different routes at Newport. The Werribee line continues on its south-western alignment, whereas the Williamstown line takes a southern alignment towards its final destination. Most of the rail line goes through built-up suburbs and heavy industrial areas with small pockets on non-urbanised spaces.

=== Stations ===
The line serves 17 stations across of track. The stations are a mix of elevated, lowered, and ground level designs. The majority of elevated and lowered stations being constructed as part of level crossing removals. From 2030, Spotswood station will be elevated as part of additional level crossing removal works.

== Infrastructure ==

=== Rolling stock ===
The Werribee line uses three different types of electric multiple unit (EMU) trains that are operated in a split six-car configuration, with three doors per side on each carriage. The primary rolling stock featured on the line is the Comeng EMUs, built by Commonwealth Engineering between 1981 and 1988. These train sets are the oldest on the Melbourne rail network and subsequently will be replaced by the mid 2030s. Siemens Nexas EMUs are also widely featured on the line, originally built between 2002 and 2005 these train sets feature more modern technology than the Comeng trains. The final type of rolling stock featured on the line is the X&#x27;Trapolis 100 built by Alstom between 2002 and 2004, and 2009 and 2020. All of these rolling stock models are widely used on other lines across the metropolitan network and work as the backbone of the network.

Alongside the passenger trains, Werribee line tracks and equipment are maintained by a fleet of engineering trains. The four types of engineering trains are: the shunting train; designed for moving trains along non-electrified corridors and for transporting other maintenance locomotives, for track evaluation; designed for evaluating track and its condition, the overhead inspection train; designed for overhead wiring inspection, and the infrastructure evaluation carriage designed for general infrastructure evaluation. Most of these trains are repurposed locomotives previously used by V/Line, Metro Trains, and the Southern Shorthaul Railroad.

==== Planned rolling stock ====
Contrary to popular belief, the next generation of the X&#x27;Trapolis family of electric EMUs, the X&#x27;Trapolis 2.0, won&#x27;t be introduced on the Werribee line. By the time the new trains entered service, the Werribee line will be through routed to the Sandringham line.

=== Accessibility ===

In compliance with the Disability Discrimination Act of 1992, all stations that are new-built or rebuilt are fully accessible and comply with these guidelines. The majority of stations on the corridor are fully accessible, however, there are some stations that haven&#x27;t been upgraded to meet these guidelines. These stations do feature ramps, however, they have a gradient greater than 1 in 14. Stations that are fully accessible feature ramps that have a gradient less than 1 in 14, have at-grade paths, or feature lifts. These stations typically also feature tactile boarding indicators, independent boarding ramps, wheelchair accessible myki barriers, hearing loops, and widened paths.

Projects improving station accessibility have included the Level Crossing Removal Project, which involves station rebuilds and upgrades and other individual station upgrade projects. These works have made significant strides in improving network accessibility, with more than 76% of Werribee line stations classed as fully accessible. This number is expected to grow within the coming years with the completion of level crossing removal works on the corridor by 2029.

=== Signalling ===
The Werribee line uses three-position signalling which is widely used across the Melbourne train network. Three-position signalling was first introduced in 1927, with the final section of the line converted to the new type of signalling in 1946. Past Werribee, three-position signalling continues further past Geelong.

<doc id="842974" wikidata="Q1200038" url="?curid=842974" title="Our Man Flint">
<text>Our Man Flint is a 1966 American spy-fi comedy film that parodies the &quot;James Bond&quot; film series. The film was directed by Daniel Mann, written by Hal Fimberg and Ben Starr (from a story by Hal Fimberg), and starred James Coburn as master spy Derek Flint. A sequel, &quot;In Like Flint&quot;, was released the following year, with Coburn reprising his role.

==Plot==
Spy extraordinaire Derek Flint is an ex-agent of Z.O.W.I.E. (Zonal Organization World Intelligence Espionage) who is brought out of retirement to deal with the threat of &quot;Galaxy&quot;, a worldwide organization led by a trio of mad scientists: Doctor Krupov, Doctor Wu, and Doctor Schneider. Impatient that the world&#x27;s governments will never improve, the scientists demand that all nations capitulate to Galaxy. To enforce their demands, they initiate earthquakes, volcanoes, storms, and other natural disasters with their climate-control apparatus to force countries to dissolve their armed forces and stop using nuclear power to generate electricity.

Initially reluctant, Flint decides to take them on after a preemptive assassination attempt by Galaxy&#x27;s section head, Gila, who replaces a restaurant&#x27;s harpist while Flint is dining with his four live-in &quot;playmates&quot; — Leslie, Anna, Gina, and Sakito. Gila uses a harp string as a bow to fire a poisoned dart, which misses Flint but hits his former boss, Cramden.

Flint squeezes the poison out of the wound, saving Cramden&#x27;s life. A chemical trace on the dart directs Flint to Marseille for bouillabaisse. In one of Marseille&#x27;s lowest clubs, he stages a brawl to gain information from &quot;famous&quot; Agent 0008, which leads him to a narcotics trade which is financing Galaxy.

Galaxy agent Hans Gruber is in the club enjoying his favorite soup while waiting to rendezvous with Gila. Instead, Gila sends Gruber to ambush Flint in the lavatory. Flint ends up killing Gruber in a toilet stall while Gila escapes, leaving behind a cold cream jar she has booby-trapped with explosives. Flint detects the trap and chases the bystanders from the club before detonating the bomb.

The remains in the jar lead Flint to Rome. After investigating several cosmetic companies, Flint arrives at Exotica, where he meets Gila for the first time. Gila lets him come to her apartment for an exchange of information, and then a seduction. Following their encounter, he steals the keys to Exotica and breaks into the company&#x27;s safe, learning of Galaxy&#x27;s location before being trapped by Gila&#x27;s assistant, Malcolm Rodney. Malcolm and Gila assume that Flint will soon run out of air in the safe as they transport it to a waiting submarine. However, during the journey, Flint learns that his playmates have been kidnapped and taken to the headquarters on Galaxy Island in the Mediterranean Sea.

He then uses his power of self-induced suspended animation to fool his captors into thinking they have successfully killed him. Gila and Rodney take an evidence photograph of the &quot;body&quot;, which they send to Cramden, then carry Flint back to headquarters on the submarine.

Flint revives and sneaks into the Galaxy complex, but his infiltration is thwarted, and he is taken before Galaxy&#x27;s trio of leaders. Offered a chance to join their new order, he refuses and is sentenced to death by disintegration.

Gila&#x27;s failure to eliminate Flint results in her being stripped of her leadership role and reassigned to become a Pleasure Unit – a fate that has already befallen Flint&#x27;s playmates. She then changes sides, slipping Flint his gadget-filled cigarette lighter before she is hauled away. With the help of the lighter, Flint again escapes, sabotages the machinery, rescues his playmates and Gila, and departs the island as it disintegrates.

A waiting American warship picks up Flint and the women as they watch a volcano erupt on the island. Gila presumably joins the other four women living with Flint. (In the sequel, when Flint is again called out of retirement for a mission, he lives with three women, saying that &quot;five was just too many.&quot;)

The last shot is of the &quot;Anti-American Eagle&quot; that attacked Flint at Rodney&#x27;s behest earlier in the film flying over the smoking ruins of the island.

==Cast==
The uncredited actor playing the overseer of the Pleasure Unit process is Dick Wilson, who later gained fame as &quot;Mr. Whipple&quot; in a long string of commercials for Charmin toilet paper. The voice of then-President Lyndon B. Johnson was provided by Van Williams, who provided the same voice-over effect later that year, in the film &quot;Batman: The Movie&quot;.

==Production==
Producer Saul David had just made &quot;Von Ryan&#x27;s Express&quot; for Fox and &quot;Our Man Flint&quot; would be his second film for the studio. David told the press that Flint would be &quot;an entirely different cup of tea&quot; to James Bond, &quot;a sensitive and sensible individual, loyal to his own code instead of to an arbitrary entity which we might call &#x27;our side&#x27;. His pleasures will be taken with verve and gusto a la Tom Jones and his heroics will be treated with wit and vitality, a la Douglas Fairbanks.&quot;

Coburn had appeared in a number of key supporting roles, particularly &quot;The Americanization of Emily&quot; and &quot;A High Wind in Jamaica&quot; but &quot;Our Man Flint&quot; was his first lead in a feature. His casting was announced in December 1964 and filming began in February 1965.

David said Coburn &quot;is undoubtedly one of the most interesting looking actors in the business today. I would describe him as a cross between Humphrey Bogart and Jean Paul Belmondo - a true descendant of that bygone generation of character actors who became leading men by accident... Coburn has a fantastic effect on women filmgoers and I think it&#x27;s because ladies go more for masculinity and charm than prettiness in a male star.&quot;

Coburn later said, &quot;I credit the producer, Saul David, for the Flint films. He was responsible for the whole thing. He also cast me in the role. Of course, it was a spoof of the Bond and all the other spy films released at the time. What I liked about Flint was that he was his own man. He trained himself. We tried to work from that theme. It must have worked... after all, the film was a big hit.&quot;

Fox were so happy with the film that head of production Richard Zanuck announced preparations for a sequel, &quot;F as in Flint&quot;, in November 1965, before the movie was even released. (It was then retitled &quot;In Like Flint&quot;.)

=== Locations ===
Flint&#x27;s apartment is located in The San Remo in New York City. The skyline projected out the window of the apartment is of Central Park South on 59th Street. The interiors of Galaxy Island were filmed at the Scattergood Generating Station.

==Influences==
The film&#x27;s direct nods to James Bond in a comedic and outlandish style. Flint is initially offered a Walther PPK and an attache case with a concealed throwing knife, with Flint dismissing both as &quot;crude&quot;. During the French strip club sequence, Flint stages a mock brawl with a patron identified as Agent 0008, a British secret agent. Flint asks if SPECTRE (the criminal organization in the early Bond movies) is involved, to which Agent 0008 replies, &quot;It&#x27;s bigger than SPECTRE!&quot; The actor playing the role is similar in appearance to Sean Connery. Later in the film, Gila is shown reading a 0008 novel, referencing the James Bond novels.

==Soundtrack==
20th Century Fox&#x27;s house composer Jerry Goldsmith composed the film&#x27;s score. The film&#x27;s original soundtrack LP was rerecorded slower arrangements of the score, and a DVD of the surviving elements of the two Flint films was later released.

Herbie Mann covered the title theme, &quot;Our Man Flint&quot;, on his 1966 album, &quot;Our Mann Flute&quot;. Many other cover versions of the theme music were recorded during the mid-1960s, including Roland Shaw, Billy Strange and The Challengers with Hugo Montenegro&#x27;s version including the Presidential telephone&#x27;s ringtone. Wall of Voodoo used the theme tune in the 2nd half of their version of &quot;Ring of Fire&quot;.

==Cultural legacy==
The distinctive ringtone of Cramden&#x27;s &quot;presidential hotline&quot; telephone was re-used in the films &quot;Hudson Hawk&quot;, and in Seattle children&#x27;s television program, &quot;The J.P. Patches Show&quot;. Popular Los Angeles KIIS-FM disc jockey Rick Dees used the sound effect as the &quot;hotline&quot; phone sound whenever the station manager would call and yell at him during his 1980s and 1990s shows. A similar ringtone was used in &quot;Austin Powers: International Man of Mystery,&quot; clearly as a &quot;nod and a wink&quot; to the Flint films.

Hanna-Barbara&#x27;s 1966 animated film The Man Called Flintstone includes nods to the Our Man Flint, especially on the theatrical poster.

A 1965 novelization of the film by Jack Pearl includes much material not seen on the screen that may have been taken from an earlier screenplay draft.

The name Hans Gruber was reused in two later films, &quot;Re-Animator&quot; and &quot;Die Hard&quot;.

Clips of audio from the film are sampled in The Desert Sessions song &quot;Sugar Rush&quot; on the album Volumes 3 &amp; 4.
==Release==
The film was premiered in St Ann&#x27;s Bay in Jamaica in December 1965 but not officially released in the US until January 1966. Coburn and Mann did not attend the premiere but Cobb and David did.
===Critical reception===
&quot;Our Man Flint&quot; generally received positive reviews, having a &quot;Fresh&quot; score of 76% on Rotten Tomatoes from 33 critics.

&quot;Variety&quot; called it &quot;a dazzling, action-jammed swashbuckling spoof of Ian Fleming’s valiant counterspy&quot; where &quot;in a cycle which sees virtually every studio clambering aboard the espionage bandwagon, indications point to blockbusting biz if film is properly exploited.&quot;

&quot;Filmink&quot; argued &quot;a great deal of&quot; the success of the film &quot;(correctly) was attributed to Coburn. What other actor could have pulled it off? He had a laconic, suave, rugged look, not too pretty, a nice sense of humour. It helped that in real life Coburn was a pot smoker who’d served in the military but went his own way in life, a genuine counterculture figure who was into cars, karate, and poetry – all came through for Derek Flint.&quot;

===Box office===
It was the ninth highest grossing film in 1966 based on North American theater rentals of $6,500,000.

According to Fox records, the film needed to earn $7,700,000 to break even (after distribution and overhead costs were added) and made $12,950,000 at the box office.

==Sequels==
&quot;In Like Flint&quot; (1967) was directed by Gordon Douglas and again starred James Coburn, with Cobb also reprising his role as Lloyd C. Cramden.

In 1972, Harlan Ellison wrote a teleplay entitled &quot;Flintlock&quot; as a continuation of the films with Coburn intended to reprise his role. Still, studios have passed on what would have been a pilot for a proposed television series, and it went unproduced. A later attempt on the same format resulted in &quot;Dead on Target&quot; (1976), a Canadian-filmed television pilot directed by Joseph L. Scanlan, starring Ray Danton as Flint, here depicted as a private investigator. This originally aired on ABC-TV on March 17, 1976.

An Italian parody, &quot;Il vostro super agente Flit&quot;, was released in 1966.

He contested the Parliamentary seat of Ludlow in 1966 and a by-election in Dudley in 1968 before being elected for Dudley in 1970 and (after boundary changes) Dudley East in 1974, which he represented until 1997, when it became part of the new Dudley North constituency (which was held by a new Labour MP) and Gilbert retired from the House of Commons.

In the Labour governments of Harold Wilson and James Callaghan he was Financial Secretary to the Treasury (1974–1975), Minister for Transport (1975–1976), and Minister of State for Defence (1976–1979). As Minister for Transport he approved the London M25 orbital motorway project and introduced the Bill to make the wearing of seat belts compulsory. He also served on the House of Commons Defence Committee (1979–1987) and the Trade and Industry Committee (1987–1992).

==House of Lords==
After his retirement from the House of Commons, he was created a Life Peer as Baron Gilbert, &quot;of Dudley in the County of West Midlands&quot; on 16 May 1997 and from 1997 to 1999 he was the Minister of State for Defence Procurement in Tony Blair&#x27;s first government.
Always a staunch proponent of Britain&#x27;s independent nuclear deterrent, he caused controversy when he proposed neutron bombing the Afghanistan-Pakistan border to &quot;prevent people from infiltrating from one side to the other.&quot; In October 2012 he said in the House of Lords &quot;The A400M [the RAF&#x27;s new transport aircraft] is a complete, absolute wanking disaster, and we should be ashamed of ourselves. I have never seen such a waste of public funds in the defence field since I have been involved in it these past 40 years.&quot;

==Personal life==
Gilbert was married twice, firstly in 1950, to Hillary, daughter of Lord Strabolgi. They had two daughters, before divorcing in 1954.

Gilbert later married Jean Ross-Skinner in 1963.

He died in 2013 at the age of 86.

<doc id="842990" wikidata="Q1434753" url="?curid=842990" title="Great Moon Hoax">
<text>The &quot;Great Moon Hoax&quot;, also known as the &quot;Great Moon Hoax of 1835&quot; was a series of six articles published in &quot;The Sun&quot; (a New York newspaper), beginning on August 25, 1835, about the supposed discovery of life and civilization on the Moon. The discoveries were falsely attributed to Sir John Herschel and his fictitious companion Andrew Grant.

The story was advertised on August 21, 1835, as an upcoming feature allegedly reprinted from &quot;The Edinburgh Courant&quot;. The first in a series of six was published four days later on August 25. These articles were never retracted; however, on September 16, 1835, &quot;The Sun&quot; admitted the articles were in fact fabricated.

==Hoax==
The headline read:

The articles described animals on the Moon, including bison, single-horned goats, mini zebras, unicorns, bipedal tail-less beavers and bat-like winged humanoids (&quot;Vespertilio-homo&quot;&quot;) who built temples. There were trees, oceans and beaches. These discoveries were supposedly made with &quot;an immense telescope of an entirely new principle&quot;. The telescope - transported to South Africa from New England - was said to be many times larger than any other telescope in the world. The lens measured &quot;24 feet in diameter and 7 tons in weight&quot;.

&quot;Vespertilio-homo&quot; can be translated from Latin as man-bat, bat-man, or man-bats.

A reprinted edition of 1836 added a second type named the Vespertiliones. The author of the narrative was ostensibly Dr. Andrew Grant, the travelling companion and amanuensis of Sir John Herschel, but Grant was fictitious.

Eventually, the authors announced that the observations had been terminated by the destruction of the telescope, by means of the Sun causing the lens to act as a &quot;burning glass&quot;, setting fire to the observatory.

==Authorship==

The writer of the article was at first not known to the public. Authorship has subsequently been attributed to Richard Adams Locke (1800–1871), a reporter who, in August 1835, was working for &quot;The Sun&quot;. Locke publicly admitted to being the author in 1840, in a letter to the weekly paper &quot;New World&quot;. Despite Locke&#x27;s claims, rumours persisted that others were involved in the articles&#x27; creation.

Two other men have been noted in connection with the hoax: Jean-Nicolas Nicollet, a French astronomer travelling in America at the time (though he was in Mississippi, not New York, when the Moon-hoax issues appeared), and Lewis Gaylord Clark, editor of &quot;The Knickerbocker&quot;, a literary magazine. However, there is no good evidence to indicate that anyone but Locke was the author of the hoax.

Assuming that Richard A. Locke was the author, his intentions were probably, first, to create a sensational story which would increase sales of &quot;The Sun&quot;, and, second, to ridicule some of the more extravagant astronomical theories that had recently been published. Locke had meant for the hoax to act as a satire to show how science can be and is influenced by the thoughts of religion. For instance, in 1824, Franz von Paula Gruithuisen, professor of astronomy at Munich University, had published a paper titled &quot;Discovery of Many Distinct Traces of Lunar Inhabitants, Especially of One of Their Colossal Buildings&quot;. One theory is that this paper is responsible for inspiring the articles written by Locke. In his paper, Gruithuisen claimed to have observed various shades of color on the lunar surface, which he correlated with climate and vegetation zones. He also observed lines and geometrical shapes, which he felt indicated the existence of walls, roads, fortifications, and cities.

==Reactions==


According to legend, &quot;The Sun&quot;″s circulation increased dramatically because of the hoax and remained permanently greater than before, thereby establishing &quot;The Sun&quot; as a successful paper. It brought the journal to international fame, and the hoax resembled crime reports that allowed the readers to play detective, trying to discover the truth.

However, the degree to which the hoax increased the paper&#x27;s circulation has certainly been exaggerated in popular accounts of the event. It was not discovered to be a hoax for several weeks after its publication and, even then, the newspaper did not issue a retraction.

Herschel was initially amused by the hoax, noting that his own real observations could never be as exciting. He later became annoyed when he had to answer questions from people who believed the hoax was serious.

Edgar Allan Poe claimed the story was a plagiarism of his earlier work &quot;The Unparalleled Adventure of One Hans Pfaall&quot;, and &quot;Hans Phaall – A Tale&quot;, published in the &quot;Southern Literary Messenger.&quot; His editor at the time was Richard Adams Locke. He later published &quot;The Balloon-Hoax&quot; in the same newspaper. As well as &quot;The Unparalleled Adventure of One Hans Pfaall&quot;. The story was reprinted in the &quot;New York Transcript&quot; on September 2–5, 1835, under the headline &quot;Lunar Discoveries, Extraordinary Aerial Voyage by Baron Hans Pfaall&quot;.

Poe described a voyage to the Moon in a balloon, in which Pfaall lives for five years on the Moon with lunarians and sends back a lunarian to Earth. The Poe Moon hoax was less successful because of the satiric and comical tone of the account. Locke was able to upstage Poe and to steal his thunder. In 1846, Poe would write a biographical sketch of Locke as part of his series &quot;The Literati of New York City&quot; which appeared in &quot;Godey&#x27;s Lady&#x27;s Book&quot;.

== Context ==
The sensational reports of Richard Adams Locke were not out of place in the context of the mass proliferation of penny press newspapers such as the &quot;New York Sun&quot; which received much of their income from advertisements, a business practice made sustainable by large numbers of readers. &quot;The Sun&quot; was a pioneer when it came to producing shocking and often sensationalist journalism, being the first New York newspaper to report on murders, suicides, personal events, and divorces, and it was because of stories such as these that the &quot;Sun&quot; thrived in attracting readers to their articles, and thus to their advertisements.

The success of such sensational stories as the &quot;Great Moon Hoax&quot; can be partly attributed to the influence of contemporary speculative science. Figures like the Reverend Thomas Dick, who claimed that the Moon was inhabited by billions of beings, had captured the public&#x27;s imagination in the early 19th century. Locke&#x27;s hoax played on similar popular beliefs, presenting them as the latest scientific findings from the well-respected astronomer Sir John Herschel, which lent the story credibility.

==Legacy==
The hoax is featured in &quot;&quot;, winner of the Pulitzer Prize for History.

The Moon Trilogy - a series of fantasy novels by the Polish author Jerzy Żuławski, published in 1903–1911. The series consists of three novels: &quot;On the Silver Globe. Manuscript from the Moon&quot;, &quot;The Conqueror&quot; and &quot;Old Earth&quot;.

Nate DiMeo&#x27;s historical podcast &quot;The Memory Palace&quot; dedicated a 2010 episode to the Great Moon Hoax entitled &quot;The Moon in the Sun&quot;.

The hoax inspired a three-part musical by composer Matt Dahan as part of his musical radio series &quot;Pulp Musicals&quot;.

Richard Adams Locke and the Great Moon Hoax are fictionalized in chapter 14 of Félix J. Palma&#x27;s 2012 novel &quot;The Map of the Sky&quot;.

The hoax reflected a time when readers were looking for entertainment as much as information from penny press newspapers, which would later change with the development of ethical reporting.

<doc id="842991" wikidata="Q7417060" url="?curid=842991" title="Sandwell Valley">
<text>Sandwell Valley is an area of green belt in the county of West Midlands, England, on the border of Birmingham and West Bromwich, with Walsall at its northern end.

It is a valley on the River Tame of which are owned by Sandwell Metropolitan Borough Council, with the RSPB leasing 25 acres as Sandwell Valley RSPB reserve. Within this large area, is the Sandwell Valley Country Park, which contains two visitor centres, Forge Mill Farm and Sandwell Park Farm, the former using modern farming techniques, the latter with a walled kitchen garden and rare breeds of farm animals, one of 16 farm parks approved nationally by the Rare Breeds Survival Trust.

Sot&#x27;s Hole is one of three Local Nature Reserves in the Country Park, and lies on the edge of the site on Dagger Lane/Church Vale, West Bromwich. In an effort to protect and restore the reserve, a group of local people joined together in November 2005 and formed the Friends of Sot&#x27;s Hole.

The earliest evidence of people in Sandwell Valley is in the form of flint tools from the Mesolithic period, but evidence of later periods is also present in the landscape, including the site of Sandwell Hall (home of the Earls of Dartmouth) and Sandwell Priory ruins (still evident today). Exhibitions at Sandwell Park Farm tell the story of the people who lived here.

The M5 motorway bisects the Country Park, with the intersection between it and the M6 (considered Junction 8 of the M6) at the northern end, and junction 1 of the M5 to the south. The latter junction surrounds a surviving gatehouse from the hall. The Birmingham-Walsall Line, part of the former Grand Junction Railway, opened in 1837, runs through the northern end of the valley, with Hamstead railway station being the nearest. The former Newton Road railway station having closed some years ago.

The highest point of Sandwell Valley is in Birmingham and is known as Hill Top, where the remains of a World War II gun emplacement can still be found there.

The Country Park&#x27;s fauna and flora are studied by the &quot;Sandwell Valley Naturalists&#x27; Club&quot; (&quot;SandNats&quot;).

Every Saturday morning at 9.00am, the country park hosts a parkrun, a free, weekly timed 5 km run.
Adjacent areas include Great Barr, Hamstead and Handsworth Wood.

<doc id="842993" wikidata="Q2344681" url="?curid=842993" title="Dæmon (His Dark Materials)">
<text>A dæmon () is a type of fictional being in the Philip Pullman fantasy trilogies &quot;His Dark Materials&quot; and &quot;The Book of Dust&quot;. Dæmons are the external physical manifestation of a person&#x27;s &quot;inner-self&quot; that takes the form of an animal. Dæmons have human intelligence, are capable of human speech—regardless of the form they take—and usually behave as though they are independent of their humans. Pre-pubescent children&#x27;s dæmons can change form voluntarily to become any creature, real or imaginary. During adolescence a person&#x27;s dæmon undergoes &quot;settling&quot;, an event in which that person&#x27;s dæmon permanently and involuntarily assumes the form of the animal which the person most resembles in character. Dæmons are usually of the opposite sex to their human, though same-sex dæmons do exist.

Dæmons frequently interact with each other in ways that mirror the behaviour of their humans, such as fighting one another when their humans are fighting, or nuzzling one another when their humans embrace, and such contact is seen as normal. However, for a human to touch another person&#x27;s dæmon is taboo.

==Background==
Pullman says his inspirations for dæmons were Leonardo da Vinci&#x27;s &quot;Lady with an Ermine&quot;, Giovanni Battista Tiepolo&#x27;s &quot;Young Woman with a Macaw&quot; and Hans Holbein the Younger&#x27;s &quot;The Lady and the Squirrel&quot;, all portraits in which there seemed to be &quot;a psychological link between the person and the creature&quot;. Another influence was the daimon described in Plato&#x27;s &quot;Apology of Socrates&quot;: &quot;Socrates talked about his &#x27;daimon&#x27;. I found it a very fruitful metaphor.&quot;

==In-universe information==
===Form===
Dæmons supposedly occur in every world, but in Lyra&#x27;s universe they take an external shape, even if they are not corporeal. Typically dæmons and their humans are conscious or asleep at the same time. However, the dæmons of witches and shamans can remain awake while their humans sleep.

&quot;The worst breach of etiquette imaginable&quot; is for a human to touch another person&#x27;s dæmon; even in battle, most soldiers would never touch an enemy&#x27;s dæmon, though there are exceptions (such as between lovers or in particularly violent fights). Dæmons can touch other dæmons freely; interactions between dæmons usually accentuate and illuminate the relationships between the characters, and can also be used as a means of passing information between humans without being overheard. The sexual element of human/dæmon interaction is also reflected when Pantalaimon and Kirjava assume their final forms, as they officially settle after Will and Lyra stroke the other&#x27;s dæmon.

During puberty, children&#x27;s dæmons &quot;settle&quot; into a form which reflects their mature personality. A person&#x27;s dæmon is usually of the opposite sex to its human; however, very occasionally, it may be the same sex as the person. Pullman said he doesn&#x27;t know why, and that it may also indicate some other gift or quality, such as second sight, or that the person is homosexual, adding &quot;There are plenty of things about my worlds I don&#x27;t know, and that&#x27;s one of them&quot;.

===Separation===
Normally, a person and their dæmon must stay within a few yards of each other. The exact distance the two can separate is unclear; Lee Scoresby expresses surprise when a bird dæmon travels forty yards from her human, while Lyra is uncomfortable when Pan goes to a second storey window while she is standing in front of the same building. However, witches and shamans&#x27; dæmons can travel separately. Such separation from one&#x27;s dæmon – sometimes called &quot;pulling&quot; – causes extreme pain and distress for both human and dæmon, and, given enough distance, results in death. 

The most detailed account in the books shows pulling to be torturous both physically – like &quot;an iron hand pulling one&#x27;s heart out between one&#x27;s ribs&quot; – and emotionally. A permanent separation between human and dæmon kills both and releases a huge burst of energy, which, for instance, is harnessed by Lord Asriel to blast a hole between two overlapping universes at the end of &quot;Northern Lights&quot;. The General Oblation Board initially accomplished this separation through simply tearing child and dæmon apart, but this generally resulted in the subject dying of shock.

Certain trained people, particularly witches and human shamans, have achieved the ability to survive separation from their dæmons by undergoing an initial voluntary separation done at a special location. For the witches this is at a canyon underneath the earth in Lyra&#x27;s world. Shamans endure gruelling ordeals that involve leaving their dæmon as they embark on a spiritual quest, crossing an area of death where nothing may grow or live. After rejoining their dæmon they gain the ability to separate from them to a far greater extent than previously, though both witches and shamans regain their intimate bond with their dæmon. Lyra and Will achieve the ability to be distant from their dæmons by going through the World of the Dead.

Some humans, for example, Marisa Coulter, are able to go farther from their dæmons than most others. Mrs. Coulter&#x27;s dæmon, a golden monkey, goes into Lyra&#x27;s room when she is staying with Mrs. Coulter to find her alethiometer (truth reader) despite not having undergone intercision, with Mrs. Coulter talking to Lyra perfectly normally at the same time. The reasons Mrs. Coulter can do this are not stated.

&quot;The Secret Commonwealth&quot; establishes that others have undergone separation from their dæmons or have pushed the bond past its usual limits. On one occasion, Pantalaimon discovers a woman who has become separated from her dæmon after a boat sank with the dæmon on it, the two having been unable to find each other after this even as the girl&#x27;s continued survival makes it clear that the dæmon is still alive. In Lyra&#x27;s search for Pantalaimon, after he leaves her following a conflict, Lyra learns that there are groups of poor in distant countries who actually sell their children&#x27;s dæmons through an organisation selling dæmons.

===Lifespan===
The books do not indicate when or how, or into what form, a dæmon is &quot;born&quot;, but a baby&#x27;s dæmon takes the form of a baby animal. When a person dies, their dæmon fades away like &quot;atoms of smoke.&quot; Likewise, when a dæmon is killed, its human dies as well. How a dæmon acquires a name is not explained in the books, but clarified by Philip Pullman as being normally given by the parents&#x27; dæmons. As Will Parry came from our world, his dæmon was not given a name in this way and was named Kirjava (meaning &quot;mottled&quot; in Finnish) by Serafina Pekkala when she first met the dæmon.

==Analysis==
Maude Hines in her essay on Philip Pullman&#x27;s work wrote that the concept of the dæmon, as a clearly fantastic element, epitomizes Bourdieu&#x27;s &quot;space of the possibles&quot;, and that the dæmon is &quot;an animal familiar like Jung&#x27;s &quot;anima/animus&quot;, which acts as an externalized conscience or soul&quot;. Maude Hines in her essay &quot;Second Nature: Daemons and Ideology in The Golden Compass&quot; called dæmons &quot;one of the most remarkable aspects&quot; of Pullman&#x27;s world, and notes that they &quot;function as conceit for playing out questions of the natural&quot; in it.

<doc id="842994" wikidata="Q5393446" url="?curid=842994" title="Ernest Lee Thomas">
<text>Ernest Lee Thomas (born March 26, 1949) is an American actor. He is best known for his role as Roger &quot;Raj&quot; Thomas on the 1970s ABC sitcom &quot;What&#x27;s Happening!!&quot; and its 1980s syndicated sequel, &quot;What&#x27;s Happening Now!!&quot;, and for his recurring role as Mr. Omar on &quot;Everybody Hates Chris&quot;.

==Early career and &quot;What&#x27;s Happening!!&quot;==

Thomas was born in Gary, Indiana, and began his professional acting career as a Broadway actor, appearing in the 1974 revival production of &quot;Love for Love&quot; and in the 1975 revival of &quot;The Member of the Wedding&quot;. Both shows starred actress Glenn Close. Shortly after he moved to Los Angeles to pursue a career as a TV/film actor. In the fall of 1975 he received a role on an episode of &quot;The Jeffersons&quot;. It was during the taping of the show that he learned of an audition for a sitcom loosely based on the 1975 film &quot;Cooley High&quot;. Thomas auditioned, won the lead role, and filmed the television pilot, which tested poorly. The concept was quickly reworked into a more light-hearted approach to the source material, and became known as &quot;Central Avenue&quot;, before settling on the title &quot;What&#x27;s Happening!!&quot;. Thomas was the only cast member retained from the pilot, and took the lead role of Roger &quot;Raj&quot; Thomas. The new &quot;summer series&quot; became a ratings hit, and was expanded to a full series, airing from 1976 to 1979.

During the show&#x27;s run, Thomas was involved in other film and TV projects including &quot;Baretta&quot;, &quot;The Brady Bunch Hour&quot; and the film &quot;A Piece of the Action&quot; starring Sidney Poitier and Bill Cosby. During the first season of &quot;What&#x27;s Happening!!&quot;, Thomas was one of the final two actors to be considered for the lead role of Kunta Kinte in the breakthrough miniseries &quot;Roots&quot;, which eventually went to LeVar Burton. Thomas would go on to play the smaller role of Kailuba in the miniseries.

==&quot;What&#x27;s Happening Now!!&quot; and later career==
After a six-year hiatus from TV and film acting, Ernest resumed his role as Roger &quot;Raj&quot; Thomas in the sequel &quot;What&#x27;s Happening Now!!&quot;. The show aired in first-run syndication from 1985 to 1988.

Since the show&#x27;s cancellation Thomas has guest starred on a number of popular TV dramas and sitcoms including &quot;In the Heat of the Night&quot; (which co-starred his TV wife Anne-Marie Johnson, from &quot;What&#x27;s Happening Now!!&quot;), &quot;The Parent &#x27;Hood&quot;, &quot;Martin&quot; (which starred his &quot;What&#x27;s Happening Now!!&quot; co-star Martin Lawrence), &quot;Soul Food&quot;, &quot;The Steve Harvey Show&quot;, &quot;All About the Andersons&quot; and more recently &quot;Just Jordan&quot;. He has also appeared in a number of films, including a supporting role in &quot;Malcolm X&quot; and a cameo in &quot;Dickie Roberts: Former Child Star&quot;. He later had a recurring role as funeral director, Mr. Omar, on the TV sitcom &quot;Everybody Hates Chris&quot;. He had an uncredited guest spot as Ernest T &quot;Bass&quot; on the TV show &quot;Are We There Yet?&quot;; it was titled &quot;The Satchel Paige Episode&quot; and had him playing a Flavor Flav-type personality.

In 2012, Thomas was cast in rocker/horror movie director Rob Zombie&#x27;s 2012 film &quot;The Lords of Salem&quot;. In 2016, he was in a comedic body horror short film called &quot;Earworm&quot;.

== Personal life ==
Thomas has stated in multiple interviews to have had a romantic relationship with actress Kim Cattrall during her time as a student at the American Academy of Dramatic Arts in the 1970s.

Thomas has an eye condition called amblyopia. He is a member of Kappa Alpha Psi fraternity.

<text>The Williamstown line is a commuter railway line in the city of Melbourne, Victoria, Australia. Operated by Metro Trains Melbourne, it is the city&#x27;s third shortest metropolitan railway line at . 

The line runs from Flinders Street station in central Melbourne to Williamstown station in the inner west, serving 12 stations via Footscray, Yarraville, and Newport. The line operates for approximately 19 hours a day (from approximately 5:00 am to around 12:00 am) with 24-hour service available on Friday and Saturday nights. During peak hours, the line operates with headways of up to 20 minutes, ensuring frequent service for commuters. During off-peak hours, the service intervals are adjusted to provide service every 20–30 minutes, accommodating the lower demand. Trains on the Williamstown Line run with two three-car formations of Comeng, Siemens Nexas, and X&#x27;Trapolis 100 trainsets.

Together with the Southern Cross to Sunbury portion of the Deniliquin railway line, it is the first and oldest government-built line in Victoria, having opened on 13 January 1859. The line was built to serve the port at Williamstown, giving it economic importance to the then-colony as it established itself as an important international passenger port. The line has played an important part in the development of Victoria&#x27;s railways, with the first workshops opening along the line in the 1800s.

Since the 2010s, due to the heavily utilised infrastructure of the Williamstown line, improvements and upgrades have been made. Works have included replacing sleepers, upgrading signalling technology, the removal of level crossings, the introduction of new rolling stock, and station accessibility upgrades.

== History ==

=== 19th century ===
Construction of the line was started by the Melbourne, Mount Alexander, and Murray River Railway Company (MMA&amp;MRR) with the construction of Batman Hill (now Southern Cross) station in 1853. Interestingly, the station did not see a train for another 6 years till services began in 1857. In response to 12 months of inaction by the MMA&amp;MRR and pressure from the government and financial backers, the company organised a gala event at Williamstown on 12 June 1854. 

Recognising the challenges faced by private companies and the pressing need for railway development, the government took action to address the situation. On 19 March 1856, despite only small sections being completed, the government intervened and acquired the line, assuming responsibility for its construction and further development.

In 1858, the Williamstown Workshops opened for the assembly of engines and carriages imported from England. Other buildings were soon added, with a total of seven locomotives built. During the late 1880s when railway management described the workshops as inadequate, moves were made to construct new workshops at Newport. By 1889 the new shops were open and Williamstown was closed.

Although it is now operated as a branch from the main Werribee/Geelong line at Newport, the line was originally built from the city with the Geelong line being the branch. The line officially opened in January 1859, but the section between the Newport Workshops and Williamstown Pier was in use by Geelong-line trains from October 1857 as it provided a connection to the ferry services departing from the pier. From Williamstown Pier, passengers could connect to a ferry across Hobsons Bay to Port Melbourne.

=== 20th century ===
In August 1920, the line was fully electrified from North Melbourne to the Williamstown Pier. Later in 1927, the section from South Kensington to Footscray received three-position signalling with further extensions of the three position signalling occurring in 1929 and 1997. 

Due to the proximity to the nearby wharf facilities, the Williamstown line provided a vital connection between Melbourne and the freight and passenger facilities at the port provided. The railway was built to serve the Government port at Williamstown, giving it great economic importance to the Colony of Victoria and establishing its role as an international passenger port. 

The Newport Workshops in Victoria have played a significant role in the railway system, highlighting their importance through various expansion initiatives. Notable expansions took place from 1905 to 1915 and again from 1925 to 1930. At the peak of operation it was one of Victoria&#x27;s largest and best-equipped engineering establishments, with up to 5,000 employees on site. The workshops had their own cricket grounds, and the game of Trugo is said to have been invented by workers on their lunch hour in the 1920s. In the late 1980s, the original segments of the workshops were removed from everyday use with modern workshops built along the eastern side of the site, which remains in use today. 

The only section of the line to have closed was the Williamstown to Williamstown Pier section which closed in March 1987.

=== 21st century ===
In January 2021, a major timetable rewrite resulted in increased frequencies and weekend daytime shuttle services being extended from Newport to Flinders Street. Peak hour weekday services now stop at South Kensington, which simplifies stopping patterns on the Werribee and Sunbury lines.

== Future ==

=== Level crossing removals ===

The Level Crossing Removal Project has announced the removal of 3 level crossings on the Williamstown line, to be completed in stages from 2021 to 2030. In 2021, one level crossing was removed at Ferguson Street in Williamstown. The crossing was removed by lowering the rail line onto a rail trench under the road, with the adjacent North Williamstown station also being lowered. A final two crossings will be removed along the line by 2030. The crossing at Hudsons Road in Spotswood will be removed by elevating the rail line above the road with Spotswood station also being rebuilt as part of the project. The crossing at Anderson Street, Yarraville, will be closed off as part of other level crossing removal works. At the end of these works, the Williamstown line will have 1 remaining crossing at Giffard St in Williamstown that is not scheduled for removal.

=== Network reconfiguration ===
When the new cross-city rail corridor being built by the Metro Tunnel opens in 2025 there will be a reorganisation of the Melbourne rail network. The Victorian Department of Transport and Planning plans to return the Frankston line to the City Loop, with dedicated use of the Caulfield group tunnel track. This will mean Frankston line trains will no longer through-run with Werribee and Williamstown line trains, and will again stop at City Loop stations Flagstaff, Melbourne Central and Parliament. As part of the reconfiguration, the Werribee and Williamstown lines would instead begin through-running services to Sandringham for the first time.

== Network and operations ==

=== Services ===
Services on the Williamstown line operate from approximately 5:00 am to around 12:00 am daily. In general, during peak hours, train frequency is 10 minutes while services during non-peak hours drop to 20–40 minutes throughout the entire route. Services do not run through the City Loop, instead terminating at Flinders Street. Rather than running through the City Loop, services continue onto the Frankston line with boosted frequencies in combination with the Werribee line. During periods with low patronage, shuttle services operate between Newport and Williamstown operate in the evenings, weekend mornings, and as part of the Night Network. Night Network operates on Friday nights and weekends, with services running 24 hours a day with 60-minute frequencies available outside of normal operating hours.

Train services on the Williamstown line are also subjected to maintenance and renewal works, usually on selected Fridays and Saturdays. Shuttle bus services are provided throughout the duration of works for affected commuters.

=== Operators ===

The Williamstown line has had a total of 8 operators since its opening in 1859. The first section of the line from near Newport to Williamstown Pier was originally opened by the government in 1857 and used by the Geelong and Melbourne Railway Company (G&amp;MR) until the remainder of the government line to Spencer Street (now Southern Cross) opened 2 years later in 1859. This was operated by the government under the newly formed Victorian Railways (VR) using the full length from Williamstown Pier to Spencer Street (G&amp;MR then used the VR line from Newport to Spencer Street). Many operators throughout its history have been government run. From its government acquisition in 1856 until the 1999 privatisation of Melbourne&#x27;s rail network, four different government operators have run the line. These operators, Victorian Railways, the Metropolitan Transit Authority, the Public Transport Corporation, and Bayside Trains have a combined operational length of 141 years.

Bayside Trains was privatised in August 1999 and later rebranded M&gt;Train. In 2002, M&gt;Train was placed into receivership and the state government regained ownership of the line, with KPMG appointed as receivers to operate M&gt;Train on behalf of the state government. Two years later, rival train operator Connex Melbourne took over the M&gt;Train operations including the Williamstown line. Metro Trains Melbourne, the current private operator, then took over the operations in 2009. The private operators have had a combined operational period of years.
=== Route ===


The Williamstown line forms a mostly straight route from the Melbourne central business district to its terminus in Williamstown. The route is long and is fully doubled tracked from Flinders Street to its terminus (excluding Williamstown station where the track narrows to one track at the single platform). After changing from Frankston services at Flinders Street, the Williamstown line traverses flat country with few curves and minimal earthworks for most of the line. Some sections of the line have been elevated or lowered to remove level crossings, including at Williamstown North station. There is only one crossing remaining on the line which is not scheduled to be removed.

The line follows the same alignment as the Werribee line with the two services splitting onto different routes at Newport. The Williamstown line continues its southern alignment, whereas the Werribee line takes a western alignment towards their final destinations. Most of the rail line goes through built-up suburbs and heavy industrial areas.

=== Stations ===
The line serves 12 stations across of track. The stations are a mix of elevated, lowered, and ground level designs. The many elevated and lowered stations being constructed as part of level crossing removals. From 2030, Spotswood station will be elevated as part of additional level crossing removal works.


== Infrastructure ==

=== Rolling stock ===
The Williamstown line uses diverse types of electric multiple unit (EMU) trains that are operated in a split six-car configuration, with three doors per side on each carriage. The primary rolling stock featured on the line is the Comeng EMUs, built by Commonwealth Engineering between 1981 and 1988. These train sets are the oldest on the Melbourne rail network and subsequently will be replaced by the mid 2030s. Siemens Nexas EMUs are also widely featured on the line, originally built between 2002 and 2005. These train sets feature more modern technology than the Comeng trains. The final type of rolling stock featured on the line is the X&#x27;Trapolis 100 built by Alstom between 2002 and 2004 as well as between 2009 and 2020. All of these rolling stock models are widely used on other lines across the metropolitan network and work as the backbone of the network. 

Alongside the passenger trains, Williamstown line tracks and equipment are maintained by a fleet of engineering trains. The four types of engineering trains are: the shunting train; designed for moving trains along non-electrified corridors and for transporting other maintenance locomotives, for track evaluation; designed for evaluating track and its condition, the overhead inspection train; designed for overhead wiring inspection, and the infrastructure evaluation carriage designed for general infrastructure evaluation. Most of these trains are repurposed locomotives previously used by V/Line, Metro Trains, and the Southern Shorthaul Railroad.

=== Accessibility ===

In compliance with the Disability Discrimination Act of 1992, all stations that are new-built or rebuilt are fully accessible and comply with these guidelines. The majority of stations on the corridor are fully accessible, however, there are some stations that have not been upgraded to meet these guidelines. These stations do feature ramps, however, they have a gradient greater than 1 in 14. Stations that are fully accessible feature ramps that have a gradient less than 1 in 14, have at-grade paths, or feature lifts. These stations typically also feature tactile boarding indicators, independent boarding ramps, wheelchair accessible myki barriers, hearing loops, and widened paths.

Projects improving station accessibility have included the Level Crossing Removal Project, which involves station rebuilds and upgrades and other individual station upgrade projects. These works have made significant strides in improving network accessibility, with more than 75% of Williamstown line stations classed as fully accessible. This number is expected to grow within the coming years with the completion of level crossing removal works on the corridor by 2029.

=== Signalling ===
The Williamstown line uses three position signalling which is widely used across the Melbourne train network. Three position signalling was first introduced in 1927, with the last section of the line converted to the new type of signalling in 1997.

<doc id="843005" wikidata="Q7380131" url="?curid=843005" title="Runts">
<text>Runts are crunchy candies sold by Ferrara Candy Company. First seen on the market in 1982, the candies are in the shape, color, and flavor of a selection of fruits. Runts have a hard candy shell with a compressed dextrose center (similar to the consistency of SweeTarts).

==Flavor changes==
Since its introduction, Runts has offered four flavor assortments.
*In 1982, Runts were introduced with banana, cherry, strawberry, orange, and lime.
*In the late 1990s, watermelon and blue raspberry were added. Lime was discontinued.
*In 2007, the flavor assortment was changed to a more tropical-themed array. Pineapple and mango were introduced. Watermelon, blue raspberry, and cherry were all discontinued.
*In 2009, green apple and grape were added to the mix. Pineapple and mango were removed. Green apple reused the cherry shape, and grape reused the mango shape.

==Varieties==
A chewy version of Runts known as Chewy Runts was previously available, including the same mix of fruits as the original crunchy runts. Chewy Runts were discontinued in 2014.

A seasonal product named Runts Freckled Eggs was released each year for Easter. The candy pieces were not shaped like fruits as in every other Runts mix. Instead, they were all shaped like eggs. Freckled eggs were available in large bags and smaller single-serve boxes with a built-in handle.

In the 1990s, a variation known as Tropical Runts was available. The pineapple and mango Runts originated in this candy.

A similar variant, Rock&#x27;n Runts existed in the 1990s, containing watermelon, grape, pineapple, lemon, and raspberry.

==Other changes==
Originally, Runts had colorful centers that matched the color of the outer shell. The colorful centers have since been discontinued, as current Runts contain a white center.

==Ingredients and nutrition information==
Ingredients:
dextrose, maltodextrin, and less than 2% of corn syrup, malic acid, calcium stearate, carnauba wax, artificial flavors, color added (red 40 lake, yellow 5, yellow 5 lake, yellow 6).

As stated by the Ferrara website, Runts are sold in a theater box of 5 oz.

Nutrition facts as given on a box of Runts:

<text>The Thousand Character Classic (), also known as the Thousand Character Text, is a Chinese poem that has been used as a primer for teaching Chinese characters to children from the sixth century onward. It contains exactly one thousand characters, each used only once, arranged into 250 lines of four characters apiece and grouped into four line rhyming stanzas to facilitate easy memorization. It is sung, akin to alphabet songs for phonetic writing systems. Along with the &quot;Three Character Classic&quot; and the &quot;Hundred Family Surnames&quot;, it formed the basis of traditional literacy training in the Sinosphere.

The first line is &quot;Tian di xuan huang&quot; () and the last line, &quot;Yan zai hu ye&quot; () explains the use of the grammatical particles , , , and .

==History==

There are several stories of the work&#x27;s origin. One says that Emperor Wu of the Liang dynasty (r. 502–549) commissioned Zhou Xingsi (, 470–521) to compose this poem for his prince to practice calligraphy. Another says that the emperor commanded Wang Xizhi, a noted calligrapher, to write out one thousand characters and give them to Zhou as a challenge to make into an ode. Another story is that the emperor commanded his princes and court officers to compose essays and ordered another minister to copy them on a thousand slips of paper, which became mixed and scrambled. Zhou was given the task of restoring these slips to their original order. He worked so intensely to finish doing so overnight that his hair turned completely white.

The &quot;Thousand Character Classic&quot; is understood to be one of the most widely read texts in China in the first millennium. The popularity of the book in the Tang dynasty is shown by the fact that there were some 32 copies found in the Dunhuang archaeological excavations. By the Song dynasty, since all literate people could be assumed to have memorized the text, the order of its characters was used to put documents in sequence in the same way that alphabetical order is used in alphabetic languages.

The Buddhist Uyghur Kingdom of Qocho used the thousand character classic and the Qieyun and it was written that &quot;In Qocho city were more than fifty monasteries, all titles of which are granted by the emperors of the Tang dynasty, which keep many Buddhist texts as Tripitaka, Tangyun, Yupuan, Jingyin etc.&quot;

In the dynasties following the Song, the &quot;Three Character Classic&quot;, &quot;Hundred Family Surnames&quot;, and &quot;1,000 Character Classic&quot; came to be known collectively as &quot;San Bai Qian&quot; (Three, Hundred, Thousand), from the first character in their titles. They were the almost universal introductory literacy texts for students, almost exclusively boys, from elite backgrounds and even for a number of ordinary villagers. Each was available in many versions, printed cheaply, and available to all since they did not become superseded. When a student had memorized all three, he could recognize and pronounce, though not necessarily write or understand the meaning of, roughly 2,000 characters (there was some duplication among the texts). Since Chinese did not use an alphabet, this was an effective, albeit time-consuming, way of giving a &quot;crash course&quot; in character recognition before going on to understanding texts and writing characters.

During the Song dynasty, the noted neo-Confucianism scholar Zhu Xi, inspired by the three classics, wrote &quot;Xiaoxue&quot; or &quot;Elementary Learning&quot;.

== Calligraphy ==
Due to the fact that the &quot;Thousand Character Classic&quot; contains a thousand unique Chinese characters, and its wide circulation, it has been highly favored by calligraphers in East Asian countries. According to the &quot;Xuanhe Calligraphy Catalogue (宣和画谱),&quot; the Northern Song imperial collection included twenty-three authentic works by Sui dynasty calligrapher Zhiyong (a descendant of Wang Xizhi), fifteen of which were copies of the &quot;Thousand Character Classic&quot;.

Chinese calligraphers such as Chu Suiliang, Sun Guoting, Zhang Xu, Huaisu, Mi Yuanzhang (Northern Song), Emperor Gaozong of Southern Song, Emperor Huizong of Song, Zhao Mengfu, and Wen Zhengming all have notable calligraphic works of the &quot;Thousand Character Classic&quot;. Manuscripts unearthed from Dunhuang also contain practice fragments of the &quot;Thousand Character Classic&quot;, indicating that by the 7th century at the latest, using the &quot;Thousand Character Classic&quot; to practice Chinese calligraphy had become quite widespread.

==Japan==
Wani, a semi-legendary Chinese-Baekje scholar, is said to have translated the &quot;Thousand Character Classic&quot; to Japanese along with 10 books of the &quot;Analects of Confucius&quot; during the reign of Emperor Ōjin (r. 370?-410?). However, this alleged event precedes the composition of the &quot;Thousand Character Classic&quot;. This makes many assume that the event is simply fiction, but some believe it to be based in fact, perhaps using a different version of the &quot;Thousand Character Classic&quot;.

== Korea ==

The &quot;Thousand Character Classic&quot; has been used as a primer for learning Chinese characters for many centuries. It is uncertain when the &quot;Thousand Character Classic&quot; was introduced to Korea.

The book is noted as a principal force—along with the introduction of Buddhism into Korea—behind the introduction of Chinese characters into the Korean language. Hanja was the sole means of writing Korean until the Hangul script was created under the direction of King Sejong the Great in the 15th century; however, even after the invention of Hangul, most Korean scholars continued to write in Hanja until the late 19th century.

The &quot;Thousand Character Classic&#x27;s&quot; use as a writing primer for children began in 1583, when King Seonjo ordered Han Ho (1544–1605) to carve the text into wooden printing blocks.

The &quot;Thousand Character Classic&quot; has its own form in representing the Chinese characters. For each character, the text shows its meaning (Korean Hanja: ; &#x27; or &#x27;) and sound (Korean Hanja: ; &#x27;). The vocabulary to represent the &#x27; has remained unchanged in every edition, despite the natural evolution of the Korean language since then. However, in the editions &quot;Gwangju Thousand Character Classic&quot; and &quot;Seokbong Thousand Character Classic&quot;, both written in the 16th century, there are a number of different meanings expressed for the same character. The types of changes of &quot;&quot; in &quot;Seokbong Thousand Character Classic&quot; into those in &quot;Gwangju Thousand Character Classic&quot; fall roughly under the following categories:

#Definitions turned more generalized or more concrete when semantic scope of each character had been changed
#Former definitions were replaced by synonyms
#Parts of speech in the definitions were changed

From these changes, replacements between native Korean and Sino-Korean can be found. Generally, &quot;rare &quot;&quot; vocabularies&quot; are presumed to be pre-16th century, for it is thought that they may be a fossilized form of native Korean vocabulary or affected by the influence of a regional dialect in Jeolla Province.

South Korean senior scholar, Daesan Kim Seok-jin (Korean Hangul: ), expressed the significance of Thousand Character Classic by contrasting the Western &quot;concrete science&quot; and the Asian &quot;metaphysics&quot; and &quot;origin-oriented thinking&quot; in which &quot;it is the collected poems of nature of cosmos and reasons behind human life&quot;.

The first 44 characters of the Thousand Character Classic were used on the reverse sides of some cash coins of the Korean mun currency to indicate furnace or &quot;series&quot; numbers.

== Vietnam ==

There is a version of &quot;Thousand Character Classic&quot; that was changed to the Vietnamese lục bát (chữ Hán: 六八) verse form. The text itself is called Thiên tự văn giải âm (chữ Hán: 千字文解音), and it was published in 1890 by Quan Văn Đường (chữ Hán: 觀文堂). The text is annotated with chữ Nôm characters, for example, the character 地 is annotated with its chữ Nôm equivalent 坦. Because it was changed to the lục bát verse form, many characters are changed such as in the first line,

==Manchu texts==
Several different Manchu texts of the &quot;Thousand Character Classic&quot; are known today. They all use the Manchu script to transcribe Chinese characters. They are utilized in research on Chinese phonology.

The &quot;Man han ciyan dzi wen&quot; () written by Chen Qiliang (), contains Chinese text and Manchu phonetic transcription. This version was published during the reign of the Kangxi Emperor.

Another text, the &quot;Qing Shu Qian Zi Wen&quot; () by You Zhen (), was published in 1685 as a supplement to the &quot;Baiti Qing Wen&quot; (). It provides Manchu transcription without original Chinese. It is known for being referred to by Japanese scholar Ogyū Sorai for Manchu studies as early as the 18th century.

The undated &quot;ciyan dzi wen&quot; which is owned by the Bibliothèque nationale de France is a variant of the &quot;Qing Shu Qian Zi Wen&quot;. It is believed to have been used by the translation office of the Joseon Dynasty of Korea. It contains Hangul transcription for both Manchu and Chinese. It is valuable to the study of Manchu phonology.

== Text variants ==
The text of the &quot;Qiānzì Wén&quot; is not available in an authoritative, standardized version. Comparison of various manuscript, printed and electronic editions shows that these do not all contain exactly the same 1,000 characters. In many cases the differences concern just small graphic variations (for example character no. 4, 黃 or 黄, both &quot;huáng&quot; &quot;yellow&quot;). In other cases variant characters are quite different, although still associated with the same pronunciation and meaning (for example character no. 123, 一 or 壹, both &quot;yì&quot; &quot;one&quot;). In a few cases, variant characters represent different pronunciations and meanings (for example character no. 132, 竹 &quot;zhú&quot; &quot;bamboo&quot; or 樹 &quot;shù&quot; &quot;tree&quot;). These textual variants are not noted or discussed in any existing edition of the text in a western language. In fact, even the text appended to this article differs from the text presented in Wikisource in 25 places (nos. 123 一/壹, 132 竹/樹, 428 郁/鬱, 438 彩/綵, 479 群/羣, 482 稿/稾, 554 回/迴, 617 岳/嶽, 619 泰/恆, 643 綿/緜, 645 岩/巖/, 693 鑒/鑑, 733 沉/沈/, 767 蚤/早, 776 搖/颻, 787 玩/翫, 803 餐/飡, 846 筍/笋, 849 弦/絃, 852 宴/讌, 854 杯/盃, 881 箋/牋, 953 璿/璇, 980 庄/莊). A critical text edition of the &quot;Qiānzì Wén&quot;, based upon the best manuscript and printed sources, has not yet been attempted.

<doc id="843018" wikidata="Q7417061" url="?curid=843018" title="Sandwell Valley Country Park">
<text>Sandwell Valley Country Park is a country park, run by Sandwell Metropolitan Borough Council, in Sandwell Valley, on the River Tame in the middle of the urban conurbation between Birmingham and West Bromwich in West Midlands, England.

== Location and features ==

The country park stretches from the A41 at West Bromwich to the edge of Walsall. The main entrances to the site are at Sandwell Park Farm, Salter&#x27;s Lane, West Bromwich, B71 4BG. Forge Mill Farm, Forge Lane, West Bromwich B71 3SZ.

Leisure facilities include a pitch &amp; putt golf course, a Millennium Cycle Route, a Mountain Bike Trail, tennis courts and open spaces. Swan Pool (also known as Wasson or Warstone) is used for sailing.

The park has received a Green Flag Award.

Sandwell Valley parkrun happens here every Saturday morning at 9.00am. This is a free, timed, 5 kilometre event for walkers, joggers and runners which is organised by volunteers.

==Local nature reserves==
Priory Woods and Forge Mill Lake, both local nature reserves (LNRs) since 1991, are within the park.

Priory Woods LNR has an area of . It has woodland, with many varieties of native trees and introduced species; pools, inhabited by wildfowl; and it contains the ruins of Sandwell Priory. Footpaths in the reserve link to other areas of the country park. The car park for the reserve is at Sandwell Park Farm.
Forge Mill Lake LNR has an area of . The lake is alongside the River Tame, and there is a footpath around it. The car park for the reserve is close to Forge Mill Farm, on Forge Lane.

Sandwell Valley RSPB reserve manages part of Forge Mill Lake, including one of the two islands in the lake; there is a bird hide and an RSPB visitor centre. The reserve is important for breeding birds including oystercatchers and lapwings. A car park is next to the visitor centre.

There are two working farm visitor centres. Sandwell Park Farm is a restored Victorian farm with a walled kitchen garden; it has rare breeds including Hereford cattle and Berkshire pigs. Forge Mill Farm has a farm shop and a farm trail.

== History ==

Sandwell Valley Country Park was once the site of Sandwell Priory, a 12th-century Benedictine monastery which itself was founded on the site of an earlier hermitage. The monastery was closed on the orders of Cardinal Wolsey in 1525, and by 1705 the land was redeveloped once more, into Sandwell Hall, built for the Earl of Dartmouth.

From the late 19th century the Hall was used as an asylum, and then in 1907, a home for boys, &quot;Sandwell Hall Industrial School for Mentally Defective Boys&quot;. In 1928 Sandwell Hall was demolished due to subsidence caused by mining from Sandwell Park (Jubilee) Colliery which employed over 600 miners. A coal tramway ran from the Jubilee pit through the Sandwell Park to the canal at Smethwick. By the 1960s the site was developed into the Country Park with up to set aside for amenities.

<doc id="843020" wikidata="Q2711149" url="?curid=843020" title="Blind Willie McTell (song)">
<text>&quot;Blind Willie McTell&quot; is a song written and performed by American singer-songwriter Bob Dylan. Named for the blues singer of the same name, the song was recorded in the spring of 1983, during the sessions for Dylan&#x27;s album &quot;Infidels&quot;; however, it was ultimately left off the album and did not receive an official release until 1991, when it appeared on &quot;The Bootleg Series Volumes 1–3 (Rare &amp; Unreleased) 1961–1991&quot;. It was also later anthologized on &quot;Dylan&quot; (2007).

==Composition and recording==
The song&#x27;s melody is loosely based on the jazz standard &quot;St. James Infirmary Blues&quot;. For the version included on &quot;The Bootleg Series Volumes 1–3&quot;, Dylan plays piano and is accompanied only by Mark Knopfler on acoustic guitar. The lyrics are comparable to later Dylan songs &quot;High Water (For Charley Patton)&quot; and &quot;Goodbye Jimmy Reed&quot; in that they pay tribute to the titular blues singer indirectly. Dylan sings a series of plaintive verses depicting allegorical scenes which reflect on the history of American music and slavery. Each verse ends with the same refrain: &quot;Nobody can sing the blues like Blind Willie McTell&quot;. There was also an electric version of the song recorded with Mick Taylor playing slide guitar.

==Critical reception and legacy==

Following three albums with overt Christian themes, &quot;Infidels&quot; struck most major rock critics as dealing largely with secular concerns, and they hailed it as a comeback. When bootleggers released the outtakes from &quot;Infidels&quot;, the song was recognized as a composition approaching the quality of such classics as &quot;Tangled Up in Blue&quot;, &quot;Like a Rolling Stone&quot; and &quot;All Along the Watchtower&quot;. According to Dylan biographer Clinton Heylin, the song is regarded by many as &quot;Dylan&#x27;s one indisputable masterpiece of the early eighties&quot;.

&quot;Spectrum Culture&quot; included the song on a list of &quot;Bob Dylan&#x27;s 20 Best Songs of the 1980s&quot;. In an article accompanying the list, critic Peter Tabakis describes it as &quot;a six-minute repudiation of any argument that somehow insists Dylan&#x27;s &#x27;80s output was fallow. The song, with its spare and dramatic piano backbone by Dylan himself, accented with Knopfler&#x27;s haunting guitar notes, seems performed in an open field at midnight. The tableau is as cinematic as Dylan gets. An arrow swings on a doorpost. An owl hoots. Feathered maidens strut. Martyrs fall. A canopy of stars hovering over &#x27;barren trees&#x27; transforms into an uproarious crowd&quot;.

Greil Marcus, from the vantage point of 2021, wrote of the song: &quot;Over three decades, that little rehearsal has emerged as one of Dylan&#x27;s greatest songs—or even, perhaps, in the right mood, his greatest recording. From the start, it had a burgeoning charisma: the more you played it, the more it demanded that the volume go up, a fraction every time, until you hit the limit and realized it still wasn&#x27;t loud enough&quot;.

Drive-By Truckers&#x27; Patterson Hood cited it as his favorite Dylan song in a 2021 &quot;Stereogum&quot; article, writing, &quot;With McTell as a starting point, Dylan constructed a time travel from slave days through the Jim Crow South with a kitchen sink full of delta imagery, Bible scripture, and vaudevillian shuck and jive. Yet, as it goes with the best of songs, it also remains elusive and mysterious, benefitting as much from what it leaves out as for what it actually says&quot;.

Michael Gray&#x27;s book &quot;Song and Dance Man III: The Art of Bob Dylan&quot; (2000) includes a chapter on this song and its musical and historical background.

&quot;The Guardian&quot; in one of its article from 2021 included the song on a list of &quot;80 Bob Dylan songs everyone should know&quot;.

==In live performance==
&quot;Blind Willie McTell&quot; was a concert staple for the Band throughout the 1990s. They also recorded it for their 1993 album &quot;Jericho&quot;. Dylan later claimed in a &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; interview that hearing the Band&#x27;s version of the song inspired him to begin performing it at his own concerts:

Dylan can&#x27;t possibly be sorry that the world has had the benefit of hearing, for instance, &quot;Blind Willie McTell&quot;, – an outtake from 1983&#x27;s &quot;Infidels&quot; that has subsequently risen as high in most people&#x27;s Dylan pantheon as a song can rise, and that he himself has played live since. Can he? Bob Dylan – &quot;I started playing it live because I heard the Band doing it. Most likely it was a demo, probably showing the musicians how it should go. It was never developed fully, I never got around to completing it. There wouldn&#x27;t have been any other reason for leaving it off the record. It&#x27;s like taking a painting by Monet or Picasso – goin&#x27; to his house and lookin&#x27; at a half-finished painting and grabbing it and selling it to people who are &#x27;Picasso fans.&#x27;&quot;

According to his official website, Dylan performed the song 226 times on the Never Ending Tour between 1997 and 2017. An August 17, 1997 concert performance appeared on various releases of his &quot;Love Sick&quot; single in June 1998. Dylan also performed a version of the song, hailed as &quot;absolutely stellar&quot; by &quot;Rolling Stone&quot;, for a televised tribute to Martin Scorsese at the Critics&#x27; Choice Movie Awards in 2012.

==Other versions==

Two different full-band versions from the &quot;Infidels&quot; sessions in 1983 were officially released in 2021, one on &quot;The Bootleg Series Vol. 16: Springtime in New York 1980–1985&quot;, and another on a vinyl single released by Third Man Records.

==Notable covers==
This song has been covered by various artists, including: the Band, Chrissie Hynde and Mick Taylor.

<text>The Sunbury line is a commuter railway line in the city of Melbourne, Victoria, Australia. Operated by Metro Trains Melbourne, it is the city&#x27;s fifth longest metropolitan railway line at . The line runs from Flinders Street station in central Melbourne to Sunbury station in the city&#x27;s north-west, serving 18 stations via North Melbourne, Sunshine, St Albans, and Watergardens. The line operates for approximately 19 hours a day (from approximately 5:00 am to around 12:00 am) with 24 hour service available on Friday and Saturday nights. During peak hour, headways of up to 5 minutes are operated with services every 20–30 minutes during off-peak hours. Train sets typically used on the Sunbury line are the Comeng and Siemens Nexas trainsets and, for two morning peak services, the High Capacity Metro Train. 

The Victorian Railways began services in February 1859 on the line originally built to serve the town of Bendigo by the Melbourne, Mount Alexander and Murray River Railway Company. The line was progressively electrified over time, with electrification to St Albans in 1921, to Sydenham in 2002, and finally to Sunbury in 2012.

Since the 2000s, due to the heavily utilised infrastructure of the Sunbury line, improvements and upgrades have been made. Works have included replacing sleepers, upgrading signalling technology, two line extension projects, the construction of new stations, the removal of level crossings, the introduction of new rolling stock, and station accessibility upgrades.

Beginning in 2025, the Sunbury Line will be through routed with the Pakenham and Cranbourne line running through the Metro Tunnel via Town Hall station.

== History ==

=== 19th century ===
The Melbourne, Mount Alexander and Murray River Railway Company started to build a rail line to Bendigo before operations were taken over by the Department of Railways then the Victorian Railways. The line had been extended as far as Sunbury by February 1859. The line was duplicated between Footscray and Sunbury in early July 1859.

=== 20th century ===
Electrification of the line to St Albans was completed in October 1921, although electrification has already occurred to North Melbourne in May 1919 as part of the Essendon line electrification, and to Footscray in August 1920 as part of the Williamstown line electrification. Electrification shaved 10 minutes off the trip from St Albans to the city.

North Melbourne to South Kensington was quadruplicated in 1924, and South Kensington to Footscray in November 1976. Automatic block signalling was provided between South Kensington and Footscray (and Yarraville on the Williamstown line) in August 1927, from Footscray to West Footscray in October 1927, North Melbourne to South Kensington in June 1928, Sunshine to Albion in July 1929, West Footscray to Sunshine in October 1929, and Albion to St Albans in February 1930, thus resulting in the entire electrified line being provided with this signalling.

=== 21st century ===
==== Sydenham extension ====

On 27 January 2002, electrification of the St Albans line was extended along the regional V/Line tracks to Sydenham. The Sydenham electrification resulted in the closure of the original Sydenham station; a new station was built 600 metres south and named after the nearby Watergardens Town Centre. Additionally, another station was constructed in St Albans called Keilor Plains.

==== Sunbury extension ====

Proposals for an extension of electrified metropolitan services to Sunbury have dated as far back as the 1969 Melbourne Transportation Plan. $270 million was set aside to complete electrification works as part of the 2008 Victorian Transport Plan, with works completed in 2012. 

There was some opposition to electrification. Concerns included a less comfortable journey, the removal of toilet facilities, the presence of a conductor, potential overcrowding, and congestion at level crossings due to the increase in the number of services. Bendigo line users also raised concern that electrification to Sunbury would slow down their trains to Melbourne. Ian Dobbs, then head of Public Transport Victoria acknowledged this issue, stating that &quot;there&#x27;s a slight slow-down of services on that particular corridor with this timetable, because we&#x27;re putting more Metro services in the mix.&quot;

On 18 November 2012, the newly electrified line was renamed from the Sydenham line to the Sunbury line. Completion of the electrification increased the service frequency of Sunbury and Diggers Rest stations to 489 trains per week, an increase of 64% from the 298 trains per week when the service was operated by V/Line.

==== Sunbury Line Upgrade ====
In 2019, works began on the $2.1 billion Sunbury Line Upgrade project, delivered by the Rail Projects Victoria. The project upgraded the line to support the introduction of High Capacity Metro Train (HCMT) rolling stock and &quot;take full advantage of the extra capacity created by the Metro Tunnel&quot; which will open in 2025.

Works delivered as part of the project include the installation of five new electrical substations: one in Delahey (near Watergardens station), one in Calder Park, rail yard two in St Albans, and one in Albion; ten more across the line were upgraded along with improvements to overhead wiring and signalling equipment to enable the use of &quot;high capacity signalling&quot; (a form of communications-based train control) in the Metro Tunnel. Platforms were extended at Sunbury, Watergardens, Albion, Sunshine, Tottenham, West Footscray, Middle Footscray, and Footscray stations to support the longer HCMT rolling stock. Raised boarding pads were installed at Sunbury, Diggers Rest, Watergardens, Keilor Plains, Albion, Sunshine, and Footscray stations to improve wheelchair accessibility. Train stabling facilities at Sunbury, Calder Park, and Watergardens were upgraded, the level crossing at Gap Road, Sunbury was removed, and the tracks connecting the Sunbury line to the Metro Tunnel&#x27;s portal at South Kensington station were laid.

== Future ==

=== Metro Tunnel ===
The 2012 Network Development Plan identified the need for a north–south tunnel connecting the Sunbury line to the Cranbourne and Pakenham lines. In 2017, the Metro Tunnel project began construction, consisting of twin tunnels bored underground between South Kensington and South Yarra stations, with five new stations along the route: Arden, Parkville, State Library (connecting to Melbourne Central), Town Hall (connecting to Flinders Street), and Anzac. These works will be completed by 2025, and upon completion, will create a singular rail line from Sunbury to Pakenham.

=== Level crossing removals ===

The Level Crossing Removal Project has announced the removal of all 7 remaining level crossings on the Sunbury line, completed in stages from 2016 to 2025. In 2016, the level crossings at Furlong Road and Main Road, St Albans, were removed by lowering the rail line into a trench under the roads; St Albans and Ginifer stations were rebuilt. Another crossing was removed by elevating a section of the Melton Highway in Sydenham onto a bridge above the rail line in 2018. The remaining level crossings are planned to be removed in 2025. The crossings at Old Calder Highway, Watsons Road, and Calder Park Drive will be removed by building road bridges over the rail line, and the Holden Road crossing will be closed to car traffic.

=== Infill Stations ===
Currently, There is only one station proposed to be built on the Sunbury Line being at Calder Park. The station is planned to be located adjacent to Calder Park Drive.

== Network and operations ==

=== Services ===
Services on the Sunbury line operates from approximately 5:00 am to around 12:00 daily. In general, during peak hours, train frequency is 5–20 minutes in the AM peak on the Sunbury line while during non-peak hours the frequency is reduced to 20–30 minutes throughout the entire route. On Friday nights and weekends, services run 24 hours a day, with 60 minute frequencies available outside of normal operating hours.

Train services on the Sunbury line are also subjected to maintenance and renewal works, usually on selected Fridays and Saturdays. Shuttle bus services are provided throughout the duration of works for affected commuters.

==== Stopping patterns ====

=== Operators ===
The Sunbury line has had a total of 7 operators since its opening in 1859. The majority of operations throughout its history have been government run: from its first service in 1859 until the 1999 privatisation of Melbourne&#x27;s rail network, four different government operators have run the line. These operators, Victorian Railways, the Metropolitan Transit Authority, the Public Transport Corporation, and Bayside Trains have a combined operational length of 141 years.

Bayside Trains was privatised in August 1999 and later rebranded M&gt;Train. In 2002, M&gt;Train was placed into receivership and the state government regained ownership of the line, with KPMG appointed as receivers to operate M&gt;Train on behalf of the state government. Two years later, rival train operator Connex Melbourne took over the M&gt;Train operations including the Sunbury line. Metro Trains Melbourne, the current private operator, then took over the operations in 2009. The private operators have had a combined operational period of years.
=== Route ===

The Sunbury line forms a relatively linear route from the Melbourne central business district to its terminus in Sunbury. The route is long and is fully doubled tracked from Flinders Street to its termnius. The only underground section of the Sunbury line is in the City Loop, where the service stops at 3 underground stations. Exiting the city, the Sunbury line traverses mainly flat country, except on the west bank of the Maribyrnong River where it requires some moderately heavy earthworks. The line is paralleled by a double track goods line and the interstate standard gauge line, the latter being dual gauge with the goods line to West Footscray. The goods line joins the Sunbury line at Sunshine, whilst the standard gauge line to Sydney continues to run alongside the suburban line to Albion, where it and a goods line head off in a north-easterly direction. Some sections of the line has been elevated or lowered into a cutting to eliminate level crossings.

The line follows the same alignment as multiple lines with the Sunbury line splitting off at North Melbourne. The Sunbury line continues on its western (then northern) alignment, whereas the other lines continue onto a northern, western, or south-western alignment. Most of the rail line goes through built-up suburbs and some industrial areas before becoming more rural before the end of the line.

=== Stations ===
The line serves 18 stations across of track. The stations are a mix of elevated, lowered, underground, and ground level designs. Underground stations are present only in the City Loop, with the majority of elevated and lowered stations being constructed as part of level crossing removals. From 2025, services will cease to stop at Southern Cross, Flagstaff, Melbourne Central, Parliament, and North Melbourne stations due to the opening of the Metro Tunnel.

==== Planned stations ====
== Infrastructure ==

=== Rolling stock ===
The Sunbury line uses Comeng and Siemens Nexas electric multiple unit (EMU) operating in a split six-car configuration and, for the two morning peak services, the High Capacity Metro Trains (EMU) operating in a seven-car configuration, with three doors per side on each carriage and can accommodate of up to 1,380 passengers in each train-set. The primary rolling stock featured on the line is the Comeng (EMU), with three doors per side on each carriage. These trains were built by Commonwealth Engineering between 1981 and 1989. These train sets are the oldest on the Melbourne rail network and the line will be operated by the High Capacity Metro Train (EMU) once the Metro Tunnel opens in 2025. The second type of rolling stock is the Siemens Nexas EMUs which are also widely featured on the line, originally built between 2002 and 2005 these train sets feature more modern technology than the Comeng trains.

Alongside the passenger trains, Sunbury line tracks and equipment are maintained by a fleet of engineering trains. The four types of engineering trains are: the shunting train; designed for moving trains along non-electrified corridors and for transporting other maintenance locomotives, for track evaluation; designed for evaluating track and its condition, the overhead inspection train; designed for overhead wiring inspection, and the infrastructure evaluation carriage designed for general infrastructure evaluation. Most of these trains are repurposed locomotives previously used by V/Line, Metro Trains Melbourne, and Southern Shorthaul Railroad.

==== Planned rolling stock ====
Upon the opening of the Metro Tunnel in 2025, the Sunbury line will primarily use a fleet of High Capacity Metro Train (HCMT) electric multiple unit trains, operating in a seven-car configuration. The trains feature three doors per side on each carriage and can accommodate up to 1,380 passengers. HCMTs were introduced to the Sunbury line in 2023, operating two peak services from Sunbury to Flinders Street each morning. HCMTs are also planned to be used on the Airport line, which will branch off from the Sunbury line at Sunshine. HCMTs are built in Changchun, China, with final assembly occurring in Newport, Melbourne, by Evolution Rail, a consortium composed of CRRC Changchun Railway Vehicles, Downer Rail and Plenary Group. As of October 2023, two HCMT services run per day on the Sunbury Line, with more to be gradually introduced in the coming years.

=== Accessibility ===

In compliance with the Disability Discrimination Act of 1992, all stations that were newly built or rebuilt since the Act took effect comply with its guidelines. Most stations on the Sunbury line are fully accessible, however, there are some stations that have not been upgraded to meet these guidelines. Stations that are fully accessible feature ramps that have a gradient less than 1 in 14, have at-grade paths, or feature elevators. Accessible stations typically also feature tactile boarding indicators, independent boarding ramps, wheelchair accessible myki barriers, hearing loops, and widened paths.

Several stations on the Sunbury line have been rebuilt or upgraded with better accessibility features, mostly as part of the Level Crossing Removal Project and the Sunbury Line Upgrade. This includes St Albans and Ginifer stations, which were rebuilt as part of the Level Crossing Removal Project; and Sunbury, Diggers Rest, Watergardens, Keilor Plains, Albion, Sunshine, and Footscray stations which had raised boarding pads installed to improve wheelchair accessibility as part of the Sunbury Line Upgrade.

=== Signalling ===
The Sunbury line uses three-position signalling which is widely used across the Melbourne train network. Three-position signalling was first introduced in 1929, with the final section of the line converted in 2005. The Sunbury line&#x27;s signalling system was further upgraded as part of the Sunbury Line Upgrade to enable the use of &quot;high capacity signalling&quot; (a form of communications-based train control) to be used within the Metro Tunnel.

<text>Elfriede &quot;Elfi&quot; von Dassanowsky (February 2, 1924October 2, 2007) was an Austrian-born singer, pianist, and film producer.

== Early life ==
Elfi von Dassanowsky (also known as Elfi Dassanowsky or Elfriede Dassanowsky) was born Elfriede Maria Elisabeth Charlotte Dassanowsky in Vienna, the daughter of Franz Leopold von Dassanowsky, a civil servant in the Austrian Trade Ministry, and Anna (née Grünwald). A piano prodigy at the age of 5, Elfi attended the Vienna Institute of the Blessed Virgin Mary (known as the &quot;Englische Fräuleins&quot;) and became at age 15, the youngest woman admitted to Vienna&#x27;s Academy of Music and Performing Arts to that date as the protégé of concert pianist, Emil von Sauer. While a student, film director Karl Hartl chose her to instruct Curd Jürgens in piano, so that he could play the instrument on screen in Hartl&#x27;s Mozart biopic and a Willi Forst musical (it served him well beyond the era, to the 1971 Hollywood film &quot;The Mephisto Waltz&quot;). But Dassanowsky&#x27;s studies and early career were halted for extended labor service when she rejected membership in Nazi organizations. The powerful UFA Studio in Berlin offered her a film contract in late 1944, which she also declined.

== Career ==
In 1946, von Dassanowsky made her opera debut as Susanna in Mozart&#x27;s &quot;The Marriage of Figaro&quot; at the Stadttheater St. Pölten and created in concerts for the Allied High Command.

Dassanowsky remains one of the few women in film history, and at age 22 one of the youngest, to co-found a film studio—Belvedere Film—the first new studio facility in postwar Vienna. With senior partners August Diglas and Emmerich Hanus, the studio created such German-language classics as &quot;Die Glücksmühle&quot; (The Mill of Happiness, 1946), &quot;Dr. Rosin&quot; (1949), and &quot;Märchen vom Glück&quot; (&quot;Kiss Me, Casanova&quot;, 1949), and gave Gunther Philipp and Nadja Tiller their first screen roles.

Dassanowsky starred in operas, operettas, theatrical dramas and comedies, helped initiate several theater groups, was announcer for Allied Forces Broadcasting and the BBC, toured West Germany in a one-woman-show and gave master classes in voice and piano.

During this period, Dassanowsky also modeled exclusively for famous Austrian painter Franz Xaver Wolf (1896 – 1990), whose work featuring her image is now in museum and private collections.

Through art director Federico Pallavicini Dassanowsky encouraged an issue of the short-lived American magazine, &quot;Flair&quot; (edited by Fleur Cowles) to cover the arts in postwar Vienna, and modeled for the planned edition, but the publication folded before print. An expert in the Ignace Paderewski piano technique, her musical pedagogy continued in the 1950s in Canada and New York, where she also married and had a son and daughter.

At this time Dassanowsky turned to design and created a prototype for woman&#x27;s leather day coat, which is now in the collection of The Museum of Applied Arts in Vienna (Museum für angewandte Kunst Wien). She divorced in the late 1970s and although she never remarried, she was briefly linked with author and actor, Prince Heinrich Starhemberg (aka Henry Gregor, 1934–1997) in the mid 1990s until his death.

In Hollywood in the 1960s, she resisted becoming a trendy Euro-starlet and preferred to remain behind the camera as a vocal coach for director/producer Otto Preminger. In 1962, she became a naturalized citizen of the United States. A successful Los Angeles businesswoman, in 1999, she re-established Belvedere Film as a Los Angeles/Vienna-based production company with her son, Robert. She was executive producer of the award-winning dramatic short film, &quot;Semmelweis&quot; (2001), the spy-comedy, &quot;Wilson Chance&quot; (2005), and several works in progress at the time of her death, including the documentary &quot;Felix Austria!&quot; aka &quot;The Archduke and Herbert Hinkel&quot; (2013), and a screen adaptation (with her son) of the antiwar Austrian novel, &quot;Mars im Widder&quot; by Alexander Lernet-Holenia.

Recognized internationally for her unique work as a pioneering woman in film production and as a multi-talent in postwar Austrian arts and culture, von Dassanowsky is the only Austrian woman to receive the Women&#x27;s International Center&#x27;s prestigious Living Legacy Award, and has been honored with the UNESCO Mozart Medal, the &quot;Decoration of Merit in Gold&quot; for Services to the Republic of Austria, the French Ordre des Arts et des Lettres, the Austrian Film Archive&#x27;s Lifetime Achievement Medal, by the State of California and the cities of Vienna and Los Angeles, where von Dassanowsky lived since 1962. Additionally, she is reported to have been nominated for the honorary Right Livelihood Award in the late 1990s.
== Death ==
While in Kona, Hawaii, in July 2007, Dassanowsky suffered a life-threatening embolism. She was flown to Queens Hospital in Honolulu and part of her left leg had to be amputated. She was reported to be recovering well in rehabilitation in Los Angeles and was expected to continue her efforts in film production as well as arts and UNESCO promotion. According to news reports, amputee celebrity Heather Mills (Lady McCartney) took a personal interest in her rehabilitation. However, Dassanowsky died October 2, 2007, in Los Angeles of heart failure. She was interred in a &quot;grave of honor&quot; () at the Zentralfriedhof in Vienna on July 25, 2008.

== Foundation and posthumous recognition ==
In November 2007, the planned establishment of the &quot;Elfi von Dassanowsky Foundation&quot; was announced in Vienna. It would continue the pioneering and creative spirit of the late artist by developing awards and grants for emerging women filmmakers.
The first phase of this project was complete in late January 2009, when the &quot;Elfi von Dassanowsky Fund&quot; initiated its program of charitable contributions to non-profit organizations in the U.S. and Europe.

The Elfi von Dassanowsky Rose (a tea-rose – floribunda hybrid) also known as the &quot;Elfi&quot; was created by Brad Jalbert of Canada in 2009. It was included in the Peggy Rockefeller Rose Garden at the New York Botanical Garden in Spring 2013.

The first &quot;Elfi von Dassanowsky Prize&quot; for work by female filmmakers was presented to Norwegian artist Inger Lise Hansen for &quot;Parallax&quot; (2009) at the Vienna Independent Shorts Film Festival in June 2010.

A minor planet/asteroid, 4495 Dassanowsky, discovered in 1988 by Japanese astronomers Masaru Arai and Hiroshi Mori, was named in her honor in 2014.

She was named an Honorary Member of the Association of Austrian Film Producers (AAFP) posthumously in September 2018.

<text>The Reichsbank (; ) was the central bank of the German Empire from 1876 until the end of Nazi Germany in 1945.

==Background==

The monetary institutions in Germany had been unsuited for its economic development for several decades before unification. In the Kingdom of Prussia, the Bank of Prussia had been established in 1847 and, in the aftermath of the revolution of 1848, five additional banks had been granted a note-issuance privilege (the , , , at Stettin, and ), but that was still insufficient to sustain adequate monetary conditions. By 1851, 9 banks in the whole of Germany (not including Austria) were chartered to issue banknotes, known as . In addition, most German states - with the only exceptions of Lippe and the Hanseatic cities of Bremen, Hamburg and Lübeck - issued government paper money without the intermediation of an issuing bank.

Several pan-German conventions were held with the aim to simplify and rationalize the German monetary system, e.g. in Vienna on , but to no avail. Instead, the number of kept growing, reaching 31 (in the territories that would become the German Reich) in 1870. They were typically private-sector entities, albeit often under hands-on government oversight, except the Bank of Bremen and Frankfurter Bank which were comparatively independent. Twelve of these were in Prussia, four in the Kingdom of Saxony, one in the Kingdom of Bavaria, and the other 14 in various duchies, principalities and free cities.

On , a law was passed that forbade the formation of further in the North German Confederation. Following the promulgation of the German Empire that law was extended to all German lands, with entry into force on . These Prussian initiatives precipitated action by the Grand Duchy of Baden and Kingdom of Württemberg to create note-issuing banks of their own, respectively the Badische Bank in Mannheim (est. 1870) and the Württembergische Notenbank in Stuttgart (est. 1871), bringing the total number of to 33. The panic of 1873 further stimulated discussions on the creation of an integrated monetary system, which pitted advocates of centralization led by Ludwig Bamberger against the incumbent local banks of issue and defenders of state rights, led by Ludolf Camphausen. The political compromise was to allow the latter to keep issuance activity but under such restrictions that they rapidly fell into monetary irrelevance.

==German Empire==
The Reichsbank was established by legislation of the Reichstag of , and assumed its new role on when it succeeded the Bank of Prussia. Meanwhile, between 1873 and 1875 the Bank of Prussia assumed all the assets and liabilities of the Hamburger Bank, which was a major monetary anchor in Northern Germany.

The Reichsbank was technically a private-sector company with individual shareholders, albeit not in joint-stock form, and operated from the start under the close control of the Reich government. The bank was managed by a management board () reporting to a supervisory board (). The Curatorium was chaired by the Imperial Chancellor and included four additional members, one appointed by the emperor and the other three by the Bundesrat; it was to meet every three months. The Direktorium was led by the President () and all its members were appointed for life by the emperor, upon nomination by the Bundesrat. The law specified that the Direktorium must obey the Chancellor&#x27;s orders at all times. The shareholders were represented in a central committee () of 15 members, which met at least every month under the chairmanship of the Reichsbank&#x27;s president and could scrutinize the management but not change it or influence policy decision. Three deputies of the were allowed to attend all meetings of the Direktorium and to examine the books of the Reichsbank. The initial shareholders included the former shareholders of the Bank of Prussia (except a few who opted for selling their shares) and new subscribers. The bank was exempted from all income and trade taxes, but also had to act as the Reich&#x27;s fiscal agent without compensation.

The Reichsbank operated throughout the Reich&#x27;s territory through a network of branches, which numbered 206 at its inception in 1876 and expanded to 330 by 1900. A formal distinction was made between main branches (), whose head was appointed directly by the emperor, and other branches (), but that difference of status was insubstantial in practice. The bank&#x27;s employees had the status of civil servants of the Reich, even though they were paid by the Reichsbank. The Reichsbank also sponsored the establishment of clearing houses which were established in the 1880s and 1890s in Berlin, Frankfurt, Stuttgart, Cologne, Leipzig (Petersstrasse), Dresden, Hamburg, Breslau, Bremen, and Elberfeld.

15 of the 32 (other than the Bank of Prussia) relinquished issuing their own banknotes shortly after the Reichsbank&#x27;s creation; four more did so in the 1880s, six in the 1890s, and three in the early 1900s, leaving only the Bayerische Notenbank, Bank of Baden, Bank of Saxony and Württembergische Notenbank as residual note-issuing institutions by 1906.

Until World War I, the Reichsbank produced a very stable currency, fully convertible into gold and thus known as the German gold mark. In 1909, an amendment to the Banking Act of 1875 made the Rischsbank&#x27;s notes legal tender and redeemable at the rate of 2790 Marks per kilogram of gold. In the period immediately before the war erupted, the Reichsbank greatly increased its gold reserves, as also did the Bank of France, Bank of Russia and Austro-Hungarian Bank, from an equivalent US$184 million on to $336 million on . At the outbreak of World War I, however, the link between the mark and gold was abandoned, resulting in the Papiermark. The expenses of the war caused inflationary pressure and the mark started to decrease in value..

==Weimar Republic==

Following Germany&#x27;s defeat and the 1919 Treaty of Versailles, the German government was unable to meet its expenditures and commitments by taxation and borrowing from external sources, and instead turned to the Reichsbank for monetary financing. Combined with its reaction to the occupation of the Ruhr by France and Belgium, this triggered a dramatic episode of hyperinflation that rendered the Mark practically worthless. The Reichsbank only started raising its discount rate in July 1922, reaching 40 percent per day at the hyperinflationary peak in November 1923. By decree of on the initiative of finance minister Hans Luther, the government created a separate bank, the Deutsche Rentenbank, endowed with the right to issue notes () redeemable in a kind of non-interest-bearing mortgage bond, the , denominated in gold Mark and theoretically backed by a collective mortgage debt imposed upon German agriculture and industry. That confidence-building initiative succeeded against all expectations, even though the only had the status of &quot;legally-admitted medium of exchange&quot; while the Reichsbank&#x27;s devalued paper notes remained legal tender. No fixed exchange rate was set by law, but the &quot;Rentenmark&quot; became interchangeable with paper Mark at the rate of one to one trillion. The Rentenmark was thus in effect a transitory domestic currency, which was never convertible internationally.

The success of the Rentenmark, followed by the Dawes Plan on war reparations, paved the way for a restoration of monetary order. The Banking Law of was inspired by the stabilization loans orchestrated by the Economic and Financial Organization of the League of Nations that had entailed the creation of the Oesterreichische Nationalbank in January 1923 and of the Hungarian National Bank in June 1924. It comprehensively reformed the Reichsbank and made it, for the first time, an explicitly independent central bank. Its &quot;Kuratorium&quot; was replaced by a General Council () consisting of 7 German and 7 foreign members, which was to elect the bank&#x27;s president subject to approval of the President of Germany. The General Council also elected one of its foreign members to serve as Currency Commissioner () supervising note issuance. The ability of the reformed Reichsbank to extend credit to the Reich government was strictly limited. The new currency, the Reichsmark (RM), was set at one trillion paper Mark, restoring the prewar parity of 2790 RM for one kilogram of fine gold; the pre-reform notes ceased to be legal tender on .

In the subsequent period of deflation, the Reichsbank became practically the only source of short-term banking credit in the German economy, which it chose to ration (maintaining a discount rate of no more than 10 percent) rather than lending to high market-determined rates. The Reichsbank&#x27;s credit rationing only ended in early 1926, after which the discount rate could be gradually lowered, reaching 56 percent in January 1927. In 1930, legislative amendments in line with the Young Plan brought an end to the involvement of foreigners in the Reichsbank&#x27;s governance. The General Council was reduced to 10 members, all German, and the role of Currency Commissioner went to the President of the .

==Nazi period==
The Nazi regime promptly put an end to the independence of the Reichsbank and made it an instrument of their policy of directing Germany&#x27;s resources towards rearmament and military expansion. By amendment of to the Banking Law, the General Council was abolished and the Direktorium, including the President, were henceforth to be directly appointed and dismissed by the Führer. On , Hitler publicly proclaimed the unlimited sovereignty of the Reich over the Reichsbank, and a law of formally abolished the Reichsbank&#x27;s autonomous status. Another law of stipulated that the President and Direktorium should directly receive their instructions from the Führer, and renamed the bank as . During most of the Nazi period the same individual was President of the Reichsbank and Minister of the Economy, namely Hjalmar Schacht from August 1934 to November 1937 and Walther Funk from January 1939 to May 1945.

On , the Reichsbank&#x27;s note issuing privilege became exclusive, bringing an end to the residual central banking roles of the Bank of Baden, Bayerische Notenbank, Bank of Saxony, and Württembergische Notenbank.

The Reichsbank benefited from the theft of the property of numerous governments invaded by the Germans, especially their gold reserves and much personal property of the Third Reich&#x27;s many victims, especially the Jews. Personal possessions such as gold wedding rings were confiscated from prisoners, and gold teeth torn from dead bodies, and after cleaning, were deposited in the bank under the false-name Max Heiliger accounts, and melted down as bullion.

In April and May 1945, the remaining reserves of the Reichsbank – gold (730 bars), cash (6 large sacks), and precious stones and metals such as platinum (25 sealed boxes) – were dispatched by Walther Funk to be buried on the Klausenhof Mountain at Einsiedl in Bavaria, where the final German resistance was to be concentrated. Similarly, the Abwehr cash reserves were hidden nearby in Garmisch-Partenkirchen. Shortly after the American forces overran the area, the reserves and money disappeared. Funk would be tried and convicted of war crimes at the Nuremberg trials, not least for receiving money and goods stolen from Jewish and other victims of the Nazi concentration camps. Gold teeth extracted from the mouths of victims were found in 1945 in the vaults of the bank in Berlin. The explanation of the disappearance of the Reichsbank reserves in 1945 was uncovered by Bill Stanley Moss and Andrew Kennedy, in post-war Germany.

==Aftermath and liquidation==

In line with decisions made at the Potsdam Conference, the Reichsbank was placed under joint Allied custodianship pending its liquidation. The four occupying powers (France, the Soviet Union, the United Kingdom and the United States) initially continued to issue Reichsmarks and Allied military marks. In Austria, the Oesterreichische Nationalbank was re-established by the Central Bank Transition Act of of the Second Austrian Republic.

In line with the Morgenthau Plan, the American authorities in November 1945 proposed a radically decentralized plan that would have organized a separate financial system in each of the , with minimal central coordination. After some hesitancy, the French authorities rallied that vision; the British authorities were initially reluctant, but gradually aligned with U.S. views following the establishment of the Bizone on . Thus, Land central banks () were created on in American-occupied Munich (for Bavaria), Stuttgart (for Württemberg-Baden), and Wiesbaden (for Hesse), followed in March by French-occupied Tübingen (for Württemberg-Hohenzollern), Freiburg im Breisgau (for South Baden, and Mainz (for Rhineland-Palatinate), then American-occupied Bremen on , and eventually British-occupied Düsseldorf (for North Rhine-Westphalia), Hanover (for Lower Saxony), Kiel (for Schleswig-Holstein) and Hamburg by the Spring of 1948.

In the Soviet occupation zone, ostensibly similar entities dubbed were established in May 1947 in each of the zone&#x27;s five Provinces, namely in Potsdam for Brandenburg, Rostock for Mecklenburg, Dresden for Saxony, Halle for Saxony-Anhalt, and Erfurt for Thuringia. Each of these was fully owned and controlled by the respective provincial authorities.

In 1947, newly appointed U.S. Military Governor Lucius D. Clay decided, against directives from Washington, that Germany needed a central bank instead of a mere board bringing together the for joint policy decisions. An agreement on that concept was reached among the three Western occupying forces on , resulting in the establishment on of the Bank deutscher Länder. On , the Soviet occupation authorities replied by establishing a in Potsdam, which was renamed in July, later relocated to East Berlin, and in 1968 was rebranded the Staatsbank der DDR.

Given Berlin&#x27;s special situation, no was initially established there. Plans for a separate currency for all of Berlin were considered up until June 1948, when the situation came to a head and the introduction of Western German marks into West Berlin precipitated the Berlin Blockade. Only after the blockade ended was the established on , and initially operated under an association agreement with the Bank deutscher Länder. It was eventually converted into a in 1957.

The Reichsbank itself went into a protracted process of liquidation. In 1955, a Federal German Law allowed holders of Reichsbank common stock to exchange it for interim certificates of the Bank Deutscher Länder.
==Head office==

The Bank of Prussia had commissioned a new head office in the late 1860s, which replaced its previous building dating from the late 17th century. The structure designed by architect Friedrich Hitzig was completed in 1876 as the Reichsbank started activity. In 1892-1894, the Reichsbank erected a palatial southward extension on an adjacent lot facing Hausvogteiplatz, designed by its architects and . In the early 1930s, the Reichsbank erected a large new facility on the other side of Kurstrasse, designed by its architect . While the main building was heavily damaged during World War II and eventually demolished in 1960, the 1930s extension survives as the Haus am Werderschen Markt, hosting the German Federal Foreign Office after having been the home of the Socialist Unity Party of Germany in the 1960s, 1970s and 1980s.

==Branches==

In Prussia, the Reichsbank kept the branches it inherited from the Bank of Prussia, including buildings it had purchased from others (e.g. the palace erected by in Königsberg, acquired in 1843) and those it had built for itself (e.g. in Bromberg in 1864). Elsewhere, it did not take over the properties of banks whose monetary role it replaced, and erected new branch buildings instead. By the end of the 19th century, it had newly built branches in most of Germany&#x27;s significant cities. In some cases, these branches were replaced by more modern ones in the interwar period.

The Reichsbank employed a number of specialized architects for branch design, including the prolific and from the 1880s to the early 1900s, in the 1890s and early 1900s, Curjel and Moser in the 1900s, and Hermann Stiller in the 1900s and 1910s, in the 1910s and 1920s, and in the 1920s and 1930s.

Due to Germany&#x27;s territorial losses following World War I, the former Reichsbank branches in what became the Second Polish Republic were taken over by Bank Polski, and the one in the Free City of Danzig became the Bank of Danzig. During World War II, a number of branches were destroyed and not subsequently rebuilt. The one in Munich, whose construction had started in 1938 on the site of the former Herzog-Max-Palais demolished that year, was only completed in 1951. Following the disappearance of the Reichsbank in 1945, a number of its former branches were taken over by its successor entities, namely the Deutsche Bundesbank in West Germany, the Staatsbank der DDR in East Germany, and the National Bank of Poland in Poland; some in East Germany were demolished later on, such as the Chemnitz branch in 1964. Many other branches have been repurposed for other uses over the years, such as the Bucerius Kunst Forum in Hamburg or the in Magdeburg.

<text>Frank Ignace Georgette Vandenbroucke (; born 21 October 1955) is a Belgian-Flemish academic and politician of Vooruit who has been serving as Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of Health and Social Affairs in both the De Croo government as well as the De Wever government since 2020.

==Early life and education==
Vandenbroucke was born in Leuven. His father, Jozue Vandenbroucke (1914–1987), was vice-rector of the Katholieke Universiteit Leuven (medicine).

Vandenbroucke attended Sint-Pieterscollege in Leuven for his secondary education. He started his academic studies at the Katholieke Universiteit Leuven. Starting with an undergraduate degree in Economics, he continued and got a master&#x27;s degree in economics from the same alma mater in 1978. After this he got a MPhil in Economics from Cambridge University (1981–82).

==Career in academia==
After graduating from the KUL, Vandenbroucke became a research assistant at the &quot;Centrum voor Economische Studiën&quot; at the KUL (1978–80). In 1982 he became a staff member of SEVI, the research department of the SP (1982–85).

In 1999 Vandenbroucke received a D.Phil. from the Faculty of Social Studies, Oxford University. His thesis &quot;Social Justice and Individual Ethics in an Open Society: Equality, Responsibility, and Incentives&quot; (Ethical Economy) was published in March 2001 by Springer publications. 

Since 2009 Vandenbroucke took on academic positions at the University of Antwerp (professor of Social Economic Analysis, Herman Deleeck Centre for Social Policy), the &quot;Katholieke Universiteit Leuven&quot; (KUL), and the University of Amsterdam (professor at the Den Uyl Chair at the Faculty of Social and Behavioural Sciences). He is guest professor at the College of Europe in Bruges.

Vandenbroucke&#x27;s academic interests focus on social systems and welfare policies. At EU level, he was active in outlining the Open Method of Coordination among Member States to support the enactment of the 2000 Lisbon Strategy. He later worked for the introduction of a &#x27;horizontal social clause&#x27; in the Lisbon Treaty (today&#x27;s art. 9 TFEU) to provide a stronger legal basis for welfare policies in the EU.

==Political career==
In 1985 Vandenbroucke was elected to the Belgian Chamber of People&#x27;s Representatives and was re-elected in 1987, 1991 and 1995. In 1989 the 34-year-old Vandenbroucke became chairman of the SP, a post he held until 1994, when he became Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of Foreign Affairs (1994–95). From 1995 to 1996 Vandenbroucke was the leader of the Parliamentary Group of the SP.

In 1995 Vandenbroucke had to resign as foreign minister and in 1996 he also resigned from parliament due to his involvement in the Agusta scandal. He acknowledged that he was confronted with two million francs which came as bribery money from the Italian helicopter builder Agusta. Refusing to have anything to do with the money, he advised to &quot;have the money burned&quot;. Vandenbroucke was never prosecuted but took a voluntary sabbatical at Oxford (1996–99).

After the 1999 Belgian general election Vandenbroucke returned to politics to become Minister of Social Affairs and Pensions (1999–2003). After the 2003 elections he became Minister for Employment and Pensions (2003–04).

After the 2004 regional elections, Vandenbroucke left the federal government for the Flemish Government to become Vice-Minister-President of the Flemish Government and Flemish Minister for Work, Education and Training (2004–09). The 2009 regional elections was a sudden and unexpected turning point in his career. Although Vandenbroucke gained a large number of preference votes in his home province of Flemish Brabant, the president of his party, Caroline Gennez, chose not to give him the opportunity to continue his work as Minister, mentioning political as well as characterial dissimilarities. Instead, he was succeeded by Pascal Smet for Education and by Philippe Muyters for Work. At that time, Vandenbroucke remained member of the Flemish Parliament and accepted a teaching position at the University of Antwerp.

In 2010, Vandenbroucke participated in the general elections, running for the Belgian Senate. During the campaign, Vandenbroucke outed his concerns about the social-institutional reforms that the pre-electorally dominating Flemish nationalist party New Flemish Alliance wanted to achieve. Although his party maintained its position with the outcome of the elections, Vandenbroucke gained a relatively large number of preference votes.

He has been member of the Flemish Parliament (2009) and of the Belgian Senate (2010), and was awarded by King Albert II of Belgium of the title of Minister of State (2009). In October 2011 he left all political posts to focus on academic research.

In April 2013 he became a member and president of Belgium&#x27;s &quot;Commission de réforme des pensions 2020–40&quot; at the request of the federal ministers responsible for pensions, Alexander De Croo and Sabine Laruelle. Composed of twelve experts, this commission was tasked to prepare, independently and in a closed circle, future pension reforms, in order to further improve the social and financial sustainability of the Belgian pension system.

After being ten years out of politics on 1 October 2020 on behalf of Conner Rousseau, Vandenbroucke joined the De Croo Government as Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of Health and Social Affairs. He was unelected, as he did not appear on any voting lists.

<text>M-50 is a state trunkline highway in the US state of Michigan. Although designated as an east–west highway, it is nearly a diagonal northwest–southeast route. The western terminus is at exit 52 along Interstate 96 (I-96) near Alto a few miles east of the metro Grand Rapids area, and its eastern terminus is in downtown Monroe at US Highway 24 (US 24, Telegraph Road). In between the trunkline runs through seven counties of the southern part of the Lower Peninsula mostly through rural farm fields and small communities. The highway also runs through downtown Jackson to connect between two freeway sections of US 127. In the Irish Hills area of the state southeast of Jackson, M-50 runs next to Michigan International Speedway.

Dating back to the early days of the state highway system, M-50 was first signed in the southeastern corner of the state in 1919. During the 1920s, the highway was extended to the Grand Rapids area and beyond to Lake Michigan, making it a trans-peninsular route connecting that Great Lake with Lake Erie. A rerouting of highways including M-50 through Grand Rapids in the 1950s created Business M-50 (Bus. M-50), a business loop through that city that lasted for eight years. Additional changes made during the 1960s rerouted M-50 to replace its business loop until the highway was shortened to its present western terminus south of Lowell. A pair of truncations in Monroe in 1996 and 2006 are responsible for the present-day eastern terminus.

==Route description==

===Lowell to Jackson===
M-50 begins at an interchange with I-96 at exit 52 south of Lowell in southeastern Kent County. The highway proceeds south along with Alden Nash Avenue and turns east on 92nd Street through farms and fields in the rural southeastern corner of the county. As the trunkline runs to the east, it crosses into Ionia County. M-50 follows Thompson Road, Nash Highway and Tupper Lake Road into Lake Odessa. In Lake Odessa, the road bends around the north side of Jordan Lake, curving to the south into the extreme northeastern Barry County. The highway turns back to the east as it heads towards a junction with M-66 and M-43 at the Barry–Eaton county line.

After meeting M-43, the two trunklines run concurrently for about a mile (1.6 km) before M-50 breaks off to the southwest near Woodbury. From there, the road continues in its southeasterly path along Clinton Trail through the northeast part of Eaton County as it runs through fields to Charlotte. Just prior to entering the city, the road bends to the south and near the middle of town it has a junction with M-79 and Business Loop I-69 (BL I-69). After this intersection, M-50 continues south concurrent with the business loop for several blocks before turning eastward. On the eastern end of town, it has an interchange with I-69 at exit 60.

After heading east past the junction with I-69, the highway turns southeast as it heads through rural fields toward Eaton Rapids. Once it reaches the city, M-50 converges with M-99, and the two intersect M-188 on the south side of the Grand River. The two highways run south out of the city. Immediately prior to entering Jackson County, the two trunklines diverge with M-99 heading off to the southwest and M-50 to the southeast.

M-50 continues its journey through Jackson County, winding its way to the southeast through rural fields and small forests. The landscape transitions to residential neighborhoods as the road approaches the US 127 freeway north of Jackson. In Blackman Township, M-50 merges with US 127 to run concurrently into the north side of Jackson. After an interchange with I-94 at exit 138, US 127 exits to run east on I-94 for , M-50 and Business US 127 (Bus. US 127) run concurrently into the city as West Avenue passing by the Jackson Crossing shopping mall. The road then proceeds south through the northern side of the city before turning east on Michigan Avenue as it heads towards downtown.

===Jackson to Monroe===
In downtown Jackson, Michigan Avenue continues into downtown while M-50 is routed around the city center along paired one-way streets. Washington Street carries eastbound traffic and the Louis Glick Highway. On the east side of downtown, the roads merge near the Jackson Amtrak station and a junction with M-106 on Cooper Street, where M-50 turns south and then southeast as Brooklyn Road. On the south side of Jackson, M-50 and US 127 meet up once again just east of Vandercook Lake. M-50 follows the US 127 freeway through a pair of conjoined partial interchanges before M-50 heads east away from Vandercook Lake.

The trunkline then heads southeast to Napoleon, where the road then turns south and heads towards Brooklyn, part of the Irish Hills area of Lenawee County, a region known for its scenery. The road serves as main street for downtown Brooklyn as well as the primary thoroughfare for drivers headed to Michigan International Speedway. M-50 curves around the north and east side of the race track before intersecting US 12 in Cambridge Junction. After crossing US 12, the road passes between several lakes of the Irish Hills area including Washington, Little Stony and Marrs lakes before continuing on its southeasterly journey towards Tecumseh.

After leaving the Brooklyn area, the road returns to a rural environment as it cuts through agricultural fields. Before passing through Tipton, M-50 passes the entrance to Hidden Lake Gardens, a botanical garden and arboretum operated by Michigan State University. After passing Hidden Lake, the road intersects M-52 and continues into Tecumseh. Known as Chicago Boulevard, the road serves as the main route through the city. After leaving Tecumseh, the highway passes through the communities of Ridgeway and Britton before leaving Lenawee County.
M-50 begins the final leg of its journey, as it crosses into Monroe county, passing through land that is mostly fields. Prior to reaching its interchange with US 23, the highway passes to the south of Cabela&#x27;s, a outdoor sports retailer in Dundee. After leaving town, the trunkline continues to the southeast, running to the south of the River Raisin, through rural areas as South Custer Road before entering the outskirts of Monroe where it finally ends its journey at a junction with US 24 (Telegraph Road) a few miles inland from Lake Erie.

M-50 is maintained by the Michigan Department of Transportation (MDOT) like other state highways in Michigan. As a part of these maintenance responsibilities, the department tracks the volume of traffic that uses the roadways under its jurisdiction. These volumes are expressed using a metric called annual average daily traffic, which is a statistical calculation of the average daily number of vehicles on a segment of roadway. MDOT&#x27;s surveys in 2011 showed that the highest traffic levels along M-50 were the 25,770 vehicles daily south of the Springport Road interchange in the Jackson area; the lowest counts were the 2,055 vehicles per day south of the M-99 concurrency. The only sections of M-50 that have been listed on the National Highway System (NHS) are the two US 127 concurrencies in the Jackson area and the connection between them through downtown. The NHS is a network of roads important to the country&#x27;s economy, defense, and mobility.

==History==
When the state highway system was first signed in 1919, M-50 started at an intersection with M-23 (present-day US 12) in Cambridge Junction, south of Brooklyn. From there it ran to the southeast, similar to its present-day routing, through Dundee and Tecumseh into downtown Monroe where it intersected M-56. There was a concurrency between M-50 and M-65 between Dundee and the Ida area which became an overlap with US 23 after 1926. By the end of 1927, M-50 underwent a major lengthening as its western terminus was extended through Jackson to Eaton Rapids, Charlotte, and Vermontville before intersecting M-39 just east of Woodbury. From this point, M-50 was routed over M-39 to US 16 near Alto. M-50 then ran concurrently with US 16 into Grand Rapids where it turned to the west and traveled through Allendale before terminating at a junction with US 31 in Agnew. A few years later in 1929, the route between Charlotte and Woodbury was changed as M-50 was routed north out of Charlotte to the former M-39 and replaced it east to Woodbury; the former routing was turned over to local control.

In 1953, the route was realigned onto the south and west beltline to bypass Grand Rapids; the old routing through downtown became Business M-50 (Bus. M-50). In the late 1950s, when the US 127 freeway bypass east of Jackson opened up, the old routing through town became Bus. US 127/M-50. At the same time, the concurrency with US 23 between Dundee and the Ida area was dropped after the new US 23 freeway opened; the old route becomes solely designated M-50.

In 1961, when the I-96/US 16/M-50 freeway was extended to the northwest in Grand Rapids, the old M-50 routing around the city became M-11 and M-50 was returned to its former alignment along Lake Michigan Drive and Fulton Street, supplanting Bus. M-50. In 1964, the western end of M-50 was truncated from its junction with US 31 back to I-96 south of Lowell at exit 52. The former alignment from exit 40 to Agnew was given the M-45 designation.

In 1996, the highway was truncated as the terminus was scaled back to M-125 in Monroe. Finally on October 4, 2006, the section of M-50 between M-125 and US 24 was also removed, shortening the highway by about a mile (1.9 km).

==Major intersections==









==Business route==
Business M-50 (Bus. M-50) was a business loop that ran through Grand Rapids. The state trunkline highway was created when M-50 was rerouted to follow 28th Street and Wilson Avenue around the south and west sides of the city in 1953. The business loop was decommissioned when M-50 was returned to its former routing in 1961. The highway followed Lake Michigan Drive (now M-45) from the Standale neighborhood of Walker easterly to Fulton Street in Grand Rapids. From there it followed Fulton easterly through downtown Grand Rapids and the east side of the city to a junction with Cascade Road in Grand Rapids Township The last segment followed Cascade Road to the I-96/M-50 freeway where it connected with its parent highway and terminated.

<text>Joseph Petzval (6 January 1807 – 17 September 1891) was a mathematician, inventor, and physicist best known for his work in optics. He was born in the town of Szepesbéla in the Kingdom of Hungary (in German: Zipser Bela, now Spišská Belá in Slovakia).

Petzval studied and later lectured at the Institutum Geometricum (currently Budapest University of Technology and Economics) in Buda (today part of Budapest). He headed the Institute of Practical Geometry and Hydrology/Architecture between 1841 and 1848. Later in life, he accepted an appointment to a chair of mathematics at the University of Vienna. Petzval became a member of the Hungarian Academy of Sciences in 1873.

Petzval is considered to be one of the main founders of geometrical optics, modern photography and cinematography. Among his inventions are the Petzval portrait lens and opera glasses, both still in common use today. He is also credited with the discovery of the Laplace transform and is also known for his extensive work on aberration in optical systems.

== Early life ==
In 1801, Joseph Petzval&#x27;s father married the Zipser-German Susanne Kreutzmann, who was born in Szepesbéla, Kingdom of Hungary, a daughter of the previous teacher at the same school in Szepesbéla. The couple brought up six children: Gustáv Adolf (1800–1803), who died prematurely; Nestor Aemilianus (1804–1806); Joseph Maximilián (1807 - 1891); Petrol Baltazár (1809–1889); and three daughters. In 1810, the family moved to Késmárk (in German: Käsmark, today Kežmarok, Slovakia) and in 1819 to Lőcse (in German: Leutschau, today Levoča, Slovakia).

The entire family shared an aptitude for technology. Joseph&#x27;s father worked as a teacher at the evangelical school in Szepesbéla, as well as an organist in Szepesbéla and later in Késmárk. He was also a conductor and a geodesist in Lőcse. He had a reputation as an outstanding musician and composer, who was also gifted mechanically. In 1824, he was awarded two patents: one for improvements to the pendulum clock and the other for a &quot;polygraph&quot; (typewriter). Petzval&#x27;s brother, Petrol Baltazár Petzval, was a well-respected mathematician, engineer and astronomer.

=== Education ===

Joseph Petzval attended elementary school in Késmárk, and began his secondary school studies in Késmárk and Podolin (in German: Pudlein, now Podolínec, Slovakia). On 1 October 1819 he returned to his family in Lőcse, and entered high school. Both in elementary school and high school he ranked among the best in his class in the subjects of Latin (the official language of the Kingdom of Hungary) and religion; however, he struggled with his Hungarian. Before arriving at Lőcse, he was also very weak in mathematics. In Lőcse, however, he clearly improved in this discipline.

One anecdote told about Petzval is as follows: When his family had already decided to make a shoemaker out of Petzval, he read the book &quot;Analytic Paper on the Elements of Mathematics&quot; by the German mathematician Hauser over the summer holidays, just after completing his fourth class in elementary school. He was preparing to undergo a repeat class in mathematics. After Petzval finished the book, the child who had been a weak math pupil swiftly became a math genius.

After finishing high school, Petzval decided to move to the Institutum Geometricum, the engineering faculty of the Pester University. Before that, he had to complete a two-year lyceum, which he attended from 1823 to 1825 in Kassa (in German: Kaschau, today Košice, Slovakia). When he arrived there in 1823, Petzval was already well-versed in the subjects of Latin, mathematical analysis, classical literature and stylistics. In addition to his Slovak he was able to speak perfectly in Czech, German and Hungarian. With his father&#x27;s assistance, he also learned French and English.

== Further studies and career ==

After completing the Lyceum, Petzval worked for a year as an educator for Count Almássy in the Heves county. In addition to bringing in some urgently needed money, this experience also provided him with important social contacts.

From 1826 to 1828, Petzval studied at the Institutum Geometricum in Buda, and earned an engineering diploma in 1828. In the same year, he joined the graduate degree program of the university, and became the self-appointed adjunct chair for the Physics Department (in 1831). From 1828 to 1835, Petzval simultaneously worked as an urban engineer for the city of Buda—particularly as a specialist in flood abatement and sewers—and studied mathematics, mechanics and practical geometry. He authored an unrealized plan to build a navigation channel around Buda. In 1830, his dam computations saved the city from an inundation caused by the flooding of the Danube. After he received his Ph.D. in 1832, he taught as an associate professor at the university. During this period, he also received a degree in mathematics. In 1835, he was appointed a university professor in higher mathematics.

After being invited to the University of Vienna in 1836, Petzval accepted a position of the chair of mathematics there in 1837, and worked until 1877 as a professor of mathematics. Apart from mathematics, he was also concerned with mechanics, ballistics, optics, and acoustics. His lectures on the theory of algebraic equations, which integrated linear and differential equations with constant and variable coefficients, ballistics, acoustic theory, and other areas were high quality and became well attended.

Petzval moved into a rented abandoned monastery at Kahlenberg mountain. He founded his own glass-sharpening workshop there. His lenses became world-famous because Petzval was also a skillful lens sharpener and precision mechanic.

In 1840, he designed his famous portrait lens. 1845 brought disputes with the entrepreneur Peter Wilhelm Friedrich von Voigtländer (1812–1878) over who had the right to produce Petzval&#x27;s lenses. In 1859, Petzval&#x27;s home was broken into, and his manuscripts — a result of many years of research — were destroyed. Petzval never managed to reconstruct the lost documents. His most refined technical book on optics, lost with his manuscripts, would never appear in print. From then on, he primarily concerned himself with acoustics and began to withdraw from society. His enterprise with Carl Dietzler failed in 1862 (see further below); Dietzler died in 1872.

In 1869, at the age of 62, Petzval married his housekeeper, but she died four years later. In 1877, he stopped lecturing, withdrew to a monastery on Kahlenberg, and became a hermit.
Petzval died in Vienna in 1891, nearly forgotten, embittered, and destitute. His grave is in the Viennese central cemetery. His bitterness at the end of his life can probably be traced, on the one hand, to his continuing controversy with Voigtländer, the loss of his manuscripts, and his business failure; and on the other hand, to the fact that he was never really acknowledged for his lifelong work in the field of optics. Just before his death, Petzval was reported to have said:

:&quot;&quot;I defeated the light, I have it firmly in hand, because there is much darkness in the world too.&quot;

===Private life and hobbies===
Petzval was a good sportsman and rider. As a young child, he often traveled with his family to the High Tatras, and was also a dedicated athlete. In Vienna, he was for a long time the best fencer and ring fighter in the city. He also inherited an excellent talent for music from his father. Allegedly, while he was a lecturer in Vienna, he always rode to his lectures on a black Arabian horse.

Petzval never wanted to communicate anything about his private life, and was therefore relatively inscrutable to others during his lifetime. As Dr. Ermenyi described in his book, &quot;Dr. Josef Petzval&#x27;s Life&quot;

:&quot;. . . he went so far as to always insert a bare point, for example, use the appearing annual yearbook of the Imperial Academy of Sciences, in whatever apart from the names of the members the date and the place appear aforementioned to the birth for itself into this column.&quot;&quot;

At the end of his life he lived in increasingly greater isolation in his &quot;castle&quot; on Kahlenberg, with only his horse for company, although several academies and scholarly societies appointed him a member (member of the Academy of Sciences in Vienna (1846/1849), external member of the Hungarian Academy of Sciences (1873), honorary member of the Union of the Czech mathematicians and physicists (1881), carriers of the French Charles Chevalier Platinmedaille, and others).

===Disputes===
Petzval placed very high requirements on himself and others. That was probably connected with his critical, contentious and sarcastic nature, which brought him many conflicts, particularly in the field of mathematics.

Petzval had a controversy with Christian Doppler over problems of acoustics, and Doppler responded in 1852 with a book entitled &quot;Remarks Over the Objections Stated by Professor Petzval Against the Correctness of My Theory&quot;.

In particular he was involved in lengthy disputes with the entrepreneur Voigtländer. These began in 1845, when Petzval raised the issue of fraud for the first time. Because Petzval only held a patent in Austria, Voigtländer shifted his production to Braunschweig in Germany, where he produced about 60,000 Petzval lenses in the following 20 years. Petzval for his part co-operated since 1854 with the Austrian optics producer Dietzler. The latter&#x27;s lenses were marketed in Austria as the &quot;photographic Dialyt&quot;, while Voigtländer marketed the lenses in Germany and Austria as the &quot;Voightländer Orthoskop&quot;. After further interference by Voigtländer, Dietzler went bankrupt in 1862. When Petzval threatened legal action, Voigtländer closed his Austrian plant in 1866. Petzval could have then transferred the marketing, but he had renounced working with optics after his home was robbed in 1859 and worked instead on acoustics. In 1862, he also stopped lecturing on optics.

==Discoveries and inventions==

===Optics===

Petzval&#x27;s greatest achievements lie in his work with geometric optics. In 1839, Louis Daguerre presented the Daguerreotype, the first commercially successful photographic process. Fox Talbot&#x27;s calotype was discovered earlier but did not enjoy commercial success. Petzval learned of the invention from his friend, Viennese professor Andreas von Ettingshausen. The daguerreotype was problematic in that it required exposure times as long as 30 minutes to create a portrait. With Ettingshausen&#x27;s urging, Petzval set up a workshop and laboratory at Kahlenberg in Vienna and, after six months of complex computations, produced designs for improved objective lenses for both portraiture and landscape photography. Because the artillery was one of the few occupations that used advanced mathematical computations at the time, Archduke Ludwig lent eight artillery cannoneers and three corporals to the computational efforts. The calculations these men carried out in tandem with each other have been regarded as an early (albeit human) example of a parallel computer.

Petzval&#x27;s portrait objective lens (&quot;Petzval Porträtobjektiv&quot;) was an almost distortionless &quot;Anachromatischer vierlinser&quot; (double achromatic objective lens, with four lenses in three groups). The luminous intensity of this flat &quot;portrait lens&quot; was substantially higher than the daguerre standard of 1839, the Wollaston Chevalier lens (). The screen with a focal length of 160 mm made crucially shorter exposure times possible — using exposures of only about 15 to 30 seconds compared to the 10 minutes previously. Thus, snapshots became possible for the first time.

The portrait objective lens consisted of a cemented double lens in front () and a double lens with a gap in the back. The rear double lens was necessary for the correction of spherical and coma errors. The Chevalier lens used two cemented double lenses, but was immediately replaced by the Petzval lens, so that the Petzval &quot;Porträtlinse&quot; was the first cemented lens in widespread use. The first portrait objective lenses were rather small and had a diameter of 2.6 cm. The 1856 Petzval lenses produced by Dietzler had a diameter of 15 cm and a weight of 15 kg, with which one could make portraits measuring 33 by 42 cm. 

In 1840, Petzval allowed the Viennese entrepreneur Peter Wilhelm Friedrich von Voigtländer to produce the lens for a one-time payment of 2,000 guldens, without a patent or a contract, which led later to a lasting controversy between Petzval and Voigtländer. Voigtländer, who had confirmed the process through his own calculations, produced a prototype in May 1840 and began production of the lens for the daguerrotype cameras in 1841, making a fortune in the process. The thermionic cameras were made from brass, using round daguerreotype plates which exposed a diameter of 8 cm. In 1841, 600 of these cameras were manufactured and sold at a price of 120 guldens. Voigtländer received a medal at the world exhibition in Paris for this achievement. These first metal-body cameras were prototypes of today&#x27;s modern cameras. It took another 50 years until an improved camera became available. Petzval&#x27;s portrait objective lens was used into the 1920s (often under other names) in cameras and is used today in projectors. The lens played an important role in the development of photography and cinematography.

Even with all its apparent improvements, Petzval was dissatisfied with the lens and, after some improvements, left it for others to produce and patent. The camera with the new landscape objective, produced by Dietzler, possessed a light foldable chamber with double bellows. Petzval never made a commercial profit from the lens.

Among Petzval&#x27;s other works are the invention of opera glasses, lens system calculations that led to the perfection of a telescope and microscope (1843), computations for efficient binoculars, and construction of new floodlights (1847). His plan for the construction of lighting systems for ships on the Danube could not be carried out, however. His special mirror lamp (Petzval lamp), which made possible a maximum utilization of light energy, was used particularly for the bright projectors developed by Petzval. Petzval can also be regarded as the inventor of the modern unastigmatic lens system, based on records from his estate. Around 1860, Petzval conducted photogrammetric measurements using equipment he had designed. He also proved scientifically that glowing solid compounds emit more light than burning gases. Carl Freiherr Auer von Welsbach later applied this principle to the gas lamp he designed.

Petzval&#x27;s achievements are used today in cinematography, astronomy, and meteorology. The &quot;Astro-Petzval-Objektiv&quot; lens is used in astronomy. This objective made a distortion-free illustration of a large part of the sky, as well as permitting photographing of galaxies and star fields. German optics companies (Töpfer, Voigtländerkorrigie, Zeiss) produced the Petzval objective lens until the 1940s. Petzval&#x27;s largest contributions to optics are his theoretical bases for the construction and correction of optical lens systems. He carried out fundamental work for the theory of aberration in optical systems. A few central terms of this field were later named after Petzval:

* The &quot;Petzval surface&quot; is the generally curved image plane of an unadjusted optical system.
* In the case of adherence to the Petzval condition the Petzval surface is even.

To the regret of physicists, Petzval never released a prepared multi-volume optical work.

===Mathematics===

In mathematics, Petzval stressed practical applicability. He said, &quot;Mankind does not exist for science&#x27;s sake, but science should be used to improve the conditions of mankind.&quot; He worked on applications of the Laplace transformation. His work was very thorough, but not completely satisfying, since he could not use an edge integration in order to invert the transformation. Petzval wrote a paper in two volumes as well as a long work on this subject. A controversy with the student Simon Spritzer, who accused Petzval of plagiarism of Pierre-Simon Laplace, led the Spritzer-influenced mathematicians George Boole and Jules Henri Poincaré to later name the transformation after Laplace. Petzval tried to represent practically everything in his environment mathematically. Thus he tried to mathematically model fencing or the course of the horse. His obsession with mathematics finally led to the discovery of the portrait objective.

===Acoustics===

In the study of acoustics, Petzval was particularly concerned with string oscillations, differential equations of the string oscillations, and the mathematical theory of musical instruments. He designed a piano with three key sequences. Petzval developed a theory of the oscillations of strained strings as well as his own theory of tone systems.

==Memorials==

The Jozef Maximilián Petzval Museum of the History of Photography and Cinematography, part of the Slovak Technical Museum of Košice, is located in Spišská Belá, in the house where Petzval was born. The crater Petzval on the far side of the Moon is named after him, as are roads and statues in modern Slovakia, Austria, and Hungary.

In 1980 a planetoid (3716 Petzval, 1980 TG) was named after Petzval upon the request of the astronomical institute in Tatranská Lomnica and Czech scientists; Petzval&#x27;s portrait objective lens made possible the discovery of many planetoids at the end of the 19th century. The Austrian Board of Education has bestowed the &quot;Petzval Medal&quot; for special achievements in the area of scientific photography since 1928.

==Ethnicity and name==
The Magyar Tudományos Akadémia &quot;Acta technica, Volume 25, 1959&quot; notes a dispute over the ethnicity of Petzval. According to the Hungarian Academy of Sciences: 
The same publication also cites Petzval&#x27;s expressed claim to being Hungarian and a &quot;...loyal son of the fatherland&quot;
As mentioned earlier, he struggled with Hungarian language while at school, since it was not his mother tongue. 
Petzvals contemporaries widely accepted that he was Hungarian, as Petzval always proclaimed. &quot;He lived 54 years of his life in Vienna, but could not become, and did not become a Viennese - devotedly to his native country, he remained a Hungarian.&quot; - told Lueger, mayor of Vienna, at Petzval&#x27;s burial.

<doc id="843040" wikidata="Q454576" url="?curid=843040" title="Bridget Dowling">
<text>Bridget Elizabeth Hitler, née Dowling (alternative Brigid Elisabeth, or Cissie) (3 July 1891 – 18 November 1969), was Adolf Hitler&#x27;s half sister-in-law via her marriage to Alois Hitler Jr. She was the mother of Alois Hitler&#x27;s son William Patrick Hitler. She was born and raised in Dublin, Ireland.

==Marriage==
===Engagement===
In 1909, Bridget and her father, William Dowling, attended the Dublin Horse Show where they met Alois Hitler junior, who claimed to be a wealthy hotelier touring Europe when, in fact, he was a poor kitchen porter at Dublin&#x27;s Shelbourne Hotel. Alois courted Bridget at various Dublin locales and soon they were discussing marriage. On 3 June 1910, the couple eloped to London, living in Charing Cross Road for a while. Her father threatened to charge Alois with kidnapping but accepted the marriage after Bridget pleaded with him.

===Early married life===
The couple settled at 102 Upper Stanhope Street, a boarding house kept by the John family, in Toxteth, Liverpool and, in 1911 they had their only child, William Patrick Hitler. The house was destroyed in the last German air raid of the Liverpool Blitz on 10 January 1942.

===Split===
Alois went to Germany in 1914 to establish himself in business but these plans were interrupted by the outbreak of World War I. Bridget refused to go with him, as he had become violent and started beating their son. In addition, Alois Jr. was an adulterous husband, engaging in numerous extramarital affairs. Alois decided to abandon his family. He returned to Germany, remarried bigamously, and sent word after the war that he was dead. His deception was later discovered, and he was charged with bigamy by the German authorities in 1924. He escaped conviction due to Bridget&#x27;s intervention, with Bridget agreeing to a legal separation; though Alois had requested a divorce, Bridget&#x27;s stoutly Catholic father forbid her from taking that route at this point in time. Bridget raised her son alone with no support from her husband from whom she was eventually divorced (although as a Roman Catholic she was religiously opposed to divorce). She set up a home in Highgate, North London, and took in lodgers to make ends meet. William would also be supported by Bridget&#x27;s family in Ireland.

==Emigration and claims==
In 1939, Bridget joined her son on a tour of the United States where he was invited to lecture on his infamous uncle. They decided to stay and Bridget wrote a manuscript, &quot;My Brother-in-Law Adolf&quot;, in which she claimed that her famous brother-in-law had moved to Liverpool to live with Bridget and Alois from November 1912 to April 1913 to dodge conscription in his native Austria. She claims that she introduced Adolf to astrology and that she advised him to trim off the edges of his moustache.

Adolf Hitler&#x27;s stay in Liverpool has corroboration from the biographer and friend of British Intelligence chief, Sir William Stephenson, in his book &quot;A Man Called Intrepid&quot;. Sir William was chief of British Security Coordination (BSC). Biographer William Stevenson states:  &quot;Hitler&#x27;s little-known sojourn in England between November 1912 and April 1913 is authenticated by BSC documents.”

1912 to mid-1913 has been described as Hitler&#x27;s &#x27;missing year&#x27;. During that period he had been living in homeless men&#x27;s hostels in Vienna. In his book &quot;Hitler, A Life&quot;, the historian Peter Longerich confirms that &quot;Indeed, there is hardly any reliable evidence about Hitler&#x27;s life for the period 1910 to 1913.&quot; The opening sentence of Chapter 4 of Adolf Hitler&#x27;s book &quot;Mein Kampf&quot; states: &quot;In the spring of 1912 I came at last to Munich&quot;. (&quot;Im Frühjahr 1912 kam ich endgültig nach München.&quot;) But Hitler&#x27;s statement is proven to be false. A Munich police record shows that Hitler moved from Vienna to Munich, aged twenty-four, arriving on Sunday, 25 May 1913.

The question of whether Hitler visited his British relatives in Liverpool is unresolved. Some historians dismiss Bridget&#x27;s manuscript as being a fabrication written in an attempt to cash in on her famous relationship. However, in his book &quot;The Hitlers Of Liverpool&quot;, Michael Unger quotes the Canadian historian, Professor Alan Cassels, who wrote &quot;The Merseyside details are certainly circumstantially credible&quot;... &quot;I&#x27;m inclined to believe his sister-in-law&quot;. Brigitte Hamann and Hans Mommsen say that the few sources from Vienna during this period are &quot;questionable throughout&quot;. Professor Robert Waite disputes her claim that Adolf Hitler stayed with her as well as some other claims in her book in the appendix to his book &quot;The Psychopathic God: Adolf Hitler&quot;. According to David Gardner, Bridget&#x27;s daughter-in-law has said Bridget admitted to her that the book was fanciful. The story of Adolf Hitler&#x27;s visit to Liverpool has remained popular, however, and was the subject of Beryl Bainbridge&#x27;s 1978 novel &quot;Young Adolf&quot; (adapted for television by the BBC as &quot;The Journal of Bridget Hitler&quot; in 1981) and Grant Morrison and Steve Yeowell&#x27;s notorious 1989 comic &quot;The New Adventures of Hitler&quot;.

==Post-war==
After the war, Bridget and her son settled in Long Island, New York under the assumed name of Stuart-Houston. She died there on 18 November 1969 and is buried in Holy Sepulchre Cemetery in Coram, Long Island alongside her son, who died on 14 July 1987.

The family of Bridget Dowling remained a mystery until the Irish censuses for 1901 and 1911 were digitised and released online. The names of the family members, including Bridget, are given in the 1901 census under the name William Dowling of Flemings Place, near Mespil Road, Dublin. The family later moved to Denzille Street, Dublin, now named Fenian Street. Bridget&#x27;s name is not included with the Dowling family on the 1911 census. Instead, she appears as &quot;Cissie Hitler&quot; on the 1911 England and Wales Census, shown with husband &quot;Anton Hitler&quot; and son &quot;William Hitler&quot; at 102 Upper Stanhope Street, Liverpool.

<doc id="843041" wikidata="Q3098577" url="?curid=843041" title="Rich Hall">
<text>Richard Travis Hall (born June 10, 1954) is an American comedian, writer, director, actor and musician, first coming to prominence as a sketch comedian in the 1980s. He wrote and performed for a range of American networks, in series such as &quot;Fridays&quot;, &quot;Not Necessarily the News&quot; (popularising the &quot;sniglet&quot; neologism), and &quot;Saturday Night Live&quot;.

After winning a Perrier Comedy Award in 2000, using the character of Tennesseean country musician Otis Lee Crenshaw, Hall became popular in the United Kingdom, regularly appearing on &quot;QI&quot; and similar panel shows. He has created and starred in several series for the BBC, including comedies with Mike Wilmot and documentaries often concerning cinema of the United States. Hall has also maintained a successful stand-up comedy career, as both Crenshaw and himself.

==Early life==
Richard Hall was born in Alexandria, Virginia, and grew up in Charlotte, North Carolina. He says he is of partial Cherokee descent. Early in his career, he performed as a street comedian with a suitcase and stand, traveling the college circuit and performing impromptu skits for gathering crowds. He attended Western Carolina University.

==Career==
===United States===

Hall&#x27;s first professional work was as a writer and performer on the original daytime &quot;David Letterman Show&quot; (1980) (for which he won the 1981 
Emmy Award for Outstanding Individual Achievement - Writing) and the sketch comedy TV series &quot;Fridays&quot;, becoming a cast member on that show during its third and final season. After the end of &quot;Fridays&quot;, Hall co-wrote and starred in the satirical comedy series &quot;Not Necessarily the News&quot; from 1983 until 1990 where he coined the term &quot;sniglet&quot; to describe newly created words and collected and published several volumes of books of them.
He was also a regular on &quot;Saturday Night Live&quot; for the show&#x27;s tenth season (1984–1985), becoming the only &quot;Fridays&quot; cast member to be an &quot;SNL&quot; cast member (Larry David, while also a &quot;Fridays&quot; cast member who went on to work for &quot;SNL&quot;, was hired as a writer for the 1984-1985 season, only appeared onscreen in that same season as an extra, and, more recently, hosted in 2016 and 2017 and became popular for his cameo appearances as Senator Bernie Sanders [whom David later found out he was related to]).

In 1986, Hall had his own Showtime channel special, &quot;Vanishing America&quot;, which was turned into a book with the same title. He hosted a talk show during The Comedy Channel&#x27;s 1990–91 season, titled &quot;Rich Hall&#x27;s Onion World&quot;.

In the United States, he has appeared several times on American talk shows such as &quot;The Tonight Show Starring Johnny Carson&quot;, &quot;Late Show with David Letterman&quot; and &quot;Late Night with Conan O&#x27;Brien&quot;.

Hall made a special guest appearance as himself in the Cartoon Network talk show &quot;Space Ghost Coast to Coast&quot;.

In 2011, Hall voiced an Idaho man in Sony Pictures Animation&#x27;s &quot;Arthur Christmas&quot;.

===United Kingdom===
Outside the US, Hall has also achieved popularity in the United Kingdom. He spends part of his time writing plays in the United States, where he has a small ranch just outside Livingston, Montana. The rest of the time is spent in London, where he owns a flat.

Hall is a guest on popular BBC panel quiz shows, most notably as a regular guest on &quot;QI&quot;, and also with appearances in &quot;8 Out of 10 Cats&quot;, &quot;Have I Got News for You&quot; and &quot;Never Mind the Buzzcocks&quot;. He has also appeared on the British stand-up comedy series Jack Dee&#x27;s &quot;Live at the Apollo&quot;. His appearances achieved some cult status due to his line of jokes on &quot;Live at the Apollo&quot; about Tom Cruise and the perceivable similarities between many of his roles. In 2006, Hall also wrote and acted in the play &quot;Levelland&quot; at the Edinburgh Festival.

Hall has had four BBC TV series of his own: &quot;Rich Hall&#x27;s Badly Funded Think Tank&quot;, &quot;Rich Hall&#x27;s Fishing Show&quot; in 2003, &quot;Rich Hall&#x27;s Cattle Drive&quot; in 2006, as well as a one-off programme about the 2004 American Presidential Elections, &quot;Rich Hall&#x27;s Election Special&quot;. He also appeared on the BBC Two programme &quot;Top Gear&quot;, where he successfully managed to make a song about a Rover 25 car, much to the enjoyment of host Jeremy Clarkson and the audience. After the September 11 attacks, Hall was entrusted with the task of responding to the tragedy on the first subsequent edition of &quot;Have I Got News for You&quot;.

Hall has written and presented 90-minute documentaries about American film genres, culture and history, broadcast on BBC Four. Initially these documentaries focused on film genres: &quot;Rich Hall&#x27;s How the West Was Lost&quot; (first broadcast June 2008) discusses Westerns, &quot;Rich Hall&#x27;s The Dirty South&quot; (October 2010) challenges stereotypical Hollywood presentations of the Southern United States, &quot;Rich Hall&#x27;s Continental Drifters&quot; (November 2011) examines the American road movie, &quot;Rich Hall&#x27;s Inventing the Indian&quot; (October 2012) discusses portrayals of Native Americans. His subsequent documentaries cover broader aspects of American culture and politics: &quot;Rich Hall&#x27;s You Can Go to Hell, I&#x27;m Going to Texas&quot; (June 2013) and &quot;Rich Hall&#x27;s California Stars&quot; (July 2014) focus on Texas and California respectively, &quot;Rich Hall&#x27;s Presidential Grudge Match&quot; (broadcast 7 November 2016, the day before the 2016 United States presidential election) is a history of US Presidents and their election campaigns, &quot;Rich Hall&#x27;s Countrier Than You&quot; (March 2017) discusses country music, &quot;Rich Hall&#x27;s Working for the American Dream&quot; (July 2018) questions the attainability of the American Dream, and &quot;Rich Hall&#x27;s Red Menace&quot; (November 2019) is about the Cold War.

In 2007, he returned to the Fringe with his second play, &quot;Best Western&quot;, which he wrote and directed. His autumn 2009 tour included a performance at London&#x27;s Hammersmith Apollo, which was recorded and released in November 2009 as a live DVD.

In 2009, he performed at the Edinburgh Festival Fringe in two shows, his solo stand up and also with longtime collaborator Mike Wilmot and Montana-based actor Tim Williams in a new play entitled &quot;Campfire Stories&quot;.

On April 5, 2010, Hall appeared as one of the stand-up acts on &quot;Channel 4&#x27;s Comedy Gala&quot;, a benefit show organized by Channel 4 to raise money for Great Ormond Street Children&#x27;s Hospital.

Hall was a regular performer on Channel 4&#x27;s &quot;Stand Up for the Week&quot;, which began in June 2010.

In January 2015, Hall started a comedy tour of the UK called &quot;3:10 to Humour&quot;.

Hall also frequently appears in episodes of &quot;Very British Problems&quot;.

===Other appearances===
Rich Hall made an Irish TV appearance as a guest on the fifth series of RTÉ&#x27;s topical news comedy programme, &quot;Don&#x27;t Feed the Gondolas&quot;, and has appeared at the Kilkenny Cat Laughs comedy festival on 15 occasions. He has also performed at the West Belfast Festival/Feile an Phobail, one of the largest community festivals in Ireland, to a sell-out audience where he received widespread critical acclaim. He appeared in several Pizza Hut commercials in the 1980s, mainly promoting Pizza Hut&#x27;s guarantee of serving each customer within five minutes.

Hall has achieved some popularity in Australia, regularly appearing at the Melbourne International Comedy Festival and the Adelaide Fringe, and on Australian comedy panel shows such as &quot;The Glass House&quot; and &quot;Spicks and Specks&quot;.

Hall appeared at the Garvey 1989 Celebrity Ski Classic and at the Altitude Comedy Festival 2008 in the ski resort of Meribel in France. He also appeared – albeit briefly – in the 2006 &quot;Cheap Seats&quot; (ESPNCL) episode titled &quot;Steve Garvey Celebrity Skiing&quot;.

From 2015 onwards, Hall has lent his voice as Captain Taylor in the ITV series &quot;Thunderbirds Are Go&quot;, with the character first appearing in the episode &quot;Relic&quot;. The character made further appearances in show&#x27;s second and third season.

Hall is a frequent guest panellist on the British panel show &quot;QI&quot;, having appeared 25 times on the show. He has also won more episodes than any other guest panellist (10).

==Otis Lee Crenshaw==

In 2000, he won the Perrier Comedy Award at the Edinburgh Fringe, under the guise of his own grizzled uncle, Otis Lee Crenshaw, the much-convicted country music singer.

He has released several albums, including &quot;How Do We Do It? Volume!&quot; in 2003, and a concert video, as this character. The first album, &quot;London Not Tennessee&quot;, in 2001, was recorded on the first comedy tour, and includes two duets on stage with US singer Catherine Porter. In 2004, he published a book of the man&#x27;s memoirs, entitled &quot;Otis Lee Crenshaw: I Blame Society&quot;, and in 2007 he finished a screenplay for a film based on the book, written for the director Mel Smith.

In 2008, Hall toured two stand-up shows around the UK: &quot;Rich Hall Autumn Tour 2008&quot; played around 45 dates and headlined as his alter-ego in a show entitled &quot;Otis Lee Crenshaw and Band&quot;, with Rich Hall listed as a &quot;special guest&quot;. He subsequently toured a version of this show throughout the UK and Ireland in 2009, with longtime sidekick Myron T. Buttram (guitarist and pedal steel player, Rob Childs) and Lonesome Dave (banjoist and guitarist, David Lindsay) appearing at the 2009 Adelaide Fringe festival, the Sydney Opera House, and the 2009 Melbourne Comedy festival. The band was originally credited as &quot;The Black Liars&quot; and was renamed &quot;The Honky Tonk A**holes&quot; when joined by Horst Furst II (bassist Nigel Portman Smith) and drummer Mark Hewitt.

==Personal life==
Hall married his wife Karen – a filmmaker from Liverpool, England – in 2004. The couple have two children and reside in London.

<doc id="843049" wikidata="Q1406911" url="?curid=843049" title="Anti-Slavic sentiment">
<text>Anti-Slavic sentiment, also called Slavophobia, refers to prejudice, collective hatred, and discrimination directed at the various Slavic peoples. Accompanying racism and xenophobia, the most common manifestation of anti-Slavic sentiment throughout history has been the assertion that some Slavs are inferior to other peoples. This sentiment peaked during World War II, when Nazi Germany classified most of the Slavs— especially the Poles, Russians, Belarusians, Serbs, Ukrainians, and Central Asians—as &quot;subhumans&quot; () and planned to exterminate a large number of them through the &quot;Generalplan Ost&quot; and Hunger Plan. Slavophobia also emerged twice in the United States: the first time was during the Progressive Era, when immigrants from Eastern Europe were met with opposition from the dominant class of Western European–origin American citizens; and again during the Cold War, when the United States became locked in an intensive global rivalry with the Soviet Union.

== By country ==
=== Albania ===
At the beginning of the 20th century, anti-Slavism in Albania was developed by the work of the Franciscan friars who had studied in monasteries in Austria-Hungary, after the recent massacres and expulsions of Albanians by their Slavic neighbours. The Albanian intelligentsia proudly asserted, &quot;We Albanians are the original and autochthonous race of the Balkans. The Slavs are conquerors and immigrants who came but yesterday from Asia.&quot; In Soviet historiography, anti-Slavism in Albania was inspired by the Catholic clergy, which opposed the Slavic people because of the role the Catholic clergy and Slavs opposed &quot;rapacious plans of Austro-Hungarian imperialism in Albania&quot;.

=== Italy ===

In the 1920s, Italian fascists hated the Yugoslavs, especially the Croatians and Serbs. They accused the Serbs &amp; Croats of having &quot;atavistic impulses&quot; and they also claimed that the Yugoslavs were conspiring on behalf of &quot;Grand Orient Masonry and its funds&quot;. One anti-Semitic claim stated that the Serbs were involved in a &quot;social-democratic, masonic Jewish internationalist plot&quot;.

Benito Mussolini considered the Slavic race inferior and barbaric. He believed that the Croats were a threat to Italy because they wanted to seize Dalmatia, a region which was claimed by Italy, and he also claimed that the threat rallied Italians at the end of World War I: &quot;The danger of seeing the Jugo-Slavians settle along the whole Adriatic shore had caused a bringing together in Rome of the cream of our unhappy regions. Students, professors, workmen, citizens—representative men—were entreating the ministers and the professional politicians.&quot; These claims often tended to emphasize the &quot;foreignness&quot; of the Yugoslavs by stating that they were newcomers to the area, unlike the ancient Italians, whose territories were occupied by the Slavs.

Count Galeazzo Ciano, Mussolini&#x27;s son in law, and the Foreign Minister of Fascist Italy who was later executed by Mussolini, wrote the following entry in his diary:

===Canada===
In Canada, many xenophobic white supremacists were deeply tied to their nation&#x27;s &quot;Anglo-Saxon&quot; culture, specifically from the early 1900s to the end of World War II. The Ku Klux Klan in Canada was prominent in the provinces of Saskatchewan and Alberta, both of which have a relatively high Eastern European ethnic population. Immigrants from Ukraine, Russia, and Poland were frequently denounced and targeted.

During World War I, thousands of Ukrainian Canadians were seen as &quot;enemy aliens&quot; as Canadian nativists saw them as a &quot;threat&quot; to Canada&#x27;s Western European heritage. Due to this, many of them were interned in concentration camps. There was constant discrimination towards Ukrainians who recently immigrated from the Austro-Hungarian Empire.

=== Germany ===
Though anti-Slavic sentiments reached their peak during Nazi Germany, Germany has had a long history of Slavophobia. In particular, the Germanic people of Prussia often depicted Polish people in a negative light, which paralleled future Slavophobia in the Nazi regime. 

 in his 1968 article &quot; Замолчанный Маркс&quot; (&quot;Hushed-up Marx&quot;) provides ample evidence of anti-Slavism the founders of Marxism, Karl Marx and Friedrich Engels. For example, in his 1849 article &quot;The Magyar Struggle,&quot; Engels wrote that the Slavs living in the Austrian Empire were &quot;barbarians&quot; who &quot;needed to be saved&quot; by the Germanic Austrians.

Gustav Freytag&#x27;s 1855 novel &quot;Soll und Haben&quot; (&quot;Debt and Credit&quot;) was one of the most-read German novels of the 19th century, and contained antisemitic sentiments as well as depictions of Poles as incompetent.

==== Nazi Germany ====

Anti-Slavic racism played a significant role within the ideology of Nazism. Adolf Hitler and the Nazi Party held the belief that Slavic countries - particularly Poland, the Soviet Union, and Yugoslavia, as well as their respective peoples - were &quot;&quot;Untermenschen&quot; (subhumans).&quot; According to their viewpoint, these Slavic nations were deemed to be foreign entities and were not considered part of the Aryan master race. Nazi Germany depicted the Soviet Union as an &quot;Asiatic enemy&quot; of Europeans, in addition to portraying its population as inferior subhumans controlled by Jews and communists.

Hitler’s autobiography &quot;Mein Kampf&quot; was openly anti-Slavic. He wrote: “One ought to cast the utmost doubt on the state-building power of the Slavs,” and from the beginning, he rejected the idea of incorporating the Slavs into Greater Germany. 

Hitler considered the Slavs to be racially inferior, because, in his view, the Bolshevik Revolution had put the Jews in power over the mass of Slavs, who were, by his own definition, incapable of ruling themselves but were instead being ruled by Jewish masters. He considered the development of modern Russia to have been the work of Germanic, not Slavic, elements in the nation, but believed those achievements had been undone and destroyed by the October Revolution, in &quot;Mein Kampf&quot;, he wrote, “The organization of a Russian state formation was not the result of the political abilities of the Slavs in Russia, but only a wonderful example of the state-forming efficacity of the German element in an inferior race.”

Because, according to the Nazis, the German people needed more territory to sustain its surplus population, an ideology of conquest and depopulation was formulated for Central and Eastern Europe according to the principle of &quot;Lebensraum&quot;, itself based on an older theme in German nationalism which maintained that Germany had a &quot;natural yearning&quot; to expand its borders eastward (&quot;Drang Nach Osten)&quot;. The Nazis&#x27; policy towards Slavs was to exterminate or enslave the vast majority of the Slavic population and repopulate their lands with millions of ethnic Germans and other Germanic peoples. According to the resulting genocidal &quot;Generalplan Ost&quot;, millions of German and other &quot;Germanic&quot; settlers would be moved into the conquered territories, and the original Slavic inhabitants were to be annihilated, removed or enslaved. The policy was focused especially on the Soviet Union, as it alone was deemed capable of providing enough territory to accomplish this goal. 

As part of the &quot;Generalplan Ost&quot;, Nazi Germany developed the Hunger Plan, a forced starvation programme which involved the seizure of all of the food which was produced on Eastern European lands and the delivery of it to Germany, primarily to the German army. The full implementation of this plan would have ultimately resulted in the starvation and death of 20 to 30 million people (mainly Russians, Belarusians, and Ukrainians). It is estimated that in accordance with this plan, over four million Soviet citizens were starved to death from 1941 to 1944. The resettlement policy reached a much more advanced stage in occupied Poland because of its immediate proximity to Germany.

For strategic reasons, the Nazis deviated from some of their ideological theories by forging alliances with Ukrainian collaborators, the Independent State of Croatia (established after the invasion of Yugoslavia), the Slovak State (established after the occupation of Czechoslovakia) and Bulgaria. Yugoslav general Milan Nedić would also lead Nazi Germany&#x27;s Serbian puppet government. The Nazis officially justified these alliances by stating that the Croats were &quot;more Germanic than Slav&quot;, a notion which was propagated by Croatia&#x27;s leader Ante Pavelić, who espoused the view that the &quot;Croats were the descendants of the ancient Goths&quot; who &quot;had the pan-Slavic idea forced upon them as something artificial&quot;. Hitler also believed that the Bulgarians were &quot;Turkoman&quot;, while the Czechs and Slovaks were &quot;Mongolians&quot; in their origins. After conquering Yugoslavia, attention was instead focused on targeting mainly the nation&#x27;s Jewish and Roma (Gypsy) population.

==== After Nazi Germany ====
Though Slavophobia became less prevalent after WWII, it still persisted to some degree and still persists today. Slavic immigrants in Germany experience discrimination due to their accents, their surnames, and their cuisine. Since the invasion of Ukraine by Russia in 2022, Russian speakers in Germany have faced increased discrimination, including collective blame for Russia&#x27;s actions in the war, despite most having lived in Germany for decades and many not being Russian at all. Since the Russian language was the lingua franca of the Soviet Union, an immigrant living in Germany who speaks Russian could be from anywhere that was influenced by the Soviet Union.

=== Greece ===
Traditionally, in Greece, Slavic people were considered &quot;invaders who separated the glory of Greek Antiquity, by bringing an era of decline and ruin to Greece – the Dark Ages&quot;. In 1913, when Greece took control of Slavic-inhabited areas in Northern Greece, the Slavic toponyms were changed to Greek, and according to the Greek government, this was &quot;the elimination of all the names which pollute and disfigure the beautiful appearance of our fatherland.&quot;

Anti-Slavic sentiment escalated during the Greek Civil War, when Macedonian partisans, who aligned themselves with the Democratic Army of Greece, were not treated as equals and suffered discrimination everywhere, they were accused of committing a &quot;sin&quot; because they chose to identify themselves as Slavs rather than Greeks. The Macedonian partisans were subjected to threats of extermination, physical attacks, murder, attacks on their settlements, forcible expulsions, restrictions on freedom of movement, and bureaucratic problems, among other discriminatory acts. Although they were allied with the Greek Left, due to their Slavic identity, the Macedonians were viewed with suspicion and animosity by the Greek Left.

In 1948, the Democratic Army of Greece evacuated tens of thousands of child refugees, both Greek and Slavic in origin. In 1985, the refugees were allowed to re-enter Greece, claim Greek citizenship, and reclaim property, but only if they were &quot;Greek by genus&quot;, thus prohibiting those with a Slavic identity from obtaining Greek citizenship, entering Greece, and claiming property.

Today, the Greek state does not recognize its ethnic Macedonian and other Slavic minorities, claiming that they do not exist, with Greece therefore having the right not to grant them any of the rights that are guaranteed to them by human-rights treaties.

=== United States ===
The United States of America has a long history of Slavophobia. Slavophobia began in earnest during the &quot;second wave&quot; of European immigration in the early 1900s, when many people from Southern and Eastern Europe were immigrating to the US. They faced opposition from the &quot;old&quot; immigrants, who were mostly from Northern and Western Europe. These attitudes culminated in the Immigration Act of 1924, which established quotas for and limited the numbers of people from Southern and Eastern European countries who were allowed to enter the US. Slavic peoples were considered to be people of an &quot;inferior race&quot; who were unable to assimilate into American society. They were originally not considered to be &quot;fully white&quot; (and thus fully American), and Slavic peoples&#x27; &quot;whiteness&quot; continues to be a debate to this day, but most people consider them to be of Caucasian culture.

Slavophobia in the US ramped up again during the Cold War, when Slavic peoples of all nationalities were considered enemies due to the United States&#x27; distrust of the Soviet Union. War in the Balkans (which America often had a part in) was considered inevitable due to the Balkan peoples&#x27; &quot;propensity for extreme war violence.&quot; The United States government, while claiming to advocate for national determination for small countries, has denied national determination to many of the countries in Eastern Europe and the Balkans. As a result, many Slavic people in the US and Western countries felt pressure (and continue to feel pressure) to Anglicize their surnames and downplay their Slavic culture.

In American pop culture, Slavic people (specifically Russians) are usually portrayed as either nefarious, violent criminals or as unintelligent, oblivious comic relief. &quot;Dumb Pole&quot; jokes or &quot;Polish jokes&quot; (derogatory jokes towards Polish people) are just one manifestation of anti-Polish sentiment in America, and can be found in all sorts of media from many time periods.

Slavophobia has had a resurgence in America following Russia&#x27;s invasion of Ukraine, where Russian-Americans and people of Russian descent have been collectively blamed for the Russian government&#x27;s actions.

<doc id="843050" wikidata="Q2685471" url="?curid=843050" title="Net metering">
<text>Net metering (or net energy metering, NEM) is an electricity billing mechanism that allows consumers who generate some or all of their own electricity to use that electricity anytime, instead of when it is generated. This is particularly important with renewable energy sources like wind and solar, which are non-dispatchable (when not coupled to storage). Monthly net metering allows consumers to use solar power generated during the day at night, or wind from a windy day later in the month. Annual net metering rolls over a net kilowatt-hour (kWh) credit to the following month, allowing solar power that was generated in July to be used in December, or wind power from March in August.

Net metering policies can vary significantly by country and by state or province: if net metering is available, if and how long banked credits can be retained, and how much the credits are worth (retail/wholesale). Most net metering laws involve monthly rollover of kWh credits, a small monthly connection fee, require a monthly payment of deficits (i.e. normal electric bill), and annual settlement of any residual credit. Net metering uses a single, bi-directional meter and can measure the current flowing in two directions.
Net metering can be implemented solely as an accounting procedure, and requires no special metering, or even any prior arrangement or notification.

Net metering is an enabling policy designed to foster private investment in renewable energy.

== History ==
Net metering originated in the United States, where small wind turbines and solar panels were connected to the electrical grid, and consumers wanted to be able to use the electricity generated at a different time or date from when it was generated. The first two projects to use net metering were an apartment complex and a solar test house in Massachusetts in 1979. Minnesota is commonly cited as passing the first net metering law, in 1983, and allowed anyone generating less than 40 kW to either roll over any credit to the next month, or be paid for the excess. In 2000 this was amended to compensation &quot;at the average retail utility energy rate&quot;. This is the simplest and most general interpretation of net metering, and in addition allows small producers to sell electricity at the retail rate.

Utilities in Idaho adopted net metering in 1980, and in Arizona in 1981. Massachusetts adopted net metering in 1982. By 1998, 22 states or utilities therein had adopted net metering. Two California utilities initially adopted a monthly &quot;net metering&quot; charge, which included a &quot;standby charge&quot;, until the Public Utilities Commission (PUC) banned such charges. In 2005, all U.S. utilities were required to consider adopting rules offering net metering &quot;upon request&quot; by the Energy Policy Act of 2005. Excess generation is not addressed. As of 2013, 43 U.S. states have adopted net metering, as well as utilities in 3 of the remaining states, leaving only 4 states without any established procedures for implementing net metering. However, a 2017 study showed that only 3% of U.S. utilities offer full retail compensation for net metering with the remainder offering less than retail rates, having credit expire annually, or some form of indefinite rollover.

Net metering was slow to be adopted in Europe, especially in the United Kingdom, because of confusion over how to address the value added tax (VAT). Only one utility company in Great Britain offers net metering.

The United Kingdom government is reluctant to introduce the net metering principle because of complications in paying and refunding the value added tax that is payable on electricity, but pilot projects are underway in some areas.

In Canada, some provinces have net metering programs.

In the Philippines, Net Metering scheme is governed by Republic Act 9513 (Renewable Energy Act of 2008) and its implementing rules and regulation (IRR). The implementing body is the Energy Regulatory Commission (ERC) in consultation with the National Renewable Energy Board (NREB). Unfortunately, the scheme is not a true net metering scheme but in reality a net billing scheme. As the Dept of Energy&#x27;s Net Metering guidelines say, &quot;Net-metering allows customers of Distribution Utilities (DUs) to install an on-site Renewable Energy (RE) facility not exceeding 100 kilowatts (kW) in capacity so they can generate electricity for their own use. Any electricity generated that is not consumed by the customer is automatically exported to the DU&#x27;s distribution system. The DU then gives a peso credit for the excess electricity received equivalent to the DU’s blended generation cost, excluding other generation adjustments, and deducts the credits earned to the customer’s electric bill.&quot;

Thus Philippine consumers who generate their own electricity and sell their surplus to the utility are paid what is called the &quot;generation cost&quot; which is often less than 50% of the retail price of electricity.

== Controversy ==
Net metering is controversial as it affects different interests on the grid. A report prepared by Peter Kind of Energy Infrastructure Advocates for the trade association Edison Electric Institute stated that distributed generation systems, like rooftop solar, present unique challenges to the future of electric utilities. Utilities in the United States have led a largely unsuccessful campaign to eliminate net metering.

===Benefits===
Renewable advocates point out that while distributed solar and other energy efficiency measures do pose a challenge to electric utilities&#x27; existing business model, the benefits of distributed generation outweigh the costs, and those benefits are shared by all ratepayers. Grid benefits of private distributed solar investment include reduced need for centralizing power plants and reduced strain on the utility grid. They also point out that, as a cornerstone policy enabling the growth of rooftop solar, net metering creates a host of societal benefits for all ratepayers that are generally not accounted for by the utility analysis, including: public health benefits, employment and downstream economic effects, market price impacts, grid security benefits, and water savings.

An independent report conducted by the consulting firm Crossborder Energy found that the benefits of California&#x27;s net metering program outweigh the costs to ratepayers. Those net benefits will amount to more than US$92 million annually upon the completion of the current net metering program.

A 2012 report on the cost of net metering in the State of California, commissioned by the California Public Utilities Commission (CPUC), showed that those customers without distributed generation systems will pay US$287 in additional costs to use and maintain the grid every year by 2020. The report also showed the net cost will amount to US$1.1 billion by 2020. Notably, the same report found that solar customers do pay more on their power bills than what it costs the utility to serve them (Table 5, page 10: average 103% of their cost of service across the three major utilities in 2011).

===Drawbacks===
Many electric utilities state that owners of generation systems do not pay the full cost of service to use the grid, thus shifting their share of the cost onto customers without distributed generation systems. Most owners of rooftop solar or other types of distributed generation systems still rely on the grid to receive electricity from utilities at night or when their systems cannot generate sufficient power.

A 2014 report funded by the Institute for Electric Innovation (which engages in lobbying for the benefit of its member electricity companies) claims that net metering in California produces excessively large subsidies for typical residential rooftop solar photovoltaic (PV) facilities. These subsidies must then be paid for by other residential customers, most of whom are less affluent than the rooftop solar PV customers. In addition, the report points out that most of these large subsidies go to the solar leasing companies, which accounted for about 75 percent of the solar PV facilities installed in 2013. The report concludes that changes are needed in California, ranging from the adoption of retail tariffs that are more cost-reflective to replacing net metering with a separate &quot;Buy All - Sell All&quot; arrangement that requires all rooftop solar PV customers to buy all of their consumed energy under the existing retail tariffs and separately sell all of their onsite generation to their distribution utilities at the utilities&#x27; respective avoided costs.

== Post-net metering successor tariffs ==
On a nationwide basis, energy officials have debated replacement programs for net metering for several years. As of 2018, a few &quot;replicable models&quot; have emerged. Utility companies have always contended that customers with solar get their bills reduced by too much under net metering, and as a result, that shifts costs for keeping up the grid infrastructure to the rest of the non-solar customers. &quot;The policy has led to heated state-level debates since 2003 over whether — and how — to construct a successor to the policy,&quot; according to Utility Dive. The key challenge to constructing pricing and rebate schemes in a post-net metering environment is how to compensate rooftop solar customers fairly while not imposing costs on non-solar customers. Experts have said that a good &quot;successor tariff,&quot; as the post-net metering policies have been called, is one that supports the growth of distributed energy resources in a way where customers and the grid get benefits from it.

Thirteen states swapped successor tariffs for retail rate net metering programs in 2017. In 2018, three more states made similar changes. For example, compensation in Nevada will go down over time, but today the compensation is at the retail rate (meaning, solar customers who send energy to the grid get compensated at the same rate they pay for electricity). In Arizona, the new solar rate is ten percent below the retail rate.

The two most common successor tariffs are called &quot;net billing&quot; and &quot;buy-all-sell-all&quot; (BASA). &quot;Net billing pays the retail rate for customer-consumed PV generation and a below retail rate for exported generation. With BASA, the utility both charges and compensates at a below-retail rate.&quot;

== Comparison ==
There is considerable confusion between the terms &quot;net metering&quot; and &quot;feed-in tariff&quot;# (FIT). In general there are three types of compensation for local, distributed generation:
# Net metering: always at retail, and which is not technically compensation, although it may become compensation if there is excess generation and payments are allowed by the utility.
# Feed-in tariff: generally above retail, and reduces to retail as the percentage of adopters increases.
# Power purchase agreement: Compensation generally below retail, also known as a &quot;Standard Offer Program&quot;, can be above retail, particularly in the case of solar, which tends to be generated close to peak demand.

Net metering only requires one meter. A feed-in tariff requires two.

== Time of use metering ==

Time of use (TOU) net metering employs a smart (electric) meter that is programmed to determine electricity usage any time during the day. Time-of-use allows utility rates and charges to be assessed based on when the electricity was used (i.e., day/night and seasonal rates). Typically the generation cost of electricity is highest during the daytime peak usage period at sunset, and lowest in the middle of night.
Time of use metering is a significant issue for renewable-energy sources, since, for example, solar power systems tend to produce most energy at noon and produce little power during the daytime peak-price period (see also duck curve), and no power during the night period when price is low. California, Italy and Australia has installed so many photovoltaic cells that peak prices no longer are during the day, but are instead in the evening. TOU net metering affects the apparent cost of net metering to a utility.

== Market rate net metering ==

In market rate net metering systems the user&#x27;s energy use is priced dynamically according to some function of wholesale electric prices. The users&#x27; meters are programmed remotely to calculate the value and are read remotely. Net metering applies such variable pricing to excess power produced by a qualifying system.

Market rate metering systems were implemented in California starting in 2006, and under the terms of California&#x27;s net metering rules will be applicable to qualifying photovoltaic and wind systems. Under California law the payback for surplus electricity sent to the grid must be equal to the (variable, in this case) price charged at that time.

Net metering enables small systems to result in zero annual net cost to the consumer provided that the consumer is able to shift demand loads to a lower price time, such as by chilling water at a low cost time for later use in air conditioning, or by charging a battery electric vehicle during off-peak times, while the electricity generated at peak demand time can be sent to the grid rather than used locally (see Vehicle-to-grid). No credit is given for annual surplus production.

== Excess generation ==
Excess generation is a separate issue from net metering, but it is normally dealt with in the same rules, because it can arise. If local generation offsets a portion of the demand, net metering is not used. If local generation exceeds demand some of the time, for example during the day, net metering is used. If local generation exceeds demand for the billing cycle, best practices calls for a perpetual roll over of the kilowatt-hour credits, although some regions have considered having any kWh credits expire after 36 months. The normal definition of excess generation is annually, although the term is equally applicable monthly. The treatment of annual excess generation (and monthly) ranges from lost, to compensation at avoided cost, to compensation at retail rate.&gt; Left over kWh credits upon termination of service would ideally be paid at retail rate, from the consumer standpoint, and lost, from the utility standpoint, with avoided cost a minimum compromise. Some regions allow optional payment for excess annual generation, which allows perpetual roll over or payment, at the customers choice. Both wind and solar are inherently seasonal, and it is highly likely to use up a surplus later, unless more solar panels or a larger wind turbine have been installed than needed.

==Energy storage==
Net metering systems can have energy storage integrated, to store some of the power locally (i.e. from the renewable energy source connected to the system) rather than selling everything back to the mains electricity grid. Often, the batteries used are industrial deep cycle batteries as these last for 10 to 20 years. Lead-acid batteries are often also still used, but last much less long (5 years or so). Lithium-ion batteries are sometimes also used, but too have a relatively short lifespan. Finally, nickel-iron batteries last the longest with a lifespan of up to 40 years. A 2017 study of solar panels with battery storage indicated an 8 to 14 percent extra consumption of electricity from charging and discharging batteries.

==Adoption by country==
=== Australia ===

In some Australian states, the &quot;feed-in tariff&quot; is actually net metering, except that it pays monthly for net generation at a higher rate than retail, with Environment Victoria Campaigns Director Mark Wakeham calling it a &quot;fake feed-in tariff.&quot; A feed-in tariff requires a separate meter, and pays for all local generation at a preferential rate, while net metering requires only one meter. The financial differences are very substantial.

In Victoria, from 2009, householders were paid 60 cents for every excess kilowatt hour of energy fed back into the state electricity grid. This was around three times the retail price for electricity at that time. However, subsequent state governments reduced the feed-in in several updates, until in 2016 the feed-in is as low as 5 cents per kilowatt hour.

In Queensland starting in 2008, the Solar Bonus Scheme pays 44 cents for every excess kilowatt hour of energy fed back into the state electricity grid. This is around three times the current retail price for electricity. However, from 2012, the Queensland feed in tariff has been reduced to 6-10 cents per kilowatt hour depending on which electricity retailer the customer has signed up with.

Australian smart grid technologist, Steve Hoy, originated the opposing concept of &quot;True Zero&quot;, as opposed to &quot;Net Zero&quot;, to express the emerging capability to trace electricity through net metering. The meter allows consumers to trace their electricity to the source, making clean energy more accessible to everyone.

=== Canada ===
Ontario allows net metering for systems up to 500 kW, however credits can only be carried for 12 consecutive months. Should a consumer establish a credit where they generate more than they consume for 8 months and use up the credits in the 10th month, then the 12-month period begins again from the date that the next credit is shown on an invoice. Any unused credits remaining at the end of 12 consecutive months of a consumer being in a credit situation are cleared at the end of that billing.

Areas of British Columbia serviced by BC Hydro are allowed net metering for up to 100 kW. At each annual anniversary on March 1 the customer is paid a market price, calculated as daily average mid-Columbia price for a previous year. FortisBC which serves an area in South Central BC also allows net-metering for up to 50 kW. Customers are paid their existing retail rate for any net energy they produce. The City of New Westminster, which has its own electrical utility, also allows net metering.

New Brunswick allows net metering for installations up to 100 kW. Credits from excess generated power can be carried over until March at which time any excess credits are lost.

SaskPower allows net metering for installations up to 100 kW. Credits from excess generated power can be carried over until the customer&#x27;s annual anniversary date, at which time any excess credits are lost.

In Nova Scotia, in 2015, 43 residences and businesses began using solar panels for electricity. By 2017, the number was up to 133. These customers’ solar systems are net metered. The excess power produced by the solar panels is bought back from the homeowner by Nova Scotia Power at the same rate that the utility sells it to its customers. “The downside for Nova Scotia Power is that it must maintain the capacity to produce electricity even when it is not sunny.”

=== European Union ===
Denmark established net-metering for privately owned PV systems in mid-1998 for a pilot-period of four years. In 2002 the net-metering scheme was extended another four years up to end of 2006. Net-metering has proved to be a cheap, easy to administer and effective way of stimulating the deployment of PV in Denmark; however the relative short time window of the arrangement has so far prevented it from reaching its full potential. During the political negotiations in the fall of 2005 the net-metering for privately owned PV systems was made permanent.

The Netherlands has net-metering since 2004. Initially there was a limit of 3000 kWh per year. Later this limit was increased to 5000 kWh. The limit was removed altogether on January 1, 2014.

Italy offers a support scheme, mixing net-metering and a well segmented premium FiT.

Slovenia has annual net-metering since January 2016 for up to 11 kVA. In a calendar year up to 10 MVA can be installed in the country.

In 2010, Spain, net-metering has been proposed by the &quot;Asociación de la Industria Fotovoltaica&quot; (ASIF) to promote renewable electricity, without requiring additional economic support. Net-metering for privately owned systems will be established in 2019, after Royal Decree 244/2019 was accepted by the government on April 5.

Some form of net metering is now proposed by &quot;Électricité de France&quot;. According to their website, energy produced by home-owners is bought at a higher price than what is charged as consumers. Hence, some recommend to sell all energy produced, and buy back all energy needed at a lower price. The price has been fixed for 20 years by the government.

Ireland is planning to implement a net metering system, under the &quot;Micro-generation Support Scheme&quot;.

Under the proposed scheme, micro-generators can sell 30% of the excess electricity they produce and export it back to the grid. The price that electricity will be sold at is being formulated during the consultation process.

Poland has introduced net metering for private and commercial renewable energy sources of up to 50 kW in 2015. Under this legislation energy sent to grid must be used within one year from feed-in, otherwise it is considered as lost. The amount of energy that was exported and can be taken back by the user is subtracted by 20% for installations up to 10 kW, or by 30% for installations up to 50 kW. This legislation guarantees that this net metering policy will be kept for a minimum of 15 years from the moment of registering renewable energy source. This legislation together with government subsidies for microgeneration created a substantial boost in installations of PV systems in Poland.

Portugal has a very limited form of &quot;net-metering&quot; that is constrained to 15 minute periods where the excess injected in the grid is not compensated when above the consumption from the grid within each 15 minute period. Only the injected energy up to the consumed energy within the same 15 minute period is netted out of the final monthly bill. In fact the old analog electricity meters that would allow for true net-metering are immediately replaced when a consumer installs solar pv.

=== India ===
Almost every state in India has implemented net-metering, wherein, the consumers are allowed to sell the surplus energy generated by their solar system to the grid and get compensated for the same. However, the net-metering policy is not common throughout the country and varies from state to state.

To avail of net-metering in the country, the consumer is required to submit an application with the local electricity distribution company along with the planned rooftop solar project and requisite fee. The distribution company reviews the application and the feasibility of the solar project, which is either approved or rejected. If approved, another application for registration of the rooftop is submitted to the distribution company. An agreement is signed between the consumer and the company, and the net-meter is installed.

The Indian states of Karnataka and Andhra Pradesh have started the implementation of net metering, and the policy was announced by the respective state electricity boards in 2014. After review and inspection by the electricity board, a bidirectional meter is installed. Applications are taken up for up to 30% of the distribution transformer capacity on a first-come, first-served basis and technical feasibility.

Since September 2015, Maharashtra state (MERC) has also had a net metering policy and consumers have started installation of Solar Rooftop Grid Tie Net metering systems. MERC Policy allows up to 40% transformer capacity to be on Solar net metering.

The various DISCOMs in Maharashtra namely MSEDCL, Tata, Reliance and Torrent Power are expected to support net metering.

As of now MSEDCL does not use the TOD (Time of The Day differential) charging tariffs for residential consumers and net metering. Export and import units are considered at par for calculating Net Units and bill amount.

=== United States ===
== Net purchase and sale ==
Net purchase and sale is a different method of providing power to the electricity grid that does not offer the price symmetry of net metering, making this system a lot less profitable for home users of small renewable electricity systems.

Under this arrangement, two uni-directional meters are installed—one records electricity drawn from the grid, and the other records excess electricity generated and fed back into the grid. The user pays retail rate for the electricity they use, and the power provider purchases their excess generation at its avoided cost (wholesale rate). There may be a significant difference between the retail rate the user pays and the power provider&#x27;s avoided cost.

Some countries, such as Germany, Spain, Ontario (Canada), and some states in the United States, compensate the generated electricity at a fixed rate, in a scheme called feed-in tariff (FIT). With the FIT, customers get paid for any electricity they generate from renewable energy on their premises. The actual electricity being generated is counted on a separate meter, not just the surplus they feed back to the grid. Germany once paid several times the retail rate for solar but has reduced the rates drastically while actual installation of solar has grown exponentially at the same time due to reduced cost of solar installations. Wind energy, in contrast, only receives around a half of the domestic retail rate, because the German system pays what each source costs (including a reasonable profit margin).

== Virtual net metering ==
Another method of producing power to the grid is through virtual net metering (also called peer-to-peer (P2P) energy trading, wheeling and sometimes local energy trading). Peer-to-peer energy trading is a novel paradigm of power system operation, where sellers can generate their own energy in dwellings, offices and factories, and share it with each other locally. Several companies offering virtual net metering use blockchain technology.

== Related technology ==
Sources that produce direct current, such as solar panels, must be coupled with an electrical inverter to convert the output to alternating current for use with conventional appliances. The phase of the outgoing power must be synchronized with the grid, and a mechanism must be included to disconnect the feed in the event of grid failure. This is for safety for example, workers repairing downed power lines must be protected from &quot;downstream&quot; sources, in addition to being disconnected from the main &quot;upstream&quot; distribution grid. Although a small generator lacks the power to energize a loaded line, this can happen if the line is isolated from other loads. Solar inverters are designed for safety while one inverter could not energize a line, a thousand might. In addition, electrical workers are trained to treat every line as though it was live, even when they know it should be safe.

== Solar guerrilla ==
Solar guerrilla (or the &quot;guerrilla solar movement&quot;) is a term originated by &quot;Home Power Magazine&quot; and is applied to someone who connects solar panels without permission or notification and uses monthly net metering without regard for law.

<text>The Soviet Navy was the naval warfare uniform service branch of the Soviet Armed Forces. Often referred to as the Red Fleet, the Soviet Navy made up a large part of the Soviet Union&#x27;s strategic planning in the event of a conflict with the opposing superpower, the United States, during the Cold War (1945–1991). The Soviet Navy played a large role during the Cold War, either confronting the North Atlantic Treaty Organization in western Europe or power projection to maintain its sphere of influence in eastern Europe.

The Soviet Navy was divided into four major fleets: the Northern, Pacific, Black Sea, and Baltic Fleets, in addition to the Leningrad Naval Base, which was commanded separately. It also had a smaller force, the Caspian Flotilla, which operated in the Caspian Sea and was followed by a larger fleet, the 5th Squadron, in the Mediterranean Sea. The Soviet Navy included Naval Aviation, Naval Infantry, and the Coastal Artillery.

The Soviet Navy was formed from the remnants of the Imperial Russian Navy during the Russian Civil War. After the dissolution of the Soviet Union in 1991, the Russian Federation inherited the largest part of the Soviet Navy and reformed it into the Russian Navy, with smaller parts becoming the basis for navies of the newly independent post-Soviet states.

==Early history==

===Russian Civil War (1917–1922)===
The Soviet Navy was based on a republican naval force formed from the remnants of the Imperial Russian Navy, which had been almost completely destroyed in the two Revolutions of 1917 (February and October/November) during World War I (1914–1918), the following Russian Civil War (1917–1922), and the Kronstadt rebellion in 1921. During the revolutionary period, Russian sailors deserted their ships at will and generally neglected their duties. The officers were dispersed (some were killed by the Red Terror, some joined the &quot;White&quot; (anti-communist) opposing armies, and others simply resigned) and most of the sailors walked off and left their ships. Work stopped in the shipyards, where uncompleted ships deteriorated rapidly.

The Black Sea Fleet fared no better than the Baltic. The Bolshevik (Communist) revolution entirely disrupted its personnel, with mass murders of officers; the ships were allowed to decay to unserviceability. At the end of April 1918, Imperial German troops moved along the Black Sea coast and entered Crimea and started to advance towards the Sevastopol naval base. The more effective ships were moved from Sevastopol to Novorossiysk where, after an ultimatum from Germany, they were scuttled by Vladimir Lenin&#x27;s order.

The ships remaining in Sevastopol were captured by the Germans and then, after the later Armistice of 11 November 1918 on the Western Front which ended the War, additional Russian ships were confiscated by the British. On 1 April 1919, during the ensuing Russian Civil War when Red Army forces captured Crimea, the British Royal Navy squadron had to withdraw, but before leaving they damaged all the remaining battleships and sank thirteen new submarines.

When the opposing Czarist White Army captured Crimea in 1919, it rescued and reconditioned a few units. At the end of the civil war, Wrangel&#x27;s fleet, a White flotilla, moved south through the Black Sea, Dardanelles straits and the Aegean Sea to the Mediterranean Sea to Bizerta in French Tunisia on the North Africa coast, where it was interned.

The first ship of the revolutionary navy could be considered the rebellious Imperial Russian cruiser , built 1900, whose crew joined the communist Bolsheviks. Sailors of the Baltic fleet supplied the fighting force of the Bolsheviks led by Vladimir Lenin and Leon Trotsky during the October Revolution of November 1917 against the democratic provisional government of Alexander Kerensky established after the earlier first revolution of February against the Czar. Some imperial vessels continued to serve after the revolution, albeit with different names.

The Soviet Navy, established as the &quot;Workers&#x27; and Peasants&#x27; Red Fleet&quot; by a 1918 decree of the new Council of People&#x27;s Commissars, installed as a temporary Russian revolutionary government, was less than service-ready during the interwar years of 1918 to 1941.

As the country&#x27;s attentions were largely directed internally, the Navy did not have much funding or training. An indicator of its reputation was that the Soviets were not invited to participate in negotiations for the Washington Naval Treaty of 1921–1922, which limited the size and capabilities of the most powerful navies – British,
American, Japanese, French, Italian. The greater part of the old fleet was sold by the Soviet government to post-war Germany for scrap.

In the Baltic Sea there remained only three much-neglected battleships, two cruisers, some ten destroyers, and a few submarines. Despite this state of affairs, the Baltic Fleet remained a significant naval formation, and the Black Sea Fleet also provided a basis for expansion. There also existed some thirty minor-waterways combat flotillas.

===Interwar period (1922–1941)===
During the 1930s, as the industrialization of the Soviet Union proceeded, plans were made to expand the Soviet Navy into one of the most powerful in the world. Approved by the Labour and Defence Council in 1926, the Naval Shipbuilding Program included plans to construct twelve submarines; the first six were to become known as the . Beginning 4 November 1926, &quot;Technical Bureau Nº 4&quot; (formerly the Submarine Department, and still secret), under the leadership of B.M. Malinin, managed the submarine construction works at the Baltic Shipyard.

In subsequent years, 133 submarines were built to designs developed during Malinin&#x27;s management. Additional developments included the formation of the Pacific Fleet in 1932 and the Northern Fleet in 1933. The forces were to be built around a core of powerful s. This building program was only in its initial stages by the time the German invasion forced its suspension in 1941.

By the end of 1937, the biggest fleet was the Baltic Fleet based at Leningrad, with two battleships, one training cruiser, eight destroyers including one destroyer leader, five patrol ships, two minesweepers, and some more old minesweepers. The Black Sea Fleet at Sevastopol included one battleship, three cruisers, one training cruiser, five destroyers, two patrol ships, and four minesweepers. The Northern Fleet operating from the shores of Kola Bay and Polyarny was made up of three destroyers and three patrol ships, while the Pacific Fleet had two destroyers, transferred east in 1936, and six patrol ships assembled in the Far East.

The Soviet Navy had some minor action in the Winter War against Finland in 1939–1940, on the Baltic Sea. It was limited mainly to cruisers and battleships fighting artillery duels with Finnish forts.

==World War II: The Great Patriotic War (1941–1945)==

Building a Soviet fleet was a national priority, but many senior officers were killed in the Great Purge in the late 1930s. The naval share of the national armaments budget fell from 11.5% in 1941 to 6.6% in 1944.

When the Soviet Union entered the Second World War, during Operation Barbarossa in June 1941, initially millions of soldiers were captured, many sailors and naval guns were detached to reinforce the Red Army; these reassigned naval forces had especially significant roles on land in the battles for Odessa, Sevastopol, Stalingrad, Novorossiysk, Tuapse, and Leningrad. The Baltic fleet was blockaded in Leningrad and Kronstadt by minefields, but the submarines escaped. The surface fleet fought with the anti-aircraft defence of the city and bombarded German positions.
The composition of the Soviet fleets in 1941 included:
* 3 battleships,
* 7 cruisers 
* 59 destroyers (including 46 modern and destroyers),
* 218 submarines,
* 269 torpedo boats,
* 22 patrol vessels,
* 88 minesweepers,
* 77 submarine chasers,
* and a range of other smaller vessels.
In various stages of completion were another 219 vessels including 3 battleships, 2 heavy and 7 light cruisers, 45 destroyers, and 91 submarines.

Included in the totals above are some pre-World War I ships (-class destroyers, some of the cruisers, and all the battleships), some modern ships built in the USSR and Europe (like the Italian-built destroyer and the partially completed German cruiser &quot;Lützow&quot;). During the war, many of the vessels on the slips in Leningrad and Nikolayev were destroyed (mainly by aircraft and mines), but the Soviet Navy received captured Romanian destroyers and Lend-Lease small craft from the U.S., as well as the old Royal Navy battleship (renamed &quot;Arkhangelsk&quot;) and the United States Navy cruiser (renamed &quot;Murmansk&quot;) in exchange for the Soviet part of the captured Italian navy.
In the Baltic Sea, after Tallinn&#x27;s capture, surface ships were blockaded in Leningrad and Kronstadt by minefields, where they participated with the anti-aircraft defence of the city and bombarded German positions. One example of Soviet resourcefulness was the battleship , an ageing pre-World War I ship sunk at anchor in Kronstadt&#x27;s harbour by German Junkers Ju 87 aircraft in 1941. For the rest of the war, the non-submerged part of the ship remained in use as a grounded battery. Submarines, although suffering great losses due to German and Finnish anti-submarine actions, had a major role in the war at sea by disrupting Axis navigation in the Baltic Sea.

In the Black Sea, many ships were damaged by minefields and Axis aviation, but they helped defend naval bases and supply them while besieged, as well as later evacuating them. Heavy naval guns and sailors helped defend port cities during long sieges by Axis armies. In the Arctic Ocean, Soviet Northern Fleet destroyers (&quot;Novik&quot; class, Type 7, and Type 7U) and smaller craft participated with the anti-aircraft and anti-submarine defence of Allied convoys conducting Lend-Lease cargo shipping. In the Pacific Ocean, the Soviet Union was not at war with Japan before 1945, so some destroyers were transferred to the Northern Fleet.

From the beginning of hostilities, Soviet Naval Aviation provided air support to naval and land operations involving the Soviet Navy. This service was responsible for the operation of shore-based floatplanes, long-range flying boats, catapult-launched and vessel-based planes, and land-based aircraft designated for naval use.

As post-war spoils, the Soviets received several Italian and Japanese warships and much German naval engineering and architectural documentation.

==Cold War (1945–1991)==
In February 1946, the Red Fleet was renamed and became known as the Soviet Navy (). After the war, the Soviets concluded that they needed a navy that could disrupt supply lines, and display a small naval presence to the developing world. As the natural resources the Soviet Union needed were available on the Eurasian landmass, it did not need a navy to protect a large commercial fleet, as the western navies were configured to do. Later, countering seaborne nuclear delivery systems became another significant objective of the navy, and an impetus for expansion.

The Soviet Navy was structured around submarines and small, maneuverable, tactical vessels. The Soviet shipbuilding program kept yards busy constructing submarines based upon World War II German &quot;Kriegsmarine&quot; designs, which were launched with great frequency during the immediate post-war years. Afterwards, through a combination of indigenous research and technology obtained through espionage from Nazi Germany and the Western nations, the Soviets gradually improved their submarine designs.

The Soviets were quick to equip their surface fleet with missiles of various sorts. Indeed, it became a feature of Soviet design to place large missiles onto relatively small, but fast, missile boats, while in the West such an approach would never have been considered tactically feasible. The Soviet Navy did also possess several very large and well-armed guided-missile cruisers, like those of the and classes. By the 1970s, Soviet submarine technology was in some respects more advanced than in the West, and several of their submarine types were considered superior to their American rivals.

The 5th Operational Squadron (:ru:5-я Средиземноморская эскадра кораблей ВМФ) operated in the Mediterranean Sea. The squadron&#x27;s main function was to prevent largescale naval ingress into the Black Sea, which could bypass the need for any invasion to be over the Eurasian land mass. The flagship of the squadron was for a long period the &quot;Zhdanov&quot;.

===Carriers and aviation===

In the strategic planning laid by the Soviet strategists, the aircraft carriers were seen as relatively unimportant and received little attention, as Moscow focused on a naval strategy designed to disrupt sea lines of communication. Nonetheless, the Soviet navy pursued an aircraft carrier program as a way of matching stoking competition with the U.S. Navy.

The Soviet Navy still had the mission of confronting Western submarines, creating a need for large surface vessels to carry anti-submarine helicopters. During 1968 and 1969 the s were first deployed, succeeded by the first of four aircraft-carrying cruisers of the , in 1973. Both types were capable of operating ASW helicopters, and the &quot;Kiev&quot; class also operated V/STOL aircraft (&quot;e.g.&quot;, the Yak-38 &#x27;Forger&#x27;); they were designed to operate for fleet defense, primarily within range of land-based Soviet Naval Aviation aircraft.

During the 1970s the Soviets began Project 1153 Orel (Eagle), whose stated purpose was to create an aircraft carrier capable of basing fixed-wing fighter aircraft in defense of the deployed fleet. The project was canceled during the planning stages when strategic priorities shifted once more.

In 1981, the Soviet Navy ordered its first true aircraft carrier, &quot;Tbilisi&quot;, subsequently renamed &quot;Admiral of the Fleet of the Soviet Union Kuznetsov&quot;, which carries Sukhoi Su-33 &#x27;Flanker-D&#x27; and MiG-29 fighters, as well as Ka-27 helicopters.

A distinctive feature of Soviet aircraft carriers has been their offensive missile armament (as well as long-range anti-aircraft warfare armament), again representing a fleet-defense operational concept, in distinction to the Western emphasis on shore-strike missions from distant deployment. A second carrier (pre-commissioning name &quot;Varyag&quot;) was under construction when the Soviet Union disintegrated in 1991. Construction stopped and the ship was sold later, incomplete, to the People&#x27;s Republic of China by Ukraine, which inherited part of the old Soviet fleet after the break-up of the USSR. It was commissioned into the People&#x27;s Liberation Army Navy in 2012 as the .

Soon after the launch of this second &quot;Kuznetsov&quot;-class ship, the Soviet Navy began the construction of an improved aircraft carrier design, , which was to have been slightly larger than the &quot;Kuznetsov&quot; class and nuclear-powered. The project was terminated, and what little structure had been initiated in the building ways was scrapped.

In part to perform the functions usual to carrier-borne aircraft, the Soviet Navy deployed large numbers of strategic bombers in a maritime role, with the &quot;Aviatsiya Voenno-Morskogo Flota&quot; (AV-MF, or Naval Aviation service). Strategic bombers like the Tupolev Tu-16 &#x27;Badger&#x27; and Tu-22M &#x27;Backfire&#x27; were deployed with high-speed anti-shipping missiles. Previously believed to be interceptors of NATO supply convoys traveling the sea lines of communication across the North Atlantic Ocean between Europe and North America, the primary role of these aircraft was to protect the Soviet mainland from attacks by U.S. carrier task forces.

===Submarines===
Due to the Soviet Union&#x27;s geographic position, submarines were considered the capital ships of the Navy. Submarines could penetrate attempts at blockade, either in the constrained waters of the Baltic and Black Seas or in the remote reaches of the USSR&#x27;s western Arctic, while surface ships were clearly much easier to find and attack. The USSR had entered the Second World War with more submarines than Germany, but geography and the speed of the German attack precluded it from effectively using its more numerous fleet to its advantage. Because of its opinion that &quot;quantity had a quality of its own&quot; and at the insistence of Admiral of the Fleet Sergey Gorshkov, the Soviet Navy continued to operate many first-generation missile submarines, built in the early 1960s, until the end of the Cold War in 1991.

In some respects, including speed and reactor technology, Soviet submarines achieved unique successes, but for most of the era lagged their Western counterparts in overall capability. In addition to their relatively high speeds and great operating depths they were difficult anti-submarine warfare (ASW) targets to destroy because of their multiple compartments, their large reserve buoyancy, and especially their double-hulled design.

Their principal shortcomings were insufficient noise-damping (American boats were quieter) and primitive sonar technology. Acoustics was a particularly interesting type of information that the Soviets sought about the West&#x27;s submarine-production methods, and the long-active John Anthony Walker spy ring may have made a major contribution to their knowledge of such.

The Soviet Navy possessed numerous purpose-built guided missile submarines, such as the , as well as many ballistic missile and attack submarines; their are the world&#x27;s largest submarines. While Western navies assumed that the Soviet attack submarine force was designed for interception of NATO convoys, the Soviet leadership never prepared their submarines for such a mission. 
Over the years Soviet submarines suffered a number of accidents, most notably on several nuclear boats. The most famous incidents include the , and the &quot;Komsomolets&quot;, both lost to fire, and the far more menacing nuclear reactor leak on the , narrowly averted by her captain. Inadequate nuclear safety, poor damage control, and quality-control issues during construction (particularly on the earlier submarines) were typical causes of accidents. On several occasions there were alleged collisions with American submarines. None of these, however, has been confirmed officially by the U.S. Navy. On 28 August 1976, &quot;K-22&quot; (Echo II) collided with frigate in the Mediterranean Sea.

===Transition===
After the dissolution of the USSR and the end of the Cold War, the Soviet Navy, like other branches of Armed Forces, eventually lost some of its units to former Soviet Republics, and was left without funding. Some ships were transferred to former Soviet states:
* Baltic Sea: Estonian Navy, Latvian Navy and Lithuanian Navy. All three countries joined NATO in 2004.
* Black Sea: Ukrainian Navy and Georgian Navy. The Georgian Navy was defeated by the Russian Navy at the battle off Abkhazia in 2008. Most of the Ukrainian Navy ships were captured back during the annexation of Crimea by the Russian Federation in 2014.
* Caspian Sea: Azerbaijani Navy, Kazakh Navy and Turkmen Navy.

===Soviet Naval Aviation===

The regular Soviet naval aviation units were created in 1918. They participated in the Russian Civil War, cooperating with the ships and the army during the combats at Petrograd, on the Baltic Sea, the Black Sea, the Volga, the Kama River, Northern Dvina and on the Lake Onega. The newborn Soviet Naval Air Force consisted of only 76 obsolete hydroplanes. Scanty and technically imperfect, it was mostly used for resupplying the ships and the army.

In the second half of the 1920s, the Naval Aviation order of battle began to grow. It received new reconnaissance hydroplanes, bombers, and fighters. In the mid-1930s, the Soviets created the Naval Air Force in the Baltic Fleet, the Black Sea Fleet and the Soviet Pacific Fleet. The importance of naval aviation had grown significantly by 1938–1940, to become one of the main components of the Soviet Navy. By this time, the Soviets had created formations and units of the torpedo and bomb aviation.

===Soviet Marines===

During World War II, about 350,000 Soviet sailors fought on land. At the beginning of the war, the navy had only one naval brigade in the Baltic fleet, but began forming and training other battalions. These eventually were:
* 6 naval infantry regiments (650 marines in two battalions)
* 40 naval infantry brigades of 5–10 battalions, formed from surplus ships&#x27; crews. Five brigades were awarded &quot;Gvardy&quot; (Guards) status.
* Numerous smaller units
* 1 division – the 55th Naval Infantry Division, formerly a Red Army formation

The military situation demanded the deployment of large numbers of marines on land fronts, so the Naval Infantry contributed to the defense of Moscow, Leningrad, Odessa, Sevastopol, Stalingrad, Novorossiysk, and Kerch. The Naval Infantry conducted over 114 landings, most of which were carried out by platoons and companies. In general, however, Naval Infantry served as regular infantry, without any amphibious training.

They conducted four major operations: two during the Battle of the Kerch Peninsula, one during the Caucasus Campaign and one as part of the Landing at Moonsund, in the Baltic. During the war, five brigades and two battalions of naval infantry were awarded Guards status. Nine brigades and six battalions were awarded decorations, and many were given honorary titles. The title Hero of the Soviet Union was bestowed on 122 members of naval infantry units.

The Soviet experience in amphibious warfare in World War II contributed to the development of Soviet combined arms operations. Many members of the Naval Infantry were parachute trained, conducting more drops and successful parachute operations than the Soviet Airborne Troops (VDV).

The Naval Infantry was disbanded in 1947, with some units being transferred to the Coastal Defence Forces.


In 1961, the Naval Infantry was re-formed and became one of the active combat services of the Navy. Each Fleet was assigned a Marine unit of regiment (and later brigade) size. The Naval Infantry received amphibious versions of standard Armoured fighting vehicle, including tanks used by the Soviet Army.

By 1989, the Naval Infantry numbered 18,000 marines, organized into a Marine Division and 4 independent Marine brigades;
* 55th Naval Infantry Division, at Vladivostok (Pacific Fleet)
* 61st Kirkenes Naval Infantry Brigade at Pechenga (Northern Fleet)
* 175th Naval Infantry Brigade, at Tumanny (Northern Fleet)
* 336th Guards Naval Infantry Brigade at Baltiysk (Baltic Fleet)
* 810th Naval Infantry Brigade, at Sevastopol (Black Sea Fleet)

By the end of the Cold War, the Soviet Navy had over eighty landing ships, as well as two s. The latter could transport one infantry battalion with 40 armoured vehicles and their landing craft. (One of the &quot;Rogov&quot; ships has since been retired.)

At 75 units, the Soviet Union had the world&#x27;s largest inventory of combat air-cushion assault craft. In addition, many of the 2,500 vessels of the Soviet merchant fleet (&quot;Morflot&quot;) could off-load weapons and supplies during amphibious landings.

On 18 November 1990, on the eve of the Paris Summit where the Conventional Armed Forces in Europe (CFE) Treaty and the Vienna Document on Confidence and Security-Building Measures (CSBMs) were signed, Soviet data was presented under the so-called initial data exchange. This showed a rather sudden emergence of three so-called coastal defence divisions (including the 3rd at Klaipėda in the Baltic Military District, the 126th in the Odessa Military District and seemingly the 77th Guards Motor Rifle Division with the Northern Fleet), along with three artillery brigades/regiments, subordinate to the Soviet Navy, which had previously been unknown as such to NATO.

Much of the equipment, which was commonly understood to be treaty limited (TLE) was declared to be part of the naval infantry. The Soviet argument was that the CFE excluded all naval forces, including its permanently land-based components. The Soviet Government eventually became convinced that its position could not be maintained.

A proclamation of the Soviet government on 14 July 1991, which was later adopted by its successor states, provided that all &quot;treaty-limited equipment&quot; (tanks, artillery, and armored vehicles) assigned to naval infantry or coastal defense forces, would count against the total treaty entitlement.

<text>The Sharif of Mecca () was the title of the leader of the Sharifate of Mecca, traditional steward of the Islamic holy cities of Mecca and Medina. The term &quot;sharif&quot; is Arabic for &quot;noble&quot;, &quot;highborn&quot;, and is used to describe the descendants of Hashim ibn Abd Manaf.

The Sharif was charged with protecting the cities and their environs and ensuring the safety of pilgrims performing the Hajj. The title is sometimes spelled Sheriff or Sherif, with the latter variant used, for example, by T. E. Lawrence in &quot;Seven Pillars of Wisdom&quot;.

The office of the Sharif of Mecca dates back to the late Abbasid era. Until 1200, the Sharifate was held by a member of the Hashim clan, not to be confused with the larger clan of Banu Hashim from which all Sharifs claim descent. Descendants of the Banu Hashim continued to hold the position until the 20th century on behalf of various Muslim powers including the Ayyubids and the Mamluks. In 1517, the Sharif acknowledged the supremacy of the Ottoman Caliph, but maintained a great degree of local autonomy. During the Ottoman era, the Sharifate expanded its authority northwards to include Medina, hitherto a sharifate of its own, and southwards to the frontiers of &#x27;Asir, and regularly raided Nejd.

The Sharifate came to an end shortly after the reign of Hussein bin Ali, who ruled from 1908, who rebelled against the Ottoman rule during the Arab Revolt of 1916. After the defeat of the Ottoman Empire in 1918 and its subsequent dissolution in 1923, Hussein formed the independent Kingdom of Hejaz and then declared himself Caliph. The British granted control over the newly formed states of Iraq and Transjordan to his sons Faisal and Abdullah. In 1924, however, in the face of increasing attacks by Ibn Saud, Hussein abdicated his political titles to his eldest son, Ali bin Hussein, who was to become the last Grand Sharif. At the end of 1925, Ibn Saud conquered the Hejaz and expelled the Hashemites. The House of Saud has ruled Mecca and Medina and overseen the Hajj (annual pilgrimage to Mecca) since that time.&lt;ref name=&quot;Ibn Saud reign of Hejaz – http://www.saudinf.com&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

<text>Sharīf or Sherif (, &#x27;noble&#x27;, &#x27;highborn&#x27;), also spelled shareef, feminine sharīfa (), plural ashrāf (), shurafāʾ (), or (in the Maghreb) shurfāʾ, is a title used to designate a person descended, or claiming to be descended, from the family of the Islamic prophet Muhammad ( ). It may be used in three senses:

#In the broadest sense, it refers to any descendant of Muhammad&#x27;s great-grandfather Hashim (the Banu Hashim or Hashimites, already in Muhammad&#x27;s day an established clan within the Meccan tribe of the Quraysh), including all descendants of Muhammad&#x27;s paternal uncles Abu Talib (the Talibids) and al-Abbas (the Abbasids).
#More often, it refers to a descendant of Ali, a son of Abu Talib and a paternal cousin of Muhammad (the Alids), especially but not exclusively through Ali&#x27;s marriage with Muhammad&#x27;s daughter Fatima (the Fatimids). In the sense of descendants of Fatima and Ali (the most common one), the term effectively refers to all descendants of Muhammad.
#In the narrowest sense, it refers only to someone who descends from Fatima and Ali&#x27;s eldest son (and Muhammad&#x27;s grandson) Hasan (the Hasanids). In this limited context, it is contrasted with the term (&#x27;lord&#x27;, &#x27;master&#x27;, plural , (), which then refers only to the descendants of Hasan&#x27;s younger brother Husayn (the Husaynids).

The precise usage of the term has varied both historically and geographically.

==Etymology==
The word derives from the Arabic root sh–r–f, which expresses meanings related to honor, nobility, and prominence. It has no etymological connection with the English term &quot;sheriff&quot;, which comes from the Old English word &quot;scīrgerefa&quot;, meaning &quot;shire-reeve&quot;, the local reeve (enforcement agent) of the king in the shire (county).

==Usage==
===History===
Precise usage of the term has varied both historically and geographically. Often, the terms and were used interchangeably, while in other contexts they referred to Hasanid vs. Husaynid descent (especially in the Hejaz, where the Sharifate of Mecca was restricted to persons of Hasanid descent). In still other contexts, they both referred to some form of Hashimite descent, but were linked to a different and specific social status.

In most places, the term has functioned as a mark of nobility (both the Abbasids and the Fatimids were at one time holder of the caliphate), except in South Asia, where the meaning of the term has expanded to include all Muslims of foreign descent. Thus, in the caste system among South Asian Muslims, the term designates not only Muslims of Arab descent (s or purported descendants of Ali and Fatima, and s, which include all those who claim descent from the Quraysh or from one of Muhammad&#x27;s companions), but also Muslims of Pasthun or Turko-Mongol (Mughal) descent.

Over time, people who were not of Hashimite descent were sometimes also granted the title as a general mark of nobility. The result of this has been that today the term has become a more common designation for those claiming descent from Muhammad. As such, (or one of its many alternative spellings, like or ) has also become a common proper name.

==Major sharif dynasties==

*Abbasids (descendants of Muhammad&#x27;s uncle Abbas ibn Abd al-Muttalib, ruled over a vast empire centered in Baghdad 750–945, and claimed the caliphate 750–1517)
*Idrisids (Hasanids, ruled over Morocco 789–985)
*Fatimids (Husaynids, ruled over a vast empire centered in Cairo and claimed the caliphate 909–1171)
*Sa&#x27;dids (Hasanids, ruled over Morocco 1510–1659)
*Alawids (Hasanids, rule over Morocco 1631–present)
*Hashimites (Hasanids, ruled over the Kingdom of Hejaz 1916–1925, the Arab Kingdom of Syria in 1920, the Kingdom of Iraq 1932–1958, and Jordan 1921–present)

<doc id="843067" wikidata="Q5002461" url="?curid=843067" title="Butcher paper">
<text>Butcher paper is a type of kraft paper originally sold to butchers for the purpose of wrapping meat and fish. It is now used for a wide variety of purposes, notably in primary education where it is used for arts and crafts, such as hanging artwork. Many high schools use butchers&#x27; paper for posters of clubs, and upcoming events. It is a cheap but sturdy paper that is sold in large rolls. Butcher paper is usually white or reddish in colour, made from kraft pulp, and is generally considered to have a density of between 30 lb/3000 sq ft (49 g/m2) and 50 lb/3000 sq ft (81 g/m2).

Moving companies use butcher paper to pack china, glass, and other fragile items for safe transport. The use of printed paper, such as newspaper, could transfer ink onto the packaged item causing damage.

<doc id="843070" wikidata="Q1130840" url="?curid=843070" title="Alan Warner (novelist)">
<text>Alan Warner (born 1964) is a Scottish novelist who grew up in Connel, near Oban. His novels include &quot;Morvern Callar&quot; and &quot;The Sopranos&quot; – the latter being the inspiration for the play &quot;Our Ladies of Perpetual Succour&quot; and its subsequent film adaptation, &quot;Our Ladies&quot;.

==Early life==
Warner&#x27;s father was a Yorkshireman who served in World War Two. His parents were in their forties when he was born, and ran a coal delivery business in Mull, a shop in Kilchoan, and a small hotel in Oban, before in 1963 buying the 42-bedroom Marine Hotel, close to Oban ferry terminal.

He attended Oban High School, and his interest in reading was sparked when he was fifteen, after he bought three novels whose covers suggested stories with a sexual dimension: Charles Webb&#x27;s &quot;The Graduate&quot;, André Gide&#x27;s &quot;The Immoralist&quot; and Albert Camus&#x27; &quot;The Outsider&quot;. He explained in an interview with the &quot;Scottish Review of Books&quot; in 2011: &quot;I had presumed novels were an art form which only happened elsewhere and had died out in Scotland around the time of Walter Scott. What a very curious but genuine assumption. On the other hand, I could argue this was because local bookshops were stuffed with Scott and not a single work of modern Scottish literature.&quot;

After moving to London, he studied at Ealing College. On his return to Scotland, he studied at Glasgow University, where he wrote a dissertation on Joseph Conrad and the theme of suicide. He then spent some time participating in the Spanish rave scene, before working in Scotland as a train driver&#x27;s assistant, musician and barman.

==Novels and other fiction==
Warner&#x27;s debut novel, the acclaimed &quot;Morvern Callar&quot; (1995), won a Somerset Maugham Award. It was followed by &quot;These Demented Lands&quot; (1997), which won the Encore Award. His third novel &quot;The Sopranos&quot; (1998) won the Saltire Society&#x27;s Scottish Book of the Year Award.

Since then he has published &quot;The Man Who Walks&quot; (2002), an imaginative and surreal black comedy; &quot;The Worms Can Carry Me to Heaven&quot; (2006), which imagines the reminiscences of a sickly Spanish playboy;&quot;The Stars in the Bright Sky&quot; (2010), a sequel to &quot;The Sopranos&quot;; &quot;The Deadman&#x27;s Pedal&quot; (2012), a coming-of-age novel set in 1973-4; &quot;Their Lips Talk of Mischief&quot; (2015), a comedy about two aspiring writers in Thatcher&#x27;s Britain; and &quot;Kitchenly 434&quot; (2021), a comedic satire set in the 1970s about a British rock star and the caretaker of his country house retreat. 

His novella &#x27;After the Vision&#x27; appeared in the anthology &quot;Children of Albion Rovers&quot; (1997), and his short story &#x27;Bitter Salvage&#x27; was included in &quot;Disco Biscuits&quot; (1997), an anthology edited by Sarah Champion.

==Adaptations of his work==
&quot;Morvern Callar&quot; has been adapted as a film, directed by Lynne Ramsay. &quot;The Sopranos&quot; has been adapted for the screen by Alan Sharp and Michael Caton-Jones. Released under the title &quot;Our Ladies&quot; in 2019, it was directed by Caton-Jones.

A play by Lee Hall, &quot;Our Ladies of Perpetual Succour&quot;, was based on &quot;The Sopranos&quot; and premiered in 2015, directed by Vicky Featherstone and featuring live songs.

==Acclaim and awards==
Warner&#x27;s first three novels all won awards, notably a Somerset Maugham Award. In 2003, he was named by &quot;Granta&quot; magazine as one of twenty &#x27;Best of Young British Novelists&#x27;. In 2010, his novel &quot;The Stars in the Bright Sky&quot; was included in the longlist for the Man Booker Prize. In 2013, he was awarded the James Tait Black Memorial Prize for his novel &quot;The Deadman&#x27;s Pedal&quot;.

==Recurring themes and motifs==
Alan Warner&#x27;s novels are mostly set in &quot;The Port&quot;, a place bearing some resemblance to Oban. He is known to appreciate the 1970s Krautrock band Can; three of his books feature dedications to former band members (&quot;Morvern Callar&quot; to Holger Czukay,&quot;The Man Who Walks&quot; to Michael Karoli and &quot;Kitchenly 434&quot; to Irmin Schmidt), and Warner has published a book about their album &quot;Tago Mago&quot;.

==Personal life and teaching career==
Warner currently splits his time between Scotland and Javea, Spain. In 2019 he was appointed the Writer-in-Residence at the University of Edinburgh in 2016. In 2019, he became senior lecturer in creative writing at the University of Aberdeen.

He was a member of the jury for the 2016 Scotiabank Giller Prize.

<text>The Indian numbering system is used in Indian English and the Indian subcontinent to express large numbers. Commonly used quantities include &quot;lakh&quot; (one hundred thousand) and &quot;crore&quot; (ten million) written as 1,00,000 and 1,00,00,000 respectively in some locales. For example: 150,000 rupees is &quot;1.5 &quot;lakh&quot; rupees&quot; which can be written as &quot;1,50,000 rupees&quot;, and 30,000,000 (thirty million) rupees is referred to as &quot;3 &quot;crore&quot; rupees&quot; which can be written as &quot;3,00,00,000 rupees&quot;.

There are names for numbers larger than &quot;crore&quot;, but they are less commonly used. These include &quot;arab&quot; (100 &quot;crore&quot;, 1 billion), &quot;kharab&quot; (100 &quot;arab&quot;, 100 billion), &quot;nil&quot; or sometimes transliterated as &quot;neel&quot; (100 kharab, 10 trillion), &quot;padma&quot; (100 nil, 1 quadrillion), &quot;shankh&quot; (100 padma, 100 quadrillion), and &quot;mahashankh&quot; (100 shankh, 10 quintillion). In common parlance (though inconsistent), the &quot;lakh&quot; and &quot;crore&quot; terminology repeats for larger numbers. Thus &quot;lakh crore&quot; is 1 trillion.

In the ancient Indian system, still in use in regional languages of India, there are words for (1062). These names respectively starting at 1000 are &quot;sahasra&quot;, &quot;ayuta&quot;, &quot;laksha&quot;, &quot;niyuta&quot;, &quot;koti&quot;, &quot;arbhudha&quot;, &quot;abhja&quot;, &quot;karva&quot;, &quot;nikarva&quot;, &quot;mahapadma&quot;, &quot;shanmkhu&quot;, &quot;jaladhi&quot;, &quot;amtya&quot;, &quot;madhya&quot;, &quot;paraardha&quot;. In the Indian system, now prevalent in the northern parts, the next powers of ten are one &quot;lakh&quot;, ten &quot;lakh&quot;, one &quot;crore&quot;, ten &quot;crore&quot;, one &quot;arab&quot; (or one hundred &quot;crore&quot;), and so on.

==Multiples==

The Indian system is decimal (base-10), same as in the West, and the first five orders of magnitude are named in a similar way: one (100), ten (101), one hundred (102), one thousand (103), and ten thousand (104). For higher powers of ten, naming diverges. The Indian system uses names for every &quot;second&quot; power of ten: &quot;lakh&quot; (105), &quot;crore&quot; (107), &quot;arab&quot; (109), &quot;kharab&quot; (1011), etc. In the two Western systems, long and short scales, there are names for every &quot;third&quot; power of ten. The short scale uses million (106), billion (109), trillion (1012), etc.

==Decimal formatting==

The Indian system groups digits of a large decimal representation differently than the US and other English-speaking regions. The Indian system does group the first three digits to the left of the decimal point. But thereafter, groups by two digits to align with the naming of quantities at multiples of 100.

Like English and other locales, the Indian system uses a period as the decimal separator and the comma for grouping. Some Western numbering systems use a comma for decimal separator and a thin space or point to group digits.

==Pronunciation in English==
When speakers of indigenous Indian languages are speaking English, the pronunciations may be closer to their mother tongue; e.g. &quot;lakh&quot; and &quot;crore&quot; might be pronounced /lɑkʰ/, /kɑrɔːr/, respectively.

* lakh /lɑːkʰ/
* crore /kɹɔːɹ/ (or /kɹoʊɹ/ in American English)
* arab /ʌˈɾʌb/
* kharab /kʰʌˈɾʌb/

== Names of numbers ==
The table below includes the spelling and pronunciation of numbers in various Indian languages along with corresponding short scale names.


==Historic numbering systems==

===Numbering systems in Hindu epics===
There are various systems of numeration found in various ancient epic literature of India (&quot;itihasas&quot;). The following table gives one such system used in the Valmiki Ramayana.
=== Other numbering systems ===
The denominations by which land was measured in the Kumaon Kingdom were based on arable lands and thus followed an approximate system with local variations. The most common of these was a vigesimal (base-20) numbering system with the main denomination called a &quot;bisi&quot; (see Hindustani number &quot;bīs&quot;), which corresponded to the land required to sow 20 &quot;nalis&quot; of seed. Consequently, its actual land measure varied based on the quality of the soil. This system became the established norm in Kumaon by 1891.

==Usage in different languages==

Below is a list of translations for the words lakh and crore in other languages spoken in the Indian subcontinent:

Formal written publications in English in India tend to use lakh/crore for Indian currency and International numbering for foreign currencies.

== Current usage ==
The usage of this system is limited to the nations of Nepal, India, Pakistan, Bangladesh, and Myanmar. It is universally employed within these countries, and is preferred to the English numbering system.

Sri Lanka used this system in the past but has switched to the English numbering system in recent years.

In the Maldives, the term lakh is widely used in official documents and local speech. However, the Westernised Hindu-Arabic numeral system is preferred for higher denominations (such as millions).

Most institutions and citizens in India use the Indian number system. The Reserve Bank of India was noted as a rare exception in 2015, whereas by 2024 the Indian system was used for amounts in rupees and the Western system for foreign currencies throughout the Reserve Bank&#x27;s website.

<text>The Flemington Racecourse line is a commuter railway line in the city of Melbourne, Victoria, Australia. Operated by Metro Trains Melbourne, it is the city&#x27;s shortest metropolitan railway line at . The line runs from Flinders Street station in central Melbourne to Flemington Racecourse station, situated next to the racecourse in the city&#x27;s north west, serving a total of 5 stations. The line operates only during special events, with services as frequent as every 4 minutes during peak periods of those special events. Trains on the Flemington Racecourse line run with two three-car formations of Comeng, Siemens Nexas, or X&#x27;Trapolis 100 trainsets.

The Flemington Racecourse line originated in 1861 as a branch of the Melbourne and Essendon Railway Company, designed to link the Melbourne rail network with Flemington Racecourse. The racecourse, established in 1840, gained its railway connection in 1861 but closed in 1864 due to financial issues. The Victorian Railways took over and reopened the line in 1867. Notably, the line was electrified in 1918, making it Melbourne&#x27;s first electrified route. Automatic signalling was introduced in 1919, though the connection between points and signals ceased in the 1980s or 1990s with the closure of sidings.

Since the 2010s, only minor upgrades have taken place, including upgrades of signalling, the replacement of sleepers, and station accessibility upgrades.

== History ==

=== 19th century ===
The Flemington Racecourse line opened as a branch from Newmarket by the Melbourne and Essendon Railway Company in February 1861. The line was constructed to connect the Melbourne rail network with Flemington Racecourse, the main horse racing facility in Melbourne. The racecourse was originally opened in 1840 and received its rail connection 21 years later in 1861. Three years later, in July 1864, the line was closed after the company faced financial difficulties. The line was taken over by the Victorian Railways and reopened in November 1867.

=== 20th century ===
The line was electrified in 1918 for the testing of electric trains, and therefore became the first electrified line in Melbourne. The first electric train ran a test trip from Newmarket to Flemington Racecourse station on 6 October 1918.

Automatic signalling, using two-position signals, was provided in September 1919. When passenger services were operated on the line, the points were connected to the signal boxes and the signals were brought into use. This arrangement finished in the 1980s or 1990s when the sidings were closed.

=== 21st century ===
During the 2017 Melbourne Cup, a group of activists drove onto and blocked the rail tracks in an effort to protest refugee detention centres on Manus Island. The disruption caused major delays on the line during its busiest period of the year, causing racegoers to exit the train with assistance from emergency services and walk along the tracks to access the racecourse.

== Network and operations ==

=== Services ===
Services on the Flemington Racecourse line operate only during special events, including during the Melbourne Cup, Oaks Day, the Royal Melbourne Show, university exams (at Victoria University located nearby), or any other large events. In general, during special events, train frequency is 4–60 minutes depending on the size of the crowd and the flow of passengers. As the line only operates during special events, services do not run 24 hours a day on Friday nights and weekends.

Train services on the Flemington Racecourse line are also subjected to maintenance and renewal works, usually when the line isn&#x27;t in use for special events. In the event that maintenance does need to occur during a special event, shuttle bus services are provided throughout the duration of works for affected commuters.

==== Stopping patterns ====

* | – Trains pass and do not stop
=== Operators ===
The Flemington Racecourse line has had a total of 7 operators since its opening in 1861. The majority of operations throughout its history have been government run: from the acquisition of the service from private operator Melbourne and Essendon Railway Company in 1867 until the 1998 privatisation of Melbourne&#x27;s rail network, four different government operators have run the line. These operators, Victorian Railways, the Metropolitan Transit Authority, the Public Transport Corporation, and Hillside Trains have a combined operational length of 133 years. Hillside Trains was privatised in 1999 and later rebranded Connex Melbourne. Metro Trains Melbourne, the current private operator, then took over the operations in 2009. Both private operators have had a combined operational period of years.
=== Route ===

The Flemington Racecourse line forms a mostly linear route from the Melbourne central business district to its terminus at Flemington Racecourse. The route is long and is fully double tracked. Exiting the city, the line only has minor earthworks, with some sections of the line being elevated or lowered into a cutting to eliminate level crossings. Despite some removals, there are a number of level crossings still present with no current plans to remove them.

The line follows the same alignment as multiple other lines, with the Flemington Racecourse line splitting off at North Melbourne. The Flemington Racecourse line continues on its western alignment, whereas the other lines continue onto a northern, western, or south-western alignment. Most of the rail line goes through built-up suburbs and event facilities.

=== Stations ===
The line serves 5 stations across of track. The stations are a mix of lowered and ground level designs.


== Infrastructure ==

=== Rolling stock ===
The Flemington Racecourse line uses three different types of electric multiple unit (EMU) trains that are operated in a split six-car configuration, with three doors per side on each carriage. The primary rolling stock featured on the line is the Comeng EMUs, built by Commonwealth Engineering between 1981 and 1988. Siemens Nexas EMUs are also widely featured on the line, originally built between 2002 and 2005. These train sets feature more modern technology than the Comeng trains. The final type of rolling stock featured on the line is the X&#x27;Trapolis 100 built by Alstom between 2002 and 2004, and 2009 and 2020. All of these rolling stock models are widely used on other lines across the metropolitan network and work as the backbone of the network. 

Alongside the passenger trains, Flemington Racecourse line tracks and equipment are maintained by a fleet of engineering trains. The four types of engineering trains are:

* The shunting train; designed for moving trains along non-electrified corridors and for transporting other maintenance locomotives
* For track evaluation; designed for evaluating track and its condition
* The overhead inspection train; designed for overhead wiring inspection
* The infrastructure evaluation carriage; designed for general infrastructure evaluation. 

Most of these trains are repurposed locomotives previously used by V/Line, Metro Trains, and the Southern Shorthaul Railroad.

==== Planned rolling stock ====
From the middle of 2020s, the next generation of the X&#x27;Trapolis family of electric EMUs—the X&#x27;Trapolis 2.0—will be introduced. This new model will fully replace the existing fleet of Comeng EMUs currently operating on the line currently with new, modern, and technologically advanced trains. The new trains will include features designed to increase passenger comfort like quicker doors, allowing for reduced boarding times, passenger information systems to display relevant information about the train and its journey, designated bicycle storage areas, and 6 cars that are fully walk through. For reliability, the trains have a higher energy efficiency to work with a lower network voltage. Finally, accessibility is improved through new interior designs featuring fold-up seating to allow additional space for wheelchair users and passenger operated automatic wheelchair ramps (located behind the two driver cabs).

=== Accessibility ===
In compliance with the Disability Discrimination Act of 1992, all stations that are new-built or rebuilt are fully accessible and comply with legal guidelines. Three of the five stations on the corridor are fully accessible, but the others have not been upgraded to meet these guidelines. These stations feature ramps with gradients greater than 1 in 14, the maximum slope for stations lacking at-grade paths or lifts. Fully accessible stations typically also feature tactile boarding indicators, independent boarding ramps, wheelchair accessible myki barriers, hearing loops, and widened paths.

Projects improving station accessibility have included individual station upgrade projects, which may include station rebuilds or upgrades. These works have made significant strides in improving network accessibility, with more than 60% of Flemington Racecourse line stations classed as fully accessible. Future station upgrade projects will continue to increase the number of fully accessible stations overtime.

=== Signalling ===
The Flemington Racecourse line uses three-position signalling, which is widely used across the Melbourne train network. Three-position signalling was first introduced in 1924, with the final section of the line converted to the new type of signalling 90 years later in 2014. The Flemington Racecourse line had Melbourne&#x27;s last remaining example of two-position automatic signalling, apart from a section of the Hurstbridge line between Greensborough and Hurstbridge stations.

<text>Reisbach is a small town, belonging to the district of Saarlouis in the Bundesland Saarland.

The village was formed on April 1, 1937, when the two townships of Reisweiler and Labach were joint together as &quot;Reisbach&quot;.

Reisweiler was first mentioned as &quot;Radisville&quot; in 1154. The Germanic name &quot;Radi&quot; means &quot;father of the town council&quot;, which, together with the &quot;-ville&quot; suffix meaning &quot;farmland&quot;, yields the meaning of &quot;Reisweiler&quot; as &quot;Radi&#x27;s Farmland&quot;.

The first written documentation about Labach stems from the 13th century, when it was known under the name &quot;Loupach&quot; or &quot;Loupbach&quot;. The name is composed from &quot;Loup&quot; meaning &quot;foliage&quot; (German &quot;Laub&quot;) and &quot;Bach&quot; meaning &quot;creek&quot;.

The name of the consolidated village thus means &quot;Radi&#x27;s Creek&quot;.

Since January 1, 1974, Reisbach has formed the municipality of Saarwellingen, together with Saarwellingen proper and Schwarzenholz with a combined 14,000 inhabitants.

==History==
In 1212, Count Heinrich of Zweibrücken gave his ownership of the villages Reisweiler and Labach to Fraulautern Abbey.

The knights Marsilius and Reiner and their relative Marsilius von Lisdorf donated their stake in the patronage to the church of Reisweiler in 1237.

Labach belonged to the lordship of Schwarzenholz, and thus Fraulautern Abbey, until 1792, when the French Revolution changed everything. It also ended the ownership of the Grafschaft Saarbrücken and the Lord of Hagen over Reisweiler.

==Coat of arms==
The coat of arms resembles the rulerships over the two villages: The base is the coat of arms of the Lords of Saarbrücken (Lisdorf), the diagonal bar, while the red and gold colors stem from the coat of arms of the Lords of Zweibrücken. The two fields formed by the diagonal bar stand for the two villages which form Reisbach: the upper field for Labach, with the crossed circle of Fraulautern Abbey; the lower field for Reisweiler, with the cross of the Lords of Bolchen.

Reisbach was given the right to bear a coat of arms on May 11, 1964.</text><links>

<doc id="843081" wikidata="Q4349906" url="?curid=843081" title="AIB (NI)">
<text>AIB (NI) (formerly known as First Trust Bank) is a commercial bank in Northern Ireland that is part of Allied Irish Banks&#x27;s UK subsidiary AIB Group (UK) plc. It is one of the Big Four banks in Ireland. The bank was created in 1991 when &quot;TSB Northern Ireland&quot; merged with the AIB Group&#x27;s other interests. The bank can trace its existence back to 1816 with the founding of the &quot;Belfast Savings Bank&quot;. The bank was one of the four banks that issued Pound Sterling banknotes in Northern Ireland until February 2019; First Trust notes are no longer legal currency since 30 June 2022. Allied Irish Banks confirmed plans to sell off the bank in April 2010 as part of plans to raise capital, however these plans were subsequently shelved and instead the bank announced investment plans starting in 2014. The bank traded as First Trust Bank in Northern Ireland until November 2019.

==Banking services==
Allied Irish Banks&#x27; UK division, with total assets of €15.1 billion (approx £10 billion), operates in two distinct markets, Northern Ireland and Great Britain (where it operates as Allied Irish Bank (GB)), with different economies and operating environments. AIB Group (UK) p.l.c., registered in the UK and regulated by the Financial Conduct Authority and the Prudential Regulation Authority, operates as the legal entity for the division.

==Banknotes==


In common with the other Big Four banks of Northern Ireland, First Trust Bank retained the right to issue its own banknotes, though production ceased on 30 June 2020. These are pound sterling notes backed by their value in Bank of England notes, and should not be confused with banknotes of the former Irish pound.

Earlier note issues by the bank were made under the bank&#x27;s previous names: the Provincial Bank of Ireland Ltd. (to 1976), Allied Irish Banks Ltd. (1977–1986), and Allied Irish Banks PLC (1987–1993).

First Trust Bank&#x27;s final issue of notes depicted two generic people, one male, one female. They appear as children on the £1 and £5 notes, as middle-aged on the £10 and £20, and finally as elderly on the £50 and £100. The obverse designs generally feature images associated with the Spanish Armada, commemorating the wrecking of 24 Armada ships off the coast of County Antrim in 1588:

* 10 pound note featuring the ship &quot;Girona&quot;
* 20 pound note featuring the chimney at Lacada Point, Giant&#x27;s Causeway, near Dunluce, County Antrim, where the Girona was wrecked.
* 50 pound note featuring a commemorative medal
* 100 pound note featuring the Spanish Armada

A £5 note featuring Dunluce Castle on the obverse and a £1 note also featuring the Girona were issued by the Provincial Bank of Ireland and by AIB, but have not been issued by First Trust Bank.

In February 2019, First Trust Bank ceased issuing its own banknotes in circulation and replaced them with Bank of England banknotes as they are withdrawn from circulation. First Trust Bank notes could continue to be used until 30 June 2022, after which time they ceased to be legal currency but can still be paid into bank accounts, or exchanged for Bank of England notes at branches of AIB (NI).

<doc id="843083" wikidata="Q389903" url="?curid=843083" title="Ban Kulin">
<text>Kulin (; d. November 1204) was the Ban of Bosnia from 1180 to 1204, first as a vassal of the Byzantine Empire and then of the Kingdom of Hungary, although his state was de facto independent. He was one of Bosnia&#x27;s most prominent and notable historic rulers and had a great effect on the development of early Bosnian history. One of his most noteworthy diplomatic achievements is widely considered to have been the signing of the Charter of Ban Kulin, which encouraged trade and established peaceful relations between Dubrovnik and his realm of Bosnia. His son, Stephen Kulinić succeeded him as Bosnian Ban. Kulin founded the House of Kulinić.

==Early life==
Kulin&#x27;s sister was married to Miroslav of Hum, the brother of Serbian Grand Prince Stefan Nemanja (r. 1166–1196). He belonged to the Bosnian nobility and was brought to the throne when the Byzantine Emperor Manuel I Komnenos (1143–1180) was the overlord of Bosnia. In 1180, when Komnenos died, Stefan Nemanja and Kulin asserted independence of Serbia and Bosnia, respectively.

==Reign==
His rule is often remembered as being emblematic of Bosnia&#x27;s golden age, and he is a common hero of Bosnian national folk tales. Under him, the &quot;Bosnian Age of Peace and Prosperity&quot; would come to exist. Bosnia was completely autonomous and mostly at peace during his rule.

===War against Byzantium===
In 1183, Kulin Ban led his troops with the forces of the Kingdom of Hungary under King Béla and the Serbs under Stefan Nemanja, who had just launched an attack on the Byzantine Empire. The cause of the war was Hungary&#x27;s non-recognition of the new emperor, Andronikos Komnenos. The united forces met little resistance in the eastern Serbian lands – the Byzantine squadrons were fighting among themselves as the local Byzantine commanders Alexios Brannes supported the new Emperor, while Andronikos Lapardes opposed him – and deserted the Imperial Army, going onto adventures on his own. Without difficulties, the Byzantines were pushed out of the Morava Valley and the allied forces breached all the way to Sofia, raiding Belgrade, Braničevo, Ravno, Niš and Sofia itself.

===Heresy===

In 1199, Serbian prince Vukan Nemanjić informed the Pope, Innocent, of heresy in Bosnia. Vukan claimed that Kulin, a heretic, had welcomed the heretics whom Bernard of Split had banished, and treated them as Christians. In 1200, the Pope wrote a letter to Kulin&#x27;s suzerain, the Hungarian King Emeric, warning him that &quot;no small number of Patarenes&quot; had gone from Split and Trogir to Ban Kulin where they were warmly welcomed, and told him to &quot;Go and ascertain the truth of these reports and if Kulin is unwilling to recant, drive him from your lands and confiscate his property&quot;. Kulin replied to the Pope that he did not regard the immigrants as heretics, but as Catholics, and that he was sending a few of them to Rome for examination, and also invited that a Papal representative be sent to investigate. Unconvinced, the Pope sent his legates to Bosnia to interrogate Kulin and his subjects about religion and life, and if indeed heretical, correct the situation through a prepared constitution. The Pope wrote to Bernard in 1202 that &quot;a multitude of people in Bosnia are suspected of the damnable heresy of the Cathars.&quot; The two legates sent by the Pope went through the country of Bosnia and interrogated the clergy.

====Bilino Polje abjuration====

Not only did Casamaris listen to his informants&#x27; answers, but where they were in error, he would have taught them correct doctrine, in line with Innocent&#x27;s directive. John must have convinced himself that he had fulfilled Innocent&#x27;s command to correct the krstjani, because the &quot;Confessio&quot; (Abjuration) signed at Bilino Polje by seven priors of the Krstjani church on 8 April 1203, makes no mention of errors. The same document was brought to Budapest, 30 April by Casamaris and Kulin and two abbots, where it was examined by the Hungarian King and the high clergy. Kulin&#x27;s son.
===Charter of Ban Kulin===

The Charter of Ban Kulin was a trade agreement between Bosnia and the Republic of Ragusa that effectively regulated Ragusan trade rights in Bosnia written on 29 August 1189. It is one of the oldest written state documents in the Balkans and is among the oldest historical documents written in Bosnian Cyrillic. The charter is of great significance in national pride and historical heritage of Bosnia.

===Death===
After his death in 1204, Ban Kulin was succeeded to the Bosnian throne by Stjepan, ban of Bosnia, often deemed his son.

==Marriage and children==
Kulin married Vojislava, with whom he had two sons:
*Stephen Kulinić, the following Ban of Bosnia
*A son that went with the Pope&#x27;s emissaries in 1203 to explain heresy accusations against Kulin
==Legacy and folklore==
As a founder of first de facto independent Bosnian state, Kulin was and still is highly regarded among Bosnians. Even today Kulin&#x27;s era is regarded as one of the most prosperous historical eras, not just for Bosnian medieval state and its feudal lords, but for the common people as well, whose lasting memory of those times is kept in Bosnian folklore, like an old folk proverb with significant meaning: &quot;Od kulina Bana i dobrijeh dana&quot; (&quot;&quot;).

Accordingly, in today&#x27;s Bosnia and Herzegovina, many streets and town squares, as well as cultural institutions, and non-governmental organizations, bear Kulin&#x27;s name, while numerous culturally significant events, manifestation, festivals and anniversaries are held in celebration of his life and deeds.

<text>Tony! Toni! Toné! is an American soul/R&amp;B band from Oakland, California, popular during the late 1980s and early to mid-1990s. During the band&#x27;s heyday, it was composed of D&#x27;Wayne Wiggins on lead vocals and guitar, his brother Raphael Saadiq (born Charles Ray Wiggins) on lead vocals and bass, and their cousin Timothy Christian Riley on drums, keyboards, and background vocals. Originally, the band went by &quot;Tony, Toni, Toné&quot; as a joke, until they realized it &quot;had a nice ring to it&quot;.

After their debut album &quot;Who?&quot; in 1988 followed by &quot;The Revival&quot; in 1990, the group achieved their greatest commercial success with the double platinum certified &quot;Sons of Soul&quot; in 1993. Tony! Toni! Toné! disbanded after the release of their fourth album &quot;House of Music&quot; (1996), which critics cite as their best work.

==History==
===1988–1992: &quot;Who?&quot; and &quot;The Revival&quot;===

Their debut album, &quot;Who?&quot;, produced and co-written by Denzil Foster and Thomas McElroy, was released in 1988. The first single &quot;Little Walter&quot; went to #1 on the R&amp;B charts. The next three singles, &quot;Born Not to Know&quot;, &quot;Baby Doll&quot; and &quot;For the Love of You&quot; were all Top 10 R&amp;B singles. &quot;Who?&quot; spent 44 weeks on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Top Pop Albums, peaking at number 69. On December 5, 1989, the album was certified gold by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA), for shipments of 500,000 copies in the United States. As of August 1993, it has sold over 700,000 copies in the US.

Inspired by live instrumentation, turntablism, and classic soul music, Tony! Toni! Toné! recorded and produced their second album, &quot;The Revival&quot;, mostly themselves and released it on May 8, 1990 to commercial success. &quot;The Revival&quot; charted for 64 weeks on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Top Pop Albums, peaking at number 34 on the chart and reaching platinum status. The album spawned several #1 R&amp;B hits with &quot;It Never Rains (In Southern California)&quot;, &quot;Feels Good&quot;, &quot;The Blues&quot;, and &quot;Whatever You Want&quot; all topping the R&amp;B charts. The album&#x27;s second single &quot;Feels Good&quot; was released on June 19 and certified gold on November 13 after it had shipped 500,000 copies. The single topped the R&amp;B chart for two weeks and reached number nine on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100 in the fall of 1990, going on to sell over one million copies. &quot;Feels Good&quot; was the group&#x27;s first single to breach the Top 10 of the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100. In late 1990, the album&#x27;s fourth single &quot;It Never Rains (In Southern California)&quot; became a number-one R&amp;B hit and also peaked at number 34 on the Hot 100.

&quot;The Revival&quot; broadened the group&#x27;s exposure to fans beyond their initial R&amp;B audience. However, they became ambivalent about their newfound mainstream success and their music being labeled &quot;retro&quot; by critics. In an interview for &quot;People&quot; magazine, lead singer and bassist Raphael Wiggins expressed his dissatisfaction with the music industry, saying that &quot;every record company wants to get a group and put &#x27;em in a Benz with a car phone and a beeper, show them dressing in three different outfits, put them in a video shot on a beach with lots of swinging bikinis. You won&#x27;t ever see us on a beach. We&#x27;re just down-to-earth, funky, like-to-play guys.&quot; Before considering a follow-up album, the band recorded several songs for film soundtracks, including &quot;Me and You&quot; for &quot;Boyz n the Hood&quot; (1991), &quot;House Party (I Don&#x27;t Know What You Come to Do)&quot; for &quot;House Party 2&quot; (1991), and &quot;Waiting on You&quot; for &quot;Poetic Justice&quot; (1993).

===1992–1995: &quot;Sons of Soul&quot;===
Having fulfilled their creative intentions with &quot;The Revival&quot;, Tony! Toni! Toné! wanted to pay homage to their musical influences with &quot;Sons of Soul&quot;. In a 1993 interview for &quot;The New York Times&quot;, Wiggins elaborated on their direction for the album, stating &quot;We&#x27;re paying homage to a lot of older artists who paved the way for us artists like the Temptations, Sly and the Family Stone, Earth, Wind and Fire. They&#x27;re the people who inspired us when we were growing up, people like Aretha Franklin, James Brown. We feel we&#x27;re the sons of everything and all those people who came before us.&quot; He also explained the album&#x27;s title as a declaration of them being descendants of those artists, &quot;not in a grandiose sense, but from the standpoint that we really are the musical offspring of all that&#x27;s come before us ... paying homage to our past, but creating in a contemporary environment.&quot;

Tony! Toni! Toné! took a hiatus as a group after the commercial and critical success of &quot;Sons of Soul&quot;. According to vocalist and bassist Raphael Wiggins, each member had pursued individual music projects, and &quot;the group was trying to figure out where everybody&#x27;s time, space and head was at.&quot; He, D&#x27;wayne Wiggins, and Timothy Christian Riley worked on songwriting and production for other recording artists during the band&#x27;s hiatus, including D&#x27;Angelo, En Vogue, Karyn White, Tevin Campbell, and A Tribe Called Quest. Raphael Wiggins adopted the surname &quot;Saadiq&quot; for his professional name in 1994—&quot;man of his word&quot; in Arabic—and released his solo single &quot;Ask of You&quot; in 1995. Their work outside the band led to rumors of a break-up during the time between albums. Tony! Toni! Toné! eventually regrouped and began recording &quot;House of Music&quot; in September 1995.

===1996–1998: &quot;House of Music&quot;===
In 1996, the group released their final studio album to date, &quot;House of Music&quot;. The album lacked the strong singles of earlier entries, only getting &quot;Thinking Of You&quot; &amp; &quot;Let&#x27;s Get Down&quot; into the top 10 on the R&amp;B charts, with &quot;Thinking Of You&quot; hitting #22 on the Hot 100, though it eventually reached platinum status.

&quot;House of Music&quot; expanded on Tony! Toni! Toné!&#x27;s previous traditional R&amp;B-influenced work by emphasizing live instrumentation and ballads. In the opinion of &quot;Daily Herald&quot; writer Dan Kening, the album continued the band&#x27;s mix of contemporary R&amp;B and old-fashioned soul, deeming it &quot;half a tribute to their &#x27;60s and &#x27;70s soul music roots and half a masterful blend of modern smooth balladeering and danceable funk.&quot; Released on November 19, 1996, &quot;House of Music&quot; reached number 32 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200 and spent 31 weeks on the chart. In its first eight weeks, the album sold 318,502 copies in the US. Tony! Toni! Toné! inaugurated its release with a satellite press conference and in-store performance at a small retail outlet in the San Francisco Bay Area. They also embarked on a tour of historically black colleges and Black Independent Coalition record shops after &quot;Let&#x27;s Get Down&quot; had been sent to R&amp;B and crossover radio on October 28 as the album&#x27;s lead single; its music video was released to outlets such as BET, The Box, and MTV. Tony! Toni! Toné! performed the song on the sketch comedy show &quot;All That&quot;; on the music variety program &quot;Soul Train&quot;, they performed &quot;Let&#x27;s Get Down&quot; and &quot;Annie May&quot;. &quot;Thinking of You&quot; was released as the second single on March 11, 1997, by which time &quot;House of Music&quot; had sold 514,000 copies, according to Nielsen SoundScan. On August 6, the album was certified Platinum by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA).

The single &quot;Me &amp; You&quot; appears on the soundtrack to the motion picture &quot;Boyz n the Hood&quot;. Following the release of &quot;Sons of Soul&quot;, the group was a part of the R&amp;B supergroup Black Men United, along with Silk and H-Town. The song &quot;U Will Know&quot; appeared on the soundtrack for the movie &quot;Jason&#x27;s Lyric&quot;.

=== Reunions ===
In 2003, members of Tony! Toni! Toné!, except for Saadiq, were invited by Alicia Keys to be guest artists on her album &quot;The Diary of Alicia Keys&quot;. The song that resulted from that session was called &quot;Diary.&quot; Released as a single in the fall of 2004, it gave them their first Top 10 US hit in eleven years and a nomination for Best R&amp;B Performance by a Duo or Group with Vocals at the 2005 Grammy Awards.

In 2023, the original lineup announced and engaged in a U.S. reunion tour, marking the band&#x27;s thirtieth anniversary of their third release, &quot;Sons of Soul&quot;, and their first tour in twenty-five years; that included their music catalogue and a few songs from Saadiq&#x27;s solo career and production/songwriting repertoire. Before the tour, the group talked about recording a new album, but as of September 2024, Raphael Saadiq revealed to Rolling Stone Now podcast that plans for another album have been canceled stating that the band members no longer feel the same about working on an album, and he doesn&#x27;t think there will be another reunion.

Around the same time, Saadiq became a much-sought-after R&amp;B producer, scoring hits for D&#x27;Angelo, Beyoncé, Total, The Roots, and others. Later in the 2000s, he started a solo career, releasing two albums: &quot;Instant Vintage&quot; (2002) and &quot;Ray Ray&quot; (2004). He was replaced by Amar Khalil in the band. Regarding changing his surname to &#x27;Saadiq&#x27; for a solo career, in February 2009 Raphael stated to writer Pete Lewis of &quot;Blues &amp; Soul&quot;: &quot;I just wanted to have my own identity&quot;.

Lucy Pearl was an R&amp;B supergroup formed in 1999 as the brainchild of Saadiq. The other members of Lucy Pearl were Dawn Robinson (En Vogue) and Ali Shaheed Muhammad (A Tribe Called Quest).

The new line-up released the track &quot;Without You&quot;. The group split up shortly afterwards, releasing no other material.

In 2005, D&#x27;wayne Wiggins became the bandleader for the &quot;Weekends at the D.L.&quot; television show hosted by comedian D. L. Hughley, which aired on the Comedy Central cable network until 2006. Wiggins solo album, &quot;Eyes Never Lie&quot;, sold approximately 150,000 units.

<doc id="843100" wikidata="Q1760520" url="?curid=843100" title="Khao Sok National Park">
<text>Khao Sok National Park (, ) is in Surat Thani Province, Thailand. Its area is 461,712 rai ~ , and it includes the Cheow Lan Lake contained by the Ratchaprapha Dam. The park is the largest area of virgin forest in southern Thailand and is a remnant of rain forest which is older and more diverse than the Amazon rainforest.

==Geography==
Sandstone and mudstone rocks rise about above sea level. The park is traversed by a limestone mountain range from north to south with a high point of . This mountain range is hit by monsoon rain coming from both the Gulf of Thailand and the Andaman Sea, which makes it among Thailand&#x27;s wettest regions with an annual rain fall of . Heavy rainfall and falling leaves led to the erosion of the limestone rocks and created the significant karst formations seen today.

==Flora==
Bamboo holds topsoil very tenaciously, preventing soil erosion on hillsides and riverbanks. With more than 1,500 species, bamboo is the oldest grass in the world, dating back nearly 60 million years. Liana trees grow rapidly wrapping around any vertical or horizontal support base such as &quot;takian&quot; or &quot;rain trees&quot;. Thus, it&#x27;s dangerous to simply cut a tree in the jungle because it can pull connected liana vines with it creating a cascade of damage. Buttress roots are enlarged root bases mostly of trees that grow above the upper canopy. The theory about these roots is that they either developed in order to be more grounded in storms and rain or that they spread out on the ground in order to get more nutrients.

Many kinds of wild fruit can be found around the national park and serve as sustenance for animals. Among those fruits are wild jackfruit, mangosteen, durian, rambutan, jujube, pomelo, and wild bananas. Wild pepper and ginger are not uncommon. Khao Sok National Park is perhaps most famous for the &quot;bua phut&quot; (&quot;Rafflesia kerrii&quot;) flower.

==Wildlife==
The park is estimated to contain over five percent of the world&#x27;s species. Wild mammals include Malayan tapir, Asian elephant, sambar deer, bear, gaur, banteng, serow, wild boar, pig-tailed macaque, langur, white handed gibbons, squirrel, muntjak, mouse deer, and barking deer.

Many websites claim the presence of tigers in Khao Sok National Park. There have been historical records up until a few decades back but there is no trail cam evidence that they still exist in Khao Sok or within the surrounding forest complex.

The world&#x27;s first known amphibious centipede, &quot;Scolopendra cataracta&quot;, was discovered on a stream bank near the national park in 2001.

Khao Sok on the part of the Ratchaprapha Dam is also the last natural habitat in Thailand of the Asian arowana, an endangered living fossil fish.

==Climate==
The so-called wet season is between late April–December. The temperature ranges from all year around. Humidity and warm temperature provide the optimal environment for a rich eco-system in this tropical rain forest.

==Natural history==
This area is estimated to be over 160 million years old, built through tectonic movements, climate changes, erosions and sediment accumulations. Approximately 300 million years ago, shallow water and warm temperatures in this region led to the creation of a huge coral reef. Estimated to be 5 times as big as the Great Barrier Reef in Australia, it originally stretched from China all the way to Borneo. Due to the collision of the Indian and Eurasian plate 0-66 million years ago, the Himalayas were formed, and what is now Thailand shifted dramatically near the continental divide and the limestone rocks were forced upward creating the dramatic limestone &quot;karsts&quot; for which the region is known today. Finally, melting ice established the river-rich landscape as well as dozens of waterfalls around the national park.

==Human history==
The first migrants to Thailand migrated during the Ice Age from Borneo around 37,000 BCE. 

The first accounts of people living in Khao Sok were found in the 1800s, during the reign of Rama II. In the Burmese-Siamese War (1809-1812), the Burmese army invaded the western portion of the area, forcing the inhabitants to flee inland. They found the area to be extremely alluring, in beauty, wildlife abundance, and good soil. As news spread of this discovery, more people immigrated to settle the region.

In 1944, the inhabitants of this region were stricken by a deadly epidemic. A large number of the villagers died while the few survivors escaped from the area to settle in nearby Takua Pa.

In 1961, Route 401 was built from Phun Pin in Surat Thani Province to Takua Pa in Phang Nga Province. At the turn of the millennium, they began the process of expanding Route 401 to a 4 lane freeway.

In the 1970s, Thai student activists and communist insurgents set up strongholds in the caves of Khao Sok. Settled in the shelter of the rainforest they protected the region from the Thai army, loggers, miners, and hunters for seven years.

Khao Sok became a national park in 1980. The government and the Electricity Generating Authority of Thailand (EGAT) were interested in this region because Khao Sok holds the largest watershed in southern Thailand.

Only 2 years later, EGAT completed the high Ratchaprapha Dam, blocking off the &quot;Klong Saeng River&quot;, a tributary of the Phum Duang River and creating a lake inside the park. The dam provides electricity for the south, and the lake became a major holiday destination for Thai and foreign tourists alike. There were several species of animals that had to be resettled to save them from drowning, as the lake slowly filled over a period of 3 years. Unfortunately, a study from 1995 revealed the loss of some 52 species of fish from the river, which could not survive in the stagnant water.

==Activities==
Khao Sok National Park has numerous outdoor activities for tourists.

Trekking: During the day, tourists can enter the West Entrance Due to hike the maintained trails. Sightings of monkeys, tropical birds and insects are common, however its possible to find wild elephants, serow, tigers, and Malayan sun bears. Rafflesia Kerrii Meijer can be found in the area. Those interested in trekking can hire a local guide. Guides are required for night tours. Tourists may stay in the rainforest overnight.

Canoeing and Bamboo rafting: Sok River is known for beautiful views along the river. There are local guides for tourists to hire for canoeing and bamboo rafting tours.

Boat Tours: Tours on Cheow Lan Lake is the most popular tourist destination in the park, due to the picturesque limestone cliffs and turquoise waters. Across the lake, there are several caves to explore such as Diamond cave, Khang Cow Cave and Nam Talu cave. Nam Talu cave is about from the headquarters of Khao Sok National Park. Tour guides are available to boat visitors from the waterfall to the lake.

<text>Use value () or value in use is a concept in classical political economy and Marxist economics. It refers to the tangible features of a commodity (a tradeable object) which can satisfy some human requirement, want or need, or which serves a useful purpose. In Karl Marx&#x27;s critique of political economy, any product has a labor-value and a use-value, and if it is traded as a commodity in markets, it additionally has an exchange value, defined as the proportion by which a commodity can be exchanged for other entities, most often expressed as a money-price.

Marx acknowledges that commodities being traded also have a &quot;general utility&quot;, implied by the fact that people want them, but he argues that this by itself says nothing about the specific character of the economy in which they are produced and sold.

== Origin of the concept ==
The concepts of value, use value, utility, exchange value and price have a very long history in economic and philosophical thought. From Aristotle to Adam Smith and David Ricardo, their meanings have evolved. Smith recognized that commodities may have an exchange-value but may satisfy no use-value, such as diamonds, while a commodity with a very high use-value may have a very low exchange-value, such as water. Marx comments for example that &quot;in English writers of the 17th century we frequently find &quot;worth&quot; in the sense of value in use, and &quot;value&quot; in the sense of exchange-value.&quot; With the expansion of market economy, however, the focus of economists has increasingly been on prices and price-relations, the social process of exchange as such being assumed to occur as a naturally given fact.

In &quot;The Economic and Philosophic Manuscripts of 1844&quot;, Marx emphasizes that the use-value of a labour-product is practical and objectively determined; that is, it inheres in the intrinsic characteristics of a product that enable it to satisfy a human need or want. The use-value of a product therefore exists as a material reality according to social needs regardless of the individual need of any particular person. The use-value of a commodity is specifically a social use-value, meaning that it has a generally accepted use-value for others in society, and not just for the producer.

== Marx&#x27;s definition ==

Marx first defines use-value precisely in &quot;A Contribution to the Critique of Political Economy&quot; (1859) where he explains:

The concept is also introduced at the beginning of &quot;Das Kapital,&quot; where Marx writes, but in the extract below he holds it up as a critique of Hegel&#x27;s liberal &quot;Philosophy of Right&quot;. He remained a sharp critic of what was to the Marxian view a destructive philosophy:

This was a direct reference by Marx to Hegel&#x27;s &quot;Elements of the Philosophy of Right&quot; §63 as Marx adds:

Marx acknowledges that a nominal price or value can be imputed to goods or assets which are not reproducible goods and not produced by human labour, as correctly noted later by Engels that a product is not necessarily a commodity. However Marx generally holds that only human labour expended can create value compared with Nature, through instrumentation known as modus operandi, or the method of working.

== Transformation into a commodity ==
&quot;As exchange-values, all commodities are merely definite quantities of congealed labour-time&quot;, wrote Karl Marx. The discrepancy of the true purpose of value came to be one of the biggest sources of conflict between capital and labour. The transformation of a use-value into a social use-value and into a commodity (the process of commodification) is not automatic or spontaneous, but has technical, social and political preconditions. For example, it must be possible to trade it, and to transfer ownership or access rights to it from one person or organization to another in a secure way. There must also be a real market demand for it. And all that may depend greatly on the nature of the use-value itself, as well as the ability to package, store, preserve and transport it. In the case of information or communication as use-values, transforming them into commodities may be a complex and problem-fraught process.

Thus, the objective characteristics of use-values are very important for understanding (1) the development and expansion of market trade, and (2) necessary technical relationships between different economic activities (e.g. supply chains). To produce a car, for example, you objectively require steel, and this steel is required, regardless of what its price might be. Necessary relationships therefore exist between different use-values, because they are technically, materially and practically related. Some authors therefore write about an &quot;industrial complex&quot; or &quot;technological complex&quot;, indicating thereby how different technological products are linked in a system. A good example would be all the different products involved in the production and use of motor cars.

The category of use-value is also important in distinguishing different economic sectors according to their specific type of output. Following Quesnay&#x27;s analysis of economic reproduction, Marx distinguished between the economic sector producing means of production and the sectors producing consumer goods and luxuries. In modern national accounts more subtle distinctions are made, for example between primary, secondary and tertiary production, semi-durable and durable goods, and so on.

== Role in political economy ==
In his textbook &quot;The Theory of Capitalist Development&quot; (1942), American Marxist Paul Sweezy claimed:

Marx explicitly rejected Sweezy and Uno&#x27;s interpretation of use-value (see the previously cited quotation from 1859, in which use-value is distinguished from the general concept of utility). In a draft included in the Grundrisse manuscripts, which inspired the starting point of &quot;A Contribution to the Critique of Political Economy&quot; and &quot;Das Kapital&quot;, Marx states:

In his text &quot;The Making of Marx&#x27;s &#x27;Capital&quot;&#x27;, Roman Rosdolsky explains the role of use value in Marx&#x27;s economics. Marx himself, in the introduction to his &quot;Grundrisse&quot; manuscript, had defined the economic sphere as the &quot;totality&quot; of production, circulation, distribution &quot;and consumption&quot;. However, as Marx did not live to finish &quot;Das Kapital&quot;, he did not theorise how commercial relations would reshape the sphere of personal consumption in accordance with the requirements of capital accumulation.

Minor issues remained from these neoclassical theories, such as the question of the proper empirical definition of capital and labour in the laws of factor substitution. Other empirical issues include the so-called Solow Residual in which the heterogenous nature of labour is thoroughly explored for its qualitative elements beyond differentiation, and the concept of total factor productivity, prompting some to consider such things as technology, human capital, and stock of knowledge. Later scholars, such as Walter Benjamin, Fernand Braudel, Ben Fine, Manuel Castells and Michel Aglietta attempted to fill the gap in Marx&#x27;s unfinished work. In modern times the theory has been extended to conclude that conversion of energy-driven work does not rely on labour-intensive inputs; thus use can be unsupervised work that develops a notion of human capital.

&quot;Equation: A = P + hL&quot;
(A, the Concept of Substitutive Work = P, the loss of Primary Productive Energy (which is P/Ep, the coefficient of efficiency) + h, the units of energy (which is the energy consumed by workers during work done) * L, Labour time per hour)

== Utility ==
Marx&#x27;s concept of use-value seems akin to, but in reality differs from the neoclassical concept of utility:
* Marx usually assumes in his analysis that products sold in the market have a use-value to the buyer, without attempting to quantify that use-value other than in product units of price, and commodity value. (this caused some of his readers to think wrongly that use-value played no role in his theory). &quot;The utility makes it a use value,&quot; The neoclassicals, on the other hand, typically see prices as the quantitative expression of the general utility of products for buyers and sellers, instead of expressing their exchange-value. For &quot;Price is the money-name of the labour realised in a commodity&quot;.
* In neoclassical economics, this utility is ultimately subjectively determined by the buyer of a good, and not objectively by the intrinsic characteristics of the good. Thus, neoclassical economists often talk about the marginal utility of a product, i.e., how its utility fluctuates according to consumption patterns. This kind of utility is a &quot;general utility&quot; which exists independently from particular uses that can be made of a product, the assumption being that if somebody wants, demands, desires or needs a good, then it has this general utility. According to his supporters Marx would have allegedly rejected the concept of marginal utility precisely because it accentuated profit on capital returns over the usefulness or utility of labour. Thus the wider application of general utility lay in variable rates of productivity, since higher labour inputs could raise or lower the price of commodity. This was the true concept of Use as a Value system: the higher the rate of &#x27;productiveness&#x27; the more labour &#x27;crystallised&#x27; in the article.
* Marx rejects any economic doctrine of consumer sovereignty, stating among other things in his first chapter to &quot;Das Kapital&quot; that &quot;In bourgeois societies the economic &quot;fictio juris&quot; prevails, that every one, as a buyer, possesses an encyclopaedic knowledge of commodities&quot;.

In summary, different concepts of use value lead to different interpretations and explanations of trade, commerce and capitalism. Marx&#x27;s main argument is that if we focus only on the general utility of a commodity, we abstract from and ignore precisely the specific social relations of production which created it.

== &quot;Indifference&quot; of capitalists ==
Some academics such as Professor Robert Albritton, a Canadian political scientist, have claimed that according to Marx, capitalists are basically &quot;indifferent&quot; to the use-value of the goods and services in which they trade, since what matters to capitalists is just the money they make; whatever the buyer does with the goods and services produced is, so it seems, of no real concern.

But this is arguably a misunderstanding of business activity and the bourgeoisie as a class. Marx thought that capitalists can never be totally &quot;indifferent&quot; to use-values, because inputs of sufficient quality (labour, materials, equipment) must be bought and managed to produce outputs that:
* will sell at an adequate profit;
* are legally permitted by the state to be sold;
* do not destroy the reputation of the supplier (with its obvious effect on sales).

For this purpose, the inputs in production must moreover be used in an economical way, and care must be taken not to waste resources to the extent that this would mean additional costs for an enterprise, or reduce productivity. The Theory of Use Values relates directly to human labour and the power of machines to destroy value, &quot;Living labour must seize on these things, awaken them from the dead, change them from merely possible into real and effective use values&quot;.

It is just that from the point of view of the financier or investor, the main concern is not what exactly is being produced as such or how useful that is for society, but whether the investment can make a profit for him. If the products of the enterprise being invested in sell and make a profit, then that is regarded as sufficient indication of usefulness. Even so, the investor is obviously interested in &quot;the state of the market&quot; for the enterprise&#x27;s products—if certain products are being used less or used more, this affects sales and profits. So to evaluate &quot;the state of the market&quot;, the investor needs knowledge about the place of a product in the value chain and how it is being used.

Often, Marx assumed in &quot;Das Kapital&quot; for argument&#x27;s sake that supply and demand will balance, and that products do sell. Even so, Marx carefully defines the production process both as a labour process creating use-values, and a valorisation process creating new value. He asserts only that &quot;capital in general&quot; as an abstract social power, or as a property claim to surplus value, is indifferent to particular use-values—what matters in this financial relation is only whether more value can be appropriated through the exchanges that occur. Most share-holders are not interested in whether a company actually satisfies customers, they want an adequate profit on their investment (but a countertrend is so-called &quot;socially responsible investing&quot;).

In modern times, business leaders are often very concerned with total quality management in production, which has become the object of scientific studies, as well as a new source of industrial conflict, since attempts are made to integrate &quot;everything&quot; a worker is and does (both their creative potential and how they relate to others) in the battle for improved quality. In that case, it could be argued not just labour power but the whole person is a use-value (see further Richard Sennett&#x27;s books such as &quot;The Culture of the New Capitalism&quot;, Yale (2006). Some regard this practice as a kind of &quot;wage-slavery&quot;.

From beginning to end, and from production to consumption, use-value and exchange-value form a dialectical unity. If this is not fully clear from Marx&#x27;s writings, that is perhaps mainly because he never theorised the sphere of final consumption in any detail, nor the way in which commerce reshapes the way that final consumption takes place.

<doc id="843118" wikidata="Q382180" url="?curid=843118" title="Affair of the Placards">
<text>The Affair of the Placards () was an incident in which anti-Catholic posters appeared in public places in Paris and in four major provincial cities, Blois, Rouen, Tours and Orléans, in the night of the 17 to 18 October 1534. One of the posters was posted on the bedchamber door of King Francis I at Amboise, an affront and a breach of security that left him shaken. The &quot;Affaire des Placards&quot; brought an end to the conciliatory policies of Francis, which had formerly attempted to protect the Protestants from the more extreme measures of the Parlement de Paris, and also of the public entreaties for moderation of Philip Melanchthon.

==The placards==
The placards carried the title &quot;Genuine articles on the horrific, great and unbearable abuses of the papal mass, invented directly contrary to the Holy Supper of our Lord, sole mediator and sole savior Jesus Christ.&quot;. This provocative title was a direct attack on Catholic conceptions of the Eucharist. The text supported Zwingli&#x27;s position on the Mass which denied the Real presence of Christ in the Eucharist.

The individual who has been traditionally credited as the chief inspiration, if not the direct author, of the placards, was the French Protestant leader Guillaume Farel, but it seems probable that Antoine de Marcourt, a pastor of Neuchâtel from Picardy, was the real author: Antoine Froment averred that &quot;these placards were made at Neuchâtel in Switzerland by a certain Antoine Marcourd&quot;. Writing anonymously the following month, Marcourt took credit for the placards in the address to benevolent readers of his anonymous &quot;Most useful and salutary little treatise of the holy Eucharist&quot;, published at Neuchâtel, 16 November 1534, in which he avers &quot;I have been moved by true affection to compose and edit in writing some true Articles on the unbearable abuses of the Mass. Which Articles I wish to be published and posted throughout the public places of the land...&quot;

==Aftermath==
Processions were announced in all the parishes of Paris for the following Sunday. In Paris, the King himself stood under the canopy where the Most Holy Eucharist was usually carried, making a clear political statement.

In addition, a reward of a hundred écus was advertised for information leading to the arrest of the perpetrator or perpetrators, who were to be burned at the stake. Protestant sympathizers were soon identified and sent to the Châtelet. The first condemnations were pronounced 10 November 1534; the first of those burned at the stake, on 13 November, was a cripple named Barthélemi Milon.

The polemic against the Catholic Church was considered a severe insult to Catholics, and the King now publicly affirmed his Catholic faith. The immediate public outcry necessitated the flight of several prominent Protestant leaders, including John Calvin, and of scholars and poets like Clément Marot.

In another provocative action on 13 January 1535, when François had recently returned to Paris, broadsheets of a tract on the Sacraments were deposited in the streets and doorways of Paris. Later, printing was banned by royal decree. 

Anyone caught in possession or distribution of placards, libelles, or books on the forbidden topic would be charged and prosecuted simply by association with the forbidden print. The king’s ban had in effect made heresy equivalent to political disobedience in the form of literary crimes. The Affair of the Placards had left no doubt about François I’s attitude towards French Protestantism, dissent, and orthodoxy. In the last seven years of his reign, repressive legislation flowed unabated and fueled the French religious crisis.

<text>A baseball bat is a smooth wooden or metal club used in the sport of baseball to hit the ball after it is thrown by the pitcher. By regulation it may be no more than in diameter at the thickest part and no more than in length. Although historically bats approaching were swung, today bats of are common, topping out at .

==Design==
A baseball bat is divided into several regions. The &quot;barrel&quot; is the thick part of the bat, where it is meant to hit the ball. The part of the barrel best for hitting the ball, according to construction and swinging style, is often called the &quot;sweet spot.&quot; The end of the barrel is called the &quot;top&quot;, &quot;end&quot;, or &quot;cap&quot; of the bat. Opposite the cap, the barrel narrows until it meets the &quot;handle&quot;, which is comparatively thin, so that batters can comfortably grip the bat in their hands. Sometimes, especially on metal bats, the handle is wrapped with a rubber or tape &quot;grip&quot;. Finally, below the handle is the &quot;knob&quot; of the bat, a wider piece that keeps the bat from slipping from a batter&#x27;s hands.

&quot;Lumber&quot; is an often-used slang term for a bat, especially when wielded by a particularly able batter.

The &quot;bat drop&quot; of a bat is its weight, in ounces, minus its length, in inches. For example, a 30-ounce, 33-inch-long bat has a bat drop of minus 3 (30 − 33 = −3). Larger bat drops help to increase swing speed, due to less mass per unit length; smaller drops create more power, due to greater momentum to transfer to the ball.

== History ==
The bat&#x27;s form has become more refined over time. In the mid-19th century, baseball batters were known to shape or whittle their own bats by hand, which resulted in a wide range of shapes, sizes, and weights. For example, there were flat bats, round bats, short bats, and fat bats. Earlier bats were known to be much heavier and larger than today&#x27;s regulated ones. During the 19th century, many shapes were experimented with, as well as handle designs. Today, bats are much more uniform in design.

=== Innovations ===

* On June 17, 1890, Emile Kinst patented the ball-bat, or banana bat. The bat is shaped with a curve, hence the name banana bat. The creator of the bat, Kinst wrote: &quot;The object of my invention is to provide a ball-bat which shall produce a rotary or spinning motion of the ball in its flight to a higher degree than is possible with any present known form of ball-bat, and thus to make it more difficult to catch the ball, or if caught, to hold it, and thus further to modify the conditions of the game&quot;.
* The mushroom bat, made in 1906 by Spalding. With baseball bats being larger in the 1900s the Spalding company designed a larger bat with a mushroom-shaped knob on the handle. This enabled the batter to get a better distribution of weight over the entire length of the bat.
* The Wright &amp; Ditson Lajoie baseball bat. This bat had a normal size barrel but had two knobs on the handle. The lowest knob was at the bottom of the handle and the other knob was roughly two inches above the lowest knob. This was designed to have better spacing between the hands due to the knob being in the middle of the grip. This also gave batters an advantage when they choked up on the bat, because the second knob provided a better grip with in mushroom shaped handle.
* In 1990, Bruce Leinert came up with the idea of putting an axe handle on a baseball bat. He filed a patent application for the &#x27;Axe Bat&#x27; in 2007 and the bat started being used in the college and pro ranks over the following years. In 2012, the Marietta College Pioneers baseball team won the NCAA Division III World Series using axe-handled bats. Several Major League Baseball players have adopted the bat handle including Mookie Betts, Dustin Pedroia, George Springer, Kurt Suzuki and Dansby Swanson.

== Materials and manufacture ==
Baseball bats are made of either hardwood or a metal alloy (typically aluminum). Most wooden bats are made from ash; other woods include maple, hickory, and bamboo. Hickory has fallen into disfavor over its greater weight, which slows down bat speed, while maple bats gained popularity following the introduction of the first major league sanctioned model in 1997. The first player to use one was Joe Carter of the Toronto Blue Jays. Barry Bonds used maple bats the seasons he broke baseball&#x27;s single-season home run record in 2001, and the career home run record in 2007. In 2010, the increased tendency of maple bats to shatter caused Major League Baseball to examine their use, banning some models in minor league play.

Manufacturers position each bat&#x27;s label over the mechanically weaker side of the wood.
To reduce chance of fracture, and maybe deliver more energy to the ball, a bat is intended to be held so the label faces sky or ground when it strikes the ball during a horizontal swing. In this orientation, the bat is considered stiffer and less likely to break.

Different types of wood will fracture differently. For bats made of ash, labels will generally be where the grain spacing is widest. For maple bats they will usually be positioned where grain is tightest.

Maple bats in particular were once known (circa 2008) to potentially shatter in a way that resulted in many sharp edges, sometimes creating more dangerous projectiles when Maple bat manufacture evolved significantly, in cooperation with Major League Baseball, paying special attention to grain slope, and including an ink spot test to confirm safest wood grain orientation.

Based on consistent anecdotal reports of sales at sporting goods stores, and because of the Emerald ash borer epidemic, maple appears to be displacing ash as most popular new baseball bat material in the United States. Next and rising in popularity is bamboo, which has more isotropic fine grain, great strength, and less weight for a bat of any given size.

Within league standards there is ample latitude for individual variation, many batters settling on their own bat profile, or one used by a successful batter. Formerly, bats were hand-turned from a template with precise calibration points; today they are machine-turned to a fixed metal template. Historically significant templates may be kept in a bat manufacturers&#x27; vault; for example, Babe Ruth&#x27;s template, which became popular among major-league players, is &quot;R43&quot; in the Louisville Slugger archives. Ruth favored a thinner handle than was the norm in the 1920s, and his success caused most to follow. Ruth used an unusually large bat, which he reduced in size incrementally during his career. In 1920 he was using a 40-inch, 54-ounce bat, made of ash, with a slender handle. In 1928 he wrote, &quot;A few seasons ago I used a 54 ounce bat, long and with the weight well at the end. Now I&#x27;m using a 46 ounce club--and each season when I have a new set of bats made, I have an addition ounce taken off.&quot;

Once the basic bat has been turned, it has the manufacturer&#x27;s name, the serial number, and often the signature of the player endorsing it branded into it opposite the wood&#x27;s best side. Honus Wagner was the first player to endorse and sign a bat. Next, most bats are given a rounded head, but some 30% of players prefer a &quot;cup-balanced&quot; head, in which a cup-shaped recess is made in the head, introduced to the major leagues in the early 1970s by José Cardenal; this lightens the bat and moves its center of gravity toward the handle. Finally, the bat is stained in one of several standard colors, including natural, red, black, and two-tone blue and white.

== Environmental threat to ash wood ==
The emerald ash borer, an exotic beetle imported accidentally from Asia, has killed more than 50 million white ash trees in the eastern United States and in 2017 threatened groves in New York&#x27;s Adirondack Mountains that are used to make baseball 

==Regulations==
In the American major leagues, Rule 1.10(a) states:
The bat shall be a smooth, round stick not more than 2.61 inches in diameter at the thickest part and not more than 42 inches in length. The bat shall be one piece of solid wood.

Bats are not allowed to be hollowed or corked—that is, filled with an alien substance such as cork which reduces the weight. This corking is thought to increase bat speed without greatly reducing hitting power, though this idea was challenged as unlikely on the Discovery Channel series &quot;MythBusters&quot;.

Both wooden and metal alloy (generally aluminum) bats are generally permitted in amateur baseball. Metal alloy bats are generally regarded as being capable of hitting a ball faster and farther with the same power. However, increasing numbers of &quot;wooden bat leagues&quot; have emerged in recent years, reflecting a trend back to wood over safety concerns and, in the case of collegiate summer baseball wood-bat leagues, to better prepare players for the professional leagues that require wood bats. Metal alloy bats can send a ball towards an unprotected pitcher&#x27;s head up to away at a velocity far too high for the pitcher to get out of the way in time. Some amateur baseball organizations enforce bat manufacturing and testing standards which attempt to limit maximum ball speed for wood and non-wood bats.

In high school baseball in the United States:
* The bat is not permitted to be more than in diameter in proximity to width and length.
* Its &quot;drop&quot; (inches of length minus ounces of weight) must be no more than 3: for example, a 34-inch (863.6‑mm) bat must weigh at least .
* The bat may consist of any safe solid uniform material; the National Federation of State High School Associations rules state only &quot;wood or non-wood&quot; material.
* To be legally used in a game, an aluminum bat has to be a BBCOR (Batted Ball Coefficient of Restitution) bat because it has been determined that a pitcher loses the ability to protect himself when this ratio is exceeded.

In some 12-year-old-and-under youth leagues (such as Little League baseball), the bat may not be more than in diameter. However, in many other leagues (like PONY League Baseball, and Cal Ripken League Baseball), the bat may not be more than in diameter.

There are limitations to how much and where a baseball player may apply pine tar to a baseball bat. According to Rule 1.10(c) of the Major League Baseball Rulebook, it is not allowed more than 18 inches up from the bottom handle. An infamous example of the rule in execution is the Pine Tar Incident on July 24, 1983. Rules 1.10 and 6.06 were later changed to reflect the intent of Major League Baseball, as exemplified by the league president&#x27;s ruling. Rule 1.10 now only requires that the bat be removed from the game if discovered after being used in a game; it no longer necessitates any change to the results of any play which may have taken place.

Rule 6.06 refers only to bats that are &quot;altered or tampered with in such a way to improve the distance factor or cause an unusual reaction on the baseball. This includes, bats that are filled, flat-surfaced, nailed, hollowed, grooved or covered with a substance such as paraffin, wax, etc.&quot; It no longer makes any mention of an &quot;illegally batted ball&quot;. In 2001, MLB approved the use of Gorilla Gold Grip Enhancer in major and minor league games as an alternative to pine tar.

==Care and maintenance==

Players can be very particular about their bats. Ted Williams cleaned his bats with alcohol every night and periodically took them to the post office to weigh them. &quot;Bats pick up condensation and dirt lying around on the ground,&quot; he wrote, &quot;They can gain an ounce or more in a surprisingly short time.&quot; Ichiro Suzuki also took great care that his bats did not accumulate moisture and thus gain weight: he stored his bats in humidors, one in the club house and another, a portable one, for the road. Rod Carew fought moisture by storing his bats in a box full of sawdust in the warmest part of his house. &quot;The sawdust acts as a buffer between the bats and the environment,&quot; he explained, &quot;absorbing any moisture before it can seep into the wood.&quot;

Many players &quot;bone&quot; their bats, meaning that before games, they rub their bats repeatedly with a hard object, believing this closes the pores on the wood and hardens the bat. Animal bones are a popular boning material, but rolling pins, soda bottles and the edge of a porcelain sink have also been used. Pete Rose had his own way of hardening his bats: he soaked them in a tub of motor oil in his basement then hung them up to dry.

==Fungo bat==

A fungo bat is a specially designed bat used by baseball and softball coaches for practice. The etymology of the word &quot;&quot; () is uncertain, but the &quot;Oxford English Dictionary&quot; suggests it is derived from the Scots &quot;fung&quot;: &quot;to pitch, toss, or fling&quot;. A fungo is longer and lighter than a regulation bat, with a smaller diameter. The bat is designed to hit balls tossed up in the air by the batter, not pitched balls. Typical fungo bats are long and weigh . Coaches hit many balls during fielding practice, and the weight and length allow the coach to hit balls repeatedly with high accuracy. The small diameter also allows coaches to easily hit pop-ups to catchers and infielders along with ground balls due to better control of the barrel of the bat.

== As a weapon ==
Baseball bats are often used as weapons by civilians, criminals, protesters, and mobsters. Factors that made the baseball bat a popular weapon include:

* Price: Baseball bats are cheaper to buy and easier to maintain than firearms or bladed weapons.
* Legality: Unlike firearms, bladed weapons, pepper spray, or stun guns, baseball bats are not considered a weapon by many jurisdictions due to being sporting equipment. However, some jurisdictions may ban carrying sporting equipment in public without good reason.
* Ease of access: Baseball bats are freely available in stores such as sporting goods stores. They don&#x27;t require a background check, license, or permit.
* Ease of use: Baseball bats (like many other bludgeon weapons) only require the user to swing at the target in order for it to be effective.
* Diversity: Baseball bats come in various sizes from T-ball bats to full size bats. They can cater to the user&#x27;s strength, size, and available storage places.

<text>The Ichetucknee River is a spring-fed, pristine river in North Central Florida. Located near Fort White, Florida, The Ichetucknee Springs State Park is located in Columbia and Suwannee counties. The entire of the river average wide, deep and most of the 6 miles lie within the boundaries of the Ichetucknee Springs State Park while the rest is to the south of US Highway 27. Three Rivers Estates Property Owners (TREPO) is the property owner association that manages the area along the private side of the river as it travels and flows into the Santa Fe River.

The water in the river is crystal-clear and is 72 °F (22 °C) year-round. There are nine named springs within the Ichetucknee Springs group with an average total flow of 212 million gallons per day. The group includes: Ichetucknee Springs, Cedar Head Spring, Blue Hole Spring, Roaring Springs, Singing Springs, Boiling Spring, Grassy Hole Springs, Mill Pond Spring, and Coffee Spring. The Ichetucknee is a tributary of the Santa Fe River, which in turn flows into the Suwannee River before emptying into the Gulf of Mexico.

The park restricts launch and end points along the river, permitting a tube/raft excursion of 45 min, 1.5 or 3 hours. A variety of commercial vendors, located outside the entrance to the park, rent tubes and rafts for a modest fee.
Park wildlife includes: North American river otter, North American beaver, turtle, ibis, wood stork, egret, great blue heron, cormorant, anhinga, belted kingfisher, limpkin, wild turkey, wood duck, white-tailed deer, raccoon, nine-banded armadillo, wild boar, The fish are primarily bream, bluegill, largemouth bass, alligator gar, mullet, and catfish. West Indian manatees have been seen in the winter months.

== Etymology ==
The name is probably derived from a Muskogean language, possibly from Creek &quot;hvcce-tuccenē&quot; &quot;three streams&quot;. Another widespread etymology translates it as &quot;beaver pond&quot;, perhaps with Creek stems &quot;ue-&quot; &quot;water&quot; and &quot;ecas-&quot; &quot;beaver.&quot; A Hitchiti informant to anthropologist John R. Swanton pronounced the location &quot;Oetcotukni&quot;, suggesting a possible derivation from Creek &quot;ue-cutoknē&quot; &quot;lumpy water&quot;, although he translated it as &quot;where there is a pond of water&quot;.

== History ==
The 17th-century Spanish Fig Springs mission site has been identified in the park. This is probably the site of Mission San Martín de Timucua, which served the Timucua chiefdom known as the Northern Utina. Plans to reconstruct the mission and open it to the public as an interpretational site were dropped. Benjamin Hawkins listed &quot;We-cho-took-[n]e&quot; as a Seminole settlement in 1799. The area was abandoned in the mid 19th century due to war, but was later held by American settlers.

The river was a popular swimming and tubing location for locals and University of Florida students up through the 1960s, which led to litter and other problems. The State of Florida purchased the property in 1970 and began a cleanup and restoration project. It was declared a National Natural Landmark in 1972, and became a tourist attraction.

== Current threats ==
In the early 1990s, the springs were showing signs of an even more disturbing degradation: a progressive decline in water quality. The Florida Department of Environmental Protection commissioned studies which showed that nutrient levels were steadily increasing. Additionally, some swimmers and tubers began to report strange skin rashes, possibly caused by algae fed by nutrients introduced into the aquifer.

<doc id="843139" wikidata="Q4189410" url="?curid=843139" title="5/16 inch star">
<text>A inch star (9.7mm) is a miniature gold or silver five-pointed star that is authorized by the United States Armed Forces as a ribbon device to denote subsequent awards for specific decorations of the Department of the Navy, Coast Guard, Public Health Service, and National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration. A gold star indicates a second or subsequent decoration, while a silver star is worn in lieu of five gold stars.

A ( inch) silver star is not to be confused with representing a Silver Star Medal (Silver Star).

== inch star usage ==
 inch stars are worn on a medal suspension and service ribbon with one point of the star pointing up. Up to five stars can be worn on a ribbon. There are no higher degrees of stars authorized after five silver stars. On miniature medals, a special star is worn on the medal&#x27;s suspension ribbon in lieu of a star. If the number of authorized stars exceeds five, a second service ribbon is worn after the first service ribbon. The second service ribbon counts as one additional personal award, after which more stars may be added to the second ribbon. If future awards reduce the number of stars worn on the first ribbon due to gold stars being replaced by a silver star, the second service ribbon is removed and the appropriate number of star devices are placed on the first service ribbon. When bronze or gold stars or bronze oak leaf cluster attachments are worn in addition to a silver star or silver oak leaf attachment, the bronze or gold stars (bronze oak leaf clusters) are arranged symmetrically on the ribbon in relation to the centered silver device. For example: The first star (cluster) to the wearer&#x27;s right of the centered silver device; the second to the wearer&#x27;s left, etc.

=== Examples ===
The following are examples of the first through twenty-sixth awards of a Navy and Marine Corps Achievement Medal with the gold and silver inch stars:

== Authorized decorations ==
 inch stars are authorized for wear on the following United States Navy, Coast Guard, Public Health Service, and National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration decorations ( inch stars are not authorized for wear on non-decorations when a subsequent decoration is awarded to members of the seven uniformed services: the United States Army, Navy, Air Force, Marine Corps, Coast Guard, Public Health Service, and the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration.

The US Army and US Air Force use an oak leaf cluster to indicate a subsequent decoration (oak leaf clusters are also authorized for wear on some non-decorations); a bronze oak leaf cluster is equivalent to a gold star and a silver oak leaf cluster is equivalent to a silver star.

<doc id="843140" wikidata="Q2440796" url="?curid=843140" title="Henri Hubert">
<text>Henri Hubert (23 June 1872 – 25 May 1927) was a French archaeologist and sociologist of comparative religion who is best known for his work on the Celts and his collaboration with Marcel Mauss and other members of the Année Sociologique.

==Life and work==

Hubert was born and raised in Paris, where he attended Lycée Louis-le-Grand. There he was influenced by the school chaplain, Abbé Quentin, who instilled in him an interest in religion and in particular in religion amongst Assyrians. He entered the École Normale Supérieure. He began to study the history of Christianity. He passed the agrégation in history in 1895 after studying the Eastern Orthodox Church, the Byzantine Empire, and iconoclasm. His doctoral thesis focused on pre-Christian religion in Asia Minor.

Unlike most French academics, Hubert focused on research rather than teaching after graduation. He took a position at the École Pratique des Hautes Études and in 1898 he also took up a position at the Musée des Antiquités. It was at this time that he grew increasingly interested in Celtic history and culture.

It was also in 1898 that Hubert became a close friend of Marcel Mauss and began collaborating on the Année Sociologique of Émile Durkheim, where he eventually became responsible for the section on the &#x27;sociology of religion&#x27;. Hubert and Mauss were to collaborate on several important works in the future, including an &quot;Sacrifice: Its Nature and Function&quot; (1899) and their &quot;Outline of a General Theory of Magic&quot; (1904).

By 1906 Mauss was thoroughly ensconced at the Ecole Pratique, where he would remain until his death. It was also this time that he took up a post at the École du Louvre where he lectured on the ethnographic prehistory of Europe. Throughout the first two decades of the twentieth century Hubert continued to publish on both Asia and the Celts as well as more general topics. Works from this period include (in English translation) &quot;The Rise of the Celts&quot; and &quot;The Greatness and Decline of the Celts&quot;, both available in a single volume entitled &quot;The History of the Celtic People&quot; (London: Kegan Paul, Trench, Trubner 1934; reprint Bracken 1993). His follow-up work on the Germanic peoples, entitled &quot;Les Germains&quot; and published posthumously in 1952, has yet to be translated to English. Also from this period is &quot;Essay on Time: A Brief Study of the Representation of Time in Religion and Magic&quot;.

Durkheim&#x27;s death in 1917 affected Hubert greatly, as did the death of his wife in childbirth in 1924. After years of bereavement, Hubert died in 1927.

<text>State Route 89 (SR 89) is a state highway in the U.S. state of Arizona. It is part of the former route of U.S. Route 89 (US 89) throughout the state.

==Route description==
The southern terminus of SR 89 is located at an intersection with U.S. Route 93 northwest of Wickenburg. It is a largely south–north route; the largest city through which it now passes is Prescott, where it meets SR 69 and the extremely scenic SR 89A. The segment between Prescott and Congress (intersection with SR 71) is quite scenic. The northern terminus of the highway is located at an interchange with Interstate 40 (I-40) in Ash Fork.

==History==

This highway was a segment of US 89 between Ash Fork at I-40 and US 93 northwest of Wickenburg until June 13, 1992 when the US 89 designation was removed south of US 89&#x27;s current southern terminus with Interstate 40 in Flagstaff. Interstate highways offered shorter and more direct routes than the old long-distance US 89 in central and southern Arizona.

<doc id="843156" wikidata="Q169949" url="?curid=843156" title="Rashidi dynasty">
<text>The Rashidi dynasty, also called Al Rashid or the House of Rashid ( ; ), was a historic Arabian House or dynasty that existed in the Arabian Peninsula between 1836 and 1921. Its members were rulers of the Emirate of Ha&#x27;il and the most formidable enemies of the House of Saud, rulers of the Emirate of Nejd. They were centered in Ha&#x27;il, a city in northern Najd that derived its wealth from being on the route of the Hajj pilgrimage to Mecca, and was also a commercial center. The rulers of Ha&#x27;il were the sons of Abdullah bin Rashid, founder of the dynasty.

==History==
The Rashidi dynasty derived their name from their forebear Abdullah bin Ali Al Rashid, the first emir, who began the establishment of the Emirate of Ha&#x27;il. The Rashidi emirs co-operated closely with the Ottoman Empire. However, that co-operation became problematic as the Ottoman Empire lost popularity.

In 1890, Al Rashid occupied Riyadh and then defeated the Saudi tribes, who fled into exile, first to Bahrain, then to Qatar, and finally to Kuwait.

As with many other Arab ruling dynasties, the lack of an accepted rule of succession was a recurrent problem for the Rashidi. The internal dispute normally centered on whether succession to the position of emir should be horizontal (to a brother) or vertical (to a son) and often were resolved violently. Six Rashidi leaders died violently in the last years of the nineteenth century. Nevertheless, the Rashidi still ruled and fought together during the Saudi–Rashidi Wars.

During the first two decades of the 20th century, the Arabian Peninsula saw a long-running series of wars as the Saudis and their allies sought to unite the peninsula under their rule. By 1921, Ha&#x27;il was captured by Abdulaziz Al Saud.

Some members of the Rashid family left the country and went into voluntary exile, mostly to the Kingdom of Iraq, Pakistan, Oman, Kuwait, and the UAE. By the 1990s, only a handful were still inside Saudi Arabia.

==Emirs of the House of Rashid==
# ʿAbdullah bin Ali Al Rashid (), (1836–48). Abdullah came to power after he got the support from Imam Faisal bin Turki bin Abdullah Al Saud to be assigned officially and takeover the Emirate of Hail instead of the current Emir, Muhammad bin Ali al-Jaafar al-Shammari. Abdullah bin Rashid came to the picture after leading a revolt (together with his brother prince ʿUbayd Al Rashīd) against the ruler of Ha&#x27;il, Muhammad bin Ali, who was a fellow member of the Jaafar al-Shammari lineage. As a leader, Abdullah was praised for bringing peace and stability both to Ha&#x27;il and to the surrounding region. Abdullah demanded from his brother prince ʿUbayd an &quot;ahd&quot; (covenant) according to which succession to the office of emir would remain in Abdullah&#x27;s line. Where it was supported by their cousin and close friend Zamil Bin Sabhan from Al Sabhan Family who supported both brothers for the succession. 
# Talāl bin ʿAbdullah (), (1848–68). The son of Abdullah. Talal is remembered for his relative liberalism and interest in building projects. During his rule, the Barzan Palace in Ha&#x27;il was completed. He established regular trade connections with Iraq, and expanded the Rashidi sphere of influence:&quot;The inhabitants of Kaseem, weary of Wahhabee tyranny, turned their eyes towards Telal, who had already given a generous and inviolable asylum to the numerous political exiles of that district. Secret negotiations took place, and at a favourable moment the entire uplands of that province—after a fashion not indeed peculiar to Arabia—annexed themselves to the kingdom of Shommer by universal and unanimous suffrage.&quot; (William Gifford Palgrave, 1865: 129.) Talal was considered relatively tolerant towards foreigners, including traders in Ha&#x27;il: &quot;Many of these traders belonged to the Shia sect, hated by some Sunni, doubly hated by the Wahabees. But Telal [sic] affected not to perceive their religious discrepansies, and silenced all murmurs by marks of special favour towards these very dissenters, and also by the advantages which their presence was not long in procuring for the town&quot;. (William Gifford Palgrave 1865: 130.) In the 1860s, internal disputes in the House of Saud allowed a Rashidi/Ottoman alliance to oust them. The Rashidi occupied the Saudi capital of Riyadh in 1865 and forced the leaders of the House of Saud into exile. Talal later died in a shooting incident which has been termed &quot;mysterious&quot;. Charles Doughty, in his book &quot;Travels in Arabia Deserta&quot;, writes that Talal committed suicide. Talal left seven sons, but the oldest, Bandar, was only 18 or 20 when his father died.
# Mutaib bin Abdullah (), (1868–9). A younger brother of Talal, he was supported by senior members of the Rashid family and the sheikhs of the Shammar sections. After less than two years of reign, he was shot and killed in the Barzan Palace by his nephew and next emir, Bandar. Doughty&#x27;s version of the events is that Bandar and Badr, the second-oldest son, cast a silver bullet to kill their uncle because they knew he wore an amulet that protected him against lead. Henry Rosenfeld also stated that Mutaib bin ʿAbdullah was killed by Bandar and Badr.
# Bandar bin Talal (), (1869). Ruled for only a short time before he was killed by his uncle, Muhammed, the brother of Mutaib. Bandar reportedly married his uncle&#x27;s widow and had a son by her.
# Muhammed bin ʿAbdullah (); (1869-1897) A confrontation outside Ha&#x27;il with his nephew, the young emir Bandar, ended with Muhammed killing Bandar. Muhammed then continued his journey to Ha&#x27;il and announced himself as the new emir. In order to prevent the possibility of revenge, Muhammed gave orders for the execution of all of Bandar&#x27;s brothers (the sons of Talal), Bandar&#x27;s cousins (the children of Talal&#x27;s sister), and their slaves and servants. Only one of Talal&#x27;s sons, Naif, survived. Additionally he eliminated the threat around him from &quot;his uncle&quot; Ubaid and his sons, while he relied on the far cousins Al Sabhan family who identified as supporter for his father before himself. In spite of the inauspicious beginning, his rule turned out to be the longest in the history of the Rashidi dynasty. His rule became &quot;a period of stability, expansion and prosperity&quot; His expansion reached al-Jawf and Palmyra to the north, and Tayma and Khaybar to the west. In 1891, after a rebellion, ʿAbdul Rahman bin Faisal Al Saud left Riyadh. The Saud family, including the ten-year-old Ibn Saud, went into exile in Kuwait.
# ʿAbdulazīz bin Mutaib (), (1897–1906). A son of Mutʿib, the third emir, he was adopted by his uncle Muhammed, the fifth emir, and brought up to be his heir. After Muhammed died of natural causes, Abd al-ʿAziz succeeded him unopposed. However Rashidi rule was insecure as their Ottoman allies were unpopular and weakening. In 1904, the young Ibn Saud, the future founder of Saudi Arabia, returned from exile with a small force and retook Riyadh. Abd al ʿAziz died in the battle of Rawdat Muhanna with ibn Saud in 1906.
# Mutʿib bin ʿAbd al ʿAzīz (), (1906–07). Succeeded his father as emir. However, he was not able to win support of the whole family, and, within a year, he was killed by Sultan bin Hammud.
# Sultān bin Hammūd (), (1907–08). A grandson of Ubayd (the brother of the first emir), he was criticized because he ignored the &quot;ahd&quot; (covenant) between his grandfather and the first emir. He was unsuccessful in fighting Ibn Saud, and was killed by his own brothers.
# Saʿūd bin Hammūd (), (1908–10). Another grandson of Ubayd. Saʿud was killed by the maternal relatives of Saʿud bin ʿAbd al-ʿAziz, the 10th emir.
# Saud bin Abdulaziz (), (1910–20). A boy of 10 when he was made emir, his maternal relatives of the Al Sabhan family ruled as regents on his behalf until he came of age, based on the constitution of Emara. In 1920, he was assassinated by his cousin, Abdullah bin Talal (a brother of the 12th emir). Two of his widows remarried: Norah bint Hammud Al Sabhan became Ibn Saud&#x27;s eight wife, and Fahda bint Asi bin Shuraim Al Shammari of the Abde section of the Shammar tribe became Ibn Saud&#x27;s ninth wife and the mother of King Abdullah of Saudi Arabia.
# ʿAbdullah bin Mutʿib (), (1920–21). A son of the 7th emir, he surrendered to Ibn Saud, he was 20 years old. Despite that, he was one of the key factor of Hail Emara deterioration. 
# Muhammad bin Talāl (), (1921). A grandson of Naif, the only surviving son of Talal, the second emir. Muhammad bin Talal&#x27;s wife Nura bint Sabhan from the Al Sabhan family married to King Abdulaziz after he was imprisoned by him. Surrendered to Ibn Saud. One of the daughters of Muhammad bin Talal, Watfa, married Prince Musa&#x27;id bin Abdulaziz Al Saud, the twelfth son of Ibn Saud. Prince Musa&#x27;id and Watfa became the parents of Prince Faisal bin Musa&#x27;id, the assassin of King Faisal.

There has been a tendency to attribute the development of the House of Rashid to trading and commercial expansion, but documents have come to light which emphasise the significance of external pressures and the Rashidi&#x27;s interaction with foreign governments and leaders, but Al Sauds are equally said of the same thing which catapulted them to power.

<text>Mercutio ( , ) is a fictional character in William Shakespeare&#x27;s 1597 tragedy, &quot;Romeo and Juliet&quot;. He is a close friend to Romeo and a blood relative to Prince Escalus and Count Paris. As such, Mercutio is one of the named characters in the play with the ability to mingle around those of both houses. The invitation to Lord Capulet&#x27;s party states that he has a brother named Valentine.

Though often fun-loving and witty, the latter demonstrated in his Queen Mab speech in the first act, Mercutio&#x27;s sense of humour can at times be facetious or even coarse, much to his friends&#x27; annoyance. He is also moody and given to sudden outbursts of temper, one of which sets a key plot development in motion.

==Role in the play==
One of Romeo&#x27;s closest friends, Mercutio entreats Romeo to forget about his unrequited love for a girl named Rosaline and come with him to a masquerade ball at Lord Capulet&#x27;s estate, through use of his Queen Mab speech. There, Mercutio and his friends become the life of the party, but Romeo is drawn to Capulet&#x27;s daughter, Juliet. He finds himself in love, and immediately forgets about Rosaline. When Mercutio sees Romeo the next day, he is glad to see that his friend is his old self again, and he encourages Romeo, all the while making bawdy jokes at the expense of Juliet&#x27;s Nurse.

After Romeo receives a death threat from Juliet&#x27;s cousin Tybalt, Mercutio expects Romeo to engage Tybalt in a duel. However, Romeo refuses to fight Tybalt, because Romeo now considers Tybalt to be kin due to his secret marriage to Juliet. Mercutio is incensed at his friend&#x27;s &quot;calm, dishonorable, vile submission&quot;, and decides to fight Tybalt himself, referring to his own sword as his &quot;fiddlestick.&quot; Romeo attempts to intervene. By stepping between the dueling men, however, he inadvertently hinders Mercutio, allowing Tybalt to inflict a fatal blow. Before he dies, Mercutio curses both the Montagues and Capulets, crying several times, &quot;A plague o&#x27; both your houses!&quot; (Act III, Sc. 1, often quoted as &quot;A pox on both your houses&quot;). He makes one final pun before he dies: &quot;Ask for me to-morrow, and you shall find me a grave man.&quot;. A grief-stricken and enraged Romeo kills Tybalt, resulting in his banishment from Verona and beginning the tragic turn of events that make up the rest of the play.

== Name origins ==
The name Mercutio was present in Shakespeare&#x27;s sources for &quot;Romeo and Juliet&quot;, though his character was not well developed and he was presented as a romantic rival for Juliet. The name is first used in Luigi Da Porto&#x27;s 1530 &quot;Giulietta e Romeo&quot;. Da Porto briefly introduces a character named Marcuccio Guertio, a noble youth &quot;with very cold hands, in July as in January&quot;, who makes Giulietta Cappelletti appreciate the warm hands of Romeo Montecchi.

==Mercutio&#x27;s death==
Earlier versions of the story described a different chain of events leading to Tybalt&#x27;s death, omitting Mercutio completely. Arthur Brooke&#x27;s &quot;The Tragical History of Romeus and Juliet&quot; and William Painter&#x27;s 1567 versions of the story both left the entire episode solely to Romeo and Tybalt. In both stories, Tybalt attacks the pacifist Romeo with such force that Romeo is forced to take up the sword to defend himself. He is then banished rather than executed because the killing was provoked. In 1672, English poet John Dryden wrote, &quot;Shakespeare show&#x27;d the best of his skill in his Mercutio, and he said himself, that he was forced to murder him in the third Act, to being killed by him.&quot;

The addition of Mercutio into the fray increases the tension, and Tybalt is seen as a slightly more peaceful character than in previous versions, as Mercutio is disgusted by the fact that Tybalt continues to search for a quarrel with Romeo, when Romeo is trying to bring peace between them. Mercutio hurls insults and taunts at Tybalt, and draws the sword first, in reaction to Tybalt&#x27;s insults, which are directed to Romeo.

Mercutio&#x27;s death in Act III, scene I is the pivotal point of the play, which up to this point is relatively light-hearted. Mercutio&#x27;s death is sudden and makes death a dark reality for several characters, causing a domino effect that leads ultimately to the tragic climax.

<text>San Diego Comic-Con is a comic book convention and multi-genre entertainment event held annually in San Diego, California, at the San Diego Convention Center. Founded in 1970, originally showcasing primarily comic books and science fiction/fantasy media, Comic-Con has grown to include a large range of pop culture and entertainment elements across virtually all genres.

According to &quot;Forbes&quot;, Comic-Con is the &quot;largest convention of its kind in the world&quot;. Since 2010, Comic-Con has filled the San Diego Convention Center to capacity with over 130,000 attendees. Comic-Con is home to the Eisner Awards, which recognizes creative achievement in American comic books, often referred to as the comic industry&#x27;s equivalent to the Academy Awards.

San Diego Comic Convention, doing business as Comic-Con International, is the corporate name of the public-benefit nonprofit corporation behind Comic-Con. The corporation also organizes WonderCon, an annual convention held in Anaheim, California, and SAM: Storytelling Across Media, a symposium held at the Comic-Con Museum in Balboa Park.

==History and organization==
The convention was founded in 1970 by Shel Dorf, Richard Alf, Ken Krueger, Mike Towry, Ron Graf, Barry Alfonso, Bob Sourk, and Greg Bear. Initial comic book and sci-fi club meetings would be held at Krueger&#x27;s Alert Books in Ocean Beach, where much of the foundation of the early Cons coalesced. In the mid-1960s, Dorf, a Detroit-born comics fan, had mounted the Detroit Triple-Fan Fair, one of the first commercial comics-fan conventions. When he moved to San Diego in 1970, he organized a one-day convention known as San Diego&#x27;s Golden State Comic-Minicon on March 21, 1970, &quot;as a kind of &#x27;dry run&#x27; for the larger convention he hoped to stage&quot;. Dorf went on to be associated with the convention as president or manager, variously, for years until becoming estranged from the organization. Alf co-chaired the first convention with Krueger and became chairman in 1971.
Following the initial gathering, Dorf&#x27;s first three-day San Diego comic convention, San Diego Golden State Comic-Con, drew 300 people. The venue was held in the basement of the U.S. Grant Hotel, having been secured by Graf, from August 1–3, 1970. The first few Comic-Cons operated under the name San Diego West Coast Comic Convention until 1973, when it changed to San Diego Comic-Con. Other locations in the convention&#x27;s early years included El Cortez Hotel, the University of California, San Diego, and Golden Hall, before being moved to the San Diego Convention Center in 1991. Richard Alf, chairman in 1971, has noted an early factor in the Con&#x27;s growth was an effort &quot;to expand the Comic-Con [organizing] committee base by networking with other fandoms such as the Society for Creative Anachronism and the Mythopoeic Society, among others. (We found a lot of talent and strength through diversity)&quot;. In a &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; article about the origins of Comic-Con, it noted the work of Krueger, who handled early business matters, and worked to get the event to be organized by a non-profit organization. By the late 1970s, the show had grown to such an extent that Bob Schreck recalled visiting with his then-boss Gary Berman of Creation Conventions and reflecting, &quot;While [Berman] kept repeating (attempting to convince himself) &#x27;This show&#x27;s not any bigger than ours!&#x27; I was quietly walking the floor stunned and in awe of just how much bigger it really was. I was blown away.&quot; From 1984 to , a trade fair called the &quot;San Diego Comic Book Expo&quot; was held in association with San Diego Comic-Con; David Scroggy was the organizer. In 1995, the convention&#x27;s official name was changed to Comic-Con International: San Diego.

According to &quot;Forbes&quot;, the convention is the &quot;largest convention of its kind in the world&quot;; &quot;Publishers Weekly&quot; wrote &quot;Comic-Con International: San Diego is the largest show in North America&quot;; it is also the largest convention held in San Diego. The convention has an estimated annual regional economic impact of more than $140 million. Yet, in 2009, the estimated economic impact was criticized for allegedly negatively impacting seasonal businesses outside of Comic-Con, low individual spending estimates of attendees, that a large number of attendees live in San Diego, and that the impact of the convention was more cultural than financial.

The estimated economic impact of that year&#x27;s convention was $180 million. In 2014, the estimated impact of that year&#x27;s convention was $177.8 million. In 2016, the estimated impact of that year&#x27;s convention was down to $150 million. By 2018, San Diego Comic-Con saw increasing competition from other comic conventions in places such as New York City, and Washington, D.C., which caused it to compete for attendees and companies time and budget; yet San Diego Comic-Con was described by &quot;Publishers Weekly&quot; as &quot;a must-do&quot;.

The convention is organized by a panel of 13 board members, 16 to 20 full-time and part-time workers, and 80 volunteers who assist via committees. Comic-Con International is a non-profit organization, and proceeds of the event go to funding it, as well as SAM: Storytelling Across Media and WonderCon. The convention logo was designed by Richard Bruning and Josh Beatman in 1995. In 2015, working with Lionsgate, a video channel was created to host Comic-Con related content. In 2015, through a limited liability company, Comic-Con International purchased three buildings in Barrio Logan. In 2018 Comic-Con International purchased a office in San Diego&#x27;s Little Italy neighborhood.

In 2017, the organization acquired a lease to the Federal Building in Balboa Park, originally built for the California Pacific International Exposition and previously occupied by the San Diego Hall of Champions, with the intention of opening the Comic-Con Museum. By October 2017, the organization began to hire staff for the museum. Nearly a year after acquiring the lease, the museum was not yet open. During the 2018 Comic-Con, one reason stated for why the museum had not yet opened was the need for additional funds. Organizers are hoping to raise $25 million with a target opening date of late 2020 or 2022.

On April 17, 2020, the 53rd convention was cancelled due to the COVID-19 pandemic in California and two stay-at-home orders issued by California governor Gavin Newsom. It was originally scheduled to occur from July 23 to 26, 2020, to coincide with the 2020 Summer Olympics in Tokyo, Japan, which was postponed to 2021 due to the pandemic. An &quot;SDCC@Home&quot; digital streaming event was held during the same time period as a replacement for the 2020 event.

Although plans were made for the convention to possibly return in 2021 (with 2020 badge holders given the option to receive a full refund or to roll over their badge to 2021), it was announced on March 1, 2021, that the convention would be cancelled once again. Despite availability of COVID-19 vaccines, the organizers assessed that it was still premature and unsafe to hold an in-person event at Comic-Con&#x27;s full scale on the originally-scheduled dates, and that Comic-Con International was exploring the possibility of holding a smaller in-person spin-off event later in the year. SDCC@Home would again be held, but in a downsized form. A smaller in-person event, &quot;San Diego Comic-Con Special Edition&quot; was hosted in November 2021, with proof of full COVID-19 vaccination or a recent negative test required for admission, and face masks being mandatory. The full-scale convention returned in July 2022; once again, face masks and proof of full COVID-19 vaccination was required.

On July 13, 2023, SAG-AFTRA approved a strike after failing to renew its contract with the Alliance of Motion Picture and Television Producers (AMPTP), marking the first time that both actors and writers have concurrently been on strike since 1960. As SAG-AFTRA members would be prohibited from participating in promotional work such as panels, multiple major media companies preemptively pulled out of Comic-Con as early as June, including Disney (including subsidiaries Marvel and Lucasfilm), Netflix, Inc., Sony Pictures, and Universal Pictures.

In July 2024, San Diego Police Chief Scott Wahl cited Comic-Con as an exigent circumstance allowing him to bypass a recently enacted privacy law and fast-track the installation of &quot;smart streetlights&quot; and automated license plate readers in the vicinity of the convention. Wahl was unaware of any specific threats but said &quot;that could change at any moment.&quot; In December 2024, a lawsuit was filed against the SDPD for improperly deploying the surveillance systems at Comic-Con and at the San Diego Pride Parade without disclosing their locations or the nature of the &quot;exegent circumstances&quot; in voiolation of the law.

==Events==

On the Wednesday evening prior to the official opening, professionals, exhibitors, and pre-registered guests for all four days can attend a pre-event, dubbed &quot;Preview Night&quot;, to give attendees the opportunity to walk the exhibit hall and see what will be available during the convention.

Along with panels, seminars, and workshops with comic book professionals, there are previews of upcoming feature films and portfolio review sessions with top comic book and video game companies. The evenings include events such as awards ceremonies, the annual Masquerade costume contest, and the Comic-Con International Independent Film Festival, which showcases shorts and feature-length movies that do not have distribution or distribution deals.

Traditional events include an eclectic film program, screening rooms devoted to Japanese animation, gaming, programs such as cartoonist Scott Shaw!&#x27;s &quot;Oddball Comics&quot; slide show, Quick Draw! hosted by Mark Evanier with Shaw!, Sergio Aragones and a guest cartoonist responding to improvisational prompts and games (a la &quot;Whose Line Is It Anyway?&quot;), and animation expert Jerry Beck&#x27;s program featuring TV&#x27;s &quot;worst cartoons ever&quot;, as well as over 350 hours of other programming on all aspects of comic books and pop culture.

Like most comic book conventions, Comic-Con features a large floorspace for exhibitors. These include media companies such as movie studios and TV networks, as well as comic-book dealers and collectibles merchants. And like most comics conventions, Comic-Con includes an autograph area, as well as the Artists&#x27; Alley where comics artists can sign autographs and sell or do free sketches. Despite the name, artists&#x27; alleys can include writers and even models.

Academics and comic industry professionals annually hold the Comics Arts Conference at Comic-Con, presenting scholarly studies on comics as a medium.

In recent years, the number of television shows that are promoted far outnumber films. During the 2011 convention, at least 80 TV shows were represented, compared to about 35 films. The shows not only promote in the exhibit halls, but also use screenings and panels of various actors, writers, producers, and others from their shows.

Premium cable channels HBO and Showtime have used the con to promote programs like &quot;Game of Thrones&quot; (HBO), &quot;Dexter&quot; (Showtime), &quot;Shameless&quot; (Showtime) and &quot;True Blood&quot; (HBO). Streaming services, including Netflix and Amazon Prime Video, have also had an increased presence at Comic-Con since the late-2010s.

In 2013, there were 1075 total panels held during the convention, the plurality of which were anime-focused (29%), followed by comic-focused panels (26%). The 2013 convention had 1036 vendors.

There are at least 17 separate rooms in the convention center used for panels and screenings, ranging in size from 280 seats to 6,100 seats. The two biggest are Ballroom 20, which seats approximately 4,900; and Hall H, which seats just over 6,100.

The neighboring Hilton Bayfront is also used, with its main ballroom (Indigo) seating up to 2,600. The other neighboring hotel, the Marriott Marquis &amp; Marina, also hosts a lot of Comic-Con activity. Among other things, the hotel serves as the anime headquarters and is where the nighttime films are shown.

==Locations and dates==
==In the media ==
Comic-Con has served as the setting for Mark Hamill&#x27;s &quot;Comic Book: The Movie&quot;, and for an episode of the HBO television series &quot;Entourage&quot;, the latter of which, while set at the event, was not filmed there. Comic-Con also served as an excuse for the fictional characters Seth Cohen and Ryan Atwood&#x27;s trip to Tijuana, Mexico in episode 7 (&quot;The Escape&quot;) of the first season of TV series &quot;The O.C.&quot; The convention also featured prominently as a setting for the &quot;Numb3rs&quot; episode &quot;Graphic&quot;. In season 4 of &quot;Beauty and the Geek&quot;, an episode was featured where the contestants traveled to Comic-Con 07 and were given a challenge to create their own superheroes. In an episode of &quot;Punk&#x27;d&quot;, Hilary Swank gets Punk&#x27;d after an &quot;attack from talking robot&quot;. In season 5, episode six, of the Showtime show &quot;Weeds&quot;, attendees from Comic-Con 2009 are seen in Silas and Doug&#x27;s medicinal marijuana club.

Comic-Con featured at some length in the 2011 movie &quot;Paul&quot; which stars Simon Pegg and Nick Frost.

Issue No. 72 of &quot;The Invincible Iron Man&quot; (January 1975) was set at the July–August 1974 Comic-Con at the El Cortez Hotel and featured cameos by a few of the special guests. The fifth Kelly Green graphic novel &quot;The Comic-Con Heist&quot; (1987) written by Leonard Starr and drawn by Stan Drake was set at the 1983 con and depicted such regulars as Will Eisner, Milton Caniff, Burne Hogarth and Jack Kirby along with Shel Dorf; it initially only appeared in French until Classic Comics Press issued a collection of all five volumes of the series in English in 2016. Other comics set at the convention include &quot;Archie&quot; No. 538 (September 2003), Archie Giant Series No. 601 (October 1989) and No. 624 (October 1991), &quot;G.I. Joe&quot; No. 180 (July 2012), &quot;Dazzler&quot; No. 30 (January 1984), &quot;Lobo Convention Special&quot; ([September] 1993) and &quot;Fanboys Vs Zombies&quot;. 1992–1995 the Con partnered with Dark Horse Comics for an annual &quot;San Diego Comic Con Comics&quot; giveaway to attendees spotlighting characters published by Dark Horse.

Comic-Con is mentioned in the long-running CBS geek-targeted sitcom &quot;The Big Bang Theory&quot; in several episodes, and in NBC&#x27;s &quot;Chuck&quot; in the episode &quot;Chuck Versus the Sandworm&quot;, as an event the characters enjoy attending. On the &quot;Futurama&quot; episode &quot;Lrrreconcilable Ndndifferences&quot;, the main characters attend the 3010 convention (with it being referred to as &quot;Comic-Con Intergalactic&quot; and the iconic eye logo now sporting multiple eyes), where Fry looks for approval for his own comic while Bender attends a panel from Matt Groening (creator of &quot;Futurama&quot; as well as &quot;The Simpsons&quot;) on his new show &quot;Futurella&quot; (a twist on the title of the show and a parody of its cancellation by Fox).

In &quot;It&#x27;s My Party and I&#x27;ll Bang If I Want To&quot;, an episode of the 2011 season of &quot;The Real World: San Diego&quot;, the cast attends Comic-Con made up as zombies in order to pass out promotional flyers for the House of Blues, where they worked as part of their season work assignment. Filmmaker Morgan Spurlock released a 2011 documentary feature film set at the convention, &quot;Comic-Con Episode IV: A Fan&#x27;s Hope&quot;. Writer Robert Salkowitz also used the 2011 Comic-Con as a backdrop for his book &quot;Comic-Con and the Business of Pop Culture&quot;, an analysis of the comics industry&#x27;s 21st-century dilemmas and what the future may hold.

From 2015 to 2019, Conan O&#x27;Brien recorded a week of live shows from Comic-Con at the nearby Spreckels Theatre.

In 2015, the Food Network series &quot;Cake Masters&quot; had an episode where Duff Goldman presented a cake at Comic-Con to the cast of &quot;Fantastic Four&quot;.

===Comic-Con Begins Podcast===
In 2020, SiriusXM in association with Stitcher started production on &quot;COMIC-CON BEGINS: Origin Stories of the San Diego Comic-Con and the Rise of Modern Fandom&quot;. The podcast is a six-part mini-series chronicling the birth and evolution of San Diego Comic-Con, and is told by over 50 of the original contributors. Among the founders there are also interviews with celebrities like Felicia Day, Ho Che Anderson, Jackie Estrada, Scott Aukerman, Trina Robbins, Kevin Smith, Neil Gaiman, and Bruce Campbell. The podcast was hosted by Brinke Stevens of &quot;Slumber Party Massacre&quot;. The podcast was expanded into the book &quot;See You at San Diego: An Oral History of Comic-Con, Fandom, and the Triumph of Geek Culture&quot; by creator Mathew Klickstein and published by Fantagraphics on September 6, 2022. The book includes forewords by cartoonists Stan Sakai and Jeff Smith, and an afterword by Wu-Tang Clan&#x27;s RZA. The audiobook version was released on the same day by Blackstone Audio.

On March 28, 2024, it was announced that Academy Award and Emmy Award nominated executive producer David Permut and producer Oscar Boyson will be creating a feature-length documentary about Comic-Con, based on the book and podcast series.

==&quot;Comic-Con Magazine&quot;==
&quot;Comic-Con Magazine&quot;, formerly known as &quot;Update&quot;, is the official magazine of Comic-Con, WonderCon, and SAM: Storytelling Across Media, published free by San Diego Comic-Con International in the United States. The seed of &quot;Comic-Con Magazine&quot; was a short one-shot issue of &quot;The Spirit&quot;, based on Comic-Con and sold exclusively in 1976 at Comic-Con. The &quot;Comic-Con Magazine&quot; debuted as &quot;Update&quot; in July 2005 and mainly focused on the winners of the Eisner Awards. The last &quot;Update&quot; issue appeared in July 2008; then it went on hiatus. When it came back, it was as &quot;Comic-Con Magazine&quot;, which not only covered San Diego Comic-Con, but also WonderCon and the Alternative Press Expo, more commonly known as APE (which the con owned through 2014). The new &quot;Comic-Con Magazine&quot; features interviews with Comic-Con attendees and complete coverage of Comic-Con events. The fourth issue of &quot;Comic-Con Magazine&quot; was a hybrid with Comic-Con&#x27;s Souvenir Book with cover art by Alex Ross, in full color and exclusive to Comic-Con attendees.

==Exhibitors==
A large number of exhibitors from art, comics, games, film, TV, and publishing make their appearance at Comic-Con.

There are three types of exhibitors at San Diego Comic Con. Inside the convention center, which requires a badge to visit during the convention, includes artists alley and the main exhibitor hall. Artist Alley is for up and coming artists who are new to the pop culture world by selling their new books, comics, toys, and or services. They range from local companies and businesses in Southern California to international ones, but are mainly private endeavors. Artist Alley is usually located in Hall G of the convention center. Spaces for these exhibitors are highly sought after and are on a lottery and need-based system.

The main exhibit hall, which includes larger well-recognized companies, takes up halls F through A. These companies sell or promote new and upcoming movies, television shows, and video games as well as featuring toys and exclusives with many selling for hundreds or even thousands on the secondary markets outside the convention. Some notable recurring companies include Lego, Hasbro, Funko, Hallmark Cards, Nickelodeon, Cartoon Network, The Walt Disney Company, and Blizzard Entertainment. In the 21st century, the convention has drawn toy and collectibles designers who sell &quot;Comic-Con Exclusive&quot; products. Most such exclusives are licensed properties of film, comic book and animation characters.

===Off site===
The other type of exhibitors include offsite exhibitors, booths and events which are located outside the convention center. These locations are usually within walking distance of the convention center but have been moving into nearby parks in recent years. Some notable examples include Gaslamp Quarter, Petco Park, and Children&#x27;s Park. In recent years, these offsite events have no connection to Comic-Con. In the past, most sites have not required a Comic-Con badge. In 2017, one example was a virtual reality and immersive set based on the movie &quot;Blade Runner 2049&quot;. In 2018, these examples included a Taco Bell &quot;Demolition Man&quot; themed pop-up restaurant in the Gaslamp and a Shake Shack &quot;Bob&#x27;s Burgers&quot; themed pop-up restaurant in Mission Valley. However, there are some official offsite events that require a badge. In 2018, it was estimated that nearly 200,000 people would be in downtown San Diego due to Comic-Con related exhibits and events.

==Overcrowding==
Capacity attendance at Comic-Con in 2006 and 2007 has caused crowding issues. Concerns have been raised that the event is possibly too large for the San Diego Convention Center, Comic-Con&#x27;s home through at least 2024. In 2006, Comic-Con, for the first time, had to close registration for a few hours on Saturday to accommodate crowds. In response, for 2007, Comic-Con introduced a new three-day membership that did not include Saturday. Nevertheless, the 2007 show went on to sell out Saturday, as well as Friday and Sunday for the first time. Additionally, both the four-day and three-day memberships sold out for the first time. For 2008, the three-day memberships were abandoned and the convention decided to sell memberships only in advance, with no on-site registration. In 2008, all memberships were sold out before the convention for the first time. This sellout has given rise to the new phenomenon of Comic-Con memberships being scalped for exorbitant prices on websites such as eBay and Craigslist.

In April 2008, David Glanzer, Comic-Con&#x27;s director of marketing and public relations, commented on the organization&#x27;s desire to remain in San Diego:
Heidi McDonald reported on her blog &quot;The Beat&quot; as of October 7, 2009, Preview Night for the 2010 show had already sold out. Glazner explained the early sell-out:

Mark Evanier on his blog &quot;News from ME&quot; noted as of November 9, 2009, that all 4-day passes for the 2010 show had already been sold out. On February 23, 2010, &quot;The Orange County Register&quot; reported that the larger Anaheim Convention Center in Anaheim would be making a bid to become the new home of Comic-Con starting in 2013. On September 30, 2010, Comic Con announced that they had extended their stay up to 2015. The &quot;North County Times&quot; reported on July 26, 2010, that 4-day passes with access to Preview night for the 2011 Convention had sold out two hours before the 2010 convention closed. Comic-Con International announced that 4-day passes for the 2014 convention (July 24–27) would no longer be available and only single days would be sold. Due to overcrowding, organizers of the event capped attendance; this cap has been in place since 2007.

As of October 2013, a $520 million proposed expansion to the San Diego Convention Center received approval from the California Coastal Commission. The proposed expansion would increase the available space within the convention center and had a target completion date of early 2016. The expansion would add approximately 225,000 square feet of exhibit space, an additional 35%; and a brand-new 80,000 square foot ballroom, 20% larger than Hall H. The plan would also add a second tower to the Hilton Bayfront hotel, adding 500 rooms adjacent to the Convention Center. Due to the proposed expansion of the convention center, Comic Con extended its contract for San Diego to 2016. In 2014, convention center expansion was halted due to a lawsuit. As of July 2015, convention center expansion is effectively frozen, partly because the city no longer has financing lined up for it (any financing plan would involve taxpayer money and would have to be approved by a public vote), and partly because the city lost the rights to the only contiguous parcel of land where expansion could occur. Other cities, including Los Angeles, began to seek to have Comic-Con move out of San Diego; In 2015, Comic-Con entered into negotiations with San Diego. As a result of these negotiations, Comic-Con entered into a contract to stay in San Diego through 2018. The commitment to San Diego was extended to 2021, then to 2024.

==Accidents and incidents==

In 2012, a 53-year-old woman was struck and killed by a motorist Tuesday as she tried to cross the street in front of the San Diego Convention Center, police said. The woman tripped and hit the car while crossing at the intersection of 5th and Harbor. She had been part of the crowd camping out for the &quot;Twilight&quot; panel.

In 2013, a young woman attempted to jump off the balcony of a local high-rise, but nearby stuntmen prevented it.

In 2014, multiple pedestrians marching in an off-site ZombieWalk were struck by a car forcing its way through an intersection. A 64-year-old woman sustained serious injuries to her arm; two others had minor injuries.

The same year, a teenage cosplayer was initially thought to have been sexually assaulted early Sunday morning, and a suspect was arrested on Sunday at the San Diego Marriott Hotel and Marina. Police later stated that the teenage girl was injured in a fall, and the arrested individual was released without any charges.

In 2024, a three-alarm kitchen fire started in a nearby steakhouse caused the evacuation of around 1200 attendees of an &quot;Iceberg Lounge&quot; promotional event for the HBO series &quot;The Penguin&quot;. The next day, actress Jennifer Garner got stuck in an elevator and had to call the fire department to get her out. Also in 2024, the &quot;San Diego Human Trafficking Task Force&quot; conducted a multi-agency undercover operation that arrested 14 and rescued 10 victims. According to the California Attorney General&#x27;s Office, &quot;sex buyers were using the San Diego Comic-Con Convention to seek out potential victims&quot;.

==Trademark==
In 2014, San Diego Comic-Con sent a cease and desist order to the organizers of Salt Lake Comic Con, asserting that &quot;Comic-Con&quot; and &quot;Comic-Con International&quot; were registered trademarks of the convention, and that use of the term &quot;comic con&quot; in any form was trademark infringement as it implies an unauthorized association with San Diego Comic-Con. A U.S. court ruled in favor of San Diego Comic-Con and awarded $20,000 in damages (albeit not considering the infringement to be willful). Phoenix Comiccon changed its name to Phoenix Comic Fest as a proactive move to avoid possible legal issues in the wake of this ruling. They then filed a motion in an Arizona Federal Court to strike down San Diego Comic Convention&#x27;s trademark. In 2017, the Salt Lake Comic Con changed its name to FanX Salt Lake Comic Convention (or just FanX). On January 16, 2018, Salt Lake Comic Con filed a motion for a new trial.

<text>Lieutenant Frank Spangenberg (born July 26, 1957) is an American game show contestant who garnered fame in 1990 when he set the five-day cumulative winnings record on &quot;Jeopardy!&quot;, becoming the first person to win more than $100,000 in five days on the show. He has been called one of the &quot;veritable legends&quot; of the show.

==Career==
Spangenberg, at the time a member of the New York City Transit Police Department (now the Transit Bureau of the New York City Police Department), won $102,597 in five days in 1990. On his fifth and final appearance, he set a one-day record of $30,600. Prior to 2003, winners were retired after five consecutive victories and due to a winnings cap in place on &quot;Jeopardy!&quot; at the time, Spangenberg was able to keep only $75,000 of his total winnings; he donated the remaining $27,597 to the Gift of Love Hospice, a facility operated by the Missionaries of Charity. According to Spangenberg, his donation arrived at the facility the day after the hospice learned it needed to install a safety system that totaled approximately the same amount as his excess winnings.

The five-day record remained a net record until 2019, because of rule changes in 2001 regarding the value of clues, and in 2003 eliminating the five-appearance limit. Contestants must win $205,194 in their first five days in order to break Spangenberg&#x27;s record. Only one contestant (James Holzhauer, winning $298,687 in five days) has done so.

Shortly after he won his first five games in 1990, he appeared on &quot;Late Night with David Letterman&quot; and played the &quot;Jeopardy!&quot; home game on the show with Letterman. He would also later appear on its successor program, &quot;The Late Show&quot;, as a member of the New York City Transit Department choir.

Spangenberg also won &quot;Jeopardy!&quot;&#x27;s Tenth Anniversary Tournament in 1993, winning $41,800, and earlier won $5,000 as a semifinalist in the 1990 version of the annual Tournament of Champions, won $5,000 as a quarterfinalist on the 1990 &quot;Super Jeopardy!&quot;, then later won $10,000 as a quarterfinalist on the 2002 &quot;Jeopardy!&quot; Million Dollar Masters, then $105,199 on the 2005 &quot;Jeopardy!&quot; Ultimate Tournament of Champions, and finally (as of 2019) $5,000 as a first-round participant in 2014&#x27;s &quot;Jeopardy!&quot; Battle of the Decades tournament, bringing his lifetime &quot;Jeopardy!&quot;-related winnings (regular game and tournaments) to $274,596.

In 2007, Spangenberg was one of 16 former game show contestants invited to participate in GSN&#x27;s &quot;Grand Slam&quot; tournament. Seeded 12th, Spangenberg was matched up with former United States Navy officer David Legler, who had won a then-record setting $1.765 million on &quot;Twenty One&quot; in 2000. Spangenberg won only one of the three rounds against Legler and lost after his allotted time ran out.

===City Council candidacy===
Spangenberg was a candidate for the 19th district of the New York City Council in 2021. He was in the Democratic Party primary to replace term-limited Paul Vallone that occurred on June 22, 2021.

&quot;NOTE: The largest regular play winnings record is based only on a contestant&#x27;s first five days (until 2003, contestants were retired after five wins), and contestants must reach $205,194 in their first five days to break the record (in 2001 clue values doubled).&quot;</text><links>

<doc id="843164" wikidata="Q6683804" url="?curid=843164" title="Lost (2001 TV series)">
<text>Lost is a reality television show screened in the United States and United Kingdom in late 2001. It is a race format where teams are placed around the world with few or no resources and have to travel their way back to a &quot;finish line&quot; location.

==Premise==
The premise was similar to &quot;The Amazing Race&quot;, except the three two-member teams knew only the final destination (thousands of miles away) and were given only a backpack full of clothes and other essentials. In addition, team members were not acquainted with one another prior to the show and were assigned to teams. Contestants were blindfolded and dropped off with a single camera person in a remote location of an unknown country to find their way back to their home country.

==American version==

The American version of the show was produced by Conaco, a production company owned by Conan O&#x27;Brien. Sports broadcaster Al Trautwig was the narrator.

===Format===
Teams were given no money until they managed to figure out what country they were in. During the first set, the teams were abandoned in Mongolia. In the second set, the teams were abandoned in Bolivia. It was revealed in the second set that there was more to the show than just getting to the destination. The contestants had to go back via a particular island, making the quest more arbitrary. The first team to reach the U.S. finish line at the Statue of Liberty in New York City would split U.S. $200,000.

===Episodes===

First drop-off:
*Carla and Lando – winners

*Dan, 27, Investment Banker
*Donna, 29, Waitress
*Fred, 22, College Student
*Laurie, 22, Recent college grad, California
*Veronica, 41, Business Owner

===Broadcast===
With the show premiering to dismal ratings, only two of the three sets of three episodes were produced; NBC blamed the lackluster numbers on the show debuting just before the September 11, 2001, attacks. The first set debuted on September 4, 2001. The winners from the first set were announced on the final episode, airing a week later than scheduled (due to the 9/11 attacks pre-empting the airing of the second episode). While the second set was set to debut the next week, NBC put the show on hiatus. On December 23, 2001, the second set of episodes began airing on NBC in a new 7:00 p.m. ET Sunday timeslot. Although the final two episodes of the second set were initially scheduled to air in a two-hour block the following week, NBC decided to skip the second episode of the set, and only aired the final episode in a one-hour timeslot, due to the previous episode having one of the lowest ratings in the network&#x27;s history.

The series debuted the night before &quot;The Amazing Race&quot; on rival CBS.

==British version==

The British version of the show was produced for Channel 4 by Windfall Films and shown in October 2001. In the United Kingdom, the show was narrated by Mat Fraser.

===Format===
Five sets of three episodes were broadcast in which teams were abandoned in the Solovetsky Islands in Northwest Russia, Mali in West Africa near Timbuktu, near Mount Roraima in Venezuela, the province of Quebec in Canada, and the former Soviet republic of Azerbaijan. The UK teams had to race back to Nelson&#x27;s Column in Trafalgar Square, London, except in the final race from Azerbaijan, where the destination was the Angel of the North statue in Gateshead. The first team to arrive at the destination in each race won a prize of £5,000. The winning team from each race was brought back to compete again the following week as returning champions. They compete against two new teams. A 320-paged book detailing the series, written by Nikki Arend (wife of producer Robert Davis), accompanied the series.

Each team member and camera person was provided at the start with three days&#x27; food and water and a small amount of money. In the first two races the participants were given U.S. $200 cash each. For the third race from Venezuela the funds were in the form of an amount of gold and uncut diamonds roughly equivalent to £150. In the fourth race the cash was reduced to U.S. $150. For the final race from Azerbaijan the funds were reduced again, to only $80.

===Episodes===
====1 to 3====
DROP 1: Anzer, one of the Solovetsky islands in Russia, making up the Solovki archipelago in the White Sea, 150 km from the Arctic Circle. Their final destination was Nelson&#x27;s Column, Trafalgar Square, London. This, the series pilot, was filmed between 26 August and 2 September 2000.

;Results
*1st place: Melissa (&#x27;Mel&#x27;) Moore (aged 22, from Manchester) and Ruth Wagstaff (aged 33, from Liverpool) with cameraman Alastair Cook (aged 29). They won the race by reaching Nelson&#x27;s Column in Trafalgar Square, London, on day 7.
*2nd place: Camron (&#x27;Herbtree&#x27;) John (aged 40, from London) and Tom Lawton (aged 24, from Somerset) with cameraman Neil Harvey (aged 33).
*3rd place: Charlie McFall (aged 38, from London) and Sarah Hemming (aged 25, from Wales) with cameraman Matt Broad (aged 34).

====4 to 6====
DROP 2: Sahara desert, north of Timbuktu, Mali, West Africa. Once the teams determined which country they had been dropped off in, they were instructed to make their way to Dakar, Senegal, where they would be given onward flights to an undisclosed destination (Casablanca, Morocco). Their final destination was Nelson&#x27;s Column, Trafalgar Square, London.

;Results
*1st place: James Maby (aged 28, from London / France) and Harriet Bulwer-Long (aged 23, from London) with cameraman Will Dawes (aged 32). They won the race by reaching Nelson&#x27;s Column in Trafalgar Square, London, on day 9.
*2nd place: Nana Amoatemaa-Appiah (aged 29, from London) and Stuart Lewington (aged 26, from Middlesex) with cameraman Luke Menges (aged 31).
*Abandoned race: Melissa (&#x27;Mel&#x27;) Moore (aged 22, from Manchester) and Ruth Wagstaff (aged 33, from Liverpool), the winners of Drop 1, with cameraman Iain MacDonald (aged 30). They abandoned the race in Casablanca, Morocco, on day 12, on being told by British Airways staff in Casablanca that the other two teams had begged for and received free flights to London some days earlier (James and Harriet from Malaga, Spain; Nana and Stuart from Casablanca). Mel and Ruth had the most authentic journey, travelling the entire route as far as Dakar over land, unlike both other teams who undertook most of the journey on free flights (resulting in a ban on flights not expressly authorised by the production team in subsequent drops).

====7 to 9====
DROP 3: La Gran Sabana (The Grand Savannah), Venezuela. Once the teams determined which country they had been dropped off in, they were instructed to make their way to the Caribbean island of Martinique, West Indies, where they would be given partial funds for flights back to the United Kingdom. Their final destination was Nelson&#x27;s Column, Trafalgar Square, London.

;Results
*1st place: James Maby (aged 28, from London / France) and Harriet Bulwer-Long (aged 23, from London), the winners of Drop 2, with cameraman Simon Egan (aged 34). They won the race by reaching Nelson&#x27;s Column in Trafalgar Square, London, on day 14.
*2nd place: Kate Andrews (aged 24, from London) and Elizabeth (&#x27;Liz&#x27;) Hoselitz (aged 24, from Bristol), with cameraman Phil Stebbing (aged 40).
*Abandoned race: Clay Pegus (aged 29, from London) and Andrew (&#x27;Andy&#x27;) Boon (aged 36, from London), with cameraman Ben Anthony (aged 33). They abandoned the race on the Caribbean island of Margarita, on day 11, at the prospect of facing a long boat journey in a confined unhygienic space.

====10 to 12====
DROP 4: Near St Augustin, Cote-Nord, Eastern Quebec, Canada. Once the teams determined which country they had been dropped off in, they were instructed to make their way to Venice Beach, Los Angeles, USA, to collect partial funds for tickets to return to the United Kingdom. Their final destination was Nelson&#x27;s Column, Trafalgar Square, London.

;Results
*1st place: Katherine (&#x27;Mags&#x27;) Allen (aged 27, from Leeds) and Paul Riley (aged 34, from London), with cameraman Dimitri Doganis (aged 29). They won the race by reaching Nelson&#x27;s Column in Trafalgar Square, London, on day 12.
*2nd place: James Maby (aged 28, from London / France), the winner of Drops 2 &amp; 3, and Sarah Laing (aged 22, from London), with cameraman Misha Manson-Smith (aged 28). Harriet Bulwer-Long, who, with James Maby, won Drops 2 &amp; 3, declined to participate in Drop 4 due to work commitments and was replaced by Sarah Laing.
*3rd place: Suo San (&#x27;Suz&#x27;) Tsang (aged 27, from Colchester, Essex) and Rehan (&#x27;Ray&#x27;) Ali (aged 32, from Manchester), with cameraman Tim Knight (aged 33).

====13 to 15====
DROP 5: Near Siazan in northern Azerbaijan. Once the teams determined which country they had been dropped off in, they were instructed to make their way to Baku (the capital of Azerbaijan). On reaching Baku, they were then instructed to travel via Iran into Turkey (because, of the countries bordering Azerbaijan, they were only provided with visas for Iran whilst in Baku). From Turkey the teams could choose their own route back to the United Kingdom. Use of international flights was not permitted, and neither was obtaining assistance from family and friends (the latter condition being applied after teams obtained help, including financial help, from family and friends during Drop 4). In a change from all previous drops, their final destination in Drop 5 was The Angel of the North, in Gateshead, Tyne and Wear, England.

;Results
*1st place: Katherine (&#x27;Mags&#x27;) Allen (aged 27, from Leeds) and Paul Riley (aged 34, from London), the winners of Drop 4, with cameraman Finn McGough (aged 29). They won the race by reaching The Angel of the North, in Gateshead, Tyne and Wear, on day 10.
*2nd place: Sharon Singh (aged 22, from Liverpool) and Henrietta (&#x27;Henri&#x27;) Tatham (aged 32, from London), with cameraman Barnaby (&#x27;Barney&#x27;) Snow (aged 35).
*Abandoned race: Paul (&#x27;Paul-Stuart&#x27;) Robertson (aged 22, from Glasgow) and Bruce Fraser (aged 37, from Wisbech), with cameraman Ben Anthony (aged 33). They abandoned the race in Istanbul, Turkey, on day 8, because Paul-Stuart decided he did not wish to continue.

===Broadcast===
Scheduling of the program in a late night slot meant it reached only a limited audience. The UK version was repeated on a cable channel a few months after the first showing.

<text>Angela Franziska Johanna Hammitzsch (née Hitler; 28 July 1883 – 30 October 1949) was the elder half-sister of Adolf Hitler. She was the mother of Geli Raubal by her first husband, Leo Raubal Sr.

== Life ==
Angela Hitler was born in Braunau am Inn, Austria-Hungary, the second child of Alois Hitler and his second wife, Franziska Matzelsberger. Her mother died the following year. She and her brother Alois Hitler, Jr. were brought up by their father and his third wife Klara Pölzl. Her half-brother, Adolf Hitler, was born six years after her, and they grew very close. She is the only one of his siblings mentioned in &quot;Mein Kampf&quot;.

Angela&#x27;s father died in 1903, and her stepmother died in 1907, leaving a small inheritance. On 14 September 1903, she married Leo Raubal (11 June 1879 – 10 August 1910), a junior tax inspector, and gave birth to a son, Leo on 12 October 1906. On 4 June 1908, Angela gave birth to Geli and in 1910 to a second daughter, Elfriede (Elfriede Maria Hochegger, 10 January 1910 – 24 September 1993). Her husband died in 1910.

===Widow===
She moved to Vienna following World War I. Walter Langer&#x27;s wartime report &quot;The Mind of Adolf Hitler&quot;, an OSS profile of the Hitler family, paints a positive picture of Angela at this period, describing her as &quot;rather a decent and industrious person&quot;. It says she became manager of Mensa Academia Judaica, a boarding house for Jewish students, where she once defended those in her care against anti-Semitic rioters. According to Langer: &quot;Some of our informants knew her during this time and report that in the student riots Angela defended the Jewish students from attack and on several occasions beat the Aryan students away from the steps of the dining hall with a club. She is a rather large, strong peasant type of person who is well able to take an active part.&quot;

Angela had heard nothing from Adolf for a decade when he re-established contact with her in 1919. In 1924, Adolf was confined in Landsberg; Angela made the trip from Vienna to visit him. In 1928, she and Geli moved to the Haus Wachenfeld at Obersalzberg near Berchtesgaden, where she became his housekeeper and later was put in charge of the household at Hitler&#x27;s expanded retreat. Geli committed suicide in 1931.

Angela continued to work for her half-brother following Geli&#x27;s death, but she strongly disapproved of Hitler&#x27;s relationship with Eva Braun. She eventually left Berchtesgaden as a result and moved to Dresden.

===Remarriage===
On 18 February 1936, Angela married architect Professor Martin Hammitzsch (22 May 1878 – 12 May 1945), who designed the Yenidze cigarette factory in Dresden and who later became the director of the State School of Building Construction in that city. 

On 26 June 1936, the couple returned to Passau. When they visited the house at the Inn river where Angela had lived as a child, they left an entry in the visitors&#x27; book, which the local newspaper reported.

Adolf Hitler apparently disapproved of the marriage, and referred to his half-sister as Frau Hammitzsch. It seems that Hitler re-established contact with her during World War II because Angela remained his intermediary to the rest of the family, with whom he did not want any contact. In 1941, she sold her memoirs of her years with Hitler to the Eher-Verlag, which brought her .

In spring 1945, after the destruction of Dresden in the massive air raid of February 13-14, Adolf Hitler moved Angela to Berchtesgaden to avoid her being captured by the Soviets. He also lent her and his younger sister Paula over . In Hitler’s will, he guaranteed Angela a pension of monthly from his personal wealth bequeathed to the German state. It is uncertain if she ever received any payments because Hitler&#x27;s Swiss bank account was frozen until the 1990s, and much of the money was seized by the US government. Her second husband committed suicide shortly after the defeat of Germany.

===Post-war===
Adolf apparently had a low opinion of the intelligence of both his sisters, calling them &quot;stupid geese&quot;. Nevertheless, she spoke very highly of him, even after the war, and claimed that neither her brother nor she had known anything about the Holocaust. Angela Hitler died of a stroke on 30 October 1949 in Hanover.

==Family==
Angela&#x27;s son, Leo, had a son – Peter (b. 1931), a retired engineer who lives in Linz, Austria. Her daughter Elfriede married German lawyer Ernst Hochegger on 27 June 1937 in Düsseldorf; they had a son, Heiner Hochegger (born in January 1945).

== In popular culture ==
Angela Hitler is played by Helene Thimig in the 1944 film &quot;The Hitler Gang&quot;. In the miniseries &quot;&quot; (2003), she is portrayed by Julie-Ann Hassett.

In the French comedy &quot;L&#x27;as des as&quot; (1982), Angela Hitler is portrayed as the caretaker of Hitler&#x27;s Obersalzberg residence. She is played in drag by Günter Meisner, the same actor who plays Hitler.

<doc id="843189" wikidata="Q1935127" url="?curid=843189" title="Exchange value">
<text>In political economy and especially Marxian economics, exchange value () refers to one of the four major attributes of a commodity, i.e., an item or service produced for, and sold on the market, the other three attributes being use value, economic value, and price. Thus, a commodity has the following:
* a value, represented by the socially necessary labour time to produce it (Note: the first link is to a non-Marxian definition of value);
* a use value (or utility);
* an exchange value, which is the proportion at which a commodity can be exchanged for other entities;
* a price (an actual selling price, or an imputed ideal price).

These four concepts have a very long history in human thought, from Aristotle to David Ricardo, and became more clearly distinguished as the development of commercial trade progressed but have largely disappeared as four distinct concepts in modern economics.

This entry focuses on Karl Marx&#x27;s summation of the results of economic thought about exchange value.

== Exchange value and price according to Marx ==

Marx regards exchange-value as the proportion in which one commodity is exchanged for other commodities. For Marx, exchange-value is not identical to the money price of a commodity. Actual money prices (or even equilibrium prices) will only ever roughly correspond to exchange-values. The relationship between exchange-value and price is analogous to the relationship between the exact measured temperature of a room and the everyday awareness of that temperature from feeling alone. Thus, Marx did not consider the divergence between exchange-value and market outcomes as a refutation of his theoretical framework. Certain contemporary Marxian scholars have underscored this perspective, often citing the pronounced discrepancies between exchange-value and actual monetary prices in fixed assets, such as housing, as evidence of the existence and dynamics of fictitious capital.

The value of a good is determined by the socially necessary labour time required to produce it.

Marx believed that an understanding of exchange-value was necessary to explain fluctuations in price.

Exchange-value does not need to be expressed in money-prices &quot;necessarily&quot; (for example, such as in countertrade: &quot;x&quot; amount of goods &quot;p&quot; are worth &quot;y&quot; amounts of goods &quot;q&quot;). Marx makes this abundantly clear in his dialectical derivation of the forms of value in the first chapters of &quot;Das Kapital&quot; (see value-form).

It was only in the 13th century AD when the word &quot;&quot; came into use in Western Europe, its Latin root being &quot;&quot;, meaning &quot;reward, prize, value, worth&quot;, referring back to the notion of &quot;recompense&quot;, or what was given in return, the expense, wager or cost incurred when a good changed hands. Its verb meaning &quot;to set the price of&quot; was used only from the 14th century onwards.

Its evolving linguistic meanings reflect the early history of the growing cash economy and the evolution of commercial trade. Nowadays the meaning of &quot;price&quot; is obvious and self-evident, and it is assumed that prices are all one of a kind. This is with respect to how money has become used ubiquitously for nearly all transactions.

But in fact there are many different kinds of prices, some of which are actually charged, and some of which are only &quot;notional prices&quot;. Although a particular price may not refer to any real transaction, it can nevertheless influence economic behavior, as people have become accustomed to valuing and calculating exchange-value in terms of prices, using money (see real prices and ideal prices).

Elliot Goodell Ugalde, in 2024, extends this analysis through Marxian economics by emphasizing that the significant divergence between market price and exchange value, as seen in housing and other forms of fixed capital, is a hallmark indicator of fictitious capital. This distortion not only inflates asset values beyond their productive basis but also destabilizes broader economic systems. Such conditions foster speculative bubbles, exacerbate wealth inequality, and create barriers to access for essential resources like housing.

== Commodification ==
In the first chapters of &quot;Das Kapital&quot;, Marx traces out a brief logical summary of the development of the forms of trade, beginning with barter and simple exchange, and ending with a capitalistically produced commodity. This sketch of the process of &quot;marketisation&quot; shows that the commodity form is not fixed once and for all, but in fact undergoes a &quot;development&quot; as trade becomes more sophisticated, with the end result being that a commodity&#x27;s exchange-value can be expressed simply in a (notional) quantity of money (a money price).

However, the transformation of a labor-product into a commodity (its &quot;marketing&quot;) is in reality not a simple process, but has many technical and social preconditions. These often include:
* the existence of a reliable &quot;supply&quot; of a product, or at least a surplus or surplus product;
* the existence of a social need for it (a market demand) that must be met through trade, or at any event cannot be met otherwise;
* the legally sanctioned assertion of private ownership rights to the commodity and the right to trade it;
* the enforcement of these rights, so that ownership is secure;
* the transferability of these private rights from one owner to another;
* the (physical) transferability of the commodity itself, i.e., the ability to store, package, preserve and transport it from one owner to another;
* the imposition of exclusivity of access to the commodity;
* the possibility of the owner to use or consume the commodity privately;
* guarantees about the quality and safety of the commodity, and possibly a guarantee of replacement or service, should it fail to function as intended;
* the ability to produce the commodity at a cost and sale-price sufficient to yield an adequate and predictable income or profit;
* the ability to produce and trade a commodity without too much risk of a type that would undermine the business.

Thus, the commodification of a good or service often involves a considerable &quot;practical&quot; accomplishment in trade. It is a process that may be influenced not just by economic or technical factors, but also political and cultural factors, insofar as it involves property rights, claims to access to resources, and guarantees about quality or safety of use.

&quot;To trade or not to trade&quot;, that may be the question. The modern debate in this regard focuses often on intellectual property rights because ideas are increasingly becoming objects of trade, and the technology now exists to transform ideas into commodities much more easily.

In absolute terms, exchange values can also be measured as quantities of average labour-hours. By contrast, prices are normally measured in money-units. For practical purposes, prices are however usually preferable to labour-hours, as units of account, although in capitalist work processes the two are related to each other (see labor power).

== Marx&#x27;s quote on commodities and their exchange ==
Marx&#x27;s view of commodities in &quot;Capital&quot; is illustrated by the following quote:
 We have seen that when commodities are in the relation of exchange, their exchange-value manifests itself as something totally independent of their use-value. But if we abstract from their use-value, there remains their value, as has just been defined. The common factor in the exchange relation, or in the exchange-value of the commodity, is therefore its value. (Vintage/Penguin edition, p. 128, chapter 1, §1, para. 12)

This first part says that the value of commodities as they are exchanged for each other—or when stated in terms of money units, their prices—are very different from their value in use to human beings, their &quot;use-value&quot;.

Next, Marx describes how he had abstracted from the differences in use-value and thus from the concrete differences amongst commodities, looking for their shared characteristics. He famously claimed to find that what&#x27;s left is that all commodities have &quot;value&quot; (or &quot;labor-value&quot;), the abstract labor time needed to produce it. That is, all commodities are social products of labor, created and exchanged by a community, with each commodity producer contributing his or her time to the societal division of labor. Each commodity is a social product by nature.

Third, value is not the same thing as exchange-value (or price). Rather, the value is the shared characteristic of the exchange-values of all the commodities. He calls this the &quot;common factor&quot;, whereas someone else might call it the &quot;essence&quot;. In contrast, the exchange-value represents the appearance or &quot;form&quot; of expression of value in trade. Just as with used cars, the shiny appearance may differ radically from the lemony essence. In fact, one of his major themes (the theory of &quot;commodity fetishism&quot;) is that the system of commodity exchange that dominates capitalism obscures the class nature of that institution.

To Marx, the &quot;exchange value&quot; of a commodity also represents its owner&#x27;s purchasing &quot;power&quot;, the ability to &quot;command&quot; labor, i.e., the amount of labor time that is claimed in acquiring it. This aspect appears not only in the modern services economy, but in the market for tangible goods: by purchasing a good, one is gaining the results of the labor done to produce it, while one is also commanding (directing) labor to produce more of it.

== Transformation of values into prices ==
In volumes I and II of &quot;Capital&quot;, Marx usually assumed that exchange values were equal to values, and that prices were proportional to values. He was talking about overall movements and broad averages, and his interest was in the social relations of production existing behind economic exchange. However, he was quite conscious of the distinction between the empirical and microeconomic concept of prices (or exchange values) and the social concept of value. In fact he completed the draft of volume 3 of &quot;Das Kapital&quot; before he published volume 1.

Despite this, the fruitless search for a quantitative relationship allowing the logical derivation of prices from values (a labor theory of price) with the aid of mathematical functions has occupied many economists, producing the famous transformation problem literature.

If, however, prices can fluctuate above or below value for all sorts of reasons, Marx&#x27;s law of value is best seen as a &quot;law of grand averages&quot;, an overall &quot;generalisation&quot; about economic exchange, and the quantitative relationships between labour hours worked and real prices charged for an output are best expressed in &quot;probabilistic&quot; terms.

One might ask, how can &quot;value&quot; be transformed into &quot;price&quot; if a commodity by definition already has a value and a price? To understand this, one needs to recognise the &quot;process&quot; whereby products move into markets and are withdrawn from markets. Outside the market, not being offered for sale or being sold, commodities have at best a potential or hypothetical price. But for Marx prices are formed according to pre-existing product-values which are socially established prior to their exchange.

Marx sought to theorise the transformation of commodity values into prices of production within capitalism dialectically, as a &quot;moving contradiction&quot;: namely, in capitalism, the &quot;value&quot; of a commodity output produced encompassed &quot;both&quot; the equivalent of the cost of the used inputs which were initially bought to produce it, as well as a gross profit component (surplus value) which became definite and manifest only &quot;after&quot; the commodity has been sold and paid for, and after costs were deducted from sales. Value was, as it were, suspended between the past and the future.

An output with a certain value was produced, but exactly how much of that value would be subsequently realised upon sale in markets was usually not known in advance. Yet, that &quot;potential&quot; value also strongly affected the sales income that producers could get from it, and moreover that value was determined not by individual enterprises, but by all enterprises producing the same type of output for a given market demand (&quot;the state of the market&quot;). The business results of each enterprise were influenced by the overall effects created by all enterprises through their productive activity, as an ongoing process.

This simple &quot;market reality&quot; has stumped many of Marx&#x27;s interpreters though; they fail to see that value is &quot;conserved, transferred and added to&quot; by living labor, between the initial purchase of inputs with money on the one side, and the subsequent sale of outputs for more money, on the other. They see only input prices and output prices, or cost-prices and sale-prices, and not the creation of a product which already has a value &quot;prior to being exchanged&quot; at a certain price - a value which is moreover &quot;socially&quot; determined by a group of enterprises together, and which sets limits for price fluctuations.

For that reason, the whole process of the &quot;formation of value&quot; which Marx so carefully lays out, with its complex determinants, seems like an unnecessary detour from commercial wisdom. If, however, we wish to understand the &quot;deep structure&quot; of market behavior, then we rapidly confront all the issues that Marx was concerned with.

== Relation to mainstream economics ==
In modern neoclassical economics, exchange value itself is no longer explicitly theorised. The reason is that the concept of money-price is deemed sufficient in order to understand trading processes and markets. Exchange value thus becomes simply the price for which a good will trade in a given market which is identical to what Marx refers to as price. These trading processes are no longer understood in economics as social processes involving human giving and taking, getting and receiving, but as technical processes in which rational, self-interested economic actors negotiate prices based on subjective perceptions of utility. Market realities are therefore understood in terms of supply and demand curves which sets price at a level where supply equals demand. Professor John Eatwell criticizes this approach as follows:

<doc id="843191" wikidata="Q16995908" url="?curid=843191" title="Hot Potato (game show)">
<text>Hot Potato is a television game show that was broadcast on NBC in the United States from January 23 to June 29, 1984. From April 23 until its conclusion, the show was known as Celebrity Hot Potato.

Bill Cullen was the show&#x27;s host, his final hosting job for a network series, and Charlie O&#x27;Donnell was the announcer. Cullen remarked that he had been chosen to host largely by default, since the originally intended host had flopped during an early run-through of the game and neither Barry &amp; Enright nor NBC could think of anyone else to ask. He also noted that this scenario had occurred repeatedly during his career, resulting in many of his credits as a game show host.

The series was produced by Barry &amp; Enright Productions, the company&#x27;s first for NBC since the company was a central figure in the 1950s quiz show scandals. &quot;Hot Potato&quot; was the first game mounted for a network by Barry &amp; Enright since 1976&#x27;s &quot;Break the Bank&quot; aired on ABC, the last one the company did not produce exclusively for syndication, and the last original production Jack Barry was a part of; he died on May 2, 1984, a little more than a week after &quot;Hot Potato&quot; made the switch to the celebrity format. 

&quot;Hot Potato&quot; took over the noon ET timeslot from &quot;Go&quot; and did not perform well in the ratings, beaten by &quot;Family Feud&quot; on ABC and frequently pre-empted for local news in most larger markets. Reruns of &quot;Diff&#x27;rent Strokes&quot; took over that time slot for the rest of the summer.

==Gameplay==
Two teams of three players competed, one of which consisted of the previous game&#x27;s champions. The members of each team shared a common trait (hobby, occupation, etc.). All questions used during the main game had at least seven correct answers. Some were trivia questions with a set number of factual answers – for example, naming the Seven Wonders of the Ancient World – while others required the players to guess the most common responses to a survey, similar to &quot;Family Feud&quot;.

In each round, Cullen asked a question and stated the number of acceptable answers. One member of the team with initial control started by either giving an answer or challenging an opponent to do so. If the player gave a correct answer, control passed to the next team member in line. An incorrect response sent the player to a bench behind the team&#x27;s podium, where he/she had to sit out the rest of the round, and gave control to the opposing team. If an opponent responded correctly after being challenged, his/her team took control and the challenging player was eliminated. If not, the opponent was eliminated and control passed to the player after the one who issued the challenge.

As the players gave correct answers, they were displayed on-screen for the viewers&#x27; benefit. Once five answers had been given, Cullen would read them back to the players. A player would be cautioned if he/she repeated a previous answer; doing so twice on the same turn sent him/her to the bench.

A team could win a round either by giving the seventh correct answer (regardless of who gave the first six), or by eliminating all three opponents through successful challenges and/or their own mistakes. The first team to win two rounds won $1,000, took/retained the championship, and advanced to the bonus round. The champions started the first round (and the third, if necessary), while the challengers started the second.

Beginning on February 6, 1984, a &quot;Seven Straight Jackpot&quot; was offered to any team that gave seven correct answers in a row without making a mistake or challenging. The jackpot started at $500 and increased by that amount for each match it was not won.

&quot;Celebrity Hot Potato&quot; followed the same rules, but teams were composed either of three celebrities, or two celebrities and one civilian contestant. In the former case, teams that lost in the main game received $500 for a chosen charity; in the latter, all winnings went to the contestant. The Seven Straight Jackpot was discontinued for all episodes played under this format.

===Bonus game===
The winning team was given a subject of comparison (e.g., which weighs more, who has been married more times, etc.) and shown two possible choices. The team discussed the choices and then selected one of them. Each correct response awarded $500; a mistake at any time ended the round and forfeited the accumulated money. The team could pass on one question, and could stop after any question and keep the money. If they answered five questions correctly, they won a jackpot that began at $5,000 and increased by that amount for every game in which it went unclaimed. The jackpot reset to $5,000 when collected or whenever a defending champion team was defeated in the main game.

Teams continued to appear on the show until they either lost the main game or had played the bonus round five times.

On &quot;Celebrity Hot Potato&quot;, the jackpot was a flat $5,000 and did not increase. All-celebrity teams that lost in this round received $1,000 for their charity.

==Episode status==
The series reran on CBN, USA Network and Game Show Network in the past. A studio master of the first episode is available for viewing on YouTube.

<doc id="843192" wikidata="Q1918011" url="?curid=843192" title="Nephroid">
<text>In geometry, a nephroid () is a specific plane curve. It is a type of epicycloid in which the smaller circle&#x27;s radius differs from the larger one by a factor of one-half.

==Name==
Although the term &quot;nephroid&quot; was used to describe other curves, it was applied to the curve in this article by Richard A. Proctor in 1878.

==Strict definition ==
A nephroid is 
* an algebraic curve of degree 6. 
* an epicycloid with two cusps 
* a plane simple closed curve = a Jordan curve

=== Equations ===
====Parametric====

If the small circle has radius formula_1, the fixed circle has midpoint formula_2 and radius formula_3, the rolling angle of the small circle is formula_4 and point formula_5 the starting point (see diagram) then one gets the parametric representation:
:formula_6
:formula_7

The complex map formula_8 maps the unit circle to a nephroid

=====Proof of the parametric representation=====
The proof of the parametric representation is easily done by using complex numbers and their representation as complex plane. The movement of the small circle can be split into two rotations. In the complex plane a rotation of a point formula_9 around point formula_10 (origin) by an angle formula_11 can be performed by the multiplication of point formula_9 (complex number) by formula_13. Hence the 
:rotation formula_14 around point formula_15 by angle formula_4 is formula_17 ,
:rotation formula_18 around point formula_10 by angle formula_11 is formula_21.

A point formula_22 of the nephroid is generated by the rotation of point formula_3 by formula_14 and the subsequent rotation with formula_18:
:formula_26.
Herefrom one gets
:formula_27 
(The formulae formula_28 were used. See trigonometric functions.)

====Implicit ====
Inserting formula_29 and formula_30 into the equation
*formula_31
shows that this equation is an implicit representation of the curve.

=====Proof of the implicit representation=====
With
:formula_32
one gets
:formula_33

==Orientation ==
If the cusps are on the y-axis the parametric representation is 
:formula_34
and the implicit one:
:formula_35

== Metric properties ==
For the nephroid above the
*arclength is formula_36
*area formula_37 and
*radius of curvature is formula_38
The proofs of these statements use suitable formulae on curves (arc length, area and radius of curvature) and the parametric representation above
:formula_39
:formula_40
and their derivatives 
:formula_41
:formula_42

;Proof for the arc length:
:formula_43 .

;Proof for the area:
:formula_44 .

;Proof for the radius of curvature:
:formula_45
==Construction==
* It can be generated by rolling a circle with radius formula_1 on the outside of a fixed circle with radius formula_3. Hence, a nephroid is an epicycloid.

=== Nephroid as envelope of a pencil of circles ===
*Let be formula_48 a circle and formula_49 points of a diameter formula_50, then the envelope of the pencil of circles, which have midpoints on formula_48 and are touching formula_50 is a &quot;nephroid&quot; with cusps formula_49.

====Proof====
Let formula_48 be the circle formula_55 with midpoint formula_2 and radius formula_3. The diameter may lie on the x-axis (see diagram). The pencil of circles has equations:
:formula_58
The envelope condition is
:formula_59
One can easily check that the point of the nephroid formula_60 is a solution of the system formula_61 and hence a point of the envelope of the pencil of circles.

=== Nephroid as envelope of a pencil of lines ===
Similar to the generation of a cardioid as envelope of a pencil of lines the following procedure holds:
# Draw a circle, divide its perimeter into equal spaced parts with formula_62 points (see diagram) and number them consecutively.
# Draw the chords: formula_63. (i.e.: The second point is moved by threefold velocity.)
# The &quot;envelope&quot; of these chords is a nephroid.

====Proof====
The following consideration uses trigonometric formulae for
formula_64. In order to keep the calculations simple, the proof is given for the nephroid with cusps on the y-axis.
&quot;Equation of the tangent&quot;: for the nephroid with parametric representation 
:formula_65: 
Herefrom one determines the normal vector formula_66, at first.

The equation of the tangent formula_67 is:
:formula_68
For formula_69 one gets the cusps of the nephroid, where there is no tangent. For formula_70 one can divide by formula_71 to obtain
*formula_72

&quot;Equation of the chord&quot;: to the circle with midpoint formula_2 and radius formula_74: The equation of the chord containing the two points formula_75 is:
:formula_76
For formula_77 the chord degenerates to a point. For formula_78 one can divide by formula_79 and gets the equation of the chord:
*formula_80
The two angles formula_81 are defined differently (formula_11 is one half of the rolling angle, formula_83 is the parameter of the circle, whose chords are determined), for formula_84 one gets the same line. Hence any chord from the circle above is tangent to the nephroid and 
* &quot;the nephroid is the envelope of the chords of the circle.&quot;

=== Nephroid as caustic of one half of a circle ===

The considerations made in the previous section give a proof for the fact, that the caustic of one half of a circle is a nephroid.

* If in the plane parallel light rays meet a reflecting half of a circle (see diagram), then the reflected rays are tangent to a nephroid.

====Proof====
The circle may have the origin as midpoint (as in the previous section) and its 
radius is formula_74. The circle has the parametric representation 
:formula_86
The tangent at the circle point formula_87 has normal vector formula_88. The reflected ray has the normal vector (see diagram) formula_89 and containing circle point formula_90. Hence the reflected ray is part of the line with equation 
:formula_91
which is tangent to the nephroid of the previous section at point 
:formula_92 (see above).

== The evolute and involute of a nephroid ==
=== Evolute ===
The evolute of a curve is the locus of centers of curvature. In detail: For a curve formula_93 with radius of curvature formula_94 the evolute has the representation
:formula_95
with formula_96 the suitably oriented unit normal.

For a nephroid one gets: 
*The &quot;evolute&quot; of a nephroid is another nephroid half as large and rotated 90 degrees (see diagram).

====Proof====
The nephroid as shown in the picture has the parametric representation
:formula_97
the unit normal vector pointing to the center of curvature 
:formula_98 (see section above)
and the radius of curvature formula_99 (s. section on metric properties).
Hence the evolute has the representation:
:formula_100
:formula_101 
which is a nephroid half as large and rotated 90 degrees (see diagram and section above)

=== Involute ===
Because the evolute of a nephroid is another nephroid, the involute of the nephroid is also another nephroid. The original nephroid in the image is the involute of the smaller nephroid.

== Inversion of a nephroid ==
The inversion 
:formula_102 
across the circle with midpoint formula_2 and radius formula_3 maps the nephroid with equation 
:formula_31 
onto the curve of degree 6 with equation 
: formula_106 (see diagram) .

<text>Little Torrington is a village and a civil parish near Great Torrington, in the Torridge district, north Devon, England. In 2001 the population of the civil parish of Little Torrington was 420 and in 2011 it was 376, according to census data. Little Torrington has the Church of St Giles and the Chapel of St Mary Magdalene.

In the 1870s, Little Torrington was described as follows:&quot;A bridge over the river Torridge, at Taddyport village, connects the parish with Great Torrington. The living is a rectory in the diocese of Exeter. Value, £397. Patrons, the Heirs of Lord Rolle and others. The church is ancient but good.&quot;

== History ==
Little Torrington was originally a Saxon settlement called Toritona, held by Edmer Ator during the reign of Edward the Confessor between 1042–1066.

At the time of the Norman Invasion of England in 1066, Alweard the Red was lord and tenant. By 1086 Little Torrington was considered a large settlement for its time with 33 households. It had a new overlord, Count Rotbert of Mortrain, the uterine half-brother of William the Conqueror. The local tenant-in-chief was also from the Norman elite, &quot;Aluredus le butuiller&quot; (Alfred the Butler).

The first vicar for the church was recorded in 1259, although the current church of St Giles was created in the 15th century.
Renovations have taken place on the church throughout its time. The first major renovation took place in 1755, when it was re-roofed in a Georgian style. In 1857, the nave and south aisle were restored, the western gallery removed, and the chancel rebuilt and enlarged. Finally, in 1898, restoration work was carried out on the tower, and a tower screen and new pews were added to the interior of the church.

Little Torrington, along with Great Torrington, had a significant role in the English Civil War; the Battle of Torrington in 1646 marked the end of Royalist resistance in the region.

The population of Little Torrington fluctuated between 1801 and 2011 according to census data. In 1801 it was 449, and from then the population continued to grow, reaching a peak of 623 residents in 1851. The population then fell and reached its lowest recorded level of 281 in 1961. The population in 2011 had recovered to 376 people.

== Industry ==

The first census divided the working men into two different categories, those &quot;chiefly employed in agriculture&quot; and those &quot;chiefly employed in trade, manufacturers or handicraft&quot;. This increased to nine categories in 1831, with the majority of Little Torrington&#x27;s men aged 20 and over working in agriculture.


The 1881 census showed more work categories for both men and women. Agriculture remained the main industry for men, and dressmaking for women; the second largest category for both genders was domestic and office services. 
As of 2011, 189 of 376 Little Torrington residents were employed. The highest areas of employment were agriculture, forestry, fishing and manufacturing.

== Geography ==

The village is located east of the A386, contains &quot;2880 acres of land, including the village of Taddiport, on the south-west side of the river Torridge opposite Great Torrington.&quot;

&quot;Taddiport is a hamlet beside the Torridge, which is here crossed by a massive three-arched bridge, possibly of 17th century date. A chapel, attached to a leper hospital founded in the 13th century, still remains, though considerably altered.&quot;

The majority of current residents, according to the 2011 census, live in whole houses or bungalows, 106 households live in detached properties and 55 households live in semi-detached properties, with only 2 households living in flats or apartments.

<doc id="843195" wikidata="Q1187865" url="?curid=843195" title="Titan IIIC">
<text>The Titan IIIC was an expendable launch system used by the United States Air Force from 1965 until 1982. It was the first Titan booster to feature large solid rocket motors and was planned to be used as a launcher for the Dyna-Soar, though the spaceplane was cancelled before it could fly. The majority of the launcher&#x27;s payloads were DoD satellites, for military communications and early warning, though one flight (ATS-6) was performed by NASA. The Titan IIIC was launched exclusively from Cape Canaveral while its sibling, the Titan IIID, was launched only from Vandenberg AFB.

==History==
The Titan rocket family was established in October 1955 when the Air Force awarded the Glenn L. Martin Company (later Martin Marietta and now Lockheed Martin) a contract to build an intercontinental ballistic missile (SM-68). It became known as the Titan I, the nation&#x27;s first two-stage ICBM, and replaced the Atlas ICBM as the second underground, vertically stored, silo-based ICBM. Both stages of the Titan I used kerosene (RP-1) and liquid oxygen (LOX) as propellants. A subsequent version of the Titan family, the Titan II, was similar to the Titan I, but was much more powerful. Designated as LGM-25C, the Titan II was the largest USAF missile at the time and burned Aerozine 50 and nitrogen tetroxide (NTO) rather than RP-1 and LOX.

The Titan III family consisted of an enhanced Titan II core with or without solid rocket strap-on boosters and an assortment of upper stages. All Solid Rocket Motor (SRM)-equipped Titans (IIIC, IIID, IIIE, 34D, and IV) launched with only the SRMs firing at liftoff, the core stage not activating until T+105 seconds, shortly before SRM jettison. The Titan IIIA (an early test variant flown in 1964–65) and IIIB (flown from 1966 to 1987 with an Agena D upper stage in both standard and extended tank variants) had no SRMs. The Titan III launchers provided assured capability and flexibility for launch of large-class payloads.

All Titan II/III/IV vehicles contained a special range safety system known as the Inadvertent Separation Destruction System (ISDS) that would activate and destroy the first stage if there was a premature second stage separation. Titans that carried Solid Rocket Boosters (SRBs) (Titan IIIC, IIID, 34D, and IV) had a second ISDS that consisted of several lanyards attached to the SRBs that would trigger and automatically destroy them if they prematurely separated from the core, said &quot;destruction&quot; consisting mainly of splitting the casings open to release the pressure inside and terminate thrust. The ISDS would end up being used a few times over the Titan&#x27;s career.

Another slight modification to SRB-equipped Titans was the first stage engines being covered instead of the open truss structure on the Titan II/IIIA/IIIB. This was to protect the engines from the heat of the SRB exhaust.

Titan III/IV SRBs were fixed nozzle and for roll control, a small tank of nitrogen tetroxide was mounted to each motor. The would be injected into the SRB exhaust to deflect it in the desired direction.

As the IIIC consisted of mostly proven hardware, launch problems were generally only caused by the upper stages and/or payload. The second launch in October 1965 failed when the Transtage suffered an oxidizer leak and was unable to put its payload (several small satellites) into the correct orbit. The third launch in December experienced a similar failure.

The fourth IIIC launch was used to send the LES 4 (Lincoln Experimental Satellite 4) into orbit. It was a US Air Force experimental communications satellite launched along with OV2-3, LES 3, and Oscar 4 from Cape Canaveral aboard a single Titan 3C rocket. It transmitted in X-band.

The fifth Titan IIIC (August 26, 1966) failed shortly after launch when pieces of the payload fairing started breaking off. Around 80 seconds, the remainder of the shroud disintegrated, causing loss of launch vehicle control as well as the payload (a group of IDCSP satellites intended to provide radio communication for the US Army in Vietnam). The ISDS activated automatically when one of the SRBs broke away from the stack and destroyed the entire launch vehicle. The exact reason for the shroud failure was not determined, but the fiberglass payload shrouds used on the Titan III up to this point were replaced with a metal shroud afterwards.

A Titan IIIC in November 1970 failed to place its missile early warning satellite in the correct orbit due to a Transtage failure and a 1975 launch of two DSCS II military communication satellites left in LEO by another Transtage failure.

On March 25, 1978, a launch of two DSCS II satellites ended up in the Atlantic Ocean when the Titan second stage hydraulic pump failed, resulting in engine shutdown approximately 470 seconds after launch. The Range Safety destruct command was sent, but it was unclear if the stage received it or if it had already broken up by that point.

The first Titan IIIC flew on June 18, 1965, and was the most powerful launcher used by the Air Force until it was replaced by the Titan 34D in 1982. The last IIIC was launched in March 1982.

==Design==
The Titan IIIC weighed about at liftoff and consisted of a two-stage Titan core and upper stage called the Titan Transtage, both burning hypergolic liquid fuel, and two large UA1205 solid rocket motors.

The solid motors were ignited on the ground and were designated &quot;stage 0&quot;. Each motor composed of five segments and was in diameter, long, and weighed nearly . They produced a combined thrust at sea level and burned for approximately 115 seconds. Solid motor jettison occurred at approximately 116 seconds.

The first core stage ignited about 5 seconds before SRM jettison. Designated the Titan 3A-1, this stage was powered by a twin nozzle Aerojet LR-87-AJ9 engine that burned about of Aerozine 50 and nitrogen tetroxide (NTO) and produced thrust over 147 seconds. The Aerozine 50 and NTO were stored in structurally independent tanks to minimize the hazard of the two mixing if a leak should have developed in either tank.

The second core stage, the Titan 3A-2, contained about of propellant and was powered by a single Aerojet LR-91-AJ9, which produced for 145 seconds.

The upper stage, the Titan Transtage, also burned Aerozine 50 and NTO. Its two Aerojet AJ-10-138 engines were restartable, allowing flexible orbital operations including orbital trimming, geostationary transfer and insertion, and delivery of multiple payloads to different orbits. This required complex guidance and instrumentation. Transtage contained about of propellant and its engines delivered .

<text>Hatherleigh is a small market town in the West Devon district, in the county of Devon, England. In 2011 the parish had a population of 1306.
It hosts an arts festival in July, and a carnival in November featuring two flaming tar barrel runs. The Walruses meet on New Year&#x27;s Day to jump into the River Lew to raise money for local good causes, this tradition which started in the 1980s came to end on 1 January 2018. An annual half-marathon called the Ruby Run takes place usually in June between Holsworthy and Hatherleigh, starting from each town in alternate years.

Hatherleigh Market has weekly sales of sheep, cattle and poultry with increased sales on Tuesdays. It is the smallest town in Devon. The market formally closed in February 2018 due to the site being sold to make way for a new housing development, the Tuesday pannier market continues and there will be provision and a new building in the development. In September 2019 the demolition of the site began as of March 2020 only one building of the market remains to temporary house the pannier market, the new development is moving at pace with many of the new buildings now rising from the ground.

Hatherleigh is home to two pubs, The Tally Ho and The George. The George was burned down in an arson attack on 23 December 2008 and has subsequently been rebuilt and re-opened in 2010. More than 100 firefighters from across the county were drafted in to help fight the blaze which was still burning well into the early hours of Christmas Eve. Hatherleigh also has a cafe, two hairdressers, craft shops, a beauty salon, a butcher, a newsagency, a vets, medical centre, a convenience shop and a petrol station.

The parish church is dedicated to St John the Baptist and has a western tower topped by a shingled spire. The spire was destroyed in the Burns&#x27; Day Storm of 1990 and a replica of the original now stands in its place. The nave and aisles are divided by granite arcades. The font is Norman and the original wagon roofs remain. Since 2024, a disused vestry in the church grounds has housed a gymnasium.

An impressive obelisk one mile (1.6 km) east of the town commemorates Lt Col. William Morris (d. 1858 in India): it was built in 1860.

Hatherleigh was the beginning of the 7th stage of the Tour of Britain in September 2009 and record numbers turned out to watch the famous race begin. Hatherleigh had often been on the course of the Tour but this was the first time a stage had started in the town.

Hatherleigh saw the Olympic torch pass through the town on 21 May 2012.

There is an electoral ward with the same name. The population at the 2011 census was 2,218.

There is no railway station within Hatherleigh&#x27;s boundaries. However residents can use the nearby railway station in Okehampton now that the Dartmoor Line has reopened with regular services to Exeter.

The village is part of the Ruby Country which covers 45 parishes around the market towns of Holsworthy and Hatherleigh. These two towns were at the centre of the 2001 Foot and Mouth Disease outbreak, and although agriculture was directly affected, most local businesses suffered considerable financial hardship. As a result, the Ruby Country Initiative was established, a not for profit partnership, to help create a more robust and sustainable local economy, and to create an identity for the area.

<doc id="843202" wikidata="Q732969" url="?curid=843202" title="Double majority">
<text>A double majority is a voting system which requires a majority of votes according to two separate criteria. The mechanism is usually used to require strong support for any measure considered to be of great importance. Typically in legislative bodies, a double majority requirement exists in the form of a quorum being necessary for legislation to be passed.

==Examples in use==

===Australia===
In Australia, constitutional changes must be passed at a referendum in a majority of states (4 of the 6), and by a majority of voters nationally. Prior to 1977, the votes of citizens in the Northern Territory and the ACT did not affect the national or state-based count. After a Constitution Alteration put to referendum in 1977 and given vice-regal assent on 19 July 1977, Territorial votes contribute towards the national majority, but the Territories themselves do not count towards the majority of states. An earlier referendum in 1974, where the same proposed change had been bundled with a lowering of the required number of states to a half (3 of the 6) instead of a majority, had been defeated.

===Canada===
Since the patriation of the Canadian constitution in 1982, thorough amending formulae for the constitution were adopted. Per the Constitution Act, 1982, many amendments can be passed only by the Parliament of Canada and a two-thirds majority of the provincial legislatures, those provinces together representing at least 50% of the national population-–this is known as the 7/50 formula (as there were and are 10 provinces, so 7 constitutes a two-thirds majority). Additionally, a province can explicitly choose to dissent to an amendment that &quot;derogates from the legislative powers, the proprietary rights or any other rights or privileges of the legislature or government of a province&quot;, in which case it does not apply in that province even if passed. Though not constitutionally mandated, a referendum is also considered to be necessary by some, especially following the precedent established by the Charlottetown Accord in 1992.

However, there are some parts of the constitution that can be modified only by a vote of all the provinces plus the Parliament of Canada; these include changes to the composition of the Supreme Court of Canada, changing the process for amending the constitution itself, or any act affecting the Canadian monarch or Governor General.

===European Union===
In the European Union, double majority voting replaced artificial voting weights for votes requiring a qualified majority in the Council of the European Union following implementation of the Treaty of Lisbon. A qualified majority requires 55% of voting EU member states, representing at least 65% of the population of voting members for a European Commission proposal to be approved. This increases to 72% of voting members states, representing at least 65% of the EU population of voting members should the proposal originate from a member state. Proposals can be blocked should a qualified majority of at least four Council members representing more than 35% of the EU population be formed.

=== Finland ===
Changing the constitution of Finland requires that a simple majority of the sitting Parliament vote in favor of the amendment. The amendment is postponed until the next general election. The next parliament may finally vote to ratify the amendment but by a two thirds of the MPs. Thus, a double majority of two different parliaments is usually required to pass constitutional amendments. An expedited process may however be entered if five sixths of the sitting parliament vote to declare an amendment urgent. Then, a two-thirds majority of the current parliament may ratify an amendment using the expedited process.

=== Northern Ireland ===
Under the terms of the Belfast Agreement, if 30 members or more request it, a measure may be put to a &quot;cross-community vote&quot; which requires a majority from both the Nationalist and Unionist camps.

=== Philippines ===
In the 2019 Bangsamoro autonomy plebiscite, for a place to join the Bangsamoro, it is required to have a majority for inclusion both in the place that is petitioning to be included, and from the rest of the larger entity it is originally included. For example, for the six towns from Lanao del Norte petitioning to join, a majority both from the town itself and from the rest of Lanao del Norte should be attained. Each of the six towns overwhelmingly voted for inclusion, but a majority from the rest of Lanao del Norte rejected the towns joining the Bangsamoro, leading to the towns not being included. Meanwhile, 63 of the 67 barangays (villages) in Cotabato voted for inclusion and got consent from their mother towns to join. One barangay rejected inclusion but was allowed by its mother town to join, while three barangays voted for inclusion but were rejected by their mother towns from joining; these four barangays did not join the Bangsamoro. Finally, Isabela City rejected to join, but was allowed by its mother province Basilan to join; it was also not included in the Bangsamoro.

===Romania===
In Romania, a national referendum is considered valid only if at least 50% plus one of the registered voters cast their ballot. For a valid referendum, the outcome is determined by a simple majority of valid votes cast. The whole process thus involves a double majority in form of a quorum.

A controversial amendment to the referendum law arose during the 2012 political crisis and allowed for an exception to be made in case of a referendum regarding the impeachment of the President. The original law, which required a double majority for impeachment, was modified by governmental emergency decree to circumvent the quorum requirement. This would have resulted in a successful impeachment of the President in the following referendum. The referendum was, however, subsequently invalidated by the Constitutional Court, the body responsible for overseeing the whole process, putting an end to the crisis.

=== Sudan ===
The independence referendum for South Sudan required 51% of the vote and 60% turnout.

=== Switzerland ===

In Switzerland, the passing of a constitutional amendment by popular vote requires a double majority; not only must a majority of people vote for the amendment but a majority of cantons must also give their consent. This is to prevent a larger canton from foisting amendments onto the smaller ones and vice versa.

===United States===
Double majority is used in the United States for some initiative or referendum votes on issues such as a tax levy or bond. Essentially, a double majority standard applies a two-part test to a vote outcome before a measure is passed:
* Did a majority of registered voters turn out for the election?
* Did votes in favor outnumber votes against, by the required margin?
If the answer to either of these questions is No, the measure fails.

This mechanism is used to prevent a small group from passing spending measures that affect the entire population in order to support their pet causes, especially at an election expected to have low voter turnout. Double majorities are also frequently used in municipal annexations, wherein majorities of both the residents in the annexing territory and the territory to be annexed must support the annexation. A similar rule exists for adopting metropolitan government in Tennessee, where the referendum must pass both inside and outside the principal city.

<text>Peters Marland is a small village and civil parish in the local government district of Torridge, Devon, England. The parish, which lies about four miles south of the town of Great Torrington, is surrounded clockwise from the north by the parishes of Little Torrington, Merton, Petrockstowe, Buckland Filleigh, Shebbear and Langtree. In 2001 its population was 234, down from the 286 residents it had in 1901.

In 1850 the parish was recorded as covering 2,200 acres with 351 parishioners. At that time most of the land within the parish belonged to Rev. John Moore-Stevens (died 1865), Archdeacon of Exeter, whose son was living at Winscott House in the parish; much also belonged to G. Oldham of Twigbear. Both Winscott and Twigbear are former manors that have their origins before the Norman Conquest, as also are Week and Winswell in the parish.

The parish church, in the village, is dedicated to St Peter. It was extensively restored in the 1860s by the Moore-Stevens family and is, according to W. G. Hoskins, &quot;entirely without interest&quot;.

==Industry==
Ball clay is quarried in the east of the parish, as it has been for many years. There was a brick and tile works here until 1940; many houses in Great Torrington are built of its cream-coloured bricks. The North Devon and Cornwall Junction Light Railway served the works between 1925 and 1982. Today the former railway line forms part of the Tarka Trail series of footpaths and cycle tracks.

<text>Bryn Celli Ddu () is a prehistoric site on the Welsh island of Anglesey located near Llanddaniel Fab. Its name means &#x27;the mound in the dark grove&#x27;. It was archaeologically excavated between 1928 and 1929. Visitors can get inside the mound through a stone passage to the burial chamber, and it is the centrepiece of a major Neolithic Scheduled Monument in the care of Cadw. The presence of a mysterious pillar within the burial chamber, the reproduction of the &#x27;Pattern Stone&#x27;, carved with sinuous serpentine designs, and the fact that the site was once a henge with a stone circle, and may have been used to plot the date of the summer solstice have all attracted much interest.

==The monument==
Bryn Celli Ddu is generally considered to be one of the finest passage tombs in Wales. Its passage and burial chamber are complete, and it is still buried under a mound or cairn, reinstated following its excavation in 1929. (Many stone chambered cairns have lost these features.) As it now stands, the passage is long, the first being unroofed with a pair of portal stones. The main passage has walls of vertical rock slabs, roofed by a series of stone lintels. The mound, being substantially smaller than as originally made, no longer completely encloses the burial chamber, so the back wall is open to the air, allowing some natural light in.

Free-standing inside the burial chamber is a smooth pillar of blueschist, a metamorphic rock, some high, with a very rounded shape.
Beyond the back wall of the chamber, in a location that would once have been within the mound, is a replica of the &#x27;Pattern Stone&#x27;. This was found buried under the mound, and has been put standing up in what is thought to have been its original location at a time when the site was a henge rather than a tomb. The patterns take the form of sinuous serpentine shapes that wind around both sides of the stone. Inside the tomb another stone has a small spiral pattern chipped into it, although its authenticity has been questioned.
Outside the tomb, a ring of kerbstones shows the original extent of the mound, and they also follow the line of the ditch of the earlier henge monument. Three of the stones, visible within the cairn mound, are thought to be from the stone circle of that time.

The passage is roughly aligned with the Summer Solstice sunrise, such that for some weeks around the summer solstice, sunlight can find its way through to the back wall of the burial chamber.

The monument is part of a cluster of Neolithic and Bronze Age features. Two further cairns have been identified just to the south of Bryn Celli Ddu, while in the field immediately to the west is a standing stone, and a rock outcrop with cupmarks carved into it.

==Original uses==
The earliest identified remains at the site are a row of five postholes previously thought to have been contemporary with the tomb. Radiocarbon dating of pine charcoal from two of the pits, carried out in 2006, showed these to date from around 4000 BC, putting them at the end of the Mesolithic, 1,000 years before the next phase of use. Their purpose, however, is unknown.

===Henge===
In around 3000 BC a henge monument was constructed. An outer circular bank and ditch would have defined the boundary, although only the ditch survives, some across. Within this, a stone circle would have provided the focus for a site of ritual significance. A ring of 17 stones formed an oval, many being in matched pairs either side of the centre. Cremated human remains were buried at the base of some of them, suggesting a central &#x27;altar&#x27; During this period a pit was dug within the henge; a single human ear-bone was buried, and covered with a flat slab. A second stone known as &#x27;The Pattern Stone&#x27; lay nearby, with the serpentine patterning on it. It is thought this would have stood upright within the henge, as the patterns cover both sides.

===Passage grave===
Some 1000 years after the henge was built, the site was radically altered. All but one of the standing stones were intentionally damaged, some were knocked over and six were smashed with heavy stones. In its place a passage grave was built. Much larger than the mound now remaining, it would have had a complete circle of kerbstones following the line of the old henge ditch, creating an impressive retaining wall around the mound, across. The burial chamber would have been entirely enclosed within the mound, rather than the back wall being open to the air, as in the reconstructed mound now seen. Individual human bones, both burnt and unburnt, were found within the chamber and passage, suggesting a variety of funeral practices, but in all cases re-using the tomb, and clearing aside the old remains.

At the end of its period of use the tomb was &#x27;closed&#x27; by means of a large stone set across the entrance, between the two portal stones.

==Archaeology==
The earliest archaeological descriptions date to around 1800. In 1796 it was included on a list of Anglesey cromlechs in the Cambrian Register. In 1802 Rev John Skinner made a &quot;Ten Days&#x27; Tour Through the Isle of Anglesea&quot;, an account of which he wrote up, but never published, describing the numerous archaeological sites he visited. It was finally published as a supplement to &quot;Archaeologia Cambrensis&quot; in 1908. On his visit to Bryn Celli Ddu, he was told how the passage tomb had been discovered a generation before, by a farmer looking for useful stone. The sight of the pillar stone had initially unnerved the discoverer, but the prospect of treasure tempted him back, and he uprooted the pillar. 
Having suffered depredation of the more movable stones of the site, the monument was excavated by W J Hemp in 1928–29. He revealed much of the sequence of use on the site, and found the &#x27;Pattern Stone&#x27;. It has since been moved to the National Museum of Wales and replaced with a replica standing outside the back wall, but within the area of the original mound, and close to the spot where it was found. The Pillar was set back upright, and the earth and stone mound covering the passage and chamber was reinstated, but clearly there was much less material available than had been used originally. Some additional concrete roof supports have also been added at some point.

Norman Lockyer, who in 1906 published the first systematic study of megalithic astronomy, had argued that Bryn Celli Ddu marked the summer solstice. This was ridiculed at the time, but research by Christopher Knight and Robert Lomas in 1997- 98 showed it to be true. Knight and Lomas also claimed that year-round alignments allowed the site to be used as an agricultural calendar. Steve Burrow, curator of Neolithic archaeology at Amgueddfa Cymru (National Museum of Wales), has more recently supported the case for summer solstice alignment. This alignment links Bryn Celli Ddu to a handful of other sites, including Maes Howe, Orkney and Newgrange, Ireland, both of which point to the winter solstice. It has also been suggested that a feature similar to the &#x27;lightbox&#x27; at Newgrange may be matched at Bryn Celli Ddu.

===Multi-period landscape===
Between 2015 and 2020 the &#x27;Bryn Celli Ddu Public Archaeology Project&#x27; has been engaged in studies of the wider landscape around the site. This is a partnership between Cadw and Manchester Metropolitan University with the aim of involving local communities in archaeological investigation. This has resulted in study of known ancient rock art on a nearby outcrop, and also identified and uncovered a number of other rock outcrops close by that have &#x27;cup mark&#x27; decorations chipped into them. A second burial chamber, 50m to the south of the extant one, had been leveled, but as part of the project a 2019 excavation has revealed a large circular burial cairn which radio-carbon dating has placed at 1900 BC, which is over a thousand years after the earlier passage grave was built.

==Media==
The serpentine pattern and the passage tomb featured strongly in the short animated film, &quot;Songs from Stones&quot;, about some of Anglesey&#x27;s evocative archaeological sites and artefacts, produced as part of the Cultural Olympiad in 2012.

The HeritageTogether project has used photogrammetry to create 3D models of the site and the standing stone.

Media company Mint Motion have produced an animated video of the site&#x27;s development over time, and a flythough of a pointcloud model of the site (see external links below).

The site was featured and explored in an episode of the US reality television series &quot;Expedition Unknown&quot;.

<text>Fracture mechanics is the field of mechanics concerned with the study of the propagation of cracks in materials. It uses methods of analytical solid mechanics to calculate the driving force on a crack and those of experimental solid mechanics to characterize the material&#x27;s resistance to fracture.

Theoretically, the stress ahead of a sharp crack tip becomes infinite and cannot be used to describe the state around a crack. Fracture mechanics is used to characterise the loads on a crack, typically using a single parameter to describe the complete loading state at the crack tip. A number of different parameters have been developed. When the plastic zone at the tip of the crack is small relative to the crack length the stress state at the crack tip is the result of elastic forces within the material and is termed linear elastic fracture mechanics (LEFM) and can be characterised using the stress intensity factor formula_1. Although the load on a crack can be arbitrary, in 1957 G. Irwin found any state could be reduced to a combination of three independent stress intensity factors:
* Mode I – Opening mode (a tensile stress normal to the plane of the crack),
* Mode II – Sliding mode (a shear stress acting parallel to the plane of the crack and perpendicular to the crack front), and
* Mode III – Tearing mode (a shear stress acting parallel to the plane of the crack and parallel to the crack front).

When the size of the plastic zone at the crack tip is too large, elastic-plastic fracture mechanics can be used with parameters such as the J-integral or the crack tip opening displacement.

The characterising parameter describes the state of the crack tip which can then be related to experimental conditions to ensure similitude. Crack growth occurs when the parameters typically exceed certain critical values. Corrosion may cause a crack to slowly grow when the stress corrosion stress intensity threshold is exceeded. Similarly, small flaws may result in crack growth when subjected to cyclic loading. Known as fatigue, it was found that for long cracks, the rate of growth is largely governed by the range of the stress intensity formula_2 experienced by the crack due to the applied loading. Fast fracture will occur when the stress intensity exceeds the fracture toughness of the material. The prediction of crack growth is at the heart of the damage tolerance mechanical design discipline.

==Motivation==
The processes of material manufacture, processing, machining, and forming may introduce flaws in a finished mechanical component. Arising from the manufacturing process, interior and surface flaws are found in all metal structures. Not all such flaws are unstable under service conditions. Fracture mechanics is the analysis of flaws to discover those that are safe (that is, do not grow) and those that are liable to propagate as cracks and so cause failure of the flawed structure. Despite these inherent flaws, it is possible to achieve through damage tolerance analysis the safe operation of a structure. Fracture mechanics as a subject for critical study has barely been around for a century and thus is relatively new.

Fracture mechanics should attempt to provide quantitative answers to the following questions:

# What is the strength of the component as a function of crack size?
# What crack size can be tolerated under service loading, i.e. what is the maximum permissible crack size?
# How long does it take for a crack to grow from a certain initial size, for example the minimum detectable crack size, to the maximum permissible crack size?
# What is the service life of a structure when a certain pre-existing flaw size (e.g. a manufacturing defect) is assumed to exist?
# During the period available for crack detection how often should the structure be inspected for cracks?

==Linear elastic fracture mechanics==
=== Griffith&#x27;s criterion ===
Fracture mechanics was developed during World War I by English aeronautical engineer A. A. Griffith – thus the term Griffith crack – to explain the failure of brittle materials. Griffith&#x27;s work was motivated by two contradictory facts:

* The stress needed to fracture bulk glass is around .
* The theoretical stress needed for breaking atomic bonds of glass is approximately .

A theory was needed to reconcile these conflicting observations. Also, experiments on glass fibers that Griffith himself conducted suggested that the fracture stress increases as the fiber diameter decreases. Hence the uniaxial tensile strength, which had been used extensively to predict material failure before Griffith, could not be a specimen-independent material property. Griffith suggested that the low fracture strength observed in experiments, as well as the size-dependence of strength, was due to the presence of microscopic flaws in the bulk material.

To verify the flaw hypothesis, Griffith introduced an artificial flaw in his experimental glass specimens. The artificial flaw was in the form of a surface crack which was much larger than other flaws in a specimen. The experiments showed that the product of the square root of the flaw length (formula_3) and the stress at fracture (formula_4) was nearly constant, which is expressed by the equation:

:formula_5

An explanation of this relation in terms of linear elasticity theory is problematic. Linear elasticity theory predicts that stress (and hence the strain) at the tip of a sharp flaw in a linear elastic material is infinite. To avoid that problem, Griffith developed a thermodynamic approach to explain the relation that he observed.

The growth of a crack, the extension of the surfaces on either side of the crack, requires an increase in the surface energy. Griffith found an expression for the constant formula_6 in terms of the surface energy of the crack by solving the elasticity problem of a finite crack in an elastic plate. Briefly, the approach was:

* Compute the potential energy stored in a perfect specimen under a uniaxial tensile load.
* Fix the boundary so that the applied load does no work and then introduce a crack into the specimen. The crack relaxes the stress and hence reduces the elastic energy near the crack faces. On the other hand, the crack increases the total surface energy of the specimen.
* Compute the change in the free energy (surface energy − elastic energy) as a function of the crack length. Failure occurs when the free energy attains a peak value at a critical crack length, beyond which the free energy decreases as the crack length increases, i.e. by causing fracture. Using this procedure, Griffith found that

:formula_7

where formula_8 is the Young&#x27;s modulus of the material and formula_9 is the surface energy density of the material. Assuming formula_10 and formula_11 gives excellent agreement of Griffith&#x27;s predicted fracture stress with experimental results for glass.

For the simple case of a thin rectangular plate with a crack perpendicular to the load, the energy release rate, formula_12, becomes:

:formula_13

where formula_14 is the applied stress, formula_3 is half the crack length, and formula_8 is the Young&#x27;s modulus, which for the case of plane strain should be divided by the plate stiffness factor formula_17. The strain energy release rate can physically be understood as: &quot;the rate at which energy is absorbed by growth of the crack&quot;.

However, we also have that:

:formula_18

If formula_12 ≥ formula_20, this is the criterion for which the crack will begin to propagate.

For materials highly deformed before crack propagation, the linear elastic fracture mechanics formulation is no longer applicable and an adapted model is necessary to describe the stress and displacement field close to crack tip, such as on fracture of soft materials.

=== Irwin&#x27;s modification===

&quot;Griffith&#x27;s work was largely ignored by the engineering community until the early 1950s. The reasons for this appear to be (a) in the actual structural materials the level of energy needed to cause fracture is orders of magnitude higher than the corresponding surface energy, and (b) in structural materials there are always some inelastic deformations around the crack front that would make the assumption of linear elastic medium with infinite stresses at the crack tip highly unrealistic.&quot;
Griffith&#x27;s theory provides excellent agreement with experimental data for brittle materials such as glass. For ductile materials such as steel, although the relation formula_21 still holds, the surface energy (&quot;γ&quot;) predicted by Griffith&#x27;s theory is usually unrealistically high. A group working under G. R. Irwin at the U.S. Naval Research Laboratory (NRL) during World War II realized that plasticity must play a significant role in the fracture of ductile materials.

In ductile materials (and even in materials that appear to be brittle), a plastic zone develops at the tip of the crack. As the applied load increases, the plastic zone increases in size until the crack grows and the elastically strained material behind the crack tip unloads. The plastic loading and unloading cycle near the crack tip leads to the dissipation of energy as heat. Hence, a dissipative term has to be added to the energy balance relation devised by Griffith for brittle materials. In physical terms, additional energy is needed for crack growth in ductile materials as compared to brittle materials.

Irwin&#x27;s strategy was to partition the energy into two parts:
* the stored elastic strain energy which is released as a crack grows. This is the thermodynamic driving force for fracture.
* the dissipated energy which includes plastic dissipation and the surface energy (and any other dissipative forces that may be at work). The dissipated energy provides the thermodynamic resistance to fracture.
Then the total energy is:
:formula_22

where formula_9 is the surface energy and formula_24 is the plastic dissipation (and dissipation from other sources) per unit area of crack growth.

The modified version of Griffith&#x27;s energy criterion can then be written as

:formula_25

For brittle materials such as glass, the surface energy term dominates and formula_26. For ductile materials such as steel, the plastic dissipation term dominates and formula_27. For polymers close to the glass transition temperature, we have intermediate values of formula_12 between 2 and 1000 formula_29.

=== Stress intensity factor ===
Another significant achievement of Irwin and his colleagues was to find a method of calculating the amount of energy available for fracture in terms of the asymptotic stress and displacement fields around a crack front in a linear elastic solid. This asymptotic expression for the stress field in mode I loading is related to the stress intensity factor formula_30 following:

:formula_31

where formula_32 are the Cauchy stresses, formula_33 is the distance from the crack tip, formula_34 is the angle with respect to the plane of the crack, and formula_35 are functions that depend on the crack geometry and loading conditions. Irwin called the quantity formula_36 the stress intensity factor. Since the quantity formula_35 is dimensionless, the stress intensity factor can be expressed in units of formula_38.

Stress intensity replaced strain energy release rate and a term called fracture toughness replaced surface weakness energy. Both of these terms are simply related to the energy terms that Griffith used:

:formula_39

and

formula_40

where formula_41 is the mode formula_42 stress intensity, formula_43 the fracture toughness, and formula_44 is Poisson&#x27;s ratio.

Fracture occurs when formula_45. For the special case of plane strain deformation, formula_43 becomes formula_47 and is considered a material property. The subscript formula_42 arises because of the different ways of loading a material to enable a crack to propagate. It refers to so-called &quot;mode formula_42&quot; loading as opposed to mode formula_50 or formula_51:

The expression for formula_41 will be different for geometries other than the center-cracked infinite plate, as discussed in the article on the stress intensity factor. Consequently, it is necessary to introduce a dimensionless correction factor, formula_53, in order to characterize the geometry. This correction factor, also often referred to as the &quot;geometric shape factor&quot;, is given by empirically determined series and accounts for the type and geometry of the crack or notch. We thus have:

:formula_54

where formula_53 is a function of the crack length and width of sheet given, for a sheet of finite width formula_56 containing a through-thickness crack of length formula_57, by:

:formula_58

=== Strain energy release ===
Irwin was the first to observe that if the size of the plastic zone around a crack is small compared to the size of the crack, the energy required to grow the crack will not be critically dependent on the state of stress (the plastic zone) at the crack tip. In other words, a purely elastic solution may be used to calculate the amount of energy available for fracture.

The energy release rate for crack growth or &quot;strain energy release rate&quot; may then be calculated as the change in elastic strain energy per unit area of crack growth, i.e.,

:formula_59

where &quot;U&quot; is the elastic energy of the system and &quot;a&quot; is the crack length. Either the load &quot;P&quot; or the displacement &quot;u&quot; are constant while evaluating the above expressions.

Irwin showed that for a mode I crack (opening mode) the strain energy release rate and the stress intensity factor are related by:
:formula_60
where &quot;E&quot; is the Young&#x27;s modulus, &quot;ν&quot; is Poisson&#x27;s ratio, and &quot;K&quot;I is the stress intensity factor in mode I. Irwin also showed that the strain energy release rate of a planar crack in a linear elastic body can be expressed in terms of the mode I, mode II (sliding mode), and mode III (tearing mode) stress intensity factors for the most general loading conditions.

Next, Irwin adopted the additional assumption that the size and shape of the energy dissipation zone remains approximately constant during brittle fracture. This assumption suggests that the energy needed to create a unit fracture surface is a constant that depends only on the material. This new material property was given the name &quot;fracture toughness&quot; and designated &quot;G&quot;Ic. Today, it is the critical stress intensity factor &quot;K&quot;Ic, found in the plane strain condition, which is accepted as the defining property in linear elastic fracture mechanics.

=== Crack tip plastic zone ===
In theory the stress at the crack tip where the radius is nearly zero, would tend to infinity. This would be considered a stress singularity, which is not possible in real-world applications. For this reason, in numerical studies in the field of fracture mechanics, it is often appropriate to represent cracks as round tipped notches, with a geometry dependent region of stress concentration replacing the crack-tip singularity. In actuality, the stress concentration at the tip of a crack within real materials has been found to have a finite value but larger than the nominal stress applied to the specimen.

Nevertheless, there must be some sort of mechanism or property of the material that prevents such a crack from propagating spontaneously. The assumption is, the plastic deformation at the crack tip effectively blunts the crack tip. This deformation depends primarily on the applied stress in the applicable direction (in most cases, this is the y-direction of a regular Cartesian coordinate system), the crack length, and the geometry of the specimen. To estimate how this plastic deformation zone extended from the crack tip, Irwin equated the yield strength of the material to the far-field stresses of the y-direction along the crack (x direction) and solved for the effective radius. From this relationship, and assuming that the crack is loaded to the critical stress intensity factor, Irwin developed the following expression for the idealized radius of the zone of plastic deformation at the crack tip:
:formula_61
Models of ideal materials have shown that this zone of plasticity is centered at the crack tip. This equation gives the approximate ideal radius of the plastic zone deformation beyond the crack tip, which is useful to many structural scientists because it gives a good estimate of how the material behaves when subjected to stress. In the above equation, the parameters of the stress intensity factor and indicator of material toughness, formula_62, and the yield stress, formula_63, are of importance because they illustrate many things about the material and its properties, as well as about the plastic zone size. For example, if formula_43 is high, then it can be deduced that the material is tough, and if formula_63 is low, one knows that the material is more ductile. The ratio of these two parameters is important to the radius of the plastic zone. For instance, if formula_63 is small, then the squared ratio of formula_62 to formula_63 is large, which results in a larger plastic radius. This implies that the material can plastically deform, and, therefore, is tough. This estimate of the size of the plastic zone beyond the crack tip can then be used to more accurately analyze how a material will behave in the presence of a crack.

The same process as described above for a single event loading also applies and to cyclic loading. If a crack is present in a specimen that undergoes cyclic loading, the specimen will plastically deform at the crack tip and delay the crack growth. In the event of an overload or excursion, this model changes slightly to accommodate the sudden increase in stress from that which the material previously experienced. At a sufficiently high load (overload), the crack grows out of the plastic zone that contained it and leaves behind the pocket of the original plastic deformation. Now, assuming that the overload stress is not sufficiently high as to completely fracture the specimen, the crack will undergo further plastic deformation around the new crack tip, enlarging the zone of residual plastic stresses. This process further toughens and prolongs the life of the material because the new plastic zone is larger than what it would be under the usual stress conditions. This allows the material to undergo more cycles of loading. This idea can be illustrated further by the graph of Aluminum with a center crack undergoing overloading events.

=== Limitations ===
But a problem arose for the NRL researchers because naval materials, e.g., ship-plate steel, are not perfectly elastic but undergo significant plastic deformation at the tip of a crack. One basic assumption in Irwin&#x27;s linear elastic fracture mechanics is small scale yielding, the condition that the size of the plastic zone is small compared to the crack length. However, this assumption is quite restrictive for certain types of failure in structural steels though such steels can be prone to brittle fracture, which has led to a number of catastrophic failures.

Linear-elastic fracture mechanics is of limited practical use for structural steels and Fracture toughness testing can be expensive.

== Elastic–plastic fracture mechanics ==
Most engineering materials show some nonlinear elastic and inelastic behavior under operating conditions that involve large loads. In such materials the assumptions of linear elastic fracture mechanics may not hold, that is,
* the plastic zone at a crack tip may have a size of the same order of magnitude as the crack size
* the size and shape of the plastic zone may change as the applied load is increased and also as the crack length increases.

Therefore, a more general theory of crack growth is needed for elastic-plastic materials that can account for:
* the local conditions for initial crack growth which include the nucleation, growth, and coalescence of voids (decohesion) at a crack tip.
* a global energy balance criterion for further crack growth and unstable fracture.

=== CTOD ===

Historically, the first parameter for the determination of fracture toughness in the elasto-plastic region was the crack tip opening displacement (CTOD) or &quot;opening at the apex of the crack&quot; indicated. This parameter was determined by Wells during the studies of structural steels, which due to the high toughness could not be characterized with the linear elastic fracture mechanics model. He noted that, before the fracture happened, the walls of the crack were leaving and that the crack tip, after fracture, ranged from acute to rounded off due to plastic deformation. In addition, the rounding of the crack tip was more pronounced in steels with superior toughness.

There are a number of alternative definitions of CTOD. In the two most common definitions, CTOD is the displacement at the original crack tip and the 90 degree intercept. The latter definition was suggested by Rice and is commonly used to infer CTOD in finite element models of such. Note that these two definitions are equivalent if the crack tip blunts in a semicircle.

Most laboratory measurements of CTOD have been made on edge-cracked specimens loaded in three-point bending. Early experiments used a flat paddle-shaped gage that was inserted into the crack; as the crack opened, the paddle gage rotated, and an electronic signal was sent to an x-y plotter. This method was inaccurate, however, because it was difficult to reach the crack tip with the paddle gage. Today, the displacement V at the crack mouth is measured, and the CTOD is inferred by assuming the specimen halves are rigid and rotate about a hinge point (the crack tip).

=== R-curve ===

An early attempt in the direction of elastic-plastic fracture mechanics was Irwin&#x27;s crack extension resistance curve, Crack growth resistance curve or R-curve. This curve acknowledges the fact that the resistance to fracture increases with growing crack size in elastic-plastic materials. The R-curve is a plot of the total energy dissipation rate as a function of the crack size and can be used to examine the processes of slow stable crack growth and unstable fracture. However, the R-curve was not widely used in applications until the early 1970s. The main reasons appear to be that the R-curve depends on the geometry of the specimen and the crack driving force may be difficult to calculate.

=== J-integral ===
In the mid-1960s James R. Rice (then at Brown University) and G. P. Cherepanov independently developed a new toughness measure to describe the case where there is sufficient crack-tip deformation that the part no longer obeys the linear-elastic approximation. Rice&#x27;s analysis, which assumes non-linear elastic (or monotonic deformation theory plastic) deformation ahead of the crack tip, is designated the J-integral. This analysis is limited to situations where plastic deformation at the crack tip does not extend to the furthest edge of the loaded part. It also demands that the assumed non-linear elastic behavior of the material is a reasonable approximation in shape and magnitude to the real material&#x27;s load response. The elastic-plastic failure parameter is designated JIc and is conventionally converted to KIc using the equation below. Also note that the J integral approach reduces to the Griffith theory for linear-elastic behavior.

The mathematical definition of J-integral is as follows:
:formula_69

where
:formula_70 is an arbitrary path clockwise around the apex of the crack,
:formula_71 is the density of strain energy,
:formula_72 are the components of the vectors of traction,
:formula_73 are the components of the displacement vectors,
:formula_74 is an incremental length along the path formula_70, and
:formula_76 and formula_77 are the stress and strain tensors.

Since engineers became accustomed to using &quot;K&quot;Ic to characterise fracture toughness, a relation has been used to reduce &quot;J&quot;Ic to it:
:formula_78 where formula_79 for plane stress and formula_80 for plane strain.

=== Cohesive zone model ===

When a significant region around a crack tip has undergone plastic deformation, other approaches can be used to determine the possibility of further crack extension and the direction of crack growth and branching. A simple technique that is easily incorporated into numerical calculations is the &quot;cohesive zone model&quot; method which is based on concepts proposed independently by Barenblatt and Dugdale in the early 1960s. The relationship between the Dugdale-Barenblatt models and Griffith&#x27;s theory was first discussed by Willis in 1967. The equivalence of the two approaches in the context of brittle fracture was shown by Rice in 1968.

=== Transition flaw size ===
Let a material have a yield strength formula_63 and a fracture toughness in mode I formula_47. Based on fracture mechanics, the material will fail at stress formula_83. Based on plasticity, the material will yield when formula_84. These curves intersect when formula_85. This value of formula_3 is called as transition flaw size formula_87., and depends on the material properties of the structure. When the formula_88, the failure is governed by plastic yielding, and when formula_89 the failure is governed by fracture mechanics. The value of formula_90 for engineering alloys is 100 mm and for ceramics is 0.001 mm. If we assume that manufacturing processes can give rise to flaws in the order of micrometers, then, it can be seen that ceramics are more likely to fail by fracture, whereas engineering alloys would fail by plastic deformation.

==Concrete fracture analysis==
Concrete fracture analysis is part of fracture mechanics that studies crack propagation and related failure modes in concrete. As it is widely used in construction, fracture analysis and modes of reinforcement are an important part of the study of concrete, and different concretes are characterized in part by their fracture properties. Common fractures include the cone-shaped fractures that form around anchors under tensile strength.

Bažant (1983) proposed a crack band model for materials like concrete whose homogeneous nature changes randomly over a certain range. He also observed that in plain concrete, the size effect has a strong influence on the critical stress intensity factor, and proposed the relation 
formula_14 = formula_92 / √(1+{formula_93/formula_94formula_95}), 
where formula_14 = stress intensity factor, formula_92 = tensile strength, formula_93 = size of specimen, formula_95 = maximum aggregate size, and formula_94 = an empirical constant.

== Atomistic Fracture Mechanics ==
Atomistic Fracture Mechanics (AFM) is a relatively new field that studies the behavior and properties of materials at the atomic scale when subjected to fracture. It integrates concepts from fracture mechanics with atomistic simulations to understand how cracks initiate, propagate, and interact with the microstructure of materials. By using techniques like Molecular Dynamics (MD) simulations, AFM can provide insights into the fundamental mechanisms of crack formation and growth, the role of atomic bonds, and the influence of material defects and impurities on fracture behavior.

<text>The Marine Corps Brevet Medal, also known as the Brevet Medal, was a military decoration of the United States Marine Corps; it was created in 1921 as a result of Marine Corps Order Number 26. The decoration was a one-time issuance and retroactively recognized living Marine Corps officers who had received a brevet rank. The similar practice of frocking continues in all six branches of the U.S. Armed Forces.

Brevet promotions were used by the United States military in some capacity from 1775 until they were discontinued in 1900. The Army was the only branch authorized to grant brevets until 1814, when the Marine Corps was granted the same privilege. Over 86 years, the Marine Corps awarded 121 brevet promotions to 100 Marine Corps officers. Captain Anthony Gale was the first to receive a brevet promotion in 1814, and John Twiggs Myers, who died in 1952, was the last surviving recipient.

In 1921, Commandant John A. Lejeune requested that a Marine Corps Brevet Medal be authorized. After it was approved and created, the decoration was given to the last 20 living Marine Corps officers who received brevet promotions.

==Brevet promotions==
A brevet promotion, or &quot;brevet&quot;, is the advancement in rank without the advancement in either pay grade or position. Typically, a brevetted officer would be given the insignia of the brevetted rank but not the pay or formal authority. Brevet promotions were originally authorized for the United States Army in 1775 by the Second Continental Congress. In 1778, a resolution was passed stating brevets would only be authorized &quot;..to officers in the line or in case of very eminent services...&quot;.

The Marine Corps would not receive the authorization from Congress for brevet promotions until 1814, stating &quot;... That the President is hereby authorized to confer brevet rank on such officers of the Marine Corps as shall distinguish themselves by gallant actions and meritorious conduct or shall have served ten years in any one grade...&quot;.

In 1814 Anthony Gale became the first Marine to receive a brevet promotion when he was brevetted to Major, having been a Captain for ten years. By the time the practice of brevet promotions was discontinued in 1900, 121 brevet promotions were bestowed on 100 Marine Corps officers.

In the 19th and early 20th centuries, brevet promotions were common in the United States armed forces. New officers received brevet rank until authorized positions were made available, or they could be brevetted to fill higher positions for gallantry. During the American Civil War, most senior officers received a brevet promotion, particularly during the final months of the war.

Due to the establishment of the Medal of Honor and the change in rules allowing both officers and enlisted to receive it, the need for brevet promotions diminished. During the American Civil War, the Army used the issuing of brevet promotions to such a degree that Congress passed an act in 1869 that restricted the issuance of brevet promotions. The act established three requirements for awarding a brevet: &quot;they could only be awarded in time of war and then only for distinguished conduct and public service in the presence of the enemy, and it also removed all privileges of command based upon brevet rank except as directed by the President.&quot;

In 1870 Congress passed a law stating that no officer could wear, nor be addressed by, their brevet rank making brevet promotions an honorary decoration only. Because of this new law the last nine brevet promotions awarded by the Marine Corps occurred during the Boxer Rebellion. On June 7, 1921, the Secretary of the Navy Edwin Denby approved then-Commandant John A. Lejeune&#x27;s request for a medal denoting the holder of a brevet promotion to be issued. Marine Corps Order #26 was issued on June 27, 1921, authorizing the medal to be ordered and by November 10, 1921, the medals had been created. This decoration was justified on the grounds that, until 1915, Marine Corps officers were not eligible for the Medal of Honor.

In 1940 the Marine Corps declared the Brevet Medal obsolete; the medal was never issued again. The concept of brevet commissions was phased out of the United States military, and was replaced by temporary and field promotions, which were awarded more frequently than brevet ranks.

Award of the medal was approved for twenty-three men, three of whom died before they could receive this award. Of the twenty recipients, three were holders of both the Marine Corps Brevet Medal and the Medal of Honor.

==Description and symbolism==
The Marine Corps Brevet Medal was considered to be the equivalent of the Navy Cross, although in precedence it ranks just behind the Medal of Honor. Recipients of the medal had received field commissions as Marine Corps officers, under combat conditions, and had performed feats of distinction and gallant service. Initially, the Brevet Medal ranked behind the Navy Distinguished Service Medal and was issued to 23 active, retired, and discharged Marine Corps personnel.

The medal was designed by Sergeant Joseph Alfred Burnett and contained a ribbon, in USMC scarlet, closely resembling the blue-and-white starred pattern of the Medal of Honor. No attached devices for the Brevet Medal were authorized.

===Front of medal===
The medal consists of a bronze cross pattée, with the center of each arm extended in a semi-circular shape and in the center of the front is the word &quot;BREVET&quot;, encircled by the words &quot;UNITED STATES MARINE CORPS&quot;. A small five-pointed star, point-up, is at the bottom center of the circle formed by the inscription and a small Marine Corps insignia (eagle, globe and anchor) attaches the medal to its suspension ring.

===Back of medal===
The back of the medal is plain except for its center, which contains the inscription &quot;FOR DISTINGUISHED CONDUCT&quot; in a circle, and the words &quot;IN PRESENCE OF ENEMY&quot; in the center. The original medals were neither named nor numbered.

<text>Samuel Tertius Galton (23 March 1783 – 23 October 1844) was a British businessman and scientist.

==Life==
He was the son of Samuel &quot;John&quot; Galton, a prominent member of the scientific Lunar Society, and the father of Francis Galton the eminent Victorian scientist. He was born in the area of Duddeston in Birmingham. Samuel Tertius, though less distinguished, was not an exception to the rule of scientific endeavour in his family. In 1799 he published “Experiments on Colours” which was about colour theory. Mary Gartside mentions his work in her book &quot;An Essay on a New Theory of Colour&quot; in 1808.

Galton also inherited his father&#x27;s considerable business interests and quickly set about making changes—discontinuing the family&#x27;s armaments business in 1815. Though fascinated by economics (he wrote papers on the subject), Samuel preferred to be less &#x27;hands-on&#x27; in the running of the business than his father and spent much of his time living off the revenue of his considerable estate.

==Family==
Though brought up a Quaker, Samuel converted to Anglicanism in 1807. On 30 March 1807, he married Violetta (Francis Anne Viollette) Darwin, one of the fourteen children of his father&#x27;s old colleague and fellow Lunar Society member Erasmus Darwin. Many of the &#x27;Lunar children&#x27; grew up together and there were several such marriages. They had four daughters and three sons:

* Elizabeth Anne Galton (1808–1906), married Edward Wheler
* Lucy Harriot Galton (1809–1848), married James Moilliet
* Millicent Adele Galton (1810–1883), married the Rev Robert Shirley Bunbury
* Emma Sophia Galton (1811–1904)
* Darwin Galton (1814–1903). High Sheriff of Warwickshire in 1850.
* Erasmus Galton (1815–1909)
* Francis Galton (1822–1911)

<doc id="843252" wikidata="Q806998" url="?curid=843252" title="Bant's Carn">
<text>Bant&#x27;s Carn is a Bronze Age entrance grave located on a steep slope on the island of St Mary&#x27;s in the Isles of Scilly, England. The tomb is one of the best examples of a Scillonian entrance grave. Below Bant&#x27;s Carn, lies the remains of the Iron Age village of Halangy Down.

== Description ==
Bant&#x27;s Carn is situated on a steep slope on the island of St Mary&#x27;s in the Isles of Scilly. Below the burial monument, lies the remains of the Iron Age village of Halangy Down. The tomb measures around in diameter and stands on a low platform across. The entrance is long and high, with no roof. It is separated from the burial chamber by a jamb. The chamber itself measures around in length and in width and height, with four large capstones serving as a roof. The carn is partially encircled by the remains of the platform, through which the passage leads indirectly to the chamber entrance.

==History==
The Isles of Scilly were originally settled during the Neolithic era, circa 2500 BC. Burials on the islands range in date from the later Neolithic period to the Middle Bronze Age (2500-1000 BC). Over eighty entrance graves have been discovered on the Isles of Scilly; The majority of graves were built in the middle Bronze Age (1500 to 1000 BC). Bant&#x27;s Carn is an excellent example of a Scillonian entrance grave. Excavated entrance graves typically contain human remains, cremation urns, and pottery fragments. 

The tomb was excavated in 1900 by archaeologist, George Bonsor. Bonsor found the tomb empty except for cremated human remains at the back of the chamber, along with sherds of Neolithic and Bronze Age pottery. Later restoration work in 1970, led by P. Ashbee, included re-setting the tomb&#x27;s eastern capstone and southern portal stone. This work uncovered 140 decorated prehistoric pottery fragments from around the portal stone as well as two worked flints which were given to the Isles of Scily Museum in December 1976.

Bonsor never published the results of his excavations on Scilly. In 1926 his friend and fellow archaeologist, Thomas Kendrick, then Assistant Keeper in the Department of British and Medieval Antiquities at the British Museum, visited Bonsor at his castle in Seville, Spain. He discovered that Bonsor had kept his notes, drawings and finds from his excavations on Scilly. Kendrick convinced Bonsor to send several of the excavation finds to the British Museum. After Bonsor&#x27;s death, his excavation plans and drawings were obtained for the museum. The plans played an important part in the restoration of Bant&#x27;s Carn in 1970.

The Bant&#x27;s Carn site also includes remains of post-medieval field systems and other settlements. It, together with the nearby late Iron Age/Romano-British village of Halangy Down is now in the guardianship of English Heritage. A military battery built in 1905 also stands nearby.

<text>The Specially Meritorious Service Medal was a military decoration of the United States Navy which was created by Joint Resolution of Congress No. 18 of 3 March 1901. The medal was intended to recognize acts of non-combat meritorious service accomplished during the Spanish–American War.

==Description and symbolism==
The ribbon to the Specially Meritorious Service Medal, 1898, is dark red and stands for sacrifice.
Awarded to any member of the U.S. Navy, or United States Marines, the Specially Meritorious Service Medal was presented for acts of gallantry or heroism, not involving armed combat with an enemy, while operating in the territorial waters of Cuba in the year 1898. The medal was primarily awarded to those who had rescued sailors (both U.S. and Spanish) from burning ships following the Battle of Santiago de Cuba at Santiago, Cuba.

By 1935, the Specially Meritorious Service Medal had adopted the status of a commemorative medal; as late as 1942 it still appeared on official US Navy award precedence charts, between the Purple Heart and Presidential Unit Citation. An actual order from the Navy, declaring the decoration obsolete, was never published.

===Obverse===
In the center of a dark bronze cross pattée one and three-sixteenths inches wide, a medallion seven-eighths of an inch in diameter. The outer eighth-inch of the medallion, which is raised and forms a circle around the medallion, contains the raised inscription, U.S. NAVAL CAMPAIGN WEST INDIES. A small five-pointed star appears at the base between the words U.S. and INDIES, and an identical star appears between the words CAMPAIGN and WEST. The other words are separated by a bullet. In the center of the medallion there is a fouled anchor canted to the right and surrounded by a wreath of oak bearing nine acorns (to the right) and laurel (to the left). The wreath is tied at the bottom by a bow. The arms of the cross bear the following words: left arm, SPECIALLY; upper arm, MERITORIOUS; right arm, SERVICE; and lower arm, .1898. The edge of each arm is raised and contains a decorative border on the inside.

The anchor denotes naval service, and the wreath represents strength (oak) and victory (laurel). The inscription denotes the purpose of the medal. The small five pointed star represents military service.

===Reverse===
The reverse is blank and was used to inscribe the recipient&#x27;s name along with a brief citation.

===Ribbon===
The ribbon to the Specially Meritorious Service Medal, 1898, is dark red and stands for sacrifice. The ribbon is nearly identical to that worn for the Navy Good Conduct Medal, and there were recorded instances of Navy enlisted personnel, who received both the Specially Meritorious Service Medal and the Navy Good Conduct Medal, wearing two identical ribbons for separate decorations.

<doc id="843261" wikidata="Q689437" url="?curid=843261" title="Armstrong Whitworth Siskin">
<text>The Armstrong Whitworth Siskin was a sesquiplane single-seat fighter aircraft developed and produced by the British aircraft manufacturer Armstrong Whitworth Aircraft. It was also the first all-metal fighter to be operated by the Royal Air Force (RAF), as well as being one of the first new fighters to enter service following the end of the First World War.

Development of the Siskin was heavily influenced by RAF Specification Type I, including its initial use of the ABC Dragonfly radial engine. Making its first flight in May 1919, the Siskin possessed good qualities in spite of the Dragonfly&#x27;s poor performance. In the following year, the much better Armstrong Siddeley Jaguar was installed and flight with this powerplant was made on 20 March 1921. In response to Air Ministry Specification 14/22, the aircraft was redesigned with an all-metal structure, and orders were placed in 1922.

In May 1924, the first of the RAF&#x27;s Siskin IIIs were delivered to No. 41 Squadron at RAF Northolt. Eleven squadrons would operate the type. Relatively popular with pilots, it served for over eight years before the last of them were replaced by Bristol Bulldogs during October 1932. In addition to the RAF, various other nations evaluated the Siskin and several placed orders. The Royal Canadian Air Force (RCAF) introduced the type in the late 1920s and operated its Siskins until shortly after the outbreak of the Second World War. Several Siskins were also entered in various air races.

==Development==
===Background===
The Armstrong Whitworth Siskin was a development of the Siddeley-Deasy S.R.2 Siskin designed by Major F. M. Green (formerly chief engineer of the Royal Aircraft Factory) of the Siddeley-Deasy Motor Car Company. A major impetus for the aircraft&#x27;s development was the Air Ministry&#x27;s issuing of RAF Specification Type I, which called for a single-seat fighter that was powered by the ABC Dragonfly radial engine. The Dragonfly would prove to be a disappointment as it failed to meet its anticipated performance.

The SR.2 Siskin was a single-bay biplane of wood and fabric construction. It angular in form, with little attention paid to obvious avenues for drag reduction. Perhaps its most distinctive feature was its fixed conventional landing gear, which had relatively lengthy oleo strut shock absorbers carrying the axle, which was in turn connected by radius rods to a pair of V-struts situated behind the axle. Its wings were of unequal span. It was powered by a single ABC Dragonfly radial engine, which was installed on the nose in a d cowling. To regulate the engine&#x27;s temperature, each individual cylinder had its own cooling channel. Armament consisted of a pair of Vickers machine guns mounted directly in front of the pilot.

The Siskin made its first flight in May 1919. While the initial aircraft was powered by the intended Dragonfly engine, it would only deliver rather than the expected . Despite early promise, the Dragonfly was disastrous, being less powerful, unreliable, and prone to overheating while excessive vibration resulted in crankshaft failures after only a few hours of use. Despite the engine, the Siskin displayed generally good properties, possessing favourable stability and handling characteristics, along with performance that could outmatch its direct rivals for RAF orders.

===Redesign===
In 1919, Siddeley-Deasy merged with Armstrong Whitworth, with the aviation interests becoming Armstrong Whitworth Aircraft. Siddeley-Deasy had inherited the design of the RAF 8 fourteen-cylinder radial engine and its designer Sam D. Heron. By 1920, this engine, as the Jaguar, had been developed sufficiently to replace the Dragonfly. A prototype Siskin fitted with a Jaguar flew on 20 March 1921. Air Ministry officials were impressed but urged Armstrong Whitworth to continue developing the aircraft as only an all-metal design would be acceptable to the Royal Air Force (RAF).

During 1922, Air Ministry Specification 14/22 was issued for an all-metal single-seat high performance landplane. The Siskin was submitted leading to an order for a single Jaguar-powered prototype. Aside from the engine change, Major Green redesigned it with an all-metal structure, as the &quot;Siskin III&quot;. The all-metal Siskin was the start of the British transition to metal for military aircraft.

===Into production===

On 13 October 1922, an initial contract for three production aircraft was placed, and a follow-on order for a further six followed on 26 January 1923, including a single two-seat variant. The Siskin III made its first flight on 7 May 1923. A comprehensive evaluation was conducted, during which the ailerons were to prevent them jamming, as happened during one test flight. Shortly thereafter, Armstrong Whitworth commenced construction of the production standard Siskin, the first of which were delivered to the Royal Air Force (RAF) in January 1924 for flight trials on No. 41 Squadron. The fighter was constructed with a composite wood and aluminium frame, covered in doped linen fabric.

Following the orders from the RAF, Armstrong Whitworth worked on securing export sales for the Siskin. Siskin sales played a major role in the company&#x27;s fortunes for a time. Romania ordered 65 aircraft, but cancelled the order following a fatal accident at Whitley Abbey, Coventry on 18 February 1925 when a Romanian pilot died in a crash on take off, during acceptance tests. Political pressure by France may have also contributed to the order&#x27;s cancellation however.

The Siskin IIIA was the main production version, which was first ordered during 1926, and was the first all-metal framed aircraft to be procured in quantity for the RAF. This variant was to have been powered with a Jaguar IV, but was given a supercharged Jaguar IVA engine instead. The supercharger had little effect on performance below , but greatly improved speed and climb above that height. The Royal Canadian Air Force received 12 IIIAs between 1926 and 1931 after evaluating two Siskin IIIs.

Early production examples were built by Armstrong Whitworth but due to production demands for the Atlas, some Siskin IIIA production was subcontracted out to Blackburn, Bristol, Gloster, and Vickers.

==Operational history==
===Royal Air Force===
During May 1924, the RAF&#x27;s first Siskin IIIs were delivered to No. 41 Squadron at RAF Northolt. Shortly thereafter, No. 111 Squadron also received the model; its adoption enabled No. 111 to become the RAF&#x27;s first high-altitude fighter squadron. The Siskin III was relatively popular amongst its pilots, being a highly manoeuvrable aircraft, although slightly underpowered. Between 1925 and 1931, Siskins were frequently presented at RAF exhibitions of flying; one particular feat performed was the linking of three aircraft by cords between their interplane struts, necessitating careful formation flying to not break these cords until the finishing manoeuvre was performed.

During September 1926, the first deliveries of the improved Siskin IIIA variant were made to No. 111 Squadron. In total, the Siskin was operated by eleven RAF squadrons. By 1931, the type was showing its age, leading to the Air Ministry considering either to recondition them or to procure new-built fighters to replace them. During October 1932, the final Siskins in RAF service were withdrawn, the type having been replaced by the newer and more capable Bristol Bulldog.

===Sweden===
The second Siskin II aircraft was sold to the Royal Swedish Air Force in 1925. It was equipped with skis and flown in an experimental capacity for a time.

===Canada===

Between 1926 and 1939, Canada operated a sizable fleet of Siskins. During 1926, the British Air Ministry had dispatched a pair of Siskin IIIs to Canada, where they underwent testing by the Royal Canadian Air Force (RCAF) under winter flying conditions by test pilot Clennell H. Dickins. The Siskin was considered a modern type at the time of its acquisition by the RCAF, which opted to purchase the Mark IIIA. The Canadian procurement involved both new-built aircraft and second-hand RAF Siskins being supplied to numerous RCAF squadrons.

The Siskin equipped the Fighter Flight at Camp Borden and Trenton. During 1937, the Flight became No. I (Fighter) Squadron, and was transferred from Trenton to Calgary in August 1938. RCAF Siskins were also frequently used in aerial displays and long distance tours around North America.
The unit continued to operate the Siskin up until the outbreak of the Second World War, shortly after which the type was rapidly retired and replaced by Hawker Hurricane monoplane fighters. Following the Siskin&#x27;s withdrawal by the RCAF, the airframes were turned over to various technical establishments for use as instructional airframes.

Like its RAF counterparts, in 1929, a three-plane Siskin air demonstration team was formed at Camp Borden, Ontario – the RCAF&#x27;s first official flight demonstration team. The aerobatic team put on popular solo and formation displays from coast to coast.

===Air racing===
The Siskin frequently participated in air racing, often triumphing in such events. Multiple examples were entered into the 1924 King&#x27;s Cup air race, one of which achieving the fastest course time despite arriving fourth. In the 1925 King&#x27;s Cup, a Siskin V flown by Flight Lieutenant Barnard emerged as the winner, having reportedly achieved a speed in excess of .

<text>Porth Hellick Down is a Neolithic and Bronze Age archeological site located on the island of St Mary&#x27;s, in the Isles of Scilly in Great Britain. The ancient burial monument encompasses a large cairn cemetery that includes at least six entrance graves, other unchambered cairns, and a prehistoric field system. The site is notable for having the largest assembly of surviving entrance graves.

==Site description==
Porth Hellick Down is located on the island of St Mary&#x27;s in the Isles of Scilly, overlooking Porth Hellick Bay. The Neolithic and Bronze Age monument encompasses a large cairn cemetery containing several burial cairns, including at least six entrance graves. It also includes an ancient linear boundary and a prehistoric field system, which stretches across the northern and north western section of the Down. It is the largest surviving group of entrance graves in the world.

===The Great Tomb===
The largest and best preserved entrance grave on the ancient site is a Bronze Age grave (2000-1500 BC) located on the northwestern slope of Porth Hellick Down. The burial monument is situated close to the boundary of a prehistoric field system. The site was excavated by the antiquarian, George Bonsor in 1899. He named the entrance grave, &quot;The Great Tomb&quot;. Earlier unrecorded excavations at the site had left the burial chamber empty, except for a piece of pumice and a few remnants of late Bronze Age pottery fragments. Bonsor&#x27;s excavation is the first excavation in Scilly to be recorded in detail.

The entrance grave sits on a low, circular platform. It consists of a mound that is 12.25m in diameter and up to 1.6m in height. The mound is retained by a kerb of large slabs. The burial chamber measures 3.5m by 1.5m wide and is 1m high. The grave is roofed by four capstones, 2.5m long and 1.25m wide. The burial chamber is D-shaped with two sides that incline westwards to intersect the inner end of the passage. The entrance passage is uncovered. The Great Tomb was restored by the Ministry of Works, which included protecting the burial chamber with new turf. The restoration project damaged the tomb when they removed the grave&#x27;s outer kerb. It is now in the care of English Heritage.
===Selected monuments===
The entrance grave that is positioned the furthest west on Porth Hellick Down is the grave known as the &quot;coffin grave&quot;. The remains of the burial monument include part of the stone kerb and four capstones covering a coffin-shaped chamber. The mound contains a kerb of large stones, measuring 8.3m by 8m. The burial chamber is oriented east-west, with the entrance facing east. The chamber interior measures 7m by almost 1.5m wide across the middle, with a boat or coffin-shaped layout, the sides curving in slightly to 1m wide at the western end and 0.65m wide at the entrance. The entrance is partially blocked. The chamber walls are lined with stone slabs. Four capstones make up the chamber roof. The chamber of this entrance grave is considered to be an excellent example of a coffin or boat-shaped chamber.

One of the entrance graves on Porth Hellick Down has a burial chamber that is constructed along a massive rock outcrop. The rock is integrated into the grave&#x27;s structure. The burial chamber consists of a circular mound of stacked rubble, 13m in diameter and 1m high. The southern end of the chamber is lined with large slabs on its west side and a large boulder on the east side. Another large slab sits on the slab walls and provides a roof for the chamber. This grave has survived mostly intact, retaining its original form and layout. It has lost one of its capstones. The incorporation of natural rock outcropping into the grave&#x27;s structure is an unusual feature of a Scillonian entrance grave.

Porth Hellick Down is the site of a prehistoric linear boundary which traverses its eastern slope. The linear boundary progresses as a nearly straight line of small upright stones, up to 0.5m high and 1.5m to 6m apart. Beginning at the eastern edge of the Down, the linear boundary stretches southeast to northwest for 17m, and then continues for another 23m. The boundary measures up to 1m wide, 0.1 m high and is mainly covered by heather turf. Not typically found in prehistoric Britain, The Isles of Scilly is the setting for a number of linear boundaries that are directly associated with groupings of prehistoric burial monuments.

<text>Bibimbap ( ; ), sometimes romanized as bi bim bap or bi bim bop, is a Korean rice dish.

The term &quot;bibim&quot; means &quot;mixing&quot; and &quot;bap&quot; is cooked rice. It is served as a bowl of warm white rice topped with &quot;namul&quot; (sautéed or blanched seasoned vegetables) and &quot;gochujang&quot; (chili pepper paste). Egg and sliced meat (usually beef) are common additions, stirred together thoroughly just before eating.

In South Korea, Jeonju, Jinju, and Tongyeong are especially famous for their versions of bibimbap. In 2017, the dish was listed at number 40 on the &quot;World&#x27;s 50 most delicious foods&quot; readers&#x27; poll compiled by CNN Travel.

== Etymologies ==
&quot;Bibimbap&quot; has gone by a number of names over time.

Its earliest names appear in Korean hanja texts. Its first name was &quot;&quot; (). This name appeared in the &quot;Yeokjogumun&quot; () portion of the book &quot;Historical Notes of Gijae&quot; (), which was written by Bak Dongnyang () around 1590. In the &quot;Diary of Cheongdae&quot; by another Joseon scholar Gwon Sang-il (1679–1760), it was recorded as &quot;goldong-ban&quot; (). The dish was also recorded in &quot;Complete Works of Seongho&quot; by Yi Ik (1681–1764) as &quot;goldong&quot; (), in &quot;Complete Works of Cheongjanggwan&quot; by Yi deok-mu (1741–1793) as &quot;goldong-ban&quot; (), and in &quot;Works of Nakhasaeng&quot; by Yi Hak-gyu (1770–1835) as both &quot;goldong-ban&quot; () and &quot;goldong&quot; ().

The hangul transcription () first appears in the 1810 encyclopedia &quot;Mongyupyeon&quot; by Jang Hon. The 1870 encyclopedia states that the dish name is written as () in hanja but is read as (), a probable transcription of the native Korean (). Another name is (). The hanja dictionary () indeed contained &quot; ()&quot; or &quot; (), &quot;Dong&quot; ()&quot; in hanja, which meant &quot;mix&quot; or &quot;&quot; in Korean.

By the late 19th century, it went by a number of names in hangul: (), (), (), (), (), and () () and (). Other names in hanja include (, ), (), and () and also ().

== History ==
The exact origin of bibimbap is unknown. People could have started mixing &quot;bap&quot; (rice) with &quot;banchan&quot; (side dishes) after the outdoor &quot;jesa&quot; (rites), such as &quot;sansinje&quot; (rite for mountain gods) or &quot;dongsinje&quot; (rite for village gods), where they needed to &quot;eat with the god&quot; but did not have as many cooking pots and items of crockery on hand as they would normally have at home. Jeonju Bibimbap is an old-fashioned dish. Some scholars assert that bibimbap originates from the traditional practice of mixing all the food offerings made at a &quot;jesa&quot; (ancestral rite) in a bowl before partaking of it.

Ordinary people ate bibimbap on the eve of the lunar new year as the people at that time felt that they had to get rid of all of the leftover side dishes before the new year. The solution to this problem was to put all of the leftovers in a bowl of rice and to mix them together. Farmers ate bibimbap during farming season as it was the easiest way to make food for a large number of people. Bibimbap was served to the king, usually as a lunch or a between-meal snack. There was more than vegetables in this bibimbap.

In &quot;Collected Works of Oju&quot; written by Yi Gyu-gyeong (1788–1856), recorded numerous varieties of bibimbap including such ingredients as &quot;hoe&quot;, shad, prawn, salted shrimp, shrimp roe, &quot;gejang&quot;, wild chive, fresh cucumber, &quot;gim&quot; flakes, gochujang, soybean sprout, and various vegetables. It was also stated here that bibimbap was a local specialty of Pyongyang, along with naengmyeon and gamhongno.

The first known recipe for &quot;bibimbap&quot; is found in the &quot;Siuijeonseo&quot;, an anonymous cookbook from the late 19th century.

The late 20th century brought about the globalization of the Korean culture, traditions, and food to many areas of the world with many restaurant chains being opened up in various international airports that encourage the sale of bibimbap.

== Culture ==
Bibimbap is an extensively customizable food with a variety of ingredients that can be used in its creation. It has existed in Korea for centuries and even has a place in society today. It came from early rural Koreans taking leftover vegetables, sometimes having meat, with rice and mixing them in a bowl. This was cheap and did not require all of the time and space of a traditional meal.

There are two separate ancient writings that suggest the original reasoning behind the creation and use of bibimbap. The first one, &quot;People&#x27;s Unofficial Story of Jeonju&quot; (), tells of Jeonju bibimbap being used in occasions such as parties that included government officials of provincial offices. The second being, &quot;Lannokgi&quot; (), which told of bibimbap being made by the wives of farmers, who had no time to prepare meals the traditional way with many side dishes, and instead they were able to throw most of the ingredients in a bowl, sometimes adding whatever they happened to be cultivating. Although bibimbap was originally rarely mentioned and mostly only in hanja records, it began to be more frequently referenced and in Hangul (Korean alphabets) records as well upon the creation of Hangul by the King Sejong the Great to improve the state&#x27;s literacy.

The division of Korea in the 20th century caused a cultural divide in the creation of bibimbap with two types related to both North and South Korea. The most famous regions for traditional bibimbap happen to be Pyongyang for its vegetable bibimbap in the North and Jeonju for its Jeonju bibimbap.

In the late 20th century, &quot;bibimbap&quot; started to become widespread in many countries in the West, due to its simplicity, cheap cost, and delicious taste. Many airlines connecting to South Korea via Incheon International Airport began to serve it, and it was accepted more globally as a popular Korean dish. Bibimbap has also been described as a symbol of the Korean culture to non-Koreans due to Korea becoming more acceptable to foreigners and multicultural traditions.

== Preparation ==

Bibimbap can be various kinds of bibimbap depending on the ingredients. Vegetables commonly used in &quot;bibimbap&quot; include julienned &quot;oi&quot; (cucumber), aehobak (courgette/zucchini), &quot;mu&quot; (radish), mushrooms, &quot;doraji&quot; (bellflower root), and &quot;gim&quot;, as well as spinach, soybean sprouts, and &quot;gosari&quot; (bracken fern stems). &quot;Dubu&quot; (tofu), either plain or sautéed, or a leaf of lettuce may be added, or chicken or seafood may be substituted for beef. For visual appeal, the vegetables are often placed so adjacent colors complement each other. In the South Korean version, sesame oil, red pepper paste (gochujang), and sesame seeds are added.

== Variations ==

=== Jeonju ===
Jeonju bibimbap along with kongnamul-gukbap (bean sprout and rice soup) are signature dishes of Jeonju. Jeonju bibimbap is usually topped with soy bean sprouts, hwangpo-muk, gochujang, jeopjang, and seasoned raw beef and served with kongnamul-gukbap. The rice of Jeonju bibimbap is specially prepared by being cooked in beef shank broth for flavor and finished with sesame oil for flavor and nutrients. Jeonju also holds a Jeonju Bibimbap Festival every year.

=== Hot stone pot (&quot;dolsot bibimbap&quot;, ) ===
Hot stone pot bibimbap (&quot;dolsot-bibimbap&quot;, ) is a variation of bibimbap served in a very hot &quot;dolsot&quot; (stone pot) in which a raw egg is cooked against the sides of the bowl. The bowl is so hot that anything that touches it sizzles for minutes. Before the rice is placed in the bowl, the bottom of the bowl is coated with sesame oil, making the layer of the rice touching the bowl cook to a crisp, golden brown known as &quot;nurungji&quot; (). This variation of bibimbap is typically served to order, with the egg and other ingredients mixed in the pot just prior to consumption.

=== &quot;Yakcho&quot; () ===
&quot;Yakcho-bibimbap&quot; () is from Jecheon. Yak () is a historical term for medicinal. Jecheon is a great place for medicinal herbs to grow. People could get a thicker root and more medicinal herb than other areas. The combination of the medicinal herbs and popular bibimbap made it one of the most popular foods in Jecheon.

=== &quot;Hoedeopbap&quot; () ===
&quot;Hoedeopbap&quot; () is a bibimbap with a variety of raw seafood, such as tilapia, salmon, tuna or sometimes octopus, but each bowl of rice usually contains only one variety of seafood. The term &quot;hoe&quot; in the word means raw fish. The dish is popular along the coasts of Korea where fish are abundant.

* Freshwater snail soybean paste (&quot;ureong-doenjang&quot;)
*Roe (&quot;albap&quot;)
* Spicy pork (&quot;jeyuk&quot;)
* Sprout (&quot;saessak&quot;)
* &quot;Tongyeong&quot;, served with seafood
* Wild vegetables (&quot;sanchae&quot;)
* Wild herbs

== Symbolism ==
Some people attach symbolism to the ingredients of bibimbap. Black or dark colours represent north and the kidneys – for instance, shiitake mushrooms, bracken ferns or nori seaweed. Red or orange represents south and the heart, with chilli, carrots, and jujube dates. Green represents east and the liver, with cucumber and spinach. White is west or the lungs, with foods such as bean sprouts, radish, and rice. Yellow represents the centre, or stomach. Foods include pumpkin, potato or egg.

<doc id="843296" wikidata="Q7637903" url="?curid=843296" title="Summit Tunnel">
<text>Summit Tunnel in England is one of the world&#x27;s oldest railway tunnels. It was constructed between 1838 and 1841 by the Manchester and Leeds Railway Company to provide a direct line between Leeds and Manchester. When built, Summit Tunnel was the longest railway tunnel in the world.

The tunnel, between Littleborough and Walsden near Todmorden, was bored beneath the Pennines, a natural obstruction to most forms of traffic. The tunnel is just over long and carries two standard-gauge tracks in a single horseshoe-shaped tube, approximately wide and high. Summit Tunnel was designed by Thomas Longridge Gooch, assisted by Barnard Dickinson. Progress on its construction was slower than anticipated, largely because excavation was more difficult than anticipated. On 1 March 1841, Summit Tunnel was opened by Sir John Frederick Sigismund Smith; it had cost of £251,000 and 41 workers had died.

On 20 December 1984, the Summit Tunnel fire occurred. There were no deaths and five months later, the tunnel reopened after repairs. The tunnel has remained in continuous use with little interruption since it opened.

==Development==
Summit Tunnel, between Littleborough and Todmorden is the highest section of the long Manchester and Leeds Railway, which was built parallel to the Rochdale Canal. When built, it was the world&#x27;s longest railway tunnel and a critical element of the first trans-Pennine line.

The tunnel was designed by the civil engineer Thomas Longridge Gooch, a collaborator of George Stephenson and his son Robert Stephenson on several railway schemes. Between spring 1835 and 1844, Gooch was the engineer for the Manchester and Leeds Railway on behalf of George Stephenson, who was working on other projects. In September 1837, during Gooch&#x27;s tenure, work commenced boring the tunnel. Gooch was assisted by Barnard Dickinson. When speaking about the tunnel, Dickinson exclaimed: &quot;This tunnel will defy the rage of tempest, fire, war or wasting age&quot;.

The tunnel is long and tall; the horseshoe-shaped bore is wide and accommodates a pair of tracks. The tunnel falls on a gradient of 1-in-330 southwards (towards ). It was driven by hand through shale, coal and sandstone, after which the walls were lined with six courses of brick, using more than 23 million bricks. The bricks were handmade locally and up to 60,000 were laid in a single day. Roman cement was used for its impermeability to water. It has been estimated that about 8,100 tonnes (dry weight) of cement was transported to the tunnel from Hull. During August 1838, James Wood, the chairman of the Manchester and Leeds Railway, laid the first brick in a ceremony.
The original contractors were Evans, Stewart and Copeland. At the peak of construction, a workforce of between 800 and 1,250 men and boys was active, aided by about 100 horses and 13 stationary steam engines, which were used to remove material from the shafts. The bedrock was hewn using physical strength and hand tools, illuminated only by candlelight. At an early stage of track laying, the rails were laid directly onto excavated rock, but conventional wooden sleepers were also used. The spoil was used for other purposes, including in the construction of Blackpool Promenade.

Alignment of the tunnel was achieved by drilling 14 vertical shafts to provide survey points. When the tunnel was complete, two shafts were sealed and the remaining 12 were retained as ventilation. The ventilation shafts were up to deep. During the tunnel&#x27;s service life, No.6 was sealed after rock falls.

Progress on construction was slower than expected; the bedrock and blue shale through which it was bored proved to be harder to excavate than anticipated. In March 1839, because of slow progress, the original contractors were dismissed and George Stephenson took over, after which the pace of work increased until a strike of the bricklayers occurred in March 1840. The last brick was laid on 9 December 1840.

Summit Tunnel should have opened on New Year&#x27;s Eve 1840; but the opening was delayed after the discovery of a defective invert, from one end which had displaced the central track drain. After repairs, the tunnel was officially opened by Sir John Frederick Sigismund Smith, the government inspector of railways on 1 March 1841. Summit Tunnel cost £251,000 and the loss of 41 lives. The cost was far greater than the railway company expected.

The southern portal of the tunnel was grade II listed in 1986.

== Incidents ==
The tunnel closed for the first eight months of 1985 following a fire that generated sufficient heat to vitrify sections of its outer brickwork. The build up of heat in the surrounding ground led to a &#x27;false spring&#x27;; many plants produced flowers and buds as the warm soil triggered new growth. Damage to the tunnel lining was minimal which was attributed to heated gases from the fire escaping through the ventilation shafts. Restoration involved replacing of track and sleepers before it re-opened to traffic on 19 August 1985.

On 28 December 2010, a passenger train travelling from Manchester to Leeds was derailed when it struck ice that had fallen onto the tracks from one of the ventilation shafts. The ice had built up during exceptionally cold weather and fell into the tunnel when it started to thaw. The train was the first to use the tunnel in three days as a result of a temporary break in services around Christmas. It collided with the tunnel wall, but remained upright and no injuries were reported.

<doc id="843325" wikidata="Q2181998" url="?curid=843325" title="Public holidays in Slovenia">
<text>There are two kinds of public holidays in Slovenia – state holidays and work-free days. State holidays are those celebrated by the state. These include official functions and flying the national flag. The latter are actually Christian religious holidays, which are equivalent to any Sunday: companies and schools are closed, but there is no official celebration.

9 of 14 state holiday days are work-free, and there are additional 6 work-free days in Slovenia. Two of them always fall on Sunday, thus, there are effectively at most 13 work-free days in Slovenia.

State holidays that are work-free are shown in pale green, while work-free days that are not state holidays (coinciding with Christian religious holidays) are shown in blue.

==Table==
==Other holidays==
In addition to these, several other holidays are traditionally and popularly celebrated by the people of Slovenia, although not being work-free. The best known are:
* Carnival (&quot;pust&quot;, date varies),
* Slovenian Maritime Day, 7 March
* International Women&#x27;s Day, 8 March
* St. George&#x27;s Day (&quot;jurjevanje&quot;, the welcoming of spring; 23 April),
* St. Martin&#x27;s Day (&quot;martinovanje&quot;, changing of must into wine; 11 November)
* Saint Nicholas Day (&quot;miklavž&quot;, when children receive presents; 6 December)
* Insurrection Day (&quot;dan vstaje&quot;, 22 July, work-free until 1991)

<doc id="843326" wikidata="Q1114414" url="?curid=843326" title="Comic Party">
<text>, sometimes abbreviated to ComiPa, is a dating sim video game by the Japanese game studio Leaf. It was first released on May 28, 1999, for Windows with adult content, but re-released with it removed for the Dreamcast, Windows, and PSP. The main focus of the game is the creation of various dōjinshi by the player&#x27;s character, during which there are varied opportunities to interact with a cast of girls.

&quot;Comic Party&quot; is inspired from the real world event of Comiket (Comic Market) held in Tokyo each summer and winter. This is a convention where various artists gather together to share both parody, homage, and original work. Since the series was inspired by Comiket, it comes as no surprise that the &quot;Comic Party&quot; convention also takes place in the same building as Comiket, the Tokyo Big Sight convention center near Ariake, Tokyo.

&quot;Comic Party&quot; has spawned both a manga (illustrated by Sekihiko Inui) and an anime series since its inception, as well as a Dreamcast version of the original PC game which added a new character (Subaru) and removed the pornographic elements (reverse-ported to Windows, that version is called &quot;Comic Party DCE&quot;). Many artbooks, figures, and fan-made homages have been produced for it.

The anime series was licensed in North America by The Right Stuf International and the Sekihiko Inui&#x27;s manga is licensed by Tokyopop. &quot;Comic Party Anthology Comic&quot;, a related manga originally published by Ohzora Publishing, is published by CPM under the title &quot;Comic Party: Party Time&quot;, which is a series of doujinshi anthologies featuring stories by independent manga artists set in the &quot;Comic Party&quot; universe. Diverging frequently from &quot;Comic Party&quot; canon, this offshoot manga series includes more yaoi elements than the original materials. A sequel anime series, &quot;Comic Party Revolution&quot;, came out in 2003.

The game was ported to the PlayStation Portable (PSP) as &quot;Comic Party Portable&quot; on December 29, 2005. Promotional videos show that the &quot;Comic Party Revolution&quot; character designs are used, rather than the original designs from the Windows and Dreamcast games and the first anime series. Characters from &quot;Comic Party&quot; are featured as partner characters &quot;&quot;, a fighting game developed by Aquaplus with characters from various Leaf games.

==Gameplay==
&quot;Comic Party&quot; is a point-and-click first person perspective dating sim game. It is the player&#x27;s task to decide the schedule of the main protagonist, Kazuki Sendō, as he prepares for the Comic Party convention that takes place once a month. How fast Kazuki can complete his dōjinshi, how many copies he can sell at each convention, and what girl he is able to date depends on the player&#x27;s choices. Only one action can be chosen on each weekday because Kazuki must attend college during the day, and two actions can be chosen on Saturday and Sunday. It is only on the weekend where the player is given the choice to leave the house and contact the girl the player wishes to pursue.

During the course of game, the protagonist will come in contact with other characters. These meetings composes mostly of text of the dialogue and actions that happen during the interactions. At certain points of the conversation, the player will be asked to choose between two or more actions that can affect the feelings of that person you are interacting with and can lead to other events.

The game begins on April 1 and ends on March 31 the next year. The ending depends on whether the player succeeds in winning a girl&#x27;s heart. Although the player does not have to win a girl&#x27;s heart to reach the end of the game, if the player fails at completing their monthly dōjinshi before the deadline, the game will end early.

==Synopsis==

===Plot===
Early April, Kazuki Sendō is invited by his friend, Taishi Kuhonbutsu, to come with him to Tokyo Big Sight. He is surprised to see thousands of people waiting in line to get in. Apparently they are at Comic Party, a giant dōjinshi convention. Once inside, Kazuki meets some of the dōjinshi artists and is surprised to find himself enjoying their work. Taishi convinces Kazuki to draw dōjinshi after their visit because he recognizes Kazuki&#x27;s skill as an artist, but Kazuki&#x27;s childhood friend Mizuki tries to talk him out of it because she believes otakus are smelly, dirty, and disgusting. Her reasoning does not help because Kazuki already made up his mind and begins to draw his first dōjinshi.

==Characters==

===Brother 2/Two Brothers===
:Masami Kikuchi (Japanese), Sam Riegel (CP English), Leraldo Anzaldua (CPR English)
:The protagonist of this title. Throughout high school, Kazuki Sendō coasted entirely on his natural talent for art, only to get a reality check when he failed to get into art school. Left with a lingering feeling that he could have done better if there were a more competitive environment for him to hone his artwork in, Taishi introduces him to the world of dōjinshi where he finds exactly what he was looking for. Together, they form the dōjinshi circle &quot;Brother 2&quot;. Often spends so much time on drawing that he forgets to buy food or do his school assignments. In the anime, the character is reworked into a high school student and his backstory is trimmed down.
:Kōichi Tōchika (Japanese), Liam O&#x27;Brien (CP English), Josh Grelle (CPR English)
:The other half of &quot;Brother 2&quot;, he is a typical otaku who sees the dōjinshi concept as the leading pop-culture format of the 21st century. Grandiose in the expressions of his dreams, he takes charge of the logistical aspects of the partnership (paying registration fees, arranging printers, etc.), leaving the actual artwork to Kazuki.

===Main heroines===
:Riko Sayama (Japanese), Rachael Lillis (CP English), Luci Christian (CPR English)
:Mizuki Takase is the protagonist&#x27;s friend since the first year of high school and eventually end up in the same college together. She is energetic and athletic girl with past thigh length hair in a side ponytail. She&#x27;s hostile and skeptical towards otaku and dōjinshi, and is initially opposed to Kazuki&#x27;s new activity. However, she&#x27;s also torn by Kazuki&#x27;s expressions of satisfaction with the dōjinshi process, and worries that it leaves less time for them together. As the game goes on, she slowly becomes interested in otaku culture, even trying cosplay and purchasing expensive DVD sets.
:Kaoru Morota (Japanese), Georgette Reilly (CP English), Tiffany Grant (CPR English)
:Yū Inagawa is a Kansai-speaking, passionate dōjinshi enthusiast. She is from Kobe, but comes to Tokyo often for Comic Party. Her parents own a Japanese inn and hot-springs resort that she will inherit when she is older. Yū is the sole member of the circle &quot;Karamitei&quot;. She teaches Kazuki about dōjinshi publishing and comics exhibition. She is nicknamed &quot;Hot springs Panda&quot; (Panda Onseniko) by Eimi because she owns a hot springs and she has large circle glasses that is similar to the dark patches around the panda&#x27;s eyes. In the anime, she&#x27;s a transfer student at Kazuki&#x27;s high school.
:Shizuka Ishikawa (Japanese), Jessica Calvello (CP English), Larissa Wolcott (CPR English)
:Eimi Ohba is an egoistic dōjin artist who self-proclaims the title of &quot;Queen of ComiPa&quot;. She is the sole member of a popular dōjin circle called: &quot;CAT OR FISH?!&quot;. She is fiercely competitive and believes the value of the dōjinshi is based on how many its sold. Although a savant at drawing dōjinshi, her poor academic performance leaves her on the verge of failing to graduate from high school.
:Mie Sonozaki (Japanese), Carol Jacobanis (CP English), Kim Prause (CPR English)
:Aya Hasebe is a timid third-year high school girl who draws original dōjinshi. She usually gets Kazuki&#x27;s attention by pulling on his shirt rather than calling out to him. Aya&#x27;s circle is called &quot;Jamming Book Store&quot;. Her dōjinshi does not sell well because she has a hard time attracting customers even though it has good artwork and costs only 200 yen. Kazuki admires her artwork and creative story so he tries to help her sell whenever he can.
:Miho Yamada (Japanese), Lisa Ortiz (CP English), Allison Sumrall (CPR English)
:Minami Makimura is the head staff of the Comic Party conventions. During the conventions, she is seen patrolling the grounds. She always checks Kazuki&#x27;s dōjinshi to see if it&#x27;s acceptable to be sold there.
:Sumie Baba (Japanese), Lisa Ortiz (CP English), Kim-Ly Nguyen (CPR English)
:Chisa Tsukamoto is the daughter of the printing shop where Kazuki gets his dōjinshi printed. She is hardworking and looks after the business when her parents go out of town, but she is clumsy and scatterbrained and makes mistakes with the printing process. She is often seen chasing a runaway cart. In the anime, she&#x27;s a junior student at Kazuki&#x27;s school.
:Akiko Muta (Japanese), Sara Van Buskirk (CP English), Laurie Gallardo (CPR English)
:A member of Team Ikkatsu, a four-girl dōjinshi circle who draw fighting game-based yaoi dōjinshi. A hardcore fan of the Fighters&#x27; Breaker series, she works part-time at the local arcade to keep an eye out for anyone playing her favorite character and fanatical obsession, Sho Kusakabe (a parody of Kyo Kusanagi from the King of Fighters). She&#x27;s always enthusiastic to show her love of fighting game characters, be it through cosplay or dōjinshi. Due to a misunderstanding, mistakes Kazuki as a rare male fan of yaoi and decides to fan his interest in the hobby. Attends the same university as Kazuki and Mizuki. In the anime, her obsession with yaoi and fighting games is removed and replaced with more emphasis on cosplay, moving her part-time job to a cosplay cafe.

===Other heroines===
:Satomi Koorogi (Japanese), Kerry Grant (CP English), Jessica Boone (CPR English)
:Asahi Sakurai is anime and manga fan by day and a famous idol by night. She is the voice actress of Card Master Peach, the main character of the popular anime in the Comic Party world (and a double parody, of Wedding Peach and Cardcaptor Sakura). Even though she is an idol, she is nervous around people so she often stutters and forgets what she was going to say. Asahi disguises herself with eyeglasses and a hat when she wants to enjoy the public without a crowd around her which quickly forms when her identity is revealed. In the original PC version of the game, she&#x27;s treated as a secret heroine, going by the alias &quot;Momo-chan&quot; until she develops a bond with Kazuki. Because of this, Asahi&#x27;s role in the first Comic Party anime adaption is limited and she does not interact with the main protagonist. Instead, she is only heard on the radio and briefly seen singing at a concert. Later ports of the game openly advertise her alongside the other heroines.

Despite frequently sending Kazuki expensive gifts and having the carrier leave personal gifts on his tables at events, she chooses to keep her true identity hidden. Treated as a secret heroine in all releases up until the PSP port. In the original anime, she instead plays the role of Kazuki&#x27;s first customer, meeting him in person at Comic Party events. Tachikawa is not used in the manga adaption.

===Anime===

The &quot;Comic Party&quot; anime adaptation first aired in Japan on April 1, 2001, on UHF stations. Thirteen episodes and four ten minute specials were produced by Oriental Light and Magic and KSS and directed by Norihiko Sudo. The anime focuses on the dōjinshi creation part of the game rather than the dating aspect and the specials are an original story involving the cast of &quot;Comic Party&quot; taking a vacation to a hot spring resort.

&quot;Comic Party&quot; was licensed in North America by The Right Stuf International and first announced at the Illinois anime convention, Anime Central, on April 20, 2002. It was released on four DVD volumes between March 30, 2004, and July 27, 2004. A number of rewrites and cultural changes were made to the English dub. Some examples include converting the Japanese yen to dollars in the script (although the original coins are still seen), kimono to Versace summer dress, and replacing the &quot;Panda Onseniko&quot; or &quot;Hot Springs Panda&quot; that Eimi calls Yuu with &quot;Stupid Panda&quot;. Dōjinshi is also referred to throughout the series as &quot;fan comics&quot;. The changes were not made to the subtitles as they are correct translations of the original Japanese script. On September 4, 2014, North American anime licensor Discotek Media announced that they have acquired the series and will re-release it on DVD in January 2015.

&quot;Comic Party Revolution&quot; is a thirteen episode sequel. The first four episodes are directed by Junichi Sakata and animated by produced by Chaos Project. The first episode was released on DVD on December 22, 2003, as the first part of a two episode OVA which was later extended to four episodes. These episodes were used as the first four episodes of the TV series that first aired on April 4, 2005, and ended on June 27, 2005. The OVAs were edited and cut in length to make the episodes fit in a normal television timeslot. Episodes five to thirteen was directed by Mitsuhiro Tōgō and produced by Radix Ace Entertainment. In &quot;Comic Party Revolution&quot;, Kazuki and Mizuki are now attending college and many of the events that take place in the game are hinted to have happened. Characters that were absent from the original series like Subaru Mikage and Asahi Sakurai make their debut. Kazuki is no longer the main focus in &quot;Revolution&quot;. Instead, the female cast roles are more equally distributed and some of them are given the spotlight in certain episodes.

&quot;Comic Party Revolution&quot; was licensed in North America by ADV Films for $30,336 which they announced at Metrocon 2006. ADV used their own voice talent for the English dub so the cast is different from the original series. Cultural changes were not made to the dub like the dub from Right Stuf.

A manga adaption of &quot;Comic Party&quot; was written and illustrated by Sekihiko Inui, who is also a dōjinshi artist and continues to draw dōjinshi under the dōjin circle called Mix-ism.

The chapters was compiled into five tankōbon volumes and published by Dengeki Comics. &quot;Comic Party&quot; manga is licensed in North America by Tokyopop. All five volumes was released between June 4, 2004, and January 31, 2006. In the first episode of the original series, Kazuki has a dream set in the world of &quot;To Heart&quot;, arguably AQUAPLUS&#x27; most famous franchise. Kazuki is cast in the role of Hiroyuki, and a number of other familiar characters appear, including Akari Kamigishi and LEAF mascot Multi.

Anthologies of short pieces by independent artists was published by various parties including Ichijinsha, Ohzora Publishing, Square Enix, Rapport, Enterbrain and Sony Magazines.

<text>A remote-control vehicle, is defined as any vehicle that is teleoperated by a means that does not restrict its motion with an origin external to the device. This is often a radio-control device, a cable between the controller and the vehicle, or an infrared controller.

==Applications==

===Scientific===
Remote-control vehicles have various scientific uses, including operating in hazardous environments, working in the deep ocean, and space exploration. 

==== Space probes ====
The majority of probes to other planets in the Solar System have been remote-control vehicles, although some of the more recent ones were partially autonomous. The sophistication of these devices has prompted greater debate on the need for crewed spaceflight and exploration. The Voyager I spacecraft is the first craft of any kind to leave the Solar System. The explorers Spirit and Opportunity have provided continuous data about the surface of Mars since January 3, 2004.

==== Submarines ====
Jason is the Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution&#x27;s deep water explorer and can withstand depths of up to 6,500 feet.

The Scorpio ROV is a British submersible that rescued the crew of the Russian AS-28 on August 7, 2005.

===Military and law enforcement===

Military usage of remotely-controlled vehicles dates back to the first half of 20th century. John Hays Hammond, Jr., invented and patented methods for wireless control of ships starting in 1910. The Soviet Red Army used remotely-controlled teletanks during the 1930s in the Winter War and early stage of World War II. There were also remotely-controlled cutters and experimental remotely-controlled planes in the Red Army.

Remote-control vehicles are used in law enforcement and military engagements for some of the same reasons. Hazard exposure is mitigated for the operator of the vehicle, who controls it from a location of relative safety. Remote-controlled vehicles are also used for bomb disposal.

Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) have undergone a significant evolution in capability in the past decade. Early UAVs were capable of reconnaissance missions alone and then only with a limited range. Current UAVs can hover around possible targets until they are positively identified before releasing their payload of weaponry. Backpack-sized UAVs will provide ground troops with over-the-horizon surveillance capabilities.

===Recreation and hobby===

Small-scale remote-control vehicles have long been popular among hobbyists. These remote-controlled vehicles span a wide range in terms of price and sophistication. There are many types of radio-controlled vehicles; these include on-road cars, off-road trucks, boats, submarines, airplanes, and helicopters. The &quot;robots&quot; now popular in television shows such as Robot Wars are a recent extension of this hobby.

Radio control is the most popular choice, as the vehicle&#x27;s range is not limited by the length of a cable, nor does it require direct line-of-sight with the controller, which is the case with infrared control.

<text>A back walkover is an acrobatic maneuver in which a person transitions from a standing position to a back bridge and then back to a standing position again, undergoing a complete revolution of the body in the process. Back walkovers are commonly performed in a variety of athletic activities, including acro dance, cheerleading, and rhythmic gymnastics. In artistic gymnastics, back walkovers are performed in floor exercises and on the balance beam.

==Technique==
The back walkover performer begins in a standing position. The back is increasingly arched and abdominal muscles are stretched until the hands touch the floor and all hands and feet are flat on the floor, thus forming a gymnastic back bridge. While in the bridge position, one leg (the &quot;leading&quot; leg) is rapidly raised from the floor so as to impart momentum to the lower body. This momentum lifts the trailing leg from the floor so that only the hands are left touching the floor. Both hands remain on the floor while the body revolves backward through a handstand position, until the foot of the leading leg, followed by the foot of the trailing leg, reach the floor. When both feet are on the floor, the performer returns to an erect standing position.

==Variations==
* In a &quot;one-handed walkover&quot;, only one hand is placed on the floor. 
* A valdez is a back walkover that begins in a sitting position.
* A &quot;backwards kickover&quot; or &quot;bridge kickover&quot; is a back walkover with a pause in the bridge position.

*Front walkover
