<text>According to the Book of Mormon, Abinadi () was a prophet who lived on the American continent about 150 BC. In the Book of Mormon account, Abinadi visited the court of King Noah at Lehi-Nephi, and pleaded for them to repent of their iniquity and live the law of Moses. Abinadi also gave Noah the message of the coming of the Lord Jesus Christ to earth in the flesh, to live among the children of men. Noah and his priests threatened Abinadi that unless he recalled all the words he had said against him and his priests, they would kill him. Abinadi stood by his words and Noah had him burned with fire. One of Noah&#x27;s priests, Alma the Elder, adhered to Abinadi&#x27;s message and eventually became a prophet himself.

==Etymology==
According to Todd Parker, the name &quot;Abinadi&quot; () appears to be symbolic. In Hebrew, &quot;ab&quot; means &quot;father,&quot; &quot;abi&quot; means &quot;my father,&quot; and &quot;nadi&quot; is &quot;present with you,&quot; so the name &quot;Abinadi&quot; may reflect his mission; it may mean something like &quot;my father is present with you.&quot; In the Book of Mormon account, the alleged reason for killing him was because Abinadi claimed that God would come down and would be with man (see ). That was the charge of blasphemy they finally used to put him to death ().

==Praise==
M. Russell Ballard of the Quorum of the Twelve Apostles praised Abinadi for courage and obedience: “Abinadi infuriated wicked King Noah with his courageous testimony of the Lord Jesus Christ. Eventually this great missionary offered the ultimate sacrifice for his witness and faith but not before his pure testimony touched one believing heart. Alma, one of King Noah’s priests, ‘repented of his sins ... , [accepted Jesus as the Christ,] and went about privately among the people, and began to teach the words of Abinadi’ (Mosiah 18:1). Many were converted to the gospel of Jesus Christ as a direct result of Abinadi’s powerfully borne testimony of the Savior, believed by one soul, Alma.”

While serving in the Seventy, Cree-L Kofford discussed Abinadi&#x27;s influence: “What is there that is so special about Abinadi? Perhaps it was his total obedience as he went, presumably alone, among those whom he must have known would take his life, to deliver the word of the Lord and to cry repentance to the people. Perhaps it is the very fact that we know so little about him, or perhaps it was simply the way with which he faced the adversities which came into his life in such a straightforward, ‘square-to-the world’ way. Whatever the reason, Abinadi was and is special. His life, lived so long ago, still has the power to excite the mind and cause the pulse to pound.”

==Comparison to King Benjamin==
According to Todd Parker, there are many similarities between the speeches of King Benjamin and Abinadi.

<text>Ivens François &quot;Toon&quot; Buffett (died 19 July 2004) was a political figure from the Australian External Territory of Norfolk Island. He was the first sitting minister of an Australian government to be assassinated.

Before his death, Buffett was serving as Lands Minister and Deputy Chief Minister of Norfolk Island. He had previously served one term as Chief Executive.

==Murder==
On 19 July 2004, Buffett was shot dead in his office with his own Lee-Enfield .303 rifle.

Buffett&#x27;s 25-year-old son, Leith, was charged with the murder of his father. Legal proceedings then found that Leith was incompetent to stand trial, because of severe mental illness. Leith has been described as believing that his father was &quot;The Evil Prophet&quot;.

Due to the inadequacy of jail cells and hospice facilities on the island, Leith Buffett was transferred to Sydney, first to Long Bay Prison&#x27;s hospital, a matter which required an amendment to the Crimes Act 1999 in New South Wales.

Police stressed that the Buffett case was unrelated to the 2002 death of Janelle Patton who, until Buffett&#x27;s death, had been the only person in the island&#x27;s recent history to be murdered there.

<doc id="844072" wikidata="Q189219" url="?curid=844072" title="Shelter-half">
<text>A shelter-half is a simple kind of partial tent designed to provide temporary shelter and concealment when combined with one or more sections. Two sheets of canvas or a similar material (the halves) are fastened together with snaps, straps or buttons to form a larger surface. The shelter-half is then erected using poles, ropes, pegs, and whatever tools are on hand, forming an inverted V structure. Small tents like these are often called pup tents in American English.

==Background==
Shelter halves are a mainstay of most armies, and are known from the mid 19th century. Often, each soldier carries one shelter-half and half the poles, etc., and they pair off to erect a two-man tent. The size and shape of each half shelter piece may vary from army to army, but are typically rectangular, triangular or lozenge shaped. When time and space allow, some forms of half-shelters can be combined into a larger, more complex tent.

Shelter-halves are usually designed to serve double duty as ponchos against the rain, or for the concealment of snipers. While the fabric is often simple olive drab, several nations use camouflaged fabric. The first printed camouflage for soldiers were the Italian &quot;Telo mimetico&quot; introduced in 1929 for their half-shelters. The first camouflage uniforms were the Second World War German paratrooper smock, based on their M1931 Splittermuster shelter-halves. The Austro-Hungarian army used the M888 zeltbahn that was first issued in an ochre color, later in grey color that had a bayonet hole allowing the rifle to be used as an ad-hoc tent pole. Russian Army has used &quot;plasch-palatkas&quot; (literally &quot;cape-tents&quot;, designed to be used as both a part of a larger tent cover, or an individual weatherproof cape) since 1894, and the modern version, virtually unchanged since, was introduced in 1936, with the camo version being available since 1942. To add some confusion, the ordinary waterproofed cape with a similar name (&quot;plasch-nakidka&quot;, &quot;cape-overcoat&quot;) was issued at the same time, but these were not intended to combine with each other.

A commercially sold example known as a zelter shelter exists.

<doc id="844076" wikidata="Q1592242" url="?curid=844076" title="Head crash">
<text>A head crash is a hard-disk failure that occurs when a read–write head of a hard disk drive makes contact with its rotating platter, slashing its surface and permanently damaging its magnetic media. It is most often caused by a sudden severe motion of the disk, for example the jolt caused by dropping a laptop to the ground while it is operating or physically shocking a computer.

==Head details==
A head normally rides on a thin film of moving air entrapped at the surface of its platter (some drives manufactured by Conner Peripherals in the mid-1990s used a thin liquid layer instead). The distance between the head and platter is called the flying height. The topmost layer of the platter is made of a Teflon-like material that acts like a lubricant. Underneath is a layer of sputtered carbon. These two layers protect the magnetic layer (data storage area) from most accidental touches of the read-write head.

The disk read-and-write head is made using thin film techniques that include materials hard enough to scratch through the protective layers. A head crash can be initiated by a force that puts enough pressure on the platters from the heads to scratch through to the magnetic storage layer. A tiny particle of dirt or other detritus, excessive shock or vibration (such as accidentally dropping a running drive), can cause a head to bounce against its disk, destroying the thin magnetic coating on the area the heads come in contact with, and often damaging the heads in the process. After this initial crash, countless numbers of fine particles from the damaged area can land on other areas and can cause more head crashes when the heads move over those particles, quickly causing significant damage and data loss, and rendering the drive useless. Some modern hard disks incorporate free fall sensors to offer protection against head crashes caused by accidentally dropping the drive.

==Differences at RPMs==

Since most modern drives spin at rates between 5,400 and 15,000 RPM, the damage caused to the magnetic coating can be extensive. At 7,200 RPM, the edge of the platter is traveling at over , and as the crashed head drags over the platter surface, the read-write head generally overheats, making the drive or at least parts of it unusable until the head cools down.

==Older heads==

Older drives typically rotated far more slowly and had larger heads flying higher above the surface of the medium. However, since in many cases, the medium was housed in a removable cartridge or pack and since air filtration was comparatively crude, crashes were fairly frequent and invariably expensive.

==Laptops==
Head crashes have been a frequent problem on laptop computers since they first incorporated hard drives, since a laptop computer is more liable to be dropped or jostled than a stationary machine. This has led to the development of protective technologies that &quot;park&quot; the head at a safe distance from the disk when sudden motion, such as that of a dropped computer, is detected. Active Hard Disk Protection software and sensors began appearing in laptops in 2003 with IBM introducing it in their ThinkPad line of laptops, becoming common around 2009 with the introduction of Windows 7. These drives are also designed to &quot;self-park&quot; during sudden power loss, which has reduced the incidence of head crashes. With the popularization of solid-state drives, which have no head or disk, the head-crash issue has been nearly eliminated in modern laptops.

<doc id="844077" wikidata="Q5379417" url="?curid=844077" title="Enos (Book of Mormon prophet)">
<text>Enos (; ) is a figure in the Book of Mormon who is a son or grandson of Jacob, a Nephite prophet and author of the Book of Enos. According to the Book of Mormon, Enos lived sometime in the 6th century BC.

== Narration ==

=== Nephite record keeping ===
According to the Book of Mormon narrative, Enos was third in the series of record keepers who maintained the record of the Nephites, a set of metal plates containing the spiritual and secular history of the Nephites. Enos was given charge of the record by his father, Jacob, son of Lehi and brother of Nephi. Both Nephi and Jacob had kept the record previously, recording &quot;First&quot; and &quot;Second Nephi&quot; and the &quot;Book of Jacob&quot;, respectively. Enos&#x27;s contribution to the record, the &quot;Book of Enos&quot;, consists of a single chapter, told in the first person, describing his own conversion and subsequent ministry.

Following Enos&#x27;s death the record of the Nephites was kept by Enos&#x27; son, Jarom.

=== Early life ===
No details of Enos&#x27;s early life are given except that he had been taught by his father &quot;in the nurture and the admonition of the Lord&quot;. Because Enos begins his story by telling of his &quot;wrestle which [he] had before God, before [he] received a remission of [his] sins&quot;, it is sometimes assumed that he had been rebellious prior to that time. President Spencer W. Kimball said, &quot;Like many sons of good families he strayed. How heinous were his sins I do not know, but they must have been grievous&quot;.

=== Conversion ===
Enos relates that, while hunting beasts in the forest, his &quot;soul hungered&quot; and he knelt and prayed for forgiveness. His prayer continued throughout the day and into the night, until he heard a voice, saying: &quot;Enos, thy sins are forgiven thee, and thou shalt be blessed&quot;.
Having obtained personal forgiveness, Enos continued to pray on behalf of his people, the Nephites, and was given to understand that they would be blessed &quot;according to their diligence in keeping [God&#x27;s] commandments&quot;. His faith being strengthened by these revelations, he began to pray for &quot;[his] brethren, the Lamanites&quot;, who had become estranged from the Nephites and were now their enemies. He received a promise that the record of the Nephites would be preserved and would be brought forth to the Lamanites in the Lord&#x27;s &quot;due time&quot;.

=== Ministry ===
According to the Book of Mormon, following his conversion, Enos went forth prophesying to the Nephites. He testifies that the Nephites tried to &quot;restore the Lamanites to the true faith in God&quot;, but that they were unsuccessful. He describes the Lamanites as having become &quot;wild, and ferocious, and a blood-thirsty people&quot;. The Nephites, in contrast, are industrious at farming and herding, but Enos makes it clear that they were &quot;stiffnecked&quot; and continual preaching of the word of God was necessary to keep them from &quot;going down speedily to destruction&quot;.

At the close of his record, Enos testifies of his unshakeable faith in his Redeemer.

== Interpretation ==

=== Representing a dual message of the Book of Mormon ===
In &quot;Americanist Approaches to the Book of Mormon&quot;, literary critic Terryl Givens suggests, in agreement with Grant Hardy, that there are two types of salvation emphasized by the Book of Mormon, both exemplified by Enos. He prays for his individual salvation and shortly after, prays for the salvation of his people. Enos demonstrates, according to Givens, a broader theme of the book promoting both an individual relationship with Christ as well as the gathering of scattered Israel.

=== Possible origin of the name ===
The name &quot;Enos&quot; or &quot;Enosh&quot; (Hebrew: אֱנוֹשׁ) appears in at least two books of the Bible. It means &quot;mortal man&quot;, in Hebrew, which Hugh Nibley remarks as being similar in definition to the name &quot;Adam&quot;.

In the Book of Genesis, Enos is the first son of Seth who figures in the Generations of Adam, and consequently referred to within the genealogies of Chronicles, and the genealogy of Jesus in the Gospel of Luke.

==Family==
Between the records of Jacob and Enos, more than 120 years is covered, which leads some to question Enos&#x27; timeline. It has been suggested that Jacob may not have been his father, rather his grandfather, as Enos never mentions his father by name.

<text>Smokey and the Bandit is a 1977 American action comedy road film starring Burt Reynolds, Sally Field, Jackie Gleason, Jerry Reed, Pat McCormick, Paul Williams, and Mike Henry. The film marks the directorial debut of stuntman Hal Needham.

The film follows Bo &quot;Bandit&quot; Darville (Reynolds) and Cledus &quot;Snowman&quot; Snow (Reed), two truck-driving bootleggers attempting to illegally transport 400 cases of Coors beer from Texarkana to Atlanta. While the Snowman drives the truck carrying the beer, the Bandit drives blocker, in a 1977 Pontiac Trans Am, to distract law enforcement and keep the attention off the Snowman. During their run, they are pursued by Sheriff Buford T. Justice (Gleason), of Portague County, Texas.

&quot;Smokey and the Bandit&quot; was a box office success, grossing $127 million against a $4.3 million budget, becoming the second-highest-grossing domestic film of 1977 in the United States.

The film became the first installment of the &quot;Smokey and the Bandit&quot; trilogy as the start in the &quot;Smokey and the Bandit&quot; franchise.

==Plot==
Wealthy Texan Big Enos Burdette and his son, Little Enos, frequently bet notable truckers in Atlanta to bootleg 400 cases of Coors Beer from Texarkana, Texas, to Atlanta in 28 hours, but all have failed with many being arrested. They find local legend Bo &quot;Bandit&quot; Darville at a truck rodeo at Lakewood Fairgrounds and offer him $80,000 () to take the bet. The Bandit accepts and recruits his friend Cledus &quot;Snowman&quot; Snow and his dog Fred to drive the truck, while Bandit drives a black Pontiac Trans Am (Trigger) as a &quot;blocker&quot; to divert attention away from the truck and its illegal cargo.

The pair arrive in Texarkana one hour early and load up the truck, but just as they head back, Carrie, a runaway bride, intercepts Bandit and jumps in his car, unwittingly making him an indirect target of Sheriff Buford T. Justice, a career Texas lawman whose witless son, Junior, was to have married Carrie. The Justices engage in a high-speed hot pursuit and doggedly chase Bandit all the way to Georgia to retrieve Carrie and arrest the Bandit, while successive comical mishaps cause their cruiser to experience increasing damage along the way.

Bandit attracts more police attention across Dixie as Cledus barrels on toward Atlanta with the contraband beer, but they are helped en route by many colorful characters via CB radio. Neither Buford nor any other lawmen know of Cledus&#x27;s illegal manifest, while Bandit is likewise unaware that Buford is chasing him because of Carrie, whose jumpiness inspires Bandit to give her the CB handle &quot;Frog&quot;.

Just after re-entering Georgia, Cledus is rescued by Bandit after being stopped by a Georgia State Patrol motorcycle trooper, as state and local police intensely pursue Bandit with roadblocks and a helicopter to track his movement. With four miles (6.4 km) left, Bandit, discouraged by the unexpected mounting attention, is ready to give up, but Cledus, who initially thought they would fail, takes the lead and smashes through the roadblock at the fairgrounds&#x27; main entrance. They make it back with ten minutes to spare, but instead of taking the payoff, Carrie and Bandit accept a double-or-nothing offer from Little Enos: a challenge to run up to Boston and bring back clam chowder in 18 hours. They quickly escape in one of Big Enos&#x27;s Cadillacs as police flood the racetrack.

Buford arrives at the fairgrounds, his cruiser now a barely functioning wreck. When Bandit passes him, he gets on the CB to Buford and the pair briefly exchange some mutual respect, before Buford demands to know Bandit&#x27;s whereabouts. Bandit initially directs him to the Burdettes, but then respectfully gives his real location right behind Buford, who continues his chase leaving Junior behind, and with more parts falling off his cruiser as he limps off after Bandit.

==Cast==
==Production==
===Development===
Needham originally planned the film as a low-budget B movie with a production cost of $1 million, with Reed as the Bandit. Needham had great difficulty getting any studios or producers to take his project seriously, being better known in the film industry as a stuntman. He obtained the attention of studios and aimed the film at a more mainstream release after his friend Reynolds read the script and agreed to portray the Bandit, with Reed now portraying the Bandit&#x27;s friend the Snowman. Reed would eventually play the Bandit in &quot;Smokey and the Bandit Part 3&quot;, in which Reynolds only appeared in a cameo near the end. At the time, Reynolds was the top box office star in the world.

In the original script, Carrie was called Kate while Big Enos and Little Enos were called Kyle and Dickey. The Bandit&#x27;s car was a second-generation Trans Am and the prize for completing the run was a new truck rather than $80,000. Reynolds revealed in his autobiography that Needham had written the first draft script on legal pads. Upon showing it to his friend, Reynolds told Needham that it was the worst script he had ever read, but that he would still make the movie. Most of the dialogue was improvised on set.

Universal Studios bankrolled &quot;Smokey and the Bandit&quot; for $5.3 million, figuring it was a good risk. Just two days before production was to begin, Universal sent a &quot;hatchet man&quot; to Atlanta to inform Needham that the budget was being trimmed by $1 million. With Reynolds&#x27; salary at $1 million, Needham was left with only $3.3 million to make the film. Needham and assistant director David Hamburger spent 30 hours revising the shooting schedule.

&quot;Buford T. Justice&quot; was the name of a real Florida Highway Patrolman known to Reynolds&#x27;s father, who was once Police Chief of Riviera Beach, Florida. His father was also the inspiration for the word &quot;sumbitch&quot; used in the film, a variation of the phrase &quot;son-of-a-bitch&quot; that, according to Reynolds, he uttered quite often. Gleason was given free rein to ad-lib dialogue and make suggestions. It was his idea to have Junior alongside him throughout the film. In particular, the scene where Sheriff Justice unknowingly encounters the Bandit in a roadside diner (a &quot;choke and puke&quot; in CB lingo) was not in the original story but was rather Gleason&#x27;s idea.

The film&#x27;s theme song, &quot;East Bound and Down&quot;, was written virtually overnight by Reed. He gave Needham a preview of the song and, getting no reaction, offered to rewrite it. In response, Needham told Reed that he liked the song so much that if Reed changed even a word or a note, Needham would &quot;choke him&quot;. It became one of Reed&#x27;s biggest hits and his signature song.

The film features the custom clothing and costuming of Niver Western Wear of Fort Worth, Texas. Niver provided much of the western attire worn in the film, as well as the custom-made sheriff&#x27;s uniforms Gleason wore throughout the film.

While made to take advantage of the ongoing 1970s CB radio fad, the film added to the craze. Though the film &quot;Moonrunners&quot; (1975) is the precursor to the television series &quot;The Dukes of Hazzard&quot; (1979–1985), from the same creator and with many identical settings and concepts, the popularity of &quot;Smokey and the Bandit&quot; and similar films helped get the &quot;Dukes&quot; series on the air. Three actors from the main cast of &quot;The Dukes of Hazzard&quot; appear in small uncredited roles in &quot;Smokey and the Bandit&quot;: Ben Jones, John Schneider, and Sonny Shroyer (who played a police officer in both). In return, Reynolds portrayed Boss Hogg (originally portrayed by Sorrell Booke) in the film adaptation &quot;The Dukes of Hazzard&quot; (2005). Reynolds is referenced by name in several early episodes of the series.

===Casting===
Before Gleason was cast in the film, Richard Boone was originally considered for the role of Buford T. Justice. Sally Field only accepted the part after her agent advised her that she needed a big movie role on her résumé. Universal executives initially resisted casting Field, claiming she was not attractive enough, but Reynolds insisted on her involvement. Field enjoyed making the film, but remembers that virtually the entire project was improvised.

===Filming===
Principal photography of the film began on August 30, 1976. The movie was primarily filmed in Georgia, in the cities of McDonough, Jonesboro and Lithonia. The scenes set in Texarkana were filmed in Jonesboro and the surrounding area and many of the chase scenes were filmed in the surrounding areas on Highway 54 between Fayetteville and Jonesboro for a majority of the driving scenes, Mundy&#x27;s Mill Road, Main Street in Jonesboro, Georgia State Route 400, I-85 (Pleasant Hill exit) and in McDonough. However, the scene where they drive through the Shell gas station was filmed in Ojai, California, on the corner of Ojai Avenue and El Paseo Road. Much of the surrounding scene comes from that immediate vicinity. The scene featuring the racetrack was filmed at Lakewood Speedway at the old Lakewood Fairgrounds on Atlanta&#x27;s south side. The roller coaster in the movie was the Greyhound. It had not been used for some time and was repainted for the film. It was destroyed in &quot;Smokey and the Bandit II&quot; and in a flashback scene in &quot;Part 3&quot;. The area around Helen, Georgia, was used for some locations. The scene where Sheriff Justice&#x27;s car has the door knocked off by a passing semi-truck was shot on Georgia State Route 75, north of Helen. The tow truck driver was a local garage owner, Berlin Wike. Reynolds and Field began dating during the filming.

According to an interview with Susie McIver Ewing on The RetroZest Podcast, she was picked to play the role of Hot Pants Hilliard after the dailies footage (shot in the Atlanta area) of the original actress playing the role was inadvertently destroyed on its way from Atlanta to Los Angeles. The new Hot Pants scene had to quickly be refilmed as a part of a second unit in the San Fernando Valley and was shot at a drive-in restaurant near Hansen Dam named Baby Beef Burgers, which has since been demolished. This same restaurant was used for a scene in the 1983 Stephen King Movie &quot;Christine&quot;, which was ultimately cut in the final film (it can be viewed as a deleted scene on the DVD release of the film).

===Vehicles===

Hal Needham saw an advertisement for the soon-to-be-released 1977 Pontiac Trans Am and knew right away that it would be the Bandit&#x27;s car, or, as Needham referred to it, a character in the movie. He contacted Pontiac and an agreement was made that four 1977 Trans Ams and two Pontiac LeMans four-door sedans would be provided for the movie. The Trans Ams were actually 1976-model cars with 1977 front ends (from 1970 to 1976, both the Firebird/Trans Am and Chevrolet Camaro have two round headlights and in 1977, the Firebird/Trans Am was changed to four rectangular headlights, and the Camaro remained unchanged). The decals were changed to 1977-style units, as evidenced by the engine size callouts on the hood scoop being in liters rather than cubic inches, as had been the case in 1976. The hood scoop on these cars says &quot;6.6 LITRE&quot;, which, in 1977, would have denoted an Oldsmobile 403-equipped car or a non-W-72, 180 hp version of the 400 Pontiac engine.

The cars were 1976 models, the engines fitted to them were 455ci power plants, the last year these engines were offered for sale before withdrawal. All four of the cars were badly damaged during production, one of which was all but destroyed during the jump over the dismantled Mulberry bridge. The Trans Am used for said jump was equipped with a booster rocket, the same type that was used by Evel Knievel during his failed Snake River Canyon jump. Needham served as the driver for the stunt (in place of Reynolds), while Lada St. Edmund was in the same car (in place of Field). By the film&#x27;s ending, the final surviving Trans Am and LeMans were both barely running and the other cars had become parts donors to keep them running. This gives rise to various continuity errors with Justice&#x27;s patrol car, which during some chase sequences is shown with a black rear fender, which then reverts to the car&#x27;s bronze color again in later scenes. When it is finally torn off along with the car&#x27;s roof in the impact with the girder, the missing fender still reappears later on in the film. The car also sustains visible damage in various collisions which then disappears in later scenes.

The Burdettes&#x27; car is a 1974 Cadillac Eldorado convertible painted in a &quot;Candy Red&quot; color scheme and is seen briefly at the beginning of the movie and in the final scene as the Bandit, the Snowman, Fred the dog, and Frog use it to make their escape. Three Kenworth W900A short-frame semi trucks, driven by Reed, were each equipped with 38-inch sleepers. Two units were 1974 models, as evidenced by standard silver Kenworth emblems on the truck grille, and one unit was a 1973 model, as evidenced by the gold-painted Kenworth emblem on the truck&#x27;s grille, signifying Kenworth&#x27;s 50 years in business. The paint code for each truck was coffee brown with gold trims and the mural trailer used was manufactured by Hobbs Trailers in Texas with a non-operational Thermo King Refrigeration unit. This is obvious, because there is no fuel tank on the underside of the trailer to power the refrigeration unit, and the unit is never heard running.

===Legal status of Coors beer===
In 1977, Coors was unavailable for sale east of Texas. Its lack of additives and preservatives meant that Coors could spoil in one week without refrigeration, explaining the film&#x27;s 28-hour deadline. A 1974 &quot;Time&quot; magazine article explains that Coors was so coveted for its lack of stabilizers and preservatives, and Coors Banquet Beer had a brief renaissance. Future President Gerald Ford, after a trip to Colorado, hid it in his luggage to take it back to Washington, D.C. President Dwight D. Eisenhower had a steady supply airlifted by the Air Force to Washington. Carl Yastrzemski of the Boston Red Sox would bring home several cases, after playing on the West Coast, by stashing them in the equipment trunks on the team&#x27;s plane. Frederick Amon smuggled it once a week from Colorado to North Carolina and sold it for four times the retail price.

Coors, now owned jointly by the Coors and Molson families and based in Montréal, Quebec, is still brewed just outside Denver, Colorado. It is now sold in all states as Molson ships it in refrigerated train cars and bottled locally and sold in different parts of the country including the eastern United States.

==Soundtrack==

The theme music &quot;East Bound and Down&quot; was sung and co-written by Reed (credited under his birth name, Jerry Hubbard) and Dick Feller. It became Reed&#x27;s signature song and is on multiple albums, including &quot;Country Legends&quot; and his live album &quot;Jerry Reed &quot;Live!&quot; (Still)&quot;. In 1991, it was arranged for orchestra by Crafton Beck and recorded by Erich Kunzel and the Cincinnati Pops Orchestra for their album &quot;Down on the Farm&quot;. Several other groups, such as the U.S. rock band Tonic and U.K.-based country cover band We Be Ploughin&#x27; have also covered it. Reed also penned and performed the song for the opening credits, entitled &quot;The Legend&quot;, which tells of some of the Bandit&#x27;s escapades before the events of the film, and the ballad &quot;The Bandit&quot;, which is in several versions in the movie and on the soundtrack. Bill Justis is the first name on the credits for the soundtrack, as he composed and arranged original music throughout the film. Musicians such as Beegie Adair and George Tidwell played on the soundtrack. Five-string banjo player Bobby Thompson is prominent toward the end of &quot;East Bound and Down&quot;. The soundtrack album was released in 1977 on vinyl, cassette, and 8-track through MCA Records.

==Reception==
===Box office===
&quot;Smokey and the Bandit&quot; was a sleeper hit. It premiered at Radio City Music Hall in New York City, where it performed badly. It then opened in just the South of the United States over the Memorial Day weekend and grossed $2,689,851 in 386 theaters. By the end of June, it had played in major Southern markets, including Charlotte, Atlanta, Jacksonville, New Orleans, Memphis, Dallas, and Oklahoma City, grossing $11.9 million. It opened in other Northern states at the end of July. With an original budget of $5.3 million (cut to $4.3 million two days before initial production), the film eventually grossed $126,737,428 in North America, making it the second-highest-grossing movie of 1977 (only &quot;Star Wars&quot; earned more, with $221.3 million). The worldwide gross is estimated at over $300 million. Reynolds said in 2015 that he most enjoyed this film, and had the most fun making it, of his career.

===Critical response===
Critical reception was largely positive. On the review aggregation website Rotten Tomatoes, it has a 72% rating based on 36 reviews. The site&#x27;s consensus states: &quot;Not much in the head but plenty beneath the hood, &quot;Smokey and the Bandit&quot; is infectious fun with plenty of car wrecks to keep your eyes glued&quot;.

Film critic Leonard Maltin gave the film a good rating (3 stars out of a possible 4) and characterized it as &quot;about as subtle as &quot;The Three Stooges&quot;, but a classic compared to the sequels and countless rip-offs which followed&quot;. In his review in the &quot;Chicago Tribune&quot;, Gene Siskel gave the film two stars and complained that the film failed to tell the audience when the clock started on the beer run, thus reducing suspense. He claimed that the Bandit is never made aware of Frog&#x27;s leaving Junior at the altar, which is why the Bandit continually asks why a Texas sheriff is chasing him. The film&#x27;s editors, Walter Hannemann and Angelo Ross, were nominated for the Academy Award for Best Film Editing.

Alfred Hitchcock claimed that the film was one of his favorites. Upon meeting Reynolds, Billy Bob Thornton told him that Americans from the region where the film is set consider the film to be less cinema and more documentary. &quot;Smokey and the Bandit&quot; was released in the United Kingdom on August 28 and was a success there, garnering positive reviews.

==Cultural influence==
===Pontiac Trans Am===
After the debut of the film, the Pontiac Trans Am became wildly popular, with sales almost doubling within two years of the film&#x27;s release. It outsold its Chevrolet Camaro counterpart for the first time. Reynolds was given the 1977 vehicle used during promotion of the film as a gift, though the car itself never actually appeared in the film. Because of the popularity of the film and the sales success of the Trans Am, the president of Pontiac Alex Mair promised to supply Reynolds with a Trans Am each year. Due to his financial difficulties in 2014, Reynolds put his vast collection of artwork and memorabilia up for auction, including the Trans Am. High estimates for the car were up to $80,000, but the actual sale price was $450,000. Also up for auction was a go-kart replica of the car, which sold for nearly $14,000. In 2015, a Florida-based automobile customization company built 77 Trans Ams modeled after the car that Reynolds drove in the film. These new models were built off the same Camaro platform, came with the Pontiac arrowhead, flaming bird, and Bandit logos, and the instrument panels, center consoles, and hood scoops emulating their 1977 counterparts, and were signed by Reynolds. Some differences included the use of a supercharged 454-CID (7.4-liter) Chevrolet-sourced engine that put out 840 HP, and four round headlights, which appeared on the 1967–69 Firebirds/Trans Ams only; the actual 1977–81 models had rectangular headlights.

===Diablo sandwich===
The &quot;diablo sandwich&quot; ordered by Sheriff Justice in the Arkansas barbecue restaurant scene has entered popular culture as a minor reference to the film. Though no authoritative source identifies the composition of the sandwich, there are several possibilities. A segment of the CMT program &quot;Reel Eats&quot; used a sloppy joe-style recipe consisting of seasoned ground beef, corn, and sour cream. Another proposal, based more closely on images from the film and the shooting location of the scene (at an Old Hickory House restaurant in Georgia), is pulled pork and hot sauce on a hamburger bun. Other sources in East Texas (from whence Sheriff Justice hails) are familiar with the popular regional delicacy known as the Diablo Sandwich. It consists of any of the various Louisiana-style hot sauces on Texas toast-style bread alongside the fourth most famous product of Pittsburg, Texas (behind Pilgrim&#x27;s Pride, Cavender&#x27;s, and Carroll Shelby)Pittsburg Hot Links.

===The Bandit Run===
The first run in 2007 to celebrate the 30th anniversary of the movie, The Bandit Run was the brainchild of Dave Hall, owner of Restore A Muscle Car. A group of Trans Am owners and fans of the movie take part in an annual road trip from Texarkana to Jonesboro, recreating the route taken by the characters in the film. The Bandit Run quickly became a fixture, celebrating the 40th anniversary of the movie with a special 2017 screening of the film attended by Reynolds and a recreation of the jump undertaken by the Bandit and Frog across a river.

===Mobil 1 commercial===
In 2014, petroleum company Mobil 1 produced television commercials, featuring then-NASCAR driver Tony Stewart, closely based on the film. Called &quot;Smoke is the Bandit&quot; and playing on Stewart&#x27;s nickname, the commercials featured him as the Bandit opposite commentators Darrell Waltrip as the Snowman and Jeff Hammond as Buford T. Justice. The story replaced the Coors beer with Mobil 1 products. The advertisements lampoon the film and feature a Pontiac Trans Am and a cover version of the song &quot;East Bound and Down&quot;. The commercials were produced after Stewart mentioned that the movie was one of his favorites.

==Television censorship and alternative versions==

When &quot;Smokey and the Bandit&quot; first aired on American network television in early 1979, censors were faced with the challenge of toning down the raw language of the original film. For this purpose, they overdubbed dialogue deemed offensive, which was common practice. The most noted change made for network broadcast was the replacing of Buford&#x27;s often-spoken phrase &quot;sumbitch&quot; (a contraction of &quot;son of a bitch&quot;; usually in reference to the Bandit) with the phrase &quot;scum bum&quot;. This phrase achieved a level of popularity with children and the 2007 Hot Wheels release of the 1970 Firebird Trans Am has &quot;scum bum&quot; emblazoned on its ducktail.

Except for Gleason, the original actors mostly redubbed their lines for the television version. Actor Henry Corden, who voiced Fred Flintstone after original performer Alan Reed died the same year the film was released, was used to replace a considerable amount of Sheriff Justice&#x27;s dialogue. In the U.K., the heavily dubbed version was shown for several years, particularly by the BBC. However, in more recent years, the original version has been shown (on ITV, a commercial channel), usually with the stronger language edited out, often quite awkwardly. The theatrical release has a few lines deleted, including an edit in which Sheriff Justice tells a state trooper to &quot;fuck off&quot; after the sheriff called his vehicle &quot;a piece of crap&quot;. His expletive is obscured when a passing big rig sounds its horn. At the time, using &quot;fuck&quot; would immediately require an R rating and this self-censorship allowed the film to avoid this rating and reach a much larger audience, however the scene and the obscured expletive were played for comedy value and written as such, with the passing truck being the gag of the scene more than a way to avoid the censors.

In 2006, a DVD re-release was issued of &quot;Smokey and the Bandit&quot; featuring a digitally remastered audio track with 5.1 Dolby-compatible surround sound. Many of the film&#x27;s original sounds were replaced. For instance, the diesel engine start and run-up sequence in the opening sequence of the film were completely dubbed over with a new sound. A few other examples of sound effect replacement occur when the Bandit takes off after getting the reluctant Cledus involved in the bet, the Bandit comes to a screeching halt on a roadway moments before picking up Carrie, and when Buford&#x27;s car top comes off. Some of the original sound effects (such as Cledus&#x27;s dog Fred barking) and music (such as the final chase to the Southern Classic) were removed and not replaced. Earlier DVD releases and the 40th Anniversary Blu-ray of the film have the original soundtrack intact. Major portions of the audio background have been modified with different engine sounds or tire squeals from the original film. The updated version of the film features sound inaccurate for what would be produced by the Trans Am or the numerous other Pontiac vehicles in the film. The original film had correct sounds that were usually recorded live as the action took place.

==Sequels==
The film was followed by two theatrical sequels: &quot;Smokey and the Bandit II&quot; (1980) and &quot;Smokey and the Bandit Part 3&quot; (1983). The second film was a modest box office success, earning $66.1 million against a $17 million budget.

The third film – which had no involvement from either Hal Needham or Sally Field and contained only a short cameo appearance by Burt Reynolds – revolved entirely around Jackie Gleason&#x27;s character, was panned by critics, and was a box office bomb, earning only $7 million against a $9 million budget.

==Television miniseries==

A television miniseries were produced and aired in 1994 for Universal Television&#x27;s &quot;Action Pack&quot; with actor Brian Bloom playing a younger version of the Bandit. The three original films introduced two generations of the Pontiac Trans Am and the Dodge Stealth in the television miniseries.

== Documentary ==
&quot;The Bandit&quot; (2016) is a documentary film about the making of &quot;Smokey and the Bandit&quot; and working with director and stuntman Hal Needham. Featuring interviews with Burt Reynolds and the crew, the film explores the unique relationship between Reynolds and Needham. The film was directed by Jesse Moss.

==Television series==
In October 2020, a &quot;Smokey and the Bandit&quot; TV series was revealed to be in development, with a pilot written by David Gordon Green and Brian Sides and also executive produced with his Rough House Pictures confederates Jody Hill, Danny McBride and Brandon James, as well as Seth MacFarlane and Erica Huggins of Fuzzy Door.

<doc id="844086" wikidata="Q18279" url="?curid=844086" title="Cantons of the Federation of Bosnia and Herzegovina">
<text>The ten cantons of the Federation of Bosnia and Herzegovina, one of the two political entities of Bosnia and Herzegovina, are its federal units with a high level of autonomy. The cantons were established by the Law on Federal Units (Cantons) on 12 June 1996 as a result of the Washington Agreement of 1994 between the representatives of the Bosnian Croats and Bosniaks.

Five of the cantons have a Bosniak majority: Una-Sana Canton, Tuzla Canton, Zenica-Doboj Canton, Bosnian-Podrinje Canton Goražde and Sarajevo Canton; three have a Croat majority: Posavina Canton, West Herzegovina Canton and Canton 10, and the two cantons are regarded as ethnically mixed: Central Bosnia Canton and Herzegovina-Neretva Canton. The most populous canton is Tuzla Canton, while Canton 10 is the largest by area.

== Creation ==

The cantons of the Federation of Bosnia and Herzegovina are a result of an artificial application of 1993 Vance–Owen Peace Plan for the war in Bosnia and Herzegovina, applied only to one part of Bosnia and Herzegovina. The plan originally foresaw the cantonization of the whole of Bosnia and Herzegovina.

The cantons were to be named after rivers and cities in the Federation of Bosnia and Herzegovina, based on the tradition from the Kingdom of Yugoslavia&#x27;s naming of banates in 1929.

The ten cantons of the Federation of Bosnia and Herzegovina were created by the Law on Federal Units (Cantons), enacted by the Constituent Assembly of the Federation of Bosnia and Herzegovina on 12 June 1996. Of these, five have Bosniak and three Croat majorities, while two cantons are mixed. The cantons with Bosniak-majority are: Una-Sana Canton, Tuzla Canton, Zenica-Doboj Canton, Bosnian-Podrinje Canton Goražde and Sarajevo Canton, while the Croat-majority cantons are Posavina Canton, West Herzegovina Canton and Canton 10. The two mixed cantons are Central Bosnia Canton and Herzegovina-Neretva Canton.

== Jurisdiction ==

As the Federation of Bosnia and Herzegovina was created on the principle of decentralisation, the cantons have strong autonomy which is guaranteed by a long list of exclusive jurisdictions in the Constitution of the Federation of Bosnia and Herzegovina, including police, education, cultural policy, housing policy, public services, local economic policy, energy policy, media policy, welfare, tourism and the right of the cantons to introduce taxation and borrow money. Other jurisdictions are shared with the Federation of Bosnia and Herzegovina, including enforcement of human rights, health and environmental policy, infrastructure, social welfare, tourism and natural resources. Although in some areas the constitution foresaw a mixed jurisdiction between the Federation of Bosnia and Herzegovina and the cantons, such as tourism and energy policy, the cantons are the dominant actors. The principle of decentralisation is especially emphasised in the two mixed cantons, where the decisions regarding core issues, such as education, are left in the jurisdiction of the municipalities.

== Governance ==

The cantons consist of municipalities. A canton has its own government headed by a premier. The premier has his own cabinet, and is assisted in his duties by various cantonal ministries, agencies, and cantonal services. Five of the cantons (Una-Sana, Tuzla, Zenica-Doboj, Bosnian-Podrinje, and Sarajevo) have a Bosniak majority, three (Posavina, West Herzegovina and Canton 10) have a Bosnian Croat majority, while two of them (Central Bosnia and Herzegovina-Neretva) are &quot;ethnically mixed&quot;, meaning neither ethnic group has a majority and there are special legislative procedures for the protection of their political interests.

<text>Marion Bay is a rural / residential locality in the local government area (LGA) of Sorell in the South-east LGA region of Tasmania. The locality is about east of the town of Sorell. The 2016 census recorded a population of 72 for the state suburb of Marion Bay.
Marion Bay is also a large bay on the south-east coast of Tasmania. Its south-western shore is contained by the Marion Bay Important Bird Area.

==History== 
Marion Bay is a confirmed locality.

===European discovery===
Abel Tasman first anchored just north of a small island in the southern part of this large bay in 1642, and landed in the area he named Frederick Henricx Bay (made up of what is now called Blackman Bay, Marion Bay and North Bay).
The name Frederick Henry Bay was mistakenly moved to its present location by Captain Tobias Furneaux. Subsequently, Frederick Henricx Bay was later named Marion Bay after the Breton navigator Marion du Fresne, who arrived in his ship &quot;Mascarin&quot; with &quot;Marquis de Castries&quot; in March 1772. Marion recorded that &quot;One sailor found numbers of crayfish, lobsters and huge crabs, and the oysters there are good and abundant&quot;.

Marion&#x27;s landing is the first recorded sighting and description of the Aboriginal people of Tasmania/lutruwita by Europeans. One of the Aboriginal men was shot dead by Marion&#x27;s men after the Aboriginals turned on them. Marion then sailed to New Zealand where he was killed by Māori in the Bay of Islands.

==Geography==
The waters of Blackman Bay and Marion Bay form the eastern to southern boundaries.

==Road infrastructure==
Route C337 (Marion Bay Road) runs through from west to south.

==Festivals==
Marion Bay was home to the Tasmanian edition of the Falls Festival, first held in December 2003. The Marion Bay Festival was the second Falls Festival location, after Lorne, Victoria commenced in 1993. It became an annual New Year&#x27;s Eve event, being held for 17 years until 2019, when COVID-19 led to the festival&#x27;s postponement, and ultimately cancellation. The Festival was run simultaneously alongside other Falls Festivals held in Lorne, Victoria and Byron Bay, New South Wales, with the Byron Bay festival commencing in 2013.

The Bream Creek Show has been taking place in Marion Bay for more than a century. Noted for a display of large pumpkins, the show was first hosted in 1897 in the pavilion at Coppington. It is held every year in March and includes rides for children, wood chopping and other family entertainment.

== Army worm infestation ==
In December 2008, an infestation of army worms in Marion Bay was reported in the national media. Despite the problems residents encountered, infestations of this sort are apparently common wherever the worms are. In October 2008 a general alert was sounded that such an infestation was likely to occur.

<doc id="844091" wikidata="Q4747267" url="?curid=844091" title="Ammon (Book of Mormon missionary)">
<text>In the Book of Mormon, Ammon () is a prominent Nephite missionary and a son of King Mosiah. He originally opposes the church, but along with his brothers and Alma the Younger, is miraculously converted. Following his conversion he serves a mission to the Lamanites and converts Lamoni and his people.

==Claims about origins of the name==
Mormon apologist Hugh Nibley claimed that &quot;Ammon (or Amon)&quot; () is &quot;the commonest name in the Book of Mormon&quot; and &quot;the commonest name in the Egyptian Empire&quot; (which embraced Palestine at Lehi&#x27;s time, which fell within its Late Period).

==Book of Mormon Narrative==
===Early life and conversion===
As one of the four sons of King Mosiah, Ammon has tremendous influence among his people, the Nephites. He rejects the Church and attempts to turn the people from the teachings of the prophets. Because of the fervent prayers of their parents, Alma the Younger and the four sons of Mosiah have a conversion experience much like that of Paul the Apostle; an angel appears to them on the road and rebukes them for their wickedness. The shock puts Alma the Younger into an insensible state for a time; the specific effect on Ammon is not described, but he becomes fully converted to the Gospel and desires to serve as a missionary to the Lamanites. 120 b.c. to 76 b.c.

===Successful mission===
Ammon and his brothers spend several years teaching the Gospel to the Lamanites. Ammon goes first to the land of Ishmael. He is captured by the Lamanites and taken before their king, Lamoni. Lamoni asks his purpose in straying so far from Nephite lands. When Ammon replies that he wants to live among Lamoni&#x27;s people, the king, impressed, offers him one of his daughters. Ammon refuses but becomes a servant in the king&#x27;s household, assisting others in caring for the king&#x27;s flocks.

When bandits attack, Ammon directs the others to encircle the flock so they will not scatter and confronts the bandits. Fellow servants tell him they will be killed if the bandits acquire any of the flock. As he is seemingly outnumbered, the thieves attack Ammon. From a distance he kills several with his sling and then in hand-to-hand combat cuts off the arms of every robber who attacks him. Ammon&#x27;s defense of the King&#x27;s flock convinces the servants and the king that he is favored by God. The king, his household, and the entire kingdom convert to the Gospel.

Later, Ammon&#x27;s love and respect for Lamoni impresses Lamoni&#x27;s father, the king of all the Lamanites. As a result, the Lamanite king accepts the teachings of Aaron, Ammon&#x27;s brother, and is converted. The Lamanites converted as a result of Ammon&#x27;s ministry are called the &quot;Anti-Nephi-Lehies&quot; until they change their name to the People of Ammon after their migration to the Nephite land of Jershon. They swear to never take up arms again (and never do), although the two thousand stripling warriors are later recruited from among their sons.

<doc id="844093" wikidata="Q8069089" url="?curid=844093" title="Zeniff">
<text>Zeniff () is a king in the Book of Mormon whose personal account is recorded in the Book of Mosiah. He is the father of King Noah and the grandfather of King Limhi. Zeniff is the first king of Nephite colonists who come from Zarahemla and settle in the land of Lehi-Nephi. The Nephites believe this land to be rightfully theirs by inheritance (as it was the homeland of the early Nephites), even attempting to reclaim the land by force. In an expedition in which he spies for the Nephites, Zeniff claims to see good in the Lamanite inhabitants. He argues against a militaristic approach and causes an internal battle among the Nephite army. Zeniff later leads a group of Nephites back to Lehi-Nephi and establishes a peace treaty with the Lamanite king whose people inhabit the land. Zeniff’s people prosper with him as king, but the Lamanite king betrays their treaty and attempts to exploit them. Zeniff and his people successfully fight off the Lamanites’ multiple aggressions, and Zeniff&#x27;s reign lasts about forty years, after which he passes the kingship to one of his sons, Noah. Scholarly interpretations have highlighted Zeniff&#x27;s shifting perceptions of Lamanites, such as how his opinion changes when his people contends with the Lamanites and the role that Zeniff&#x27;s narration plays in racializing Lamanites in the Book of Mormon.

== Narrative ==

Zeniff participates in two separate expeditions to reclaim the land of Lehi-Nephi, which the Nephites believed to be &quot;the land of [their] inheritance,” as it was the homeland of the early Nephites. In the first attempt, recorded briefly in the Book of Omni and again in Zeniff&#x27;s personal account, an army of Nephites journeys to the land of Lehi-Nephi to reclaim the land through force. Zeniff is among this group. He is sent as a spy to gather information for the Nephite army to plan a military attack on the Lamanites who inhabit the land. However, Zeniff claims to see “good” among the Lamanites and decides they should not be destroyed. He suggests that the Nephites instead establish a treaty with the Lamanites for the land. His argument goes against the orders of their expedition&#x27;s &quot;blood-thirsty&quot; leader, who sentences Zeniff to death. Fighting breaks out among the Nephites, ultimately saving Zeniff, which results in the death of a majority of the army. Fifty survivors of this internal battle return to Zarahemla, while others disappear into the wilderness.

In his personal record, Zeniff describes himself as &quot;over-zealous to inherit the land of our fathers,&quot; and in around 200 BCE, he gathers another group of Nephites and returns to the land of Lehi-Nephi. Zeniff appeals to Laman, the king of the Lamanites, and establishes a peace treaty that allows Zeniff’s cohort to settle in the land. King Laman grants Zeniff the lands of Lehi-Nephi and Shilom after commanding the Lamanites in those lands to depart. The Nephites settle in the lands, and Zeniff becomes king.

The people of Zeniff live peacefully for twelve years, but Zeniff begins to realize that King Laman had deceived him and did not intend for them to live in peace, but intended for the Lamanites to exploit the Nephites and take, by force, the goods they produced. At first the Lamanite aggressions are limited to small pillaging raids, but they eventually instigate a major battle. Zeniff equips his people with weapons and they enter the battle with Zeniff leading the front line. Zeniff and his people go into battle praying for “deliverance” from their enemies, and emerge victorious. He attributes the Nephites&#x27; success in battle to their faith in God.

Another ten years of watchful peace follow until the death of King Laman, when Laman&#x27;s son and successor again tries to drive the Nephites out of their land. The land of Shilom is adjacent to the land of Nephi-Lehi, but its location leaves Shilom open to enemy attacks on both the north and south sides. Despite this disadvantage, Zeniff prepares his people, sending the women and children into the wilderness and arming all of his men, young and old, for battle. They once again defeat the Lamanites. In his record, Zeniff explains the second war from the perspective of the Lamanites and claims they &quot;have been deceived by the traditions of their fathers.&quot; After a reign of about forty years, Zeniff grows old and confers the kingdom to his son, Noah.

== In Mormon Studies ==

=== Perception of Lamanites ===
In a commentary, Brant Gardner states that the scrubbed initial plan to retake the land of Nephi by force is one of the Nephites&#x27; &quot;rare overtly offensive actions&quot;; elsewhere in the Book of Mormon, Nephites are generally on the defensive in violent interactions with Lamanites. Gardner also presents a possible explanation for Zeniff&#x27;s declaration that he had seen &quot;much good&quot; in the Lamanites. He argues that Zeniff would have needed sufficient evidence of his claim to convince a majority of the Nephite army to fight with him. Gardner proposes that Zeniff may have believed the &quot;foundational promise of the Nephites&quot;—in which God promised prosperity in return for those who keep his commandments—to be equally true in application to the Lamanites. With this belief, Gardner argues Zeniff may have considered the Lamanites&#x27; wealth and power to constitute evidence of virtue.

In &quot;Understanding the Book of Mormon: A Reader&#x27;s Guide&quot;, Grant Hardy points out Zeniff’s desire to negotiate a treaty of peace with the Lamanites, as opposed to fighting them for their land. Hardy contrasts Zeniff’s good opinion of the Lamanites with Enos and Jarom&#x27;s, who &quot;found nothing of value in Lamanite culture.&quot; Hardy also addresses Zeniff&#x27;s inclusion of the exact death count of the first war (3,043), which included the Lamanites. Hardy suggests that Zeniff&#x27;s “careful counting” shows his &quot;concern for his enemies as individuals.&quot; He then posits that Zeniff&#x27;s shift in opinion of the Lamanite people from &quot;good&quot; to &quot;lazy&quot; and &quot;idolatrous&quot; suggests that &quot;the man of peace has become a man of war&quot;, evidenced further by Zeniff&#x27;s neglect to count the dead after the second war. In &quot;The Annotated Book of Mormon&quot;, Hardy reasons that Zeniff is humanizing the Lamanites when he explains their beliefs and motives before the battle.

=== Lamanite racialization ===
In &quot;Make Yourselves Gods: Mormons and the Unfinished Business of American Secularism&quot;, Peter Coviello uses Zeniff’s account to expand on ideas of Lamanite racialization in the Book of Mormon. Coviello states that Zeniff’s acknowledgement of Lamanite motivations &quot;offers an account not of Lamanite wickedness but of Lamanite grievance: of a people precipitated into sustained warfare by a sense of usurpation, harm, and lasting injustice.&quot; Coviello proposes that in Zeniff’s account, the Lamanites express their view of the Nephites as &quot;persecutors who use the idea of bloodlines, of inherited sins, to authorize their depredations,&quot; which Coviello states is an insight into the Nephite&#x27;s &quot;racialization of righteousness.&quot;

<text>In the Book of Mormon, Limhi () is the third and final king of the second Nephite habitation of the land of Lehi-Nephi. He succeeds his father, Noah. Led by Ammon (a descendant of Zarahemla), Limhi and his people escape from the Lamanites with his people to the land of Zarahemla.

== Synopsis ==

After the death of their previous king, Noah, the surviving members of the Nephite colony living in the land of Lehi-Nephi appoints one of his sons, Limhi, to the throne. Living under occupation by a Lamanite army, Limhi&#x27;s colonists attempt three violent revolts, all of which the Lamanites quash.

When a band of Nephites from Zarahemla, led by an explorer named Ammon, rediscover the Lehi-Nephi colony, Limhi gathers his community, and he and Ammon read and recite their respective people&#x27;s histories to each other and before the convocation.

Resolving to escape subjugation, Limhi consults with Ammon about what to do, and Gideon, an advisor, devises a plan to intoxicate and incapacitate the Lamanite guards with a gift of alcohol. The plan is successful, enabling Limhi and his people to flee the land of Lehi-Nephi and travel with Ammon to Zarahemla.

On reaching Zarahemla, Limhi exchanges histories with King Mosiah, ruler of the Nephites there, and their peoples unite.

== Interpretations ==
Records play a significant role in Limhi&#x27;s arc. Limhi&#x27;s dialogue includes numerous allusions to and citations from records in the setting, such as the brass plates, Abinadi&#x27;s trial, and the Record of Zeniff, his grandfather. In the words of John Gee, this implies Limhi &quot;spent a good deal of time studying and memorizing the records of his people&quot; and that he is somewhat bookish, &quot;probably more comfortable in the library than the throne room&quot;. According to Gee, this may implicitly be why Limhi&#x27;s virtuous character diverges substantially from that of his flagitious father Noah. Richard Bushman calls the exchanges and recitations of histories that Limhi participates in &quot;public ceremoni[es]&quot; as part of a pattern where &quot;[i]n the Book of Mormon world, histories nourished and instructed people&quot; and provided the basis &quot;of their conceptual lives&quot;. In this interpretation, Limhi&#x27;s recitation of history with Mosiah and Ammon is a microcosm of the Book of Mormon&#x27;s self-constructed purpose of unifying world identity by reaffirming the Abrahamic covenant and reinvigorating Christianity.

== Reception ==

=== Visual art ===

American artist George M. Ottinger&#x27;s painting &quot;Baptism of Limhi&quot;, depicting the Mosiah 25:17–18 scene of Alma baptizing Limhi, was completed in 1872 and displayed at the Utah Territorial State Fair that year. The full painting was seven and a half feet by five feet. A version of this image, likely less detailed than the original was, was later published as an illustration in the 1888 &quot;The Story of the Book of Mormon&quot;.

In approximately 1883, landscape painter Reuben Kirkham produced a panorama of Book of Mormon scenes (the location or survival of which are unknown) which included &quot;Last Battle of King Limhi&quot; and &quot;The Last Battles of the People of Limhi&quot;.

=== Namesakes ===
Nineteenth-century Latter-day Saint settlers in territorial Oregon named Fort Limhi after king Limhi. They also named the Lemhi River after the Book of Mormon king&#x27;s name (albeit misspelled). Lemhi County, Idaho receives its name from a misspelling of Limhi.

<text>In the Book of Mormon, Lamoni () is king of the land of Ishmael, part of territory controlled by the Lamanites. Lamoni&#x27;s father is king over all of the Lamanites. After initially having the Nephite missionary Ammon imprisoned, Lamoni later allows him to be his servant. After Ammon saves some of Lamoni&#x27;s servants and animals in a seemingly miraculous way. Lamoni then believes that Ammon is the Great Spirit, but learns that he is only a servant of the Great Spirit, or God. After his conversion, Lamoni is traveling with Ammon when he encounters his father. At the peril of his life Lamoni defends Ammon. Eventually Lamoni helps gain freedom for Ammon and his fellow Nephite missionaries to preach freely in the Lamanite areas.

== Narration ==
The missionary Ammon visits the land of Ishmael where he is captured and taken to King Lamoni, who rules a portion of Lamanite lands. Ammon becomes his servant and protects his flocks from attackers. After the severed arms of the attackers are brought to Lamoni, he asks Ammon about the Great Spirit. Lamoni then learns from Ammon about the gospel and believes him. As he asks the Lord for mercy, Lamoni falls to the ground as if he is dead. Two days later, as they get him ready for burial, the queen calls for Ammon, who tells her Lamoni is not dead. At Ammon&#x27;s word, the king revives and talks of Jesus, he and the queen are overwhelmed with joy, and they both fall down as if dead. Ammon and all of the witnessing servants go down as well. A woman named Abish who already believes in God touches the queen&#x27;s hand and she gets up and talks of the gospel. Then she touches Lamoni&#x27;s hand and he gets up and testifies of what he has learned.

Lamoni wants to bring Ammon to meet his father, the king over all the Lamanites, but Ammon feels directed by God to go release his brothers from prison. Ammon and Lamoni travel to Middoni, but on the way they meet Lamoni&#x27;s father, who is offended Lamoni missed his feast and additionally that he is traveling with a Nephite. He tells Lamoni to kill Ammon, and tries to kill Lamoni when he refuses. Ammon protects Lamoni, Lamoni&#x27;s father realizes he can&#x27;t hurt them, and he gives Lamoni permission to govern his land without any interference. Lamoni proceeds to build places of worship in his land and allows more missionaries to come and preach there.

Lamoni&#x27;s people, along with other converted Lamanites ruled by his father, become the Anti-Nephi-Lehies.

==Interpretation==
===Lamoni&#x27;s daughter===
In &quot;The Annotated Book of Mormon&quot;, Grant Hardy points out that Lamoni may have been politically motivated to offer his daughter as a wife to Ammon. Such a marriage would have been a beneficial alliance if Ammon had revealed to Lamoni that he was the son of a Nephite king.

=== Lamanite faith ===
Fatimah Salleh and Margaret Olsen Hemming point out that while the Lamanites are often described as passing down bad traditions and lacking a relationship with God, the way Lamoni and his wife talk about the Great Spirit implies they have at least limited religion of some sort, as well as knowledge and interaction with God. Specifically, Lamoni and his people have a name they call God and the idea that he punishes bad people.

==Town of Lamoni==
Lamoni, Iowa, USA was named after the scriptural Lamoni, and was the headquarters of the Community of Christ (formerly the Reorganized Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints), a separate group from The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints based in Salt Lake City, from 1880 to 1920. It was originally named New Buda by Hungarian immigrants, but in 1870, Joseph Smith III renamed the settlement &quot;Lamoni&quot; after him.

<doc id="844100" wikidata="Q359265" url="?curid=844100" title="David C. Broderick">
<text>David Colbreth Broderick (February 4, 1820 – September 16, 1859) was an attorney and politician, elected by the legislature as Democratic U.S. Senator from California. He lived in New York until moving to California during the Gold Rush. He was a first cousin of politicians Andrew Kennedy of Indiana and Case Broderick of Kansas. At age 39, Broderick was fatally wounded in a duel with jurist David S. Terry, a former friend.

==Early years==
Broderick was born in 1820 in Washington, D.C., on East Capitol Street just west of 3rd Street. He was the son of an Irish stonecutter and his wife. His father had come to the United States in order to work on the construction of the United States Capitol. In 1823, Broderick moved with his parents to New York City; there, he attended public schools and was apprenticed to a stonecutter.

==Political career==
Broderick became active in politics as a young man, joining the Democratic Party. In 1846, he was the Democratic candidate for U.S. Representative from New York&#x27;s 5th congressional district, but lost the election to Whig candidate Frederick A. Tallmadge, who gained 42% of the vote to Broderick&#x27;s 38%.

==State Senate career==
Broderick was a member of the California State Senate from 1850 to 1852, serving as its president from 1851 to 1852. Broderick was acting Lieutenant Governor from January 9, 1851, to January 8, 1852, following incumbent John McDougall&#x27;s succession to the governorship. From then on, Broderick effectively had political control of San Francisco, which under his &quot;utterly vicious&quot; rule soon became notorious for municipal corruption. In the words of his biographer Jeremiah Lynch:

Broderick became rich from this system.

In 1857, Broderick was elected by the state legislature as U.S. Senator from California (popular election of senators did not start until the 20th century). Broderick began his term on March 4, 1857.

==Feud and death==
At that time, just prior to the start of the American Civil War, the Democratic Party of California was divided between pro-slavery and &quot;Free Soil&quot; factions. Broderick led the Free Soilers. One of his closest friends was David S. Terry, formerly the Chief Justice of the California State Supreme Court. He advocated extending slavery into California. Terry lost his re-election bid because of his pro-slavery platform, and he blamed Broderick for the loss.

Terry, considered even by his friends as caustic and aggressive, made some inflammatory remarks at a party convention in Sacramento, which Broderick read. He took offense, and sent Terry an equally vitriolic reply, describing:

Passions escalated; on September 13, 1859, former friends Terry and Broderick, both expert marksmen, met outside of San Francisco city limits at Lake Merced for a duel. The pistols chosen for the duel had hair triggers, and Broderick&#x27;s discharged prior to the final &quot;1-2-3&quot; count, firing prematurely into the ground. Thus disarmed, he was forced to stand as Terry shot him in the right lung. Terry at first believed the shot to be only a flesh wound, but it proved to be fatal. Broderick died three days later, and was buried under a monument erected by the state in Lone Mountain Cemetery in San Francisco. He is the only U.S. Senator ever to be killed in a duel while in office.

In 1942, he was reinterred at Cypress Lawn Memorial Park in Colma, California.

==Legacy==
Edward Dickinson Baker, a close friend of Abraham Lincoln, spoke at Broderick&#x27;s funeral. He expressed the widely held belief that Broderick was killed because of his anti-slavery stance:

Some maintain that in his death Broderick became a martyr to the anti-slavery cause, and the episode was part of a national spiral towards civil war. At the Republican National Convention in Chicago in May 1860, a portrait of the late Senator Broderick was hung. In 1864 another portrait would be hung from the flagstaff of the Hibernian Lincoln and Johnson Club in San Francisco.

About thirty years later, Terry was shot to death by Deputy United States Marshal David Neagle while threatening Supreme Court Justice Stephen Johnson Field, a friend of Broderick.
Broderick County, Kansas Territory was named for the senator. The former town of Broderick, California, and Broderick Street in San Francisco were also named in his honor.

In 1963, Carroll O&#x27;Connor was cast as Broderick, with Brad Dexter as Justice Terry, in &quot;A Gun Is Not a Gentleman&quot; on the syndicated television anthology series, &quot;Death Valley Days&quot;, hosted by Stanley Andrews. The program portrays Terry mortally wounding Senator Broderick in 1859. Though past allies as Democrats, Terry, a defender of slavery, challenges the anti-slavery Broderick to a duel. After he fatally shoots Broderick, Terry is tried, but the case is dismissed.

<doc id="844103" wikidata="Q5403426" url="?curid=844103" title="Samuel the Lamanite">
<text>According to the Book of Mormon, Samuel the Lamanite is a prophet who lived in the ancient Americas, sent by Jesus Christ around 5 BC to teach and warn the Nephites just before his birth in the Old World. The account is recorded in Helaman 13–16.

==Ministry==

Samuel first appears in . Samuel is notable in the Book of Mormon as he is a Lamanite prophet. Most prophets that appear in the book are Nephites.

After attempting to preach to the people in Zarahemla, and being rejected, he was told by revelation to return and prophesy to the people. He was not allowed into the city. In one of the more iconic stories of the Book of Mormon, he preached on the wall of the city, calling the people to repentance for their sins, prophesying about the impending advent of Jesus Christ in the Old World, and warning of the destruction of the Nephite nation. The people in the city tried to kill him by throwing stones and shooting arrows, but he was protected from harm by divine providence.

Angered by his preaching, the Nephites of Zarahemla throw rocks at Samuel and try to kill him. When his sermon is finished, Samuel flees the land of the Nephites and returns to Lamanite territory where he ministers to his people and &quot;was never heard of more among the Nephites&quot;.

==In popular media==
In 1997, Donny Osmond left his starring role in the tour of &quot;Joseph and the Amazing Technicolor Dreamcoat&quot; to play the role of Samuel the Lamanite in the Hill Cumorah Pageant.

<doc id="844108" wikidata="Q3591958" url="?curid=844108" title="Ether (prophet)">
<text>According to the Book of Mormon, Ether () is a Jaredite prophet, one of the last surviving Jaredites, and the primary author of the Book of Ether.

==Narration==

Ether&#x27;s account, which Moroni abridged into the Book of Ether, is found in the twenty four plates discovered by the people of Limhi in the Book of Mosiah.

Ether&#x27;s grandfather Moron had been king of the Jaredites. Moron was overthrown and &quot;dwelt in captivity all the remainder of his days&quot;. Ether&#x27;s father, Coriantor, was born while his father was captive and Coriantor &quot;dwelt in captivity all his days&quot;. Ether &quot;was a prophet of the Lord&quot; and &quot;lived in the days of Coriantumr; and Coriantumr was king over all the land&quot;. He sees and prophesies many things but the people reject his teachings because they refuse to believe what they have not seen for themselves. Because of their rejection, Ether retreats to hide in a cave and record what happens to his people. He is later sent by the Lord to prophesy to King Coriantumr that he and his family can be saved if they will repent, but is again rejected. At the end of his record, Ether reflects on whether he will be translated to heaven or die like a normal man.

==Teachings==

===Polygamy===
According to Daniel H. Ludlow, it is not clear whether or not the Jaredites were commanded by the Lord to practice polygamy. The following evidences have been cited which might indicate that they did practice polygamy:
* Many of the men had large numbers of sons and daughters. For example, the brother of Jared had 22 sons and daughters () and Orihah had 31 sons and daughters ().
* Riplakish had &quot;many wives and concubines&quot; (). He was condemned by the Lord for his wickedness, but it is not clear whether or not this condemnation was because of his &quot;many wives.&quot;
* In it states that &quot;every &quot;man&quot; kept the hilt of his sword in his right hand, in the defence of his property and his own life and of his &quot;wives&quot; and children.&quot; This verse seems to indicate that the people practiced polygamy, but whether or not it was sanctioned by the Lord is not made clear in the record.

===Cycle of Righteousness===

 shows a pattern repeated many times in the Book of Mormon:
# During the righteous reigns of Emer and Coriantum the people prospered exceedingly (v. 15-25)
# Under the reign of Heth, the people began to join together in secret combinations, and they turned to wickedness (v. 26-27)
# The Lord sent prophets to warn the people of their terrible circumstances (v. 28)
# The people of Heth rejected the prophets (v. 29)
# The judgments of God fell upon the people (v. 30-33)
# The people humbled themselves and repented and the Lord blessed them again with prosperity (v. 34-35)

The Jaredites were able to be wealthy and remain righteous for more than 100 years (see v. 15-25).

===Secret Combinations===

In four claims about secret combinations are made:
# Secret combinations are wicked and forbidden of the Lord (v. 18-19)
# Secret combinations are &quot;had among all people&quot; (v. 20)
# Secret combinations &quot;caused the destruction&quot; of both the Jaredite and Nephite nations (v. 21)
# Whatever nation upholds secret combinations &quot;shall be destroyed&quot; (v. 22)

===New Jerusalem===
In claims about the New Jerusalem are made:
# It will be &quot;the holy sanctuary of the Lord&quot; ()
# It will be built on the American continent for the remnant of the seed of Joseph (v. 4–6)
# It will be a holy city like the Jerusalem built unto the Lord (v. 8–9)
# It will stand until the earth is celestialized (v. 8)
# It will be a city for the pure and righteous (v. 10)

==Comparison with Moroni==
The last prophet called of God to warn the Jaredite nation and to witness against them was Ether, the son of Coriantor. H. Donl Peterson notes that Moroni could have empathized with Ether, since both were prophets of God sent to preach to a people who were &quot;past feeling&quot; and who &quot;did reject all the words of the prophets&quot; (). Both men were the last of their once great civilizations, and both were called upon to record their final struggles and then were charged to be responsible for preserving the precious records of their fallen people.

<text>The Lockheed/&lt;wbr&gt;Boeing/&lt;wbr&gt;General Dynamics YF-22 is an American single-seat, twin-engine, stealth fighter technology demonstrator prototype designed for the United States Air Force (USAF). The design team, with Lockheed as the prime contractor, was a finalist in the USAF&#x27;s Advanced Tactical Fighter (ATF) competition, and two prototypes were built for the demonstration/validation phase. The YF-22 team won the contest against the YF-23 team for full-scale development and the design was developed into the Lockheed Martin F-22. The YF-22 has a similar aerodynamic layout and configuration as the F-22, but with notable differences in the overall shaping such as the position and design of the cockpit, tail fins and wings, and in internal structural layout.

In the 1980s, the USAF began looking for a replacement for its fighter aircraft to counter emerging threats such as the advanced Soviet Su-27 and MiG-29. A number of companies submitted their proposals, with the competition narrowing down to two teams for demonstration/validation. Northrop and McDonnell Douglas submitted the YF-23. Lockheed, Boeing and General Dynamics proposed and built the YF-22, which, although marginally slower and having a larger radar cross-section, was more agile than the YF-23. The Lockheed team was picked by the Air Force as the winner of the ATF competition in April 1991. The U.S. Navy considered adopting a naval version of the ATF, but these plans were later canceled due to cost.

Following the selection, the first prototype was retired as an exhibit at the Air Force Flight Test Museum, while the second continued flight testing until an accident relegated it to the role of an antenna test vehicle and it was later stored.

== Development ==
===Concept definition===
In 1981, the U.S. Air Force (USAF) began exploring concepts and developing requirements for an Advanced Tactical Fighter (ATF) that would eventually become a new air superiority fighter to replace the F-15 Eagle and F-16 Fighting Falcon. This was made more crucial by the emerging worldwide threats, including development and proliferation of Soviet MiG-29 &quot;Fulcrum&quot; and Su-27 &quot;Flanker&quot;-class fighter aircraft, A-50 &quot;Mainstay&quot; airborne warning and control system (AWACS), and more advanced surface-to-air missile systems. The ATF would take advantage of the new technologies in fighter design on the horizon including composite materials, lightweight alloys, advanced avionics and flight-control systems, more powerful propulsion systems and stealth technology.&lt;ref name=&quot;YF F/S&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;
The USAF sent out the ATF request for information (RFI) to the aerospace industry in May 1981 to explore what the future fighter aircraft could look like, and subsequently established a Concept Development Team (CDT) to analyze the results. Eventually code-named &quot;Senior Sky&quot;, the ATF at this time was still in the midst of requirements definition with both air-to-air and air-to-ground missions in consideration, and consequently there was substantial variety in the responses from the industry. Lockheed&#x27;s initial concept was a particularly large aircraft called CL-2016, nicknamed &quot;battlecruiser&quot; for its size, that resembled its SR-71/YF-12 with large delta wings and engines mounted in nacelles spaced away from the fuselage and would have had similarly high operating speed and altitude as a missile platform (or &quot;missileer&quot; per Lockheed).

In 1983, the ATF Concept Development Team became the System Program Office (SPO) at Wright-Patterson Air Force Base. After discussions with aerospace companies and Tactical Air Command (TAC), the CDT/SPO narrowed the requirements to an air superiority fighter with outstanding kinematic performance in speed and maneuverability to replace the F-15. Additionally, the SPO began to increasingly emphasize stealth for survivability, while still requiring fighter-like speed and maneuverability, due to the Air Force&#x27;s experience from &quot;black world&quot; projects such as the &quot;Have Blue&quot;/F-117 (&quot;&quot;Senior Trend&quot;) and the Advanced Technology Bomber (ATB) program (which would result in the B-2, or &quot;Senior Ice&quot;&quot;). With stealth becoming a core requirement, Lockheed&#x27;s design team, led by Bart Osborne from its Skunk Works division at Burbank, California, migrated away from its initial SR-71-like &quot;battlecruiser&quot; concept and instead began drafting a design that resembled the company&#x27;s F-117. However, the faceted shape, resulting from Lockheed using the same &quot;Echo&quot; computer program that it had used to design the F-117, gave the design very poor aerodynamic performance that would be unsuitable for a fighter. Lockheed would perform poorly throughout the concept exploration phase, placing among the bottom of the competing contractors.

===Demonstration and validation===

By November 1984, the SPO had further narrowed the requirements and released the Statement of Operational Need (SON), with requirements calling for a takeoff weight fighter that places strong emphasis on stealth, maneuver, and supersonic cruise without afterburners, or supercruise. In September 1985, the Air Force sent out technical request for proposals (RFP) to a number of aircraft manufacturing teams for demonstration and validation (Dem/Val). In addition to the ATF&#x27;s demanding technical requirements, Dem/Val also placed a great deal of importance on systems engineering, technology development plans, and risk mitigation. The top four proposals, later reduced to two to reduce program costs, would proceed with Dem/Val as finalists; there was initially no requirement for prototype air vehicles. At the time, the Air Force anticipated procuring 750 ATFs at a unit flyaway cost of $35 million in fiscal year (FY) 1985 dollars (~$ in ). Furthermore, under Congressional pressure to combine efforts with the Air Force to reduce costs, the U.S. Navy joined the ATF program initially as an observer and eventually announced in 1988 that it would use a variant/derivative of the winning design to replace its F-14 Tomcat as the Navy Advanced Tactical Fighter (NATF); the service called for the procurement of 546 aircraft.
Having performed poorly during ATF concept exploration while also losing the ATB to Northrop who had a curved surface design, Lockheed abandoned faceting in 1984 and began incorporating curved shapes and surfaces. Although its analytical tools were initially not able to calculate for such shapes, good empirical results from radar range testing at Helendale, California, gave Lockheed confidence in designing a stealthy aircraft with smooth, curved surfaces, thus greatly improving its aerodynamic characteristics. As Lockheed gradually became able to analyze curved shapes, the final design submitted for Dem/Val, designated Configuration 090P, would have an arrowhead-like forward fuselage shape, swept trapezoidal wings, four empennage tail surfaces, S-shaped inlet ducts obscuring the engine face, and an internal rotary missile launcher. In addition to the change in aircraft design, Lockheed also shifted much more engineering talent and manpower to its ATF effort, appointing Sherman Mullin as the program manager, and had its draft proposals aggressively red-teamed by a group led by retired Air Force general Alton D. Slay. The resulting proposal improvements were substantial, particularly the systems engineering volume.

The ATF RFP would see some alterations after its first release; the SPO drastically increased all-aspect stealth requirements in December 1985 after discussions with Lockheed and Northrop regarding their experiences with the &quot;Have Blue&quot;/F-117 and ATB/B-2, and the requirement for flying technology demonstrator prototypes was added in May 1986 due to recommendations from the Packard Commission, a federal commission by President Ronald Reagan to study Department of Defense procurement practices. Seven companies submitted bids in July 1986. Owing to the immense investments companies were expected to make on their own, teaming was encouraged by the SPO. Following proposal submissions, Lockheed, Boeing, and General Dynamics formed a team to develop whichever of their proposed designs was selected, if any. Northrop and McDonnell Douglas formed a team with a similar agreement.

On 31 October1986, Lockheed and Northrop, the two industry leaders in stealth aircraft, were selected as the first and second place respectively; Sherman Mullin would credit the Lockheed&#x27;s top rank to their proposal&#x27;s system engineering volume, an area other contractors had not emphasized. The two teams, Lockheed/Boeing/General Dynamics and Northrop/McDonnell Douglas, were awarded $691 million contracts in FY 1985 dollars (~$ in ) and would undertake a 50-month demonstration and validation phase, culminating in the flight test of the two teams&#x27; prototypes, the YF-22 and the YF-23; Pratt &amp; Whitney and General Electric had earlier been awarded contracts to develop the competing prototype propulsion systems with the designations YF119 and YF120 respectively. Because the requirement for flying prototypes was a late addition due to political pressure, the prototypes were to be &quot;best-effort&quot; vehicles not meant to perform a competitive flyoff or represent a production aircraft, but to demonstrate the viability of its concept and to mitigate risk.

===Design evolution===

Work would be divided roughly equally among the team. Because Lockheed&#x27;s submission was selected as one of the winners, the company assumed leadership of the program partners. It would be responsible for the forward fuselage, cockpit, and stealthy edge treatments at Burbank as well as final assembly at Palmdale, California. Meanwhile, the wings and aft fuselage would be built by Boeing at Seattle, Washington, and the center fuselage, weapons bays, tail and landing gear would be built by General Dynamics at Fort Worth, Texas. The team would also invest $675 million (~$ in ) combined into their ATF effort during Dem/Val in addition to the government contract awards. The partners brought their design experience and proposals with them. Boeing&#x27;s design was large and long with a chin-mounted inlet, trapezoid wings, V-tail empennage surfaces (deemed sufficient due to the high operating speed), and palletized internal weapons. General Dynamics&#x27; design was smaller with fuselage and delta wings optimized for maneuver and supercruise, shoulder-mounted inlets, a large single vertical tail as the only empennage surface which compromised all-aspect stealth, and weapon bays in the center fuselage. However, much of the team&#x27;s scrutiny fell on Lockheed&#x27;s Configuration 090P, which was problematic due to being highly immature as a result of Lockheed&#x27;s greater focus on systems engineering rather than a point design. Nevertheless, 090P was the initial starting point that the team worked to refine.

Throughout Dem/Val, the SPO held System Requirement Reviews (SRR) with contractor teams and used the results of their performance and cost trade studies to develop the ATF system specifications and adjust or delete requirements that were significant weight and cost drivers while having marginal value. For instance, the requirement for eight internal missiles (represented by the baseline AIM-120A) was reduced to six. The team continually refined the design, making extensive use of analytical and empirical methods such as wind tunnel testing (18,000 hours by the end of Dem/Val), pole testing at radar ranges, and computational fluid dynamics (CFD) and computer-aided design (CAD) software. By early 1987, the design had evolved into Configuration 095, which replaced the rotary launcher with a flatter weapons bay to reduce volume and drag, and the shapes of the forward fuselage and leading-edge root extensions were recontoured to reduce their planform area, preventing uncontrollable pitch-up moments. Around this time, the design had split into two families, the 500 prefix that represents the full system design – or Preferred System Concept (PSC) — to be carried forward for full-scale development and the 1000 prefix that represents the same external airfame shape but designed to be built as prototype air vehicles instrumented for flight testing; Configuration 095 thus became 595 and 1095 respectively.
By mid-1987, detailed weight analysis of Configuration 595/1095 revealed that it was overweight by even if it could still nominally meet maneuver parameters. With weight likely to increase and compromises not forthcoming, the team chose to completely start over with a new design in July 1987, with Lockheed bringing a new director of design engineering, Richard Cantrell. Various different layouts were explored and after an intensive three-month effort, the team chose a new design, Configuration 614/1114, as the starting point in late 1987 with shoulder-mounted inlets and diamond-like delta wings similar to General Dynamics&#x27; design, and four empennage tail surfaces; notably, the diamond-like delta&#x27;s aerodynamic characteristics approached the original swept trapezoidal profile&#x27;s while offering much lower structural weight due to the longer root chord. The design evolved through the rest of 1987 and into May 1988, when Configuration 632/1132 was frozen as the YF-22. Changes include the shapes of the empennage surfaces to diamond-like and recontouring of the fore and aft fuselage to reduce wave drag following the deletion of the thrust reverser requirement after another SRR; the prototype thrust vectoring nozzles still retained some thrust reversing hardware provisions however, resulting in the prototype aft fuselage being bulkier than needed. Ultimately, the 50,000-lb takeoff weight still proved to be unachievable for both teams and was adjusted to , resulting in engine thrust increasing from to class. While the YF-22 configuration was frozen at an immature state relatively soon after the redesign to begin construction of the prototypes, the team continued evolving the configuration and PSC design into the F-22 for full-scale development.

In addition to the advanced air vehicle and propulsion design, the ATF required an integrated avionics system for sensor fusion to increase the pilot&#x27;s situational awareness and decrease workload; this demanded a leap in sensor and avionics capability. Avionics development was marked by extensive testing and prototyping and supported by ground and flying laboratories, with Boeing being responsible for avionics integration. As the YF-22 was a technology demonstrator for the airframe and engines, it would not have any of the mission systems avionics. Boeing would build the Avionics Ground Prototype (AGP) and also provide a Boeing 757 modified with the mission systems as a flying laboratory for avionics development; this aircraft would later be named the Flying Test Bed. The SPO would similarly adjust avionics requirements as a result of SRRs with contractors. Side-looking radar and infrared search and track (IRST) were deleted from the baseline requirement and became provisions for potential future addition, and a $9 million cap in FY 1985 dollars (~$ in ) for avionics per aircraft was placed by the SPO in 1989 on the baseline proposal for full-scale development.

Formally designated as the YF-22A, the first aircraft (PAV-1, serial number 87-0700, N22YF), with the GE YF120 engine, was rolled out on 29 August 1990 and first flew on 29 September 1990, taking off from Palmdale piloted by David L. Ferguson. The second YF-22A (PAV-2, s/n 87-0701, N22YX) with the P&amp;W YF119 made its maiden flight on 30 October at the hands of chief test pilot Thomas A. Morgenfeld. The aircraft was given the unofficial name &quot;Lightning II&quot; after Lockheed&#x27;s World War II-era fighter, the P-38 Lightning, which persisted until the mid-1990s when the USAF officially named the production F-22 &quot;Raptor&quot;. The F-35 later received the &quot;Lightning II&quot; name in 2006.

===Naval variant===
Because the NATF, which was to replace the F-14 Tomcat, required a lower landing speed than the ATF for aircraft carrier recovery while still attaining Mach 2-class speeds, the Lockheed team&#x27;s NATF design group went through several configurations to arrive at a design that would achieve acceptable characteristics for carrier operations. Boeing had advocated for a fixed-wing design while General Dynamics favored variable-sweep wings. After an internal competition and extensive wind tunnel testing, the team chose to incorporate variable-sweep wings in August 1989. The resulting aircraft would have been heavier, more complex, and more expensive than the Air Force ATF counterpart. The Lockheed team would submit its NATF design along with its ATF full-scale development proposal in December 1990, although the Navy would withdraw from the program shortly afterwards due to cost.

==Design==
The YF-22 was a prototype air vehicle intended to demonstrate the viability of the ATF air vehicle and propulsion design, which was ultimately meant to meet USAF requirements for survivability, supercruise, stealth, and ease of maintenance. The airframe has large diamond-like delta wings with leading edge swept back 48°, shoulder-mounted inlets, three internal weapons bays, and four empennage surfaces: canted vertical tails with rudders and all moving horizontal stabilizers. All major edges were aligned at a common set of angles for stealth. It had a tricycle landing gear, an aerial refueling receptacle centered on its spine, and an airbrake between the vertical tails. The cockpit had a completely frameless bubble canopy. Compared with its Northrop/McDonnell Douglas counterpart, the YF-22 has a more conventional design – its wings have larger control surfaces, such as full-span leading edge, and, whereas the YF-23 had two tail surfaces, the YF-22 had four, which made it more maneuverable than its counterpart.
The YF-22 was powered by two engines, with the General Electric YF120 mounted on the first aircraft and the second with the Pratt &amp; Whitney YF119. The fixed-geometry caret engine inlets were spaced away from the forward fuselage to divert the boundary layer and generate oblique shocks with the upper inboard corner for efficient supersonic compression; the serpentine inlet ducts fully shield the engine faces from any exterior view. The two-dimensional thrust vectoring nozzles reduce the infrared signature by flattening the exhaust plume and facilitating its mixing with ambient air. Chines run from the nose along the sides of the forward fuselage where they eventually meet the upper edge of the inlets; those then transition to sharp leading edge root extensions of the wings further aft. These produce vortices that improved high angle-of-attack characteristics. To reduce supersonic drag for supercruise, area rule was applied to the airframe shape and most of the fuselage volume lies ahead of the wing&#x27;s trailing edge, although the late configuration redesign meant that the prototype shaping was immature and not quite refined.

The aircraft had relaxed static stability and was controlled via fly-by-wire, integrated into the vehicle management system (VMS). The cockpit had a throttle and sidestick arrangement similar to the F-16 and simulated an operational fighter layout with a heads-up display (HUD), two primary multifunction displays (MFD) and three secondary MFDs. Some of the MFDs could be replaced by instrument panels as needed for specific flight test events. The prototype avionics incorporated a software-controlled stores management system (SMS) to test missile launching from internal weapons bays and its integration into the VMS; the weapons bays were also instrumented to measure vibration and acoustics.

===NATF-22===

The Lockheed team&#x27;s design for the Navy Advanced Tactical Fighter (NATF), sometimes referred to as &quot;NATF-22&quot; or &quot;F-22N&quot; (the design was never formally designated), would have differed from the Air Force version in many ways. Because the NATF needed lower landing speeds than the F-22 for aircraft carrier operations while still attaining Mach 2-class speeds, the design would have incorporated variable-sweep wings; furthermore, the Navy placed greater emphasis on loiter time for fleet air defense rather than supercruise, so the variable-sweep wings also improved endurance. The fuselage shaping was similar to the Air Force version, while the landing gears and arresting hook were strengthened for aircraft carrier landings; all of these changes would have resulted in a heavier, more complex, and more expensive aircraft. It retained four empennage surfaces and thrust vectoring nozzles, and the avionics would initially have been largely common with the F-22, although additional sensors and mission avionics had also been planned for maritime missions. The design would have had a similar weapons bay arrangement but with expanded weapons carriage, including the AIM-152 AAAM, AGM-88 HARM, and AGM-84 Harpoon.
While the Lockheed team would submit the NATF-22 design with its F-22 full-scale development proposal in December 1990, the Navy began backing out of the NATF program in late 1990 to early 1991 and fully abandoned NATF by FY 1992 due to escalating cost and thus the design never progressed beyond Dem/Val to full-scale development, or engineering and manufacturing development (EMD). Lockheed and Boeing would leverage aspects of the design, such as the variable-sweep wings, for several concepts for the Navy&#x27;s Advanced-Attack (A-X) program, which later became the Advanced Attack/Fighter (A/F-X) program with added fighter capability, the successor to the canceled A-12 Avenger II; however, A/F-X would also be canceled as a result of the 1993 Bottom-Up Review due to post-Cold War budget pressure.

== Operational history ==

=== Evaluation ===

Testing began with the first flight of PAV-1 on 29 September 1990. During the 18-minute flight, PAV-1 reached a maximum speed of and a height of , before landing at Edwards AFB. Following the flight, test pilot Dave Ferguson said that the remainder of the YF-22 test program would be concentrated on &quot;the manoeuvrability of the aeroplane, both supersonic and subsonic&quot;.

During the flight test program, unlike the YF-23, weapon firings and high (60°) angle of attack (AoA, or high-alpha) flights were carried out on the YF-22. Although not a program requirement, the aircraft fired AIM-9 Sidewinder and AIM-120 AMRAAM missiles from internal weapon bays. Flight testing also demonstrated that the YF-22 with its thrust vectoring nozzles achieved pitch rates more than double that of the F-16 at low-speed maneuvering as well as having excellent high angle-of-attack characteristics, with trimmed alpha of over 60° flown. The first prototype, PAV-1 with the General Electric engines, achieved Mach 1.58 in supercruise on 3 November 1990, while PAV-2 with the Pratt &amp; Whitney engines reached a maximum supercruise speed of Mach 1.43 on 27 December 1990; maximum speed was in excess of Mach 2.0. Flight testing continued until 28 December 1990, by which time 74 flights were completed and 91.6 airborne hours were accumulated. Following flight testing, the contractor teams submitted proposals for ATF full-scale development, with the Lockheed team&#x27;s PSC F-22 design being significantly refined and evolving to Configuration 638 for its submission.

On 23 April 1991, the Lockheed team was announced by Secretary of the Air Force Donald Rice as the winner of the ATF competition. The Lockheed team was rated higher on technical aspects, was considered lower risk (the YF-22 flew considerably more hours and sorties than its counterpart), and was considered to have more effective program management. Both designs met or exceeded all performance requirements; the YF-23 was stealthier and faster, but the YF-22 was more agile. It was speculated in the aviation press that the Lockheed design was also seen as more adaptable to the Navy&#x27;s NATF, but the U.S. Navy abandoned NATF by 1992. Instead of being retired, as with the case of PAV-1, PAV-2 subsequently flew sorties following the competition – it amassed another 61.6 flying hours during 39 flights. On 25 April 1992, the aircraft sustained serious damage during a go-around attempt as a result of pilot-induced oscillations. It was repaired but never flew again, and instead served as a static test vehicle thereafter. In 1991, it was anticipated that 650 production F-22s would be procured.

=== F-22 production ===

As the Lockheed team won the ATF competition, it was awarded the full-scale development, or Engineering &amp; Manufacturing Development (EMD) contract in August 1991 initially worth about $11 billion (~$ in ), which would ultimately allow it to proceed with production of operational aircraft. The EMD/production design would be further refined and evolve into Configuration 645. The EMD initially called for seven single-seat F-22A and two twin-seat F-22Bs, although the latter was eventually canceled to save on development costs and the orders were converted to single-seaters. On 9 April 1997, the first of these, &quot;Spirit of America&quot;, was rolled out. During the ceremony, the F-22 was officially named &quot;Raptor&quot;. Due to limited funding, the first flight, which had previously been scheduled for mid-1996, occurred on 7 September 1997. Flight testing for the F-22 continued until 2005, and on 15 December 2005 the USAF announced that the Raptor had reached its initial operational capability (IOC); with the collapse of the Soviet Union and the Department of Defense focused on counterinsurgency at that time, F-22 production only reached 195 aircraft — 187 of them operational models — and ended in 2011.

In many respects, the YF-22s were different from EMD/production F-22s as the design progressed from relatively immature Configuration 632/1132 to the final Configuration 645. Contrary to the F-117 Nighthawk, which was initially difficult to control because of small vertical stabilizers, the YF-22 had its fin area over-specified by Lockheed. Therefore, the company reduced the size of those on F-22s by 20–30 percent. Lockheed and its partners recontoured the shape of the wing and stabilator trailing edges to improve aerodynamics, strength, and stealth characteristics; the wing and stabilitor sweep was reduced by 6° from 48°. The shapes of the radome and fuselage were changed to improve radar performance and aerodynamics. The dedicated airbrake was eliminated in favor of feathering control surfaces using the control laws. The systems arrangement and structural design were refined. Finally, to improve pilot visibility, the canopy was moved forward , and the engine inlets were moved rearward .

==Accidents==
In April 1992, the second YF-22 crashed on the runway while executing a landing go-around demonstration at Edwards AFB. The test pilot, Tom Morgenfeld, escaped without injury. The cause of the crash was found to be a flight control software error that failed to prevent a pilot-induced oscillation while performing a low altitude demonstration flight. The aircraft was superficially repaired but never flew again and was later used as an antenna test model. In light of this mishap, the F-22 flight control laws, the algorithms governing how control inputs translate into aircraft motions and reactions, were altered to better account for non-linear effects of control surface rate/position saturation and PIO triggering mechanisms.

<doc id="844114" wikidata="Q669534" url="?curid=844114" title="Patiala and East Punjab States Union">
<text>The Patiala and East Punjab States Union (PEPSU) was a state of India, uniting eight princely states between 1948 and 1956. The capital and principal city was Patiala. The state covered an area of 26,208 km2. Shimla, Kasauli, Kandaghat and Chail also became part of PEPSU.

== History ==

=== Princely states union ===
It was created by combining eight princely states, which maintained their native rulers :
; Six Salute states :
* Patiala, title Maharaja, Hereditary salute of 17-guns (119-guns local)
* Jind, title Maharaja, Hereditary salute of 13-guns (15-guns personal and local)
* Kapurthala, title Maharaja, Hereditary salute of 13-guns (15-guns personal and local)
* Nabha, title Maharaja, Hereditary salute of 13-guns (15-guns local):
* Faridkot, title Raja, Hereditary salutes of 11-guns
* Malerkotla, title Nawab, Hereditary salute of 11-guns

; and two Non-salute states:
* Kalsia, title Raja (till 1916 Sardar)
* Nalagarh, title Raja.

The state was inaugurated on 15 July 1948 and formally became a state of India in 1950.

=== Successor states ===

On 1 November 1956, PEPSU was merged mostly into Punjab State following the States Reorganisation Act.

A part of the former state of PEPSU, including the present day Jind district and the Narnaul tehsil in north Haryana as well as the Loharu tehsil, Charkhi Dadri district and Mahendragarh district in southwest Haryana, presently lie within the state of Haryana, which was separated from Punjab on 1 November 1966. Some other areas that belonged to PEPSU, notably Solan and Nalagarh, now lie in the state of Himachal Pradesh.

==Rajpramukh and Uparajpramukh==
==Chief Ministers==

===Deputy Chief Minister===
== Institutions ==
=== Heads of state and government ===
When the state was formed, the then-Maharaja of Patiala, Yadavindra Singh, was appointed its Rajpramukh (equivalent to Governor). He remained in office during the entire length of the state&#x27;s short existence. The then Maharaja of Kapurthala, Jagatjit Singh, served as Uparajpramukh (lieutenant-governor).

Gian Singh Rarewala was sworn in on 13 January 1949 as the first Chief Minister of PEPSU. Col. Raghbir Singh became the next Chief Minister on 23 May 1951, and Brish Bhan the Deputy Chief Minister.

The state elected a 60-member state legislative assembly on 6 January 1952. The Congress Party won 26 seats and the Akali Dal won 19 seats.

On 22 April 1952, Gian Singh Rarewala again became Chief Minister, this time an elected one. He led a coalition government, called the &quot;United Front&quot;, formed by the Akali Dal and various independents. On 5 March 1953 his government was dismissed and President&#x27;s rule was imposed on the state. In the mid-term poll that followed, the Congress party secured a majority and Raghbir Singh became Chief Minister on 8 March 1954. Upon his death, Brish Bhan became the Chief Minister on 12 January 1955 and remained in office as last incumbent.

=== Subdivisions ===
Initially, in 1948, the state was divided into the following eight districts:
# Patiala
# Nabha
# Jind
# Faridkot
# Kalsian
# Kapurthala
# Malerkotla
# Nalagarh

In 1953, the number of districts was reduced from eight to five. Barnala district became part of Sangrur district and Kohistan and Fatehgarh districts became part of Patiala district.

There were four Lok Sabha constituencies in this state. Three of them were single-seat constituency: Mohindergarh, Sangrur and Patiala. The Kapurthala-Bhatinda Lok Sabha constituency was a double-seat constituency.

== Demography ==
The state had a population of 3,493,685 (1951 census), of which 19% was urban. The population density was 133/km2.

<text>A mansǫngr (literally &#x27;maiden-song&#x27;; plural &quot;mansǫngvar&quot;; modern Icelandic &quot;mansöngur&quot;, plural &quot;mansöngvar&quot;) is a form of Norse poetry. In scholarly usage the term has often been applied to medieval skaldic love-poetry; and it is used of lyric openings to &quot;rímur&quot; throughout the Icelandic literary tradition.

==In high-medieval Iceland==
Skaldic love-poetry and erotic poems in Old Norse-Icelandic are often characterised in modern scholarship as &quot;mansöngvar&quot;. However, Edith Marold and Bjarni Einarsson have argued that the term &quot;mansöngr&quot; has been over-used in medieval scholarship, being applied to love-poems which we have no evidence were actually viewed as &quot;mansöngvar&quot;. Many medieval references to &quot;mansöngvar&quot; are not accompanied by the poem in question, and the boundaries of the genre are thus disputed. The Icelandic Homily Book (from c. 1200) mentions &quot;mansöngr&quot; in connection with the music of David and Solomon.

=== In Icelandic sagas ===
In &quot;Egils saga&quot;, the poet Egill Skallagrímsson recites a poem about a woman to his friend Arinbjörn. Arinbjörn asks Egill for whom he has composed this &quot;mansöngr&quot; and Egill recites another poem before revealing that the subject of both is Arinbjörn&#x27;s kinswoman Ásgerðr, the widow of Egill&#x27;s brother Þórólfr (Thorolf). Egill requests Arinbjörn&#x27;s help in arranging his marriage with Ásgerðr, and the &quot;mansöngvar&quot; are thus a prelude to an open declaration of love and a marriage petition.

Hallfreðr vandræðaskáld&#x27;s poems to Kolfinna Ávaldadóttir are also described as &quot;mansöngvar&quot; in &quot;Hallfreðar saga&quot;, but the saga depicts Hallfreðr as resisting attempts to organise Kolfinna&#x27;s marriage to both himself and other men. The saga portrays Hallfreðr&#x27;s erotic poetry about Kolfinna and his libellous verses on Kolfinna&#x27;s husband, Grís, as destructive in nature—objectifying Kolfinna while inciting her family to violence. Only through his relationship with his King Ólafr Tryggvason (his eventual godfather) and his spiritual poems does Hallfreðr find redemption and maturity and eventually express regret for the sorrow he has caused Kolfinna.

One of the oldest saga manuscripts to preserve a reference to the genre is DG 8 from c. 1225–1250 in the hagiographical saga &quot;Óláfs saga helga&quot;. According to the saga, the Icelandic skald Óttarr svarti composed a &quot;mansǫngsdrápa&quot; about Queen Ástríðr of Norway when they were both in the court of her father, the King of Sweden. This drápa provoked the wrath of her husband, King Ólafr Helgason, but when Óttarr travelled to Norway he prudently enlisted the help of his uncle and skald Sigvatr Þórðarson to gain an audience with the Norwegian king and redeem himself with the poem &quot;Hǫfuðlausn&quot;, which praises the merits of King Ólafr rather than the beauty of his wife.

=== In Icelandic law ===
The composing of &quot;mansöngvar&quot; for or about women is explicitly prohibited by the medieval Icelandic law-code &quot;Grágás&quot;, &#x27;in the younger additions to &quot;Konungsbók&quot; (GKS 1157 fol) and &quot;Staðarhólsbók&quot; (AM 334 fol), where it is inserted into a passage bearing the title &#x27;vm scaldscap&#x27; (&#x27;on poetry&#x27;), an exhaustive treatment of the different kinds of poetry and the various punishments for them&#x27;. But there is no clear explanation of what a &quot;mansöngr&quot; is. In the Konungsbók version, §238, the text reads

Ef maðr yrkir mansöng vm cono oc varðar scog gang. Kona a söc ef hon er xx. eða ellre. ef hon vill eigi søkia láta. oc a lavg raðande hennar sökena.

If a man composes &quot;mansǫngr&quot; about a woman he suffers full outlawry. The woman has to bring the case if she is twenty or older. If she will not have it prosecuted, then her legal administrator has to bring the case.

== In &quot;rímur&quot;==
In Icelandic &quot;rímur&quot;, &quot;mansöngur&quot; is the term used for the (optional) opening section of each &quot;ríma&quot; poem within the larger epic. The &quot;mansöngur&quot; typically shares a metre with the &quot;ríma&quot; it prefaces but is lyric poetry rather than narrative and the poet often speaks in the first person, addressing the audience directly. The &quot;mansöngur&quot; is often addressed to a woman but known as &quot;mansöngr&quot; even when it isn&#x27;t. The &quot;mansöngur&quot; may or may not relate to the main narrative of the &quot;rímur&quot;: some poets use the &quot;mansöngur&quot; to comment on the events of the story as they unfold or explore specific narrative themes, but others treat the &quot;mansöngur&quot; as a &#x27;break from the action&#x27;.

The earliest &quot;rímur&quot; lack &quot;mansöngvar&quot;. In later &quot;rímur&quot;, the author (usually male) would compose poetry about a woman he had fallen in love with (but who generally is not depicted as reciprocating his feelings). Accordingly, &quot;mansöngvar&quot; are often sorrowful. Later, they started to feature other topics, such as love for one&#x27;s ancestral estate or complaints at how few people appreciate poetry.

One example of the content of a &quot;mansöngur&quot; is afforded by Craigie&#x27;s summary of stanzas 1-17 of the third &quot;ríma&quot; of &quot;Skotlands rímur&quot; by Einar Guðmundsson, a 17th-century poet. It includes many of the classical features of the &quot;mansöngur&quot; in &quot;rímur&quot;: a fair woman is addressed, while the poet laments his inadequacy as a poet and the sorrowful state of the world. The &quot;mansöngur&quot; is also a platform for personal expression—here, probably, a (veiled) complaint over losing his position as the minister for Staður in Reykjanes in 1635 after accusing two parishioners of sorcery:

Though the ring-decked maiden might wish for a love-song, I have but little poetry from Odin. Only a little scent of the fruit of song he gave me once: I have no need to be grateful for his generosity. Let those rejoice who have been more successful. Friendship is not shown to every man, and I was never good at winning favour of the great. True friendship is rare over all the land; most men look for some advantage and are envious of all others who get wealth or fame. Seek not, then, to be praised by the world: disgrace and loss may follow. He that sees in secret will reward you, and He will come one day to sit in judgement. May I be able to see Him with joy, though my works are not so good as they might be. I have not the &quot;mansöngs&quot; to speak about the fair maid, but I must try to give her the third ballad now!

==In Norway==
Among the medieval inscriptions found at Bryggen in the Norwegian city of Bergen, there are preserved examples of &quot;mansǫngskvæði&quot; (mansǫngr poems) written in Skaldic meters such as dróttkvætt. In particular, N B145 dates to the first half of the thirteenth century and contains a full dróttkvætt stanza, the first half of which translates thusly:
: &quot;The ancient breeze of the cliff-goddesses [GIANTESSES &gt; DESIRE] fell to me early with respect to the beautiful, dangerous young pine-tree of the fastened fire of the fish expanse [SEA &gt; GOLD &gt; (beautiful, dangerous, young) WOMAN].&quot;
Simplified, this means:
: &quot;Desire for the beautiful, dangerous young woman overcame me a long time ago.&quot;

<text>More FM is a New Zealand radio network that plays hot adult contemporary music. It is operated by MediaWorks New Zealand.

More FM broadcasts in 25 centres throughout New Zealand on 81 transmitters with a mix of local and network programming. The station targets a 25 to 49-year-old audience and has the most local shows of any radio network in New Zealand. Currently there are 11 different breakfast shows and 14 day shows.

The More FM network has grown from a local Wellington station to a large Network brand developed through expansion, acquisitions and re-branding of local stations already owned by MediaWorks.

More FM had the 3rd or 4th largest audience of New Zealand&#x27;s commercial radio stations in 2021.

==History==

===Early years===
&quot;More FM&quot;, with the on air position of &quot;Not to Heavy, Not too Soft&quot;, first began in Wellington on 6 May 1991 as a local radio station. The very first station was started by Doug Gold and Craig Thompson; previously Doug Gold was the managing director of Wellington radio station Radio Windy. Gold and Thompson were joined by fellow investors Chris Muirhead, Simon &quot;Swampy&quot; Marsh, Lyn Chung and Bill Mathieson.The very first song to play on the first More FM station by Breakfast Show hosts Simon &quot;Swampy&quot; Marsh and Anemarie Gold was Rhythm of My Heart by Rod Stewart. In the early nineties More FM began broadcasting in Christchurch and Auckland, both as local stations separate from the Wellington station.

===Change of ownership===
In the late nineties More FM&#x27;s parent company The More FM Group was sold to CanWest Mediaworks who at the time were the owners of TV3 New Zealand; the sale also included The Breeze in Wellington and Channel Z. Programming was extended to Dunedin in 1997 as a local station but networked from Christchurch during breakfast and evenings. A fifth More FM station was started in the Waikato in 1999 as a totally local station.

In 2000 CanWest Mediaworks purchased RadioWorks which at that stage was operating 4 network brands across New Zealand and a local station in most markets across New Zealand. RadioWorks later became known as MediaWorks.

===Expansion to other regions===
In December 2004 MediaWorks nationalised and networked all of their local stations previously marketed as LocalWorks stations. Regions with just one local station had their station rebranded as More FM, regions with more than one local station typically had the station considered to be the flagship station in that area rebranded as More FM and secondary stations rebranded as The Breeze. Some markets had secondary local stations replaced with a network station run by MediaWorks. The changes saw More FM extended to more than 15 markets with all stations initially retaining their local announcers up to 7 pm. The number of stations was later expanded to 24 after further station re-branding as well as MediaWorks purchasing other independent stations.

===Introduction of network programming===

====Network night show====
Network programming on More FM began with the Evening and overnight shows in January 2005. The &#x27;More FM Most Wanted&#x27; Night show was originally hosted by Dominic Bowden until the middle of 2005 and then by Tarsha Tolson until the middle of 2007 when Tarsha moved to Wellington to co-host the More FM breakfast show. The overnight show was originally hosted by Asher Bastion until he left to go to Life FM in June 2006. From 2015, the show was hosted by Joe Cotton. Tyler McDonald hosted the show between 2022-2023.

====Network drive and daytime shows====
In August 2009 the first Network Drive show was created. The Wellington weekday Drive show team, &#x27;Josh &amp; Tom&#x27; Josh van Berkel and Tom McKenzie (ex-Classic Hits South Canterbury) were re-located to Auckland and their show was networked into 19 of the 22 More FM markets over the following months.

In March 2011 Josh &amp; Tom announced they were leaving More FM. The structure of the day was reworked ending the traditional Breakfast/Day/Drive line up. From 4 April 2011 the More FM stations were local in all markets with the network programming starting at 1 pm, an hour earlier. The afternoon lineup consisted of a 1 pm – 4 pm Afternoon show hosted by former More FM Waikato breakfast host Stu Tolan and a 4 – 7 pm Drive show hosted by media personality Clarke Gayford. Christchurch, Manawatū and Nelson were the exceptions to the change in format as these stations continued to broadcast locally up to 7 pm until 2015.

Networked programming during the daytime began in 2013 with the introduction of a show presented by Geoff Stagg from Wellington and networked to selected regions.

In 2015 More FM reverted to the traditional Breakfast/Day/Drive line up and local programming was extended in some markets to run between 6 am – 3 pm or 10 am – 3 pm for those markets taking the networked breakfast show. From 2014, Jason Gunn and Lana Searle hosted the 3 pm – 7 pm show, before Lana was replaced by Jay-Jay Feeney in 2018. Paul &#x27;Flynny&#x27; Flynn joined the show in 2019, as Jason Gunn moved to co-host the show part-time. Jay-Jay Feeney decided to leave radio in July 2024, and since then, the drive show is hosted by Sarah Gandy and Flynny, along with producers Matthew &quot;Pledge&quot; Pledger and Dave Rybinski.

====Network breakfast====
In 2007, the More FM Christchurch breakfast show, then presented by Si and Gary, was networked into the Nelson region.
In October 2011, More FM Auckland breakfast presenter Jeremy Corbett resigned from his long-standing breakfast show. Marc Ellis was announced as his replacement along with Amber Peebles &amp; Stu Tolan. In November 2011 an announcement was made that new Auckland based breakfast show would be networked into the Waikato and Wellington region. The &#x27;local&#x27; daytime host read out local news and weather in their respective region as part of the networked breakfast show from 6 – 10 am. In December 2012 Amber Peebles left the show to pursue a television project. Her replacement was Hayley Holt. Marc Ellis left the show in October 2013. Stu and Hayley continued to present the network breakfast for the remainder of 2013, along with Joe Cotton.

In 2014 the Christchurch breakfast, then presented by Si and Gary, became the new network breakfast show and continued to be presented from Christchurch. In April 2015 the networked breakfast was extended to Dunedin and Hawkes Bay with the local presenters in those markets moved to the local The Breeze station in their respective markets. The show is now presented by Lana Searle and Adam Percival with Simon Barnett returning in 2025 after a 5-year hiatus.

In July 2017, Pauline (Polly) Gillespie and Grant Kereama launched a Wellington-based breakfast show, which also airs in Kapiti/Horowhenua. In January 2018 this show was networked into five other markets, but in early 2020 the show reverted to a local Wellington breakfast show until June 2020.

====Weekend programming====
Originally weekend programming on all More FM stations remained local after the expansion and rebranding in 2005 including during Saturday and Sunday evenings and overnight. A networked evening show for weekends was introduced in late 2005. More FM began replacing local programming at the weekends with networked programming from 2007 onwards initially networking stations after 2 pm. From 2014 all More FM stations were local on Saturday morning from 6 am to 10 am, with Auckland and Christchurch local to 7 pm.

==The More FM network==

===Defunct More FM stations===

Hawke&#x27;s Bay&#x27;s 92 More FM was New Zealand&#x27;s first franchised More FM radio station and began transmission from its Napier studios in 1994 and continued until the mid to late 1990s when the More FM name was dropped to become &#x27;Hawke&#x27;s Bay&#x27;s 92FM&#x27;. The station broadcast on 91.9 MHz from studios in Hastings Street and featured Peter Mac (McIlwaine) and Nicki Sunderland on breakfast. Other announcers included Kyllee Higgins (now Kyllee King-Turner), Scotty Mac, Nik Menzies, Cath White, James Milner, Grant Magrath (pre-recorded mid-dawns) Kev Stanton and Greg Wattam. The station&#x27;s slogan was &#x27;More Music, More Variety&#x27; which was in line with the other More FM stations around the country at that time. The station was operated as a franchise by Radio Otago. In 1996, 92 More FM was relocated to Hastings where it joined fellow Radio Otago station Hot 93 in the BNZ Building. Live content was reduced around this time with the night show being fully automated. In 1997 Radio Otago sold their 7 North Island stations to Energy Enterprises, at this point the More FM branding was dropped and later the station was replaced with network station Solid Gold FM. Solid Gold has since been rebranded as The Sound.

Kapiti&#x27;s 99.6 More FM began transmission across the Kāpiti Coast and Horowhenua regions around 1994 and remained on air until 2004 when it was replaced by The Breeze. The station&#x27;s programming was generated from More FM in Wellington, although it ran an entirely separate programme to the Wellington station outside of breakfast. Voicebreaks were recorded in advance by the announcer in the Wellington studio. Localised weather forecasts, station IDs and jingles also helped create a local sound. 99.6 More FM played a slightly different music mix to the Wellington station where its programming originated from, although they both shared the &#x27;More Music, More Variety&#x27; and later &#x27;Today&#x27;s Best Music Mix&#x27; slogans.

Dunedin&#x27;s 98 More FM began broadcasting in Dunedin around 1997. The breakfast show, originally presented by Simon Barnett and Phil Gifford was a simulcast from Christchurch&#x27;s 92 More FM. Other shows were a mixture of locally produced shows and shows prerecorded also from More FM in Christchurch. 98 More FM was replaced with a simulcast of The Breeze Christchurch when local station 4XO was rebranded as 97.4 More FM.

<text>David Smith Terry (March 8, 1823 – August 14, 1889) was an American politician and jurist who served as the fourth chief justice of the Supreme Court of California; he was an author of the state&#x27;s 1879 Constitution. 

Terry killed U.S. Senator David C. Broderick in a duel in 1859. On August 14, 1889, Terry attacked Associate Supreme Court Justice Stephen J. Field and was shot and killed by Deputy U.S. Marshal David Neagle.

==Early life==
Terry was born in Todd County, Kentucky. In 1831, his family moved and settled in Brazoria County, Texas. He studied law in the office of his uncle, T. J. B. Hadley, and was admitted to the bar in Galveston in 1845. During the Mexican–American War, Terry served in Captain Samuel L. S. Ballowe&#x27;s company of Colonel John Coffee Hays&#x27;s First Regiment of Texas Mounted Rifle Volunteers and participated in the Battle of Monterrey. In 1847, he lost the election for district attorney of Galveston, and in 1849 he joined the gold rush to California, where he attained success with his law practice in Stockton and became active in politics as a Democrat.

==Widow Sanchez case==

In 1855, he took up the cause of the &quot;Widow Sanchez&quot;. Maria Encarnacion Ortega de Sanchez, the widow of a wealthy rancher, was being cheated by local authorities, including the Sheriff, William Roach, who took her fortune under the guise of guardianship. After kidnapping Roach with the help of a local gunslinger named Anastacio Garcia, they held Roach in a jail cell in Stockton until he agreed to release the widow&#x27;s gold. But Roach had bribed a guard to ride to Monterey and urge Roach&#x27;s family to hide the gold. The treasure was hidden somewhere in Carmel Valley by Roach&#x27;s brother-in-law, Jerry MacMahon. MacMahon was killed in a barroom brawl before he could reveal the location of the money.

== Public office ==

In August 1855, he was nominated by the American Party (Know Nothings), in the special election for the Supreme Court of California seat left vacant by the death of Alexander Wells. He won the election and served from November 15, 1855, to September 12, 1859, as a State Supreme Court Justice; from September 18, 1857, to the end of his term, he was the 4th Chief Justice of California.

In 1856, the San Francisco Committee of Vigilance challenged the corrupt city government controlled by David C. Broderick. Hundreds of armed &quot;Vigilantes&quot; seized two notorious murderers from the city jail and hanged them. The State of California, sympathetic to Broderick, declared San Francisco to be in a state of insurrection. Judge Terry, a Broderick ally, traveled from Sacramento to San Francisco for negotiations between the Vigilance Committee and Broderick&#x27;s henchmen. He was seized by Vigilance Committee gunmen. Terry was a big man, known for his physical strength and for his skill with the Bowie knife he routinely carried in a sheath under his coat. He stabbed Vigilante Sterling A. Hopkins, who survived. Terry was tried and convicted by the Vigilance Committee, but released, &quot;the usual punishments in their power to inflict, not being applicable, in the present instance.&quot;
On January 8, 1858, Chief Justice Terry administered the oath of office at the inauguration of Governor John B. Weller.

== Killing of U.S. Senator David Broderick ==

On June 25, 1859, the California Democratic Party state convention nominated Warner Cope for Supreme Court over Terry. Although Terry was a close friend of Democratic U.S. Senator from California David Broderick, Terry accused Broderick, a Free Soil advocate, of having engineered Terry&#x27;s loss for nomination for re-election in the 1859 state elections.

Terry made inflammatory comments at a state convention in Sacramento, which offended Broderick.

On September 13, 1859, Terry and Broderick, having agreed to a duel, met just outside San Francisco city limits. Terry won the coin toss to select weapons and chose pistols. Broderick&#x27;s discharged early, leaving him open for Terry&#x27;s shot. At first Terry thought that he had only wounded Broderick, but the senator died three days later. The day before the duel, Terry had resigned as Chief Justice.

In June 1860, Terry was acquitted of murder. In November 1862, he campaigned for the Breckenridge Democratic Party. But by March 1863 he left the state for Texas. He fought during the American Civil War, serving in the 8th Texas Cavalry Regiment of the Confederate States Army. The unit was raised by his brother Benjamin Franklin Terry and was also known as &quot;Terry&#x27;s Texas Rangers&quot;. Terry later became Colonel of the 37th Texas Cavalry Regiment and was wounded at the Battle of Chickamauga. In November 1865, after the war was over, he moved to a ranch at Guadalajara, near Mazatlan, Mexico.

In 1869, Terry came back to Nevada, and by 1870 returned to Stockton and engaged in private practice. From March 1878 to March 1879, he was a delegate from San Joaquin County, California, to the state Constitutional Convention. Terry was chair of the Committee on Legislative Department, and his proposed language on bank directors&#x27; liability to depositors was adopted.

In August 1879, the Democratic Party nominated Terry for California Attorney General. The nomination triggered criticism of his record of dueling with Broderick and fighting for the Confederacy. Terry lost the election to Republican Augustus L. Hart.

==Marriage to Althea Hill==

In the 1880s, Terry became entangled in a volatile public scandal. Thirty year old Sarah Althea Hill had been the mistress of 60 year old silver millionaire and former U.S. Senator William Sharon. When he ended the relationship and took up with another woman, she sued for divorce, claiming adultery.

Sharon countersued, claiming that the marriage contract she provided was a forgery, and that they had never married. Hill wanted a share of Sharon&#x27;s wealth. The court ruled that the marriage contract was a forgery. Terry appealed the ruling to the United States Supreme Court. After Sharon died on November 13, 1885, Althea married Terry on January 7, 1886, in Stockton. She produced a will that she said she found in Sharon&#x27;s desk which gave her all of his assets. United States Supreme Court Justice Stephen J. Field, a former friend of Broderick&#x27;s, heard the case in 1888 as the senior justice of the Federal circuit court in California. 

On September 3, 1888, Field delivered the final Circuit Court opinion. He ruled that the will was a forgery. Sarah Althea Hill suddenly stood up, screamed obscenities at the judge, and fumbled in her handbag for her revolver. When Marshal John Franks and others attempted to escort her from the courtroom, attorney Terry rose to defend his wife and drew his Bowie knife. He hit Franks, knocking out a tooth, and the marshals drew their handguns. Spectators subdued Terry and led him out of the courtroom, where he pulled his Bowie knife and threatened all around him. David Neagle was among the Marshals present and put his pistol in Terry&#x27;s face. Both Terrys were subdued and placed under arrest. Justice Field had them returned to the courtroom and sentenced both to jail for contempt of court. David Terry got six months in jail, and Sarah Terry got one month.

While being transported to jail and while serving their sentences, Terry and his wife repeatedly threatened Judge Field. The Terrys suffered several more setbacks. Both David and Althea were indicted by a federal grand jury on criminal charges arising out of their behavior in the courtroom before Justice Field. In May 1889, the U.S. Supreme Court refused to review the order that invalidated Althea Terry&#x27;s marriage contract with Senator Sharon. Then, in July, with only one of the four judges who had earlier ruled in their favor, the California Supreme Court reversed itself. It ruled that because Althea Terry and Sharon had kept their alleged marriage a secret, they were never legally married. While in jail or shortly afterward, pregnant Althea suffered a miscarriage.

==Attack on judge and death==

A year later, on August 14, 1889, David Terry and Field were on the same train headed to San Francisco when it stopped at the train station in Lathrop for breakfast. Terry slapped Field in the face. Field&#x27;s bodyguard, Deputy United States Marshal David B. Neagle, fearing that Terry was reaching for the Bowie knife he was known to carry in his breast pocket, shot and killed Terry. Neagle was arrested by San Joaquin County Sheriff Tom Cunningham on a charge of murder. The United States attorney general secured the release of Neagle on a writ of habeas corpus. The issue was resolved by &quot;In re Neagle&quot;, 135 U.S. 1 (1890), a United States Supreme Court decision that determined that the United States Attorney General had authority to appoint U.S. Marshals as bodyguards. 

Terry is buried at Stockton Rural Cemetery in Stockton.

=== Wife declared insane===

The widow Sarah Terry gradually went insane. She wandered the streets of San Francisco aimlessly, ignoring her appearance. She constantly talked to &quot;spirits,&quot; especially that of her husband. She was diagnosed with dementia praecox, an early term for schizophrenia. On March 2, 1892, she was found insane and committed at age 41 to the California Asylum at Stockton, where she lived for 45 years until her death. She is buried in the same grave as her husband. Terry&#x27;s first wife, Cornelia Runnels, who died in December 1884, is also buried next to him.

== In popular media==
In the 1952 novel, &quot;Incident at Sun Mountain,&quot; by Todhunter Ballard, Judge Terry is the leader of a chapter of the Knights of the Golden Circle operating in Virginia City and Carson City, Nevada, on the eve of the Civil War.

In 1963, Brad Dexter was cast as Justice Terry, with Carroll O&#x27;Connor as Senator Broderick, in &quot;A Gun Is Not a Gentleman&quot; on the syndicated television anthology series, &quot;Death Valley Days&quot;, hosted by Stanley Andrews. Though past allies as Democrats, Terry, a defender of slavery, challenged the anti-slavery Broderick to a duel.

<text>Bella Rebecca Lewitzky (January 13, 1916 – July 16, 2004) was an American modern dance choreographer, dancer and teacher. 

Lewitzky was a lifelong advocate for artistic freedom in dance, and continuously pursued political and artistic objectives in her works. Throughout her over 70-year career, Lewitzky asserted her independence as an artist and a teacher, repeatedly confronting major institutions and the federal government in the process. 

Lewitzky&#x27;s unique technique emphasized seriousness and stability, extending to both the movements performed by her dancers and the approach she took to operating her company. 

==Early life and education==
Bella Rebecca Lewitzky was born on January 13, 1916, in Llano del Rio, California, a short-lived utopian community in the Antelope Valley led by Socialists. Her parents, Joseph Lewitzky and Nina (Ossman) Lewitzky, were Russian Jewish immigrants, who joined Llano del Rio for the artistic and political benefits it provided. Llano del Rio disbanded in 1918, and the family moved back to Los Angeles, the birthplace of Bella&#x27;s older sister Sarah.

In Los Angeles, the Lewitzky family struggled, and the family moved to San Bernardino when Bella was six. San Bernardino did not offer the artistic opportunities of either Llano del Rio or Los Angeles, but it was where Joseph could sustain the family. Lewitzky&#x27;s childhood, marked by serious commitments to the arts, politics, and education, would inform her works throughout her career.

Lewitzky moved back to Los Angeles in her teens, briefly studying ballet with a former member of the Ballets Russes, before joining the Lester Horton company in 1934. As a student, and later an integral collaborator, of the Horton company, Lewitzky was closely involved in the development of the Horton technique. Fred Strickler, an accomplished dancer and educator who studied under Lewitzky, argued that &quot;[Horton] built his technique, which is now known as the Horton technique, on her body. Specifically. On &quot;her&quot; body.&quot;

== Career ==
In 1946, Lewitzky was a co-founder of a unique organization in Los Angeles, the Dance Theater. The Dance Theater was one of the few institutions in the United States to house both a dance school and theater under the same roof, and was known for its progressive politics and insistence on racial integration. Lewitzky parted ways with Horton and the Dance Theater in 1950, after disagreements with Horton over technique and administration. In parting with Horton, Lewitzky had codified her own technique.

Lewitzky appeared as a specialty dancer in the 1943 Technicolor adventure film &quot;White Savage&quot;, and she choreographed the films &quot;Bagdad&quot; (1949) (with Lester Horton), &quot;Tripoli&quot; (1950), and &quot;Prehistoric Women&quot; (1950).

Lewitzky was summoned to appear before the House Un-American Activities Committee in 1951, accused of being a Communist. She refused to answer many of the committee&#x27;s questions on constitutional grounds, as advised by her lawyers. Following the hearing, Lewitzky famously told the news media &quot;I am a dancer, not a singer,&quot; poetically refusing to &quot;sing&quot; names to the committee. For this action, Lewitzky was blacklisted, preventing her from securing roles on the stage or screen. Her studio was relatively unaffected, despite the presence of numerous threatening letters and phone calls.

In 1955, Lewitzky gave birth to her only child, her daughter Nora. The same year, she moved her rehearsals to Idyllwild, California, in the San Jacinto Mountains outside of Los Angeles. In 1956, Lewitzky became the founding chair of the dance department at the Idyllwild School of Music and the Arts, continuing her affiliation until 1972. Her daughter, Nora, joined the dance faculty in 2003 and continues teaching Lewitzky technique. The Idyllwild Arts Academy is one of the few dance programs in the United States that offers &quot;Lewitzky Technique&quot; as part of their curriculum.

In 1966, she founded the Lewitzky Dance Company. Under her artistic guidance, the company became one of the leading international modern dance companies, performing to critical acclaim in forty-three states across the U.S. as well as twenty countries on five continents. Among her dance associates was the former television child actress Noreen Corcoran of &quot;Bachelor Father&quot;.

Lewitzky was the founder of the dance program at California Institute of the Arts (CalArts) in the late 1960s and early 1970s. In accepting the appointment, she saw an opportunity to differentiate the program from other academic dance programs, which she distrusted and generally did not interact with. Lewitzky&#x27;s goal for the program was to &quot;train dancers for every need they might have,&quot; including publicity and stage lighting. Despite her commitment to the purpose of CalArts, Lewitzky disliked being an administrator, and she resigned in early 1972.

A major component of Lewitzky&#x27;s legacy was to be the Dance Gallery, a new facility in California Plaza that would integrate studios and a 1000-seat theater. Plans for the Dance Gallery were in progress by 1978, but the project stalled, and was still unbuilt a decade later. The Colburn School took over the project in 1992, committing to constructing a building and amicably parting ways with Lewitzky and her company.

Following her activism against HUAC in the 1950s, Lewitzky continued to advocate for artistic freedom. In 1990, Lewitzky&#x27;s company was awarded a $72,000 grant from the National Endowment for the Arts, which required that the company not produce obscene works. This anti-obscenity provision was imposed in 1989 on all NEA grants, in an effort led by Senator Jesse Helms. Lewitzky refused to sign the anti-obscenity provision and instead sued the NEA, arguing that the anti-obscenity provision was in violation of the First and Fifth Amendments. The case was decided in Lewitzky&#x27;s favor in early 1991.

The Lewitzky Dance Company disbanded in 1997 after 30 years, with Lewitzky describing the decision to do so as &quot;a political act, there’s no question about it.&quot; Lewitzky criticized the corporate structure and funding models that became necessary for an arts company the size of hers to survive. In closing the company, Lewitzky also condemned her funders, whom she did not name, for ending her hopes of handing off the company to her associates.

==Personal life==
Lewitzky was married to Newell Taylor Reynolds, an architect and set designer. Lewitzky and Reynolds met while they were dancers in the Lester Horton company, and married in 1940. Reynolds designed sets for the Lewitzky Dance Company, among other collaborations. Their wedding reception was held at the Samuel Freeman House, which they frequented as part of an avant garde salon.

Lewitzky and Reynolds had one daughter, Nora Reynolds, born in 1960. 

== Death and legacy ==
Lewitzky died in Pasadena, California, on July 16, 2004, of complications following a stroke. 

Lewitzky&#x27;s technique and works are celebrated as part of the distinctive tradition of modern dance in California. Her life and works are the subject of the 2022 documentary film &quot;Bella&quot;, directed by Bridget Murnane.

The records of the Bella Lewitzky Dance Company are held at the University of Southern California Music Library.

==Awards and honors==
Lewitzky received many awards including honorary doctorates from California Institute of Arts (1981), Occidental College (1984), Otis Parsons College (1989), and the Juilliard School (1993). She was awarded a Guggenheim Fellowship in 1977. In 1991 she was a recipient of the Heritage Award from the National Dance Association. In 1996, she was awarded the National Medal of Arts.

<text>Guccio Gucci S.p.A., doing business as Gucci ( , ), is an Italian luxury fashion house based in Florence, Italy. Its product lines include handbags, ready-to-wear, footwear, accessories, and home decoration; and it licenses its name and branding to Coty for fragrance and cosmetics under the name Gucci Beauty.

Gucci was founded in 1921 by Guccio Gucci (1881–1953) in Florence, Tuscany. Under the direction of Aldo Gucci (son of Guccio), Gucci became a worldwide-known brand, an icon of the Italian &quot;dolce vita&quot; period. Following family feuds during the 1980s, the Gucci family was entirely ousted from the capital of the company by 1993. After this crisis, the brand was revived and in 1999 Gucci became a subsidiary of the French conglomerate PPR, which later renamed itself to Kering.

In 2023, Gucci operated 538 stores with 20,711 employees, and generated €9.9 billion in sales. Stefano Cantino has been CEO of Gucci since October 2024. 

==History==
=== 1921 birth in Florence ===
The Gucci family claims its origins are rooted in the merchant city of Florence since around 1410. Guccio Giovanbattista Giacinto Dario Maria Gucci (1881–1953) left Florence for Paris, and settled in London in 1897 to work at the high-end Savoy Hotel. While working as a bellhop there, he would load/unload the luggage of the hotel&#x27;s wealthy clients, learning about their tastes in fashion, quality, fabrics, and traveling conditions. He later worked four years for the Compagnie des Wagons-Lits, the European rail company that specialized in upscale travel leisure, thus further enhancing his experience with luxurious traveling lifestyles. After World War I, he worked for the maker of fine luggage Franzi.

In 1921, Guccio Gucci bought his own shop on Via della Vigna Nuova in Florence, &quot;Azienda Individuale Guccio Gucci&quot;, where he sold imported leather luggage. He also opened a small workshop to have his own leather goods made by local craftsmen. Eventually, a larger workshop had to be acquired to house Gucci&#x27;s sixty artisans. In 1935, the invasion of Ethiopia by Mussolini led the League of Nations to impose a trade embargo on Italy. Leather became scarce, pushing Guccio Gucci to introduce other fabrics in the composition of the products, such as raffia, wicker, wood, linen and jute. The rombi motif, a Gucci signature, was created. The Guccis developed a new tanning technique to produce &quot;cuoio grasso&quot;, which became a Gucci trademark. In 1937, Gucci launched its handbags.

Guccio&#x27;s wife and children all worked in the shop. Aldo, the son of Guccio, became increasingly involved in the family company since he started working there in 1925. He convinced his father to grow by opening a new shop in Rome (21 Via Condotti) in 1938, and launched more Gucci accessories (gloves, belts, wallets, keychains). During World War II, the artisans of Gucci worked on making boots for the Italian infantry.

The company made handbags of cotton canvas rather than leather during World War II as a result of material shortages. The canvas, however, was distinguished by a signature double-G symbol combined with prominent red and green bands. After the war, the Gucci crest, which showed a shield and armored knight surrounded by a ribbon inscribed with the family name, became synonymous with the city of Florence.

=== Post-war &quot;Dolce Vita&quot; ===
After the war, Guccio Gucci distributed the shares of the company to his three sons (Aldo, Vasco and Rodolfo). In 1947, Gucci launched the Bamboo bag. The bag created using lightweight bamboo for handles was a response to continued post-war material scarcity. The brand launched its first global tagline, &quot;Quality is remembered long after price is forgotten&quot;. The iconic moccasins (Gucci loafer) were launched in 1952. Guccio Gucci died on 2 January 1953 in Milan. In November 1953, Gucci opened its first US store on 5th Avenue and 58th Street in New York. A second NY shop opened in the Saint Regis Hotel in 1960, and a third on 5th Avenue and 54th Street in 1973, leading the locals to call this NY area &quot;Gucci City&quot;.

In 1961, Gucci opened stores in London and Palm Beach, and launched the Jackie Bag. In March 1963, Gucci opened its first French store near Place Vendôme in Paris. The double-G logo for belt buckles and other accessory decorations was introduced in 1964. The Flora scarf was designed in 1966 by Rodolfo Gucci and Vittorio Accornero for Grace Kelly, Princess of Monaco, who became a notable consumer of Gucci products. In October 1968, Gucci opened a store at 347 Rodeo Drive, driving many Hollywood stars to endorse the brand. With the Rodeo Drive opening came the launch of Gucci&#x27;s first dresses. Gucci&#x27;s breakthrough in the United States led to its global development in Asia (Tokyo opening in 1972, Hong Kong in 1974) and the Middle East. In Brussels, Aldo&#x27;s son Roberto piloted the first Gucci franchised store. By 1969, Gucci was managing ten shops in the United States. 84,000 Gucci moccasins were sold in the US alone that year. US President John F. Kennedy called Aldo Gucci the &quot;first Italian ambassador to the United States&quot;.

Gucci launched a Rolls-Royce luggage set in 1970 and partnered with American Motors Corporation (AMC) to create the Gucci version of the AMC Hornet that was marketed during the 1971, 1972, and 1973 model years. The Gucci Sportabout wagon became one of the first American cars to offer a special luxury trim package created by a famous fashion designer. Gucci launched Gucci Perfumes (Il Mio Profumo) and its first watch (Model 2000) in 1972, its first franchised store in the US in 1973, and opened the Gucci Galleria in its Beverly Hills store in 1977, a private art gallery adjoined to the store and reserved to premium clients who were given a golden key to access it. From 1978 to 1984 a Miami-based coachbuilder marketed a Gucci edition of the Cadillac Seville sedan (the 1978 model is exhibited at the Gucci Museum).

In 1985, the Gucci loafer became part of the permanent collection of the New York Moma.

=== 1980s Gucci&#x27;s family feud ===

In 1969, Giorgio, the son of Aldo, had sparked the first family feud by launching &quot;Gucci Boutique&quot; on his own, which was finally reabsorbed by the family group in 1972. During the 1980s, the Gucci saga eroded the family-held top management of the company and fed the press headlines. Paolo Gucci, son of Aldo, tried to launch the brand &quot;Gucci Plus&quot; on his own. Aldo was criticized for developing most of the international business under Gucci America, which he owned. In 1982, to ease tensions in the family, the Gucci group was consolidated and became a publicly traded company, Guccio Gucci SpA. In May 1983, Rodolfo died. His son Maurizio Gucci inherited his father&#x27;s majority stake in the company and launched a legal war against his uncle Aldo for full control of Gucci (a prosecution led by the city prosecutor Rudolph Giuliani, and with Domenico de Sole representing the Gucci family). Maurizio Gucci took over the company&#x27;s direction. In 1986, Aldo Gucci, 81, with only 16.7% of Gucci left in his possession, was sentenced to a year in prison for tax evasion (in a prison where Albert Nipon was also an inmate). The artwork of the Gucci Galleria was liquidated. In 1988, Maurizio Gucci sold almost 47.8% of Gucci to the Bahrain-based investment fund Investcorp (owner of Tiffany since 1984), and withheld the other 50%.

Despite the family disputes, between 1981 and 1987, the sales of trademarked Gucci products reached $400 million, and $227 million in 1990 alone. The 1980s were characterized by a mass-production of Gucci products, which generated revenue but negatively affected Gucci&#x27;s position as an exclusive luxury brand. Maurizio Gucci hired Dawn Mello to put Gucci back on tracks.

From 1991 to 1993, Gucci&#x27;s finances were still in the red. Maurizio Gucci was blamed for spending extravagant amounts of money on the company&#x27;s headquarters in Florence (Via delle Caldaie palazzo) and in Milan. Investcorp bought the remaining 50% of Guccio Gucci S.p.A. from Maurizio Gucci in 1993, ending the family involvement in the group. In March 1995, Maurizio Gucci was shot dead in the lobby of Gucci&#x27;s Milan office. His ex-wife Patrizia Reggiani served 16 years in jail for hiring the hitman to murder him.

=== Porno Chic Revival ===

Dawn Mello was hired in November 1989 as Gucci&#x27;s executive vice president and chief designer. She reduced the number of stores from over 1,000 to 180 in a move to rebuild the brand&#x27;s exclusivity. She also reduced the number of items sold by Gucci from 22,000 to 7,000. She revived the Bamboo bag and the Gucci loafer. She moved Gucci&#x27;s headquarters back from Milan to Florence, where the history of Gucci is deeply rooted.

Dawn Mello hired Tom Ford to oversee the women&#x27;s ready-to-wear collection. In 1994, Tom Ford was named creative director of Gucci. Ford and Mello revisited the 1970s archives of the brand. Ford&#x27;s 1995 collection, which included the sensual white dresses with provocative cut-outs, became an instant hit. Revived through the &quot;hot-bod&quot; hedonism of Tom Ford&#x27;s creations, Gucci also launched provocative products in limited edition such as silver handcuffs, a G-string and provocative ad campaigns such as the G logo shaved on pubic hair.

Domenico De Sole, legal adviser to the Gucci family since the 1980s and CEO of Gucci since 1994, campaigned for Gucci&#x27;s leather manufacturers in Italy to keep working together and developed a partners&#x27; program to strengthen their ties. He reviewed the pricing of each product and gradually raised Gucci&#x27;s advertising budget from $6 million in 1993 to $70 million in 1997. In October 1995, the company was publicly indexed on the New York Stock Exchange with an initial stock value set at US$22. Then, from 1995 to 1997, Investcorp sold its interests in Gucci for around US$1.9 billion.

=== LVMH-PPR struggle over Gucci ===
By January 1999, the French luxury conglomerate LVMH, which had been buying shares of Gucci discreetly since 1995, reached 34% ownership in Gucci Group NV. Seeking a way out of LVMH&#x27;s control, Tom Ford and Domenico De Sole turned to the French financier François Pinault and his group Pinault Printemps Redoute, which later became Kering, for an emergency exit. In March, Pinault&#x27;s group bought out 40% of Gucci at $75 a share, and LVMH&#x27;s shares decreased to 20.7% in a dilution process. Through the deal, PPR also purchased Yves Saint Laurent from Sanofi and sold it back for the same price to the Gucci Group. This &quot;coup d&#x27;état&quot; in the fashion world launched a cold war between LVMH and the new Gucci-PPR coalition. A tension occurred in December 2000 when Gucci bought 51% of Alexander McQueen&#x27;s couture house, as McQueen was also the creative designer of LVMH&#x27;s Givenchy at that time. The feud around Gucci ended in September 2001 when all parties reached an agreement. By the end of 2003, Tom Ford and Domenico De Sole made it official that they would not renew their contract with Gucci-PPR that ended in April 2004.

Following Ford&#x27;s departure, Gucci Group retained three designers to continue the success of the company&#x27;s flagship label: John Ray, Alessandra Facchinetti and Frida Giannini, all of whom had worked under Ford&#x27;s creative direction. Facchinetti was elevated to Creative Director of Women&#x27;s wear in 2004 and designed for two seasons before leaving the company. Ray served as Creative Director of Menswear for three years. Frida Giannini – a Gucci handbag designer since 2002, head of accessories since 2004, and creative director of women&#x27;s ready-to-wear and accessories since 2005 – was appointed creative director of Gucci in 2006. Patrizio di Marco, formerly CEO of Bottega Veneta, was named CEO of Gucci in 2008. Both acclaimed and criticized for perpetually revisiting Tom Ford&#x27;s archives, Frida Giannini eventually toned down Ford&#x27;s explosive &#x27;Porno Chic&#x27; props over the years &quot;from sexy to sensual&quot;, and started to experiment with &#x27;androgynous Bohemian&#x27; styles with a 19th-century reminiscence. She also developed &quot;neo-classics&quot; such as the New Bamboo and the New Jackie handbags. Patrizio di Marco focused on the post-2008 crisis with fewer styles and more midrange products. In 2010, Gucci launched a partnership with the auction house Christie&#x27;s to develop a wider repository of the brand&#x27;s archives and provide an authenticity certification service. In 2011, the company opened the Gucci Museum (&quot;Gucci Museo&quot;) in Florence to celebrate its 90th anniversary. Between 2010 and 2015, 220 new Gucci stores opened, bringing the total store count to 500.

=== Brand &quot;Renaissance&quot; ===

In December 2014, Marco Bizzarri, former CEO of Bottega Veneta, was named CEO of Gucci. He was tasked to reverse Gucci&#x27;s declining sales by giving a new impetus to the brand. In January 2015, Bizzarri appointed Alessandro Michele as the creative director of Gucci. Alessandro Michele had been working for Gucci since 2002, and he served as Frida Giannini&#x27;s deputy and head accessories designer. During the Fall show of February 2015, Alessandro Michele introduced &quot;a different Gucci&quot;, one with a &quot;sophisticated, intellectual and androgynous feel&quot;.

Alessandro Michele launched the &quot;Renaissance&quot; of Gucci. He revived Gucci classics, such as the double-G logo, the Jackie O. bag, and more; he also created iconic products like the Dionysus handbag. With a feminized menswear line, a strong feminist stance, and a &#x27;geek-chic&#x27; style, Alessandro Michele introduced postgender props for Gucci.

In September 2016 Gucci inaugurated the Gucci Hub, its new Milan headquarters, built in the former Caproni aeronautical factory. In July 2017, Gucci announced the launch of Gucci Décor, which was the first time the brand tested itself in the home decoration segment. In April 2018, Gucci inaugurated the ArtLab, a 37,000-square-metre center of innovation outside Florence in Italy, where new leather goods and materials, footwear, metal hardware, and packaging are developed and tested. In November 2018, Gucci opened the Gucci Wooster Bookstore in New York, a 2,000-book shop curated by the founder of Dashwood Books David Strettell. In April 2019, the company launched Gucci 9, a 500-employee network of 6 call centers worldwide for high-end customer service. Gucci also revived its makeup collection and launched its first fine jewelry collection. In December 2020, following an agreement between Kering and Alibaba, Gucci launched two stores (fashion and beauty) on Tmall. On November 23, 2022, Alessandro Michele left the post of creative director of Gucci.

In January 2023, Sabato de Sarno was appointed creative director of Gucci to &quot;reestablish Gucci&#x27;s edge&quot; and &quot;restore its brand equity&quot;, after the Bizzarri/Michele success had also eroded Gucci&#x27;s luxury glow. His first collection, dubbed &#x27;Gucci Ancora&#x27; (Italian for &#x27;Gucci again&#x27;) introduced a new It color, the &quot;Gucci Rosso Ancora&quot;, a velvet burgundy with an oxblood hue. For &quot;The New York Times&quot;&#x27; fashion journalist Vanessa Friedman, the collection was &quot;not a major statement, but rather a cleansing interregnum after the overblown muchness of Mr. Michele&#x27;s tenure&quot;, marking the dawn of a &quot;new era of pragmatism&quot; for the brand. During this creative reboot, the company launched a phase of restructuring and consolidation and in July 2023, Jean-François Palus replaced Marco Bizzarri as CEO of Gucci to drive the transition. Sales dropped 6% in 2023, a &quot;trying year&quot; according to Kering&#x27;s CEO François-Henri Pinault. In October 2024, Stefano Cantino took over as CEO. 

De Sarno&#x27;s tenure at Gucci concluded on February 6, 2025, when the company announced his departure from the Creative Director position.

==Initiatives==
===Culture===
In 2011, the company opened the Gucci Museum (&quot;Gucci Museo&quot;) inside the 14th-century Palazzo della Mercanzia in Florence to celebrate its 90th anniversary. In 2016, Alessandro Michele curated two additional rooms dedicated to Tom Ford&#x27;s collections. In January 2018, following a renovation, the Gucci Museum reopened with a new name, the &quot;Gucci Garden&quot;, and a new restaurant within its walls, the &quot;Gucci Osteria&quot;, managed by Massimo Bottura. The Gucci Osteria was awarded one Michelin star in November 2019. In February 2020, a second &quot;Gucci Osteria&quot; opened on the rooftop of the Gucci Rodeo Drive store in Los Angeles. In March 2022, Gucci opened a &quot;small but opulent&quot; cocktail bar, the &quot;Gucci Giardino 25&quot; in Florence.

In April 2017, Gucci financed the restoration of the Boboli Gardens at the Uffizi Gallery in Florence. In June 2019, Gucci financed the restoration of the historic Rupe Tarpea and Belvedere Gardens in Rome. In November 2022, Gucci pledged a three-year donation to help restore and preserve the Gyeongbokgung Palace in South Korea.

===Social===
In 2008, Gucci launched the Gucci Tribeca Documentary Fund, an $80,000 fund to finance movies promoting social change and presented at the Tribeca Film Festival. By 2011, the fund grew to $150,000, including $50,000 for a newly created Women Documentary Award. In 2011, with the Venice Film Festival, Gucci also launched the &#x27;Gucci Award for Women in Cinema&#x27; to underline the impact of women in film-making.

From 2005 to 2015, Gucci donated $20 million to UNICEF&#x27;s Schools for Africa program. Once Chime for Change was created, it became the funding vehicle of the Gucci-UNICEF partnership. Chime for Change was founded in February 2013 by Frida Giannini, Salma Hayek and Beyoncé as a global campaign for the improvement of education, health and justice for women worldwide. In June 2013, Chime for Change organized the Sound of Change Live concert which generated $4 million to fund 200 projects in 70 countries. In December 2013, Gucci inked a partnership with Twitter and Women Who Code to create the women-focused hackathon Chime Hack.

Gucci sells a yellow t-shirt that reads &quot;My Body My Choice&quot; and redistributes its proceeds to Chime for Change. In July 2013, activist Lydia Emily was commissioned to paint a mural on Skid Row, Los Angeles of a woman named Jessica, who is a survivor of human trafficking. In January 2019, Chime for Change launched the murals campaign &quot;To Gather Together&quot; promoting gender equality and designed by the artist MP5. In 2020, Gucci launched an &quot;Unconventional Beauty&quot; ad campaign, including a model with Down syndrome.

During the COVID-19 pandemic, Gucci pledged €2 million to two crowdfunding campaigns, the first to support the Italian Civil Protection Department, and the second for the COVID-19 Solidarity Response Fund.

In 2023, Gucci reinforced its alliance with UNICEF with a new financial donation of 300,000 euros to the organization&#x27;s Education Thematic Fund which seeks to ensure children&#x27;s right to a &#x27;high-quality&#x27; education globally.

===Environment===
In 2015, Gucci launched its own environmental profit and loss initiative. In October 2017, Gucci announced it would ban furs from its stores in 2018. In June 2018, the brand launched &#x27;Equilibrium&#x27;, its platform to communicate on its social and environmental efforts and progress. In June 2020, Gucci launched its first fully sustainable collection &quot;Gucci Off the Grid&quot;. This collection included pieces made from organic, natural and sustainable materials like organic cotton, recycled steel as well as regenerated polyamide. In September 2022, Gucci received the Climate Action Award due to its devotion to environmental sustainability. In 2023, Gucci obtained the Ellen MacArthur Foundation Award for Circular Economy at the Camera Nazionale della Moda Italiana (CNMI). In February 2023, Gucci announced the launch of the Circular Hub, it next-generation manufacturing hub optimized for circularity and carbon efficiency. Later in October 2023, Gucci introduced the Horsebit 1955 bag made with Demetra, an animal-free material, which was awarded the prize for best vegan bag two months later by PETA.

== In popular culture ==
=== Eponymous adjective ===
&quot;Gucci&quot; is often used as an eponymous adjective; for example, &quot;I feel Gucci!&quot; or &quot;that’s so Gucci!&quot; are used to describe feeling luxurious or referencing something as being luxurious. The earliest known instance of Gucci used in this sense is Lenny Kravitz describing his bedroom as &quot;very Gucci&quot; in the September 1999 issue of &quot;Harper&#x27;s Bazaar.&quot;

=== Movies ===
After initially announcing plans for a movie about the Gucci dynasty in 2007, filmmaker Ridley Scott detailed specifics about his movie in November 2019; titled &quot;House of Gucci&quot;, the movie would star Lady Gaga as Patrizia Reggiani and Adam Driver as Maurizio Gucci. &quot;House of Gucci&quot;″s world premiere took place at the Odeon Luxe Leicester Square in London on November 9, 2021. The Gucci family heirs called Scott&#x27;s movie &quot;an insult to the legacy on which the brand is built today&quot;. In 2000, Martin Scorsese had also announced plans to make a movie about the Gucci family.

=== Guinness World Records ===
*1974: The &quot;Model 2000&quot; Gucci watch broke the record for selling more than one million units in two years.
*1998: The Gucci &quot;Genius Jeans&quot; set the record as the most expensive pair of jeans. The jeans were distressed, ripped, and covered with African-inspired beads and were priced at US$3,134 in Milan.

==Counterfeiting==
During the 1970s, the explosive popularity of Gucci turned the brand into a prime target of the counterfeiting industry. The Gucci workshops elaborated the brindle pigskin tanning technique that became a Gucci signature, and a tanning process difficult to counterfeit. In 1977 alone, Gucci launched 34 lawsuits for counterfeiting. By the mid-1980s, the brand was involved in &quot;thousands of confiscations and lawsuits all over the world&quot;.

In 2013, the UK&#x27;s Intellectual Property Office issued a ruling that Gucci had lost the rights to its GG trademark in the UK &quot;to a version of the GG logo in four categories, which encompassed garments such as bracelets, shoulder bags, scarves and coats&quot;. However, &quot;according to Gucci, the ruling does not affect the use of its GG logo in the region&quot; because &quot;Gucci is the owner of several other valid registrations for this mark, including a Community Trade Mark (covering the European Union) for its iconic GG logo and those rights are directly enforceable in the U.K.&quot;

In November 2008, the website TheBagAddiction.com was shut down after being sued by Gucci for selling counterfeit products. In 2013, Gucci cracked down on 155 domain names used by counterfeiters to sell fake Gucci products. In 2015, Gucci&#x27;s parent company Kering sued the Chinese website Alibaba for listing a lot of &quot;obviously fake Gucci products&quot; on its website. In April 2016, Gucci&#x27;s anti-counterfeiting legal actions backfired when the targeted products were papier-mâché shaped exactly like Gucci products and burned by Chinese people during the ancestral Qingming Jie tradition. In April 2017, Gucci won a lawsuit against 89 Chinese websites selling fake Gucci products. In October 2018, Marco Bizzarri warned the Chinese ecommerce giants Alibaba and JD.com that Gucci could not open shop on their websites as long as they would not remove the many fake Gucci products out of their listings. In December 2019, Gucci sued three dozen websites selling fake Gucci products. In 2023, Gucci USA filed a lawsuit against Sam&#x27;s Club, Century 21 and Lord &amp; Taylor for selling counterfeit Gucci products.

==Controversies==
In April 2016, the UK&#x27;s Advertising Standards Authority banned a Gucci online video ad because it starred an &quot;unhealthily thin&quot; model.

In February 2019, Gucci removed a black balaclava sweater with a rollup collar and a cut-out red-lipped mouth from its shelves after it had been compared to a blackface costume (Michele was inspired by Leigh Bowery but still apologized). To address this issue, Gucci launched the &#x27;Gucci North America Changemakers Scholarship&#x27; program dedicated to foster diversity within the fashion industry with a $5-million annual fund to support non-profits and community-based programs involved with &quot;the African-American community and communities of color at-large&quot;. Two months later, the Sikhs community in India criticized Gucci&#x27;s cultural appropriation of a religious item when the Italian brand commercialized turbans at $800 apiece. Gucci appointed a Global Head of Diversity to address the brand&#x27;s latest issues with cultural diversity and launched a $1.5-million scholarship program for US students traditionally underrepresented in the fashion industry.

During a September 2019 show that mimicked a défilé of mental patients, catwalk model Ayesha Tan Jones held up her hands on which &quot;mental health is not fashion&quot; was written, a reaction to the brand&#x27;s inappropriate commercial use of the imagery of mental illness. Kering paid a $1.25 billion tax settlement in Italy following Gucci&#x27;s 2011–2017 tax irregularities.

In November 2023, in response to Gucci&#x27;s October decision to move 153 of 219 design employees from Rome to Milan by March 2024, 50 employees went on a one-day strike in the first industrial action against the company in its 102-year history. Trade union representatives say the workers intend to protest throughout the month of November 2023.

<text>Five Ancestor Boxing (&quot;Wuzuquan&quot; or &quot;Ngo-cho Kun&quot;) is a Southern Chinese martial art that consists of principles and techniques from five styles:

* the breathing methods and iron body of Bodhidharma (達尊拳)
* the posture and dynamic power of Luohan (羅漢拳)
* the precision and efficient movement of Emperor Taizu (太祖拳)
* the hand techniques and the complementary softness and hardness of Fujian White Crane (白鶴拳)
* the agility and footwork of Monkey (猴拳)

These five styles and their characteristic techniques were combined during the creation of the Five Ancestor System. They were consolidated by a sixth influence, Xuan Nu, also known as Hian Loo (玄女拳) and &quot;The Lady in the Green Dress&quot;, who introduced the most deadly of its techniques, Dim Mak—lethal strikes to the pressure points of the body.

==History==
The original concept of Wu Zu Quan has its origin in the early practice by Southern Tai Zu martial artist in venerating the Five Ancestors or Wu Zu 五祖 dating as far back as around the 1600s the Five Ancestors are (1) Tai Zu 太祖 for the emperors of China (2) Guan Nim 觀音 the goddess of mercy that is recognize and venerated by both Taoist and Buddhism (3) Lo Han 羅漢 immortal warriors protector of earth later adapted by the warrior monks of Shaolin that were always ready to assist China&#x27;s emperors in safe guarding the empire&#x27;s rural areas against bandits, pirates and foreign invaders (4) Da Mo 達尊 the person instrumental in introducing Buddhism to China and (5) Xuan Nu 玄女 the deity of vitality and nourishment later to be related to a female monk responsible in advancing pressure point and herbal science of medicine. In other words, the original concept of Five Ancestors was about the five traditional religious practices of dynasty China which are Taoism, Buddhism, Confucianism, Emperor worshipping and ancestor-deity worshipping this tradition was widely practised by the secret societies called Tien De Hui 天地會 Heaven Earth Society. Since the fall of the Ming dynasty 1644 the Tai Zu Quan was the dominant martial art system especially in Fujian province China. Tai Zu Quan was an amalgamation of all the known martial art systems of that time it was a representation of the dynasty martial prowess and glory. 

In the 1800s some Tai Zu masters will redefine Wu Zu to Wu Zu Quan. The two most prominent Tai Zu masters that will create and redefine Wu Zu to Wu Zu Quan were (1) Li Jin Ren 李俊仁 his Wu Zu Quan will be known as Yong Chun Wu Zu Quan 永春五祖拳 and (2) Chua Giok Beng 蔡玉明 his Wu Zu will be refer as Wu Zu Quan Ho Yang Pai 五祖拳何阳派. Both founders created their version of Wu Zu making it about martial arts. While many Tai Zu martial artist embraced, and join either Yong Chun or Ho Yang Pai Wu Zu Quan, others did not they continue to retain the original concept of Tai Zu Wu Zu. And because of the shared roots, history, tradition such as the green lion, the martial art systems the many forms, the concept and principle of the Sam Chien, Tai Cho Wu Zu and Wu Zu Quan will become one and inseparable.

Later in the late 1950s another version of Wuzuquan history-origin will be revealed thanks to the late Grand master Chee Kim Thong from Malaysia putting the founding of the art around 1300 AD attributed to Bái Yùfeng,[1] a famous 13th century monk from the original Henan Shaolin Temple in the North of China to whom Five Animals style and Hóngquán (洪拳) have also been attributed.

It is believed during the fall of the Ming dynasty many Bai Yu Feng disciples will flee to Fujian province integrating with Fujian martial art system such as the Yong Chun White Crane. Thus, the history of Wu Zu Quan have four versions:
# Tai Zu Wuzuquan 太祖五祖拳 early Tai Zu martial artist venerate the Five Ancestors. 
# Yong Chun Wuzuquan 永春五祖拳 founded by Li Jun Ren 李俊仁 sometime in the late 1800s base in Yong Chun Fujian China. Both Li and Chua were close martial art friends.
# Ho Yang Pai Wuzuquan 鹤阳派五祖拳 founded by Chua Giok Beng at the same time sometime in the late 1800s.
# Bai Yu Feng Wuzuquan 白玉峰五祖拳 a northern system that migrated to Fujian China and integrated with Fujian Tai Zu system.
Some practitioners also credit a sixth influence of the Xuan Nu (玄女拳) system, with its emphasis on flowing movements and humility, for refining the art of Five Ancestors. [2]

==Styles==
The Five Fighting Styles are:

1. Grand Ancestor Boxing (Taizu Quan): The characteristic of this boxing style is its solidity and internal strength. The feeling of the stance is that of the feet gripping the ground. The arms and legs are hard as iron and the twisting of the waist is like a lively dragon. Further, the body is said to be like an iron shield and the advancing steps like a ferocious tiger pouncing on its prey. Attacking and defending moves are executed simultaneously. Although it seems like one is working with hardness and tension, the transitions between movements are subtle and smooth.

2. Arhat Boxing (Luohan Quan): This style was developed in the initial Shaolin era and named for Da Mo, who came from India to spread health-preservation exercises to the Chinese people; these exercises were incorporated into existing systems and later known as Shaolin martial arts and Qlgong. The footwork of Luohan Quan is a front-bow, back-arrow horse stance. The arms are like iron; the hands and palms like those of a dragon playing with water. The attacking techniques are not head-on but rather from the sides.

3. White Crane Boxing (Baihe Quan): White Crane features the power of the forearm for striking and parrying. Combined with its rapid change of footwork, the method of hooking and seizing to control an opponent&#x27;s arm is sudden and powerful. The characteristics of this boxing is to train the practitioner to be agile in footwork and movement. White Crane Qin na is also an exceptional skill to master.

4. Monkey boxing (Hou Quan): Relying on its characteristic nimbleness and agility, Hou Quan emphasizes short, rapid movements to engage the enemy. Using techniques to feint and confuse the opponent, it is adept with catching, striking, and finger techniques for defense and attack. Its best feature is the quick change of body, speed, and strength of hand and palm. It is also famous for ground techniques such as rolling, tumbling, and other deceiving actions. Most of its attacks are aimed at the opponent&#x27;s knees, groin area, throat, or eyes. Hand strikes are typically open-hand slaps or claws with a semi-closed fist (the monkey claw).

5. Soft Boxing (Xuan Nu Quan): A soft but powerful fighting style characterized by the use of a relaxed tension to overcome an opposing force and redirect it at the opponent. Emphasizing softness as a means of training it works to condition the tendons, bones, and muscles into an elastic strength. Xuan Nu Quan trains the student to emit power by transferring strength from the legs through the waist and to the arms. Among all of the five arts, Xuan Nu Quan is hardest to master, but once attained, it serves to complete mastery of the art of Wuzu Quan. The practitioner will come to understand the harmony of hardness and softness, internal and external, and the theory and principles of Taiji as the Grand Ultimate.

==Characteristics==
One of the primary characteristics of Five Ancestors is its reliance on the Sam Chien (literally &quot;three battles&quot;:三戦) stance and the corresponding hand form of the same name, which it obtained from Fujian White Crane. The &quot;three battles&quot; refer primarily to the three stages of Wuzu practitioners can achieve: combat preparation, combat tactic and combat strategy; all of which must be mastered in order to attained a good level. &quot;Three Battles&quot; has multi-faceted meaning: conceptual, physical, and spiritual.

Sam Chien can also be said to allow development of the eight Five Ancestor principles and so, is considered the most important form in the style. Indeed, it is said that this form contains all the principles of the Five Ancestors system. Thus it is the first form taught to junior students, so that they may explore the essential points of Five Ancestors from the start of their training. With the practitioner&#x27;s progress in understanding the essence of Sam Chien, all of their movements are immediately improved as a consequence. Thus, it is a strong adage believed by senior/master level practitioners that, without the most basic essential understanding of Sam Chien, all of the fighting forms are rendered as much less effective. Fighting forms are relatively uncomplicated, but have a heavy reliance on one&#x27;s Sam Chien evolving understanding. Thus, Sam Chien keeps being practised even by those who are very senior in the arts: &quot;Since the beginning learning Sam Chien. Until pass away keeps learning Sam Chien.&quot; The writer here can&#x27;t emphasize enough that junior practitioners see how important it is to keep training Sam Chien while progressing to learn different forms at the same time. It looks and feels boring, but without it a Wuzuquan practitioner is nothing.

Although the exact method depends on the school, Five Ancestors is known for its large variety of power generational methods. Due to the distinct character of each ancestor, these methods change depending on the power required. Some schools teach tension forms that develop power, of which there are about ten, and fist forms that train technique, of which there are dozens. Others stress a relaxed body, instead seeking maximum transmission of the relevant &quot;jin&quot;. For the He Yang (何阳)branch/School, these 2 extremes are represented by the Lu Wanding/Lo Ban Teng (盧萬定) lineages representing the earlier. The teaching of Lu style is mostly in Indonesia (in the city of Jakarta and Surakarta/Solo). The latter is represented by the latter teaching of Shen Yangde/Sim Yang Tek (沈扬徳) whose style evolved from more direct in the earlier teaching In Xiamen to the &quot;seeking maximum transmission of the relevant &quot;jin&quot; &quot;when he had moved to Singapore. The Surakarta/Solo branch has a unique execution as it integrates the Lu and the earlier Shen&#x27;s teaching. For those who are intimate to the art, GM Liem’s style could be said “upper body Sim, lower body Lo.” The style was popularized in solo by Lin Shui Gang/Liem Tjoei Kang (林水港) who was the nephew of Lu as well as an adopted son of Shen. In the surface, it seems to be counter-intuitive to integrate two opposite spectrum of teaching. However, the underlying principle of He Yang lineages are the same and the integration follows the principles taught by Coshu He Yang and proven as effective as the other lineages. &quot;Hard&quot; and &quot;soft&quot; are relative concepts in Wuzuquan as it is like a fine combing. However, for those with proficiency in the style, there exist a correlation with the ideal fighting distance: the &quot;softer&quot; one school&#x27;s style is perceived within Wuzuquan, the shorter is the ideal/preferred fighting distance. This is a consequence of the emphasis of the school&#x27;s power generation method, again usually is only perceivable to those who have prowess in the arts.

The six principles of the footwork are as follows:

# Big Gate
# Small Gate
# Middle Gate 
# Front Gate 
# Back Gate 
# Turn Gate 

The base are the same as other southern styles:

* Tun (Swallow) 
* Tu (Spit) 
* Fu (Float) 
* Chen (Sink)

but Five Ancestors also adds on top of it a second set:

* Fen (Scatter) 
* Bi (Fold) 
* Tuo (Prop) 
* Dun (Stop)

The five power generation methods are as follows:

# Legs 
# Pelvis 
# Body 
# Dantian 
# Inch Chase 

On top of this are miscellaneous hand forms, two-man forms (also known as form-drill) that may or may not include sticking hands, and forms for a comprehensive arsenal of weapons including rice bowl and chopsticks, umbrellas, and even opium pipes.

Over the decades masters have added to this list, introducing material they considered relevant to the time.

Five Ancestors is now taught in China, Malaysia, Philippines, Indonesia, Singapore, Australia, New Zealand, Ireland, Sweden, the United Kingdom, Germany, Norway, Sweden, the United States, Switzerland, Canada, Denmark, and Spain.

==Governance==
The peak international body for Wuzuquan is the International South Shaolin Wuzuquan Federation 国际南少林五祖拳联谊总会, which was established in 1989. Some of the early President of the Federation were Dr. Lo King Hui, Dr. Chee Kim Thong, Grand master Zhou Kun Ming, Grand master Yap Ching Hai, Grand Master Han Jin Yuan, Grand master John Graham. The twelfth President of the Federation is James Chee of Australia, who took over from John Graham of the United States in November 2011. The current President 2013 -2016 is Grand master Henry Lo 盧思明 of Philippines. The Federation convenes annually in Quanzhou, Fujian, China with discussions held regarding the preservation, expansion and unity of the art.

==Ranking system==
An internationally recognized ranking system for Wuzuquan practitioners was established at the 2010 International Shaolin Wuzuquan Federation conference, in Quanzhou China. A ten level (&quot;duan&quot;) system was agreed upon for the most senior grades, and mirrors the equivalent systems used in karate (dan) and taekwondo. The 10th duan is recognised as the highest level, whilst the 1st duan is the lowest. However, not all legitimate branches actively participate in the union.

The first group of honorary 10th duan Wuzuquan practitioners to be formally recognized includes both living and deceased masters. These masters are awarded the duan for their involvement in the promotion of Wuzuquan. These 10th duan practitioners include Chee Kim Thong (Malaysia), Yap Ching Hai (Malaysia), Kim Han (United Kingdom), James Chee (Australia), Lu Qing Hui (Philippines), Hsu Nai Jing (Singapore), Chen Hung (Philippines), Su Zai Fu (Quanzhou), Zhi Yuan Li (Philippines), Shan Fa (Taiwan), Huang Qing Jiang (Quanzhou), Lu Si Ming (Philippines), Hong Dun Geng (Hong Kong).
John Graham of the United States was awarded the rank of 10th duan at the 2011 International Shaolin Wuzuquan Federation conference.

<doc id="844155" wikidata="Q2328749" url="?curid=844155" title="Sangre de Cristo Mountains">
<text>The Sangre de Cristo Mountains (Spanish for &quot;Blood of Christ&quot;) are the southernmost subrange of the Rocky Mountains. They are located in southern Colorado and northern New Mexico in the United States. The mountains run from Poncha Pass in South-Central Colorado, trending southeast and south, ending at Glorieta Pass, southeast of Santa Fe, New Mexico.
The mountains contain a number of fourteen thousand foot peaks in the Colorado portion, as well as several peaks in New Mexico which are over thirteen thousand feet.

The name of the mountains may refer to the occasional reddish hues observed during sunrise and sunset, and when alpenglow occurs, especially when the mountains are covered with snow. Although the particular origin of the name is unclear, it has been in use since the early 19th century. Before that time the terms &quot;La Sierra Nevada&quot;, &quot;La Sierra Madre&quot;, &quot;La Sierra&quot;, and &quot;The Snowies&quot; (used by English speakers) were used. According to legend, &quot;sangre de Cristo&quot; were the last words of a priest who was killed by Native Americans.

==Land management and recreation overview==

Much of the mountains are within various National Forests: the Rio Grande and San Isabel in Colorado, and the Carson and Santa Fe in New Mexico. These publicly accessible areas are managed by the United States Forest Service and are popular for hunting, camping, hiking, mountain biking, backpacking, climbing, and cross-country and downhill skiing.

The mountains include two large wilderness areas, the Sangre de Cristo Wilderness in Colorado and the Pecos Wilderness in New Mexico, as well as some smaller wilderness areas, such as Latir Peak Wilderness. The Great Sand Dunes National Park and Preserve lies on the southwest side of the mountains in Colorado and are managed by the National Park Service.

==Subranges==
The Sangre de Cristo Mountains are divided into various subranges, described here from north to south. Use of the terms &quot;Sangre de Cristo Range&quot; and &quot;Sangre de Cristo Mountains&quot; is inconsistent and may refer to the northernmost subrange, the southernmost subrange, or the mountains as a whole.

===Sangre de Cristo Range===

The Sangre de Cristo Range, the largest and most northerly subrange of the Sangre de Cristo Mountains, runs directly along the east side of the Rio Grande rift, extending southeast from Poncha Pass for about 75 miles (120 km) through south-central Colorado to La Veta Pass, approximately 20 miles (32 km) west of Walsenburg. They form a high ridge separating the San Luis Valley on the west from the watershed of the Arkansas River on the east.

===Crestones===
The Crestones are a group of four + peaks (fourteeners) in the Sangre de Cristo Range above Crestone, Colorado.

===Spanish Peaks===
The Spanish Peaks are a pair of mountains, West Spanish Peak, , and East Spanish Peak, , located in southwestern Huerfano County, Colorado. The Spanish Peaks were designated a National Natural Landmark in 1976 as one of the best known examples of igneous dikes. The mountains can be seen from as far as to the north from Colorado Springs, to the south from Raton, New Mexico, and to the east from La Junta, Colorado.

===Culebra Range===
The Culebra Range runs almost due north and south, with its northern limit at La Veta Pass in Colorado, and its southern limit at Costilla Creek, just south of Big Costilla Peak in New Mexico. Its highest point is Culebra Peak at , which is notable for being the only fourteener in Colorado on private land with an access fee. Climbers wishing to ascend Culebra must pay a fee (currently US$150 per person), and the number of climbers per year is limited. It is also the most southerly fourteener in the U.S. Rockies. Standing to the east of the main crest are the two prominent Spanish Peaks (West: , East: ). These peaks were important landmarks for 19th century travelers on the mountain branch of the Santa Fe Trail.

The western slope of the Culebras and the San Luis Valley are located within the Sangre de Cristo Land Grant, dating back to the 1840s but still a factor in the pattern of land ownership within the grant. The San Luis Valley is arid. The town of San Luis, Colorado has an annual precipitation of only .The surrounding area, traversed by Culebra Creek, has a rich agricultural history and has been the scene of land disputes between the descendants of Hispanic settlers and Anglo ranchers since the 1860s.

===Taos Mountains===
The Taos Mountains span the western lobe of the range from Costilla Creek in the north, to Tres Ritos in the south. They include the highest point in New Mexico, Wheeler Peak, at , which is part of the Wheeler Peak Wilderness. Other notable peaks include Pueblo Peak, which at rises dramatically above Taos Pueblo, and Latir Peak, at . Williams Lake is located below Wheeler Peak in the Wheeler Peak Wilderness.

Taos Ski Valley lies just to the west of Wheeler Peak. Much of the central portion of the Taos Mountains is on Taos Pueblo land. As viewed from Taos, they are locally called &quot;Taos Mountain.&quot;

The southern portion of the Taos Mountains, between Palo Flechado Pass and Tres Ritos (U.S. Route 64 and NM Route 518), is lower and less dramatic than the northern section, with its high point being Cerro Vista, . The Fernando Mountains are a small subrange lying in this section, just south of US Route 64.

===Cimarron Range===

The Cimarron Range lies across the Moreno Valley to the east of the Taos Mountains. It is a lower range, with its highest point being Baldy Mountain at . The Philmont Scout Ranch lies on the east side of the Cimarron Range.

===Rincon Mountains===
This is a minor subrange, significantly lower than the rest of the Sangre de Cristos; it lies east of the southernmost portion of the Taos Mountains.

===Santa Fe Mountains===
Rounding out the Sangre de Cristo Mountains are the Santa Fe Mountains, which include all peaks south of NM Route 518. This group lies near Santa Fe and surrounds the Pecos Wilderness, which protects the source watershed of the Pecos River. The peaks include Truchas Peak, , as their highest point. Other notable peaks are Santa Fe Baldy () and Jicarita Peak (). The Pecos Wilderness is crossed by many trails and is popular for backpacking and for fishing in its high alpine lakes.

==Geology==
The Sangre de Cristo Mountains were uplifted during the Cenozoic Laramide orogeny. They are bounded on the west by the Rio Grande rift and on the east by a series of reverse and thrust faults. Vertical displacement along the faults is at least , and gravity measurements suggest the uplift has been thrust eastward great distances. This faulting places Precambrian basement rock in contact with sedimentary strata along the eastern margin of the uplift except where igneous rocks have been intruded along the fault.

<text>Raymond Arthur Gillen (May 12, 1959 – December 1, 1993) was an American rock singer. He is best known for his work with Badlands, in addition to his stint with Black Sabbath in the mid-1980s and recording most of the vocals on Phenomena&#x27;s &quot;Dream Runner&quot; album.

== Early life ==
Gillen was born on May 12, 1959, in New York, but was raised in Cliffside Park, New Jersey. He was an only child and started singing while in high school. He played the New Jersey club circuit with various bands, including club bands Quest (1978–80), the punk rock influenced F-66 (1980–81), Savage, and, most notably, Vendetta and Harlette. In 1985, he joined Bobby Rondinelli&#x27;s band, Rondinelli.

== Career ==
In 1986, Black Sabbath started touring for the &quot;Seventh Star&quot; album when after only a few shows, singer Glenn Hughes got into a fist-fight and lost his voice due to the related sinus and throat injuries. Gillen was offered the job to replace Hughes. After finishing the &quot;Seventh Star&quot; tour, Black Sabbath recorded their next album &quot;The Eternal Idol&quot; with Gillen. However, due to mix of financial burden, writing difficulty (Bob Daisley was recruited for writing as Gillen turned out to be not much of a composer), mismanagement and miscommunication that plagued the band, Gillen and Black Sabbath drummer Eric Singer quit before the album was ever released. Gillen was eventually replaced by Tony Martin, and the vocal track of &quot;The Eternal Idol&quot; was hurriedly rerecorded note-for-note with Martin before the album was finally released in 1987. However, demo versions of &quot;The Eternal Idol&quot; featuring Gillen do exist on the bootleg circuit and on the 2010 deluxe Eternal Idol re-release. Also, in an interview Martin revealed that the sinister laugh heard on the track &quot;Nightmare&quot; is in fact Gillen&#x27;s voice. The album was re-released on November 1, 2010, in Europe in a 2-disc expanded set including a bonus disc with Gillen&#x27;s recording.

During the time of the &quot;Seventh Star&quot; tour, Gillen was asked by project director and co-producer Wilfried F. Rimensberger to join Mel Galley&#x27;s Phenomena for the recording of the album &quot;Dream Runner&quot;, which features vocals from Glenn Hughes, John Wetton and Max Bacon. He recorded 4 tracks. Gillen is also featured in Phenomena&#x27;s &#x27;Did it all for Love&#x27; music video although he was not involved in the actual recording of that song.

After the Phenomena recordings, Gillen joined John Sykes (previously with Whitesnake, Thin Lizzy and a different band called Badlands) with the intention to form a new band Blue Murder. Gillen sang demos but parted company when Sykes decided to handle vocals himself.

Gillen then contacted Jake E. Lee (former Ozzy Osbourne guitarist) to form a band. In 1988, Gillen formed Badlands with Lee and recruited his friend Eric Singer with whom he had played in Black Sabbath. Gillen recorded two albums (&quot;Badlands&quot; and &quot;Voodoo Highway&quot;) with Badlands and the band toured from 1989 until 1992. In 1998 a third album (&quot;Dusk&quot;) was released from a collection of demos recorded 1992–1993. They enjoyed moderate commercial success with their first two albums, but tensions between its band members, as well as problems with both management and their label Atlantic Records, hastened the band&#x27;s demise. Gillen was briefly replaced by John West and Badlands dissolved soon afterwards. Their third album &quot;Dusk&quot;, which is made up of demos recorded shortly before Gillen&#x27;s dismissal from the band, was released posthumously in 1998.

Following his split from Badlands, Gillen stayed in L.A. and was involved with two projects. He joined forces with drummer Randy Castillo and Iggy Pop band members Whitey Kirst and Craig Pike under the name Cockfight. He also joined the band Terriff, led by guitarist Joe Holmes, fresh off his stint with David Lee Roth on the &quot;A Little Ain&#x27;t Enough&quot; tour. Gillen rehearsed with the group for several months before moving back to his native New York. He also went to form the band Sun Red Sun with old friends.

== Illness and death ==
In 1993, Wilfried F. Rimensberger was planning a remake of his first Metal Hammer Loreley Festival but this time specifically to stage Phenomena&#x27;s first ever live performance, with Gillen on vocals. It was going to be the launch event for a series of concerts across Europe in 1994. Gillen called from New York and told Rimensberger in Munich that he had to bow out because he was too ill to perform.

Gillen died from an AIDS-related disease in a New York hospital on December 1, 1993. He first showed symptoms of the disease around 1990, and according to his Badlands bandmate Jake E. Lee, &quot;in between the first and the second record, he started getting really thin and didn&#x27;t look quite as healthy&quot;. Lee also claimed that he had not been aware of Gillen&#x27;s diagnosis with AIDS until a meeting with then-Badlands manager Paul O&#x27;Neill, who threatened to tell Atlantic Records about Gillen&#x27;s illness if he was fired by the band. Gillen reportedly denied it, saying to Lee, &quot;Well, it&#x27;s not true, so fuck him. Fire him.&quot; Lee concluded, &quot;So we did fire him. And he did tell Atlantic Records that. And we got kind of screwed on the second record because of it. They wouldn&#x27;t even give us tour-support money at all...but, yeah, Paul O&#x27;Neill fucked us on that.&quot;

Gillen was survived by a daughter, Ashley (born July 1984). He is buried at Fairview Cemetery in Fairview, New Jersey.

He was ranked at 100 on Hit Parader&#x27;s Top 100 Metal Vocalists.

<text>The compressed ROM/RAM file system (or cramfs) is a free (GPL&#x27;ed) read-only Linux file system designed for simplicity and space-efficiency. It is mainly used in embedded and small-footprint systems.

Unlike a compressed image of a conventional file system, a cramfs image can be used as it is, i.e. without first decompressing it. For this reason, some Linux distributions use cramfs for initrd images (Debian 3.1 in particular) and installation images (SUSE Linux in particular), where there are constraints on memory and image size.

In 2013, Linux maintainers indicated that cramfs was made obsolete by squashfs, but the file system got rehabilitated in 2017 for use in low-memory devices where using squashfs may not be viable.

==Design==
Files on cramfs file systems are zlib-compressed one page at a time to allow random read access. The metadata is not compressed, but is expressed in a terse representation that is more space-efficient than conventional file systems.

The file system is intentionally read-only to simplify its design; random write access for compressed files is difficult to implement. cramfs ships with a utility (codice_1) to pack files into new cramfs images.

File sizes are limited to less than 16MB.

Maximum file system size is a little under 272MB. (The last file on the file system must begin before the 256MB block, but can extend past it.)

<doc id="844159" wikidata="Q1308627" url="?curid=844159" title="Madhya Bharat">
<text>Madhya Bharat, also known as [[Malwa|Malwa Union]], was an Indian state in west-central India, created on 28 May 1948 from twenty-five princely states which until 1947 had been part of the Central India Agency, with Jiwajirao Scindia as its Rajpramukh.

The union had an area of .Gwalior was made the capital and the first legislative assembly took place inside the Moti Mahal of Gwalior. It was bordered by the states of Bombay (presently Gujarat and Maharashtra) to the southwest, Rajasthan to the northwest, Uttar Pradesh to the north, and Vindhya Pradesh to the east, and Bhopal State and Madhya Pradesh to the southeast. The population was mostly Hindu and Hindi-speaking.

On 1 November 1956, Madhya Bharat, together with the states of Vindhya Pradesh and Bhopal State, was merged into Madhya Pradesh.

==Districts==
Madhya Bharat comprised sixteen districts and these districts were initially divided into three Commissioners&#x27; Divisions, which were later reduced to two. The districts were:
# Bhind District
# Gird District
# Morena District
# Guna District
# Shivpuri District
# Rajgarh District
# Bhilsa District
# Shajapur District
# Ujjain District
# Indore District
# Dewas District
# Ratlam District
# Dhar District
# Jhabua District
# Nimar District
# Mandsaur District

==Politics==
The nominal head of Madhya Bharat state was Rajpramukh (Governor). It had also the post of an Uparajpramukh. The state had a Vidhan Sabha of 99 members, who were elected from 79 constituencies (59 single member and 20 double member). There were 9 Lok Sabha constituencies in the state (7 single member and 2 double member).

Jivaji Rao Scindia was Rajpramukh of the state from 28 May 1948 to 31 October 1956 and Liladhar Joshi was the first Chief Minister. He was succeeded by Gopi Krishna Vijayvargiya in May 1949. On 18 October 1950, Takhatmal Jalori became the third Chief Minister of Madhya Bharat.

In the 1952 Madhya Bharat Legislative Assembly election, the Indian National Congress won 75 seats and the Hindu Mahasabha won 11 seats. Mishrilal Gangwal of Indian National Congress became the Chief Minister on 3 March 1952. After his resignation, Takhatmal Jain (Jalori) again became the Chief Minister on 16 April 1955. He was the Chief Minister of the state till 31 October 1956.

==Geography==

Madhya Bharat state was situated in the Madhya Bharat plateau (presently lying under most of northwestern Madhya Pradesh state and Central Rajasthan). This plateau is bounded by the Indo-Gangetic plain to the north, the Bundelkhand upland to the east, the Malwa Plateau to the south, and the East Rajasthan Uplands on the west.

<text>Gone South was a music festival in Tasmania, Australia. It has been held in both Launceston and Hobart at various times. It has been promoted by local Hobart businessman Charles Touber, and more recently in conjunction with Karen Henderson.

The location of festivals in the state has always been a difficult problem, as unlike other states, Tasmania&#x27;s population is evenly distributed inside and outside the capital city, and as a result there is huge rivalry between the north (Launceston) and south (Hobart) of the state. Hobart residents tend to be less keen to travel to a festival, whereas people from Launceston are used to events being in Hobart only, and therefore are not as averse to travelling.

The promoters have stated that Launceston is the best site for the festival as it is geographically the most centrally accessible city in Tasmania, located less than two hours&#x27; drive from Hobart, the north-west, and the east coast.
The 2002 event that featured Incubus was held at Hobart due to State government sponsorship for that event.
No plans for future events have currently been announced.

==1999 Launceston==
The first event was held in December 1999 at the Inveresk Railyards in Launceston. 
The line-up included Grinspoon, Paul Kelly, Killing Heidi, Silverchair, Powderfinger and Alex Lloyd. Touber greatly underestimated the popularity of the event, with huge queues for food, water and toilets most of the day. Despite this, the event proved extremely popular and drew crowds of 12,000 people - Launceston&#x27;s population was 90,000 at the time.

==2002 Hobart==
The second was held at the TCA Ground at the Domain in Hobart in March 2002 under sponsorship from the state government. Featuring the American band Incubus and the Australian bands; Machine Gun Fellatio, Sonic Animation, Grinspoon, Killing Heidi and numerous Tasmanian bands. Despite bad weather and the late cancellation of a headlining act (Silverchair), the second festival drew crowds of over 13,000 people.

==2002 Launceston==
The third &quot;Gone South&quot; was in Launceston in November 2002. There were a few unusual changes that made this event less popular. First of all, country singer Kasey Chambers was one of the acts, which was very out of alignment with the other acts - Grinspoon, Alex Lloyd, Sonic Animation, Superheist, Motor Ace, You Am I and Pacifier. Second, it was only eight months since the previous concert. Third, it was in November, which was during exams for many school and University students. Amid threats to cancel the event due to poor ticket sales, the event went ahead, although a much smaller crowd than usual at 9000.

==2003 Launceston==
The fourth and most recent event was again in Launceston in December 2003. Scheduled for the weekend before Christmas, plans were looking great, with popular bands Powderfinger, John Butler Trio, The Living End, 1200 Techniques, and The Butterfly Effect on the line-up, as well as classic Australian band The Church. However, it happened that another festival, the &quot;Falls Festival&quot;, was announced at Marion Bay for New Year&#x27;s Eve - less than two weeks later. The Falls Festival had a much bigger and wide ranging line-up, as well as being in the south of the state. Sales for &quot;Gone South&quot; tickets were again very slow, and the event finally went ahead with as few as 7000 tickets sold. By comparison, the &quot;Falls Festival&quot; for that year sold around 10,000 tickets.

<text>Bethel College is a private Christian college in North Newton, Kansas, United States. It is affiliated with Mennonite Church USA.

==History==
Bethel College, founded in 1887, is the oldest Mennonite college in North America. Bethel College became the second institution of higher learning associated with the General Conference Mennonite Church (now Mennonite Church USA), replacing Wadsworth Institute in Ohio, which had closed in 1878.

During the 1880s, Kansas cities and towns competed with one another to create and construct institutions and buildings, including colleges. On May 11, 1887, representatives of Newton and the Kansas Conference of Mennonites signed a charter for Bethel College to be built on a plot of about north of the town of Newton. Around 2,500 people gathered on the property on October 12, 1888, to lay the cornerstone of the main building, which serves as the current Administration Building and has been on the National Register of Historic Places since 1972. 

The building project took around five years to complete. Fundraising was slow, but on September 20, 1893, a service of dedication opened the building, and classes began.

Cornelius H. Wedel, a young teacher from Halstead, Kan., was the college&#x27;s first president. There were 98 students – 77 men and 21 women ages 13 to mid-30s – living on the west end of the main floor and the ground floor of the Ad Building, while Wedel and his family lived on the east end of the main floor. The classrooms, chapel and library of 600 volumes were located on the second floor.

In those days, students were up by 5 a.m. and in bed by 10 p.m. Each worked two hours a day at a campus job. Student conduct was strictly monitored. Men and women were not allowed to be in the library on the same evening, so they alternated evenings.

Five men, including President Wedel, made up the first faculty. They taught classes in Bible, church history, German, English, mathematics, science and music. Bethel was a bilingual college until early 1918, when the United States entered World War I. German was removed from the curriculum, but later reinstated and remained as a major until 2006, when it switched to a minor.

==Campus facilities==
The Ad Building was the main campus structure until 1925, when Science Hall was completed. The cornerstone for Memorial Hall was laid in 1938 to commemorate the 50th anniversary of the laying of the Ad Building cornerstone. &quot;Mem Hall&quot; was completed in 1942. Various other buildings have come and gone since the Ad Building went up, but of those still remaining, the next to be built after Mem Hall was the current Franz Art Center, in 1947 – originally the general shop, home of the industrial arts department and the shop for the Bethel College farm, and now the home of the Department of Visual Arts and Design. The library finally moved into its own building in 1952 – today this is the Mennonite Library and Archives. Bethel College Mennonite Church, founded in 1897, met in the Ad Building chapel for almost 60 years, until its current building south of the main campus was completed in 1956.

The 1960s and 1970s saw a building boom on the Bethel campus, beginning in 1958 with construction of Haury Hall as a student residence, with a major addition in 1963. Warkentin Court (student residence) and the Fine Arts Center were both completed in 1966, Thresher Gym in 1978 and Schultz Student Center and cafeteria in 1979. In 1986, Mantz Library was built on to the old library, and Kauffman Museum got its current building. The newest buildings on campus are Voth Hall (student residence; 2000) and Krehbiel Science Center (2002); the newest structure is Thresher Stadium in the Thresher Sports Complex (2005). The old Science Hall underwent a multi-million-dollar renovation – completed in 2012, including a major addition on the east side – into the James A. Will Family Academic Center.

Luyken Fine Arts Center includes Krehbiel Auditorium, and the Prairie Sky Stage outdoors, for stage performances, lectures and events, and the Robert W. Regier Art Gallery, which hosts exhibits by local, regional, national and international artists, including Bethel alumni, in all types of media. It houses the music, drama and communication arts departments.

== Organization and administration ==
Jon C. Gering, Ph.D., was inaugurated as Bethel&#x27;s 15th president on October 7, 2018, and appointed to a second term in July 2021.

== Academics ==
Bethel&#x27;s curriculum is founded on a general education program in the liberal arts and sciences, and is geared toward students of moderate to high academic ability. There are requirements for the study of religion, and a cross-cultural experience. The college offers majors in the traditional liberal arts disciplines and selected career areas – with the newest majors being software development, and biochemistry and molecular biology – and accredited professional programs in nursing, social work and teacher education.

== Athletics ==
The Bethel athletic teams are called the Threshers. The college is a member of the National Association of Intercollegiate Athletics (NAIA), primarily competing in the Kansas Collegiate Athletic Conference (KCAC) since the 1939–40 academic year; which they were a member on a previous stint from 1902–03 to December 1928 (of the 1928–29 school year).

Bethel competes in 17 intercollegiate varsity sports: Men&#x27;s sports include basketball, cross country, football, golf, soccer, tennis and track and field; while women&#x27;s sports include basketball, cross country, flag football (added in fall 2022), soccer, softball, tennis, track and field and volleyball; and co-ed sports include cheerleading and dance.

===Mascot===
The mascot is a threshing stone, based on a piece of farm equipment that the Mennonites who moved to the Great Plains of the United States and Canada in the late 1800s used briefly (just before the invention and near-universal adoption of the mechanical threshing machine) for threshing their wheat crops.

In 2022, a new mascot, &quot;Threshy,&quot; was revealed during the college&#x27;s Fall Festival homecoming game. The mascot incorporated Bethel&#x27;s threshing stone logos and styles on the character&#x27;s head, arms, and shoulder, and was covered in the college&#x27;s iconic maroon and gray.

<doc id="844169" wikidata="Q1146667" url="?curid=844169" title="Lada Kalina">
<text>The Lada Kalina () is a supermini car produced by the Russian manufacturer Lada (&quot;AvtoVAZ&quot;) from 18 November 2004 to July 2018. The name &quot;Kalina&quot; comes from the Russian name for a type of viburnum. It is also marketed as the Lada 117/119 in Finland.

The works on Lada Kalina started in 1993. In 1998 the projected vehicle was named &quot;Lada-Kalina&quot;. Prototypes were presented in 1999 (hatchback), 2000 (sedan) and 2001 (combi).

==First generation==

Production of the Kalina began with a four-door sedan in 2005, a five-door hatchback being released in 2006 and a station wagon released in 2007. The hot-dip galvanized steel with enhanced corrosion resistance used in the production of this car was specially developed by a number of Russian steel producers.

The first generation Kalina scored 5.6 points out of 16 in a frontal crash test conducted by the Russian ARCAP safety assessment program in 2005, and was awarded one star out of four.

The Kalina is exported to most Western European markets with a price of about €7,000–8,000. It offers driver and passenger airbags, ABS, electric power steering, air conditioning and rear seats that can be folded so that a horizontal platform is formed.

There are three inline-four gasoline engine options, ranging from 81 to 98 hp (60 to 72 kW): a 1.4-litre 16-valve (91 hp; 67 kW), a 1.6-litre 8-valve (81 hp; 60 kW) and a 1.6-litre 16-valve (98 hp; 72 kW).

Its trade name is Kalina in most countries, but in Finland, where &quot;kalina&quot; means rattle or clatter, the car is marketed as the Lada 119. Its main competitors were low priced cars like the Dacia Logan and Hyundai Accent.

A sportier version, the Kalina &quot;GS Sport&quot;, is also produced. The Super 1600 concept car, used a turbocharged 1.6 petrol engine derived from the naturally aspirated standard model.

A Lada Kalina was used as the &quot;Reasonably-Priced Car&quot; in the &quot;Top Gear Russia&quot; television series. It was the fourth most popular car in Russia in 2009, debuting with 60,746 sales nationally, and ranked first in 2012.

=== Lada El Lada ===
The electric car Lada El Lada was introduced in 2011. This was a Lada Kalina station wagon with the 30 kW electric motor powered by the 23 kWh battery pack. Only 100 electric Ladas were produced.


==Second generation==
The second generation of the Kalina was revealed at the 2012 Moscow International Automobile Salon. It is basically a facelifted first generation, albeit with a slightly extended wheelbase and length, 13- or 14-inch wheel discs, electronic throttle control and now produced only in hatchback and wagon form. All interior controls are now in English only, just like in the recently introduced Lux models of the Lada Granta. The Kalina was used as the basis for the Japanese Datsun mi-DO, which is produced specifically for the Russian market.

It is powered by a range of two 1.6-litre petrol engines, with 8 and 16-valve respectively, developing and of torque.

The hatchback entered production in May 2013, followed by the station wagon later in September. A sport version was also available in the Russian market.

Lada Kalina Cross wagon debuted in 2014. The car differs with increased 20 mm road clearance, the altered gear ratios in transmission and the plastic body kit.

<doc id="844170" wikidata="Q74381" url="?curid=844170" title="Blue-backed manakin">
<text>The blue-backed manakin (Chiroxiphia pareola) is a small passerine bird which breeds in tropical South America, its range extending from Colombia and Tobago to southeastern Brazil. It is found in deciduous forests but not evergreen rainforests. It is a small, plump bird about long. Males have black plumage with a bright blue back and a red or yellow crown. Females and juveniles are olive-green with paler underparts. At breeding time, males are involved in a cooperative lekking behaviour during which they jump and twirl. This is a fairly common species with a wide range, and the International Union for Conservation of Nature has rated its conservation status as being of &quot;least concern&quot;.

==Distribution and habitat==
It is found in southern Colombia, eastern Venezuela, the Guyanas, northeast Brazil, the Amazon Basin in Brazil, Bolivia, Ecuador and Peru; and in Tobago. A disjunct population exists on the coastal strip of southeast Brazil, about 3000 km long. The blue-backed manakin is absent in the northwest Amazon Basin, a region from central Venezuela to the southern border of Colombia. This manakin is a fairly common bird of dry and moist deciduous forests, but not rainforest.

==Description==
Like other manakins, the blue-backed manakin is a compact, brightly coloured forest bird, typically 13 cm long and weighing 19 g. The male is mainly black with a bright blue back, and pale orange legs. The crown is typically red, but yellow in &quot;C. pareola regina&quot; from the south-west Amazon.

The female has olive-green upperparts, and somewhat paler olive underparts. Young males are olive, but show a red cap and the start of a blue back as they mature.

The race endemic to Tobago, &quot;C. p. atlantica&quot; is larger and has more extensive red on the crown and blue on the back. It has been suggested that it represents a separate species, the Tobago manakin, but no major authorities recognize this today.

This species is similar to lance-tailed manakin, &quot;Chiroxiphia lanceolata&quot;, which breeds further north from northern Venezuela to Costa Rica, but the latter has elongated central tail feathers, and the male has a somewhat brighter blue back.

==Ecology==
The male blue-backed manakin has a fascinating breeding display, unusual in that it is a &quot;cooperative display&quot; rather than &quot;competitive&quot;. Two males perch next to each other on a bare stick and jump up and down alternately, giving a buzzing call. When a female approaches, the perched bird moves backwards under the jumping bird, so the two perform a vertical circling movement. Groups of up to eight birds may perform together, with a different stick for each pair of displaying males. The female builds a twig nest in a tree; two brown-mottled white eggs are laid, and incubated entirely by the female for about 20 days.

Apart from the buzzing display song, blue-backed manakin has a number of other calls, including a &quot;whee-whee-CHUP&quot;, sometimes given by two male in synchrony.

These manakins eat fruit and some insects.

==Status==
This bird has a very wide range, is fairly common and is presumed to have a large total population. The population trend is thought to be stable and the International Union for Conservation of Nature has rated the bird&#x27;s conservation status as being of &quot;least concern&quot;.

<doc id="844178" wikidata="Q467613" url="?curid=844178" title="Ikkyū">
<text>was an eccentric, iconoclastic Japanese Zen Buddhist monk and poet. He had a great impact on the infusion of Japanese art and literature with Zen attitudes and ideals. He is perhaps best known for his radical approach to Zen, which included breaking Buddhist monastic precepts and his stance against celibacy.

==Biography==

===Childhood===
Ikkyū was born in 1394 in a small suburb of Kyoto. It is generally held that he was the son of Emperor Go-Komatsu and a low-ranking court noblewoman. His mother was forced to flee to Saga, where Ikkyū was raised by servants. At the age of five, Ikkyū was separated from his mother and placed in a Rinzai Zen temple in Kyoto called Ankoku-ji, as an acolyte. The temple masters taught Chinese culture and language as part of the curriculum, a method termed . He was given the name Shuken, and learned about Chinese poetry, art and literature.

===Training and enlightenment===
When Ikkyū turned thirteen he entered Kennin-ji in Kyoto to study Zen under a well known priest by the name of Botetsu. Here Ikkyū began to write poetry frequently that was non-traditional in form. He was openly critical of Kennin-ji&#x27;s leadership in his poetry, disheartened with the social stratum and lack of practice he saw around him. In 1410, at the age of sixteen, Ikkyū left Kennin-ji and entered the temple Mibu-dera, where an abbot named Seiso was in residence. He did not stay long, and soon found himself at Saikin-ji in the Lake Biwa region where he was the sole student of an abbot named Ken&#x27;o. It seemed Ikkyū had finally found a master that taught true as Ikkyū saw it. Ken&#x27;o was sporadic in his teaching style and was a strong believer in the supremacy of . In 1414, when Ikkyū was 21, Ken&#x27;o died. Ikkyū performed funeral rites and fasted for seven days. In despair Ikkyū tried to kill himself by drowning himself in Lake Biwa, but was talked out of it from the shore by a servant of his mother.

Ikkyū soon found a new teacher in a master named Kaso at Zenko-an, a branch temple of Daitoku-ji. Kaso was much like Ken&#x27;o in his style. For years he worked hard on assigned and made dolls for a local merchant in Kyoto. In 1418 Ikkyū was given Case 15 of the , (&quot;The Gateless Gate&quot;, a famous set of 49 ), known as &quot;Tozan&#x27;s Three (or 60?) Blows&quot;, which depicts Tozan becoming enlightened when Ummon rebukes him for wandering from one monastery to another. One day a band of blind singers performed at the temple and Ikkyū penetrated his while engrossed in the music. In recognition of his understanding Kaso gave Shuken the Dharma name Ikkyū, which roughly means &#x27;One Pause&#x27;. 

In 1420, Ikkyū was meditating in a boat on Lake Biwa when the sound of a crow sparked . When Ikkyū told Kasō of his experience, Kasō replied, &quot;This is the enlightenment of a mere arhat, you’re no master yet.&quot; To this, Ikkyū responded, &quot;Then I’m happy to be an arhat, I detest masters.&quot; Thus, Kasō declared, &quot;Ha, now you really are a master.&quot; Kasō confirmed Ikkyū&#x27;s great enlightenment and granted him . However, when presented with his inka, Ikkyū threw it to the ground and stomped off. Kasō retained the inka for safekeeping, but when Ikkyū learned of this, he tore it to pieces. Later, when his disciples had it pieced back together, Ikkyū burned it completely. 

Ikkyū came up against the jealousy of Yoso, a more senior student who eventually came to run the monastery. In Ikkyū&#x27;s poems, Yoso appears as a character unhealthily obsessed with material goods, who sold Zen to increase the prosperity of the temple.

===Vagabond===
Ikkyū could sometimes be a troublemaker. Known to drink in excess, he would often upset Kaso with his remarks and actions to guests. In response, Kaso gave to Yoso and made him Dharma heir. Ikkyū quickly left the temple and lived many years as a vagabond. He was not alone, however, as he had a regular circle of notable artists and poets from that era. Around this time, he established a sexual relationship with a blind singer, Mori, who became the love of his later life.

Ikkyū strove to live Zen outside of formal religious institutions. However, the Ōnin War had reduced Daitokuji to ashes, and Ikkyū was elected to be its abbot late in life, a role he reluctantly took on. This firmly placed him at the head of one of the most important Zen institutions. However, Ikkyū refused to give formal sanction to any of his disciples, stating his intent thus: “I have never given inka to anyone. . . . So if after I’m gone, someone comes claiming to have my inka, you should report him to the authorities and prosecute for criminal misconduct. That’s why I’m telling everyone the facts by way of a written testament.” Toward the end of his life, Ikkyū told his disciples:

After my death some of you will seclude yourselves in the forests and mountains to meditate, while others may drink saké and enjoy the company of women. Both kinds of Zen are fine, but if some become professional clerics, babbling about &#x27;Zen as the way,&#x27; they are my enemies. I have never given an inka, and if anyone claims to have received such a thing from me, have him or her arrested!

In 1481, Ikkyū died at the age of 87 from acute ague.

==Non-celibacy==
Ikkyū felt a close connection with the Chinese Chan master, Linji, for whom everyday ordinary activities expressed the buddha-nature. Linji said, &quot;Shit and piss and just be human; when hungry, eat; when tired, sleep; make yourself the master of every situation!&quot; According to Yanagida, this represents a recognition of the &quot;fundamental value of the human being.&quot; Ikkyū was inspired by such an attitude, taking it to include sexual needs as well. &quot;If you are thirsty,&quot; Ikkyū said, &quot;you dream of water; if you are cold, you dream of a warm coat; as for me, I dream of the pleasures of the boudoir—that&#x27;s my nature!&quot; 

For Ikkyū, sex was a form of spiritual practice. He regarded sex in light of the nonduality of desire and bodhi, and it also served as a means for him to test his own sense of enlightenment as well. According to John Stevens, &quot;For Ikkyū, the passions were the anvil on which true enlightenment is forged.&quot; As such, Ikkyū wrote that sex was better than sitting in meditation and working on koans:Rinzai&#x27;s disciples never got the Zen message,But I, the Blind Donkey, know the truth:Love play can make you immortal.The autumn breeze of a single night of love is better than a hundred thousand years of sterile sitting meditation . . .Stilted koans and convoluted answers are all monks have,Pandering endlessly to officials and rich patrons.Good friends of the Dharma, so proud, let me tell you,A brothel girl in gold brocade is worth more than any of you.

Ikkyū also came to embrace the view found in Esoteric Buddhism that the real Buddha is none other than one&#x27;s own body. Thus, when he practiced Zen, he practiced with the body as well as the mind. Such a tantric attitude, which draws on the language of alchemy, can be seen in the following:A sex-loving monk, you object!Hot-blooded and passionate, totally aroused.But then lust can exhaust all passion,Turning base metal into pure gold.The lotus flowerIs not stained by the mud;This dewdrop form,Alone, just as it is,Manifests the real body of truth.

==Legacy==
Ikkyū is one of the most significant (and eccentric) figures in Zen history. To Japanese children, he is a folk hero, mischievous and always outsmarting his teachers and the . In addition to passed down oral stories, this is due to the very popular animated TV series .

In Rinzai Zen tradition, he is both heretic and saint. He was among the few Zen priests who addressed the subject of sexuality from a religious context, and he stood out for arguing that enlightenment was deepened by partaking in love and sex, including lovers, prostitutes and monastic homosexuality. He believed that sex was part of the human nature, and therefore purer than hypocritical organizations and worldly pursuits. At the same time, he warned Zen against its own bureaucratic politicising.

Usually he is referred to as one of the main influences on the Fuke sect of Rinzai zen, as he is one of the most famous flute player mendicants of the medieval times of Japan. The piece &quot;Murasaki Reibo&quot; is attributed to him. He is credited as one of the great influences on the Japanese tea ceremony, and renowned as one of medieval Japan&#x27;s greatest calligraphers and artists.

Ikkyū wrote in -style classical Chinese, which was employed by many contemporary Japanese authors. For instance, the &quot;Calling My Hand Mori&#x27;s Hand&quot; poem.
Ikkyū is also connected with a Hell Courtesan, who became his disciple.

<doc id="844184" wikidata="Q550691" url="?curid=844184" title="Malwa">
<text>Malwa is a historical region of west-central India occupying a plateau of volcanic origin. Geologically, the Malwa Plateau generally refers to the volcanic upland north of the Vindhya Range. Politically and administratively, it is also synonymous with the former state of Madhya Bharat which was later merged with Madhya Pradesh. At present the historical Malwa region includes districts of western Madhya Pradesh and parts of south-eastern Rajasthan. Sometimes the definition of Malwa is extended to include the Nimar region south of the Vindhyas.

The Malwa region had been a separate political unit from the time of the ancient Malava Kingdom. It has been ruled by several kingdoms and dynasties, including the Avanti Kingdom, The Mauryans, the Malavas, the Guptas, the Paramaras, The Rajputs, the Delhi Sultanate, the Malwa sultans, the Mughals and the Marathas. Malwa continued to be an administrative division until 1947, when the Malwa Agency of British India was merged into Madhya Bharat (also known as Malwa Union) state of independent India.

Although its political borders have fluctuated throughout history, the region has developed its own distinct culture, influenced by the Rajasthani, Marathi and Gujarati cultures. Several prominent people in the history of India have lived in Malwa, including the poet and dramatist Kalidasa, the author Bhartrihari, the mathematicians and astronomers Varahamihira and Brahmagupta, and the polymath king Bhoja. Ujjain had been the political, economic, and cultural capital of the region in ancient times, and Indore is now the largest city and commercial center.

Overall, agriculture is the main occupation of the people of Malwa. The region has been one of the important producers of opium in the world. Wheat and soybeans are other important cash crops, and textiles are a major industry.

Malwi is a demonym given to people from the Malwa region.

== History ==
Several early Stone Age or Lower Paleolithic habitations have been excavated in eastern Malwa. The name &quot;Malwa&quot; is derived from the name of the ancient Indian tribe of &quot;Malavas&quot;. The name &quot;Malava&quot; is said to be derived from the Sanskrit term &quot;Malav&quot;, which means &quot;part of the abode of &quot;Lakshmi&quot;&quot;. The location of the Malwa or &quot;Moholo&quot;, mentioned by the 7th-century Chinese traveller Xuanzang, is plausibly identified with present-day Gujarat. The region is cited as &quot;Malibah&quot; in Arabic records, such as &quot;Kamilu-t Tawarikh&quot; by Ibn Asir.

The Malwa Culture was a Chalcolithic archaeological culture which existed in the Malwa region, as well as nearby parts of Maharashtra to the south, during the 2nd millennium BCE.

Ujjain, also known historically as &quot;Ujjaiyini&quot; and &quot;Avanti&quot;, emerged as the first major centre in the Malwa region during India&#x27;s second wave of urbanisation in the 7th century BC (the first wave was the Indus Valley Civilization). Around 600 BC an earthen rampart was built around Ujjain, enclosing a city of considerable size. Ujjain was the capital city of the Avanti kingdom, one of the prominent mahajanapadas of ancient India. In the post-Mahabharata period—around 500 BC—Avanti was an important kingdom in western India; it was ruled by the Haihayas, a people who were responsible for the destruction of Naga power in western India.

The region was conquered by the Nanda Empire in the mid-4th century BC, and subsequently became part of the Maurya Empire. Ashoka, who was later a Mauryan emperor, was governor of Ujjain in his youth. After the death of Ashoka in 232 BC, the Maurya Empire began to collapse. Although evidence is sparse, Malwa was probably ruled by the Kushanas, the Shakas and the Satavahana dynasty during the 1st and 2nd century CE. Ownership of the region was the subject of dispute between the Western Kshatrapas and the Satavahanas during the first three centuries AD. Ujjain emerged a major trading centre during the 1st century AD.
Malwa became part of the Gupta Empire during the reign of Chandragupta II (375–413), also known as &quot;Vikramaditya&quot;, who conquered the region, driving out the Western Kshatrapas. The Gupta period is widely regarded as a golden age in the history of Malwa, when Ujjain served as the empire&#x27;s western capital. The astronomer Varahamihira was based in Ujjain, which emerged as a major centre of learning, especially in astronomy and mathematics. Around 500, Malwa re-emerged from the dissolving Gupta Empire as a separate kingdom; in 528, Yasodharman of Malwa defeated the Hunas, who had invaded India from the north-west. 

During the seventh century, the region became part of Harsha&#x27;s empire, who disputed the region with the Chalukya king Pulakesin II of Badami in the Deccan. During his reign the Buddhist pilgrim monk Xuanzang had visited India and mentions seeing a hundred Buddhist monasteries along with a same number of Deva temples of different kinds with the adherents of Pashupata Shaivism making a majority. He also states that there were two places in India that were remarkable for the great learning of the people, viz., Malwa and Magadha. The people there esteemed virtue, were of an intelligent mind and exceedingly studious.

In 756 AD Gurjara-Pratiharas advanced into Malwa. In 786 the region was captured by the Rashtrakuta kings of the Deccan, and was disputed between the Rashtrakutas and the Gurjara Pratihara kings of Kannauj until the early part of the tenth century. The Emperors of the Rashtrakuta dynasty appointed the Paramara rulers as governors of Malwa. From the mid-tenth century, Kingdom of Malwa was ruled by the Paramaras, who established a capital at Dhar. King Bhoja, who ruled from about 1010 to 1060, was known as the great polymath philosopher-king of medieval India; his extensive writings cover philosophy, poetry, medicine, architecture, construction, town planning, veterinary science, phonetics, yoga, and archery. Malwa became an intellectual centre of India, and became home to a major astronomical observatory, attracting scholars from all over India including Bhāskara II. His successors ruled until about 1305, when Malwa was conquered by the Delhi Sultanate. Malwa was several times invaded by the south Indian Western Chalukya Empire.

Dilawar Khan, previously Malwa&#x27;s governor under the rule of the Delhi sultanate, declared himself sultan of Malwa in 1401 after the Mughal conqueror Timur attacked Delhi, causing the break-up of the sultanate into smaller states. Khan started the &quot;Malwa Sultanate&quot; and established a capital at Mandu, high in the Vindhya Range overlooking the Narmada River valley. His son and successor, Hoshang Shah (1405–35), developed Mandu as an important city. Hoshang Shah&#x27;s son, Ghazni Khan, ruled for only a year and was succeeded by Mahmud Khalji (1436–69), the first of the Khalji sultans of Malwa, who expanded the state to include parts of Gujarat, Rajasthan, and the Deccan. The Muslim sultans invited the Rajputs to settle in the country. In the early 16th century, the sultan sought the aid of the sultans of Gujarat to counter the growing power of the Rajputs, while the Rajputs sought the support of the Sesodia Rajput kings of Mewar.During that time Much of the Malwa was conquered by Rana Sanga of Mewar who appointed one of his close allies Medini Rai as ruler of Malwa under his lordship. Chanderi was capital of his kingdom.After the defeat of Rajput confederation in Battle of Khanwa near Agra against Babur which was fought for Supremacy of Northern India between Rajputs and Mughals.Babur then sieged Chanderi offering Shamsabad to Medini rai instead of Chanderi as it was the capital of his kingdom and was of great importance but Rai refused Babur&#x27;s offer and chose to die. He was defeated by Babur in January 1528 at Battle of Chanderi and Babur conquered the fort.

Gujarat stormed Mandu in 1518. In 1531, Bahadur Shah of Gujarat, captured Mandu, executed Mahmud II (1511–31), and shortly after that, the Malwa sultanate collapsed. The Mughal emperor Akbar captured Malwa in 1562 and made it a subah (province) of his empire. The Malwa Subah existed from 1568 to 1743. Mandu was abandoned by the 17th century. During the 17th century much of Western Malwa was held by the Rathors of the Ratanawat branch. The Ratanawats later broke into several states which later became Ratlam State, Sitamau State and Sailana State. Some of the lesser states were Multhan and Kachi-Baroda.
As the Mughal state weakened after 1700, the Marathas held sway over Malwa under leadership of Chimnaji Appa, Nemaji Shinde and Chimnaji Damodar were the first Maratha generals to cross the boundary of Maharashtra and to invade in Malwa in 1698. Subsequently, Malhar Rao Holkar (1694–1766) became leader of Maratha armies in Malwa in 1724, and in 1733 the Maratha Peshwa granted him control of most of the region, which was formally ceded by the Mughals in 1738. Ranoji Scindia, noted Maratha commander, established his headquarters at Ujjain in 1721.. This capital was later moved to Gwalior State by Daulatrao Scindia. Another Maratha general, Anand Rao Pawar, established himself as the Raja of Dhar in 1742, and the two Pawar brothers became Rajas of Dewas State.

At the end of the 18th century, Malwa became the venue of fighting between the rival Maratha powers and the headquarters of the Pindaris, who were irregular plunderers. The Pindaris were rooted out in a campaign by the British general Lord Hastings, and further order was established under Sir John Malcolm. The Holkar dynasty ruled Malwa from Indore and Maheshwar on the Narmada until 1818, when the Marathas were defeated by the British in the Third Anglo-Maratha War, and the Holkars of Indore became a princely state of the British Raj.

After 1818 the British organised the numerous princely states of central India into the Central India Agency; the Malwa Agency was a division of Central India, with an area of and a population of 1,054,753 in 1901. It comprised the states of Dewas State (senior and junior branch), Jaora, Ratlam, Sitamau and Sailana, together with a large part of Gwalior, parts of Indore and Tonk, and about 35 small estates and holdings. Political power was exercised from Neemuch.

Upon Indian independence in 1947, the Holkars and other princely rulers acceded to India, and most of Malwa became part of the new state of Madhya Bharat, which was merged into Madhya Pradesh in 1956.

== Geography ==

The Malwa region occupies a plateau in western Madhya Pradesh and south-eastern Rajasthan (between and ), with Gujarat in the west. The region includes the Madhya Pradesh districts of Agar, Dewas, Dhar, Indore, Jhabua, Mandsaur, Neemuch, Rajgarh, Ratlam, Shajapur, Ujjain, and parts of Guna and Sehore, and the Rajasthan districts of Jhalawar and parts of Kota, Banswara and Pratapgarh.

Malwa is bounded in the north-east by the Hadoti region, in the north-west by the Mewar region, in the west by the Vagad region and Gujarat. To the south and east is the Vindhya Range and to the north is the Bundelkhand upland. 

The plateau is an extension of the Deccan Traps, formed between 60 and 68 million years ago at the end of the Cretaceous period. In this region the main classes of soil are black, brown and &quot;bhatori&quot; (stony) soil. The volcanic, clay-like soil of the region owes its black colour to the high iron content of the basalt from which it formed. The soil requires less irrigation because of its high capacity for moisture retention. The other two soil types are lighter and have a higher proportion of sand.

The average elevation of the plateau is 500 m. Some of the peaks over 800 m high are at Sigar (881 m), Janapav (854 m) and Ghajari (810 m). The plateau generally slopes towards the north. The western part of the region is drained by the Mahi River, while the Chambal River drains the central part, and the Betwa River and the headwaters of the Dhasan and Ken rivers drain the east. The Shipra River is of historical importance because of the Simhasth mela, held every 12 years. Other notable rivers are Parbati, Gambhir and Choti Kali Sindh.

Due to its altitude of about 550 to 600 meters above mean sea level, the region has comparatively cool evenings against the hot days during the summer season. Even if the day temperature reaches 42 to 43 degrees Celsius, the night temperatures are always in range of 20 to 22 degrees making the climate much cooler than the other areas of the region. The cool morning wind, the &quot;karaman&quot;, and an evening breeze, the &quot;&quot;, make the summers less harsh. The term &quot;Shab-e-Malwa&quot;, meaning dusk in Malwa (from &quot;shab&quot;, Urdu for night), was introduced by the Mughals.
The year is popularly divided into three seasons: summer, the rains, and winter. Summer extends over the months of Chaitra to Jyestha (mid-March to mid-May). The average maximum temperature during the summer months is 37 °C, which typically rises to around 40 °C on a few days. The rainy season starts with the first showers of Aashaadha (mid-June) and extends to the middle of Ashvin (September). Most of the rain falls during the southwest monsoon spell, and ranges from about 80 cm in the west to about 10.5 cm in the east. Indore and the immediately surrounding areas receive an average of 90 cm of rainfall a year. The growing period lasts from 90 to 150 days, during which the average daily temperature is below 30 °C, but seldom falls below 20 °C. Winter is the longest of the three seasons, extending for about five months (mid-Ashvin to Phalgun, i.e., October to mid-March). The average daily minimum temperature ranges from 6 °C to 9 °C, though on some nights it can fall as low as 3 °C. Some cultivators believe that an occasional winter shower during the months of Pausha and Maagha—known as Mawta—is helpful to the early summer wheat and germ crops.
The region is part of the Khathiar-Gir dry deciduous forests ecoregion, Narmada valley dry deciduous forests, and Eastern Highlands moist deciduous forests.

Vegetation: The natural vegetation is tropical dry forest, with scattered teak &quot;(Tectona grandis)&quot; forests. The main trees are &quot;Butea&quot;, &quot;Bombax&quot;, &quot;Anogeissus&quot;, &quot;Acacia&quot;, &quot;Buchanania&quot; and &quot;Boswellia&quot;. The shrubs or small trees include species of &quot;Grewia&quot;, Ziziphus mauritiana, Casearia, Prosopis, Capparis, Woodfordia, &quot;Phyllanthus,&quot; and &quot;Carissa&quot;.

Wildlife: Sambhar &quot;(Cervus unicolor)&quot;, Blackbuck &quot;(Antilope cervicapra)&quot;, and Chinkara &quot;(Gazella bennettii)&quot; are some common ungulates.
During the last century, deforestation has happened at a fast rate, leading to environmental problems such as acute water scarcity and the danger that the region is being desertified.

== Demographics ==

The population of the Malwa region was 22,773,993 in 2011, with a population density of a moderate 270/km2. The annual birth rate in the region was 31.6 per 1000, and the death rate 10.3. The infant mortality rate was 93.8, slightly higher than the overall rate for the Madhya Pradesh state.

There are numerous tribes in the region, such as the Bhils—and their allied groups, the Meos the Bhilalas, Barelas and Patelias—and the Meenas, who all differ to a remarkable degree from the regional population in their dialects and social life. They encompass a variety of languages and cultures. Some tribes of the region, notably the Kanjars, were notified in the 19th century for their criminal activities, but have since been denotified. A nomadic tribe from the Marwar region of Rajasthan, the Gadia Lohars—who work as &quot;lohars&quot; (blacksmiths)—visit the region at the start of the agricultural season to repair and sell agricultural tools and implements, stopping temporarily on the outskirts of villages and towns and residing in their ornate metal carts. The Kalbelia is another nomadic tribe from Rajasthan that regularly visits the region.

===Religion===

Malwa has a significant number of Dawoodi Bohras, a subsect of Shia Muslims from Gujarat, who are mostly businessmen by profession. Besides speaking the local languages, the Bohras have their own language, Lisan al-Dawat. The Patidars, who Migrated from Gujarat settle in the Malwa-nimar. The Whole Malwa-Nimar belt is dominated by Patidar&#x27;s who are large landowner&#x27;s.

===Languages===

The most spoken language in Malwa region is Malvi which is the regional language and Hindi is spoken in cities. Also, Marathi is spoken considerably in the region of Indore, Dhar, Dewas and Ujjain. A significant number of Marathas, Jats, Rajputs and Banias also live in the region. The Sindhis, who settled in the region after the partition of India, are an important part of the business community. Like southern Rajasthan, the region has a significant number of Jains, who are mostly traders and business people. The region is home to smaller numbers of Goan Catholics, Anglo-Indians, Punjabis and Parsis or Zoroastrians. The Parsis are closely connected to the growth and evolution of Mhow, which has a Parsi fire temple and a Tower of Silence.

== Economy ==

Indore is the commercial capital of Malwa region and Madhya Pradesh as state. Malwa is one of the world&#x27;s major opium producers. This crop resulted in development of close connections between the economies of Malwa, the western Indian ports and China, bringing international capital to the region in the 18th and 19th centuries. Malwa opium was a challenge to the monopoly of the British East India Company, which was supplying Bengal opium to China. This led the British company to impose many restrictions on the production and trade of the drug; eventually, opium trading was pushed underground (see Opium Trading in Mumbai for more information). When smuggling became rife, the British eased the restrictions. Today, the region is one of the largest producers of legal opium in the world. There is a central, government-owned opium and alkaloid factory in the city of Neemuch. Nevertheless, there is a still a significant amount of illicit opium production, which is channelled into the black market. The headquarters of India&#x27;s Central Bureau of Narcotics is in Gwalior. The Rajputana-Malwa Railway was opened in 1876.

The region is predominantly agricultural. The brown soil in parts of the region is particularly suitable for the cultivation of such &quot;unalu&quot; (early summer) crops as wheat, gram (&quot;Cicer arietinum&quot;) and til (&quot;Sesamum indicum&quot;). Relatively poor soil is used for the cultivation of such &quot;syalu&quot; (early winter) crops as millet (&quot;Andropogon sorghum&quot;), maize (&quot;Zea mays&quot;), mung bean (&quot;Vigna radiata&quot;), urad (&quot;Vigna mungo&quot;), batla (&quot;Pisum sativum&quot;) and peanuts (&quot;Arachis hypogaea&quot;). Overall, the main crops are jowar, rice, wheat, coarse millet, peanuts and pulses, soya bean, cotton, linseed, sesame and sugarcane. Sugar mills are located in numerous small towns.

The black, volcanic soil is ideal for the cultivation of cotton, and textile manufacture is an important industry. Large centres of textile production include Indore, Ujjain and Nagda. Maheshwar is known for its fine &quot;Maheshwari&quot; saris, and Mandsaur for its coarse woollen blankets. Handicrafts are an important source of income for the tribal population. Coloured lacquerware from Ratlam, rag dolls from Indore, and papier-mâché articles from Indore, Ujjain and several other centres are well known.

Mandsaur district is the sole producer in India of white- and red-coloured slate, used in the district&#x27;s 110 slate pencil factories. There is a cement factory in Neemuch. Apart from this, the region lacks mineral resources. The region&#x27;s industries mainly produce consumer goods—but there are now many centres of large- and medium-scale industries, including Indore, Nagda and Ujjain. Indore has a large-scale factory that produces diesel engines. Pithampur, an industrial town 25 km from Indore, is known as the Detroit of India for its heavy concentration of automotive industry. Indore is recognised as the commercial capital of Madhya Pradesh, and is the main centre for trade in textiles and agro-based products. It has one of the six Indian Institutes of Management and one of sixteen Indian Institute of Technology.

== Culture ==

The culture of Malwa has been significantly influenced by Gujarati and Rajasthani culture, because of their geographic proximity. Marathi influence is also visible, because of recent rule by the Marathas.

The main language of Malwa is Malvi, although Hindi is widely spoken in the cities. This Indo-European language is subclassified as Indo-Aryan. The language is sometimes referred to as Malavi or Ujjaini. Malvi is part of the Rajasthani branch of languages; Nimadi is spoken in the Nimar region of Madhya Pradesh and in Rajasthan. The dialects of Malvi are, in alphabetical order, Bachadi, Pawari/Bhoyari in Betul, Chhindwara, Pandhurna and Wardha districts. Dholewari, Hoshangabadi, Jamral, Katiyai, Malvi Proper, Patvi, Rangari, Rangri and Sondwari. A survey in 2001 found only five dialects: Ujjaini (in the districts of Ujjain, Indore, Dewas, Dhar, Agar Malwa and Sehore), Rajawari (Ratlam, Mandsaur and Neemuch), Umathwari (Rajgarh) and Sondhwari (Jhalawar) and Bhoyari/Pawari (in the districts of Betul, Chhindwara, Pandhurna and Wardha). About 55% of the population of Malwa can converse in and about 40% of the population is literate in Hindi, the official language of the Madhya Pradesh state.

Traditional Malwa food has elements of Rajasthani, Gujarati and Maharashtrian cuisine. Traditionally, jowar was the staple cereal, but after the Green Revolution in India, wheat has replaced jowar as the most important food crop; many are vegetarians. Since the climate is mostly dry throughout the year, most people rely on stored foods such as pulses, and green vegetables are rare. A typical snack of Malwa is the &quot;bhutta ri kees&quot; (made with grated corn roasted in ghee and later cooked in milk with spices). &quot;Chakki ri shaak&quot; is made of wheat dough, which is washed under running water, steamed and then used in a gravy of curd. The traditional bread of Malwa is called &quot;baati/bafla&quot;, which is essentially a small, round ball of wheat flour, roasted over dung cakes, in the traditional way. &quot;Baati&quot; is typically eaten with dal (pulses), while &quot;baflas&quot; are dripping with ghee and soaked with dal. The &quot;amli ri kadhi&quot; is &quot;kadhi&quot; made with tamarind instead of yogurt. Sweet cakes, made of a variety of wheat called &quot;tapu&quot;, are prepared during religious festivities. Sweet cereal called &quot;thulli&quot; is also typically eaten with milk or yoghurt. Traditional desserts include &quot;mawa-bati&quot; (milk-based sweet similar to Gulab jamun), &quot;khoprapak&quot; (coconut-based sweet), &quot;shreekhand&quot; (yogurt based) and &quot;malpua&quot;.

&quot;Lavani&quot; is a widely practised form of folk music in southern Malwa, which was brought to the region by the Marathas. The &quot;Nirguni Lavani&quot; (philosophical) and the &quot;Shringari Lavani&quot; (erotic) are two of the main genres. The Bhils have their own folk songs, which are always accompanied by dance. The folk musical modes of Malwa are of four or five notes, and in rare cases six. The devotional music of the &quot;Nirguni&quot; cult is popular throughout Malwa. Legends of &quot;Raja&quot; Bhoj and &quot;Bijori&quot;, the &quot;Kanjar&quot; girl, and the tale of &quot;Balabau&quot; are popular themes for folk songs. Insertions known as &quot;stobha&quot; are commonly used in Malwa music; this can occur in four ways: the &quot;matra stobha&quot; (syllable insertion), &quot;varna stobha&quot; (letter insertion), &quot;shabda stobha&quot; (word insertion) and &quot;vakya stobha&quot; (sentence insertion).

Malwa was the centre of Sanskrit literature during and after the Gupta period. The region&#x27;s most famous playwright, Kalidasa, is considered to be the greatest Indian writer ever. His first surviving play is &quot;Malavikagnimitra&quot; (Malavika and Agnimitra). Kalidasa&#x27;s second play, his masterpiece, is the Abhijñānaśākuntalam, which tells the story of king Dushyanta, who falls in love with a girl of lowly birth, the lovely Shakuntala. The last of Kalidasa&#x27;s surviving plays is &quot;Vikramuurvashiiya&quot; (&quot;Urvashi conquered by valour&quot;). Kalidasa also wrote the epic poems &quot;Raghuvamsha&quot; (&quot;Dynasty of Raghu&quot;), &quot;Ritusamhāra&quot; and &quot;Kumarasambhava&quot; (&quot;Birth of the war god&quot;), as well as the lyric &quot;Meghaduuta&quot; (&quot;The cloud messenger&quot;).

&quot;Swang&quot; is a popular dance form in Malwa; its roots go back to the origins of the Indian theatre tradition in the first millennium BC. Since women did not participate in the dance-drama form, men enacted their roles. &quot;Swang&quot; incorporates suitable theatrics and mimicry, accompanied alternately by song and dialogue. The genre is dialogue-oriented rather than movement-oriented.

&quot;Mandana&quot; (literally painting) wall and floor paintings are the best-known painting traditions of Malwa. White drawings stand out in contrast to the base material consisting of a mixture of red clay and cow dung. Peacocks, cats, lions, goojari, bawari, the swastika and chowk are some motifs of this style. &quot;Sanjhya&quot; is a ritual wall painting done by young girls during the annual period when Hindus remember and offer ritual oblation to their ancestors. Malwa miniature paintings are well known for their intricate brushwork. In the 17th century, an offshoot of the Rajasthani school of miniature painting, known as &quot;Malwa painting&quot;, was centred largely in Malwa and Bundelkhand. The school preserved the style of the earliest examples, such as the &quot;Rasikapriya&quot; series dated 1636 (after a poem analysing the love sentiment) and the &quot;Amaru Sataka&quot; (a 17th-century Sanskrit poem). The paintings from this school are flat compositions on black and chocolate-brown backgrounds, with figures shown against a solid colour patch, and architecture painted in vibrant colours.

The biggest festival of Malwa is the &quot;Simhastha mela&quot;, held every 12 years, in which more than 40 million pilgrims take a holy dip in river Shipra. The festival of &quot;Gana-gour&quot; is celebrated in honour of Shiva and Parvati. The history of the festival goes back to &quot;Rano Bai&quot;, whose parental home was in Malwa, but who was married in Rajasthan. Rano Bai was strongly attached to Malwa, and did not want to stay in Rajasthan. After marriage, she was allowed to visit Malwa only once a year; &quot;Gana-gour&quot; symbolises these annual return visits. The festival is observed by women in the region once in the month of &quot;Chaitra&quot; (mid-March) and &quot;Bhadra&quot; (mid-August). The &quot;Ghadlya&quot; (earthen pot) festival is celebrated by the girls of the region, who gather to visit every house in their village in the evenings, carrying earthen pots with holes for the light from oil lamps inside to escape. In front of every house, the girls recite songs connected with the Ghadlya and receive food or money in return. The &quot;Gordhan&quot; festival is celebrated on the 16th day in the month of Kartika. The Bhils of the region sing &quot;Heeda&quot;, anecdotal songs to the cattle, while the women sing the &quot;Chandrawali&quot; song, associated with Krishna&#x27;s romance.

The most popular fairs are held in the months of &quot;Phalguna&quot;, &quot;Chaitra&quot;, &quot;Bhadra&quot;, &quot;Ashvin&quot; and &quot;Kartik&quot;. The &quot;Chaitra&quot; fair, held at Biaora, and the &quot;Gal yatras&quot;, held at more than two dozen villages in Malwa are remarkable. Many fairs are held in the tenth day of the month of &quot;Bhadra&quot; to mark the birth of Tejaji. The &quot;Triveni mela&quot; is held at Ratlam, and other fairs take place in &quot;Kartika&quot; at Ujjain, Mandhata (Nimad), among others.

Muslim community of Malwa is headed by Mufti e Azam Malwa or Grand Mufti of Malwa, who follows Aala Hazrat Imam Ahmed Raza Khan (an important leader of Ahle Sunnat Wal Jamaat). He is considered as the supreme fatwa issuing authority of the region. Mufti Rizwanur-Rahman Faruqi was succeeded by his son in law Mufti Habeeb yar Khan. The current incumbent is Mufti Noorul Haq.

== Tourism ==

The main tourist destinations in Malwa are places of historical or religious significance. The river Shipra and the city of Ujjain have been regarded as sacred for thousands of years. The Mahakal Temple of Ujjain is one of the 12 &quot;jyotirlingas,&quot; literally meaning &quot;“pillars of light&quot;&quot;. Ujjain has over 100 other ancient temples, including &quot;Harsidhhi&quot;, &quot;Chintaman Ganesh&quot;, &quot;Gadh Kalika&quot;, &quot;Kaal Bhairava&quot; and &quot;Mangalnath&quot;. The Kalideh Palace, on the outskirts of the city, is a fine example of ancient Indian architecture. The Bhartrihari caves are associated with interesting legends. Since the fourth century BC, Ujjain has enjoyed the reputation of being India&#x27;s Greenwich,
as the Prime Meridian of the Hindu geographers. The observatory built by Jai Singh II is one of the four such observatories in India and features ancient astronomical devices. The &quot;Simhastha mela&quot;, celebrated every 12 years, starts on the full moon day in Chaitra (April) and continues into Vaishakha (May) until the next full moon day.

Mandu was originally the fort capital of the Parmar rulers. Towards the end of the 13th century, it came under the sway of the Sultans of Malwa, the first of whom named it Shadiabad (city of joy). It remained as the capital, and in it the sultans built exquisite palaces like the Jahaz Mahal and Hindola Mahal, ornamental canals, baths and pavilions. The massive Jami Masjid and Hoshang Shah&#x27;s tomb provided inspiration to the designers of the Taj Mahal centuries later. Baz Bahadur built a huge palace in Mandu in the 16th century. Other notable historical monuments are &quot;Rewa Kund&quot;, Rupmati&#x27;s Pavilion, Nilkanth Mahal, Hathi Mahal, Darya Khan&#x27;s Tomb, Dai ka Mahal, Malik Mughit is Mosque and Jali Mahal.

Close to Mandu is Maheshwar, a town on the northern bank of Narmada River that served as the capital of the Indore state under Ahilyabai Holkar. The Maratha &quot;rajwada&quot; (fort) is the main attraction. A life-size statue of Rani Ahilya sits on a throne within the fort complex. Dhar was the capital of Malwa before Mandu became the capital in 1405. There, the fort is in ruins but offers a panoramic view. The Bhojashala temple (built-in 1400) is still used as a place of worship on Tuesday. Dhar is also a birthplace of Raja Bhoj. Dhar people named as Dharwasi.

Modern Indore was planned and built by Ahilyabai Holkar. The grand Lal Baag Palace is one of its grandest monuments. The &quot;Bada Ganpati&quot; temple houses what is possibly the largest Ganesh idol in the world, measuring 7.6 m from crown to foot. The &quot;Kanch Mandir&quot; is a Jain temple entirely inlaid with glass. The Town Hall was made in 1904 in the indo-gothic style; originally named King Edward Hall, it was renamed Mahatma Gandhi Hall in 1948. The &quot;chhatris&quot; are the tombs or cenotaphs erected in memory of dead Holkar rulers and their family members.

The shrine of Hussain Tekri, built by the Nawab of Jaora, Mohammad Iftikhar Ali Khan Bahadur, in the 19th century, is on the outskirts of Jaora in the Ratlam district. Mohammad Iftikhar Ali Khan Bahadur was buried in the same graveyard where Hussain Tekri was buried. During the month of Moharram, thousands of people from all over the world visit the shrine of Hazrat Imam Hussain there, which is a replica of the Iraqi original. The place is famous for the rituals called &quot;Hajri&quot; to cure mental illness.

== Sports ==

Cricket is one of the most popular sports in the region. Indore is also home to the Madhya Pradesh Cricket Association. The city has two international cricket ground, the Holkar Cricket Stadium. The first cricket ODI match in state was played in Indore at Nehru Stadium, Indore.

==Demands for statehood==

There have been demands for a separate Malwa state with the probable capital at Indore. The region includes the Madhya Pradesh districts of Dewas, Mandsaur, Neemuch, Ratlam, Shajapur, Agar, Ujjain, Indore, Barwani, Burhanpur, Dhar, Jhabua, Khandwa, Khargone, Alirajpur and Rajgarh.

The main language of Malwa is Malvi, although Hindi is widely spoken in the cities. This Indo-European language is subclassified as Indic. The language is sometimes referred to as Malavi or Ujjaini. Malvi is part of the Rajasthani branch of languages; &quot;Nimadi&quot; is spoken in the Nimar region of Madhya Pradesh and in Rajasthan. The dialects of Malvi are, in alphabetical order, &quot;Bachadi&quot;, &quot;Bhoyari/Pawari&quot;, &quot;Dholewari&quot;, &quot;Hoshangabadi&quot;, &quot;Jamral&quot;, &quot;Katiyai&quot;, Malvi Proper, &quot;Patvi&quot;, &quot;Rangari&quot;, &quot;Rangri&quot; and &quot;Sondwari&quot;. A survey in 2001 found only four dialects: Ujjaini (in the districts of Ujjain, Indore, Dewas and Sehore), &quot;Rajawari&quot; (Ratlam, Mandsaur and Neemuch), &quot;Umadwari&quot; (Rajgarh) and &quot;Sondhwari&quot; (Jhalawar, in Rajasthan). About 55% of the population of Malwa can converse in and about 40% of the population is literate in Hindi, the official language of the Madhya Pradesh state.

<text>Modern physics is a branch of physics that developed in the early 20th century and onward or branches greatly influenced by early 20th century physics. Notable branches of modern physics include quantum mechanics, special relativity, and general relativity.

&quot;Classical physics&quot; is typically concerned with everyday conditions: speeds are much lower than the speed of light, sizes are much greater than that of atoms, and energies are relatively small. Modern physics, however, is concerned with more extreme conditions, such as high velocities that are comparable to the speed of light (special relativity), small distances comparable to the atomic radius (quantum mechanics), and very high energies (relativity). In general, quantum and relativistic effects are believed to exist across all scales, although these effects may be very small at human scale. While quantum mechanics is compatible with special relativity (See: Relativistic quantum mechanics), one of the unsolved problems in physics is the unification of quantum mechanics and general relativity, which the Standard Model of particle physics currently cannot account for.

Modern physics is an effort to understand the underlying processes of the interactions of matter using the tools of science and engineering. In a literal sense, the term &quot;modern physics&quot; means up-to-date physics. In this sense, a significant portion of so-called &quot;classical physics&quot; is modern. However, since roughly 1890, new discoveries have caused significant paradigm shifts: especially the advent of quantum mechanics (QM) and relativity (ER). Physics that incorporates elements of either QM or ER (or both) is said to be &quot;modern physics&quot;. It is in this latter sense that the term is generally used.

Modern physics is often encountered when dealing with extreme conditions. Quantum mechanical effects tend to appear when dealing with &quot;lows&quot; (low temperatures, small distances), while relativistic effects tend to appear when dealing with &quot;highs&quot; (high velocities, large distances), the &quot;middles&quot; being classical behavior. For example, when analyzing the behavior of a gas at room temperature, most phenomena will involve the (classical) Maxwell–Boltzmann distribution. However, near absolute zero, the Maxwell–Boltzmann distribution fails to account for the observed behavior of the gas, and the (modern) Fermi–Dirac or Bose–Einstein distributions have to be used instead.

Very often, it is possible to find – or &quot;retrieve&quot; – the classical behavior from the modern description by analyzing the modern description at low speeds and large distances (by taking a limit, or by making an approximation). When doing so, the result is called the &quot;classical limit&quot;.

== Hallmarks ==

These are generally considered to be the topics regarded as the &quot;core&quot; of the foundation of modern physics:

<text>Hep G2 (or HepG2) is a human liver cancer cell line.

Hep G2 is an immortal cell line which was derived in 1975 from the liver tissue of a 15-year-old Caucasian male from Argentina with a well-differentiated hepatocellular carcinoma. These cells are epithelial in morphology, have a modal chromosome number of 55, and are not tumorigenic in nude mice. The cells secrete a variety of major plasma proteins, e.g., albumin, and the acute-phase proteins fibrinogen, alpha 2-macroglobulin, alpha 1-antitrypsin, transferrin and plasminogen. They have been grown successfully in large-scale cultivation systems. Hepatitis B virus surface antigens have not been detected. Hep G2 will respond to stimulation with human growth hormone.

Hep G2 cells are a suitable &quot;in vitro&quot; model system for the study of polarized human hepatocytes. Another well-characterized polarized hepatocyte cell line is the rat hepatoma-derived hybrid cell line WIF-B. With the proper culture conditions, Hep G2 cells display robust morphological and functional differentiation with a controllable formation of apical and basolateral cell surface domains (van IJzendoorn et al., 1997; 2000, etc.) that resemble the bile canalicular (BC) and sinusoidal domains, respectively, &quot;in vivo&quot;.

Because of their high degree of morphological and functional differentiation &quot;in vitro&quot;, Hep G2 cells are a suitable model to study the intracellular trafficking and dynamics of bile canalicular, sinusoidal membrane proteins, and lipids in human hepatocytes &quot;in vitro&quot;. This can be important for the study of human liver diseases that are caused by an incorrect subcellular distribution of cell surface proteins, e.g., hepatocanalicular transport defects such as Dubin-Johnson Syndrome and progressive familial intrahepatic cholestasis (PFIC), and familial hypercholesterolemia. Hep G2 cells and their derivatives are also used as a model system for studies of liver metabolism and toxicity of xenobiotics, the detection of environmental and dietary cytotoxic and genotoxic (and thus cytoprotective, anti-genotoxic, and cogenotoxic) agents, understanding hepatocarcinogenesis , and for drug targeting studies . Hep G2 cells are also employed in trials with bio-artificial liver devices .

<text>Leamon King (February 13, 1936 – May 22, 2001) was an American athlete who jointly held the world record for the 100-meter sprint for men from 1956 to 1960.

King, a graduate of the University of California, Berkeley, became joint holder of the record on October 20, 1956 in Ontario, California, with a time of 10.1 seconds, equal with Willie Williams and Ira Murchison, and repeated the time a week later in Santa Ana, California. (In 1956, times were only recorded to the nearest tenth of a second.) Ray Norton also recorded a time of 10.1 seconds in 1959. The first person to run unambiguously faster in competition was Armin Hary in 1960.

He also jointly held the world 100 yard record with a time of 9.3 seconds.

King, along with Murchison, Thane Baker, and Bobby Morrow, won a gold medal at the 1956 Summer Olympics in Melbourne in the 4x100 metre relay. He ran the second leg of the race.

After retiring from athletics, King returned to his job as a schoolteacher, living in Delano, California. He had been a successful student athlete, breaking and making records, at Delano High School, making the finals at the CIF California State Meet in both the 100 yard dash and 220 yard dash each of his four years, winning the 100 once and the 220 twice.

<doc id="844201" wikidata="Q841116" url="?curid=844201" title="Lance-tailed manakin">
<text>The lance-tailed manakin (Chiroxiphia lanceolata) is a small passerine bird which breeds in tropical Central and South America from Costa Rica to northern Venezuela. This manakin is a fairly common bird of dry and moist deciduous forests, but not rainforest. It is a small, compact bird about long and similar to the blue-backed manakin, but both sexes have the two central tail feathers elongated to form a spike. Males have black plumage with a blue back, a red crown and orange legs. Females and juveniles are olive-green with paler underparts. At breeding time, males are involved in a cooperative behaviour during which they jump up and down alternately. This is a fairly common species with a wide range, and the International Union for Conservation of Nature has rated its conservation status as being of &quot;least concern&quot;.

==Description==
Like other manakins, the lance-tailed manakin is a compact, brightly coloured forest bird, typically 13.5 cm long and weighing 17.5 g. Both sexes have bring orange legs and two central tail feathers elongated to form a spike. 

Females are olive-green, with slightly paler underparts. Most females are solid green, however, a small portion have tawny or red caps.  Adult males are mostly black, with a red cap and sky-blue back.  Young males are olive but show a red cap and the start of a blue back as they mature. Male lance-tailed manakins do not reach their full adult plumage until approximately 26 months after hatching.

This species is similar to blue-backed manakin, &quot;Chiroxiphia pareola&quot;, which breeds further south and east, but the latter lacks the spiky tail, and the male has a somewhat darker blue back.

==Ecology==
The male lance-tailed manakin has an interesting breeding display, unusual in that it is cooperative rather than competitive. Two males perch next to each other on a bare stick and jump up and down alternately, sometimes giving short flights. Groups of birds may perform together, with a different stick for each pair of displaying males. The female builds a cup nest in a tree; two brown-mottled cream eggs are laid, and incubated entirely by the female for about 20 days.

The lance-tailed manakin has a number of calls, including a &quot;Toe-LEE-do&quot;, a &quot;curry-ho&quot;, and a frog-like buzzing croak given by displaying males.

These manakins eat fruit and some insects.

==Status==
This bird has a very wide range, is fairly common and is presumed to have a large total population. The population trend is thought to be stable and the International Union for Conservation of Nature has rated the bird&#x27;s conservation status as being of &quot;least concern&quot;.

<text>Robert Pinget (; 19 July 1919 – 25 August 1997) was a Swiss-born French novelist and playwright associated with the nouveau roman movement. 

==Life and work==
Robert Pinget was born in Geneva, Switzerland in 1919. After completing his law studies and working as a lawyer for a year, he moved to Paris in 1946 to study at the Ecole des Beaux-Arts.

In 1951, he published his first novel &quot;Entre Fantoine et Agapa&quot;. After publishing two other novels, but then having his fourth rejected by Gallimard, Pinget was recommended by Alain Robbe-Grillet and Samuel Beckett to Jérôme Lindon, head of Éditions de Minuit, where he subsequently published &quot;Graal Flibuste&quot; in 1956. Éditions de Minuit became his main publisher. In 1964, he moved to the province of Touraine.

Scholars and critics have often associated his work with that of his friend Samuel Beckett, who he met in 1955.

He died of a stroke in Tours in 1997.

== Adaptations ==
&quot;The Old Tune&quot;, Samuel Beckett&#x27;s free translation of &quot;La Manivelle&quot;, was produced by Barbara Bray and broadcast on BBC Third Programme on 23 August 1960.

In 1962, Germaine Tailleferre of Les Six set eleven of Pinget&#x27;s poems in a song cycle entitled &quot;Pancarte pour Une Porte D&#x27;Entrée&quot; (roughly translated as &quot;Handbill for an Entrance&quot;) for medium voice and piano, commissioned by the American Soprano and Arts Patron Alice Swanson Esty.

<text>The Dalkey Archive is a 1964 novel by the Irish writer Flann O&#x27;Brien. It is his fifth and final novel, published two years before his death. It was adapted for the stage by Hugh Leonard in 1965 as &quot;The Saints Go Cycling In&quot;.

==Plot summary==
The book features a mad scientist, De Selby, who tries to destroy the world by removing all the oxygen from the air. He has also many strange inventions. He exploits the theory of relativity and invents a kind of time travelling machine, which he uses to age his whiskey, creating brews that have been aged for many decades in just a few hours.

Saint Augustine and James Joyce both have speaking parts in the novel. James Joyce, after forging his own obituary to escape being drafted to fight in the Second World War, was serving pints in a small pub. Saint Augustine, on the other hand, appeared in a magical underwater cave and held a conversation with De Selby. The mad scientist De Selby leads the two main characters, Hackett and Mick, to the cave, to witness this conversation.

Many prominent elements of the book, particularly De Selby himself, the eccentric policemen, and the atomic theory of the bicycle, were taken from O&#x27;Brien&#x27;s much earlier novel &quot;The Third Policeman&quot;, because he had not been able to find a publisher for it. The latter novel was published posthumously.

<doc id="844211" wikidata="Q6827486" url="?curid=844211" title="Miami model">
<text>The Miami model are the tactics employed by coordinated law enforcement agencies during demonstrations in Miami, Florida relating to the negotiations for the Free Trade Area of the Americas (FTAA) trade agreement in November 2003. The same tactics were first developed and tested at the 2000 Republican National Convention in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania under the direction of John Timoney, who served as police chief to Philadelphia during the RNC and Miami during the FTAA.

On November 13, 2003, four days before the FTAA, the city passed City of Miami Ordinance 54-6.1, outlawing a broad range of items that could be construed as weapons or devices for disrupting public order, as in a &quot;sleeping dragon&quot; and outlawed any coordinated group of two or more people who are attempting to get public attention and disrupt the normal flow of traffic. In addition, any gathering of 8 or more people lasting more than 30 minutes without a permit would be considered illegal. The ordinance was designed specifically for the FTAA and had a sunset provision built into it.

Miami-Dade State Attorney Kathy Fernandez Rundle responded to allegations of police brutality saying &quot;The police were very professional, very controlled... I think we have a model here for the rest of the world to emulate in the future when these sort of events take place.&quot; Further allegations and complaints were met with assurances by authorities that police had acted &#x27;according to plan&#x27;. Political activists and academics continue to use the term to refer to a framework of similar tactics used by law enforcement in subsequent events, including trade meetings and political conventions.

==Features==

The Miami model carries the distinctive features of crowd control techniques used in Miami, which included large scale pre-emptive arrests, heavily armed sometimes unidentifiable law enforcement, the collection of intelligence from protesters, and the &quot;embedding&quot; of corporate media with the police. Additionally, areas that are to be the site of a major event are given large federal grants to purchase materials for security. Thus, police may be unfamiliar with the use of the new equipment they have been given and rural police brought in to the city may be somewhat unfamiliar with crowd control tactics in general. Protestors and activists allege some of the following as further tactics belonging to the Miami model:

* Establishment of joint, unified, multi-agency command/control network.
* Mass purchase of surveillance equipment, riot gear and other supplies.
* Training of local law enforcement in &quot;crowd control tactics&quot; and less lethal weapons.
* Public relations, &quot;information warfare&quot;, newspeak/spin:
**&quot;terrorists/violent protesters coming&quot; vs &quot;well trained officers&quot;
** &quot;event meaningful target for terrorism&quot;
** &quot;police will protect the right to protest&quot;
** &quot;anarchists and criminal elements&quot;, dramatic Seattle WTO or London imagery
** display of confiscated &quot;weapons&quot; prove malintent
** &quot;unpermitted protests can continue&quot; due to police good will
** independent media targeted, cameras, video confiscated
* Pro-event/anti-demonstrator promotional tools developed/used in community.
* Reluctant officials, civic groups pressured to comply with plan by Secret Service/DHS.
* Locations strategically valuable to protesters reserved by law enforcement.
* Plans to secure public buildings and strategic private businesses complete.
* Anti-protest ordinances and other legal hurdles to prevent lawful assembly begin.
* State of Emergency declared or Executive Order signed to allow military policing.
* Surveillance and disruption of protest organizers begins.
* Attempts to divide protest groups and organizers begins in media and meetings.
* Court system tied up: regular business delayed during protest; assist mass arrests.
* Mass detention facilities identified and prepped for use.
* Civic groups and clubs employed to support law enforcement activities.
* March and event permits denied or delayed; delay tactics.
* Police/military collaborate with media, i.e. embedded reporters, etc.
* Street level surveillance increases on organizers and demonstrators.
* Public training drills and mass show of force.
* Sporadic harassment, detention and arrest of demonstrators traveling in area.
* Disruption of organizing/assembly/housing/media spaces. Possible preemptive arrest.
* Command Center operational; large undercover teams begin reporting
* Militarized &quot;hard zone&quot; and limited access &quot;soft zone&quot; created with fences, barricades.
* Area wide surveillance video, including 3-D video systems operational.
* Field forces (riot police, bike police, checkpoints, etc.) put into place.
* Day of protest: assembly blocked, obstructed, redirected.
* Use of less-lethal weapons - projectiles, chemical weapons, electric weapons, sound devices etc.
* Streets cleared using force; protesters pursued; more mass arrest.
* Jail solidarity events allowed to protest for few hours, then cleared.

==Miami protests==

Miami Activist Defense and National Lawyers Guild filed a federal lawsuit against the City, the Mayor, Police Chief Timoney, Homeland Defense Secretary Ridge, and Attorney General Ashcroft for rampant abuse of the constitution.

The American Civil Liberties Union of Florida filed numerous lawsuits claiming excessive use of force and illegal searches. The City and County of Miami have paid close to $500,000 in settlements in the cases.

In 2007, the AFL–CIO filed an additional lawsuit claiming that their 1st and 4th Amendment rights had been violated. 

The Florida Fair Trade Coalition (FFTC) was initial and primary group that began the organizing for these events. The FFTC identified the date and location of the FTAA Ministerial, located the venues for the protesters to use, and set up the initial organizing committee that included the AFL–CIO CLC and national representatives. The FFTC was responsible for coordination the initial coordination between the &quot;national&quot; groups and the local groups, and was chastised by many of these groups for asking Timoney&#x27;s representatives in the early meetings between the city, police and protesters if Timoney planned to use the same illegal tactics that he had used against the protesters at the Republican National Convention in Philly. It was the FFTC that publicly warned the press when asked if there would be any violence at the protests that &quot;This is NOT a question to ask the protestors, but to ask the police, as it is the police under Timoney&#x27;s watch that have created violence and committed illegal acts.&quot; Although chastised by other participating organizations (including one of its main funders CTC) because they felt that what was said about police violence was in itself provocative, history proved that those questions posed to the police in Miami and the press where in fact prophetic. 

Among the groups which organized against the FTAA were the Florida Fair Trade Coalition, Green Bloc, United for Peace and Justice, Root Cause, several AFL–CIO-affiliated unions, Midwest Unrest, Pittsburgh Organizing Group, Food Not Bombs and many others.

==Film==
&quot;The Miami Model&quot; is also the title of a documentary film, produced by Indymedia, about the FTAA, the police action in Miami, and political organizing led by people of color in the Miami area.

<text>Louis George Henyey (February 3, 1910 – February 18, 1970) was an American astronomer.

His parents, Albert and Mary Henyey, were immigrants from Hungary. Louis George Henyey married Elizabeth Rose Belak, born in Budapest, on April 28, 1934; they had three children: Thomas Louis, Francis Stephen, and Elizabeth Maryrose.

His undergrad (1932) and masters (1933) were from the Case School of Applied Science. In Yerkes Observatory of the University of Chicago he earned his doctorate in 1937, with a mathematical thesis on the topic of reflection nebulae. In 1947 he accepted a position as assistant professor in the Department of Astronomy at the University of California, Berkeley, and in 1954 he was promoted to professor. At Berkeley he became head of his own research group in the field of stellar evolution and supervised and collaborated with numerous graduate students, postdoctoral fellows, and scientific visitors. He died unexpectedly of a cerebral hemorrhage on February 18, 1970.

He is best known for his two major scientific contributions in the field of stellar structure and evolution. First, he developed a method for automatic solution of the equations of stellar evolution, suitable for electronic computers and applicable to a wide range of physical conditions and phases in the lifetime of a star. Second, he made new calculation of the evolution of stars during their early history when gravitational contraction provides the main energy source, and during the transition phase when nuclear energy takes over from the gravitational source.
His work on the diffusion of the light in galaxies resulted in what is referred to as the Henyey-Greenstein phase function, first proposed in a paper he authored. This scattering model has found use in other scientific disciplines.

The crater &quot;Henyey&quot; on the Moon is named after him, as is the asteroid called 1365 Henyey.

<doc id="844215" wikidata="Q217154" url="?curid=844215" title="Mir-Hossein Mousavi">
<text>Mir-Hossein Mousavi Khameneh (, ; born 2 March 1942) is an Iranian socialist politician, artist, architect and opposition figure who served as the 45th and last Prime Minister of Iran from 1981 to 1989. He was a reformist candidate for the 2009 presidential election and eventually the leader of the opposition in the post-election unrest. Mousavi served as the president of the Iranian Academy of Arts until 2009, when conservative authorities removed him. Although Mousavi had always considered himself a reformist and believed in promoting change within the 1979 constitution, on 3 February 2023, in response to the Mahsa Amini protests, he announced his opposition to the Islamic Republic and asked for a widespread referendum to fully change the constitution and make a fundamental change in Iran&#x27;s political system.

In the early years of the revolution, Mousavi was the editor-in-chief of &quot;Jomhouri-e Eslami&quot;, the official newspaper of the Islamic Republican Party, before being elevated to Minister of Foreign Affairs and eventually the post of Prime Minister. He was the last Prime Minister of Iran prior to the elimination of that position in the 1989 constitutional changes; he then went into semi-retirement for the next 20 years. Mousavi remains a member of the Expediency Discernment Council and the Supreme Council of Cultural Revolution; he has not participated in their meetings for years, which is interpreted by political analysts and commentators as a sign of his disapproval.

For the 2009 Iranian presidential election, Mousavi came out of semi-retirement and ran as one of two Reformist candidates against the administration of incumbent Iranian President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad. According to official results, he did not win the election, and following alleged vote-rigging and manipulation, his campaign sparked a long protest that eventually turned into a national and international movement against the government and Supreme Leader. Despite this, he remains the leader of the Green Movement but has been severely restricted by Iranian authorities. He is currently under house arrest along with his wife Zahra Rahnavard and Mehdi Karroubi.

==Early life, education, and career==
Seyyed Mir-Hossein Mousavi was born on 2 March 1942 in Khameneh, East Azerbaijan, Iran. He is an ethnic Azerbaijani, whose family originated from Tabriz. His father, Mir-Ismail, was a tea merchant from Tabriz. Mousavi grew up in Khameneh, and moved to Tehran following his graduation from high school in 1958. Mousavi is a relative of fellow Khameneh native Ali Khamenei: Mousavi&#x27;s grandmother is Khamenei&#x27;s paternal aunt.
He earned his undergraduate degree in architecture from the National University of Tehran (now Shahid Beheshti University), and in 1969 was awarded his master&#x27;s degree in architecture from the National University of Tehran, focusing primarily on traditional Iranian architecture. While a student, he was an active member of the leftist Islamic association of students. During his college years, Mousavi had a close relationship with the Freedom Movement of Iran, a religious-nationalist political party founded by Ali Shariati, whom Mousavi admired for many years. Although the party would not be invited to the post-revolution government, many future political leaders of Iran who were affiliated with the party at the time, among them Mehdi Bazargan, Yadolah Sahabi, Mahmoud Taleghani, and Mostafa Chamran would become Mousavi&#x27;s closest allies. Mousavi was among the student activists who regularly attended Ali Shariati&#x27;s lectures at Hosseiniyeh Ershad of Tehran, where Mousavi also exhibited his artwork under the pseudonym Hossein Rah&#x27;jo.

In 1969, Mousavi married Zahra Rahnavard, a fellow university student who specialized in sculpture, and was among the well-known students of Ali Shariati. Rahnavard later became the Chancellor of Alzahra University as well as political adviser to Iran&#x27;s former President Mohammad Khatami. The couple have three daughters; all speak Azeri, Persian, English, and Arabic.

==Iranian Revolution==

Mousavi and his wife had an active role in the success of the Iranian Revolution. He was imprisoned for organizing street protests against the monarchy of Shah Mohammad Reza Pahlavi. As the Iranian Revolution neared, Mousavi, whose earliest political hero was Che Guevara, became more actively involved in the struggle. He initially participated in the establishment of the Jonbesh-e Mosalmanan-e Mobarez (Movement of Militant Muslims) alongside Habibollah Peyman which eventually led him to join ranks with Mohammad Beheshti, who was a close associate of the revolution leader, Ruhollah Khomeini, and abandoned his previous connections with Ali Shariati.

Following the collapse of the Shah&#x27;s regime in 1979, Mousavi helped Mohammad Beheshti found the Islamic Republican Party in 1979 in order to assist the establishment of the Islamic republic in Iran and hasten the overthrow of Iran&#x27;s monarchy. He became the political secretary of the party, and chief editor of &quot;Jomhouri-e Eslami&quot;, the party&#x27;s official newspaper. For this, he is widely viewed as &quot;The Architect&quot; of the Islamic Republic both in Iran and abroad.

In mid-1979, he was appointed by Khomeini to the Council of the Islamic Revolution. As the chief editor of &quot;Jomhouri-e Eslami&quot;, he was a loud critic and opponent of Abolhassan Banisadr, the first president of the Islamic Republic, until the latter&#x27;s 1981 flight to France, following a successful impeachment by parliament. During Banisadr&#x27;s presidency, the prime minister Mohammad Ali Rajai nominated Mousavi as his foreign minister, however Banisadr opposed the nomination and Mousavi was not appointed. On 15 August 1981, as part of the restructuring of the government in Rajai&#x27;s cabinet, Mousavi was appointed foreign minister. He held the post until 15 December 1981, when he received the higher appointment of prime minister.

==Prime ministership==
In August 1981, President Mohammad-Ali Rajai and Prime Minister Mohammad-Javad Bahonar were assassinated in an explosion. Ali Khamenei was then elected as the third President of Iran in the October 1981 Iranian presidential election. He put forward Ali Akbar Velayati as his prime minister, but the Iranian parliament did not give him the vote of confidence, and he was defeated with a vote of 80 to 74. Although Khamenei had strong reservations with Mousavi, as a compromise with the left-leaning parliament, agreed to offer Mousavi for the post of premier. On 28 October 1981, with the approval of Khomeini, the parliament approved Mousavi with a vote of 115 to 39 to become the 79th prime minister of Iran on 31 October 1981.

The conflicts between Mousavi, who belonged to the left wing of the Islamic Republic, with Ali Khamenei (the current leader of Iran), who belonged to the right wing of the Islamic Republic, continued during their eight years of shared governance. However, an escalation in conflicts between the two led to Mousavi&#x27;s resignation shortly after the end of the Iran–Iraq War in 1988. As the prime minister, Mousavi had the full backing of Ruhollah Khomeini, the supreme leader, and he refused to accept his resignation. While his government was viewed as somewhat liberal, he was still under the pressure of hardliners, though Khomeini generally protected Mousavi from the conservatives and gave him a free rein in deciding actions for the economy. However, his involvement in security matters remained less clear, and it was disputed whether or not Mousavi was involved in the killing of thousands of dissidents and minorities in Kurdistan and Mazandaran during this time. It has generally been accepted that Mousavi and Mohsen Rezaee (who was in charge of the Revolutionary Guards during this time) have never been close, though he was in charge of foreign operations, particularly in Lebanon.

Mousavi&#x27;s premiership coincided with the Iran–Iraq War. He guided the country through its war with Iraq, and earned popular acclaim for his stewardship of the national economy. He pioneered a bond-based economy, which many believe was responsible for a fair distribution of goods among the people throughout the Iran–Iraq War. Many analysts praise his handling of Iran&#x27;s economy, his civil and economic leadership during the Iran–Iraq War, and his efforts to end Iran&#x27;s international isolation. Others remember him as being &quot;unpredictable&quot; and less able to navigate Iran&#x27;s labyrinthine political system than his rivals. In 1986, Mousavi played a great role in the Iran–Contra affair and secret negotiations and dealing with USA on helping them free the American hostages in Lebanon, in return for sale of the American weapons and spare-parts that Iran&#x27;s army badly needed for the Iran–Iraq War.

A year after the end of the Iran–Iraq War on 20 August 1988, Ruhollah Khomeini died (June 3, 1989), and Ali Khamenei was elected as the new Supreme Leader by the Assembly of Experts. Following his death, Mousavi and his fellow left-wingers lost their main source of support within the establishment. During the parliament hearing on post-war reconstruction plans, Mousavi had heated arguments with Ali Akbar Hashemi Rafsanjani, the speaker of Iran&#x27;s parliament at the time, over Rafsanjani&#x27;s suggestion that Iran accept the offer of western countries to help with post-war reconstruction.

On 28 July 1989, the constitution was amended and approved by Iranian voters in a national referendum with a 97% yes vote. At this time, Mehdi Karrubi had been elected as the new speaker of the parliament, to whom the amended constitution was declared. One of these amendments abolished the position of Prime Minister. Rafsanjani was elected as the fourth president of Iran on 28 July 1989, and became the president on 3 August 1989. Mousavi&#x27;s premiership ended on the same date. Mousavi was not invited to be a participant in the new government headed by Rafsanjani, and disappeared from the public sphere.

== Early stance on pre-revolutionary icons ==
Some pre-revolutionary filmmakers have accounts about celebrities who have been hurt by Mousavi&#x27;s positions in his early years in office. Saeed Motalebi, an established writer and director in the pre-revolutionary era, has one of such accounts that refers to the 1982 film &quot;The Imperilled&quot; (Barzakhi-ha) which was written by him and had four pre-revolutionary male stars in the lead roles. It was directed by Iraj Ghaderi and, with its patriotic story about resisting foreign invasion, it was a chance for Fardin, Malek-Motiei, Ghaderi and Rad to renew their threatened careers as actors in the post-revolutionary atmosphere. The film was a hit and became the highest grossing Iranian film of all time in its short period of screening in theaters. But it was soon banned and consequently the four actors were banned from working. About how the film&#x27;s success was turned into disaster, Motalebi says: One Friday Mr. Mohsen Makhmalbaf gathered a couple of people and they started collecting signatures for a petition which was written on a scroll, stating that &quot;We have made a revolution while these actors are transgressors.&quot; They did it right in front of that theater in the Revolution Square near the university of Tehran. They said &quot;Look how theaters are crowded while Friday events are deserted.&quot; That&#x27;s how they stopped my film. Then a reporter who was queued to ask something about our film, went and told the then prime minister (Mir-Hossein Mousavi) &quot;There is a film in theaters whose writer wants to convey that people who are fighting in the fronts are problematic persons.&quot; The prime minister replied &quot;These are leftovers of junk intellectuals who will soon go to the dustbin of history.&quot; Malek-Motiei became jobless and turned his garage into a pastry shop. Ghaderi put some rice bags in his office and became a rice dealer. Fardin opened a pastry shop too and when I went to visit him, I used to wait outside as long as there were no customers so that he wouldn&#x27;t feel ashamed when he saw me. These were all caused by those illogical efforts which I will never forgive.

== 1988 prison massacres ==
On 12 December 2018 Amnesty International published an interview of the Austrian national public service ORF (broadcaster), on 13 December 1988, with Mir Hossein Mousavi. Mousavi was asked about the mass executions inside Iran&#x27;s prison at the time he was in office. Mousavi replied, “We repressed them”. Amnesty&#x27;s report criticizes Mousavi&#x27;s response asserting that “without explaining what he is acknowledging ... he focuses on criticizing the July 1988 armed incursion by the People’s Mojahedin Organization of Iran (PMOI).” The report goes on to say:
Since 2009, when he re-entered politics as a Reformist opposition leader, Mir Hossein Mousavi’s response when asked about the 1988 prison massacres has often been to avoid commenting or to claim that they took place without the knowledge of his government. In this way, he has tried to justify his failure to stop, investigate or at least condemn the killings publicly. However, documents from Amnesty International’s archives show that the organization repeatedly raised its concerns about reports of mass prisoner executions with senior officials in Mir Hossein Mousavi’s government.

==Retirement from politics==
When Khomeini, the founder of the Islamic Republic, died in 1989, Mousavi was no longer welcome in the government. It was the start of 20 years of an almost total absence from public life for Mousavi, which many considered as a sign of his disapproval of the established government, though he did sit on two high-level government councils.

In 1989, Ali Khamenei named him as a member of the Expediency Discernment Council, his membership of which still continues. Mousavi has been a member of the Supreme Council of Cultural Revolution since 1996. He was also the political adviser of president Hashemi Rafsanjani (1989–1997) and senior adviser of president Khatami (1997–2005).

During these years, he partly retired from politics and returned to architecture and teaching, becoming President of the Iranian Academy of Arts, one of the four academies of the Islamic Republic of Iran. The main building of the Academy is designed by him. At the same time, he developed his passion for painting and writing poetry. He was a professor at Shahid Beheshti University and later joined the Academic staff of Tarbiat Modares University. His main field is architecture, and buildings such as &quot;Kanoon-e Tohid&quot; in Tehran, &quot;Beynolharamein Bazaar&quot; in Shiraz, &quot;Haft-e-tir Martyr&#x27;s tomb&quot; in Tehran&#x27;s Behesht-e Zahra, and &quot;Salman mosque&quot; in the presidential residence are examples of his work. In recent years, he has been more active in painting and has participated in many exhibitions.

== Presidential candidacy ==
===Pre-2009===
Mousavi refused to run for the presidency in the 1997 elections, which caused the reformists to turn to his former Cabinet Minister, then a little-known cleric, Mohammad Khatami, who was elected by a landslide. During Khatami&#x27;s administration, Mousavi served as the Senior Adviser to the President.

Mousavi was considered the leading candidate from the reformist alliance to run in the 2005 Iranian presidential election. However, on 12 October 2004, he officially declined the proposal after a meeting with President Mohammad Khatami and the two other top members of one of Iran&#x27;s main Reformist parties, the Association of Combatant Clerics, Mehdi Karroubi and Mohammad Mousavi-Khoiniha.

===2009 presidential candidacy===
After 20 years of political silence, on 9 March 2009, Mousavi announced his intention to run in the 2009 Iranian presidential election. He stated that his main goals were: to institutionalize social justice, equality and fairness, freedom of expression, to root out corruption and to speed up Iran&#x27;s stagnant process of privatization, and thus move Iran away from what he called &quot;an alms-based economy&quot;. Mousavi criticized the then-current conservative President, Mahmoud Ahmadinejad, for his alleged economic mismanagement, asking, when Iran &quot;was making profits from the high prices of oil, did he (Ahmadinejad) envisage a situation when the prices would fall?&quot; On 16 March 2009, the former Iranian President Khatami withdrew from the election in support of Mir-Hossein Mousavi.

====Platform====
Mousavi ran as an independent Principled Reformist candidate. Although he is one of the original founders of the Iranian reformist camp, he shares many principles of the conservatives. Many reformist parties, among them reformist Islamic Iranian Participation Front, whose main candidate was Khatami, have supported his candidacy after the latter withdrew from the race. Many supporters of the reformist movement, however, objected to Mousavi&#x27;s candidacy on the grounds that he was not committed to the principles of the reformist parties. Although Mousavi stated that he was not running as a reformist, he indicated that he welcomed the support of different parties, both reformist and conservative. He started his campaign from the center of Iranian politics; over time, he shifted more towards the left by declaring his support for reforms. Although some active members of the conservative camp, such as Emad Afroogh, as well as the conservative newspaper &quot;Jomhouri-e Eslami&quot;, supported Mousavi&#x27;s candidacy, he did not receive the official backing of any major conservative party. His candidacy made it harder for the conservatives to support Mahmoud Ahmadinejad, and large conservative parties, such as the Combatant Clergy Association, did not back the current President for a second term of office.

====Domestic policies====

Mousavi had on numerous occasions indicated his wish to change the constitution in order to remove the existing ban on the private ownership of television stations (currently all Iranian television stations are state-owned), as well as transfer the control of the law-enforcement forces to the President (so that they represent the people, since the people directly elect the President through popular vote) from the Supreme Leader. He said that &quot;the issue of non-compliance with the Iranian rules and regulations is the biggest problem that the country is currently faced with&quot; and that he wished to put in place ways to enforce the laws further, and that it was also important to bring an end to keeping the populace uninformed about government matters. Among his policies were creation of a free environment for the flow of information and corrections to the national budget. He wanted to promote the creation of private, non-governmental TV networks and stop the operation of the &quot;Moral Police&quot;. He has spoken about his opposition to massive changes in ministries, which he claims is what Ahmadinejad has done.

The BBC reported that Mousavi &quot;called for greater personal freedoms in Iran and criticized the ban on private television channels&quot;, but &quot;refused to back down from the country&#x27;s disputed nuclear programme, saying it was &quot;for peaceful purposes&quot;. Regarding the Iranian nuclear program, his plan includes a reduction of the cost by opposing radical approaches while maintaining what he sees as &quot;Iran&#x27;s right to civilian nuclear technology&quot;. Mousavi has stated that giving up the country&#x27;s nuclear program would be &quot;irreparable&quot; and that the Iranian people support the nuclear program. &quot;No one in Iran will accept suspension,&quot; Mousavi has said, adding that if elected, his policy would be to work to provide &quot;guarantees&quot; that Tehran&#x27;s nuclear activities would never divert to non-peaceful aims.

On 30 May, Mousavi pledged that if elected he would amend &quot;discriminatory and unjust regulations&quot; against women, and take other measures in favour of women&#x27;s rights and equality. He said that he would seek to disband the so-called morality police force, and ensure that Iranian women are treated equally, with the ability to attain financial empowerment and to serve at the highest levels of decision making bodies.

====Foreign policies====
Mousavi directly addressed activating foreign policy to boost national interest by reducing tensions with other nations. This included negotiating with U.S. President Barack Obama if &quot;his actions are in keeping with his words&quot;. He condemned Ahmadinejad&#x27;s attitude toward The Holocaust (namely, that it was &quot;a myth&quot;), and condemned the killing of Jews in the Holocaust.

==Protests to the election results==

The election was held on 12 June 2009. The official results showed Ahmadinejad winning by a landslide, though Mousavi and many others believed the results to be fraudulent, suggesting that the Interior Minister, Sadegh Mahsouli, an ally of Ahmadinejad, interfered with the election and distorted the votes to keep Ahmadinejad in power. Mousavi has claimed victory, and called for his supporters to celebrate it, sparking large protests as a result.

Due to protests, from the opposition, the Supreme Leader ordered a partial recount of the election results. The recount was a random counting of 10% of the ballots. In order to create transparency, a 12-member council showed the recount on television, and concluded that President Ahmadinejad still led Mousavi after the recount. After the recount, the Guardian council certified the election, and concluded no evidence of irregularities, and closed the dossier on the election.

===Beginning of the Green Movement===

The Iranian Green Movement refers to a series of actions after the Iranian presidential election in 2009, in which protesters demanded the removal of Mahmoud Ahmadinejad from office.

Mousavi, Mehdi Karroubi, Hossein-Ali Montazeri and Mohammad Khatami are recognized as leaders of the Green Movement. Where is my vote? () was a motto used during the protests. Anti-Ahmadinejad protesters chanted the English-language phrase in numbers not seen since the 1979 Iranian Revolution, in an attempt to receive international attention. The Iranian Government had released results claiming a two-thirds majority for Ahmadinejad, but supporters of Mousavi and Karroubi, the moderate opposition leaders, accused the government of rigging the vote.

In the aftermath of the election and ensuing comments by Ahmadinejad and other conservative leaders, calling the opposition &quot;a pile of dust&quot; (خس و خاشاک), protests were widened and massive peaceful protests were held around the country. Although the Iranian government prohibited any gatherings of protesters in Tehran and across the country, significantly slowed down internet access, and censored any form of media supporting the opposition, hundreds of thousands of Iranians marched in defiance. Large numbers of protesters were arrested, and several were killed by the police and militia forces Basij. Neda Agha-soltan and Sohrab Aarabi were among the victims, and alleged cases of rape in prison (Taraneh Mousavi) were also uncovered.

Since the election, the government has severely restricted the access of foreign and Iranian media to footage and information relating to opposition activities. As a result, scenes of the massive street protests and more frequent student protests have been filmed by participants themselves.

===Death of Mousavi&#x27;s nephew===
Seyed Ali Mousavi was the nephew of Mousavi. Ali Mousavi died on 27 December 2009, during the 2009 Iranian election protests, when he was reportedly shot in either the back or the chest by security forces during demonstrations against Mahmoud Ahmadinejad&#x27;s contested election win.

Iranian filmmaker Mohsen Makhmalbaf, the official spokesman of Mir-Hossein Moussavi&#x27;s campaign abroad, told BBC News in an interview that Iranian secret police had called Seyed Ali Mousavi several times, days before he was shot, saying: &quot;We will kill you.&quot;

After he died, his body was taken to Ebn-e Sina hospital, where protesters demonstrated outside. The protesters were broken up with tear gas by the Iranian security forces. It was later revealed that the government had removed his body and taken it to an undisclosed location in an attempt to crack down on the protests.

===The Green Path of Hope===
Mousavi and other reformist leaders are now working with peaceful and legal methods to widen the influence of their reforms. They have set up a new coalition, named The Green Path of Hope. Iranian political parties and movements need to be authorized by the Interior Ministry. Mousavi neither recognizes the current government as legitimate, nor is likely to receive permission; the movement was named a &quot;path&quot; in order bypass this law.

The Green Path of Hope seeks to continue protests against Ahmadinejad&#x27;s presidency following lawful and peaceful methods, and the full execution of the constitution, as Mousavi says:

Mousavi is quoted in describing the movement:

According to organization officials, the movement encompasses numerous political parties, NGOs and social networks. Mousavi emphasized that existent, autonomous social networks in the community are part of this movement:

The &quot;Green Path&quot; has six main members on its central council, who are connected to reformist parties, NGOs, and social networks. The main body will be ordinary protesters. The strategy is to connect existent pressures and issues in society in a social network, and to therefore lead protests in a lawful manner.

===Arab Spring===

In the wake of the Tunisian and Egyptian revolutions, Green movement leaders in Iran called for demonstrations on 14 February 2011. The government responded by placing leaders of the movement under house arrest, and on 14 February Iranian state TV broadcast images of &quot;some 50 conservative MPs marching through parliament&#x27;s main hall&quot; chanting &quot;Death to Mousavi, death to Karroubi&quot;.

===House arrest===

Mousavi and his wife, as well as Mehdi Karoubi, another opposition figure, were put under house arrest after they urged their supporters to organize demonstrations in support of uprisings in the Arab world in February 2011. On 2 February 2013, Iran&#x27;s security forces arrested Mousavi&#x27;s two daughters, Zahra and Nargess Mousavi, in their home. The semi-official news agency ILNA reported that they were questioned, and then freed the same day. After the election of Hassan Rouhani as President in 2013, it was announced that Mousavi and Rahnavard would soon be freed from house arrest. However, , he was still under house arrest.

In 2019, Mousavi was given the right to exit his home once a week. In addition, his immediate family were also able to visit him anytime. They were also given permission to use a mobile phone and satellite television.

<text>Tanya Sue Huff (born 1957) is a Canadian fantasy author. Her stories have been published since the late 1980s, including five fantasy series and one science fiction series. One of these, her &quot;Blood Books&quot; series, featuring detective Vicki Nelson, was adapted for television under the title &quot;Blood Ties&quot;.

==Biography==
Born in Halifax, Nova Scotia, Huff was raised in Kingston, Ontario. Her first sale as a writer was to &quot;The Picton Gazette&quot; when she was ten. They paid $10 for two of her poems. Huff joined the Canadian Naval Reserve in 1975 as a cook, ending her service in 1979. In 1982 she received a Bachelor of Applied Arts degree in Radio and Television Arts from Ryerson Polytechnical Institute in Toronto, Ontario; she was in the same class as science-fiction writer Robert J. Sawyer and they collaborated on their final TV Studio Lab assignment, a short science-fiction show.

In the early 1980s she worked at Mr. Gameway&#x27;s Ark, a game store in Downtown Toronto. From 1984 to 1992 she worked at Bakka, North America&#x27;s oldest surviving science fiction book store, in Toronto. During this time she wrote seven novels and nine short stories, many of which were subsequently published. Her first professional sale was to George Scithers, the editor of &quot;Amazing Stories&quot; in 1985, who bought her short story &quot;Third Time Lucky&quot;. She was a member of the Bunch of Seven writing group. In 1992, after living for 13 years in downtown Toronto, she moved with her four large cats to rural Ontario, where she currently resides with her wife, fellow fantasy writer Fiona Patton.

Huff is one of the most prominent Canadian authors in the category of contemporary fantasy, a subgenre pioneered by Charles de Lint. Many of the scenes in her stories are near places where she has lived or frequented in Toronto, Kingston, and elsewhere. A prolific author, &quot;she has written everything from horror to romantic fantasy to contemporary fantasy to humour to space opera.&quot;

She appeared in a 2009 documentary &quot;Pretty Bloody: The Women of Horror&quot;.

==Adaptations==
The CBC Television series &quot;Blood Ties&quot; was based on Huff&#x27;s Vicki Nelson novels, and also aired in the United States on Lifetime. It was produced by CHUM Television and Kaleidoscope Entertainment. It was not picked up for a second season (which would have been the third season in the US).

<text>Vindhya Pradesh was a former state of India. It was created in 1948 as Union of Baghelkhand and Bundelkhand States from the territories of the princely states in the eastern portion of the former Central India Agency. It was named as Vindhya Pradesh on 25 January 1950 after the Vindhya Range, which runs through the centre of the province. The capital of the state was the former princely state of Rewa. It lay between Uttar Pradesh to the north and Madhya Pradesh to the south, and the enclave of Datia, which lay a short distance to the west, was surrounded by the state of Madhya Bharat.

Vindhya Pradesh was merged into Madhya Pradesh in 1956, following the States Reorganisation Act.

It occupied an area of 61,131.5 km2 (23,603 sq. miles).

==History==
Vindhya Pradesh state was formed on 12 March 1948 and inaugurated on 4 April 1948. 36 princely states were merged to form Vindhya Pradesh state:

<doc id="844230" wikidata="Q6492365" url="?curid=844230" title="Las Olas Boulevard">
<text>Las Olas Boulevard is a major east-west thoroughfare in Fort Lauderdale, Florida, United States that runs from SW 1st Avenue in the Central Business District to Florida State Road A1A in Fort Lauderdale Beach. The name &quot;&quot; means &quot;The Waves&quot; in Spanish. The road once carried the designations of State Road A1A Alt. and State Road 842.

The easternmost section begins on a barrier island and crosses the intracoastal waterway. The road then enters the residential neighborhoods of Seven Isles and Hendricks and Venice Isles. West of SE 17th Avenue, the road enters a commercial shopping district, which is itself colloquially called &quot;Las Olas&quot;. This portion of the road is lined with low and mid-rise bars, nightclubs, bridal stores, shops, boutiques, art galleries, and restaurants. The road passes over the Henry E. Kinney Tunnel and enters the city&#x27;s financial district. The westernmost part of the street is predominantly lined by high-rises.

==History==
The boulevard was constructed in 1917 by S.P. Snyder &amp; Son Co., when Las Olas was just a dirt road that crossed the swampy wetlands to the barrier island at Fort Lauderdale Beach. The Las Olas Isles were dredged in the 1920s to create land for a waterfront residential district. The modern commercial segment of Las Olas Boulevard was constructed during the Post World War II era. The buildings surrounding the westernmost downtown segment underwent significant redevelopment since the 1970s.

In the early 1980s, Las Olas went through a major renovation program to enhance property values. The land was worth much more than that of the standing homes. It was decided that anyone who wished to buy property on one of the isles would have to tear down the existing home and build a home of equal or greater value than the land. Professional tour companies provide tours that take people down the waterways to show off the celebrities homes and yachts.

In 2020, the city completed construction on the $49 million Las Olas Oceanside Park project at the intersection of Florida State Road A1A and Las Olas Boulevard. This project provided a 650-space parking garage behind and a beachfront park and plaza. The park hosts a variety of events, including farmers markets, fitness and art events.

==Notable buildings==
* Elbo Room bar
* Riverside Hotel
* The Governor&#x27;s Club Hotel (1936–1995, demolished) 
* Museum of Art Fort Lauderdale
* Bank of America Plaza

==Public Transportation==
Las Olas Boulevard is served by Broward County Transit Route 11 along most of its length, between SE 3rd Avenue and Fort Lauderdale Beach. The street is also served by the Las Olas Link of the Downtown Fort Lauderdale Transportation Management Association&#x27;s Sun Trolley Bus Service.

==Notable residents==
A few of the most notable (past and present) are:
*Johnny Weissmuller, actor who played Tarzan. 
*Wayne Huizenga, CEO of Waste Management, Inc, Blockbuster Video and AutoNation.
*Connie Francis, actress and movie star who was featured in the movie, Where the Boys Are which was filmed on Las Olas Blvd at the famed Elbo Room.
*Dan Quayle, former Vice President of the United States.
*Lee Majors, actor who played The Six Million Dollar Man and former husband to Farrah Fawcett.
*Sonny and Cher, singers and actors.
*Lucille Ball and Desi Arnaz, television and movie stars. Stars of I Love Lucy fame.
*Gloria Vanderbilt, designer and socialite.
*Marion G. Wells, president of the Marion G. Wells Foundation, and former widow of Preston A. Wells Jr.
*Preston A. Wells Jr., owner of much of the Las Olas Blvd real estate, including the Riverside Hotel, and the owner of the development company, The Las Olas Company.
*Frank and Ivy Stranahan, founding pioneers of Fort Lauderdale and the first residents of Las Olas Boulevard. Their trading post Stranahan House is located between the boulevard and New River. Ivy established the first public school in Ft. Lauderdale and later donated the land which would eventually become Stranahan High School.

<text>Brian Tristan (born March 27, 1959), better known by his stage name Kid Congo Powers, is an American rock guitarist, singer, and actor best known as a member of The Gun Club, the Cramps and Nick Cave and the Bad Seeds. He has also played with the Divine Horsemen, the Angels of Light, Die Haut, and Knoxville Girls.

As of January 2015, Powers&#x27; primary musical project is the band The Pink Monkey Birds.

== Early life ==
Born in La Puente, California, Powers is a second generation Mexican American. His earliest childhood influences were the Southern California Chicano rock band Thee Midniters. In 1976, he was president of The Ramones fan club, then ran a fanzine for The Screamers.

== Career ==

=== 1979–1987: The Gun Club and The Cramps ===
After traveling to London and New York City he returned to L.A. and in 1979 met Jeffrey Lee Pierce. Pierce taught him to play guitar using open tuning, and they formed The Creeping Ritual, which became The Gun Club. Powers left that group before their recording debut, instead joining New York-based band The Cramps in December 1980.

Powers rejoined the Gun Club briefly in 1983, touring with Pierce&#x27;s band in Australia the following year, and then again between 1985 and 1988.

=== 1986–1996: Nick Cave and The Bad Seeds, The Gun Club reunion, Congo Norvell ===
Powers joined Nick Cave and the Bad Seeds in Berlin, Germany, September 1986 initially as a short-term replacement for Hugo Race. Powers ultimately recorded and toured with the Bad Seeds for four years. Powers recorded the albums &quot;Tender Prey&quot; (1988) and &quot;The Good Son&quot; (1990) with Cave and his band. Powers recalled in early 2015 that he &quot;loved&quot; the &quot;primaeval element of rock&#x27;n&#x27;roll&quot; expressed by the band. 

During April 1990 Powers amicably left the Bad Seeds to rejoin The Gun Club, which he had reconvened with Jeffery Lee Pierce in 1989. Powers was active with the Gun Club until their 1996 dissolution, and Pierce died in 1996. 

Parallel to his final stint in the Gun Club, Powers formed Congo Norvell with vocalist Sally Norvell. The band explored a fusion of cabaret and rock styles from 1993 to 1998, and released three full-length albums.

=== 1997–2009: The Pink Monkey Birds and &quot;Dracula Boots&quot; ===

For his next project, The Pink Monkey Birds, Powers initially collaborated with New York City guitarist Jack Martin, who he has also collaborated with for the Congo Norvell and Knoxville Girls projects. Then, in 2009, Powers recruited Kiki Solis on bass, Ron Miller on drums, and Jesse Roberts on guitar and keyboards. The band moved to In The Red Records and released the much acclaimed debut studio album, &quot;Dracula Boots&quot;, which was called a &quot;return to form.&quot;

&quot;Dracula Boots&quot; was coproduced by Jason Ward and recorded in a former high school gymnasium in Harveyville, Kansas, which is now an artists&#x27; retreat called &quot;The Harveyville Project.&quot; &quot;Dracula Boots&quot; consists of numerous genres, including southern soul, 60s Chicano rock, and psychedelic imagery. British magazine &quot;N.M.E.&quot; wrote: &quot;In short, on &quot;Dracula Boots&quot; Kid Congo Powers has once again found the juicy jugular of soul-fired, funked-up rock&#x27;n&#x27;roll. You&#x27;d be foolish not to take a bite.&quot;

=== 2010–present: &quot;Gorilla Rose&quot; ===
In 2011, Kid Congo and The Pink Monkey Birds released their second album, &quot;Gorilla Rose&quot;, which was also on the In The Red Records label. Eamon Carr of &quot;The Dublin Evening Herald&quot; said of &quot;Gorilla Rose&quot;, &quot;Having a working band is paying off. &quot;Gorilla Rose&quot; elevates seedy go-go weirdness to the level of high art.&quot;

Powers returned to Australia for the first time in 25 years—when he toured with Cave&#x27;s Bad Seeds project—at the end of January 2015. The band played at Melbourne&#x27;s &quot;Summersalt Festival&quot; and the Sydney Festival. In a promotional interview for the Australian shows, Powers spoke in regard to his new band:

I think the Pink Monkey Birds conjures up all the best aspects of primal rock&#x27;n&#x27;roll ... Lyrically, I&#x27;m speaking in images, and from a very skewed viewpoint, whatever the subject may be. I still have the passion and the incentive to make music that&#x27;s different, but still within the confines of a punk rock language people will know and understand.

The Pink Monkey Birds, whose name Kid credits to inspiration from David Bowie, has been an evolving unit since their earliest albums, and as of 2016 the touring members are bassist Kiki Solis, drummer Ron Miller, and guitarist Mark Cisneros.

Kid Congo Powers was profiled by Vogue in late April 2016 while promoting his band&#x27;s fourth album. In the interview, he was noted for his iconic sense of punk style and he mentions the aesthetic importance of tying the look of the band to match the music.

For me, the whole art of being a band—and I do think it&#x27;s an art—is to create a whole world, a whole language, that is every aspect. The Gun Club, we kind of made it up as we went along, but what I learned from The Cramps and Nick Cave &amp; the Bad Seeds is that they created a whole uncompromising world, and it&#x27;s all kind of sprung out of that. You want to communicate with people, and I think through all aesthetics—artwork, the look, and music—you get to keep your world, and you get to let people enter your world and live in your world with you.

== Personal life ==
Kid Congo Powers is gay and is married. During the 1980s, he was involved with the ACT UP advocacy group.

<text>Victor Frederick &quot;Viki&quot; Weisskopf (also spelled Viktor; September 19, 1908 – April 22, 2002) was an Austrian-born American theoretical physicist. He did postdoctoral work with Werner Heisenberg, Erwin Schrödinger, Wolfgang Pauli, and Niels Bohr. During World War II he was Deputy Division Leader of the Theoretical Division of the Manhattan Project at Los Alamos, and he later campaigned against the proliferation of nuclear weapons.

== Biography ==
Weisskopf was born in Vienna to Jewish parents and earned his doctorate in physics at the University of Göttingen in Germany in 1931. His brilliance in physics led to work with the great physicists exploring the atom, especially Niels Bohr, who mentored Weisskopf at his institute in Copenhagen. By the late 1930s, he realized that, as a Jew, he needed to get out of Europe. Bohr helped him find a position in the United States.

In the 1930s and 1940s, &quot;Viki&quot;, as everyone called him, made major contributions to the development of quantum theory, especially in the area of quantum electrodynamics. One of his few regrets was that his insecurity about his mathematical abilities may have cost him a Nobel Prize when he did not publish results (which turned out to be correct) about what became known as the Lamb shift. Nevertheless, he was nominated for the Nobel Prize in Physics numerous times later in his career.

From 1937 to 1943 he was a Professor of Physics at the University of Rochester. There, he met graduate student Esther Conwell, and together they formulated the Conwell–Weisskopf theory, which describes the movement of electrons through semiconductors and led to a better understanding of integrated circuits, knowledge that became essential for modern computing.

After World War II, Weisskopf joined the physics faculty at MIT, ultimately becoming head of the department. In 1956, he became one of the founding members of the Physical Science Study Committee (PSSC), developing the curriculum for a revolutionary method of teaching physics at the high school level. As the Red Scare faded, in 1959 Weisskopf joined physicists George Gamow and Hans Bethe in supporting the return of exiled physicist Frank Oppenheimer to science teaching; a decade later, Oppenheimer would found the innovative Exploratorium museum of science, technology, and arts in San Francisco.

At MIT, he encouraged students to ask questions, and even in undergraduate physics courses, taught his students to think like physicists, not just to memorize the equations of physics. He was a memorable teacher, and delighted in posing &quot;Fermi questions&quot; and then helping students to work out approximate answers. For example, he would ask the maximum possible height of a mountain on the Earth, calculated from known basic physical constants. It took him about half an hour to work through an explanation of his computations, with the result being of the same order of magnitude as the known height of Mount Everest. For an encore, he would quickly work out the analogous answers for Mars and Jupiter (when the Mars Orbiter survey results later became available, they were consistent with his computed elevation). For his finale, he would compute the energy released by rolling a bowling ball down the highest theoretical mountain on Jupiter.

Weisskopf was a co-founder and board member of the Union of Concerned Scientists. He served as director-general of CERN from 1961 to 1966. In 1966 a &quot;Festschrift&quot; was published in his honor.

Weisskopf was awarded the Max Planck Medal in 1956 and the Prix mondial Cino Del Duca in 1972, the National Medal of Science (1980), the Wolf Prize (1981) and the Public Welfare Medal from the National Academy of Sciences (1991).

Weisskopf was a member of the National Academy of Sciences and the American Philosophical Society. He was president of the American Physical Society (1960–61) and the American Academy of Arts and Sciences (1976–1979).

He was appointed by Pope Paul VI to the 70-member Pontifical Academy of Sciences in 1975, and in 1981 he led a team of four scientists sent by Pope John Paul II to talk to President Ronald Reagan about the need to prohibit the use of nuclear weapons.

In a joint statement &quot;Preserving and Cherishing the Earth&quot; with other noted scientists including Carl Sagan, it concluded that: &quot;The historical record makes clear that religious teaching, example, and leadership are powerfully able to influence personal conduct and commitment ... Thus, there is a vital role for religion and science.&quot;

== Personal life ==
His first wife, Ellen Tvede, died in 1989. Weisskopf died on April 22, 2002, and was survived by his second wife Duscha, daughter of accidental Night of the Long Knives victim Willi Schmid.

<text>USS &quot;Hoel&quot; (DD-533) was a built for the United States Navy during World War II. She was named after Lieutenant Commander William R. Hoel. Commissioned in 1943, she is famous for helping to fend off a much larger Japanese center force at the Battle off Samar during the Battle of Leyte Gulf on 25 October 1944. She most notably assisted in forcing the battleship &quot;Yamato&quot; to retire from the battle with torpedo strikes. However, she did not live to tell the tale, first being crippled by gunfire from the battleship &quot;Nagato&quot; and the heavy cruiser &quot;Haguro&quot;, then finished off by &quot;Yamato&#x27;s&quot; secondary armament. &quot;Hoel&quot; was awarded with the United States Presidential Unit Citation, &quot;Hoel&quot; received the Philippine Presidential Unit Citation and five battle stars for her service during the second world war. 

==Design and characteristics==
The &quot;Fletcher&quot;-class destroyers were designed, beginning in October 1939, to be large enough to adequately carry the armament of the preceding s. From January 1940 to the end of World War II, 175 &quot;Fletcher&quot;-class destroyers were built.

As a &quot;Fletcher&quot;-class, &quot;Hoel&quot; displaced under her standard load and at full load. She had an overall length of , with a draft of and beam of . She was powered by two General Electric steam turbines and four Babcock &amp; Wilcox boilers, which produced and a top speed of . With a fuel capacity of of fuel oil, &quot;Hoel&quot; had a range of at . She was crewed by 273 enlisted men and officers.

&quot;Hoel&quot;″s armor measured thick on its sides and on the deck over its machinery. Her primary armament consisted of a main battery of five dual-purpose /38 cal. guns, guided by a Mark 37 Gun Fire Control System, ten torpedo tubes guided by a Mark 27 Torpedo Fire Control System, and six depth charge projectors with two tracks guided by a Mark 27 Depth Charge Fire Control System. Her anti-aircraft battery was made up by ten Bofors guns and seven Oerlikon cannons, each guided by a Mark 51 Fire Control System. She was equipped with a QC series sonar.

==Construction and service history==
&quot;Hoel&quot; was launched on 19 December 1942 by the Bethlehem Steel Co., San Francisco, California, sponsored by Mrs. Charles Bunker Crane, Jr., granddaughter of the namesake; and commissioned on 29 July 1943.

&quot;Hoel&quot; sailed from San Francisco Bay 16 August 1943 for shakedown training in operating areas out of San Diego during which she made seven depth charge runs on an underwater sound contact with unknown results. After returning to Mare Island Naval Shipyard 17 September 1943 for final alterations, she cleared San Francisco 26 October 1943 as a part of the screen for a convoy which reached Pearl Harbor 31 October 1943 where &quot;Hoel&quot; reported to Captain Albert George (A. G.) Cook, Commander of Destroyer Squadron 47 (DesRon 47), who then shifted his flag to her from .

Fifth Fleet, which was then preparing to take the Gilbert Islands in Operation Galvanic, assigned &quot;Hoel&quot; to Rear Admiral Kelly Turner&#x27;s Northern attack force Task Force 52 (TF 52). She joined , , and and in guarding Air Support Group 52.3 composed of the escort carriers , , and .

&quot;Hoel&quot; sortied from Pearl Harbor with her group 10 November 1943 and guarded her &quot;baby flattops&quot; as their aircraft pounded Makin in a dawn preinvasion attack 20 November 1943. For the next three days, torpedo bombers and fighters from Air Support Group 52.3 supported Major General Ralph C. Smith&#x27;s 27th Infantry Division as it struggled to take Makin. Thousands of bombs and countless rounds from the guns on these aircraft smashed Japanese troop concentrations, gun emplacements, and shore installations on the island. Before dawn 24 November 1943, a torpedo fired by struck &quot;Liscome Bay&quot; amidships and lookouts on the fantail of &quot;Coral Sea&quot; spotted the wake of a second torpedo which barely missed their ship. Bluejackets on board &quot;Hoel&quot; saw smoke and flame rise at least a when the torpedo ripped into &quot;Liscome Bay&quot; and detonated her bomb magazine. Rear Admiral Henry M. Mullinnix, commander of the Air Support Group, Captain Irving D. Wiltsie and 642 officers and men died with the carrier that sank some 23 minutes later after spewing smoke, flame and redhot aircraft parts for miles around. The groups destroyers rescued 272 survivors. At dusk the following day, 25 November 1943, Japanese aircraft spotted Rear Admiral Turner&#x27;s task force steaming a few miles off Butaritari Island and dropped both float and parachute flares on each side of his ships to light them up as targets for 13 torpedo bombers which swooped in to attack. Spirited gunnery and well-timed radical simultaneous turns, however, enabled the American vessels to escape without suffering a single hit.

When the escort carriers cleared the area at night 27 November 1943, &quot;Hoel&quot; joined the screen protecting Abemama Group l which was unloading on Abemama Island. The next morning, &quot;Hoel&quot; joined Rear Admiral Turner&#x27;s task force and arrived off Tarawa 1 December 1943 for antisubmarine patrol five miles (8 km) off the lagoon entrance. Two days later she joined the escort for and a group of transports sailing for Pearl Harbor where they arrived 11 December 1943. Captain A. G. Cook, commander of Destroyer Squadron 47 shifted his flag from &quot;Hoel&quot; to 14 December 1943.

&quot;Hoel&quot; with fleet units of the 5th Amphibious Force, began intensive training for the invasion of the Marshall Islands. Departed Pearl Harbor 21 January 1944 with the transport screen of Reserve Force, Task Group 51.1 (TG 51.1) which steamed east of Kwajalein while Rear Admiral Turner&#x27;s Joint Expeditionary Force landed on that atoll 31 January 1944. &quot;Hoel&quot; escorted the group&#x27;s transports into Kwajalein Lagoon 2 February 1944, and the following day took station as a radar picket patrol ship south of Kwajalein where she was on call for gunfire support. On 6 February 1944, she accompanied on a tour of inspection in the Roi-Namur area for Admiral Chester Nimitz.

When Task Forces 51 and 53 dissolved and their ships reverted to Task Force 51, &quot;Hoel&quot; was assigned to Fire Support Section 3, Task Unit 51.17.3 (TU 51.17.3) of the Eniwetok Expeditionary Group. In the early morning darkness of 17 February 1944, &quot;Hoel&quot; reentered Eniwetok Lagoon with to bombard Parry and Japtan Islands. &quot;Hoel&quot; picked up several aviators from a wrecked scout aircraft from and returned them to their ship. That afternoon &quot;Hoel&quot;″s guns destroyed several small craft on the beach of Parry Island and fired on pillboxes and troop concentrations inland. She then anchored in standby position while the rest of the force bombarded the two islands. The next day, &quot;Hoel&quot; took her turn at providing harassing fire and at night illuminated the beaches and the reef to prevent enemy troop movements. Just before daybreak 19 February 1944, she took station off Eniwetok for close fire support of the initial landings. When relieved by on 21 February 1944, &quot;Hoel&quot; steamed to a position off the deep entrance to Eniwetok Lagoon for patrol duty which continued until 26 February 1944, when she embarked a fighter director team from and assumed duties of standby fighter director for the Eniwetok area. On 4 March 1944, 2 days later after the attack and occupation phase of Eniwetok was completed, the fighter-director team was transferred to , freeing &quot;Hoel&quot; to depart for Majuro for repairs.

&quot;Hoel&quot;, in company with three other destroyers of DesRon 47 reported to Commander 3d Fleet at Purvis Bay, Florida Island, 18 March 1944. The next day she cleared that port to join Task Force 39, but 20 March 1944 she was ordered to change course for Emirau Island which was then being occupied by marines. On 25 March 1944, and joined &quot;Hoel&quot; and the rest of DesRon 47 uniting the squadron for the first time.

&quot;Hoel&quot; then patrolled south and east of Cape Botiangen, New Hanover Island, where her guns destroyed an enemy warehouse 26 March 1944, and, the next day, captured documents which contained valuable information from a outrigger canoe. That night she made four depth charge runs on an underwater sound contact with unknown results. She returned to Purvis Bay on 8 April 1944 to screen a convoy carrying troops and supplies to Emirau Island.

Upon her return to Purvis Bay 14 April 1944, &quot;Hoel&quot; reported for duty to Rear Admiral Robert W. Hayler, the commander of Cruiser Division 12 who kept her busy with training exercises and convoy duty until 14 August 1944, when she was assigned to the 3d Amphibious Force then preparing for the invasion of the Palaus. She joined at Espiritu Santo 24 August 1944, for passage to Purvis Bay. On 8 September 1944 they put to sea for the Palau Islands with Rear Admiral W. D. Sample&#x27;s escort carrier task force unit to provide air support during the invasion of Peleliu. While continuing to screen the escort carriers, she rescued a pilot and passenger from an aircraft that had gone into the sea on attempting to take off from and transferred them to Marcus Island. On 1 October 1944, &quot;Hoel&quot; made three depth charge runs on an underwater sound contact with unknown results.

===Taffy 3===
After replenishing at Seeadler Harbor of Manus, Admiralty Islands, &quot;Hoel&quot; cleared that base with a fire support group 12 October 1944 to join Rear Admiral Thomas L. Sprague&#x27;s escort carrier group (Task Group 77.4) in invading the Philippines. Sprague&#x27;s force was composed of three units, each comprising a group of escort carriers and a screen of destroyers and destroyer escorts. These units, known by their radio calls as the &quot;Three Taffys&quot;, began operating off Samar 18 October 1944 to cover the landings on Leyte. &quot;Hoel&quot; was attached to &quot;Taffy 3&quot; (Escort Carrier Task Unit 77.4.3) commanded by Rear Admiral Clifton A. F. Sprague and comprising four escort carriers guarded by destroyers &quot;Hoel&quot;, &quot;Heermann&quot;, and &quot;Johnston&quot;. Before the Battle off Samar, &quot;Taffy 3&quot; was reinforced by the arrival of Admiral Ralph A. Ofstie with two more escort carriers and , , , and .

=== Battle off Samar ===

Dawn of 25 October 1944 found &quot;Taffy 3&quot; steaming northeast of Samar operating as the Northern Air Support Group. &quot;Taffy 2&quot; was in the central position patrolling off the entrance to Leyte Gulf, and &quot;Taffy 1&quot; covered the southern approaches to the Gulf some 150 miles (240 km) to the southeast of &quot;Hoel&quot;″s &quot;Taffy 3&quot;. Rear Admiral Clifton A. F. Sprague was under the erroneous impression that Admiral William Halsey&#x27;s 3d Fleet was providing protection to the north and so was taken by surprise when at 06:45 &quot;Taffy 3&quot;&#x27;s lookouts observed anti-aircraft fire to the northward and within three minutes were under heavy fire from Vice Admiral Takeo Kurita&#x27;s powerful Center Force of 4 battleships, 6 heavy cruisers, 2 light cruisers, and 11 destroyers.

==== Initial charge and damage ====
The only chance for survival of the little group of American &quot;Jeep&quot; carriers and &quot;tin cans&quot; lay in running to the east long enough to launch what aircraft could be readied before fleeing to the south hoping that aid would arrive before their complete destruction. While the carriers launched all available aircraft to attack their numerous Japanese adversaries and then formed a rough circle as they turned toward Leyte Gulf, &quot;Hoel&quot; and her fellow destroyers &quot;Johnston&quot; and &quot;Heermann&quot;, worked feverishly to lay down a smoke screen to hide their &quot;baby flattops&quot; from the overwhelmingly superior enemy ships. At 07:06, when a providential rain squall helped to hide his carriers, Admiral Clifton Sprague boldly ordered his destroyers to attack the Japanese with torpedoes. &quot;Hoel&quot; instantly obeyed this order by heading straight for the nearest enemy battleship, , then away. When she had closed to she opened fire as she continued her race toward &quot;Kongō. Kongō&quot; in turn failed to spot &quot;Hoel&quot;, as she was blinded by a rain squall.

However, at 10,300 yards, the Japanese heavy cruiser &quot;Haguro&quot; spotted a US &quot;cruiser&quot; attempting a torpedo charge and fired a full broadside of ten 8-inch (203 mm) guns. &quot;Haguro&#x27;s&quot; target was none other than &quot;Hoel,&quot; which she mistook for a cruiser due to the poor weather and reports that Kurita&#x27;s fleet was facing American fleet carriers. Raining fire, &quot;Hoel&quot; was immediately hit on the first salvo as two 8-inch (203 mm) shells from &quot;Haguro&quot; sliced through her bridge and main battery director, disabling her FD radar, PPI scope, machine gun control, and radio communications. On her second salvo, &quot;Haguro&quot; hit &quot;Hoel&quot; with another 8-inch (203 mm) shell which hit above her number 1 fire room, but inflicted no significant damage as &quot;Hoel&quot; charged on. Had these shells exploded, &quot;Hoel&quot; would have been significantly more damaged, but &quot;Haguro&quot; mistook her for a cruiser and fired AP shells that overpenetrated her unarmored hull without exploding. 

In response, &quot;Hoel&quot; fired five torpedoes at &quot;Kongō&quot;, but right afterwards she was hit simultaneously by three more 8-inch (203 mm) shells from &quot;Haguro,&quot; the first two hit below the waterline and cut through her engine room and fire room, while the third started a fire in the handing room for her number 3 5-inch (127 mm) turret, the fire was extinguished in 3 minutes, but it still took the turret out of action. Had this shell exploded, it likely would have detonated &quot;Hoel&#x27;s&quot; magazines. The port engine and after generator were also destroyed, dropping her speed by 4.5 knots. On her fourth salvo, &quot;Haguro&quot; hit &quot;Hoel&quot; with three more 8-inch (203 mm) shells, one each hit and destroyed her turrets 4 and 5, while the third hit the stern and destroyed two 20 mm AA guns. Finally, a 5-inch (127 mm) shell from &quot;Haguro&#x27;s&quot; secondary battery exploded in her bow and caused minor flooding.

A total of nine 8-inch (203 mm) shells and one 5-inch (127 mm) shell destroyed three of &quot;Hoel&#x27;s&quot; five 5-inch (127 mm) gun, her port engine, after generator, bridge, and main battery director. Making things worse, &quot;Kongō&quot; spotted four of &quot;Hoel&#x27;s&quot; five torpedoes, but they were too far off to affect the ship as she continued in a straight line. US sources often state &quot;Kongō&quot; was forced to evade those torpedoes in a hard turn, loosing track of the escort carriers, but &quot;Kongo&#x27;s&quot; own records do not support this. Some historians wrote of a 14-inch (356 mm) shell destroying &quot;Hoel&#x27;s&quot; bridge, but her own records also fail to back up that claim.

==== Torpedo attack on Yamato ====
Horrifically scorched but not fully sunk, &quot;Hoel&quot; fired up a smokescreen and headed Southeast, regrouping with &quot;Heermann&quot;. At 7:50, the pair spotted what they believed to be a Japanese cruiser squadron led by &quot;Haguro&quot;. However, &quot;Hoel&#x27;s&quot; target was actually the followed by the other Japanese battleships, including Admiral Kurita&#x27;s flagship, the &quot;Yamato&quot;. &quot;Hoel&quot; engaged in a gun duel with the largest and most powerful battleship ever made, firing 250 rounds from her two remaining 5-inch (127 mm) guns over the course of several minutes while &quot;Yamato&quot; responded with her own battery of 5-inch (127 mm) dual purposed guns, &quot;Hoel&quot; was successfully undamaged, and despite her shredded fire control managed to hit &quot;Yamato&quot; with a pair of 5-inch (127 mm) shells that exploded inside one of her kitchens. As &quot;Hoel&quot; turned away, she fired her remaining five torpedoes at 8:53 which ran &quot;hot, straight and normal.&quot; This time her crew was rewarded by the sight of large columns of water alongside their target, seemingly signifying hits. This observation may have been illusory, as neither &quot;Haruna&quot; nor &quot;Haguro&quot; received torpedo damage and explosions may have been near miss bombs from the constant air attacks. They missed their intended target, &quot;Haruna&quot;, but swam straight into the direction of &quot;Yamato&quot; and &quot;Nagato&quot;. A few minutes later, &quot;Heermann&quot; fired two torpedoes at the same target, and both Japanese battleships were caught in between both spreads and forced out of the battle for an extended period of time, causing Admiral Kurita to lose control over the battlefield.

However, &quot;Hoel&quot; did not escape without damage, before turning away &quot;Nagato&quot; engaged a US &quot;cruiser&quot; and fired off her main and secondary battery. One of &quot;Nagato&#x27;s&quot; 5.5-inch (14 cm) shells destroyed &quot;Hoel&#x27;s&quot; forward engine and generator rooms, causing her to lose speed. Several more hit the ship&#x27;s superstructure and set her on fire, while one of &quot;Nagato&#x27;s&quot; 16.1-inch (41 cm) shells smashed through &quot;Hoel&#x27;s&quot; bow. The damage caused &quot;Hoel&quot; to further list 10 degrees to port.

==== Final moments ====
Out of torpedoes, &quot;Hoel&quot; limped to the escort carriers. Despite the horrific damage inflicted by &quot;Haguro&quot; and &quot;Nagato, Hoel&quot; still attempted to cover the escort carrier USS &quot;Gambier Bay&quot; from attacking Japanese ships. At this point, &quot;Yamato&quot; had returned to the battle and was shredding &quot;Gambier Bay&quot; with long range gunfire, but at 8:34 she noticed the crippled &quot;Hoel&quot; at 9,000 yards and pounced on the destroyer with her secondary battery. &quot;Hoel&quot; responded with her forward guns, but 6.1-inch (155 mm) gunfire got the better of her as a hit destroyed her last boiler, leaving &quot;Hoel&quot; dead in the water. The disabled destroyer quickly became an easy target as &quot;Yamato&quot; began to hit &quot;Hoel&quot; more frequently, she was set ablaze and set her forward magazines on fire as practically every function on the ship was disabled. After sustaining over 40 shell hits, at 8:40 &quot;Hoel&quot; listed at 20 degrees as the crew abandoned ship and left her to sink. The destroyer &quot;Isokaze&quot; inspected the sinking &quot;Hoel&quot;. Her crew wished to machine gun survivors as revenge for US pilots strafing Japanese survivors in the water. Captain Maeda, while half considering it, gave in to his conscious and ordered off an attack. Still, &quot;Isokaze&quot; sailed off without rescuing survivors as &quot;Hoel&quot; finally rolled over and sank at 8:55.

Only 86 of &quot;Hoel&quot;″s complement survived; 253 officers and men died with their ship, at least 40 of them dying in the water while awaiting rescue. Commander Kintberger described the courageous devotion to duty of the men of the &quot;Hoel&quot; in a seaman&#x27;s epitaph to the action: &quot;Fully cognizant of the inevitable result of engaging such vastly superior forces, these men performed their assigned duties coolly and efficiently until their ship was shot from under them.&quot; As they waited for rescue, the surviving crew watched a close up view of &quot;Yamato&quot; sailing right past them, which they described as “a ship so huge it takes your breath away.”. Nearly 48 hours after the destroyer’s demise, the American transport ships &quot;LCI-341&quot; and &quot;LCI-337&quot; each rescued &quot;Hoel&#x27;s&quot; survivors and brought them to Leyte Gulf for medical treatment and transfer back to the United States. 

== Awards and Memorials ==
In addition to the United States Presidential Unit Citation, &quot;Hoel&quot; received the Philippine Presidential Unit Citation and five battle stars for World War II service.

The William E. Taylor Division of the US Naval Sea Cadet Corps is named after Watertender 2nd Class William E. Taylor, a native of Wilmington, Delaware, who died on the USS &quot;Hoel&quot;. The division is based out of Kennett Square, Pennsylvania.

<text>Jeremiah Clemens (December 28, 1814 – May 21, 1865) was a United States senator and novelist from Alabama. A Southern Unionist, he opposed the secession of Alabama from the Union in 1861 but briefly served in the Confederate Army. He was the author of &quot;Tobias Wilson&quot;, one of the first novels set during the American Civil War.
==Biography==
Clemens was born at Huntsville, Alabama on December 28, 1814, the son of James and Sarah (Mills) Clemens. His parents migrated from Kentucky to what was then the Mississippi Territory in 1812, settling in what later became Madison County. Clemens was educated at LaGrange College and the University of Alabama, and later attended Transylvania University, where he studied law. In 1834, he married Mary L. Reed, the daughter of Huntsville merchant John Reed. Around the same time, he enlisted in the United States Army and participated in military action against the Cherokee Nation percipient to the Trail of Tears.

Clemens joined the Democratic Party and was appointed the United States Attorney for northern and middle Alabama by President Martin Van Buren in 1839. The same year, he was elected to the Alabama House of Representatives, serving from 1839 to 1841. He served in the Texian Army following the Texas Revolution, and was subsequently elected to the United States House of Representatives, serving from 1843 to 1845. Following the U.S. annexation of Texas, Clemens volunteered again for the army and served in the Mexican–American War; he left the army in 1848 with the rank of colonel.

Clemens was elected to the United States Senate in 1849 to fill the vacancy left by the death of Dixon Hall Lewis. Although a Democrat, Clemens owed his election to the support of Alabama&#x27;s Whigs. He opposed the Compromise of 1850, but abruptly changed course following its passage and helped to organize the short-lived Union Party in Alabama. The Unionists swept the 1851 elections in Alabama, carrying two-thirds of the state&#x27;s counties; however, Clemens was not re-elected to the Senate when his term ended in 1853. Dogged by accusations that he had purchased Whig support for his senatorial candidacy in 1848 with promises to back President Zachary Taylor&#x27;s legislative agenda, and having earned the enmity of Alabama&#x27;s Democrats by supporting the Union Party movement, he retired to his plantation with his public reputation severely damaged.

Following his departure from the Senate, Clemens joined the Know Nothing movement and was an unsuccessful candidate for the House of Representatives that year on the American Party ticket. He supported former President Millard Fillmore in the 1856 United States presidential election, campaigning on his behalf across northern Alabama, but the state voted for Democrat James Buchanan. Following this last defeat, Clemens retired from public life. He began a literary career, publishing three novels between 1856 and 1860: &quot;Bernard Lile&quot; (1856), &quot;Mustang Gray&quot; (1858), and &quot;The Rivals&quot; (1859). The secession crisis following the election of Abraham Lincoln prompted Clemens&#x27;s reentry to politics in the winter of 1860–61. Clemens denounced secession in the pages of the &quot;Montgommery Advertiser&quot; and as a delegate to the 1861 secession convention. When the delegates voted in favor of secession, however, Clemens reluctantly signed the ordinance announcing Alabama&#x27;s departure from the Union. He accepted a commission in the Alabama militia, but his ambivalence towards the Confederate cause led him to resign within the year. In 1862, he crossed into Union lines and became Alabama&#x27;s foremost Southern Unionist. His fourth novel, &quot;Tobias Wilson&quot;, describes Unionist guerilla warfare in northern Alabama. The war had a radicalizing effect on Clemens&#x27;s politics, and he became an outspoken defender of the Lincoln Administration. Clemens strongly supported Lincoln&#x27;s re-election in the 1864 presidential campaign and traveled to Washington, D.C. to write campaign literature in support of Lincoln&#x27;s National Union Party. Following Lincolns&#x27; assassination, Clemens urged his successor, fellow Southern Unionist Andrew Johnson, urging him to complete the abolition of slavery in the United States, but died on May 21, 1865 before he could take an active role in Reconstruction.

==Novels==
Clemens was most famous outside of Alabama during his lifetime as a novelist. &quot;Bernard Lile&quot; (Philadelphia, 1856) and &quot;Mustang Grey&quot; (1857) were at least partly autobiographical novels set in the Texas War of Independence and the Mexican–American War and both received critical acclaim at the time of their release. &quot;The Rivals&quot; (1859) was a novelization of the enmity between Aaron Burr and Alexander Hamilton. His final novel, &quot;Tobias Wilson&quot;, published posthumously in 1865, was an account of Unionist partisans who fought during the Civil War in the mountains of Alabama near Clemens&#x27; hometown of Huntsville. He was engaged in the preparation of a history of the war, giving an insight into the character, causes, and conduct of the war in northern Alabama, but it was left unfinished at his death.

==Family==
Jeremiah Clemens was a distant cousin of Samuel Langhorne Clemens, better known as Mark Twain.

<text>A Wartenberg wheel, also called a Wartenberg pinwheel or Wartenberg neurowheel, is a medical device for neurological use. The wheel was designed to test nerve reactions (sensitivity) as it rolled systematically across the skin. A Wartenberg wheel is generally made of stainless steel with a handle of approximately in length. The wheel, which has evenly spaced radiating sharp pins, rotates as it is rolled across the flesh. A disposable plastic version is available. Because of hygienic concerns, these devices are rarely used for medical purposes.

Robert Wartenberg, namesake of the Wartenberg wheel, is sometimes incorrectly credited as its inventor. According to Wartenberg himself, the device was in widespread use in Europe when he lived in Germany. While he did not invent it, he found it &quot;an indispensable part of the outfit for everyday neurologic practice,&quot; and recommended its use to his colleagues in the US.

The Wartenberg wheel is also used as a sensation sex toy, and is often used to tickle a person (also called a ‘lee, short for “ticklee”) in the act of tickle fetishism. It is sometimes used in other settings while connected to a violet wand electrical device. 

Clothing pattern-making can use a version of the Wartenberg wheel, called a pounce wheel, to transfer markings from paper to fabric. Pounce wheels resemble standard Wartenberg wheels in shape but have wooden or plastic handles.

<doc id="844256" wikidata="Q324440" url="?curid=844256" title="Sprague Cleghorn">
<text>Henry William Sprague &quot;Peg&quot; Cleghorn (March 11, 1890 – July 12, 1956), also known as &quot;The Big Train&quot;, was a Canadian professional ice hockey player from Westmount, Quebec who played 17 professional seasons between 1911 and 1929 for the Renfrew Creamery Kings and Montreal Wanderers in the National Hockey Association (NHA) and the Ottawa Senators, Montreal Canadiens and Boston Bruins in the National Hockey League (NHL). He was a member of three Stanley Cup championship teams, winning with the Senators in 1920 and 1921 as well as with the Canadiens in 1924. His brother Odie was also a professional player and the two played several seasons together.

A tough and physical defenceman, Cleghorn had a reputation for violent play; he was twice charged with assault following on-ice incidents and was subject to efforts to have him banned from the NHL. His reputation made him an effective defender, and he used his offensive skill to become one of hockey&#x27;s first offensive defencemen. At the time of his retirement, Cleghorn&#x27;s 169 career goals were second most in professional hockey history by a defenceman, behind Harry Cameron&#x27;s 173. He was inducted into the Hockey Hall of Fame in 1958.

==Early playing career==

Cleghorn was born in the Westmount area of Montreal in 1890, to William John and Harriet Isabella (née Ogilvie) Cleghorn. He attended Westmount Academy and played on junior and amateur Montreal Westmount teams until 1909. In the 1909–10 season, he played for the New York Wanderers of the American Amateur Hockey League and scored seven goals in eight games from the center forward position. He was scouted by the Renfrew Creamery Kings of the National Hockey Association (NHA) and signed a contract, along with his brother Odie, to play with them for the 1910–11 NHA season. Sprague appeared in 12 games, scored five goals and registered 27 penalty minutes. During the season, he switched from winger to defence, as his coach, Alf Smith, felt his presence was better in that position. Cleghorn enjoyed rushing the puck forward and developed into an offensive defenceman.

The Cleghorn brothers moved to the Montreal Wanderers in 1911–12, where they spent the next six seasons. With the Wanderers he established a reputation as a fierce competitor with an explosive temper. He was also an offensive leader for the Wanderers. Cleghorn frequently carried the puck the length of the ice surface to generate scoring chances: in one game in 1913 he scored five goals against the Toronto Ontarios, and during the 1914–15 season he led the NHA with 12 assists and also scored 21 goals. Cleghorn would often retaliate violently against opposing players he felt were taking liberties on his teammates, especially his brother Odie. Once, in 1912, he struck opponent Newsy Lalonde in the back of his head after the latter had cross-checked Odie. For this he was fined and suspended from the league. He also faced a charge of aggravated assault for which he paid a $50 fine. In a January 1917 game against the Toronto Blueshirts, Cleghorn collided with Ken Randall and crashed feet first into the boards. He sustained a broken ankle that ended his season. While recovering from his injury later in 1917, Cleghorn suffered another fall while walking an icy street in Montreal and fractured his other ankle. The injuries forced him to miss the entire 1917–18 season, and cast doubts on his future in hockey.

==NHL career==

After the Montreal Arena burned down in 1918, Cleghorn&#x27;s rights were claimed in a dispersion draft of the Wanderers team by Ottawa Senators general manager Tommy Gorman, who paid for Cleghorn&#x27;s transportation to Ottawa. After recovering from his leg injury, he played for the Senators in 1918–19 and registered 13 points in 18 games. The next season, he played in a defensive pair with Eddie Gerard and scored 21 points in 21 regular season games and one point in five playoff games. That season the Senators defeated the Seattle Metropolitans to win the Stanley Cup. In an attempt at league parity, the NHL transferred him to the Hamilton Tigers in December 1920, but Cleghorn refused to report to the Tigers. The Senators asked that he be allowed to return to their team, for which George Kennedy, owner of the Montreal Canadiens, threatened to have Ottawa thrown out of the league. Cleghorn eventually signed with the Toronto St. Patricks, playing with them for the regular season in which the team won the NHL&#x27;s second half championship. As the management became discontented with his play, he was eventually released from the club in March after the St. Pats lost the play-offs. He returned to Ottawa during their playoff series in time to be a member of the 1921 Stanley Cup-winning team. The league again attempted to transfer Cleghorn to Hamilton in 1921, but he again refused to report. Just before the start of the 1921–22 NHL season, Hamilton traded him to the Montreal Canadiens for Harry Mummery and Amos Arbour.

On the Canadiens, Cleghorn was reunited with his brother, Odie. In his first season with his new team, he scored 17 goals and had nine assists in 24 games. Towards the end of the season, he was named captain of the team. The Canadiens made the Stanley Cup playoffs every year over the next three seasons. He played alongside Billy Coutu, and the pair established a reputation as one of the most feared defensive pairs in the league. On Jan. 14, 1922, Sprague and Odie each scored 4 goals in a 10–6 victory for the Montreal Canadiens over the Hamilton Tigers. In a 1923 playoff series, against his former team, the Ottawa Senators (whom he had grown to despise), Cleghorn struck Senators defenceman Lionel Hitchman in the head with his stick. He was charged with aggravated assault, found guilty and fined $50. The incident enraged Canadiens owner, Leo Dandurand, who suspended him from the roster for the remainder of the playoffs. In another incident with the Senators in 1922, he initiated a brawl during which he injured three players, Eddie Gerard, Frank Nighbor and Cy Denneny. The Ottawa management attempted to have him expelled from the league, and a referee described him as a &quot;disgrace to the game&quot;. In 1923–24, the Canadiens won their first Stanley Cup in the NHL. It was the third championship of Cleghorn&#x27;s career. After the following season, Montreal sold him to the Boston Bruins for $5000. He played three seasons with the Bruins and acted as their unofficial captain. In his final season with the Bruins, 1927–28, he also served as an assistant coach. During his time in Boston, he served as a veteran presence on the team and as a mentor to future Hall of Fame defenceman Eddie Shore.

==Post-retirement career==
After his retirement as a player, Cleghorn took to coaching. He joined the Newark Bulldogs of the Canadian-American Hockey League (CAHL) as a player-manager from 1928 to 1929. During this time he acquired his former Montreal teammate, Billy Coutu, to serve as his defensive partner. A newspaper at the time stated that the move &quot;reunit[ed] the most formidable defence that ever played hockey&quot;. In the 1930–31 season, he coached the CAHL&#x27;s Providence Reds, and in 1931–32 he was named head coach of the NHL&#x27;s Montreal Maroons. That season, the Maroons racked up 19 wins and 22 losses, finished third in the Canadian Division and made the Stanley Cup playoffs. The team was eliminated in the semifinals by the eventual champions, the Toronto Maple Leafs.

Cleghorn was hired in 1935 by the Pittsburgh Shamrocks of the International Hockey League (IHL), but was fired by the team near the end of the season over a dispute with club president Ray Babcock over the payment of his salary. He was replaced by Albert Hughes, the team&#x27;s captain, for their 11 remaining games. According to media reports, Cleghorn refused to leave with the team for a game in Windsor because he claimed that the team had not been paid three days earlier. However, the Shamrocks&#x27; ownership stated that the reason Cleghorn did not accompany the Shamrocks team on their trip was because he had to be disciplined for &quot;misconduct covering the past month&quot;. On March 14, 1936, Cleghorn filed a lawsuit against the Shamrocks&#x27; ownership, claiming that he was owed $420.50 in salary since March 2 and a $1,000 bonus, as per his contract. His final coaching stint was with the Cornwall Cougars of the Quebec Provincial Hockey League. He was appointed to the position September 30, 1947, and served for a little over a month. After his team went winless in their first six games and having just suffered an 11–0 defeat at home, he was fired on November 14.

==Playing style==
Known for both his intense competitive nature and violent temper, Cleghorn was considered one of the toughest and dirtiest players of his time. Respected by his teammates and hated by his opponents, Cleghorn often used his stick as a weapon and was routinely among his team&#x27;s leaders in both goals and penalty minutes. He claimed to have been involved in at least fifty incidents during his career in which a player left the ice on a stretcher. In the season when Ottawa unsuccessfully attempted to have him banned from the NHL, Cleghorn led the league in penalty minutes with 80. According to some accounts, Evelyn Byng, Viscountess Byng of Vimy, was so mortified by Cleghorn&#x27;s style that she donated the Lady Byng Trophy to the NHL in 1924 in a bid to encourage more sportsmanlike play.

Cleghorn&#x27;s physicality made him a feared defender away from the puck and he was regarded as one of his era&#x27;s top defencemen. His ability to rush the puck forward also made him a scoring threat; Cleghorn was one of hockey&#x27;s first offensive defencemen. He once scored five goals in an NHA game in 1913, and had a career best 21 goals in 19 games in 1914–15. He retired in 1928 with 169 career goals, at the time the second most by a defenceman in professional hockey history, behind only Harry Cameron. &quot;The Hockey News&quot; ranked Cleghorn as the 88th greatest player of all-time in its 1998 book, &quot;The Top 100 NHL players of All-Time&quot;. He was inducted into the Hockey Hall of Fame in 1958.

==Personal life==
On May 8, 1911 in New York, Cleghorn married Evelyn Irene Mabie, whom he had met while playing with the Wanderers. He was arrested in 1918 for beating his wife with a crutch while he was recovering from his ankle injuries. The couple divorced in 1921, after Cleghorn was found by his wife with another woman after she had reported him as missing. He was ordered by a judge to pay alimony of $1,000 per month to his ex-wife. Cleghorn later remarried twice, with his second marriage also ending in divorce. His third wife, Vivian Goudreau, predeceased him on December 18, 1943.

Cleghorn was hit by a motorist on his way to work on June 29, 1956 on Commissioners Street in Montreal. He sustained head injuries and a fractured cervical vertebrae. Two weeks later, on July 12, 1956, he died of his injuries at St. Luc Hospital. He was 66, and was survived by his brother Odie and three sisters. His funeral was held at First Presbyterian Church in Montreal on July 14 and he was buried at Mount Royal Cemetery. Upon his death, his brother, Odie remarked, &quot;He was my brother, and I don&#x27;t like to boast, but I never saw a tougher or better defenceman than Sprague.&quot; Two days later, Odie died in his sleep of heart failure and was found by his sister just hours before Sprague&#x27;s funeral.

<text>Clement Claiborne Clay (December 13, 1816 – January 3, 1882), also known as C. C. Clay Jr., was a United States Senator (Democrat) from the state of Alabama from 1853 to 1861, and a Confederate States senator from Alabama from 1862 to 1864. His portrait appeared on the Confederate one-dollar note (4th issue and later).

He and his father, who was a governor of Alabama and also a U.S. senator, were among the state&#x27;s most prominent enslavers, according to the &quot;Washington Post&quot;. Together the two men enslaved 87 people on four Alabama plantations as recorded in the 1860 census.

==Biography==

===Early life===
Clement Claiborne Clay was born to Clement Comer Clay and Susanna Claiborne Withers, the daughter of well-off planter John Withers, in Huntsville, Alabama. He had a strong political pedigree as the oldest son of U. S. Senator and Alabama Governor Clement Comer Clay. He was also a third cousin of Henry Clay, the noted statesman from Kentucky. John Withers Clay, proprietor and editor of the &quot;Huntsville Weekly Democrat&quot;, and Hugh Lawson Clay, who served in the military, were his brothers.

Clay attended the Huntsville Green Academy, then studied at the University of Alabama at Tuscaloosa in 1833–1834. In August 1834, at the age seventeen, he received an A.B. degree. He served as his father&#x27;s secretary in 1835–1837 after Clement Clay, Sr. was elected as a governor of Alabama. In 1837, he and his brother John Withers Clay both entered the University of Virginia; their brother Hugh Lawson Clay joined them later. In July 1839, Clay obtained a Bachelor of Laws degree after studying with John B. Minor, known for his rigor, and was admitted to the Alabama Bar on October 2, 1839.

===Marriage and family===
On February 1, 1843, he married Virginia Tunstall, who was then 18 years old. They had one child, who died stillborn.

After Clement&#x27;s death in 1882, his widow remarried to David Clopton, a judge, and was known as Virginia Clay-Clopton. Clay-Clopton wrote &quot;Belle of the Fifties&quot;, a memoir with New York journalist Ada Sterling, published in 1904 and re-issued in 1905. &quot;Belle&quot; was one of three memoirs by southern women particularly recommended by the United Daughters of the Confederacy to its membership for studying. Clay-Clopton&#x27;s book became part of the discourse about the Lost Cause and the burnished memory of the antebellum South.

===Career===

In 1839–1846, Clay practiced law in a family law firm; in 1846–1848 he served as Madison County judge. Clay was a member of the Alabama State House of Representatives in 1842, and in 1844–1845. He ran for the United States Congress in 1850, but did not succeed, losing to incumbent Williamson Robert Winfield Cobb.

In 1853, Clay was elected by the Alabama legislature to serve in the United States Senate in a term beginning March 4, 1853; and was re-elected in 1857. Due to the legislature&#x27;s delay in filling the position, he served from November 29, 1853, to January 21, 1861. In the Senate, he defended the state&#x27;s rights during the political debates of the time, and opposed Henry Clay. After the 1860 presidential election, Alabama seceded from the Union on January 11, 1861, before the American Civil War broke out. On January 21, six men, including Clay, resigned their seats in the United States Senate. Most made brief and temperate speeches.

Clay, however, delivered an impassioned justification for secession and a denunciation of the Northern anti-slavery Republican Party. He denounced its resistance to the Fugitive Slave Act and the spread of slavery into the territories. &quot;No sentiment is more insulting or more hostile to our domestic tranquility, to our social order, and to our social existence, than is contained in the declaration that our negroes are entitled to liberty and equality with the white man,&quot; Clay said. He described the election of Abraham Lincoln to the presidency as a hostile act against the Southern people which left them with no recourse other than secession in order to defend their liberty, honor, and safety.

Clay was subsequently elected by the Alabama Confederate legislature as Senator in the First Confederate Congress. He served there from 1862 until 1864 acting as a supporter of Jefferson Davis.
Along with Jacob Thompson, Clay was a part of the Confederate War Department effort to create a network of secret agents to conduct espionage and sabotage.

In May 1864, president Davis sent Clay to Canada with a secret mission to coordinate activities of the Southern sympathizers in the Great Lakes area, including members of the Order of the Sons of Liberty and the Knights of the Golden Circle. Clay took part in a secret meeting with John Hay, President Abraham Lincoln&#x27;s aide, at Niagara Falls, Canada.

It was suspected that Thompson and Clay had employed John Wilkes Booth for some services before he assassinated President Abraham Lincoln. President Andrew Johnson signed an order to arrest Clay. After learning from a newspaper that a reward was issued for his capture, Clay, who initially planned to escape to Mexico, turned himself in to General James H. Wilson in Macon, Georgia, in May 1865. He was arrested and held in Fort Monroe in Hampton, Virginia, until April 1866. Former Confederate president Jefferson Davis was also held in Fort Monroe, but was never tried; he was released in 1867.

===Postwar years===
Clay was imprisoned by the United States government under impression that he was involved in the plot to assassinate President Abraham Lincoln. Virginia Clay played some role in her husband&#x27;s release as she went to Washington, D.C., and personally pleaded with President Johnson.

A viewpoint that Johnson&#x27;s role in Clay&#x27;s release was an act worthy of being among the charges for impeaching Johnson was voiced in the December 1867 Thomas Williams-authored majority report of House Committee on the Judiciary published at the conclusion of first impeachment inquiry against Andrew Johnson.

The Clays returned to Alabama and struggled to rebuild their lives living on a farm. Clay tried to practice as an attorney and entered insurance business in Huntsville, however without much success due to poor health, ultimately returning to his farm in January 1882. He died later that year in Madison County, besieged by debts and health problems, and is interred at Maple Hill Cemetery.

<doc id="844260" wikidata="Q5961525" url="?curid=844260" title="Generalized hypoxia">
<text>Generalized hypoxia is a medical condition in which the tissues of the body are deprived of the necessary levels of oxygen due to an insufficient supply of oxygen, which may be due to the composition or pressure of the breathing gas, decreased lung ventilation, or respiratory disease, any of which may cause a lower than normal oxygen content in the arterial blood, and consequently a reduced supply of oxygen to all tissues perfused by the arterial blood. This usage is distinct from localized hypoxia, in which only an associated group of tissues, usually with a common blood supply, are affected, usually due to an insufficient or reduced blood supply to those tissues. Generalized hypoxia is also used as a synonym for hypoxic hypoxia This is not to be confused with hypoxemia, which refers to low levels of oxygen in the blood, although the two conditions often occur simultaneously, since a decrease in blood oxygen typically corresponds to a decrease in oxygen in the surrounding tissue. However, hypoxia may be present without hypoxemia, and vice versa, as in the case of infarction. Several other classes of medical hypoxia exist.

== Causes ==
Hypoxia can result from various causes which can be categorised as: anemic hypoxia, cellular hypoxia, generalised, or hypoxic hypoxia, pulmonary hypoxia, stagnant hypoxia, increased oxygen consumption due to a hypermetabolic state, or any combination of these. The three fundamental causes of hypoxia at the tissue level are low oxygen content in the blood (hypoxemia), low perfusion of the tissue, and inability of the tissue to extract and use the oxygen in the blood. Generalised, or hypoxic hypoxia may be caused by:
*Hypoventilation – failure of the respiratory pump due to any cause (fatigue, barbiturate poisoning, pneumothorax, etc.)
*Low-inspired oxygen partial pressure, which may be caused by breathing air at low ambient pressures due to altitude, by breathing hypoxic breathing gas at an unsuitable depth, by breathing inadequately re-oxygenated recycled breathing gas from a rebreather, life support system, or anesthetic machine, or hypoxia of ascent in freediving.
*Airway obstruction, choking, drowning.
*Abnormal pulmonary function
**Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD)
**Neuromuscular diseases or interstitial lung disease
*Malformed vascular system such as an anomalous coronary artery

===Altitude effects===

When breathing the ambient air at high altitudes (above 3048 metres/10,000 feet), the human body experiences altitude sickness and hypoxemia due to a low partial pressure of oxygen, decreasing the carriage of oxygen by hemoglobin.
* Above 3000 metres (10,000 feet) - ambient pressure 69.7kPa, about 14.6kPa partial pressure of oxygen – enough hypoxic stimulation to cause increased ventilation
* Above 3700 metres (12,000 feet) - 64.4kPa, about 13.52kPa PO2 – first irritability appears
* Above 5500 metres (18,000 feet) - 50.6kPa, about 10.6kPa PO2 – severe symptoms
* Above 7600 metres (25,000 feet) - ambient pressure 37.6kPa absolute, 7.9kPa partial pressure of oxygen – consciousness lost

While breathing pure oxygen at ambient pressure, from an oxygen cylinder or other source, the maximum altitude a human can tolerate while their body is at atmospheric pressure is 13,700 metres (45,000 feet), , where atmospheric pressure is about 14.7kPa. This is a function of the partial pressure of oxygen in the breathing gas, and is also dependent on level of exertion which affects the oxygen requirements of metabolism, cardiovascular fitness, and acclimatization to altitude which affects the available hemoglobin and can vary significantly between individuals. 

==Signs and symptoms==

* Cyanosis
* Headache
* Decreased reaction time, disorientation, and uncoordinated movement.
* Impaired judgment, confusion, memory loss and cognitive problems.
* Euphoria or dissociation
* Visual impairment
* Lightheaded or dizzy sensation, vertigo
* Fatigue, Drowsiness or tiredness
* Shortness of breath
* Palpitations may occur in the initial phases. Later, the heart rate may reduce significantly degree. In severe cases, abnormal heart rhythms may develop.
* Nausea and vomiting
* Initially raised blood pressure followed by lowered blood pressure as the condition progresses.
* Severe hypoxia can cause loss of consciousness, seizures or convulsions, coma and eventually death. Breathing rate may slow down and become shallow and the pupils may not respond to light.
* Tingling in fingers and toes
* Numbness

==Treatment==
Generalized hypoxia is an effect of a lack of oxygen, and in many cases of a one-time event can be reversed simply by eliminating the lack. Where there is no underlying pathology, provision of oxygen at normobaric partial pressure (about 0.21 bar) is usually sufficient to reverse minor symptoms. Where there is a pathology causing the hypoxia, treatment of the underlying pathology is often effective. 
*Oxygen therapy and hyperbaric medicine can improve saturation of oxygen in the blood which will stop hypoxia if it is caused by hypoxemia, i.e. low levels of oxygen in the blood. 
*Artificial ventilation may be required where the person is unable to breathe sufficiently unaided.
*Continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) mask may be used to treat sleep apnea.
*Bilevel positive airway pressure (BIPAP) may be used to treat chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), and some kinds of sleep apnea.
*Supplemental oxygen by mask or nasal tubes may be provided to treat chronic hypoxia.
*Inhaled steroids that can dilate the airways may be used to treat asthma or other lung disease.
*Diuretics may be used to reduce edema in and around the lungs.

==Other types of medical hypoxia==

*Hypoxemic hypoxia is a low oxygen tension in the arterial blood, due to the inability of the lungs to sufficiently oxygenate the blood. Causes include hypoventilation, impaired alveolar diffusion, and pulmonary shunting. This definition overlaps considerably with that of hypoxic hypoxia.
*Pulmonary hypoxia occurs when the lungs receive adequately oxygenated gas which does not reach the blood in sufficient quantities. It may be caused by:
**Ventilation perfusion mismatch,
**Pulmonary shunt
*Circulatory hypoxia, ischemic hypoxia or stagnant hypoxia may be caused by abnormally low blood flow to the lungs, which can occur during shock, cardiac arrest, severe congestive heart failure, or abdominal compartment syndrome, where the main dysfunction is in the cardiovascular system, causing a major reduction in perfusion. Arterial gas is adequately oygenated in the lungs, and the tissues are able to accept the oxygen available, but the flow rate to the tissues is insufficient. Venous oxygenation is particularly low.
*Anemic hypoxia or hypemic hypoxia is the lack of capacity of the blood to carry the normal level of oxygen. It can be caused by anemia or:
**Carbon monoxide poisoning
**Methemoglobinemia
*Cellular hypoxia occurs when the cells are unable to extract sufficient oxygen from normally oxygenated hemoglobin.
*Histotoxic hypoxia (Dysoxia) occurs when oxygen is transported to the tissues but they cannot use it effectively because the cells cannot extract oxygen from the blood. This is seen in cyanide poisoning.

<text>A letter of credit (LC), also known as a documentary credit or bankers commercial credit, or letter of undertaking (LoU), is a payment mechanism used in international trade to provide an economic guarantee from a creditworthy bank to an exporter of goods. Letters of credit are used extensively in the financing of international trade, when the reliability of contracting parties cannot be readily and easily determined. Its economic effect is to introduce a bank as an underwriter that assumes the counterparty risk of the buyer paying the seller for goods.

Typically, after a sales contract has been negotiated, and the buyer and seller have agreed that a letter of credit will be used as the method of payment, the &quot;applicant&quot; will contact a bank to ask for a letter of credit to be issued. Once the &quot;issuing bank&quot; has assessed the buyer&#x27;s credit risk, it will issue the letter of credit, meaning that it will provide a promise to pay the seller upon presentation of certain documents. Once the &quot;beneficiary&quot; (the seller) receives the letter of credit, it will check the terms to ensure that it matches with the contract and will either arrange for shipment of the goods or ask for an amendment to the letter of credit so that it meets with the terms of the contract. The letter of credit is limited in terms of time, the validity of credit, the last date of shipment, and how late after shipment the documents may be presented to the &quot;nominated bank&quot;.

Once the goods have been shipped, the beneficiary will present the requested documents to the nominated bank. This bank will check the documents, and if they comply with the terms of the letter of credit, the issuing bank is bound to honor the terms of the letter of credit by paying the beneficiary.

If the documents do not comply with the terms of the letter of credit they are considered &quot;discrepant&quot;. At this point, the nominated bank will inform the beneficiary of the discrepancy and offer a number of options depending on the circumstances after consent of applicant. However, such a discrepancy must be more than trivial. Refusal cannot depend on anything other than reasonable examination of the documents themselves. The bank then must rely on the fact that there was, in fact, a material mistake. A fact that if true would entitle the buyer to reject the items. A wrong date such as an early delivery date was held by English courts to not be a material mistake. If the discrepancies are minor, it may be possible to present corrected documents to the bank to make the presentation compliant. Failure of the bank to pay is grounds for a chose in action. Documents presented after the time limits mentioned in the credit, however, are considered discrepant.

If the corrected documents cannot be supplied in time, the documents may be forwarded directly to the issuing bank &quot;in trust&quot;; effectively in the hope that the applicant will accept the documents. Documents forwarded in trust remove the payment security of a letter of credit so this route must only be used as a last resort.

Some banks will offer to &quot;Telex for approval&quot; or similar. This is where the nominated bank holds the documents, but sends a message to the issuing bank asking if discrepancies are acceptable. This is more secure than sending documents in trust.

== History ==
The letter of credit has been used in Europe since ancient times. Letters of credit were traditionally governed by internationally recognized rules and procedures rather than by national law. The International Chamber of Commerce oversaw the preparation of the first Uniform Customs and Practice for Documentary Credits (UCP) in 1933, creating a voluntary framework for commercial banks to apply to transactions worldwide.

In the late 19th century and early 20th century, travelers commonly carried a circular letter of credit issued by a relationship bank, which allowed the beneficiary to withdraw cash from other banks along their journey. This type of letter of credit was eventually replaced by traveler&#x27;s checks, credit cards and automated teller machines.

Although letters of credit first existed only as paper documents, they were regularly issued by telegraph in the late 19th century, and by telex in the latter half of the 20th century. Beginning in 1973 with the creation of SWIFT, banks began to migrate to electronic data interchange as a means of controlling costs, and in 1983 the UCP was amended to allow &quot;teletransmission&quot; of letters of credit. By the 21st century, the vast majority of LCs were issued in electronic form and entirely &quot;paperless&quot;. LCs were becoming more common. Marcell David Reich (commonly known as Marc Rich) popularised the use of letters of credit in the oil trade.

==Terminology==
UCP 600 (2007 Revision) regulates common market practice within the letter of credit market. It defines a number of terms related to letters of credit which categorise the various factors within any given transaction. These are crucial to understanding the role financial institutions play. These include:

* The &quot;applicant&quot; is the person or company who has requested the letter of credit to be issued; this will normally be the buyer.
* The &quot;beneficiary&quot; is the person or company who will be paid under the letter of credit; this will normally be the seller (UCP600 Article 2 defines the beneficiary as &quot;the party in whose favour a credit is issued&quot;).
*The &quot;issuing bank&quot; is the bank that issues the credit, usually following a request from an applicant.
*The &quot;nominated bank&quot; is a bank mentioned within the letter of credit at which the credit is available (in this respect, UCP600 Article 2 reads: &quot;Nominated bank means the bank with which the credit is available or any bank in the case of a credit available with any bank&quot;).
* The &quot;advising bank&quot; is the bank that will inform the beneficiary or their nominated bank of the credit, send the original credit to the beneficiary or their nominated bank, and provide the beneficiary or their nominated bank with any amendments to the letter of credit.
*&quot;Confirmation&quot; is an undertaking from a bank other than the issuing bank to pay the beneficiary for a &quot;complying presentation&quot;, allowing the beneficiary to further reduce payment risk, although confirmation is usually at an extra cost.
*A &quot;confirming bank&quot; is a bank other than the issuing bank that adds its confirmation to credit upon the issuing bank&#x27;s authorization or request thus providing more security to the beneficiary.
* A &quot;complying presentation&quot; is a set of documents that meet with the requirements of the letter of credit and all of the rules relating to letters of credit.

==Function==
A letter of credit is an important payment method in international trade and used worldwide. It is particularly useful where the buyer and seller may not know each other personally and are separated by distance, differing laws in each country, and different trading customs. It is a primary method in international trade to mitigate the risk a seller of goods takes when providing those goods to a buyer. It does this by ensuring that the seller is paid for presenting the documents which are specified in the contract for sale between the buyer and the seller. That is to say, a letter of credit is a payment method used to discharge the legal obligations for payment from the buyer to the seller, by having a bank pay the seller directly. Thus, the seller relies on the credit risk of the bank, rather than the buyer, to receive payment. As will be seen, and is observed in Image 2, the bank will pay the seller the value of the goods when the seller provides negotiable instruments, documents which themselves represent the goods. Upon presentation of the documents, the goods will traditionally be in the control of the issuing bank, which provides them security against the risk that the buyer (who had instructed the bank to pay the seller) will repay the bank for making such a payment.

In the event that the buyer is unable to make payment on the purchase, the seller may make a demand for payment on the bank. The bank will examine the beneficiary&#x27;s demand and if it complies with the terms of the letter of credit, will honor the demand. Most letters of credit are governed by rules promulgated by the International Chamber of Commerce known as Uniform Customs and Practice for Documentary Credits. The current version, UCP 600, became effective July 1, 2007. Banks will typically require collateral from the purchaser for issuing a letter of credit and will charge a fee which is often a percentage of the amount covered by the letter of credit.

===Types===
Several categories of LCs exist which seek to operate in different markets and solve different issues. Examples of these include:
* Import vs export (commercial): The same credit can be termed an import or export letter of credit depending on whose perspective is considered. For the importer it is termed an &quot;import LC&quot; and for the exporter of goods an &quot;export LC&quot;.
* Revocable vs irrevocable: Whether an LC is revocable or irrevocable determines whether the buyer and the issuing bank are able to manipulate the LC or make corrections without informing or getting permissions from the seller. According to UCP 600, all LCs are irrevocable, hence in practice the revocable type of LC is increasingly obsolete. Any changes (amendment) or cancellation of the LC (except when expired) is done by the applicant (buyer) through the issuing bank. It must be authenticated and approved by the beneficiary (seller).
* Confirmed vs unconfirmed: An LC is said to be confirmed when a second bank adds its confirmation (or guarantee) to honor a complying presentation at the request or authorization of the issuing bank.
* Restricted vs unrestricted: Either the one advising bank can purchase a bill of exchange from the seller in the case of a restricted LC, or the confirmation bank is not specified, which means that the exporter can show the bill of exchange to any bank and receive a payment on an unrestricted LC.
* Deferred vs usance: A credit that is not paid or assigned immediately after presentation, but after an indicated period that is accepted by both buyer and seller. Typically, seller allows buyer to pay the required money after taking the related goods and selling them.

Additionally, a letter of credit may also have specific terms relating to the payment conditions which relate to the underlying reference documents. Some of these include 
* At sight: A credit that the announcer bank immediately pays after inspecting the carriage documents from the seller.
* Red clause: Before sending the products, seller can take the pre-paid part of the money from the bank. The first part of the credit is to attract the attention of the accepting bank. The first time the credit is established by the assigner bank, is to gain the attention of the offered bank. The terms and conditions were typically written in red ink, thus the name.
* Back-to-back: A pair of LCs in which one is to the benefit of a seller who is unable to provide the corresponding goods for unspecified reasons. In that event, a second credit is opened for another seller to provide the desired goods. Back-to-back is issued to facilitate intermediary trade. Intermediate companies such as trading houses are sometimes required to open LCs for suppliers and receive export LCs from buyers.
* Standby letter of credit (SBLC): Operates like a commercial letter of credit, except that typically it is retained as a &quot;standby&quot; instead of being the intended payment mechanism. In other words, this is an LC which is intended to provide a source of payment in the event of non-performance of contract. This is a security against an obligation which is not performed. If the bank is presented with demands of non-payment it is not a guarantee; the trigger is not non-payment but documentation. UCP600 Article 1 provides that the UCP applies to standby LCs; ISP98 applies specifically to standby letters of credit; and the United Nations Convention on Independent Guarantees and Standby Letters of Credit applies to a small number of countries that have ratified the convention.

====Transferability==== 
The exporter has the right to make the credit available to one or more subsequent beneficiaries. 
Credits are made transferable when the original beneficiary is a &quot;middleman&quot;, who does not supply the documents himself, but procures either goods or documents from other suppliers and arranges for them to be sent to the issuing bank. A letter of credit can be transferred to the second beneficiary at the request of the first beneficiary only if it expressly states that the letter of credit is &quot;transferable&quot;. A bank is not obligated to transfer a credit. It can further be transferred to more than one alternate beneficiary as long as it allows partial shipments.
The terms and conditions of the original credit must be replicated exactly in the transferred credit. However, to keep the workability of the transferable letter of credit, some figures can be reduced or curtailed, including:
* Amount
* Unit price of the merchandise (if stated)
* Expiry date
* Presentation period
* Latest shipment date or given period for shipment.
The first beneficiary may demand from the transferring bank to substitute for the applicant. However, if a document other than the invoice must be issued in a way to show the applicant&#x27;s name, in such a case that requirement must indicate that in the transferred credit it will be free. Transferred credit cannot be transferred again to a third beneficiary at the request of the second beneficiary.

In some cases, the middleman does not want the buyer and supplier to know each other. The middleman is entitled to substitute his own invoice for the supplier&#x27;s and acquire the difference as profit.

===Documents that may be requested===
To receive payment, an exporter or shipper must present the documents required by the LC. Typically the letter of credit will request an original bill of lading as the use of a title document such as this is critical to the functioning of the letter of credit. However, the list and form of documents is open to negotiation and might contain requirements to present documents issued by a neutral third-party evidencing the quality of the goods shipped, or their place of origin or place. Typical types of documents in such contracts might include:

*Financial documents — bill of exchange, co-accepted draft
*Commercial documents — invoice, packing list
*Shipping documents — bill of lading (ocean or multi-modal or charter party), airway bill, lorry/truck receipt, railway receipt, CMC other than mate receipt, forwarder cargo receipt 
*Official documents — license, embassy legalization, origin certificate, inspection certificate, phytosanitary certificate
*Insurance documents — insurance policy or certificate, but not a cover note.
The range of documents that may be requested by the applicant is vast and varies considerably by country and commodity.
Several methods of verifying the documents exist. A &quot;documentary credit&quot; provides security for both buyer and seller. Outlined in the &quot;UCP 600&quot;, the bank will give an undertaking (or promise), on behalf of buyer (who is often the applicant) to pay the beneficiary the value of the goods shipped if acceptable documents are submitted and if the stipulated terms and conditions are strictly complied with. The buyer can be confident that the goods he is expecting only will be received since it will be evidenced in the form of certain documents, meeting the specified terms and conditions. The supplier finds his confidence in the fact that if such stipulations are met, he will receive payment from the issuing bank, who is independent of the parties to the contract. 
In some cases, a letter of credit will require the documents to be collected. Another form of payment is the &quot;direct payment&quot; where the supplier ships the goods and waits for the buyer to pay, on open account terms.

===Risk exposure===
Letters of Credit are often used in international transactions to ensure that payment will be received where the buyer and seller may not know each other and are operating in different countries. In this case, the seller is exposed to a number of risks such as credit risk, and legal risk caused by the distance, differing laws and difficulty in knowing each party personally. Some of the other risks inherent in international trade include:

====Fraud====
The payment will be obtained for nonexistent or worthless merchandise against presentation by the beneficiary of forged or falsified documents.

====Legal risks====
There is the possibility that performance of a documentary credit may be disturbed by legal action relating directly to the parties and their rights and obligations under the documentary credit or performance may be prevented by government action outside the control of the parties. Alternatively, performance of a contract – including an obligation under a documentary credit relationship – could also be prevented by external factors such as natural disasters or armed conflicts. These risks, however, are often seen as secondary to the risk of non-payment.

====Applicant====
Several risks could relate to the parties of the applicant themselves. These may include situations where there is a non-delivery of Goods, Short shipment, the goods are of inferior quality, are damaged, or are late. The applicant is also exposed to the failure of the bank to make payment.

====Issuing bank====
The issuing bank is also exposed to risks which it may seek to mitigate through various techniques. It will be exposed to the insolvency risk of the applicant, that is, the risk the applicant runs insolvent before it is able to repay the letter of credit. Secondly, the bank will be exposed to a risk of fraud by the seller, who may provide incorrect or falsified documents to receive payment. If the bank ought to have known that the documents were a fraud, then the bank will be exposed to a fraud.

====Beneficiary====
The beneficiary will be exposed to the risk of its own failure to comply with credit conditions or failure of, or delays in payment from, the issuing bank. These risks are considered remote. Crucially, the beneficiary is not exposed to the risks of set-off by the applicant where the goods are damaged or are of inferior quality. While he may be sued by the applicant at a later point, the issuing bank cannot reduce the payment owed to correspond with the damage occurred. This is crucial in mitigating the risk to insolvency. Crucial to a letter of credit is the beneficiary&#x27;s (the seller) attempt to isolate itself from the credit risk of the buyer. That is to say, it is concerned primarily with the ability of the buyer to pay for the goods.

===Pricing===

Issuance charges, covering negotiation, reimbursements and other charges are paid by the applicant or as per the terms and conditions of the LC. If the LC does not specify charges, they are paid by the applicant. Charge-related terms are indicated in field 71B.

==Legal principles==
The fundamental principle of all letters of credit is that letters of credit deal with documents and not with goods. The payment obligation is independent from the underlying contract of sale or any other contract in the transaction. 
The bank&#x27;s obligation is defined by the terms of the LC alone, and the contract of sale is not considered.

The specified documents are often bills of lading or other &#x27;documentary intangibles&#x27; which &#x27;A&#x27; and &#x27;B&#x27; have previously specified in their original contract.

The actions available to the buyer arising out of the sale contract do not concern the bank and in no way affect its liability. Article 4(a) of the UCP600 states this principle clearly. 
This is confirmed within the market-practice documents stated by Article 5 of UCP600. As is a core tenet of financial law, market practice comprises a substantial portion of how parties behave. Accordingly, if the documents tendered by the beneficiary or their agent are in order, then, in general, the bank is obliged to pay without further qualifications.

As a result, it is the issuing bank who bears the risk that is linked with non-payment of the buyer. This is advantageous because the issuing bank often has a personal banking relationship with the buyer. The whole commercial purpose for which the system of confirmed irrevocable documentary credits has been developed in international trade is to give to the seller an assured right to be paid before he parts with control of the goods under sale.

It further does not permit of any dispute with the buyer as to the performance of the contract of sale being used as a ground for non-payment or reduction or deferment of payment.

The only exception to this may be fraud. For example, a dishonest seller may present documents which comply with the letter of credit and receive payment, only for it to be later discovered that the documents are fraudulent and the goods are not in accordance with the contract. This would place the risk on the buyer, but it also means that the issuing bank must be stringent in assessing whether the presenting documents are legitimate.

Similar to other financial law instruments, a letter of credit utilises several legal concepts to achieve the economic effect of shifting the legal exposure from the seller to the buyer. The policies behind adopting this principle of abstraction are purely commercial. Whilst the bank is under an obligation to identify that the correct documents exist, they are not expected to examine whether the documents themselves are valid. That is to say, the bank is not responsible for investigating the underlying facts of each transaction, whether the goods are of the sufficient – and specified – quality or quantity.

Because the transaction operates on a negotiable instrument, it is the document itself which holds the value - not the goods to which the reference. This means that the bank need only be concerned with whether the document fulfils the requirements stipulated in the letter of credit.

Documents required under the LC, could in certain circumstances, be different from those required under the sale transaction. This would place banks in a dilemma in deciding which terms to follow if required to look behind the credit agreement. Since the basic function of the credit is to provide a seller with the certainty of payment for documentary duties, it would seem necessary that banks should honor their obligation in spite of any buyer allegations of misfeasance. 
If this were not the case, financial institutions would be much less inclined to issue documentary credits because of the risk, inconvenience, and expense involved in determining the underlying goods.

Financial institutions do not act as &#x27;middlemen&#x27; but rather, as paying agents on behalf of the buyer. Courts have emphasized that buyers always have a remedy for an action upon the contract of sale and that it would be a calamity for the business world if a bank had to investigate every breach of contract.

With the UCP 600 rules the ICC sought to make the rules more flexible, suggesting that data in a document &quot;need not be identical to, but must not conflict with data in that document, any other stipulated document, or the credit&quot;, as a way to account for any minor documentary errors. If this were not the case, the bank would be entitled to withhold payment even if the deviation is purely technical or even typographical.

However, in practice, many banks still hold to the principle of strict compliance, since it offers concrete guarantees to all parties. The general legal maxim &quot;de minimis non curat lex&quot; (literally &quot;The law does not concern itself with trifles&quot;) has no place in the field.

However, whilst the details of the letter of credit can be understood with some flexibility the banks must adhere to the “principle of strict compliance” when determining whether the documents presented are those specified in the letter of credit. This is done to make the banks&#x27; duty of effecting payment against documents easy, efficient and quick.

===Legal basis===
Legal writers have failed to satisfactorily reconcile the bank&#x27;s obligation to pay on behalf of the applicant with any contractually-founded, academic analysis. That is to say, they have not examined legal effect of the banks obligation through a conclusive theoretical lens. This has produced several conflicting theories as to the contractual effect of a letter of credit. Some theorists suggest that the obligation to pay arises through the implied promise, assignment, novation, reliance, agency, estoppel and even trust and the guarantees. Although documentary credits are enforceable once communicated to the beneficiary, it is difficult to show any consideration given by the beneficiary to the banker prior to the tender of documents. In such transactions the undertaking by the beneficiary to deliver the goods to the applicant is not sufficient consideration for the bank&#x27;s promise because the contract of sale is made before the issuance of the credit, thus consideration in these circumstances is past. However, the performance of an existing duty under a contract may be a valid consideration for a new promise made by the bank, provided that there is some practical benefit to the bank A promise to perform owed to a third party may also constitute a valid consideration.

It might also be feasible to typify letters of credit as a collateral contract for a third-party beneficiary, because three different entities participate in the transaction: the seller, the buyer, and the banker. Jean Domat suggests that because letters of credit are prompted by the buyer&#x27;s necessity, the cause of an LC is to release the buyer of his obligation to pay directly to the seller. Therefore, an LC theoretically fits as a collateral contract accepted by conduct or in other words, an implied-in-fact contract where the buyer participates as the third party beneficiary with the bank acting as the stipulator and the seller as the promisor. The term &quot;beneficiary&quot; is not used properly in the scheme of an LC because a beneficiary (also, in trust law, &quot;cestui que use&quot;) in the broadest sense is a natural person or other legal entity who receives money or other benefits from a benefactor. Note that under the scheme of letters of credit, banks are neither benefactors of sellers nor benefactors of buyers and the seller receives no money in gratuity mode. Thus is possible that a “letter of credit” was one of those contracts that needed to be masked to disguise the “consideration or privity requirement”. As a result, this kind of arrangement would make letter of credit to be enforceable under the action assumpsit because of its promissory connotation.

A few countries have created statutes in relation to letters of credit. For example, most jurisdictions in the United States (U.S.) have adopted Article 5 of the Uniform Commercial Code (UCC). These statutes are designed to work with the rules of market practice including UCP and ISP98. These rules of practice are incorporated into the transaction by agreement of the parties. The latest version of the UCP is the UCP600 effective July 1, 2007. Since the UCP are not laws, parties have to include them into their arrangements as normal contractual provisions. However, they still form a substantial part of market practice and crucially underpin financial law.

== National laws ==

=== Germany ===
&quot;Bürgerliches Gesetzbuch&quot;, the German civil code, does not directly address letters of credit. German case law indicates that the relationship between the issuing bank and customer is a contract for execution of a transaction, while the relationship between the issuing bank and the beneficiary is a promise of a debt.

=== Switzerland ===
The Swiss Civil Code of 1911 did not directly address letters of credit, which were still rare in the country at the time. Courts eventually dealt with the device by treating it as a hybrid of a mandate (&quot;Auftrag&quot;) and authorization-to-pay contract (&quot;Anweisung&quot;).

=== United States ===
Letters of credit came into general domestic use in the United States during World War I, although they had been used in American foreign trade for some time prior. The state of New York has historically had the most substantial and consistent body of case law in the United States with regard to letters of credit, due to the prominence of New York banks in international trade. The New York Bankers [sic] Commercial Credit Conference of 1920 provided the first set of voluntary LC regulations for major banks in the United States, but these banks transitioned to the international UCP standard by 1938.

Article 5 of the Uniform Commercial Code, drafted in 1952, provided a basis for codifying many UCP principles into state law and created one of the only extensive specific legal regulations of letters of credit worldwide, although the UCC rules do not cover all aspects of letters of credit. New York effectively subjugated the UCC rules to the existing UCP rules, and as a result the UCP rules continued to govern letters of credit under New York law. Article 5 was revised in 1995 to reflect the latest international practices as codified in the UCP.

== Use in fraud ==
Letters of credit are sometimes used to defraud banks through presentment of false documentation indicating that goods were shipped when they actually were not. Letters of credit are also sometimes used as part of fraudulent investment schemes.

In the international banking system, a letter of undertaking (LOU) is a provisional bank guarantee, under which a bank allows its customer to raise money from another bank&#x27;s foreign branch in the form of short-term credit. The LOU serves the purpose of a bank guarantee. However, to be able to raise the LOU, the customer is supposed to pay margin money to the bank issuing the LOU and accordingly, he is granted a credit limit. In 2018, PNB suffered from such a breach of documentation protocols.

<text>Upper airway resistance syndrome (UARS) is a sleep disorder characterized by the narrowing of the airway that can cause disruptions to sleep. The symptoms include unrefreshing sleep, fatigue, sleepiness, chronic insomnia, and difficulty concentrating. UARS can be diagnosed by polysomnograms capable of detecting Respiratory Effort-related Arousals. It can be treated with lifestyle changes, functional orthodontics, surgery, mandibular repositioning devices or CPAP therapy. UARS is considered a variant of sleep apnea, although some scientists and doctors believe it to be a distinct disorder.

<doc id="844274" wikidata="Q6564107" url="?curid=844274" title="List of Blame! characters">
<text>The universe of the manga &quot;Blame!&quot; created by Tsutomu Nihei is home to the following fictional characters and locations:

==Main characters==

: 
:Killy is a main character of &quot;Blame!&quot;. He is a cyborg tasked by the governing AI agency with finding a human in the 5.3-AU radius Megastructure who still possesses the Net Terminal Gene, a genetic marker necessary for safe access to the Netsphere, from which the functions of the Megastructure may be controlled. He is equipped with a Gravitational Beam Emitter (GBE), a compact but immensely powerful weapon capable of creating holes miles long in the Megastructure. He is soon joined by Cibo in his quest.

:Looking to be in his early to mid-20s, he is a glum-looking person, never smiling (except madly when shooting on occasion) and has a slight slouch in his normal standing position, he is not afraid to fight, and readily shoots the GBE. He also often shows superhuman strength and endurance, being thrown through solid walls and floors before standing right back up with no apparent injuries. The GBE is so powerful that he is flung backwards by its sheer power, often into walls and the ground, but he always gets up. Even in its lowest power, his arm jerks up and back from the force of it. During the encounter with the giant Safeguard outside Toha Heavy Industries, he fires at the Safeguard with the GBE at Level 4 Extra power level. The recoil from the GBE is so powerful that he is thrown back a considerable distance and his right arm is broken, exposing bone and tissue. Killy can survive injuries that would kill an average human as well as recover faster. In the times when he is quiet, he injects drugs into himself in the forehead, and when he is low on power, he may inject it straight into his hand.

:He has an electronic connector to create signals to stop Builders and to transmit information from one person to himself, and vice versa. He also has no memory of his past, or how he obtained the GBE. Killy distrusts Silicon Creatures on sight, and destroys them whenever possible; whether or not they are hostile towards him or his objectives does not bear any weight on his judgement. In Blame!², however, he rescues Pcell (part of a new, relatively peaceful generation of Silicon Life) from the Safeguard, indicating either that his priorities have changed or that he no longer considers Silicon Creatures to be a serious threat.
: (anime film), Asuka Aizawa (Japanese, ONA)

:Cibo is the head scientist of the Bio-Electric Corporation in the Capitol and joins Killy on his quest for the Net Terminal Gene.

:Killy&#x27;s first encounter with Cibo is in the lower levels of the Corporation in The Capitol, where she has been imprisoned for attempting to access the Net Sphere with an artificially created version of Net Terminal Genes. Her failed attempt to access the Net Sphere led to the appearance of the Safeguard, which destroyed the entire lab facility that Cibo was conducting the experiment in. The death and destruction resulting from Cibo&#x27;s failed experiment led the governing body of the Corporation to convict and imprison her.

:Cibo&#x27;s first form is the decaying upper torso of a woman kept alive by machinery inserted into her body. She convinces Killy to take her with him by stating that he needs her hacking skills to access the files he is looking for. Afterwards, she transfers her mind to a replacement body and aids Killy in destroying the Corporation&#x27;s President. Following that, Cibo leaves the Corporation to travel with Killy.

:Later in the manga, Cibo&#x27;s physical body is killed by the Safeguard, but her mind takes over Sanakan&#x27;s body. However, Sanakan&#x27;s consciousness still remains in the body, forcing the two women to share it. Cibo is able to suppress Sanakan&#x27;s mind, preventing it from gaining control, although on one occasion the Safeguard managed to take over.

:After the encounter with the Silicon Life, Mensab and Seu, Killy is teleported to an alternate reality, where he meets an alternate Cibo in her old form. Both versions of Cibo face one another and wish to return to the original reality. During the attempt, the alternate Cibo is killed by a Silicon Life creature, while the original Cibo is severely damaged and Sanakan&#x27;s mind uses the opportunity to resurface. At the last moment before she is overtaken, Cibo extracts her personality data and transfers it into the corpse of her alternate self, reviving the body and living again.

:After an altercation with Silicon Life intending to access the Netsphere, a Level 9 Safeguard (the highest level) was illegally downloaded into Cibo, resulting in her ultimate transformation into the Level 9 Safeguard and the newly-bred Net Terminal Gene. The sphere that she stores in her lower abdomen carries the gene that can save the city if it is taken to its very edge where it can grow uncontaminated by the megastructure and its inhabitants. Sanakan mentions that the &quot;child&quot; is a product of hers and Cibo&#x27;s combined DNA. Cibo is heavily weakened by Killy&#x27;s GBE shortly after her transformation, reverting to a childlike state and eventually falling into the hands of the Silicon Creatures despite Sanakan&#x27;s efforts to find and protect her. Sanakan asks for a return to the Base Reality without backup data, driven by a desire to protect her &quot;child&quot; and charge. She tears through Silicon Creatures to reach Cibo, and then encounters a First Class Exterminator. Killy destroys the Exterminator and recovers the orb, though the Exterminator destroys Cibo and Sanakan during the battle.

==Other characters==

===Safeguard===
The Safeguard are a program independent of the Netsphere. The Netsphere was designed as a means of providing service to those who could log on. However, the Netsphere was thrown into chaos (the actual reason is not exactly known, but the prequel manga &quot;NOiSE&quot; implies that a small group of humans is at fault) and the Safeguard changed their &quot;modus operandi&quot; from preventing unauthorized users from entering the Netsphere to killing off anyone who does not possess Net Terminal Genes. The Safeguard have nine levels of hierarchy, Level 9 being the most powerful. However, their Exterminator (originally the lowest level safeguard) system has a different form of hierarchy where &quot;First Class&quot; is the most powerful.
:
:Sanakan is first seen as a short, young girl with black hair who finds Killy and Cibo in a tunnel after they pierce the impenetrable Megastructure layer with the GBE.

:Killy later discovers her true nature and she reveals herself as a high-level Safeguard with a GBE similar to Killy&#x27;s. At first, Sanakan behaves like any Safeguard intent on annihilating all humans without the Net Terminal Gene. This changes however, when she becomes a representative of the Governing Agency with the task of retrieving Cibo, who at that time becomes the illegal level 9 Safeguard unit. At this point, she adapts a more protective role.

:Sanakan&#x27;s physical body was destroyed twice in the line of duty; First in order to destroy the Toha Heavy Industries&#x27; Central AI and for the second time while protecting Cibo from Silicon Creatures. She finally dies when she sacrifices herself in order to save Killy and the globe that Cibo carried from an Exterminator. Sanakan has been the second &quot;mother&quot; of the child with the net terminal genes, along with Cibo, who was carrying the globe with the embryo.

* Dhomochevsky - Dhomochevsky is a Special Safeguard; the type that is not hostile to humans. This may be due to the fact that he and Iko were essentially stranded in base reality with no backup when the safeguard system on their level was disabled by silicon creatures shortly after their programs were initiated. He has a distinctive scar on his left eye where Schiff stabbed him. Along with Iko, he was recruited to protect a provisional level of the megastructure. A group of Silicon Life cyborgs has invaded this level, led by Davine. Dhomo and Iko are insistent on the level&#x27;s defense because only normal human genes are required for access to the netsphere. He is armed with a quad-barrel gun with many different projectile types. Dhomochevsky is heavily damaged and decapitated by the newly downloaded Level 9 Safeguard, which was instinctively responding to a threat.
* Iko - Iko appears as the thin, white wisp of a facial image. However, in the manga, it is suggested in a flashback of Dhomochevsky&#x27;s that she had a corporeal shape once, but how she lost it was never explained. Most likely, she was unable to gain a new body as the Silicon Life on her level captured the Substance Conversion Tower on which she and Dhomochevsky depended. She acts as a guardian for Dhomochevsky, predicts the behavior of his opponents, and heals him if possible. She transfers all her power to Dhomochevsky in a last-ditch effort to stop Davine as well as Cibo&#x27;s transformation into a Level 9 Safeguard.

===Silicon Life (Cyborgs)===
* Ivy - Ivy is the leader of the contingent of Cyborgs attacking Toha Heavy Industries. He carries a massive weapon, which is essentially four swords, with two of them spring-loaded to swing out from the middle to bludgeon enemies. He is eventually defeated in a sword fight with Seu. (There has been some confusion as to which characters the names Ivy and Maeve are assigned to. This is most likely due to the artwork of the two characters reading: Ivy &amp; Maeve, with the more feminine cyborg on the left and the other on the right. Apart from the text, the artwork is in original Japanese format, and in Japan, they read right to left. Also, in volume 4 their names are clearly distinguished by their dialogues.)
* Maeve - Maeve is Ivy&#x27;s sidekick. The lower half of her body is sliced off by Seu in a fight. Later on, Ivy and some of his contingent discover the &#x27;advanced&#x27; cyborg fused to a wall. They cut it out, wrench the cyborg&#x27;s original head out and implant Maeve into the body. Later, as Maeve is about to execute Mensab, Seu attempts to kill her by throwing his sword and lodging it in her forehead. She seems almost indifferent to this, but before proceeding, she is killed by Killy who fires a Gravitational Beam through her heart. This happens just before the teleportation of Toha Heavy Industries.
* Blon - One of Davine Lu Linvega&#x27;s henchmen. Blon is capable of commanding worm-like creatures, which attach to a target&#x27;s spine and render the target unconscious. He has the capacity to transform his body, taking the shape of a large centipede-esque creature in his first appearance before morphing into a humanoid shape to attack Killy and Cibo. Most of his body is destroyed by Killy in their first encounter. His first defeat allows Pcell to detect the 70-kilometer long holes left by Killy&#x27;s GBE. When Dhomochevsky, Cibo and Iko set out to find Killy and Davine, Pcell appears to confront them at a large Megastructure transport hatch and minutes later, Blon appears in his third form at her command. The third form resembles a large, metallic, spider-praying mantis hybrid with Blon&#x27;s face and his large chain-gun (Vulcan Cannon/Gatling Gun) on its left arm (where it is in Blon&#x27;s humanoid form). When Blon attacks, he slightly wounds Dhomochevsky and is able to steal a capsule from Cibo containing Seu&#x27;s genetic information. Blon is finally killed when Dhomochevsky, Cibo and Iko enter the hatch&#x27;s portal and close the hatch itself while Blon is still in the hatch locking area. This crushes and destroys his entire body. The capsule lands less than a foot outside the hatch radius and is picked up by Pcell.
* Schiff - Schiff is another of Davine Lu Linvega&#x27;s lieutenants. He wields two rectangular black blades mounted into his full-body armor, which may be launched as projectiles. Schiff is the first Silicon Life to attack Killy after Killy loses his GBE (and is forced to use more conventional safeguard weaponry). After a short hand-to-hand fight, Killy gains the upper hand and lands several punches which essentially mangle Schiff&#x27;s armored face. While Schiff is clawing at his broken face, Killy administers the coup de grâce.
* Davine Lu Linvega - Leader of a contingent of cyborgs who Killy encounters late in the series. The level on which she is present allows provisional access to the Net Sphere to any person having normal human DNA. Davinel wants to access the Net Sphere and tries to obtain the DNA sample in Cibo&#x27;s possession (which is Seu&#x27;s). Afterward she is able to infiltrate the Netsphere in Seu&#x27;s form. However, she fatally underestimates the Governing Agency&#x27;s agent who cleverly slows the connection speed, allowing enough time for Dhomochevsky to attack and kill her. However, she manages to steal the Level 9 safeguard data just before Dhomochevsky kills her. Linvega&#x27;s gender has been up to debate; Iko first refers to them as male. However, the side comic &quot;BLAME! Academy&quot; depicts Linvega as a girl.
* Pcell - Davinel&#x27;s subordinate; a skilled combatant wielding a sword-like weapon that emits blasts of force capable of deflecting even the GBE&#x27;s beam. According to Iko, she is the most dangerous of the invading Silicon Life. Unusually for a Silicon Life, she has the capacity to use the Safeguards&#x27; structure conversion tower (hijacked by Davine) to repair herself and evade attacks. She is implied to have some connection with Dhomochevsky, but the nature of this connection is unknown. After Cibo transforms into the Level 9 Safeguard, Pcell attempts to kill her with a blast from her sword and is killed by Killy in retaliation (v8 p174).
* Silicon Creature Generals - The two mysterious Silicon Creatures heading the Silicon settlement that captures the Level 9 Safeguard. Both carry staff-like weapons that are extremely similar in ability to that of the &#x27;Safeguard Sword.&#x27; The male cyborg, seen wearing an armor plated trench-coat and various black metal accessories, wounds Sanakan as he makes a final attempt to stop her. The female cyborg, seen with black and white hair and wearing black and metallic clothing, is last seen dismembering the rogue armored cyborg. It is left to the reader to decide whether or not Killy dispatches her.

===Humans===
* Technomads - Humans who encounter Killy while he is still quite low in The City. They have lost all knowledge of their heritage, and have some connection to their Planter/Electrofisher relatives. Each group wears similar armor and the Electrofishers and Technomads share a stylized tribal appearance, though it is unclear which group is descended from which. The Technomads travel from safe haven to safe haven, never venturing outside their shelters without heavy protection.
* Laborers - Humans who dwell in the Power Corporation city near the top of a megastructure. Prone to heavy body modification, their appearance depends greatly on their occupation within the corporation. Ordinarily, they have evolved to be quite large, dwarfing the average-sized Killy by three to four feet. The Power Corporation has excavated a great deal of technology from the surrounding megastructure, emulating the technology of the Safeguard, Authority, and Silicon Life. These further affect their culture and appearance, as they devote a great deal of time researching and developing this part of their culture.
* The Dry Men - While it is unclear whether they are truly human or a benevolent offshoot of Silicon Life, the Dry Men exist as an aboriginal race in the megastructure. Their name – given to them by the Laborers – stems from the long cracks in their skin. They are often persecuted by organ harvesters, who trade them in for their low transplant rejection rate.
* Planters - Humans originally working as laborers in Toha Heavy Industries.
* Electrofishers (originally ) - A people descended from the Planters. They have been locked out for many generations, and have lost all knowledge about why they are there and what Toha is. Their appearance has evolved in that they have tribalized the traditional Planter armor with markings, beads and sashes. They are able to fight the Safeguard using powerful bolt-firing rifles similar to spear guns. The methods they use to survive is unknown, although it is implied that they have traveled throughout the megastructure surrounding Toha, scavenging. For a time they had the technology to preserve the personalities of deceased fishers and transfer them to new bodies. However, this skill has long died out by the time of their entrance into the narrative. The Electrofishers are a very short-statured race of humans, unlike Cibo who comes from a race that is very tall.

===Minor characters===
* Mensab - Mensab is the AI Controller for Cave 8 inside Toha Heavy Industries. She is expelled from the collective AI, although the reason is not exactly clear. She normally acts and appears quite calm, but her appearance also mirrors her mood. Also, as Cibo departs from Toha Heavy Industries, she bestows her with a small capsule containing Seu&#x27;s genetic information which, surprisingly enough, can partially access the Netsphere.
* Seu - A Planter, who serves as Mensab&#x27;s protector. He is a powerful swordsman and loyal bodyguard. Whenever he is severely injured, Mensab takes him to be restored by equipment which can heal any damage and also synthesize any substance (however, he loses memory each time he is healed in this way). As only Mensab&#x27;s people survived the silicon creature invasion, and they were likely killed in the destruction of Toha Heavy Industries, Seu could have possibly been the last Planter alive. He eventually withdraws with Mensab and the recorded personalities of the remaining Planters into a time-space rift, ensuring their safety.
* Mori - A girl whose mind was downloaded into an emergency preservation pack resembling a USB drive. Her corpse sat undisturbed for a long time before Killy stumbled on it. Mori is not her name, and we never learn her real name. Mori was the name of the manufacturer of the emergency preservation pack, and was printed on the device itself. Killy, acting as a Good Samaritan, takes her along on his quest. Mori&#x27;s main task, it seems, is to do most of the talking for Killy in Cibo&#x27;s absence. Shortly after Killy obtains Cibo&#x27;s &#x27;child&#x27;, Mori is taken by the Governing Agency to a storage area and recounts her adventures with Killy to other damaged digital consciousnesses.

==Factions or groups of note==
* Safeguard - The Safeguard is the completely independent defense system of the Netsphere. The Safeguard&#x27;s original purpose was to prevent unauthorized access to the Netsphere by those without Net Terminal Genes. However, due to the Order breeding and using humans without Net Terminal Genes to make more Silicon Life, the Safeguard have taken to destroying all humans without the Net Terminal Gene as a preemptive measure. Safeguard are often seen to materialise from the substance of the megastructure using structure conversion towers. Even humans have been turned into Safeguards after coming into contact with Safeguard weapons, notably the darts used by Sanakan. There are more powerful special agents, like Sanakan, Dhomochevsky, and Iko who may derive from core personalities uploaded into the Netsphere.
* Exterminators - A subset of Safeguard which is made up of black-and-white-colored, silicon-based, bio-mechanical, humanoid robots. These often use primitive, close-range weapons as a means of attack, but because of their formidable armor, it is not much of a problem. They come in different classes of power, though the hierarchy is never explained. The lowest, most common safeguard attacks with just its hands. A higher type attacks with larger, clawed hands, another with large shear-like weapons. The &#x27;Class One Exterminator&#x27;, encountered near the end of the series, eschews melee attacks for esoteric weaponry and the capacity to transform the City&#x27;s structure itself. Safeguard Exterminators seem to run on a different protocol of command than the higher level of Safeguard such as Sanakan and/or Dhomochevsky (though Dhomo did have a contingent of them assigned to him before Schiff destroyed them). At one point, the Exterminator Class One even targets Sanakan as it deems her a threat or obstacle, but does not decide to kill her. It is up to speculation as to why - perhaps either it no longer saw her as a threat, or perhaps it was because she too was a Safeguard.
* Governing Agency or Authority (originally ), - The ruling level of the Net Sphere. It tries at times to assist Killy and Cibo against the Cyborgs and against the Safeguard. It has powers identical to the Safeguard, but cannot directly control the Safeguard - although it can hinder them. It wants a human with the Net Terminal Gene to be found to stop the Builders which are the cause of the runaway growth of The City.
* Builders (originally , meaning Architect) - Machines which construct The City. They are not connected directly to The Net Sphere or Safeguard; therefore a human with net terminal genes is only capable of their activation. They come in a wide variety of shapes and sizes. Killy remembers their language in the village of the Fishermen, and Cibo uses her knowledge about them to learn to control them completely. A group of builders in the higher megastructures of The City have been modified, possibly by long deceased humans, to behave socially, conversing with the beings they encounter and taking moderately humanoid appearances.

==Structures==
* The Megastructure (originally ) - These are large plates that lie between levels of The City and are made out of an unknown, nearly-indestructible material. They are part of some kind of major isolation system between the gargantuan floors of The City. Attempts to approach the megastructure result in a massive safeguard response so as to prevent trespassing. Only a direct Gravitational Beam Emitter blast is known to have been capable of tearing a hole into a megastructure.
* The Netsphere - A possible future incarnation of the internet available only to those with the Net Terminal Gene and guarded by the Safeguard. According to the opening of the Net Sphere Engineer, it was meant as a new world order, and could fulfill the desires of the people. It is posited in &quot;NOiSE&quot; that it was in fact a New Social Order designed to exclude the infected. It can only be accessed by those possessing Net Terminal Genes.
* Toha Heavy Industries (originally ) - A massive edifice or possibly vehicle separate from the megastructure. Toha Heavy Industries was mentioned as the benevolent organization in &quot;Biomega&quot; as well as a mecha manufacturer in &quot;Knights of Sidonia&quot;. It is inhabited by humans known only as the &#x27;planters&#x27;, and is the origin of the splinter group, the &#x27;fishers&#x27;. It is controlled by a central AI, and has a collective of thirteen other AIs; one controlling each cave. The Collective AI was created in an effort to prevent insanity, however, in the end it did not work out. The central AI shows increasingly irrational behavior with its use of teleportation technology, and its gravity furnace. The AI isolated itself from the outside using a treaty from the Governing Agency because of the seriousness of the Silicon Creature&#x27;s disease, and excommunicated those who did. Toha Heavy Industries is crucial because the planters may be net gene carriers.
* Structure conversion towers - These buildings appear to be autonomous energy reserves and/or producers which are independent of the Megastructure. They are apparently capable of synthesising any form of matter, mainly Safeguard units. Davine Lu Linvega hijacks one and uses it to download various types of constructs, including special Exterminators which bear her face.

==Plot devices==
* Net Terminal Genes (originally ) - These are the special genes which allow those possessing them full access to the Netsphere. However, the Net Terminal Genes are incredibly rare by the time period where &quot;BLAME!&quot; begins. The Net Sphere protection agency, also called the Safeguard, is under standing orders to kill any human found who does not possess these genes; also, any illegal access to the Netsphere is responded to by downloading a Safeguard to the location of the illegal access point and having it kill the person who attempted access. As very few humans in &quot;BLAME!&quot; possess the Net Terminal Gene, the Safeguards are essentially under orders to kill all humans.

<doc id="844278" wikidata="Q21504801" url="?curid=844278" title="Carew (surname)">
<text>Carew is a Welsh and Cornish habitation-type surname; it has also been used as a synonym for the Irish patronymic Ó Corráin. &quot;Carey&quot; can be a variant.

==History==
The Cambro-Norman Carew family sprang from the same stock as the FitzGeralds: viz. from the union of Gerald de Windsor alias Gerald FitzWalter (1070–1136), the Norman Constable of Pembroke, Pembrokeshire and Nest ferch Rhys, Princess of Deheubarth, the &#x27;Helen of Wales&#x27;. These Carews descend from Gerald and Nest&#x27;s oldest son William FitzGerald de Carew. The family home was at Carew, Pembrokeshire () from a fortified site and later castle, and originally a holding of Nest&#x27;s royal father, Rhys Ap Tewdwr. The usual derivation offered is that the root word is &#x27;caer&#x27;, Middle Welsh for &#x27;fort&#x27;; the second element being possibly &#x27;rhiw&#x27; – &#x27;slope&#x27;, or &#x27;yw&#x27; – &#x27;yew&#x27; (tree). The Pembrokeshire Coast National Park website has &#x27;Caerau – fort (Locally pron Carey)&#x27;.

First, as will be shown below, not all modern Carews are of Carew, Pembrokeshire stock; some bear the name from cognate Cornish origins; and others as an Anglicised form, together with Carey, of the Irish patronymic Ó Corráin/Ó Carráin.

Secondly, some true Carews in Wales may have received their name in the variant form of &#x27;Carey&#x27; or &#x27;Cary&#x27;, which is a traditional local pronunciation of the place Carew (see above), another version being &#x27;Care-ew&#x27;. John Marius Wilson&#x27;s &#x27;Imperial Gazetteer of England and Wales&#x27; (1870–72) has &#x27;Carew, or Carey, a village and a parish in the district and county of Pembroke&#x27;. Bannister (1871) writes that Carew is &#x27;pronounced Car&#x27;-ew in Ireland; Car-ew&#x27; in Devon; &quot;Carey in Cornwall and Wales&quot;&#x27; (my italics). However, Carey in Britain generally is either from any one of at least six immigrant Gaelic-Irish patronymics Anglicised thus, or is from a Pre-Celtic or Celtic language river/habitation name in Somerset and Devon.

Gerald FitzWalter&#x27;s second son Maurice FitzGerald, Lord of Lanstephan and grandson Raymond de Carreu, &#x27;le Gros&#x27;, took part, alongside Richard de Clare, 2nd Earl of Pembroke, or &#x27;Strongbow&#x27;, in the invasion of Ireland in 1171. The &#x27;invasion&#x27; was almost a family affair, with many of the Cambro-Norman protagonists related through the matriarchal and &#x27;polygamous&#x27; Nest: among the cousins of the Geraldines were Robert FitzStephen, Robert de Barry et al.

In Ireland, after the invasion, the de Carreus, or Carews, held the barony of Idrone in County Carlow, without relinquishing their holdings in Britain. William de Carreu (died 1213), held both manors of Carew and Idrone. Maurice de Carreu was in Edward 1&#x27;s Irish Parliament in 1300. Raymond de Carreu appears in Irish records in 1302. Sir John Carew (d. 1362), who also held the manor of Moulsford in Berkshire, was Justiciar of Ireland.

Another Norman branch, which may or may not be related to the Idrone Carews, said to be descended from Adam Montgomery de Carrew, settled in East Cork, at Garryvoe, in the 12th century. This family is described in &#x27;British Museum Funeral Certificates&#x27;, MS. No. 4820. They feature frequently in the &#x27;Fiants&#x27; (Tudor records): e.g. John Careue of Garryvoe, 1582; Redmond &amp; Peirse Carewe, 1600. They forfeited Garryvoe, as rebels against Cromwell&#x27;s &#x27;Commonwealth&#x27; in 1656. Paul MacCotter has claimed in &#x27;Irish Roots&#x27; (1997) that the rare East Cork Carews survive under the form &#x27;Carey&#x27;; although the Garryvoe family definitely died out in the male line in the 1660s (Brit Mus.MS 4820); and Carey in this area is regarded as an Anglicisation of Ó Ciaráin.

There is recorded evidence for Carew being used as a synonym of the Munster surname Ó Corráin/Ó Carráin. The &#x27;Court of Claims&#x27; in Ireland, &quot;15 July 1663&quot;, adjudicates a request for return of lands in and around Mobernan in County Tipperary forfeited by &#x27;Teige Carrue alias O Carron&#x27;. Donald O Carrane of Mobernayne, 1586 was his ancestor. By the 17th century the Mobernan O Corrain sept had widely adopted Carew as an Anglicised form of their name: Conor Carew of Mobarnan, was a representative at the Catholic Confederation of Kilkenny, 1642. Thomas Carue (alias O Corrain) of Mobernan appears in the Dictionary of National Biography His brother, Sir Ross Carey, appears on the 1661 memorial of Anne Hyde, his wife, in Westminster Abbey. Carve, however, in his &quot;Lyra sive anacephalaeosis Hibernica&quot; claims that the usage of Carran for his family name is incorrect. He says &quot;Prater hos alia est antiquae nobilitatis domus nimirum Domini Carue Imakellanse, a Thomas Carue (de quo Paulo ante tractavimus) suam protrahit parentelam, ex qua etiam aliae non ignobiles familiae excreverunt, quo abusive Hibernico Idiomate Carran appellantur. Ex his orti sunt Robertus Carve de Imakelly, &amp; Roseus Carve de Moberman Equites aurati.&quot; (Carve, Thomas &quot;Lyra&quot; p. 47) The adverb &#x27;abusive&#x27; means &#x27;incorrectly&#x27; in this context.

Some Carews, according to family legend/family trees, moved from Pembrokeshire to the English West Country, and settled in Crowcombe in Somerset, Haccombe in Devon and Antony House in Cornwall. There the name has occasionally been used interchangeably, in records such as the &#x27;Patent Rolls&#x27;, with the indigenous Cary of the West Country, causing confusion. It has been claimed that &#x27;Carey&#x27; is a variant of Carew in Cornwall, (neither name there is numerous). However, this claim seems to be based on the Carew family of Antony being allegedly known by the byname &#x27;Carey&#x27; (Hanks &amp; Hodges, op. cit. 1988), whereas this gentry family were usually known as &#x27;Carew&#x27; not &#x27;Carey&#x27;.

It is also highly likely that the surnames Carew and Carrow in Cornwall are variants of Cornish locative names such as Kerrow, Caroe &amp;c. with derivations from either Celtic &#x27;car/ker&#x27;- &#x27;fort&#x27; or pre-Celtic &#x27;car&#x27;- &#x27;stone/stony&#x27;. This would mean that at least some Cornish Carews are indigenous to Cornwall, and therefore have no connection with the Welsh/Norman immigrant Carews of Antony.

In England the family became influential. The Devon Carews became Earls of Totness (1625, extinct 1629). A Devon man, Sir George Carew was President of Munster temp. Elizabeth 1st. Ironically, given the supposed family connection, one of his more formidable tasks was the destruction of the FitzGerald Earls of Desmond.

Cornishman Richard Carew of Antony was a noted late 16th-century historian of Cornwall; he wrote the fascinating &#x27;Survey of Cornwall&#x27;, published in 1602. Another family member, Alexander Carew, 2nd Baronet of Antony, was executed by Parliament for his lackadaisical support of their &#x27;cause&#x27; in 1644. His half brother, John Carew, was a keener supporter of Cromwell: he was Commonwealth M.P. for Cornwall, and a signatory to the execution of Charles 1st; thus as a &#x27;regicide&#x27; he was hanged, drawn and quartered by the returning royalists in 1660.

The Cambro-Norman Pembrokeshire Carew arms are &#x27;Or, three lioncels passant, sable&#x27;.

The surname Carew has been adopted in Russia as Keyru. It originates from John Carew, an athlete from Sierra Leone who had a family in Russia including the actor Olah Keru, the singer Willy Keyru and international basketball players Victor and Katerina Keyru.

<text>The Central District (, &quot;Meḥoz haMerkaz&quot;; ) of Israel is one of six administrative districts, including most of the Sharon region. It is further divided into four sub-districts: Petah Tikva, Ramla, Sharon, and Rehovot. The district&#x27;s largest city is Rishon LeZion. The district&#x27;s population as of 2017 was 2,115,800. According to the Israeli Central Bureau of Statistics, 88% of the population is Jewish, 8.2% is Arab, and 4% are &quot;non-classified&quot;, being mostly former Soviet Union immigrants of partial or nominal Jewish ethnic heritage or household members of Jews.

<doc id="844283" wikidata="Q1236324" url="?curid=844283" title="Cantera">
<text>Cantera, literally meaning &quot;quarry&quot; in Spanish, is a term used in Spain to refer to youth academies and farm teams organized by sports clubs. It is also used to refer to the geographical area that clubs recruit players from. The term is widely used in football but is also applied to other sports, such as basketball. This article, however, is about the football &quot;canteras&quot;. Notable canteras include those of Athletic Bilbao, Real Sociedad, Real Madrid, Barcelona, Atlético Madrid, Espanyol, Sporting de Gijón, Celta de Vigo and Valencia.

==Basque canteras==

===Athletic Bilbao===
Since 1912, Athletic Bilbao have employed a &quot;cantera policy&quot;, which has come to be defined in an official (although not legally binding) signing policy whereby they will only recruit players with some link to the Basque Country. One of the main beneficiaries of the policy has been the Spain national team. Athletic has provided numerous players for it, second only to Real Madrid.

During the early 1920s, the Basque Country was a breeding ground of great Spanish players. It was the first area where the sport really became popular, and the influx of immigrants from all over Spain was also a factor in the region producing dozens of quality players. In 1920, Spain made their international debut and entered a team in the Olympic Games. Of the 21 players in the squad, 14 were Basques, among them Pichichi, José María Belauste, Domingo Acedo and Félix Sesúmaga.

Throughout their history, Athletic Bilbao have continued to produce many notable players while adhering to their policy. Among them were Telmo Zarra, the then all-time top La Liga goalscorer; José Ángel Iribar, 614 official matches with Athletic and a member of the Spain team when they won the European Championship in 1964; and Andoni Zubizarreta, who made a record 622 La Liga appearances and is also the second most capped Spanish international player. Other notable graduates of the Athletic cantera include Bata, Agustín Gaínza, José Luis Panizo, Andoni Goikoetxea, Julio Salinas, Julen Guerrero, Rafael Alkorta, Andoni Iraola, Fernando Llorente and Kepa Arrizabalaga. Their youth teams continue to be among the most productive in Spain.

===Real Sociedad===
Athletic were not the only club to have a cantera policy — fellow Basque club Real Sociedad operated a similar policy until 1989. Neither were Athletic the only Basque club that provided players for the 1920 Olympics squad. Real Sociedad, Real Unión and Arenas Club de Getxo also provided players. In 1928, these four clubs became founding members of La Liga, demonstrating further the strength in depth of the Basque canteras at the time. The saying &quot;Con cantera y afición, no hace falta importación&quot;, translated as &quot;With home-grown teams and supporters, there is no need for imports&quot;, made sense during these early days.

The ability of the Basque Country to produce great players was made clear during the early 1980s when La Real and Athletic won four Liga titles in a row between 1981 and 1984. The Real Sociedad team included, among others, Roberto López Ufarte, José Mari Bakero, Luis Arconada and Jesús María Zamora. Xabi Alonso, a World Cup winner in 2010, is also a product of Real Sociedad&#x27;s youth system.

==Barcelona and Real Madrid==
Although Barcelona and Real Madrid are well known for regularly recruiting foreign players, both are renowned worldwide for producing local players. Along with Athletic Bilbao (see Bilbao Athletic), both clubs have notable reserve teams (Barcelona B and Real Madrid Castilla respectively) that are predominantly made up of Spanish players.

Numerous senior players have graduated through the ranks of Barcelona&#x27;s &quot;La Masia&quot; academy, including Francisco Carrasco, Ramón Calderé, Guillermo Amor, Albert Ferrer, Pep Guardiola, Sergi, Iván de la Peña, Francesc Arnau, Óscar, Roger, Gabri, Gerard, Luis García Sanz, Oleguer, Pepe Reina, Thiago Motta, Fernando Navarro, Xavi, Cesc Fàbregas, Carles Puyol, Víctor Valdés, Mikel Arteta, Andrés Iniesta, Bojan, Jeffrén, Lionel Messi, Giovani dos Santos, Gerard Piqué, Sergio Busquets, Pedro, Cristian Tello, Thiago, Rafinha, Marc Bartra, Gerard Deulofeu and Sergi Roberto, though some of these were recruited from overseas before signing professional terms, so are not &quot;home-grown&quot; in the traditional sense, if in the technical sense.

Similarly, numerous notable professional players have graduated Real Madrid&#x27;s youth academy, known as &quot;La Fábrica (the factory)&quot;. In 1966, Madrid won the European Cup with a team of 11 Spanish players and a Spanish coach, marking the first time a home-born team had won the competition. Many great homegrown players have since passed through the ranks, among them &quot;La Quinta del Buitre&quot; — Emilio Butragueño, Manolo Sanchís, Martín Vazquéz, Míchel and Miguel Pardeza. Graduates of the cantera also include Iker Casillas, Álvaro Arbeloa, Esteban Granero, Raúl, Guti, Luis García Fernández, Juan Mata, Kiko Casilla, Borja Valero, Rubén de la Red, Dani Carvajal, Álvaro Negredo, Roberto Soldado, Rodrigo, Dani Parejo, José Callejón, Juanfran, Javi García, Álvaro Morata, Jesé and Lucas Vázquez. The club has also produced some notable managers, including Vicente del Bosque and Rafael Benítez.

As well as producing players from their own regions, both clubs have also recruited young players from throughout Spain and internationally. Recent examples include Argentines Lionel Messi, Mauro Icardi and Esteban Cambiasso.

==Poaching of players==
Ever since the early days of football in Spain, one issue for &quot;cantera&quot; clubs is the poaching or recruiting of their players by other clubs. After the cantera has trained a player, another club will step in with a tempting offer and take them away. The potential of the Basque Country as a recruiting ground for players was recognised by the likes of Barcelona, Atlético Madrid and Real Madrid early on.

Barça, in particular, has a long history of signing players from the region, dating back to the acquisition of Félix Sesúmaga. Others have included Jesús Garay, Chus Pereda, José Ramón Alexanko, Javier Urruticoechea and, in more recent times, Santiago Ezquerro. During the 1980s and 1990s, Barcelona poached a number of top Basque players, among them José Mari Bakero, Txiki Begiristain, Andoni Zubizarreta, Julio Salinas and Ion Andoni Goikoetxea, enabling manager Johan Cruyff to build the legendary &quot;Dream Team&quot; around them.

The successful Atlético Madrid teams of the 1960s also included a notable Basque presence in the form of Miguel Jones and José Eulogio Gárate, both recruited from Indautxu, and Javier Irureta, signed from Real Unión. Real Madrid has also regularly looked north for players such as Rafael Alkorta, Mikel Lasa, Aitor Karanka and Iván Campo.

Athletic Bilbao, however, have also been regularly accused of poaching. The Athletic policy of recruiting only Basque-players has seen them frequently recruit from the canteras of other Basque clubs. In 1995, Athletic signed Joseba Etxeberria from Real Sociedad, causing considerable ill feeling between the two clubs.

By the 1990s, the poaching of players took on a new dimension. Real Madrid in particular have regularly produced quality players unable to establish themselves with their home club. Some critics have argued that this has partly arisen because these clubs continue to use &quot;imports&quot; at the expense of cantera players. As a result, many graduates of the canteras seek their fortune elsewhere and are willing to be poached. Initially, cantera players only moved to other Spanish clubs, but in more recent times, English Premier League clubs have begun recognizing the potential of the canteras. In 2003, Arsenal persuaded Cesc Fàbregas to leave Barcelona B with a much higher salary that Barcelona could not offer due to Spanish contractual law.

More recently, teenage star Fran Mérida followed Fàbregas&#x27; footsteps and played some time for Arsenal&#x27;s reserve team before returning to La Liga in 2010 with Atlético Madrid. Another emerging Barça B player, Gerard Piqué, subsequently signed for Manchester United, though he has since moved back to Barcelona. Since then, Rafael Benítez, himself a product of the &quot;cantera&quot;, has recruited Luis García Sanz, Pepe Reina, Xabi Alonso and Fernando Torres for Liverpool, while Mikel Arteta established himself at Everton. Luis García Sanz, Reina and Arteta all began their career at Barça; Alonso started out at Real Sociedad; and Torres developed in the Atlético system.

<doc id="844288" wikidata="Q1337980" url="?curid=844288" title="Sylvio Mantha">
<text>Joseph Sylvio Theobald Mantha (April 14, 1902 – August 7, 1974) was a Canadian professional ice hockey defenceman who played fourteen seasons in the National Hockey League for the Montreal Canadiens and Boston Bruins. Elected to the Hockey Hall of Fame in 1960, he was regarded as one of the best two-way defencemen of his day.

==Amateur career==
Mantha started as a right winger for the Notre Dame de Grace Juniors in 1919, before playing for Verdun in the Intermediate Mount Royal Hockey League, and Imperial Tobacco and Northern Electric in the Montreal industrial league. He played briefly for the Montreal Nationales in the Quebec league. After scoring four goals in nine games with the Nationales, he was signed by the Montreal Canadiens in December of 1923.

==NHL career==

The Canadiens started Mantha as a forward, then moved him to defence as part of a youth movement, because veteran Montreal defencemen Sprague Cleghorn and Billy Coutu were aging. He was used sparingly as a substitute that first season, but gained more ice time thereafter as an injury replacement for Coutu and as Cleghorn was suspended during the season. Mantha played more regularly in the playoffs, helping the Canadiens to the 1924 Stanley Cup championship.

When Cleghorn was traded just before the 1925–26 NHL season, Mantha gained a more prominent role. With the further trade of Coutu to Boston in the 1927 offseason, he was named captain of the team, and paired with Herb Gardiner -- acquired with the breakup of the Western Hockey League from the Calgary Tigers -- to become the new starting defencemen for the Canadiens. Mantha was injured in the playoffs that year, but recovered to score Montreal&#x27;s only goal on an end-to-end rush in the deciding (and losing) game to the Ottawa Senators.

Newly paired with defenceman Battleship Leduc after Gardiner left to become player-coach in Chicago, Mantha scored the first-ever goal in Boston Garden on November 20, 1928, leading the Canadiens to a 1–0 win over the Boston Bruins. Mantha also got to play with his brother Georges that season, a rookie forward signed by Montreal. By the end of the season, Mantha was paired on defence with Marty Burke, a partnership that would last for several seasons.

The 1929–30 saw Montreal win its second Stanley Cup during Mantha&#x27;s tenure, in which he starred with two goals in the best-of-three Stanley Cup Finals series against the heavily favored Bruins, which had the best winning percentage in NHL history during the regular season. In this season, Mantha had career highs in goals, assists and points, finishing second among league defencemen to King Clancy of the Senators in goals, and third behind Clancy and Bruin Eddie Shore in points.

The first season-ending All-Star Team was named in 1930–31, and Mantha was named Second Team All-Star on defence for both that year and the next, for his prowess as a defensive defenceman. Goaltender George Hainsworth would take over as team captain for Mantha in 1933, a post Mantha would regain the following season.

Following an incident in the 1934 season where Mantha successfully substituted for the suspended Newsy Lalonde as coach for the Habs in two matches -- and beginning to fade as a player, no longer being a starter by the 1934 playoffs -- he was named the full-time player-coach for the 1935–36 NHL season. After a dismal season, with Montreal missing the playoffs for the first time in a decade and finishing in last place, the Canadiens fired him as a coach, and then released him as a player before the start of the 1937 season.

In a game against the New York Rangers on January 28, 1937, Boston superstar Eddie Shore sustained a back injury that proved to be season ending. In consequence, the Bruins signed Mantha as a replacement. It took some time for him to get into game shape, and ultimately he played only four games for Boston. Spurred on by cracking a bone in his elbow, Mantha admitted he could no longer play at a competitive level, and retired.

== Retirement ==
After retirement as a player, Mantha worked as a linesman and referee for both the American Hockey League and the NHL. However, he found the continual travel required of an on-ice official grueling, and transitioned to coaching for Montreal-area junior league teams. He coached the Montreal Concordias, Laval Nationales (1943–1945), Verdun Maple Leafs (1945–1947), St. Jerome Eagles (1947–1948, 1951–1952), and Verdun Lasalle (1950–1951) before leaving organized hockey for good. During this time, Mantha was instrumental in steering future Hall of Famer Bernie Geoffrion to the Concordias, which at the time were under the control of the Canadiens, after seeing the then-14 year old Geoffrion score five goals in a match.

Mantha was inducted into the Hockey Hall of Fame in 1960, and died in Montreal in August 1974.

The Georges and Sylvio Mantha Arenas are part of the Complexe Récréatif Gadbois in Montreal and named for him and his brother Georges Mantha.
