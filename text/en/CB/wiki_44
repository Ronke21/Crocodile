<text>The end of Roman rule in Britain occurred as the military forces of Roman Britain withdrew to defend or seize the Western Roman Empire&#x27;s continental core, leaving behind an autonomous post-Roman Britain. In 383, the usurper Magnus Maximus withdrew troops from northern and western Britain, probably leaving local warlords in charge. In 407, the usurper Constantine III took the remaining mobile Roman soldiers to Gaul in response to the crossing of the Rhine, and external attacks surged. The Romano-British deposed Roman officials around 410 and government largely reverted to the city level. That year Emperor Honorius refused an appeal from Britain for military assistance. The following decades saw the collapse of urban life and the beginning of Anglo-Saxon settlement.

==Chronology==

===383–388===
In 383, the Roman general then assigned to Britain, Magnus Maximus, launched his successful bid for imperial power, crossing to Gaul with his troops. He killed the Western Roman Emperor Gratian and ruled Gaul and Britain as Caesar (i.e., as a &quot;sub-emperor&quot; under Theodosius I). 383 is the last date for any evidence of a Roman presence in the north and west of Britain, perhaps excepting troop assignments at the tower on Holyhead Mountain in Anglesey and at western coastal posts such as Lancaster. These outposts may have lasted into the 390s, but they were a very minor presence.

Coins dated later than 383 have been excavated along Hadrian&#x27;s Wall, suggesting that troops were not stripped from it, as once thought or, if they were, they were quickly returned as soon as Maximus had won his victory in Gaul. In the &quot;De Excidio et Conquestu Britanniae&quot;, written c. 540, Gildas attributed an exodus of troops and senior administrators from Britain to Maximus, saying that he left not only with all of its troops, but also with all of its armed bands, governors, and the flower of its youth, never to return.

Raids by Saxons, Picts, and the Scoti of Ireland had been ongoing in the late 4th century, but these increased in the years after 383. There were also large-scale permanent Irish settlements made along the coasts of Wales under circumstances that remain unclear. Maximus campaigned in Britain against both the Picts and Scoti, with historians differing on whether this was in the year 382 or 384 (i.e., whether the campaign was before or after he became Caesar). Welsh legend relates that before launching his usurpation, Maximus made preparations for an altered governmental and defence framework for the beleaguered provinces. Figures such as Coel Hen were said to be placed into key positions to protect the island in Maximus&#x27;s absence. As such claims were designed to buttress Welsh genealogy and land claims, they should be viewed with some scepticism.

In 388, Maximus led his army across the Alps into Italy in an attempt to usurp Theodosius as emperor. The effort failed when he was defeated in Pannonia at the Battle of the Save (in modern Croatia) and at the Battle of Poetovio (at Ptuj in modern Slovenia). He was then executed by Theodosius.

===389–406===
With Maximus&#x27;s death, Britain came back under the rule of Emperor Theodosius I until 392, when the usurper Eugenius made a bid for imperial power in the Western Roman Empire until 394 when he was defeated and killed by Theodosius. When Theodosius died in 395, his 10-year-old son Honorius succeeded him as Western Roman Emperor. The real power behind the throne, however, was Stilicho, the son-in-law of Theodosius&#x27; brother and the father-in-law of Honorius.

Britain was suffering raids by the Scoti, Saxons, and Picts and, sometime between 396 and 398, Stilicho allegedly ordered a campaign against the Picts, likely a naval campaign intended to end their seaborne raids on the east coast of Britain. He may also have ordered campaigns against the Scoti and Saxons at the same time, but either way this would be the last Roman campaign in Britain of which there is any record.

In 401 or 402 Stilicho faced wars with the Visigothic king Alaric and the Ostrogothic king Radagaisus. Needing military manpower, he stripped Hadrian&#x27;s Wall of troops for the final time. The year 402 is the last date of any Roman coinage found in large numbers in Britain, suggesting either that Stilicho also stripped the remaining troops from Britain, or that the Empire could no longer afford to pay the troops who were still there. Meanwhile, the Picts, Saxons and Scoti continued their raids, which may have increased in scope. In 405, for example, Niall of the Nine Hostages is described as having raided along the southern coast of Britain.

===407–410===
On the last day of December 406 (or, perhaps, 405), the Alans, Vandals, and Suebi living east of Gaul crossed the Rhine, possibly when it was frozen over, and caused widespread devastation.

As there was no effective Roman response, the remaining Roman military in Britain feared that a Germanic crossing of the Channel into Britain was next, and dispensed with imperial authority – an action perhaps made easier by the high probability that the troops had not been paid for some time. Their intent was to choose a commander who would lead them in securing their future but their first two choices, Marcus and Gratian, did not meet their expectations and were killed. Their third choice was the soldier Constantine III.

In 407, Constantine took charge of the remaining troops in Britain, led them across the Channel into Gaul, rallied support there, and attempted to set himself up as Western Roman Emperor. Honorius&#x27; loyalist forces south of the Alps were preoccupied with fending off the Visigoths and were unable to put down the rebellion swiftly, giving Constantine the opportunity to extend his new empire to include Hispania.

In 409, Constantine&#x27;s control of his empire fell apart. Part of his military forces were in Hispania, making them unavailable for action in Gaul, and some of those in Gaul were swayed against him by loyalist Roman generals. The Germans living west of the Rhine River rose against him, perhaps encouraged by Roman loyalists, and those living east of the river crossed into Gaul. Britain, now without any troops for protection and having suffered particularly severe Saxon raids in 408 and 409, viewed the situation in Gaul with renewed alarm. Perhaps feeling they had no hope of relief under Constantine, both the Romano-Britons and some of the Gauls expelled Constantine&#x27;s magistrates in 409 or 410. The Byzantine historian Zosimus (fl. 490s – 510s) directly blamed Constantine for the expulsion, saying that he had allowed the Saxons to raid, and that the Britons and Gauls were reduced to such straits that they revolted from the Roman Empire, &#x27;rejected Roman law, reverted to their native customs, and armed themselves to ensure their own safety&#x27;.

The Visigoths, led by Alaric, launched an invasion of Italy in 407, culminating in a sack of Rome and the installation of a rival emperor, Attalus. Emperor Honorius, amid his battle to regain Italy, sent a rescript to British communities in 410 telling them to look to their own defence. Zosimus makes passing mention of this rescript while describing the reconquest of cities loyal to Attalus, and says nothing further about Britain. Historian Christopher Snyder wrote that protocol dictated that Honorius address his correspondence to imperial officials, and the fact that he did not implies that the cities of Britain were then the highest Roman authority remaining on the island.

At the time that the rescript was sent, Honorius had effectively lost Gaul and Spain, and was fortunate to have recovered Italy. He was in no position to offer relief to Britain. As for Constantine III, he was not equal to the intrigues of imperial Rome and by 411 his cause was spent. His son was killed along with those major supporters who had not turned against him, and he himself was assassinated.
==Interpretative variations==
There are various interpretations that characterise the events in a way that supports a particular thesis without taking issue with the basic chronology.

The historian Theodor Mommsen (&quot;Britain&quot;, 1885) said that &quot;It was not Britain that gave up Rome, but Rome that gave up Britain ...&quot;, arguing that Roman needs and priorities lay elsewhere. His position has retained scholarly support over the passage of time.

Michael Jones (&quot;The End of Roman Britain&quot;, 1998) took the opposite view, saying that it was Britain that left Rome, arguing that numerous usurpers based in Britain combined with poor administration caused the Romano-Britons to revolt. Certain scholars such as J. B. Bury (&quot;The Notitia Dignitatum&quot; 1920) and German historian Ralf Scharf, disagreed entirely with the standard chronology. They argued that the evidence in fact supports later Roman involvement in Britain, post 410.

==Factual disputes==

Regarding the events of 409 and 410 when the Romano-Britons expelled Roman officials and sent a request for aid to Honorius, Michael Jones (&quot;The End of Roman Britain&quot;, 1998) offered a different chronology to the same end result: he suggested that the Britons first appealed to Rome and when no help was forthcoming, they expelled the Roman officials and took charge of their own affairs.

Some historians suggest that the rescript of Honorius refers to the cities of the Bruttii (present-day Calabria), rather than to the cities of the Britons. The reference in Zosimus&#x27;s history to the Britons is in a passage describing events in northern Italy, and &quot;Britannia&quot; may have been a copying error for &quot;Brettia&quot;. This reading of Zosimus has been criticized as arbitrary and speculative, and has its own inconsistencies. Bruttium was not in northern Italy either, and it would normally have a governor for Honorius to correspond with instead of city leaders. The theory also contradicts the account of Gildas, who provides independent support that the reference is to Britain by repeating the essence of Zosimus&#x27;s account and clearly applying it to Britain.

E. A. Thompson (&quot;Britain, A.D. 406–410&quot;, in &quot;Britannia&quot;, 8 (1977), pp. 303–318) offered a more provocative theory to explain the expulsion of officials and appeal for Roman aid. He suggested that a revolt consisting of dissident peasants, not unlike the Bagaudae of Gaul, also existing in Britain, and when they revolted and expelled the Roman officials, the landowning class then made an appeal for Roman aid. There is no direct textual statement of this, though it might be plausible if the definition of &#x27;bagaudae&#x27; is changed to fit the circumstances. There is no need to do so, as any number of rational scenarios already fit the circumstances. There is the possibility that some form of bagaudae existed in Britain, but were not necessarily relevant to the events of 409 and 410. The alleged ubiquity of Pelagianism amongst the British population may have contributed to such a movement if it had existed, not to mention large-scale purges amongst the British elite over previous decades. Among the works that mention but skirt the issue is Koch&#x27;s &quot;Celtic Culture&quot; (2005), which cites Thompson&#x27;s translation of Zosimus and goes on to say &quot;The revolt in Britain may have involved bacaudae or peasant rebels as was the case in Armorica, but this is not certain.&quot;

His show was the &quot;longest running solo stand-up show in London and perhaps all of Britain&quot;, running in excess of 400 performances.

Schaffer performed his show &quot;Lewis Schaffer: American in London&quot; every Sunday at the Leicester Square Theatre in London for over three years until June 2014, making it the longest solo comedy residency at the theatre.

He has hosted &quot;Nunhead American Radio with Lewis Schaffer&quot; on Resonance 104.4FM London since 2009. The show is broadcast live every Monday at 6:30PM GMT. Guests have included comedians Russell Howard, Richard Herring, and Stewart Lee.

In 2009, he won the Malcolm Hardee Cunning Stunt Award for best publicity stunt at the Edinburgh Festival Fringe for persuading the magazine &quot;The List&quot; that he would be sponsoring the Edinburgh Comedy Awards. Schaffer said he had purchased the naming rights to the awards for £99 and his mother would be on the judging panel.

In 2017, he won the Wee Review Fringe Experience Award for his Fringe show &quot;Unopened Letters From My Mother&quot;, in which he opened and read a series of letters sent to him by his mother after he moved to London.

In 2025, Lewis is a very popular and regular star on the GBNews Headliners show.

==Personal life==
In September 2019, Schaffer was assaulted while he was cycling in south London. He received treatment for a broken nose and facial wounds at King&#x27;s College Hospital in Denmark Hill.

<doc id="815896" wikidata="Q1349394" url="?curid=815896" title="Richard Spruce">
<text>Richard Spruce (10 September 1817 – 28 December 1893) was an English botanist specializing in bryology. One of the great Victorian botanical explorers, Spruce spent 15 years exploring the Amazon from the Andes to its mouth, and was one of the very first Europeans to observe many of the places where he collected specimens. Spruce discovered and named a number of new plant species, and corresponded with some of the leading botanists of the nineteenth century.

== Early life and career ==
Richard Spruce was born near Ganthorpe, a small village near Castle Howard in Yorkshire. After training under his father, a local schoolmaster, Spruce began a career as a tutor and then as a mathematics master at St Peter&#x27;s School in York between 1839 and 1844.

Spruce started his botanical collecting in Yorkshire about 1833. In 1834, at age 16, he drew up a neatly written list of all of the plants he had found on trips around Ganthorpe, focusing on bryophytes. Arranged alphabetically and containing 403 species, the gathering and naming was Spruce&#x27;s first major contribution to local botany. Three years later he had drawn up a &quot;List of the Flora of the Malton District&quot; containing 485 species of flowering plants. Several of Spruce&#x27;s localities for the rarer plants are given in Henry Baines&#x27;s &quot;Flora of Yorkshire&quot;, published in 1840.

In 1842 Spruce visited Thomas Taylor, an Irish botanist who shared his interest in bryophytes. In 1844 his paper on &quot;The Musci and Hepaticae of Teesdale&quot;, the result of a three-week excursion, showed his skill at locating and identifying rare species. In Baines&#x27;s &quot;Flora of Yorkshire&quot; only four mosses were recorded from Teesdale. Spruce increased the record to 167 mosses and 41 hepaticae, of which six mosses and one liverwort were new to Britain.
In April, 1845, he published in the &quot;London Journal of Botany&quot; descriptions of 23 new British mosses, about half of which he had discovered himself. That year he also published his &quot;List of the Musci and Hepaticae of Yorkshire&quot; in &quot;The Phytologist&quot;. The list included 48 mosses new to the English flora and a further 33 new to Yorkshire.

Spruce came to the attention of William Jackson Hooker, the director of the Royal Botanic Gardens at Kew, and was recommended for a collecting expedition to the Pyrenees, which he undertook in 1845–1846. In 1846 he published &quot;Notes on the Botany of the Pyrenees&quot; and followed it with a more technical article, &quot;The Musci and Hepaticae of the Pyrenees&quot;, published in 1849. Spruce issued exsiccata-like series, among others the work &quot;Musci Pyrenaici, quos in Pyrenaeis centralibus occidentalibusque, nec non in agro Syrtico, A. D. 1845-6. Decerpsit Rich. Spruce&quot; (1847).

After Spruce proved his botanical skills in the Pyrenees, Hooker proposed a much more challenging expedition to Brazil. The prominent botanist George Bentham would act as broker and distributor of any specimens sent back to England. Despite his fragile health, Spruce accepted the proposal and spent a year at Kew becoming familiar with tropical botany. Spruce arrived at Pará on board the &quot;Britannia&quot; on 12 July 1849, and traveled up the Amazon River to Santarém where he first met two other young naturalists exploring the Amazon, Alfred Russel Wallace and Henry Walter Bates. Both subsequently well known for their work on natural selection, Wallace and Bates traveled along the tributaries of the Amazon, occasionally crossing paths with and sharing information with Spruce. Within the first two years of his expedition, Spruce had trekked along the full length of the river Trombetas to British Guiana, crossing over the Rio Negro to Manaos.

The plants and objects collected by Spruce from 1849 to 1864 (mostly in Brazil, Ecuador, and Peru) form an important botanical, historical and ethnological resource, and have been indexed at the New York Botanical Garden, at the Royal Botanic Gardens, Kew, London, at Trinity College Dublin, and at the University of Manchester. Towards the end of his expedition through South America, Spruce studied indigenous cultivation of cinchona in the Andes of Peru, then successfully exported seeds and young plants as requested by the government of India. The plant was cultivated to produce quinine, a drug used to prevent malaria.

==Later life==
By the time of his return to England in 1864, his health was broken and his savings lost to fraud. He spent the last 27 years of his life at Coneysthorpe, Yorkshire, near to where he was born. He received a small pension from the government and continued his botanical studies. He is buried in the churchyard of Terrington.

<doc id="815909" wikidata="Q190083" url="?curid=815909" title="Ural owl">
<text>The Ural owl (Strix uralensis) is a large nocturnal owl. It is a member of the true owl family, &quot;Strigidae&quot;. The Ural owl is a member of the genus &quot;Strix&quot;, that is also the origin of the family&#x27;s name under Linnaean taxonomy. Both its common name and scientific name refer to the Ural Mountains of Russia where the type specimen was collected. However, this species has an extremely broad distribution that extends as far west as much of Scandinavia, montane eastern Europe, and, sporadically, central Europe, thence sweeping across the Palearctic broadly through Russia to as far east as Sakhalin and throughout Japan. The Ural owl may include up to 15 subspecies, but most likely the number may be slightly fewer if accounting for clinal variations.

This forest owl is typical associated with the vast taiga forest in Eurosiberia, although it ranges to other forest types, including mixed forests and temperate deciduous forest. The Ural owl is something of a dietary generalist like many members of the &quot;Strix&quot; genus, but it is usually locally reliant on small mammals, especially small rodents such as voles. In terms of its reproductive habits, Ural owls tend to vigorously protect a set territory on which they have historically nested on a variety of natural nest sites, including tree cavities and stumps and nests originally built by other birds but now, in many parts of the range are adapted to nest boxes made by biologists and conservationists. Breeding success is often strongly correlated with prey populations. The Ural owl is considered to be a stable bird species overall, with a conservation status per the IUCN as a least concern species. Despite some local decreases and extinctions, the Ural owl has been aided in central Europe by reintroductions.

==Description==

Like most &quot;Strix&quot; species, it has a broad, rounded head with a correspondingly round facial disc, barring a tiny V-shaped indentation. The Ural owl has, for an owl, an exceptionally long tail that bears a wedge-shaped tip. In colour, it tends to be a plain pale greyish-brown to whitish overall (with more detailed description of their variation under subspecies), with a slightly darker grey-brown to brown back and mantle with contrasting whitish markings. The underparts are pale cream-ochre to grey-brown and are boldly (though sometimes more subtly) overlaid with dark brown streaking, without crossbars. Many variations are known in overall plumage colour both at the subspecies level and the individual level. However, the Ural owl usually appears as a rather pale grey-brown owl, usually lacking in the warmer, richer colour tones of many other &quot;Strix&quot; owls, with distinct streaking below. In flight, a Ural owl shows a largely buffish-white underwing marked with heavy dark bars around the trailing edge and tip, while the long white tipped tail often appears slung downwards. Their flight style is reminiscent of a buzzard but with deeper, more relaxed wing beats, with their style of flight often giving the appearance of quite a large bird. The eyes are dark brown, being relatively small and closely set to each other, which is opined to give them a less “fierce” countenance than that of a great grey owl (&quot;Strix nebulosa&quot;). The eyes are reminiscent of an almond in both shape and colour. The bill is yellowish in colour, with a dirty yellow cere. Meanwhile, the tarsi and toes are covered in greyish feathering and the talons are yellowish brown with darker tips.

The Ural owl is a rather large species. Full-grown specimens range in total length from , which may render them as roughly the eight longest owl species in the world (though many owls are heavier on average). Wingspan can vary in the species from . Like most birds of prey, the Ural owl displays reverse sexual dimorphism in size, with the female averaging slightly larger than the male. Reportedly talon size and body mass is the best way to distinguish the two sexes of Ural owl other than behavioral dichotomy based on observations in Finland. Weight is variable through the European part of the range. Males have been known to weigh from and females have been known to weigh from . Voous estimated the typical weight of males and females at and , respectively. It is one of the larger species in the &quot;Strix&quot; genus, being about 25% smaller overall than the great grey owl, the latter certainly being the largest of extant &quot;Strix&quot; species in every method of measurement. Body masses reported for some of the more southerly Asian species such as brown wood owl (&quot;Strix leptogrammica&quot;) and spotted wood owl (&quot;Strix selopato&quot;) (as well as the similarly sized but unweighed mottled wood owl (&quot;Strix ocellata&quot;)) show that they broadly overlap in body mass with the Ural owl or are even somewhat heavier typically despite being somewhat smaller in length, being somewhat stockier in build yet shorter tailed than the Ural owl. Despite having no published weights for adults, Père David&#x27;s owl (&quot;Strix davidi&quot;) seems to also be of a similar size to the Ural owl as well. Among standard measurements, in both sexes, wing chord can measure from across the range and tail length can from . Among extant owls, only the great grey owl is certain to have a longer tail. Though less frequently measured, the tarsus may range from and, in northern Europe, the total bill length measured from . The foot span can regularly reach around in full-grown owls.

===Vocalizations and ear morphology===

The song of the male is a deep rhythmic series of notes with a short pause after the first two notes, variously transcribed as &quot;wohu... huw-huhuwo&quot; or &quot;huow-huow-huow&quot;. The phrase repeats at intervals of several seconds. The male&#x27;s song may carry up to to human perception but usually is considered not quite that far-carrying. Peak singing times in Finland during springtime are 10 pm-12 am and more intensely at 1-3 am, which differed from the peak times for nest visits. The female has a similar but hoarser and slightly higher pitched song, giving it a more &quot;barking&quot; quality. Not infrequently, Ural owls will duet during courtship. In addition, a deep, hoarse heron-like &quot;kuwat&quot; or &quot;korrwick&quot; is probably used as a contact call. These are more elongated and harsher than the &quot;kewick&quot; note made by tawny owls (&quot;Strix aluco&quot;). Young beg with hoarse &quot;chrrreh&quot; calls, again similar to the ones by young tawny owls but deeper. Vocal behavior tends to peak in early spring until the young leave the nest, most often during incubation and nesting in the form of prey delivery countercalling. The alarm call, which is typically delivered during territorial rounds, of the male is coincidentally analogous to the territorial song of the short-eared owl (&quot;Asio flammeus&quot;), which is considered a somewhat hollow sounding hoot. The alarm call is audible at up to away. The Ural owl also has a particularly menacing bill-snapping display. In total, Swedish biologist reported that about nine different calls were uttered by Ural owls. Despite the range of calls, the species is generally very quiet for a large owl and may not vocalize even at peak times for perhaps up to nearly 2 days.

The ears of the Ural owl are quite large, averaging about on the left and on the right with the pre-aural dermal flap measuring about . In fact their ears are amongst the largest recorded in owls. In combination with their large ears, the well-developed facial disc shows the importance of sound to hunting to this and other owl who hunt in boreal zones. While the Ural owl was found to be aurally overdeveloped compared to other &quot;Strix&quot; such as the barred owl (&quot;Strix varia&quot;) it was found to be underdeveloped in comparison to owls more confined to true boreal type habitats, like the great grey owl and the boreal owl (&quot;Aegolius funereus&quot;).

===Confusion with similar owl species===
The Ural owl is a fairly distinctive looking bird but can be confused for other owls, especially with others in the &quot;Strix&quot; genus. The extralimital North American barred owl appears quite similar, the main feature differentiating the two being the Ural owl does not have concentric lines on its facial plate. The tawny owl is much smaller with a conspicuously shorter tail and a relatively larger head. The tawny species, which occurs variously in grey, brown and red morphs, has underparts with dark shaft-streaks and crossbars, as opposed to the heavy but straight streaking of the Ural owl. The great grey owl is larger than the Ural owl with a huge head and relatively even smaller yellow eyes while their facial disc has strong concentric lines. In colour, the great grey is distinctly more solidly uniform and somewhat dark greyish than the Ural owl. An unlikely species to mistake a Ural owl is the Eurasian eagle-owl (&quot;Bubo bubo&quot;) which is much larger (by a considerable margin the heaviest and longest winged owl in Europe) with prominent ear tufts, a squarish (not rounded) head shape and orange eyes as well as with distinctly different markings. Long-eared owls (&quot;Asio otus&quot;) are much smaller and slimmer, with prominent ear-tufts, orange eyes and more prominent dark markings. More similar than any in Europe, the closely related Père David&#x27;s owl does not occur in the same range as (other?) Ural owls but is darker in plumage, also with a facial disc marked with darker concentric lines. Due to its partially diurnal behaviour during warmer months, some authors consider it confusable with the very different looking (but similarly largish and long-tailed) Eurasian goshawk (&quot;Accipiter gentilis&quot;).

==Taxonomy==

The Ural owl was named by Peter Simon Pallas in 1771 as &quot;Strix uralensis&quot;, due to the type specimen having been collected in the Ural mountains range. While the Urals fall around the middle of the species&#x27; distribution, some authors such as Karel Voous lamented that a more broadly appropriate than Ural owl was not derived for the English common name. In other languages, the species is referred to as &quot;Slaguggla&quot;, or “attacking owl”, in Swedish, &quot;Habichtskauz&quot;, or “goshawk-owl”, in German or as the “long-tailed owl” in Russian. The Ural owl is a member of the &quot;Strix&quot; genus, which are quite often referred to as wood owls. Conservatively, about 18 species are currently represented in this genus, typically being medium to large sized owls, characteristically round-headed and lacking ear tufts, which acclimate to living in forested parts of various climatic zones. Four owls native to the neotropics are sometimes additionally included with the &quot;Strix&quot; genus but some authorities have also included these in a separate but related genus, &quot;Ciccaba&quot;. &quot;Strix&quot; owls have an extensive fossil record and have long been widely distributed. The genetic relationship of true owls is somewhat muddled and different genetic testings has variously indicated that &quot;Strix&quot; owls are related to disparate appearing genera like &quot;Pulsatrix&quot;, &quot;Bubo&quot; and &quot;Asio&quot;.

The tawny owl is thought to be a close relative of the Ural owl. Authors have hypothesized that the origin of the species divide followed Pleistocene continental glaciations segregated a southwest or southern group in temperate forest (i.e. the tawny) from an eastern one inhabiting cold, boreal ranges (i.e. the Ural). The species pattern is mirrored in other bird species, i.e. the European green woodpecker (&quot;Picus viridus&quot;) from the more northern transcontinental grey-headed woodpecker (&quot;Picus canus&quot;). After retreat of the continental ice masses, the ranges more recently penetrated each other. While the life history details of the tawny and Ural owls are largely corresponding, nonetheless the species have a number of morphological differences and are largely adapted to different climates, times of activity and habitats. Based on &quot;Strix&quot; fossil species from Middle Pleistocene (given the name &quot;Strix intermedia&quot;) in variously the Czech Republic, Austria and Hungary show from leg and wing bones indicate an animal of intermediate form and size between Ural and tawny owls. However, fossils of a larger and differently proportioned &quot;Strix&quot; owl than a tawny owl, identified as &quot;Strix brevis&quot;, from Germany and Hungary from before the Pleistocene (i.e. Piacenzian) and as well as diagnosed Ural owl fossils from disparate southerly deposits in Sardinia from the Early Pleistocene and in Middle Pleistocene deposits in the Pannonian Basin as well as much later during the early Holocene from far to the west in Belgium, France and Switzerland suggest a more complicated evolutionary and distributional history. A hybrid was recorded in captivity between a male Ural and a female tawny owl, which managed to produce two offspring that were intermediate in size and had a more complex song that was also shared some characteristics with both species&#x27; vocalizations.

Some species in America, such as namely the barred owl, are at times thought to be so closely related as well to the extreme that the Ural and barred and spotted owls (&quot;Strix occidentalis&quot;), have been considered to potentially be part of a species complex or even within the same species. However, there is no evidence nor likelihood that the &quot;Strix&quot; owls between America and Eurasia ever formed a continuous population given their adaptation to well-forested areas as well as the fact that the barred owl is more ecologically similar to the more generalized tawny owl, despite being of intermediate size between tawny and Ural owls (closer in size to the latter), and that the tawny does not range anywhere close to the boundary between North America and Russia as does the Ural. Certainly the most ambiguous aspect of the relations of Ural owl is the Père David&#x27;s owl which has both historically and currently been considered either an isolated subspecies of the Ural owl or a distinct species. It is thought that the Père David&#x27;s is likely a glacial relict of the mountainous forest of western China where plant and animal life often remain reminiscent of pre-glacial life. Recent study has indicated that the Père David&#x27;s owl is valid species based on appearance, voice, and life history differences, though genetic studies have shown a somewhat muddled diversity between races of the Ural owls species complex. It has been recognized by The Clements Checklist of Birds of the World but BirdLife International and IUCN still classify it as a subspecies of the Ural owl.

===Subspecies===

At least as many as 15 subspecies have been recognized by some authorities though some feel that there may be as few eight valid subspecies. Study of the phylogeographic genetics of Ural owls in Europe showed that they occur in about 5 distinct genetic clusters that do not correspond as well as expected to subspecies, and further that genetic exchange is considerable where subspecies ranges abut. The phylogeographic data indicates a continuous population in not the too distant history and discredits general classification of the species as a glacial relict, with isolation of populations likely being largely related to human interference.

*&quot;S. u. uralensis&quot; (Pallas, 1771)- This is the nominate subspecies, thought to be found in the inland part of the Russian Far East, Siberia to Yakutia and Okhotsk Coast south to Middle Volga, southern Ural, Tyumen and Yalutorovsky. The wing chord of males is whilst that of females is . A small sample of males weighed while one female weighed . Light and dark morphs occur in the nominate race, the former being much more numerous. This subspecies is likely the palest form of Ural owl, with some Siberian owls so completely whitish and faintly marked as to momentarily suggest a snowy owl (&quot;Bubo scandianus&quot;). The typical light morph has facial disc of dirty whitish to pale ochraceous-grey colour, while the rim around disc consists of rows of small dark spots. The upperparts are pale greyish-brown, mottled, spotted and streaked variously with whitish and dusky and the scapulars have a rather large area of white. The throat is whitish, while the remaining underside is very pale greyish-brown to dirty whitish with heavy but not dark brown streaking. The tarsi and toes are feathered in a pale greyish-brown to dirty whitish-cream colour.
*&quot;S. u. davidi&quot; (Sharpe, 1875)- The Père David&#x27;s owl. It is found in the mountains of central China (Qinghai and Sichuan). There is debate over whether it is a separate species or an isolated subspecies of Ural owl.
*&quot;S. u. liturata&quot; (Tengmalm, 1795)- This race is found in northern Europe from eastern Norway, Lapland and elsewhere in Sweden, throughout the range in Finland, to the Baltic region (mainly northern Belarus), eastern Poland, the eastern Alps down, the easternmost Carpathian Mountains, east to the Volga. Birds of this race sometimes intergrade in the eastern part of the range with the nominate subspecies. Wing chord of males is and in females is . Tail length is . Known body masses have been reported as in males. Despite being linearly smaller than &quot;S. u. marcoura&quot;, a large sample of female Ural owls in Finland showed that they were surprisingly some 16% heavier than those in Romania, with 542 averaging , with a range of . Some females of the subspecies though may weigh as little as and, unlike the Ural owl species overall, may show some level of compliance to Bergmann&#x27;s rule. This race is fairly similar in appearance to the nominate form but averages a fair bit darker, with richer, darker brown streaking below in most birds that extends to the bottom rim of the facial disc and typically less extensive white spotting and mottling about the back and mantle.

*&quot;S. u. macroura&quot; (Wolf, 1810)- This race, which comes close but is usually found in different areas than &quot;S. u. liturata&quot; is native to the western Carpathians, Transylvanian Alps and south to the West Balkans. In both sexes the wing chord may range from . Tail length is . Going on linear measurements, this is the largest bodied race of Ural owl, despite having the most southerly range of any race in Europe. In Romania, 40 males weighed an average of , with a range of , and 57 females weighed an average of , with a range of . However, both individual males and females that were heavier than the largest in the above sample are known for this race. This is probably the darkest coloured of Ural owl races. A typical adult is covered in a brownish ochraceous on the facial disc and the underside, which also has very broad and blackish streaking. Meanwhile, in a typical bird the back is a dark grey-brown which make the white portions on the wings stand in contrast. Dark morphs are also not infrequent. In a sample of 522 &quot;S. u. macroura&quot;, 11.7% were dark morphs, while previously it was estimated that only about 6% were dark morphs. Locally, even as many as 15% of birds may be dark morphs. Dark morphs are a rich, dark chocolate brown overall, especially on the facial disc. The mantle of dark morphs is dark coffee brown with mildly different grey-brown streaking, lacking the white spots seen on this area on other Ural owls. The underside usually show dark chocolate brown streaks over a mid-brown base colour.
*&quot;S. u. yenisseensis&quot; (Buturlin, 1915)- This race is found in the Central Siberian Plateau to Transbaikal and northwestern Mongolia but they are mainly recorded as winter vagrants in the latter two areas. The wing chord of males is while in females it is . Tail length is from . This race is fairly similar to the nominate subspecies but is typically a little less whitish overall and typically overall much smaller than it as well as most European Ural owls. Hybrids between this and the nominate subspecies are known to occur.
*&quot;S. u. nikolskii&quot; (Buturlin, 1907)- According to some authorities, this race includes previously recognized subspecies of &quot;S. u. daurica&quot;, &quot;S. u. taibanai&quot; and &quot;S. u. corrensis&quot;. This race is found in Transbaikal north and east to Vitim, Sakhalin and south to the Korean peninsula. This race is quite small, being smaller than all races to the west of it and only mildly larger than the Ural owls of Japan. The wing chord of males is and that of females is . One male weighed while a small sample of females weighed . More so than other Russian subspecies, this race is similar to &quot;S. u. liturata&quot; in Europe but distantly separated in distribution. Compared to that race as well as the sometimes overlapping &quot;S. u. yenisseensis&quot;, in &quot;S. u. nikolskii&quot; the head, nape and shoulders typically have a brownish colour (suggesting a cape) which is contrasted more strongly with the whiter light areas.

*&quot;S. u. fuscescens&quot; (Temminck &amp; Schlegel, 1847)- This Japanese race is found from western and southern Honshu to Kyushu. This race is quite small. Despite being sometimes opined as the smallest race, it appears to be slightly larger than the Ural owls found in Hokkaido. The wing chord of males is and that of females is . The upperparts are marked with a distinct yellowish rufescent-brown colour. Meanwhile, the underparts are yellowish rusty with dark brown streaks and often are overlaid with rounded white spots. The feathering of the toes and tarsi are solidly brownish.
*&quot;S. u. hondoensis&quot; (Clark 1907)- This race may include &quot;S. u. japonica&quot;. If it includes &quot;japonica&quot;, this race is found throughout Hokkaido down through northern and central Honshu. Quite to the contrary of Bergmann&#x27;s rule, northern owls in Hokkaido are the smallest ones, and indeed the smallest known in the entire Ural owl species, while southerly owls are slightly larger. Otherwise birds from the different islands are similar in appearance. The wing chord of males is and that of females is . Tail length in Hokkaido is while in Honshu it is . Compared to other Japanese birds (i.e. &quot;S. u. fuscescens&quot;) and indeed most other races is of a rather rusty brown colour overall, while most individuals show little to no white speckling on the head, back and mantle.

==Distribution== 
The Ural owl has a large distribution. In mainland Europe, its modern distribution is quite spotty, with the species being found in central Europe in southeastern Germany, central and eastern areas of the Czech Republic, southern Austria, all but western Slovenia, and spottily but broadly in several areas of western, southern and northeastern Poland. The distribution in Germany is particularly nebulous (and perhaps aided by reintroductions branching from the well-known Bavarian population), with evidence of Ural owls apparently residing (and possibly nesting) considerably away from currently known haunts in Egge far to the west and mysteriously turning up rather to the north in Harz and Lüneburg Heath. In eastern Europe, the species is found in eastern Croatia, Bosnia and Herzegovina, western Serbia, montane west-central Bulgaria, montane central Romania, much of Slovakia, southwestern Ukraine, southern and eastern Lithuania, northern Belarus, eastern Latvia and much of Estonia. In Scandinavia, its distribution is quite broad, though it is only found in southeastern part of Norway, as Ural owls may be found ranging across most of Sweden and Finland but is absent from the northern stretches as well as southern Sweden (largely the peninsular area). Its range in Russia is extensive but it is absent from areas where habitat is not favorable. In western and European Russia, it is found as far south roughly as the Bryansk, Moscow and northern Samara north continuously to Kaliningrad, the southern part of the Kola Peninsula and Arkhangelsk. In the eponymous Ural region, it is found from roughly Komi south to Kamensk-Uralsky. In the general area of Siberia, the Ural owl is found widely discontinuing its typical range in the foothills of the Altai Mountains to the west and being found north roughly as far as Batagay in the east. The species&#x27; distribution is continuous to the Russian Far East to as far as Okhotsk Coast and Magadan, Khabarovsk Krai and Sakhalin. Out of Russia, the range of the Ural owl continues into northeastern Mongolia, Northeastern China inland nearly as far as Beijing and down to Shandong and throughout the Korean Peninsula. The Ural owl is also distributed through all five of the main islands of Japan (i.e. only absent from Okinawa/Ryukyu Islands to the south). Vagrancy has been reported in Europe and Russia, which may account for sightings of the species almost throughout Germany. Furthermore, 16 records exist of the species in northern Italy.

==Habitat==

Ural owls tend to occur in mature but not too dense primary forest, which can variously be in coniferous, mixed or deciduous areas. Normally, they prefer to be close to an opening. These are often compromised by forest bogs with wet ground underfoot is overgrown by a mixture of spruce, alder and/or birch or by damp heathland with scattered trees. Predominant trees in much of the range are often spruce, fir and pine forests in north and alder, beech and birch with mixtures of the above conifers in the south. Quite often they are adapted to high elevation forest in mountains, but in remote wildlands they can adapt equally well to areas down to sea level.

In the Carpathian Mountains, they tend to favor almost exclusively beech-dominated forests, normally at elevations of above sea level. Forest characteristics of these beech-dominated woods showed that during forest management showed they need at least of woods to persist, with parts of the forests needing to be at least 45–60 years old. Carpathian Ural owls typically occur far from human habitations and woodland edge not surrounded by forest and typically avoid parts of the forest with steep slopes or with dense undergrowth. Carpathian birds often preferred areas with glades that bear gaps between the trees often around or so and usually with plentiful broken trees. Young, post-dispersal owls in the Carpathians birds show less strong habitat preferences and may utilized wooded corridors that often are connected to remaining ideal habitat areas. Reportedly the countries of Slovakia, Slovenia then Romania have the most extensive ideal habitat in the Carpathians and resultingly have the highest local densities of Ural owls, perhaps in all of Europe. Forest predominant in beech were also seemingly preferred by the reintroduced Ural owls in Bavarian Forest, again with old growth preferred with plentiful sun exposure. Bavarian owls occurred in areas that were also often rich in large mammals since their preference for access to parts of the forest with broken trees and openings often coincided. Further north in Latvia, forests inhabited were usually far older than was prevalent in the regional environment, usually with a preference for forest areas with trees at least 80 years old. Finnish populations apparently most often occur in spruce dominated forest, usually having discreetly segregated forest preferences apart from sympatric species of owls except for the boreal owl, which also preferred spruce areas but occurred more regularly when the dominant Ural owls are scarce. In the taiga of western Finland, it was found that biodiversity was consistently higher in the vicinity of Ural owl nests than outside these vicinities, rendering the Ural owl as perhaps a “keystone species” for the local ecosystem. Riverine forests with birch and poplar are often utilized in the taiga as well as spruce or fir forests (montane taiga) in the Ussuri river area. Generally in northern climes such as Finland and western Russia, wherein the Lapland area the Ural owl is likely to reach the northernmost part of its range, it is adaptive to Subarctic areas possibly up to the tree line but does not adapt as well as the great grey owl to areas of dwarf forest just south of the tundra, generally needing taller, more mature forests to the south of this.

Historically, they normally occur in remote, little disturbed areas far from human habitations. The Ural owl is largely restricted from areas where forest fragmentation has occurred or park-like settings are predominant, as opposed to the smaller, more adaptive tawny owl which acclimates favorably to such areas. On the contrary, in some peri-urbanized areas of Russia, such as the metropolitan parks and gardens so long as habitat is favorable and encouraging of prey populations, the Ural owl has been known to successfully occur. Some towns and cities whose region hold some populations of Ural owls are Chkalov, Kirov, Barnaul, Krasnoyarsk and Irkutsk, and even sometimes Leningrad and Moscow. Changes in nesting habits due to the erection of nest boxes has almost allowed Ural owls to nest unusually close to human habitations in the western part of the range, especially in Finland. An exceptional record of synanthropization in this species for Europe was recorded in Košice, Slovakia where a 10-15 year apparent increase of an unknown number of owls have been observed between the months of November and June. At least one Ural owl was recorded to habituate the city of Ljubljana in Slovenia but there was no evidence it was able to breed or establish a territory given the limited nature of woodlands in the vicinity.

==Behaviour==
The Ural owl is often considered nocturnal with peaks of activity at dusk and just before dawn. However, taken as a whole and since it mainly lives the taiga zone where very long summer days are the norm against extensive dark during the winter, Ural owls are not infrequently fully active during daylight hours during the warmer months, while brooding young. Presumably during winter, they are mostly active during the night. Thus, the species may be more correctly classified as cathemeral as is much of their main prey. The wide range of activity times, and partial adaption to daytime activity, is further indicated by the relatively small eyes that the species possesses. This contrasts strongly with the tawny owl, which almost always fully nocturnal. During the day, Ural owls may take rests on a roost, which is most typically a branch close to trunk of a tree or in dense foliage. Normally, Ural owls are not too shy and may be approached quite closely. Historically, European birdwatchers often consider the species to be rather elusive and hard to observe. However, as the species as acclimated to nest boxes closer to areas where humans frequent, especially in Fennoscandia, encounters have increased sharply.

===Territoriality and movements===
The Ural owl is a highly territorial and residential species that, as a rule, tends to stay on the same home range throughout the year. While most boreal owls, such as great grey owl and boreal owl, are generally given to nomadism and irruptive movements, with nearly the entire population following the population cycle of their primary prey, the Ural owl rarely departs from its home range even when prey populations decrease. Apart from the great grey species, like the Ural, most species in the &quot;Strix&quot; genus of owls are both highly territorial and non-migratory. Territories are generally maintained with songs, most often uttered by the male of the resident pair. This is quite the norm for owls in almost every part of the world. Due probably to its natural scarcity, very few firsthand accounts are known of territorial fights between adults but they presumably occur as Ural owls can be quite aggressive owls (or are at least in the context of protecting their nests). However, according to a study in southern Poland, Ural owls are generally less aggressive in the non-breeding seasons than are tawny owls to other owls and may be slightly tolerant of smaller owl species on their home range while the tawny is less so. That the Ural is slightly less aggressively territorial than the tawny owl is also supported in a study from Slovenia when tawnys had more spirited calls to recorded calls and launched more aggressive attacks to the taxidermied specimens of Ural, boreal and owls of their own species than did the Ural owls to any of the same stated stimuli. As for movements, as opposed to the sedentary adults, immatures may wander distances of up to about . An occasional individual may wander straggle even further and remain for some time in a wintering area. A small number of straggling young Ural owls may occur irregularly down in southeastern Europe outside of the typical range of the species. Some circumstantial evidence was reported of Ural owls moving downhill in mountains in Japan when snowfall was heavy. Siberian population shows somewhat southward movements in severe winters, as the number of prey animals plummets and the owls themselves face risk of freezing.

==Dietary biology==
This is a fairly powerful species of owl. However, like owls of nearly all sizes, mostly it prefers to take small prey relative to itself, especially small mammals. In a great majority of dietary studies, somewhere between 50 and 95% of the food is mammalian. Prey consists mostly of various species of rodent, though shrews and, locally, moles can be a regular food source as well. In addition, any variety of small mammal, to the size of hares (albeit usually young ones), may too be fairly often taken, as well as variable numbers of birds, amphibians and invertebrates, with reptiles and perhaps fish being very rare prey. Across the wide distribution, the Ural owl is known to take more than 200 prey species, of which more than 80 are mammals. In a compilation study of the diet in three European study areas and four different years found that the mean prey body mass taken per nest was estimated to vary from with an average estimated at .

Most hunting efforts are undertaken from a perch. They usually prefer prey that comes into open spots of the forest rather than those that frequent the forest floor. In Slovakia, in addition to glades and meadows near tall forests, Ural owls have been somewhat acclimated to hunting in open areas that are human sourced, including areas of forest fragmentation and even agricultural areas and small towns and villages if they are adjacent to mature forest patches. Little direct study has gone into the hunting methods of this predator. It is quite possible that is to some extent a still-hunter, perching for some time on a prominent tree until prey becomes apparent into the vicinity. However, in Scandinavia, Ural owls were reported to hunt more like goshawks rather than the more still-hunting tawny owls, with a perch-hunting method wherein they fly in brief spurts from perch to perch, with the flights meant to be inconspicuous until prey is detected. Ural owls are not known to attack prey from active flight, instead nearly always dropping down on it directly from its perch. In Japan, experimental studies of semi-captive Ural owls were undertaken to observe how the owls select which areas to hunt in and which prey to select. When experimentally exposed to patches where prey was present and patches where prey was not present, Ural owls would forage in both but would seem to learn which patches were more likely to have food and subsequently forage more extensively around them. When the same biologists observed the foraging patterns on field mice and also voles, they similarly learned and showed a preference for the patches that held larger species over smaller ones. On evidence, though prey selection is largely opportunistic, rodents at risk of starvation in the Japanese studies were more likely to risk foraging in relatively open spots of the ground, so therefore would be preferentially selected by the Ural owls. Based on the Japanese studies, Ural owls seem to be able to improve their resource utilization patterns as they accumulate experience within their environment. Different studies in Japan showed that the Ural owls are capable of hunting prey that is hiding in shallow snow or near the snow&#x27;s surface during winter but voles hiding in the subnivean zone, ephemeral tunnels made under deep snow by the voles, are largely inaccessible to these owls. Surplus food may be stored at the nest or at nearby depots. The first verified record of scavenging on carrion was recorded when a Ural owl fed on the carcass of a roe deer (&quot;Capreolus capreolus&quot;), although an earlier record exists of a Ural owl visiting a wolf&#x27;s kill (though it was not clear that the owl fed in that case).

===Mammals===

Voles, small-to-medium-sized rodents with characteristically short tails, are often considered the most significant portion of the diet in almost every part of the distribution. Generally, in several parts to the west of their range, the Ural owl is associated with two vole prey species in particular, field voles (&quot;Microtus agrestis&quot;) and bank voles (&quot;Myodes glareolus&quot;). These voles tend to be solitary and fairly widely dispersed but habituate to favorable habitats for the Ural owls, such as the opener margins of extensive forested areas, and can quite numerous when vole populations peak. Per study in Finland, Ural owls took field and bank voles that averaged larger than the average weight of those captured in the field by biologist, i.e. the weight of those caught by owls was estimated at for field voles vs for bank voles, while those caught by biologists averaged for fields vs for banks. 56% of the field voles those caught by Ural owls were reproductively active, while 44% of bank voles were active as such. Helminths did not appear to make field voles more vulnerable to predation but male field voles were far more often caught by Ural owls than females, 76% of those caught in a study in Finland being male of those caught around vole nests, with 52% of the ones caught in fields being male. However, pregnant female field voles were found to be more vulnerable than other age female voles. More socially inclined and concentrated voles such as common voles (&quot;Microtus arvalis&quot;) tend to occur in more extensive open areas so forest-dwelling owls such as the Ural tend hunt them relatively scarcely, but only relative to many other predators. The largest known dietary study to date occurred in Finland, with 5995 prey items examined across several study years. According to this data, a much larger vole was preferred in the diet where available, the European water vole (&quot;Arvicola amphibius&quot;). With an estimated mean weight of , the water vole constituted an estimated 22.15% of the prey by number and 52.2% of the biomass, against 19.5% by number and 18% of the biomass being made up by field voles. The average estimated prey weight overall within the study was estimated at . Another, albeit smaller, central Finnish study showed field voles leading by number over water voles, 42.7% against 33.9%, among 1739 prey items respectively, but with the two species constituting 17.4% and 69.1% of the prey biomass. Southern Finnish studies showed sharp shifts in the import of vole prey due to their population cycles. In southern Finland, of 3351 prey items in a peak vole year, 58.43% by number and 42.8% by biomass of the prey was made of by field voles, followed by bank vole at 12.41% by number (but only 5.73% by biomass) and water voles at 22.24% by biomass (but only 10.1% by number). In the same study area during a poor vole year, amongst 860 prey items, voles trailed other prey such as birds and shrews by number, but water voles were taken more or less in the same numbers here as in the peak vole years. Another study estimated the mean weight of Finnish Ural owl prey as . Similar dietary habits were found for Ural owls in Sweden, in 2309 prey items, water voles made up 33.1% of prey by number and 60% of the biomass, field voles composed 30.8% by number and 14.5% of the biomass and bank voles made up 11.8% of the prey by number and 3.3% of the biomass. Camera traps recording captured 187 prey items for Ural owls in 5 nests in Värmland County, Sweden found that voles were secondary in delivery rates to common shrew (&quot;Sorex araneus&quot;) and various birds with the small size of such prey requiring frequent deliveries although this was offset with fair numbers of young hares apparently available to these owls.

As the Ural owl ranges south, prey populations tend to become slightly less cyclical but also apparent access to large prey such as water vole appears to be reduced. In the relatively northerly Latvia, of 2615 prey items, voles constituted just over half the diet and the prey base was relatively diverse. For Latvian owls, the main prey species were bank vole (at 18.09% by number, 9.2% by biomass), field vole (17.13% by number, 13.85% by biomass) thence European mole (&quot;Talpa europaea&quot;) (9.83% by number, 12.3% biomass), the latter at a mature mass of about . In Belarus, &quot;Microtus&quot; species were quite regular prey in vole peak years, at 45% by number and 29.9% biomass, against crash years when they were merely 6.7% by number and 4% by biomass while the less cyclical bank voles were 29% by number and 20.4% in biomass in peak years and 38.1% by number, 23.8% by biomass in crash years. Furthermore, in Belarus, shrews and moles went from 6.4% to 14.3% by number during the peak and crash years (biomass in crash years was 13.1% though only 2.2% of this was from shrews). In the Beskids of southwestern Poland, the mean prey mass of 1039 prey items was a quite low with the main prey species being the bank vole, making up an average of 27.7% of prey by number and 25% of the biomass (average estimated weight ), common voles constituting on average 24.9% of the prey by number and 25.8% of biomass (average estimated weight ), yellow-necked mouse (&quot;Apodemus flavicollis&quot;) on average 15.73% of prey number and 17.4% of biomass (average estimated weight ) and European pine vole (&quot;Microtus subterraneus&quot;) at an average of 8.9% of the prey numbers and 5.8% biomass (average estimated weight ). Outside of voles and field mice, other prey appears to be largely negligible in the Polish Beskids. In Slovakia, amongst 2134 prey items, the main prey species were the yellow-necked mouse (21.8%), common vole (18.3%), bank vole (14.3%), striped field mouse (&quot;Apodemus agrarius&quot;) (4.9%) and European pine vole (4.7%). In the reintroduced Ural owls of the Bavarian forest among a small sample of 117 prey items, similar small rodent types were appearing to be largely selected, such as &quot;Apodemus&quot; species (16.2%), field voles (15.3%), bank vole (13.6%) as well as unidentified voles. Diets of the Ural owls towards the southeast part of the Europe range have mainly been recorded in Slovenia. The broadest study found that of 1268 prey items, 45.9% of the diet was voles, particularly the bank vole (38.1% by number, 26.24% by biomass), with another 34.2% made up of by &quot;Apodemus&quot; species (as well as 28.2% of the biomass) and a large portion of dormice, especially the large edible dormouse (&quot;Glis glis&quot;), at 6% by number and 25.5% by biomass. More locally in a smaller block within Slovenia, up to 58.8% by number and 94.4% by biomass in the Ural owl&#x27;s diet is compromised by the edible dormouse, whose adult body mass can vary from .

Further east and out of Europe, the general reliance on small rodents for Ural owls is fairly consistent. In one of the most westerly studies, from Mordovia, Russia, of 426 prey items the main prey species were common voles (41.8%), bank voles (31.4%), tundra voles (&quot;Microtus oeconomus&quot;) (5.9%) and Ural field mouse (&quot;Apodemus uralensis&quot;) (3.1%). At five study sites in the Ural Mountains region, among 870 prey items, 75.2% were mammals. 29.54% of the diet in the Urals were bank vole, 16.55% were common vole, 5.52% were wood mouse (&quot;Apodemus sylvaticus&quot;) and 4.83% were unidentified &quot;Myodes&quot; voles. Further east, the general reliance on &quot;Myodes&quot;, also known collectively as red-backed voles, outside of the far-ranging bank vole seems to increase somewhat. Much further east in the Pacific coastal Primorsky Krai, 1163 total prey items were examined. Here rodents of similar character, though largely of different species, were largely taken by Ural owls, such as the northern red-backed vole (&quot;Myodes rutilus&quot;) (39.2% by number), reed vole (&quot;Microtus fortis&quot;) (24.24%), &quot;Apodemus&quot; sp. (9.7%), Korean field mouse (&quot;Apodemus peninsulae&quot;) (3.52%). In the isles of Japan, the smallish local races of Ural owls seem to assume the dietary generalist &quot;Strix&quot; owl ecological niche to some extent, in a similar way the tawny owl does to the west, however the primary portions of its diet are still assumed by many of the same prey genera taken elsewhere. In the Yatsugatake Mountains, 1026 small mammals were identified at 17 Ural owl nest of which &quot;Apodemus&quot; species compromised 71%, followed by voles, at 24%, and Japanese shrew mole (&quot;Urotrichus talpoides&quot;), at 5%. In Koshimizu, Hokkaido, of 266 prey items from 111 total pellets, the diet led by grey red-backed vole (&quot;Myodes rufocanus&quot;) (25.2%), large Japanese field mouse (&quot;Apodemus speciosus&quot;) (17.7%), and small Japanese field mouse (&quot;Apodemus argenteus&quot;) (15.8%).

Shrews of nearly 20 species are taken more or less throughout the Ural owl&#x27;s range. Although not significant typically in the prey mass for the owls, the taking of shrews may allow the owls to stave off hunger. The smallest mammal and vertebrate prey known to be taken by Ural owls is the Eurasian least shrew (&quot;Sorex minutissimus&quot;), which has a median adult body mass of about . Other small mammals taken normally in rather low volume by Ural owls are bats, flying squirrels and weasels. Larger mammals are taken as well by Ural owls, and can be considered occasional supplemental prey despite often being significant in the prey biomass. The species takes mammalian prey larger than the typical voles and mice far less so than in larger owls such as eagle-owls. Among these are a few species of squirrel, most of which weigh more than as adults, in Europe exclusively the far-ranging red squirrel (&quot;Sciurus vulgaris&quot;), as well as rats, especially the brown rat (&quot;Rattus norvegicus&quot;) which made up nearly 20% of the diet in a Hokkaido study. Adult hedgehogs of a couple species are opportunistically taken at times in Europe and European hedgehogs (&quot;Erinaceus europaeus&quot;) taken in Finland were estimated to average about . Introduced muskrats (&quot;Ondatra zibethicus&quot;), which weigh on average an estimated when caught, are also taken in Finnish studies. They have been known to prey upon the Japanese giant flying squirrel (&quot;Petaurista leucogenys&quot;), which weighs around a median of . One large mammalian prey widely associated with Ural owls are hares, though they seldom occur in substantial numbers in the diet, they appear to be opportunistically taken in most parts of the range. As much as nearly 25% of their biomass may be hares and hares are the largest known prey to be taken by Ural owls. While hunting hares, Ural owls usually focus their hunts on relatively young specimens. In Europe, both European hares (&quot;Lepus europaeus&quot;) and, especially, mountain hares (&quot;Lepus timidus&quot;) may be hunted. The mean size of mountain hares taken in Finland have variously been estimated at , with a common median being about . Exceptionally, Ural owls may take even adult mountain hares, which average about , but this may be unconfirmed. Japanese hares (&quot;Lepus brachyurus&quot;) may also be taken in Japan as well.

===Other prey===

The second most important prey group behind mammals (albeit considerably behind) is birds. Birds are also the most diverse prey group in the Ural owl&#x27;s diet, with well over 100 avian prey species recorded. Birds usually compromise less than 10% of the dietary intake by number in studies from Europe. Exceptionally high numbers, relatively speaking, were reported in Fennoscandia, especially when vole numbers go down. In bad vole years in Finland, of 860 prey items, 32.2% by number and 40.25% by biomass were birds. In particular, thrushes of the &quot;Turdus&quot; genus were the most reported prey genera in these years, averaging 19.4% by number and 23.6% of the biomass. In Värmland County, Sweden, birds amounted to 25.6% of the prey by number and 32.67% of the biomass. A wide diversity of birds were reported, thrushes being again the most often identified. For central and southern Europe, the reintroduced population of the Bavarian Forest of Germany may show the highest results for birds at merely 11.1%. However, in the diet study in the city of Košice, Slovakia, urban-adapted Ural owls were found to be relying almost solely on pigeons and doves for foods, namely the Eurasian collared dove (&quot;Streptopelia decaocto&quot;) and the rock pigeon (&quot;Columba livia&quot;) which constituted 76.7% and 13.4% of the contents of 16 pellets, respectively. In Russia, birds were far more significant overall in the Urals over other known studies, amounting to 17.01% of the 870 total prey items across different years and 47.6% among 146 prey items more locally near towns and villages in Perm Krai. In Japan, birds are somewhat more prominent in the diet of Ural owls compared to European data, usually compromising over 10% of the foods. The most birds reported in the diet of Japanese Ural owls were from 36 pellets found in Sakaide, Kagawa, which mainly comprised small birds, in particular the Eurasian tree sparrow (&quot;Passer montanus&quot;) (at 78.6% by number) and the white-cheeked starling (&quot;Spodiopsar cineraceus&quot;) (3.6%).

The hunting of birds by the Ural owl seems almost entirely based on opportunity as there is little evidence that they track down birds of any particular type, just merely upon the chance of encounter or detection. Thrushes are probably taken in many parts of the range due to their relative commonality in the habitat types used by Ural owls while other passerines that are widely taken also often have similar habitat preferences such as Old World flycatchers, finches and tits. Most passerines, and indeed most identified birds overall, are in between the size of a chaffinch (&quot;Fringilla coelebs&quot;), at a mean weight of and a Eurasian jay (&quot;Garrulus glandarius&quot;), at a mean weight of . Bird prey may occasionally range down to the size of the goldcrest (&quot;Regulus regulus&quot;), which is Europe&#x27;s smallest bird species. The mean estimated weight of birds taken in Finland was estimated at , being slightly higher than the weight estimated of mammals taken there. A diversity of corvids may be taken, ranging in size from azure-winged magpies (&quot;Cyanopica cyanus&quot;), at , to carrion crows (&quot;Corvus corone&quot;), at , but usually turn up in low numbers in dietary studies and these owls are far less prolific corvid hunters than some diurnal predators such as &quot;Accipiters&quot;. Other than pigeons and doves, non-passerine bird prey are usually taken relatively infrequently, although some prey families such as gamebirds and woodpeckers are also quite widely taken. An unusual preference for relatively large bird prey was reported in study from the Urals where the most frequently identified avian prey species were the hazel grouse (&quot;Bonasa bonasia&quot;) and the hooded crow (&quot;Corvus cornix&quot;). On infrequent occasions, Ural owls may be able to overtake bird prey of up to approximately their own size or somewhat larger, i.e. up to or slightly over in average body mass, such as adult mallard (&quot;Anas platyrhynchos&quot;), common goldeneye (&quot;Bucephala clangula&quot;), black grouse (&quot;Tetrao tetrix&quot;), common pheasant (&quot;Phasianus colchicus&quot;), chicken (&quot;Gallus gallus domesticus&quot;), black-crowned night-heron (&quot;Nycticorax nycticorax&quot;) and some accipitrids as well as, so far as is known, only young specimens of the larger still western capercaillie (&quot;Tetrao urogallus&quot;). Outside of aforementioned families other infrequently taken bird prey has included cuckoos, nightjars, sandpipers, terns, rollers and hoopoes.

Due likely in no small part to the scarcity of herpetological prey diversity in the temperate and often frigid haunts of Ural owls, reptiles are very infrequent prey for this species. However, sometimes frogs may be taken when a Ural owl opportunes upon one in the warmer months of the year. Usually, in nearly any part of the range, frogs and other amphibians constitute less than 6% of the regional diets for the species. In the small Swedish study from Värmland County, an exceptional 12.2% of delivered prey was common frogs (&quot;Rana temporaria&quot;). In spite of historic records of fish scales being found seldom in some pellets, there is no known reportage of confirmed predation on fish by Ural owls in dietary studies. There is little evidence that in most of the range that Ural owls invest much time into pursuing or feeding on insects and other invertebrates, since the food reward is low for a fairly large owl to habitually hunt such prey, which may weigh only about . However, occasionally, concentrations of insects such as woodboring beetles may attract an owl. In the Bavarian Forest, more than 6% of the diet consisted of insects, mostly unidentified beetles. Despite most studies from Japan showing up to about 95% of the foods being mammals and secondarily birds, sometimes more extensive association with insect prey is reported. In the Kagawa Prefecture, an exceptional 24% of the diet consisted of insects and furthermore in Kyoto, Ural owls were observed to be routinely pursuing and eating Japanese rhinoceros beetles (&quot;Allomyrina dichotoma&quot;). In Primorsky Krai, Ural owls were further recorded as preying upon Daurian crayfish (&quot;Cambaroides dauricus&quot;).

===Interspecific predatory relationships===
Ural owls regularly live concurrently in different parts of their range with other owl species. Most sympatric species also share a preference for small mammals, largely voles, especially when they occur in relatively northerly temperate places such as the haunts of the Ural owls. Thus, the Ural owl is frequently considered to be a competitor with sympatric owl species. Most especially, the Ural owl has often being compared and studied in areas of sympatry with its close cousin, the tawny owl. The tawny owl may co-exist with Ural owls today in many parts of the latter&#x27;s European distribution, including southern Fennoscandia, eastern and central Europe and European Russia. The dietary habits of the two species are largely concurrent, as in Uppland, Sweden, where prey species and groups were almost identical in rank of importance to their diets (i.e. field vole, water vole, &quot;Apodemus&quot; species, birds and frogs). On Mount Krim in Slovenia, both tawny and Ural owls took the same primary prey species but the tawny owl was shown to be adaptable to alternate prey during the low part of the vole population cycle while the Ural was less adaptive to alternate prey. The diets were largely similar between tawny and Ural owls as well in the Bavarian Forest of Germany but the tawny species took proportionately fewer field voles and more insects, and was estimated to take prey weighing on average 43% less than that taken by Ural owls. In Finland, food niche breadth for Ural owls overlapped about 73% with the tawny owl but the mean prey size was more than twice as much for the Ural owl, for tawny vs for Ural, and the tawny owl was recorded to take non-mammalian prey significantly more so than Ural owls. In Belarus, tawny owl prey sizes were between 31 and 49% smaller on average (utilizing two different calculation methods) than those of Ural owl but the smaller species had a considerably greater food niche breadth, which averaged 12.96 for tawnys and 5.48 for Urals. Compared to the tawny owl, the Ural owl is considerably larger in size and talon size (which is about 30% greater in the Ural), with the talon shape further indicating their different ecological roles, being proportionately shorter and more curved in tawny owls in accordance with its more varied diet and heavier and straighter in the Ural owl for dispatching relatively larger mammals. It is known that when ranges overlap between tawny and Ural owls, the Ural owl tends to dominate and sometimes kill the tawny owl. In Slovenia, Ural owls actually responded more consistently to recorded calls of tawny owls (40% of call exposures causing a vocal or physical response) than to recordings of calls of their own species (34% of call exposures eliciting a response). However, cases of interspecific killing between the species are fairly infrequent, and recent study indicates that the tawny owl&#x27;s relatively checkered distribution in northerly areas such as Fennoscandia is not likely due to this competition but rather due to the regional habitat type favoring the Ural owl. The tawny owl is not as well suited to taiga habitats as is the Ural species and locally are less suited to alternate nest sites (i.e. nesting in areas lacking tree cavities or nest boxes, whereas the Ural can locally also use old bird nests and tree stumps). Warming average temperatures in Fennoscandia have appeared to effect many owl species negatively due to the limiting nature on vole cycles, but the tawny owl, being confined to the south, has had the most decreased effect locally due to the lowering vole numbers (and despite their general ability to adapt to different prey) while the Ural owl, in central Finland at least, is not yet showing as drastic a negative effect due to this. Similarly, the tawny owl and Ural owl are largely segregated by altitudinal range and habitat in eastern Europe (i.e. the Carpathian Mountains) and Poland, with little evidence that this is due to interspecific competition or predation but rather the suitably of the montane habitats. Here the tawny owl tends to occur at lower elevations while the Ural owl occupies the foothill forests at higher elevations. Generally, despite higher densities of the Ural in some mountainous parts of central and eastern Europe, the tawny owl is far more numerous in all countries of that region than the Ural owl. In Slovakia, 13.3% of Ural owl territories overlapped with those of tawny owls, a relatively low overlap given the overall environment. Despite the Ural owl&#x27;s presumed dominance, in Slovenia, a tawny owl was observed to fiercely attack a Ural owl until it left the vicinity, though it is not clear whether this was a territorial encounter or antipredator mobbing. In Poland, during post-dispersal in winter tawny owls were able to temporarily utilize parts of Ural owl territories, taking advantage of the Ural owls less aggressive behaviour outside of the breeding season.

Ural owls do not generally occur with other &quot;Strix&quot; owls excepting the tawny owl but overlap in much of their range also with the great grey owl, which furthermore ranges farther north and into the Americas as well. Despite its large size, the great grey owl is a dietary specialist on voles, relying almost exclusively on them. Its dietary restrictions are indicated by its foot morphology, with the great grey owl possessing talons that are conspicuously finer, smaller and less powerful looking than those of the Ural owl despite the slightly larger overall foot size (in correspondence with its body mass) of the great grey. Within the taiga that both the great grey and Ural owls prefer, great grey owls have been shown to nest in a wide diversity of locations, with more nest types overall than the Ural, but it does not normally use tree cavities as do the other two European &quot;Strix&quot; owls and seldom occurs in areas where conifers are not dominant anywhere in its range, such as riparian zones where forest can diversify to become mixed with deciduous trees. The difference in nest site usage and narrower dietary habits of the great grey are thought to mitigate most serious competition between the great grey and Ural owls. A larger owl than either species, however, is the Eurasian eagle-owl. The Ural owl is considerably smaller-bodied (around three times lighter), with a wingspan around 35% smaller and smaller talons and feet, so a competitive advantage is apparent even between the species&#x27; morphology. The eagle-owl also takes a large number of small prey such as voles but is conspicuously more variable in alternate foods. Across a similar but generally much broader distribution (both in latitude and longitude), eagle-owls take about three times as many prey species as do Ural owls, including much more species from all prey taxon, and also occur in a broader range of habitat types. Being much larger and (based on morphology) presumably much more powerful, the eagle-owl is able to take much larger prey than the Ural owl. More locally, in Finland, the Ural owl took proportionately more European water voles, overall birds and amphibians than did the eagle-owls but took far fewer gamebirds. The eagle-owls are likely avoided when possible by the Ural. Upon evidence, Ural owls are fairly regular in occurrence in North Ostrobothnia, where eagle-owls are rare to absent, but in South Ostrobothnia the Urals are scarce, possibly because the eagle-owls are relatively common. However, habitat differences may segregate the two species as well. In Finland, the eagle-owl appears to prefer pine-dominated forest while the Ural prefers spruce-dominated forests. Elsewhere, eagle-owls may frequent rocky areas where available (for nesting) and often hunt in more diverse and often more open areas, and in such areas Ural owls are rare to absent. Being smaller than the great grey owl and Eurasian eagle-owl, it is projected that the Ural owl can live off of less food overall than them. It is estimated that over a 6-month period, a Ural owl needs about of food while a great grey owl needs about and an eagle-owl needs about . The Ural owl has the potential to encounter other larger owls such as the snowy owl (&quot;Bubo scandiacus&quot;) in winter and the Blakiston&#x27;s fish owl (&quot;Bubo blakistoni&quot;) in the far east of the range, but are unlikely to interact extensively given the differences in habitat usage.

Apart from the aforementioned species, most other owl species that the Ural owl encounters in its range are significantly smaller. Furthermore, the Ural owl tends to dominate these species when encounters occur and so may be avoided. One species that often shares similar habitat and prey preferences with the Ural owl is the boreal owl. However, based on territory spacing, the boreal owls can appear to more strictly avoid the tawny owl, which is known to be highly aggressive in its territorial behaviour year-around while studies have indicated territorial exclusion by Ural owls is largely confined to the breeding season. It was hypothesized, however, in forested southern Poland that boreal owls selected nest sites not out of avoidance of tawny owls but based on the availability of suitable nesting sites. In the south Poland study, tawny owls usually occurred more so in fir-spruce woodland. In Slovenia, it was theorized that boreal owls incidentally benefited from the exclusion of tawny owls by dominant Ural owls when the three species occurred in adjacent habitats. However, evidence indicates that the boreal owls faces higher mortality when they nest too close to Ural owls, i.e. within about . A similar relationship has been detected between the Ural owl and the Eurasian pygmy owl (&quot;Glaucidium passerinum&quot;), a species less than half the size of a boreal owl. However, the pygmy owl usually selected different forest types than Ural owls in areas of sympatry, in particular fir woodland, wherein the Ural tends to be rare or absent. However, ecological interactions were detected in Slovenia, as the pygmy owl was observed to display antipredator behaviour against Ural owls. Despite the different preferred forest habitat, 46.3% of ranges of Ural and Eurasian pygmy owls overlapped in Slovakia. Quite little is known about the ecological interactions between the Ural owl and the northern hawk owl (&quot;Surnia ulula&quot;), another boreal owl, despite a shared propensity for utilizing snags as nest sites. Hawk owls are also routine vole predators but share more ecological characteristics with the great grey owl than the Ural owls, in particular their nomadic behaviours and irruptive movements. Furthermore, hawk-owl&#x27;s stronger tendency for diurnality may further provide a degree of partitioning.

The best known aspect of interspecific interactions with other owls and assorted other predators is interspecific predations. The Ural owl is at times vulnerable to predation by larger predators when encounters occur. Undoubtedly, the most dangerous predator is likely the Eurasian eagle-owl. Other predators known to prey upon Ural owls have included golden eagles (&quot;Aquila chrysaetos&quot;), eastern imperial eagle (&quot;Aquila heliaca&quot;), mountain hawk-eagle (&quot;Nisaetus nipalensis&quot;) and Eurasian lynx (&quot;Lynx lynx&quot;) as well as diurnal raptors that are only slightly larger, including the northern goshawk and lesser spotted eagle (&quot;Clanga pomarina&quot;). In most cases mentioned above, the age of the Ural owl taken by the predators are not usually specified (although any of the first three large eagles are certainly capable of striking down Ural owls potentially of any age). In some cases, goshawks have been known to kill parent Ural owls apparently entirely out of competition (despite different main food sources) and lay their eggs on a nest still containing the owls&#x27; eggs. Predators specifically noted to have taken young Ural owls, usually of around fledgling age or shortly post-dispersal (especially those used in reintroductions) have additionally included red foxes (&quot;Vulpes vulpes&quot;), European pine martens (&quot;Martes martes&quot;) and great grey owls. In Primorsky Krai, Asian badgers (&quot;Meles leucurus&quot;) and raccoon dogs (&quot;Nyctereutes procyonoides&quot;) are mentioned as potential or likely predators of Ural owls nests as well. In one recorded instance, a Ural owl that was observed seemingly trying to prey upon a non-native American mink (&quot;Neogale vison&quot;) was seen to lose the confrontation when the mink turned the tables, having apparently overpowered, killed and ate the owl. Although predation events upon Ural owls are widely reported, the relative number of incidents of such are very low and singular. South of the Arctic, it can be considered to rival the great grey owl as the owl species that is second least vulnerable to predation, behind the apex predator eagle-owls. The Ural owl is itself a fairly formidable predator of smaller owl species, although not as prolific a killer as are eagle-owls and northern goshawks. Among the owls Ural owls have been known to have preyed upon are Indian scops owl (&quot;Otus lettia&quot;), collared scops owl (&quot;Otus bakkamoena&quot;), northern hawk-owls, tawny owls, Eurasian pygmy owls, boreal owls and long-eared owls. Diurnal raptors are also sometimes vulnerable to predation by Ural owls, including grey-faced buzzards (&quot;Butastur indicus&quot;), Eurasian sparrowhawk (&quot;Accipiter nisus&quot;), common kestrel (&quot;Falco tinniculus&quot;) and even apparent adult northern goshawks. Thus the Ural owl, coupled with a very low known rate of natural predations, appears to occupy a similar position in the intraguild predatory hierarchy as the goshawk. In Finland, both smaller owls and diurnal raptors such as sparrowhawks and even buzzards appear to avoid nesting near Ural owls. In addition, Ural owls are known to have successfully have chased off actively nesting goshawks as well as European honey buzzards (&quot;Pernis apivorus&quot;), common buzzards (&quot;Buteo buteo&quot;) and black kites (&quot;Milvus migrans&quot;) in order to claim the nests for themselves. Despite their potential predation on smaller mesopredators, when nest boxes for European pied flycatchers (&quot;Ficedula hypoleuca&quot;) were experimentally placed in the area of Ural owl nests, productivity lowered, and it is possibly because mesopredators were often attracted to the corresponding food base of the owls. On the contrary, experimental ground nests put out by researchers with random poultry eggs in central Finland were shown to be incidentally protected by the fierce presence of Ural Owls. In the Finnish ground placed almost directly under the Ural nest none at all were preyed upon, while in those placed away, 8.3% were predated, and those within experienced an average predation rate of 58.3%. At a great distance, at all ground nests were predated.

==Breeding==
===Pair occupancy===
The Ural owl generally pairs for life and maintains a territory for several years. Mate retention in Fennoscandia was found to have averaged 98–100% in males and 90-95% in females, making it amongst the most monogamous birds of prey of any order (or at least well-studied bird of prey species). Territories of Ural owls are on average about 3 times larger than those of tawny owls. In Sweden, about 3000 pairs of Urals are found in an area. In Finland, nests are usually somewhere between apart in wildland areas. Per Finnish data, the Ural owl had the second most nest found for an owl species from 1985 to 1989, with 901 nests second to the boreal owl with 2265 nests. In Croatia, different areas had anywhere from 1.1 to 5.4 pairs on average per with an estimated 700-1000 breeding pairs left in the estimated 37% of Croatia that is still forested. The peak Croatian population was recorded in Plitvice Lakes National Park, predominately in mixed fir-beech montane forest, which held about 38 breeding pairs. Breeding in Slovenia is at a mean elevation of , with altitude less important than habitat. Many forest types were used in Slovenia but fir-beech mixed forest were seen to be most often utilized. The highest Slovenian densities were around 2-3 pairs per for Mount Krim and around 4-5 pairs per for Snežnik. In 2016, it was estimated that Slovenia holds 400-700 pairs. Survey of the species in Silesian Beskids was done, where the population may represent a recent population expansion. With as many as three breeding attempts, Density was estimated at 0.6-0.9 pairs per , 3-10 times lower than other nearby ranges in eastern Europe like the Low Beskids and Bieszczady Mountains. A low density population was found for Pieniny National Park, Poland with 0.9-1.3 per . The average density in the Polish Kraków-Częstochowa Upland was 1 pair per . In the northern part of Moravia, Czech Republic, 3-5 pairs were recorded around the turn of the 21st century, an almost certain population increase. A population increase noted in the Roztocze area of Ukraine, despite the forest being mixed rather than the subspecies&#x27; preferred beech dominant, now up to 1.7 pairs per . Where nest boxes were put up for Ural owls in Samara Oblast showed the owls taking up residence in boxes at an average distance of ; against which the average distance of all installed boxes was .

===Nest characteristics===
Potential nesting sites include large natural holes in trees, cavities left by large branch that have broken off, hollow trunks where canopies have been broken off (or &quot;chimney stacks&quot;), fissures or holes in cliffs or between rocks and holes in buildings. Tree crags and stumps used preferentially in central and eastern Europe are quite often common birch (&quot;Fagus sylvatica&quot;) or occasionally common oak (&quot;Quercus robur&quot;). Also Ural owls may regularly use stick nests of larger birds such as various accipitrids, in particular those built by goshawks and buzzards, as well as black stork (&quot;Ciconia nigra&quot;) nests, common raven (&quot;Corvus corax&quot;) nests and squirrel dreys, though dreys and nests of smaller birds such as sparrowhawks and crows may present risk of regularly collapsing as they may be overly small and perhaps flimsily built. A highly unusual nest site in terms of regional habitat was recorded in Slovakia, in the Východoslovenská Plains, a lowland floodplain, within an old buzzard nest. Nest can be in the vicinity of small towns, as was recorded in southern Sakhalin, so long as appropriate habitat and prey access is available in the region. In one case in Norway, a Ural owl utilized a hole in a common aspen (&quot;Populus tremula&quot;) in the same tree where common mergansers (&quot;Mergus merganser&quot;) were using a different hole. In several parts of their range they may make use of nest boxes, with the trend of nest box placement beginning and being perhaps most persistently used in Fennoscandia. Large nest boxes with an opening of about in diameter are preferred by the species. Elsewhere, about 29% of nest boxes set out in Slovenia are known to have been used. In Russia&#x27;s Altai Krai, Biya River area between 2010 and 2012, 15.2-48.9% of nest boxes that were erected were used with annual variation explainable by cycles of primary food sources. In Samara Oblast of 74 nest boxes set in 4 study plots by 2009, 41.9% were used by Ural owls (with about 14.9% used by various other animals). In Samara, about 20.6% of Ural owls pairs in the study block still used natural nest sites despite the availability of nest boxes. Nearby to the prior site, in the woodlands outside of Biysk of the Altai Krai, 8 territories were detected with all 6 nest found in nests built by accipitrids. Use of 15 total nest boxes in Akademgorodok, Russia over three study years varied wildly based presumably on prey population cycles with anywhere from 0% to 50% used annually. Incidental benefit has been shown for several beetle species and sometimes other insects that have come nest in the substrate of Ural owl nest boxes, even in areas where the invertebrates are rare or endangered.

Of 250 nests recorded over nearly a century in Finland, stumps accounted for most (34.3%), followed by bird nests (28.5%), nest boxes (23.1%), tree holes (11.35%) and lower numbers on ground or on rock face or building. 53% of Finnish stumps were in spruce and 38% in aspens, from high with an average of . Stumps were preferred in the northern and central part of Finland. 67% of Finnish cavity nests were broken off branches of birches, though black woodpecker (&quot;Dryocopus martius&quot;) holes that had rotted and expanded were also sometimes used, with the cavity nests height from . Cavities were preferred in the southern part of Finland. Nest boxes increased in importance after 1960 and, by 1969, 50% of recorded nest usage in all Finland was in nest boxes. In Slovenia, 56.2% of recorded nests were in tree holes, with about a further 20% on stumps, at over the ground (on an average ). Less often Slovenian owls nests in old bird of prey nests (16-19%). In Slovakia, beech dominated forest were selected about 74% of the time. Among 27 Slovakian nests, 59.3% were in common beeches, 14.8% in fir, 11.1% in spruce and 14.8% in other deciduous trees. Nests on stumps were recorded twice in Hokkaido but otherwise Japanese Ural owls appear to rarely use such nest sites, favoring variously tree cavities, birds&#x27; nests and nest boxes with little evidence of a strong preference of any one type of nest site. Even in peak vole years some parts may be unable to breed due to lack of acceptable nest sites. Besides the unquantifiable threat of global warming, loss of old forest with dead trees with ample cavities is the species&#x27; main threat. This is especially prevalent during forest management historically and the practices of forestry departments have often favored tawny owls and been detrimental to populations of Ural owls. However, in Hedmark, Norway, the placing of 80 nest boxes did not increase the country&#x27;s Ural owl population, with only 4 of the boxes used. The lack of success for Norwegian populations is thus not seemingly due to a lack of nesting sites but is theorized to be more so correlated with a poor prey population for them. Prior studies, in central and eastern Norway, somewhat more westerly into Norway than previously thought but not an extensive range, with the clutch size being smaller, at a mean of 2.85, within Scandinavia compared to 2.93 in Sweden, 3 in southern Finland and 3.92 in northern Finland.

===Eggs and young===

The clutch size is typically 3-4 (rarely from as few as 1 to as many as 6), with the eggs being pure white and quite rounded. The mean egg laying dates in Fennoscandia are between mid-March and late April. In montane Slovenia, somewhat surprisingly, it is slightly later at late March into early June. Mean clutch size was found to be 2.93 in Sweden. Mean clutch size in Finland was 2.24 but could range from 2.08 to 3.98 on average in poor and good years for vole prey. Mean clutch size in Slovenia is about 3.3. Another Slovenian study showed a fairly lower mean clutch size of 2.4 with evidence that clutch was reduced by low food access in the early part of the breeding season. Clutch size in a small sample from Nizhny Novgorod Russia was found to average 3.6. The clutch size average in nest boxes of Samara Oblast was 2.4. Egg sizes are usually between in height by in diameter, and the eggs weighing on average about when fresh. Based on studies in southern Finland, amongst 59 studied females, egg size varies by 22.4% through the cycle years and the largest eggs are roughly twice the mass of the smallest, a very considerable variation. The eggs are laid directly to bottom of nesting surface in roughly 2 day intervals. Females alone incubate usually beginning with the first egg, and is fed by her mate throughout. In 108 female Ural owls from Finland the start of incubation varied individually, with synchronous hatching shown to be disadvantageous to overall productivity. Evidence was found that females repeated their incubation start time annually was moderately strong (26% repeatability) so it may be an evolved trait. Incubation lasts for 28 to 35 days and averages about 6 days longer than the incubation period of the tawny owl. The hatchlings break at concurrent time lapses as the eggs are laid (about 2 days), the females staying by until fledging. The downy chick is white; at the stage when they typically leave the nest (or mesoptile stage) the downy is pale dirty whitish and barred with greyish-brown on head, nape, mantle and underparts. Nestlings leave the nest at about 35 days old and can fly at 45 days. They are fed and cared for over an additional 2 months or so after leaving the nests. 
===Parental behaviours and characteristics===
The young Ural owls officially reach sexual maturity in the year after independence. However, in southern Finland, it was found that first time nesting females generally would not attempt to nest if it was a poor vole year and the largest percentage (about 40%) first started breeding attempts in intermediate years (between poor and good vole years), which often did not occur until they were 3 to 4 years old. The same typical age (3–4 years) was detected in central Sweden, despite the females often being on territory within their first year. Upon study of feather molt and wear, it was supported that some female Ural owls breed in their 2nd or 3rd year, but most do not breed until their 4th or 5th year. On the contrary, a Finnish study found that for Ural owls of both sexes, it was estimated that the mean starting age for breeding is 2.9 years, with an average breeding life expectancy of 3.3 years. Furthermore, females that started breeding at 2 or 3 were shown in Finland to have higher reproductive “fitness” than females who started breeding at 4 or older. Females laid eggs in Finland an average of 2.7 times in their life and produced an average of 6.7 fledglings over their reproductive lifetime (with the most productive females producing up to 33 fledglings). Brooding activity peaks, with typically 9-14 daily visits, in Finnish studies in the late evening during spring and summer while tending to young, with a weaker peak activity time in the early morning, both timed to peak prey activity times. It is well known that mother Ural owls defends her brood in a fearsome display. In Finland, the repeatability of the nesting defense behaviour by females was ranked as 52.4%, starting with a bark and taking flight, then fly-bys towards the perceived threat and culminating in attacks and powerful strikes. Per this study, those females that laid their eggs earlier on average defended their nest more vigorously than those who laid their clutches later. The force and ferocity of the attack led to its common name in Swedish (&quot;Slaguggla&quot; or “attacking owl”), and their attacks can potentially cause grievous physical harm even to an animal as large as a human. In at least some cases, humans experience the loss of one eye or have been blinded, with broken eye sockets or eyeballs extracted by Ural owl attacks. Due to her attacks, the predation rate on Ural owl is often exceptionally low. Partial feather molting by females was thought to not have great bearing on her brooding abilities, since it was largely timed to periods where the female (and her brood of offspring) are being almost entirely fed by the male of the pair.

===Breeding success===
Broods with more than three chicks sometimes experience siblicide per study in southern Finland, but instances of siblicide are rare otherwise. Larger clutches seem to be an insurance behaviour since authors showed that broods of 4 or so were more likely to have younger sibling die sooner or later before independence. Productivity is largely associated with prey access, with the effect most studied in Fennoscandia because of the dramatic 3 year fluctuation of vole prey appears to cause great variations in productivity. Natality rates could vary from zero to 2.9 across the years based on prey numbers in Sweden, with the average being 1.03-1.12 fledglings per pair and 2.68 fledglings per successful pair. However, it was estimated in Sweden that on average 62% of owls do not survive their first year, in comparison to adult female annual mortality which was estimated at 10.5%. Similarly, in southern Finland, from 29 to 58 breeding pairs bred annually in the same study area and could produce anywhere from 1.17 to 3.21 fledglings depending on prey cycles (3.5 average fledglings per successful attempts in high vole years against 1.79 per successful nest in low vole year). Finnish study showed that 21.7% of all clutches failed to hatch and 4.3% died completely after hatching. Hatchability in south Finland averages 87% across all years. On a broader scale, from 422 to 1710 territories were recorded in Finland from 2009 to 2011 with the number of successful nests ranging annually from 168 to 1341. The population trends were more or less mirrored by those of the Finnish tawny owls but tawny brood size averages 0.68 larger than that of the Ural. Prospects for breeding are generally low during the low point of the three-year cycle of the vole prey of Urals in south Finland but paradoxically when a high vole year is followed by a low one, the number of attempted clutches is higher but the rate of nest failure is higher. For instance, within a Finnish study, 144 eggs were found in 63 nests during a low vole phase, in the increase phase 1212 from 338 nests and in peak phase 1259 eggs from 345 nests. However, this study showed low recruitment from clutches was detected in both increase and peak years, and the complications and individual variations of each pair may cause variations that the previous theories do not account for. Breeding success in southern Finland was also driven by the mother Ural owl&#x27;s age, with 3-5-year-old females being less productive than those that were 6 to 9 years old, and that older females, of more than 10 years old, tended to lay larger and more rounded eggs. In Finland, supplemental fed pairs nest up to 1 week earlier and produce up to 0.6 more eggs than those that were not, therefore food limitation does appear to effect productivity of the species. Males were mildly more numerous in Finland among fledged young (56%) but survivorship of the two sexes were essentially equal and body mass in both sexes averaged about 6% more in good vole years. Studies of 274 Finnish adult females found that 18% of them produced about half of the fledglings. Breeding attempts in Nizhny Novgorod Russia produced an average number 3.1 young to leave the nest.

Despite being farther south than many aforementioned studies (i.e. from Fennoscandia), in Estonia a highly variable breeding success rate was observed to be concurrently happening during prey population cycles. In Slovenia, about 80% of breeding attempts manage to produce at least one fledgling. Another Slovenian study showed a nearly 5% higher breeding success overall due to late summer peaks of edible dormouse (July or later). 7 nests in Podkarpackie Voivodeship, Poland were shown to able to produce an average 2.8 fledglings in a good year but no nest could be found in a poor rodent year. Findings showed that parent Ural owls, particularly the adult female, are able to adjust their breeding cycle to maximize survivorship of their young well given the experience accrued during their relatively long lifespan, and are relatively successful at mitigating issues such as parasitism and infestations in nest boxes if they are being used. Post-dispersal young from Vienna Woods in Austria were radio-tracked and showed a mean dispersal distance of from release site and were shown to experience about a 23% mortality rate.

==Status==
The Ural owl is not a densely populated bird but can be locally not uncommon. The IUCN estimates that there are between 350,000 and 1,200,000 individuals living in the wild globally. Most decreases in recent history have been reported from areas where hollow and broken trees were removed from forests. In Estonia, managed forest almost invariably have fewer Ural owls than undisturbed forest has because of reduction of snags and other natural cavities to use. However, the general trends are positive for most European Ural owl populations. The erection of nest boxes has caused population increases in several parts of the range, especially Finland. In eastern Europe, it is one of the more stable owl species, though it is far less numerous overall than some (i.e. tawny, long-eared, and little owls (&quot;Athene noctua&quot;)). Several population increase and expansions have been detected in central and eastern Europe for Ural owls in recent history, in sync with other owls considered boreal species (i.e. great grey, boreal, Eurasian pygmy). Previous records indicated staple populations in the 1980s for Ural owls in the western Carpathian Mountains (estimated at 1000 pairs) and northern Belarus (at 50-100 pairs). By the 1990s, the number had grown to 1000-1500 pairs in the western Carpathians and to 220-1350 pairs in northern Belarus. By 2005, the numbers were up to 3500 pairs in Carpathians and a drastic increase to 2700-4300 pairs in Belarus. In the Czech Republic, partially due to deliberate reintroductions, the numbers went from 1-5 pairs in 1985–89 to 25-40 pairs by 2001–2003. In selected plots of southeastern Poland, Belarus and Latvia, densities went from 1-2 pairs per to 10 pairs per . In these three countries, northern population now much higher density than southern ones, i.e. 5–8.1 pairs per in north to 3.1-3.6 pairs per in the south. A range expansion of Ural owls was detected in western Ukraine (in the general region of Roztochya Biosphere Reserve and Yavorivskyi National Park). in 2005–07 up to 1.7-2 pair per whereas in the past (i.e. to the 1990s) the species was a rare vagrant to this area. This density of this Ukrainian population is higher than seemingly most in Scandinavia and Belarus but lower than in southwestern Poland and Slovenia; while whether this represents a population increase or merely a population shift is unknown nor its relation to forestry. In some parts of Slovakia, such as Slanské vrchy, Vihorlat and the Ondavská Highlands the density of pairs may be up to a pair per square kilometer, perhaps the highest known specieswide. 400-500 Slovenian pairs from 1973 to 1994 is as of 2006 is estimated at 1400-2500 pairs. In the Orava region of Slovakia, the population may have increased fivefold during the above stated years. While many owl species (eagle-owl, long-eared, boreal) have appeared to have generally declined in period of 1982–2007 in Finland, to the contrary Ural owls increased by about 1% (excluded from these estimates were too difficult to analyze northerly nomadic owl species). In every regard but number of nestlings that were ringed (in which it also trails the Eurasian pygmy), it has been observed the Ural is the 2nd commonest detected breeding owl after the boreal owl in Finland with 2545 territories found, 1786 nests observed and 4722 nestlings ringed. An increase of the population was found in the Moscow region where tall stands remained despite the rather developed environment nearby. 

Occasionally, Ural owls are vulnerable to flying into manmade objects. In most parts of the range, they are less vulnerable than many other large birds of prey (in part because of their preference for remote forests) but certainly a few are likely to be claimed as such. Many such mortalities are due to wire collisions and electrocutions, which are likely increase especially as populations expand and move into areas closer to human habitations. Other collision kills, such as with glass buildings and, widely, with various automobiles, may too potentially be on the increase. Though historically subject to some degree of persecution, Ural owls were spared from the worst of it perhaps by nesting in remote forests and possibly by being generally less predatory to small domestic fowl, game animals and the like than large raptorial birds like Eurasian eagle-owls, golden eagles and northern goshawks, all of which were badly persecuted and thusly reduced. Like other wild birds, Ural owls may be vulnerable to some degree of mortality due to diseases and infections but these are unlikely to compromise overall populations. A case of the bacterial infectious disease &quot;Tularemia&quot; was observed in a ural owl as was Usutu virus in a single bird. 71.4% of 14 wild Ural owls in Japan had blood parasites while a smaller but still present number of &quot;Acanthocephala&quot; and roundworms were detected in known European data. Many Japanese Ural owls were also found to be vulnerable to biting lice.

===Reintroduction===
Species reintroductions have been undertaken in some different parts of Europe. By far the best documented Ural owl reintroduction was in the Bohemian forest, which ranges between the countries and regions of Bavaria in Germany, the Czech Republic and upper Austria. Previously the species was extinct here by 1926 (by 1910 on the Austrian side). Established of captive breeding stock occurred between 1972 and 2005 (with origins from 7 different countries and a mixture of the two main European subspecies). For this breeding program, 212 young Ural owls were originally released. During the study, experimental introductions were made to tawny owl nests, although this potentially exposed them to risk of hybridization. Otherwise, parentage consisted of relatively newly established Ural owls. Both tawny and Ural owls were shown to be able to successfully raise the young Ural broods. Food was also offered to pairs at nearby release pens and 60 nest boxes erected to compensate for lack of nest sites, especially in areas of secondary forest. 33 Ural owls were recovered dead, while an additional 4 were weakened or injured to the state of being unable to continue to live in the wild. Most of the mortality was due to electrocution or were hit by cars but a few were illegally shot. The first wild breeding of a Ural pair in the Bohemian forest occurred in 1985 but the first successful breeding was not until 1989 (with the pair having producing 4 offspring). Between 1981 and 2005 a total of 49 broods were recorded, 31 of which were successful with 59 young produced (avg 1.3 per all attempts, 1.9 per successful pair). No fewer than 6 pairs (possibly 5-10 breeding pairs) were established by the end of study, with the carrying capacity within the forest estimated at 10 pairs. For a self-sustaining breeding population, it was felt that at least 30 pairs are necessary in the general area within connected corridors to the Bohemian forest. Therefore, 87 birds were introduced into nearby Sumava National Park between 1995 and 2006, an estimated 2-3 breeding pairs have established there now. A still uncertain pilot program in Mühlviertel, Austria may or may not have produced a pair as well. In 2001, among two reintroduction attempts in Austria, both failed. All told from the entire Bavarian reintroduction, it was said that the owls producing a total of 204 offspring between 1972 and 2014, although many of these may not have survived. More successful than the Austrian part of the Bavarian forest reintroductions was the reintroduction elsewhere in Austria, namely the Vienna Woods. In this project, 67 young owls were released between 2009 and 2013. A nesting box network of 127 boxes were set out to be utilized and one of Europe&#x27;s largest stands of beech trees was present. In the Vienna Woods, the survival rate was high at about 70.5%. By 2011–2012, 10 pairs attempted to nest, establishing home ranges averaging about and produced 3.1 fledglings per successful pair.

<text>Arthur Friedenreich (18 July 1892 – 6 September 1969) was a Brazilian professional footballer who played as a forward. He was nicknamed &quot;The Tiger&quot; or &quot;The Original &quot;Black&quot; Pearl&quot;, and was arguably the sport&#x27;s first outstanding mixed-race player. He played for the Brazil national team and was a record nine times top scorer of the state championship of São Paulo. He is occasionally cited as one of the all-time top scorers in football history, although this is highly disputed.

==Biography==

===Personal life===

Friedenreich was born in São Paulo to Oscar Friedenreich, a German businessman whose father immigrated to Brazil, and Mathilde, a Black Brazilian washerwoman and the daughter of freed slaves. Friedenreich was the first professional football player of Afro-Brazilian origin, because at that time football was dominated by Whites, and Blacks were not accepted. He faced many barriers because of racism, and could not attend the same places where white players were, such as swimming pools, tennis courts and parties. Also Friedenreich found it hard to make connections and friends in the world of Brazilian football due to the color of his skin.

Friedenreich played football from his early childhood onwards. His father was very supportive of his skills and really helped him on his path to the great player he became. At some point in his life he married his wife Jonas and together they had a son who they named after Friedenreich&#x27;s father, Oscar. Both outlived Friedenreich and were left with no money.

=== Style of play ===
Friedenreich was often said to be the pioneer of &#x27;jogo bonito&#x27; or &#x27;the beautiful game&#x27;, a style frequently associated with Brazilian football. The style involved playing very quickly with short passes as well as quick touches and combinations. It also relied on taking many long shots and attacking with 2-3 pacy strikers to disorient the defence. Despite being a shorter player (5 ft 7 in) he was known for his pace, power, and brilliant technical dribbling.

===Early playing career===

He started his career influenced by his father, playing for SC Germânia, a Brazilian football team composed of German immigrants. After playing with a succession of São Paulo club sides from 1910 onwards, Friedenreich made his debut with the national team in 1914 which was the first ever game Brazil played beating Exeter City 2–0. In the game, Friedenreich famously lost two of his front teeth due to a heavy slide tackle. He played twenty-two internationals, including wins in the 1919 and 1922 editions of the South American Championship, scoring ten goals. During the 1919 edition he became the first ever football player to score a hat-trick in a major international tournament. On Brazil&#x27;s 1925 tour of Europe, he was feted as the &quot;King of Football&quot;. He was also the top scorer in the São Paulo League in 1912, 1914, 1917, 1918, 1919, 1921, 1927 and 1929.

Friedenreich was very young when he developed his own style of play and was 17 when he first became a part of an elite club. After that, Friedenreich bounced around from club to club until he found a long lasting home with CA Paulistano, a top Brazilian club. Friedenreich played for the club CA Paulistano for 12 years before the club disbanded. He then joined the club São Paulo da Floresta.

===Later playing career===
He wasn&#x27;t picked by Brazil for the 1930 FIFA World Cup because there was a serious misunderstanding between the football Leagues of the States of Rio de Janeiro and São Paulo; only players from Rio travelled. São Paulo stars, like him (who was 38 years old), Filó (who was 1934 FIFA World Cup champion with Italy) and Feitiço, did not go to Uruguay. He continued to grow older and play for less and less elite clubs. After 1934 he only played locally and competed in those clubs. The last team he played for before his retirement very late in his career in the year 1935, was the Flamengo team from Rio de Janeiro.

==After football==
In the 1930s, Brazilian football was beginning the process of professionalization, and in 1933 it became reality. Friedenreich was against the professionalization of football in the country. Outraged, he refused to continue playing football, and retired playing for Flamengo at 43 years old. His last match was against Fluminense on 21 July 1935 (the game ended in a 2–2 draw; he didn&#x27;t score that day). He then started working in a liquor company and retired while there. When he retired Arthur got Alzheimer&#x27;s disease and the treatment took most of his money while trying to treat this disorder. Arthur would end up losing most if not all of his money to this disease. He lived in a house ceded by São Paulo football club until he died on 6 September 1969 at 77 years old.

===Posthumous tributes===
There is a park in the Vila Alpina neighborhood, on the east side of São Paulo, with his name. The park, located at the beginning of Francisco Falconi avenue, is one of the biggest of the region. Still on the east side of São Paulo, there is a street with his name. In Rio de Janeiro, there is a school with his name, located within the sports complex of Maracanã, near the main entrance, on the left of Bellini statue.

== Discrimination and race in Brazilian football ==
Friedenreich was born of Afro-Brazilian origin making him a person of mixed race. Brazil was one of the last countries to outlaw slavery in 1888. This was only four years before Friedenreich was born. Due to this Friedenreich felt the pressure of discrimination throughout his life and career. For instance, being denied playing in the 1921 South American championship in Argentina. While Friedenreich never took on the role of a spokesman against discrimination, he did break many barriers by playing football in general. He also did not embrace his culture to an extreme, even using tactics to appear more white. He did this by dressing, acting, and behaving like many other white players. Many black players in Brazil would put flour or rice powder on their faces to appear whiter. In many instances Friedenreich would spend much time straightening his hair before games to look &quot;white&quot;.

==Controversy in the number of goals==
The exact number of goals that Friedenreich scored is unknown, due to lack of documentation. There is not a proper number that could be the number of goals he scored, only a few supposed numbers that have come up over the years. The most famous supposed number of goals is 1,329, that Friedenreich would have scored in 1,239 matches. Friedenreich&#x27;s father and his former teammate Mario de Andrade had both compiled his goalscoring record, but it mysteriously vanished in the mid-1960s, during a time when Friedenreich himself had Alzheimer&#x27;s disease.

===Some supposed numbers===
 Between 1909 and 1935
* 554 goals in 561 matches - Alexandre da Costa, in the book &quot;O Tigre do futebol&quot;
* 558 goals in 562 matches - Orlando Duarte e Severino Filho, in the book &quot;Fried versus Pelé&quot;
* 354 goals in 323 matches - IFFHS
* 105 goals in 125 matches - Memorial of São Paulo FC

<doc id="815915" wikidata="Q780518" url="?curid=815915" title="Spanish phonology">
<text>This article is about the phonology and phonetics of the Spanish language. Unless otherwise noted, statements refer to Castilian Spanish, the standard dialect used in Spain on radio and television. For historical development of the sound system, see History of Spanish. For details of geographical variation, see Spanish dialects and varieties.

Phonemic representations are written inside slashes (), while phonetic representations are written in brackets ().

==Consonants==

The phonemes , , and are pronounced as voiced stops only after a pause, after a nasal consonant, or—in the case of —after a lateral consonant; in all other contexts, they are realized as approximants (namely , hereafter represented without the downtacks) or fricatives.

The phoneme is distinguished from only in some areas of Spain (mostly northern and rural) and South America (mostly highland). Other accents of Spanish, comprising the majority of speakers, have lost the palatal lateral as a distinct phoneme and have merged historical into : this is called &quot;yeísmo&quot;.

The realization of the phoneme varies greatly by dialect. In Castilian Spanish, its allophones in word-initial position include the palatal approximant , the palatal fricative , the palatal affricate and the palatal stop . After a pause, a nasal, or a lateral, it may be realized as an affricate (); in other contexts, /ʝ/ is generally realized as an approximant . In Rioplatense Spanish, spoken across Argentina and Uruguay, the voiced palato-alveolar fricative is used in place of and , a feature called &quot;zheísmo&quot;. In the last few decades, it has further become popular, particularly among younger speakers in Argentina and Uruguay, to de-voice to (&quot;sheísmo&quot;). 

The phone occurs as a deaffricated pronunciation of in some other dialects (most notably, Northern Mexican Spanish, informal Chilean Spanish, and some Caribbean and Andalusian accents). Otherwise, is a marginal phoneme that occurs only in loanwords or certain dialects; many speakers have difficulty with this sound, tending to replace it with or .

Many young Argentinians have no distinct phoneme and use the sequence instead, thus making no distinction between and (both ).

Most varieties spoken in Spain, including those prevalent on radio and television, have a phonemic contrast between and . Speakers with this contrast (which is called &quot;distinción&quot;) use in words spelled with , such as &#x27;house&#x27; , and in words spelled with or (when it occurs before or ), such as &#x27;hunt&#x27; . However, speakers in parts of southern Spain, the Canary Islands, and all of Latin America lack this distinction, merging both consonants as . The use of in place of is called &quot;seseo&quot;. Some speakers in southernmost Spain (especially coastal Andalusia) merge both consonants as : this is called &quot;ceceo&quot;, since sounds similar to . This &quot;ceceo&quot; is not entirely unknown in the Americas, especially in coastal Peru.

The exact pronunciation of varies widely by dialect: it may be pronounced as [h] or omitted entirely ([∅]), especially at the end of a syllable.

The phonemes and are laminal denti-alveolar (). The phoneme becomes dental before denti-alveolar consonants, while remains interdental in all contexts.

Before front vowels , the velar consonants (including the lenited allophone of ) are realized as post-palatal .

According to some authors, is post-velar or uvular in the Spanish of northern and central Spain. Others describe as velar in European Spanish, with a uvular allophone () appearing before and (including when is in the syllable onset as ).

A common pronunciation of in nonstandard speech is the voiceless bilabial fricative , so that is pronounced rather than . In some Extremaduran, western Andalusian, and American varieties, this softened realization of , when it occurs before the non-syllabic allophone of (), is subject to merger with ; in some areas the homophony of / is resolved by replacing with or .

===Consonant neutralizations and assimilations===
Some of the phonemic contrasts between consonants in Spanish are lost in certain phonological environments, especially at the end of a syllable. In these cases, the phonemic contrast is said to be neutralized.

====Sonorants====
=====Nasals and laterals=====

At the start of a syllable, there is a contrast between three nasal consonants: , , and (as in &quot;cama&quot; &#x27;bed&#x27;, &quot;cana&quot; &#x27;grey hair&#x27;, &quot;caña&quot; &#x27;sugar cane&#x27;), but at the end of a syllable, this contrast is generally neutralized, as nasals assimilate to the place of articulation of the following consonant—even across a word boundary.

Within a morpheme, a syllable-final nasal is obligatorily pronounced with the same place of articulation as a following stop consonant, as in &quot;banco&quot; . An exception to coda nasal place assimilation is the sequence that can be found in the middle of words such as , , .

Only one nasal consonant, , can occur at the end of words in native vocabulary. When followed by a pause, is pronounced by most speakers as alveolar (though in Caribbean varieties, it may be pronounced instead as , or omitted with nasalization of the preceding vowel). When followed by another consonant, morpheme-final shows variable place assimilation depending on speech rate and style.

Word-final and in stand-alone loanwords or proper nouns may be adapted to , e.g. &quot;álbum&quot; (&#x27;album&#x27;).

Similarly, assimilates to the place of articulation of a following coronal consonant, i.e. a consonant that is interdental, dental, alveolar, or palatal. In dialects that maintain the use of , there is no contrast between and in coda position, and syllable-final appears only as an allophone of in rapid speech.

=====Rhotics=====
The alveolar trill and the alveolar tap are in phonemic contrast word-internally between vowels (as in &quot;carro&quot; &#x27;car&#x27; vs. &quot;caro&quot; &#x27;expensive&#x27;), but are otherwise in complementary distribution, as long as syllable division is taken into account: the tap occurs after any syllable-initial consonant, while the trill occurs after any syllable-final consonant.

Only the trill can occur at the start of a word (e.g. &quot;el rey&quot; &#x27;the king&#x27;, &quot;la reina&quot; &#x27;the queen&#x27;) or in the middle of a word after , , (e.g. &quot;alrededor&quot;, &quot;enriquecer&quot;, &quot;desratizar&quot;) or more generally, after any syllable-final (coda) consonant.

Only the tap can occur after a word-initial obstruent consonant (e.g. &quot;tres&quot; &#x27;three&#x27;, &quot;frío&quot; &#x27;cold&#x27;).

Either a trill or a tap can occur word-medially after , , depending on whether the rhotic consonant is pronounced in the same syllable as the preceding obstruent (forming a complex onset cluster) or in a separate syllable (with the obstruent forming the coda of the preceding syllable). The tap is found in words where no morpheme boundary separates the obstruent from the following rhotic consonant, such as &quot;sobre&quot; &#x27;over&#x27;, &quot;madre&quot; &#x27;mother&#x27;, &quot;ministro&quot; &#x27;minister&#x27;. The trill is only found in words where the rhotic consonant is preceded by a morpheme boundary and thus a syllable boundary, such as &quot;subrayar, ciudadrealeño, postromántico&quot;; compare the corresponding word-initial trills in raya&quot; &#x27;line&#x27;, &quot;Ciudad Real&quot; &quot;Ciudad Real&quot;, and romántico&quot; &quot;Romantic&quot;.

In syllable-final position inside a word, the tap is more frequent, but the trill can also occur (especially in emphatic or oratorical style) with no semantic difference—thus &quot;arma&quot; (&#x27;weapon&#x27;) may be either (tap) or (trill).
In &quot;word&quot;-final position the rhotic is usually:
* either a tap or a trill when followed by a consonant or a pause, as in &quot;amo&quot; &quot;paterno&quot; (&#x27;paternal love&#x27;), the former being more common;
* a tap when followed by a vowel-initial word, as in &quot;amo&quot; &quot;eterno&quot; (&#x27;eternal love&#x27;).

Morphologically, a word-final rhotic always corresponds to the tapped in related words. Thus the word &#x27;smell&#x27; is related to &#x27;smells, smelly&#x27; and not to .

When two rhotics occur consecutively across a word or prefix boundary, they result in one trill, so that &quot;da rocas&quot; (&#x27;they(sg) give rocks&#x27;) and &quot;dar rocas&quot; (&#x27;to give rocks&#x27;) are either neutralized or distinguished by a longer trill in the latter phrase.

The tap/trill alternation has prompted a number of authors to postulate a single underlying rhotic; the intervocalic contrast then results from gemination (e.g. &quot;tierra&quot; &gt; &#x27;earth&#x27;).

====Obstruents====
The phonemes , , and may be voiced before voiced consonants, as in (&#x27;Jasmine&#x27;) , (&#x27;feature&#x27;) , and (&#x27;Afghanistan&#x27;) . There is a certain amount of free variation in this, so can be pronounced or . Such voicing may occur across word boundaries, causing (&#x27;merry Christmas&#x27;) /feˈliθ nabiˈdad/ to be pronounced [feˈlið naβ̞iˈð̞að̞]. In one region of Spain, the area around Madrid, word-final is sometimes pronounced , especially in a colloquial pronunciation of the city&#x27;s name, &quot;Madriz&quot; (). More so, in some words now spelled with &quot;-z-&quot; before a voiced consonant, the phoneme is in fact diachronically derived from original or . For example, comes from Old Spanish , and comes from Old Spanish , from Latin .

Both in casual and formal speech, there is no phonemic contrast between voiced and voiceless consonants placed in syllable-final position. The merged phoneme is typically pronounced as a relaxed, voiced fricative or approximant, although a variety of other realizations are also possible. So the clusters -- and -- in the words and are pronounced exactly the same way:
* 
Similarly, the spellings and are often merged in pronunciation, as well as -- and --:
* 
* 

==Semivowels==
Traditionally, the palatal consonant phoneme is considered to occur only as a syllable onset, whereas the palatal glide that can be found after an onset consonant in words like &quot;bien&quot; is analyzed as a non-syllabic version of the vowel phoneme (which forms part of the syllable nucleus, being pronounced with the following vowel as a rising diphthong). The approximant allophone of , which can be transcribed as , differs phonetically from in the following respects: has a lower F2 amplitude, is longer, can be replaced by a palatal fricative in emphatic pronunciations, and is unspecified for rounding (e.g. &quot;viuda&quot; &#x27;widow&#x27; vs. &quot;ayuda&quot; &#x27;help&#x27;).

After a consonant, the surface contrast between and depends on syllabification, which in turn is largely predictable from morphology: the syllable boundary before corresponds to the morphological boundary after a prefix. A contrast is therefore possible after any consonant that can end a syllable, as illustrated by the following minimal or near-minimal pairs: after (&quot;italiano&quot; &#x27;Italian&#x27; vs. &quot;y tal llano&quot; &#x27;and such a plain&#x27;), after (&quot;enyesar&quot; &#x27;to plaster&#x27; vs. &quot;aniego&quot; &#x27;flood&#x27;) after (&quot;desierto&quot; &#x27;desert&#x27; vs. &quot;deshielo&quot; &#x27;thawing&#x27;), after (&quot;abierto&quot; &#x27;open&#x27; vs. &quot;abyecto&quot; &#x27;abject&#x27;).

Although there is dialectal and idiolectal variation, speakers may also exhibit a contrast in phrase-initial position. In Argentine Spanish, the change of to a fricative realized as has resulted in clear contrast between this consonant and the glide ; the latter occurs as a result of spelling pronunciation in words spelled with , such as &#x27;grass&#x27; (which thus forms a minimal pair in Argentine Spanish with the doublet &#x27;maté leaves&#x27;).

There are some alternations between the two, prompting scholars like to postulate an archiphoneme , so that &quot;ley&quot; would be transcribed phonemically as and &quot;leyes&quot; as .

In a number of varieties, including some American ones, there is a similar distinction between the non-syllabic version of the vowel and a rare consonantal . Near-minimal pairs include &quot;deshuesar&quot; (&#x27;to debone&#x27;) vs. &quot;desuello&quot; (&#x27;skinning&#x27;), &quot;son huevos&quot; (&#x27;they are eggs&#x27;) vs. &quot;son nuevos&quot; (&#x27;they are new&#x27;), and huaca&quot; (&#x27;Indian grave&#x27;) vs. u oca&quot; (&#x27;or goose&#x27;).

Spanish has five vowel phonemes, , , , and (the same as Asturian-Leonese, Aragonese, and also Basque). Each of the five vowels occurs in both stressed and unstressed syllables:

Nevertheless, there are some distributional gaps or rarities. For instance, the close vowels are rare in unstressed word-final syllables.

There is no surface phonemic distinction between close-mid and open-mid vowels, unlike in Catalan, Galician, French, Italian and Portuguese. In the historical development of Spanish, former open-mid vowels were replaced with diphthongs in stressed syllables, and merged with the close-mid in unstressed syllables. The diphthongs regularly correspond to open in Portuguese cognates; compare &quot;siete&quot; &#x27;seven&#x27; and &quot;fuerte&quot; &#x27;strong&#x27; with the Portuguese cognates &quot;sete&quot; and &quot;forte&quot; , meaning the same.

There are some synchronic alternations between the diphthongs in stressed syllables and the monophthongs in unstressed syllables: compare &quot;heló&quot; &#x27;it froze&#x27; and &quot;tostó&quot; &#x27;he toasted&#x27; with &quot;hiela&quot; &#x27;it freezes&#x27; and &quot;tuesto&quot; &#x27;I toast&#x27;. It has thus been argued that the historically open-mid vowels remain underlyingly, giving Spanish seven vowel phonemes.

Because of substratal Quechua, at least some speakers from southern Colombia down through Peru can be analyzed to have only three vowel phonemes , as the close are continually confused with the mid , resulting in pronunciations such as for &quot;dulzura&quot; (&#x27;sweetness&#x27;). When Quechua-dominant bilinguals have in their phonemic inventory, they realize them as , which are heard by outsiders as variants of . Both of those features are viewed as strongly non-standard by other speakers.

===Allophones===
Vowels are phonetically nasalized between nasal consonants or before a syllable-final nasal, e.g. (&#x27;five&#x27;) and (&#x27;hand&#x27;).

Arguably, Eastern Andalusian and Murcian Spanish have ten phonemic vowels, with each of the above vowels paired by a lowered or fronted and lengthened version, e.g. (&#x27;the mother&#x27;) vs. (&#x27;the mothers&#x27;). However, these are more commonly analyzed as allophones triggered by an underlying that is subsequently deleted.

====Exact number of allophones====
There is no agreement among scholars on how many vowel allophones Spanish has; an often postulated number is five .

Some scholars, however, state that Spanish has &quot;eleven&quot; allophones: the close and mid vowels have close and open allophones, whereas appears in front , central and back variants. These symbols appear only in the narrowest variant of phonetic transcription; in broader variants, only the symbols are used, and that is the convention adopted in the rest of this article.

Tomás Navarro Tomás describes the distribution of said eleven allophones as follows:

* Close vowels 
** The close allophones appear in open syllables, e.g. in the words &#x27;free&#x27; and &#x27;to raise&#x27;
** The open allophones are phonetically near-close , and appear:
*** In closed syllables, e.g. in the word &#x27;end&#x27;
*** In both open and closed syllables when in contact with , e.g. in the words &#x27;rich&#x27; and &#x27;blond&#x27;
*** In both open and closed syllables when before , e.g. in the words &#x27;son&#x27; and &#x27;they(sg) bid&#x27;
* Mid front vowel 
** The close allophone is phonetically close-mid , and appears:
*** In open syllables, e.g. in the word &#x27;finger&#x27;
*** In closed syllables when before , e.g. in the word &#x27;Valencia&#x27;
** The open allophone is phonetically open-mid , and appears:
*** In open syllables when in contact with , e.g. in the words &#x27;war&#x27; and &#x27;challenge&#x27;
*** In closed syllables when not followed by , e.g. in the word &#x27;Belgian&#x27;
*** In the diphthong , e.g. in the words &#x27;comb&#x27; and &quot;king&quot;
* Mid back vowel 
** The close allophone is phonetically close-mid , and appears in open syllables, e.g. in the word &#x27;how&#x27;
** The open allophone is phonetically open-mid , and appears:
*** In closed syllables, e.g. in the word &#x27;with&#x27;
*** In both open and closed syllables when in contact with , e.g. in the words &#x27;I run&#x27;, &#x27;mud&#x27;, and &#x27;oak&#x27;
*** In both open and closed syllables when before , e.g. in the word &#x27;eye&#x27;
*** In the diphthong , e.g. in the word &#x27;today&#x27;
*** In stressed position when preceded by and followed by either or , e.g. in the word &#x27;now&#x27;
* Open vowel 
** The front allophone appears:
*** Before palatal consonants, e.g. in the word &#x27;office&#x27;
*** In the diphthong , e.g. in the word &#x27;air&#x27;
** The back allophone appears:
*** In the diphthong , e.g. in the word &#x27;flute&#x27;
*** Before 
*** In closed syllables before , e.g. in the word &#x27;salt&#x27;
*** In both open and closed syllables when before , e.g. in the word &#x27;chop&#x27;
** The central allophone appears in all other cases, e.g. in the word 

According to Eugenio Martínez Celdrán, however, systematic classification of Spanish allophones is impossible since their occurrence varies from speaker to speaker and from region to region. According to him, the exact degree of openness of Spanish vowels depends not so much on the phonetic environment but rather on various external factors accompanying speech.

===Diphthongs and triphthongs===
Spanish has six falling diphthongs and eight rising diphthongs. While many diphthongs are historically the result of a recategorization of vowel sequences (hiatus) as diphthongs, there is still lexical contrast between diphthongs and hiatus. Some lexical items vary by speaker or dialect between hiatus and diphthong. Words like (&#x27;biologist&#x27;) with a potential diphthong in the first syllable and words like with a stressed or pretonic sequence of and a vowel vary between a diphthong and hiatus. hypothesize that this is caused by vocalic sequences being longer in those positions.

In addition to synalepha across word boundaries, sequences of vowels in hiatus become diphthongs in fast speech. When this happens, one vowel becomes non-syllabic (unless they are the same vowel in which case they fuse together) as in (&#x27;poet&#x27;) and (&#x27;teacher&#x27;). Similarly, the relatively rare diphthong may be reduced to in certain unstressed contexts, as in , . In the case of verbs like (&#x27;relieve&#x27;), diphthongs result from the suffixation of normal verbal morphology onto a stem-final (that is, would be || + ||). This contrasts with verbs like (&#x27;to extend&#x27;) which, by their verbal morphology, seem to have stems ending in .

Non-syllabic and can be reduced to , , as in (&#x27;beatitude&#x27;) and (&#x27;poetess&#x27;), respectively; similarly, non-syllabic can be completely elided, as in ( &#x27;right away&#x27;). The frequency (though not the presence) of this phenomenon varies by dialect: in a number it rarely occurs, while others always exhibit it.

Spanish also possesses triphthongs like and, in dialects that use a second-person plural conjugation, , , and (e.g. , &#x27;ox&#x27;; , &#x27;you change&#x27;; , &#x27;(that) you may change&#x27;; and , &#x27;you ascertain&#x27;).

==Prosody==
Spanish is usually considered a syllable-timed language. Even so, stressed syllables may be up to 50% longer in duration than non-stressed syllables. Although pitch, duration, and loudness contribute to the perception of stress, pitch is the most important in isolation.

Primary stress falls on the penultima (second-last syllable) 80% of the time. The other 20% of the time, stress falls on the ultima (last syllable) or on the antepenultima (third-last syllable).

Nonverbs are generally stressed on the penultimate syllable for vowel-final words and on the final syllable of consonant-final words. Exceptions are marked orthographically (see below), and regular words are underlyingly phonologically marked with a stress feature [+stress].

In addition to exceptions to these tendencies, particularly learned words from Greek and Latin that feature antepenultimate stress, there are numerous minimal pairs that contrast solely on stress such as (&#x27;sheet&#x27;) and (&#x27;savannah&#x27;), as well as (&#x27;boundary&#x27;), (&#x27;[that] they(sg.) limit&#x27;) and (&#x27;I limited&#x27;).

Lexical stress may be marked orthographically with an acute accent (, , etc.). This is done according to the mandatory stress rules of Spanish orthography, which parallel the tendencies above (differing with words like ) and are defined so as to unequivocally indicate where the stress lies in a given written word. An acute accent may also be used to differentiate homophones, such as (&#x27;my&#x27;) and (&#x27;me&#x27;). In such cases, the accent is used on the homophone that normally receives greater stress when it is used in a sentence.

Lexical stress patterns are different between words carrying verbal and nominal inflection: in addition to the occurrence of verbal affixes with stress (something absent in nominal inflection), underlying stress also differs in that it falls on the last syllable of the inflectional stem in verbal words while those of nominal words may have ultimate or penultimate stress. In addition, in sequences of clitics suffixed to a verb, the rightmost clitic may receive secondary stress: (&#x27;look for it&#x27;).

==Phonotactics==
===Syllable structure===
Spanish syllable structure consists of an optional syllable onset, consisting of one or two consonants; an obligatory syllable nucleus, consisting of a vowel optionally preceded by and/or followed by a semivowel; and an optional syllable coda, consisting of one or two consonants. This can be summarized as follows (parentheses enclose optional components):
* (C1 (C2)) (S1) V (S2) (C3 (C4))

The following restrictions apply:
* Onset
** First consonant (C1): Can be any consonant. Either or is possible as a word-internal onset after a vowel, but as discussed above, the contrast between the two rhotic consonants is neutralized at the start of a word or when the preceding syllable ends in a consonant: only is possible in those positions.
** Second consonant (C2): Can be or . Permitted only if the first consonant is a stop , a voiceless labiodental fricative , or marginally the nonstandard /v/. is prohibited as an onset cluster in most of Peninsular Spanish, while sequences such as in &#x27;athlete&#x27; are usually treated as an onset cluster in Latin America and the Canaries. The sequence is also avoided as an onset, seemingly to a greater degree than .
* Nucleus
** Semivowel (S1): Can be or , normally analyzed phonemically as allophones of non-syllabic . Cannot be identical to the following vowel (* and * do not occur within a syllable). 
** Vowel (V): Can be any of .
** Semivowel (S2): Can be or , normally analyzed phonemically as allophones of non-syllabic . The sequences *, * and * do not occur within a syllable. Some linguists consider postvocalic glides to be part of the coda rather than the nucleus.
* Coda
** First consonant (C3): Can be any consonant except , or .
** Second consonant (C4): Always in native Spanish words. Other consonants, except , and , are tolerated as long as they are less sonorous than the first consonant in the coda, such as in or the Catalan last name , but the final element is sometimes deleted in colloquial speech. A coda of two consonants never appears in words inherited from Vulgar Latin.
** In many dialects, a coda cannot be more than one consonant (one of n, r, l or s) in informal speech. Realizations like , , are very common, and in many cases, they are allowed even in formal speech.

Maximal onsets include , , .

Maximal nuclei include , .

Maximal codas include , .

Spanish syllable structure is phrasal, resulting in syllables consisting of phonemes from neighboring words in combination, sometimes even resulting in elision. The phenomenon is known in Spanish as . For a brief discussion contrasting Spanish and English syllable structure, see .

===Other phonotactic tendencies===

* The palatal sonorants are rare in certain positions, although this may be a consequence of their diachronic origins (being derived often, though not exclusively, from Latin geminate consonants) rather than a matter of synchronic constraints. 
**Per Baker 2004, the palatal sonorants are not found as word-internal onsets when the preceding syllable ends in a coda consonant or glide. A number of exceptions to this generalization exist, however, including prefixed or compound words (such as , , ), borrowed words (such as , , , from Quechua), and forms that originate from non-Castilian Romance varieties (such as Asturian ). The sequence occurs in some proper names, such as the toponym Auñón (from Latin ) and Auñamendi (a publishing house name taken from the Basque name of the Pic d&#x27;Anie); occurs in some words, such as and . 
**Although word-initial is not forbidden (for example, it occurs in borrowed words such as and and in dialectal forms such as ) it is relatively rare and so may be described as having restricted distribution in this position.
* In native Spanish words, the trill does not appear after a glide. That said, it does appear after in some Basque loans, such as Aurrerá, a grocery store, Abaurrea Alta and Abaurrea Baja, towns in Navarre, , a type of dance, and , an adjective referring to poorly tilled land.
*When the final syllable of a word begins with any of , the word typically does not display antepenultimate stress.

=== Epenthesis ===
Because of the phonotactic constraints, an epenthetic is inserted before word-initial clusters beginning with (e.g. &#x27;to write&#x27;) but not word-internally ( &#x27;to transcribe&#x27;), thereby moving the initial to a separate syllable. Except in careful pronunciation, the epenthetic is pronounced even when it is not reflected in spelling (e.g. the surname of Carlos Slim is pronounced ). While Spanish words undergo word-initial epenthesis, cognates in Latin and Italian do not:

* Lat. &quot;status&quot; (&#x27;state&#x27;) ~ It. &quot;stato&quot; ~ Sp. 
* Lat. &quot;splendidus&quot; (&#x27;splendid&#x27;) ~ It. &quot;splendido&quot; ~ Sp. 
* Fr. &quot;slave&quot; (&#x27;Slav&#x27;) ~ It. &quot;slavo&quot; ~ Sp. 

In addition, Spanish adopts foreign words starting with pre-nasalized consonants with an epenthetic . , a prominent last name from Equatorial Guinea, is pronounced as .

When adapting word-final complex codas that show rising sonority, an epenthetic is inserted between the two consonants. For example, is typically pronounced .

Occasionally Spanish speakers are faced with onset clusters containing elements of equal or near-equal sonority, such as (a German last name that is common in parts of South America). Assimilated borrowings usually delete the first element in such clusters, as in &#x27;psychology&#x27;. When attempting to pronounce such words for the first time without deleting the first consonant, Spanish speakers insert a short, often devoiced, schwa-like vowel between the two consonants.

==Alternations==
Some alternations exist in Spanish that reflect diachronic changes in the language and arguably reflect morphophonological processes rather than strictly phonological ones. For instance, some words alternate between and or and , with the latter in each pair appearing before a front vowel:

Note that the conjugation of most verbs with a stem ending in or does &quot;not&quot; show this alternation; these segments do not turn into or before a front vowel:

There are also alternations between unstressed and and stressed (or , when initial) and respectively:

Likewise, in a very small number of words, alternations occur between the palatal sonorants and their corresponding alveolar sonorants (/ &#x27;maiden&#x27;/&#x27;youth&#x27;, / &#x27;to scorn&#x27;/&#x27;scorn&#x27;). This alternation does not appear in verbal or nominal inflection (that is, the plural of is , not ). This is the result of geminated and of Vulgar Latin (the origin of and , respectively) degeminating and then depalatalizing in coda position. Words without any palatal-alveolar allomorphy are the result of historical borrowings.

Other alternations include ~ ( vs. ), ~ ( vs. ). Here the forms with and are historical borrowings and the forms with and forms are inherited from Vulgar Latin.

There are also pairs that show antepenultimate stress in nouns and adjectives but penultimate stress in synonymous verbs ( &#x27;vomit&#x27; vs. &#x27;I vomit&#x27;).

==Acquisition as first language==

===Phonology===
Phonological development varies greatly by individual for both those developing regularly and those with delays. However, a general pattern of acquisition of phonemes can be inferred by the level of complexity of their features, i.e. by sound classes. A hierarchy may be constructed, and if a child is capable of producing discrimination on one level, they will also be capable of making the discriminations of all prior levels.

* The first level consists of stops (without a voicing distinction), nasals, , and optionally a non-lateral approximant. This includes a labial/coronal place difference ( vs. and vs. ).
* The second level includes voicing distinction for oral stops and a coronal/dorsal place difference. This allows for a distinction between , , and , along with their voiced counterparts, as well as a distinction between and the approximant .
* The third level includes fricatives and/or affricates.
* The fourth level introduces liquids other than , and . It also introduces .
* The fifth level introduces the trill .

This hierarchy is based on production only and is a representation of a child&#x27;s capacity to produce a sound, whether that sound is the correct target in adult speech or not. Thus, it may contain some sounds that are not included in adult phonology but are produced as a result of error.

Spanish-speaking children will accurately produce most segments at a relatively early age. By around three-and-a-half years, they will no longer productively use phonological processes the majority of the time. Some common error patterns (found 10% or more of the time) are cluster reduction, liquid simplification, and stopping. Less common patterns (evidenced less than 10% of the time) include palatal fronting, assimilation, and final consonant deletion.

Typical phonological analyses of Spanish consider the consonants , , and the underlying phonemes and their corresponding approximants , , and allophonic and derivable by phonological rules. However, approximants may be the more basic form because monolingual Spanish-learning children learn to produce the continuant contrast between and before they produce the lead voicing contrast between and . (In comparison, English-learning children are able to produce adult-like voicing contrasts for these stops well before age three.) The allophonic distribution of and produced in adult speech is not learned until after age two and not fully mastered even at age four.

The alveolar trill is one of the most difficult sounds to produce in Spanish and is acquired later in development. Research suggests that the alveolar trill is acquired and developed between the ages of three and six years. Some children acquire an adult-like trill within this period, and some fail to properly acquire the trill. The attempted trill sound of the poor trillers is often perceived as a series of taps owing to hyperactive tongue movement during production. The trill is also often very difficult for those learning Spanish as a second language, sometimes taking over a year to be produced properly.

===Codas===
One study found that children acquire medial codas before final codas, and stressed codas before unstressed codas. Since medial codas are often stressed and must undergo place assimilation, greater importance is accorded to their acquisition. Liquid and nasal codas occur word-medially and at the ends of frequently-used function words and so they are often acquired first.

===Prosody===
Research suggests that children overgeneralize stress rules when they are reproducing novel Spanish words and that they have a tendency to stress the penultimate syllables of antepenultimately stressed words to avoid a violation of nonverb stress rules that they have acquired. Many of the most frequent words heard by children have irregular stress patterns or are verbs, which violate nonverb stress rules. This complicates stress rules until ages three to four, when stress acquisition is essentially complete, and children begin to apply these rules to novel irregular situations.

==Dialectal variation==
Some features, such as the pronunciation of voiceless stops , have no dialectal variation. However, there are numerous other features of pronunciation that differ from dialect to dialect.

===&quot;Yeísmo&quot;===

One notable dialectal feature is the merging of the voiced palatal approximant (as in &quot;ayer&quot;) with the palatal lateral approximant (as in ) into one phoneme (&quot;yeísmo&quot;), with losing its laterality. While the distinction between these two sounds has traditionally been a feature of Castilian Spanish, this merger has spread throughout most of Spain in recent generations, particularly outside of regions in close linguistic contact with Catalan and Basque. In Spanish America, most dialects are characterized by this merger, with the distinction persisting mostly in parts of Peru, Bolivia, Paraguay, and northwestern Argentina. In the other parts of Argentina, the phoneme resulting from the merger is realized as , and in Buenos Aires. the sound has recently been devoiced to for the younger population, a change that is spreading throughout Argentina.

===&quot;Seseo&quot;, &quot;ceceo&quot; and &quot;distinción&quot;===
Speakers in northern and central Spain, including the variety prevalent on radio and television, have both and (&quot;distinción&quot;, &#x27;distinction&#x27;). However, speakers in Latin America, the Canary Islands and some parts of southern Spain have only (&quot;seseo&quot;), which in southernmost Spain is pronounced , not (&quot;ceceo&quot;).

====Realization of ====
The phoneme has three different pronunciations depending on the dialect area:
# An alveolar retracted fricative (or &quot;apico-alveolar&quot; fricative) , which sounds similar to English and is characteristic of the northern and central parts of Spain and is also used by many speakers in Colombia&#x27;s Antioquia Department.
# A alveolar grooved fricative , much like the most common pronunciation of English , is characteristic of western Andalusia (e.g. Málaga, Seville, and Cádiz), the Canary Islands, and Latin America.
# An dental grooved fricative (ad hoc symbol), which has a lisping quality and sounds something like a cross between English and but is different from the occurring in dialects that distinguish and . It occurs only in dialects with ceceo, mostly in Granada, in parts of Jaén, in the southern part of Sevilla and the mountainous areas shared between Cádiz and Málaga.

Obaid describes the apico-alveolar sound as follows:
Dalbor describes the apico-dental sound as follows:
In some dialects, may become the approximant in the syllable coda (e.g. &quot;doscientos&quot; &#x27;two hundred&#x27;). In southern dialects in Spain, most lowland dialects in the Americas, and in the Canary Islands, it debuccalizes to in final position (e.g. &quot;niños&quot; &#x27;children&#x27;), or before another consonant (e.g. &#x27;match&#x27;) and so the change occurs in the coda position in a syllable. In Spain, this was originally a southern feature, but is now expanding rapidly to the north.

From an autosegmental point of view, the phoneme in Madrid is defined only by its &quot;voiceless&quot; and &quot;fricative&quot; features. Thus, the point of articulation is not defined and is determined from the sounds after it in a word or sentence. In Madrid, the following realizations are found: &gt; and &gt; . In parts of southern Spain, the only feature defined for appears to be &quot;voiceless&quot;; it may lose its oral articulation entirely to become or even a geminate with the following consonant ( or from &#x27;same&#x27;). In Eastern Andalusian and Murcian Spanish, word-final , and regularly weaken, and the preceding vowel is lowered and lengthened:
: &gt; e.g. &quot;mis&quot; (&#x27;my&#x27; pl)
: &gt; e.g. &quot;mes&quot; (&#x27;month&#x27;)
: &gt; e.g. &quot;más&quot; (&#x27;plus&#x27;)
: &gt; e.g. &quot;tos&quot; (&#x27;cough&#x27;)
: &gt; e.g. &quot;tus&quot; (&#x27;your&#x27; pl)

A subsequent process of vowel harmony takes place and so (&#x27;far&#x27;) is , (&#x27;you [plural] have&#x27;) is and (&#x27;clovers&#x27;) is or .

===Coda simplification===
Southern European Spanish (Andalusian Spanish, Murcian Spanish, etc.) and several lowland dialects in Latin America (such as those from the Caribbean, Panama, and the Atlantic coast of Colombia) exhibit more extreme forms of simplification of coda consonants:
* word-final dropping of (e.g. &quot;compás&quot; &#x27;musical beat&#x27; or &#x27;compass&#x27;)
* word-final dropping of nasals with nasalization of the preceding vowel (e.g. &quot;ven&quot; &#x27;come&#x27;)
* dropping of in the infinitival morpheme (e.g. &quot;comer&quot; &#x27;to eat&#x27;)
* the occasional dropping of coda consonants word-internally (e.g. &quot;doctor&quot; &#x27;doctor&#x27;).

The dropped consonants appear when additional suffixation occurs (e.g. &quot;compases&quot; &#x27;beats&#x27;, &quot;venían&quot; &#x27;they were coming&#x27;, &quot;comeremos&quot; &#x27;we will eat&#x27;). Similarly, a number of coda assimilations occur:
* and may neutralize to (e.g. Cibaeño Dominican &quot;celda&quot;/&quot;cerda&quot; &#x27;cell&#x27;/&#x27;bristle&#x27;), to (e.g. Caribbean Spanish &quot;alma&quot;/&quot;arma&quot; &#x27;soul&#x27;/&#x27;weapon&#x27;, Andalusian Spanish &quot;sartén&quot; &#x27;pan&#x27;), to (e.g. Andalusian Spanish &quot;alma&quot;/&quot;arma&quot; ) or, by complete regressive assimilation, to a copy of the following consonant (e.g. &quot;pulga&quot;/&quot;purga&quot; &#x27;flea&#x27;/&#x27;purge&#x27;, &quot;carne&quot; &#x27;meat&#x27;).
* , , (and in southern Peninsular Spanish) and may be debuccalized or elided in the coda (e.g. &quot;los amigos&quot; &#x27;the friends&#x27;).
* Stops and nasals may be realized as velar (e.g. Cuban and Venezuelan &quot;étnico&quot; &#x27;ethnic&#x27;, &quot;himno&quot; &#x27;anthem&#x27;).

Final dropping (e.g. &quot;mitad&quot; &#x27;half&#x27;) is general in most dialects of Spanish, even in formal speech.

The neutralization of syllable-final , , and is widespread in most dialects (with e.g. &quot;Pepsi&quot; being pronounced ). It does not face as much stigma as other neutralizations and may go unnoticed.

The deletions and neutralizations show variability in their occurrence, even with the same speaker in the same utterance, so non-deleted forms exist in the underlying structure. The dialects may not be on the path to eliminating coda consonants since deletion processes have been existing for more than four centuries. argues that it is the result of speakers acquiring multiple phonological systems with uneven control like that of second language learners.

In Standard European Spanish, the voiced obstruents before a pause are devoiced and laxed to , as in &quot;club (&#x27;[social] club&#x27;), &quot;sed (&#x27;thirst&#x27;), &quot;zigzag . However, word-final is rare, and is even more so. They are restricted mostly to loanwords and foreign names, such as the first name of the former Real Madrid sports director Predrag Mijatović, which is pronounced , and after another consonant, the voiced obstruent may even be deleted, as in &quot;iceberg&quot;, pronounced . In Madrid and its environs, &quot;sed is alternatively pronounced , and the aforementioned alternative pronunciation of word-final as co-exists with the standard realization, but is otherwise nonstandard.

===Loan sounds===
The fricative may also appear in borrowings from other languages, such as Nahuatl and English. In addition, the affricates and also occur in Nahuatl borrowings. That said, the onset cluster is permitted in most of Latin America, the Canaries, and the northwest of Spain, and the fact that it is pronounced in the same amount of time as the other voiceless stop + lateral clusters and support an analysis of the sequence as a cluster, rather than an affricate, in Mexican Spanish.

<doc id="815920" wikidata="Q360961" url="?curid=815920" title="Natan Sharansky">
<text>Natan Sharansky (; born 20 January 1948) is an Israeli politician, human rights activist, and author. He served as Chairman of the Executive for the Jewish Agency from June 2009 to August 2018, and currently serves as Chairman for the Institute for the Study of Global Antisemitism and Policy (ISGAP), an American non-partisan organization. A former Soviet dissident, he spent nine years imprisoned as a refusenik during the 1970s and 1980s.

==Biography==
Sharansky was born into a Jewish family on in the city of Stalino, Ukrainian Soviet Socialist Republic (now Donetsk, Ukraine) in the Soviet Union.

His father, Boris Shcharansky, a journalist from a Zionist background who worked for an industrial journal, died in 1980, before Natan was freed.

His mother, Ida Milgrom, visited him in prison and stubbornly waged a nine-year battle for her son&#x27;s release from Soviet prison and labor camps along with his wife. She was permitted to follow her son to Israel six months after he left the Soviet Union.

He attended physics and mathematics high school No.17 in Donetsk. As a child, he was a chess prodigy. He performed in simultaneous and blindfold exhibitions, usually against adults. At the age of 15, he won the championship in his native Donetsk. Sharansky graduated with a degree in applied mathematics from Moscow Institute of Physics and Technology. When incarcerated in solitary confinement, he claims to have maintained his sanity by playing chess against himself in his mind. Sharansky beat the world chess champion Garry Kasparov in a simultaneous exhibition in Israel in 1996.

After Sharansky graduated from university, he began working for a secret state research laboratory. Sharansky lived near Sokolniki Park, on Kolodezniy Pereulok in Moscow. In his spare time, Sharansky would coach young chess players at the famous chess club in the park.

He took his current Hebrew name in 1986 when he was freed from Soviet incarceration as part of a prisoner exchange and received an Israeli passport with his new name.

Natan Sharansky is married to Avital Sharansky and has two daughters, Rachel and Hannah. In the Soviet Union, his application to marry Avital was denied by the authorities. They were married in a friend&#x27;s apartment, in a ceremony not recognized by the government, as the USSR only recognized civil marriage and not religious marriage.

==Arrest and imprisonment==
Sharansky was denied an exit visa to Israel in 1973. The reason given for denial of the visa was that he was given access, at some point in his career, to information vital to Soviet national security and could not now be allowed to leave. After becoming a refusenik, Sharansky became a human rights activist, working as a translator for dissident and nuclear physicist Andrei Sakharov, and spokesman for the Moscow Helsinki Group and a leader for the rights of refuseniks.
On 15 March 1977 Sharansky was arrested by the KGB, then headed by Yuri Andropov, on multiple charges, including high treason and spying for several Americans. The accusation stated that he passed to the West lists of over 1,300 &quot;refuseniks&quot;, many of whom were denied exit visas because of their knowledge of state secrets, which resulted in a publication by Robert C. Toth, &quot;Russ Indirectly Reveal &#x27;State Secrets&#x27;: Clues in Denials of Jewish Visas&quot;. High treason carried the death penalty. The following year, in 1978, he was sentenced to 13 years of forced labor.

Sharansky spent time in Moscow&#x27;s Lefortovo Prison, followed by Vladimir and Chistopol prisons, where for part of the time he was placed in solitary confinement. His health deteriorated, to the point of endangering his life. Later he was detained in Perm 35, a post-Stalin-Gulag-type so-called &quot;strict regimen colony&quot; in Perm Oblast.

During his imprisonment, he embarked on hunger strikes to protest confiscation of his mail, and he was force-fed at least 35 times, which he describes as &quot;a sort of torture&quot;. Sharansky later opposed force-feeding of Palestinian detainees.

==Release from detention==

As a result of an international campaign led by his wife, Avital Sharansky (including assistance from East German lawyer Wolfgang Vogel, New York Congressman Benjamin Gilman, and Rabbi Ronald Greenwald), Sharansky was released on 11 February 1986 as part of a larger exchange of detainees. He was the first political prisoner released by Mikhail Gorbachev.

Sharansky and three low-level Western spies (Czech citizen Jaroslav Javorský and West German citizens Wolf-Georg Frohn, and Dietrich Nistroy) were exchanged for Czech spies Karl Koecher and Hana Koecher held in the United States, Soviet spy Yevgeni Zemlyakov, Polish spies Marian Zacharski and , and East German spy Detlef Scharfenorth (the latter four held in West Germany). The men were released in two stages, with Sharansky freed first then whisked away, accompanied by the United States Ambassador to West Germany, Richard R. Burt. The exchange took place on the Glienicke Bridge between West Berlin and East Germany, which was used before for this purpose.

==Aftermath==

Sharansky immediately emigrated to Israel, adopting the Hebrew name &quot;Natan&quot; and eventually simplifying his surname to Sharansky.

Due to his age and poor health, he was exempted from the standard compulsory three years&#x27; IDF service, but had to undergo three weeks of military training and do a stint in the Civil Guard.

In 1988, he wrote &quot;Fear No Evil&quot;, a memoir of his time as a prisoner. He founded the Zionist Forum, an organization of Soviet immigrant Jewish activists dedicated to helping new Israelis and educating the public about integration issues, known in Israel as &quot;klita&quot; (lit. &quot;absorption&quot;). Sharansky also served as a contributing editor to &quot;The Jerusalem Report&quot; and as a board member of .

===Freedom fighter awards===
*In 1986, the United States Congress granted him the Congressional Gold Medal.
*In 1987, the Hadassah Women&#x27;s Zionist Organization of America granted Sharansky the &quot;Henrietta Szold Award&quot;, given by Ruth Popkin.
*In 2006, US President George W. Bush awarded him the Presidential Medal of Freedom.
*On 17 September 2008, the Ronald Reagan Presidential Foundation awarded Sharansky its 2008 Ronald Reagan Freedom Award.

==Israeli political career==
In 1995, Sharansky and Yoel Edelstein founded the Yisrael BaAliyah party (a play on words, since &quot;aliya&quot; means both Jewish emigration to Israel and &quot;rise&quot;, thus the party name means &quot;(People of) Israel immigrating (to the State of Israel)&quot;, as well as &quot;Israel on the rise&quot;), promoting the absorption of the Soviet Jews into Israeli society. The party won seven Knesset seats in 1996. It won 6 seats in the 1999 Israeli legislative election, gaining two ministerial posts, but left the government on 11 July 2000 in response to suggestions that Prime Minister Ehud Barak&#x27;s negotiations with the Palestinians would result in a division of Jerusalem. After Ariel Sharon won a special election for Prime Minister in 2001, the party joined his new government and was again given two ministerial posts.

In the January 2003 elections, the party was reduced to just two seats. Sharansky resigned from the Knesset and was replaced by Edelstein. However, he remained party chairman and decided to merge it into Likud (which had won the election with 38 seats). The merger went through on 10 March 2003, and Sharansky was appointed Minister of Jerusalem Affairs.

From March 2003 – May 2005, he was Israel&#x27;s Minister without Portfolio, responsible for Jerusalem&#x27;s social and Jewish diaspora affairs. Under this position, Sharansky chaired a secret committee that approved the confiscation of East Jerusalem property of West Bank Palestinians. This decision was reversed after an outcry from the Israeli left and the international community.

Previously he served as the Deputy Prime Minister of Israel, Minister of Housing and Construction since March 2001, Interior Minister of Israel (July 1999 – resigned in July 2000), Minister of Industry and Trade (1996–1999).

He resigned from the cabinet in April 2005 to protest plans to withdraw Israeli settlements from the Gaza Strip and northern West Bank.

He was re-elected to the Knesset in March 2006 as a member of the Likud Party. On 20 November 2006, he resigned from the Knesset.

In 2019 Natan Sharansky became the Chairman of the Institute for the study of Global Antisemitism and Policy (ISGAP).

Since 2007, Sharansky has been chairman of the board of Beit Hatefutsot, the Jewish diaspora museum.

In June 2009, Sharansky was elected to the chair of the executive of the Jewish Agency for Israel by the Jewish Agency Board of Governors. In September 2009 Sharansky secured $6 million from the Genesis Philanthropy Group for educational activities in the former Soviet Union.

He is a founding member of One Jerusalem.

Sharanksy is co-Founder and chairman of the Genesis Prize Advisory Board.

==Media recognition and awards==
In 1997, Sharansky was the focus of a 2.5-hour-long episode of &quot;Chaim SheKa&#x27;ele&quot; (&quot;What A Life&quot;), the Israeli version of &quot;This Is Your Life&quot;. The episode focused mainly on his experiences as a Soviet dissident, and featured many of his family and acquaintances. In 2005, Sharansky participated in &quot;They Chose Freedom&quot;, a four-part television documentary on the history of the Soviet dissident movement, and in 2008 he was featured in Laura Bialis&#x27; documentary &quot;Refusenik&quot;. In 2014, he took part in Natella Boltyanskaya&#x27;s documentary &quot;Parallels, Events, People&quot;. He was number eleven on the list of &quot;Time&quot; magazine&#x27;s 100 most influential people of 2005 in the &quot;Scientists and thinkers&quot; category. He won the 2018 Israel Prize for his lifetime achievements and special contributions to the State of Israel in the fields of Immigration and Absorption. He was awarded the 2020 Genesis Prize for his &quot;lifelong struggle for human rights.&quot; He donated the $1 million prize money to organizations combating the coronavirus. In 2024, he received the Bonei Zion Prize in the &quot;Special Recognition&quot; category.

==Published works==
Sharansky is the author of three books. The first is the autobiographical &quot;Fear No Evil&quot;, which dealt with his trial and imprisonment. The book was awarded the 1989 National Jewish Book Award for Biography.

His second book, &quot;The Case for Democracy: The Power of Freedom to Overcome Tyranny and Terror&quot; was co-written with Ron Dermer. George W. Bush offered praise for the book:
If you want a glimpse of how I think about foreign policy, read Natan Sharansky&#x27;s book, &quot;The Case for Democracy&quot;. ... For government, particularly – for opinion makers, I would put it on your recommended reading list. It&#x27;s short and it&#x27;s good. This guy is a heroic figure, as you know. It&#x27;s a great book.

His book &quot;Defending Identity: Its Indispensable Role in Protecting Democracy&quot;, is a defense of the value of national and religious identity in building democracy.

Still another book Never Alone: Prison, Politics, and My People tells about his political activity and how his personal experience influenced it.

==Political views==

Sharansky has argued that there can never be peace between Israel and the Palestinians until there is &quot;the building of real democratic institutions in the fledgling Palestinian society, no matter how tempting a &#x27;solution&#x27; without them may be.&quot; In a &quot;Haaretz&quot; interview, he said:

Jews came here 3,000 years ago and this is the cradle of Jewish civilization. Jews are the only people in history who kept their loyalty to their identity and their land throughout the 2,000 years of exile, and no doubt that they have the right to have their place among nations—not only historically but also geographically. As to the Palestinians, who are the descendants of those Arabs who migrated in the last 200 years, they have the right, if they want, to have their own state ... but not at the expense of the state of Israel.

In the wake of the Arab uprisings of 2011, he told &quot;Moment Magazine&quot;, &quot;To sign an agreement you must have a partner who is dependent on the well-being of his people, which is what democracy means.&quot;

In February 2022, Sharansky called on the Israeli government to take “a clear moral stand” against Russian President Vladimir Putin’s decision to invade Ukraine. He called the Russian invasion of Ukraine the greatest threat to the free world since World War II and said that Israel must stand firmly with the Ukrainian people.

<text>Nongoma is a town in Zululand, KwaZulu-Natal, South Africa. It is the seat of the Nongoma Local Municipality. It is situated 300 km north of Durban and 56 km from Ulundi; it is surrounded by the Ngome Forest. It is a busy market town that serves a large surrounding area. It is assigned registration plate NND (Natal NDwandwe).

This small town is also the home of King Bhekuzulu College, one of the popular boarding schools in the province. There are also TVET College, Mthashana TVET College Nongoma and KwaGqikazi Campuses.

==Royal palaces (Izigodlo)==
The area has six royal palaces belonging to the late Zulu King Goodwill Zwelithini:

* Osuthu Royal Palace - The King lived here.
* Khethomthandayo Royal Palace — His first wife, Queen MaDlamini, lives here.
* KwaDlamahlahla Royal Palace — Queen KaMathe lives here.
* Kwakhangelamankengane Royal Palace — Queen Mother Mantfombi kaSobhuza II -Zulu lives here.
* Linduzulu Royal Palace — Queen MaNdlovu, lives here.
* Enyokeni Royal Palace — Queen MaMchiza lives here, and it is the King&#x27;s only &#x27;traditional&#x27; palace. In early September it is the site of the &quot;Umhlanga&quot; (Reed Dance). It now Belongs to the current king, King Misuzulu

==History==
This area was once the home of King Zwide, a late 18th-century Ndwandwe monarch who was eventually defeated by Shaka at the beginning of the Mfecane wars. 

On 30 March 1883, a Zulu Mandlakazi force under Zibhebhu, defeated a larger uSuthu force (who represented Cetshwayo) in the Msebe Valley near Nongoma. In early March 1883, Zibhebhu had seized the uSuthu kraals (livestock pens) in the heartland of the uSuthu in northern Zululand. which he had been allotted in an expansion of his chiefdom in the Second Partition of Zululand of 1882. In response Ndabuko (Cetshwayo&#x27;s younger brother) gathered around 5,000 uSuthu warriors who marched northward under Makhoba kaMaphitha to retake the kraals. Known as the Battle of Msebe, Makhoba led the uSuthu in an attack on Zibhebhu&#x27;s Mandlakazi forces. The defenders were assisted by five or six Boer allies. They killed over 1,000 of the uSuthu, estimates vary upwards.

The town itself was only established in 1887 with the building of Fort Ivuna by the British as a buffer zone between the Zulu warring factions. It was originally called Ndwandwe but was later replaced by an earlier name given by the local tribesmen to the sacred area where the town stands: KwaNongoma (&quot;place of the diviner or mother of songs&quot;). 

In June 1888 Nongoma was destroyed by the uSuthu but later rebuilt. The fort was used during the Bambatha Rebellion of 1906. 

Three Zulu monarchs are laid to rest in the Nongoma area:
*King Solomon kaDinuzulu (1891–1933), son of King Dinuzulu kaCetshwayo
*King Cyprian Bhekuzulu kaSolomon (1924–1968), son of King Solomon kaDinuzulu and father of the former Zulu King Goodwill Zwelithini.
*King Goodwill Zwelithini (1948–2021), son of King Cyprian Bhekuzulu kaSolomon and father of the reining amaZulu monarch, King Misuzulu Sinqobile kaZwelithini

Originally planned to be Aditya Chopra&#x27;s directorial debut, &quot;Mohabbatein&quot; became his second film after &quot;Dilwale Dulhania Le Jayenge&quot; (1995). Its themes were inspired by those from the 1989 American coming-of-age drama &quot;Dead Poets Society&quot;. The principal photography of &quot;Mohabbatein&quot;, which was filmed in the United Kingdom, was handled by Manmohan Singh between October 1999 and July 2000. Sharmishta Roy and Karan Johar built the sets and designed the costumes, respectively. The duo Jatin–Lalit composed its music while Anand Bakshi wrote the lyrics.

Released on 27 October 2000, &quot;Mohabbatein&quot; received widespread critical acclaim, with Bachchan and Khan&#x27;s performances garnering the most praise. With a worldwide gross of , the film emerged as a major commercial success at the box-office, ranking as the highest-grossing Indian film of the year. In addition to this, it received four Filmfare Awards, three Bollywood Movie Awards, four International Indian Film Academy Awards, one Screen Award, five Sansui Viewers&#x27; Choice Movie Awards, and two Zee Cine Awards.

== Plot ==
Narayan Shankar has been the strict principal of Gurukul, a prestigious all-boys college, for 25 years. Narayan believes in bringing the best out of his students by emphasizing honour, tradition, and discipline. He disdains fun and is particularly intolerant of romance, threatening to expel any student who is caught having a romantic affair. Despite these rules, three Gurukul students—Sameer, Vicky, and Karan—fall in love. Sameer falls for Sanjana, his childhood friend; Vicky is attracted to Ishika, a student at the neighbouring all-girls college; and Karan is infatuated with Kiran, a young widow whom Karan sees alone one night in a train station.

Narayan hires Raj Aryan as Gurukul&#x27;s new music teacher. Raj believes in the power of love and decides to spread love throughout Gurukul. He sympathizes with the predicaments of Sameer, Vicky, and Karan, and encourages them to persist and stay loyal to their loves. Raj manages to help all three of the boys reach out to their loved ones. He gets Sameer a part time job at a cafe in the marketplace outside Gurukul to be closer with Sanjana, who lives there; he allows Vicky to attend dance sessions with Ishika at the all-girls college; and he gives private piano lessons to Karan to impress Kiran and her family. Raj tells the three students he had a special love himself, and that although she is dead, she accompanies him every day as a ghost.

One day, as part of his plan, Raj throws a party, to which he invites the students of the all-girls college. Narayan discovers the party and threatens to dismiss Raj. At this point, Raj reveals he had been a student at Gurukul over a decade earlier and that he had fallen in love with Megha, Narayan&#x27;s only daughter. Narayan had summarily expelled Raj from the college and the distraught Megha had committed suicide. Raj tells Narayan he has returned to Gurukul to honour Megha&#x27;s memory by reversing the college&#x27;s zero-tolerance policy on romance; he promises he will fill the school with love and that Narayan will be unable to stop it. Narayan is shocked; he takes this as a challenge and allows Raj to remain.

Sameer, Vicky, and Karan are able to win over Sanjana, Ishika, and Kiran, respectively, but Narayan retaliates by tightening the college&#x27;s rules after he caught Vicky arriving late at night but got saved by Raj. The student body, however, encouraged by Raj, continues to defy the rules and, in a final effort to preserve the school atmosphere he had built up for 25 years, Narayan expels the three students. Raj speaks up on their behalf, stating they did nothing wrong by falling in love and accusing Narayan of causing his own daughter&#x27;s death with his intolerance of love. Raj says he feels Narayan lost the challenge because his daughter left him and now Raj, who considered Narayan an elder, is leaving him as well. Raj&#x27;s words hurt Narayan, who realizes his strict no-romance policy is misguided. Narayan apologizes to the student body, resigns as principal of Gurukul, and nominates Raj as his successor. Raj accepts and reconciles with Narayan.

== Production ==
Before the production of the romantic drama &quot;Dilwale Dulhania Le Jayenge&quot; (1995)—one of the highest-grossing films and the longest-running film in Indian cinema history—Aditya Chopra had started to write &quot;Mohabbatein&quot; to make his directorial debut. Chopra felt &quot;Mohabbatein&quot; subject matter was too mature, making &quot;Dilwale Dulhania Le Jayenge&quot; his first film as a director and &quot;Mohabbatein&quot; his second. Wanting his next film to have different themes, he conceived &quot;Mohabbatein&quot; as a thriller but changed his mind and decided to make another romantic film. He stated, &quot;I realized that there is something in that story that keeps drawing me to it, so one day I just shut my thriller file and casually picked up my [...] &quot;Mohabbatein&quot; file—that one simple action decided my second film for me&quot;. 

Chopra started to write &quot;Mohabbatein&quot; after the release of &quot;Dil To Pagal Hai&quot; (1997) — he wanted it to be about more than just romantic stories. According to the &quot;Encyclopaedia of Hindi Cinema&quot;, the film was inspired by the 1989 American coming-of-age drama &quot;Dead Poets Society&quot;. Chopra then narrated &quot;Mohabbatein&quot; to his father Yash Chopra, who was impressed by it; the latter also produced the film under his banner Yash Raj Films. In a &quot;Screen&quot; interview, Yash Chopra described it as &quot;a modern film, a film about today and it has all the ingredients of entertainment for people of all ages&quot;. He said the film shows the honour of Indian traditions and their values, adding, &quot;On the whole Aditya has made an honest film, honest to God and honest to the audience who has given us so much&quot;. 

The project was announced in June 1999 on Yash Raj Films&#x27; website. Chopra told his father he would cast Amitabh Bachchan, Shah Rukh Khan, and Aishwarya Rai in the lead roles, saying he could not think of other suitable actors; the three immediately accepted. &quot;Mohabbatein&quot; is Khan&#x27;s second collaboration with Rai after the romantic action film &quot;Josh&quot; (2000), and the first with Bachchan. Kajol was the first choice for the role of Megha, but she declined it because of her marriage. Bachchan, playing Narayan, felt the part was his best role after the action crime film &quot;Deewaar&quot; (1975), and said he only accepted the part because of &quot;the fantastic script&quot; by Aditya Chopra, whom he called &quot;the little boy&quot;. 

To complete the casting, Chopra sought six new actors; three male and three female. Aditya&#x27;s brother Uday Chopra wanted to make his acting debut in the film; Aditya Chopra and his assistants travelled across India to find the other five newcomers; he cast Shamita Shetty, Jugal Hansraj, Kim Sharma, Jimmy Sheirgill, and Preeti Jhangiani. A gymnasium was built specifically for their training before filming began. Amrish Puri, Shefali Shah, and Helen made special appearances. Aditya Chopra also wrote the film&#x27;s dialogue. 

The principal photography of &quot;Mohabbatein&quot; was handled by Manmohan Singh and commenced on 25 October 1999, taking place in the United Kingdom. Karan Johar designed the costumes for Bachchan and Khan while Manish Malhotra designed them for Rai. Farah Khan was the choreographer. Sharmishta Roy, a frequent collaborator with Yash Raj Films, served as the art director. When asked by Shilpa Bharatan-Iyer of &quot;Rediff.com&quot;, Roy described the film as a &quot;learning experience&quot;; she used many stones for Narayan&#x27;s office sets and went to Lohar Chawl to buy several additional properties. Roy said she had a good rapport with Aditya Chopra and that the film&#x27;s production gave her many challenges; &quot;Look, every day, I put up houses. The challenge is in &quot;individualising&quot;, in &quot;personalising&quot; each house to suit the script and the characters in the narrative.&quot; Roy designed 13 or 14 sets for the film.&lt;ref name=&quot;Rediff/Bharatan-Iyer&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; Filming ended between August and September 2000; it was edited by V. Karnik, and Anuj Mathur and Kunal Mehta were the film&#x27;s sound designers.

== Music ==

The duo Jatin–Lalit composed &quot;Mohabbatein&quot; soundtrack and the lyrics were written by Anand Bakshi. The vocals were performed by the debutantes Ishaan (for Shergill), Manohar Shetty (for Hansraj), Pritha Mazumdar (for Shetty), Shweta Pandit (for Sharma), Sonali Bhatawdekar (for Jhangiani), and Udhbhav (for Chopra). Lalit told &quot;Rediff.com&quot; he thought it was &quot;a good idea to have fresh voices for the newcomers so that it also helps the album sound fresh&quot;, and said he and Jatin experienced difficulty while suiting their voices. Lata Mangeshkar, Udit Narayan, and Jaspinder Narula supplied vocals for Rai, Khan and Puran Singh, respectively. 

The film&#x27;s soundtrack album has seven original songs and two background scores, and was released on 21 January 2000 by Saregama, which acquired the music rights for . Critical response to the soundtrack of &quot;Mohabbatein&quot; was mixed, but the album became the highest-selling Bollywood soundtrack of the year, with sales of over 5 million units. Jatin–Lalit received a nomination for the Best Music Director at the 46th Filmfare Awards, and were also nominated in the same category at the Bollywood Movie Awards, IIFA Awards and Screen Awards.

== Release ==
&quot;Mohabbatein&quot; was one of the most anticipated films of the year and the audience&#x27;s expectations were high. On 8 October 2000, a special screening for the film in Film City was organized with Aditya Chopra, Bachchan and his son Abhishek Bachchan, Shah Rukh Khan and his wife Gauri Khan, and Johar in attendance. The film was released theatrically on 27 October during the Diwali celebrations; its release clashed with those of Vidhu Vinod Chopra&#x27;s thriller &quot;Mission Kashmir&quot; and K. S. Ravikumar&#x27;s comedy-drama &quot;Thenali&quot;. Due to its lengthy running time, theatres screened three shows daily rather than four.

== Reception ==

=== Box office ===
&quot;Mohabbatein&quot; was opened on 315 screens across India and grossed on the first day. The film collected in India and $4.2 million overseas. Box Office India estimated the film&#x27;s total gross to be , making it the highest-grossing Indian film of the year. It ran at theatres for over 175 days, becoming a silver jubilee film. &quot;Mohabbatein&quot; was released on DVD in a double-disc pack on 20 November in all regions. The broadcast rights of the movie were acquired to Sony Network. It has been available for streaming on Amazon Prime Video and Apple TV+ since 18 November 2016.

=== Critical reception ===
&quot;Mohabbatein&quot; received widespread critical acclaim upon release, with Amitabh Bachchan and Shah Rukh Khan&#x27;s performances garnering the highest praise.

Savera R. Someshwar of &quot;Rediff.com&quot; commented the film &quot;is a mish-mash alright. But it is also a successful, feel-good film.&quot; She described both actors as &quot;the two pillars on which this film is built and each time they come face-to-face, there is this expectant hush.&quot; Taran Adarsh of &quot;Bollywood Hungama&quot; rated the film 4 stars out of 5, praising Aditya Chopra for handling the confrontation sequences between the two &quot;with aplomb&quot;. He added the director &quot;is at his best&quot;, saying, &quot;Not once do you feel that the writer in Chopra has tilted on any one side&quot;. Vinayak Chakravorty of the &quot;Hindustan Times&quot; concluded, &quot;Clearly, Aditya Chopra faces a downhill task this time around. Shorn of a solid script, bereft of impressive treatment and lacking any directorial credibility to hold his [...] mega dream [...] &quot;Mohabbatein&quot; is a veritable lesson to any budding filmmaker on how not to make a film&quot;. &quot;Zee Next&quot;&#x27;s Vinaya Hagde gave a scathing review of the film, calling it &quot;dumb&quot;, and saying Kher and Singh were &quot;totally wasted&quot;.

Reviewing &quot;Mohabbatein&quot; for &quot;The Hindu&quot;, Savitha Padmanabhan criticized the film&#x27;s duration and the way the confrontation sequences between Bachchan and Khan &quot;are always interrupted by the love stories of the teenyboppers&quot; but &quot;Filmfare&quot; anonymous reviewer appreciated them for &quot;[excelling] in their respective roles&quot;. Nikhat Kazmi called the film the &quot;inglorious uncertainties of cinema&quot; and Khalid Mohamed wrote, &quot;Back in the romantic mode, Aditya Chopra&#x27;s &quot;Mohabbatein&quot; is indeed like a rich, multi-layered, vibgyor cake. But frankly, only a few slices tickle the taste-buds.&quot; Suman Tarafdar from &quot;Filmfare&quot; said most of the cast members &quot;look so unconvinced about their roles and perform accordingly&quot;. &quot;Screen&quot; said Aditya Chopra&#x27;s &quot;untiring efforts are visible in every frame and his mastery over screenplay is evident throughout the first half&quot;. Comparing the film with &quot;Dilwale Dulhania Le Jayenge&quot; in his review for &quot;India Today&quot;, Dinesh Raheja said &quot;Mohabbatein&quot; &quot;has too many diverse strands and in a bid to avoid getting knotted up in them&quot;, and considered the story is &quot;disappointingly pat and oversimplified&quot;.

<text>Saint Brendan&#x27;s Island, also known as Saint Brendan&#x27;s Isle or San Borondon, is a phantom island or mythical island, supposedly situated in the North Atlantic somewhere west of Northern Africa. It is named after Saint Brendan of Clonfert. He and his followers are said to have discovered it while travelling across the ocean and evangelising its islands. It appeared on numerous maps in Christopher Columbus&#x27;s time, most notably Martin Behaim&#x27;s Erdapfel of 1492. It is known as &quot;La isla de San Borondón&quot; and &quot;isla de Samborombón&quot; in Spanish.

The first mention of the island was in the Latin text &quot;Navigatio Sancti Brendani Abbatis&quot; (&quot;Voyage of Saint Brendan the Abbot&quot;) of the ninth century, which inserted the island into Irish and European folklore.

==History==
===Middle Ages===
This island is named after Saint Brendan, who claimed to have landed on it in AD 512 with 14 monks, with whom he celebrated a Mass. The monastic party reported its stay as 15 days, while the ships that expected their return complained that they had to wait a year, during which period the island remained concealed behind a thick curtain of mist.

In his &quot;Navigatio Sancti Brendani Abbatis&quot;, the monk Barino mentioned having visited this same &quot;Paradise&quot; in the Atlantic, it being a thickly wooded, mountainous island where the sun never set and it was always day, where the flora were abundant, the trees bore rich fruit, the rivers ran with fresh water, and the birds sang sweetly in the trees.

In &quot;Planiferio de Ebstorf&quot; of 1234, Marcos Martinez referred to &quot;the lost island discovered by St Brendan[,] but nobody has found it since&quot;, and in &quot;Mapamundi de Hereford&quot; of 1275 the whole archipelago is described as &quot;The Isles of the Blessed and the Island of St Brendan&quot;.

===Early Modern Age===
The Portuguese writer Luís Perdigão recorded the interest of the King of Portugal after a sea captain informed Henry the Navigator (1394–1460) that he had found the island but was driven off by tumultuous sea conditions. Henry ordered him back: he sailed off but never returned. Christopher Columbus is said to have believed in its existence.

In 1520, members of Ferdinand Magellan&#x27;s expedition are thought to have named Samborombón Bay on the coast of Argentina after Saint Brendan&#x27;s Isle, attributing the bay&#x27;s nearly semicircular shape to the detachment of the wandering island from the South American mainland.

In 1566, Hernán Pérez de Grado, First Regent of the Royal Canary Islands Court, ordered the justices at La Palma, El Hierro and La Gomera to investigate the phenomenon. In his history, Abreu y Galindo reports a conversation with a French adventurer claiming to have visited San Borondon, departing thence when a storm set in and making the voyage to La Palma for shelter within a day. In another report, Alonso de Espinosa, governor of El Hierro, described sighting San Borondon island northwest of El Hierro and &quot;leeward&quot; of La Palma. He listed 100 witnesses to the apparition.

Juan de Abréu Galindo reported in &quot;Historia de la Conquista de las siete Islas Canarias&quot; that &quot;the island of Saint Brendan (San Borondon), which is the eighth and last, whose existence may be inferred from sightings of its apparitions, seems to be located at 20 degrees 30 minutes of latitude and eight leagues [40 kilometres] due west of La Gomera.&quot; (The longitude given in the coordinates is based on the old measurement before the introduction of the Greenwich meridian).

===Modern Age===
In 1719, the Scottish monk Sigbert de Gembloux reported seeing the island, as did Don Matea Dacesta, mayor of Valverde, El Hierro in 1721. As a result of these sightings, that same year Juan de Mur y Aguerre, military governor of the Canary Islands, appointed a new commission of inquiry under Gaspar Dominguez, a sea captain; no fresh evidence was uncovered and subsequently interest waned. According to the Canary historian Ramirez, in 1723 a priest performed the rite of exorcism towards the island during one of its apparitions behind a low cloud. This was witnessed by a large number of persons and sworn to on affidavit.

In 1759, a Franciscan friar mentioned (but not identified by name) by Viera y Clavijo wrote to a friend: &quot;I was most desirous to see the island of San Borondon and, finding myself in Alexero, La Palma, on 3 May at six of the morning, I saw, and can swear to it on oath, that while having in plain view at the same time the island of El Hierro, I saw another island of the same colour and appearance, and I made out through a telescope, much-wooded terrain in its central area. Then I sent for the priest Antonio Jose Manrique, who had seen it twice previously, and upon arrival he saw only a portion of it, for when he was watching, a cloud obscured the mountain. It was subsequently visible for another 90 minutes. being seen by about forty spectators, but in the afternoon when we returned to the same point we could see nothing on account of the heavy rain.&quot;

In his &quot;Noticias&quot;, Vol I, 1772, chronicler Viera y Clavijo wrote: &quot;A few years ago while returning from the Americas, the captain of a ship of the Canary Fleet believed he saw La Palma appear and, having set his course for Tenerife based on his sighting, was astonished to find the real La Palma materialize in the distance next morning.&quot; Viera adds that a similar entry is made in the diaries of Colonel don Roberto de Rivas, who made the observation that his ship &quot;having been close to the island of La Palma in the afternoon, and not arriving there until late the next day&quot;, the officer was forced to conclude that &quot;the wind and current must have been extraordinarily unfavourable during the night.&quot;

Further expeditions were organised in the search for the island, but from the 19th century onwards, reported sightings of San Borondon became less frequent.

<text>Paul Ereng (born 22 August 1966) is a former Kenyan athlete, and the surprise winner of the 800 metres at the 1988 Summer Olympics.

Born in Kitale, Trans-Nzoia, Kenya, Paul Ereng attended Starehe Boys Centre and School in Nairobi, Kenya. He was a promising 400 m runner until the end of 1987. After enrolling at the University of Virginia, Ereng took up the 800 m in early 1988.

==Running career==
Ereng was undefeated during the United States outdoor season in early 1988. While running for UVA, he won the NCAA 800 meter title in 1988 and 1989. But in the Kenyan Olympic trials, Ereng barely qualified for the Olympic team, finishing third. Despite his rapid development, Ereng wasn&#x27;t seen as a potential gold medalist when he arrived at the Olympic Games in Seoul. However, people started to rate his chances more seriously after he won his semi-final in a personal best of 1:44.55.

In the Olympic final, Ereng was in eighth place out of eight runners (last) for most of the first half of the race, and in seventh place with only 300 meters to go. He was fourth as they entered the straight, but he then surged past the three runners in front of him, which included two former Olympic gold medalists, 1984 5000 meter champion Said Aouita and 1984 800 meter champion Joaquim Cruz, to win the gold medal. Ereng&#x27;s surge to the line and victory was mistakenly called on live television in the United States as a victory for his Kenyan teammate Nixon Kiprotich by announcers Charlie Jones (sportscaster) and Frank Shorter, as Ereng had passed a fading Kiprotich, who had briefly led the race with 200 meters remaining, and the announcers had confused the two. Ereng has privately revealed to fans that Jones and Shorter both spoke to him later to offer apologies and that he had no hard feelings towards them for their error. Kiprotich himself also persevered and won a silver medal in the 800 meters in the 1992 Olympics held in Barcelona.

After the Olympics, Ereng returned home to Kenya to a hero&#x27;s welcome, the highlight of which was receiving, in a time-honoured tradition, his gold medal was once more presented to him during evening assembly at his former school, Starehe, by the late Dr. Geoffrey William Griffin. At the World Indoor Championships in Budapest the following year, Ereng produced a devastating finish to win the gold medal in a new world indoor record of 1:44.84.

In 1991, Ereng retained his world indoor title at Seville, but was only fourth in the World Championships at Tokyo. Ereng never posed a serious threat in major international championships after that, and he was eliminated in the semi-finals at the 1992 Olympic Games. Paul Ereng ended his career in 1993 from an injury to the Achilles heel.

==Later career==
Ereng graduated from Virginia in 1993 with a bachelor&#x27;s degree in religious studies with a minor in sociology. His wife, Fatima, is a former sales executive of the Nation Media Group. He subsequently took up a job as head cross country coach in the University of Texas at El Paso, the first Kenyan to take such a coaching job.

<text>Popalzai or Popalzay (), also known as Popal, are Durrani (formerly called Abdali or Bor Tareen) Pashtuns of Afghanistan. The Popalzai are part of the Zirak confederation of Pashtun tribes. The origin of the Abdali forefathers of the Sadozai tribe is probably the Hephthalites. The forefathers of Ahmad Shāh Durrānī, the founder of the Durrani Empire, were from the Sadozai tribe which is a subtribe of the Popalzai. According to Mohan Lal, the Zirak line begins with Sulaiman Zirak Khan, who was the father of Popalzai, Barakzai, and Alakozai. The tribe&#x27;s origin is Kandahar, Afghanistan.
The majority of the Popalzai live in the southern areas of Afghanistan such as in Kandahar, Helmand or Uruzgan. Some members of the Popalzai tribe have migrated with their families to the European Union, North America, and Oceania. Notable members of the Popalzai tribe include Hamid Karzai and his extended family, Karim Popal, Naim Popal, and Khalida Popal.

<text>Sea Hunt is an American action adventure television series that aired in syndication from 1958 to 1961 and was popular for decades afterwards. The series originally aired for four seasons, with 155 episodes produced. It stars Lloyd Bridges as former Navy diver Mike Nelson, and was produced by Ivan Tors.

==Development==
Series executive producer Ivan Tors conceived the idea for &quot;Sea Hunt&quot; while working on the 1958 film &quot;Underwater Warrior&quot;. He tried in vain to sell the series to all three major networks, but each network passed on it because they felt that a series set underwater could not be sustained. Tors then decided to sell it into the first-run syndication market. He teamed up with Ziv Television Programs and was able to sell it to more than 100 syndicated markets before it debuted in January 1958.

Lloyd Bridges was cast as lead character Mike Nelson. &quot;Sea Hunt&quot; was intended as a comeback vehicle for Bridges due to his brief black-listing from acting. He was restricted from mainstream Hollywood roles after admitting to the House Un-American Activities Committee that he had been a member of the Actors&#x27; Laboratory Theatre, a group that was tied to the Communist Party.

Bridges served in the United States Coast Guard during the second World War and afterwards joined the Coast Guard reserve, so was already familiar with oceangoing ships. He took a crash course in scuba diving by Zale Parry and Courtney Brown, and Brown served as his underwater stunt double. Bridges was also educated in the art of scuba equipment by Brad Pinkernell on the beach in Southern California from 1956 to 1957 after a chance meeting when Pinkernell was coming out of the ocean while wearing scuba gear. Over the course of the show&#x27;s run, Bridges got more involved in the underwater stunt work, graduating from close-ups in the earliest episodes to doing all but the most dangerous stunts by the end of the series&#x27; run.

==Synopsis==
Mike Nelson (Lloyd Bridges) is a free-lance scuba diver, a former Navy frogman, who left the service about four years before the series begins, and member of the United States Coast Guard Auxiliary. He is a well-known expert on diving who is often called on for difficult or dangerous projects. He travels on his boat the &quot;Argonaut&quot; and outmaneuvers villains, salvages everything from a bicycle to a nuclear missile, rescues children trapped in a flooded cave, and other such adventures. In the pilot episode, he rescues a Navy pilot from his sunken jet. No dialogue was possible during the underwater sequences, so Bridges provided voice-over narration for all the installments. Nelson also educated non-diving characters in various aspects of diving and the underwater world.

The series made frequent references to Marineland of the Pacific, which provided facilities, resources, and technical advice to the production company. At the end of each episode, Bridges appeared as himself to deliver a brief comment. These comments sometimes included a plea to viewers to understand and protect the marine environment, along with gems of wisdom from Bridges&#x27; own experiences. A number of notable actors appeared on the series early in their career, including Leonard Nimoy, Bruce Dern, Robert Conrad, Ross Martin, Robert Clarke, Larry Hagman, Larry Pennell, Ken Curtis, William Boyett, Jack Nicholson, and Bridges&#x27; own sons Beau and Jeff.

==Production notes==
Underwater sequences were often created during post-production from individual scenes shot at many different locations, including studio tanks and various underwater sites in California, Florida, and the Bahamas. Much stock footage was shot and later mixed with episode-specific character footage. Filming locations included:
* Marineland of the Pacific (Park operated 1954–1987)
* the front side of Santa Catalina Island, California
* Paradise Cove west of Malibu
* Silver Springs, Florida
* Cypress Gardens, Florida
* Tarpon Springs, Florida
* Nassau, Bahamas
* Grand Bahama Island
On-land location shots were filmed throughout Los Angeles, central Florida, Nassau, and on a sound stage. Famous divers such as Zale Parry and Albert Tillman were involved in production of the show, as was Jon Lindbergh, son of aviator Charles Lindbergh. Parry was joined in 1960 by 18 year-old Wende Wagner as a female underwater stunt double. Pioneering underwater cinematographer Lamar Boren shot nearly all of the underwater footage for the series. John Lamb shot the underwater sequences for both the movie and TV versions of Irwin Allen&#x27;s &quot;Voyage to the Bottom of the Sea&quot;, and also filmed some episodes of &quot;Sea Hunt&quot;. Stunt diver Ricou Browning is credited with coordination of the underwater action sequences during the second season.

The boat used in the series was named the &quot;Argonaut&quot; after the mythological Greek heroes who sailed with Jason on the quest of the Golden Fleece. Several cabin cruisers were utilized in filming, and one notable model was the &quot;Trojan Express&quot;, custom built by Trojan Yachts in 1960 with mahogany planking and teak decks and trim, measuring 33 feet long and 12 feet wide. Diving equipment was supplied by Voit and a Navy depth gauge supplied by Sportsways, Inc. Wetsuits were made by the small Los Angeles shop &quot;Dive N&#x27; Surf&quot;, which was the genesis for Body Glove.

David Rose is credited with music, although a number of the &quot;Sea Hunt&quot; stock cues are heard in &quot;Buchanan Rides Alone&quot;, a 1958 Columbia western film that used stock music from composers including Mischa Bakaleinikoff, George Duning, Heinz Roemheld, and Paul Sawtell.

==Reception==
&quot;Sea Hunt&quot; proved to be popular with viewers and was a hit throughout its four-season run. It became one of the best remembered and most watched syndicated series in the United States. During the first nine months of its debut, it was number one in the ratings. The show attracted half of the viewing audience in 50 major cities and averaged 59 percent of audiences in New York City. Producer Ivan Tors later estimated that 40 million people viewed the series weekly.

According to &quot;New York Times&quot; writer Richard Severo, &quot;Late-night comedians, especially Johnny Carson, used to tell jokes derived from the frequency with which Mr. Bridges, always fit and trim and looking forever like a slightly aging quarterback, was seen daring the fates underwater or emerging from the sea unscathed despite sharks, shipwrecks and assorted malefactors&quot;. Severo noted that &quot;TV Guide&quot; once described the show as &quot;an epic so watery that Lloyd Bridges&#x27;s colleagues tell him they have to drain their TV sets after watching his show&quot;.

Sport Diver Magazine wrote that &quot;Sea Hunt&quot; has had a &quot;lasting impact&quot; on the hobby of scuba diving, and cited a yearly event held in Florida called &quot;Sea Hunt Forever&quot; where divers don vintage gear and re-enact scenes from the TV series.

==Cancellation==
Despite its solid ratings, &quot;Sea Hunt&quot; was canceled in 1961 due to the dwindling first-run syndication market. The series ran for a total of 155 episodes.

==Syndication==
&quot;Sea Hunt&quot; went into reruns in 1961, and has aired on various channels since. The series currently airs on weekdays on This TV and Light TV, two classic television and movie networks carried on digital subchannels of local stations around the US.

==1987 revival series==
A revival series starring Ron Ely and Kimber Sissons appeared in syndication in 1987. Ely had starred in a companion undersea adventure series called &quot;The Aquanauts&quot; during the run of the original series. For budgetary reasons, land scenes from this second series were filmed in Canada (specifically Victoria, British Columbia), despite the stories being set in Florida. Underwater scenes were filmed in tropical locations.

The updated version of &quot;Sea Hunt&quot; was canceled after only one season.

===1987 revival series episode list===
==Merchandising==
Due to the show&#x27;s popularity, Dell Comics released a series of &quot;Sea Hunt&quot; comic books. Series star Lloyd Bridges also endorsed swim equipment by Voit.

==Home media==
TGG Direct released all 4 seasons on DVD in Region 1 on January 29, 2013.

==50th anniversary==
The Underwater Videographer Podcast presented a &quot;Sea Hunt&quot; 50th Anniversary podcast in December 2007. Appearing on the podcast were author Eric Hanauer, who interviewed Lloyd Bridges shortly before he died, actress Susan Silo, who guest starred in the &quot;Cougar&quot; episode, and Jeff Bridges, who shared memories of his father and &quot;Sea Hunt&quot;.

<text>Key Hill Cemetery (OS grid reference SP059882), originally called Birmingham General Cemetery, is a cemetery in Hockley (the Jewellery Quarter), Birmingham, England. It opened in 1836 as a nondenominational cemetery (in practice nonconformist), and is the oldest cemetery, not being in a churchyard, in Birmingham. The principal entrance is on Icknield Street to the west, with a secondary entrance on Key Hill to the north. The cemetery contains the graves of many prominent members of Birmingham society in the late 19th century, to the extent that in 1915 E. H. Manning felt able to dub it &quot;the Westminster Abbey of the Midlands&quot;.

It is the older of two cemeteries in Hockley, the other being Warstone Lane Cemetery, opened in 1847, which was originally reserved for members of the established Church of England.

The cemetery is no longer available for new burials.

==History and description==
The cemetery was originally laid out for the Birmingham General Cemetery Company by local architect Charles Edge (d.1867). It opened on 23 May 1836.

Many of its fittings and memorials are of architectural and artistic merit. The railings and entrance gates with imposing piers (all by Edge) are Grade II listed. The Greek Doric chapel, also by Edge, has been demolished. The cemetery is itself listed Grade II* on the Register of Parks and Gardens of Special Historic Interest. A campaign group, the Friends of Key Hill &amp; Warstone Lane Cemeteries, lobbies to have the cemetery restored. The entrance piers and gates on both Icknield Street and Key Hill have been restored in recent years.

<doc id="815967" wikidata="Q599090" url="?curid=815967" title="Church of the Province of West Africa">
<text>The Church of the Province of West Africa is a province of the Anglican Communion, covering 17 dioceses in eight countries of West Africa, specifically in Cameroon, Cape Verde, Gambia, Ghana, Guinea, Liberia, Senegal and Sierra Leone. Ghana is the country with most dioceses, now numbering 11.

Church of Senegal Anglican Communion was established by the Church of Nigeria. The Church is well known for her evangelical lifestyle and commitment towards the mission mandate &quot;Seeking the lost and strengthening the faith of all believer.

The Reverend, Bennett Chinonso Agazue is currently the mission Director at Church of Senegal Anglican Communion Dakar.

==History==
Missionary work began in Ghana in 1752. The Church of the Province of West Africa was established in 1951 by the bishops of five West African dioceses (Accra, Lagos, Niger, Sierra Leone and the Diocese of Gambia and Guinea) with the consent of the Archbishop of Canterbury. In 1977 they were joined by the Diocese of Liberia. In February 1979, the new Church of Nigeria was inaugurated as a separate province. In 1981 Sierra Leone was divided into the Diocese of Freetown and the new missionary Diocese of Bo and four new Ghanaian dioceses of Cape Coast, Koforidua, Sekondi and Sunyani/Tamale were formed. In 1985 the Gambia and Guinea diocese was partitioned into English-speaking Gambia and French-speaking Guinea. The Diocese of Asante Mampong, previously a suffragan see to Kumasi, was inaugurated in November 2014.

The final total of 17 represents 11 dioceses in Ghana and 6 in the other seven nations. For this reason actions are in hand to move towards making Ghana a separate province. The country already has the status of an &quot;internal province&quot;, the archbishop of which was until 2019 the Primate of the whole Province of West Africa.

Today, the church has to survive in areas of civil unrest where Christians remain a small minority.

==Doctrine and practice==

The center of the Church of the Province of West Africa&#x27;s teaching is the life and resurrection of Jesus Christ. The basic teachings of the church, or catechism, includes:
*Jesus Christ is fully human and fully God. He died and was resurrected from the dead.
*Jesus provides the way of eternal life for those who believe.
*The Old and New Testaments of the Bible were written by people &quot;under the inspiration of the Holy Spirit&quot;. The Apocrypha are additional books that are used in Christian worship, but not for the formation of doctrine.
*The two great and necessary sacraments are Holy Baptism and Holy Eucharist
*Other sacramental rites are confirmation, ordination, marriage, reconciliation of a penitent, and unction.
*Belief in heaven, hell, and Jesus&#x27;s return in glory.

The threefold sources of authority in Anglicanism are scripture, tradition, and reason. These three sources uphold and critique each other in a dynamic way. This balance of scripture, tradition and reason is traced to the work of Richard Hooker, a sixteenth-century apologist. In Hooker&#x27;s model, scripture is the primary means of arriving at doctrine and things stated plainly in scripture are accepted as true. Issues that are ambiguous are determined by tradition, which is checked by reason.

==Ordination of women==
At its 20th Provincial Synod in 2000, the Province approved in principle the ordination of women to the priesthood. There is currently a variety of practice from diocese to diocese, with some remaining closed to the ordination of women as priests, and others welcoming the practice. The province does not permit the ordination of women to the episcopate.

==Ecumenical relations==
Like many other Anglican churches, the Church of the Province of West Africa is a member of the ecumenical World Council of Churches.

==Anglican realignment==
The Church of the Province of West Africa was one of the first Anglican provinces to break communion with the Episcopal Church of the United States over the question of allowing the blessing of same-sex unions and non-celibate homosexual clergy. However, the Episcopal Diocese of Liberia continues to maintain full communion and a covenant relationship with The Episcopal Church. The Church of the Province of West Africa has been active in the Anglican realignment as a member of the Global South and the Global Anglican Future Conference. Archbishop Justice Akrofi was a founding Primate of GAFCON in 2008. Archbishop Solomon Tilewa Johnson attended Global Anglican Future Conference (GAFCON II), that took place in Nairobi, Kenya, from 21 to 26 October 2013. Unlike his predecessors, Archbishop Daniel Sarfo was seen as a supporter of &quot;reconciliation&quot; between the conservative and liberal provinces of the Anglican Communion, particularly the Episcopal Church and Anglican Church of Canada, and was involved in several meetings between African and North American bishops. He didn&#x27;t attended any GAFCON meetings. He still was one of the 11 Primates that attended the 3rd Provincial Assembly of the Anglican Church in North America, in June 2017. He also attended the Global South meeting, in 8–9 September 2017, in Cairo, Egypt, and was one of the signants of their communiqué, with nine other Anglican Primates, including Foley Beach, from the Anglican Church in North America.

The province was represented at GAFCON III, held in Jerusalem, on 17–22 June 2018, by a 13 members delegation, coming from Ghana, Gambia, Guinea and Sierra Leone.

The GAFCON Primates Council announced at their Communiqué, on 6 May 2019, that the Diocese of Sunyani would be developing the official branch of the movement in Ghana, under the leadership of the Bishop Festus Yeboah Asuamah.

Archbishop Jonathan Hart attended the 7th Global South Conference, held in Cairo, Egypt, on 11–12 October 2019. Archbishop Hart opposes the legalisation of same-sex marriage and opposes the blessing of same-sex relationships in churches.

In 2021, the Anglican province received public media attention as well as scrutiny from within the Anglican Communion due the Diocese of Ghana&#x27;s endorsement of legislation to criminalise LGBTQ advocacy and to increase penalties for same-sex relationships; homosexual sexual relationships are already illegal in Ghana. Archbishop Justin Welby of the Church of England, whose office is one of the instruments of unity within the Anglican Communion, issued a statement rebuking the bishops in Ghana and reiterated his support for LGBTQ civil rights. The Church of England&#x27;s Archbishop of York, Stephen Cottrell, and Bishop of London, Sarah Mullally, also issued statements denouncing the anti-LGBTQ actions of the Ghanaian bishops.

<text>In structural engineering, buckling is the sudden change in shape (deformation) of a structural component under load, such as the bowing of a column under compression or the wrinkling of a plate under shear. If a structure is subjected to a gradually increasing load, when the load reaches a critical level, a member may suddenly change shape and the structure and component is said to have &quot;buckled&quot;. Euler&#x27;s critical load and Johnson&#x27;s parabolic formula are used to determine the buckling stress of a column.
Buckling may occur even though the stresses that develop in the structure are well below those needed to cause failure in the material of which the structure is composed. Further loading may cause significant and somewhat unpredictable deformations, possibly leading to complete loss of the member&#x27;s load-carrying capacity. However, if the deformations that occur after buckling do not cause the complete collapse of that member, the member will continue to support the load that caused it to buckle. If the buckled member is part of a larger assemblage of components such as a building, any load applied to the buckled part of the structure beyond that which caused the member to buckle will be redistributed within the structure. Some aircraft are designed for thin skin panels to continue carrying load even in the buckled state.

== Forms of buckling ==
=== Columns ===
The ratio of the effective length of a column to the least radius of gyration of its cross section is called the slenderness ratio (sometimes expressed with the Greek letter lambda, λ). This ratio affords a means of classifying columns and their failure mode. The slenderness ratio is important for design considerations. All the following are approximate values used for convenience.

If the load on a column is applied through the center of gravity (centroid) of its cross section, it is called an axial load. A load at any other point in the cross section is known as an eccentric load. A short column under the action of an axial load will fail by direct compression before it buckles, but a long column loaded in the same manner will fail by springing suddenly outward laterally (buckling) in a bending mode. The buckling mode of deflection is considered a failure mode, and it generally occurs before the axial compression stresses (direct compression) can cause failure of the material by yielding or fracture of that compression member. However, intermediate-length columns will fail by a combination of direct compressive stress and bending.

In particular:
* A short steel column is one whose slenderness ratio does not exceed 50; an intermediate length steel column has a slenderness ratio ranging from about 50 to 200, and its behavior is dominated by the strength limit of the material, while a long steel column may be assumed to have a slenderness ratio greater than 200 and its behavior is dominated by the modulus of elasticity of the material.
* A short concrete column is one having a ratio of unsupported length to least dimension of the cross section equal to or less than 10. If the ratio is greater than 10, it is considered a long column (sometimes referred to as a slender column).
* Timber columns may be classified as short columns if the ratio of the length to least dimension of the cross section is equal to or less than 10. The dividing line between intermediate and long timber columns cannot be readily evaluated. One way of defining the lower limit of long timber columns would be to set it as the smallest value of the ratio of length to least cross sectional area that would just exceed a certain constant K of the material. Since K depends on the modulus of elasticity and the allowable compressive stress parallel to the grain, it can be seen that this arbitrary limit would vary with the species of the timber. The value of K is given in most structural handbooks.

The theory of the behavior of columns was investigated in 1757 by mathematician Leonhard Euler. He derived the formula, termed Euler&#x27;s critical load, that gives the maximum axial load that a long, slender, ideal column can carry without buckling. An ideal column is one that is:

* perfectly straight
* made of a homogeneous material
* free from initial stress. 

When the applied load reaches the Euler load, sometimes called the critical load, the column comes to be in a state of unstable equilibrium. At that load, the introduction of the slightest lateral force will cause the column to fail by suddenly &quot;jumping&quot; to a new configuration, and the column is said to have buckled. This is what happens when a person stands on an empty aluminum can and then taps the sides briefly, causing it to then become instantly crushed (the vertical sides of the can may be understood as an infinite series of extremely thin columns). The formula derived by Euler for long slender columns is

formula_1

where
* formula_2, maximum or critical force (vertical load on column),
* formula_3, modulus of elasticity,
* formula_4, smallest area moment of inertia (second moment of area) of the cross section of the column,
* formula_5, unsupported length of column,
* formula_6, column effective length factor, whose value depends on the conditions of end support of the column, as follows.
** For both ends pinned (hinged, free to rotate), formula_7.
** For both ends fixed, formula_8.
** For one end fixed and the other end pinned, formula_9.
** For one end fixed and the other end free to move laterally, formula_10.
* formula_11 is the effective length of the column.

Examination of this formula reveals the following facts with regard to the load-bearing ability of slender columns.
* The elasticity of the material of the column and not the compressive strength of the material of the column determines the column&#x27;s buckling load.
* The buckling load is directly proportional to the second moment of area of the cross section.
* The boundary conditions have a considerable effect on the critical load of slender columns. The boundary conditions determine the mode of bending of the column and the distance between inflection points on the displacement curve of the deflected column. The inflection points in the deflection shape of the column are the points at which the curvature of the column changes sign and are also the points at which the column&#x27;s internal bending moments of the column are zero. The closer the inflection points are, the greater the resulting axial load capacity (bucking load) of the column.

A conclusion from the above is that the buckling load of a column may be increased by changing its material to one with a higher modulus of elasticity (E), or changing the design of the column&#x27;s cross section so as to increase its moment of inertia. The latter can be done without increasing the weight of the column by distributing the material as far from the principal axis of the column&#x27;s cross section as possible. For most purposes, the most effective use of the material of a column is that of a tubular section.

Another insight that may be gleaned from this equation is the effect of length on critical load. Doubling the unsupported length of the column quarters the allowable load. The restraint offered by the end connections of a column also affects its critical load. If the connections are perfectly rigid (not allowing rotation of its ends), the critical load will be four times that for a similar column where the ends are pinned (allowing rotation of its ends).

Since the radius of gyration is defined as the square root of the ratio of the column&#x27;s moment of inertia about an axis to its cross sectional area, the above Euler formula may be reformatted by substituting the radius of gyration formula_12 for formula_4:

formula_14

where formula_15 is the stress that causes buckling in the column, and formula_16 is the slenderness ratio.

Since structural columns are commonly of intermediate length, the Euler formula has little practical application for ordinary design. Issues that cause deviation from the pure Euler column behaviour include imperfections in geometry of the column in combination with plasticity/non-linear stress strain behaviour of the column&#x27;s material. Consequently, a number of empirical column formulae have been developed that agree with test data, all of which embody the slenderness ratio. Due to the uncertainty in the behavior of columns, for design, appropriate safety factors are introduced into these formulae. One such formula is the Perry Robertson formula which estimates the critical buckling load based on an assumed small initial curvature, hence an eccentricity of the axial load. The Rankine Gordon formula, named for William John Macquorn Rankine and Perry Hugesworth Gordon (1899 – 1966), is also based on experimental results and suggests that a column will buckle at a load &quot;F&quot;max given by:
formula_17

where formula_18 is the Euler maximum load and formula_2 is the maximum compressive load. This formula typically produces a conservative estimate of formula_20.

==== Self-buckling ====
A free-standing, vertical column, with density formula_21, Young&#x27;s modulus formula_3, and cross-sectional area formula_23, will buckle under its own weight if its height exceeds a certain critical value:

formula_24

where formula_25 is the acceleration due to gravity, formula_4 is the second moment of area of the beam cross section, and formula_27 is the first zero of the Bessel function of the first kind of order −1/3, which is equal to 1.86635086...

=== Plate buckling ===
A plate is a 3-dimensional structure defined as having a width of comparable size to its length, with a thickness that is very small in comparison to its other two dimensions. Similar to columns, thin plates experience out-of-plane buckling deformations when subjected to critical loads; however, contrasted to column buckling, plates under buckling loads can continue to carry loads, called local buckling. This phenomenon is incredibly useful in numerous systems, as it allows systems to be engineered to provide greater loading capacities.

For a rectangular plate, supported along every edge, loaded with a uniform compressive force per unit length, the derived governing equation can be stated by:

formula_28

where
* formula_29, out-of-plane deflection
* formula_30, uniformly distributed compressive load
* formula_31, Poisson&#x27;s ratio
* formula_3, modulus of elasticity
* formula_33, thickness

The solution to the deflection can be expanded into two harmonic functions shown:

formula_34

where 
* formula_35, number of half sine curvatures that occur lengthwise
* formula_36, number of half sine curvatures that occur widthwise
* formula_37, length of specimen
* formula_38, width of specimen

The previous equation can be substituted into the earlier differential equation where formula_36 equals 1. formula_40 can be separated providing the equation for the critical compressive loading of a plate:

formula_41

where the buckling coefficient formula_42, is given by:
formula_43

The buckling coefficient is influenced by the aspect of the specimen, formula_37 / formula_45, and the number of lengthwise curvatures. For an increasing number of such curvatures, the aspect ratio produces a varying buckling coefficient; but each relation provides a minimum value for each formula_35. This minimum value can then be used as a constant, independent from both the aspect ratio and formula_35.

Given stress is found by the load per unit area, the following expression is found for the critical stress:
formula_48

From the derived equations, it can be seen the close similarities between the critical stress for a column and for a plate. As the width formula_38 shrinks, the plate acts more like a column as it increases the resistance to buckling along the plate&#x27;s width. The increase of formula_37 allows for an increase of the number of sine waves produced by buckling along the length, but also increases the resistance from the buckling along the width. This creates the preference of the plate to buckle in such a way to equal the number of curvatures both along the width and length. Due to boundary conditions, when a plate is loaded with a critical stress and buckles, the edges perpendicular to the load cannot deform out-of-plane and will therefore continue to carry the stresses. This creates a non-uniform compressive loading along the ends, where the stresses are imposed on half of the effective width on either side of the specimen, given by the following:

formula_51

where
* formula_52, effective width
* formula_53, yielding stress

As the loaded stress increases, the effective width continues to shrink; if the stresses on the ends ever reach the yield stress, the plate will fail. This is what allows the buckled structure to continue supporting loadings. When the axial load over the critical load is plotted against the displacement, the fundamental path is shown. It demonstrates the plate&#x27;s similarity to a column under buckling; however, past the buckling load, the fundamental path bifurcates into a secondary path that curves upward, providing the ability to be subjected to higher loads past the critical load.

=== Flexural-torsional buckling ===
Flexural-torsional buckling can be described as a combination of bending and twisting response of a member in compression. Such a deflection mode must be considered for design purposes. This mostly occurs in columns with &quot;open&quot; cross-sections and hence have a low torsional stiffness, such as channels, structural tees, double-angle shapes, and equal-leg single angles. Circular cross sections do not experience such a mode of buckling.

=== Lateral-torsional buckling ===

When a simply supported beam is loaded in bending, the top side is in compression, and the bottom side is in tension. If the beam is not supported in the lateral direction (i.e., perpendicular to the plane of bending), and the flexural load increases to a critical limit, the beam will experience a lateral deflection of the compression flange as it buckles locally. The lateral deflection of the compression flange is restrained by the beam web and tension flange, but for an open section the twisting mode is more flexible, hence the beam both twists and deflects laterally in a failure mode known as &quot;lateral-torsional buckling&quot;. In wide-flange sections (with high lateral bending stiffness), the deflection mode will be mostly twisting in torsion. In narrow-flange sections, the bending stiffness is lower and the column&#x27;s deflection will be closer to that of lateral bucking deflection mode.

The use of closed sections such as square hollow section will mitigate the effects of lateral-torsional buckling by virtue of their high torsional stiffness.

&quot;C&quot;&quot;b&quot; is a modification factor used in the equation for nominal flexural strength when determining lateral-torsional buckling. The reason for this factor is to allow for non-uniform moment diagrams when the ends of a beam segment are braced. The conservative value for &quot;C&quot;&quot;b&quot; can be taken as 1, regardless of beam configuration or loading, but in some cases it may be excessively conservative. &quot;C&quot;&quot;b&quot; is always equal to or greater than 1, never less. For cantilevers or overhangs where the free end is unbraced, Cb is equal to 1. Tables of values of &quot;C&quot;&quot;b&quot; for simply supported beams exist.

If an appropriate value of &quot;C&quot;&quot;b&quot; is not given in tables, it can be obtained via the following formula:

formula_54

where
* formula_55, absolute value of maximum moment in the unbraced segment,
* formula_56, absolute value of maximum moment at quarter point of the unbraced segment,
* formula_57, absolute value of maximum moment at centerline of the unbraced segment, 
* formula_58, absolute value of maximum moment at three-quarter point of the unbraced segment,

The result is the same for all unit systems.

=== Plastic buckling ===
The buckling strength of a member is less than the elastic buckling strength of a structure if the material of the member is stressed beyond the elastic material range and into the non-linear (plastic) material behavior range. When the compression load is near the buckling load, the structure will bend significantly and the material of the column will diverge from a linear stress-strain behavior. The stress-strain behavior of materials is not strictly linear even below the yield point, hence the modulus of elasticity decreases as stress increases, and significantly so as the stresses approach the material&#x27;s yield strength. This reduced material rigidity reduces the buckling strength of the structure and results in a buckling load less than that predicted by the assumption of linear elastic behavior.

A more accurate approximation of the buckling load can be had by the use of the tangent modulus of elasticity, Et, which is less than the elastic modulus, in place of the elastic modulus of elasticity. The tangent is equal to the elastic modulus and then decreases beyond the proportional limit. The tangent modulus is a line drawn tangent to the stress-strain curve at a particular value of strain (in the elastic section of the stress-strain curve, the tangent modulus is equal to the elastic modulus). Plots of the tangent modulus of elasticity for a variety of materials are available in standard references.

=== Crippling ===
Sections that are made up of flanged plates such as a channel, can still carry load in the corners after the flanges have locally buckled. Crippling is failure of the complete section.

=== Diagonal tension ===
Because of the thin skins typically used in aerospace applications, skins may buckle at low load levels. However, once buckled, instead of being able to transmit shear forces, they are still able to carry load through &quot;diagonal tension&quot; (DT) stresses in the web. This results in a non-linear behaviour in the load carrying behaviour of these details. The ratio of the actual load to the load at which buckling occurs is known as the &quot;buckling ratio&quot; of a sheet. High buckling ratios may lead to excessive wrinkling of the sheets which may then fail through yielding of the wrinkles. Although they may buckle, thin sheets are designed to not permanently deform and return to an unbuckled state when the applied loading is removed. Repeated buckling may lead to fatigue failures.

Sheets under diagonal tension are supported by stiffeners that as a result of sheet buckling carry a distributed load along their length, and may in turn result in these structural members failing under buckling.

Thicker plates may only partially form a diagonal tension field and may continue to carry some of the load through shear. This is known as &quot;incomplete diagonal tension&quot; (IDT). This behavior was studied by Wagner and these beams are sometimes known as Wagner beams.

Diagonal tension may also result in a pulling force on any fasteners such as rivets that are used to fasten the web to the supporting members. Fasteners and sheets must be designed to resist being pulled off their supports.

=== Dynamic buckling ===
If a column is loaded suddenly and then the load released, the column can sustain a much higher load than its static (slowly applied) buckling load. This can happen in a long, unsupported column used as a drop hammer. The duration of compression at the impact end is the time required for a stress wave to travel along the column to the other (free) end and back down as a relief wave. Maximum buckling occurs near the impact end at a wavelength much shorter than the length of the rod, and at a stress many times the buckling stress of a statically loaded column. The critical condition for buckling amplitude to remain less than about 25 times the effective rod straightness imperfection at the buckle wavelength is

formula_59

where formula_60 is the impact stress, formula_5 is the length of the rod, formula_62 is the elastic wave speed, and formula_63 is the smaller lateral dimension of a rectangular rod. Because the buckle wavelength depends only on formula_60 and formula_63, this same formula holds for thin cylindrical shells of thickness formula_63.

== Theory ==
=== Energy method ===
Often it is very difficult to determine the exact buckling load in complex structures using the Euler formula, due to the difficulty in determining the constant K. Therefore, maximum buckling load is often approximated using energy conservation and referred to as an energy method in structural analysis.

The first step in this method is to assume a displacement mode and a function that represents that displacement. This function must satisfy the most important boundary conditions, such as displacement and rotation. The more accurate the displacement function, the more accurate the result.

The method assumes that the system (the column) is a conservative system in which energy is not dissipated as heat, hence the energy added to the column by the applied external forces is stored in the column in the form of strain energy.

formula_67

In this method, there are two equations used (for small deformations) to approximate the &quot;strain&quot; energy (the potential energy stored as elastic deformation of the structure) and &quot;applied&quot; energy (the work done on the system by external forces).

formula_68

where formula_69 is the displacement function and the subscripts formula_70 and formula_71 refer to the first and second derivatives of the displacement.

=== Single-degree-of-freedom models ===
Using the concept of &quot;total potential energy&quot;, formula_72, it is possible to identify four fundamental forms of buckling found in structural models with one degree of freedom. We start by expressing
formula_73
where formula_74 is the strain energy stored in the structure, formula_75 is the applied &quot;conservative&quot; load and formula_76 is the distance moved by formula_75 in its direction. Using the axioms of elastic instability theory, namely that equilibrium is any point where formula_72 is stationary with respect to the coordinate measuring the degree(s) of freedom and that these points are only stable if formula_72 is a local minimum and unstable if otherwise (e.g. maximum or a point of inflection).

These four forms of elastic buckling are the &quot;saddle-node bifurcation&quot; or &quot;limit point&quot;; the &quot;supercritical&quot; or &quot;stable-symmetric&quot; bifurcation; the &quot;subcritical&quot; or &quot;unstable-symmetric&quot; bifurcation; and the &quot;transcritical&quot; or &quot;asymmetric&quot; bifurcation. All but the first of these examples is a form of &quot;pitchfork bifurcation&quot;. Simple models for each of these types of buckling behaviour are shown in the figures below, along with the associated bifurcation diagrams.

== Engineering examples ==
=== Bicycle wheels ===
A conventional bicycle wheel consists of a thin rim kept under high compressive stress by the (roughly normal) inward pull of a large number of spokes. It can be considered as a loaded column that has been bent into a circle. If spoke tension is increased beyond a safe level or if part of the rim is subject to a certain lateral force, the wheel spontaneously fails into a characteristic saddle shape (sometimes called a &quot;taco&quot; or a &quot;pringle&quot;) like a three-dimensional Euler column. If this is a purely elastic deformation the rim will resume its proper plane shape if spoke tension is reduced or a lateral force from the opposite direction is applied.

=== Roads ===
Buckling is a failure mode in pavement materials, primarily with concrete, since asphalt is more flexible. Radiant heat from the sun is absorbed in the road surface, causing it to expand, forcing adjacent pieces to push against each other. If the stress is sufficient, the pavement can lift and crack without warning. Traversing a buckled section can be jarring to automobile drivers, described as running over a speed hump at highway speeds.

=== Rail tracks ===
Similarly, rail tracks also expand when heated, and can fail by buckling, a phenomenon called sun kink. It is more common for rails to move laterally, often pulling the underlying ties (sleepers) along.

Sun kink can lead to railroads drastically reducing the speed of trains, leading to delays and cancellations. This is done to avoid derailment. Intensifying heat waves due to climate change doubled the number of hours of heat related delays in 2023, compared to 2018.

These accidents were deemed to be sun kink-related (&quot;more information available at List of rail accidents (2000–2009)&quot;):
* April 18, 2002 Amtrak &quot;Auto-Train&quot; derailment, off CSX tracks, near Crescent City, Florida.
* July 29, 2002 Amtrak &quot;Capitol Limited&quot; derailment, off CSX tracks, near Kensington, Maryland.
* July 8, 2010 CSX train derailment in Waxhaw, North Carolina.
* July 6, 2012 WMATA Metrorail train derailment near West Hyattsville station, Maryland.

The Federal Railroad Administration issued a Safety Advisory on July 11, 2012 alerting railroad operators to inspect tracks for &quot;buckling-prone conditions.&quot; The Advisory included a brief summary of four derailments that had occurred between June 23 to July 4 that appeared to be &quot;heat related incidents.&quot;

=== Pipes and pressure vessels ===
Pipes and pressure vessels subject to external overpressure, caused for example by steam cooling within the pipe and condensing into water with subsequent massive pressure drop, risk buckling due to compressive hoop stresses. Design rules for calculation of the required wall thickness or reinforcement rings are given in various piping and pressure vessel codes.

=== Super- and hypersonic aerospace vehicles ===
Aerothermal heating can lead to buckling of surface panels on super- and hypersonic aerospace vehicles such as high-speed aircraft, rockets and reentry vehicles. If buckling is caused by aerothermal loads, the situation can be further complicated by enhanced heat transfer in areas where the structure deforms towards the flow-field.

<text>transition was an experimental literary journal that featured surrealist, expressionist, and Dada art and artists. It was founded in 1927 by Maria McDonald and her husband Eugene Jolas and published in Paris. They were later assisted by editors Elliot Paul (April 1927 – March 1928), Robert Sage (October 1927 – Fall 1928), and James Johnson Sweeney (June 1936 – May 1938). After the Second World War, the publishing license of &quot;transition&quot; was transferred from the Jolases and McDonald to Georges Duthuit who capitalized the title to Transition (1948-1950) and changed its focus.

==Origins==
The literary journal was intended as an outlet for experimental writing and featured modernist, surrealist and other linguistically innovative writing and also contributions by visual artists, critics, and political activists. It ran until spring 1938. A total of 27 issues were produced. It was distributed primarily through Shakespeare and Company, the Paris bookstore run by Sylvia Beach.

While it originally almost exclusively featured poetic experimentalists, it later accepted contributions from sculptors, civil rights activists, carvers, critics, and cartoonists. Editors who joined the journal later on were Stuart Gilbert, Caresse Crosby and Harry Crosby. Maeve Sage acted as secretary for the magazine during a portion of its Paris-based run.

==Purpose==

Published quarterly, &quot;transition&quot; also featured Surrealist, Expressionist, and Dada art. In an introduction to the first issue, Eugene Jolas wrote:

==Manifesto==

The journal gained notoriety in 1929 when Jolas issued a manifesto about writing. He personally asked writers to sign &quot;The Revolution of the Word Proclamation&quot; which appeared in issue 16/17 of &quot;transition&quot;. It began:

The Proclamation was signed by Kay Boyle, Whit Burnett, Hart Crane, Caresse Crosby, Harry Crosby, Martha Foley, Stuart Gilbert, A. Lincoln Gillespie, Leigh Hoffman, Eugene Jolas, Elliot Paul, Douglas Rigby, Theo Rutra, Robert Sage, Harold J. Salemson, and Laurence Vail.

Christian Zervos&#x27; article &quot;Picasso à Dinard&quot; was featured in the Spring 1928 issue. No. 26, 1937, with a Marcel Duchamp cover, featured Hans Arp, Man Ray, Fernand Léger, László Moholy-Nagy, Piet Mondrian, Alexander Calder and others.

A third to half the space in the early years of &quot;transition&quot; was given to translations, some of which done by Maria McDonald Jolas; French writers included: André Breton, André Gide and the Peruvian Victor Llona ; German and Austrian poets and writers included Hugo Ball, Carl Einstein, Yvan Goll, Rainer Maria Rilke, René Schickele, August Stramm, Georg Trakl; Bulgarian, Czech, Hungarian, Italian, Polish, Russian, Serbian, Swedish, Yiddish, and Native American texts were also translated.

Perhaps the most famous work to appear in &quot;transition&quot; was &quot;Finnegans Wake&quot;, by James Joyce. Many segments of the unfinished novel were published under the name of &quot;Work in Progress&quot;.

== Featured artists ==
While transition was foremost a literary review, it also featured avant-garde visual art beginning with its inaugural issue (April 1927), which included reproductions of paintings by Max Ernst, Lajos Tihanyi, and Pavel Tchelitchew. While the periodical&#x27;s cover initially bore only textual elements, commencing with the thirteenth issue Jolas began to feature art on the outside of his publication as well–much of it created specifically for &quot;transition&quot;. In the order of their appearance, the magazine&#x27;s covers included art by Pablo Picasso, Stuart Davis, Man Ray, Gretchen Powel, Kurt Schwitters, Eli Lotar, Jean Arp, Sophie Taeuber-Arp, Paul Klee, Fernand Léger, Joan Miró, Marcel Duchamp, and Wassily Kandinsky. In his essay &quot;Fontierless Decade&quot;, in the magazine&#x27;s final issue, Jolas reflected that “all the new painters, photographers, and sculptors were reproduced [in &quot;transition&quot;], beginning in 1927, when many of them were unknown outside of a small circle on the continent.” While Jolas&#x27;s program for his magazine was outwardly focused on literature, his comments in his essay &quot;A New Vocabulary&quot; indicate that he considered visual art&#x27;s inventiveness to be a model for the possibilities of the poetic word. He wrote, “While painting . . .  has proceeded to rid itself of the descriptive, done away with classical perspective, has tried more and more to attain a purity of abstract idealism, should the art of the word remain static?” Much of the visual art in &quot;transition&quot; belongs to a small number of avant-garde moments that later became a part of the Modernist canon, especially (but not exclusively) Dada, Surrealism, Cubism, and Constructivism. Other artistic selections, like the reproduction of Marie Monnier&#x27;s embroidery &quot;Birth&quot;, in &quot;transition&quot; no. 4, highlight Jolas&#x27;s interest in both new and re-invented means of expression as well as marking the milieu in which he and his co-editors worked and socialized. For instance, Jolas knew Marie Monnier&#x27;s sister, Adrienne Monnier, proprietor of the bookstore La Maison des Amis des Livres, where Marie&#x27;s work was exhibited in 1927. Moreover, the writer Léon-Paul Fargue, who Jolas admired and included in his magazine, wrote text the catalog to the 1927 exhibition of Marie Monnier&#x27;s embroidery. Similarly, Jolas obtained a number of the reproductions of Surrealist paintings and objects that appeared in the magazine&#x27;s first two years–including work by Yves Tanguy, who was little known at the time–by way of his friend Marcel Noll, who was director of the Galerie Surréaliste until it closed in 1928. &quot;Transition&quot;, in turn, ran advertisements for the gallery in several issues.

==Post-war revival==
Transition was the short-lived post-war revival of &quot;transition&quot;. While &quot;Transition&quot; was edited by Georges Duthuit and the copyright to use the name &quot;Transition&quot; was bought by Duthuit, the Jolases remained a part of the project. Eugene Jolas was on the editorial board and Maria Jolas was heavily involved. The name &quot;Transition&quot; was usually followed by the last two digits of the year it was published (eg. &quot;Transition Forty-Eight&quot;). 

&quot;Transition&quot; was less international and had a less diverse selection of media than its predecessor. In the introduction, the project of the journal was set forth as &quot;to assemble for the English-speaking world the best of French art and thought, whatever the style or whatever the application&quot; although its audience was primarily American.

Samuel Beckett had many pieces published in &quot;Transition,&quot; along with working as a translator for about 30 pieces from the journal. Most of Beckett&#x27;s work for the journal was unsigned, so the extent of his contributions are unclear. A compilation of letters between Beckett and Duthuit, Three Dialogues, was originally published in &quot;Transition Forty-Nine.&quot;

She was launched on 23 December 1912 from the Wallsend yard of Swan, Hunter &amp; Wigham Richardson and joined the Fourth Destroyer Flotilla.

==Service during First World War==
From the beginning of the First World War, &quot;Spitfire&quot; and her flotilla were attached to the Grand Fleet.

===Battle of Jutland===
Amongst the small engagements which happened during the night of 31 May – 1 June 1916 during the Battle of Jutland was one between &quot;Spitfire&quot; and the German battleship . &quot;Spitfire&quot; evaded an attempt by &quot;Nassau&quot; to ram her, but the two ships nevertheless collided and &quot;Spitfire&quot; was seriously damaged, blast from &quot;Nassau&quot;″s guns demolishing much of her upperworks, but she ripped off a section of the German ship&#x27;s side plating. Both ships survived to return to port.

<text>Nancy Elizabeth Oliphant (August 5, 1918 – July 12, 2004) was a co-founder of the National Ballet School of Canada.

==Life==
Oliphant was born in London in 1918. Her father was a lawyer who died within weeks of her birth in a train crash. Oliphant suffered from pneumonia as a child and her doctor prescribed ballet lessons to help with her breathing. Her mother obtained lessons from a Miss Sheen who had been taught by others trained in Russia. Throughout her career Oliphant was known for following a Russian ballet style in her teaching. She studied with Tamara Karsavina, Laurent Novikoff and Marie Rambert. By the age of 17, she had opened her own school having decided that she was too tall to be top dancer herself.

She moved to Canada in 1947. In 1951, she became ballet mistress for the National Ballet of Canada at the request of Celia Franca, the company&#x27;s director. She and Franca founded the National Ballet School of Canada in 1959. Alumni include Frank Augustyn, Rex Harrington, Karen Kain, John Alleyne, James Kudelka and Veronica Tennant. She had been trained in the Cecchetti method of classical dance.

In 1959, she became associate artistic director for the National Ballet of Canada, but resigned in 1975 to devote herself to the school. She retired in 1989.

She was known for her strict manner, high standards and insistence on technique. She wrote an auto biography where she recounted her difficult private life consoled by her career success.

She was appointed an Officer of the Order of Canada (OC) in 1972, &quot;in recognition of her leadership and her service as teacher and administrator of the National Ballet School&quot;, and promoted to a Companion of the Order (CC) in 1985. In 1988, the National Ballet School of Canada named its new performance space the Betty Oliphant Theatre. In 1996, she published an autobiography &quot;Miss O: My Life in Dance&quot; (). She was appointed a Member of the Order of Ontario (OOnt) in 2000.

She died in St. Catharines, Ontario at the age of 85.

<doc id="815983" wikidata="Q8076380" url="?curid=815983" title="¡Qué Locura!">
<text>¡Qué Locuras! is a hidden camera-comedy television show from the United States and Venezuela. In English, &quot;¡Qué Locuras!&quot; translates as &quot;What Craziness!&quot; or &quot;What Follies!&quot; The premise of the show involves hidden cameras filming pranks on celebrities, both local and international. It is similar to &quot;Punk&#x27;d&quot; on MTV in the United States.

==Production information==
The show was first broadcast in 2000 and hosted by Ernesto Cortéz, who is best known for appearing in the sketch comedy show, &quot;Bienvenidos&quot;. &quot;¡Qué Locuras!&quot; is produced by Venevision International in the United States and directed by Hugo Carregal, and had, as of the beginning of 2007, around 150 episodes. &quot;¡Qué Locuras!&quot; has become a hit in the United States (where it was shown by Univision) as well as in other South American countries.

In 2018, Moncho Martinez, an actor who played several characters in the show, decided to bring it back to life as a theater play, with initial presentations in the northern Venezuelan city of Maracaibo.

==Notable pranks==
===Pranks involving characters played by Luís Moncho Martínez===
Dominican television actor Luís Moncho Martínez, who has produced the show since its debut, has created (and starred in) numerous pranks for the program. Among these pranks are:

*El Inspector Rodriguez
A celebrity is driven to Venevision&#x27;s studio facility, thinking that he or she is going to participate in a television show (particularly &quot;Súper Sábado Sensacional&quot;) and &quot;Guerra de los Sexos&quot;. Upon entering the parking lot, the celebrity gets told by the &quot;security guard&quot; known as Inspector Rodriguez (played by Luís Moncho Martínez) that he or she cannot proceed because the celebrity&#x27;s name does not appear on the list of Venevision&#x27;s guests for that day. Rodriguez would frequently tease and demean them to leave the premises in a way that would provoke the celebrities to yell at him (and even get into a physical altercation).

*Cocinando Con Ermo (translated: Cooking With Ermo)
A fake cooking show starring Ermo (played by Luís Moncho Martínez), an overly effeminate chef, was put on to lure celebrities into a trap consisting of Ermo arguing with his assistant (played by Irán Lovera), causing both of them to throw food and condiments at each other, with the celebrity in the middle of it all.

*Ruperto
Ruperto (played by Luís Moncho Martínez) is a mentally incapacitated man who wants to get a picture with every celebrity that arrives on the Venevision complex. As the celebrity is interviewed in the hallway by a man posing as a Venevision reporter (who is mentioned in the segment as Ruperto&#x27;s brother), Ruperto starts getting excited and starts harassing the celebrity.

*El Pintor Malandro (translated: Malandro the Painter)
Luís Moncho Martínez disguises himself as a painter hired by Venevision to repaint the walls of the complex and would often flirt with any young actress or even a Miss Venezuela contestant who passes by the hallway where he is painting the walls, leading to the women accusing him of sexual harassment.

*Ricardo
Ricardo (played by Luís Moncho Martínez) is a psychic who invites celebrities to his show and mentions to them what he knows about them by using cards and watermelon seeds. Ricardo provokes fights by mentioning the celebrities&#x27; personal lives, as well as ridiculously false statements about them.

*Te Voy a Sorprender (translated: I&#x27;m Going to Surprise You)
A fake show starring Carlitos Dugarte (played by Luís Moncho Martínez) involves an old woman and her two grown children in the studio audience who want to invite a celebrity to their home for a few days. When the celebrity refuses, the old woman of the family gets upset, faints on the set and pretends to die in order to scare the celebrity. As an alternate prank in this segment, two celebrities (each paired with an actor from &quot;¡Qué Locuras!&quot; disguised as an audience member) compete against each other in a trivia contest. Carlitos Dugarte asks the male celebrity the difficult questions in order to provoke a fight between the two. The original format of this segment was retooled and featured a man pretending to need a wheelchair to convince a female celebrity to go out on a date with him, and losing his temper in the green room when she refuses.

*Entrevista con el Pibe (translated: Interview with Pibe)
A circus-themed segment involving Pibe (played by Luís Moncho Martínez) interviewing a celebrity, three clowns known as &quot;Primer Piso&quot; (&quot;First Floor&quot;), &quot;Segundo Piso&quot; (&quot;Second Floor&quot;) and &quot;Tercer Piso&quot; (&quot;Third Floor&quot;) are said to appear in a latter part of this segment, but instead torture both Pibe and the celebrity guest by throwing pie plates at them, eventually causing a brawl.
*Albondiga y Spaghetti
This prank involves Martinez dressed as a clown filming a kids show presenting celebrities Martinez then proceeds to disrupt filming and insult his guest with making suggestions about their appearance and looks until provoking a physical altercation.
*El Show de Luisa
This prank involves a talk show segment in which Moncho Martinez plays a creator of a face cream product. After the interview the celebrity mainly women try on the cream and one of his clients storms the set claiming the product does damage to her face provoking a scare to the celebrity.

===Other pranks===
Other pranks include distorting music during a Lito &amp; Polaco performance, pornographic film scenes &quot;cutting in&quot; during a broadcast of a 2002 FIFA World Cup match, and fake policemen stopping celebrity cars to hand out &quot;tickets&quot;.

<text>Joseph Hinks (1840 – 24 April 1931) was a British manufacturer, working in Birmingham. With his father, James Hinks, he patented improvements to oil lamps, marketing the resultant Duplex lamp.

Joseph was born in 1840 in Birmingham, the son of James Hinks, the lamp manufacturer. His father&#x27;s career was very varied until he hit upon lamp making, and at the time of Joseph&#x27;s baptism in 1844 was a licensed victualler.

Joseph worked for his father as a lamp manufacturer from about the time he was 17 (in about 1857) and by 1861 he was recorded as a manufacturer in the same terms as his father. By 1862 the business was called &quot;James Hinks and Son&quot;. They operated from the Crystal Lamp Works on the corner of Great Hampton Street and Hockley Street, Birmingham. The great selling point of their lamps was that they did not need frequent trimming or give off nasty smoke or smells. In 1864 they developed the &quot;Patent Duplex Lamp&quot;, which used two wicks instead of the usual one, and gave out twice the light.

The company was incorporated in 1873 (and re-incorporated in 1896). Newspaper reports suggest that James retired as managing director and became chairman in about 1897–98, when Joseph took over. The firm had bases in London and Birmingham. Important customers included railway companies, which used oil lamps to light stations, trains and signals. They also developed specialist lamps and hurricane lanterns for India which was one of their most lucrative markets. With an eye to the domestic market, Hinks&#x27; lamps were also decorative and borrowing from the designs of beautiful European china and porcelain table decorations their lamps were also a byword for domestic beauty, so much so that there is still a flourishing market for antique Hinks&#x27; lamps. Hinks lamps were state-of-the-art until the early 20th century when electric lighting became the norm.

Joseph married Frances Dain (1843–1928) in 1865 in Aston; they had eight children. The family moved to Leamington Spa in the 1870s, and Joseph served as mayor of Leamington in 1890 and 1892. He was also a borough magistrate and alderman. He took over the family business in 1898 when his father retired. Joseph&#x27;s son, Harry, became managing director in 1901 when Joseph moved into the chairman role.

Joseph died on 24 April 1931 at Orkney Cottage, Taplow, Buckinghamshire. When he died his estate valued at about £111,000 [about £7m in today&#x27;s money].

During his lifetime he was described as a &quot;dapper little man with the bearing of a distinguished soldier rather than a quick-witted inventor or a successful man of business&quot;. During the First World War the firm made mess tins, hand grenades and shell components. After the war, competition from the US and an increase in the cost of raw materials led to a business decline. The factory closed after 1929 and the old factory was pulled down in the 1930s.

<text>William Kiptarus Tanui (born 22 February 1964) is a Kenyan former athlete, winner of 800 m at the 1992 Summer Olympics.

==Biography==
Born in Terik Location of South Nandi District, William Tanui first came to notice relatively late in life, when he won the 1500 m at the Kenyan Commonwealth Games trials in 1989, but ran only sixth at the 1990 Commonwealth Games in Auckland, New Zealand. In the same year he won the 800 m at the African Championships in Cairo. In the World Indoor Championships at Seville in 1991, Tanui crossed the line first, but was disqualified for breaking from his lane too early. He won 800 metres in the 1991 All-Africa Games.

Tanui&#x27;s greatest moment came at the 1992 Olympic Games in Barcelona. In the 800 m final he stormed down the outside, actually finishing in lane 3, to narrowly beat a fellow countryman Nixon Kiprotich for the gold medal. Tanui was unable to repeat this form in his only appearance at a World Championships, at Stuttgart in 1993, finishing seventh.

He finished 2nd at the IAAF World Cup 800 metres race in 1992 and 1994.

Tanui concentrated more on the 1500 m in the latter part of his career, and he finished fifth at that distance in the 1996 Olympic Games in Atlanta. At the World Indoor Championships, Tanui finished third in the 1500 m at Paris in 1997, and fourth at Maebashi in 1999.

<doc id="816001" wikidata="Q493567" url="?curid=816001" title="Peter Piot">
<text>Sir Peter Karel, Baron Piot (born 17 February 1949) is a Belgian-British microbiologist known for his research into Ebola and AIDS.

After helping discover the Ebola virus in 1976 and leading efforts to contain the first-ever recorded Ebola epidemic that same year, Piot became a pioneering researcher into AIDS. He has held key positions in the United Nations and World Health Organization involving AIDS research and management. He has also served as a professor at several universities worldwide. He is the author of 16 books and over 600 scientific articles.

== Early life and education ==
Piot was born in Keerbergen, Belgium. His father was a civil servant who worked with agricultural exports, and his mother ran a construction company. Piot is the oldest of two brothers and a sister.

After studying physics in the School of Engineering and Physics at Ghent University, Piot changed to medicine. During medical school, Piot received a Diploma in Tropical Medicine (DTM) from the Institute of Tropical Medicine Antwerp in Antwerp. In 1974, he received an MD degree from Ghent University. In 1980, Piot received a PhD degree in clinical microbiology from the University of Antwerp.

== Career ==
In 1976, while working at the Institute of Tropical Medicine, Piot was part of a team that observed a Marburg-like virus in a sample of blood taken from a sick nun working in Zaire. Piot and his colleagues subsequently traveled to Zaire as part of an International Commission set up by the Government of Zaire to help quell the outbreak. The International Commission made key discoveries into how the virus spread, and traveled from village to village, spreading information and putting the ill and those who had come into contact with them into quarantine. The epidemic was already waning when the International Commission arrived, thanks to measures taken by local and national authorities, and it finally stopped in three months, after it had killed almost 300 people. The events were dramatised by Mike Walker on BBC Radio 4 in December 2014 in a production by David Morley. Piot narrated the programme.

Piot has received the majority of the credit for discovering Ebola, since in 1976, it was claimed he was the one to receive blood samples while working in a lab at the Institute for Tropical Medicine in Antwerp, Belgium. The samples were once claimed to be originally sent by Dr. Jean-Jacques Muyembe-Tamfum, a Congolese doctor who obtained the blood samples from those sickened with a mysterious disease in then-Zaire, later discovered to be Ebola. In 2012, Piot published a memoir entitled &quot;No Time to Lose&quot; which chronicles his professional work, including the discovery of the Ebolavirus; he mentions Muyembe in passing rather than as a co-discoverer. In a 2016 Journal of Infectious Disease article, co-signed by most of the actors from that first outbreak, including Peter Piot and Jean-Jacques Muyembe, the claims by both Piot and Muyembe to have played a significant role in the early discovery of Ebola have been refuted. Piot stated in 2019 that &quot;my book was not an attempt to write the history of Ebola, but more my personal experience&quot;.

In the 1980s, Piot participated in collaborative projects in Burundi, Côte d&#x27;Ivoire, Kenya, Tanzania, and Zaire. Project SIDA in Kinshasa, Zaire was the first international project on AIDS in Africa and is widely acknowledged as having provided the foundations of science&#x27;s understanding of HIV infection in Africa. He was a professor of microbiology, and of public health at the Prince Leopold Institute of Tropical Medicine, in Antwerp, and at the University of Nairobi, Vrije Universiteit Brussel, the Lausanne, and a visiting professor at the London School of Economics. He was also a senior fellow at the University of Washington in Seattle, a scholar in residence at the Ford Foundation, and a senior fellow at the Bill &amp; Melinda Gates Foundation.

From 1991 to 1994, Piot was president of the International AIDS Society. In 1992, he became assistant director of the World Health Organization&#x27;s Global Programme on HIV/AIDS. On 12 December 1994, he was appointed executive director of the Joint United Nations Programme on HIV/AIDS (UNAIDS) and Assistant-Secretary-General of the United Nations.

From 2009 to 2010, Piot served as director of the Institute for Global Health at Imperial College London.

=== London School of Hygiene &amp; Tropical Medicine ===
In October 2010, Piot became the director of the London School of Hygiene &amp; Tropical Medicine.

In addition to his work at LSHTM, Piot is a member of the Institute of Medicine of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States and the Royal Academy of Medicine of Belgium, a Fellow of the Royal College of Physicians of London, UK and a Fellow of the Academy of Medical Sciences. In 2011, Amy Gutmann appointed him to serve on the International Research Panel at the Presidential Commission for the Study of Bioethical Issues.

In 2014, in the face of an unprecedented Ebola epidemic in western Africa, Piot and other scientists called for the emergency release of the experimental ZMapp vaccine for use on humans before it had undergone clinical testing on humans. That year, he was appointed by Director General Margaret Chan to the World Health Organization&#x27;s Advisory Group on the Ebola Virus Disease Response, co-chaired by Sam Zaramba and David L. Heymann. He also chaired an independent panel convened by Harvard Global Health Institute and the London School of Hygiene &amp; Tropical Medicine into the national and international response to the epidemic, which sharply criticised the response of the WHO and put forward ten recommendations for the body&#x27;s reorganisation. In February 2020, he criticised the delay in declaring the 2019–20 novel coronavirus outbreak focused on Hubei, China, a Public Health Emergency of International Concern, and advocated a five-point scale for outbreaks, rather the current binary (emergency/no emergency) system.

In 2020, Piot was appointed to the European Commission’s advisory panel on COVID-19, co-chaired by Ursula von der Leyen and Stella Kyriakides. In the preparations for the Global Health Summit hosted by the European Commission and the G20 in May 2021, Piot co-chaired the event&#x27;s High-Level Scientific Panel.

<doc id="816006" wikidata="Q1066338" url="?curid=816006" title="Charles Vyner Brooke">
<text>Sir Charles Vyner Brooke, Rajah of Sarawak , full name Charles Vyner de Windt Brooke (26 September 1874 – 9 May 1963) was the third and last White Rajah of the Raj of Sarawak.

==Early life==
Charles Vyner Brooke was the son of Charles Brooke and Margaret de Windt (Ranee Margaret of Sarawak). He was born in London and spent his youth there, being educated at Clevedon, Winchester College, and Magdalene College, Cambridge. He then entered the Sarawak public service.

Vyner served as &quot;aide-de-camp&quot; to his father (1897–1898), a district officer of Simanggang (1898–1901), Resident of Mukah and Oya, (1902–1903), Resident of the Third Division (1903–1904), President of the Law Courts (1904–1911) and vice-president of the Supreme and General Councils (1904–1911).

In his military career, he was commissioned as a second lieutenant into the 3rd County of London Yeomanry (Sharpshooters) on 12 May 1911, but resigned from the (County of London) Battalion (Artist&#x27;s Rifles) on 21 May 1913. During the First World War he served as a rating in a naval anti-aircraft defence unit, and as a fitter in an aeroplane manufacturing works at Shoreditch, East London.

He was granted the personal style of His Highness by command of King George V, 22 June 1911. On 21 February 1911 whilst in the United Kingdom he married Sylvia Brett, daughter of Lord Esher. They returned to Sarawak.

==Rajah of Sarawak==
Vyner succeeded his father as White Rajah on 17 May 1917 following his death and was proclaimed Rajah on 24 May 1917 at Kuching. He took the oath before the Council Negri on 22 July 1918. Vyner&#x27;s early years as Rajah (a role he performed in tandem with his younger brother, Bertram, in accord with their father&#x27;s wish) saw a boom in Sarawak&#x27;s rubber and oil industries and the subsequent rise in the Sarawak economy allowed him to modernise the country&#x27;s institutions, including the public service, and introduce a penal code based on that of British India in 1924.

He was granted a knighthood in 1927. 

Vyner ran a hands-off and relatively popular administration that banned Christian missionaries and fostered indigenous traditions (to an extent: headhunting was outlawed).

=== World War II ===
Japanese forces landed at Miri, Sarawak on 16 December 1941, beginning an invasion of Borneo. In that same year, Vyner withdrew £200,000 from the Treasury for his personal expenses, in exchange for limiting his powers by a new constitution. Vyner and his family were visiting Sydney, where he would remain for the duration of the war.

==Abdication and later life==

Vyner returned to Sarawak on 15 April 1946 and temporarily resumed power as Rajah, until 1 July 1946 when he ceded Sarawak to the British government as a Crown colony, thus ending White Rajah rule in Sarawak. Vyner died in London at No. 13, Albion Street, Bayswater, W2 on 9 May 1963, four months before Sarawak, Malaya, North Borneo and Singapore joined to form the Federation of Malaysia on 16 September 1963.

His nephew, Anthony Brooke, served in Sarawak in various departments in the civil service including the Land and Registry Office, and as a magistrate. Since 1937 he had also been Rajah Muda (crown prince) of Sarawak, because Vyner had three daughters but no son. Anthony opposed cession to Britain, as did a majority of the native members of the Council Negri (Parliament), and they campaigned against it for five years.

The anti-cession movement came to a head in 1948 when the second British governor to Sarawak, Duncan Stewart, was assassinated by a young nationalist named Rosli Dhobi in Sibu. Suspicion fell on Anthony for orchestrating the killing but declassified documents from the British National Archive later showed that he had no connection to the plot.

Vyner, his father, his brother Bertram, the Tuan Muda, and Rajah James, are buried in St Leonard&#x27;s Church in the village of Sheepstor on Dartmoor, Devon.

==Family==
He had three daughters, whose names could be preceded by the Malay honorific of &quot;Dayang&quot; (Lady):
* Leonora Margaret, Countess of Inchcape, wife of the 2nd Earl of Inchcape (one son, Lord Tanlaw, and one daughter) and, after his death, of US Colonel Francis Parker Tompkins (one son).
* Elizabeth, born in London, September 2, 1913, a Royal Academy of Dramatic Art-educated singer and actress, wife of firstly Harry Roy (one son and one daughter), and secondly, Julian Richards Vidmer. She died March 14, 2002, at Redington Shores, Florida.
* Nancy Valerie, an actress, known for &quot;The Charge of the Light Brigade&quot;, wife of firstly, Robert Gregory, an American wrestler; secondly, José Pepi Cabarro – a Spanish businessman; thirdly, Andrew Aitken Macnair (one son, Stewart, born 1952); and fourthly, Memery Whyatt. She died in Florida.

==Legacy==
The ship SS &quot;Vyner Brooke&quot; was named after him.

A species of lizard endemic to Sarawak, &quot;Dasia vyneri&quot;, is named in his honor.

<text>Calamita () is a large hill lying on the south-east side of the island of Elba, known for a remarkable landscape and views of Portoferraio and Monte Capanne. The hill&#x27;s development dates from Elba&#x27;s ancient periods, when Calamita was a major iron mining center.

The Calamita&#x27;s coast has been nicknamed &quot;Costa dei Gabbiani&quot; (&quot;Skua Coast&quot;), after the numerous skuas which nest in the cliffs.

The town of Capoliveri sits on the north side of Calamita, overlooking the Mola flats.

The southeast area of the hill is dotted with farmland, though much of it has been converted into tourist resorts and villas.

On the south side is the Calamita iron mine, abandoned since 1981, where pyrite nuggets can still be found.

<text>Psychoneuroimmunology (PNI), also referred to as psychoendoneuroimmunology (PENI) or psychoneuroendocrinoimmunology (PNEI), is the study of the interaction between psychological processes and the nervous and immune systems of the human body. It is a subfield of psychosomatic medicine. PNI takes an interdisciplinary approach, incorporating psychology, neuroscience, immunology, physiology, genetics, pharmacology, molecular biology, psychiatry, behavioral medicine, infectious diseases, endocrinology, and rheumatology.

The main interests of PNI are the interactions between the nervous and immune systems and the relationships between mental processes and health. PNI studies, among other things, the physiological functioning of the neuroimmune system in health and disease; disorders of the neuroimmune system (autoimmune diseases; hypersensitivities; immune deficiency); and the physical, chemical and physiological characteristics of the components of the neuroimmune system in vitro, in situ, and in vivo.

==History==
Interest in the relationship between psychiatric syndromes or symptoms and immune function has been a consistent theme since the beginning of modern medicine.

Claude Bernard, a French physiologist of the Muséum national d&#x27;Histoire naturelle (National Museum of Natural History in English), formulated the concept of the &quot;milieu interieur&quot; in the mid-1800s. In 1865, Bernard described the perturbation of this internal state: &quot;... there are protective functions of organic elements holding living materials in reserve and maintaining without interruption humidity, heat and other conditions indispensable to vital activity. Sickness and death are only a dislocation or perturbation of that mechanism&quot; (Bernard, 1865). Walter Cannon, a professor of physiology at Harvard University coined the commonly used term, homeostasis, in his book &quot;The Wisdom of the Body&quot;, 1932, from the Greek word &quot;homoios&quot;, meaning similar, and &quot;stasis&quot;, meaning position. In his work with animals, Cannon observed that any change of emotional state in the beast, such as anxiety, distress, or rage, was accompanied by total cessation of movements of the stomach (&quot;Bodily Changes in Pain, Hunger, Fear and Rage&quot;, 1915). These studies looked into the relationship between the effects of emotions and perceptions on the autonomic nervous system, namely the sympathetic and parasympathetic responses that initiated the recognition of the freeze, fight or flight response. His findings were published from time to time in professional journals, then summed up in book form in &quot;The Mechanical Factors of Digestion&quot;, published in 1911.

Hans Selye, a student of Johns Hopkins University and McGill University, and a researcher at Université de Montréal, experimented with animals by putting them under different physical and mental adverse conditions and noted that under these difficult conditions the body consistently adapted to heal and recover. Several years of experimentation that formed the empiric foundation of Selye&#x27;s concept of the General Adaptation Syndrome. This syndrome consists of an enlargement of the adrenal gland, atrophy of the thymus, spleen, and other lymphoid tissue, and gastric ulcerations.

Selye describes three stages of adaptation, including an initial brief alarm reaction, followed by a prolonged period of resistance, and a terminal stage of exhaustion and death. This foundational work led to a rich line of research on the biological functioning of glucocorticoids.

Mid-20th century studies of psychiatric patients reported immune alterations in psychotic individuals, including lower numbers of lymphocytes and poorer antibody response to pertussis vaccination, compared with nonpsychiatric control subjects. In 1964, George F. Solomon, from the University of California in Los Angeles, and his research team coined the term &quot;psychoimmunology&quot; and published a landmark paper: &quot;Emotions, immunity, and disease: a speculative theoretical integration.&quot;

===Origins===
In 1975, Robert Ader and Nicholas Cohen, at the University of Rochester, advanced PNI with their demonstration of classic conditioning of immune function, and they subsequently coined the term &quot;psychoneuroimmunology&quot;. Ader was investigating how long conditioned responses (in the sense of Pavlov&#x27;s conditioning of dogs to drool when they heard a bell ring) might last in laboratory rats. To condition the rats, he used a combination of saccharin-laced water (the conditioned stimulus) and the drug Cytoxan, which unconditionally induces nausea and taste aversion and suppression of immune function. Ader was surprised to discover that after conditioning, just feeding the rats saccharin-laced water was associated with the death of some animals and he proposed that they had been immunosuppressed after receiving the conditioned stimulus. Ader (a psychologist) and Cohen (an immunologist) directly tested this hypothesis by deliberately immunizing conditioned and unconditioned animals, exposing these and other control groups to the conditioned taste stimulus, and then measuring the amount of antibody produced. The highly reproducible results revealed that conditioned rats exposed to the conditioned stimulus were indeed immunosuppressed. In other words, a signal via the nervous system (taste) was affecting immune function. This was one of the first scientific experiments that demonstrated that the nervous system can affect the immune system.

In the 1970s, Hugo Besedovsky, Adriana del Rey and Ernst Sorkin, working in Switzerland, reported multi-directional immune-neuro-endocrine interactions, since they show that not only the brain can influence immune processes but also the immune response itself can affect the brain and neuroendocrine mechanisms. They found that the immune responses to innocuous antigens triggers an increase in the activity of hypothalamic neurons and hormonal and autonomic nerve responses that are relevant for immunoregulation and are integrated at brain levels (see review). On these bases, they proposed that the immune system acts as a sensorial receptor organ that, besides its peripheral effects, can communicate to the brain and associated neuro-endocrine structures its state of activity. These investigators also identified products from immune cells, later characterized as cytokines, that mediate this immune-brain communication (more references in).

In 1981, David L. Felten, then working at the Indiana University School of Medicine, and his colleague JM Williams, discovered a network of nerves leading to blood vessels as well as cells of the immune system. The researchers also found nerves in the thymus and spleen terminating near clusters of lymphocytes, macrophages, and mast cells, all of which help control immune function. This discovery provided one of the first indications of how neuro-immune interaction occurs.

Ader, Cohen, and Felten went on to edit the groundbreaking book &quot;Psychoneuroimmunology&quot; in 1981, which laid out the underlying premise that the brain and immune system represent a single, integrated system of defense.

In 1985, research by neuropharmacologist Candace Pert, of the National Institutes of Health at Georgetown University, revealed that neuropeptide-specific receptors are present on the cell walls of both the brain and the immune system. The discovery that neuropeptides and neurotransmitters act directly upon the immune system shows their close association with emotions and suggests mechanisms through which emotions, from the limbic system, and immunology are deeply interdependent. Showing that the immune and endocrine systems are modulated not only by the brain but also by the central nervous system itself affected the understanding of emotions, as well as disease.

Contemporary advances in psychiatry, immunology, neurology, and other integrated disciplines of medicine has fostered enormous growth for PNI. The mechanisms underlying behaviorally induced alterations of immune function, and immune alterations inducing behavioral changes, are likely to have clinical and therapeutic implications that will not be fully appreciated until more is known about the extent of these interrelationships in normal and pathophysiological states.

==The immune-brain loop==
PNI research looks for the exact mechanisms by which specific neuroimmune effects are achieved. Evidence for nervous-immunological interactions exist at multiple biological levels.

The immune system and the brain communicate through signaling pathways. The brain and the immune system are the two major adaptive systems of the body. Two major pathways are involved in this cross-talk: the Hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis (HPA axis), and the sympathetic nervous system (SNS), via the sympathetic-adrenal-medullary axis (SAM axis). The activation of SNS during an immune response might be aimed to localize the inflammatory response.

The body&#x27;s primary stress management system is the HPA axis. The HPA axis responds to physical and mental challenge to maintain homeostasis in part by controlling the body&#x27;s cortisol level. Dysregulation of the HPA axis is implicated in numerous stress-related diseases, with evidence from meta-analyses indicating that different types/duration of stressors and unique personal variables can shape the HPA response. HPA axis activity and cytokines are intrinsically intertwined: inflammatory cytokines stimulate adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH) and cortisol secretion, while, in turn, glucocorticoids suppress the synthesis of proinflammatory cytokines.

Molecules called pro-inflammatory cytokines, which include interleukin-1 (IL-1), Interleukin-2 (IL-2), interleukin-6 (IL-6), Interleukin-12 (IL-12), Interferon-gamma (IFN-Gamma) and tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-alpha) can affect brain growth as well as neuronal function. Circulating immune cells such as macrophages, as well as glial cells (microglia and astrocytes) secrete these molecules. Cytokine regulation of hypothalamic function is an active area of research for the treatment of anxiety-related disorders.

Cytokines mediate and control immune and inflammatory responses. Complex interactions exist between cytokines, inflammation and the adaptive responses in maintaining homeostasis. Like the stress response, the inflammatory reaction is crucial for survival. Systemic inflammatory reaction results in stimulation of four major programs:
* the acute-phase reaction
* sickness behavior
* the pain program
* the stress response

These are mediated by the HPA axis and the SNS. Common human diseases such as allergy, autoimmunity, chronic infections and sepsis are characterized by a dysregulation of the pro-inflammatory versus anti-inflammatory and T helper (Th1) versus (Th2) cytokine balance.
Recent studies show pro-inflammatory cytokine processes take place during depression, mania and bipolar disease, in addition to autoimmune hypersensitivity and chronic infections.

Chronic secretion of stress hormones, glucocorticoids (GCs) and catecholamines (CAs), as a result of disease, may reduce the effect of neurotransmitters, including serotonin, norepinephrine and dopamine, or other receptors in the brain, thereby leading to the dysregulation of neurohormones. Under stimulation, norepinephrine is released from the sympathetic nerve terminals in organs, and the target immune cells express adrenoreceptors. Through stimulation of these receptors, locally released norepinephrine, or circulating catecholamines such as epinephrine, affect lymphocyte traffic, circulation, and proliferation, and modulate cytokine production and the functional activity of different lymphoid cells.

Glucocorticoids also inhibit the further secretion of corticotropin-releasing hormone from the hypothalamus and ACTH from the pituitary (negative feedback). Under certain conditions stress hormones may facilitate inflammation through induction of signaling pathways and through activation of the corticotropin-releasing hormone.

These abnormalities and the failure of the adaptive systems to resolve inflammation affect the well-being of the individual, including behavioral parameters, quality of life and sleep, as well as indices of metabolic and cardiovascular health, developing into a &quot;systemic anti-inflammatory feedback&quot; and/or &quot;hyperactivity&quot; of the local pro-inflammatory factors which may contribute to the pathogenesis of disease.

This systemic or neuro-inflammation and neuroimmune activation have been shown to play a role in the etiology of a variety of neurodegenerative disorders such as Parkinson&#x27;s and Alzheimer&#x27;s disease, multiple sclerosis, pain, and AIDS-associated dementia. However, cytokines and chemokines also modulate central nervous system (CNS) function in the absence of overt immunological, physiological, or psychological challenges.

==Psychoneuroimmunological effects==
There are now sufficient data to conclude that immune modulation by psychosocial stressors and/or interventions can lead to actual health changes. Although changes related to infectious disease and wound healing have provided the strongest evidence to date, the clinical importance of immunological dysregulation is highlighted by increased risks across diverse conditions and diseases. For example, stressors can produce profound health consequences. In one epidemiological study, all-cause mortality increased in the month following a severe stressor – the death of a spouse. Theorists propose that stressful events trigger cognitive and affective responses which, in turn, induce sympathetic nervous system and endocrine changes, and these ultimately impair immune function. Potential health consequences are broad, but include rates of infection HIV progression cancer incidence and progression, and high rates of infant mortality.

===Understanding stress and immune function===

Stress is thought to affect immune function through emotional and/or behavioral manifestations such as anxiety, fear, tension, anger and sadness and physiological changes such as heart rate, blood pressure, and sweating. Researchers have suggested that these changes are beneficial if they are of limited duration, but when stress is chronic, the system is unable to maintain equilibrium or homeostasis; the body remains in a state of arousal, where digestion is slower to reactivate or does not reactivate properly, often resulting in indigestion. Furthermore, blood pressure stays at higher levels.

In one of the earlier PNI studies, which was published in 1960, subjects were led to believe that they had accidentally caused serious injury to a companion through misuse of explosives. Since then decades of research resulted in two large meta-analyses, which showed consistent immune dysregulation in healthy people who are experiencing stress.

In the first meta-analysis by Herbert and Cohen in 1993, they examined 38 studies of stressful events and immune function in healthy adults. They included studies of acute laboratory stressors (e.g. a speech task), short-term naturalistic stressors (e.g. medical examinations), and long-term naturalistic stressors (e.g. divorce, bereavement, caregiving, unemployment). They found consistent stress-related increases in numbers of total white blood cells, as well as decreases in the numbers of helper T cells, suppressor T cells, and cytotoxic T cells, B cells, and natural killer cells (NK). They also reported stress-related decreases in NK and T cell function, and T cell proliferative responses to phytohaemagglutinin [PHA] and concanavalin A [Con A]. These effects were consistent for short-term and long-term naturalistic stressors, but not laboratory stressors.

In the second meta-analysis by Zorrilla et al. in 2001, they replicated Herbert and Cohen&#x27;s meta-analysis. Using the same study selection procedures, they analyzed 75 studies of stressors and human immunity. Naturalistic stressors were associated with increases in number of circulating neutrophils, decreases in number and percentages of total T cells and helper T cells, and decreases in percentages of natural killer cell (NK) cells and cytotoxic T cell lymphocytes. They also replicated Herbert and Cohen&#x27;s finding of stress-related decreases in NKCC and T cell mitogen proliferation to phytohaemagglutinin (PHA) and concanavalin A (Con A).

A study done by the American Psychological Association did an experiment on rats, where they applied electrical shocks to a rat, and saw how interleukin-1 was released directly into the brain. Interleukin-1 is the same cytokine released when a macrophage chews on a bacterium, which then travels up the vagus nerve, creating a state of heightened immune activity, and behavioral changes.

More recently, there has been increasing interest in the links between interpersonal stressors and immune function. For example, marital conflict, loneliness, caring for a person with a chronic medical condition, and other forms on interpersonal stress dysregulate immune function.

===Communication between the brain and immune system===
* Stimulation of brain sites alters immunity (stressed animals have altered immune systems).
* Damage to brain hemispheres alters immunity (hemispheric lateralization effects).
* Immune cells produce cytokines that act on the CNS.
* Immune cells respond to signals from the CNS.

===Communication between neuroendocrine and immune system===
* Glucocorticoids and catecholamines influence immune cells.
* Hypothalamic Pituitary Adrenal axis releases the needed hormones to support the immune system.
* Activity of the immune system is correlated with neurochemical/neuroendocrine activity of brain cells.

===Connections between glucocorticoids and immune system===
* Anti-inflammatory hormones that enhance the organism&#x27;s response to a stressor.
* Prevent the overreaction of the body&#x27;s own defense system.
*Overactivation of glucocorticoid receptors can lead to health risks.
* Regulators of the immune system.
* Affect cell growth, proliferation and differentiation.
* Cause immunosuppression which can lead to an extended amount of time fighting off infections.
*High basal levels of cortisol are associated with a higher risk of infection.
* Suppress cell adhesion, antigen presentation, chemotaxis and cytotoxicity.
* Increase apoptosis.

===Corticotropin-releasing hormone (CRH)===
Release of corticotropin-releasing hormone (CRH) from the hypothalamus is influenced by stress.
* CRH is a major regulator of the HPA axis/stress axis.
* CRH Regulates secretion of adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH).
* CRH is widely distributed in the brain and periphery
* CRH also regulates the actions of the Autonomic nervous system ANS and immune system.

Furthermore, stressors that enhance the release of CRH suppress the function of the immune system; conversely, stressors that depress CRH release potentiate immunity.
* Central mediated since peripheral administration of CRH antagonist does not affect immunosuppression.
*HPA axis/stress axis responds consistently to stressors that are new, unpredictable and that have low-perceived control.
*As cortisol reaches an appropriate level in response to the stressor, it deregulates the activity of the hippocampus, hypothalamus, and pituitary gland which results in less production of cortisol.

===Relationships between prefrontal cortex activation and cellular senescence===
* Psychological stress is regulated by the prefrontal cortex (PFC)
* The PFC modulates vagal activity 
* Prefrontally modulated and vagally mediated cholinergic input to the spleen reduces inflammatory responses

==Pharmaceutical advances==
Glutamate agonists, cytokine inhibitors, vanilloid-receptor agonists, catecholamine modulators, ion-channel blockers, anticonvulsants, GABA agonists (including opioids and cannabinoids), COX inhibitors, acetylcholine modulators, melatonin analogs (such as Ramelton), adenosine receptor antagonists and several miscellaneous drugs (including biologics like Passiflora edulis) are being studied for their psychoneuroimmunological effects.

For example, SSRIs, SNRIs and tricyclic antidepressants acting on serotonin, norepinephrine, dopamine and cannabinoid receptors have been shown to be immunomodulatory and anti-inflammatory against pro-inflammatory cytokine processes, specifically on the regulation of IFN-gamma and IL-10, as well as TNF-alpha and IL-6 through a psychoneuroimmunological process. Antidepressants have also been shown to suppress TH1 upregulation.

Tricyclic and dual serotonergic-noradrenergic reuptake inhibition by SNRIs (or SSRI-NRI combinations), have also shown analgesic properties additionally. According to recent evidences antidepressants also seem to exert beneficial effects in experimental autoimmune neuritis in rats by decreasing Interferon-beta (IFN-beta) release or augmenting NK activity in depressed patients.

These studies warrant investigation of antidepressants for use in both psychiatric and non-psychiatric illness and that a psychoneuroimmunological approach may be required for optimal pharmacotherapy in many diseases. Future antidepressants may be made to specifically target the immune system by either blocking the actions of pro-inflammatory cytokines or increasing the production of anti-inflammatory cytokines.

The endocannabinoid system appears to play a significant role in the mechanism of action of clinically effective and potential antidepressants and may serve as a target for drug design and discovery. The endocannabinoid-induced modulation of stress-related behaviors appears to be mediated, at least in part, through the regulation of the serotoninergic system, by which cannabinoid CB1 receptors modulate the excitability of dorsal raphe serotonin neurons. Data suggest that the endocannabinoid system in cortical and subcortical structures is differentially altered in an animal model of depression and that the effects of chronic, unpredictable stress (CUS) on CB1 receptor binding site density are attenuated by antidepressant treatment while those on endocannabinoid content are not.

The increase in amygdalar CB1 receptor binding following imipramine treatment is consistent with prior studies which collectively demonstrate that several treatments which are beneficial to depression, such as electroconvulsive shock and tricyclic antidepressant treatment, increase CB1 receptor activity in subcortical limbic structures, such as the hippocampus, amygdala and hypothalamus. And preclinical studies have demonstrated the CB1 receptor is required for the behavioral effects of noradrenergic based antidepressants but is dispensable for the behavioral effect of serotonergic based antidepressants.

Extrapolating from the observations that positive emotional experiences boost the immune system, Roberts speculates that intensely positive emotional experiences—sometimes brought about during mystical experiences occasioned by psychedelic medicines—may boost the immune system powerfully. Research on salivary IgA supports this hypothesis, but experimental testing has not been done.

<text>Barry MacSweeney (17 July 1948 – 9 May 2000) was an English poet and journalist. His organizing work contributed to the British Poetry Revival.

==Life and work==
===1960s===
Barry MacSweeney was born in Newcastle upon Tyne. He left school aged 16, and began working as a journalist at the Newcastle Evening Chronicle, where he shared an office with the poet Basil Bunting. He began attending readings at the Morden Tower series, run by Connie and Tom Pickard, and took an active part in the thriving arts scene in mid-1960s Newcastle. Visitors to the Tower included American poets Allen Ginsberg, Gregory Corso, and Edward Dorn, as well as poets from across Britain. At a reading in 1965, MacSweeney met Andrew Crozier, who would include him in the first issue of &quot;The English Intelligencer.&quot;

Through the &quot;Intelligencer&quot;, MacSweeney got to know J.H. Prynne, John James, Peter Riley, and others associated with the &quot;Cambridge School&quot;. With Prynne, MacSweeney organised the Sparty Lea Poetry Festival in Easter 1967. Influenced in part by the Berkeley Poetry Conference of 1965, around two-dozen poets gathered at cottages belonging to MacSweeney&#x27;s family in a remote area of the North of England, near Allendale. Though MacSweeney later claimed the festival was marked by class tensions and hostilities between rival factions, the meeting was an important moment for the British Poetry Revival.

In the summer of 1967 MacSweeney was enrolled for a journalism degree course in Harlow, Essex, making regular visits to the &quot;Intelligencer&quot; poets in Wivenhoe and Cambridge. In September his sequence &#x27;The Boy From the Green Cabaret Tells of His Mother&#x27; was circulated to the magazine mailing-list. MacSweeney&#x27;s poems were picked up by Michael Dempsey, editor of Hutchinson New Authors Ltd, who was keen to capitalise on the success of the Penguin &quot;Mersey Poets&quot; anthology and the growing youth audience for poetry. His work appeared in the widely-available commercial edition in 1968, also titled &quot;The Boy from the Green Cabaret Tells of His Mother&quot;. As a publicity stunt, Hutchinson arranged to have the twenty-year-old poet nominated for the prestigious Oxford Professor of Poetry. He lost to Roy Fuller, and was satirised in the broadsheet press. The book went on to sell 11,000 copies and appear in an American edition in 1969. According to Nicholas Johnson, it took &quot;half a lifetime for his reputation to recover&quot;.

===1970s===
After the Hutchinson controversy, MacSweeney started his own press, the Blacksuede Boot. His work became increasingly experimental. It was published in widely available volumes by Fulcrum and Trigram, and in limited editions by Ted Kavanagh, Turret Books, and others. His sequence &quot;Brother Wolf&quot; in 1972 focused on the life of Thomas Chatterton, who would remain an important influence. In the same year he began working at the National Maritime Museum in Greenwich as a conservator of paintings. He was particularly enthusiastic about the work of John Everett, whom he commemorated in poems collected in &quot;Odes&quot;. However, an interview with Eric Mottram recalls that working conditions were poor and MacSweeney worried about his eyesight, so that he returned to journalism in 1973. Luke Roberts has argued that MacSweeney&#x27;s sequence &quot;Toad Church&quot; was much influenced by the Maritime Museum setting and by the work of French poets like Jules Laforgue and Arthur Rimbaud.

MacSweeney married the poet Elaine Randell in 1973. Together they continued to edit Blacksuede Boot, publishing work by Prynne, Crozier, Ian Patterson, and Nicholas Moore. During this period, MacSweeney was much involved in the National Union of Journalists, participating in strikes in 1974 and 1975. This trade union work was reflected in the long poem &quot;Black Torch&quot;, an ambitious narrative, dialect work about miners&#x27; strikes, published by Allen Fisher&#x27;s New London Pride Editions in 1978.

He was also involved in the &quot;Poetry Wars&quot; around the National Poetry Society, supporting the Mottram-led experimental poetry faction. MacSweeney was briefly Chairman of the Society in 1977, leading the final walk-out over Arts Council Policy and the funding of &quot;Poetry Review&quot;.

===1980s===
MacSweeney and Randell separated in 1979. Inspired by punk, MacSweeney began work on a series of &quot;State of the Nation&quot; Bulletins, including &quot;Colonel B&quot;, &quot;Jury Vet&quot;, &quot;Liz Hard&quot;, and &quot;Wild Knitting&quot;. These often violent and obscene works remain divisive. For Peter Riley, they are &quot;the central disaster in Barry&#x27;s career&quot;. Other critics, including John Wilkinson, Marianne Morris, William Rowe, and Luke Roberts, have argued for the political significance of this writing, as an attack on Margaret Thatcher&#x27;s Conservative government and a response to the ABC Trial and forms of state violence such as the Falklands War and the Troubles. MacSweeney married for a second time in 1983, but was divorced soon after. He moved to Bradford in 1983, and was present as a reporter at the Bradford City stadium fire in 1985.

His long work &quot;Ranter&quot;, based loosely on the ancient Irish Buile Shuibhne, was published by Slow Dancer Press in 1985. In a review for &quot;Reality Studios&quot;, Maggie O&#x27;Sullivan noted it &quot;places him right in the dynamic of English poetry, right in there up to his head, in the real and vital bloodstream of Blake, Shelley, Clare, and Bunting.&quot; Although MacSweeney published very little for the rest of the decade, he continued to work on a long poem titled &quot;No Mercy&quot;, which he was unable to complete to his satisfaction. A recording of him reading the poem in 1988 is available online.

===1990s===
After years of relative silence, MacSweeney re-emerged in 1993 with &quot;Hellhound Memos&quot; and selected poems in &quot;Tempers of Hazard&quot;, joining Thomas A. Clark and Chris Torrance. After the Paladin Poetry Series was incorporated into HarperCollins, the list was pulped. His struggles with alcoholism became more acute, leading to frequent hospitalisation and medical treatment. In 1995, Equipage published &quot;Pearl&quot;, collecting poems set in the Sparty Lea of MacSweeney&#x27;s youth, where he taught a mute girl to read and write. This was followed by &quot;The Book of Demons&quot;, which was a Poetry Book Society recommendation. He won a Paul Hamlyn award in 1997. S. J. Litherland, MacSweeney&#x27;s partner for much of the 1990s, has written extensively about her life with him in the north-east. In the last nine months of his life he acted as mentor and editor to the West Cumbrian poet Emma McGordon, and relaunched the Blacksuede Boot Press to publish her first pamphlet collection &quot;The Hangman &amp; the Stars&quot;, just two weeks before his death.

MacSweeney died from alcohol-related ill health on 9 May 2000 at his home in Denton Burn, Newcastle. His papers and library were donated posthumously to the Special Collections Library at Newcastle University.

==Posthumous publications==
At the time of his death, MacSweeney was working on a new &quot;Selected Poems&quot;, which was published in 2003 by Bloodaxe as &quot;Wolf tongue: Selected Poems, 1965-2000&quot;. The following year his &quot;collaboration&quot; with Guillaume Apollinaire, &quot;Horses in Boiling Blood&quot;, was issued by Equipage. In 2013, Paul Batchelor edited a selection of critical essays, &quot;Reading Barry MacSweeney&quot;. In 2018, Shearsman Books brought out &quot;Desire Lines: Unselected Poems, 1966–2000&quot;, which collects the material left out of the earlier volume alongside previously unpublished sequences.

<text>Rebecca Marjorie Proops OBE (formerly Rayle, née Israel; 10 August 1911 – 10 November 1996) was a journalist and agony aunt in the United Kingdom, writing the column &quot;Dear Marje&quot; for the &quot;Daily Mirror&quot; newspaper.

Proops was born in Woking, Surrey, as the elder daughter of Alfred (a publican) and Martha Israel (née Rayle). Alfred Israel later had the family name changed to Rayle. The family moved to London and Proops was educated at Dalston County Grammar School. She excelled at English and art, and had a fine contralto voice. Her teachers, nevertheless, advised her against matriculation. Instead, she took a drawing course that enabled her to get a job in a studio near Smithfield. In 1935, she married Sidney Joseph Proops, with whom she had a son, Robert.

In 1939, Proops became a journalist. Her first job was as fashion correspondent for the &quot;Daily Mirror&quot;. Following the death of the problem page editor, Proops was given the job of reading and answering her correspondence, and soon became the agony aunt herself, a post she held until her own death. As well as being an adviser, she used her column to campaign for numerous causes. One that she advocated for was the establishment of special &quot;suites&quot; for the treatment and interviewing of rape victims, to minimise the stigma of reporting such crimes.

Her radio appearances included a guest spot on the BBC Radio 4 comedy programme &quot;Just a Minute&quot;. Her book &quot;Pride, Prejudice and Proops (Time Remembered)&quot; was published in 1975, followed by &quot;Dear Marje&quot; a year later.

In 1971 Gilbert O&#x27;Sullivan mentioned her in his second single &quot;Underneath The Blanket Go&quot;.

In 1983 &quot;The Gymslips&quot; wrote a song about her articles titled &quot;Dear Marje&quot;.

She was appointed OBE in 1969, awarded Woman of the Year in 1984, had a waxwork in Madame Tussauds in 1977 and in 1971 appeared on &quot;This is Your Life&quot;. In 2008 it was reported that a BBC biopic drama about her life was in production.

Proops died on 10 November 1996, aged 85. She is buried at Golders Green Jewish Cemetery, in London, England.

<text>Community informatics (CI) is an interdisciplinary field that is concerned with using information and communication technology (ICT) to empower members of communities and support their social, cultural, and economic development.
Community informatics may contribute to enhancing democracy, supporting the development of social capital, and building well connected communities; moreover, it is probable that such similar actions may let people experience new positive social change. In community informatics, there are several considerations which are the social context, shared values, distinct processes that are taken by members in a community, and social and technical systems. It is formally located as an academic discipline within a variety of academic faculties including information science, information systems, computer science, planning, development studies, and library science among others and draws on insights on community development from a range of backgrounds and disciplines. It is an interdisciplinary approach interested in using ICTs for different forms of community action, as distinct from pure academic study about ICT effects.

Most humans live in communities. In some urban areas, community and neighborhood are conflated but this may be a limited definition. Communities are defined as people coming together in pursuit of common aims or shared practices through any means, including physical, electronic, and social networks. They proliferate even while the ability to define them is amorphous.

Cultures ensure their growth and survival by continuing the norms and mores that are the bases of their way of life. Communities can use the infrastructure of ICTs as a method of continuing cultures within the context of the Internet and the World Wide Web. Once a cultural identity is defined within the context of these technologies, it can be replicated and disseminated through various means, including the sharing of information through websites, applications, databases, and file sharing. In this manner, a group that defines its cultural identity within the construct of technology infrastructure is empowered to hold valuable exchanges within the spheres of economics, political power, high and popular culture, education, and entertainment.

Since the inception of the Internet and the World Wide Web, we have seen the exponential growth of enterprises ranging from electronic commerce, social networking, entertainment and education, as well as a myriad of other contrivances and file exchanges that allow for an ongoing cultural enrichment through technology. However, there has been a general lag as to which populations can benefit through these services through impediments such as geographic location, a lack of funds, gaps in technology and the expertise and skills that are required to operate these systems.

To date there has been very considerable investment in supporting the electronic development of business communities, one-to-many social tools (for example, corporate intranets, or purpose-built exchange and social networking services such as eBay, or Myspace), or in developing applications for individual use. There is far less understanding, or investment in human-technical networks and processes that are intended to deliberately result in social change or community change, particularly in communities for whom electronic communication is secondary to having an adequate income or social survival.

The communal dimension (and focus of Community Informatics) results in a strong interest in studying and developing strategies for how ICTs can enable and empower those living in physical communities. This is particularly the case in those communities where ICT access is done communally, through Telecentres, information kiosks, community multimedia centres, and other technologies. This latter set of approaches has become of very considerable interest as Information and Communications Technology for Development (ICT4D) has emerged as significant element in strategic (and funding) approaches to social and economic development in Less Developed Countries. ICT4D initiatives have been undertaken by public, NGO and private sector agencies concerned with development such as the United Nations Development Program, the World Bank, the Swiss Agency for Development and Cooperation (SDC), the MS Swaminathan Research Foundation; have emerged as a key element in the poverty alleviation component of the UN&#x27;s Millennium Development Goals; and as important directions for private sector investment both from a market perspective (cf. the &quot;Bottom of the Pyramid&quot;) and from companies concerned with finding a delivery channel for goods and services into rural and low income communities.

While the progress of ICT4D has been remarkably fast in general as communities become more information-based, digital divide appears to be a great challenge to its proponents. Although access to information technology in North America and Europe is high, it is the complete opposite in other regions of the world, particularly in Africa and in some parts of Asia. For instance, in the ASEAN region alone, there are countries who are leaders in digital technology such as Singapore, Malaysia, and Thailand while on the other side of the pole are countries who have very poor access to and development in digital technology including Cambodia, Lao PDR, Myanmar, and Vietnam. The effectiveness of ICT as a tool for development is highly contingent on the capacity of all countries to accommodate and maintain information and communications technology.

There is thus growing interest in Community Informatics as an approach to understanding of how different ICTs can enable and empower marginalized communities to achieve their collective goals.

==Understanding communities==
It is crucial to know how communities are formed and evolved and how the participation to a community occurs and differs while formation process. Understanding the nature of communities and the participation process will surely ensure designing and implementing a successful ICT solution that benefits members of community while communicating with each other or performing certain tasks. The following points include a brief description of the nature of each potential community formation.

===Community as a place===
A group of people may form a community according to the place in which they live, enjoy staying, and work. They usually participate in communities within these three places since they gather together on consistent basis so that it is highly expected that such community is formed. Beside the home and the work gathering, people usually like to spend their time at informal places called third places in where they meet their new or old friends or have a chance to meet new people.

===Community as a socio-spatial entity===
A group of people may form a community as they have frequent direct interactions or live in close proximity to each other. The members of such community may have strong bond and focused common goals which give them a higher status over other communities. Moreover, as the number of the members increases, the community may become reputable and has a higher status over other communities.

===Community as links between people===
A group of people may form a community as they have common shared identity. People may form such community to support and advocate common shared values, morals or norms in which they believe. Such a community may have a set of symbols and be associated with a status over other communities. The inclusion and the exclusion to such community depend on whether or not a member share the same identity with others in the community. For instance, people who descend from one origin may form a community in which only people from that origin can join the community even though they do not know each other in advance.

===Community of interests===
A group of people may form a community as they have similar affinity for a particular activity, experience, or subject. The geographical location is not necessary while forming such community, and the inclusion and the exclusion to such community depends on whether a new member has that affinity or not.

===Communities linked to life stage===
A group of people may form a community if they share a similar experience in a distinct life stage. The experience could be related to the members themselves or to their relatives, such as their children. For instance, parents of elementary school children may form a community in which they care about their children while in school. As it is mentioned in the previous type of community formation, the members of such community have a common interest which is caring about their children while in school. This type of community may persist over time, but the inclusion and the exclusion to it may happen consistently as people are no longer in that distinct life stage.

===Communities of practice===
A group of people who share a similar profession may form a community in which they work to attain their goals and advance in their profession. Three important concepts are considered while forming community of practice which are mutual engagement, joint enterprise, and shared repertoire. In a community of practice, the members have to be mutually engaged with each other by establishing collaborative relationships that will allow them to willingly work on certain joint activities. In the second concept which is joint enterprise, the members of a community of practice are supposed to discuss and agree upon the work responsibilities so that they can work in harmony, and each member knows his responsibility and his expected contributions to the community. In addition to these two concepts, the members of the community of practice have a shared repertoire of procedures or ways to perform certain tasks. They usually agree upon these procedures and practices that they establish and develop over time.

== Conceptual approaches ==
As an academic discipline, CI can be seen as a field of practice in applied information and communications technology. Community informatics is a technique for looking at economic and social development within the construct of technology—online health communities, social networking websites, cultural awareness and enhancement through online connections and networks, electronic commerce, information exchanges, as well as a myriad of other aspects that contributes to creating a personal and group identity. The term was brought to prominence by Michael Gurstein. Michael Gurstein says that community informatics is a technology strategy or discipline that connects at the community level economic and social development with the emergence of community and civic networks, electronic commerce, online participation, self-help, virtual health communities, &quot;Tele-centres&quot;, as well as other types of online institutions and corporations. He brought out the first representative collection of academic papers, although others, such as Brian Loader and his colleagues at the University of Teesside used the term in the mid-1990s.

CI brings together the practices of community development and organization, and insights from fields such as sociology, planning, computer science, critical theory, women&#x27;s studies, library and information sciences, management information systems, and management studies. Its outcomes—community networks and community-based ICT-enabled service applications—are of increasing interest to grassroots organizations, NGOs and civil society, governments, the private sector, and multilateral agencies among others. Self-organized community initiatives of all varieties, from different countries, are concerned with ways to harness ICT for social capital, poverty alleviation and for the empowerment of the &quot;local&quot; in relation to its larger economic, political and social environments. Some claim it is potentially a form of &#x27;radical practice&#x27;.

Community informatics may in fact, not gel as a single field within the academy, but remain a convenient locale for interdisciplinary activity, drawing upon many fields of social practice and endeavour, as well as knowledge of community applications of technology. However, one can begin to see the emergence of a postmodern &quot;trans-discipline&quot; presenting a challenge to existing disciplinary &quot;stove-pipes&quot; from the perspectives of the rapidly evolving fields of technology practice, technology change, public policy and commercial interest. Whether or not such a &quot;trans-discipline&quot; can maintain its momentum remains to be seen given the incertitude about the boundaries of such disciplines as community development.

Furthermore, there is a continuing disconnect between those coming from an Information Science perspective for whom social theories, including general theories of organisation are unfamiliar or seemingly irrelevant to solving complex &#x27;technical&#x27; problems, and those whose focus is upon the theoretical and practical issues around working with communities for democratic and social change
Given that many of those most actively involved in early efforts were academics, it is only inevitable that a process of &quot;sense-making&quot; with respect to these efforts would follow from &quot;tool-making&quot; efforts. These academics, and some community activists connected globally through the medium.

A first formal meeting of researchers with an academic interest in these initiatives was held in conjunction with the 1999 Global Community Networking Conference in Buenos Aires, Argentina. This meeting began the process of linking community-based ICT initiatives in developed countries with initiatives undertaken in developing countries, which were often part of larger economic and social development programmes funded by agencies such as the UN Development Programme, World Bank, or the International Development Research Centre. Academics and researchers interested in ICT efforts in developed countries began to see common and overlapping interests with those interested in similar work in less developed countries. For example, the issue of sustainability as a technical, cultural, and economic problem for community informatics has resulted in a special issue of the Journal of Community Informatics as well as the subject of ongoing conferences in Prato, Italy and other conferences in South Africa.

In Canada, the beginnings of CI can be recognized from various trials in community networking in the 1970s (Clement 1981). An essential development occurred in the 1990s, due to the change of cost of computers and modems. Moreover, examples of using computer networking to initiate and enhance social activities was acknowledged by women&#x27;s groups (Balka 1992) and by the labor movement (Mazepa 1997).

===Social informatics beyond an immediate concern for a community===
Social informatics refers to the body of research and study that examines social aspects of computerization—including the roles of information technology in social and organizational change, the uses of information technologies in social contexts, and the ways that the social organization of information technologies is influenced by social forces and social practices. Historically, social informatics research has been strong in the Scandinavian countries, the UK and Northern Europe. In Europe some researchers have pointed out that in order to create awareness of the importance of social issues of computing, one has to focus on didactics of social informatics.
Within North America, the field is represented largely through independent research efforts at a number of diverse institutions. Social informatics research diverges from earlier, deterministic (both social and technological) models for measuring the social impacts of technology. Such technological deterministic models characterized information technologies as tools to be installed and used with a pre-determined set of impacts on society dictated by the technology&#x27;s stated capabilities. Similarly, the socially deterministic theory represented by some proponents of the social construction of technology (SCOT) or social shaping of technology theory see technology as the product of human social forces.

== Criticisms ==
There is a tension between the practice and research ends of the field. To some extent this reflects the gap, familiar from other disciplines such as community development, community organizing and community based research. In addition, the difficulty that Information Systems has in recognising the qualitative dimension of technology research means that the kind of approach taken by supporters of community informatics is difficult to justify to a positive field oriented towards solutions of technical, rather than social problems. This is a difficulty also seen in the relationship between strict technology research and management research. Problems in conceptualising and evaluating complex social interventions relying on a technical base are familiar from community health and community education. There are long-standing debates about the desire for accountable – especially &quot;quantifiable&quot; and outcome-focused social development, typically practised by government or supported by foundations, and the more participatory, qualitatively rich, process-driven priorities of grass-roots community activists, familiar from theorists such as Paulo Freire, or Deweyan pragmatism.

Some of the theoretical and practical tensions are also familiar from such disciplines as program evaluation and social policy, and perhaps paradoxically, Management Information Systems, where there is continual debate over the relative virtue and values of different forms of research and action, spread around different understandings of the virtues or otherwise of allegedly &quot;scientific&quot; or &quot;value-free&quot; activity (frequently associated with &quot;responsible&quot; and deterministic public policy philosophies), and contrasted with more interpretive and process driven viewpoints in bottom-up or practice driven activity. Community informatics would in fact probably benefit from closer knowledge of, and relationship to, theorists, practitioners, and evaluators of rigorous qualitative research and practice.

A further concern is the potential for practice to be &quot;hijacked&quot; by policy or academic agendas, rather than being driven by community goals, both in developed and developing countries. The ethics of technology intervention in indigenous or other communities has not been sufficiently explored, even though ICTs are increasingly looked upon as an important tool for social and economic development in such communities. Moreover, neither explicit theoretical positions nor ideological positioning has yet emerged. Many projects appear to have developed with no particular disciplinary affiliation, arising more directly from policy or practice imperatives to &#x27;do something&#x27; with technology as funding opportunities arise or as those at the grassroots (or working with the grassroots) identify ICT as possible resources to respond to local issues, problems or opportunities. The papers and documented outcomes (as questions or issues for further research or elaboration) on the wiki of the October 2006 Prato conference demonstrate that many of the social, rather than technical issues are key questions of concern to any practitioner in community settings: how to bring about change; the nature of authentic or manufactured community; ethical frameworks; or the politics of community research.

A different strain of critique has emerged from gender studies. Some theorists have argued that feminist contributions to the field have yet to be fully acknowledged and Community Informatics as a research area has yet to welcome feminist interventions. This exists despite the presence of several gender-oriented studies and leadership roles played by women in community informatics initiatives.

== Research and practice interests ==


Research and practice ranges from concerns with purely virtual communities; to situations in which virtual or online communication are used to enhance existing communities in urban, rural, or remote geographic locations in developed or developing countries; to applications of ICTs for the range of areas of interest for communities including social and economic development, environmental management, media and &quot;content&quot; production, public management and e-governance among others. A central concern, although one not always realized in practice is with &quot;enabling&quot; or &quot;empowering&quot; communities with ICT that is, ensuring that the technology is available for the community. This further implies an approach to development which is rather more &quot;bottom up&quot; than &quot;top down&quot;.

Areas of concern range from small-scale projects in particular communities or organizations which might involve only a handful of people, such as telecentres; an on online community of disabled people; civic networks and to large national, government sponsored networking projects in countries such as Australia and Canada or local community projects such as working with Maori families in New Zealand. The Gates Foundation has been active in supporting public libraries in countries such as Chile. An area of rapidly developing interest is in the use of ICT as a means to enhance citizen engagement as an &quot;e-Governance&quot; counterpart (or counterweight) to transaction oriented initiatives.

A key conceptual element and framing concept for Community Informatics is that of &quot;effective use&quot; introduced initially by Michael Gurstein in a critique of a research pre-occupation with the Digital Divide as ICT &quot;access&quot;. CI is concerned with how ICTs are used in practice and not simply facilitating &quot;access&quot; to them and the notion of &quot;effective use&quot; is a bridge between CI research (research and analysis of the constituent elements of effective use), CI policy (developing enabling structures and programmes supportive of &quot;effective use&quot;) and practice (implementing applications and services in support of local communities).

Another way to understand CI is Clement and Shade&#x27;s &quot;access rainbow&quot; (Clement and Shade 2000). Clement and Shade have contended that accomplishing insignificant specialized connectedness to the Internet is no assurance that an individual or group will prevail with regards to appropriating new ICTs in ways that advance their improvement, independence, or empowerment. It is an approach which has multi-layered socio-specialized model for universal access to ICTs. It is displayed as seven layers, starting with the fundamental technical components of connectedness and moving upward through layers that inexorably push the essential social framework of access. The seven layers are:

7. Governance

6. Literacy / Social facilitation

5. Service / Access providers

4. Content / Services

3. Software tools

2. Devices

1. Carriage

Even though all elements are important, the most important one is the content /service layer in the middle, since this is where the actual utility is most direct. The upper layers focus on social dimensions and the lower layers focus on technical aspects.

Many practitioners would dispute any necessary connection to university research, regarding academic theorising and interventions as constraining or irrelevant to grassroots activity which should be beyond the control of traditional institutions, or simply irrelevant to practical local goals.

Some of the commonalities and differences may be in fact be due to national and cultural differences. For example, the capacity of many North American (and particularly US) universities to engage in service learning as part of progressive charters in communities large and small is part of a long-standing tradition absent elsewhere. The tradition of service learning is almost entirely absent in the UK, Australia, or New Zealand, (and of limited significance in Canada) where the State has traditionally played a much stronger role in the delivery of community services and information.

In some countries such as the UK, there is a tradition of locally based grassroots community technology, for example in Manchester, or in Hebden Bridge. In Italy and the Netherlands, there also appears to have been a strong connection between the development of local civic networks based around a tradition of civic oppositionism, connected into the work of progressive academics.

In Latin America, Africa and many parts of Asia these efforts have been driven by external funding agencies as part of larger programs and initiatives in support of broader economic and social development goals. However, these efforts have now become significantly &quot;indigenized&quot; (and particularly in Latin America) and &quot;bottom-up&quot; ICT efforts are increasingly playing a leading role in defining the future use of ICT within local communities.

In Canada, The Canadian Research Alliance for Community Innovation and Networking (CRACIN) was established in 2003. Their goal is to explore and archive the status and achievements of CI activities in Canada. It is a research partnership between scholastics, specialists, and public sector delegates.

== Networks ==
There are emerging online and personal networks of researchers and practitioners in community informatics and community networking in many countries as well as international groupings. The past decade has also seen conferences in many countries, and there is an emerging literature for theoreticians and practitioners including the on-line Journal of Community Informatics.

It is surprising in fact, how much in common is found when people from developed and non-developed countries meet. A common theme is the struggle to convince policy makers of the legitimacy of this approach to developing electronically literate societies, instead of a top-down or trickle-down approach, or an approach dominated by technical, rather than social solutions which in the end, tend to help vendors rather than communities. A common criticism that is frequently raised amongst participants at events such as the Prato conferences is that a focus on technical solutions evades the social changes that communities need to achieve in their values, activities and other people-oriented outcomes in order to make better use of technology.

The field tends to have a progressive bent, being concerned about the use of technology for social and cultural development connected to a desire for capacity building or expanding social capital, and in a number of countries, governments and foundations have funded a variety of community informatics projects and initiatives, particularly from a more tightly controlled, though not well-articulated social planning perspective, though knowledge about long-term effects of such forms of social intervention on use of technology is still in its early stages.

=== Public libraries and community networks===
Even though that community networks and public libraries have similitudes in various ways, there are some obstacles that upset the probability of cooperation in the future between them. Albeit both CNs and libraries are concerned with giving information services to the society, an exchange is by all accounts lacking between the two communities. The mission of libraries is frequently rather barely engaged and, with regards to managing people and different institutes, their methodology can be to some degree unbending. Thusly, CN specialists, while institutionally more adaptable, rush to expel the part of public libraries in the community, tending to see the library essentially as a store of books upheld by public subsidizing. Public libraries have a long-standing custom of association with their communities, yet their conditions and concerns contrast from those of community networks (CNs).

<text>Brigadier General Arnold Nugent Strode Strode-Jackson, (5 April 1891 – 13 November 1972) was a British athlete, British Army officer, and a barrister. He was the winner of the 1500 m at the 1912 Summer Olympics, in what was hailed at the time as &quot;the greatest race ever run&quot;. He was a brigadier general and amongst the most highly decorated British general officers of the First World War.

==Early life==
He was born Arnold Nugent Strode Jackson at Addlestone, Surrey, changing his surname to Strode-Jackson on 31 March 1919 (as noted in &quot;The London Gazette&quot; of 1 April 1919). He was the son of Morton Strode Jackson and Edith Rosine Martin and grandson of Lieutenant General George Jackson.

His uncle was Clement Jackson, athlete, academic, bursar of Hertford College, Oxford, and co-founder of the Amateur Athletic Association. His sister was the novelist Myrtle Beatrice Strode Strode-Jackson.

He was educated at Malvern College, where he was head of his house and head of the athletics team, and there he acquired the nickname &quot;Jackers&quot;. Jackson entered Brasenose College, Oxford in 1910, where he took a degree in law.

==Athletic career==

Jackson rowed and played football and hockey for Brasenose College, being captain of the hockey team. He won the mile race for Oxford against Cambridge three times. He was President of the Oxford University Athletic Club.

In 1912, while still an undergraduate, Jackson cut short his fishing holiday in Norway and travelled by train to compete in that year&#x27;s Olympic Games in Sweden. He had to compete as a private entry, not having been chosen by the Great Britain team, along with his friend from Cambridge, Philip Baker, another private entry. This was the last Olympics at which such private entries were allowed. Even when compared to the amateurish race preparation of the era, Jackson&#x27;s training regime of massage, golf and walking seemed very relaxed.

At Stockholm, American hopes were high to win a gold in 1500 m, as the USA was successful in mile racing at that time, and seven of the runners in the final were from the USA. The race started at a modest 65 second pace, until Norman Taber took the lead and increased the pace. At the bell for the final lap, Abel Kiviat, a world record holder in 1500 m, was first, followed by Taber and John Paul Jones, the mile world record holder. On the final turn, Mel Sheppard and Jackson also joined the crowd on his heels, with Sweden&#x27;s Ernst Wide closing fast. The three Americans ran abreast, so Jackson had to run wide. With 50 yards left, Jackson came even with Kiviat and Taber as Jones and Wide started to fade. Jackson summoned one last burst and captured the gold in 3:56.8, an Olympic record. Kiviat and Taber both clocked 3:56.9, and the photo had to be reviewed before officials handed the silver to Kiviat. Baker finished sixth. At the time, it was widely acclaimed as being &quot;the greatest race ever run&quot;. Aged 21, Jackson was the youngest ever Olympic 1500 m gold medalist until Asbel Kiprop in 2008, aged 19.

==Military career==
At the outbreak of the First World War in August 1914, Jackson was commissioned in the Loyal North Lancashire Regiment and, in September 1914, was attached to the 13th (Service) Battalion, Rifle Brigade as a Second lieutenant. In December 1914, he was promoted to temporary Lieutenant. He went over to France with the battalion and was promoted to Captain on 1 July 1916. He was made an acting Major by the time of his first Distinguished Service Order (DSO) on 4 June 1917. On 30 August 1917 he was transferred as acting Lieutenant-Colonel to take command of 13th (Service) Battalion, King&#x27;s Royal Rifle Corps, whose CO had just been killed. He commanded the battalion during the latter stages of the Battle of Passchendaele and the German spring offensive and was made a full lieutenant colonel in May 1918. He was wounded in the right arm during the battalion&#x27;s attack on Achiet-le-Grand and Bihucourt on 23 August and left the battalion. He was promoted to acting Brigadier-General in October 1918.

The war put an end to his sporting career, for he was wounded three times and left permanently lame.

===Medals and honours===
He was awarded his DSO and three Bars, with citations from &quot;The London Gazette&quot;, as follows:

*DSO awarded 4 June 1917, general citation.
*1st Bar awarded on 18 July 1917, &quot;for conspicuous gallantry during lengthy operations, when he assumed command of the battalion and, although wounded on two separate occasions, was able to carry out most valuable work. By his skill and courage he offered a splendid example to all ranks with him.&quot;
*2nd Bar awarded on 13 May 1918 &quot;for conspicuous gallantry and devotion to duty. His battalion was subjected to an intense bombardment throughout a whole day, which caused many casualties and cut off all communication by wire with the front-line companies. He handles the situation with such skill and initiative that when the enemy attacked towards evening the casualties caused by the bombardment had been evacuated and replaced by reinforcements and communication with the front line had been re-established. It was entirely due to his powers of command and the splendid spirit with which he inspired his men that the attack on the greater part of his front was repulsed, and that the enemy, though they penetrated into parts of the front line, were counter-attacked and held at bay until the arrival of reinforcements. By his skilful dispositions he materially assisted the counter-attack which finally drove the enemy back with heavy losses and completely re-established the position.&quot;
*3rd Bar awarded on 2 December 1918, &quot;for conspicuous gallantry and brilliant leadership. During an attack by our troops Lt-Col Jackson advanced with the leading wave of his battalion, and was among the first to reach the railway embankment. The machine-gun fire against them was intense, but the gallant leading of this officer gave such impetus to the assault that the enemy¹s main line of resistance was broken. He was subsequently wounded during the work of consolidation.&quot;

Jackson was also Mentioned in Despatches six times during the war, all published in the &quot;Gazette&quot;: 15 June 1916, 23 July 1917, 21 December 1917, 24 May 1918, 28 December 1918 and 12 January 1920.

==Later life==

He was a member of the British delegation at the Paris Peace Conference, 1919 and was appointed a Commander of the Order of the British Empire for his work there. He was called to the Bar at Middle Temple.

He went on to be a member of the British Olympic Council in 1920 and a major force in the founding of the Achilles Club.

He emigrated to the United States in 1921, where he worked in industry and as a Justice of the Peace in Connecticut. He directed the first Kentucky Derby Festival in 1935. During the Second World War, he was a colonel on the staff of the Governor of Kentucky and Administration Officer of the Inspection Board of U.K. and Canada in New York and Ottawa, in charge of Inspectors and anti-sabotage precautions. He also met convoys arriving in New York and gave what help he could to returning servicemen.

He was the author of &quot;Kentucky Heyday: 1787–1827; the life and times of Kentucky&#x27;s foremost portrait painter&quot;, published in 1956, a book about the artist Matthew Jouett

He became a U.S. citizen in 1945.

After his wife Dora&#x27;s death in 1963, he returned to Oxford, where he lived until his death on 13 November 1972.

==Personal life==
In 1918, he married Dora Mooney, daughter of the late William Allen Mooney of Silver Hills, New Albany, Indiana, USA.

==Legacy==
Mike Hodd and Jack Thorington wrote a play about his life, &quot;Strode-Jackson,&quot; which premiered at the King&#x27;s Head Theatre in London in 1979.

A full-length oil painting of Jackson is prominently displayed at Vincent&#x27;s Club in Oxford, having been rescued and repaired after lying neglected for many years in a Brasenose College cellar.

<doc id="816034" wikidata="Q7563158" url="?curid=816034" title="Sophytes">
<text>Sophytes, or Saubhuti, was the name of a king in Bactria or the northwestern Indian subcontinent during the time of the Alexander&#x27;s invasion. Sophytes surrendered to Alexander and was allowed to retain his kingdom. Probably another Sophytes, who was satrap in the eastern territories conquered by Alexander the Great, minted his own coins in the Greek style circa 300 BCE. Rapson and some others have considered them as the same person.

==Sophytes the Iranian ruler==
Sophytes is described in classical sources as a ruler in the Bactria and Punjab region between the Hydraotes and the Hyphasis in the area of the Salt Range, who submitted to Alexander and was, thereby, permitted to retain his realms. He made a demonstration of four Indian dogs fighting a lion to Alexander. Sophytes is described as ruling along the Indus during the campaigns of Alexander the Great, in the Bibliotheca of Diodorus Siculus. Curtius also records an interview between the tall and handsome Sophytes and Alexander.

Sophytes is mentioned by Diodorus (XVII.91-92), Curtius (IX.1.24-35) and Arrian (VI.3).

==Sophytes the satrap==

Possibly another Sophytes is also known from his abundant Greek coinage dated circa 300 BCE. Little is known about him and hypotheses are numerous: Sophytes may have been a Hellenistic satrap who replaced Stasanor in Bactria-Sogdiana, or may have ruled in a neighboring area; he may also have been a Satrap of Arachosia.

His rich and formal Greek coinage is however generally considered as Bactrian due to the distribution of the finds, and due to the coin types, of Athena with owl and eagle reverses, which are a clear continuation of the Attic coinage and the preceding anonymous Bactrian coin types derived from it. The coinage of Sophytes is often dated to 305-294 BCE

Sophytes may also have been the Mauryan Empire satrap of Arachosia, succeeding Sibyrtius, after Seleucus had ceded the Hellenistic territory of Arachosia to Chandragupta Maurya in the Seleucid–Mauryan war (305–303 BCE).

==Ethnicity==

Sophytos is not a Greek name. Scholars, including Sylvain Lévi, have suggested, based on Panini, that the name Sophytes may be equated with the name Saubhūti, but there is no conclusive proof of this. It is not clear if this king Sophytes is the same as the individual named Sophytes on coins discovered in the northwest of the Indian subcontinent, or whether he was a later dynast based in Bactria. E.J. Rapson thinks that they are one and the same.

Sophytes has been subject to a lot of speculation, with Indian origin at one end of the spectrum and Greek at the other. Cunningham identifies him with the Indian King Fobnath of &quot;Sangala,&quot; (a name some read as &quot;Saka-town&quot;) while A. C. L. Carlleyle connects him with the same king&#x27;s son Suveg, which is more likely in light of the identification of Fobnath as a royal title rather than a name; potentially making him a Madra of Saka/Iranian origin. Cunningham believes the Sobii and Kathaei to have been his subjects, whom he asserts were Turanians, making them of the same stock as the Saka or Indo-Scythians. Sagala was the capital of the later Indo-Greek dynasty of Menander I for several generations, and that Menander himself struck several coins with a similar reverse, suggesting that his dynasty inherited the older king&#x27;s mints when he took the city for himself.

John D. Grainger however, identifies him as a Greek dynast; Frank L. Holt speculating that he was a mercenary captain who minted coins simply to meet the needs of his troops. In light of his coin type, he may have been a local official, installed (although he may have been an older official, reinstated or simply recognized) by Seleucus after he took the region.

Another Sophytes is known from the Kandahar Sophytos Inscription, who may or not have been related to this Sophytes.
==Alexandrian appraisal==
According to Strabo, a mining survey by Alexandrian mining engineer Gorgus of the region under the newly conquered land from Sophytes by Alexander the Great had plenty of gold and silver, implying the lack of expertise in mining technology of the Indians under Sophytes.

<doc id="816041" wikidata="Q4794149" url="?curid=816041" title="Army Group Royal Artillery">
<text>An Army Group Royal Artillery (AGRA) was a British Commonwealth military formation during the Second World War and shortly thereafter. Generally assigned to Army corps, an AGRA provided the medium and heavy artillery to higher formations within the British Army.

==Background==
The First World War had been the first artillery war, in which the British Royal Artillery (RA) advanced enormously in technological and tactical sophistication. Independent Heavy and Siege batteries of the Royal Garrison Artillery (RGA) were grouped into Heavy Artillery Groups, later termed brigades, under the command of a lieutenant-colonel, at the disposal of Army Corps. Despite much debate, no higher organisational command structure was evolved.

By the time of the Second World War, the RGA had been integrated into the RA, and brigades of heavy and siege guns became regiments of medium and heavy artillery, with more modern equipment. There was still an absence of a higher command structure, and a need for one for the central control of artillery above the division had become apparent to the British Expeditionary Force during the Battle of France in 1940 and in the early part of the Western Desert Campaign.

==Concept==
The AGRA concept was developed during Exercise Bumper held in the UK in 1941, organised by General Alan Brooke (a gunner), the commander of Home Forces, with Lieutenant-General Bernard Montgomery as chief umpire. This large anti-invasion exercise tested many of the tactical concepts that would be used by the British Army in the latter stages of the war. The RA developed what became the AGRA, a powerful artillery brigade, usually comprising three medium regiments and one field regiment, which could dominate the battlefield and have the fire power for counter-battery bombardments.

AGRAs were improvised until 26 November 1942, when they were officially sanctioned, to consist of a commander and staff to control non-divisional artillery.

==Service==
AGRAs made their debut with First Army in the Mediterranean Theatre of Operations and the concept was adopted during the North West Europe and Far East campaigns.

An AGRA usually had three medium artillery regiments, one heavy artillery regiment and one field artillery regiment. It was commanded by a brigadier and was transferred at need from corps to corps within an army. Each corps in the line usually had an AGRA and when especially heavy fire support was needed, one AGRA could be used to reinforce another, as in Operation Baytown, the initial attack on the Italian mainland, when two AGRAs fired across the Straits of Messina from Sicily or in Operation Undergo, the battle for Calais in 1944. As the British Army manpower shortage developed, the weight of fire that an AGRA could add to an attack became increasingly important.

AGRAs were not originally provided with their own Royal Electrical and Mechanical Engineers (REME) workshops, and experience proved that this was a mistake in theatres with limited support services, such as the Italian Front. Switching large groupings of artillery from one corps to another put immense strain on the corps&#x27; own REME, and later the AGRAs in Italy were provided with their own workshops, though not specifically attached to any particular AGRA.

==Commonwealth AGRAs==
Canadian corps artillery was also referred to as an AGRA and was composed of units of the Royal Canadian Artillery as well as the Royal Artillery. Canada had two AGRAs in the Second World War, one in Italy as part of I Canadian Corps and North West Europe from March 1945 and the other only in North West Europe with II Canadian Corps.

After the war, 59th AGRA appears to have been transferred to the British Indian Army in 1946, becoming 59 Army Group Royal Indian Artillery, retitled 2 Army Group RIA the following year. At Independence in 1947, the order of battle of the RIA included 1 AGRIA, 2 AGRIA and 11 AGRIA (AA). There were at least three Royal Pakistan Artillery AGRAs - 1, 2, and 3 AGRPAs. 5 Heavy AA Regiment Indian Artillery, on transfer to Pakistan, became part of 2 AGRPA.

<text>Frédéric-Louis Allamand (February 5, 1736, Payerne, Vaud – March 3, 1809, Valkenburg, South Holland) was a Swiss botanist. Born in Payerne, Switzerland, he moved to Leiden, Netherlands in 1749 to live with his uncle, Jean-Nicolas-Sébastien Allamand (1713–1787), a professor in philosophy and mathematics at Leiden University, well known naturalist, member of the Royal Society and correspondent of Benjamin Franklin. Frédéric started to study literature at the university of Leiden, however later changed to study medicine. In 1760 he joined the Dutch marine as a ship&#x27;s doctor. During his time at the marine he visited among other places Suriname and Guyana. In 1769, he married Adriana van Guericke in Brielle. Afterwards he became doctor at Catherine the Great&#x27;s court in St. Petersburg. In 1793 he returned to Leiden to work at the university.

He was a correspondent of Carl Linnaeus, and described several plant genera himself. The genus &quot;Allamanda&quot; is named in his honor.

<text>Transend Networks Pty Ltd was a Tasmanian government-owned business which operated between 1998 and 2014 as the electricity transmission network provider for Tasmania, Australia. It was formed by the disaggregation of the Hydro-Electric Commission, and ceased operation when it was merged on 1 July 2014 with the distribution division of Aurora Energy to form the combined network business TasNetworks.

Transend transmitted electricity from power stations in Tasmania and on mainland Australia (via Basslink) to its customers around the state. Transend&#x27;s customers included electricity generators, electricity retailers and major industrial customers.

Transend was a participant in Australia&#x27;s National Electricity Market (NEM). The NEM operates on an interconnected power system that extends from Queensland to South Australia. Tasmania is connected to the NEM via Basslink. Transend was a regulated monopoly that received its revenue cap from the Australian Energy Regulator.

Transend also owned and operated a telecommunications business that served customers in the electricity supply industry and in other industries.

<text>Aurora Energy is a Tasmanian Government-owned electricity retailer in Tasmania, Australia.

==History==
Aurora was formed on 1 July 1998 under the &quot;Electricity Companies Act 1997&quot; by the disaggregation of the Tasmanian Hydro Electric Commission (HEC), and is subject to the &quot;Corporations Act 2001&quot;. The company is wholly owned by the Government of Tasmania, with its two shareholders being the Minister for Energy (as the Portfolio Minister) and the State Treasurer, representing the State Government on behalf of the Tasmanian community.

The disaggregated of the Hydro-Electric Commission resulted in the formation of three separate state-owned companies: Hydro Tasmania, which generates the power; Transend Networks, which transmits it across the state; and Aurora Energy, the retail arm, which sells and distributes it to customers. This was in anticipation of Tasmania joining the National Electricity Market (NEM), which took place in May 2005.

A subsidiary company, Aurora Energy (Tamar Valley) Pty Ltd, trading as AETV Power, owned and operated the Tamar Valley Power Station in northern Tasmania using natural gas that was piped in from Victoria to generate electricity. On 1 June 2013, the power station, its customers and associated contracts were transferred to Hydro Tasmania.

In late 2005, Aurora began trialling Aurora &quot;Pay As You Go&quot;, pre-paid electricity to selected areas of Adelaide. This system involved the Payguard meter, known as a smart meter. The official launch of the product, due to the success of the trial, went ahead in May 2007 making Aurora Energy the first electricity retailer to offer the pre-payment option in South Australia. This coincided with the 10-year birthday celebration of Aurora Pay As You Go in the State of Tasmania.

In 2012, Aurora failed in its application to the Australian Energy Regulator for electricity price increases of 15.5% over the following 5 years for infrastructure investment and carbon tax implications. Instead, the Regulator limited the price rise to just 1.4% per year until 2017. One result of this was analysis of the current structure and subsequent re-structure of the business. Over the following years, a complete re-structure was undertaken, resulting in hundreds of redundancies throughout the business, from field worker level through to upper management.

Retail contestability was introduced for very large customers in 2006, and in 2007, 2008, 2009, and 2011, additional, progressively smaller consumers of electricity were opened up for competition with Aurora. In 2013, Aurora prepared for the introduction of full retail contestability, including the separation of the retail arm from the rest of the business, and readying that retail arm for the tendered sale of the customer base to two or three private enterprises in late 2013, with sale date to be 1 January 2014. The market would then be opened for additional retailers to compete for customers from 1 July 2014. As the result of a Government funded study, it was found that there would not be a benefit to the consumer at that point, and the tendering process was aborted. Although the sale of the customer base did not go ahead, the date of full retail contestability remained at 1 July 2014, and the market is now open for other entities to compete for all customers.

As a result of the prior re-structuring, Aurora delivered a bonus to customers with an average 5% drop in electricity prices.

The non-retail sections of Aurora Energy merged with Transend Networks on 1 July 2014 to become TasNetworks. The retail arm of Aurora retained its original name and continues retailing electricity and natural gas in the state.

<text>In algebra, the length of a module over a ring formula_1 is a generalization of the dimension of a vector space which measures its size. page 153 It is defined to be the length of the longest chain of submodules. For vector spaces (modules over a field), the length equals the dimension. If formula_1 is an algebra over a field formula_3, the length of a module is at most its dimension as a formula_3-vector space. 

In commutative algebra and algebraic geometry, a module over a Noetherian commutative ring formula_1 can have finite length only when the module has Krull dimension zero. Modules of finite length are finitely generated modules, but most finitely generated modules have infinite length. Modules of finite length are called Artinian modules and are fundamental to the theory of Artinian rings.

The degree of an algebraic variety inside an affine or projective space is the length of the coordinate ring of the zero-dimensional intersection of the variety with a generic linear subspace of complementary dimension. More generally, the intersection multiplicity of several varieties is defined as the length of the coordinate ring of the zero-dimensional intersection.

== Definition ==

=== Length of a module ===
Let formula_6 be a (left or right) module over some ring formula_1. Given a chain of submodules of formula_6 of the form
:formula_9
one says that formula_10 is the &quot;length&quot; of the chain. The &quot;length&quot; of formula_6 is the largest length of any of its chains. If no such largest length exists, we say that formula_6 has &quot;infinite length&quot;. Clearly, if the length of a chain equals the length of the module, one has formula_13 and formula_14

=== Length of a ring ===
The length of a ring formula_1 is the length of the longest chain of ideals; that is, the length of formula_1 considered as a module over itself by left multiplication. By contrast, the Krull dimension of formula_1 is the length of the longest chain of &quot;prime&quot; ideals.

== Properties ==

=== Finite length and finite modules ===
If an formula_1-module formula_6 has finite length, then it is finitely generated. If &quot;R&quot; is a field, then the converse is also true.

=== Relation to Artinian and Noetherian modules ===
An formula_1-module formula_6 has finite length if and only if it is both a Noetherian module and an Artinian module (cf. Hopkins&#x27; theorem). Since all Artinian rings are Noetherian, this implies that a ring has finite length if and only if it is Artinian.

=== Behavior with respect to short exact sequences ===
Supposeformula_22is a short exact sequence of formula_1-modules. Then M has finite length if and only if &quot;L&quot; and &quot;N&quot; have finite length, and we have formula_24 In particular, it implies the following two properties

* The direct sum of two modules of finite length has finite length 
* The submodule of a module with finite length has finite length, and its length is less than or equal to its parent module.

=== Jordan–Hölder theorem ===

A composition series of the module &quot;M&quot; is a chain of the form

:formula_25

such that

:formula_26

A module &quot;M&quot; has finite length if and only if it has a (finite) composition series, and the length of every such composition series is equal to the length of &quot;M&quot;.

== Examples ==

=== Finite dimensional vector spaces ===
Any finite dimensional vector space formula_27 over a field formula_3 has a finite length. Given a basis formula_29 there is the chainformula_30which is of length formula_10. It is maximal because given any chain,formula_32the dimension of each inclusion will increase by at least formula_33. Therefore, its length and dimension coincide.

=== Artinian modules ===
Over a base ring formula_1, Artinian modules form a class of examples of finite modules. In fact, these examples serve as the basic tools for defining the order of vanishing in intersection theory.

==== Zero module ====
The zero module is the only one with length 0.

==== Simple modules ====
Modules with length 1 are precisely the simple modules.

==== Artinian modules over Z ====
The length of the cyclic group formula_35 (viewed as a module over the integers Z) is equal to the number of prime factors of formula_10, with multiple prime factors counted multiple times. This follows from the fact that the submodules of formula_35 are in one to one correspondence with the positive divisors of formula_10, this correspondence resulting itself from the fact that formula_39 is a principal ideal ring.

== Use in multiplicity theory==

For the needs of intersection theory, Jean-Pierre Serre introduced a general notion of the multiplicity of a point, as the length of an Artinian local ring related to this point.

The first application was a complete definition of the intersection multiplicity, and, in particular, a statement of Bézout&#x27;s theorem that asserts that the sum of the multiplicities of the intersection points of algebraic hypersurfaces in a -dimensional projective space is either infinite or is &quot;exactly&quot; the product of the degrees of the hypersurfaces.

This definition of multiplicity is quite general, and contains as special cases most of previous notions of algebraic multiplicity.

=== Order of vanishing of zeros and poles ===

A special case of this general definition of a multiplicity is the order of vanishing of a non-zero algebraic function formula_40 on an algebraic variety. Given an algebraic variety formula_41 and a subvariety formula_27 of codimension 1 the order of vanishing for a polynomial formula_43 is defined asformula_44where formula_45 is the local ring defined by the stalk of formula_46 along the subvariety formula_27 pages 426-227, or, equivalently, the stalk of formula_46 at the generic point of formula_27 page 22. If formula_41 is an affine variety, and formula_27 is defined the by vanishing locus formula_52, then there is the isomorphismformula_53This idea can then be extended to rational functions formula_54 on the variety formula_41 where the order is defined asformula_56 which is similar to defining the order of zeros and poles in complex analysis.

==== Example on a projective variety ====
For example, consider a projective surface formula_57 defined by a polynomial formula_58, then the order of vanishing of a rational functionformula_59is given byformula_60whereformula_61For example, if formula_62 and formula_63 and formula_64 thenformula_65since formula_66 is a unit in the local ring formula_67. In the other case, formula_68 is a unit, so the quotient module is isomorphic toformula_69so it has length formula_70. This can be found using the maximal proper sequenceformula_71

==== Zero and poles of an analytic function ====
The order of vanishing is a generalization of the order of zeros and poles for meromorphic functions in complex analysis. For example, the functionformula_72has zeros of order 2 and 1 at formula_73 and a pole of order formula_33 at formula_75. This kind of information can be encoded using the length of modules. For example, setting formula_76 and formula_77, there is the associated local ring formula_45 is formula_79 and the quotient module formula_80Note that formula_81 is a unit, so this is isomorphic to the quotient moduleformula_82Its length is formula_70 since there is the maximal chainformula_84of submodules. More generally, using the Weierstrass factorization theorem a meromorphic function factors asformula_59which is a (possibly infinite) product of linear polynomials in both the numerator and denominator.

<text>Jülich (; in old spellings also known as &quot;Guelich&quot; or &quot;Gülich&quot;, , , Ripuarian: &quot;Jöllesch&quot;) is a town in the district of Düren, in the federal state of North Rhine-Westphalia, Germany. As a border region between the competing powers in the Lower Rhine and Meuse areas, the town and the Duchy of Jülich played a historic role from the Middle Ages up to the 17th century.

The town is well known in the state for being home to Forschungszentrum Jülich, one of the largest national research institutions in Europe.

== Geography ==
Jülich stands in the Rur valley on the banks of the river Rur. The town is bordered by the town of Linnich in the north, the municipality of Titz in the northeast, the municipality of Niederzier in the southeast, the municipality of Inden in the south, and by the municipality of Aldenhoven in the west. Its maximum size is 13.3 km from east to west and 10.9 km from north to south.

The highest point in Jülich is in Bourheim, 110 m above sea level (excepting Sophienhöhe, an extensive artificial mountain made up of overburden from a nearby open-pit lignite mine, the Tagebau Hambach). The lowest point, 70 m above sea level, lies in the borough of .

==Climate==
Köppen-Geiger climate classification system classifies its climate as oceanic (Cfb).

== Boroughs ==
The town of Jülich comprises 16 boroughs:

* Town centre
* Altenburg
* Bourheim
* Broich
* Daubenrath
* Güsten
* Kirchberg
* Koslar
* Lich-Steinstraß
* Mersch
* Merzenhausen
* Pattern
* Selgersdorf
* Stetternich
* Welldorf (including Serrest)

== History ==

Jülich is first mentioned in Roman times as &quot;Juliacum&quot; along an important road through the Rur valley. Fortified during the late Roman period, it was taken over by the Franks and grew to be the centre of a county which became the nucleus of a regional power. The counts and dukes of Jülich extended their influence during the Middle Ages and granted Jülich city status in 1234 (Count Wilhelm IV). During battles with the Archbishop of Cologne, Jülich was destroyed in 1239 and again in 1278.

In 1416, the city was granted fiscal independence by Duke Rainald of Jülich-Geldern. Following a fire in 1547, the city was rebuilt as an ideal city in the Renaissance style under the direction of the architect Alessandro Pasqualini. The citadel of Jülich was later visited by the French military engineer Sébastien le Prestre de Vauban and was rated exemplary.

After the ducal family line was extinguished in 1609, the Duchy of Jülich was divided in the War of the Jülich Succession; as part of that war, the fortress at Jülich was occupied by Emperor Rudolph&#x27;s forces. The 1610 siege by Dutch, Brandenburg and Palatine forces led to the surrender and withdrawal of Imperial troops. 

Jülich was occupied by the Dutch Republic until 1621-22 when the Spanish took the fortress after a five months of siege. Control of the city later fell to Palatinate-Neuburg, then the Electorate of the Palatinate (1685) and Bavaria (1777).

From 1794 to 1814, Jülich was part of France under the name of &quot;Juliers&quot;. The French added the Napoleonic bridge head to the fortifications. In 1815, Jülich became a Prussian fortification and district town. The town was subsequently administered within the Prussian Province of Jülich-Cleves-Berg (1815) and then the Rhine Province (1822). The fortification was razed in 1860.

On 16 November 1944 (World War II), 97% of Jülich was destroyed during Allied bombing, since it was considered one of the main obstacles to the occupation of the Rhineland, although the city fortifications, the bridge head and the citadel had long fallen into disuse. The ruined city was subject to heavy fighting for several months until the Allies eventually managed to cross the Ruhr on 23 February 1945. Newsreel footage exists of Supreme Commander Eisenhower at the southern entrance to the citadel.

Jülich became part of the new state of North Rhine-Westphalia after the war. From 1949 to 1956, the town centre was rebuilt along the plans of the Renaissance town.

In 1998, the state garden fair took place in Jülich. This made the extensive restoration of the bridge head fortifications and the establishment of a large leisure park, the bridge head park, possible.

Today, Jülich is mainly known for Forschungszentrum Jülich (established in 1956) and the satellite campus of the Fachhochschule Aachen (established in 1970). The town&#x27;s landmark is the Witch Tower, a city gate and remnant of the medieval city fortifications. The most impressive remnants from the past are, however, both the Napoleonic Bridgehead and the Citadel.

==Twin towns – sister cities==

Jülich is twinned with:
* Haubourdin, France (1964)
* Taicang, China (2017)

==Transport==

*BAB 4 (Düren / Jülich Interchange)
*BAB 44
**(Jülich Ost (East)/ Mersch Interchange)
**(Jülich West (West)/ Koslar Interchange)
*Rurtalbahn, literally the Rur Valley Railway (Linnich - Jülich - Düren - Heimbach)

== Culture and landmarks ==

=== Museums ===

* Historical Town Museum

=== Buildings ===
Particularly notable:
* the Witchtower (Hexenturm)
* the Citadel
* the Napoleonic Bridgehead
* the Church of the Assumption
* the Aachener Tor (lit. Aachen Gate)
* aerial towers of shortwave broadcasting facility

=== Shortwave broadcasting facility ===
In 1956 the WDR broadcaster established the first short wave transmitter near the borough of Mersch. In subsequent years this site was expanded. On September 1, 1961, this site was handed over to the German Federal Post for establishing the German foreign broadcasting service, &quot;Deutsche Welle&quot;. In the course of time 10 transmitters of 100 kilowatts were installed, and transmitting antennas were installed, consisting of enormous dipole arrays between free-standing steel framework towers. Later these transmitters were rented predominantly to non-German broadcasting organisations. In the 90&#x27;s on the area of the shortwave transmission facility a medium wave transmitter was also installed, using a long wire antenna which was mounted on a tower on the transmitter site. It was intended to be used for transmitting the programmes of radio Viva on 702 kHz, but it never went into regular service for this broadcaster. From December 6, 2004, to May 2006, the medium-wave transmitter was used to broadcast the output of the German commercial broadcaster &quot;TruckRadio&quot; on 702 kHz. In 2006 the shortwave-facilities were sold to the British entrepreneur Robert Edmiston and his Christian Vision-organization. However, on October 24, 2009, the site was shut down and antennas and transmitters were subsequently dismantled.

=== Miscellaneous ===
The reliquaries of Christina von Stommeln.

=== Sport ===

Jülich-based sports teams are TTC Jülich (table tennis, which competes in the Bundesliga, the domestic premiere league) and the SC Jülich 1910, an amateur football (soccer) club that won the German national amateur championships in 1969, 1970 and 1971.

=== Healthcare ===

St. Elisabeth Hospital

On November 19, 1891, the St. Elisabeth Hospital Jülich was opened. It was completely destroyed in World War II, but was rebuilt in 1946 and expanded over the following years: in 1950, an eye and an ENT department were set up, and in 1959 the specialist department for gynecology and obstetrics. There has been a nursing school since 1964. In 2003 an outpatient surgery center and in 2006 a new ward block were built. It is a 156-bed hospital with 300 employees.

The sponsors were from 1891 to 1963 the city of Jülich, from 1963 to 1987 the Caritas association for the diocese of Aachen, from 1987 to 2010 the Malteser St. Elisabeth gGmbH and since 2010 it has been the Caritas Trägergesellschaft West gGmbH

Rescue service
The German Red Cross and the Malteser Hilfsdienst operate the rescue service in Jülich. The district of Düren (RDKD) has commissioned them to carry out the rescue service. The rescue stations are located in Jülich (DRK) and in the district of Mersch (MHD). The emergency vehicle is at the Jülich hospital.

<text>The Port of Felixstowe, in Felixstowe, Suffolk, is the United Kingdom&#x27;s largest container port, dealing with 48% of Britain&#x27;s containerised trade. In 2017, it was ranked as 43rd busiest container port in the world and 8th in Europe, with a handled traffic of . In 2019 it was ranked the UK&#x27;s 7th busiest port.

The port is operated by the Felixstowe Dock and Railway Company, which was set up under an Act of Parliament, the Felixstowe Railway and Pier Act 1875, and so is one of the few limited companies in the UK that do not have the word &quot;Limited&quot; in their name. Much of the land on which it sits is owned by Trinity College, Cambridge, which in the 1930s bought some land near Felixstowe which included a dock that was too small to be included in the National Dock Labour Scheme. In 1967, it set up Britain&#x27;s first container terminal for £3.5m in a deal with Sea-Land Service. Because container shipping is much more economically efficient in bulk, this early start led to it becoming the UK&#x27;s largest container port, despite its previous insignificance to the shipping market.

By 1980, Felixstowe had become the largest container port in the UK. In April 1981, Dooley and Walton, two new terminals started operation. Walton was owned by the Orient Overseas Container Line(OOCL) and operated separately. The port was purchased by the P&amp;O Group in 1987.

Felixstowe is owned by Hutchison Port Holdings (HPH) Group and has always been privately owned. In 1951, Gordon Parker, an agricultural merchant, bought the Felixstowe Dock &amp; Railway Company, which at the time was handling only grain and coal. In 1976, Felixstowe was bought by European Ferries. In June 1991, P&amp;O sold Felixstowe to Hutchison Whampoa of Hong Kong for £90m. Walton terminal was amalgamated and OOCL became a 25% shareholder. In June 1994, Hutchison Whampoa&#x27;s Hutchison International Port Holdings bought out Orient Overseas International&#x27;s 25% stake in Felixstowe for £50m. On 21 August 2022, the first strike in thirty years occurred when about 1,900 Unite members walked out in a dispute over pay.

The port has its own Port of Felixstowe Police, fire, and ambulance services.

==Description==

===Terminals===
The port has two main container terminals, Trinity and Landguard, as well as a roll-on/roll-off terminal.

There is a continuous quay of over , equipped with 29 ship-to shore gantry cranes. The main navigation channel is dredged to 14.5 metres below chart datum, with a maximum depth of 15 metres alongside the quay. This allows Felixstowe to accommodate the world&#x27;s latest generation of deep-draughted post-Panamax vessels and the much larger Maersk Triple E class, launched in 2013 and capable of carrying 18,000 TEUs.

===Transport connections===
The A14 connects the port to the English Midlands and the M6, the north via the M1 and M6 and A1 and via the A12 to London. The port (as simply &quot;Felixstowe&quot;) is signed from as far away as M6 junction 1 for Rugby.

Each terminal has its own rail terminal which connects to the Felixstowe Branch Line.

===Seafarers and crew welfare===
Seafarers&#x27; welfare charity Apostleship of the Sea, which provides practical and pastoral support to seafarers, has a port chaplain based at Felixstowe port.

==Current developments==

===Felixstowe South===
In 2008, work began on the construction and reconfiguration of Felixstowe South terminal creating 1,300 m of quay served by 12 new ship-to-shore gantry cranes. Work will be carried out in two stages with 750 m of sea wall complete by the end of 2010 and stage which is expected to open in 2014. This new terminal will have a clearance of 16 m and gantries suited for extra large box carriers.

===Felixstowe and Nuneaton freight capacity scheme===


The railway track between Felixstowe and Nuneaton has been upgraded to allow for more freight trains by clearing the route to W10 loading gauge, allowing &#x27;Hi-cube&#x27; shipping containers to be carried between the Port of Felixstowe and the West Coast Main Line at Nuneaton. The West Coast Main Line had previously been cleared to W10 and the route from Nuneaton to Birmingham was already cleared to W12.

This work will accommodate additional freight traffic as a result of &#x27;Felixstowe South&#x27; expansion at the Port of Felixstowe. It will also allow the newer high-cube containers to be carried by train - and the percentage of these containers is expected to increase from 30% in 2007 to 50% in 2012. Network Rail completed the gauge enhancement from Ipswich to Peterborough in 2008. Work should be completed by 2014 at an estimated cost of £291 million.

===Copdock Roundabout===

As part of the Felixstowe South development, Hutchison Ports will provide financial support intended to increase capacity at the Copdock interchange (J55) between the A14 and the A12.

== 2022 dockers&#x27; strike ==
The dispute followed the Felixstowe Dock and Railway Company offering a pay increase of 5%. Unite reported that this equated to a real-terms pay cut with retail price inflation at 11.9%. In 2021, dock workers received a below inflation pay increase of 1.4%. In July 2022, Unite members at Felixstowe voted on industrial action and workers recorded a 92% yes vote on an 81% turnout. In August, dock workers walked out from the site in the first industrial action of its kind in 30 years. Coverage of the industrial action revealed that some Felixstowe dockers relied on the support of food banks and were struggling to make mortgage payments. Trade union communications by Unite used the hashtag #DockersDeserveBetter.

In a press statement, General Secretary of Unite, Sharon Graham said:
On 24 August footage and photographs recorded a port worker carrying a Unite the Union flag surfed in front of an Evergreen Marine Corp container ship. The footage was published on Twitter by trade unionist and Labour councillor Lauren Townsend and included a sample from AC/DC&#x27;s Back in Black.

<doc id="816083" wikidata="Q4596147" url="?curid=816083" title="1st Army Group Royal Artillery">
<text>1st Army Group Royal Artillery was a brigade-sized formation organised by Britain&#x27;s Royal Artillery during World War II to command medium and heavy guns. It served in the final stages of the Tunisian Campaign and throughout the Italian Campaign. It reformed in the Territorial Army in the 1950s to command air defence units.

== History ==

===Background and formation===
The need for a higher organisational command structure for medium and heavy artillery became apparent during the Battle of France and the early part of the Western Desert Campaign. The &#x27;Army Group Royal Artillery&#x27; (AGRA) concept was developed during Exercise &#x27;Bumper&#x27; held in the UK in 1941, organised by the commander of Home Forces, General Alan Brooke (himself a Gunner) with Lt-Gen Bernard Montgomery as chief umpire. This large anti-invasion exercise tested many of the tactical concepts that would be used by the British Army in the latter stages of the war. The gunnery tacticians developed the AGRAs as powerful artillery brigades, usually comprising three medium regiments and one heavy regiment, which could be rapidly moved about the battlefield, and had the punch to destroy enemy artillery with counter-battery (CB) fire. AGRAs were provided to field armies at a scale of about one per Army corps. AGRAs were improvised until 26 November 1942, when they were officially sanctioned, to consist of a commander (CAGRA) and staff to control non-divisional artillery.

===World War II===

The Headquarters (HQ) of 1st AGRA was formed at Hamilton Park, Glasgow, on 24 August 1942. It was assigned to First Army for the landings in North Africa (Operation Torch), and arrived in Tunisia in January 1943, together with 56th Heavy Regiment, equipped with 7.2-inch howitzers – the first heavy regiment of the RA to serve overseas since the Dunkirk evacuation in 1940. 1st AGRA went into action in February in support of XIX French Corps with one heavy, three medium and three field regiments under command. Later it supported V Corps in the closing stages of the campaign. It then prepared for the Allied invasion of Italy.

The make-up of an AGRA during the Italian Campaign was extremely flexible: it could include army field regiments (25-pounders), medium regiments (4.5-inch or 5.5-inch guns) and heavy regiments with 7.2-inch howitzers. It might also be augmented with 3.7-inch heavy anti-aircraft (HAA) guns loaned by the AA brigades for additional ground support fire.
1st AGRA landed in Italy in October 1943, operating with V Corps again, this time under Eighth Army. For V Corps&#x27; attack on the Sangro in November 1943, 1st AGRA contributed 51st (Midland) Medium Regiment alongside the guns of 6th AGRA for a massive artillery concentration. It transferred temporarily to X Corps in February 1944, operating on the River Garigliano.

Both 1st and 6th AGRAs supported XIII Corps in July 1944 as it approached the Gothic Line. This time the front was so wide that control of the medium guns had to be decentralised to the individual divisions, so the two AGRAs only retained two medium regiments in addition to their two heavy regiments. However, when the 2nd New Zealand Division attacked on 29 July, it was supported by a concentration including the field artillery of 6th South African Armoured and 8th Indian Divisions as well as 1st AGRA, which was responsible for coordinating CB fire. 1st AGRA was assigned to V Corps for the assault on the Gothic Line (Operation Olive) in August 1944, and remained with it for the rest of the war.

1st AGRA fought at the Battle of the Argenta Gap in early 1945, ending the war at Padua.

===Postwar===
On 1 January 1947, 1st AGRA merged with 3rd AGRA as 3 AGRA (Field) in Central Mediterranean Forces, but was disbanded by late October that year.

Reformed at Troon, Ayrshire, between 24 April and 31 May 1955 by converting 68 Anti-Aircraft Brigade (the wartime 42nd AA Brigade at Glasgow) after Anti-Aircraft Command had been abolished on 1 March. It joined British Army of the Rhine as a Corps artillery HQ in 1958. In 1959 1 AGRA Signal Squadron of the Royal Corps of Signals was redesignated 218 Signal Squadron. On 19 September 1960 1 AGRA was redesignated 1st Artillery Brigade (United Kingdom) at Hildesheim, and 218 Signal Squadron was disbanded (a new squadron with the same number as reformed in 1969).

==Insignia==
1st AGRA&#x27;s formation badge was a shield in the RA colours of blue and red, divided vertically, with a vertical yellow cannon barrel superimposed in the centre; this was also used by 3 AGRA (Field) in 1947. 1 AGRA (Field), formed in 1955, adopted a ram&#x27;s skull in black and white on a red background.

<text>Chlorpyrifos (CPS), also known as chlorpyrifos ethyl, is an organophosphate pesticide that has been used on crops, and animals in buildings, and in other settings, to kill several pests, including insects and worms. It acts on the nervous systems of insects by inhibiting the acetylcholinesterase enzyme. Chlorpyrifos was patented in 1966 by Dow Chemical Company.

Chlorpyrifos is considered moderately hazardous to humans (Class II) by the World Health Organization based on acute toxicity information dating to 1999. Exposure surpassing recommended levels has been linked to neurological effects, persistent developmental disorders, and autoimmune disorders. Exposure during pregnancy may harm the mental development of children.

In the United Kingdom, the use of chlorpyrifos was banned as of 1 April 2016 (with one minor exception).
As of 2020, chlorpyrifos and chlorpyrifos-methyl were banned throughout the European Union, where they may no longer be used.
 The EU also applied to have chlorpyrifos listed as a persistent organic pollutant under the Stockholm Convention on Persistent Organic Pollutants.
As of August 18, 2021, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) announced a ban on the use of chlorpyrifos on food crops in the United States. Most home uses of chlorpyrifos had already been banned in the U.S. and Canada since 2001.
It is banned in several other countries and jurisdictions as well. The chlorpyrifos ban on food crops is the result of a 1999 lawsuit filed by NRDC to force the EPA to take action on the riskiest pesticides, as well as five additional successful court orders obtained by Earthjustice to force the EPA to take action on a 2007 petition to ban chlorpyrifos filed by Natural Resources Defense Council and the Pesticide Action Network of North America (PANNA).

== Synthesis ==
The industrial synthesis of chlorpyrifos (3) is made by reacting 3,5,6-trichloro-2-pyridinol (TCPy) (1) with &quot;O&quot;,&quot;O&quot;-diethyl phosphorochloridothioate (2):

== Uses ==

Chlorpyrifos was used in about 100 countries around the world to control insects in agricultural, residential, and commercial settings. Its use in residential applications is restricted in multiple countries. According to Dow, chlorpyrifos is registered for use in nearly 100 countries and is annually applied to approximately 8.5 million crop acres. The crops with the most usefulness include cotton, corn, almonds, and fruit trees, including oranges, bananas, and apples.

Chlorpyrifos was first registered for use in the United States in 1965 for the control of foliage and soil-born insects. The chemical became widely used in residential settings, on golf course turf, as a structural termite control agent, and in agriculture. Most residential use of chlorpyrifos has been phased out in the United States; however, agricultural use remains common.

EPA estimated that, between 1987 and 1998, about 21 million pounds of chlorpyrifos were used annually in the US. In 2001, chlorpyrifos ranked 15th among pesticides used in the United States, with an estimated 8 to 11 million pounds applied. In 2007, it ranked 14th among pesticide ingredients used in agriculture in the United States.

=== Application ===
Chlorpyrifos is normally supplied as a 23.5% or 50% liquid concentrate. The recommended concentration for direct-spray pin point application is 0.5% and for wide area application a 0.03–0.12% mix is recommended (US).

=== Kinetics ===
Chlorpyrifos enters insects through several routes. Simon et al. 1998 report that insects are exposed to chlorpyrifos through ingesting treated food plants. They also found it to enter through skin and membranes of the respiratory system.

=== Mechanism of action ===
Like other organophosphate pesticides chlorpyrifos acts by acetylcholinesterase inhibition.

==Human toxicity==
Chlorpyrifos exposure may lead to acute toxicity at higher doses. Persistent health effects follow acute poisoning or from long-term exposure to low doses, and developmental effects appear in fetuses and children even at very small doses.

===Acute health effects===
For acute effects, the World Health Organization classifies chlorpyrifos as Class II: moderately hazardous. The oral LD50 in experimental animals is 32 to 1000 mg/kg. The dermal LD50 in rats is greater than 2000 mg/kg and 1000 to 2000 mg/kg in rabbits. The 4-hour inhalation of LC50 for chlorpyrifos in rats is greater than 200 mg/m3.

====Symptoms of acute exposure====
Acute poisoning results mainly from interference with the acetylcholine neurotransmission pathway, leading to a range of neuromuscular symptoms. Relatively mild poisoning can result in eye-watering, increased saliva and sweating, nausea, and headache. Intermediate exposure may lead to muscle spasms or weakness, vomiting, or diarrhea, and impaired vision. Symptoms of severe poisoning include seizures, unconsciousness, paralysis, and suffocation from lung failure.

Children are more likely to experience muscle weakness rather than twitching; excessive saliva rather than sweat or tears; seizures; and sleepiness or coma.

====Frequency of acute exposure====
Acute poisoning is probably most common in agricultural areas in Asia, where many small farmers are affected. Poisoning may be due to occupational or accidental exposure or intentional self-harm. Precise numbers of chlorpyrifos poisonings globally are not available. Pesticides are used in an estimated 200,000+ suicides annually with tens of thousands due to chlorpyrifos. Organophosphates are thought to constitute two-thirds of ingested pesticides in rural Asia. Chlorpyrifos is among the commonly used pesticides used for self-harm.

In the US, the number of incidents of chlorpyrifos exposure reported to the US National Pesticide Information Center shrank sharply from over 200 in the year 2000 to less than 50 in 2003, following the residential ban.

====Treatment====
Poisoning is treated with atropine and simultaneously with oximes such as pralidoxime. Atropine blocks acetylcholine from binding with muscarinic receptors, which reduces the pesticide&#x27;s impact. However, atropine does not affect acetylcholine at nicotinic receptors and thus is a partial treatment. Pralidoxime is intended to reactivate acetylcholinesterase, but the benefit of oxime treatment is questioned. A randomized controlled trial (RCT) supported the use of higher doses of pralidoxime rather than lower doses. A subsequent double-blind RCT, that treated patients who self-poisoned, found no benefit of pralidoxime, including specifically in chlorpyrifos patients.

===Tourist deaths===
Chlorpyrifos poisoning was described by New Zealand scientists as the likely cause of death of several tourists in Chiang Mai, Thailand who developed myocarditis in 2011. Thai investigators came to no conclusion on the subject, but maintain that chlorpyrifos was not responsible and that the deaths were not linked.

===Long term===

====Development====
Epidemiological and experimental animal studies suggest that infants and children are more susceptible than adults to the effects of low-dose exposure. Chlorpyrifos has been suggested to have negative impacts on cognitive functions in the developing brain. The young have a decreased capacity to detoxify chlorpyrifos and its metabolites. It is suggested that adolescents differ from adults in the metabolism of these compounds due to the maturation of organs in adolescents. This results in disruption in nervous system developmental processes, as observed in animal experiments. There are several studies observed in animals that show that chlorpyrifos alters the expression of essential genes that assist in the development of the brain.

&quot;Human studies&quot;: In multiple epidemiological studies, chlorpyrifos exposure during gestation or childhood has been linked with lower birth weight and neurological changes such as slower motor development and attention problems. Children with prenatal exposure to chlorpyrifos have been shown to have lower IQs. They have also been shown to have a higher chance of developing autism, attention deficit problems, and developmental disorders. A cohort of 7-year-old children was studied for neurological damage from prenatal exposure to chlorpyrifos. The study determined that the exposed children had deficits in working memory and full scale intelligence quotient (IQ). In a study on groups of Chinese infants, those exposed to chlorpyrifos showed significant decreases in motor functions such as reflexes, locomotion, and grasping at 9 months compared to those not exposed. Exposure to organophosphate pesticides in general has been increasingly associated with changes in children&#x27;s cognitive, behavioral and motor performance. Infant girls were shown to be more susceptible to harmful effects from organophosphate insecticides than infant boys.

&quot;Animal experiments&quot;: In experiments with rats, early, short-term low-dose exposure to chlorpyrifos resulted in lasting neurological changes, with larger effects on emotional processing and cognition than on motor skills. Such rats exhibited behaviors consistent with depression and reduced anxiety. In rats, low-level exposure during development has its greatest neurotoxic effects during the period in which sex differences in the brain develop. Exposure leads to reductions or reversals of normal gender differences. Exposure to low levels of chlorpyrifos early in rat life or as adults also affects metabolism and body weight. These rats show increased body weight as well as changes in liver function and chemical indicators similar to prediabetes, likely associated with changes to the cyclic AMP system. Moreover, experiments with zebrafish showed significant detriments to survivability, reproductive processes, and motor function. Varying doses created a 30%–100% mortality rate of embryos after 90 days. Embryos were shown to have decreased mitosis, resulting in mortality or developmental dysfunctions. In the experiments where embryos did survive, spinal lordosis and lower motor functions were observed. The same study showed that chlorpyrifos had more severe morphological deformities and mortality in embryos than diazinon, another commonly used organophosphate insecticide.

====Adulthood====
Adults may develop lingering health effects following acute exposure or repeated low-dose exposure. Among agricultural workers, chlorpyrifos has been associated with slightly increased risk of wheeze, a whistling sound while breathing due to obstruction of the airways.

Among 50 farm pesticides studied, chlorpyrifos was associated with higher risks of lung cancer among frequent pesticide applicators than among infrequent or non-users. Pesticide applicators as a whole were found to have a 50% lower cancer risk than the general public, likely due to their nearly 50% lower smoking rate. However, chlorpyrifos applicators had a 15% lower cancer risk than the general public, which the study suggests indicates a link between chlorpyrifos application and lung cancer.

Twelve people who had been exposed to chlorpyrifos were studied over periods of 1 to 4.5 years. They were found to have a heightened immune responses to common allergens and increased antibiotic sensitivities, elevated CD26 cells, and a higher rate of autoimmunity, compared with control groups. Autoantibodies were directed toward smooth muscle, parietal cell, brush border, thyroid gland, myelin, and the subjects also had more anti-nuclear antibodies.

==Chlorpyrifos methyl==
The Dow Chemical Company also developed Chlorpyrifos methyl in 1966, which had a lower acute toxicity (WHO class III), but this appears to be no longer in commercial use. The molecule is similar to Chlorpyrifos ethyl, but with a O,O dimethyl chain. Proposed applications included vector control.

==Mechanisms of toxicity==

===Acetylcholine neurotransmission===

Primarily, chlorpyrifos and other organophosphate pesticides interfere with signaling from the neurotransmitter acetylcholine. One chlorpyrifos metabolite, chlorpyrifos-oxon, binds permanently to the enzyme acetylcholinesterase, preventing this enzyme from deactivating acetylcholine in the synapse. By irreversibly inhibiting acetylcholinesterase, chlorpyrifos leads to a build-up of acetylcholine between neurons and a stronger, longer-lasting signal to the next neuron. Only when new molecules of acetylcholinesterase have been synthesized can normal function return. Acute symptoms of chlorpyrifos poisoning only occur when more than 70% of acetylcholinesterase molecules are inhibited. This mechanism is well established for acute chlorpyrifos poisoning and also some lower-dose health impacts. It is also the primary insecticidal mechanism.

===Non-cholinesterase mechanisms===
Chlorpyrifos may affect other neurotransmitters, enzymes and cell signaling pathways, potentially at doses below those that substantially inhibit acetylcholinesterase. The extent of and mechanisms for these effects remain to be fully characterized. Laboratory experiments in rats and cell cultures suggest that exposure to low doses of chlorpyrifos may alter serotonin signaling and increase rat symptoms of depression; change the expression or activity of several serine hydrolase enzymes, including neuropathy target esterase and several endocannabinoid enzymes; affect components of the cyclic AMP system; and influence other chemical pathways.

===Paraoxonase activity===
The enzyme paraoxonase 1 (PON1) detoxifies chlorpyrifos oxon, the more toxic metabolite of chlorpyrifos, via hydrolysis. In laboratory animals, additional PON1 protects against chlorpyrifos toxicity while individuals that do not produce PON1 are particularly susceptible. In humans, studies about the effect of PON1 activity on the toxicity of chlorpyrifos and other organophosphates are mixed, with modest yet inconclusive evidence that higher levels of PON1 activity may protect against chlorpyrifos exposure in adults; PON1 activity may be most likely to offer protection from low-level chronic doses. Human populations have genetic variation in the sequence of PON1 and its promoter region that may influence the effectiveness of PON1 at detoxifying chlorpyrifos oxon and the amount of PON1 available to do so. Some evidence indicates that children born to women with low PON1 may be particularly susceptible to chlorpyrifos exposure. Further, infants produce low levels of PON1 until six months to several years after birth, likely increasing the risk from chlorpyrifos exposure early in life.

===Combined exposures===

Several studies have examined the effects of combined exposure to chlorpyrifos and other chemical agents, and these combined exposures can result in different effects during development. Female rats exposed first to dexamethasone, a treatment for premature labor, for three days in utero and then to low levels of chlorpyrifos for four days after birth experienced additional damage to the acetylcholine system upstream of the synapse that was not observed with either exposure alone. In both male and female rats, combined exposures to dexamethasone and chlorpyrifos decreased serotonin turnover in the synapse, for female rats with a greater-than-additive result. Rats that were co-exposed to dexamethasone and chlorpyrifos also exhibited complex behavioral differences from exposure to either chemical alone, including lessening or reversing normal sex differences in behavior. In the lab, in rats and neural cells co-exposed to both nicotine and chlorpyrifos, nicotine appears to protect against chlorpyrifos acetylcholinesterase inhibition and reduce its effects on neurodevelopment. In at least one study, nicotine appeared to enhance chlorpyrifos detoxification.

==Human exposure==
In 2011, EPA estimated that, in the general US population, people consume 0.009 micrograms of chlorpyrifos per kilogram of their body weight per day directly from food residue. Children are estimated to consume a greater quantity of chlorpyrifos per unit of body weight from food residue, with toddlers the highest at 0.025 micrograms of chlorpyrifos per kilogram of their body weight per day. People may also ingest chlorpyrifos from drinking water or from residue in food handling establishments. The EPA&#x27;s acceptable daily dose is 0.3 micrograms/kg/day. However, as of 2016, EPA scientists had not been able to find any level of exposure to the pesticide that was safe. The EPA 2016 report states in part &quot;... this assessment indicates that dietary risks from food alone are of concern ...&quot; The report also states that previous published risk assessments for &quot;chlorpyrifos may not provide a sufficiently health protective human health risk assessment given the potential for neurodevelopmental outcomes.&quot;

Humans can be exposed to chlorpyrifos by way of ingestion (e.g., residue on treated produce, drinking water), inhalation (especially of indoor air), or absorption (i.e., through the skin). However, compared to other organophosphates, chlorpyrifos degrades relatively quickly once released into the environment. According to the National Institutes of Health, the half-life for chlorpyrifos (i.e., the period of time that it takes for the active amount of the chemical to decrease by 50%) &quot;can typically range from 33–56 days for soil incorporated applications and 7–15 days for surface applications&quot;; in water, the half-life is about 25 days, and in the air, the half-life can range from four to ten days.

Children of agricultural workers are more likely to come into contact with chlorpyrifos. A study done in an agricultural community in Washington State showed that children who lived in closer proximity to farmlands had higher levels of chlorpyrifos residues from house dust. Chlorpyrifos residues were also found on work boots and children&#x27;s hands, showing that agricultural families could take home these residues from their jobs. Urban and suburban children get most of their chlorpyrifos exposure from fruits and vegetables. A study done in North Carolina on children&#x27;s exposure showed that chlorpyrifos was detected in 50% of the food, dust, and air samples in both their homes and daycare, with the main route of exposure being through ingestion. Certain other populations with higher likely exposure to chlorpyrifos, such as people who apply pesticides, work on farms, or live in agricultural communities, have been measured in the US to excrete TCPy in their urine at levels that are 5 to 10 times greater than levels in the general population.

As of 2016, chlorpyrifos was the most used conventional insecticide in the US and was used in over 40 states; the top five states (in total pounds applied) are California, North Dakota, Minnesota, Iowa, and Texas. It was used on over 50 crops, with the top five crops (in total pounds applied) being soybeans, corn, alfalfa, oranges, and almonds. Additionally, crops with 30% or more of the crop treated (compared to total acres grown) include apples, asparagus, walnuts, table grapes, cherries, cauliflower, broccoli, and onions.

Air monitoring studies conducted by the California Air Resources Board (CARB) documented chlorpyrifos in the air of California communities. Analyses indicate that children living in areas of high chlorpyrifos use are often exposed to levels that exceed EPA dosages. A study done in Washington state using passive air samplers showed that households who lived less than 250 meters from a fruit tree field had higher levels of chlorpyrifos concentrations in the air than households that were further away. Advocacy groups monitored air samples in Washington and Lindsay, California, in 2006 with comparable results. Grower and pesticide industry groups argued that the air levels documented in these studies are not high enough to cause significant exposure or adverse effects. A follow-up biomonitoring study in Lindsay also showed that people there display above-normal chlorpyrifos levels.

==Effects on wildlife==

===Aquatic life===
Among freshwater aquatic organisms, crustaceans and insects appear to be more sensitive to acute exposure than fish. Aquatic insects and animals appear to absorb chlorpyrifos directly from water rather than ingesting it with their diet or through sediment exposure.

Concentrated chlorpyrifos released into rivers killed insects, shrimp and fish. In Britain, the rivers Roding (1985), Ouse (2001), Wey (2002 &amp; 2003), and Kennet (2013) all experienced insect, shrimp, or fish kills as a result of small releases of concentrated chlorpyrifos. The July 2013 release along the River Kennet poisoned insect life and shrimp along 15 km of the river, likely from a half a cup of concentrated chlorpyrifos washed down a drain.

===Bees===

Acute exposure to chlorpyrifos can be toxic to bees, with an oral LD50 of 360 ng/bee and a contact LD50 of 70 ng/bee. Guidelines for Washington state recommend that chlorpyrifos products should not be applied to flowering plants such as fruit trees within 4–6 days of blossoming to prevent bees from directly contacting the residue.

Risk assessments have primarily considered acute exposure, but more recently researchers have begun to investigate the effects of chronic, low-level exposure through residue in pollen and components of bee hives. A review of US studies, several European countries, Brazil and India found chlorpyrifos in nearly 15% of hive pollen samples and just over 20% of honey samples. Because of its high toxicity and prevalence in pollen and honey, bees are considered to have higher risk from chlorpyrifos exposure via their diet than from many other pesticides.

When exposed in the laboratory to chlorpyrifos at levels roughly estimated from measurements in hives, bee larvae experienced 60% mortality over 6 days, compared with 15% mortality in controls. Adult bees exposed to sub-lethal effects of chlorpyrifos (0.46 ng/bee) exhibited altered behaviors: less walking; more grooming, particularly of the head; more difficulty righting themselves; and unusual abdominal spasms. Chlorpyrifos oxon appears to particularly inhibit acetylcholinesterase in bee gut tissue as opposed to head tissue. Other organophosphate pesticides impaired bee learning and memory of smells in the laboratory.

==Regulation==

===International law===
Chlorpyrifos is not regulated under international law or treaty. Organizations such as PANNA and the NRDC state that chlorpyrifos meets the four criteria (persistence, bioaccumulation, long-range transport, and toxicity) in Annex D of the Stockholm Convention on Persistent Organic Pollutants and should be restricted. In 2021, the European Union submitted a proposal to list chlorpyrifos in Annex A to the Stockholm Convention.

===National regulations===
Chlorpyrifos was used to control insect infestations of homes and commercial buildings in Europe until it was banned from sale in 2008. Chlorpyrifos is restricted from termite control in Singapore as of 2009. It was banned from residential use in South Africa as of 2010. It has been banned in the United Kingdom in 2016 apart from a limited use in drenching seedlings.

Chlorpyrifos has not been permitted for agricultural use in Sweden at all

====United States====

In the United States, several laws directly or indirectly regulate the use of pesticides. These laws, which are implemented by the EPA, NIOSH, USDA and FDA, include: the Clean Water Act (CWA); the Endangered Species Act (ESA); the Federal Insecticide, Fungicide, and Rodenticide Act (FIFRA); the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (FFDCA); the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act (CERCLA); and the Emergency Planning and Community Right-to-Know Act (EPCRA). As a pesticide, chlorpyrifos is not regulated under the Toxic Substances Control Act (TSCA).

Chlorpyrifos is sold in restricted-use products for certified pesticide applicators to use in agriculture and other settings, such as golf courses or for mosquito control. It may also be sold in ant and roach baits with childproof packaging. In 2000, manufacturers reached an agreement with the EPA to voluntarily restrict the use of chlorpyrifos in places where children may be exposed, including homes, schools and day care centers.

In 2007 Pesticide Action Network North America and Natural Resources Defense Council (collectively, PANNA) submitted an administrative petition requesting a chlorpyrifos ban, citing harm to the brains of developing children. On 10 August 2015, the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals in PANNA v. EPA ordered the EPA to respond to PANNA&#x27;s petition by &quot;revok[ing] all tolerances for the insecticide chlorpyrifos&quot;, den[ying] the Petition or [issuing] a &quot;proposed or final tolerance revocation&quot; no later than 31 October 2015. The EPA was &quot;unable to conclude that the risk from aggregate exposure from the use of chlorpyrifos [met] the safety standard of section 408(b)(2) of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (FFDCA)&quot; and therefore proposed &quot;to revoke all tolerances for chlorpyrifos.&quot;

In an 30 October 2015 statement Dow AgroSciences disagreed with the EPA&#x27;s proposed revocation and &quot;remain[ed] confident that authorized uses of chlorpyrifos products, as directed, offer wide margins of protection for human health and safety.&quot; In a November 2016 press release, DOW argued that chlorpyrifos was &quot;a critical tool for growers of more than 50 different types of crops in the United States&quot; with limited or no viable alternatives.&quot; The &quot;Environment News Service&quot; quoted the Dow AgroSciences&#x27; statement disagreeing with the EPA findings.

In November 2016, the EPA reassessed its ban proposal after taking into consideration recommendations made by the agency&#x27;s Science Advisory Panel which had rejected the EPA&#x27;s methodology in quantifying the risk posed by chlorpyrifos. Using a different methodology as suggested by the panel, the EPA retained its decision to completely ban chlorpyrifos. The EPA concluded that, while &quot;uncertainties&quot; remain, a number of studies provide &quot;sufficient evidence&quot; that children experience neurodevelopment effects even at low levels of chlorpyrifos exposure.

On 29 March 2017, EPA Administrator Scott Pruitt, appointed by the Trump administration, overturned the 2015 EPA revocation and denied the administrative petition by the Natural Resources Defense Council and the Pesticide Action Network North America to ban chlorpyrifos.

The American Academy of Pediatrics responded to the administration&#x27;s decision saying they are &quot;deeply alarmed&quot; by Pruitt&#x27;s decision to allow the pesticide&#x27;s continued use. &quot;There is a wealth of science demonstrating the detrimental effects of chlorpyrifos exposure to developing fetuses, infants, children and pregnant women. The risk to infant and children&#x27;s health and development is unambiguous.&quot;

Asked in April whether Pruitt had met with Dow Chemical Company executives or lobbyists before his decision, an EPA spokesman replied: &quot;We have had no meetings with Dow on this topic.&quot; In June, after several Freedom of Information Act requests, the EPA released a copy of Pruitt&#x27;s March meeting schedule which showed that a meeting had been scheduled between Pruitt and Dow CEO Andrew Liveris at a hotel in Houston, Texas, on 9 March. Both men were featured speakers at an energy conference. An EPA spokesperson reported that the meeting was brief and the pesticide was not discussed.

In August, it was revealed that in fact Pruitt and other EPA officials had met with industry representatives on dozens of occasions in the weeks immediately prior to the March decision, promising them that it was &quot;a new day&quot; and assuring them that their wish to continue using chlorpyrifos had been heard. Ryan Jackson, Pruitt&#x27;s chief of staff, said in an 8 March email that he had &quot;scared&quot; career staff into going along with the political decision to deny the ban, adding &quot;[T]hey know where this is headed and they are documenting it well.&quot;

On 9 August 2018 the U.S. 9th Circuit court of Appeals ruled that the EPA must ban chlorpyrifos within 60 days from that date. A spokesman for Dow DuPont stated that &quot;all appellate options&quot; would be considered. In contrast, Marisa Ordonia, a lawyer for Earthjustice, the organization that had conducted much of the legal work on the case, hailed the decision. The ruling was almost immediately appealed by Trump administration lawyers.

On August 18, 2021 the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) announced a ban on the use of chlorpyrifos on food crops in the United States.

On February 25, 2022 the EPA released a statement upholding its decision to revoke all tolerance standards on chlorpyrifos use, and sent letters to registered chlorpyrifos food producers confirming the ban to be in effect as of February 28, 2022.

On 14 December, 2022 the EPA filed a Notice of Intent to Cancel (NOIC) for three chlorpyrifos pesticide products because they bear labeling for use on food, despite the ban.

However, on November 2, 2023 the United States Court of Appeals for the Eighth Circuit nixed a 2021 rule issued by the Environmental Protection Agency banning all neurotoxic insecticide on all food crops. The court concluded, that by deciding to ban all uses of chlorpyrifos on food plants, the EPA ignored the long standing American practice and prior court orders to evaluate each crop group on its own merits and &quot;to keep a set of high-benefit uses in place.&quot; The court ordered the EPA to reevaluate whether &quot;chlorpyrifos can be safely used on crops like sugar beets, soybeans, and certain fruits and vegetables&quot;.

Some states, including California, Hawaii, Maryland, New York, and Oregon, have banned chlorpyrifos on food grown and sold in their jurisdictions. Those bans remain in effect.

===== Residue =====
The use of chlorpyrifos in agriculture can leave chemical residue on food commodities. The FFDCA requires EPA to set limits, known as tolerances, for pesticide residue in human food and animal feed products based on risk quotients for acute and chronic exposure from food in humans. These tolerances limit the amount of chlorpyrifos that can be applied to crops. FDA enforces EPA&#x27;s pesticide tolerances and determines &quot;action levels&quot; for the unintended drift of pesticide residues onto crops without tolerances.

After years of research without a conclusion and cognizant of the court order to issue a final ruling, the EPA proposed to eliminate all tolerances for chlorpyrifos (&quot;Because tolerances are the maximum residue of a pesticide that can be in or on food, this proposed rule revoking all chlorpyrifos tolerances means that if this approach is finalized, all agricultural uses of chlorpyrifos would cease.&quot;), and then solicited comments.

The Dow Chemical Company is actively opposed to tolerance restrictions on chlorpyrifos and is currently lobbying the White House to, among other goals, pressure EPA to reverse its proposal to revoke chlorpyrifos food residue tolerances.

The EPA has not updated the approximately 112 tolerances pertaining to food products and supplies since 2006. However, in a 2016 report, EPA scientists had not been able to find any level of exposure to the pesticide that was safe. The EPA 2016 report states in part &quot;... this assessment indicates that dietary risks from food alone are of concern ...&quot; the report also states that previous published risk assessments for &quot;chlorpyrifos may not provide a [sufficient] ... human health risk assessment given the potential for neurodevelopmental outcomes.&quot;

″The ... [food only] exposures for chlorpyrifos are of risk concern ... for all population subgroups analyzed. Children (1–2 years old) is the population subgroup with the highest risk estimate at 14,000% of the ssPADfood.″ (This acronym refers to the steady-state population-adjusted dose for food, which is considered the maximum safe oral dose.)

Based on 2006 EPA rules, chlorpyrifos has a tolerance of 0.1 part per million (ppm) residue on all food items unless a different tolerance has been set for that item or chlorpyrifos is not registered for use on that crop. EPA set approximately 112 tolerances pertaining to food products and supplies. In 2006, to reduce childhood exposure, the EPA amended its chlorpyrifos tolerance on apples, grapes and tomatoes, reducing the grape and apple tolerances to 0.01 ppm and eliminating the tolerance on tomatoes. Chlorpyrifos is not allowed on crops such as spinach, squash, carrots, and tomatoes; any chlorpyrifos residue on these crops normally represents chlorpyrifos misuse or spray drift.

Food handling establishments (places where food products are held, processed, prepared or served) are included in the food tolerance of 0.1 ppm for chlorpyrifos. Food handling establishments may use a 0.5% solution of chlorpyrifos solely for spot and/or crack and crevice treatments. Food items are to be removed or protected during treatment. Food handling establishment tolerances may be modified or exempted under FFDCA sec. 408.

=====Water=====
Chlorpyrifos in waterways is regulated as a hazardous substance under section 311(b)(2)(A) of the Federal Water Pollution Control Act and falls under the CWA amendments of 1977 and 1978. The regulation is inclusive of all chlorpyrifos isomers and hydrates in any solution or mixture. EPA has not set a drinking water regulatory standard for chlorpyrifos, but has established a drinking water guideline of 2 ug/L.

In 2009, to protect threatened salmon and steelhead under CWA and ESA, EPA and National Marine Fisheries Service (NMFS) recommended limits on the use of chlorpyrifos in California, Idaho, Oregon and Washington and requested that manufacturers voluntarily add buffer zones, application limits and fish toxicity to the standard labeling requirements for all chlorpyrifos-based products. Manufacturers rejected the request. In February 2013 in Dow AgroSciences vs NMFS, the Fourth Circuit Court of Appeals vacated EPA&#x27;s order for these labeling requirements. In August 2014, in the settlement of a suit brought by environmental and fisheries advocacy groups against EPA in the U.S. District Court for the Western District of Washington, EPA agreed to re-instate no-spray stream buffer zones in California, Oregon and Washington, restricting aerial spraying (300 ft.) and ground-based applications (60 ft.) near salmon populations. These buffers will remain until EPA makes a permanent decision in consultation with NMFS.

=====Reporting =====
EPCRA designates the chemicals that facilities must report to the Toxics Release Inventory (TRI), based on EPA assessments. Chlorpyrifos is not on the reporting list. It is on the list of hazardous substances under CERCLA (aka the Superfund Act). In the event of an environmental release above its reportable quantity of 1 lb or 0.454 kg, facilities are required to immediately notify the National Response Center (NRC).

In 1995, Dow paid a $732,000 EPA penalty for not forwarding reports it had received on 249 chlorpyrifos poisoning incidents.

=====Occupational exposure=====
In 1989, OSHA established a workplace permissible exposure limit (PEL) of 0.2 mg/m3 for chlorpyrifos, based on an 8-hour time weighted average (TWA) exposure. However, the rule was remanded by the U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals and no PELs are in place presently.

EPA&#x27;s Worker Protection Standard requires owners and operators of agricultural businesses to comply with safety protocols for agricultural workers and pesticide handlers (those who mix, load and apply pesticides). For example, in 2005, the EPA filed an administrative complaint against JSH Farms, Inc. (Wapato, Washington) with proposed penalties of $1,680 for using chlorpyrifos in 2004 without proper equipment. An adjacent property was contaminated with chlorpyrifos due to pesticide drift and the property owner suffered from eye and skin irritation.

=====State laws=====
Additional laws and guidelines may apply for individual US states. California, Hawaii, Maryland, New York, and Oregon, have banned chlorpyrifos on food grown and sold in their jurisdictions. These State bans remain in effect regardless whether chlorpyrifos is allowed on the federal level or not.

Oregon&#x27;s Department of Environmental Quality added chlorpyrifos to the list of targeted reductions in the Clackamas Subbasin as part of the Columbia River National Strategic Plan, which is based on EPA&#x27;S 2006–11 National Strategic Plan.

In 2017, chlorpyrifos was included California&#x27;s Proposition 65.

California included regulation limits for chlorpyrifos in waterways and established maximum and continuous concentration limits of 0.025 ppb and 0.015 ppb, respectively. Sale and possession of chlorpyrifos have been largely banned in California, as of 6 February – 31 December 2020, respectively. The California ban has an exception that, &quot;a few products that apply chlorpyrifos in granular form, representing less than one percent of agricultural use of chlorpyrifos, will be allowed to remain on the market.&quot;

In Hawaii, a 2018 law introduced a complete ban on products containing chlorpyrifos, which went into effect on January 1, 2023. Before that, starting in 2019, the law mandated temporary application permits and annual reporting as well as mandating a 100-foot buffer around schools during school hours.

Florida did not ban chlorpyrifos completely, but introduced a concentration limit of 21 ug/L in drinking water.

In 2003, Dow agreed to pay $2 million to New York state, in response to a lawsuit to end Dow&#x27;s advertising of Dursban as &quot;safe&quot;.

==== Australia ====
Chlorpyrifos is used agriculturally in Australia but household use was restricted to low strength solutions in 2001 and banned in 2020. There are 49 registered chlorpyrifos insecticide products, mostly as 500 g/L emulsifiable concentrates.

The Australian Pesticides and Veterinary Medicine Authority&#x27;s Chlorpyrifos Chemical Review, began July 2015, made the final decision in September 2024. Chlorpyrifos will continue to be used, though many uses of it are banned. The minimum technical grade chlorpyrifos purity is raised from 94% to 97% by weight.

==== Denmark ====
Chlorpyrifos was never approved for use in Denmark, except on ornamental plants grown in greenhouses. This use was banned in 2012.

==== European Union ====

On 6 December 2019, the European Union (EU) announced that it will no longer permit sales of chlorpyrifos after 31 January 2020.

The European Food Safety Authority released a statement in July 2019 which concluded that the approval criteria for chlorpyrifos which apply to human health are not met. Their literature review concluded that there is no evidence for reproductive toxicity in rats, but that chlorpyrifos is potentially genotoxic. The report stated that chlorpyrifos is clearly a potent acetylcholinesterase inhibitor, that it can be absorbed by ingestion, inhalation, and through the skin, and that epidemiological evidence supports the hypothesis that it is a human developmental neurotoxin that can cause early cognitive and behavioral deficits through prenatal exposure.

==== India ====
The FSSAI (Food Safety and Standards Authority of India) did not set a usage limits for chlorpyrifos. In 2010, India barred Dow from commercial activity for 5 years after India&#x27;s Central Bureau of Investigation found Dow guilty of bribing Indian officials in 2007 to allow the sale of chlorpyrifos. In 2020, the Indian government had published a draft bill to ban 27 pesticides including chlorpyrifos.

==== New Zealand ====
Chlorpyrifos is currently approved in New Zealand for commercial use in crops, as a veterinary medicine, and as a timber treatment chemical.

==== Thailand ====
Chlorpyrifos was banned under Thai law effective from 1 June 2020. Farmers were given 270 days to destroy their stock, while a 90-day deadline was also given to farmers to return the chemicals for destruction, as their possession is considered illegal by the Department of Agriculture. After deadline, any person who possesses the illegal agrochemicals will be fined one million baht, jailed for 10 years, or both.

==== Malaysia ====
Chlorpyrifos was banned under by Department of Agriculture for use in farming and agriculture with effective from year 2023. However it is still permitted for general use other than agriculture purpose. 

==Manufacture==
Chlorpyrifos is produced via a multistep synthesis from 3-methylpyridine, eventually reacting 3,5,6-trichloro-2-pyridinol with diethylthiophosphoryl chloride.

<text>The Blue Star Line was a British passenger and cargo shipping company formed in 1911, being in operation until 1998.

==Formation==

Blue Star Line was formed as an initiative by the Vestey Brothers, a Liverpool-based butchers company, who had founded the Union Cold Storage Company to take advantage of refrigeration practices. They developed a large importation business, shipping frozen meat from South America to Britain, initially from Argentina on ships of the Royal Mail Steam Packet Company, and other shipping lines that called at South American ports. The high prices charged for transport by these companies led the Vestey brothers to start to operate their own ships. They chartered their first ships from 1904, and began to buy their own ships from 1909 onwards. The Blue Star Line was officially inaugurated on 28 July 1911, initially using second-hand ships. They ordered their first new ship in 1914, and by the outbreak of the First World War were operating twelve refrigerated cargo ships. These were initially prefixed &#x27;Brod&#x27;, e.g. &quot;Brodfield&quot;, &quot;Brodholme&quot; and &quot;Brodland&quot;. Ships of the company were identifiable by their red funnels with black tops and narrow white and black bands, with a white circle with blue five-pointed star on the red background. Their hull colours were either black or black with a white band, and red boot-topping.

The company supplied beef to allied forces in France during the war, and began an expansion programme after it was over. The name format was altered with the introduction of the &quot;Star&quot; suffix to ship names, starting with &quot;Royalstar&quot; launched in 1919, later renamed . The company expanded its operations to include services to the Pacific coast of North America from 1920, and Australia and New Zealand from 1933. The Blue Star Line acquired Frederick Leyland and Company in 1935 and operated it as a subsidiary.

Blue Star expanded into passenger transport, notably with five liners built in 1926–27 for its new London – Rio de Janeiro – Buenos Aires route. Cammell Laird of Birkenhead built three sister ships: &quot;Almeda&quot;, &quot;Andalucia&quot; and &quot;Arandora&quot;. John Brown &amp; Company of Clydebank built two: &quot;Avelona&quot; and &quot;Avila&quot;. The quintet came to be called the &quot;Luxury Five&quot;. The five ships also had refrigerated holds to carry frozen meat from South America to Britain.

The new service was a challenge to both foreign competitors and the Royal Mail Steam Packet Company, whose Royal Mail Ships had been the premier UK carrier of mail, passengers and some cargoes between Britain, Brazil and the River Plate for 75 years. RMSP Chairman Lord Kylsant called the Blue Star ships &quot;very keen competition&quot; even though at the very same time his company introduced two larger and more luxurious new ocean liners for passenger and refrigerated cargo on the route, the (completed 1926) and (completed 1927).

In 1929 Blue Star added &quot;Star&quot; to the end of the name of each of its ships. This may have been partly to help distinguish Blue Star from Royal Mail Steam Packet Company, whose ships bore similar Spanish names. RMSP was an old company with a distinguished history, but had got into difficulties and collapsed amid financial scandal in 1932.

In 1935 Harland and Wolff in Belfast launched , the first of a new class of refrigerated cargo motor ships designed to carry frozen meat on Blue Star&#x27;s regular route from Australia and New Zealand to the UK. By the end of 1939 Harland and Wolff had completed six &quot;Imperial Star&quot;-class ships and Cammell Laird in Birkenhead had completed three.

==Second World War==

By 1939 Blue Star Line operated 39 ships, all of which gave Second World War service. In 1940 an &quot;Imperial Star&quot;-class ship being built by Burmeister &amp; Wain in Denmark was captured in the German invasion of Denmark and completed as a &quot;Kriegsmarine&quot; submarine tender.

Because the &quot;Imperial Star&quot;-class were refrigerated and in merchant shipping terms relatively fast, several sailed in high-risk convoys to relieve the siege of Malta. and took part in Operation Substance in July 1941, &quot;Imperial Star&quot; and were in Operation Halberd the following month, and in August 1942 &quot;Melbourne Star&quot; and served in Operation Pedestal. In February 1942 another ship of the same class, , successfully evacuated an estimated 2,160 people from the fall of Singapore.
Blue Star suffered heavy losses. 29 ships were sunk: a total of . They included all of the Luxury Five liners, and two Empire ships that the company was managing for the Ministry of War Transport. Another 16 vessels, including three more Empire ships under Blue Star management, were seriously damaged. By the end of hostilities only 12 &quot;Star&quot; ships remained in the fleet. 646 Blue Star personnel, 272 passengers and 78 DEMS gunners were killed.

Blue Star Line bought Lamport and Holt Line in 1944 and Booth Steamship Company in 1946, and ships were often transferred back and forth between the subsidiary companies.

==Postwar==
Another building programme was enacted to replace wartime losses, supplemented by the purchase or hire of existing ships including Empire ships such as &quot;Empire Castle&quot; and &quot;Empire Strength&quot; from the Ministry of War Transport. In 1952 Austasia Line was formed to operate services between Singapore, Indonesia, Malaysia and Australia, while Blue Star Line took over the North American routes previously operated by Donaldson Line in 1954. In 1957 Blue Star Line joined with three other shipping companies, the New Zealand Shipping Company, Port Line and Shaw, Savill &amp; Albion to form the Crusader Shipping Company, and in 1965 entered a partnership with Italian shippers to form Calmeda S.p.A. di Nav, Cagliari. Blue Star Line now had global interests, with ports of call on the Pacific North American coast, in Japan, New Zealand, Australia, Canada, South America and Italy. They were also one of the major shareholders, along with several other large shipping firms, in British United Airways.

==Reorganisation and decline==
Blue Star Line divested itself of its holdings in British United Airways in 1968 and became one of the founding partners that year in Associated Container Transportation (ACT), along with the Ben Line, Cunard (Port Line), Harrison Line and Ellerman Lines. Blue Star Line gradually moved towards containerization, ending its passenger services to South America in 1972. Blue Star took over ACT&#x27;s Pacific Australia Container Express (PACE) line which operated between the USA and Australia.

In 1982–83 Blue Star Line assisted in the defence of the Falkland Islands by managing the barracks ship at Port Stanley. Also managed MV &quot;Avelona Star&quot; at the time under requisition of MOD.
Blue Star Line was bought by P&amp;O Nedlloyd in 1998, which acquired the name and most of the assets, with the exception of most of the reefer ships, which were kept by the Vestey Group under the name Albion Reefers, and then merged with Hamburg Süd&#x27;s reefer fleet under the name Star Reefers. Star Reefers was sold in July 2001 to Norwegian interests, and then subsequently merged with NYK Group as NYK Star Reefers Ltd. The Blue Star Line ships bought by P&amp;O Nedlloyd, which included those operated as part of ACT, continued in service with P&amp;O Nedlloyd under Blue Star Line names and liveries. Some of the original Blue Star vessels sold to P&amp;O Nedlloyd traded until February 2003 on the East Coast of America to Australia and New Zealand. They were the (ex &quot;ACT 3&quot;), &quot;Melbourne Star&quot; (ex &quot;ACT 4&quot;), &quot;Sydney Star&quot; (ex &quot;ACT 5&quot;) and &quot;Queensland Star&quot; (ex &quot;ACT 6&quot;). The last vessel trading, to carry the Blue Star funnel colours was the &quot;America Star&quot;, which was handed over to be broken up on 19 February 2003.

==Reederei Blue Star==
P&amp;O Nedlloyd formed Reederei Blue Star in 2002 as a ship management company, from which it chartered ships. P&amp;O Nedlloyd was bought by AP Moller Maersk Group in 2005 and merged into its operations to form Maersk Line. Reederei Blue Star continues to operate as part of Maersk Line.

On 18 June 2009 Komrowski took over the ship management company Reederei Blue Star GmbH, Hamburg, from Maersk Ship Management Holding B.V., Rotterdam. As of July 2012, the Komrowski Group-owned Blue Star merged with Komrowski Befrachtungskontor and E.R. Schiffahrt to form The Blue Star Holding.

The , a replica ship proposal of the original that sank in 1912, is a Blue Star Line Cruises ship owned by Australian billionaire/businessman Clive Palmer who started the plan on April 14, 2012. This effort has no relation to the original and historic Blue Star Line.

<text>Kyle Chapman is a New Zealand far-right political activist and the former national director of the New Zealand National Front (NZNF), a white nationalist political party with a deep hate for Māori and Pasifika New Zealanders that worked to eliminate Māori and &#x27;black people&#x27;. He has stood unsuccessfully three times for the Christchurch mayoralty: first for the NZNF (2004); then for the National Democrats Party (2007); and then for the Resistance Party (2013).

Chapman founded Right Wing Resistance, a neo-Nazi group, in 2009. Since 2023, he has also been involved with a group that targets the LBGT community. 

==Personal life==
Chapman was born in Taumarunui, New Zealand.

In May 2009, Chapman married, but separated in October of the same year. His wife stated that Chapman had vowed to give up his far-right activities, but she ended the relationship when he did not. She was pregnant with his child at the time they split.

==Activities==
Chapman was the founding member of the New Zealand Hammerskins.

He was convicted of fire-bombing a marae during the late 1980s and early 1990s. He admitted to hurling Molotov cocktails at various buildings, including Ngāi Tahu Murihiku Marae and a school.

In January 2009 an email was sent out concerning Chapman&#x27;s plans to create a European culture &quot;protected community&quot; in North Canterbury. The email stated that his intention was to &quot;build a unified mini state that we could build up in future to be a base for other like minded Europeans to come to from other dying countries&quot;. The email claimed the compound would have a school, accommodation, a meeting house for leaders, and a training area for sport fighting and survival training.

===Running for offices===
In 2004, he unsuccessfully contested the mayoralty of Christchurch, New Zealand, placing 5th out of 10 with 1.9 per cent of the vote (1665 votes).

In 2005, he was the tenth-ranked list candidate for the Direct Democracy Party. The party, which only contested the 2005 general election, did not achieve representation.

He unsuccessfully contested the Christchurch mayoralty again in 2007, running this time under the National Democrats ticket.

In 2013, Chapman ran again for the Christchurch mayoralty, but was unsuccessful, securing 499 votes. He also ran for the Ferrymead-Pegasus Local Board, securing 641 votes, but was also unsuccessful there.

===Turning his back on politics===
After the 2019 Christchurch mosque shootings Chapman said he had &quot;fallen out&quot; with others in groups he used to belong in and &quot;turned his back&quot; on them to focus on family and religion. This was disputed by a holocaust historian, who said his statement was &quot;an object lesson in the tactics these groups use to legitimise themselves through media manipulation&quot;.

===COVID-19 pandemic===
On 20 August 2021, Chapman and two other individuals appeared in the Christchurch District Court after they broke COVID-19 lockdown restrictions to protest those restrictions the day before in Christchurch. The three individuals were remanded in custody on charges of failing to comply with restrictions under the COVID-19 Public Health Response Act 2020.

=== 2023: Plots against Pride event and arrest ===
Chapman was involved in &#x27;Room 102&#x27;, also called the &#x27;Robert Grey Life Centre&#x27;, a Christchurch-based group of conspiracy theorists and extremists. The group targeted an event where drag queens read stories to children. Ultimately 50 people protested the event, with an equal number of counter-protestors. Chapman has used group&#x27;s headquarters to hold survivalist workshops and martial art sessions.

On 20 February 2024, Chapman was sentenced to six months&#x27; community detention and six months of supervision after he pleaded guilty to unlawful possession of a Norinco semi-automatic rifle. This was one of the semi-automatic weapons banned following the Christchurch mosque shootings. He also pleaded guilty to possession of ammunition and parts for a rifle.

Court documents showed that Chapman had recently met with ex-marines and soldiers in the United States and that he had formed a new survivalist group in North Canterbury. 

== Organisations ==

=== National Front ===
Chapman is a former leader of the New Zealand National Front, leading the organisation from 1997 to 2005. In 2005, he resigned from his role as the leader of the National Front. He said in interviews that his children were being shunned at school due to his activities. He also cited the harassment by left-wing anti-NZNF groups as a factor in his departure.

===Right Wing Resistance===

In 2009, Chapman founded the Right Wing Resistance, a neo-Nazi group, in Christchurch with a group of white nationalists. Chapman reportedly knighted the members with a sword after they recited a pledge. The group&#x27;s insignia was a skull over a Wolfsangel, with the notation &quot;NA 14&quot;. Its introduction to the New Zealand public was its Christchurch street patrols in October 2009, which appeared to target Polynesian youths. RWR members engaged in street patrols in New Brighton with the stated purpose of preventing vandalism by youth street gangs. The mayor of Christchurch denounced their vigilante behaviour. Its street patrols included from 5 to 15 members, who had shaved heads. Also in October 2009, Chapman organized a rally at the Wellington cenotaph.

The group attempted to recruit further members in Auckland. Press coverage resulted from distributions of flyers comparing immigration to an invasion, which were called &quot;despicable&quot; by the Race Relations Commissioner. It also helped organise protests and other street activities alongside the National Front.

During the 2011 general election campaign, members of the group disrupted a candidate&#x27;s election meeting in Christchurch appearing in military-style clothing. They stated that they would protest at polling booths throughout New Zealand on election day; however, this did not happen.

After the March 2019 Christchurch mosque shootings Chapman said he was no longer involved with this group.

Right Wing Resistance was reported in November 2019 to have chapters in Australia, Sweden and Scotland. There is an Australian far-right extremist group called Right Wing Resistance Australia, said to have &quot;international connections&quot;.

===Survive Club===
Chapman founded and led the Survive Club, a survivalist group that denied being a militia and having any racist ties despite the histories of some of its members.

<doc id="816101" wikidata="Q2520527" url="?curid=816101" title="Kasumi (Dead or Alive)">
<text>is a fictional character and the protagonist of the &quot;Dead or Alive&quot; fighting game series by Team Ninja and Tecmo (Koei Tecmo). Kasumi serves as the main protagonist of the &quot;Dead or Alive&quot; franchise since its premiere in 1996. She was a main character in the &quot;first&quot;, &quot;second&quot;, and &quot;fifth&quot; games of the series and in the film adaptation, &quot;&quot;.

In the games&#x27; canon, Kasumi, also known as &quot;The Kunoichi of Destiny&quot;, is a teenage ninja princess of the Mugen Tenshin Ninja Clan. Kasumi abandoned her clan, becoming an outcast and is pursued by her younger half-sister, Ayane. Throughout the series, there have been several boss characters who are clones of her. She also guest appeared in various other games, including Team Ninja&#x27;s other flagship series, &quot;Ninja Gaiden&quot;, where she and Ayane play much bigger roles, as well as &quot;Warriors Orochi 3 Ultimate&quot; and &quot;Warriors All-Stars&quot; as part of their playable roster.

Kasumi has become a symbol of the &quot;Dead or Alive&quot; franchise and is the personal favorite of Team Ninja&#x27;s founder and the series&#x27; creator, Tomonobu Itagaki. She has been the subject of various merchandise and was also used to promote Xbox consoles in Japan. Kasumi is a popular sex symbol in video game culture and an iconic ninja character. Due to differences in cultural norms, she has attracted some controversy in the West involving eroticism and the use of underage female characters in video games.

==Conception and design==
Tomonobu Itagaki originally envisioned the character to be male, before changing her gender. As Kasumi became more and more kawaii, he decided to make her the lead character. The rest of his team was only half-convinced at first but warmed up to the idea eventually. Kasumi and the other ninja characters are &quot;like superheroes&quot; compared to the more realistic fighters, regarded as a &quot;fantasy element&quot; by &quot;Dead or Alive 6&quot; art director and scenario writer Yutaka Saito. Her primary outfit was designed to keep &quot;in mind of materials available to cosplayers at the time&quot;

Kasumi is and with three-sizes of 35-21-33. She is usually wearing a wakizashi in a small of her back. Her hair has been variously blonde, auburn and red, with hairstyle options including a ponytail, a braid, and loose hair. She wears many types of costumes through the series, including female ninja outfits, feminine casual clothes, Japanese schoolgirl uniforms, and bikinis. Commonly, her default (and sometimes only, in most of her guest appearances) costume has been her blue-and-white &quot;Brilliant Lapis&quot; (originally white-and-red, later known as &quot;Immaculate White&quot;), made of a revealing and puff-sleeved Japanese tunic (later with swan-themed ornaments), a sash, thigh-high tabi, sandals with shin guards, hand guards with metal wristbands, and a choker. According to IGN, she had the best outfits of the characters in &quot;Dead or Alive Ultimate&quot;the expanded compilation of the first two &quot;DOA&quot; gamesin which &quot;she looks great and her outfits are fantastic.&quot; A planned new main costume for Kasumi in &quot;Dead or Alive: Dimensions&quot; upset some fans when the game was announced in 2010.

She was the youngest character in the original version of the first game. Itagaki said his &quot;daughter&quot; Kasumi &quot;has been a main character of the &quot;Dead or Alive&quot; series, and please understand, she is like a Venus to me.&quot; When asked if he was comfortable with sexualizing a 17-year-old character, Itagaki answered, &quot;In Japan, that&#x27;s okay. Maybe it&#x27;s 20 in America.&quot; He said, &quot;I was 27 when I created Kasumi. I&#x27;m older now, but 17-year-old girls are still gorgeous.&quot; Itagaki said the &quot;Dead or Alive&quot; series contributed its character Ayane, rather than the &quot;very soft&quot; Kasumi, for a cameo appearance in 2004&#x27;s &quot;Ninja Gaiden&quot; because Kasumi did not fit with the game&#x27;s &quot;very hard-edged&quot; basis as &quot;&quot;DOA&quot; is based on a &#x27;softer&#x27; concept, and she is rather symbolic of the game as a whole&quot;. He said that if &quot;Ninja Gaiden&quot; had featured Kasumi, it would have become less a &quot;story of [Ryu] Hayabusa and ninjas&quot; and more a story of Kasumi (&quot;&quot;Kasumi-den&quot;) and a &quot;DOA&quot; action game&quot;. Itagaki has described himself as personally &quot;a fan of Kasumi&quot; as his favorite &quot;DOA&quot; character. He also said he felt &quot;responsible for her&quot; and was &quot;very close to her&quot;. When hackers found a way to remove her clothing in &quot;DOA2&quot;, Itagaki felt this &quot;was an attack on her&quot;. Tecmo&#x27;s lawyers sued software company West Side, the authors of the hack, for violating copyright, and won the case and damages of two million yen (over ). Kasumi&#x27;s nude model can be also accessed using a GameShark cheat device in the Dreamcast version of &quot;DOA2&quot;, and one fan-made mod for &quot;DOA5&quot; modified her training suit to remove most of the clothing.

In 2012, 16 years after her debut appearance, Kasumi was redesigned to look less cartoon-like and more realistic with a &quot;grown up&quot; appearance in &quot;DOA5&quot;. The game&#x27;s art director Yuta Saito said, &quot;From &quot;DOA4&quot; we wanted to evolve the characters in a slightly realistic direction. The most difficult, and you don&#x27;t have to ask, is Kasumi. Kasumi is the face of &quot;DOA&quot; and the eternal heroine. And for such a popular character like Kasumi, to change her form we really needed a lot of courage and it really was a big challenge. But if we didn&#x27;t do that, we couldn&#x27;t make &quot;DOA5&quot; and we wouldn&#x27;t be able to show you anything.&quot; Producer Yasuke Hayashi said the process of remodeling Kasumi has sparked most disputes in the development team, especially since she is &quot;a character that is not so much out on the table, with hidden feelings, and it&#x27;s been difficult to express such a &#x27;hidden look&#x27;.&quot; &quot;GamesRadar+&quot; noted that &quot;the manga influences on her facial featureswhile still apparenthave been scaled right back [a]nd her boobs seem less ludicrously unmanageable.&quot; Kasumi&#x27;s main costume has been different for the first time in &quot;Dead or Alive 6&quot; (described as an armored &quot;full-body skin-tight catsuit with combat heels&quot;), but her iconic blue outfit still does appear in the game.

==Appearances==

===In video games===
Kasumi was introduced in the 1996 fighting video game &quot;Dead or Alive&quot; by Koei Tecmo, and alongside her brother Hayate is one of heirs apparent of their ninja clan. However after Hayate is seriously injured by series villain Raidou, she abandons her position to fight and kill him at the game&#x27;s fighting tournament. Now an outcast, she is pursued by her half sister Ayane. Despite being victorious, she is captured and experimented on by the company DOATEC, which produces several clones of her she fights through the series. After she escapes, she reunites with her now-amnesiac brother. Kasumi helps him to recover his memories and restores him to the head of the ninja clan, though she remains an outcast. Living as a hermit in the mountains, in &quot;Dead or Alive 6&quot; she fights alongside Ayane and Hayate to defeat a revived Raidou.

Kasumi appears in the 2003 sports video game &quot;Dead or Alive Xtreme Beach Volleyball&quot; (&quot;DOAX&quot;). There, Kasumi is invited to a fourth DOA tournament; upon arriving she discovers the invitation is a hoax, and she and the game&#x27;s other characters play beach volleyball. Kasumi also appears in the sequel, &quot;Dead or Alive Xtreme 2&quot; (2006), and in the portable version &quot;Dead or Alive Paradise&quot; (2010). She is one of the first nine playable female characters in &quot;Dead or Alive Xtreme 3&quot; (2015). In this case, Kasumi, while reading her fortune, returns once again to New Zack Island, and she decides to spend some time in order to find of about her fortune. In mobile game &quot;The Girls of Dead or Alive: Blackjack&quot; (2009), Kasumi makes a non-player appearance as blackjack dealer.

&quot;Dead or Alive: Code Chronos&quot;, a &quot;DOA&quot; series&#x27; prequel game which was to star Kasumi and Ayane in the leading roles. Itagaki said in 2003, &quot;the fact that we registered this trademark for &quot;Kasumi-den&quot; should tell you that we have a big plan for it.&quot; &quot;Code Chronos&quot; was cancelled following Itagaki&#x27;s departure from Tecmo

In the &quot;Ninja Gaiden&quot; series, Kasumi first made a cameo appearance at the end of 2009&#x27;s &quot;Ninja Gaiden Sigma 2&quot;. Kasumi appears as a playable character in the 2012 action game &quot;Ninja Gaiden 3: Razor&#x27;s Edge&quot;, which was made available as free DLC for the Wii U, and was included in the PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360 versions. In it, she is armed with a long sword and kunai throwing knives and by default wears hooded black armor with a cape-like blue scarf; the player can also select three of her costumes from &quot;DOA5&quot;. In 2013, Kasumi was featured in the smart phone action card game &quot;Hyakuman-nin no Ninja Gaiden&quot;, in which Hitomi from &quot;Dead or Alive&quot; and Rio from &quot;&quot; also appear dressed in Kasumi&#x27;s &quot;DOA&quot; costumes.

Kasumi appears as an optionally playable &#x27;monster&#x27; in the games &quot;Monster Rancher 2&quot; (1999) and &quot;Monster Rancher 4&quot; (2003). Kasumi also appears as a playable character in a minor role in &quot;Warriors Orochi 3 Ultimate&quot; (&quot;Musou Orochi 3 Ultimate&quot;, 2013). She is a playable character in the crossover crowd-fighting game &quot;Warriors All-Stars&quot; (&quot;Musou Stars&quot;, 2017) in a larger role, including appearing on the game&#x27;s cover art.

Her classic blue ninja getup is an unlockable costume for Arin in &quot;Super Swing Golf&quot;, and is an alternative costume of Mio Amakura in the Director&#x27;s Cut version of &quot;Fatal Frame II: Crimson Butterfly&quot; for the Xbox (2004). It is also available for character avatars in Koei&#x27;s social game &quot;My GAMECITY&quot; and in Sega&#x27;s &quot;Phantasy Star Online 2&quot; (added in 2017), as well as for player characters in Game Arts&#x27; &quot;Ragnarok Odyssey Ace&quot; (2013) and for &quot;Senran Kagura&quot;&#x27;s Asuka in &quot;Shinobi Master Senran Kagura: New Link&quot; (a 2018 collaboration). Sega&#x27;s free-to-play game &quot;Samurai &amp; Dragons&quot; added a rare Kasumi card in 2013. Kasumi also appeared as a playable guest character in Netmarble/SNK&#x27;s &quot;The King of Fighters All Star&quot; (a 2021 collaboration).

===In other media===
Kasumi appeared as a lead character in the 2006 action-comedy film &quot;&quot;, which is loosely based on the game series. In it, she was played by Devon Aoki, an American actress of mixed ethnicity who has previously portrayed the ninja Miho in the film &quot;Sin City&quot;. Itagaki later expressed a preference for a Japanese actress, ideally Kumiko Gotoh, but had no authority over the casting process. According to Aoki, she was asked to go the film&#x27;s casting interview by her 15-year-old brother. She played the game for the first time, after which she understood why Kasumi is so popular. Aoki said about Kasumi in the film: &quot;Yes, she&#x27;s pretty badass ... and she&#x27;s a princess. She&#x27;s never been outside the palace walls. She&#x27;s been very, very sheltered, because she&#x27;s a princess and that&#x27;s the way it is ... until the point where she actually decides to leave, she&#x27;s basically been pretty sheltered but she&#x27;s a capable fighter.&quot;

According to &quot;Kung Fu Tai Chi&quot;, &quot;DOA: Dead or Alive&quot; &quot;focuses its pugilistic mayhem on the eye-candy surrounding the mythos of Princess Kasumi&quot;. In the movie, Kasumi escapes her clan and joins the tournament upon receiving an invitation. She fights against Leon and wins. Later, Kasumi stabs the villain Victor Donovan with an acupuncture needle. He is paralyzed and perishes in an explosion. In the end, she goes home with her brother despite being a runaway &quot;shinobi&quot;, but has to fight against her clan with her new friends to be allowed to stay.

In print media, Kasumi appears in several stories in the gag comic series &quot;Dead or Alive 2 Comic Anthology&quot; by DNA Media Comics. She was also featured in a gamebook for the ecchi series &quot;Queen&#x27;s Blade&quot;, which utilized a stylized version of her original design. Meanwhile, a picture book titled &quot;Dead or Alive Side A: Love! Kasumi&quot; was produced and sold in Japan, featuring images and poses of the character as seen in the &quot;Xtreme&quot; series.

Another Kasumi figure was released for her &quot;Queen&#x27;s Gate&quot; appearance.

==Critical reception==
Kasumi was well received upon her debut. Brian Ashcraft of &quot;Kotaku&quot; called her one of the most iconic characters in Japanese gaming, praising how cosplayers leaned into the character&#x27;s strengths and how instantly recognizable her outfit had become, further calling her the face of the franchise and stating &quot;She isn&#x27;t merely in &quot;Dead or Alive&quot;; she is &quot;Dead or Alive&quot;.&quot; The staff of &quot;Wirtualna Polska&quot; meanwhile stated she has &quot;become almost a legend, becoming one of the most iconic heroines not only in games, but also in pop culture in general&quot;, noting the large amount of merchandise and memorability regarding the character. The book She has also been cited her as a popular subject for cosplay, with &quot;Everybody Cosplay!&quot; author Jan Kurotaki voicing her approval for the &quot;cool, really flashy costume that gets you a lot of attention!&quot;

Princess Weekees of &quot;The Mary Sue&quot; stated that while &quot;her conception was filled with ecchi ideas&quot;, she enjoyed how Kasumi evolved as a character during the course of the series. Calling her a sex symbol, she appreciated that the character&#x27;s redesign in &quot;Dead or Alive 6&quot; was her favorite, &quot;providing full coverage, but the tight design of it still looks sexy&quot;. In another article she cited Kasumi as an example of a &quot;badass wish-fulfillment&quot; character she felt women often enjoyed playing as a form of power fantasy. Manga artist Kōsuke Fujishima praised how she represented the series as a protagonist, finding it &quot;refreshing&quot; to see in the fighting game genre. He additionally enjoyed that her movements were &quot;expressed in a feminine manner&quot;, noting that it was a rarity in the time of &quot;Dead or Alive 2&quot;″s release.

James Hawkins of &quot;Joystick Division&quot; stated that while all the female characters of &quot;Dead or Alive&quot; were sexy, &quot;there is something [...] about Kasumi that the other characters in the series seem to be missing&quot;, citing her compassionate character and &quot;appealing vulnerability in the way she carries herself&quot;, but also how her character seemed more realistically proportioned compared to other members of the cast. The staff of &quot;Sina.com.cn&quot; it was &quot;extremely easy to be intoxicated&quot; by her &quot;quiet and delicate appearance&quot;, and felt this along with her temperament made her extremely popular with male and female players. Kurt Kalata of &quot;Hardcore Gaming 101&quot; on the other hand criticized her as an &quot;insufferable Mary Sue,&quot; particularly in &quot;Dimensions&quot; and cited her as an example of poor writing in the series. The staff of &quot;Kakuchopurei&quot; noted that while she was an important character to and often the driving force of the &quot;Dead or Alive&quot; series, they disliked her lack of personality and that her only perceived motivation seemed to be due to her role as the series protagonist, stating &quot;That’s a goal, not a character trait.&quot;

Kasumi&#x27;s character design and its sexualization have been discussed in various publications. The book &quot;Data Made Flesh&quot; cited her as an example of how video game characters tend to lean towards a &quot;hyperreal&quot; depiction that aimed to create &quot;a unique aesthetic for perfection&quot;. Matt Cundy of &quot;GamesRadar+&quot; meanwhile praised how she was changed aesthetically for &quot;Dead or Alive 5&quot;, citing how the &quot;manga influences&quot; in her face were present but reduced, and particularly noted her breasts were shown as more manageable compared to previous incarnations. While he called her outfit &quot;a questionable state of undress&quot;, he stated &quot;at least she looks more tasteful while doing it. So that&#x27;s definitely probably more mature.&quot; Emanuel Maiberg of &quot;Vice&quot; voiced approval for her redesign in &quot;Dead or Alive 6&quot;, citing it as an example of how the game series could be seen as &quot;growing up&quot;.

Kasumi has also been the subject of various third-party productions, many of which erotic media such as hentai doujins and machinima, the latter of which has been the subject of academic discussion regarding the treatment of women in such media. Meanwhile, Japanese company Thrust released an unlicensed pornographic film of the character titled &quot;Kazumi&quot; in 2007. Also in 2007, Doujin company C-Cube released a unofficial &quot;breast stimulation&quot; erotic soundtrack CD using the character&#x27;s likeness in Akihabara stores. Kasumi&#x27;s popularity also led to a large amount of poor quality bootleg figurines in Japan, to the extent shop owners would post comparison pictures to help shoppers identify them.

<doc id="816115" wikidata="Q8004585" url="?curid=816115" title="William Arthur Dunkerley">
<text>William Arthur Dunkerley (12 November 1852 – 23 January 1941) was an English journalist, novelist and poet. He was born in Manchester, spent a short time after his marriage in the US before moving to Ealing, West London, where he served as deacon and teacher at the Ealing Congregational Church from the 1880s. In 1922 he moved to Worthing in Sussex, where he became the town&#x27;s mayor.

Dunkerley wrote under his own name, and also as John Oxenham for his poetry, hymn-writing, and novels. His poetry includes &quot;Bees in Amber: A Little Book of Thoughtful Verse&quot; (1913), which became a bestseller. He also wrote the poem &quot;Greatheart&quot;. In 1918, wrote the foreword and assessed the poetry of the administrator of the Scottish Women&#x27;s Hospitals for Foreign Service, Mary H. J. Henderson &quot;In War and Peace: Songs of a Scotswoman.&quot; 

He used the pseudonym Julian Ross for journalism.

His novel &quot;A Mystery of the Underground&quot; (1897) is notable both as an early murder story about a serial killer and a very early crime story set on the London Underground (District Line). The District Railway complained that it was &quot;too realistic&quot;, and it is said to have led to a reduction of passengers on Tuesdays (the murderer always strikes on a Tuesday) while it was being serialised.

In February 1892 Robert Barr and Dunkerley founded &quot;The Idler&quot;, a monthly &quot;general interest magazine, one of the first to appear following the enthusiastic reception of &quot;The Strand&quot;, but not a slavish imitation&quot;. Barr and Dunkerley/Oxenham both contributed as writers. The editors were Barr and Jerome K. Jerome initially.

Dunkerley had two sons and four daughters, of whom the eldest, and eldest child, Elsie Jeanette, became well known as a children&#x27;s writer, particularly through her Abbey Series of girls&#x27; school stories. Another daughter, Erica, also used the Oxenham pen-name.

<doc id="816116" wikidata="Q251830" url="?curid=816116" title="2005 Iranian presidential election">
<text>Presidential elections were held in Iran 17 June 2005, with a second round run-off on 24 June. Mohammad Khatami, the outgoing president of Iran, stepped down on 2 August 2005, after serving his maximum two consecutive four-year terms according to the Islamic republic&#x27;s constitution.

As no candidate received a majority of the vote in the first round, a run-off was held between the top two candidates, former president (1989–1997) Akbar Rafsanjanī and Mahmoud Ahmadinejad, the hardline mayor of Tehran. Although Ahmadinejad had finished second in the first round of voting, he won the second round with 63% of the vote. Factors thought to have contributed to Ahmadinejad&#x27;s victory include mobilization of mosque networks and conservative/hardline voters, and a protest vote against corrupt elite insiders and for &quot;new political blood&quot;. He was a loyal supporter of conservative Supreme Leader Khamenei.

==Schedule==
Schedule of the election had been decided between the Ministry of Interior and the Guardian Council for 17 June 2005. The election will continue as a runoff race, which will take place a week later than the first round of elections, on 24 June 2005. The registration of candidates began on 10 May 2005 and continued for five days, until 14 May. If the Guardian Council had requested, it may have been extended for five more days, until 19 May. The candidates were not allowed to do advertisements, until the final list of approved candidates are known. The official period for advertisement was from 27 May to 15 June.

In the first round, Iranian nationals born on or before 17 June 1990, residing in or outside Iran, were able to vote. The election in Iran began on 09:00 local time (04:30 UTC) and while the original deadline was ten hours later on 19:00 (14:30 UTC), the deadline was extended three times by the Ministry of Interior, finally until 23:00 (18:30 UTC). Outside Iran, different times are used as the opening and closing hours for the polling offices. On the same date, mid-term Majlis elections for Gachsaran, Garmsar, Ghazvin, Ilam, Iranshahr, Jolfa, Marand, Sarbaz, and Shiraz took place together with the runoff elections of Tehran for the Iranian Majlis election of 2004.

The first three suggestions by the Ministry, for 13 May, 20 May and 10 June 2005, had been rejected by the council. The Ministry had mentioned that it is concerned that an election later than 20 May may collide with the final exams of the elementary schools and high schools.

The second round of the election occurred on 24 June and Iranian nationals born on or before 24 June 1990 were able to vote. The election in Iran began at 09:00 local time (04:30 UTC) and the closing time of the voting polls was at 19:00 (14:30 UTC), but was subject to extension by the Ministry of Interior.

==Candidates==
The registration of the candidates finished on 14 May 2005 and 1014 candidates had registered to run, including many people who did not have the qualifications required in the law. More than 90% of the candidates were men, and there were about ninety female candidates. The law about the election process does not include any requirements for people who want to register to run: it only provides qualifications that are to be checked by the Guardian Council.

The candidates must have first be approved by the Guardian Council before being put to public vote and it could be predicted that some of the candidates would not win the approval, especially Ebrahim Asgharzadeh and Ebrahim Yazdi, who were rejected by the Council in the parliamentary elections of 2004 and/or the presidential elections of 2001. There were also some people who expected Mostafa Moeen, the most controversial reformist candidate, to be disqualified as well. But the most unpredictable was the disqualification of conservative Reza Zavare&#x27;i, a former member of the Guardian Council and an approved presidential candidate for two previous elections.

Also, there was a high probability of rejection of women, because of an ambiguous term (&quot;rejāl&quot;, رجال) in the Constitution of Iran, a requirement for presidential candidates, which may be interpreted as either &quot;men&quot; or &quot;nobles&quot;. The Guardian Council, who is also the official interpreter of the constitution, has mentioned on previous elections that the restriction has not been considered in depth yet, since according to the council&#x27;s opinion there were no women registered to run for presidency who fulfilled the other requirements of the constitution; but still, the Council believes that the requirement of &quot;rejal&quot; would not match women.

There had also been discussions for a new law proposed in the Majlis, restricting the maximum age of the candidates for the presidential elections. This was widely seen as an attempt to limit the participation of Akbar Rafsanjanī and Mehdi Karroubi. The attempt failed with no proposal appearing.

===Approved candidates===
The list of all the people who have officially registered to run for the post is not available to the public, but the Guardian Council published a final list of six approved candidates on 22 May rejecting all independent candidates and some candidates from the both wings, specially the reformist candidates Mostafa Moeen and Mohsen Mehralizadeh. This raised many objections among the general public and the political parties, including student protests in the Tehran University, among other universities. This, and the objections of some of the approved candidates, led to a letter from Ayatollah Khamenei, the Supreme Leader, to the Guardian Council asking for the approval of Moeen and Mehralizadeh (this had apparently been because of a request by Haddad-Adel, the conservative Speaker of the Parliament). It is unknown if that letter meant that the Guardian Council &quot;must&quot; have approved these two, or it &quot;should&quot; have only reconsidered their case. The next day, on 23 May, the Guardian Council announced the approval of Moeen and Mehralizadeh.

Mohsen Rezaee, one of the approved conservative candidates, who is the Secretary of Expediency Discernment Council and a previous commander of the Iran–Iraq War, withdrew in the evening of 15 June.

These were the candidates approved by the Council of Guardians:

====Trans-party====
*Akbar Rafsanjanī, Chairman of the Expediency Discernment Council and a former President of Iran, who has won the support of several parties from both of the wings (and may still win more support), but is considered to lean towards the conservatives more than towards the reformists. Ironically, the reformist alliance considered him as a possible candidate of theirs more than the conservative alliance. He was invited to run for president by Executives of Construction Party (reformist), Combatant Clergy Association (conservative), Islamic Labour Party (conservative), and Workers&#x27; House (reformist), as well as several other parties across the whole spectrum of positions. Rafsanjani confirmed he is running for the election on 10 May after much speculation.

====Reformists====
*Mehdi Karroubi, former Majlis Speaker, Secretary General of Association of Combatant Clerics (MCS), supported by MCS, Islamic Association of Engineers, &quot;Majma&#x27;-e Gorooh-haa-ye Khat-te Emam&quot;, and Democracy Party of Iran.
*Mohsen Mehralizadeh, vice-president and head of National Sports Organization, member of IIPF. Mehralizadeh has first announced that he would be running for the post on behalf of the Iranian younger generation, but not if the reformist alliance reached consensus on another candidate, but during the registration mentioned that he would remain in the race until the end.
*Mostafa Moeen, former Minister of Science, Research and Technology, supported by Islamic Iran Participation Front (IIPF) and Mojahedin of the Islamic Revolution Organization (MIRO). Confirmed to run on 29 December 2004. IIPF, an influential reformist party in Iran, has mentioned that they won&#x27;t support any presidential candidate outside the party, except Mousavi and Moeen. Since Mousavi has declined to run, they supported Moeen, whom they claimed to be the most probable candidate to win the approval of other parties in the reformist alliance. Some conservative Majlis representatives had asked for the Guardian Council&#x27;s rejection of Moeen, which happened finally but was reversed after a letter by Ayatollah Khamenei. Moeen had announced that he would choose Mohammad Reza Khatami as his First Vice President if he was elected, and had already chosen Elaheh Koulaee, a female representative of the sixth Islamic Assembly, as his spokeswoman.

====Conservatives====
*Mahmoud Ahmadinejad, Mayor of Tehran, member of Islamic Society of Engineers (ISE), supported by some parts of Alliance of Builders of Islamic Iran (ABII). Although Ahmadinejad said he would not seek nomination on 2 February 2005, he returned to the scene later.
*Mohammad Bagher Ghalibaf, former Commander of Police (&quot;niroo-ye entezaami&quot;), partially supported by the Alliance of Builders. Contrary to the public announcement of Ayatollah Khamenei, the Supreme Leader of Iran, that nobody knows who he will personally vote for, Ghalibaf had claimed privately that he is the person Khamenei will vote for.
*Ali Larijani, Supreme Leader&#x27;s representative in National Security Council and a former director of IRIB, who was supposed to be the major conservative candidate, as chosen by his party, the Islamic Society of Engineers, as well as the &quot;Council for Coordinating the Revolution Forces&quot; (&quot;showrā-ye hamāhangi-e nirūhā-ye enǧelāb&quot;), a council of some older and very influential leaders of the conservative alliance.

===Rejected candidates===
*Reformists
**Akbar A&#x27;lami, Majlis representative of Tabriz.
**Ebrahim Asgharzadeh, former member of Tehran city council, Secretary General of Islamic Iran Solidarity Party (&quot;Hezb-e Hambastegi-e Irān-e Eslāmi&quot;), and one of the hostage-takers in Iran hostage crisis. Asgharzadeh was even not supported by his own party (Islamic Iran Solidarity Party). Asgharzadeh was rejected by the Guardian Council to run as a candidate in the 2001 presidential elections, which had made him unlikely to be approved this time.
**Mostafa Kavakebian, secretary-general of Democracy Party (&quot;hezb-e mardomsālāri&quot;). Kavakebian supported Karroubi after he himself was rejected.
*Conservatives
**Zabihollah Bakhshi, commonly known as &quot;Haji Bakhshi&quot;, militia leader
**Rafat Bayat, Majlis representative from Zanjan, a member of conservative caucus in parliament. On 30 March, she stated that she would run independently, not supported by any significant party in the conservative alliance. It was assumed by some people that she would probably get rejected by the Guardian Council, because of the &quot;rejāl&quot; requirement (&quot;see above&quot;).
**Reza Zavare&#x27;i, former member of Guardian Council, invited to run by &quot;Chekaad-e Daaneshjooyaan-e Mosalmaan&quot;
*Independents
**Nasser Hejazi, former goalkeeper of the national football team and former coach of the Esteghlal football club. After his rejection, Hejazi supported Rafsanjanī as president.
**Mohammad Hossein Pahlevan, known as &quot;Arshia&quot;, pop singer
**Azam Taleghani, daughter of Ayatollah Mahmoud Taleghani.
**Ebrahim Yazdi, former Minister of Foreign affairs in the Interim Government of 1979, secretary general of Freedom Movement Party. After being rejected by the Guardian Council, Yazdi is supporting Moeen for the presidency.
*Unknown affiliation
**Ayatollah Mohammad Sajjadi

===Declinations and withdrawals===
The most important withdrawal was that of Mohsen Rezaee, one of the candidates who was approved by the Guardian Council and participated in the race until the evening of 15 June 2005, two days before the election and only a few hours before the final deadline allowed for advertisements. Rezaee mentioned he was withdrawing from the race for &quot;the integration of the votes of the nation&quot; and &quot;their effectiveness&quot;. He did not endorse any candidate. 

Also, several people were considered possible candidates for the post, who later declined to run early in the race or at the final moments before registration. A list of the ones considered seriously in the media includes:
*Reformists
**Safdar Hosseini, Minister of Economy and Finance Affair, member of IIPF
**Hadi Khamenei, member of Society of Forces Following the Line of the Imam, declined on 6 December 2004
**Mohammad Reza Khatami, former Majlis Vice Speaker, Secretary General of IIPF
**Hassan Khomeini, grandson of Ruhollah Khomeini
**Mir-Hossein Mousavi, former Prime Minister, declined on 12 October 2004
**Mohammad Mousavi-Khoiniha, member of MCS, declined on 21 November 2004
**Behzad Nabavi, former Majlis Vice Speaker, member of MIRO
**Mohammad Ali Najafi, former Minister of Education
**Abdollah Ramezanzadeh, Spokesman of Government, member of IIPF
*Conservatives
**Gholam Ali Haddad-Adel, Speaker of Majlis, he declined his activities for election and said that he will try to re-ally conservatives for election.
**Abdollah Jasbi, President of Islamic Azad University. Jasbi withdrew in favor of Rafsanjanī.
**Mohammad Javad Larijani, Director of IPM. He strongly endorses his brother Ali Larijani for presidency.
**Hossein Mirmohammad-Sadeghi, former speaker of Judiciary Branch
**Ahmad Tavakkoli, Majlis representative and Director of Majlis Research Center and former presidential candidate. Tavakkoli resigned from the race on 1 May 2005, telling that he is doing this to help minimize the diversity in the conservative camp. He is supporting Ghalibaf in the elections.
**Ali Akbar Velayati, an Adviser to the Supreme Leader for foreign affairs, and a former Minister of Foreign Affairs. Velayati was supported inside the conservative alliance by Islamic Coalition Party (ICP). Valayati had confirmed that he does not accept the support of the &quot;Council for Coordination&quot; and will run independently, unless Akbar Rafsanjanī, who was the President of Iran during Velayati&#x27;s ministership, runs. On 14 May, Velayati did not register to run until the official deadline, and then announced that he is supporting Rafsanjani in the elections.
*Independents
**Shirin Ebadi, winner of Nobel Peace Prize in 2003, declined on 2 January 2005, despite support among some independent groups and parties, which are usually called pro-Human rights

==Campaign==

The best financed candidate, Rafsanjani, campaigned with an entourage of bullet-proof Mercedes limousines. While he usually did not emphasize issues in his campaign Rafsanjani did tell voters that &quot;there is no use imposing tastes, being strict, and going backward. ... Whoever becomes president cannot work without considering the demands and conditions of society.&quot; He also indicated a liberalizing in his views on proper Islamic dress. Where in 2002 he had said that exposing a single strand of a woman&#x27;s hair from behind hejab was &quot;a dagger drawn toward the heart of Islam,&quot; in 2005 he described his red line as &quot;no nudity,&quot; in a campaign meeting with Iranian youth.

Ahmadinejad used mosque networks and his personal ties to the Revolutionary Guards and Basij for his campaign. In TV advertisements he was shown praying and praising veterans of the Iran–Iraq War for their sacrifices. He campaigned in an old 1977 Peugeot 504 car.

Some voters, including exiled citizens belonging to opposition political groups or monarchists (both living outside Iran), some parts of the intellectual community living in Iran, and even a few reformists boycotted the election as a symbol of not supporting the current regime and its practices. The boycotters&#x27; reasons included the massive rejection of registered candidates, that they believed that the role of the Iranian president is insignificant in the power structure and overshadowed by those of the supreme leader who is practically elected for life, and that they believed that all the candidates had already helped the regime in the oppression of its political opposition or would do so if elected. The most famous boycott leader was Akbar Ganji, imprisoned in Evin prison for his journalism and in a hunger strike.

While some members of the intellectual community in Iran supported the boycott, some key figures, residing inside Iran or exiled to Europe or North America, had asked their readers and the general population to vote in the election, reasoning that not voting in the election would result in the election of one of the three conservative candidates, who were all military people with a background in Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps. The most famous supporters of voting in the intellectual community included Ebrahim Nabavi, Masoud Behnoud, and Khashayar Deyhimi. These people were mostly supporting Moeen as their preferred candidate who is considered to be the least aligned with Ayatollah Khamenei, but a few have also talked or written in support of Rafsanjanī or Karroubi. Emadeddin Baghi, the President of the Iranian Association for Supporting Prisoners&#x27; Rights and one of the boycotters, has also spoken in support of Rafsanjani and mentioned that while he still considers Rafsanjani a conservative, he prefers his traditional conservatism to Ahmadinejad&#x27;s fundamentalism.

===Endorsements===
;First round 
==Opinion polls==

==Conduct==
After the first round of the election, some people, including Mehdi Karroubi, the pragmatic reformist candidate who ranked third in the first round but was the first when partial results were first published, have alleged that a network of mosques, the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps military forces, and Basij militia forces have been illegally used to generate and mobilize support for Ahmadinejad. Karroubi has explicitly alleged that Mojtaba Khamenei, a son of the Supreme Leader Ayatollah Khamenei, was involved. Ayatollah Khamenei then wrote to Karroubi and mentioned that these allegations are below his dignity and will result in a crisis in Iran, which he will not allow. As a reply, Karroubi resigned from all his political posts, including an Advisor to the Supreme Leader and a member of Expediency Discernment Council, on both of which he had been installed by Khamenei. The day after, on 20 June, a few reformist morning newspapers, &quot;Eghbal&quot;, &quot;Hayat-e No&quot;, &quot;Aftab-e Yazd&quot;, and &quot;Etemaad&quot; were stopped from distribution by the general prosecutor of Tehran, Saeed Mortazavi, for publishing Karroubi&#x27;s letter.

Akbar Rafsanjanī, the leading candidate, has also pointed to organized and unjust interventions by &quot;guiding&quot; the votes, and has supported Karroubi&#x27;s complaint.

A suspicious election result pointed out by Western journalist Christopher de Bellaigue was a 95% voter turnout and first-place result for Ahmadinejad in the province of South Khorasan. This despite that region&#x27;s large numbers of disgruntled Sunni Muslims, and Ahmadinejad&#x27;s association with &quot;intrusive Shia Islamism.&quot;

Also, some political groups, including the reformist party Islamic Iran Participation Front, have alleged that Ahmadinejad had only ranked second because of the illegal support and advertising activities for him during the voting by the supervisors selected by the Guardian Council, while the supervisors should have remained impartisan according to the election law. Also, the reformist newspaper &quot;Shargh&quot; has pointed to an announcement by Movahhedi Kermani, the official representative of the supreme leader in Islamic Revolutionary Guards Corps, mentioning &quot;vote for a person who keeps to the minimum in his advertisements and doesn&#x27;t lavish&quot;, which uniquely pointed to Ahmadinejad.

Some of the controversies involve activities of the Guardian Council such as the publishing an opinion poll before the election giving Ahmadinejad front-runner status. It also announced the partial results of the election on the day after the election, putting Ahmadinejad on the second rank while he was still in the third rank in the partial statistics published by the Ministry of Interior, which led to President Khatami going to the Ministry several times and explicitly asking the council to not announce any more partial results.

==Results==
The Islamic Republic government of Iran, especially the Supreme Leader and the higher offices, publicly considers the turnout of the voters, which was about 64% in the first round, to resemble the support of the population for the regime, while some voters consider voting for the candidates less aligned with the supreme leader as a vote against the current practices of the regime. Comparative to other elections, there does not seem to be any major drop in number of votes caused by boycott. The turnout in the previous election, i.e. Khatami&#x27;s second term, was at 67%.

The first round of the election was a very close race with minor differences in the number of votes won by each candidate which led to a run-off a week later with Ahmadinejad and ex-president Akbar Hashemi Rafsanjani participating. There were seven people running for the post out of more than a thousand initial candidates, most of whom were disqualified by the Guardian Council, which is responsible for vetting by constitution for election. Rafsanjani, who had been regarded as the front-runner and had positioned himself as a centrist, was defeated by Ahmadinejad in the run-off, while reformist candidate Mostafa Moeen fared poorly and finished only fifth in the first round.

After the results of the first round, many of the supporters of the boycott supported Rafsanjani, and many of the supporters of the reformist candidates, including many supporters of Moeen, are doing the same. Islamic Iran Participation Front (IIPF) and Mojahedin of the Islamic Revolution Organization (MIRO), as the two main parties who supported Moeen, are included, with IIPF asking for &quot;uniting against the rise of religious fascism&quot; and MIRO telling about the rival &quot;&quot;Führer&quot;-istic mindset&quot;. Moeen himself has mentioned that he will not personally vote in the second round, but that his supporters &quot;should take the danger of fascism seriously&quot; and should not think about a boycott in the second round.

This was the first presidential runoff in the history of Iran. Before the run-off took place, it was compared to the 2002 French presidential election, where the splintering of the left-wing vote similarly led to a run-off between the moderate Jacques Chirac and the far-right Jean-Marie Le Pen. The comparison was made because of the unexpected votes in favor of Ahmadinejad, the very close race, and the comparability of the political standings of Rafsanjani and Ahmadinejad to those of Chirac and Le Pen. But after the results for the run-off were made public, the comparison was considered void due to the loss of the moderate candidate Rafsanjani, although Ahmadinejad&#x27;s opponents formed an alliance against him.

<text>Cothen is a village in the Dutch province of Utrecht. It is a part of the municipality of Wijk bij Duurstede, and lies about southeast of Houten.

The skyline of Cothen is characterized by a church and a windmill called &quot;Oog In &#x27;t Zeil&quot;.

==History==
The village was first mentioned in the 12th century Coten, and means &quot;little house/farm&quot;. Cothen developed into a stretched out &quot;esdorp&quot; along the Kromme Rijn. was located on the other side of the river. The tower of the castle dates from the 14th century. The current building dates from 1873. The oldest parts of the Dutch Reformed Church are from the 13th century. The church burned down in 1673, and was rebuilt in 1735 and extended in 1890. 

In 1840, Cothen was home to 665 people. The grist mill Oog In &#x27;t Zeil was constructed in 1869. In 1904, an engine was installed in case there wasn&#x27;t enough wind. In 1936, the top was removed, and only the base remained. In 1985, the remainder burnt down, and the entire windmill was rebuilt in 1987. It is still sometimes for grinding. The village used to be a separate municipality. In 1996, it became a part of Wijk bij Duurstede.

<doc id="816137" wikidata="Q356418" url="?curid=816137" title="Stuart Pearce">
<text>Stuart Pearce (born 24 April 1962) is an English professional football manager and former player, who was most recently a first-team coach for Premier League club West Ham United. He was nicknamed &quot;Psycho&quot; for his unforgiving style of play.

As a player, Pearce played as a defender and appeared for Wealdstone, Coventry City, Nottingham Forest, Newcastle United, West Ham United and Manchester City in a career that spanned twenty-two years. He is best known for his twelve-year spell at Forest, where he regularly captained the team and became the club&#x27;s most capped international, making 76 of his 78 appearances for England while with the club and captaining the national side on nine occasions. In 2016, he briefly came out of retirement, signing a one-match deal with Longford, from a town in Gloucestershire, a team dubbed &quot;the worst in Great Britain&quot;, in order to support the grassroots game.

Pearce&#x27;s managerial career began at Nottingham Forest in a caretaker role, from December 1996 to May 1997. In November 2000, he was assistant coach to Peter Taylor in Taylor&#x27;s only match in charge of England. Following his retirement in 2002, he remained with Manchester City as a coach under Kevin Keegan. In 2005, he was named caretaker manager and was given the job permanently that summer. In 2007, he was named caretaker manager of the England national under-21 team, guiding them to the semi-finals of the 2007 UEFA Under-21 Championship. After being sacked by City in May 2007, he was given the England U21 job permanently a month later. Under Pearce, the team finished as runners-up in the 2009 UEFA Under-21 Championship, but failed to make it out of the group stage in the 2013 UEFA Under-21 Championship. In addition, Pearce was an assistant coach under Fabio Capello, managed the Great Britain Olympic football team at the 2012 Summer Olympics, and was caretaker manager of England for one game in February 2012. In 2013, he left the U21s, as his contract was not extended by the Football Association. He returned to Nottingham Forest as manager in July 2014, and initially began the season well, but after a run of poor form, he was sacked in February 2015. He has since coached at Portsmouth and at West Ham United.

==Early life==
Born in Shepherd&#x27;s Bush, Hammersmith, London, Pearce is the youngest of four children. He has two brothers, Dennis and Ray, and a sister, Pamela. Dennis was once a member of the far right British National Party and was third on the BNP list for London for the 2009 European Parliament election. Ray was formerly a referee, and in September 1986, was a linesman in a League Cup match involving his brother. Pearce first attended Fryent Primary School in Kingsbury, North West London, before attending Claremont High School in Kenton.

==Club career==

===Early career===
Pearce failed a trial at Queens Park Rangers and then rejected an offer from Hull City, instead settling into a career in the non-league game with his local side, Wealdstone, while training and working as an electrician. For almost five years, he was the first-choice full-back for the team, then amongst the biggest names of non-league football in the Alliance Premier League.

===Coventry City===
In 1983, Wealdstone received an unexpected offer of £30,000 (then a very large sum for a semi-professional player) for Pearce from top-flight club Coventry City. &quot;Sky Blues&quot; manager Bobby Gould had been to watch Wealdstone and was impressed by Pearce&#x27;s determination and combative attitude. Pearce agreed to the step-up in clubs reluctantly – making his professional debut for Coventry immediately. He established himself as an uncompromising left-back who played in a hard but fair manner.

===Nottingham Forest===
Two years later in 1985, Pearce was brought to Nottingham Forest by manager Brian Clough in a combined deal which also saw Coventry centre-back Ian Butterworth move to Forest. Despite the transfer, Pearce was still unsure of his prospects in the professional game and even advertised his services as an electrician in Forest&#x27;s match-day programme.

Pearce spent twelve years at Forest, most of it as club captain. During his playing career, he won two League Cups and the Full Members Cup, while also scoring from a free-kick in the 1991 FA Cup final, when Forest were beaten by Tottenham Hotspur. In his time at the City Ground, Pearce was one of the Forest players who had to cope with the horrors of the Hillsborough disaster during the opening minutes of their FA Cup semi-final against Liverpool. Pearce played in the rescheduled match at Old Trafford, which Liverpool won 3–1. He helped them finish third in the league that year (as they had done a year earlier), and also contributed to their victories in the League Cup and Full Members Cup. He helped them retain the League Cup a year later and in 1991 he had his first crack at the FA Cup, and despite giving Forest an early lead against Tottenham in a match most remembered for the knee injury suffered by Pearce&#x27;s opponent Paul Gascoigne, Pearce ended up on the losing side as Spurs came back to win 2–1. He missed out on a Wembley appearance the following season as Forest lost 1–0 to Manchester United in the 1992 League Cup final.

In 1993, Forest were relegated from the Premier League and Brian Clough resigned after 18 years as manager, but Pearce opted to stay at the City Ground and captained Forest to an instant return to the top flight as Division One runners-up. He helped Forest finish third in the Premier League in 1995 and reach the UEFA Cup quarter-finals in 1996.

In 1996–97 season, Forest struggled in the league and manager Frank Clark resigned in December, which saw 34-year-old Pearce appointed caretaker player-manager of Forest in December 1996. His first match in charge was at home to Arsenal in the league. He admitted in an interview with &quot;Match of the Day&quot; that, in his first attempt at picking a starting XI, he did not realise until it was pointed out to him by his wife that he had omitted goalkeeper Mark Crossley. Forest, however, won the match 2–1, coming from behind after an Ian Wright goal with two goals from Alfie Haaland. Despite winning Manager of the Month award in January 1997, he would later share the caretaker role with Dave Bassett, and Forest were relegated, finishing in bottom place.

Pearce opted to leave the club on a free transfer at the end of the 1996–97 season after 12 years at the City Ground.

===Later career===
Pearce joined Newcastle United along with fellow veterans John Barnes and Ian Rush in the 1997–98 season under Kenny Dalglish, and played in the 1998 FA Cup final, though again he emerged on the defeated side. He scored once during his spell at Newcastle, in a UEFA Champions League tie against Dynamo Kyiv. Eventually, Pearce was isolated, along with other players including Barnes and Rob Lee, after Ruud Gullit succeeded Dalglish. A number of players were treated coldly by Gullit, and Pearce along with Barnes and Lee were made to train with the reserves despite cumulatively having over 150 England caps between them. As result Pearce didn&#x27;t make any first team appearances for Newcastle after December 1998. Both Pearce and Barnes assert in their autobiographies Gullit felt threatened by the senior players in the squad, and they felt they were being sidelined to prevent them challenging him for the manager&#x27;s position should it arise. Pearce claims also that he once kicked Gullit up in the air during a training session, and a number of other players sniggered at this due to Gullit&#x27;s poor relationship with them.

Pearce went on to play for West Ham United, a year after falling out of favour with Gullit. He made his debut on 7 August 1999 in a 1–0 home win against Tottenham Hotspur. His first goal came on 21 October 2000 in a 2–1 home defeat to Arsenal. He made 50 appearances in all competitions, scoring three goals and in 2001 he was named Hammer of the Year.

In the summer of 2001, he was Kevin Keegan&#x27;s first signing for Manchester City for what would be the final season in his career. He captained the club to the First Division championship and scored direct from a free-kick on his debut, against Watford. In the final game of his career, against Portsmouth, he had the chance to reach 100 career goals. He took a penalty kick for City four minutes into injury time, but missed it along with the chance to reach his target.

===Amateur football===
On 28 January 2016, at the age of 53 and more than thirteen years after retiring, Pearce signed as a player for non-league side Longford, a club from Longford, Gloucestershire. The club was dubbed as &quot;the worst in the UK&quot; as they lost all their games at that date with a single goal scored and 179 conceded and lying at the bottom of the Gloucestershire Northern Senior League Division Two, the 13th tier of English football. On 12 March, Pearce made his debut for Longford as a second-half substitute in a 1–0 loss against Wotton Rovers.

==Style of play==
Throughout his career, Pearce was given the nickname of &quot;Psycho&quot; for his unforgiving style of play. This was initially a tag afforded to him only by Forest fans, though later it was adopted by England supporters as well. Of the nickname, Pearce later commented:

Roy Keane, who played with Pearce from 1990 to 1993, is quoted as saying that Pearce was &quot;a man amongst boys&quot; at Forest. Former England teammate Matt Le Tissier has since described him as his scariest opponent in his autobiography, &quot;Taking Le Tiss&quot;.

Pearce was also well known for his prowess from set pieces, being a designated penalty-taker for club and country. As a specialist at direct free kicks, renowned for his powerful left foot, Pearce scored from several of the free kicks that he took, famously including the first goal in the 1991 FA Cup final against Tottenham He was also a notable attacking threat going forward and a good crosser of the ball.

==International career==
Pearce made his debut for England against Brazil in a 1–1 friendly draw at Wembley on 19 May 1987 at age 25. Replacing Kenny Sansom as the first choice left-back for his country, injury prevented him from playing in the 1988 UEFA European Championship. Following the tournament, he was consistently picked as left-back and scored his first England goal in his 21st senior appearance for England on 25 April 1990, scoring in a 4–2 friendly win over Czechoslovakia at Wembley.

Pearce played at the 1990 FIFA World Cup, setting up a goal for David Platt in the quarter-final win against Cameroon and operating as a more attacking left-back than normal as England deployed a sweeper system. England progressed to the semi-finals, and Pearce was one of two players (the other being Chris Waddle) to miss a penalty in the shoot-out against West Germany after the match had ended in a 1–1 draw. Pearce left the field in tears.

The following summer, on 8 June 1991, Pearce scored his second England goal in a 2–0 win over New Zealand during the England side&#x27;s tour of Oceania. This game was his 40th appearance for England.

The Euro 96 games had been England&#x27;s first competitive matches since the end of the World Cup qualifiers nearly three years earlier. They had not been required to qualify for the tournament due to being hosts. All of the matches played between November 1993 and June 1996 had been friendlies, including the clash with Switzerland on 15 November 1995 in which Pearce scored the last of his five goals for England. When Terry Venables became England coach later in 1994, Pearce lost his place to Graeme Le Saux, but then regained it after Le Saux suffered a broken leg in December 1995. Pearce stayed in the side into Euro 96, scoring a penalty in a quarter-final shoot-out against Spain, which England won. His impassioned reaction following his successful penalty in front of the celebrating Wembley crowd became one of the images of the tournament. He also scored in the semi-final shoot-out against Germany, but Germany again won after Gareth Southgate missed his spot-kick.

Pearce was not selected for the 1998 World Cup by new coach Glenn Hoddle, but the appointment of Kevin Keegan as Hoddle&#x27;s replacement and Pearce&#x27;s form for West Ham prompted a recall for the 37-year-old for two qualifying games for Euro 2000. Pearce&#x27;s broken leg later put paid to further international chances and he ended his international career in 1999 with 78 caps, which for a time put him in the all-time top ten for England appearances. Pearce&#x27;s last appearance for England was in a goalless draw in Poland on 8 September 1999 in the Euro 2000 qualifiers. At 37 years and 137 days, he was the third-oldest outfield player ever to appear for England (only Stanley Matthews and Leslie Compton, plus five goalkeepers, have been older).

During his one match tenure, Peter Taylor appointed Pearce as assistant manager. England played, and lost to, Italy away in Turin.

==Coaching career==

===Manchester City===
After ending his playing career with Manchester City, he remained at the club as a coach under manager Kevin Keegan. In March 2005, less than three years after retiring, he was appointed caretaker of City after Keegan left the club. His first win was against Liverpool, on 9 April 2005, as Kiki Musampa scored the goal in injury time with a firm volley past Scott Carson. After a successful run of form, which put the club close to UEFA Cup qualification, Pearce was given the job on a permanent basis. However, they missed the opportunity to reach Europe on the final game of the season by drawing 1–1 with Middlesbrough. Robbie Fowler missed a penalty in the last minute which, if it had gone in, would have given City a UEFA Cup place.

Despite a successful start to the 2005–06 season, City finished 15th in the Premier League due to losing nine of the last ten games. They were also eliminated from the League Cup by League One side Doncaster Rovers. Pearce developed the reputation as being unusually fair and honest by refusing to criticise referees for mistakes they may have made. He was also touted as a potential successor for England manager Sven-Göran Eriksson.

Pearce failed to bring about an improvement in the 2006–07 season which saw City come close to relegation. The club were again eliminated from the League Cup by a League One team, this time by Chesterfield. The side also scored just ten goals at home in the league, and zero after New Year&#x27;s Day in 2007, a record low in top-flight English football. Pearce was sacked at the end of the season in May 2007.

===England under-21 national team===
In February 2007, before his sacking by Manchester City, Pearce had been appointed manager of the England national under-21 team, initially part-time in conjunction with his role at Man City. Under his guidance, England reached the semi-finals of the 2007 UEFA Under-21 Championships but were eliminated on penalties by the hosts, the Netherlands. This success, coupled with the ending of his job at City, saw him appointed as the full-time manager of the England under-21 team in July 2007.

His role in the England set-up was extended in January 2008 when new manager Fabio Capello appointed Pearce as a coach for the senior England team in addition to his under-21 duties. Following Capello&#x27;s resignation, in February 2012 Pearce acted as caretaker manager for the senior team; his sole match in charge was a 3–2 loss in a friendly against the Netherlands.

In June 2009, Pearce guided the under-21s to the final of the 2009 UEFA Under-21 Championship, where they lost 4–0 to Germany. He was also manager of the U21 team which reached the 2013 UEFA Under-21 Championship in Israel, where they were eliminated after losing all their group matches. On 19 June 2013, it was announced by the FA that his contract would not be extended.

===Great Britain Olympic football team===
Pearce managed the Great Britain Olympic football team for their matches at the 2012 Summer Olympics.

===Nottingham Forest===

Pearce was appointed as the manager of Nottingham Forest, effective from 1 July 2014. Under Pearce, Forest broke their transfer record by signing striker Britt Assombalonga from Peterborough United.

After leading Forest to an unbeaten start to the season, with thirteen points from an available fifteen, Pearce was named as a candidate for the league&#x27;s Manager of the Month award for August. He was beaten by Kenny Jackett of Wolverhampton Wanderers, despite taking Forest to the top of the table by the end of August 2014 after a 1–0 away win against Sheffield Wednesday. On 14 September 2014, Forest lost key players Chris Cohen and Andy Reid to injury in a 1–1 draw with Derby County, and Forest quickly lost form. The team managed only three wins in twenty-one Championship matches, and was also knocked out of the FA Cup by Rochdale. Pearce did manage to win the reverse fixture against Derby and bring the Brian Clough Trophy back to the City Ground, but this was not enough to keep him in his job. He was sacked on 1 February 2015 with Forest in 12th position in the Championship.

===West Ham United===
After a spell working at Portsmouth, Pearce joined former club West Ham United as an assistant to manager, David Moyes, in November 2017. He left the east London club at the end of the 2017–18 season, after Moyes&#x27; contract was not renewed. In August 2020, Pearce returned to West Ham as a first-team coach, again assisting Moyes. At the end of the 2021–22 season Pearce left the club to pursue other interests.

==Personal life==
Pearce was married to Liz Cole for thirty years, with whom he has two children. His daughter Chelsea is an equestrian and has regularly competed in eventing since 2010, including riding at three European Championships for Great Britain. 

Pearce is a devotee of punk rock and is visible as one of the members of a frenetic audience featured on the inside sleeve of the album &quot;God&#x27;s Lonely Men&quot; by one of his favourite bands, the Lurkers. He lists the Stranglers as one of his favourite bands, having seen them in concert over 300 times. In 2021, he appeared in the music video for their single &quot;This Song&quot;.

In 1994, Pearce was accused of directing a racial slur at Paul Ince during a Nottingham Forest–Manchester United match. It was alleged Pearce called Ince an &quot;arrogant black cunt&quot;. Pearce has since admitted the offence, saying, &quot;It wasn&#x27;t right or appropriate at the time, or at any time.&quot;

In 1998, Pearce was involved in a serious car crash when the car he was driving was crushed by a lorry overturning and landing on the roof of the car. Pearce escaped with only minor hand injuries and a stiff back.

In January 1999 and in appreciation of his talents and his support for various charities, Pearce was made a Member of the Order of the British Empire (MBE) by Elizabeth II. His autobiography, &quot;Psycho&quot;, was released in 2001.

Pearce is a fan of rugby league and is occasionally seen at Warrington Wolves games.

Pearce has spent several years as a pundit and co-commentator on talkSPORT.

<text>Swenglish is a colloquial term referring to the English language heavily influenced by Swedish in terms of vocabulary, grammar, or pronunciation. 

== English heavily influenced by Swedish ==

The name &quot;Swenglish&quot; is a portmanteau term of the names of the two languages and is first recorded from 1938, making it one of the oldest names for a hybrid form of English. Other colloquial portmanteau words for Swenglish include (chronologically): &quot;Swinglish&quot; (from 1957), &quot;Swedlish&quot; (1995) and &quot;Sweglish&quot; (1996).
=== Pronunciation ===
Swedish is characterised by a strong word stress and phrase prosody that differs from that of English. 

There are words that are similar in meaning and pronunciation, that have different stress patterns. For example, verbs that end with &quot;-era&quot; in Swedish are often French loanwords, where the French word ends with a stressed &quot;-er&quot;. The Swedish word gets its stress point at the same place, but this is not true in English. A native Swedish speaker might mispronounce &quot;generate&quot; by following the pattern of the Swedish .

Swedish is a pitch accent language. Accent 1 is a low-high-low contour and accent 2 is a high-low-high-low contour, with the second peak in the second syllable. This can give Swenglish speakers a &quot;singing&quot; quality to their speech. Particularly when exaggerating their Swedish accent in English, speakers add an extra cadence to their words that most native English speakers lack.

Swedish lacks many common English phonemes. These are sometimes replaced by similar-sounding Swedish phonemes, or other English phonemes that are easier to pronounce. For example, when using the nearest Swedish vowels for the English words &quot;beer&quot; and &quot;bear&quot;, a native Swedish speaker might pronounce both as . In general, Swenglish will sound very articulated, due to Swedish vowels being more strongly articulated and not as often reduced to schwas.

Swedish also lacks some consonant phonemes common in English, such as voiceless dental fricative , which is typically realized as labiodental or a voiceless dental stop , leading to &quot;three&quot; being pronounced as &quot;free&quot; or &quot;tree&quot;. Other missing consonants include voiced dental fricative , which is typically realized as a voiced dental stop ), voiced alveolar fricative , which is typically realized voicelessly and voiced palato-alveolar fricative , which is realized voicelessly , somewhat more back , or as a voiced palatal approximant or fricative .

There are examples of Swenglish being used in Sweden as a means of brand management. The Swedish telecommunications company Tele2 has long aired commercials with a black sheep called &quot;Frank&quot;. The pun of the commercials, extolling inexpensive service, is based on the English word &quot;cheap&quot;, which usually is pronounced as &quot;sheep&quot; by Swedes—hence &quot;Frank&quot;.

=== Vocabulary and grammar ===
As with most non-native speech, native Swedish speakers may pick the wrong word when speaking English based on what sounds right in their own language. While Swedish and English share many words, both from their Germanic origins, and from later French and Latin influence, there are several Swedish-English false friends, such as &quot;nacke&quot; (similar to English &quot;neck&quot;) meaning &#x27;nape, back of the neck&#x27;, and &quot;eventuellt&quot; (similar to &quot;eventually&quot;) meaning &#x27;possibly&#x27;. Some loanwords have a more specific meaning in Swedish than the original English, such as &quot;keyboard&quot; meaning only &#x27;electronic keyboard, synthesizer&#x27;. Compare the list of Swedish-English false friends on Swedish Wikipedia.

Many Swedish compounds and expressions translate directly into English, but many others do not, even if the translations can be understood. For instance, the Swedish &quot;ta med&quot; means &#x27;bring&#x27;, but is often translated as the literal &quot;take with&quot;.

===Controversies===
In June 2010, BP&#x27;s Swedish chairman Carl-Henric Svanberg famously caused a PR uproar after the Deepwater Horizon oil spill by referring to the common people as &quot;the small people&quot;. This was influenced by the Swedish expression &quot;småfolket&quot;.

In December 2019, climate activist Greta Thunberg was criticised by some right-wing commentators after saying said politicians should be put &quot;against the wall&quot;, a term which in English can be interpreted as execution by firing squad. She later apologised, saying &quot;...that&#x27;s Swenglish: &#x27;att ställa någon mot väggen&#x27; (to put someone against the wall) means to hold someone accountable&quot;, and that she is against violence.

=== &quot;Svengelska&quot; ===
The Swedish language term &quot;svengelska&quot; refers not to Swenglish, but to spoken or written Swedish filled with an inordinate amount of English syntax and words, with the latter sometimes respelled according to the norms of Swedish phonetics, or calqued into Swedish.

English has become the &quot;lingua franca&quot; in many Swedish workplaces. Swedish speakers often modify English business-specific terms with Swedish endings, such as &quot;peaken&quot;, (&#x27;the peak&#x27; [of the season]), &quot;spotrater&quot; &#x27;spot rates&#x27;, and &quot;cancellera&quot; &#x27;cancel&#x27;.

<text>The red garra (Garra rufa), also known as the doctor fish or nibble fish, is a species of cyprinid that is native to a wide range of freshwater habitats in subtropical parts of Western Asia. This small fish typically is up to about in total length, but locally individuals can reach as much as .

In the wild, &quot;Garra rufa&quot; feed on detritus, algae and tiny animals (arthropods and other zooplankton).

==Distribution, habitat and taxonomy==
As traditionally defined, &quot;Garra rufa&quot; is native to Turkey, Syria, Jordan, Israel, Palestine, Iraq and Iran. Some of the main systems where it is found are the Kızıl, Seyhan, Ceyhan, Orontes, Queiq, Jordan, Tigris–Euphrates, Kor, and Mond river basins, but the species also inhabits other coastal river basins in the Levant and Iran, as well as the endorheic Lake Maharlu system. It lives in rivers, streams, canals, reservoirs, ponds and lakes, although it tends to avoid stagnant waters. It often is common or abundant, even in areas that are heavily influenced by humans like polluted canals.

The taxonomy of this species has been labelled with uncertainty. As traditionally defined (&quot;sensu lato&quot;), there are some morphological variations over its relatively large range and it has been recognized for several years that it likely was a species complex. Several subspecies have been described, but their validity is questionable and in the last few decades authorities have generally not recognized them. Nevertheless, reviews published since 2014 have provided genetic and morphologic evidence for recognizing some of them as separate species, while other new species have been described from the species complex. This includes &quot;G. turcica&quot; (formerly a subspecies) from its Turkish range, except the Tigris–Euphrates system, &quot;G. jordanica&quot; (new species) from the northern Dead Sea basin, including the Jordan River, in Israel, Jordan and Syria, &quot;G. gymnothorax&quot; (formerly a subspecies) from the Karun, Balarud and Bashar systems in Iran, &quot;G. mondica&quot; (new species) of the Mond River basin in Iran, and &quot;G. amirhosseini&quot; (new species) from the Sartang-e-Bijar Spring in the Tigris River system in Iran. &quot;G. jordanica&quot; and &quot;G. turcica&quot; have entirely separate ranges from true &quot;G. rufa&quot; (thus limiting its range to the Tigris–Euphrates system and river systems in Iran), but the others do overlap in range with true &quot;G. rufa&quot; or at least occur in the same river basins.

Other members of the &quot;G. rufa&quot; complex are &quot;G. barreimiae&quot;, &quot;G. elegans&quot;, &quot;G. ghorensis&quot;, &quot;G. longipinnis&quot;, &quot;G. nana&quot;, &quot;G. persica&quot;, &quot;G. rossica&quot; and &quot;G. sahilia&quot;, but these were generally recognized as valid species many years ago. Finally the complex includes four cavefish: &quot;G. lorestanensis&quot;, &quot;G. tashanensis&quot;, &quot;G. typhlops&quot; and &quot;G. widdowsoni&quot;.

==Fish pedicure==

Doctor fish facilities at spa resorts exist in many countries worldwide. In 2006, doctor fish spa resorts opened in Kangal, Turkey, Hakone, Japan, and Umag, Croatia, where the fish are used to clean the bathers at the spa. In 2008, two widely known doctor fish pedicure services were opened in the United States in Fairfax County, Virginia, and in Milwaukee, Wisconsin. Wisconsin ordered the closure of the doctor fish service shortly after its opening. In 2010, the first spa opened in the United Kingdom in Sheffield. In 2011, the UK Health Protection Agency issued a report assigning a &quot;very low&quot; risk of transferring infection from the procedure.

The practice is banned in several of the states in the United States and Canadian provinces as cosmetology regulators believe the practice is unsanitary, with the &quot;Wall Street Journal&quot; saying that &quot;cosmetology regulations generally mandate that tools need to be discarded or sanitized after each use. But epidermis-eating fish are too expensive to throw away&quot;. The procedure is legal in Quebec, with a few clinics in Montreal. The animal rights organization People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals (PETA), which opposes all human use of animals, denounces the practice, citing callous methods of international transportation and suggesting that the fish are deliberately starved between treatments to force them to eat an abnormal amount of food.

&quot;Garra rufa&quot; seen in the spa and aquarium trade mostly originate from commercial facilities in Israel and to a lesser degree Turkey. Since Israeli and many (but not all) Turkish populations of &quot;G. rufa&quot; now are recognized as &quot;G. jordanica&quot; and &quot;G. turcica&quot; instead, this leads to questions over the true identity of most of the fish seen in the trade. It is legally protected from capture from the wild in Turkey due to concerns of overharvesting. Despite its ability to survive in polluted waters, the species requires clean, well-oxygenated and moving waters to thrive in an aquarium. For treatment of skin diseases, aquarium specimens are not well-suited as the skin-feeding behavior fully manifests only under conditions where the food supply can be scarce and unpredictable.

When used as a prelude intended to enhance the effects of ultraviolet light expoure in psoriasis treatment, fish pedicure is known as ichthyotherapy.

<doc id="816157" wikidata="Q1018340" url="?curid=816157" title="Buzz (airline founded in 1999)">
<text>Buzz (styled as buzz) was a British low-cost airline operating services within Europe. It was founded in 1999 as a subsidiary of Dutch national airline KLM and began operations on 4 January 2000. After being acquired by Ryanair in April 2003, it ceased operations at the end of October 2004. In 2019, Ryanair revived the Buzz name by rebranding its Polish subsidiary Ryanair Sun.

== History ==
Buzz was launched by KLM as a sub-brand of KLM uk to compete with other low-cost carriers such as EasyJet, Go Fly and Ryanair by taking over many of the point-to-point routes of the former AirUK/KLM uk network. It started with 8 British Aerospace (BAe) 146-300 aircraft transferred from the KLM uk brand which retained the Amsterdam feeder routes (transferred to KLM Cityhopper in November 2002). This was shortly followed by two leased ex-Deutsche BA Boeing 737-300 aircraft. In late 2002, buzz leased from ILFC another 6 737-300s previously operated by Continental Airlines and the first 2 737s were returned to lessor Shananda in early 2003. Buzz also was the first low-cost airline trying to attract the high yield business travel segment, especially by promoting its flights to/from London Stansted to Frankfurt (international airport) and Düsseldorf. Buzz had a local commercial manager in Germany (2000–2003) who established the first direct contacts to corporates, TMs (Travel Managers) and TMCs (Travel Management Companies).

On 31 January 2003 KLM announced its intention to sell Buzz to Ryanair for a price estimated to be in the region of €20.1 million. The sale was completed on 10 April 2003 following approval from the UK Office of Fair Trading (OFT). In addition to acquiring Buzz slots at London Stansted Airport, Ryanair acquired the leases of all 6 of the Boeing 737s and sub-leased 4 of the BAe 146s from KLM.

In order to capitalise on the acquisition and save costs, Ryanair restarted Buzz as a wholly owned subsidiary called Buzz Stansted, which retained the 10 aircraft on the UK register. Several of the original Buzz operations staff were transferred to the new organisation and an application was made for a new Air Operators Certificate (AOC). After route proving flights on 25 April 2003 an AOC was issued by the British Civil Aviation Authority on 28 April 2003 with the first revenue sectors being operated the same day.

The aircraft fleet, the majority of which retained the Buzz livery, flew several of the original Buzz routes and some Ryanair routes that had been operated by 737-200s under the Ryanair call sign. However, the BAe 146 aircraft were returned to KLM in January 2004 and the 737s continued operating the remaining routes that were not dropped following the withdrawal of the 146s.
In September 2004, Ryanair decided to close Buzz Stansted and flying operations ceased on 31 October 2004. The 737 aircraft were returned to ILFC and the Ryanair 737-800s took over from the Buzz aircraft. Ryanair also discontinued some of the original Buzz routes and redirected others to other airports as they were considered nearby to where existing Ryanair services operated.

===2019 Revival===
On 15 March 2019, Ryanair announced that they would revive the Buzz brand as the new name for Poland based Ryanair Sun.

==Fleet==
Before ceasing operations, the Buzz fleet consisted of the following aircraft:

<text>Jeskola Buzz is a freeware modular software music studio environment designed to run on Microsoft Windows using MFC. It is centered on a modular plugin-based machine view and a multiple pattern sequencer tracker.

Buzz consists of a plugin architecture that allows the audio to be routed from one plugin to another in many ways, similar to how cables carry an audio signal between physical pieces of hardware. All aspects of signal synthesis and manipulation are handled entirely by the plugin system. Signal synthesis is performed by &quot;generators&quot; such as synthesizers, noise generator functions, samplers, and trackers. The signal can then be manipulated further by &quot;effects&quot; such as distortions, filters, delays, and mastering plugins. Buzz also provides support through adapters to use VST/VSTi, DirectX/DXi, and DirectX Media Objects as generators and effects.

A few new classes of plugins do not fall under the normal generator and effect types. These include peer machines (signal and event automated controllers), recorders, wavetable editors, scripting engines, etc. Buzz signal output also uses a plugin system; the most practical drivers include ASIO, DirectSound, and MME. Buzz supports MIDI both internally and through several enhancements. Some MIDI features are limited or hacked together such as MIDI clock sync.

== Development ==
Buzz was created by Oskari Tammelin who named the software after his demogroup, Jeskola.

In 1997-98 Buzz was a &quot;3rd Generation Tracker&quot; and has since evolved beyond the traditional tracker model.

The development of the core program, buzz.exe, was halted on October 5, 2000, when the developer lost the source code to the program. It was announced in June 2008 that development would begin again, eventually regaining much of the functionality.

Development was restarted in June 2008.

== Plugin system ==
Buzz&#x27;s plugin system is intended to operate according to a free software model. The header files used to compile new plugins (known as the Buzzlib) contain a small notice that they are only to be used for making freeware plugins and Buzz file music players. The restriction requires that developers who wish to use the Buzz plugin system in their own sequencers pay a fee to the author.

==Notable users==

Some notable electronic musicians who use Jeskola Buzz include:
* Andrew Sega
* Hunz
* Andreas Tilliander
* James Holden, whose early work was produced entirely within Buzz.
* Lackluster
* Oliver Lieb
* The Field
* Simon Viklund

<doc id="816172" wikidata="Q295456" url="?curid=816172" title="Fernando Redondo">
<text>Fernando Carlos Redondo Neri (; born 6 June 1969) is an Argentine former professional footballer who played as a defensive midfielder. He most notably played for Real Madrid and AC Milan.

A defensive midfielder with the ability to contribute offensively and creatively, he turned professional playing for Argentinos Juniors and played one full decade in La Liga, for CD Tenerife and Real Madrid, then finished his career (curtailed by several injury problems) in Italy, with A.C. Milan. With Real Madrid, he won two La Liga championships and as many Champions League trophies, adding the 2003 Champions League with Milan.

Redondo was a member of the Argentina national team in the 1990s, representing the nation in the 1994 World Cup, and also winning the 1992 FIFA Confederations Cup and the 1993 Copa América.

==Club career==
===Early years / Tenerife===
Born in Adrogué, Buenos Aires Province, Redondo played his first game in the Primera División at only 16 for Argentinos Juniors, and remained five years with the team before moving abroad to Spain.

Redondo made his debut in La Liga with CD Tenerife, under the management of countryman Jorge Solari. During this period, Real Madrid twice lost the league title to arch-rivals FC Barcelona on the final day of the season, in matches against Tenerife who were managed by Jorge Valdano and, when the coach was appointed at Real Madrid in the summer of 1994, the player also made the move for a fee of US$5 million.

===Real Madrid===
The key years of Redondo&#x27;s career were spent at Real Madrid, where he won two league championships and the UEFA Champions League in 1998 and 2000. During the second victorious campaign in the latter competition, his performances won him the competition&#x27;s Most Valuable Player award, with new coach Vicente del Bosque utilising him in a midfield combination with Steve McManaman. In the quarter-finals against Manchester United at Old Trafford, he was the author of a spectacular play in which he dribbled past Henning Berg by backheeling the ball around him, recovering it and assisting Raúl for his side&#x27;s third goal (3–2 win, 3–2 on aggregate); after the game, opposing manager Alex Ferguson said &quot;What does this player have in his boots? A magnet?”. For his performances, he was subsequently voted the Champions League and UEFA Club Footballer of the Year footballer of the year.

During his time in Madrid, Redondo earned the nickname &quot;El Principe&quot; (&quot;The Prince&quot;). In April 2013 he was named by daily newspaper Marca as a member of the &quot;Best foreign eleven in Real Madrid&#x27;s history&quot;, and four years later was selected by its readers to the club&#x27;s all-time XI; during one full decade, he amassed Spanish top division totals of 268 games and 12 goals.

===AC Milan===
In 2000, Redondo transferred to Serie A club A.C. Milan in a controversial £11m move: he stated that he was not involved in transfer discussions and expressed his desire to stay at Madrid. In response, a section of Real Madrid supporters gathered outside the Santiago Bernabéu Stadium protesting the transfer. However, he suffered a serious knee injury in one of his first training sessions for his new team, and was unable to play for the next years; he suspended his £2.74m-a-year salary, and even tried to give back the house and car which the Milan board had given him.

Redondo did manage to contribute (albeit in a peripheral role) to Milan&#x27;s successes in the 2002–03 and 2003–04 seasons, making a combined 16 league appearances and adding five in the 2002–03 Champions League and six in the same edition of the Coppa Italia, including the two-legged final. In late 2004, at the age of 35, he retired from professional football following another knee injury.

==International career==
Redondo earned 29 caps for Argentina, the bulk of his appearances coming from 1992 to 1994 while Alfio Basile was the manager. His first appearance was on 18 June 1992, in a 2–0 friendly win over Australia.

Redondo turned down a call-up to the national team just before the 1990 FIFA World Cup, when it was coached by Carlos Salvador Bilardo. The player excused himself on account of not wanting to interrupt his law studies, but it was also reported that he objected to Bilardo&#x27;s defensive strategy. Redondo later explained: &quot;I was picked for Argentina&#x27;s World Cup squad in 1990 but I knew I wasn&#x27;t going to be in the starting line-up, I would just be another squad member, so I preferred to stay home.&quot;

In the 1994 World Cup, Redondo started in all of Argentina&#x27;s matches, but was unable to prevent the country from falling 2–3 to Romania in the round of 16. Following the tournament in the United States he refused to play under Daniel Passarella who had banned long hair, earrings and homosexuals in his squad, leading to disputes with several players. The former refused the latter&#x27;s demand to cut his hair, and was left out of the national team as even Diego Maradona and president Carlos Menem went on to take sides in the situation.

Passarella excluded Redondo from his 1998 World Cup squad, stating: &quot;Twice he was asked to play for the national team and twice he refused and gave a different reason each time. Then he announced publicly he did not want to play for the national team and I do not pick any player who does not want to play for Argentina.&quot; The player later explained: &quot;I was in great form. But he had particular ideas about discipline and wanted me to have my hair cut. I didn&#x27;t see what that had to do with playing football so I said no again.&quot;

In 1999, when Argentina was managed by Marcelo Bielsa, Redondo was recalled to the national side for two exhibition matches with Brazil. Although he was chosen &quot;Player of the match&quot; in the 2–0 victory in Buenos Aires he refused any subsequent call-ups, preferring to focus on club football; in 2015, he was included in an all-time team by the Argentine Football Association.

==Style of play==
An elegant deep-lying playmaker who played in front of the defence, Redondo&#x27;s main attributes were his creative passing, vision, technique and close control with his left foot, his ability to control the tempo of his team&#x27;s play in midfield making him a key member of the Real Madrid side of the 90s. Despite not having a great deal of pace, he possessed good acceleration and was an efficient and aggressive tackler, who contributed defensively just as much as he did offensively. As such, his role has also been likened to that of a &quot;metodista&quot; (&quot;centre-half,&quot; in Italian football jargon), due to his ability to dictate play in midfield as well as assist his team defensively.

Although he was regarded as one of the greatest midfielders of his generation, Redondo&#x27;s career was also largely marked by injuries, in particular during the final years of his career.

==Personal life==
Redondo was born into an industrialist family and enjoyed a wealthy upbringing, later studying law at university in the early years of his playing career. He married the cousin of fellow footballer Santiago Solari, and his sons Federico and Fernando Jr. were also involved in the sport.

An avid reader, Redondo counted Jorge Luis Borges and Gabriel García Márquez as his two favourite authors.

<doc id="816175" wikidata="Q44924" url="?curid=816175" title="Altbier">
<text>Altbier (, German for &quot;old beer&quot;) is a style of beer brewed in the Rhineland, especially around the city of Düsseldorf, Germany. It is a copper coloured beer whose name comes from it being top-fermented, an older method than the bottom fermentation of lagers.

== Characteristics ==
Altbier is usually a dark, copper colour. It is fermented at a moderate temperature using a top-fermenting yeast—which gives its flavour some fruitiness. Because Altbier is then matured at a cooler temperature, its flavour is more akin to lager beer styles than is the norm for top-fermented beers (such as British pale ale).

== Altbier in Germany ==
The first producer to use the name Altbier—to contrast its top-fermenting beer with the bottom-fermenting kinds—was the Schumacher brewery of Düsseldorf, that opened in 1838. Mass-market brewers of Altbier include Diebels and the Radeberger Gruppe under the brands Schlösser Alt and Hansa Alt. These are complemented by small breweries in Düsseldorf and other nearby cities.

Some Altbier breweries have a tradition of producing a stronger version, called &quot;sticke alt&quot;, coming from a local dialect word meaning &quot;secret&quot;. Originally made as a special reserve beer intended for the brewers&#x27; own consumption, today it is generally a seasonal or special occasion brew. 

There exists a regional rivalry between the drinkers of Altbier in the Düsseldorf area and the drinkers of Kölsch beer in the Cologne (Köln) area.

== Production ==
A beer variety associated with the Lower Rhine region, Altbier is especially found in Düsseldorf, Krefeld, and Mönchengladbach. 

=== Producers in Düsseldorf ===
There are seven bars in Düsseldorf which brew Altbier on the premises:
* Füchschen
* Kürzer
* Schumacher
* Schlüssel
* Uerige
* Alter Bahnhof (Gulasch Alt)
* Brauhaus Joh Albrecht (Johann Albrecht Alt)

Füchschen, Uerige, Schlüssel and Kürzer are all brewed and sold in the Altstadt (Old Town). Schumacher is between the Altstadt and the main train station (Hauptbahnhof), although it also has a pub in the Altstadt, Im Goldenen Kessel, across the street from Schlüssel.

Each brewpub produces a seasonal &quot;Sticke&quot; variant in small quantities, though the names vary: Schlüssel spells it &quot;Stike&quot;, without the &quot;c&quot;, while Schumacher calls its special beer &quot;Latzenbier&quot;, meaning &quot;slat beer&quot;, possibly because the kegs from which it was poured had been stored on raised shelves. Füchschen&#x27;s seasonal is its Weihnachtsbier (Christmas beer), available in bottles starting mid-November, and served in the brewpub on Christmas Eve.

=== Producers outside Düsseldorf ===
Altbier brewed outside Düsseldorf includes that produced by the Diebels brewery in Issum, the Gleumes brewery in Krefeld, the Bolten brewery in Korschenbroich, the Warsteiner brewery in Warstein (that owns the brand &quot;Frankenheim Alt&quot;, originally brewed in Düsseldorf), and the Fiege brewery in Bochum.

Altbier is somewhat similar to Cologne&#x27;s native beer style &quot;Kölsch&quot;, being warm-fermented at a lower temperature than British ales, and Altbier proper is also brewed as &quot;Ehrenfelder Alt&quot;, in Cologne&#x27;s smallest brewery &quot;Braustelle&quot;.

Pinkus Müller brewery in Münster produces an Altbier which is quite different to the Düsseldorf style, being pale and slightly tart.

===Producers outside Germany===
Altbier has been produced in the city of Venlo in the Netherlands since at least 1753. Venlo is on the border to Germany approximately 50 km (30 miles) from Düsseldorf. The beer was produced up until the Second World War, but then had a hiatus until its revival in 1983. It is produced by the Lindeboom brewery, who bought the recipe in 2001.

Altbier is brewed in small quantities in Austria, Switzerland, Hungary, Liechtenstein, the UK, the United States, Canada, Australia by Tooheys in Sydney New South Wales, New Zealand, Japan, South Africa, Norway, Brazil and Australia.

Versions of altbier are brewed in the United States, though not always to traditional recipes.

<text>Henry Nutcombe Oxenham (15 November 1829 – 23 March 1888) was an English ecclesiologist, theologian, author and translator. Originally ordained in the Church of England, he later converted to the Roman Catholic faith and was received into that Church.

==Biography==

He was born at Harrow School to William Oxnam and Mary Susanna (née Carter), where William Oxnam was a master, and was baptised at Eton, Buckinghamshire on 8 January 1830, where his uncle was Thomas Thellusson Carter. The family name changed from Oxnam to Oxenham in 1834, when Henry was four years old. From Harrow, Oxenham went to Balliol College, Oxford, where he was President of the Oxford Union in Trinity term, 1852. He took Anglican orders in 1854, but became a Roman Catholic in 1857. At first his thoughts turned towards the priesthood, and he spent some time at the London Oratory and at St Edmund&#x27;s College, Ware. Being unable, however, to surrender his belief in the validity of Anglican orders, he proceeded no further than minor orders in the Roman Church.

In 1863 he made a prolonged visit to Germany, where he studied the language and literature, and formed a close friendship with Döllinger, whose &quot;First Age of the Christian Church&quot; he translated in 1866. Oxenham was a regular contributor to the &quot;Saturday Review&quot;. A selection of his essays was published in &quot;Short Studies in Ecclesiastical History and Biography&quot; (1884), and &quot;Short Studies, Ethical and Religious&quot; (1885). In 1876, he translated the second volume of Bishop Hefele&#x27;s &quot;History of the Councils of the Church&quot;, and published several pamphlets on the reunion of Christendom. His &quot;Catholic Doctrine of the Atonement&quot; (1865) and &quot;Catholic Eschatology and Universalism&quot; (1876) are standard works.

He died on 23 March 1888 at Kensington, London, of undisclosed causes, aged 58. He never married.

==Anti-vivisection==

Oxenham was active in the anti-vivisection movement. He was one of the earliest members of the Victoria Street and International Society for the Protection of Animals from Vivisection. In 1878, he authored &quot;Moral and Religious Estimate of Vivisection&quot; for the &quot;Gentleman&#x27;s Magazine&quot;. An obituary in the &quot;The Animal&#x27;s Defender and Zoophilist&quot; noted that &quot;the anti-vivisection cause has lost a devoted adherent and a powerful champion by the recent death of Rev. Henry Nutcombe Oxenham&quot;.
