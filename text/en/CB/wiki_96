<text>[[Public holiday]]s in [[Italy]] are established by the Italian parliament and, with the exception of city or community patronal days, apply nationwide. These include a mix of national, religious and local observances. As for Whit Monday, there is an exception for South Tyrol. In Italy there are also State commemoration days, which are not public holidays.

==Overview==
Italy&#x27;s National Day, the &quot;Festa della Repubblica&quot; (&quot;Republic Day&quot;), is celebrated on 2 June each year, with the main celebration taking place in Rome, and commemorates the birth of the Italian Republic in 1946. The ceremony of the event organized in Rome includes the deposition of a laurel wreath as a tribute to the Italian Unknown Soldier at the Altare della Patria by the President of the Italian Republic and a military parade along Via dei Fori Imperiali in Rome.
Liberation Day is a national holiday in Italy that takes place on 25 April commemorating the victory of the Italian resistance movement against Nazi Germany and the Italian Social Republic, puppet state of the Nazis and rump state of the fascists, in the Italian Civil War, a civil war in Italy fought during World War II. The date was chosen by convention, as it was the day of the year in 1945 when the National Liberation Committee of Upper Italy (CLNAI) officially proclaimed the insurgency in a radio announcement, propounding the seizure of power by the CLNAI and proclaiming the death sentence for all fascist leaders (including Benito Mussolini, who was shot three days later).

17 March was proclaimed a national holiday in 1911, the 50th Anniversary of the Unification of Italy, in 1961, the 100th anniversary of the Unification of Italy, and in 2011, the 150th anniversary of the Unification of Italy. The law no. 222 of 23 November 2012 the &quot;Giornata dell&#x27;Unità nazionale, della Costituzione, dell&#x27;inno e della bandiera&quot; (&quot;Day of National Unity, the Constitution, the anthem and the flag&quot;) was established to be celebrated on 17 March of each year, on the day of the proclamation of the Unification of Italy in 1861, however it is not to be considered a festive day.

Until 1977 the following were also considered public holidays in Italy for civil purposes:

* 19 March, Saint Joseph Day;
* 40 days after Easter, Ascension of Jesus;
* 60 days after Easter, Corpus Christi;
* 29 June, Saints Peter and Paul, patron saints of Rome (it remained a public holiday only in the municipality of Rome);
* 4 November, National Unity and Armed Forces Day.

These public holidays were suppressed, during the austerity caused by the 1973 oil crisis, on the basis of the law n. 54 of 5 March 1977. In particular, in 1977 National Unity and Armed Forces Day became a moveable feast, and celebrations occurred every first Sunday of November. National Unity and Armed Forces Day is an Italian national day since 1919 which commemorates the victory in World War I, a war event considered the completion of the process of unification of Italy. It is celebrated every 4 November, which is the anniversary of the armistice of Villa Giusti becoming effective in 1918 declaring Austria-Hungary&#x27;s surrender. Italy entered World War I in 1915 with the aim of completing national unity and for this reason, the Italian intervention in World War I is also considered the Fourth Italian War of Independence, in a historiographical perspective that identifies in the latter the conclusion of the unification of Italy, whose military actions began during the revolutions of 1848 with the First Italian War of Independence.
In addition to the 12 national holidays, each city or town celebrates a public holiday on the occasion of the festival of the local patron saint. For example, Rome on 29 June (Saints Peter and Paul), Milan on 7 December (Saint Ambrose), Naples on 19 September (Saint Januarius), Venice on 25 April (Saint Mark the Evangelist) and Florence on 24 June (Saint John the Baptist). In South Tyrol, the holiday is instead on Whit Monday. This makes the total public holidays in Italy 13. 
Natale di Roma, historically known as &quot;Dies Romana&quot; and also referred to as Romaia, is the festival linked to the foundation of Rome, celebrated on 21 April. According to legend, Romulus is said to have founded the city of Rome on 21 April, 753 BC. From this date, the Roman chronology derived its system, known by the Latin phrase &quot;Ab Urbe condita&quot;, meaning &quot;from the founding of the City&quot;, which counted the years from this presumed foundation.

The Italian national patronal day, on 4 October, celebrates Saints Francis and Catherine. Notable patronal festivals in Italy are the Festival of Saint Agatha in Catania, the Feast of Saints Peter and Paul in Rome, the Feast of San Gennaro in Naples and Little Italy, New York and the Feast of Our Lady of the Hens in Pagani.

This number does not correspond to the number of days off work as public holidays falling on weekends are not transferred. When a holiday falls on a Tuesday or a Thursday it is common practice to make a &quot;ponte&quot; (pl. &quot;ponti&quot;. English: &quot;bridge&quot;) in order to have a long weekend. Schools are usually closed.

Christmas in Italy (in Italian: &quot;Natale&quot;) begins on 8 December, with the feast of the Immaculate Conception, the day on which traditionally the Christmas tree is mounted and ends on 6 January, of the following year with the Epiphany (in Italian: &quot;Epifania&quot;). The term &quot;Natale&quot; derives from the Latin &quot;natalis&quot;, which literally means &quot;birth&quot;. Easter in Italy () is one of that country&#x27;s major holidays. Easter in Italy enters Holy Week with Palm Sunday, Maundy Thursday, Good Friday and Holy Saturday, concluding with Easter Day and Easter Monday. Each day has a special significance.

During the Italian public holidays, peaks of tourist flows in Italy are recorded, particularly in winter due to the Christmas and New Year&#x27;s Day holidays, in spring, due to the Easter holidays, and in summer, due to the favourable climate. For internal tourism, peaks of tourist flows are also recorded on the occasion of the three national civil holidays, Liberation Day (25 April), International Workers&#x27; Day (1 May) and the &quot;Festa della Repubblica&quot; (2 June), as well as for three religious holidays, the &quot;Ferragosto&quot; (15 August), All Saints&#x27; Day (1 November) and the Feast of the Immaculate Conception (8 December), especially in the presence of &quot;ponti&quot;.

<text>Public holidays in Canada (), known as &quot;statutory holidays&quot;, &quot;stat holidays&quot;, or simply &quot;stats&quot; (), consist of a variety of cultural, nationalistic, and religious holidays that are legislated in Canada at the federal or provincial and territorial levels. While many of these holidays are honoured and acknowledged nationwide, provincial and territorial legislation varies in regard to which are officially recognized.

There are five nationwide statutory holidays and six additional holidays for federal employees. Each of the 13 provinces and territories observes a number of holidays in addition to the nationwide days, but each varies in regard to which are legislated as either statutory, optional, or not at all.

Many public and private employers, as well as school systems, provide additional days off around the end of December, often including at least a full or half-day on December 24 (Christmas Eve) or December 31 (New Year&#x27;s Eve) or in some cases, the entire week between Christmas and New Year. While not officially legislated in any capacity, internationally notable cultural holidays such as Valentine&#x27;s Day, Saint Patrick&#x27;s Day, Halloween, Mother&#x27;s Day, and Father&#x27;s Day are traditionally observed by Canadians as part of Canadian culture.

== Statutory holidays ==
A statutory holiday (also known as &quot;stats&quot; or &quot;general&quot; or &quot;public&quot; holiday) in Canada is legislated either through the federal government or a provincial or territorial government. Most workers, public and private, are entitled to take the day off with regular pay. However, some employers may require employees to work on such a holiday, but the employee must either receive a day off in lieu of the holiday or must be paid at a premium rate – usually (known as &quot;time and a half&quot;) or twice (known as &quot;double time&quot;) the regular pay for their time worked that day, in addition to the holiday pay. In most provinces, when a statutory holiday falls on a normal day off (generally a weekend), the following workday is considered a statutory holiday. Statistics Canada shows an average of 11 paid statutory holidays per year in regard to all firms and corporations operating within the province.

=== Nationwide statutory holidays in Canada ===
=== Federal statutory holidays, also observed in some provinces ===
In addition to the nationwide holidays listed above, the following holidays are mandated by federal legislation for federally regulated employees. All banks and post offices commemorate these holidays, and they are statutory in some provinces and territories.

=== Other common holidays ===
=== One-off holidays ===
Governments in Canada have declared one-off holidays on certain occasions, such as the death of a Canadian monarch. A one-off holiday was declared after the death of George VI on February 15, 1952, and after the death of Elizabeth II on September 19, 2022.

September 19 was named a national day of mourning () to commemorate Elizabeth II as Canada&#x27;s head of state. The day was a holiday for federal government employees. The provinces of British Columbia, New Brunswick, Newfoundland and Labrador, Nova Scotia, and Prince Edward Island also enacted provincial equivalents for the federal holiday. The provinces of Alberta, Ontario, Manitoba, Saskatchewan, and Quebec did not enact any holiday.

== Provincial and territorial holidays ==
Provinces and territories generally adopt the same holidays as the federal government with some variations.

These have not been observed as statutory holidays since 1992. They are, however, observed by the provincial government. Unlike most other provinces, there is no province-wide holiday on the first Monday in August. It may be seen as redundant due to the Royal St. John&#x27;s Regatta, which is observed as a civic holiday in St. John&#x27;s on the first Wednesday in August (or, in case of poor weather, the next suitable day thereafter). Harbour Grace and Labrador City have a similar holiday for their regatta in late July. All other municipalities are entitled to designate one day a year as a civic holiday; however, many do not take advantage of this.

=== Northwest Territories ===
Five nationwide holidays and five territorial statutory holidays.

Territorial statutory

* Victoria Day – Monday preceding May 25
* National Aboriginal Day – June 21
* Civic Holiday – first Monday in August
* Remembrance Day – November 11
* Thanksgiving – second Monday of October

=== Nova Scotia ===
Five nationwide holidays plus two provincial holidays. Victoria Day, Thanksgiving, and Boxing Day are not statutory holidays but most businesses and retail are closed Boxing Day. Most statutory holidays can be substituted for a mutually agreeable alternative paid day off in lieu or employers can require employees to work at a premium rate of pay. Several types of employment, including workplaces covered by a collective agreement, are exempt from provincial rules governing statutory holidays.

Provincial statutory

* Heritage Day – This holiday is held on the third Monday of February since 2015, and celebrates notable people, events and locations from the province&#x27;s history. In 2015, Heritage Day celebrated Black Nova Scotian civil rights activist and businesswoman Viola Desmond.
* Remembrance Day – November 11; this holiday has been governed separately from all other public holidays in Nova Scotia since 1981: it is illegal for any person to offer any goods or real property for sale on this date, or to accept or offer employment in exchange for gain or reward. There are special exemptions for workers who are employed in certain categories but an alternative day off with pay must be offered in lieu.

Optional

* Natal Day – first Monday in August; not a statutory holiday but a common day off in Halifax Regional Municipality.

=== Nunavut ===
Five nationwide and four territorial statutory holidays. Boxing Day is not a statutory holiday.

Territorial statutory

* Victoria Day – Monday preceding May 25
* Civic Holiday – first Monday in August
* Truth and Reconciliation – September 30
* Thanksgiving – second Monday in October
* Remembrance Day – November 11
* Nunavut Day – July 9, originated as a paid holiday for Nunavut Tunngavik Incorporated and regional Inuit associations. It became a half-day holiday for government employees in 1999 and a full day in 2001. Most employers give the day off with the notable exceptions being the federal government and the North West Company. Not a statutory holiday.

=== Ontario ===
Five nationwide and four provincial statutory holidays. Martin Luther King Jr. Day was officially recognized in Toronto in 2018 and has also been in Ottawa, though not as a paid holiday. 

Provincial statutory

* Family Day – third Monday in February
* Victoria Day – Monday preceding May 25
* Thanksgiving Day – second Monday of October
* Boxing Day – December 26

Optional

* Civic Holiday – first Monday in August; not a statutory holiday.
* Remembrance Day – November 11; not a statutory holiday.

=== Prince Edward Island ===
Five nationwide and three provincial statutory holidays.

Provincial statutory

* Islander Day – third Monday in February (originally second)
* Truth and Reconciliation Day – September 30
* Remembrance Day – November 11

Optional

* Gold Cup Parade Day - Third Friday in August. Celebrated in the capital city of Charlottetown marking the end of the Provincial Exhibition and the Gold Cup and Saucer race at the Charlottetown Driving Park. The day is observed as a holiday by some businesses in the central and eastern areas of the province.

=== Quebec ===
In Quebec, there are five nationwide and three provincial statutory holidays. Remembrance Day and Boxing Day are not statutory holidays, and there is no civic holiday in August. Many details of employment law are different in Quebec. The official statutory holidays are:
* January 1 (New Year’s Day)
* Good Friday or Easter Monday at the employer’s choice
* Monday preceding May 25 (National Patriots&#x27; Day)
* June 24 (Saint-Jean-Baptiste Day)
* July 1. If this date falls on a Sunday: July 2 (Canada Day)
* First Monday in September (Labour Day)
* Second Monday in October (Thanksgiving Day)
* December 25 (Christmas Day).

Optional

* Construction Holiday () takes place during the last two weeks of July and also the last two weeks of December for Christmas holidays. While it applies officially only to the construction industry, many other Quebecers arrange to take their vacations during these two weeks.

=== Saskatchewan ===
Five nationwide and five provincial statutory holidays.

Provincial statutory

* Family Day – third Monday in February
* Victoria Day – Monday preceding May 25
* Saskatchewan Day – first Monday in August. Celebration of Saskatchewan history and culture similar to Canada Day.
* Thanksgiving Day – second Monday in October
* Remembrance Day – November 11

=== Yukon ===
Five nationwide and four territorial statutory holidays. In addition, Easter Monday, Boxing Day, and Heritage Day are statutory for public service workers. Many employers give their employees days off that may not be statutory holidays in the particular province, particularly Boxing Day.

Territorial statutory

* Victoria Day – Monday preceding May 25
* Discovery Day – third Monday in August
* Thanksgiving Day – second Monday in October
* Remembrance Day – November 11
* National Aboriginal Day – June 21 since 2017

Optional

The following days are not Yukon statutory holidays:
* Heritage Day – Friday preceding the last Sunday in February – optional for non-public service workers
* Easter Monday
* Boxing Day

=== Municipal holidays ===
Some municipalities also have local statutory holidays. For instance, the morning of the Stampede Parade is often given as a half-day holiday in the city of Calgary. In Ontario, the August Civic Holiday is not defined provincially, but by each municipality.

== Civic holidays ==
In Canada, there are two definitions of the term &quot;civic holiday&quot;:

=== Legal definition ===
By law, a civic holiday is defined as any holiday which is legally recognized and for which employers are obliged to offer holiday pay.

=== August Civic Holiday ===
In parts of Canada, the term &quot;Civic Holiday&quot; is a generic name referring to the annual holiday on the first Monday of August. However, this definition is far from uniform nationwide as Quebec, Newfoundland, and Yukon do not recognize it at all (in the Yukon, a civic holiday is celebrated instead on the third Monday of August as Discovery Day). Five other provinces (Ontario, Alberta, Manitoba, Nova Scotia, and Prince Edward Island) do not oblige employers to offer holiday pay on this day, thus not making it a civic holiday in the legal sense. No universal name is recognized for this holiday – the official name varies between the provinces and even between municipalities within Ontario. In Saskatchewan, British Columbia, New Brunswick, Nunavut and the Northwest Territories, it is a statutory holiday.

The Civic Holiday is meant to replace a city&#x27;s birthday, also known as Natal Day. Instead of each city and town having a separate birthday celebration and day off, the Civic Holiday is observed. For example, the Halifax Regional Municipality is made up of the former cities of Halifax and Dartmouth and the town of Bedford. Each of these places used to hold civic birthday celebrations on different days. Many people lived in one jurisdiction but worked in another. This meant significant confusion arose as to which day a person would be excused from work.

This holiday is commonly referred to as &quot;August Long Weekend&quot; but this is not a government term.

== Proposed holidays ==
The other leading candidate for a new holiday is a weekend in February to celebrate the anniversary of the Canadian flag, or more likely a general &quot;Heritage Day&quot;. February 15 is already designated as Flag Day, but this is simply a day of commemoration, not a statutory holiday.

In April 2014, a private member&#x27;s bill to make Remembrance Day a legal holiday and give it the same status as Canada Day was introduced to the House of Commons. Bill C-597 passed second reading in the House of Commons by a margin of 258 to 2; however, it did not become law.

In 2001, members of the 14th Legislative Assembly of the Northwest Territories passed the &quot;National Aboriginal Day Act&quot;, making it the first jurisdiction in Canada to recognize this day as a formal statutory holiday.

== Holidays occurring on non-work days ==
For federally regulated workers, if a holiday occurs on a day that is normally not worked, then &quot;another day off with pay will be provided&quot;.

When New Year&#x27;s Day, Canada Day, Remembrance Day, Christmas Day or Boxing Day falls on a Saturday or Sunday which a federally regulated worker would not normally work, they are entitled to a holiday with pay on the working day immediately before or after the holiday. If one of the other holidays falls on a weekend, then the employer must add a holiday with pay to their employees’ annual vacation or give them a paid day off at another mutually convenient time.

== Other observances ==

* Raoul Wallenberg Day, January 17
* Groundhog Day, February 2
* Valentine&#x27;s Day, February 14
* National Flag of Canada Day, February 15
* International Women&#x27;s Day, March 8
* Commonwealth Day, the second Monday in March. This has been observed as a holiday in some Commonwealth countries.
* Saint Patrick&#x27;s Day, March 17
* April Fool&#x27;s Day, April 1
* Tartan Day, April 6
* Earth Day, April 22
* Victory in Europe Day, May 8
* Mother&#x27;s Day, second Sunday of May
* Father&#x27;s Day, third Sunday of June
* Loyalist Day, June 19, celebrating Canada&#x27;s Loyalist heritage, particularly in Ontario and New Brunswick (also the day Upper Canada was created, now Ontario)
* National Indigenous Peoples Day, June 21 as part of the &quot;Celebrate Canada&quot; series
* Canadian Multiculturalism Day, June 27 as part of the &quot;Celebrate Canada&quot; series
* National Peacekeepers&#x27; Day, August 9 observed on the closest Sunday
* National Grandparents&#x27; Day, second Sunday in September
* National Family Week, week preceding Thanksgiving
* Halloween, October 31
* National Day of Remembrance and Action on Violence Against Women, December 6

<doc id="843361" wikidata="Q423866" url="?curid=843361" title="Triptan">
<text>Triptans are a family of tryptamine-based drugs used as abortive medication in the treatment of migraines and cluster headaches. This drug class was first commercially introduced in the 1990s. While effective at treating individual headaches, they do not provide preventive treatment and are not considered a cure. They are not effective for the treatment of tension–type headache, except in persons who also experience migraines. Triptans do not relieve other kinds of pain.

The drugs of this class act as agonists for serotonin 5-HT1B and 5-HT1D receptors at blood vessels and nerve endings in the brain. The first clinically available triptan was sumatriptan, which has been marketed since 1991. Triptans have largely replaced ergotamines, an older class of medications used to relieve migraine and cluster headaches.

==Medical uses==
===Migraine===
Triptans are used for the treatment of severe migraine attacks or those that do not respond to NSAIDs or other over-the-counter drugs. Triptans are a mid-line treatment suitable for many migraineurs with typical attacks. They may not work for atypical or unusually severe migraine attacks, transformed migraine, or status migrainosus (continuous migraine).

Triptans are highly effective, reducing the symptoms or aborting the attack within 30 to 90 minutes in 70–80% of patients.

A test measuring a person&#x27;s skin sensitivity during a migraine may indicate whether the individual will respond to treatment with triptans. Triptans are most effective in those with no skin sensitivity; with skin sensitivity, it is best to take triptans within twenty minutes of the headache&#x27;s onset.

Oral rizatriptan and nasal zolmitriptan are the most used triptans for migraines in children.

====Correct timing of intake====
Triptans should be taken as soon as possible after the onset of pain. In case of migraine with aura they are to be taken after the aura and with the onset of pain. If taken too early, they may not have the full effect on symptom reduction, and in case of an aura, they can worsen the aura. It is assumed that blood vessels are constricted during the aura phase and dilated during the pain phase, so a constrictive medication like a triptan is not recommended during the aura.

===Cluster headache===
Triptans are effective for the treatment of cluster headache. This has been demonstrated for subcutaneous sumatriptan and intranasal zolmitriptan, the former of which is more effective according to a 2013 Cochrane review. Tablets were not considered appropriate in this review.

===Altitude sickness===
A single randomized controlled trial found that sumatriptan may be able to prevent altitude sickness.

===Available forms===
All marketed triptans are available in oral form; some in form of sublingual tablets. Sumatriptan and zolmitriptan are also available as nasal sprays. For sumatriptan, a number of other application forms are marketed: suppositories, a subcutaneous injection, an iontophoretic transdermal patch, which uses low voltage controlled by a pre-programmed microchip to deliver a single dose of sumatriptan through the skin within 30 minutes; a drug-device combination containing sumatriptan powder that is &quot;breath powered&quot; allowing the user to blow sumatriptan powder in to their nostrils; as well as a needle-free injection system that works with air pressure.
==Contraindications==
All triptans are contraindicated in patients with cardiovascular diseases (coronary spasms, symptomatic coronary artery disease, after a heart attack or stroke, uncontrolled hypertension, Raynaud&#x27;s disease, peripheral artery disease). Most triptans are also contraindicated during pregnancy and breastfeeding and for patients younger than 18; but sumatriptan and zolmitriptan nasal sprays are also approved for youths over 12. In spite of expert opinion and evidence to the contrary, the FDA and some other drug governance bodies have stated that monoamine oxidase inhibitors are contraindicated for sumatriptan, zolmitriptan and rizatriptan, and combination with ergot alkaloids such as ergotamine for all substances.

At least two triptans (sumatriptan and rizatriptan) have been listed under the unacceptable medication by the Canadian Blood Services as a potential risk to the recipient; hence, donors are required not to have taken the medication for the last 72 hours.

==Adverse effects==
Triptans have few side effects if used in correct dosage and frequency. The most common adverse effect is recurrence of migraine. A systematic review found that &quot;rizatriptan 10 mg was the only triptan with a recurrence rate greater than that of placebo&quot;.

There is a theoretical risk of coronary spasm in patients with established heart disease, and cardiac events after taking triptans may rarely occur.

==Interactions==
Combination of triptans with other serotonergic drugs such as ergot alkaloids, monoamine oxidase inhibitors, selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs), serotonin–norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors (SNRIs) or St John&#x27;s wort has been alleged to induce symptoms of a serotonin syndrome (a syndrome of changes in mental status, autonomic instability, neuromuscular abnormalities, and gastrointestinal symptoms), whereas scientific studies indicate there is no potential for life-threatening serotonin syndrome in patients taking triptans and SSRI or SNRIs at the same time, although the FDA has officially stated otherwise.&lt;ref name=&quot;FDA ALERT [7/2006]:&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; Combining triptans with ergot alkaloids is contraindicated because of the danger of coronary spasms.

In a study from Harvard Medical School and the University of Florida College of Medicine involving 47,968 patients and published on 26 February 2018, concomitant use of a selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor or selective norepinephrine reuptake inhibitor for depression with a triptan for migraine did not demonstrate an increased risk of the serotonin syndrome.

Pharmacokinetic interactions (for example, mediated by CYP liver enzymes or transporter proteins) are different for the individual substances; for most triptans, they are mild to absent. Eletriptan blood plasma levels are increased by strong inhibitors of CYP3A4, and frovatriptan levels by CYP1A2 inhibitors such as fluvoxamine.

==Pharmacology==

===Mechanism of action===

Their action is attributed to their agonist effects on serotonin 5-HT1B and 5-HT1D receptors in blood vessels (causing their constriction) and nerve endings in the brain, and subsequent inhibition of pro-inflammatory neuropeptide release, including CGRP and substance P. Triptans are selective agents for 5-HT1B and 5-HT1D and have low or even no affinity for other types of 5-HT receptors.

5-HT receptors are classified into seven different families named 5-HT1 to 5-HT7. All receptors are G protein coupled receptors with seven transmembrane domains with the one exception of 5-HT3 receptor which is a ligand gated ion channel. There is a high homology in the amino acid sequence within each family. Each family couples to the same second messenger systems. Subtypes of 5-HT1 are the 5-HT1A, 5-HT1B, 5-HT1D, 5-HT1E and 5-HT1F receptors. All 5-HT1D receptors are coupled to inhibition of adenylate cyclase. 5-HT1B and 5-HT1D receptors have been difficult to distinguish on a pharmacological basis. After cloning two distinct genes for 5-HT1B and 5-HT1D receptors, a better insight into distribution and expression in different tissues was gained, except in brain tissue where they are overlapping in several areas.

Most mammalian species, including humans, have 5-HT1D binding sites widely distributed throughout the central nervous system. 5-HT1D receptors are found in all areas of the brain but they differ in quantity at each area.
An important initiator of head pain is suggested to be the activation of trigeminovascular afferent nerves which upon activation releases neuropeptides such as CGRP, substance P and neurokinin A. Also they are thought to promote neurogenic inflammatory response important for sensitization of sensory afferents, and also transmission and generation of head pain centrally. 5-HT1D has been found responsible for inhibition of neurogenic inflammation upon administration with sumatriptan and other related compounds that act on prejunctional 5-HT1D receptors.

All triptans, like the older drug dihydroergotamine, have agonistic effects on the 5-HT1D receptor. Comparison of sumatriptan and dihydroergotamine showed that dihydroergotamine has high affinity and sumatriptan has medium affinity for 5-HT1D. Triptans have at least three modes of action. These antimigraine mechanisms are:

# vasoconstriction of pain producing intra cranial extracerebral vessels by a direct effect on vascular smooth muscle. Sumatriptan and rizatriptan have been shown to cause vasoconstriction in the human middle meningeal arteries.
# inhibition of vasoactive neuropeptide release by trigeminal terminals innervating intracranial vessels and the dura mater. The trigeminocervical complex has 5-HT1D receptors that bind dihydroergotamine and triptans in humans. Rizatriptan has been shown to block dural vasodilation and plasma protein extravasation by inhibiting the release of CGRP via activation of receptors on preganglionic trigeminal sensory nerver terminals. Sumatriptan is shown to inhibit potassium stimulated CGRP secretion from cultured trigeminal neurons in a dose dependant manner and may also inhibit the release of substance P.
# inhibition of nociceptive neurotransmission within the trigeminocervical complex in the brainstem and upper cervical spinal column. Rizatriptan has central trigeminal antinociceptive activity.
Other possibilities of triptans in antimigraine effects are modulation of nitric oxide dependent signal transduction pathways, nitric oxide scavenging in the brain, and sodium dependent cell metabolic activity.

===Pharmacokinetics===
Triptans have a wide variety of pharmacokinetic properties. Bioavailability is between 14% and 70%, biological half-life (T1/2) is between 2 and 26 hours. Their good ability to cross the blood–brain barrier and the rather long half life of some triptans may result in lower frequencies of migraine recurrence.

===Comparison===
Zolmitriptan is different from the other triptans because it is converted to an active N-desmethyl metabolite which has higher affinity for the 5-HT1D and 5-HT1B receptors; both substances have a biological half-life of 2 to 3 hours. In studies, newer triptans are mostly compared to sumatriptan. They are better than sumatriptan for their longer half-life in plasma and higher oral bioavailability, but have a higher potential for central nervous side effects.

Donitriptan and avitriptan were never marketed.

== History ==

The history of triptans began with the proposed existence of then unknown serotonin (5-hydroxytryptamine, 5-HT). In the late 1940s two groups of investigators, one in Italy and the other in the United States, identified a substance that was called &quot;serotonin&quot; in the US and &quot;enteramine&quot; in Italy. In the early 1950s it was confirmed that both substances were the same. In the mid-1950s it was proposed that serotonin had a role as a neurotransmitter in the central nervous system (CNS) of animals. Investigations of the mechanism of action were not very successful as experimental techniques were lacking.

Later in the 1960s, studies showed that vasoconstriction caused by 5-HT, noradrenaline and ergotamine could reduce migraine attacks. Patrick P.A. Humphrey among others at Glaxo started researching the 5-HT receptor to discover a more direct 5-HT agonist with fewer side effects.

They continued developing and working on a desirable action on 5-HT by 5-HT1 receptor activation for an anti-migraine drug. Continued work led to the development of sumatriptan, now known as the first 5-HT1 agonist, selective for the 5-HT1D/B receptors and also the 5-HT1F receptor with less affinity. By 1991 sumatriptan became available in clinical use in the Netherlands and in the US in 1993. However, there was always a debate about its mechanism of action, and it still remains unclear today. Later, Mike Moskowitz proposed a theory about &quot;neuronal extravasation&quot;, and this was the first clue that sumatriptan might have a direct neuronal effect in migraine attacks.

Sumatriptan became a prototype for other triptans that have been developed for improved selectivity for the 5-HT1D/B receptors.

==Society and culture==

===Legal status===
These drugs have been available only by prescription (US, Canada and UK), but sumatriptan became available over-the-counter in the UK in June 2006. The brand name of the OTC product in the UK is Imigran Recovery. The patent on Imitrex STATDose expired in December 2006, and injectable sumatriptan became available as a generic formula in August 2008. Sumavel Dosepro is a needle-free delivery of injectable sumatriptan that was approved in the US by the FDA in July 2009. Sumatriptan became available as a generic in the US in late 2009. It used to be sold over-the-counter in Romania under the Imigran brand; however, as of August 2014 prescription is required. Zecuity, a sumatriptan transdermal patch, was approved by the US FDA in January 2013. The sumatriptan nasal powder was approved by the FDA in January 2016 and became available in the U.S. May 2016. Naratriptan is available OTC in Germany and Brazil.

<text>A tea strainer is a type of strainer that is placed over or in a teacup to catch loose tea leaves.

When tea is brewed in the traditional manner in a teapot, the tea leaves are not contained in teabags; rather, they are freely suspended in the water. As the leaves themselves are not consumed with the tea, it is usual to filter them out with a tea strainer. Strainers usually fit into the top of the cup to catch the leaves as the tea is poured.

Some deeper tea strainers can also be used to brew single cups of tea, much as teabags or brewing baskets are used the strainer full of leaves is set in a cup to brew the tea. It is then removed, along with the spent tea leaves, when the tea is ready to drink. By using a tea strainer in this way, the same leaves can be used to brew multiple cups.

Despite the fact that tea strainer use has declined in the 20th century with mass production of the tea bag, it is still preferred among connoisseurs, who claim that keeping the leaves packed in a bag, rather than freely circulating, inhibits diffusion. Many assert that inferior ingredients, namely dust-quality tea, are often used in tea bags.

Tea strainers are usually either sterling silver, stainless steel, or china. Strainers often come in a set, with the strainer itself and a small saucer for it to rest on between cups. Tea strainers themselves have often been turned into artistic masterpieces of the silver- and goldsmith&#x27;s craft, as well as rarer specimens of fine porcelain.

Brewing baskets (or infusing baskets) resemble tea strainers, but are more typically put in the top of a teapot to keep the tea leaves contained during brewing. There is no definitive boundary between a brewing basket and a tea strainer, and the same tool might be used for both purposes.

==Other uses==
Tea strainers may also be used for separating milk solids from ghee. A further use is to separate the liquid from the solid when preparing Béarnaise sauce.

Tea strainers or a similar small sieve may also be used by patients trying to pass a kidney stone. The patient urinates through the strainer, thereby ensuring that, if a stone is passed, it will be caught for evaluation and diagnosis.

<text>There are eleven official public holidays in France, of which three are movable days which always fall on a weekday. The Alsace region and the Moselle department observe two additional days. These holidays do not shift when they fall during a weekend, which means that the average number of observed public holidays &quot;falling on weekdays&quot; (outside Alsace and Moselle) is 8.7 and ranges from seven to ten. Most Asian countries and all North American countries observe between two and ten more public holidays per year &quot;on weekdays&quot;.

==Notes==

&quot;Note:&quot; French law dictates that work should stop, but be paid only for the &quot;Fête du Travail&quot; (May Day, 1 May), except in industries where it is infeasible to stop working. The rest of the public holidays are listed in statute law, but law does not dictate that work should stop; however a leave from work may be granted by the employer or by &quot;convention collective&quot; (agreement between employers&#x27; and employees&#x27; unions).

In 2005, French prime minister Jean-Pierre Raffarin removed Pentecost (Whit) Monday&#x27;s status as a public holiday. This decision was eventually overruled by French courts in 2008. Employers are free to decide whether to make Whit Monday a day off or not.

<text>Congress Hall is a historic hotel in Cape May, Cape May County, New Jersey, United States, occupying a city block bordered on the south by Beach Avenue and on the east by Washington Street Mall. It is a contributing building in the Cape May National Historic District.

Congress Hall was first constructed in 1816 as a wooden boarding house for guests to the new seaside resort of Cape May; and the proprietor, Thomas H. Hughes, called it &quot;The Big House.&quot; Locals, thinking it too big to be successful, called it &quot;Tommy&#x27;s Folly.&quot; In 1828, when Hughes was elected to the House of Representatives, he changed the name of the hotel to Congress Hall. It burned to the ground in Cape May&#x27;s Great Fire of 1878, but within a year, its owners had rebuilt the hotel in brick in an effort to convince leery prospective guests that the building was fireproof.

While serving as President of the United States, Franklin Pierce, James Buchanan, Ulysses S. Grant and Benjamin Harrison vacationed at Congress Hall, and Harrison made Congress Hall his official Summer White House, becoming the center of state business for several months each year. John Philip Sousa regularly visited Congress Hall with the United States Marine Band and composed the &quot;Congress Hall March&quot;, which he conducted on its lawn in the summer of 1882.
During the 20th century, the Cape May seafront deteriorated, with tourists heading to other shore resorts. In 1968, Congress Hall was purchased by the Rev. Carl McIntire and became part of his Cape May Bible Conference. McIntire&#x27;s possession of the property preserved the hotel during a period in which many Victorian-era beachfront hotels were demolished for the value of their land.

With the decline of the Bible Conference, Congress Hall fell into a state of disrepair, with the hotel closing in 1992, though retail space in the building remained in use. The property was partially restored under the guidance of Curtis Bashaw, McIntire&#x27;s grandson, a $22 million restoration began in 1995 and completed in 2002. Congress Hall is a resort hotel and part of the Cape Resorts family of hotels.

Bashaw supplies the hotel and many of its restaurants with pork, eggs and vegetables from his Beach Plum Farm in West Cape May, New Jersey.

<text>After the city and the Amt Hemer were granted coat of arms in 1936, all of the remaining municipalities in the Amt received coat of arms until 1939. The municipalities which were no longer independent at that time did not receive coat of arms - Brockhausen was incorporated into Deilinghofen; Landhausen, Sundwig and Westig were incorporated into Hemer; Calle was split between Iserlohn and Hemer. Lössel had left the Amt in 1920 already, and thus did not receive a coat of arms at that time either.

All of the coat of arms expired when the Amt was dissolved in 1975, only the coat of arms of Evingsen expired already in 1969 when Evingsen was incorporated into Altena. Even though the coat of arms are no longer used officially, the communities in the former municipalities continue to use them unofficially. All coat of arms display three wolf hooks as the symbol of the Brabeck family. The common symbol was chosen to show the membership in the Amt.

<text>Praskovia Ivanovna Kovalyova-Zhemchugova (; July 20, 1768 – February 23, 1803) was a Russian serf actress and soprano opera singer.

== Career ==
Praskovia was one of the best opera singers in eighteenth-century Russia. and Figes describes her as Russia&#x27;s first &quot;superstar&quot;. She was born into the family of a serf blacksmith by the name of Ivan Gorbunov (a.k.a. Kovalyov) probably on the estate of Voshchazhnikovo in the province of Yaroslavl. Praskovia and her family belonged to the Sheremetevs, one of the richest noble families in Russia at the time, along with an estimated one million other serfs. As a young girl she moved with her family to the estate of Kuskovo outside Moscow. Soon thereafter she was taken from her family to serve as a chambermaid to Princess Martha Dolgorukaya, a relative of her master, Count Pyotr Sheremetev, who lived in the manor house.

When it was discovered that she had a fine voice, Praskovia, like other serfs who became artists, was trained to be a singer in the opera company then being put together by Count Pyotr and his son, Nikolai Sheremetev. She debuted in 1779 on the stage of the serf theatre at Kuskovo in the role of the servant Gubert in the comic opera by André Grétry. Following her success, Praskovia was given the leading role of Belinda in Antonio Sacchini&#x27;s opera . In this 1780 performance the actress for the first time appeared under the stage name Zhemchugova, &quot;The Pearl&quot;, (&quot;zhemchug&quot; means &quot;pearl&quot; in Russian). The other stars of the company were also given new names: Arina &quot;The Sapphire&quot;, Fekla &quot;The Turquoise&quot;, Tatyana &quot;The Garnet&quot;, Nikolai &quot;The Marble&quot;, Andrei &quot;The Flint&quot;, etc.

After the role of Belinda, Praskovia was promoted to the position of the first actress of the theatre. By the age of 17, she could read and write French] and Italian fluently, played the harp and clavichord, and was acknowledged by her contemporaries for her operatic and dramatic abilities.

In a career that spanned almost two decades, Praskovia performed in over a dozen operas, including Monsigny&#x27;s and , Paisiello&#x27;s , Jean-Jacques Rousseau&#x27;s , and Piccinni&#x27;s .

Her most important role was Eliane in Grétry&#x27;s opera . Assuming the part for the first time in 1785, Praskovia sang Eliane for 12 years — a first in the history of serf theatre. In 1787 Praskovia sang the role of Eliane at Kuskovo for Empress Catherine II and her suite. Catherine was so impressed by her performance that she requested to meet Praskovia and later gave her a diamond ring.

In the mid-1780s or early 1790s, Praskovya became the mistress of Count Nikolai Sheremetev. Nikolai was the impresario of the family serf theater, and he had helped train Praskovia over the years, eventually falling seriously in love with the young star of the troupe. The circumstances surrounding the early years of their relationship, like so much of Praskovia&#x27;s life, are unknown. After the death of Nikolai&#x27;s father in 1788, Nikolai and Praskovia set up a private household in a secluded corner of the Kuskovo estate. Their unorthodox relationship soon became the subject of gossip among aristocratic society, and Praskovia was resented by the other serfs.

In 1795 Praskovia, Nikolai, and the theatre troupe moved from Kuskovo to Ostankino, a brilliant new palace constructed north of Moscow with a large theatre intended for large-scale operas and immense balls. The year 1795 was marked by the premiere of the opera &quot;Zelmira and Smeloy, or the Capture of Izmail&quot; (Osip Kozlovsky, libretto by Pavel Potemkin); Praskovia acted in the role of the captive Turkish woman Zelmira). Praskovia performed here for Stanisław August Poniatowski, the last king of Poland.

== Later life ==
At the height of the theatre&#x27;s flowering in the late 1790s Praskovia became ill, possibly with tuberculosis, and was forced to retire. In late 1796, Nikolai was appointed to the court of Paul I and Praskovia moved with him to Saint Petersburg.

Although they lived as man and wife, and most people knew of this, Nikolai and Praskovia could not live their relationship openly. It was taboo for an aristocrat like Sheremetev to move about in society with a serf as his social equal, and marriage, especially for a man from the highest noble family, was theoretically out of the question. Finally, in 1798 Sheremetev emancipated Praskova and later the entire Kovalyov family from serfdom. Understanding that her health would not allow her to return to the stage, he closed the theatre.

In 1801 Nikolai and Praskovia married in Moscow in the strictest secrecy. As part of the arrangements, Nikolai had created a phony genealogy for Praskovia claiming that she was the long-lost descendant of a Polish nobleman by the name of Kovalevsky. Around the time of the wedding he sent a forger to Poland with a purse full of money to purchase a patent of nobility from a willing noble family.

Within months of their wedding Praskovia became pregnant. On February 3, 1803, she gave birth to a son, Dmitry. However, the burden of her illness along with pregnancy and childbirth was too much for her system and she died on February 23, at the Sheremetev palace in Saint Petersburg. Just before she died Nikolai informed Emperor Alexander I of his marriage and requested official recognition, which Alexander granted. News of the marriage scandalized society and angered Nikolai&#x27;s family. Nikolai&#x27;s two nephews, the Razumovsky brothers, had planned to inherit their uncle&#x27;s vast fortune, and upon hearing that they were to lose it all to the son of a serf they contemplated murdering the infant.

Praskovia was buried in an elaborate ceremony at the Alexander Nevsky Monastery attended by clergy and servants from the Sheremetev household. Nikolai was too overcome with grief to attend, and the nobility stayed away to signal their disapproval of Nikolai&#x27;s marriage.

Nikolai was overwhelmed with grief. Ultimately, the only comfort he found was in fulfilling her final wish that he contribute to caring for the poor and the sick. In memory of Praskovia, Nikolai built in Moscow on Sukharevskaya square, a large almshouse that tended to the sick, poor, and orphaned up until the revolution of 1917. Under the Soviets the almshouse was shut down and replaced by the Sklifosovsky Institute, a scientific research institute named after N. Sklifosovsky.

<text>Sammarinese Communist Refoundation (, RCS) was a communist political party in San Marino. It was a member of the European Left.

== History ==
It emerged in 1992 when the old Sammarinese Communist Party evolved into the Sammarinese Democratic Progressive Party and some members, on the example of the Italian Communist Refoundation Party, decided not to join the new party.

In the 2001 general election RCS won 3.4% of the vote, while in 2006 it gained 8.7% and 5 members of the Grand and General Council as part of the United Left, including the Left Party, a splinter group from the Party of Democrats. Since then it had been part of the 2006–2008 governing coalition along with the Party of Socialists and Democrats and Popular Alliance until tensions between its grouping, United Left, and the latter caused the coalition to disintegrate.

In the 2008 general election, United Left, the Sammarinese Communist Refoundation&#x27;s political grouping, was part of the Reforms and Freedom electoral coalition which won 25 seats out of 60 in the Grand and General Council gaining 45.78% of the national vote. The Sammarinese Communist Refoundation gained a few seats and a small percentage of the national vote as part of United Left which itself gained 5 seats and 8.57% of the national vote.

During the legislature, the United Left was restructured from an alliance to a single party, absorbing RCS.

<text>Lake Celilo is a long reservoir on the Columbia River in the United States, between the U.S. states of Washington and Oregon. It was created in 1957 with the construction of The Dalles Dam near The Dalles, Oregon, and stretches upstream to the John Day Dam. Its filling drowned the former site of Celilo Falls and the neighboring fishing and trade village sites. Celilo Village, a small, unincorporated community of Native Americans, still exists today, though it is no longer the thriving cultural and economic center it once was.

The reservoir lies in parts of Wasco and Sherman counties in Oregon, and Klickitat County in Washington.

<doc id="843423" wikidata="Q1935264" url="?curid=843423" title="Sammarinese Communist Party">
<text>The Sammarinese Communist Party (, abbreviated PCS) was a Marxist political party in the small European republic of San Marino.
It was founded in 1921 as a section of the Communist Party of Italy (PCI). The organization existed for its first two decades as an underground political organization.

Between 1945 and the spring of 1957 the PCS governed the country in coalition with the Sammarinese Socialist Party (PSS). The communist-socialist coalition lost power in the events known as .

The PCS returned to membership in a governing parliamentary coalition in 1978, with its adherents remaining as part of the leadership group until 1992. In 1991, with the fall of the Soviet Union, the PCS formally renounced communism and relaunched itself as the Sammarinese Democratic Progressive Party (PPDS).

== History ==
=== Establishment ===
San Marino is a European microstate, the third smallest in Europe, with an area of just 61 square kilometers (24 square miles). Despite its small size and tiny population, the tiny nation — wholly surrounded by Italy — was the home of a communist political party from 1921, the Communist Party of San Marino, , or PCS. The organization was established as a section of the Communist Party of Italy (PCI).

The party&#x27;s first two decades were spent in the political underground, as San Marino was dominated, like Italy, by the fascist movement in the form of the Sammarinese Fascist Party, which held all 60 of the seats in the country&#x27;s unicameral parliament from the election of 1923 until the end of the Second World War in 1945. The party was refounded in 1940 under the leadership of Ermenegildo Gasperoni (1906–1994).

=== Period of coalition government ===
The PCS was a governing party of San Marino in coalition with the Socialist Party of San Marino (PSSM) from 1945 until March 1957.

=== Crisis of 1957 ===

Following events in the Eastern Bloc in 1956, some of the socialist deputies abandoned the coalition. On September 18, 1957, the coalition lost its majority when a socialist deputy crossed over to the opposition, reducing the number of pro-coalition deputies to 29. The tenure of the assembly ended on October 1, 1957, placing the government in constitutional limbo. The Christian Democratic deputies refused to attend session; instead, they occupied a factory in Rovereta and set up a provisional government there. The Italian and U.S. government pledged support to the provisional government, whilst the communist-socialist coalition (with support of Italian communists) sought to resist the attempt to establish a provisional government.

=== Years of opposition ===
After the failed attempt at a coup in 1957, the PCS remained an opposition party in San Marino, excluded from the government coalition. The new non-communist government won reelection in September 1959, with the PCS&#x27;s parliamentary delegation falling to 16 members, joined by 8 Socialists.

The PCS remained a recognized independent member of the international communist movement, sending delegations to international conferences in 1957, 1959, and 1960 and to the 22nd Congress of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union in October 1961. With the split of the world communist movement into pro-Soviet and pro-Chinese factions during the 1960s, the PCS remained firmly pro-Soviet.

In national elections held on September 8, 1974, the PCS received 3,246 votes (23% of those cast) and won 16 seats to the Great and General Council — a gain of 1 seat from the previous election, held in 1969.

=== Return to government ===
In 1978 the PCS returned to government as part of a coalition with the Socialist Party and a new organization formed three years earlier, the Unitary Socialist Party (PSU). This made San Marino in 1978 the only country in Western Europe with a Communist Party as a participant in a governing coalition.

A scheduled election held on May 29, 1983 saw the PCs receiving 24.3% of the vote cast for the General Council (parliament), thereby electing 15 Communists to the body. These were joined by 9 Socialists, and 8 members of the SUP — a total of 32 of the 60 seats as part of a new Communist-Socialist unity government. This government remained in power until a 1986 corruption scandal shattered the Socialists, with the Communists remaining in government through an unlikely coalition with the center-right Sammarinese Christian Democratic Party (PDCS) until 1992.

At the national election held on May 29, 1988, the PCS garnered 28.7% of the votes cast, winning 18 of 60 seats on the General Council.

=== Structure ===
The PCS was governed by a 17-member Central Committee, elected at periodic party congresses. This body selected a 10-member Executive Committee from its ranks to handle daily party governance.

The General Secretary of the organization from its 1940 reformation until the early 1970s was Ermenegildo Gasperoni. In 1973, Gasperoni was moved into the more ceremonial role of party chairman, with Umberto Barulli (1921–1993) taking the helm as General Secretary. Barulli was replaced in turn as General Secretary by Gilberto Ghiotti in 1984, with Ghiotti remaining in power until the end of the party in 1990.

The PCS was the chief sponsor of two subsidiary organizations, the Federation of Communist Women of San Marino and the Communist Youth Federation of San Marino.

Party membership in 1965 was estimated at 960 out of a total national population of about 17,000. In 1976 total membership was estimated by another scholar at about 300 from a national population of 19,000.

The official organ of the PCS was the newspaper , a publication which was not produced on a regular chronological basis.

=== Restructuring ===
With the collapse of the Soviet Union in 1990, in parallel to the transformation of PCI into the Democratic Party of the Left (PDS) in Italy, the PCS formally renounced communism and remade itself as the Sammarinese Democratic Progressive Party (PPDS). This change was followed by a split of communist hard-liners who formed the Sammarinese Communist Refoundation (RCS).

With the renaming of the organization at the 12th Party Congress of April 1990, the name of the official organ was changed from to . The party&#x27;s former hammer-and-sickle logo was dropped at this time, replaced by a drawing of a dove by Pablo Picasso.

<text>Wacken is a municipality near the town of Itzehoe in Schleswig-Holstein, Germany. Wacken was first mentioned in 1148, but there were probably some settlements before, which is proven by the trove of Germanic artefacts.

Today, Wacken is famous for annually staging one of the world&#x27;s biggest open air heavy metal festival, &quot;Wacken Open Air&quot;, which has hosted popular metal acts such as Iron Maiden, Scorpions, Saxon, Alice Cooper, Deep Purple, Mötley Crüe, Slayer, Rammstein, Motörhead, Slipknot and Judas Priest, as well as local and perennial regulars, including Subway to Sally and Wacken&#x27;s Firefighters&#x27; band. Every citizen gets free entry to the festival.

<text>Hyacinthe Eléonore Klosé (11 October 1808 – 29 August 1880) was a French clarinet player, professor at the Conservatoire de Paris, and composer.

==Life and music==
Klosé was born in Corfu (Greece). He was second clarinet at the Théâtre Italien to Frédéric Berr beginning in 1836, then to Iwan Müller following Berr&#x27;s death in 1838, finally becoming solo clarinettist when Müller left in 1841.

In the Paris Conservatory, Klosé had many notable pupils including:
* K.I. Boutruy, who received First Prize in 1852.
* A. Grisez, who received First Prize in 1857.
* Augusta Holmès.
* Adolphe Marthe Leroy, who succeeded Klosé in his Paris professorship in 1868.
* Louis A. Mayeur, to whom he also taught the saxophone in the early 1850s.
* I.G. Paulus, who received the &quot;Légion d&#x27;Honneur&quot; in the same year as Klosé.
* Cyrille Rose, who received First Prize in 1847.
* Frédéric Selmer, who was so accomplished that a special &quot;Prize of Honour&quot; was created for him in his final year, 1852.
* Charles Paul Turban, who received Second Prize in 1864 and First Prize in 1865.

Klosé was also noted for his design improvements to the clarinet using the principles laid down by Theobald Boehm in his innovative work on the flute keywork. From 1839 to 1843, he enlisted the help of Louis-August Buffet of Buffet-Crampon fame, an instrument-making technician, to construct what is known today as the Boehm system clarinet.

He died in August 1880 at his home at 40 rue des Martyrs, Paris.

<doc id="843434" wikidata="Q18276" url="?curid=843434" title="Sarajevo Canton">
<text>The Sarajevo Canton, officially the Canton of Sarajevo (; ; ), is one of the ten cantons of the Federation of Bosnia and Herzegovina in Bosnia and Herzegovina. Its cantonal seat is the city of Sarajevo, also the capital city of Bosnia and Herzegovina.

The Canton represents the metro area of Sarajevo. It contains 97% of the city&#x27;s population, but a much smaller percentage of the official land area. The majority of the population is Bosniak (83.8%).

==History==

The history of Sarajevo dates back to Neolithic times, when the Butmir culture made its mountains and hills their home. In ancient times, the Sarajevo area (Canton) was occupied by the Illyrians. The local tribe, the Daesitates, controlled most of the area. They were a warlike bunch and the last Illyrian tribe to resist Roman rule, which finally came in AD 9. Under Roman rule, many roads were constructed in the region, as well as a city on top of modern-day Ilidža. During the Middle Ages, the area of Sarajevo Canton was a key part of the Bosnian Kingdom. The toponym Vrhbosna existed somewhere in the region and was one of the notable settlements at the time.

True development of the region came after the Ottoman conquest when local Muslim noble Isa-Beg Isaković established the roots of the modern city of Sarajevo, between 1461 and 1463. The region grew along with the city, which quickly, after Istanbul, became the most important in the Balkans. Later rule by Austria-Hungary modernized and westernized the region. Under Yugoslavia, there was major development of the area, which more than tripled in size. Because of its ideal geographical location in between mountains, Sarajevo was chosen to host the 1984 Winter Olympics. Much of this progress was offset however by the Yugoslav Wars in the early 1990s.

The Sarajevo Canton was a result of this warfare, created by the Washington Accords in 1994, and its boundaries defined by the Dayton Accords in 1995.

==Government==
Like all Cantons of the Federation of Bosnia and Herzegovina, the head of the Sarajevo Canton is called the Prime Minister. The current Prime Minister is Nihad Uk (since 24 March 2023). Like many other heads of executive branches of government in the world, the Prime Minister has a cabinet which helps him go about his duties. The Sarajevo Canton also has ministries, services, and agencies to help in the running of the region.

The Canton is split into 9 municipalities. They are all based on the major settlements in their region, except for Sarajevo, whose size and status as capital city gives it four separate municipalities and its own separate city government. Major cities are in municipalities of the same name in Bosnia and Herzegovina (i.e. Ilidža is part of Ilidža Municipality) whose governments are the de facto city government as their jurisdiction covers the city and all major suburbs.

**Agency for Cantonal Development
**Agency for Reserves of Goods

**Agency for the Planning of Cantonal Growth
**Professional Fire-Extinguishing Brigade

==Geography==
The Sarajevo Canton has a typical Bosnian geography. It is located close to the geometric center of the country, and contains numerous mountains, including Bjelašnica, Igman, Jahorina, Trebević, and Treskavica. The cities of the Canton are built predominantly on the hills at the foot of these mountains, and the fields in between them. The most significant of these is the Sarajevo field, a small depression upon which the bulk of the city is built upon. The Miljacka river passes through the Canton. Vrelo Bosne, the source of the Bosna River, is found in Sarajevo Canton and is the source of water for most residents of Sarajevo.

==Economy==
Sarajevo is economically strongest region in the whole of Bosnia and Herzegovina. The city and canton generate more than 37% of the Bosnian-Herzegovinian GDP.

The economy of Sarajevo Canton is slowly growing better, although it has been severely weakened by the Siege of Sarajevo and is still drastically weaker than it used to be during Yugoslav period. The employment rate in Bosnia and Herzegovina is 45.5% officially; however, grey economy may reduce actual unemployment to between 25 and 30%, while in Sarajevo the official unemployment rate is around 15% of the labour force.

Major industries in the region include tourism, food processing, manufacturing and IT. Several major Bosnian companies are based in the Canton such as Bosnalijek and Bosna Bank International. The area also holds the country footholds of numerous foreign corporations, such as Coca-Cola, Raiffeisen Bank International, Ziraat Bank, Al Jazeera, Volkswagen, among many others.

==Demographics==
The Sarajevo Canton contains Sarajevo and its metro area. Since the city is the largest in Bosnia and Herzegovina, it is also one of the most populous Cantons of Bosnia and Herzegovina. According to the 2013 population census, the overall population of Sarajevo Canton is 413.593. 84% of population are ethnic Bosniaks, 4,2% Croats, and 3,2% Serbs.

The population density of Sarajevo Canton is some 350 people per km2. 15.8% of the Canton&#x27;s population are youth up to 14 years of age, 67.8% are between 15 and 64 years of age, and some 16.4% are over 65 years of age.

Of the nine municipalities, the biggest population belongs to Novi Grad, with some 125.626 residents, and the smallest population was in Trnovo, which has a mere 2.850 residents.

<doc id="843436" wikidata="Q5161373" url="?curid=843436" title="Connect (British trade union)">
<text>Connect was a British trade union representing workers in the communications industry.

==History==
The union was founded in 1912 as the Society of Post Office Engineering Inspectors. In 1947, the Society of Chief Inspectors merged in, and it adopted the new name of the Society of Telecommunication Engineers. Another merger took place in 1969, when the Telecommunication Traffic Officers&#x27; Association joined, with the name changing to the Society of Post Office Engineers, and in 1975 the Telecommunications Sales Superintendents&#x27; Association merged in, and it became the Society of Post Office Executives (SPOE), by which point it had more than 20,000 members.

Around the turn of 1983, the union became the Society of Telecom Executives, then finally it became Connect in 2000.

Connect&#x27;s final president was Denise McGuire, while its final general secretary was Adrian Askew. In 2010, Connect merged into Prospect, the union for managers and engineers.

== Overview ==

Certain employers formally recognised Connect, for example, companies like BT Group, O2 plc, Yell Group, Guernsey Telecoms, HP, Vodafone UK and Kingston Communications. In these companies Connect negotiates on members&#x27; behalf.

In companies where there is growing membership but no formal recognition as yet, such as T-Mobile or Energis, employees still can access union services.

== Disputes ==

Connect Members in BT undertook industrial action in 2008.

<doc id="843437" wikidata="Q1955166" url="?curid=843437" title="Westinghouse Works, 1904">
<text>Westinghouse Works, 1904 is a collection of American short silent films, each averaging about three minutes in length. The films were taken from April 18, 1904, to May 16, 1904, in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, and document various Westinghouse manufacturing plants. They were made by G. W. &quot;Billy&quot; Bitzer of the American Mutoscope and Biograph Company, were shown at the Westinghouse Auditorium at the 1904 St. Louis World&#x27;s Fair, and may have been made for that purpose. At least 29 films were produced and 21 remain in the collection which is now a part of the National Film Registry of the Library of Congress.

== Collection ==
The films in the collection of the Library of Congress are:

#&quot;Assembling a generator&quot;, Westinghouse works
#&quot;Assembling and testing turbines&quot;, Westinghouse works
#&quot;Casting a guide box&quot;, Westinghouse works
#&quot;Coil winding machines&quot;, Westinghouse works
#&quot;Coil winding section E&quot;, Westinghouse works
#&quot;Girls taking time checks&quot;, Westinghouse works
#&quot;Girls winding armatures&quot;
#&quot;Panorama exterior&quot; Westinghouse works

#&quot;Panorama view street car motor room&quot;
#&quot;Panoramic view aisle B&quot;, Westinghouse works
#&quot;Steam hammer&quot;, Westinghouse works
#&quot;Steam whistle&quot;, Westinghouse works
#&quot;Taping coils&quot;, Westinghouse works
#&quot;Tapping a furnace&quot;, Westinghouse works
#&quot;Testing a rotary&quot;, Westinghouse works

#&quot;Westinghouse Air Brake Co&quot;. Westinghouse Co. works (casting scene)
#&quot;Westinghouse Air Brake Co&quot;. Westinghouse Co. works (moulding scene)
#&quot;Westinghouse Air Brake Co&quot;. Westinghouse works

== Production ==
Westinghouse executives commissioned Biograph to produce these films, intending to exhibit them to their subsidiaries and employees, thus making them some of the earliest existing examples of what are now called industrial films. They cannot be called documentaries because they were paid for and made according to guidelines set by the manufacturing company. In addition, they cannot be called commercials because they do not advertise individual products and were not exhibited widely to elicit sales.

The films were the first to use mercury vapor lamps (conveniently made by Westinghouse) to illuminate its shots, and they were also the first to use crane shots. Bitzer primarily used stationary cameras and fixed lenses, and he typically shot the films in a single continuous take.

Most films did not have title cards, so many of their names were assigned by the Library of Congress.

== Release ==
The finished films were shown to Westinghouse employees in Pittsburgh, narrated by a speaker. They were later exhibited at the Louisiana Purchase Exposition in St. Louis (accompanied by organ music), and were received positively by audiences.

<text>Public holidays in Malaysia are regulated at both federal and state levels, mainly based on a list of federal holidays observed nationwide plus a few additional holidays observed by each individual state and federal territory. The public holidays are a mix of secular holidays celebrating the nation and its history, and selected traditional holidays of the various ethnic and religious groups that make up the country.

The legislation governing public holidays in Malaysia includes the Holidays Act 1951 (Act 369) in Peninsular Malaysia and Labuan, the Holidays Ordinance (Sabah Cap. 56) in Sabah and the Public Holidays Ordinance (Sarawak Cap. 8) in Sarawak.

The workweek and weekend varies between states, with most states and federal territories observing a Saturday–Sunday weekend, while Kedah, Kelantan and Terengganu observe a Friday–Saturday weekend, though in Johor many private businesses and banks observe the Saturday–Sunday weekend due to close business ties with Singapore. In states and territories with a Saturday–Sunday weekend, a public holiday that falls on Sunday is substituted by a holiday on Monday, or the next working day if Monday itself is a public holiday. In Johor and Kedah, a public holiday that falls on Friday is replaced by Sunday or the next working day, while in Kelantan and Terengganu, a public holiday that falls on Saturday is replaced by Sunday or the next working day.

Starting 1 January 2025, the weekend holiday for Johor changed from Friday-Saturday to Saturday-Sunday, after ten years of enforcement since 2014.

==Overview==
===Federal holidays===
Federal public holidays are fixed by the federal government and are observed nationwide with some exceptions. They are:
*Muhammad&#x27;s Birthday (Maulidur Rasul)
*Hari Merdeka (Independence Day)
*Chinese New Year 
*Wesak Day
*The Yang di-Pertuan Agong&#x27;s Birthday (King&#x27;s Birthday)
*Hari Raya Puasa (Aidilfitri) 
*Hari Raya Qurban (Aidiladha) 
*Deepavali 
*Christmas
*Labour Day
*Awal Muharram
*Malaysia Day

Each state and federal territory observes 14 days of federal holidays, except Sarawak which observes 13 days.

Although the second day of Chinese New Year is not listed as a federal holiday in Kelantan and Terengganu, the holiday is gazetted as a state holiday in both states, effectively making it a nationwide holiday. Additionally, the second day of Hari Raya Qurban is gazetted as a state holiday in Kedah and Perlis.

===State holidays===
In addition to the federal public holidays, each state may gazette a number of state public holidays to be observed in the state. For the federal territories, the Prime Minister is in charge of designating the territorial public holidays to be observed in each federal territory.

In every state, the official birthday of the state ruler or governor is celebrated as a public holiday. In the federal territories, the Federal Territory Day is celebrated instead.

The most widespread state holiday is New Year&#x27;s Day which is observed in eight states and all three federal territories, followed by Nuzul al-Quran in seven states and all three federal territories, and Thaipusam in five states and two federal territories.

As of 2020, each state and federal territory has designated four to six state public holidays, bringing the total number of (federal and state) public holidays to 20 days in Sabah and Terengganu, 19 days in Labuan, Penang and Sarawak and 18 days in the rest of the country.

===Holidays by declaration===
Section 8 of the Holidays Act 1951 gives the Prime Minister power to declare any day a public holiday in the whole of Peninsular Malaysia and Labuan, or in one of the federal territories, or in one of the states after consultation with the relevant state government. The declared holiday must be observed by all employers as a paid holiday.

Public holidays had been declared on the polling day for a general election, on the day of the installation of the Yang di-Pertuan Agong, as well as after international sporting events to celebrate the achievements of Malaysian athletes.

At the state level, the state government may declare an occasional holiday (&quot;cuti peristiwa&quot;) for events such as the installation of the state ruler, after major achievements in sporting events, or even to provide an extra holiday but unable to officially gazette it (such as the annual holiday declaration for Thaipusam in Kedah). Unlike holidays declared under Section 8 of the Holidays Act 1951, observance of occasional state holidays by private businesses and organizations is voluntary, while government offices and schools (except for nationwide exams) are closed.

In Sabah and Sarawak, the power to declare any day as a public holiday rests with the state governor (in practice, exercised on the advice of the state government) in accordance with the states&#x27; respective Holidays Ordinances.

====List of public holidays by declaration under Section 8 of the Holidays Act 1951====
The table below lists additional holidays that were declared under Section 8 of the Holidays Act 1951 for Peninsular Malaysia and Labuan. Unless otherwise noted, the same days were also declared as holidays by Sabah and Sarawak in accordance to their respective Holidays Ordinances.

===Public holidays falling on the same day===
For government institutions, there is no automatic replacement holiday when two public holidays fall on the same working day, although the government may designate another day as a public holiday. For private sector employees, if the employer chooses to observe both public holidays, a replacement holiday is given on the next working day, or another day if the employees agree.

==Entitlement in employment law==
In Peninsular Malaysia and Labuan, employees whose employment is covered by the Employment Act 1955 are entitled to 11 paid public holidays a year. Five of the holidays are fixed by law: National Day, Yang di-Pertuan Agong&#x27;s Birthday, birthday of the ruler or governor of the state (Federal Territory Day in the federal territories) where the employee is contracted to work, Labour Day and Malaysia Day. The remaining six paid holidays are chosen by the employer from the gazetted public holidays, with notice provided to employees before the start of each calendar year. In addition, any public holiday declared under Section 8 of the Holidays Act 1951 is to be observed as a paid holiday.

Should an employee be required to work on a paid holiday, the employee may be given another day off, or compensated at two times their ordinary wages in addition to holiday pay. Overtime work done on a paid holiday is to be compensated at three times the hourly rate of pay (or three times the ordinary rate per piece for piece-rated employees).

Employment in Sabah and Sarawak is regulated by the Labour Ordinance of the respective states. Employees in Sabah are entitled to 14 paid public holidays a year while those in Sarawak are entitled to 16 days, with four fixed holidays on National Day, Yang di-Pertuan Agong&#x27;s Birthday, the State Governor&#x27;s Birthday and Labour Day. The provisions on compensation for work done on paid holidays are identical to the Employment Act 1955.

== Table of public holidays ==
All holidays are state/territorial public holidays unless otherwise indicated.

==Types of holidays==
Malaysia has one of the highest numbers of public holidays in the world, ranking number seven in the top ten countries after Thailand, Indonesia, India and Macau. Some holidays are federally gazetted public holidays and some are public holidays observed by individual states. Other festivals are observed by particular ethnic or religion groups, but are not public holidays. The main holy days of each major religion are public holidays, taking place on either the western calendar or religious ones.

===Secular===
The most widespread holiday is the &quot;Hari Kebangsaan&quot; (National Day), otherwise known as &quot;Hari Merdeka&quot; (Independence Day) on 31 August commemorating the independence of the Federation of Malaya. This, as well as Labour Day (1 May), the King&#x27;s birthday (First Monday of June) and some other festivals are major national public holidays. Federal Territory day is celebrated in the three Federal territories. Malaysia Day, held on 16 September to commemorate the formation of Malaysia, became a nationwide holiday in 2010. Before that it was celebrated only in Sabah, Sarawak and Labuan. New Year&#x27;s Day is also observed as a public holiday in all Malaysian states, except for Johor, Kedah, Kelantan, Perlis, and Terengganu.

===Religious and ethnic===
Muslim holidays are highly prominent in Malaysia. The most important of these is Hari Raya Puasa (also called &quot;Hari Raya Aidilfitri&quot;) which is the Malay translation of Eid al-Fitr. It is generally a festival honoured by the Muslims worldwide marking the end of Ramadan will the fasting month. In addition to Hari Raya Puasa, they also celebrate Hari Raya Aidiladha (also called &quot;Hari Raya Haji&quot; referring to its occurrence after the culmination of the annual Hajj or &quot;Hari Raya Qurban&quot;), Awal Muharram (Islamic New Year) and Maulidur Rasul (Birthday of Muhammad).

Malaysian Chinese typically hold the same festivals observed by Chinese around the world. Chinese New Year is the most prominent, lasting for 15-days and ending with &quot;Chap Goh Mei&quot; (十五暝). Other festivals celebrated by Chinese are the Qingming Festival, the Dragon Boat Festival and the Mid-Autumn Festival.

Malaysian Indians of the Hindu faith celebrate Deepavali, the festival of light, while Thaipusam is a celebration in which Hindu pilgrims from all over the country meet at the Batu Caves. 
The most important Sikh festival is the Sikh new year or Vaisakhi festival. Other important days are Lodi and Gurpurab. 
Other Indian and Indochinese communities observe their new year celebrations at around the same time, such as Pohela Boishakh of the Bengalis and Songkran (water festival) of the Thais. People in the northern states do celebrate the Thai festival of Loy Kratong.

Wesak (Malay for Vesak), the Buddhist festival commemorating Buddha&#x27;s birth, is a public holiday. Malaysia&#x27;s Christian community observes most of the holidays observed by Christians elsewhere, most notably Christmas and Easter. Good Friday, however, is only a public holiday in the two Bornean states. The harvest festivals of Gawai in Sarawak and Kaamatan in Sabah are also important for East Malaysians.

New Year&#x27;s Day, Chinese New Year, and the start of the Islamic calendar are all public holidays.

==Participation==
Despite most of the festivals being identified with a particular ethnic or religious group, festivities are often participated in by all Malaysians. One example of this is the celebration of &quot;Kongsi Raya&quot; which is used when Hari Raya Puasa and Chinese New Year coincide. The term &quot;Kongsi Raya&quot; (which means &quot;sharing the celebration&quot; in Malay) was coined because of the similarity between the word &quot;kongsi&quot; and the Chinese New Year greeting of &quot;Gong xi fa cai&quot;. Similarly, the portmanteau &quot;Deepa Raya&quot; was coined when Hari Raya Puasa and Deepavali coincided.

A practice known as &quot;open house&quot; (&quot;rumah terbuka&quot;) is common during the festivities, especially during Hari Raya Aidilfitri, Deepavali, Chinese New Year and Christmas. Open house means that all well-wishers are received and that everyone regardless of background is invited to attend. Open houses are normally held at the home of the host and food are also prepared by the host, however, there are also open houses held at larger public venues especially when hosted by government agencies or corporations. Also during the festivities, most Malaysians would take the time off work or school to return to their hometowns to celebrate the festivities with their extended relatives. This practice is commonly known as &quot;balik kampung&quot; and usually causes traffic jams on most highways in the country.

<doc id="843449" wikidata="Q7100140" url="?curid=843449" title="Orc (Blake)">
<text>Orc is a proper name for one of the characters in the complex mythology of William Blake. A fallen figure, Orc is the embodiment of rebellion, and stands opposed to Urizen, the embodiment of tradition.

In Blake&#x27;s illuminated book &quot;America a Prophecy&quot;, Orc is described by his mythic opponent, &quot;Albion&#x27;s Angel&quot; as the &quot;Lover of Wild Rebellion, and transgressor of God&#x27;s Law&quot;. He symbolizes the spirit of rebellion and freedom, which provoked the French Revolution.

==Background==
The name Orc is possibly an anagram of the word &quot;cor&quot; (heart), in that he was stated in Blake&#x27;s myth to be born of Enitharmon&#x27;s heart, or &quot;orca&quot; (whale) because he sometimes takes the form of a whale. Orcus is also the Latin word for Hell, and Orc is presented as a rebellious, Luciferian character. He was created to serve as Blake&#x27;s analysis of the revolutions in the United States and France.

==Character==

In Blake&#x27;s myth, Orc is seen as the first child of Los with Enitharmon and sometimes either replaced in that position by another or not mentioned as a child at all. In the &quot;Four Zoas&quot;, the children of Los represent a just form of wrath, pity, frustrated desire and logic, which serve as an analysis of Orc&#x27;s being. Orc&#x27;s creation was based on the split between Los and Enitharmon, and he transformed from a worm into the form of a serpent. Based on Orc&#x27;s relationship with Enitharmon, there is a split between him and Los. Los uses the Chains of Jealousy to bind Orc upon a mountain, and Orc becomes part of the rock. While bound, his imagination is able to exist in a cave located in Urizen&#x27;s kingdom, which wakes up Urizen. When Urizen seeks out Orc, Orc is freed as he changes into a serpent. The form is corrupted and he is turned into a satanic image. Orc spends his time rebelling against Urizen, and it is only when Urizen stops fighting Orc that Orc is able to become Luvah.

Orc is a force of revolution, revival, and of passion who is the polar opposite to Urizen, the cruel and tyrannous god. Orc is the force of new life in the cycle and Urizen represents the older version of Orc that dies at the end of the cycle. As such, Orc and Urizen appear in their evolution from one to the other in the &quot;Seven Eyes of God&quot;, or the seven historical cycles of Blake&#x27;s myth. Each cycle is divided into three phases, which begins with Orc&#x27;s birth and then describes Orc&#x27;s binding, which is connected to the time in a human&#x27;s life where they are at their imaginative greatness. This is followed by the creation of abstract religion and a view of the universe as mechanical. This is then followed by rationalism, which led to Aristotle, Bacon, Locke and other empirical-based scientists. The second phase is where Urizen takes over the fallen world, which is represented by the Enlightenment in the seventh cycle. This leads to materialism, the death of the soul, and warfare. This phase ends with prophets declaring that Orc will appear. The third phase describes Orc&#x27;s crucifixion and a return of human life to nature.

The character Orc is connected to the Biblical serpent, the image of being hanged on a dead tree, and to the sun. Of the latter, Orc&#x27;s hair is like the sun and connects Orc to other stories, including that of Samson or of the death of the god Balder. Likewise, the tree image is similar to Odin&#x27;s being speared and hanged upon a gallows-tree as a sacrifice. Since Odin is a hanged god and a tyrant, the image further connects the image of Orc with that of Urizen. Another image connected to Orc is that of the spear, a phallic symbol connected to the imagination. Orc uses the spear to attack Urizen, and the image also connects Orc to both Jesus and Odin as sacrifices to themselves. Like Jesus, Orc is also born around the winter solstice, a time when the sun is unable to warm the cold earth.

Orc is also connected to the inner workings of the human self. After Blake renounced the Orc men, the revolutionary leaders who he thought were like Orc, he distrusted all hero worship. Likewise, Blake believed that the imagination, represented by Orc, was purely mental and could not have the same form as a physical thing. Instead, it was part of the divine energy in man. As such, Orc is an internal life cycle that ends with a rebirth of the self. In general, Orc represented the freedom of the self in a Promethean manner, which connects Orc to Milton&#x27;s version of Satan. In Blake&#x27;s version, the true Satan was God, who created the physical reality, and the Satan/Orc figure represents the human desire which is transformed into accepting of law and reason. As such, Blake dismisses Milton&#x27;s epic as lacking a hero and keeps Orc from being seen as a heroic figure.

==Appearances==

In &quot;America a Prophecy&quot; (1793), Orc is described as a threat to the British colonies in America and to society. The angel of Albion sees Orc as an antichrist figure, and Orc views the prince of Albion as a dragon. During the work, Orc has an apocalyptic vision where the empire is destroyed and the oppressors of the world are stopped. Following the vision, Orc is able to get the Americans to rise up in revolution and they begin to attack their oppressors through a mental revolution. In &quot;Europe a Prophecy&quot; (1794), Orc is connected to the revolution in France but it is Los who calls the people to revolution. In &quot;The Song of Los&quot;, Orc provokes thought within the second half, &quot;Asia&quot;, which unsettles the kings of earth, and Orc is described as raging across Europe. In these continental works, Los and Orc are seen as describing an apocalypse that would result in freedom.

In &quot;The Book of Urizen&quot;, the African civilization ends along with the third cycle, describing Adam and Eve, ending. Orc, symbolized as the serpent in the Garden of Eden, is cursed. This is followed in &quot;The Book of Ahania&quot; of a new cycle beginning in Asia, which parallels Exodus. Within the Israelite civilization, an Orc and an Urizen figure battles against each other with Orc representing a pillar of fire that guides the Israelites during the night while Urizen is a pillar of cloud that seeks to mislead them. Urizen is able to win over the Israelites by giving them the ten commandments and moral laws. These commandments are attacked by Orc in &quot;America a Prophecy&quot;.

Later in &quot;Vala&quot;, Orc describes the divided aspects of the soul, which, in Blake&#x27;s mythological system, God has a twofold essence that is capable of good and evil. This idea parallels Blake&#x27;s personal belief that there was a division within himself. In this later work, Orc is born during the winter solstice and Urizen begins to search for him. Urizen, during this time, becomes witness to the life cycles of which Orc is a part. When Urizen finally reaches Orc, the view of the Orc cycle is described in a deistic manner, a perspective which is arguably the opposite of Blake&#x27;s own theological convictions. Urizen, believing that Orc is connected to chaos, seeks predictability and order. He seeks to do so by creating laws which enslave humankind. Urizen crucifies Orc, in the form of a serpent, and war spreads over the land.

In &quot;The Four Zoas&quot; this is overridden: there the parents produce the four sons Rintrah, Palamabron, Bromion and Theotormon. This is a double-dialectical analysis, rather than an inconsistency as such.

On the other hand Orc is connected to Luvah in &quot;The Four Zoas&quot; VIII.

==In fiction==
In his World of Tiers series, Philip Jose Farmer included numerous characters with Blakian names; two are &quot;Blind Orc&quot; and &quot;Red Orc&quot;. They are not Tolkien orcs, but are human-like &quot;Lords&quot; who create artificial worlds. Red Orc is the &quot;secret Lord of Earth&quot;.

In Ridley Scott&#x27;s &quot;Blade Runner&quot; (1982), one of the lines by Roy Batty is a misquote of Blake&#x27;s poem:
&quot;Fiery the angels fell; deep thunder rolled around their shores; burning with the fires of Orc&quot;.
This line was suggested by Rutger Hauer, adapted from Blake&#x27;s &quot;.&quot;
&quot;Fiery the angels rose, and as they rose deep thunder roll&#x27;d. Around their shores: indignant burning with the fires of Orc.&quot;

<text>In Mexico, there are three major kinds of public holidays:

* Statutory holiday: holidays observed all around Mexico. Employees are entitled to a day off with regular pay and schools (public and private) are closed for the day of the holiday.
* Civic holiday: These holidays are observed nationwide, but employees are not entitled to the day off with pay, and schools (public and private) still continue.
* Festivities: These are traditional holidays to honor religious events, such as Carnival, Holy Week, Easter, etc. or public celebrations, such as Mother&#x27;s Day, Father&#x27;s Day, Valentine&#x27;s Day, etc.

&quot;Dia de la Independencia&quot; or &quot;Anniversario de la Independencia&quot;, September 16, commemorates Mexico&#x27;s independence from Spain and is the most important patriotic statutory holiday. Parades are held and many schools are closed.

==Statutory holidays==
Statutory holidays (referred as &quot;&quot;feriados&quot; or &quot;días de asueto&quot;&quot; in Mexico) are legislated through the federal government and ruled by the Federal Labor Law (&quot;Ley Federal del Trabajo&quot;). Most workers, public and private, are entitled to take the day off with regular pay. However, some employers may require employees to work on such a holiday, but the employee must be paid:

* the regular pay for the statutory holiday if no work is performed by the employee, and
* the regular pay and two additional daily salary rates if work is performed by the employee, for a total of triple the usual rate.

When a statutory holiday falls on a Sunday, Monday is considered a statutory holiday; if a statutory holiday falls on Saturday, Friday will be considered a statutory holiday.

In addition to these dates, election days designated by federal and local electoral laws are also statutory holidays.

<doc id="843456" wikidata="Q939429" url="?curid=843456" title="Cybotron (American band)">
<text>Cybotron is an American electro music group formed in 1980 by Juan Atkins and Richard &quot;3070&quot; Davis in Detroit. Cybotron had a number of singles now considered classics and style-defining works of the electro genre, particularly &quot;Clear&quot; and the group&#x27;s debut, &quot;Alleys of Your Mind&quot;, as well as &quot;Cosmic Cars&quot; and &quot;R-9&quot;. &quot;Techno City&quot; is also considered an early Detroit techno track.

==Influences==
The group was inspired by midwestern funk, especially the music of electro funk pioneer George Clinton, along with German synthesizer band Kraftwerk, Japanese technopop pioneers Yellow Magic Orchestra, American electro music, English synthpop, Italo disco, and futurist literary influences such as Alvin Toffler&#x27;s books &quot;Future Shock&quot; and &quot;The Third Wave&quot;. The name &quot;Cybotron&quot; is a portmanteau of cyborg and cyclotron.

==Career==
Formed in 1980, Cybotron released their first singles, &quot;Alleys of Your Mind&quot; and &quot;Cosmic Cars&quot;, as 7-inch records on Atkins&#x27;s own label, &quot;Deep Space Records&quot;. In total, these records sold 15,000 copies. In 1983, the group was signed to the Berkeley, California-based Fantasy label and released its debut album, &quot;Enter&quot;.

In 1985, Atkins left the group due to artistic differences with Davis. Davis wanted the group to pursue a musical direction closer to rock, while Atkins wanted to continue in the electro-style vein of &quot;Clear&quot;. After the breakup, Davis carried on and released several records as Cybotron, the last in 1995. Atkins still has an active musical career. He founded Metroplex Records and continued releasing records under several names, including Model 500, Model 600 and Infiniti. Atkins also continued DJing under his own name.

In 2019, Cybotron reshaped. In place of the members Richard Davis and John Housely, Juan Atkins was joined by Laurens von Oswald, and by fellow Detroiter Tameko Williams aka DJ Maaco. The group performed their first gig ever at London&#x27;s Barbican Hall.

Virgil Abloh reassembled Cybotron in 2020, to soundtrack Louis Vuitton Men&#x27;s Fall-Winter Runway show with a medley of classics from the group.

==Relation to techno==
Although generally considered electro, Cybotron was also part of the early evolution of techno music. Cybotron was the first musical outlet of techno co-originator Juan Atkins, and the group&#x27;s unique combination of musical influences, boldly experimental aesthetic and Afro-futurist philosophy became the underpinnings of Detroit techno.

Cybotron used a synth-dominated sound, paired with a drum machine, whose rhythms were similar to those emerging from New York at the same time. This was reflected in their first single, &quot;Alleys of Your Mind&quot;, which was released on their own Deep Space label and was playlisted by The Electrifyin’ Mojo in 1981. It became a local hit in Detroit, where it sold about 15,000 copies. Their next two singles, &quot;Cosmic Cars&quot; and &quot;Clear&quot; had even more success, which led to them being signed by Fantasy, a label located in Berkeley, California.

Cybotron intended for their music to reflect the atmosphere of economic desperation and alienation in Detroit in the 1980s. Songs like &quot;Alleys of Your Mind&quot; and &quot;Techno City&quot; were specifically aimed to mirror the city, using technology to capture this spirit. Cybotron used subliminal funk amidst their programmed beats to reflect the dying auto industry in Detroit.

<text>The Poddington Peas is a British animated television series that was created by Paul Needs and Colin Wyatt of Cairnvale Productions for Poddington PLC; it has thirteen five-minute episodes, and was aired on BBC One as part of the Children&#x27;s BBC strand (as it had been known from its inception on 9 September 1985 until 4 October 1997) from 14 September to 22 December 1989. The series was regularly repeated throughout the 90s and early 00s until 2002. The series&#x27; theme song, composed by Geoff Stephens, describes the eponymous group of Peas living &quot;down at the bottom of the garden&quot;. Human-sized garden objects, enormous in size to the Peas, are often seen, such as upturned flowerpots which serve as most of their buildings. Humans themselves are never seen or mentioned (with the single exception of Christmas gift-giver Santa Claus, who left his gifts at Creepy Castle in the last episode). All thirteen episodes were released on VHS by Palace Video in 1990 (HPV0018), but this is now out of print. As with the majority of other older BBC children&#x27;s series, it has also never made it to DVD.

In 1992, writer Phil Gardner was employed by Poddington PLC to help them write a prospective second series of episodes, which were to include one with the intention of piloting the series in the United States, and feature a new group of characters known as the &quot;Bugz&quot; as well as the mischievous but well-intentioned &quot;Podd Twins&quot;. However, these episodes were never published.

There was also a book series by Paul Needs, illustrated by Colin Wyatt and published by Boxtree and Award Publications. The books, including new titles, were later released with a new associated press, and merchandise complementing these titles was released in 2013. Later in 2013, a new Adobe Flash remake of the series was announced on Needs&#x27; website. With the new pilot originally offered to CBBC, then produced independently after it was turned down, a 90-second promotional clip appeared on Needs&#x27; site. However, the project was eventually abandoned due to copyright issues – whilst Needs and Wyatt were the creators, the BBC still owned the rights to the series and character names (even though it was last repeated in 2002), which would have proven too costly to secure for the independent project.

==Characters==

The series features a group of thirty-four anthropomorphic peas, and most of their names not only refer to their jobs and main s (similar to &quot;The Smurfs&quot;), but are also plays on words (typically &quot;pea&quot; sounding like &quot;-py&quot;, such as &quot;Bump-Pea&quot; sounding like &quot;bumpy&quot;, &quot;Chip-Pea&quot; sounding like &quot;chippy&quot; and &quot;Creep-Pea&quot; sounding like &quot;creepy&quot;).

*Black-Eyed Pea (male): A mischievous pea with a protruding tooth who wears a black eye patch over his right eye, is a darker shade of green than most of the others, and is usually seen with Creep-Pea; together the pair of them are often the villains of the series, and live in Creepy Castle, which overlooks Poddington and has its own patch of &quot;Creepy Carrots&quot; (who are named for having sinister eyes).
*Bump-Pea (male): A clumsy pea with a somewhat paranoid expression who is covered in bumps and has a big plaster on his left cheek.
*Captain Hop-Pea (male): A nautical captain (which explains his title) pea who has a moustache, a beard and a wooden left leg, wears a blue-and-white captain&#x27;s hat, carries a non-astronomical telescope and sometimes appears to be in charge of the others. In later books his name is sometimes, inconstantly, rendered as &quot;Cap&#x27;n Hop-Pea&quot;. In later books he is often accompanied by a cabin boy-like sidekick named &quot;Rope-Pea&quot;, who is responsible for the cleanliness of his ship, and who wears a striped red and blue pirate&#x27;s t-shirt. 
*Chip-Pea (female): A &quot;&quot; (or fish-and-chip shop, to give them their formal name) worker pea with ginger hair, who wears a white three-cornered hat, a blue bow tie and a white apron, and is often seen carrying a blue chip scoop
*Chop-Pea (male): A lumberjack pea who wears a stereotypical brown lumberjack&#x27;s hat with flaps on its sides and carries an axe.
*Creep-Pea (male): A creepy-looking mischievous pea with two tufts of hair made to look like the Devil&#x27;s horns, a long pointed nose and pointed teeth, who is again a darker shade of green than most of the others, and usually seen with his fellow villain Black-Eyed Pea.
*Dough-Pea (male): A somewhat bewildered-looking simple-minded chef pea who wears a big white chef&#x27;s hat and carries a rolling pin.
*Dump-Pea (male): A fat, greedy, dumpy pea who is bigger and heavier than all of the others, and always eating (usually jam tarts).
*Garden Pea (male): A pea who likes gardening, has thin black hair and a thin black moustache, wears a straw hat and holds a spade. Books show him to also be a keen historian, who has traced the Poddington Peas&#x27; family roots.
*G-Pea (male): A general practitioner (and doctor) pea with white hair, glasses and a stethoscope, who carries a briefcase.
*Glop-Pea (male): An unkempt, unhygienic, and rather mysterious pea, hinted to be created by a scientist. Only seen in later books.
*Grump-Pea (male): A very grumpy-looking pea who likes to complain whenever the others require him to do something for an occasion.
*Hap-Pea (male): A happy, good-natured pea who wears a red baseball cap, and often appears to be the main character for the series.
*Hip-Pea (male): A musical hippy 1960s-era pea with long blond hair and a moustache, who wears a headband and carries a guitar. Later books show several other unnamed hippy peas in his company. 
*Jump-Pea (male): A pea who has a single springlike hair and legs, and makes use of the latter for jumping higher than the others.
*Nap-Pea (male): The youngest pea, he is Penela-Pea&#x27;s baby, who wears a white nappy, sits in a pushchair and carries a teddy bear.
*P.C. Pod (male): A policeman pea with a black moustache, who wears a blue helmet. His name is a pun on &quot;P.C. Plod&quot; from &quot;Noddy&quot;.
*Penela-Pea (female): A motherly pea who pushes her baby, Nap-Pea, around in a pushchair. Her name is a pun on the name &quot;Penelope&quot;.
*Pop-Pea (male): A grandfatherly pea with white hair (even though he is mostly bald) who wears glasses and carries a walking stick.
*Princess Pea (female): Appearing in only one later book, she is a princess who inhabits a small, majestic castle located on a rise above the garden, who has lost her priceless golden pea. Her name is a play on the story of &quot;The Princess and the Pea&quot;, and the missing pea is indeed found under her mattress. 
*Pup-Pea (dog): A small pea dog who helps keep the peace in Poddington, as P.C. Pod adopted him and trained him to be a police dog.
*Scoop-Pea (male): The editor for the &quot;Daily Pod&quot; (Poddington&#x27;s daily newspaper), who wears glasses and a green eyeshade visor.
*Scrap-Pea (male): A scruffy tool and scrap worker pea with thin black hair and stubble, who wears a blue hat and carries a hammer.
*Scrum-Pea (male): A fairly elderly farmer pea, with thick white moustache and whiskers, and red checked shirt and dungarees. Talks in a West Country accent and often comments on things in old sounding, folklore sounding sayings.
*Skip-Pea (female): A young pea with blonde pigtails, who has two red bows on her head and always skips by using her skipping rope.
*Sleep-Pea (male): A dozy pea who wears a nightcap and sleeps too much, so always misses occasions that all the others turn up for.

<doc id="843459" wikidata="Q140044" url="?curid=843459" title="Public holidays in China">
<text>There are currently seven official public holidays on Mainland China. Each year&#x27;s holidays are announced about one month before the start of the year by the General Office of the State Council. A notable feature of mainland Chinese holidays is that weekends are usually swapped with the weekdays next to the actual holiday to create a longer holiday period.

==History==
Festivals in China have been around since the Qin dynasty around 221–206 BC. During the more prosperous Tang dynasty from AD 618–907, festivals involved less sacrifice and mystery to more entertainment. Culminating to the modern era Between the 1920s until around the 1970s, the Chinese began observing two sets of holidays, which were the traditional and what became &quot;official&quot;, celebrating the accomplishments of the communist regime. There was then a major reform in 2008, abolishing the Labour Day Golden Week and adding three traditional Chinese holidays (Qingming Festival, Duanwu Festival, and Mid-Autumn Festival). From at least 2000 until this reform, the Spring Festival public holiday began on New Year&#x27;s Day itself. From 2008 to 2013 it was shifted back by one day to begin on Chinese New Year&#x27;s Eve. In 2014, New Year&#x27;s Eve became a working day again, which provoked hostile discussion by netizens and academics. However, since 2015, Chinese New Year&#x27;s Eve is usually swapped with nearby weekends so that people need not work on Chinese New Year&#x27;s Eve.

==Overview==
Holidays in China are complicated and are one of the least predictable among developing nations. 
In all these holidays, if the holiday lands on a weekend, the days will be reimbursed after the weekend.

The Chinese New Year and National Day holidays are three days long. The week-long holidays on May (Labor) Day and National Day began in 2000, as a measure to increase and encourage holiday spending. The resulting seven-day or eight-day (if Mid-Autumn Festival is near National Day) holidays are called &quot;Golden Weeks&quot; (), and have become peak seasons for travel and tourism. In 2008, the Labor Day holiday was shortened to three days to reduce travel rushes to just twice a year, and instead, three traditional Chinese holidays were added.

Generally, if there is a three-day or four-day (if Mid-Autumn Festival is near National Day) holiday, the government will declare it to be a seven-day or eight-day holiday. However, citizens are required to work during a nearby weekend. Businesses and schools would then treat the affected Saturdays and Sundays as the weekdays that the weekend has been swapped with. Schedules are released late in the year prior and might change during the year.

The following is a graphical schematic of how the weekend shifting works.
===Weekend shifting scheme (since 2014)===
====Spring Festival====
Shift the Saturdays and Sundays nearby to make a 7-day holiday. People may need to work for 6 or 7 continuous days before or after the holiday.

====National Day (not near Mid-Autumn Festival)====
Shift the Saturdays and Sundays nearby to make a 7-day holiday. The holiday is from 1 to 7 October. People may need to work for 6 or 7 continuous days before or after the holiday.

====New Year, Tomb-Sweeping Day, Labor Day (before 2020), Dragon Boat Festival and Mid-Autumn Festival (not near National Day)====
*Wednesday: No weekend shifting. The holiday is only 1 day long. This is to prevent people from working for 7 continuous days since 2014. Sometimes shift the Sundays nearby to make a 4-day holiday. People may need to work for 6 continuous days after the holiday.
*Tuesday or Thursday: Shift the Saturdays and Sundays nearby to make a 3-day holiday. People may need to work for 6 continuous days before or after the holiday.
*Saturday or Sunday: The public holiday is transferred to Monday.

====Labor Day (since 2020)====
Shift the Saturdays or Sundays nearby to make a 5-day holiday. People may need to work for 6 consecutive days before or after the holiday.

==Additional holidays for specific social groups==
In addition to these holidays, applicable to the whole population, there are four official public holidays applicable to specific sections of the population:

The closeness of Labor Day and Youth Day resulted in an unexpectedly long break for schools in 2008 - the Youth Day half-holiday entitlement had been largely forgotten because it has been subsumed into the Golden Week.

==Traditional holiday scheme==


==Ethnic minorities&#x27; holidays==
There are public holidays celebrated by certain ethnic minorities in certain regions, which are decided by local governments. The following are holidays at the provincial level.

The following are traditional holidays at the prefectural level, and there are more at lower-level divisions, i.e. county-level.

In addition, the following autonomous prefectures celebrate their founding date ( or ). Generally, the government takes one day off to all people working in such prefectures.

==Novel holidays==
Some Chinese young adults have begun to celebrate 11 November as the Singles&#x27; Day () because of the many ones (1s) and many singles in the date.

Serfs&#x27; Emancipation Day, celebrated on March 28, was established in Tibet in 2009.

<doc id="843461" wikidata="Q577017" url="?curid=843461" title="Ban (title)">
<text>Ban () was the title of local rulers or officeholders, similar to viceroy, used in several states in Central and Southeastern Europe between the 7th and 20th centuries. The most common examples have been found in medieval Croatia and medieval regions ruled and influenced by the Kingdom of Hungary. They often ruled as the king&#x27;s governmental representatives, supreme military commanders and judges, and in 18th century Croatia, even as chief government officials. In the Banate of Bosnia they were always &quot;de facto&quot; supreme rulers.

==Historical sources==
The first known mention of the title &quot;ban&quot; is in the 10th century by Constantine VII Porphyrogenitus, in the work &quot;De Administrando Imperio&quot;, in the 30th and 31st chapter &quot;Story of the province of Dalmatia&quot; and &quot;Of the Croats and of the country they now dwell in&quot;, dedicated to the Croats and the Croatian organisation of their medieval state. In the 30th chapter, describing in Byzantine Greek, how the Croatian state was divided into eleven (; župas), the ban (), (rules over) (Krbava), (Lika) (and) (Gacka). In the 31st chapter, describing the military and naval force of Croatia, &quot;Miroslav, who ruled for four years, was killed by the () (, i.e. Pribina)&quot;, and after that followed a temporary decrease in the military force of the Croatian Kingdom.

In 1029, a Latin charter was published by Jelena, sister of ban Godemir, in Obrovac, for donation to the monastery of &quot;St. Krševan&quot; in Zadar. In it she is introduced as &quot;...&quot;. Franjo Rački noted that if it is not an original, then it is certainly a transcript from the same 11th century.

In the 12th century, the title was mentioned by an anonymous monk of Dioclea and in the Supetar Cartulary. The Byzantine Greek historian John Kinnamos wrote the title in the Greek form (). In the Chronicle of the Priest of Duklja, which is dated to 12th and 13th century, in the Latin redaction is written as , , , and in the Croatian redaction only as . The Supetar Cartulary includes information until the 12th century, but the specific writing about bans is dated to the late 13th and early 14th century, a transcript of an older document. It mentions that there existed seven bans and they were elected by the six of Twelve noble tribes of Croatia, where the title is written as &quot;banus&quot; and &quot;bani&quot;.

==Origin==
===Etymology===
The Late Proto-Slavic word is considered to not be of native Slavic lexical stock and is generally argued to be a borrowing from a Turkic language, but such a derivation is highly criticized by the modern historians who rather argue Western European origin. The title&#x27;s origin among medieval Croats is not completely understood, and it is hard to determine the exact source and to reconstruct the primal form of the Turkic word it is derived from. According to mainstream theory it is generally explained as a derivation from the personal name of the Pannonian Avars ruler, Bayan, which is a derivation of the Proto-Turkic root &quot;*bāj-&quot; &quot;rich, richness, wealth; prince; husband&quot;. The Proto-Turkic root &quot;*bāj-&quot; is sometimes explained as a native Turkic word; however, it could also be a borrowing from the Iranian &quot;bay&quot; (from Proto-Iranian &quot;god; lord&quot;). The title word &quot;ban&quot; was also derived from the name Bojan, and there were additionally proposed Iranian, and Germanic, language origin.

The Avar nameword &quot;bajan&quot;, which some scholars trying to explain the title&#x27;s origin interpreted with alleged meaning of &quot;ruler of the horde&quot;, itself is attested as the 6th century personal name of Avar khagan Bayan I which led the raids on provinces of the Byzantine Empire. Some scholars assume that the personal name was a possible misinterpretation of a title, but Bayan already had a title of khagan, and the name, as well its derivation, are well confirmed. The title &quot;ban&quot; among the Avars has never been attested to in the historical sources, and as such the Avarian etymological derivation is unconvincing.

===Research history===
====20th century====
The title&#x27;s etymological and functional origins are unknown. It was used as &quot;evidence&quot; throughout the history of historiography to prove ideological assumptions on Avars, and specific theories on the origin of early medieval Croats. The starting point of the debate was year 1837, and the work of historian and philologist Pavel Jozef Šafárik, whose thesis has influenced generations of scholars. In his work &quot;Slovanské starožitnosti&quot; (1837), and later &quot;Slawische alterthümer&quot; (1843) and &quot;Geschichte der südslawischen Literatur&quot; (1864), was the first to connect the ruler title of &quot;ban&quot;, obviously not of Slavic lexical stock, which ruled over &quot;župas&quot; of today&#x27;s region of Lika, with the Pannonian Avars. He concluded how Avars lived in that same territory, basing his thesis on a literal reading of the statement from Constantine VII&#x27;s 30th chapter, &quot;there are still descendants of the Avars in Croatia, and are recognized as Avars&quot;. However, modern historians and archaeologists until now proved the opposite, that Avars never lived in the area of the Roman province of Dalmatia (including Lika), and that statement occurred somewhere in Pannonia. Šafárik assumed that the Avars by the name word &quot;bayan&quot; called their governor, and in the end concluded that the title &quot;ban&quot; derives from the &quot;name-title&quot; Bayan, which is also a Persian title word (see Turkish &quot;bey&quot; for Persian &quot;bag/bay&quot;), and neglected that it should derive from the Slavic name Bojan. His thesis would be later endorsed by many historians, and both South Slavic titles ban and župan were asserted as Avars official titles, but it had more to do with the scholar&#x27;s ideology of the time than actual reality.

Franz Miklosich wrote that the word, of Croatian origin, probably was expanded by the Croats among the Bulgarians and Serbs, while if it is Persian, than among Slavs is borrowed from the Turks. Erich Berneker wrote that became by contraction from &quot;bojan&quot;, which was borrowed from Mongolian-Turkic &quot;bajan&quot; (&quot;rich, wealthy&quot;), and noted Bajan is a personal name among Mongols, Avars, Bulgars, Altaic Tatars, and Kirghiz. Đuro Daničić decided for an intermediate solution; by origin is Avar or Persian from &quot;bajan&quot; (duke).

J. B. Bury derived the title from the name of Avar khagan Bayan I, and Bulgarian khagan Kubrat&#x27;s son Batbayan, with which tried to prove the Bulgarian-Avar (Turkic) theory on the origin of early medieval Croats. Historian Franjo Rački did not discard the possibility South Slavs could obtain it from Avars, but he disbelieved it had happened in Dalmatia, yet somewhere in Pannonia, and noticed the existence of &quot;bân&quot; (&quot;dux, custos&quot;) in Persian language. He also observed that ban could only be someone from one of the twelve Croatian tribes according to Supetar cartulary. This viewpoint is supported by the Chronicle of Duklja; Latin redaction; &quot;Unaquaque in provincia banum ordinavit, id est ducem, ex suis consanguineis fratribus&quot; ([Svatopluk] in every province allocated a ban, and they were duke&#x27;s consanguin brothers); Croatian redaction defines that all bans need to be by origin native and noble. Tadija Smičiklas and Vatroslav Jagić thought that the title should not derive from &quot;bajan&quot;, but from &quot;bojan&quot;, as thus how it is written in the Greek historical records (&quot;boan&quot;, &quot;boean&quot;).

Vjekoslav Klaić pointed out that the title before 12th century is documented only among Croats, and did not consider a problem that Bajan was a personal name and not a title, as seen in the most accepted derivation of Slavic word (kral/lj, krol). He mentioned both thesis (from Turkic-Persian, and Slavic &quot;bojan, bojarin&quot;), as well the German-Gothic theory derivation from banner and power of ban and King&#x27;s ban. Gjuro Szabo shared similar Klaić&#x27;s viewpoint, and emphasized the widespread distribution of a toponym from India to Ireland, and particularly among Slavic lands, and considered it as an impossibility that had derived from a personal name of a poorly known khagan, yet from a prehistoric word &quot;Ban&quot; or &quot;Pan&quot;.

Ferdo Šišić considered that is impossible it directly originated from a personal name of an Avar ruler because the title needs a logical continuity. He doubted its existence among Slavic tribes during the great migration, and within early South Slavic principalities. He strongly supported the Šafárik thesis about Avar descendants in Lika, now dismissed by scholars, and concluded that in that territory they had a separate governor whom they called &quot;bajan&quot;, from which after Avar assimilation, became Croatian title &quot;ban&quot;. The thesis of alleged Avar governor title Šišić based on his personal derivation of &quot;bajan&quot; from the title khagan. Nada Klaić advocated the same claims of Avars descendants in Lika, and considered bans and župans as Avar officials and governors.

Francis Dvornik on the other hand, although mentioned Šišić&#x27;s argumentation, considered to be of common Indo-European root (an Czechs and Poles have &quot;pan&quot; meaning &quot;master&quot;) or Iranian-Sarmatian origin, and &quot;we are fully entitled to suppose that the Croats had a similar organization when they were living northeast of the Carpathian Mountains&quot;. Stjepan Krizin Sakač emphasized that the word &quot;bajan&quot; is never mentioned in historical sources as a title, the title &quot;ban&quot; is never mentioned in such a form, and there&#x27;s no evidence that Avars and Turks ever used a title closely related to the title &quot;ban&quot;. Sakač connected the Croatian &quot;bân&quot; with statements from two Persian dictionaries (released 1893 and 1903); the noun &quot;bàn&quot; (lord, master, illustrious man, chief), suffix &quot;bân&quot; (guard), and the Sasanian title &quot;merz-bân&quot; (مرزبان marz-bān, Marzban). He considered that the early Croats originated from the Iranian-speaking Sarmatians probably Alans and Aorsi. The view of the possible Iranian origin (from &quot;ban&quot;; keeper, guard), besides Avarian, was shared by the modern scholars like Vladimir Košćak, Horace Lunt and Tibor Živković.

====21st century====
In the 21st century, historians like Mladen Ančić (2013) and Neven Budak (2018) in their research and synthesis of Croatian history concluded that the Avar linguistic argumentation is unconvincing and the historical sources poorly support such a thesis, emphasizing rather the Frankish origin of the title. Ančić emphasized that Avarian derivation is related to cultural and political ideologization since the 19th century which avoided any association with Germanization and German heritage. According to him, the title and its functions directly derive from a Germanic medieval term &quot;ban&quot; or &quot;bannum&quot;, the royal power of raising of armies and the exercise of justice later delegated to the counts, which was widely used in Francia. Archaeologist Vladimir Sokol (2007) independently came to a very similar conclusion relating it to the influence of Franks during their control of Istria and Liburnia. 

In 2013, historian Tomislav Bali noted the possible connection of the title with the military and territorial administrative unit &quot;bandon&quot; of the Byzantine Empire. The unit term derives, like the Greek &quot;bandon&quot; (from the 6th century) and Latin &quot;bandus&quot; and &quot;bandum&quot; (from the 9th century; banner), from the Gothic &quot;bandwō&quot;, a military term used by the troops who had Germanic or fought against Germanic peoples. Bali considered that the Croatian rulers possibly were influenced by the Byzantine model in the organization of the territory and borrowed the terminology and that such thesis can be related to Sokol&#x27;s arguing of Western influence.

==Use of the title==
Sources from the earliest periods are scarce, but existing show that since Middle Ages &quot;ban&quot; was the title used for local land administrators in the areas of Balkans where South Slavic population migrated around the 7th century, namely in Duchy of Croatia (8th century–c. 925), Kingdom of Croatia, Croatia in union with Hungary (1102–1526), and many regions ruled and influenced by Kingdom of Hungary like Banate of Bosnia (1154–1377), Banate of Severin (1228–1526), Banate of Macsó (1254–1496) and else. According to Noel Malcolm, usage of the Croatian title &quot;ban&quot; in Bosnia indicates that political ties with the Croatian world was from the earliest times, while supreme leader of the Serbs has always been called the Grand Prince (Veliki Župan) and never the &quot;ban&quot;.

The meaning of the title changed with time: the position of a &quot;ban&quot; can be compared to that of a viceroy or a high vassal such as a hereditary duke, but neither is accurate for all historical &quot;bans&quot;. In Croatia a &quot;ban&quot; reigned in the name of the ruler, he is the first state dignitary after King, the King&#x27;s legal representative, and had various powers and functions.

In South Slavic languages, the territory ruled by a &quot;ban&quot; was called &quot;Banovina&quot; (or &quot;Banat&quot;), often transcribed in English as &quot;Banate&quot; or &quot;Bannate&quot;, and also as &quot;Banat&quot; or &quot;Bannat&quot;.

===Croatia===


The earliest mentioned Croatian ban was Pribina in the 10th century, followed by Godemir (969–995), Gvarda or Varda (c. 995–1000), Božeteh (c. 1000–1030), Stjepan Praska (c. 1035–1058), Gojčo (c. 1060–1069), and later Dmitar Zvonimir (c. 1070–1075) and possibly Petar Snačić (c. 1075–1091) who would become the last native Croatian king.

The fairly late mid-10th century mention, because is not mentioned in older inscriptions and royal charters, indicates it was not preserved from the period of Avar Khaganate as was previously presumed in historiography. It rather indicates to the influence of the expansion of the Northern border by King Tomislav of Croatia, after the conquest of Slavonia by the Hungarians, making the position of ban similar to that of a margrave defending a frontier region. That the ban was significant almost as a king is seen in a 1042 charter in which a certain ban &quot;S&quot;, most probably Stjepan Praska, founded by himself a monastery of &quot;Chrysogoni Jaderæ&quot; granting it land, taxation, wealth, cattle, peasants, and that he attained the Byzantine imperial title of protospatharios. This imperial title, somehow related to that of a ban, was given to provincial governors and foreign rulers, and most probably was used to highlight the connection between the Croatian and Byzantine royal court.

After 1102, as Croatia entered personal union with Hungarian kingdom, the title of ban was appointed by the kings. Croatia was governed by the &quot;viceroys&quot; as a whole between 1102 and 1225, when it was split into two separate banovinas: Slavonia and Croatia, and Dalmatia. Two different bans were appointed until 1476, when the institution of a single ban was resumed. The title of &quot;ban&quot; persisted in Croatia even after 1527 when the country became part of the Habsburg monarchy, and continued all the way until 1918. In the 18th century, Croatian bans eventually become chief government officials in Croatia. They were at the head of Ban&#x27;s Government as well Court (Tabula Banalis), effectively the first prime ministers of Croatia.

===Bosnia===

At the beginning Bosnian status as a de facto independent state fluctuated, depending on era, in terms of its relations with the Kingdom of Hungary and Byzantine Empire. Its rulers were called bans, and their territory &quot;banovina&quot;. Nevertheless, the Bosnian bans were never viceroys, in the sense as their neighbors in the west in Croatia, appointed by the king.

Earliest mentioned Bosnian bans were Borić (1154–1163) and Kulin (1163–1204). The Bosnian medieval dynasties who used the title Ban from the 12th until the end of 14th century includes Borić, Kulinić with Ban Kulin and Matej Ninoslav being most prominent member, and Kotromanić dynasty.

Some of the most prominent bans from the 12th until the end of 13th centuries includes Ban Borić, Ban Kulin, Ban Stephen Kulinić, Ban Matej Ninoslav, Prijezda I, Prijezda II, Stephen I and Stephen II.

The Bosnian medieval state used the title &quot;ban&quot; until the rulers adopted the use of the title &quot;king&quot; under the Kingdom of Bosnia, with Ban Stephen&#x27;s II successor Tvrtko I being the first who inaugurate the title &quot;king&quot;.

===Kingdom of Hungary===

Regions ruled and influenced by Kingdom of Hungary, besides those in Croatia and Bosnia, were also formed as banates usually as frontier provinces in today&#x27;s Serbia, Romania and Bulgaria. It includes:

* Banate of Só (12th century-1410) and Banate of Usora (12/13th century-1324/1463) which rulership was contested by the Banate and Kingdom of Bosnia 
* Banate of Severin (1228–1526) which in the 16th century was divided between Hungary (see Banate of Lugos and Karánsebes) and Wallachia (see Great Banship of Craiova, Banat of Craiova)
* Banate of Macsó (1254–1284, 1319–1496)
* Banate of Braničevo, Banate of Kučevo and Banate of Baranja (13th century) contested between Hungarian king, Bulgarians Darman and Kudelin and Serbian Stefan Dragutin
* Banate of Bulgaria (1365–1369)

As part of the anti-Ottoman defensive system were formed:
* Banate of Belgrade (1427–1521) in Serbia
* Banate of Jajce (1463–1527) and Srebrenik (1464–1521/1521) in Bosnia

In 1921 temporarily existed Lajtabánság in Burgenland (Austria).

===Bulgaria===
The title &quot;ban&quot; was also awarded in the Second Bulgarian Empire on few occasions, but remained an exception. One example was the 14th-century governor of Sredets (Sofia) Ban Yanuka.

===Kingdom of Yugoslavia===
Ban was also used in the 19th century Kingdom of Serbia and Kingdom of Yugoslavia between 1929 and 1941. Ban was the title of the governor of each province (called &quot;banovina&quot;) of the Kingdom of Yugoslavia between 1929 and 1941. The weight of the title was far less than that of a medieval ban&#x27;s feudal office.

==Legacy==
The word &quot;ban&quot; is preserved in many modern toponym and place names, in the regions where bans once ruled, as well as in the personal names.

A region in central Croatia, south of Sisak, is called Banovina or Banija.

The region of Banat in the Pannonian Basin between the Danube and the Tisza rivers, now in Romania, Serbia and Hungary.

In the toponymys &quot;Bando&quot;, &quot;Bandola&quot;, &quot;Banj dvor&quot; and &quot;Banj stol&quot; and &quot;Banovo polje&quot; in Lika,

In Bosnia and Herzegovina numerous toponyms exist, such as &quot;Banbrdo&quot;, village Banova Jaruga, city Banovići, and possibly Banja Luka.

The term &quot;ban&quot; is still used in the phrase &quot;banski dvori&quot; (&quot;ban&#x27;s court&quot;) for the buildings that host high government officials.
The Banski dvori in Zagreb hosts the Croatian Government, while the Banski dvor in Banja Luka hosted the President of Republika Srpska (a first-tier subdivision of Bosnia and Herzegovina) until 2008. The building known as &quot;Bela banovina&quot; (&quot;the white banovina&quot;) in Novi Sad hosts the parliament and government of the Autonomous Province of Vojvodina in Serbia. The building received this name because it previously hosted the administration of Danube Banovina (1929–1941). &quot;Banovina&quot; is also the colloquial name of the city hall building in Split, and of the administrative building (rectorate and library) of the University of Niš.

In Croatian Littoral &quot;banica&quot; or &quot;banić&quot; signified &quot;small silver coins&quot;, in Vodice &quot;banica&quot; signified &quot;unknown, old coins&quot;. The Banovac was a coin struck between 1235 and 1384. In the sense of money same is in Romania, Bulgaria (bronze coins), and Old Polish (shilling).

The term is also found in personal surnames: Ban, Banić, Banović, Banovac, Balaban, Balabanić.

Banović Strahinja, a 1981 Yugoslavian adventure film, is based on Strahinja Banović, a fictional hero of Serbian epic poetry.

<text>The Communist Party in Saudi Arabia (, &quot;al-Hizb ash-Shuyu&#x27;i fi as-Sa&#x27;udiyah&quot;) was a political party in Saudi Arabia.

==History==
The Communist Party in Saudi Arabia (CPSA) was formed on August 31, 1975. It had its origins in the National Renewal Front which was founded on September 23, 1954 and transformed in the National Liberation Front on October 17, 1958. The NLF was part of the Arab National Liberation Front since 1963. The communists inside the NLF had a separate organization called the Organization of Saudi Communists (OSC). The groups were targeted by a wave of arrests between 1968 and 1969. The remainder of the NLF founded the CPSA in 1975. The party membership in 1975 was however very small, and is thought to have numbered as few as 30 members. The first secretary general of the CPSA was Mustafa Wahba, a son of Hafiz Wahba who was one of the advisors of King Abdulaziz. Mustafa Wahba used the alias Mahdi Habib in the post. He held the title until 1991 when the party was dissolved.

Declining popularity caused by the collapse of the Soviet Union and the rise in popularity of political Islamism caused the party to rename itself as Democratic Assembly of Saudi Arabia () and take up the cause of democratic reform in the early 1990s. Soon thereafter, the government released the political prisoners of the party in exchange that the party promised to disband.

==Structure==

The CPSA had a youth organization, the Union of Democratic Youth – Saudi Arabia (&quot;Ittihad ash-Shabab ad-Dimuqrati fi as-Sa&#x27;udiyah&quot;), with office in Damascus, Syria. Other organizations close to the CPSA were the Workers&#x27; Federation of Saudi Arabia, the National Union of Students of Saudi Arabia (NUSSA) and the Democratic Women&#x27;s League of Saudi Arabia.

Its central organ was &quot;Tareeq al-Kadiḥeen&quot; (&quot;Way of the Toilers&quot;).

The party was always illegal and persecuted by the regime.

Shiites were attracted to Saudi opposition groups, including the Communist Party, due to resentment at discrimination against them on religious grounds by the Saudi Government. As a result, the bulk of the members of the Communist Party were members of Saudi Arabia&#x27;s Shiite community.

==Ideology==
Saudi Communist Party literature was filled with critiques of the Saudi economy, discrimination against women, and of the pro-Western foreign policy of the Saudi ruling family. The Communist Party also criticized the Saudi ruling family as being corrupt.

The CPSA had close relations with other Arab communist parties and was a pro-Soviet party. In its previous inception as the National Liberation Front, the group had pursued closer ties with the National Liberation Front – Bahrain.

As part of the restructuring of the party in the early 1990s, the new Democratic Assembly took up the cause of democratic reform.

<text>The Persian Encyclopedia (; Romanized as &quot;Dāyerat-ol-ma&#x27;āref-e Fārsi&quot;) is one of the most comprehensive and authoritative Encyclopedias written in Persian. It is a &quot;two-volume&quot; encyclopedia published as three &quot;physical&quot; volumes.

The encyclopedia was based, in part, on the 1953, 1960, and 1968 editions of &quot;The Columbia Viking Desk Encyclopedia&quot;. It was initially published under the supervision of Gholamhossein Mosahab, who started the project in 1955 in the Franklin Book Programs office in Tehran. Mosahab left the project after the first volume (words starting with &quot;Alef&quot; to &quot;Seen&quot;) was published in 1966.

The second volume was actually published in two &quot;parts&quot;, making the encyclopedia three &quot;physical&quot; volumes. The first part (&quot;Sheen&quot; to &quot;Lām&quot;) was published in 1978, ten years after the first volume. It was supervised by Reza Aghsa.

The Iranian revolution in 1979, the death of Mosahab in the same year, and the takeover of the assets of the Franklin office in Tehran by the government delayed further publication.

The second part (&quot;Meem&quot; to &quot;Yeh&quot;) was published by Amir Kabir Publishers in 1996, eighteen years after the first part of the volume, but not mentioning a new supervisor&#x27;s name.

The encyclopedia total is 3385 three-column pages. The encyclopedia contains an introduction that explains in detail the principles and methods of work and how to use the encyclopedia.

This encyclopedia has 43,000 entries, of which 23,000 are foreign entries, 11,000 are related to Iran and Islam, and the rest are reference entries. Foreign entries are generally translations and adaptations, but entries related to Iran are entirely authored. 

The three volumes were republished with minor changes by Amir Kabir Publishers in 2002 ().

<text>Mets de Guaynabo are a Puerto Rican professional basketball team based in Guaynabo, Puerto Rico. The Mets compete in the Baloncesto Superior Nacional (BSN) as a member of the league&#x27;s B Division. Founded in 1935 as the original Cangrejeros of Santurce franchise, the team relocated to Guaynabo in 1976 and became the Guaynabo Mets. The Mets play their home games at Mario Morales Coliseum, named after Mario &quot;Quijote&quot; Morales, who led the team to its three championships during the 1980s. The Mets also reached the BSN finals in 1991 and 1993, losing both times to the Leones of Ponce.The team dissolved in 2015, but was reinstated with new ownership in 2019.

The 2020 season ended with a 2–1 series loss in the semifinals to the Vaqueros of Bayamón for the new Mets franchise. 

The Mets followed up the semifinal appearance in 2020 with a surprise trip to the finals in the 2021 season, where they eventually lost to the Capitanes of Arecibo. 

The 2022 season ended with the Mets missing the playoffs for the first time since returning to the BSN. 

In 2023, the Mets made the playoffs and were considered one of the best teams in the league, but eventually lost to the Gigantes of Carolina (4-3), who managed to beat the Mets after going down 3–2.

==Early history==

The Mets were coached by legendary National Team and Olympic Coach Julio Toro and were a force in Puerto Rican basketball during the 1980s. With such players as Fico Lopez, Mario Morales, José Sosa, Earl Brown, Jose Santos, Gustavo Santos, Papiro Leon, Papote Agosto and many more, the Mets won championships in 1980, 1982 and 1989, while reaching the finals in 1981, 1983, and 1985. They reached the playoffs every year during that decade.

The Mets were able to acquire Jose and Gustavo Santos from the Rio Piedras Cardinals whom they had defeated the previous year in the Superior Basketball league semi finals. 5 players for two arguably the largest trade in PR basketball history. The Mets were reborn with the Santos trade and looked to their minor league for future stars Papiro Leon, Fico Lopez, Papote Agosto.
So dominant and young was this team, that a dynasty was born, the Mets reached the finals in 4 consecutive years winning two championships. All of their players were below the age of 25, with teenagers shoring up the bench. The Puerto Rican Basketball Federation had to break up this team by introducing a draft and new rule that a team can only protect &quot;6&quot; players thus breaking up the powerful Mets. Lopez and Morales, who were also brothers in law as Morales married Lopez&#x27;s sister, famous volleyball player Eva Lopez, formed a formidable duo on the court, with Lopez playing point guard and Morales forward. They became Puerto Rican basketball legends.

Even though the team was not active in the league from 2015 to 2019, many other sports teams in Guaynabo, from baseball to volleyball, have assumed the Mets name.

==Return as an expansion team==

On November 22, 2019, league officials announced the first expansion team since 1993 would be established in the San Juan area. Owners Marc Grossman and Mark Linder initially eyed Roberto Clemente Coliseum as the home court for their new team, but San Juan&#x27;s Mayor Carmen Yulin Cruz expressed concerns the team wouldn&#x27;t be able to play a full season at the venue due to previously scheduled events. Grossman and Linder then decided to revive the Mets de Guaynabo, five years after the original team left Guaynabo.

The team reintroduced themselves on December 17, 2019, in a press conference with Grossman, former Puerto Rico national basketball team general manager Alfredo “Piraña” Morales, Guaynabo Mayor Angel Perez Otero, and BSN President Ricardo Dalmau. During the press conference, team officials revealed the new team, the league&#x27;s tenth, signed its first free agent, Angel Alamo. Alamo was a 34-year-old forward who had played previously for the Mets in 2012 and 2013. The team also selected four players in an expansion draft on November 22, 2019, and received the 11th pick in the January 15, 2020 draft.

Grossman and Linder hired Puerto Rico national basketball team general manager Alfredo “Piraña” Morales to be the Mets&#x27; general manager. Prior to the 2020 season, Grossman pursued former NBA All Star Metta World Peace to be the Mets&#x27; head coach. The team was also considering former NBA All Star Charles Oakley, Paco Olmos, Allans Colón, and Carlos Calcaño. In December 2019, World Peace held tryouts for the team in Los Angeles, but was not officially named coach.

Isaiah Austin, a former Baylor University basketball star who played professionally for teams in China and Lebanon since 2017, signed with the Mets in December 2019 as one of their three import players allowed as an expansion team.

<text>Rodney Hylton Smith, better known by his stage name Roots Manuva (born 9 September 1972), is a British rapper and producer. Since his debut in 1994, he has produced numerous albums and singles on the label Big Dada, achieving commercial success with albums &quot;Run Come Save Me&quot; and &quot;Slime &amp; Reason&quot;. He has been described as &quot;one of the most influential artists in British music history.&quot; His most recent studio album, &quot;Bleeds&quot;, was released in October 2015.

==Biography==
Smith grew up around Stockwell, London, England. His parents were from a small village in Jamaica where his father was a preacher and tailor. He spent much of his early life in poverty and this and his strict Pentecostal upbringing had an influence on his music as can be heard in many of his tracks such as &quot;Sinny Sin Sins&quot; and &quot;Colossal Insight&quot;.

Of his early discovery of music he says:
Smith made his recorded debut in 1994 as part of IQ Procedure through Suburban Base&#x27;s short-lived hip hop imprint Bluntly Speaking Vinyl. He debuted as Roots Manuva the same year on Blak Twang&#x27;s &quot;Queen&#x27;s Head&quot; single, before releasing his own single, &quot;Next Type of Motion&quot; the following year through the same label, the Sound of Money. 1996 saw the release of his collaborations with Skitz (&quot;Where My Mind Is At&quot;/&quot;Blessed Be The Manner&quot;) on 23 Skidoo&#x27;s Ronin label. The release of &quot;Feva&quot; on Tony Vegas&#x27; Wayward imprint followed in 1997. This was also the year that saw the first releases from Big Dada, a collaboration between Coldcut&#x27;s Ninja Tune label and hip hop journalist Will Ashon.

Releasing for Coldcut&#x27;s renowned experimental/hip hop label Ninja Tune in 1998, some of his music may be seen as a predecessor of grime. The following year he released his debut album, &quot;Brand New Second Hand&quot;. A reference to his family&#x27;s modest lifestyle, the title is a phrase his mother used for presents he got as a youngster that were pre-used. The single &quot;Witness (1 Hope)&quot;, from his second album &quot;Run Come Save Me&quot;, with its lyrical flow and heavy shuffling squelch bass (allegedly a result of Smith trying to copy the &quot;Doctor Who&quot; theme) is a UK rap anthem. He had such an impact on the UK rap scene that &quot;The Times&quot; said that &quot;his is the voice of urban Britain, encompassing dub, ragga, funk and hip hop as it sweeps from crumbling street corners to ganja-filled dancehalls, setting gritty narratives against all manner of warped beats.&quot; Manuva was rewarded for his breakthrough with a MOBO as Best Hip Hop Act that year.

The lyrics of his songs have a British edge, with critics highlighting his references to eating cheese on toast and drinking bitter as examples of this.
He can be heard on many songs performed with other artists such as Chali 2na (and Ozomatli), Jamie Cullum, DJ Shadow, Mr Scruff, U.N.K.L.E., Fun Lovin&#x27; Criminals, Nightmares on Wax, The Cinematic Orchestra, Beth Orton, The Herbaliser, Leftfield, Saian Supa Crew and Coldcut. He also made an appearance on the Gorillaz album &quot;Demon Days&quot;, on the track &quot;All Alone&quot;, and Jungle track &quot;You Ain&#x27;t No Celebrity&quot; in 2023.

==Hiatus==
In 2018, Manuva was hospitalised for six months due to suffering from a subdural hematoma. The brain injury left him with memory loss and reduced mobility in his left leg.

<doc id="843482" wikidata="Q911663" url="?curid=843482" title="Bascule bridge">
<text>A bascule bridge (also referred to as a drawbridge or a lifting bridge) is a moveable bridge with a counterweight that continuously balances a span, or leaf, throughout its upward swing to provide clearance for boat traffic. It may be single- or double-leafed.

The name comes from the French term for balance scale, which employs the same principle. Bascule bridges are the most common type of movable span because they open quickly and require relatively little energy to operate, while providing the possibility for unlimited vertical clearance for marine traffic.

==History==
Bascule bridges have been in use since ancient times, but until the adoption of steam power in the 1850s, very long, heavy spans could not be moved quickly enough for practical application.

==Types==


There are three types of bascule bridge and the counterweights to the span may be located above or below the bridge deck.

The fixed-trunnion (sometimes a &quot;Chicago&quot; bascule) rotates around a large axle that raises the span(s). The Chicago bascule name derives from the location where it is widely used, and is a refinement by Joseph Strauss of the fixed-trunnion.

The trunnion (sometimes a &quot;Scherzer&quot; rolling lift), raises the span by rolling on a track resembling a rocking-chair base. The &quot;Scherzer&quot; rolling lift is a refinement patented in 1893 by American engineer William Donald Scherzer.

The rarer Rall type combines rolling lift with longitudinal motion on trunnions when opening. It was patented (1901) by Theodor Rall. One of the few surviving examples is the Broadway Bridge (1913), in Portland, Oregon.

<doc id="843485" wikidata="Q716502" url="?curid=843485" title="Public holidays in Taiwan">
<text>The following are considered [[holiday]]s in [[Taiwan]]. Some are official holidays, and some are not.

== History ==
In 2016, the Tsai Ing-wen government removed seven public holidays. The holidays were removed due to a political compromise arising from a campaign promise Tsai made while running for president that committed her government to providing two days off per week for all workers. 

When implementing the change, the government faced opposition from various interests including businesses, and a compromise was reached to provide two days off per week and remove seven paid public holidays.

The removed public holidays were:

* January 2, the day after New Year&#x27;s Day
* March 29, Youth Day (commemorating the Huanghuagang Uprising)
* September 28, Teachers&#x27; Day
* October 25, Retrocession Day (commemorating the end of Japanese rule of Taiwan and Penghu and the return of Taiwan to the Republic of China)
* October 31, Chiang Kai-shek’s birthday
* November 12, Sun Yat-sen&#x27;s birthday
* December 25, Republic of China Constitution Day

A longstanding political debate over reinstating the removed public holidays was reignited during the second session of the Legislative Yuan in February, 2025. Kuomintang legislators said they would seek to reinstate the holidays by amending labor regulations. The proposal received support from a Taiwan People&#x27;s Party legislator who said their party would support the change. The Democratic Progressive Party caucus suggested the proposal was populist.

===Unofficial holidays===

The following holidays are also observed on Taiwan but are not official holidays observed by civil servants of the central government. Some sectors of the workforce may have time off on some of the following holidays, such as Labor Day, Armed Forces Day, and Teachers&#x27; Day.

Before 1949, a number of public holidays were celebrated by certain ethnic minorities in regions within the ROC, which were decided by local governments and entities. Since 1949, these holidays continued to be celebrated by ethnic groups as such in Taiwan Area only.

<text>A ban is a formal or informal prohibition of something. Bans are formed for the prohibition of activities within a certain political territory. Some bans in commerce are referred to as embargoes. &quot;Ban&quot; is also used as a verb similar in meaning to &quot;to prohibit&quot;.

==Etymology==

In current English usage, &quot;ban&quot; is mostly synonymous with &quot;prohibition&quot;. Historically, Old English &quot;(ge)bann&quot; is a derivation from the verb &quot;bannan&quot; &quot;to summon, command, proclaim&quot; from an earlier Common Germanic &quot;*bannan&quot; &quot;to command, forbid, banish, curse&quot;. The modern sense &quot;to prohibit&quot; is influenced by the cognate Old Norse &quot;banna&quot; &quot;to curse, to prohibit&quot; and also from Old French &quot;ban&quot;, ultimately a loan from Old Frankish, meaning &quot;outlawry, banishment&quot;.

The Indo-European etymology of the Germanic term is from a root &quot;*bha-&quot; meaning &quot;to speak&quot;. Its original meaning was magical, referring to utterances that carried a power to curse.

== Banned political parties ==

In many countries political parties or groups are banned. Parties may be banned for many reasons, including extremism and anti-democratic ideologies, on ethnic or religious grounds, and sometimes simply because the group opposes government policies, with the ban sometimes alleging wrongdoing as the cause. Germany, for instance, has a long history behind its modern practice of banning political parties. The Nazi Party was banned in 1923; after the Nazi Party came into power in 1933 opposing parties such as the Social Democrats (SPD) and Communist Party of Germany (KPD) were banned, the Nazi Party was again banned and the ban on other parties lifted after the Nazi defeat in 1945, and the Communist Party was again banned from 1956 to 1968.

== Banning marriages ==
There have been many bans on marriages, and sometimes other sexual liaisons, between people of different ethnic background or religion, for example between non-Jews and Jews in Nazi Germany, people classified as &quot;white&quot; and non-whites in apartheid South Africa, etc.

For much of the 1800s and 1900s there were bans on marriage between people of different races (interracial marriage) in many of the United States. However, the ban on interracial marriage was overturned by the Supreme Court of the United States in 1967 in the landmark civil rights case &quot;Loving v. Virginia&quot;, in which the Court ruled Virginia&#x27;s miscegenation law an unconstitutional violation of the fundamental right to marriage. Historically child marriage was common, but is now banned in many countries.

== Banned people ==

===Holy Roman Empire===
The Imperial ban was a form of outlawry in the Holy Roman Empire. At different times, it could be declared by the Holy Roman Emperor, by courts including the League of the Holy Court (, ) and the , or by the Imperial Diet. People under Imperial ban lost all their rights and possessions, and anyone had the right to rob, injure or kill such persons without legal consequences. The Imperial ban automatically followed the excommunication of a person, and extended to anyone offering help to a person under the imperial ban.

===Under apartheid in South Africa===

During the apartheid régime in South Africa, the National Party government issued banning orders to individuals seen to be threats to its power — often black politicians or organizations — these banning orders acted as suppression orders. Individuals or organisations and critical medias banned by the Suppression of Communism Act, 1950 (which effectively defined &quot;Communism&quot; as opposition to the government) could not communicate with more than one person at any time unless at home (thus preventing them from engaging in political activities), travel to outside a specific magisterial district without government approval. The order had mostly domestic effect with versatile legal formative effects. These were for example: local or supra-regional residence restrictions, the prohibition of public expression of opinion, prohibition of printed publications and prohibition of citation in journalistic or scientific contexts the writings of the affecting persons or the participation of gatherings. Measures of this kind could also be applied to groups of people, organisations (for example the Defence Aid Fund for Southern Africa, 1966) and institutions (for example the Christian Institute, 1977). There were several laws that legalised such actions (Riotous Assemblies Act - 1914 and later 1956, Unlawful Organisations Act - 1960, Suppression of Communism Amendment Act - 1967, Internal Security Act - 1976, 1982, 1986). The General Law Amendment Act, No. 76 of 1962 empowered the Minister of Justice to publish the banned persons in the Government Gazette. Helen Suzman, a liberal member of the South African parliament, defended the right of free assembly and freedom of expression for all citizens in 1986 and pointed to the growing confrontation between the black population and the police.

The banishment of persons, i.e. expulsion from their place of residence, was practised in smaller numbers. Between 1948 and 1967, this affected 156 people. After 1972, this measure was only applied sporadically.

==Health and safety==
Bans in various jurisdictions on possession of some weapons, smoking, and narcotic drugs are enacted to exert control over the general public.

<text>Ban of Benoic (Old French: &quot;Ban de Bénoïc&quot;) is a character in Arthurian legend. King Ban first appeared by this name in the &quot;Lancelot propre&quot; part of the 13th-century French Vulgate Cycle as the ruler of the realm in France named (Bénoïc; alternatively Benewic, Benoich, Benoit, Benuic, Benwick) and father of Sir Lancelot and Sir Hector de Maris, as well as brother of King Bors. Ban of Benoic largely corresponds to the other versions of the father of Lancelot, including Pant of Gen[n]ewis in the German &quot;Lanzelet&quot;, Haud of Schuwake in the English &quot;Sir Lancelot du Lake&quot;, and Domolot of Lokva in the Belarusian &quot;&quot;.

==Role in Arthurian romances==
Ban&#x27;s kingdom of Benoic, the capital of which is Trebe (&quot;Trèbe&quot;), is located at the border between Armorican Brittany and Gaul. With his wife Queen Elaine (&quot;Élaine&quot;, a sister of King Bors&#x27; wife Evaine), King Ban begets the future great knight Lancelot (birth name Galahad, &quot;Galaad&quot;). Earlier, thanks to Merlin&#x27;s magic, he sleeps with the Lady de Maris (&quot;Dame des Mares&quot;), who becomes illegitimately pregnant with Hector de Maris (&quot;Hector des Mares&quot;), Lancelot&#x27;s half-brother and later one of his closest companions and followers. 

King Ban is first shown campaigning in the insular Britain in support of the young King Arthur. His castle is located in the middle of a marsh reputed to be impregnable, but the neighboring lord, King Claudas of the Wasteland, manages to set it on fire. Ban alone manages to escape along with his wife and their son but, overwhelmed by the disaster, promptly dies of grief. At this moment, the infant Lancelot is taken by the Lady of the Lake to her abode, where he is later joined by the now also dead Bors the Elder&#x27;s sons Lionel and Bors the Younger. When the children grow up and become Knights of the Round Table, they aid Arthur in finally defeating Claudas and reclaiming their fathers&#x27; land. The war between King Ban and Claudas may symbolize the early medieval struggle of the Bretons against the invading Franks.

==Origin in Welsh myth==
According to Roger Sherman Loomis, &quot;Ban is usually called Ban of Benoic, easily accounted for as a misunderstanding of &quot;Bran le Benoit&quot;, an exact translation of the Welsh &quot;Bendigeid Bran&quot;, or &#x27;Bran the Blessed&#x27;.&quot; That is, the Vulgate author has misread and misconstrued the Old French &quot;benoit&quot; (=&#x27;blessed&#x27;) to be the name of a non-existent realm Benoic - of which he deduces King B(r)an to have been the ruler. The name Ban de Benoic/Benewic is also found in mutated form as Pant von Genewis (scribal error where initial &#x27;B&#x27; misread as &#x27;G&#x27;) in another early Arthurian text treating of the hero Lancelot, namely the &quot;Lanzelet&quot; of Ulrich von Zatzikhoven.

As professors Loomis and Helaine Newstead have demonstrated, there is a tendency for individual figures from Celtic mythology to yield multiple characters in Arthurian romances and this process is apparent in the number of Arthurian characters whose names and/or attributes can be traced back to the gigantic king (see also Fisher King) and probable deity, Brân, whose exploits are recounted in Branwen ferch Llŷr (see also Llŷr), the second of the &quot;Four Branches of the Mabinogi&quot;. Newstead wrote: &quot;The evidence concerning Ban, though it survives in obscure and refractory forms, nevertheless preserves connections with Baudemaguz, Brangor, Bron and Corbenic.&quot;

Loomis believed one of the authors of the Vulgate &quot;Lancelot&quot; preserved the memory of two figures from Welsh myth through their relation to Welsh toponyms: if it be accepted that the character of King Ban is indeed derived (as noted above) from Brân the Blessed, it follows that the Kingdom of King Ban is to be equated with the &#x27;Land of Brân&#x27;, which in Welsh designates the northeast of Wales. Abutting on the &#x27;Land of Brân&#x27; was the &#x27;Retreat of Gwri&#x27; (now known as the Wirral peninsula). Loomis suggested that the name Bohours de Gannes given to the brother of King Ban / Brân in the Vulgate text is part scribal error (&#x27;Bohours&#x27; for an original, &#x27;Gwri&#x27;-derived &#x27;Gohours&#x27;) and part geographical rationalization (substitution of &#x27;Gannes&#x27; for &#x27;Galles&#x27;, i.e. of &#x27;Gaul&#x27; for &#x27;Wales&#x27;).

==In modern culture==
Ban is depicted as the &quot;Fox Sin of Greed&quot;, as well as the member of the titular group of knights, in Nakaba Suzuki&#x27;s manga &quot;The Seven Deadly Sins&quot; and in its anime adaptation. In the series, Ban is depicted as tall, with spiky white hair and a very youthful appearance, due to having drunk from the Fountain of Youth. He eventually has a child named Lancelot at the end of the series.

<text>In the mythology of William Blake, Albion is the primeval man whose fall and division results in the Four Zoas: Urizen, Tharmas, Luvah/Orc and Urthona/Los. The name derives from the ancient and mythological name of Britain, Albion.

==Sources==
In the mythical story of the founding of Britain, Albion was a giant and a son of Poseidon, the Greek god of the sea. He was a contemporary of Heracles, who killed him. Albion founded a country on the island and ruled there. Britain, then called Albion after its founder, was inhabited by his Giant descendants until about 1100 years before Julius Cæsar&#x27;s invasion of Britain, when Brutus of Troy came and defeated the small number of Giants that remained (as a group of the Giants had killed all the others).

According to another account, Noah&#x27;s son Japhet had a son named Histion, who had four sons. Their names were Francus, Romanus, Brittos and Alemannus, and the French, Roman, British and German people are descended from them. Brittos divided Britain into three kingdoms and gave each to one of his sons. They were Loegria (a Latinization of the Welsh Lloegyr), Scotland and Cambria.

The division of the primordial man is found in many mythic and mystic systems throughout the world, including Adam Kadmon in Kabbalah and Prajapati in the Rigveda.

==Usage==
The long, unfinished poem properly called &quot;Vala, or The Four Zoas&quot; expands the significance of the Zoas, but they are integral to all of Blake&#x27;s prophetic books.

Blake&#x27;s painting of a naked figure raising his arms, loosely based on &quot;Vitruvian Man&quot;, is now identified as a portrayal of Albion, following the discovery of a printed version with an inscription identifying the figure. It was formerly known as &quot;Glad Day&quot;, since it was assumed by Alexander Gilchrist to illustrate a quotation from Shakespeare.

Blake also uses the name Albion in its traditional meaning, as an ancient synonym for Britain, in his poem &quot;A Little Boy Lost&quot; in &quot;Songs of Experience&quot;. The poem tells about a young boy who, using reason, realizes that humans are selfish, and that &quot;naught loves another as itself&quot;. He asks the priest: &quot;Father, how can I love you / or any of my brothers more? / I love you like the little bird / That picks up crumbs around the door&quot;. The priest accuses the boy of blasphemy, and burns him &quot;in a holy place / where many had been burned before&quot;. Blake concludes the poem by asking: &quot;Are such things done on Albion&#x27;s shore?&quot;

==Children==
The Sons of Albion feature in the poem &quot;Jerusalem&quot;. They are 12, and are named as Hand, Hyle, Coban, Guantok, Peachey, Brereton, Slayd, Hutton, Scofield, Kox, Kotope, Bowen. These names are mostly drawn from figures from Blake&#x27;s 1803 sedition trial.

The Daughters of Albion feature in &quot;Visions of the Daughters of Albion&quot;, and other prophetic books. They are named, not consistently though, in &quot;The Four Zoas&quot; and in &quot;Jerusalem&quot;:

# Gwendolen
# Ragan
# Sabrina
# Gonorill
# Mehetabel
# Cordella
# Boadicea/Gwiniverra
# Conwenna
# Estrild
# Gwinefrid
# Ignoge
# Cambel

Gwiniverra has replaced Boadicea, who is later equated with Cambel. They are mostly drawn from Geoffrey of Monmouth&#x27;s &quot;Historia Regum Britanniae&quot; and John Milton&#x27;s &quot;The History of Britain&quot;.

<text>Not Necessarily the News (shortened as NNTN) is an American satirical sketch comedy series first aired on HBO in September 1982 as a comedy special, and then as a series from 1983 to 1990. For most of the run, the series featured Anne Bloom, Danny Breen, Rich Hall, Mitchell Laurance, Stuart Pankin and Lucy Webb. For the final season, the series switched to a live, up-to-the-minute format and also included reports from many other correspondents including Will Durst, Merrill Markoe, Richard Rosen and Harry Shearer.

The series was the birthplace of Rich Hall&#x27;s sniglets, which spawned a number of books. It also included early appearances from Jan Hooks, and, among the many writers the show employed, was the first credited professional television writing gig for Conan O&#x27;Brien, Greg Daniels, Al Jean and Mike Reiss. The show was considered an inspiration and a predecessor to future news satirical programs like &quot;The Daily Show&quot;, &quot;The Colbert Report&quot;, and &quot;Last Week Tonight&quot;, among others.

==Synopsis==
It featured sketches, parody news items, commercial parodies, and humorous bits made from overdubbing or editing actual news footage. It was based on the British series &quot;Not the Nine O&#x27;Clock News&quot; that had ended earlier in 1982.

The original format lasted until May 1989, when the series switched to a live, up-to-the-minute format in the style of &quot;Saturday Night Live&quot;″s &quot;Weekend Update&quot; and &quot;Friday&quot;″s &quot;Friday Edition&quot;. &quot;NNTN&quot; came to an end in December the following year with its final episode, a &quot;Not Necessarily the Year in Review&quot; special for 1990.

==Cast==
*Anne Bloom (1982–1990), as Frosty Kimelman
*Rich Hall (1982–1990), who did a regular feature on &quot;sniglets&quot;.

*Will Durst (1989–1990)
*Jon Ross (1989–1990)
*Harry Shearer (1989–1990)

==Theme and episodes==
The show&#x27;s first theme song was the instrumental bridge of Eric Clapton&#x27;s cover of &quot;Motherless Children&quot;. It was switched to &quot;Hooray For The City&quot; by Jack Mack &amp; The Heart Attack in 1985.

The series also spawned two specialized episodes that aired as occasional specials: &quot;Not Necessarily the Year in Review&quot;, and &quot;Not Necessarily the Sniglets&quot;.

<text>Salvador de Madariaga y Rojo (23 July 1886 – 14 December 1978) was a Spanish &quot;eminent liberal&quot;, diplomat, writer, historian and pacifist who was nominated for the Nobel Prize in Literature and the Nobel Peace Prize and awarded the Charlemagne Prize in 1973.

==Early life==
Salvador de Madariaga y Rojo was born on 23 July 1886 in A Coruña, Galicia, Kingdom of Spain. He graduated with a degree in engineering in Paris, France. 

==Career==
Madariaga returned to Spain and became an engineer for the Northern Spanish Railway Company. He then came into contact with &quot;Generación del 14&quot; intellectuals.

In 1916, he abandoned that for work in London as a journalist for &quot;The Times&quot; newspaper. Meanwhile, he began publishing his first essays. In 1921, he became a press member of the Secretariat of the League of Nations and chief of the Disarmament Section in 1922. In 1928, he was appointed Professor of Spanish at Oxford University for three years during which he wrote a book on nation psychology, &quot;Englishmen, Frenchmen, Spaniards&quot;.

In 1931, the Second Spanish Republic appointed Madariaga as Spanish ambassador to the United States and a permanent delegate to the League of Nations; he kept the latter post for five years. Chairing the Council of the League of Nations in January 1932, he condemned Japan&#x27;s aggression in Manchuria in such vehement terms that he was nicknamed &quot;Don Quijote de la Manchuria&quot;. From 1932 to 1934, he served as ambassador to France. In 1933, he was elected to the National Congress and served as both Minister for Education and Minister for Justice.

In July 1936, as a classical liberal, he went into exile in England to escape the Spanish Civil War. There, he became a vocal opponent of and organised resistance to the Nationalists and to Francisco Franco&#x27;s Spanish State.

In 1947, he was one of the principal authors of the Oxford Manifesto on liberalism. He participated in the Hague Congress in 1948 as president of the Cultural Commission and he was one of the co-founders in 1949 of the College of Europe.

In his writing career, he wrote books and essays about &#x27;Don Quixote&quot;, Christopher Columbus, William Shakespeare&#x27;s &quot;Hamlet&quot;, and the history of Latin America. He sterongly supported a united and integrated Europe. He wrote in French, German, Spanish, Galician (his mother tongue) and English.

In 1973, he won the Charlemagne Prize for his contributions to the European idea and to European peace. In 1976, after Franco&#x27;s death, Madariaga returned to Spain and became a member of the Spanish Royal Academy.

==Personal life and death==

In 1912, Madariaga married Constance Archibald, a Scottish economic historian. The couple had two daughters: Nieves Mathews (1917–2003) and the professor and historian Isabel de Madariaga (1919–2014). Constance died in May 1970. In November 1970, he married Emilia Székely de Rauman, who had been his secretary since 1938 and would die in 1991 at 83.

Madariaga died at 92 on 16 December 1978, in Locarno, Switzerland.

==Awards and recognition==
Madariaga received numerous prizes in his lifetime: including:
* Honorary Member of the Royal Academy of Spain (1936)
* Hansischer Goethe-Preis, University of Hamburg (1972)
* Charlemagne Prize (1973)

==Legacy==
The Madariaga European Foundation has been named after him and promotes his vision of a united Europe and a more peaceful world. The 1979–1980 academic year at the College of Europe was named in his honour.

An Oxfordshire blue plaque in honour of him was unveiled at 3 St Andrew&#x27;s Road, Headington, Oxford, by his daughter Isabel on 15 October 2011.

<doc id="843510" wikidata="Q2580825" url="?curid=843510" title="Public holidays in Greece">
<text>According to Greek law every Sunday of the year is a public holiday. In addition, there are nine mandatory, official public holidays: New Year&#x27;s Day, 6 January, Clean Monday, 25 March,Orthodox Good Friday, Orthodox Easter Monday, 1 May, Orthodox Whit Monday, 15 August, 28 October, 25 December and 26 December. There are, however, more public holidays celebrated in Greece than are announced by the Ministry of Labour each year as mandatory. The list of these &quot;non-fixed&quot; National Holidays rarely changes and has not changed in recent decades, giving a total of twelve National Holidays each year.

A public holiday that occurs on a Sunday is not transferred to another date, with the exception of 1 May, which is regarded by the locals more as a general strike than a public holiday.

In addition to the national holidays, some public holidays that are not celebrated nationwide, but only by a specific professional group or a local community. For example, many municipalities have a &quot;patron Saint&quot; also called &#x27;Name Day&#x27; or a &quot;Liberation Day&quot;, and at this day it is customary for schools to have a day off.

<doc id="843511" wikidata="Q1340493" url="?curid=843511" title="Hard Times (novel)">
<text>Hard Times: For These Times (commonly known as Hard Times) is the tenth novel by English author Charles Dickens, first published in 1854. The book surveys English society and satirises the social and economic conditions of the era.

&quot;Hard Times&quot; is unusual in several ways. It is by far the shortest of Dickens&#x27;s novels, barely a quarter of the length of those written immediately before and after it. Also, unlike all but one of his other novels, &quot;Hard Times&quot; has neither a preface nor illustrations. Moreover, it is his only novel not to have scenes set in London. Instead the story is set in the fictitious Victorian industrial Coketown, a generic Northern English mill-town, in some ways similar to Manchester, though smaller. Coketown may be partially based on 19th-century Preston.

One of Dickens&#x27;s reasons for writing &quot;Hard Times&quot; was that sales of his weekly periodical &quot;Household Words&quot; were low, and it was hoped the novel&#x27;s publication in instalments would boost circulation – as indeed proved to be the case. Since publication it has received a mixed response from critics. Critics such as George Bernard Shaw and Thomas Macaulay have mainly focused on Dickens&#x27;s treatment of trade unions and his post-Industrial Revolution pessimism regarding the divide between capitalist mill owners and undervalued workers during the Victorian era. F. R. Leavis, a great admirer of the book, included it – but not Dickens&#x27;s work as a whole – as part of his Great Tradition of English novels.

==Publication==
The novel was published as a serial in Dickens&#x27;s weekly publication, &quot;Household Words&quot;. Sales were highly responsive and encouraging for Dickens who remarked that he was &quot;Three parts mad, and the fourth delirious, with perpetual rushing at &quot;Hard Times&quot;&quot;. The novel was serialised, in twenty weekly parts, between 1 April and 12 August 1854. It sold well, and a complete volume was published in August, totalling 110,000 words. Another related novel, &quot;North and South&quot; by Elizabeth Gaskell, was also published in this magazine.

==Synopsis==
The novel follows a classical tripartite structure, and the titles of each book are related to Galatians 6:7, &quot;For whatsoever a man soweth, that shall he also reap.&quot; Book I is entitled &quot;Sowing&quot;, Book II is entitled &quot;Reaping&quot;, and the third is &quot;Garnering.&quot;

===Book 1: Sowing===
Superintendent Mr. Gradgrind opens the novel at his school in Coketown stating, &quot;Now, what I want is Facts. Teach these boys and girls nothing but Facts&quot;, and interrogates one of his pupils, Cecilia (nicknamed Sissy), whose father works at a circus. Because her father works with horses, Gradgrind demands the definition of a horse. When she is scolded for her inability to factually define a horse, her classmate Bitzer gives a zoological profile, and Sissy is censured for suggesting that she would carpet a floor with pictures of flowers or horses.

Louisa and Thomas, two of Mr. Gradgrind&#x27;s children, go after school to see the touring circus run by Mr. Sleary, only to meet their father, who orders them home. Mr. Gradgrind has three younger children: Adam Smith (after the famous theorist of laissez-faire policy), Malthus (after Rev. Thomas Malthus, who wrote &quot;An Essay on the Principle of Population&quot;, warning of the dangers of future overpopulation), and Jane.

Josiah Bounderby, &quot;a man perfectly devoid of sentiment&quot;, is revealed as Gradgrind&#x27;s close friend. Bounderby is a manufacturer and mill owner who is affluent as a result of his enterprise and capital. He often gives dramatic and falsified accounts of his childhood.

As they consider her a bad influence on the other children, Gradgrind and Bounderby prepare to dismiss Sissy from the school; but the two soon discover her father has abandoned her thereto, in hope that she will lead a better life without him. Mr. Gradgrind gives Sissy a choice: to return to the circus and its kindly manager, Mr. Sleary, and forfeit her education, or to continue her education and work for Mrs. Gradgrind, never returning to the circus. Sissy accepts the latter, hoping to be reunited with her father. At the Gradgrind house, Tom and Louisa befriend Sissy but they are all discontent with their strict upbringing.

Amongst the mill workers, known as &quot;the Hands&quot;, is a gloomy man named Stephen Blackpool (nicknamed &quot;Old Stephen&quot;): another of the story&#x27;s protagonists. When introduced, he has ended his day&#x27;s work and meets his close friend Rachael. On entering his house he finds that his drunken wife – who has been living away from him – has made an unwelcome return. Stephen is greatly perturbed, and visits Bounderby to ask how he can legally end his marriage and marry Rachael. Mrs. Sparsit, Mr. Bounderby&#x27;s housekeeper, disapproves of Stephen&#x27;s query and Bounderby explains that ending a marriage would be complex and prohibitively costly. When Stephen points out the injustice of this, Bounderby accuses him of having ideas above his station. Leaving the house, Stephen meets an old woman who seems interested in Bounderby and says she visits Coketown once a year. Upon returning, he finds Rachael caring for his wife, and stays until three o&#x27;clock. When Rachael falls asleep, Mrs. Blackpool wakes up and mistakes a bottle of medicine for alcohol. Despite knowing that she will die if she drinks the entire bottle, Stephen does not move to stop her. Rachael wakes and is able to prevent Mrs. Blackpool from poisoning herself, and Stephen, horrified by his lack of action, finds strength and resolve to bear his suffering.

Several years pass. Sissy becomes Gradgrind&#x27;s housekeeper, caring for his younger children. Gradgrind tells Louisa that Josiah Bounderby, 30 years her senior, has proposed marriage to her, and quotes statistics to prove that an age difference does not make a marriage unhappy or short. Louisa passively accepts the offer, and the newlyweds set out to Lyons (Lyon), where Bounderby wants to observe how labour is used in the factories there. Tom, her brother, elatedly bids her farewell.

===Book 2: Reaping===
Book Two opens on Bounderby&#x27;s bank in Coketown, over which the &quot;light porter&quot;, Sissy&#x27;s old classmate Bitzer, and the austere Mrs. Sparsit keep watch at the afternoon. A well-dressed gentleman asks for directions to Bounderby&#x27;s house, as Gradgrind has sent him from London with a letter of introduction. It is James Harthouse, who has tried several occupations and been bored by all of them.

Harthouse is introduced to Bounderby, who accepts him and then regales him with improbable and brief mentions of his childhood. Harthouse is utterly bored by him, but enamoured of the now-melancholy Louisa. Louisa&#x27;s brother Tom works for Bounderby, and has become reckless and wayward in his conduct. Tom admires Harthouse, who holds him in some contempt, and Tom discloses contempt for Bounderby in the presence of Harthouse, who notes Louisa&#x27;s affection for Tom and later learns that Tom has money problems – and that Tom persuaded Louisa to marry Bounderby to make his own life easier.

At a crowded union meeting, the agitator Slackbridge accuses Stephen Blackpool of treachery because he will not join the union, and Stephen learns he is to be &#x27;sent to Coventry&#x27; – shunned by all his fellow workers. Summoned by Bounderby, he is asked what the men are complaining of; and when Stephen tries to explain, Bounderby accuses Stephen of being a troublemaker and sacks him. Later Louisa and Tom visit Stephen, expressing regret, and Louisa gives him some money. Privately, Tom tells him to wait outside the bank after work.

When a robbery takes place at the bank, Stephen is suspected of the crime; even more so as he had left the town the next day. Mrs. Sparsit observes the advancing relationship between James Harthouse and Louisa, and suspects an adulterous liaison. Unable to hear their dialogue, she assumes the affair is progressing. When Harthouse confesses his love for Louisa, Louisa refuses him. They leave separately, and Mrs. Sparsit follows Louisa to the station, where Louisa boards a train to her father&#x27;s house; Mrs Sparsit loses her. When Louisa arrives, she is in an extreme state of distress. Having argued that her rigorous education has stifled her ability to express her emotions, Louisa collapses at her father&#x27;s feet in a dead faint.

===Book 3: Garnering===
At Bounderby&#x27;s London hotel, Mrs. Sparsit gives him the news her surveillance has brought. Bounderby takes her back to Coketown and to Stone Lodge, where Louisa is resting. Gradgrind tells Bounderby that Louisa resisted Harthouse&#x27;s advances, but has experienced a crisis and needs time to recover. Bounderby is immensely indignant and ill-mannered, especially towards Mrs. Sparsit for misleading him. Ignoring Gradgrind&#x27;s pleas, he announces that unless Louisa returns to him the next day, the marriage will end. She does not come back.

Harthouse leaves Coketown after Sissy tells him never to return. As Slackbridge increasingly blackens Stephen Blackpool&#x27;s name, Rachael goes to the bank to say she knows where he is, and that she will write asking him to return to Coketown to clear his name. Bounderby is suspicious when she tells him Stephen was visited by Louisa and Tom the night he was dismissed, and brings her to Gradgrind&#x27;s house where Louisa confirms Rachael&#x27;s account.

Mrs Sparsit eventually tracks down Mrs Pegler, the old woman who makes a mysterious annual visit to see Bounderby&#x27;s house, and brings her to the house where she is revealed as Bounderby&#x27;s mother. Far from having abandoned him to a life of hardship, she gave him a good upbringing and, when he became successful, allowed herself to be persuaded never to visit him. Bounderby is now publicly exposed as a ridiculous humbug &#x27;bully of humility&#x27;.

On a Sunday outing, Rachael and Sissy find Stephen, who has fallen down an abandoned pit shaft while walking back to Coketown. He is rescued by villagers but, after professing his innocence and speaking to Rachael for the last time, he dies. Louisa and Sissy now suspect that Tom has committed the bank robbery, and simply told Stephen to loiter outside the bank in order to incriminate him. Sissy has already helped Tom escape by sending him to join Mr. Sleary&#x27;s circus. Louisa and Sissy find Tom there, disguised in blackface. Gradgrind arrives and despairs, and a plan is hatched with Sleary&#x27;s co-operation to get Tom to Liverpool, where he can escape abroad. The plan is temporarily foiled by the arrival of Bitzer, who hopes to obtain promotion from Bounderby by bringing Tom to justice, but Sleary arranges an ambush and Tom is taken to Liverpool where he boards ship.

Bounderby punishes Mrs Sparsit for his humiliation by turning her out, but she doesn&#x27;t particularly mind the dishonour. Five years later, he will die of a fit in the street, while Mr. Gradgrind, having abandoned his Utilitarian ideas and trying to make Facts &quot;subservient to Faith, Hope and Charity&quot;, will suffer the contempt of his fellow MPs. Rachael will continue her life of honest hard work, while Stephen Blackpool will be pardoned by Mr Gradgrind. Tom will die from fever fairly near Coketown, having expressed penitence in a tear-stained letter. Louisa herself will grow old, but will never remarry and have children of her own. Louisa, showing kindness to the less fortunate and being loved by Sissy&#x27;s children, will spend her life encouraging imagination and fancy in all she encounters.

==Characters==

===Mr. Gradgrind===
Thomas Gradgrind is the notorious school board Superintendent, who is dedicated to the pursuit of profitable enterprise. His name is now used generically to refer to someone who is hard and only concerned with cold facts and numbers, a follower of Utilitarian ideas who neglects the imagination. He soon sees the error of these beliefs however, when his children&#x27;s lives fall into disarray.

===Mr. Bounderby===
Josiah Bounderby is a business associate of Mr. Gradgrind. Given to boasting about being a self-made man, he employs many of the other central characters of the novel. He has risen to a position of power and wealth from humble origins (though not as humble as he claims). He marries Mr. Gradgrind&#x27;s daughter Louisa, some 30 years his junior, in what turns out to be a loveless marriage. They have no children. Bounderby is callous, self-centred and ultimately revealed to be a liar and fraud.

===Louisa ===
Louisa (Loo) Gradgrind, (later Louisa Bounderby), is the eldest child of the Gradgrind family. She has been taught to suppress her feelings and finds it hard to express herself clearly, saying as a child that she has &quot;unmanageable thoughts.&quot; After her unhappy marriage, she is tempted to adultery by James Harthouse, but resists him and returns to her father. Her rejection of Harthouse leads to a new understanding of life and of the value of emotions and the imagination. She reproaches her father for his dry and fact-based approach to the world and convinces him of the error of his ways.

===Sissy Jupe===
Cecilia (Sissy) Jupe is a circus girl of Sleary&#x27;s circus, as well as a student of Gradgrind&#x27;s. Sissy has her own set of values and beliefs which make her seem unintelligent in the Gradgrind household. At the end of the novel, when the Gradgrinds&#x27; philosophy of religiously adhering solely to facts breaks down, Sissy is the character who teaches them how to live.

She struggles to keep up with Gradgrind&#x27;s extreme reliance on the recitation of facts, and therefore is seen as not worthy of the school. Sissy is also representative of creativity and wonderment because of her circus background, and those were things that the Gradgrind children were not allowed to engage in. With the urging of Josiah Bounderby, Mr. Gradgrind goes to inform Sissy&#x27;s father that she can no longer attend his school.

While Sissy and her father were very close once, Mr. Jupe abandoned his daughter. In a moment of compassion, Mr. Gradgrind takes Sissy into his home and gives her a second chance at the school. Sissy continues to fall behind in the school, so Mr. Gradgrind keeps her at home to tend to his invalid wife.

While Sissy is the device of imagination and fantasy in the novel, she also serves as the voice of reason. She cannot grasp the philosophy of Gradgrind&#x27;s classroom because she has a more realistic view of how the world should be perceived. After Louisa and Mr. Gradgrind come to terms with the fact that their way of life is not working, Sissy is the one they come to; she takes care of Louisa and helps her live a new, happy life.

===Tom===
Thomas (Tom) Gradgrind, Junior is the oldest son and second child of the Gradgrinds. Initially sullen and resentful of his father&#x27;s Utilitarian education, Tom has a strong relationship with his sister Louisa. He works in Bounderby&#x27;s bank (which he later robs), and turns to gambling and drinking. Louisa never ceases to adore Tom, and she aids Sissy and Mr. Gradgrind in saving her brother from arrest.

===Stephen Blackpool===
Stephen Blackpool is a worker at one of Bounderby&#x27;s mills. He has a drunken wife who no longer lives with him but who appears from time to time. He forms a close bond with Rachael, a co-worker, whom he wishes to marry. After a dispute with Bounderby, he is dismissed from his work at the Coketown mills and, shunned by his former fellow workers, is forced to look for work elsewhere. While absent from Coketown, he is wrongly accused of robbing Bounderby&#x27;s bank. On his way back to vindicate himself, he falls down a mine-shaft. He is rescued but dies of his injuries.

===Other characters===
*Bitzer – a very pale classmate of Sissy&#x27;s who is brought up on facts and taught to operate according to self-interest. He takes up a job in Bounderby&#x27;s bank, and later tries to arrest Tom.
*Rachael – the friend of Stephen Blackpool who attests to his innocence when he is accused of robbing Bounderby&#x27;s bank by Tom. She is a factory worker, childhood friend of Blackpool&#x27;s drunken and often absent wife, and becomes the literary tool for bringing the two parallel story lines together at the brink of Hell&#x27;s Shaft in the final book.
*Mrs. Sparsit – a widow who has fallen on hard times. She is employed by Bounderby, and is jealous when he marries Louisa, delighting in the belief that Louisa is later about to elope with James Harthouse. Her machinations are unsuccessful and she is ultimately sacked by Bounderby.
*James Harthouse – an indolent, languid, upper-class gentleman, who attempts to woo Louisa.
*Mrs. Gradgrind – the wife of Mr. Gradgrind, an invalid who constantly complains. Tom Sr.&#x27;s apparent attraction to her is because she totally lacks &#x27;fancy&#x27;, though she also appears to be unintelligent and without empathy for her children.
*Mr. Sleary – the owner of the circus which employs Sissy&#x27;s father. He speaks with a lisp. A kind man, he helps both Sissy and young Tom when they are in trouble.
*Mrs. Pegler – an old woman who sometimes visits Coketown to observe the Bounderby estate. She is later revealed to be Bounderby&#x27;s mother, proving his &quot;rags-to-riches&quot; story to be fraudulent.
*Jane Gradgrind – a younger sister of Tom and Louisa Gradgrind who spends a lot of time with Sissy Jupe. She is cheerful, affectionate and despite looking similar to Louisa, in personality she is opposite.

==Major themes==

Dickens wished to educate readers about the working conditions of some of the factories in the industrial towns of Manchester, and Preston, to &quot;strike the heaviest blow in my power&quot;, and as well to confront the assumption that prosperity runs parallel to morality. This notion he systematically deconstructed through his portrayal of the moral monsters, Mr. Bounderby and James Harthouse. Dickens also believed in the importance of the imagination, and that people&#x27;s lives should not be reduced to a collection of material facts and statistics. The description of the circus, which he describes as caring so &quot;little for Plain Fact&quot;, is an example of this.

===Utilitarianism===

The Utilitarians were one of the targets of Dickens&#x27;s satire. Utilitarianism was a prevalent school of thought during this period, its founders being Jeremy Bentham and James Mill, father to political theorist John Stuart Mill. 
Bentham&#x27;s former secretary, Edwin Chadwick, helped design the Poor Law of 1834, which deliberately made workhouse life as uncomfortable as possible. In the novel, this attitude is conveyed in Bitzer&#x27;s response to Gradgrind&#x27;s appeal for compassion.

Dickens was appalled by what he saw as a selfish philosophy, which was combined with materialist &quot;laissez-faire&quot; capitalism in the education of some children at the time, as well as in industrial practices. In Dickens&#x27;s interpretation, the prevalence of utilitarian values in educational institutions promoted contempt between mill owners and workers, creating young adults whose imaginations had been neglected, due to an over-emphasis on facts at the expense of more imaginative pursuits.

Dickens wished to satirise radical Utilitarians whom he described in a letter to Charles Knight as &quot;see[ing] figures and averages, and nothing else.&quot; He also wished to campaign for reform of working conditions. Dickens had visited factories in Manchester as early as 1839, and was appalled by the environment in which workers toiled. Drawing upon his own childhood experiences, Dickens resolved to &quot;strike the heaviest blow in my power&quot; for those who laboured in horrific conditions.

John Stuart Mill had a similar, rigorous education to that of Louisa Gradgrind, consisting of analytical, logical, mathematical, and statistical exercises. In his twenties, Mill had a nervous breakdown, believing his capacity for emotion had been enervated by his father&#x27;s stringent emphasis on analysis and mathematics in his education. In the book, Louisa herself follows a parallel course, being unable to express herself and falling into a temporary depression as a result of her dry education.

===Fact vs. Fancy===
The bastion of fact is the eminently practical Mr. Gradgrind, and his model school, which teaches nothing but &quot;Facts&quot;. Any imaginative or aesthetic subjects are absent from the curriculum, and analysis, deduction and mathematics are emphasised. Fancy, the opposite of Fact, is epitomised by Sleary&#x27;s circus. Sleary is reckoned a fool by Gradgrind and Bounderby, but it is Sleary who understands that people must be amused. Sissy, the circus performer&#x27;s daughter, does badly at school, failing to remember the many facts she is taught, but is genuinely virtuous and fulfilled. Gradgrind&#x27;s own son Tom revolts against his upbringing, and becomes a gambler and a thief, while Louisa becomes emotionally stunted, virtually soulless both as a young child and as an unhappily married woman. Bitzer, who adheres to Gradgrind&#x27;s teachings, becomes an uncompassionate egotist.

===Officiousness and spying===
Mr. Bounderby spends his whole time fabricating stories about his childhood, covering up the real nature of his upbringing, which is revealed at the end of the novel. While not a snooper himself, he is undone by Sparsit unwittingly revealing the mysterious old woman to be his own mother, and she unravels Josiah&#x27;s secrets about his upbringing and fictitious stories. Mr. Bounderby himself superintends through calculating tabular statements and statistics, and is always secretly rebuking the people of Coketown for indulging in conceitful activities. This gives Bounderby a sense of superiority, as it does with Mrs. Sparsit, who prides herself on her salacious knowledge gained from spying on others. Bounderby&#x27;s grasp for superiority is seen in Blackpool&#x27;s talks to Bounderby regarding divorce proceedings and a union movement at his factory, accusing him that he is on a quest &#x27;to feast on turtle soup and venison, served with a golden spoon.&#x27; All &quot;superintendents&quot; of the novel are undone in one way or another.

===Morality===
Dickens portrays the wealthy in this novel as being morally corrupt. Bounderby has no moral scruples, and, for example, fires Blackpool &quot;for a novelty&quot;. He also conducts himself without any shred of decency, frequently losing his temper. He is cynically false about his childhood. Harthouse, a leisured gent, is compared to an &quot;iceberg&quot; who will cause a wreck unwittingly, due to him being &quot;not a moral sort of fellow&quot;, as he states himself. Stephen Blackpool, a destitute worker, is equipped with perfect morals, always abiding by his promises, and always thoughtful and considerate of others, as is Sissy Jupe.

====The role of status on morality====
Dickens is also concerned, throughout &quot;Hard Times&quot;, with the effects of social class on the morality of individuals. Some contrasting characters relating to this theme are Stephen and Rachael, and Tom and Mr. Bounderby. Stephen&#x27;s honesty and Rachael&#x27;s caring actions are qualities not shown in people from higher classes, but among hard working individuals who are browbeaten by the uncaring factory owners such as Bounderby. These qualities appear repeatedly, as Stephen works hard every day, until he decides to leave town to save the names of his fellow workers, and Rachael supports Stephen through this, while struggling to provide for herself as well. In contrast to these behaviours, Mr. Bounderby refuses to recognise the difficulties faced by those in lower classes, as seen by him completely casting aside Stephen&#x27;s request for help. Other aristocratic characters simply carry out blatantly immoral actions, such as Tom throwing away his sister&#x27;s money, falling into debt, then robbing a bank, and even framing someone else for his actions. Tom is also seen to be deceitful as he is able to keep his guilt hidden until the evidence points only toward him. On the contrary, when the news comes out that Stephen had robbed the bank, Stephen begins to head back to Coketown to face his problems and clear his name. Overall, the stark difference in morality between characters of dissimilar social status suggests Dickens&#x27;s idea that there is a form of innate natural law that may remain unhampered in those leading less titled lives. Stephen&#x27;s concept of right and wrong is untainted by the manufactured values of utilitarianism, instilled into Tom and Bounderby.

==Literary significance and criticism==

Critics have had diverse opinions on the novel. John Ruskin declared &quot;Hard Times&quot; to be his favourite Dickens work due to its exploration of important social questions. However, Thomas Macaulay branded it &quot;sullen socialism&quot;, on the grounds that Dickens did not fully comprehend the politics of the time. Edwin Percy Whipple criticized the novel in Scribner&#x27;s Magazine by saying, &quot;&#x27;Hard Times&#x27; is a satire on political economy, of which Dickens knew little, and the little he did know offended his benevolent feelings...&quot; as he believed Dickens&#x27; criticisms of a utilitarian education were misguided. George Bernard Shaw argued &quot;Hard Times&quot; to be a novel of &quot;passionate revolt against the whole industrial order of the modern world&quot;. But he criticized the novel for failing to provide an accurate account of trade unionism of the time, arguing that Slackbridge, the poisonous orator, was &quot;a mere figment of middle-class imagination&quot;. Believing that it was very different from Dickens&#x27;s other novels, Shaw also said: &quot;Many readers find the change disappointing. Others find Dickens worth reading almost for the first time.&quot;

F. R. Leavis, in &quot;The Great Tradition&quot;, described the book as essentially a moral fable, and that &#x27;of all Dickens&#x27;s works (it is) the one that has all the strengths of his genius – that of a completely serious work of art&#x27;. This, however, was a view which he later revised in &quot;Dickens the Novelist&quot;, which recognised that Dickens&#x27;s strengths and artistry appeared fully in other works.

Walter Allen characterised &quot;Hard Times&quot; as being an unsurpassed &quot;critique of industrial society&quot;, which was later superseded by works of D. H. Lawrence. G. K. Chesterton said that it was &quot;the harshest of his stories&quot;; whereas George Orwell praised the novel (and Dickens himself) for &quot;generous anger&quot;.

==Adaptations==
The novel was adapted as a 1915 silent film, &quot;Hard Times&quot;, directed by Thomas Bentley.

In 1988 Portuguese director João Botelho adapted the novel to the big screen in &quot;Hard Times&quot; (shot entirely in black &amp; white) transferring the action to an unspecified industrial Portuguese city of the 1980s.

&quot;Hard Times&quot; has been adapted three times for BBC Radio. The first version, in 1998, starred John Woodvine as Gradgrind, Tom Baker as Josiah Bounderby and Anna Massey as Mrs. Sparsit. The second, in 2003, starred Kenneth Cranham as Gradgrind, Philip Jackson as Bounderby, Alan Williams as Stephen, Becky Hindley as Rachael, Helen Longworth as Louisa, Nick Roud as Tom and Eleanor Bron as Mrs. Sparsit. A new adaptation, first broadcast on Radio 4 in September 2024, starred David Morrissey as Gradgrind, Shaun Dooley as Bounderby, Arthur Hughes as Stephen and Jan Ravens as Mrs. Sparsit.

In the theatre, &quot;Hard Times&quot; was adapted for the stage by Stephen Jeffreys and presented in 1988 as a four actor play at the Ensemble Theatre, directed by Mike O&#x27;Brien. It was later adapted for the stage by Michael O&#x27;Brien and directed by Marti Maraden at Canada&#x27;s National Arts Centre in 2000. In 2018 Northern Broadsides toured an adaptation written by Deb McAndrew and directed by Conrad Nelson.

The novel has also been adapted twice as a mini-series for British television, once in 1977 by ITV with Patrick Allen as Gradgrind, Timothy West as Bounderby, Rosalie Crutchley as Mrs. Sparsit and Edward Fox as Harthouse, and again in 1994 by the BBC with Bob Peck as Gradgrind, Alan Bates as Bounderby, Dilys Laye as Mrs. Sparsit, Bill Paterson as Stephen, Harriet Walter as Rachael and Richard E. Grant as Harthouse.

<doc id="843516" wikidata="Q650867" url="?curid=843516" title="Madhouse, Inc.">
<text>is a Japanese animation studio founded in 1972 by ex–Mushi Pro staff, including Masao Maruyama, Osamu Dezaki, and Yoshiaki Kawajiri.

Madhouse has created and helped to produce many well-known shows, OVAs and films, starting with TV anime series &quot;Ace o Nerae!&quot; (produced by Tokyo Movie Shinsha) in 1973, and including &quot;Wicked City&quot;, &quot;Ninja Scroll&quot;, &quot;Perfect Blue&quot;, &quot;Vampire Hunter D: Bloodlust&quot;, &quot;Trigun&quot;, &quot;Di Gi Charat&quot;, &quot;Black Lagoon&quot;, &quot;Death Note&quot;, &quot;Paprika&quot;, &quot;Wolf Children, Parasyte: The Maxim&quot;, the first season of &quot;One-Punch Man&quot;, the second adaptation of &quot;Hunter × Hunter&quot;, &quot;Overlord&quot;, and &quot;Frieren: Beyond Journey&#x27;s End&quot;. Unlike other studios founded at this time such as AIC and J.C.Staff, their strength was and is primarily in TV shows and theatrical features. Expanding from the initial Mushi Pro staff, Madhouse recruited important directors such as Morio Asaka, Masayuki Kojima, and Satoshi Kon during the 1990s. Their staff roster expanded in the 2000s to include Mamoru Hosoda, Takeshi Koike, and Mitsuo Iso, as well as many younger television directors.

The studio often collaborates with known manga artists, including Naoki Urasawa and Clamp. Madhouse produced adaptations of Urasawa&#x27;s &quot;Yawara!&quot;, &quot;Master Keaton&quot;, and &quot;Monster&quot;, with Masayuki Kojima helming the latter two. The company has animated a number of CLAMP&#x27;s titles, including &quot;Tokyo Babylon&quot;, two versions of &quot;X&quot; (a theatrical movie and a TV series), &quot;Cardcaptor Sakura&quot; and its sequel &quot;Clear Card&quot;, and &quot;Chobits&quot;.

==History==
Madhouse was established in 1972 by ex–Mushi Production animators, including Masao Maruyama, Osamu Dezaki, and Yoshiaki Kawajiri, with funding from Yutaka Fujioka, the founder of Tokyo Movie, and co-produced its earliest series with Tokyo Movie. In February 2004, Madhouse became a subsidiary of Index Corporation. On February 8, 2011, Nippon TV became Madhouse&#x27;s primary stockholder (replacing Index Corporation), via a third-party allocation of new shares. NTV bought 128,667 new shares (each ¥7,772) issued by Madhouse for ¥999,999,924 total (about $12.4 million), raising its stake in the company from 10.4% to 84.5%. Index Corporation&#x27;s stake in Madhouse fell from 60.91% to 10.54%. In January 2012, Madhouse announced their acquisition of the animation rights to the &quot;Peanuts&quot; comic strip. In March 2014, NTV bought all the shares belonging to Index Corporation, increasing its stake in Madhouse to 95%.

===Film===
Madhouse&#x27;s early theatrical work included assistance on the &quot;Barefoot Gen&quot; films, and &quot;&quot;, an anime movie based on the space opera series by pulp science fiction author E.E. &quot;Doc&quot; Smith.

In the late 1980s and early 1990s, director Yoshiaki Kawajiri produced a string of action films including &quot;Wicked City&quot;, &quot;Demon City Shinjuku&quot;, and &quot;Ninja Scroll&quot;.

In the late 1990s, the studio aimed at a younger female audience with Morio Asaka&#x27;s two &quot;Cardcaptor Sakura&quot; films, based on the popular television series.

In the early 2000s, an ambitious collaboration with Tezuka Productions resulted in &quot;Metropolis&quot;, directed by Rintaro and adapted from the manga by Osamu Tezuka. Earlier collaborations with Tezuka productions included two feature-length films made for Sanrio starring Tezuka&#x27;s unicorn character Unico.

Director Satoshi Kon produced all four of his films with the studio: &quot;Perfect Blue&quot;, &quot;Millennium Actress&quot;, &quot;Tokyo Godfathers&quot;, and &quot;Paprika&quot;, as well as his TV series &quot;Paranoia Agent&quot;. Kon was also making his fifth film the &quot;Dreaming Machine&quot; with Madhouse, although it was left incomplete at his death in 2010.

In 2003, Madhouse produced &quot;&quot;, which was adapted from the seinen manga &quot;Nasu&quot; by Iou Kuroda and directed by Studio Ghibli veteran Kitarō Kōsaka. &quot;Nasu&quot; was the first Japanese animated film ever selected for screening at the Cannes Film Festival. Kōsaka followed up his film with an OVA sequel in 2007.

In 2006, director Mamoru Hosoda began his career with the studio by directing &quot;The Girl Who Leapt Through Time&quot;.

Recent productions included Masayuki Kojima&#x27;s theatrical debut &quot;Forest of Piano&quot; (2007), Hosoda&#x27;s acclaimed &quot;Summer Wars&quot; (2009), Sunao Katabuchi&#x27;s &quot;Mai Mai Miracle&quot; (2009), the company&#x27;s first CG animated film, &quot;Yona Yona Penguin&quot; (2009), Takeshi Koike&#x27;s feature film debut &quot;Redline&quot; (2009), a theatrical version of the &quot;Trigun&quot; series, &quot;&quot; (2010), and &quot;The Tibetan Dog&quot;, a co-production with China (2011).

The first film in the &quot;Hunter × Hunter&quot; franchise, &quot;Hunter × Hunter: Phantom Rouge&quot; premiered on January 12, 2013.

After producing and animating Mamoru Hosoda&#x27;s &quot;The Girl Who Leapt Through Time&quot; and &quot;Summer Wars&quot;, Madhouse co-produced &quot;Wolf Children&quot; (2012) with Hosoda&#x27;s newly-founded Studio Chizu.

Collectively, Madhouse films have won a total of two Japan Academy Prizes, four Grand Prizes in the Animation Division at Japan Media Arts Festival, two Gertie Awards, six Mainichi Film Awards (three Ōfuji Noburō Awards, and three Animation Grand Awards), two Tokyo Anime Awards for Animation of the Year, and five Animation Kobe Feature Film Awards.

==Collaborations==
Madhouse designed the characters for Hudson Soft&#x27;s game &quot;Virus&quot; (the first installment of the &quot;Virus Buster Serge&quot; franchise). Madhouse worked with Square Enix on the OVA &quot;Last Order: Final Fantasy VII&quot; as well as Capcom for the mini series of &quot;Devil May Cry: The Animated Series&quot;.

They collaborated with Studio Ghibli by contributing key animation assistance to Hayao Miyazaki&#x27;s &quot;My Neighbor Totoro&quot; (1988), &quot;Spirited Away&quot; (2001), &quot;Howl&#x27;s Moving Castle&quot; (2004), and &quot;The Secret World of Arrietty&quot; (2010), as well as Tomomi Mochizuki&#x27;s &quot;I Can Hear the Sea&quot; (1993) and Goro Miyazaki&#x27;s &quot;Tales from Earthsea&quot; (2006).

Madhouse also collaborated with Disney for the anime &quot;Stitch!&quot; for its first and second arcs (equal to 56 episodes total), between 2008 and 2010. They also animated the intro cutscene to PlayStation video game &quot;Wild Arms&quot; and the opening movie to PlayStation Vita video game &quot;Persona 4 Golden&quot; (&quot;Persona 4: The Golden&quot; in Japan), along with opening to the PSP remake of &quot;Persona 2: Eternal Punishment&quot;.

Madhouse collaborated with professional rapper Snoop Dogg in the 2006 horror-comedy anthology movie &quot;Hood of Horror&quot;, in which they assisted in the animated sections of the movie. They also worked with the Wachowskis and other famed Japanese animators and studios to create &quot;The Animatrix&quot;, an animated anthology adaptation of the &quot;Matrix&quot; franchise; Madhouse particularly worked on its short films &quot;Program&quot; and &quot;World Record.&quot;

In 2010 to 2014, Madhouse collaborated with Marvel Entertainment and Sony Pictures to create adaptations of &quot;Blade&quot;, &quot;Iron Man&quot;, &quot;Wolverine&quot;, &quot;X-Men&quot;, &quot;Black Widow&quot;, and &quot;Punisher&quot;, and then in 2017, collaborated again with Marvel Entertainment, Disney+, and Walt Disney Japan to create an adaptation of the &quot;Avengers&quot;. Conversely, they worked with Marvel&#x27;s rival company, DC Entertainment, Warner Premiere, and Warner Brothers to create of &quot;Batman&quot;. Madhouse had also worked with Warner Brothers and Sony on separate occasions to create adaptations of &quot;Ultraviolet&quot; and &quot;Supernatural&quot;. Additionally, they were commissioned by Top Cow Productions, an imprint of Image Comics, to provide an anime adaptation of Aphrodite IX. However, the project was suddenly canceled without any explanation.

2010 also saw the publication of &quot;Devil&quot;, a manga intended specifically for the American market; the property is a collaboration with Dark Horse Comics, and is written and drawn by Torajiro Kishi.

Madhouse also participated in animating the &quot;Wakfu&quot; TV special &quot;Ogrest, la légende&quot; in collaboration with Ankama Japan.

<text>The University Bridge is a double-leaf bascule bridge in Seattle, Washington that carries Eastlake Avenue traffic over Portage Bay between Eastlake to the south and the University District to the north. It opened on July 1, 1919, and was extensively rebuilt from 1932 to 1933. It is included in the National Register of Historic Places.

==History==
The bridge opened in 1919 under the name of &quot;Eastlake Avenue Bridge&quot; (also then known as the &quot;Tenth Avenue Northeast Bridge&quot;). It got its current and proper name on June 30, 1919.

By 1930, the bridge had begun to deteriorate enough for an extensive refit to be ordered: the timber trestle approaches were replaced with ones made out of concrete and steel, the control towers were rebuilt, and the wooden paving was replaced by the first application of open steel-mesh grating in the United States. Wooden paving had to be replaced every ten years or so; the steel-mesh grating has been replaced once, in 1990. The reconstructed bridge was opened April 7, 1933.

Originally, and until 1940, the bridge was crossed by streetcars of the Seattle Municipal Street Railway. From 1940 to 1963 and again since 1981, trolleybuses of the Seattle trolleybus system have used the bridge. Since 1984 (with the closure of the 1911 Cambie Street Bridge in Vancouver, Canada), the University Bridge and Seattle&#x27;s Montlake Bridge have been the only movable bridges in the Western Hemisphere still crossed by trolleybuses. (The two trolleybus routes currently using the University Bridge are King County Metro routes 49 and 70.)

The University Bridge is one of four double-leaf bascule bridges spanning the Lake Washington Ship Canal that were collectively added to the National Register of Historic Places in 1982, the others being the Ballard Bridge, the Fremont Bridge, and the Montlake Bridge.

In 2014, its electronic controls were replaced after several components had worn out and caused multi-hour delays to lift and lower the bridge. During especially hot summer days, the University Bridge needs daily dousings with cool water to avoid expanding so much that they bind.

==Sinkhole==
On May 2, 2007, a water main broke near the south end of the University Bridge, creating a sinkhole forcing the closure of the bridge. The sinkhole also swallowed two unoccupied parked cars. The water main break compromised water quality and pressure in a large part of the Eastlake neighborhood, making tap water brown and unpotable. Many restaurants and other businesses were forced to close. There was concern for the integrity of a 40-inch main adjacent to the smaller one that broke. With the bridge closed, surface traffic between Seattle&#x27;s University District and Downtown areas was heavily impacted. It was reopened on May 3, 2007, after city workers poured about 40 cubic yards of stabilizing concrete-sand slurry around the southern base of the bridge.

==Occupy Seattle==
On November 17, 2011, the University Bridge was shut down by demonstrators for about an hour and a half during the evening rush hour, snarling traffic around the University District. The demonstrators included Occupy Seattle protesters, students, union workers, and church leaders. The protests were part of a national Day of Action against cuts to infrastructure, health care, and education spending.

<doc id="843519" wikidata="Q1186720" url="?curid=843519" title="Den (comics)">
<text>Den is the name of two identical sword and planet fictional characters created by Richard Corben. The first appeared in the 1968 animated short film &quot;Neverwhere&quot;. The second has been appearing in comics since 1973, and in short stories that have been collected for the most part in trade paperbacks.

The second Den also appeared in the animated film &quot;Heavy Metal&quot; voiced by John Candy.

==Publication history==
Corben created Den as the protagonist of a film short titled &quot;Neverwhere&quot; while working at Calvin Studios, an animation company in Kansas City. The film is animated, with framing sequences filmed in live-action. Corben&#x27;s boss at Calvin played the title character in the movie. He drew the whole animated sequence by hand in his spare time. His employers, impressed by his work, helped him to finish it by editing it and adding a new professional soundtrack with actors&#x27; voices. It was submitted to film festivals and won several awards, including the CINE Golden Eagle Award. The story continued in comic form from then on. Den made his comic debut in a short comic book story that appeared in &quot;Grim Wit&quot; No.2 in September 1973. Corben expanded this short story to two parts for publication in &quot;Métal Hurlant&quot; (1975–1976). He continued the story, turning it into a 12-part serial called &quot;Den&quot;, for the first twelve issues of &quot;Heavy Metal&quot; magazine (1977–1978). He added an epilogue, &quot;Den&#x27;s Farewell&quot;, which was printed in issue No.13 (April 1978). The original story, without the epilogue, was published in the trade paperback &quot;Neverwhere&quot; (Ariel: Feb. 1978). All 13 chapters featured in the trade paperback &quot;Den: Neverwhere&quot; (Catalan: 1984).

Corben returned to &quot;Heavy Metal&quot; with a 13-part Den sequel, which ran in issues No.54 through No.72 (1981–1983). These stories were collected in the trade paperback &quot;Den 2: Muvovum&quot; (Catalan: 1984), which appeared around the same time as the complete first edition, &quot;Den: Neverwhere&quot;.
Corben began self-publishing Den through his company Fantagor Press in the 1980s, beginning with &quot;Children of Fire&quot; (1987) which was later revealed to be the prequel to the &quot;Heavy Metal&quot;-era Den adventures. Corben followed this with an ongoing Den series, which did not have the full frontal nudity that was the hallmark of the original &quot;Heavy Metal&quot; strips. Corben went back to the adult content with &quot;Den Saga&quot;, which filled in some of the details between &quot;Children of Fire&quot; and &quot;Neverwhere&quot; and &quot;Muvovum&quot;.

==Appearances==
The short film &quot;Neverwhere&quot; (1968) was followed by short stories in the following publications:
* Fantagor No.4 (1972) – &quot;For the Love of a Daemon&quot;
* Grim Wit No.2 (1973) – &quot;Den&quot;
* Heavy Metal No.1-13 (April 1977 thru April 1978) – collected in &quot;Den 1: Neverwhere&quot;

* DenSaga No.1-4 (1992–1994) (not collected in English)
* Penthouse Comix No.15-20 (1996–1997) – &quot;Denz&quot; (not collected)

They have been collected in the following &quot;Den&quot; trade paperbacks:

==Fictional character biography==

&quot;Den&quot; is the name of two characters: the hero featured in the short film &quot;Neverwhere&quot;; and the identical hero featured in all the subsequent comics.

===First version===
The first Den story, as told in the short film &quot;Neverwhere&quot;, is clearly inspired by the Edgar Rice Burroughs John Carter of Mars novels. In the beginning of the film, an office worker is shown reading the 1963 reprint of &quot;A Princess of Mars&quot;, before he is turned down for a date by a coworker and quits his job. He then builds a machine that opens a portal where a &quot;deposed queen&quot; beckons him to enter another world. Turning into a muscleman he fights several monsters, including four armed monsters reminiscent of Burroughs’ Green Martians. Den is then sent on a mission by the Queen to retrieve the Locnar and, after succeeding, returns home to his mundane life.

===Second version===
In its comic-book sequel, Den is a young man named David Ellis Norman. Following directions left for him on a note and a diagram from his missing uncle Dan, David builds another electronic apparatus. The apparatus opens a gateway to a fantasy world named &quot;Neverwhere&quot;, where he was transformed into a hairless, nude, muscular, and prodigiously endowed adventurer. Confused by his strange trip, he can only remember the acronym of his real name (DEN), and begins calling himself &quot;Den&quot;. In his Earth incarnation, David had found a letter in one of the fantasy novels by Edgar Rice Burroughs left to him by his uncle Dan. Some images from the &quot;Neverwhere&quot; film are recreated in the first volume of Den as flashbacks.

Shortly after his arrival he meets an evil nude masked woman, known as the Red Queen (perhaps a reference to the character in &quot;Through the Looking-Glass&quot;) who seems to know Den and is about to sacrifice her doppelgänger Kath to Uhluhtc. After being rescued by Den, Kath reveals to him that, on Earth, she is a frail novelist called Katherine Wells (a reference to H. G. Wells, whose second wife was named Catherine). Kath is a native of London who, in 1892, was drawn to Neverwhere when she found another doorway after following the will o&#x27; the wisp while wandering through some marshes. Like Den, she was transformed when she arrived to Neverwhere, in her case into a voluptuous, large breasted nude woman who was immediately captured by the Red Queen (who had created the portal to bring her to Neverwhere). Kath has a much better recollection of her former life than Den, but doesn&#x27;t wish to return because she feels she is not only healthier but &quot;more of a woman&quot; in the new land. Like Den, she is completely nude and hairless except for her blond bob hairstyle.

According to Jan Strnad&#x27;s introduction to &quot;Denz&quot;, &quot;The saga of Den&#x27;s exploits... lusty and brawling, brimming with magic, intrigue, horror and betrayal... spanned generations and filled many exotic volumes. Now in his declining years, Den lives in a NeverWhere far different from the one he entered. Thanks to his magical Locnar, Den has brought peace and prosperity to his adoptive world. Meanwhile, on Earth, Denzel Easton Norman seeks to follow in his brother&#x27;s footsteps...&quot;

==Characters==

The identification of the main characters of the series is complicated because they often change their name, drastically change morphologies, have identical doubles (also both Dens have the same name), and either forget, or do not acknowledge, previous encounters. Most problematically they also radically change personalities and relationships between the chapters in the story. An extreme case is Kil, who is consecutively portrayed as a noble sexless warrior, a maternal caretaker of an embryo, a lustful lover, a deposed queen with magical powers, an evil witch who engages in human sacrifice, a ruthless tyrant who burns down a city, a fraudulent heroic adventurer, etc. According to Corben, this is due to Kil&#x27;s psychotic schizophrenia.

The protagonists are basically two identical men — Den (the first) and Den (the second) — and two identical women — Kil and Kath. They are all known by several other aliases:
* Den (first) a.k.a. Mal, Uncle Dan, Daniel Norman. First appeared in &quot;Neverwhere the Movie&quot;.
* Den (second) a.k.a. David Ellis Norman, Dav. First appeared in &quot;Grim Wit&quot; No.2.
* Kil a.k.a. the Queen, the Red Queen. First appeared (as the Queen) in &quot;Neverwhere the Movie&quot;.
* Kath a.k.a. Katherine Wells. First appeared in &quot;Heavy Metal&quot; No.4.

The main secondary recurring characters are:
* Zeg, an evil wizard/warlord. Father of Scon. First appeared in &quot;Heavy Metal&quot; No.13.
* Zomuk, Zeg&#x27;s demon slave. First appeared in &quot;Fantagor&quot; No.4.
* Pucca, Zeg&#x27;s slave cook. Mate of Mal. First appeared in &quot;Children of Fire&quot; No.2.
* Gel, the simian humanoid leader of a revolt against the Red Queen. First appeared in &quot;Neverwhere the Movie&quot;.
* Scon, son of Zeg, also a wizard/warlord. First appeared in &quot;Heavy Metal&quot; No.55.
* Sienna, an Indian girl with mental powers. She has a giant lizard named Pthalo. First appeared in &quot;Grim Wit&quot; No.2.
* Zandor and Wyn, blue humanoid father and daughter. First appeared in &quot;Heavy Metal&quot; No.65.
* Queen Ryllia, the human/fish hybrid queen of Ichthya, an underwater city. First appeared in &quot;Den&quot; No.5.

==Chronology of the stories==

Den&#x27;s adventures follow a complex and sometimes contradictory course of events. Some of the chapters of the story have been told in extended flashbacks, dreams, and visions. This is the order of the stories so far. There are three large gaps between the stories with adventures that have yet to be told.

* Possible prequel: &quot;For the Love of a Daemon&quot; (&quot;Fantagor&quot; No.4, 1972). A sorcerer named Vermian and his demon slave Zomuk live in a castle and kidnap a voluptuous girl named Merya to sacrifice to the dark god Uhluhtc. At the end, Vermian is killed by Zomuk.
* Den 3: Children of Fire (1989). The planet Zomere is inhabited by an eusocial species similar to humans but oviparous. A breeding queen rules them. Females are non-sexual muscular warriors called Kils or workers called Works, and males are called Mals. After an attack by giant spiders the dying queen sends a Kil, a pre-queen simply named &quot;Kil&quot;, to found a new colony in Dremurth (Neverwhere) bringing with her Mals, Works, and eggs to seek the &quot;Magic Scepter&quot; (the Locnar). The ship crashes and only Kil and a skeletal Mal (named &quot;Mal&quot;, who will become the first Den) survive. Their only remaining egg produces a human baby, the second Den. Once they land they meet Zeg, a Vermian lookalike, Zomuk and his slave cook Pucca who live in Vermian&#x27;s castle from the prequel. At the end of the story, Zeg kidnaps a pregnant Pucca and the second Den, and Mal kills Zomuk.
* DenSaga No.2-4 (1992–1993). Three or four years later, the second Den is now an infant called David, and the first Den has fully transformed into a hyper-muscular body and now calls himself Daniel, Dan, or Uncle Dan. The second Den lives in a floating island called Heaven, ruled by Zeg, with Pucca, who is raising him. Pucca is also raising a daughter she had with the first Den, named Elinorma. Kil returns also, fully transformed into a leaner body with a very large bosom. According to Corben, the radiation from her spaceship transformed Kil into a hybrid of breeding queen and warrior. By the end of the story, the first Den (Mal) leaves with Kil in pursuit of Zeg, who has kidnapped the second Den, and Pucca flees with Elinorma.
* First untold interlude: According to &quot;Children of Fire&quot;, &quot;The radiation triggered a genetic change in Kil. She became a powerful ruler in this planet of violence (The Red Queen). Mal and Pucca became mates and eluded Kil for a time. Their offspring (Elinorma) challenged Kil&#x27;s rule between bouts of (Kil&#x27;s) madness.&quot;
* &quot;Neverwhere the Movie&quot; (1968). The first Den is now a thin, bespectacled man living on Earth. He builds a machine that opens a portal to Neverwhere. There he meets the Queen (they do not seem to know each other from when they were Kil and Mal). The Queen tells him that she is deposed and sends him on a mission to retrieve the Locnar, a magical scepter, from Gel, a humanoid monster, who declares that Den is the latest of several champions sent by the Queen. After he succeeds, the Queen returns Den to Earth in his thin form.
* Second untold interlude: Both Dens now live on Earth where they are similar looking thin men, older and younger, and they are believed to be uncle and nephew. The first Den disappears (to Neverwhere) and this time he does not return. In the note he leaves behind, he says that his Earth body is dying on Earth of a terminal disease, and that escaping to Neverwhere permanently was his only chance for survival. Once there, &quot;He fought Gel... saved the Queen (Neverwhere the Movie)... made love to her... and was killed... by treachery.&quot; According to &quot;Denz&quot;, he &quot;ultimately died by the hand of the woman he loved (it is hinted it was Kil).&quot; Seven years pass until the beginning of &quot;Den 1&quot;.
* &quot;Den 1: Neverwhere&quot; (1978). The second Den appears in Neverwhere without any previous memories of his childhood there. He believes his uncle, the first Den, left him directions on how to recreate the machine that opens the portal to this world. There he meets the Red Queen, whom he has sex with after being captured by her; Kath (brought to Neverwhere to be sacrificed to Uhluhtc, like Merya in the prequel), whom he rescues and with whom he falls in love, having a brief idyll with her; and Gel, whom he eventually kills. He also receives a visit from the first Den, who materializes and then disappears. At the end of the story, the second Den saves Zeg (called Zek in the comic) from certain death at the hands of the Red Queen, although Den is himself captured. The Red Queen orally rapes Den, but he is ultimately rescued by Kath. During his rescue, Den fatefully chooses to save the Red Queen from falling to her death. Four years will pass until the return of the Red Queen in &quot;Den 2&quot;.

* &quot;Den 2: Muvovum&quot; (1983). The second Den and Kath are now living in another floating island, Zegium, ruled by Zeg. Kath and the second Den return to Earth. The Red Queen appears and kills Zeg. The second Den then comes back to Neverwhere. He eventually is rejoined with a woman whom he believes to be Kath.
* &quot;Den 4: Dreams&quot; (1992). Four or five years later, the woman whom Den believes to be Kath has left him and, depressed, he has become obese and feeble. By the end of the story, he begins to transform back into his former, muscular self.
* &quot;Den 5: Elements&quot; (1992). Back in top, strapping shape, the second Den is reunited with a woman whom he believes to be Kath, who actually talks like she is Kil. Eventually, she is revealed to indeed be Kil, the Red Queen. She has brought Kath back to Neverwhere and when asked to choose between them, Den chooses the Red Queen. After a great explosion at the end of the story, Den is alone and unconscious and is rescued by his friends Zandor and Wyn.
* &quot;The Price of Memories&quot; (&quot;DenSaga&quot; No.1, 1992), &quot;Bog&#x27;s Deal&quot; (&quot;Heavy Metal&quot; No.141, 1992), &quot;Mola the Mole&quot; (&quot;Heavy Metal&quot; No.145, 1993), &quot;The Light at the End of the Tunnel&quot; (&quot;Heavy Metal&quot; No.149, 1994). Amnesiac, the second Den runs into Sienna, whom he met before in the opening of &quot;Grim Wit&quot; No.4. She takes care of him and helps him begin to remember his history, from the moment of birth from the egg brought to Neverwhere by Kil and Mal. Eventually, Sienna claims she has no more tales to tell him, and they part ways.
* Third untold interlude: The second Den becomes the king of Neverwhere. By the beginning of &quot;Denz&quot;, &quot;Thanks to his magical Locnar, Den has brought peace and prosperity to his adoptive world.&quot;
* &quot;Denz&quot; (&quot;Penthouse Comix&quot; No.15-20, 1996–1997). Years later, the second Den is now the ruler of Neverwhere and is visited by his brother Denzel Easton Norman, incarnated into the third &quot;almost&quot; Den, who is called &quot;Denz&quot;. This last part varies in tone from the rest of the story; it is a comedy and the characters are drawn more like caricatures than in any of the previous chapters. Den&#x27;s and Sienna&#x27;s faces are now grotesquely old.

==Influences==
The stories of Den are shaped by several well-known works of fiction. Sometimes the references are featured within the story itself.
* &quot;A Princess of Mars&quot; by Edgar Rice Burroughs. The screen story of Corben&#x27;s short film &quot;Neverwhere&quot;, as well as the whole concept behind its Den character, is based on the novel and its sequels, the first in Burrough&#x27;s Barsoom series. The 1963 Ace Books edition of &quot;A Princess of Mars&quot; is featured in the film, and the novels are mentioned in the first Den comics story. Den gets a new body that is perfect and, like the characters in the Barsoom novels, everyone, including himself, remains naked for the entire adventure. This aspect of the story was retained in the subsequent comic versions, unlike the Burroughs’ comics adaptations. Furthermore, with the relaxed social mores for depicting sexuality arising at the time of the Den series&#x27; inception, the erotic possibilities of &quot;Neverwhere&quot; are eagerly indulged by the characters. Kil and both Dens come from a planet whose inhabitants resemble Homo sapiens in most respects, except for being oviparous, like all Barsoomian races.
* &quot;The Wizard of Oz&quot;. As pointed out by Philip José Farmer Den, like Dorothy Gale, travels to a strange world and is sent on a mission, eventually returning to his former existence on Earth. Like Dorothy, Den is from Kansas.
* The stories of Robert E. Howard. Before completing the first Den collection, Corben adapted a short story by Howard, &quot;Bloodstar&quot;, where the muscular hero fought an amorphous, demonic creature, similar to Uhluhtc.
* The tales of H. P. Lovecraft. Particularly in the first volume of Den, the presence of Uhluhtc (Cthulhu spelled backwards) is a constant theme throughout the story. Uhluhtc is also mentioned in &quot;For the Love of a Daemon&quot; and &quot;Children of Fire&quot;.
* &quot;The Lord of the Rings&quot; by J.R.R. Tolkien. As pointed out by SidSid Keränen, the Nar stones and the scepter made from them, the Locnar, are similar to the One Ring and its corrupting power.
* &quot;Captain Marvel (DC Comics)&quot;. The transformation of a weak protagonist into an extremely developed muscleman resembles the same wish fulfillment fantasy between Billy Batson and Captain Marvel.

==Critical response==
Most critics have commented on the rather uneven and clichéd plot of the story and its visual power. Scholar Maurice Horn remarked that &quot;Den 1&quot; &quot;sounds like a lot of hokum ... but it is saved by Corben&#x27;s astonishing graphic mastery and the sweep of his composition&quot;. Román Gubern considers that, &quot;Den&#x27;s brilliant experimentalism appeared tinted by a Neo-expressionist influence&quot;. Tim Pilcher calls Den &quot;Conan on Viagra&quot;. Historian Paul Gravett thinks that &quot;Corben&#x27;s plotting may be erratic and prone to charges of sexism and cliché, but his total conviction and self-absorption in imagining this sensual dreamscape captivate and transport us there&quot;.

After analyzing all of Corben&#x27;s major works, Alberto García Marcos wrote, &quot;Den&#x27;s stories seem to wander aimlessly, with a minimal plot that weaves scenes of heroism, sex and action while giving unlimited power to the imagination of the author in the design of scenes and characters and the graphic experimentation. And graphically they do have great impact, but taken as a whole ... they are more or less ... mental masturbation&quot;. Author Samuel R. Delany agrees with the importance of the visuals in Den and its basic lack of plot.

D. Aviva Rothschild wrote about the first volume, &quot;Although coherent and interesting, the story takes second place to Corben&#x27;s lush, magnificent, fully painted, animation-quality art&quot;. Rothschild believes that the only problem with the book is &quot;the ludicrously large breasts of the two women...&quot; but considers that &quot;Neverwhere&quot; &quot;belongs in all adult collections...&quot; Artist Bob Fingerman writes that, &quot;&quot;Neverwhere&quot; is a timeless adult fantasy epic&quot;. According to the Lambiek online &quot;comiclopedia&quot;, &quot;With &#x27;Den&#x27;, Corben had found his ideal fantasy world. Corben returned again and again to it, and an end of &#x27;Den&#x27; is not to be foreseen&quot;.

Antonio Sánchez Rodríguez pondered Corben&#x27;s comments of the character Den being his imagined alter ego, interpreting him as being conceived to oppose sexual repression through desinhibition and deliberate hypersexualization. He also commented on women&#x27;s portrayal in &quot;Den&quot;, noting that although they weren&#x27;t classical, strong heroines or warrior women, they are independent and capable of employing their intelligence and sexuality to triumph. They act to fulfill their own sexual desire, just like Den.

==Film adaptation==
The film &quot;Heavy Metal&quot; features a segment titled &quot;Den&quot; that adapts the first Den collection, &quot;Den 1: Neverwhere&quot; (not to be confused with the animated short of the same title). The film eliminates the Uncle Dan part of the story and incorporates a green meteorite as a portal to Neverwhere. Small details are changed (Kath is now from Gibraltar), some concessions to appease the MPAA from giving the film an &quot;X&quot; rating such as the main characters wearing small loin garments (which playfully disappear for the female leads in long shots and when they are not depicted frontally, leaving them fully nude), some characters and subplots are eliminated, but the segment follows the plot of the comic story fairly closely. The biggest difference is the tone: the animated segment is told in a self-referential, humorous style, with Den as an innocent teenage science enthusiast reveling in living a wild sexual fantasy with an idealized body, different from the straight forward adventure tone of the comic. In fact, the segment is similar in tone to &quot;Denz&quot;, which makes fun of many of the absurdities of the Neverwhere premise. Den is voiced by comedic actor John Candy. To highlight the segment&#x27;s humorous tone, the script has Den speaking directly to both characters and also in contrasting voice-overs. In one, he is dead serious and strong willed, matching his epic existence on Neverwhere; in the other he sounds adolescent, reflecting on his life on Earth. The rest of the voice cast consists of Jackie Burroughs as Katherine Wells, Martin Lavut as Ard, Marilyn Lightstone as the Queen, and August Schellenberg as Norl. This adaptation has been compared in its idea to &quot;The Wizard of Oz&quot; by critic Chris Hicks, who says the story is, &quot;about two children changed into fantasy adults with a &#x27;bring-me-the-broomstick-of-the-wicked-witch&#x27;-style mission, etc&quot;. Jack Stokes, the veteran animator of the film &quot;Yellow Submarine&quot;, was put in charge of the production.

A studio was set up in London because, according to Stokes &quot;many animators are not good artists&quot;, meaning they are not skilled in drawing the human figure realistically, and art students were recruited to pitch in on the production. This accounts for the lack of consistency in the characters&#x27; likenesses. Corben painted the poster for the film and was asked to contribute to the production. He drew three character sheet turnarounds for Den and Kath, but these were not usable due to &quot;inconsistencies in the construction&quot;. Still, the animators tried to recreate the look of the comic by developing several techniques to reproduce the unusual colors of Corben&#x27;s artwork.

The segment was well received, even by critics who did not think much of the film. Critic Janet Maslin gave the film a positive review in &quot;The New York Times&quot;. She said, &quot;The other highly memorable story is about a bookworm from earth who winds up on another planet, where his spindly body is transformed into that of an extraterrestrial Hercules&quot;. She also complimented John Candy&#x27;s vocal performance as Den. Corben wrote about the film, &quot;I was pleased with the Den segment of the Heavy Metal Movie. The drawings and movement seemed stiff, rough and unpolished, but the thrust and characters were right. I thought that John Candy did a great job with Den&#x27;s voice.&quot;

<text>Dragon Empires was a fantasy massively multiplayer online role-playing game developed by UK-based Codemasters. Its main focus was player versus player clan action to take control of 50 cities in five empires within its world.

== Development ==
On September 20, 2001 Codemasters unveiled development of &quot;Dragon Empires&quot; and initially slated it to launch in October 2002. The game received enthusiastic response from gamers, with 120,000 signing up to beta-test the game. Reviewers also appreciated the game for its graphics and gameplay. One reviewer said:&quot;Boasting amazing graphics with a deep player-influenced world that promises to become more addictive as content is added, Dragon Empires looks promising. … if the words &quot;amazing graphics&quot; and &quot;incredible game&quot; were synonymous, Dragon Empires would be one of the greatest games to hit the MMORPG scene thus far&quot;. At the 2003 Electronic Entertainment Expo in Los Angeles, Codemasters demonstrated a prototype of the game engine and awed critics with breathtaking renderings of the game environment. As development progressed, the release date was pushed back multiple times, to October 2003 and then to spring 2004.

== Cancellation ==
Codemasters revealed in September 3, 2004 that they had ceased game development citing technical issues. Three days later, &quot;Dragon Empires&quot; producer Gary Dunn explained that their server code was incapable of supporting the number of clients expected for a massively multiplayer game. This prompted a six-week review of the game&#x27;s viability, which found that the cost to fix the difficulties would be high and the decision was made instead to cancel the title.

Despite the cancellation of several MMOs in 2004, Ed Relf, marketing brand manager at Codemasters maintained that the tightly packed MMORPG market was not a reason for the discontinuation. The &quot;Dragon Empires&quot; community started a petition hoping to renew development in the game. However, the game&#x27;s official website was closed some time after June 17, 2005.

<doc id="843532" wikidata="Q32788" url="?curid=843532" title="Stella Adler">
<text>Stella Adler (February 10, 1901 – December 21, 1992) was an American actress and acting teacher.

A member of Yiddish Theater&#x27;s Adler dynasty, Adler began acting at a young age. She shifted to producing, directing, and teaching, founding the Stella Adler Studio of Acting in New York City in 1949. Later in life she taught part time in Los Angeles, with the assistance of her protégée, actress Joanne Linville, who continued to teach Adler&#x27;s technique.

== Early life ==
Stella Adler was born in Manhattan&#x27;s Lower East Side in New York City. She was the youngest daughter of Sara and Jacob P. Adler, the sister of Luther, Jay, Frances, and Julia Adler and half-sister of Charles Adler and Celia Adler, star of the Yiddish Theater. All five of her siblings were actors. The Adlers were part of the Jewish American Adler acting dynasty, which had its start in the Yiddish Theater District and was a significant part of the vibrant ethnic theatrical scene that thrived in New York from the late 19th century to the 1950s. Adler became the most famous and influential member of her family. She began acting at the age of four as a part of the Independent Yiddish Art Company of her parents.

== Career ==

Adler began her acting career at the age of four in the play &quot;Broken Hearts&quot; at the Grand Street Theatre on the Lower East Side, as a part of her parents&#x27; Independent Yiddish Art Company. She grew up acting alongside her parents, often playing roles of boys and girls. Her work schedule allowed little time for schooling, but when possible, she studied at public schools and New York University. She made her London debut, at the age of 18, as Naomi in &quot;Elisa Ben Avia&quot; with her father&#x27;s company, in which she appeared for a year before returning to New York. In London, she met her first husband, Englishman Horace Eliashcheff; their brief marriage, however, ended in a divorce. 

Adler made her English-language debut on Broadway in 1922 as the Butterfly in &quot;The World We Live In&quot;, and she spent a season in the vaudeville circuit. In 1922–23, the renowned Russian actor-director Konstantin Stanislavski made his only U.S. tour with his Moscow Art Theatre. Adler and many others saw these performances, which had a powerful and lasting impact on her career and the 20th-century American theatre. She joined the American Laboratory Theatre in 1925; there, she was introduced to Stanislavski&#x27;s theories, from founders and Russian actor-teachers and former members of the Moscow Art Theater—Richard Boleslavsky and Maria Ouspenskaya. In 1931, with Sanford Meisner and Elia Kazan, among others, she joined the Group Theatre, New York, founded by Harold Clurman, Lee Strasberg, and Cheryl Crawford, through theater director and critic, Clurman, whom she later married in 1943. With Group Theatre, she worked in plays such as &quot;Success Story&quot; by John Howard Lawson, two Clifford Odets plays, &quot;Awake and Sing!&quot; and &quot;Paradise Lost&quot;, and directed the touring company of Odets&#x27;s &quot;Golden Boy&quot; and &quot;More to Give to People&quot;. Members of Group Theatre were leading interpreters of the method acting technique based on the work and writings of Stanislavski. 

In 1934, Adler went to Paris with Harold Clurman and studied intensively with Stanislavski for five weeks. During this period, she learned that Stanislavski had revised his theories, emphasizing that the actor should create by imagination rather than memory. Upon her return, she broke away from Strasberg on the fundamental aspects of method acting. In 1982, the day Strasberg died, Adler is said to have remarked, &quot;It will take the theatre decades to recover from the damage that Lee Strasberg inflicted on American actors.&quot;

In January 1937, Adler moved to Hollywood. There, she acted in films for six years under the name Stella Ardler, occasionally returning to the Group Theater until it dissolved in 1941. Eventually, she returned to New York to act, direct, and teach, the latter first at Erwin Piscator&#x27;s Dramatic Workshop at the New School for Social Research, New York City, before founding Stella Adler Conservatory of Theatre in 1949. In the following years, she taught Marlon Brando, Steve McQueen, Dolores del Río, Robert De Niro, Elaine Stritch, Martin Sheen, Manu Tupou, Harvey Keitel, Melanie Griffith, Peter Bogdanovich, and Warren Beatty, among others, the principles of characterization and script analysis. She also taught at the New School, and the Yale School of Drama. For many years, Adler led the undergraduate drama department at New York University, and became one of America&#x27;s leading acting teachers.

Stella Adler was much more than a teacher of acting. Through her work she imparts the most valuable kind of information—how to discover the nature of our own emotional mechanics and therefore those of others. She never lent herself to vulgar exploitations, as some other well-known so-called &quot;methods&quot; of acting have done. As a result, her contributions to the theatrical culture have remained largely unknown, unrecognized, and unappreciated.
:—Marlon Brando

In 1988, she published &quot;The Technique of Acting&quot; with a foreword by Marlon Brando. From 1926 until 1952, she appeared regularly on Broadway. Her later stage roles include the 1946 revival of &quot;He Who Gets Slapped&quot; and an eccentric mother in the 1961 black comedy &quot;Oh Dad, Poor Dad, Mama&#x27;s Hung You in the Closet and I&#x27;m Feelin&#x27; So Sad&quot;. Among the plays she directed was a 1956 revival of the Paul Green/Kurt Weill antiwar musical &quot;Johnny Johnson&quot;. She appeared in only three films: &quot;Love on Toast&quot; (1937), &quot;Shadow of the Thin Man&quot; (1941), and &quot;My Girl Tisa&quot; (1948). She concluded her acting career in 1961, after 55 years. During that time, and for years after, she became a renowned acting teacher.

== Stanislavski and the method ==

Adler was the only member of the Group Theatre to study with Konstantin Stanislavski. She was a prominent member of the Group Theatre, but differences with Lee Strasberg over Stanislavski&#x27;s system (later developed by Strasberg into method acting) made her leave the group. 
Adler met with Stanislavski again later in his career and questioned him on Strasberg&#x27;s interpretation. He told her that he had abandoned emotional memory, which had been Strasberg&#x27;s dominant paradigm, but that they both believed that actors did not have what is required to play a variety of roles already instilled inside them, and that extensive research was needed to understand the experiences of characters who have different values originating from different cultures. 

Like Stanislavski, Adler understood the &quot;gold hidden&quot; inside the circumstances of the text. Actors should stimulate emotional experience by imagining the scene&#x27;s &quot;given circumstances,&quot; rather than recalling experiences from their own lives. She also understood that 50% of the actor&#x27;s job is internal (imagination, emotion, action, will) and 50% is externals (characterization, way of walking, voice, face). To find what works for the character, the actors must study the circumstances of the text and make their choices based on what one gets from the material. 

For instance, if a character talks about horse riding, one needs to know something about horse riding as an actor, otherwise one will be faking. More importantly, one must study the values of different people to understand what situations would have meant to people, when those situations might mean nothing in the actor&#x27;s own culture. Without this work, Adler said that an actor walks onto the stage &quot;naked&quot;. This approach is one for which both Marlon Brando and Robert De Niro became famous. 

Adler also trained actors&#x27; sensory imagination to help make the characters&#x27; experiences more vivid. She believed that mastery of the physical and vocal aspects of acting was necessary for the actor to command the stage, and that all body language should be carefully crafted and voices need to be clear and expressive. She often referred to this as an actor&#x27;s &quot;size&quot; or &quot;worthiness of the stage&quot;. Her biggest mantra was perhaps &quot;in your choices lies your talent&quot;, and she encouraged actors to find the most grand character interpretation possible in a scene; another favorite phrase of hers regarding this was &quot;don&#x27;t be boring&quot;. 

Singer-songwriter Janis Ian studied under Adler in the early 1980s to help her feel more comfortable on stage, and the two women remained close friends until Adler&#x27;s death. In her autobiography &quot;Society&#x27;s Child&quot; (2008), Ian recalled that Adler had little patience for students who weren&#x27;t progressing as she wanted, going so far on one occasion as to give one of her students a dime and tell her to call her mother to pick her up because &quot;she had no business in the theater.&quot; On another occasion, Ian relates, Adler forcibly ripped a dress off another actress&#x27;s body to get the actress to play a scene a different way.

== Personal life and death ==
Adler was related to Jerry Adler, an actor and theatre director.

Adler married three times: first to Horace Eliascheff—the father of her only child, Ellen—from 1923 to 1930; then from 1942 until 1959 to director and critic Harold Clurman, one of the founders of the Group Theatre. She was finally married to physicist and novelist Mitchell A. Wilson, from 1966 until his death in 1973. From 1938 to 1946, she was sister-in-law to actress Sylvia Sidney. Sidney was married to Luther Adler at the time and provided Stella with a nephew. Even after Sidney and Luther divorced, she and Sylvia remained close friends.

A lifelong Democrat, she supported Adlai Stevenson&#x27;s campaign during the 1952 presidential election.

On December 21, 1992, Adler died from heart failure at the age of 91 in Los Angeles.

== Legacy ==
Adler&#x27;s technique, based on a balanced and pragmatic combination of imagination and memory, is hugely credited with introducing the subtle and insightful details and a deep physical embodiment of a character. Elaine Stritch once said: &quot;What an extraordinary combination was Stella Adler—a goddess full of magic and mystery, a child full of innocence and vulnerability.&quot; In the book &quot;Acting: Onstage and Off&quot;, Robert Barton wrote: &quot;[Adler] established the value of the actor putting herself in the place of the character rather than vice versa ... More than anyone else, Stella Adler brought into public awareness all the close careful attention to text and analysis Stanislavski endorsed.&quot;

In 1991, Stella Adler was inducted into the American Theater Hall of Fame.

In 2004, the Harry Ransom Center at the University of Texas at Austin acquired Adler&#x27;s complete archive along with a small collection of her papers from her former husband Harold Clurman. The collection includes correspondence, manuscripts, typescripts, lecture notes, photographs, and other materials. Over 1,100 audio and video recordings of Adler teaching from the 1960s to the 1980s have been digitized by the center and are accessible on site. The archive traces her career from her start in the New York Yiddish Theater District to her encounters with Stanislavski and the Group Theatre to her lectures at the Stella Adler Studio of Acting.

In 2006, she was honored with a posthumous star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame in front of the Stella Adler Theatre at 6773 Hollywood Boulevard.

Adler is a character in &quot;Names&quot;, Mark Kemble&#x27;s play about former Group Theatre members&#x27; struggles with the House Un-American Activities Committee. Kemble consulted her about characterizations for the play and she told him to &quot;just make it up&quot;.

== Stella Adler schools ==

Irene Gilbert, a longtime protégée and friend, ran the Stella Adler Studio of Acting in Los Angeles until her death.

The Stella Adler Studio of Acting in New York opened a new studio in Los Angeles named the Art of Acting Studio in 2010 and is run by the Adler family.

<doc id="843533" wikidata="Q4229899" url="?curid=843533" title="Jersey Communist Party">
<text>The Jersey Communist Party was a political party on the island of Jersey. The JCP seems to have had a semi-autonomous relation to the Communist Party of Great Britain.

During the Second World War, when Jersey was under Nazi occupation, the JCP-leader Norman Le Brocq led a resistance group called Jersey Democratic Movement. The resistance helped many of the Soviet forced labourers that the Germans had brought to the island. JDM, the JCP and Transport and General Workers’ Union distributed propaganda. With the aid of a German deserter, Paul Mulbach, they apparently had some success in turning the soldiers of the garrison against their masters, including most notably the highest military authority in the Islands, Huffmeier. There is some evidence to suggest that they had even set a date for this mutiny (1 May 1945), but that it was rendered pointless by the suicide of Adolf Hitler.

The history of the party is murky at best. Peter Tabb suggests that they were involved in the blowing up of the Palace Hotel and of separate ammo dumps, in fact it is more likely that their involvement was to set fire to the hotel, and the German efforts to put out the subsequent blaze, by using dynamite to create a breach between the flames were misjudged and set off charges in a neighbouring ammo dump. Nevertheless, the JCP do seem to have made many plans for organised resistance.

After the war Norman Le Brocq was elected deputy in Jersey in 1972. He was twice reelected and sat on a ministerial committee.

In 1966, Le Brocq and 19 other islanders were awarded gold watches by the Soviet Union as a sign of gratitude for their role in the resistance movement.

Le Brocq led the Fishery Advisory Committee until his death.

After his death, a fishing vessel was named after Le Brocq. There is also a Community Worker award named after him.

The date at which JCP dissolved is unclear. There was also a which was based in 6 Burnt Lane in Saint Peter Port which was lead by Robert G. Hale in 1948. though they seemed to have enjoyed even less electoral success and are also a defunct political entity.

<text>James Leo Herlihy (; February 27, 1927 – October 21, 1993) was an American novelist, playwright and actor.

His novels &quot;Midnight Cowboy&quot; and &quot;All Fall Down&quot;, and his play &quot;Blue Denim&quot; were adapted for cinema. Other publications include &quot;The Season of the Witch&quot; and several short stories.

==Biography==
Herlihy was born into a working-class family in Detroit, Michigan, in 1927. He was raised in Detroit and Chillicothe, Ohio. He enlisted with the Navy in 1945 but saw no action due to the end of World War II. He attended Black Mountain College in North Carolina for two years, where he studied sculpture. He then moved to southern California and attended the Pasadena Playhouse College of the Theatre.

A gay man, Herlihy became a close friend of playwright Tennessee Williams, who served as his mentor. Both spent a significant amount of time in Key West, Florida. Like Williams, Herlihy had lived in New York City. Apart from Key West, the primary home of Herlihy was in the Silver Lake district of Los Angeles. There, another mentor and close friend was French author Anais Nin, who shared some of her most secret diaries with him. 

==Works==
Plays he wrote include &quot;Streetlight Sonata&quot; (1950), &quot;Moon in Capricorn&quot; (1953), and &quot;Blue Denim&quot; (produced on Broadway in 1958).
He directed actress Tallulah Bankhead in a touring production of his play &quot;Crazy October&quot; in 1959.
Three of his one-act plays, titled collectively &quot;Stop, You&#x27;re Killing Me&quot; were presented by the Theater Company of Boston in 1969.
According to author Sean Egan in his biography of James Kirkwood Jr., &quot;Ponies &amp; Rainbows&quot;, Herlihy co-wrote the play &quot;UTBU&quot; with Kirkwood but demanded his name be taken off the credits.

Herlihy wrote three novels: &quot;All Fall Down&quot; (1960), &quot;Midnight Cowboy&quot; (1965), and &quot;The Season of the Witch&quot; (1971).
His short stories were collected in &quot;The Sleep of Baby Filbertson and Other Stories&quot; (1959) and &quot;A Story That Ends in a Scream and Eight Others&quot; (1967), a collection which included plays.

===Acting roles===
Herlihy appeared as a guest star in &quot;A Bunch of Lonely Pagliaccis,&quot; a 1962 episode of the TV series &quot;Route 66&quot;. He acted in the movie &quot;In the French Style&quot; (1963) with Jean Seberg. Herlihy also acted in Edward Albee&#x27;s play &quot;The Zoo Story&quot; in 1963 in Boston and Paris, and in the 1981 film &quot;Four Friends&quot; directed by Arthur Penn.

===Tax protest===
In 1968, Herlihy signed the &quot;Writers and Editors War Tax Protest&quot; pledge, vowing to refuse tax payments as a protest against the Vietnam War. He later also became a sponsor of the War Tax Resistance project, which practiced and advocated tax resistance as a form of protest against the war.

==Death==
Herlihy committed suicide at the age of 66, by taking an overdose of sleeping pills in Los Angeles.

<text>Robin Jarvis (born 8 May 1963) is a British young adult fiction (YA) and children&#x27;s novelist, who writes dark fantasy, suspense and supernatural thrillers. His books for young adults have featured the inhabitants of a coastal town battling a monumental malevolence with the help of its last supernatural guardian &quot;(The Witching Legacy)&quot;, a diminutive race of Werglers (shape shifters) pitched against the evil might of the faerie hordes &quot;(The Hagwood Trilogy)&quot;, a sinister &quot;world-switching&quot; dystopian future, triggered by a sinister and hypnotic book &quot;(Dancing Jax)&quot;, Norse Fates, Glastonbury crow-demons and a time travelling, wise-cracking teddy bear. &quot;(The Wyrd Museum series)&quot;, dark powers, a forgotten race and ancient evils on the North Yorkshire coast &quot;(The Whitby Witches trilogy)&quot;, epic medieval adventure &quot;(The Oaken Throne)&quot; and science-fiction dramatising the &quot;nefarious intrigue&quot; within an alternate Tudor realm, peopled by personalities of the time, automata servants and animals known as Mechanicals and ruled by Queen Elizabeth I. &quot;(Deathscent)&quot;.

Jarvis&#x27; books for younger readers have featured anthropomorphic rodents and small mammals – especially mice - as featured in the Deptford Mice series. A number of his works are based in London, in and around Deptford and Greenwich where he used to live, Felixstowe, or in Whitby, the setting for &quot;The Whitby Witches trilogy&quot; and his latest series: &quot;The Witching Legacy&quot;.His first novel – The Dark Portal, featuring the popular Deptford Mice – was the runner up for the Smarties book prize in 1989. His work has been described as &quot;genre Busting&quot; and &quot;original, spooky, unusual, psychological supernatural horror fantasy with a very modern twist&quot;. Jarvis has said that he is not a writer of horror fiction, however his work has also been compared to that of &quot;…Stephen King, but for Young Adults.&quot; The Deptford Mice was adapted and dramatized by Tiny Dog Productions, and staged in January 2010 and April 2011.

==Biography==
Jarvis was born in Liverpool, the youngest of four children, and grew up in Warrington, attending Penketh High School.

===The Witching Legacy===

:&quot;The Power of Dark&quot; (June 2016)
:&quot;The Devil&#x27;s Paintbox&quot; (March 2017)
:&quot;Time of Blood&quot; (July 2017)
:&quot;Legacy of Witches&quot;

The Witching Legacy is a four title series published by Egmont Books, in which Jarvis returns to the North Yorkshire town of Whitby. Jarvis said in a 2015 press release. &quot;Now the time is right to climb those 199 steps once more and discover what’s been happening. Gasp – very grave and Dark things…&quot; He further said of the town &quot;The place won&#x27;t leave me alone, it compels stories out of me. It&#x27;s such a perfect blend of every location you could want, with a fabulously rich history that stretches back over a thousand years.&quot;

&quot;The Power of Dark&quot; follows the story of two friends who get caught up in a supernatural vendetta from the past. &quot;Something is brewing in the town of Whitby. To best friends Lil and Verne, it just seems like a particularly bad storm, but Cherry Cerise, the last of the Whitby witches, fears that ancient forces are at work, reviving the curse of a long lost magical artifact.&quot;

&quot;The Devil&#x27;s Paintbox&quot;
continues the adventures of Lil when &quot;More than ever she needs the support of best friend Verne and the witch Cherry Cerise, but they are preoccupied by their attempts to uncover more secrets of the golden Nimius. When Lil finds an antique box of watercolour paints she welcomes the diversion, little realising that every time she uses it something nasty escapes. But it is while they are distracted an old enemy finds a path to their door . . .&quot;

&quot;Time of Blood&quot;
In this third title, the sinister Mister Dark is more powerful than ever and has enslaved young Verne to his will. Can Lil save her best friend before their enemy unleashes his most audacious and insane plan yet? Even with the help of new, surprising allies - a witch, a mysterious man of many disguises and the secretive aufwaders beneath the cliff - all seems hopeless. Whitby has never been a more frightening and dangerous place to live, and the murdered dead refuse to rest in peace.

Jarvis has said the series was inspired by a dream. &quot;...it gave me everything I needed, the title of the book, the characters and their names and other key &#x27;ingredients&#x27;&quot;.

The series relates the hypnotic and destructive power held over its readers by a devilish book, originally written in the 1930s by an evil magician. The book acts as a gateway to Mooncaster, &quot;a fairytale world, full of Jacks, Queens and Kings, unicorns and wolves&quot;, but further described as &quot;No fairytale&quot;, and by the author himself as &quot;Not for the faint-hearted&quot;.

<text>Antoine Devon Walker (born August 12, 1976) is an American former professional basketball player. He was drafted with the sixth overall pick in the 1996 NBA draft out of the University of Kentucky and played in the NBA from 1996 to 2008. Walker played for the Boston Celtics, Dallas Mavericks, Atlanta Hawks, Miami Heat, Minnesota Timberwolves, the BSN&#x27;s Mets de Guaynabo and the NBA D-League&#x27;s Idaho Stampede before retiring from basketball in 2012. Walker, a three-time NBA All-Star, won an NCAA championship with Kentucky in 1996 and an NBA championship with the Heat in 2006.

==Pre-NBA career==
Walker attended Mount Carmel High School, in Chicago, where he played with future NFL quarterback Donovan McNabb and attained all-state status as a senior, earning a full scholarship to play for Rick Pitino at the University of Kentucky. He was a starting forward on the Wildcats&#x27; 1996 NCAA Men&#x27;s Division I Basketball Championship Game-winning team. As a freshman at Kentucky he was named SEC Tournament MVP. In his sophomore year, Walker was named All-SEC First, All-SEC Tournament and to the All-NCAA Regional Teams.

==Professional career==

=== Boston Celtics (1996–2003) ===
After Walker&#x27;s sophomore season, he declared for the 1996 NBA draft and was picked sixth overall by the Boston Celtics. In the 1996–1997 season, Walker made the All-Rookie First Team and led the team in scoring (17.5 ppg) and rebounding (9.0), as the team had its worst season in franchise history, 15–67. The following season, Pitino was reunited with Walker as the new coach of the Celtics and he made the All-Star team as a reserve while averaging 22.4 ppg and 10.2 rpg. He also scored a career-high 49 points in a loss against the Washington Wizards. Walker&#x27;s success led to his appearance on the cover of NBA Live 99.

In the &#x27;98 draft, the Celtics had the 10th pick and chose swing man Paul Pierce. The next few years, Pierce and Walker were a talented duo for the Celtics. In the 2001–2002 season, Walker had his best overall season by helping lead the Celtics to a 49–33 record and their first playoff berth in seven years. He was second on his team in scoring (22.0), first in rebounds (9), and first in assists, (5.0). Pierce and Walker took the team to the Eastern Conference finals, where they fell to the New Jersey Nets in six games. The next season, Walker made his third All-Star team.

On February 20, 2002, former Kentucky teammate Tony Delk was traded to the Celtics, reuniting Walker with him.

=== Dallas Mavericks (2003–2004) ===
Just 10 days before the start of the 2003–04 season, Walker was traded with Delk to the Dallas Mavericks for Raef LaFrentz, Chris Mills, Jiří Welsch, and a 2004 first-round draft pick. Despite appearing and starting in every game for Dallas that season, Walker was used in a relatively limited capacity on his new team due to the number of high-caliber players populating the Mavericks&#x27; roster. Included on that team was Antawn Jamison, who was newly acquired from the Golden State Warriors.

=== Atlanta Hawks (2004–2005) ===
On August 8, 2004, Walker and Delk were traded again, this time to the Atlanta Hawks for Jason Terry, longtime Hawk Alan Henderson and a conditional 2007 first-round draft pick. As the pick did not convey, Dallas received cash considerations from Atlanta instead.

=== Return to Celtics (2005) ===
On February 24, 2005, Walker was traded back to the Celtics in a deal that sent Gary Payton, Tom Gugliotta, Michael Stewart, and a first-round draft pick to the Hawks. (Payton was released by the Hawks and re-signed with Boston for the remainder of the season). Walker started all 24 remaining games for the Celtics, averaging 16.3 points and 8.3 rebounds a game as the Celtics advanced to the playoffs before losing to the Indiana Pacers in a 7-game first round series. For his second stint with the Celtics, Walker briefly chose to wear the uniform number 88, as his trademark 8 jersey was being worn by rookie Al Jefferson. Jefferson would switch to number 7 after 2 games.

=== Miami Heat (2005–2007) ===

On August 2, 2005, Walker was involved in a five-team, 13-player deal (the largest trade in NBA history) that sent him from the Celtics to the Miami Heat. The Celtics received Curtis Borchardt, Qyntel Woods, the draft rights of Albert Miralles, and draft picks in the deal. The move reunited Walker with Celtics teammate Gary Payton.

The Heat played Walker mostly off the bench, and he rotated between both forward positions. Though he struggled early to adjust to this role, by the end of the season he was a force for the Heat, finishing the season with averages of 12.2 points and 5.1 rebounds a game as the team&#x27;s main scorer off the bench. Walker also led the team in overall 3-point shots made for the season, and increased his 3-point, free throw and overall shooting percentages.

In the playoffs his production would increase, as he would be the third leading scorer for the team while making crucial three-point baskets and posting 20 points in four different playoff games including 23 against the New Jersey Nets in the closing game of the conference semifinals. Miami advanced to the NBA Finals and faced the Dallas Mavericks, with Walker posting 13.8 points per game in the series as the Heat won the NBA championship in 6 games. In the title clinching sixth game in Dallas, Walker contributed 14 points and 11 rebounds. Walker&#x27;s production dipped in the 2006–2007 season as he averaged 8.5 points a game and 4.3 rebounds. The Heat failed to repeat as champions following a first round loss to the Chicago Bulls.

=== Minnesota Timberwolves (2007–2008) ===
On October 24, 2007, Walker was traded to the Minnesota Timberwolves along with Michael Doleac, Wayne Simien, a first-round draft pick and cash considerations in exchange for Ricky Davis and Mark Blount.

On June 27, 2008, Walker was dealt to the Memphis Grizzlies along with Marko Jarić, Greg Buckner, and the rights to O. J. Mayo, for Mike Miller, Brian Cardinal, Jason Collins, and the rights to Kevin Love. After appearing in just two preseason games and remaining inactive throughout the opening months of the regular season, he was waived by the Grizzlies on December 19, 2008.

=== Mets de Guaynabo (2010) ===
In February 2010, Walker signed with the Guaynabo Mets along with former Chicago Bulls player Marcus Fizer. Walker was released on April 1, 2010.

=== Idaho Stampede (2010–2012) ===
On May 6, 2010, ESPN reported that Walker was trying to return to the NBA. On December 7, 2010, Walker was acquired by Idaho Stampede of the NBA Development League. It was reported in April 2012 that Walker had announced his retirement after two years with the Stampede.

==Personal life==

Walker was born and raised on the South Side of Chicago. He attended Mount Carmel High School.

Walker was engaged to reality star Evelyn Lozada of &quot;Basketball Wives&quot; from 1998 until 2008.

===Legal issues===
In 1997, alongside Walker&#x27;s roommate as well as NBA players Ron Mercer and Chauncey Billups, Walker was identified in a lawsuit of a woman who said she was raped in his home. Walker denied participation in the sexual assault, but was accused of walking through the room while it took place. Walker filed a counter-complaint against Mercer and Billups, but those records are sealed. Mercer and Billups settled the case out of court.

On January 5, 2009, Walker was arrested for driving under the influence in Miami Beach, Florida.

On July 15, 2009, Walker was charged with three felony counts of writing bad checks related to gambling debts he had incurred at three Las Vegas casinos. Walker was arrested on July 15 at Harrah&#x27;s Casino in South Lake Tahoe, Nevada. The charges stemmed from over $800,000 in gambling debts. Walker was in South Lake Tahoe to play in the American Century Celebrity Golf Classic the following day.

On June 30, 2010, Walker entered a plea of not guilty on felony bad check charges stemming from his failure to pay $770,000 in gambling losses to Caesars Palace and two other casinos in Las Vegas, according to the &quot;Las Vegas Review Journal&quot;. A year later, he pleaded guilty to one felony count of passing a bad check. Under the plea agreement, he did not face a prison term, and was put on probation and worked towards repaying the debt.

===Victim of robberies===
In July 2000, Walker and former University of Kentucky teammate Nazr Mohammed were robbed outside a South Side Chicago restaurant. On July 9, 2007, Walker and another individual were robbed at gunpoint by two offenders in his own house. The assailants made off with close to $200,000 worth of merchandise, including Walker&#x27;s Mercedes. His car was later recovered having been stripped of its expensive aftermarket wheels and stereo system. Four men were charged in this robbery and two of them were also linked to the similar robbery of fellow NBA player, Eddy Curry.

===Bankruptcy===
On May 18, 2010, Walker filed for Chapter 7 bankruptcy protection in the Southern District of Florida (Miami) as case number 10–23558 with total assets of $4.3 million and debts of $12.7 million. The filing listed four pieces of real estate including a $2.3 million Miami home that was underwater with a mortgage of $3.6 million, and three other properties in Chicago, one listed for $1.4 million. Nazr Mohammed paid half the fee of Walker&#x27;s bankruptcy attorney. Walker&#x27;s championship ring had to be sold off. In August 2013, Walker announced that he was debt-free. Between 1996 and 2009, Walker earned more than $108 million from NBA salaries.

===Broadcasting career===
Walker was a basketball analyst on 120 Sports. Walker was also hired by SEC Network as a basketball analyst.

<text>Roderick, or The Education of a Young Machine is a 1980 science fiction novel by American writer John Sladek. It was nominated for a Philip K. Dick Award and was followed in 1983 by Roderick at Random, or Further Education of a Young Machine. The two books were originally intended as a single longer novel, and were finally reissued together in 2001 as &quot;The Complete Roderick&quot;. It was included in David Pringle&#x27;s book &quot;Science Fiction: The 100 Best Novels&quot;.

==Plot summary==
The title character is an intelligent robot, the first to be invented. The opening chapters describe the creation of Roderick and show his mind (at first consisting of a bodiless computer program) developing through several stages of awareness. Finally, Roderick is given a rudimentary body and, through a series of misadventures, finds himself alone in the world. Due to his sketchy understanding of human customs, and intrigues surrounding the project that created him, he unwittingly becomes the center of various criminal schemes and other unfortunate events.

==Major themes==
Though the &quot;Roderick&quot; books are in many ways serious examinations of philosophical issues surrounding the idea of intelligent machines, their plot is (typically for Sladek) propelled by energetic farce and satire. Nearly every human institution, particularly academia and government, is portrayed as grievously incompetent (the Roderick project itself is originally an elaborate fraud), and the growing computerization of modern society causes no end of trouble for people—though Roderick is able to turn it to his advantage. A running joke throughout is that although Roderick is not particularly human-looking, people are unable to believe that he is a robot or simply fail to notice, and treat him instead as an insane man or a disabled child; but, like Candide or Prince Myshkin (from &quot;The Idiot&quot;), he never complains and always seeks to please.

The story is also peppered with Sladek&#x27;s usual puns and word games, and satirical jabs at other science fiction themes, particularly Isaac Asimov&#x27;s Three Laws of Robotics.

<text>Roderick at Random is a novel by John Sladek published in 1983. It is the sequel to &quot;Roderick, or The Education of a Young Machine&quot; (1980); both novels were reissued together in 2001 as &quot;The Complete Roderick&quot;.

==Plot summary==
&quot;Roderick at Random&quot; is a novel in which Roderick the robot tries to learn about what it means to be human.

==Reception==
Dave Langford reviewed &quot;Roderick at Random&quot; for &quot;White Dwarf&quot; #39, and stated that &quot;The first worthwhile SF to arrive in 1983 is John Sladek&#x27;s &quot;Roderick at Random&quot; [...] Sladek&#x27;s satire is merciless, hilariously pointing out how humans prefer not to think for themselves, programmed by newspapers, tranquillizers, food fads or batty cults becoming much more predictable and less rational than poor Roderick. Sad, but not far from being true.&quot;

Dave Pringle reviewed &quot;Roderick at Random&quot; for &quot;Imagine&quot; magazine, and stated that &quot;It&#x27;s a crazy, venal, hilarious world that Sladek creates. while Roderick himself is beautiful, a saint.&quot;

<doc id="843544" wikidata="Q5259366" url="?curid=843544" title="Dent (fell)">
<text>Dent is a small fell on the fringe of the English Lake District near the towns of Cleator Moor and Egremont. Sometimes known as Long Barrow, it is traditionally the first fell encountered by hikers following Wainwright&#x27;s Coast to Coast Walk. It slopes from the westerly point of the Lake District National Park.

At its highest point it stands at only 352 metres (1155 feet), but offers uninterrupted views of the Cumbrian coast from the Ravenglass estuary in the south to the Solway Firth and across to Scotland in the north. In the west the Isle of Man can be easily seen, and views to the east extend to the high peaks of Pillar and the Sca Fells.

‘Dent Hill’ was one of the five stations in Cumberland used by the Ordnance Survey to measure the angles of Principal Triangles for their initial survey of Britain in the years up to and including 1809. The other stations were Black Combe, Scilly Banks (on the outskirts of Whitehaven), High Pike and Cross Fell. The absence of a trig point suggests that Dent was not used in the Retriangulation of Great Britain.
Over the past 20 years a man-made forest has been planted on the slopes of the fell facing north towards Cleator Moor. This process was carried out to reduce the rate of erosion on the fell. There is already a mature forest on the southern slopes of the fell and public pedestrian access via a gate at Nannycatch.

There is a road at the base of the fell, known locally as ‘the fell road’ (was known as The Roman Road - Fell Road referred to the road from Ennerdale village to Calder Abby. Usage changed over the past 50 years), which runs from Cleator Moor to Egremont. The road is still used by locals, despite its poor quality and that it doesn&#x27;t represent a shortcut.

The River Ehen also tracks along the base of the fell and the aforementioned road.

Dent, along with Flat Fell, is the subject of a chapter of Wainwright&#x27;s book &quot;The Outlying Fells of Lakeland&quot;. His clockwise route to the two summits starts at Wath Brow.

<text>The Minnesota State Capitol is the seat of government for the U.S. state of Minnesota, in its capital city of Saint Paul. It houses the Minnesota Senate, Minnesota House of Representatives, the office of the attorney general and the office of the governor. The building also includes a chamber for the Minnesota Supreme Court, although court activities usually take place in the neighboring Minnesota Judicial Center.

There have been three State Capitol buildings. The present building was designed by architect Cass Gilbert and completed in 1905. Its Beaux-Arts/American Renaissance design was influenced by the 1893 World&#x27;s Columbian Exposition in Chicago, and by McKim, Mead &amp; White&#x27;s Rhode Island State House. From 2013 to 2017 the building underwent an extensive restoration. This included replacing existing infrastructure; adding new mechanical systems; replacing or repairing tens of thousands of pieces of marble on the exterior; cleaning historic paintings, murals, and sculptures; and adding safety and accessibility features.

The building is set in a landscaped campus with the Capitol Mall on its south front, Leif Erikson Park on its west, and Judicial Plaza to its east. Various monuments and memorials are located in these green spaces.

==History==
===First Minnesota State Capitol===

The current State Capitol building is the third building to serve this purpose. The territorial legislature first met in a temporary headquarters in the Central House Hotel. In 1851, work began to oversee finances and the hiring of contractors to build the Capitol. Its architect, N. C. Prentiss drew up specifications for the new Capitol. Exterior details included brick work, cut stone floors and steps for the porches, a wood pediment, wood Ionic-style columns, and a well-framed roof covered with fireproof material. Interior work called for Norway pine flooring and staircases of oak and ash with oak handrails and turned balusters. The legislature moved into the new Capitol in time for the 5th territorial legislative session on January 4, 1854.

The population boomed after Minnesota became a state on May 11, 1858, and the Capitol building was expanded with a new wing on the Exchange Street side of the building in 1873 and a second wing facing Wabasha Street in 1878.

Despite efforts to make the Capitol fire-resistant, it was destroyed by fire on March 1, 1881. While legislators met in the evening, fire broke out in the dome of the Capitol and quickly spread. There were no deaths, but efforts to save the building failed. It was replaced on the same site in 1883 by the second Capitol building.

===Second Minnesota State Capitol===


After fire destroyed Minnesota&#x27;s first Capitol building, the second Capitol, a three-story, Romanesque, masonry building designed by Leroy Buffington, was completed in 1883 on the site of the first Capitol. Buffington designed the new building in the shape of a Greek cross. It featured a foundation of cut stone and walls of red brick with Dresbach sandstone trim. Each wing measured 150 feet in length. The main entrance on the southwest from Wabasha Street opened onto the first floor, where the governor, attorney general, auditor, treasurer, and secretary of state had offices. The Assembly (House of Representatives) chamber in the southeast wing featured a twenty-five-foot ceiling with a large stained glass skylight. The Senate chamber in the southwest wing was finished in yellow birch and birdseye maple. The Supreme Court chamber in the southeast wing featured woodwork of cherry and Hungarian ash.

Shortly after it opened, deficiencies of the new building were becoming clear. Overcrowding due to a lack of space, a lack of adequate fireproofing, and the discovery of dry rot made the building increasing unacceptable. Additionally, poor ventilation led in the push for a new Capitol building in 1893. It had served as the seat of Minnesota state government for just 10 years before state officials began planning a grander, more efficient Capitol. After the completion of the third State Capitol in 1905, the state used the old Capitol for meeting space, storage, and parking until its demolition in 1937. The site for the first and second Capitol buildings eventually became home to the former Arts and Science Building and McNally Smith Music Academy.

===Third Minnesota State Capitol===
The present state Capitol was designed by Cass Gilbert, whose design was selected by the Board of State Capitol Commissioners over 41 other submissions. Butler-Ryan Construction was selected as the contractor. Work began on the capitol in 1896, its corner-stone laid July 27, 1898, and construction was completed in 1905. The construction cost US$4.5 million. It opened its doors to the public for the first time on January 2, 1905. In 1893 Governor Knute Nelson appointed the seven-member Board of State Capitol Commissioners to oversee the construction of a new Capitol following the recommendation of the state legislature. The board oversaw every aspect of the work. This included supervising the expenditures, acquiring property, setting building specifications, selecting the architect and general contractor, and giving final approval for the type of stone to use on the exterior, as well as the art and artists.

The site selected by the commission was &quot;Wabasha Hill&quot;, bounded by Park Avenue, University Avenue, Cedar and Wabasha Streets, and Central Avenue. While this was the costliest of the four sites considered for the Capitol, it was the largest, and the Commission concluded that it was the best location for the building. Dozens of companies and hundreds of workers worked to complete the statehouse. Six workers were killed in accidents between 1898 and 1903 as a result of unsafe working conditions.

Upon completion, the building drew praise from the architecture community, leading to requests for Gilbert to design Capitol buildings for other states, such as West Virginia and Arkansas, and other notable structures.

Originally, the Capitol housed all the executive offices and the three branches of state government, state agencies and commissions, and the Minnesota Historical Society. Expansion of offices and meeting rooms, reconstruction of chambers, and subdivision of corridors occurred as early as the 1930s. As needs expanded, the state agencies and commissions, and over half of the executive offices, moved out of the Capitol to other buildings. One of the first to leave was the Minnesota Historical Society, which relocated to its own building (now the Minnesota Judicial Center) next to the Capitol in 1915. Most recently, the offices of the Senate moved to the newly constructed Minnesota Senate Building in January 2016.

The structure was added to the National Register of Historic Places in 1972.

== Architecture ==
The Minnesota Capitol is usually described as &quot;Beaux-Arts&quot;, a modern term not in use when the Capitol was built, but a style made popular in part by the architecture at the Chicago World&#x27;s Columbian Exposition in 1893. In addition to being influenced by his time at the World&#x27;s Columbian Exposition, the State Capitol&#x27;s architect Cass Gilbert was inspired by McKim, Mead &amp; White&#x27;s Rhode Island State House. Gilbert wrote a note in the margins on a 1912 article on his work stating that his plan of the Minnesota capitol had been greatly influenced by the one in Rhode Island.

The building&#x27;s structure consists of a steel and cast iron frame on rough limestone foundation walls resting on concrete footings. Guastavino tile vaulting forms the ceilings on both the ground and first floor. The structural elements of a building primarily consist of load-bearing brick and stone masonry walls and piers supporting steel-framed floor and roof systems. Care given in the construction of the original structure was so great that even far removed mechanical spaces not intended to be seen by the public were designed and built with a high standard of finish and design.

;Building Dimensions
East to west, the Capitol is more than long. From ground level to the top of the dome&#x27;s lantern measures . Inside, the building has more than of floor space, or about of space.
;Dome
The Minnesota State Capitol dome is the second largest self-supported marble dome in the world, behind Saint Peter&#x27;s Basilica in the Vatican, on which Gilbert based his design. The dome itself is actually made up of three domes or layers. The outer layer is a self-supporting dome made of Georgia marble blocks resting upon their own weight. Hidden inside is a brick and steel cone that supports the lantern and golden sphere at the top of the dome and provides an internal water drainage system, which helps avoid the heaving problem created by the freezing and thawing of Minnesota winters. Below that is the decorative masonry dome that can be seen from the inside, looking up from the rotunda. At the dome&#x27;s base are 12 marble eagles paired with the columns surrounding the drum of the dome. At the dome&#x27;s top is a columned stone lantern which is then topped by a finial globe covered in gold leaf.
;Stone
Because it was just over 30 years after the American Civil War when the building was designed, Gilbert drew ire for choosing marble from Georgia rather than native Minnesota granite for the exterior. Gilbert insisted on using Georgia white marble, saying that the use of a darker color would make it look &quot;glooming and forbidding&quot;. A compromise was made with native granite for the steps and the base and interior walls of Kasota limestone, while using the Georgia white marble for the vast majority of the buildings&#x27; exterior.

The steps of the two grand staircases in the east and west wings of the Capitol are made of Hauteville limestone, which resembles the Kasota limestone used through the walls of the Capitol but can take more wear. The 36 variegated columns surrounding the grand staircases are made from Breche Violette marble from Italy.

In the rotunda, the giant columns in the four open spaces are made from Minnesota granite. The deep bronze columns on the north and south were quarried near Ortonville, Minnesota and the purplish gray columns on the east and west were quarried near Rockville, Minnesota.

Dividing the statuary niches and the Kasota stone walls in the rotunda from the &quot;Civilization of the Northwest&quot; murals above them is a line of Sioux Quartzite from a quarry in Jasper, Minnesota. Previously it was thought to be Catlinite/Pipestone, which is prized by Native Americans, primarily those of the Plains nations for use in making ceremonial pipes. During the 2013-2017 renovation, the stone was tested and found not to be Catlinite.

==Artwork==


The State Capitol opened in 1905 with roughly 60 artworks that totaled $300,000, or 7% of the $4.5-million project budget. Over the years, more art has been added to the Capitol, totaling nearly 150 pieces in 2017.

Gilbert sought out many of the finest artists of the period, such as Kenyon Cox, Elmer Garnsey, Edwin Howland Blashfield, Henry Oliver Walker, Edward Emerson Simmons, John La Farge, Douglas Volk, Francis D. Millet, Howard Pyle, and Rufus Fairchild Zogbaum.

Much of the original art is allegorical. Gilbert&#x27;s trips to Europe encouraged his ideas, but he was more directly influenced by the 1893 World&#x27;s Columbian Exposition in Chicago. In particular, the inspiration for the Minnesota quadriga, a group of figures entitled &quot;Progress of the State&quot;, was the Columbus Quadriga, a statue depicting Christopher Columbus standing in a four horse chariot guided by two maidens carrying staffs of victory, that Daniel Chester French and Edward Clark Potter had modeled for the World&#x27;s Columbian Exposition of 1893 in Chicago. Gilbert saw this quadriga group at the Exposition and made plans to have artists adapt it for Minnesota.

As work continued on the interior, multiple groups, notably American Civil War veterans, the Minnesota Historical Society, and some politicians, demanded that the artwork in the Capitol illustrate historic events of Minnesota&#x27;s past. The current ornate look of the Governors Reception Room was partly a response to Minnesotans&#x27; suggestions for pictures from their own history which gave Gilbert the opportunity to upscale his plans for the room and to include six large paintings that span 200 years of the area&#x27;s history.

In 1944, the custom of displaying governors&#x27; portraits in the public corridors was initiated. In 1971, the Capitol Area Architectural Planning Board and the Minnesota Historical Society were entrusted to approve design, structural composition and location of all works of art.

== Interior ==
;Governors Reception Room
The Governors Reception Room, arguably the most elaborately decorated in the building, is a ceremonial room, designed for state receptions, proclamations, and press conferences.

Gilbert designed the elaborately decorated room, which was inspired by his earlier vacation in Europe, on the lines of a Venetian Council Chamber, with stained white oak woodwork and heavy molding gilded with gold leaf framing historical paintings.

The room&#x27;s ornate look was partly a response to Minnesotans&#x27; suggestions for pictures from their own history. Originally Gilbert had planned for the room to be much more modest. &quot;The executive rooms should be finished in perfectly plain color without elaborate decoration of any kind,&quot; Gilbert wrote in a 1903 letter to the Board. Responding to popular demand, the Board of State Capitol Commissioners authorized six paintings by four nationally known artists. Gilbert prepared plans for a more ornate room to accommodate paintings of historical subject matter, which were originally considered for the lunettes over the grand stair halls.

In 1968 the red drapes and leather furnishings were replaced with gold velvet curtains and modern armchairs covered in mustard yellow upholstery. With a space shortage in the Capitol, Governor LeVander decided the room should be converted to office use and closed off to the public. There was strong public objection to this temporary solution. Legislators and civic leaders worked to dissuade LeVander, and kept the Reception Room open to visitors. This controversy helped facilitate the recognition for the historic preservation and restoration of many Capitol spaces in the 1970s.

In 1978, when farmers converged on the Capitol to protest powerline construction on their farms, the message &quot;we want a moratorium on powerlines&quot; was carved into one of the antique tables after several hundred protesters crowded into the Reception Room.

;Decorations and symbols
One of several signature features of the Capitol is the brass and translucent glass eight-pointed star symbolizing Minnesota&#x27;s motto, &quot;L&#x27;Étoile du Nord&quot; (The Star of the North), which is set in a circle on the floor of the rotunda below the central dome. The star motif is then repeated in the marble floor of the rotunda with the points of the star using red Numidian marble from the Nile River. The star&#x27;s glass floor provides natural light to a State Capitol hearing room below. The motto can be seen in other areas of the Capitol stenciled on the walls.

Additional state symbols appear as details in unexpected settings. In a homage to Minnesota&#x27;s nickname, the &quot;Gopher State&quot;, life-sized cast iron gophers rear up on balustrades in the rotunda. The Lady Slipper was adopted as the state flower in 1902, during the Capitol&#x27;s construction. Gilbert had many of the Corinthian capitals adjusted to feature larger-than-life renditions of the wild orchid found in Minnesota&#x27;s northern forests.

The dome electrolier (chandelier) is lit every Statehood Day on May 11, commemorating when Minnesota became the 32nd state in the union on May 11, 1858.

;American Civil War themes

Gilbert had originally planned that art decorating the capitol interior would be mainly allegorical in nature. However, the Board of State Capitol Commissioners was approached by American Civil War veterans and Minnesota legislators who felt the artwork in the Capitol should depict real events in the states past rather than allegorical imagery. In particular they wanted recognition of Minnesota&#x27;s military units. Additional funds were lacking to build a desired immense obelisk outside the Capitol that was to be the memorial to veterans. These issues convinced Gilbert to amend his vision and include Civil War homages inside the Capitol building.

Four of the six paintings originally installed in the Governor&#x27;s Reception Room included Civil war themes, as did the two paintings in the Governor&#x27;s Anteroom. Gilbert originally seemed to want any statues in the second floor rotunda niches to be Minnesota Senators or U.S. Presidents; however, the statues finally installed between 1909 and 1914 were of Civil War veterans. Years after the construction was done, more plaques and benches memorializing Minnesotans who served in the Civil War were added between the 1920s and 1930s as the result of lobbying done by veterans groups and legislators. While there is no official designation, quality and volume of American Civil War art and historic artifacts in the capitol building gives the semblance the Capitol being a memorial to Civil War veterans.

==Capitol Mall==


On the Capitol&#x27;s south front is the State Capitol Mall, which includes eighteen acres of green space. Over the years, monuments and memorials have been added to the mall. The mall and the Capitol building itself are overseen by the Capitol Area Architectural and Planning Board (CAAPB), a small state agency consisting of twelve members.

Cass Gilbert envisioned his State Capitol building in a setting of plazas and axial and radial avenues, but his commission was initially limited to the building only due to lack of funds.

As time went on, the aging neighborhood surrounding the Capitol increasingly deteriorated. Work to transform the area and to develop at least partially Gilbert&#x27;s vision of landscaped grand boulevards providing key approaches to the capitol began after World War II. The work was largely complete by 1955, leaving the State Capitol Mall with the overall form that still provides the setting for the Minnesota State Capitol.

== 2013 to 2017 Renovation ==

The Minnesota State Capitol underwent a comprehensive restoration project from 2013 to 2017, the first major renovation since the building first opened.

Work began in 2013, with the project estimated at that time to cost $241 million, funded via a series of appropriations made by the Minnesota legislature. The project repaired and modernized deteriorating building systems, restored the building to Cass Gilbert&#x27;s original architectural vision, increased public meeting space (including a new classroom for the Minnesota Historical Society to host school groups and provide information about the building), updated life safety systems, and improved accessibility for people with disabilities.

3-D modeling was used to incorporate details about materials and other characteristics of particular parts of the structure. It was used to help with aspects of planning which included the positioning of new HVAC units that required the doubling of ductwork in order to meet modern code requirements but not be noticed or mar the historic character of the building. The laser scanning done to confirm the accuracy of the digital model also showed that Gilbert&#x27;s original architectural drawings proved to be very accurate to what was built.

The original Georgia marble stone on the exterior had badly deteriorated from weathering, and underwent comprehensive restoration that included 20,000 repairs with 6,000 pieces replaced. The stone was obtained from the same quarry as the original marble. Some historic details removed during previous renovations, were restored or recreated such as the Capitol&#x27;s public elevators on the south side of the building which were outfitted with leaded-glass fronts reminiscent of the originals which had been discarded and replaced by stainless steel doors in the late 1960s.

The amount of public space in the building was doubled to nearly 40,000 square feet, with a number of new public spaces opened to the public for reservation and use year round. Mechanical systems in the Capitol&#x27;s basement were buried under the floor to help create new public spaces including the Etoile du Nord Vault event space directly under the rotunda.

The project also included a restoration of the capitol&#x27;s many works of fine art, which prompted discussions over some paintings in the building that feature controversial depictions of American Indians. A series of public input meetings were held around the state to gather feedback and consider options for new policies regarding art in the renovated building. When the building reopened, two of these paintings, , and the were relocated while others remained in place.

The renovation forced the House and Senate to hold a special session in the nearby State Office Building in 2015. During the regular 2016 session, the Senate met in the newly completed Senate Office Building, with the capitol open for only limited access to the House chamber during the session.

By the time of its completion in 2017, the total cost of the renovation project reached about $310 million. The bulk of construction was completed by the start of the 2017 legislative session in January. The project was officially completed in August 2017, at which point all of the building&#x27;s newly renovated spaces opened to the public.

==Public access==
After its current restoration, the removal of office spaces on the third floor and mechanical and storage spaces in the basement opened up new public gathering spaces, meeting rooms, and exhibit areas, many of which can be reserved for use by members of the public. The Minnesota Historical Society operates the Capitol Information and Tour Center. The building is open to the public most days of the week, and guided tours are available. Tours on special topics surrounding the Capitol occur throughout the year. The Minnesota State Capitol Third Floor Gallery features rotating non-permanent exhibits featuring Minnesota art, culture, and history.

==Biography==
Krumov was born in Stara Zagora, Bulgaria on 6 August 1934. He studied choral conducting with Professor Georgi Dimitrov at the Pancho Vladigerov State Academy of Music (Sofia), from which he graduated in 1957. During his studies and as a result of the influence of Filip Kutev he became interested in Bulgarian folk music, which became his main field of work. 

In 1957 he founded the &quot;Dobrudja Folk Ensemble&quot;, which he directed until 1982. He became then Director of the folk ensemble &quot;Silistra&quot;, until 1988. 

Krumov was a member of the jury in many folklore festivals, both International and Bulgarian. He received several awards, among them the Golden Medal at the National Folklore Competition (1959, 1964, 1969 and 1984). He was a holder of the Order of Saint Cyril and Saint Methodius II Rank. Krumov was also author of several books and articles on Bulgarian folklore and music.

Krumov died in Dobrich, Bulgaria on 20 December 2021, at the age of 87.

<text>Lafayette Hill is an unincorporated community, which is situated primarily within Whitemarsh Township, Montgomery County, Pennsylvania. A small part of this community is also located in Springfield Township.

Located just west of Philadelphia&#x27;s Chestnut Hill neighborhood, and south of Plymouth Meeting, Lafayette Hill, which has also been known, historically, as &quot;Barren Hill,&quot; draws its name from the French General Marquis de Lafayette, who encamped there with his soldiers during the American Revolution.

==History==
Before the general decampment from Valley Forge in the spring of 1778, George Washington dispatched an estimated 2,200 troops under the command of Marquis de Lafayette to act as a defensive screen and to conduct reconnaissance of the British army, which had garrisoned in Philadelphia for the winter. The two forces had a brief engagement at nearby Barren Hill.

The community&#x27;s post office name was officially changed from Barren Hill to Lafayette Hill in March 1883.

Lafayette Hill is an area with many parks and nature reserves. It is home to a Jewish community and Catholic population anchored by St. Philip Neri Church, Congregation Or Ami, and Whitemarsh Valley Country Club. Many people commute to Philadelphia to work. Its main transit system is SEPTA.

Lafayette Hill is home to the Barren Hill Volunteer Fire Company, one of the oldest fire companies in the area. It was founded after a fire destroyed a farm along with several livestock in 1915. Currently, Barren Hill Fire Company has roughly 400 to 500 calls for service each year. Their 1977 firehouse is located on 641 Germantown Pike. Whitemarsh Township is also served by the Spring Mill Fire Company.

Lafayette Hill is served by the Colonial School District.

Notable people from Lafayette Hill, Pennsylvania include: Terrence Howard, John Salmons, Da&#x27;Rel Scott, Brad Furman, Reece Whitley, billionaire Michael G. Rubin,

<text>A military base is a facility directly owned and operated by or for the military or one of its branches that shelters military equipment and personnel, and facilitates training and operations. A military base always provides accommodations for one or more units, but it may also be used as a command center, training ground or proving ground. In most cases, military bases rely on outside help to operate. However, certain complex bases are able to endure on their own for long periods because they are able to provide food, drinking water, and other necessities for their inhabitants while under siege. Bases for military aviation are called air bases. Bases for military ships are called naval bases.

== Jurisdictional definition ==

Military bases within the United States are considered federal property and are subject to federal law. Civilians (such as family members of military officers) living on military bases are generally subject to the civil and criminal laws of the states where the bases are located. Military bases can range from small outposts to military cities containing up to 100,000 people. A military base may belong to a different nation or state than the territory surrounding it.

== Naming ==

The name used generally refers to the type of military activity that takes place at the base, as well as the traditional nomenclature used by a branch of service.

A military base may go by any of a number of names, such as the following:

* Ammunition dump
* Armory
* Arsenal
* Advance airfield
* Barracks
* Border outpost
* Cantonment
* Casern
* Combat outpost (COP)
* Facility
* Fire support base (FSB, FB)
* Forward Operating Base (FOB)
* Forward operating site (FOS)
* Fortification
* Garrison
* Installation
* Joint base
* Magazine
* Main Operating Base (MOB)
* Marine Corps base
* Military airbase, airfield or field
* Military camp
* Missile launch facility
* Naval air station
* Naval base
* Naval dockyard
* Naval shipyard
* Observation post
* Outpost (OP)
* Presidio
* Proving ground
* Reservation
* Satellite airfield
* Station
* Submarine base
* Training camp
== Types of establishment ==

Depending on the context, the term &quot;military base&quot; may refer to any establishment (usually permanent) that houses a nation&#x27;s armed forces, or even organized paramilitary forces such as the police, constabulary, militia, or national guards. Alternatively, the term may refer solely to an establishment which is used only by an army (or possibly other land fighting related forces, such as marines) to the exclusion of a base used by either an air force or a navy. This is consistent with the different meanings of the word &#x27;military&#x27;.

Some examples of permanent military bases used by the navies and air forces of the world are the HMNB Portsmouth in Portsmouth, UK, the Naval Air Station Whidbey Island, Washington State, US, or Ramstein Air Base, Germany (the last two are each designated as a Main Operating Base). Other examples of non- or semi-permanent military bases include a Forward Operating Base (FOB), a Logistics Base (Log base) and a Fire Base (FB).

A military base may also contain large concentrations of military supplies in order to support military logistics. Most military bases are restricted to the public and usually only authorized personnel may enter them (be it military personnel or their relatives and authorized civilian personnel).

In addition to the main military facilities on a certain installation, military bases usually (but not always) have various different facilities for military personnel. These facilities vary from country to country. Military bases can provide housing for military personnel, a post office and dining facilities (restaurants). They may also provide support facilities such as fast food restaurants, gas stations, chapels, schools, banks, thrift stores, a hospital or clinic (dental or health clinics, as well as veterinarian clinics), lodging, movie theaters, and, in some countries, retail stores (usually a supermarket such as Commissary and a Department Store, such as AAFES). On American military installations, Family, Morale, Welfare and Recreation (FMWR) provides facilities such as fitness centers, libraries, golf courses, travel centers, community service centers, campgrounds, child development centers, youth centers, automotive workshops, hobby/arts and crafts centers, bowling centers, and community centers.

Bases used by the United States Air Force Reserve tend to be active USAF bases. However, there are a few Air Reserve Bases, such as Dobbins ARB, Georgia, and Grissom ARB, Indiana, both of which are former active-duty USAF bases. Facilities of the Air National Guard are often located on civil airports in a secure cantonment area not accessible to the general public, though some units are based on USAF bases, and a few ANG-operated bases, such as Selfridge ANGB, Michigan. Support facilities on Air National Guard and Air Force Reserve installations tend to not be as extensive as active bases (i.e., they usually do not have on-base lodging (though Kingsley Field ANGB, Oregon, is an exception), clinics (except for drill days), or retail stores (although some have small convenience stores)).

In Russian usage &quot;military base&quot; or &quot;naval base&quot; is not limited to denoting a specific fence described facility and usually encompasses a broad territory within which a number of discrete facilities may be located. As examples, 1) the Russian Sevastopol Naval Base comprises individual facilities located within the city of Sevastopol proper (waterfront moorings, weapons stores, a headquarters compound, and a naval infantry base) as well as an airfield at Kacha north of the city; 2) the Leningrad Naval Base comprises all naval facilities in the greater St. Petersburg area including training schools, commissioning institutes, the naval academy, and the Kronshtadt base on Kotlin island.

==Overseas military base==

An overseas military base is a military base that is geographically located outside of the territory of the country whose armed forces are the principal occupants of the base.

Such bases may be established by treaties between the governing power in the host country and another country which needs to establish the military base in the host country for various reasons, usually strategic and logistic.

Furthermore, overseas military bases often serve as the source of the military brat subculture due to the children of the bases&#x27; occupant military being born or raised in the host country but raised with a remote parental knowledge of the occupant military&#x27;s home country.

== British military bases ==
In the 18th and 19th centuries the Royal Engineers were largely responsible for erecting military bases in the British Isles and the British Empire. In 1792 the Chief Engineer was instructed to prepare the Barrack Construction estimates for Parliament and at the same time the Department of the Barrackmaster-General was established.

During the period from the 1840s through the 1860s barracks were constructed under supervision of the Royal Engineers in:
* Bristol (1847)
* Preston (1848)
* Tower of London (1851)
* Sheerness (1854)
* Sheffield (1854)
* Curragh Camp (1855)
* Devonport (1856)
* Chelsea (1861)

The Cardwell Reforms (1872) ushered in another period of intensive Barrack building at Aldershot, Portsmouth, Plymouth, London, Woking, Woolwich, Dublin, Belfast, Malta, Gibraltar and the Cape of Good Hope.

In 1959 the Corps&#x27; Work Services was transferred to the civilian War Department Works Organization (later renamed Property Services Agency (PSA)) and by 1965 the (Specialist Teams Royal Engineers (STRE)) were formed to plan and execute Works projects worldwide.

Some British and Commonwealth naval bases are traditionally named, commissioned, and administered as though they were naval ships. For this reason they are sometimes called stone frigates.

<doc id="843580" wikidata="Q1578792" url="?curid=843580" title="Pillar (Lake District)">
<text>Pillar is a mountain in the western part of the English Lake District. Situated between the valleys of Ennerdale to the north and Wasdale to the south, it is the highest point of the Pillar group (some dozen fells clustered round it). At it is the eighth-highest mountain in the Lake District. The fell takes its name from Pillar Rock, a prominent feature on the Ennerdale side, regarded as the birthplace of rock climbing in the district.

==Topography==
The Western Fells occupy a triangular sector of the Lake District, bordered by the River Cocker to the north east and Wasdale to the south east. Westwards the hills diminish toward the coastal plain of Cumberland. At the central hub of the high country are Great Gable and its satellites, while two principal ridges fan out on either flank of Ennerdale, the western fells in effect being a great horseshoe around this long wild valley. Pillar is on the southern arm.

The main watershed runs broadly westwards from Great Gable, dividing the headwaters of Ennerdale and Wasdale. The principal fells in this section are Kirk Fell, Pillar, Scoat Fell, Haycock and Caw Fell, followed by the lower Lank Rigg group.

Pillar stands on the southern wall of Ennerdale, from the head of the valley. Two tiers of impressive crags run the full length of the fell from Wind Gap in the west to Black Sail Pass in the east. The top tier fronts the summit ridge, a series of coves being interspersed between the buttresses. Below is a narrow terrace bearing the &#x27;High Level Route&#x27; path and then a further wall including Pillar Rock, Raven and Ash Crags and Proud Knott. The lower slopes are planted with a broad belt of conifers, extending across the River Liza to the flanks of High Crag.

The southern flank of Pillar looks down on Mosedale, the more westerly of Wasdale&#x27;s two main feeder valleys. From Wasdale Head village Pillar appears to stand at the head of Mosedale, but the valley curves out of sight, actually having its source on the slopes of Scoat Fell. The Mosedale slopes cannot compete with those above Ennerdale, although there is outcropping rock, particularly at Wistow Crags, Elliptical Crag and Murl Rigg.

The summit of Pillar is at the western end, immediately above the descent to Wind Gap (). This continues the watershed to Scoat Fell and beyond. A subsidiary spur branches off north-west of the summit, passing over White Pike before petering out in the Ennerdale Forest. The eastern ridge of Pillar stretches for about a mile, gradually descending before the final upthrust of Looking Stead. This subsidiary top is listed as a Nuttall in its own right. Beyond is Black Sail Pass, a pedestrian route between Wasdale and the head of Ennerdale. Kirk Fell stands on the other side of the pass.

==Geology==
The primary rock types in the summit area are the plagioclase-phyric andesite lavas of the Birker Fell Formation. Bands of volcaniclastic sandstone and andesite sills are also present. Rhyolite and lapilli tuff appear amongst the northern crags, with outcrops of the Craghouse Member on the north-west ridge.

==Ecology==
Pillar and Ennerdale Fells is a Site of Special Scientific Interest.

==Summit==
The summit is surprisingly wide and grassy, consisting patches of stones interspersed with short turf. An Ordnance Survey triangulation column stands beside a cairn and windshelter. At the northern edge of the plateau a further windshelter marks the descent to the mountain rescue stretcher-box and the High Level Route.

The view is excellent with all of the major fells except the Coniston range in sight. Loweswater and Ennerdale Water can be seen, together with Burnmoor Tarn. From the north windshelter there is a striking view of the summit of Pillar Rock.

==Ascent routes==
Pillar is usually climbed from Wasdale Head, by far the nearest road access. The simplest route involves taking the Black Sail Pass, the main foot pass between Wasdale and Ennerdale, to its highest point (around ), then ascending the mountain&#x27;s relatively gentle east ridge. Greater interest may be obtained by branching off the ridge (at &quot;c.&quot; ) onto the &quot;High Level Route&quot;, a narrow path which traverses around Pillar&#x27;s northern crags before approaching the summit from the north, affording good views of Pillar Rock. Many walkers based in Wasdale climb Pillar as part of the Mosedale Horseshoe, a circuit of the skyline one of Wasdale&#x27;s side valleys, which also includes Scoat Fell, Red Pike and Yewbarrow; Kirk Fell may also optionally be included.

Pillar may also be climbed from Ennerdale. From the YHA youth hostel at Black Sail at the head of the valley, it is a fairly short walk (around 1.5 km and 300 m of ascent, that is and of ascent) to the summit of Black Sail Pass, from where the same routes can be followed as described above. As Black Sail hostel is from the nearest public road, this approach is somewhat impractical to day-trippers (especially since the Ennerdale valley is itself remote from the main tourist centres of the Lake District), though attractive to those staying at the hostel. Alternatively, there are various paths up the mountain from lower down the valley which offer the possibility of closer acquaintance with the crags of the north face.

For strong walkers, other more accessible approaches are feasible which have the advantage of being more accessible than Wasdale from major tourist centres such as Keswick.

Firstly, from the Buttermere valley, climb then descend the Scarth Gap Pass between Gatesgarth and Black Sail, which then allows an ascent via Black Sail Pass as detailed above. The walk from Gatesgarth to the summit of Pillar and back involves over of ascent, more if the High Level Route is taken.

Secondly, for a round trip from the Honister Pass, contour round the head of Ennerdale by following the Moses Trod footpath to Beck Head col between Great Gable and Kirk Fell, then taking the path under Kirk Fell to the head of Black Sail Pass, before proceeding, by either of the routes described above, to Pillar Rock or summit. A variation from the Honister Pass is to descend to Ennerdale via the good path (steps) alongside Loft Beck, then ascend Black Sail Pass as before.

==Pillar Rock==
Pillar Rock is a large rocky outcrop surrounded by cliffs on the northern side of Pillar, well below the summit. When seen from Ennerdale it looks like a tall and thin column, hence its name. In the early 19th century it became widely known as one of the wonders of the Lake District, chiefly due to its featuring in William Wordsworth&#x27;s poem &quot;The Brothers&quot;.

The first recorded ascent of Pillar Rock was made in 1826 by John Atkinson of Croftfoot, Ennerdale. His route, known as the Old West Route, is still classed as a rock climb, albeit one graded Moderate, the second lowest grade on the British system. It is the earliest recorded rock climb in the Lake District (not counting Coleridge&#x27;s inadvertent descent of Scafell in 1802); subsequent Lakeland climbers also concentrated on Pillar, and by 1872 four different climbing routes had been pioneered on the rock. The easiest route to the top of Pillar Rock is now considered to be the Slab and Notch route, classed as a grade 3 scramble, whilst the classic route is the New West, classed as a Difficult rock climb. By 2007 over 90 climbs had been recorded, including 17 graded E1 or above.

By 1913, George Mallory seconded by Alan Goodfellow, climbed Pillar Rock by what is now known as &quot;Mallory&#x27;s Route&quot; – currently graded Hard Very Severe 5a (American grading 5.9) – similar in difficulty to The Second Step on Mount Everest.

Pillar Rock has a topographic prominence of more than , and thus qualifies for the list of &quot;Nuttalls&quot; compiled by John and Anne Nuttall in their book &quot;The Mountains of England and Wales&quot; (see also Hill lists in the British Isles).
It is the only summit on the list that cannot be reached without recourse to rock climbing.

<doc id="843583" wikidata="Q7687447" url="?curid=843583" title="Tasmanian Devils (2001–2008)">
<text>The Tasmanian Devils was an Australian rules football club based in Tasmania that competed in the Victorian Football League (VFL).

Owned and run by AFL Tasmania, the club took part in the VFL from 2001 to 2008 as the only non-Victorian club in the league.

The club participated in 157 official VFA/VFL matches during its eight season tenure recording a 59-96-2 playing record, recording its highest finish of Preliminary Finalist in 2004, where they were defeated by eventual premier, Sandringham.

The Devils played the majority of their home games at Bellerive Oval in Hobart alongside regular fixtures at York Park in Launceston. At the end of the 2008 season, AFL Tasmania decided to withdraw the Devils from the VFL in favour of restarting a new Tasmanian league encompassing the entire state.

Tasmania will return to the VFL in 2025 or 2026 after a successful Tasmanian AFL bid in 2023, with the new AFL team, Tasmania Devils, to field a side before entering the AFL in 2028.

==History==
During the 1990s, Tasmania had shown strong interest in joining the Australian Football League (AFL), and after rejected bids in 1995 and 1997, the AFL instigated the formation a Tasmanian team for the newly re-constructed Victorian Football League (VFL). The Tasmanian Devils formed in 2001 and were admitted into the VFL in its inaugural season the same year. The AFL continued to own the club.

The nickname &quot;Devils&quot; was chosen as the moniker for the club after the tenacious marsupial predator the Tasmanian devil, which is indigenous to the island of Tasmania. The club colours of green, red, gold and black were inspired by the original State of Origin &quot;map&quot; guernsey and are also Tasmania&#x27;s sporting colours.

The Devils established home grounds in both Hobart and Launceston to deal with the long-standing north–south rivalry. Originally, northern home games were played at Launceston&#x27;s York Park, while North Hobart Oval hosted games in the south. Occasional games were played in the north west, with Ulverstone, Devonport and Burnie each hosting a couple of games across the club&#x27;s tenure.

The Devils&#x27; first two seasons brought mediocre results, but, under the direction of coach Matthew Armstrong, they made the finals for the first time in 2003, finishing third. The 2004 and 2005 seasons saw the Devils again make the finals. At the end of the 2005 season, the team moved from North Hobart Oval to Bellerive Oval for home games in the south and began playing all northern home games at York Park.

Following the trend of AFL clubs aligning themselves with VFL clubs for the match fitness of reserves players, in 2005, the Kangaroos expressed intentions to align with the Devils. A deal was struck that allowed a capped number of players from the Kangaroos to compete with either the Devils or North Ballarat in the VFL, starting in the 2006 season. This arrangement lasted two years and was unpopular among local fans, significantly harming the popularity of the club.

2006 proved to be a disappointment on-field, with the Devils finishing ninth and missing the finals. During the season, Armstrong had stepped down as coach due to internal pressure from the playing group, ending his six-year term in charge of the Devils. North Hobart premiership coach and former Devils player Brendon Bolton was made stand-in coach for the remainder of the year.

Tasmanian and former Sydney player Daryn Cresswell was named coach of the club for 2007, after a successful career as an assistant coach at Geelong and the Brisbane Lions. However, hampered in part by Cresswell&#x27;s off-field issues, which included a gambling addiction and eventual fraud conviction, the club finished wooden spooners both seasons he coached the team, winning only six of a total 34 games.

At the end of the 2008 season, AFL Tasmania decided to withdraw the Devils from the VFL in favour of restarting a new Tasmanian league encompassing the entire state.

<doc id="843612" wikidata="Q180228" url="?curid=843612" title="Smallville">
<text>Smallville is an American superhero television series developed by writer-producers Alfred Gough and Miles Millar, based on the DC Comics character Superman created by Jerry Siegel and Joe Shuster. The series was produced by Millar/Gough Ink, Tollin/Robbins Productions, DC Comics, and Warner Bros. Television. Initially broadcast by the WB, the show premiered on October 16, 2001. After its fifth season, the WB and UPN merged to form The CW, the series&#x27; later United States broadcaster until its tenth and final season ended on May 13, 2011.

&quot;Smallville&quot; follows the coming-of-age adventures of teenage Clark Kent (Tom Welling) in his fictional hometown of Smallville, Kansas, before he formally becomes the Man of Steel. The first four seasons focus on the high school life of Clark and his friends, his complicated romance with neighbor girl Lana Lang (Kristin Kreuk), and his friendship with future nemesis Lex Luthor (Michael Rosenbaum). From season five onwards, &quot;Smallville&quot; ventures into Clark&#x27;s early adult years, eventually focusing on his career alongside Lois Lane (Erica Durance) at the &quot;Daily Planet&quot; and introducing other DC comic book superheroes and villains.

Before the production, &quot;Bruce Wayne&quot;, a drama series chronicling the young protagonist&#x27;s journey toward Batman, was proposed first. Although that series failed to generate interest, it inspired the idea of a Superman origin story, which later became &quot;Smallville&quot;. &quot;Gotham&quot; later used that idea three years after &quot;Smallville&quot;″s conclusion.

Series developers Gough and Millar pitched their &quot;no tights, no flights&quot; rule to the president of Warner Bros. Television, reducing the Man of Steel to the bare moral essentials and examining what led Clark Kent to become the iconic superhero. After seven seasons with the show, Gough and Millar departed with little explanation. &quot;Smallville&quot; was primarily filmed in and around Vancouver, British Columbia, with local businesses and buildings substituting for Smallville locations. Most of the music for the first six seasons was composed by Mark Snow, who incorporated elements of John Williams&#x27;s musical score from the &quot;Superman&quot; film series. Louis Febre (who worked with Snow from the beginning) became the series&#x27; primary composer in season seven.

&quot;Smallville&quot; was generally positively received when it began. Former &quot;Superman&quot; star Christopher Reeve approved of the series, making two guest appearances before his death. The pilot episode set a ratings record for a WB debut, with 8.4 million viewers. Over ten seasons, the series averaged about 4.34 million viewers per episode, with season two the highest-rated at 6.3 million. By the end of its run, &quot;Smallville&quot; passed &quot;Stargate SG-1&quot; as the longest-running North American science fiction series by episode count. Since its first season, the series has received accolades ranging from Emmys to Teen Choice Awards. &quot;Smallville&quot; spawned a series of young adult novels, a DC Comics bimonthly comic book, soundtracks, and series-related merchandise. All ten seasons are available on DVD in regions 1, 2, and 4. After the series finale in 2011, the story resumed in comic book form, with 22 issues of &quot;Season 11&quot; from April 2012 to November 2013.
==Series overview==

The regular cast is introduced in season one, with storylines involving a villain deriving power from kryptonite exposure. The one-episode villains were a plot device developed by Gough and Millar. &quot;Smallville&quot;″s first season primarily dealt with Clark Kent&#x27;s coming to terms with his alien origin and the revelation that his arrival on Earth was connected to the death of Lana Lang&#x27;s parents. 

After the first season the series had fewer villain-of-the-week episodes, focusing instead on individual-character story arcs and exploring Clark&#x27;s origins. Major storylines include Clark&#x27;s discovery of his Kryptonian heritage and Lex Luthor&#x27;s escalating conflict with his father, Lionel. The disembodied voice of Clark&#x27;s biological father, Jor-El, is introduced; he communicates to Clark through his spaceship, setting the stage for plots involving his role in fulfilling Clark&#x27;s earthly destiny. 

In a fourth-season arc Clark, instructed by Jor-El, searches for three Kryptonian stones which contain the knowledge of the universe and form his Fortress of Solitude. Clark battles Brainiac in his attempts to release the Kryptonian criminal General Zod, and must capture (or destroy) other escaped Phantom Zone criminals. His cousin Kara arrives, and Lex Luthor discovers Clark&#x27;s secret. 

The eighth season introduces Davis Bloome (&quot;Smallville&quot;″s version of Doomsday), and Tess Mercer replaces the departing Lex Luthor. Justin Hartley becomes a series regular as Oliver Queen (Green Arrow) after being a recurring guest in season six. 

In the ninth season Major Zod (Callum Blue) and other members of Zod&#x27;s military group are revived (without their Kryptonian powers) by Tess Mercer, and their efforts to regain their powers are the season&#x27;s central conflict. 

The final season revolves around Clark&#x27;s attempts to lose his doubts and fears and become the hero he is meant to be, while confronting his biggest challenges: the coming of Darkseid and the return of Lex Luthor.

==Cast==

* Tom Welling as Clark Kent, a young man with superhuman abilities who tries to find his place in life after discovering that he is an extraterrestrial in origin and uses his powers to help those in danger. Clark&#x27;s season-one problems include his inability to share his secret and his desire for a normal life. After months of scouting, Welling was cast as Clark. David Nutter had to convince Welling&#x27;s manager that the role would not hurt the actor&#x27;s film career in order to get Welling to read the pilot script. After reading the script, Welling agreed to audition for the role of Clark Kent. Tom Welling operated under a strict &quot;No Tights, No Flights&quot; rule to stay true to the origin story element of the show.
* Kristin Kreuk as Lana Lang, the girl next door. Grieving the loss of her parents, she has empathy for everyone and feels connected to Clark. Kreuk was the first to be cast, after Nutter saw an audition tape the actress had sent. Although she left the series after the seventh season,&lt;ref name=&quot;Kristin/Mike&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; she returned for five episodes in season eight as a special guest star.
* Michael Rosenbaum as Lex Luthor, a billionaire&#x27;s son sent to Smallville to run the local fertilizer plant. After Clark saves his life, they become fast friends. As the series progresses, Lex&#x27;s friendship with Clark crumbles until they consider themselves enemies. The role was difficult to cast; Michael Rosenbaum auditioned twice and, feeling that he did not take his first audition seriously enough, outlined a two-and-a-half-page scene indicating where to be funny, charismatic or menacing. His second audition went so well that he was hired. Rosenbaum left the show after seven seasons, reprising his role for the series finale.
* Eric Johnson as Whitney Fordman, Lana&#x27;s boyfriend in season one, who becomes mean to Clark and Lana&#x27;s budding friendship and bullies him. He reconciles with Clark before joining the Marines and going to Afghanistan. Although Whitney was written out of the show in the first-season finale, he made a special appearance in the season-two episode &quot;Visage&quot; (where it is disclosed that he was killed in action) and was also a guest star in the season-four episode &quot;Façade&quot; (during a flashback to Clark&#x27;s freshman year of high school). Johnson, who auditioned for Lex and Clark before he was cast as Whitney, was pleased that the writers gave his character a hero&#x27;s exit.
* Sam Jones III as Pete Ross, another best friend of Clark and the first person to whom Clark voluntarily tells his secret. Although he is in love with Chloe, he does not admit it because of the Clark-Lana-Chloe love triangle already in place. Ross was written out of the series at the end of season three, but made a guest appearance in season seven. Jones was the last of the series regulars to be cast, with Gough and Millar seeing him four days before they began filming the pilot. Jones is African-American while the comics have traditionally portrayed Ross as Caucasian.
* Allison Mack as Chloe Sullivan, one of Clark&#x27;s best friends, who is in love with him (although her feelings are not reciprocated). Editor of the school newspaper, her journalistic curiosity and desire to &quot;expose falsehoods&quot; and &quot;know the truth&quot; create tension with her friends (especially when she investigates Clark&#x27;s past). After learning about &quot;Smallville&quot; from casting director Dee Dee Bradley, Mack considered auditioning for Lana Lang but auditioned twice for Chloe Sullivan. The character was created just for the series and was intended to have an &quot;ethnic background&quot; before Mack was hired. She has since appeared in the comic book.
* Annette O&#x27;Toole as Martha Kent, Clark&#x27;s adoptive mother. She and her husband, Jonathan, give Clark wise advice about coping with his increasing abilities. In season five Martha takes a state-senate seat, and in season six she leaves the show. Although Cynthia Ettinger was originally cast as Martha Kent, during filming everyone (including Ettinger) realized that she was not right for the part. O&#x27;Toole was committed to the television series &quot;The Huntress&quot; when Ettinger filmed the original pilot. Around the time the creators wanted to recast Martha Kent, &quot;The Huntress&quot; was coincidentally canceled, allowing O&#x27;Toole to join the cast. The actress had previously played Lana Lang in &quot;Superman III&quot;.
* John Schneider as Jonathan Kent, Clark&#x27;s adoptive father, who goes to great lengths to protect his son&#x27;s secret; according to Schneider, Jonathan is &quot;perfectly willing to go to jail, or worse, to protect his son&quot;. Schneider was written out of the show in the series&#x27; 100th episode, with Jonathan dying of a heart attack on the night of his election victory. Millar and Gough wanted a recognizable face for &quot;Smallville&quot;; they were happy to cast Schneider as Jonathan because he was known as Bo Duke from &quot;The Dukes of Hazzard&quot;, which Gough saw as adding to the belief that Schneider could have grown up running a farm.
* John Glover as Lionel Luthor, Lex&#x27;s father. Lionel is responsible for the Kents&#x27; adoption of Clark without legal ramifications or questions about his origins. Glover tried to make Lionel seem to try to &quot;toughen [Lex] up&quot;, and saw the character as a rich, powerful businessman who was disappointed in his son. Lionel was created for &quot;Smallville&quot; to parallel the Kents and as an &quot;experiment in extreme parenting&quot;. A recurring first-season guest, Glover became a series regular from seasons two to seven until Lionel was murdered by Lex near the end of the seventh season. Lionel returns in a parallel-universe version, also portrayed by Glover, during the final season as a special guest star.
* Jensen Ackles as Jason Teague, Lana&#x27;s love interest, in season four. He follows Lana to Smallville from Paris, taking a job as the school&#x27;s assistant football coach, but is fired when their relationship comes to light. By the end of the season, it is disclosed that he was working with his mother to track the three Kryptonian stones of knowledge. Before he was cast as Jason, Ackles was second in line for the role of Clark Kent. Although he received top billing for season four and was contracted for season five, he was written out of the show in the season four finale because of his commitment to &quot;Supernatural&quot;.

* Erica Durance as Lois Lane, Chloe&#x27;s cousin who comes to Smallville to investigate Chloe&#x27;s supposed death and stays with the Kents. Durance, a recurring guest in season four, became a series regular. The producers wanted to bring Lois Lane to the series, and Chloe&#x27;s supposed death in the season-three finale provided the opportunity. Durance was cast three days before filming began; although she could initially appear in only four episodes, according to the film division of Warner Bros., after negotiations her character was cleared for more appearances.
* Aaron Ashmore as Jimmy Olsen, Chloe&#x27;s photographer boyfriend who works at the &quot;Daily Planet&quot;. Ashmore, a recurring guest in season six, became a regular cast member in season seven. He called his casting a welcome surprise: &quot;I auditioned for [the role] and I put myself on tape. I hadn&#x27;t heard anything, and a couple of weeks later, all of the sudden (sic), I got the call saying, &#x27;You&#x27;re going to Vancouver to start shooting Smallville&#x27;. It&#x27;s a dream come true, really&quot;. After three seasons on the series (two as a regular), Ashmore&#x27;s character was killed off by Davis Bloome out of jealousy for his relationship with Chloe. Although Ashmore&#x27;s Jimmy Olsen was murdered, he said his character was not the &quot;real&quot; Jimmy Olsen, his real name revealed to be Henry James Olsen. Jimmy&#x27;s younger brother, who appears briefly in the season-eight finale, is intended to be the Jimmy who works with Clark and Lois. Ashmore returns as the younger Jimmy in the series finale.
* Laura Vandervoort as Kara Zor-El, Clark&#x27;s Kryptonian cousin. Sent to look after Kal-El (Clark), she was in suspended animation for eighteen years. When the dam confining Kara&#x27;s ship broke in the season-six finale, &quot;Phantom&quot;, she was set free. She has Clark&#x27;s abilities, including flight. At the end of the seventh season, Kara was trapped in the Phantom Zone. Although Vandervoort did not return regularly for the eighth season, she returned to wrap up her storylines as a guest in season eight&#x27;s &quot;Bloodline&quot; and as a special guest star in season ten&#x27;s &quot;Supergirl&quot; and &quot;Prophecy&quot;.
* Cassidy Freeman as Tess Mercer, Lex&#x27;s handpicked successor as LuthorCorp CEO in season eight. Her name is an homage to two &quot;Superman&quot; characters, Eve Teschmacher and Mercy Graves. Freeman described her character as &quot;fierce&quot;, &quot;fun&quot;, and &quot;intelligent&quot;, with finding Lex her primary season-eight goal. Tess believes that Clark will be able to help her. In the season-ten episode &quot;Abandoned&quot;, it is disclosed that her birth name is Lutessa Lena Luthor and she is Lionel&#x27;s illegitimate daughter.
* Sam Witwer as Davis Bloome, a &quot;charismatic&quot; paramedic struggling with inner darkness, Davis Bloome is &quot;Smallville&quot;″s version of Doomsday (the only character to kill Superman). Davis would come to resemble his comic book counterpart over the course of the season. Brian Peterson said that with Michael Rosenbaum&#x27;s departure, the new executive producers were looking for a villain &quot;as great as Lex&quot; and Doomsday fit the bill.
* Justin Hartley as Oliver Queen, the CEO of Queen Industries and leader of a small group of superheroes known as the Justice League. Hartley, a recurring guest in the sixth and seventh seasons, became a series regular in season eight and was the producers&#x27; first choice to play Oliver Queen. He was designed to shake up Clark and Lois in season six and to give Clark an alternate view of how to fight crime.
* Callum Blue as Zod, an early version of the criminal from Krypton who was sent to the Phantom Zone prison. His character is first mentioned in season five, when Brainiac uses Lex&#x27;s body as a vessel for Zod&#x27;s spirit, and he appears in a Kryptonian sphere in the season-eight finale. &quot;Smallville&quot;″s executive producers called this incarnation &quot;Major Zod&quot; (as opposed to the typical &quot;General Zod&quot;), and in season nine &quot;the venomous side of Zod rises because he experiences a few key betrayals with our beloved characters&quot;.

==Production==
===Development===
Tollin/Robbins Productions originally wanted to do a series about a young Bruce Wayne, but the feature-film division of Warner Bros. decided to develop an origin story film for Batman and did not want to compete with a television series. In 2000, Tollin/Robbins approached Peter Roth, president of Warner Bros. Television, about developing a series on a young Superman. That year, Alfred Gough and Miles Millar developed a pilot based on the film &quot;Eraser&quot;. After watching the pilot, Roth approached Gough and Millar about developing a pilot about a young Superman; the two made a &quot;no tights, no flights&quot; rule that Clark would not fly or wear the Superman suit during the series.

Gough and Millar wanted to strip Superman to his &quot;bare essence&quot;, exploring why Clark Kent became the Man of Steel. They felt that because they were not comic book fans or familiar with the universe, they would have an unbiased approach to the series. Gough and Millar learned about the characters, researching the comics and choosing what they liked. They pitched their idea to the WB and Fox on the same day. A bidding war between the networks followed, with the WB committing to thirteen episodes.

Although Roth, Gough and Millar knew the show would be action-oriented, they wanted to reach &quot;7th Heaven&quot;″s &quot;middle America iconography&quot;. To create atmosphere, the team decided the meteor shower bringing Clark to Earth would be the ironic foundation of the show. The primary source of his life on Earth and the super-powered beings Clark must fight, it would take away the parents of the girl he loves and start Lex Luthor down a dark path. Roth appreciated Clark&#x27;s conflict in dealing with the fact that his arrival caused so much pain.

The creators also had to address why Lex Luthor would socialize with young people. They created a loneliness in the character which they felt would drive him to reach out to the teenagers, a loneliness echoed in Clark and Lana. Gough and Millar wanted a parallel to the Kents and created Lionel Luthor, Lex&#x27;s father, whom they saw as conducting an &quot;experiment in extreme parenting&quot;. They wanted a younger Kent couple, to be involved in Clark&#x27;s life and help him on his journey. Chloe Sullivan (another character created for the series) was considered the &quot;outsider&quot; the show needed to ensure that someone would notice the strange happenings in Smallville rather than a &quot;precursor to Lois Lane&quot;.

&quot;Smallville&quot; has been described by Warner Bros. as a from-the-roots reinterpretation of Superman mythology. Since the November 2004 reacquisition of Superboy by the Siegel family, a copyright infringement dispute has arisen over ownership of the fictional town of Smallville and a claimed similarity between Superboy and &quot;Smallville&quot;″s Clark Kent. According to the Siegel heirs, &quot;&quot;Smallville&quot; is part of the Superboy copyright&quot; (which they hold).

===Crew changes===
In April 2008, after seven seasons with the series, Gough and Millar left &quot;Smallville&quot;. The developers thanked the cast and crew for their work, acknowledging that they never stopped fighting for what they saw as &quot;their vision&quot; of the show. The reason for their departure was not provided. Gough and Millar were replaced as showrunners by Todd Slavkin, Darren Swimmer, Kelly Souders and Brian Peterson. All began writing for the series at the start of the second season, and were executive producers by the seventh season. In 2009, after one season, Swimmer and Slavkin took over the new CW series &quot;Melrose Place&quot; and did not return for &quot;Smallville&quot;″s ninth season; Souders and Peterson would continue as showrunners. Tom Welling became co-executive producer of the series that July. In March 2010, Millar, Gough and co-producer Tollin/Robins Productions filed a lawsuit against Warner Bros. and The CW charging that Hollywood&#x27;s &quot;vertical integration&quot; cost Millar and Gough millions of dollars. The suit claimed that Warner Bros. failed to &quot;maximize profits&quot; in marketing &quot;Smallville&quot;, misrepresented production costs and sold the show to foreign markets at &quot;well below the value of the series&quot;, not specifying the amount of compensation sought by the plaintiffs. The lawsuit ended with an undisclosed settlement in May 2013. Tom Welling was appointed an executive producer for &quot;Smallville&quot;″s tenth season in May 2010.

===Filming===
The series was filmed at BB Studios in Burnaby, British Columbia. Although production was initially planned for Australia, Vancouver had more of a &quot;Middle America landscape&quot;. The city provided a site for the Kent farm, doubled for Metropolis, provided a cheaper shooting location and was in the Los Angeles time zone. Smallville&#x27;s Main Street is a combination of two locations in the town of Merritt and Cloverdale.

Vancouver Technical School doubled as the exterior for Smallville High, since the school had the &quot;mid-American largess&quot; wanted by the filmmakers and was in keeping with Millar&#x27;s idea that Smallville should be the epitome of &quot;Smalltown, USA&quot;. Templeton Secondary School was used for Smallville High&#x27;s interior.&lt;ref name=&quot;locations school/&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; During season one, the production team repainted most of Templeton in Smallville High&#x27;s red and yellow and distributed large Smallville High Crows logos; so much of the school was painted that it adopted red and yellow as its school colors. The students became accustomed to the film crew (which had to shoot when school was in session), and when a class was dismissed the crew stepped aside so the students could move the equipment to get to their lockers for the next class.

The Kent farm is a working farm in Aldergrove. Owned by the Anderlinis, the crew painted their home yellow for the show. Exterior shots of Luthor Mansion were filmed at Hatley Castle in Victoria. The interiors were filmed at Shannon Mews in Vancouver, also the set for the &quot;Dark Angel&quot; pilot and the film &quot;Along Came a Spider&quot;. Clova Cinema, in Cloverdale was used for exteriors of the Talon, &quot;Smallville&quot;″s coffeehouse.

Reeve&#x27;s guest appearances in the second and third seasons were filmed in New York City.

The story is told from Clark&#x27;s point of view, so color schemes and camera selection illustrate how he interprets his environment. When he is safe at home, the colors are &quot;warm and gentle&quot; earth tones and the camera movement is &quot;very gentle&quot;. When Clark is keeping his secret and not in danger, the lighting is more neutral and the camera more mobile. When danger is present, the lighting becomes colder and the camera is handheld to allow for more &quot;extreme angles&quot;. In Metropolis &quot;clean, hard-lined architecture&quot; predominates, with blues, purples and reflective metals the dominant scheme. The same concept is used for the characters; Lex usually has a &quot;glass, steel background&quot;, and Lionel has a white or &quot;clinical blue&quot; background. Lex typically wears black, grey and &quot;cool tones&quot; (purples and blues). Clark is represented by red, yellow and blue, similar to the traditional Superman costume, and &quot;All-American&quot; red, white and blue. From season two onward, Entity FX produced all of the visual effects for &quot;Smallville&quot;, including the view of the Metropolis skyline.

===Music===
Composer Mark Snow worked with producer Ken Horton to create &quot;Smallville&quot;″s score. Snow composed music as he watched the picture, and tweaked his performance when he reviewed his initial recordings. He then sent the music to the producers, who sent it back for recomposition if needed. Individual episodes have their own soundtrack, comprising one (or more) songs. Jennifer Pyken and Madonna Wade-Reed of Daisy Music looked for songs for the soundtrack. Their choices were discussed by the producers, who decided which songs they wanted and secured their rights. Although Snow said it initially seemed odd to combine two types of music on a &quot;typical action-adventure&quot; television show, &quot;the producers seem to like the contrast of the modern songs and the traditional, orchestral approach to the score&quot;.
The main &quot;Smallville&quot; theme was not composed by Snow, although he composed opening themes for other shows (including &quot;The X-Files&quot;). The series&#x27; opening theme is the short version of &quot;Save Me&quot; performed by Remy Zero. Snow composed the closing-credits music, which was intended as &quot;Smallville&quot;″s theme. During the first two seasons, the closing-credits music was a potential theme for the series (before &quot;Save Me&quot; was selected); it was more &quot;heroic&quot; and &quot;in-your-face&quot;. Snow was told during season two that the closing credits needed new music, since the show had evolved and the existing music was no longer suitable, and he created a new, toned-down score with a more &quot;melodic&quot; sound. Snow has also reworked music from the previous &quot;Superman&quot; films. John Williams&#x27;s musical score for the Krypton sequence in the opening credits of &quot;Superman&quot; was used in season two&#x27;s &quot;Rosetta&quot; (which featured a guest appearance by Christopher Reeve) and several times in the season-two finale. To save money Snow recorded his version of Williams&#x27;s score, since using the original version would have required the team to pay Williams&#x27;s orchestra.

Snow left &quot;Smallville&quot; following his work on the sixth season and moved on to other projects such as &quot;Ghost Whisperer&quot;. Reminiscing about his work on the show, Snow said that much of the music had not changed during the series and that it was &quot;more [about] maintaining the heroic concept and the mythology than progressing through specific changes&quot;. Louis Febre, who worked closely with Snow from the beginning, became the sole composer for &quot;Smallville&quot; in season seven. Febre said that since he began composing for &quot;Smallville&quot; there was a shift to &quot;thematic development&quot; in the score, paralleling the characters&#x27; growth: &quot;As Clark grew emotionally and intellectually more complex, I found a need to comment musically on his growth, and as he drew closer to his Superman persona, it became obvious that a &#x27;Superman&#x27; theme would be required&quot;.

The creative team had a number of opportunities to try different music to enhance an episode&#x27;s storyline. Pyken and Wade-Reed chose and coordinated music on the show when Snow and Febre&#x27;s scores were not used. In season three&#x27;s &quot;Slumber&quot;, producer Ken Horton wondered if they could get a band to provide music for the entire episode. During a breakfast meeting with the music department of Warner Bros. R.E.M. was suggested, and Pyken and Wade-Reed immediately saw an opportunity to connect the episode&#x27;s featured band with its story (which revolved around REM sleep). That season, Al Gough wanted to use Johnny Cash&#x27;s cover of the Nine Inch Nails song &quot;Hurt&quot; for the final scene of &quot;Shattered&quot; (when Lionel Luthor looks at Lex through a one-way mirror at Belle Reve sanitarium) as soon as he read the episode&#x27;s script. Cash died while Wade-Reed was trying to obtain the rights for the song and his heirs, believing that the song&#x27;s use in the episode would honor his memory, gave &quot;Smallville&quot; the rights.

For season three&#x27;s &quot;Resurrection&quot; and &quot;Memoria&quot;, songs were chosen as symbolism for the characters. In &quot;Resurrection&quot;, The Rapture&#x27;s &quot;Infatuation&quot; was used during a scene with Lex and Lana to symbolize the question, &quot;Are we ever going to figure out what these two people think of each other?&quot; For &quot;Memoria&quot; Gough wanted to use Evanescence&#x27;s &quot;My Immortal&quot; for the episode&#x27;s final scene, telling Wade-Reed that he saw the song as being about mothers. In that scene Clark tells Martha that his first childhood memory was of his mother, Lara.

Season three&#x27;s &quot;Velocity&quot; provided the music editors with the opportunity to use hip-hop, rarely used in the series. The episode, similar to &quot;The Fast and the Furious&quot;, focused on Pete. Wade-Reed heard of British hip-hop artist Dizzee Rascal, and was the first person in the United States to secure the rights to Rascal&#x27;s album. Greg Beeman directed episodes, and sometimes scenes, with particular songs in mind. For &quot;Vortex&quot; in season two, he used Coldplay&#x27;s &quot;In My Place&quot; for the final scene. In the season-two finale &quot;Exodus&quot;, Beeman directed the scene where Lana shows up at the Kent barn before Lex&#x27;s wedding to Matthew Good&#x27;s &quot;Weapon&quot;. The lyrics speak of an angel and devil &quot;by my side&quot;, and Beeman timed specific shots to the song&#x27;s lyrics.

==Broadcasting==
&quot;Smallville&quot; premiered at 9:00 pm on Tuesday, October 16, 2001 on the WB. For five seasons, the series aired on the WB, moving from Tuesday at 9:00 pm to Wednesday at 8:00 pm and eventually to Thursday at 8:00 pm. In 2006, before the start of &quot;Smallville&quot;″s sixth season, the WB and UPN merged into The CW and the series continued in its lineup. During its seventh season, the series aired in Canada a day earlier than it did in the United States. In May 2009, &quot;Smallville&quot;″s ninth season moved to Friday at 8:00 pm, considered the &quot;death slot&quot; for television programs. By the end of its tenth season it was the longest-running science-fiction TV show in the United States, breaking the record held by &quot;Stargate SG-1&quot;. Syndication rights became available in October 2004 when it began airing alongside &quot;Gilmore Girls&quot; on ABC Family (now Freeform) five nights a week. After the series concluded, TNT began airing episodes on October 3, 2011. &quot;Smallville&quot; began streaming on Hulu on October 1, 2016.

===Reception===
&quot;Smallville&quot; set a WB record as its highest-rated series debut, with 8.4 million viewers tuned in for the pilot. Its premiere set a WB record for adults aged 18–34 and finished first among viewers aged 12–34, with Warner Bros. president Jordan Levin crediting the series with invigorating the network&#x27;s Tuesday-night lineup. &quot;Smallville&quot; appeared on the cover of &quot;Entertainment Weekly&quot; as one of five new shows to watch. After its first season, the series was sixth on the Parents Television Council&#x27;s 10-best list of broadcast programs. Levin, acknowledging early concerns that &quot;Smallville&quot; had become a villain of the week series, said that season two would introduce &quot;smaller mini-arcs over three to four episodes&quot; and become less of a &quot;serialized show&quot;. According to Gough, although each succeeding season relied more on season-long story arcs, an occasional villain-of-the-week story was necessary. The villain-of-the-week stories were more harshly criticized by fans of the Superman mythology, but Gough wanted to please them and the WB&#x27;s general audience (teenagers who preferred villain-of-the-week stories over episodes focusing on the Superman mythology).

Christopher Reeve, star of the &quot;Superman&quot; films, expressed his approval of the show:I was a little bit skeptical when I heard about [&quot;Smallville&quot;] at first, but I must say the writing, the acting, and the special effects are quite remarkable. In 1977, a big stunt scene would have taken us a week to film—it&#x27;s pretty impressive what they are able to do with computers and effects technology today on a weekly TV show. It gives it a lot more production value and inventiveness than I thought I was going to see when I first heard about the series. I think the show is doing a really good job following the mythology, and Tom is doing a good job following the tradition.

According to MTV&#x27;s Karl Heitmueller, &quot;Smallville&quot;″s Clark Kent was a better representation of the original material and remained &quot;true to the heart of the story&quot; by showing Clark&#x27;s selflessness and his struggle between his desires and his obligations, but he also wrote that the series would have a difficult time addressing why no one in Smallville (including Lex Luthor) recognized Clark when he put on the suit. TV Guide&#x27;s Michael Schneider called it one of the best examples of a superhero adaptation for television, but Christopher Hooton of &quot;Metro&quot; wrote that &quot;Smallville&quot; was a story which did not need to be told: &quot;No-one bothered to follow Bruce Wayne&#x27;s tedious years spent manufacturing microchips before he became Batman, so why must we endure a decade of flannel shirt-wearing Clark Kent bucking hay?&quot;

===Nielsen rankings===
The following is a table for the seasonal rankings, based on average total estimated viewers per episode, of &quot;Smallville&quot; on the WB and The CW. &quot;Rank&quot; refers to how &quot;Smallville&quot; rated compared to the other television series which aired during primetime hours.

===Accolades===

During its ten seasons, &quot;Smallville&quot; won awards ranging from Emmys to Teen Choice Awards. In 2002, the series won an Emmy for Outstanding Sound Editing for a Series for its pilot episode. Four years later, it received an Emmy for Outstanding Sound Editing for a Series for the fifth-season episode &quot;Arrival&quot;. In 2008, &quot;Smallville&quot; again won an Outstanding Sound Editing for a Series Emmy for season seven&#x27;s &quot;Bizarro&quot;.

&quot;Smallville&quot; has received a number of Leo Awards. Make-up artist Natalie Cosco won two Leo Awards for Best Make-Up: for her work in the fourth-season episode &quot;Scare&quot; and in the sixth season&#x27;s &quot;Hypnotic&quot; and &quot;Wither&quot;. At the 2006 Leo Awards, Barry Donlevy won Best Cinematography in a Dramatic Series for his work on the fourth-season episode &quot;Spirit&quot; and David Wilson won Best Production Design in a Dramatic Series for &quot;Sacred&quot;. &quot;Smallville&quot;″s sixth season won a Best Dramatic Series Leo. James Marshall won Best Direction for &quot;Zod&quot;, Caroline Cranstoun won Best Costume Design for her work on &quot;Arrow&quot; and James Philpott won Best Production Design for &quot;Justice&quot;. In 2008, &quot;Smallville&quot; won Leos for Best Dramatic Series and Best Cinematography. The visual-effects team was recognized for its work on the pilot with a 2002 Best Visual Effects Leo, and received 2004 VES Awards for Outstanding Compositing in a Televised Program, Music Video or Commercial for the second season&#x27;s &quot;Accelerate&quot; and Outstanding Matte Painting in a Televised Program, Music Video, or Commercial for &quot;Insurgence&quot;.

In 2002 the American Society of Composers, Authors and Publishers honored composer Mark Snow and Remy Zero, who provided the opening song &quot;Save Me&quot;, for their contributions to the series; the award was given to individuals who wrote the theme (or underscore) for the highest-rated television series in 2001 for their network. The American Society of Cinematographers awarded David Moxness for the sixth season&#x27;s &quot;Arrow&quot;, giving Glen Winter the same award the following year for his work on &quot;Noir&quot;. Series regulars have also won awards; in 2001, Michael Rosenbaum won a Saturn Award for Best Supporting Actor, and Tom Welling won a Teen Choice Award for Choice Breakout TV Star — Male in 2002. Allison Mack won the Teen Choice Best Sidekick award in 2006 and 2007, and in 2009 Welling received the Choice TV Actor Action Adventure award.

Millar stated that &quot;Smallville&quot; &quot;visually and aesthetically, was a celebration of Americana&quot;, with aspects such as Clark&#x27;s red, white, and blue apparel. Being an &quot;idyllic portrait of America&quot;, he said, helped the show&#x27;s popularity after the September 11 attacks on the United States. Actors reported that many United States military veterans told them of watching the show as a distraction from combat while serving overseas.

==Other media==
&quot;Smallville&quot; has generated other media and spin-offs, from young-adult novels and comic books to Internet-based mini-episodes with characters from the series. It influenced the British TV series, &quot;Merlin&quot;.

===Literature===
Two series of novels have been published since &quot;Smallville&quot;″s second season. A series of eight young-adult novels was published by Aspect Publishing from October 2002 to March 2004, and a second series of ten young-adult novels was published by Little, Brown Young Readers from October 2002 to April 2004. A bimonthly comic book series, which often tied into the series, was also published.

====Young adult novels====
Three novels were published on October 1, 2002: one by Aspect and two by Little, Brown Young Readers. The Aspect novel (&quot;Smallville: Strange Visitors&quot;) was written by Roger Stern, with Clark and his friends trying to uncover the truth about two religious con men who set up shop in Smallville and use kryptonite in their spiritual seminars to rob the townspeople. Little, Brown Young Readers first published &quot;Arrival&quot; by Michael Teitelbaum, chronicling the series&#x27; pilot. The second novel (&quot;See No Evil&quot;, by series writers Cherie Bennett and Jeff Gottesfeld) follows Dawn Mills, a young actress who wants to attend Juilliard. Dawn, who can become invisible, wants to get revenge on the people who have been talking behind her back but is stopped by Clark. &quot;See No Evil&quot; was one of the original storylines for season one&#x27;s &quot;Shimmer&quot;.

On November 1, 2002, Aspect published Alan Grant&#x27;s &quot;Smallville: Dragon&quot;, about an ex-convict who assumes the abilities and appearance of a dragon after he is exposed to kryptonite in a cave; the mutation drives him to try to kill everyone who testified against him. In the novel, Clark is hypnotized into believing that he is a normal teenager with no special abilities. A month after the publication of Grant&#x27;s novel Bennett and Gottesfeld wrote Little, Brown Young Readers&#x27; &quot;Flight&quot;, about a young girl (Tia) who Clark discovers has wings. He and his friends believe that Tia is being abused by her father, and teach her to overcome her fear of flying so she can find her mother. &quot;Flight&quot; (like &quot;See No Evil&quot;) was a planned episode, but the crew was uncertain that they could get the flying effects right and the idea was scrapped. Nancy Holder wrote the third novel in the Aspect series. Published on January 1, 2003, &quot;Hauntings&quot; follows Clark and his friends as they investigate a ghostly presence in a Smallville house. Little, Brown Young Readers then published &quot;Animal Rage&quot; by David and Bobby Weiss, about animal-rights activist Heather Fox (who can change into any animal she touches). Heather uses this ability to harm people who hurt animals until Clark discovers it and stops her. Aspect published Dean Wesley Smith&#x27;s &quot;Whodunit&quot;, in which Clark, Chloe, Lana and Pete investigate the murder of a boy and his sister while Lex tries to decide whether to ransom his kidnapped father or try rescuing Lionel himself.

Little, Brown Young Readers published the next two books in April and June 2003. The first, &quot;Speed&quot;, was written by Cherie Bennett and Jeff Gottesfeld. The second, &quot;Buried Secrets&quot;, was written by Suzan Colon. In &quot;Speed&quot;, a boy uses an hourglass his father gave him for his birthday to stop time and commit hate crimes without being caught. Clark stops him before he disrupts a local multicultural festival. In &quot;Buried Secrets&quot; Clark and Lex fall in love with a mind-reading substitute Spanish teacher, jeopardizing their friendship.

On September 9, 2004, Aspect published Diana G. Gallagher&#x27;s &quot;Shadows&quot;, about a girl and her father who move to Smallville; the father creates murderous monsters. Jonathan Kent assumes that the deaths are related to LuthorCorp, creating tension with his son. Clark discovers the truth to prove Lex&#x27;s innocence, stopping the creatures before they can kill again. Colon returned to write &quot;Runaway&quot;, in which Clark runs away to the city and lives with other homeless teenagers; he falls in love with one of the girls before returning home. In &quot;Smallville: Silence&quot; by Nancy Holder, the characters investigate zombies in town. Little, Brown Young Readers published its eighth book, &quot;Greed&quot;, by Bennett and Gottesfeld in which Clark and his friends take summer jobs as counselors at a camp for disadvantaged youths. When a boy falls into Crater Lake, he develops the ability to foretell the future and Lionel tries to exploit this. Pete also tries to exploit Clark&#x27;s abilities by tricking him into playing in a basketball game and betting on the outcome.

Alan Grant returned to write &quot;Curse&quot;, about a gravedigger who unleashes a 150-year-old curse onto Smallville and Clark&#x27;s attempts to put things right. On February 1, 2004 Little, Brown Young Readers published Suzan Colon&#x27;s &quot;Temptation&quot;, where Clark uses red kryptonite in an attempt to impress Lana and Chloe when they are infatuated with a French exchange student. Aspect published its final novel on March 1, 2004. Written by Devin K. Grayson, &quot;City&quot; follows Clark and Lex on a trip to Metropolis. In the city, they are caught between the Japanese Yakuza and a secret agent who thinks he has found an alien. In Little, Brown Young Readers&#x27; final novel, &quot;Sparks&quot; by Cherie Bennett and Jeff Gottesfeld, Chloe is hit by kryptonite sparks from a fireworks display. The sparks make Chloe the desire of every man, but when they wear off an admirer kidnaps her and she is rescued by Clark.

===Comic books===
====Seasonal extensions====
&quot;Smallville&quot;″s first venture into comics was &quot;Elemental&quot;, a one-off story by Gough and Millar which appeared in &quot;TV Guide&quot; during the series&#x27; first season and set in that period. Before the start of season two, DC Comics published a one-off comic based on the series. Titled &quot;Smallville: The Comic&quot;, it has two stories. The first, &quot;Raptor&quot; by Mark Verheiden and Roy Martinez, is about an abused boy who mutates into a velociraptor (thanks to kryptonite) and tries to get revenge on the Luthor family. Michael Green and John Paul Leon wrote &quot;Exile and The Kingdom&quot;, with insight into why Lex remains in Smallville after his father offers him a position in Metropolis at the end of season one. DC Comics then began publishing a bimonthly comic with stories about &quot;Smallville&quot; characters. Writer and script coordinator Clint Carpenter called the comic a companion to the series rather than a non-canonical version. According to Carpenter, the series expands on events in the series (such as season-ending cliffhangers) and gives &quot;additional depth&quot; to characters with limited screen time on the series or whose storylines needed additional explanation. Carpenter was not the first person asked to oversee the comic; Mark Verheiden, who co-wrote the one-off comic, was originally intended to be in charge of the bimonthly series. Verheiden&#x27;s commitment to the TV series kept him from working on the comic books, so he asked Carpenter to take them on. Although the comic book was intended to expand on the TV series, there was an occasional continuity overlap because of differences in production schedule between the comic and the series. In one instance, the comic book showed Clark robbing an ATM and the season-three premiere showed him robbing multiple ATMs. The series tied into the TV series, the &quot;Chloe Chronicles&quot; webisodes and &quot;Smallville&quot;-related webpages, with cast and crew interviews and information on the episodes&#x27; production. The comic series ended in January 2005 with #11, with no comics published until the Season Eleven series debut.

====&quot;Smallville Season Eleven&quot;====
The first digital issue of a &quot;Smallville Season Eleven&quot; comic book was released on April 13, 2012; the first print issue was published on May 2. In the comic book (written by &quot;Smallville&quot; executive story editor Bryan Q. Miller), set six months after Darkseid&#x27;s attack, Clark no longer fights crime as &quot;The Blur&quot; but as &quot;Superman&quot;. Although Clark is generally accepted by the public, some distrust him (including Lex Luthor, despite his memory loss after his encounter with Tess Mercer), and this worsens when he reveals himself as extraterrestrial. &quot;Detective&quot;, a new series of adventures paralleling the TV series and the comic series&#x27; second arc, was published digitally on the title&#x27;s off-week beginning January 4, 2013. A new arc, &quot;Effigy&quot;, features a team-up of recurring character John Jones and Batman. DC Comics cancelled the series after nineteen issues at the end of the &quot;Olympus&quot; story arc, with the rest of the season-eleven story continuing as miniseries under the &quot;Season Eleven&quot; banner. In March 2015, DC Comics ended the &quot;Smallville Season Eleven&quot; with story arc &quot;Continuity&quot;, which serves as the finale of the television franchise.

=====Main series=====
=====Interlude series=====
===&quot;Chloe Chronicles&quot;===
Allison Mack&#x27;s character, Chloe Sullivan, has starred in two promotional tie-in series: &quot;Smallville: Chloe Chronicles&quot;, and &quot;Vengeance Chronicles&quot;. Two volumes of &quot;Chloe Chronicles&quot; totaled eleven mini-episodes. In the first volume Chloe investigated events leading to the death of Earl Jenkins, who held Chloe and her friends hostage at the LuthorCorp plant in the first-season episode &quot;Jitters&quot;. It aired from April 29 to May 20, 2003 to AOL subscribers. After the first volume received positive responses from viewers, the second volume was created as a continuation with Sam Jones III as Pete Ross. This volume used the &quot;Smallville&quot; comic books as a secondary tie-in to the series. Viewers could watch &quot;Smallville&quot;, &quot;Chloe&#x27;s Chronicles&quot; and finish with the &quot;Smallville&quot; comic book, which would provide an &quot;enhanced backstory to the online segments&quot;. The later series, &quot;Vengeance Chronicles&quot;, is a spin-off of the fifth-season episode &quot;Vengeance&quot;. In this series Chloe joins a costumed vigilante, whom she calls the &quot;Angel of Vengeance&quot;, to expose Lex Luthor&#x27;s Level 33.1 experiments on meteor-infected people.

The idea for an online show about Chloe originated with Mark Warshaw, who ran the show&#x27;s website and was in charge of the DVDs. The series intended to wrap up &quot;unfinished business&quot; from the television show. Although &quot;Smallville: Chloe Chronicles&quot; began on AOL, it made its way to the United Kingdom&#x27;s Channel 4 website. According to Lisa Gregorian, senior vice president for television of Warner Bros. Marketing Services, their goal was to create companion programming that offers new and exciting ways to engage the audience, just as music videos did for record promotion. Allison Mack described the show as &quot;very Nancy Drew and mysterious&quot;: &quot;I think it&#x27;s a bit more like &quot;The X-Files&quot; or &quot;NYPD Blue&quot;. The &quot;Chronicles&quot; are like a detective story, with Chloe following clues and interviewing people, going from spot to spot, figuring things out&quot;. The scripts were written by Brice Tidwell; Mack was given script approval for the series, allowing her to review and make changes to the script. Warshaw communicated with Gough and Millar to expand &quot;Smallville&quot; stories in &quot;Chloe&#x27;s Chronicles&quot;.

===Promotional tie-ins===
For the season-three premiere, the &quot;Smallville&quot; producers teamed up with Verizon to enable its registered users to view plot updates (as &quot;Daily Planet&quot; press releases), quizzes and games related to the show with Verizon product placement. &quot;Smallville Legends: The Oliver Queen Chronicles&quot;, a six-episode CGI series which chronicled the early life of Oliver Queen/Green Arrow, was released in a promotional tie-in with Sprint. According to Warner Bros. Television Group executive vice-president of worldwide marketing Lisa Gregorian, the promotional tie-ins got fans more connected to the show. In April 2007 a tie-in with Toyota promoting the Yaris featured an online comic strip, &quot;Smallville Legends: Justice &amp; Doom&quot;, as an interstitial program during new &quot;Smallville&quot; episodes. The interactive comic was based on the &quot;Justice&quot; episode, which follows Oliver Queen, Bart Allen, Victor Stone and Arthur Curry (the initial members of the &quot;Justice League&quot; in &quot;Smallville&quot;) as they seek to destroy LuthorCorp&#x27;s secret experimental labs. The online series allowed viewers to investigate with the fictional team to win prizes. Stephan Nilson wrote all five episodes, working with a team of artists on the illustrations. Nilson received the plot for each comic episode as &quot;Smallville&quot;″s production crew was filming its current television episode. Artist Steve Scott drew comic book panels which were sent to Motherland, a consulting group. Motherland reviewed the drawings, telling Scott which images to draw on a separate overlay; this allowed objects to be moved in and out of a frame.

In 2008 The CW joined the manufacturers of Stride gum to give viewers an opportunity to create their own &quot;Smallville&quot; digital comic, &quot;Smallville: Visions&quot;. The writers and producers developed the comic&#x27;s beginning and end, allowing viewers to provide the middle. The CW began its tie-in campaign with the March 13, 2008 episode &quot;Hero&quot;, where Pete develops superhuman elasticity after chewing kryptonite-infused Stride gum. On The CW&#x27;s website, viewers voted on one of two options (each adding four pages to the comic) every Tuesday and Thursday until the campaign ended on April 7. In season seven &quot;Smallville&quot; again worked with Sprint, bringing its customers &quot;mobisodes&quot; titled &quot;Smallville Legends: Kara and the Chronicles of Krypton&quot; with Clark&#x27;s cousin Kara.

===Spin-offs===
Gough and Millar developed an &quot;Aquaman&quot; pilot for the WB, with Justin Hartley as Aquaman (Arthur Curry). As work progressed on the &quot;Smallville&quot; season-five episode &quot;Aqua&quot;, although the episode was not intended as a backdoor pilot for an Aquaman spin-off the character was seen as having potential for his own series. Alan Ritchson was not considered for the role in the new series, because Gough and Millar did not consider it a &quot;Smallville&quot; spin-off. Gough said in November 2005 that the series was to be a different version of the &#x27;Aquaman&#x27; legend and suggested a crossover with &quot;Smallville&quot; at some point. Although the pilot was given a good chance of being picked up, when the WB and UPN merged into The CW the new network passed on the show.

During the sixth season there was talk of spinning off the Green Arrow into his own series, but Hartley refused to talk about the possibility of a spin-off because of his role on &quot;Smallville&quot;. The actor felt it his duty to respect what the show had accomplished in five seasons, and not &quot;steal the spotlight&quot; because there was &quot;talk&quot; of a spin-off after his two appearances. According to Hartley, &quot;talking&quot; was as far as the spin-off idea ever got. Steven DeKnight revealed that a spin-off Justice League series was expected to happen after the episode &quot;Justice&quot;, and would have continued the story of Oliver and his new team.

===Arrowverse===

Tom Welling and Erica Durance reprised their roles as Clark Kent and Lois Lane for the Arrowverse crossover event &quot;Crisis on Infinite Earths&quot;. The crossover retroactively establishes the events of &quot;Smallville&quot; as taking place on Earth-167 and reveals that in the years since the finale, Clark has given up his powers and taken over the Kent farm, where he and Lois raise their two daughters. Michael Rosenbaum was approached about reprising his role as Lex Luthor, but he declined when Warner Bros. did not show him a script, tell him what his character was going to do, nor let him know when he was going to film (it was referred in the scene that Lex was President). Alan Ritchson, who played Arthur Curry / Aquaman on the series, was also approached to reprise his role in the crossover but turned it down due to scheduling commitments with &quot;Titans&quot;. Despite this, Ritchson did make an uncredited cameo appearance in the crossover as his &quot;Titans&quot; character, Hank Hall / Hawk, through archival footage from that series.

===Possible animated series revival===
In 2021, Tom Welling and his &quot;Smallville&quot; co-star Michael Rosenbaum were developing an animated series revival to the series and hoped to &quot;use as many of the original cast members as possible&quot;. He and Rosenbaum were preparing a pitch of the series for Warner Bros., and they delivered to them in January 2022. John Glover, Sam Jones III, Kristin Kreuk and Erica Durance, and original series showrunners, Gough and Millar, were said to return, with the exception of Allison Mack due to sex trafficking charges made against her for which she was convicted and imprisoned. The series was said to be in some stage of pre-production or production, but still alive, according to Durance.

Seasons one through ten have been released on DVD in Regions 1, 2 and 4. Seasons five and six were also released in the HD DVD format on November 28, 2006 and September 18, 2007, respectively. Seasons six, seven, eight, nine and ten have been released for Blu-ray. The DVD releases include deleted scenes, behind-the-scenes featurettes and commentary by cast and crew members on selected episodes. The promotional tie-ins &quot;Chloe Chronicles&quot; and &quot;Vengeance Chronicles&quot; accompanied the season two, three and five box sets. Other special features include interactive functionality (such as a tour of Smallville), a comic book and DVD-ROM material.

For the 20th anniversary, the complete series was released for the first time on Blu-ray on October 16, 2021. Season one is the only season to be produced in standard-definition; all subsequent seasons were produced in high definition. The 20th Anniversary Blu-ray release contains the original standard-definition of season one, upscaled; with seasons two, three, and four in their native high-definition for the first time. It also marks the first time season five being released on Blu-ray. Season five had previously been released in high definition on HD-DVD only. The Blu-ray release was repackaged and re-rereleased on February 25, 2024. This version of the Complete Series includes all 218 episodes on Blu-ray and 2 DVDs with hours of bonus features.


==Merchandise==
Since &quot;Smallville&quot; began airing, a variety of merchandise connected with the series has been produced. Two soundtrack albums of songs from the show have been released. &quot;Smallville: The Talon Mix&quot;, with a group of artists who licensed their music for the show, was issued on February 25, 2003. &quot;Smallville: The Metropolis Mix&quot;, with another group of artists, was released on November 8, 2005. In addition to the soundtracks, action figures, T-shirts, hats and posters have been produced. In December 2002 autographed &quot;Smallville&quot; merchandise was listed for auction on eBay, with the proceeds going to charity. In 2003, Titan Magazines began publishing a monthly &quot;Smallville&quot; magazine with cast and crew interviews, information on &quot;Smallville&quot; merchandise and photos. The 34th and final issue was published in November 2009.

Titan Books published companion volumes for each season with cast and crew interviews, episode descriptions and behind-the-scenes photos. On September 1, 2004, the company published its first companion for the series. Written by Paul Simpson, the book has sixteen pages of color photos of the cast. On March 1, 2005 Titan Books published its season-two companion, also written by Simpson, which details the series&#x27; special effects. Titan published the third-season companion on September 1, the last written by Simpson. He described the episodes&#x27; plots, discussing the neglect of the Martha Kent character and the failure of the Adam Knight storyline. Titan Books released the fourth-season companion by Craig Byrne, who wrote the subsequent companion books, on September 4, 2007. It contains interviews with the cast and crew and color photos of the production. Titan published the season-five companion on December 26, 2007. The season-six companion, with an introduction by Justin Hartley, was published on March 25, 2008. The season-seven companion (Titan&#x27;s last) has a foreword by Laura Vandervoort, a reflection on the &quot;&quot;Smallville&quot; phenomenon&quot; and a discussion of Gough and Millar&#x27;s departure.

In 2010, the Smallville Roleplaying Game was released by Margaret Weis Productions using its Cortex Plus System. Using the series&#x27; season-nine setting, it includes rules for earlier seasons. Two supplements, the High School Yearbook and the Watchtower Report, were produced. Players can play the characters from &quot;Smallville&quot;, or create their own spin-off of the series. &quot;Ultimate Smallville Soundtrack&quot;, a five-CD box set with 100 songs from the series&#x27; 10 seasons, was released by Vicious Records in May 2013 with all profits benefiting the Christopher and Dana Reeve Foundation.

<text>L&#x27;Insurgente was a 40-gun of the French Navy, launched in 1793. During the Quasi War with the United States, the United States Navy frigate , with Captain Thomas Truxtun in command, captured her off the island of Nevis. After her capture she served in the United States Navy as USS &quot;Insurgent&quot;, patrolling the waters in the West Indies. In September 1800 she was caught up in a severe storm and was presumed lost at sea.

==French frigate &quot;L&#x27;Insurgente&quot;==
&quot;L&#x27;Insurgente&quot; was built by Pierre-Joseph Pénétreau at Lorient and launched on 27 April 1793.

In January or February 1794, &quot;L&#x27;Insurgente&quot; captured &quot;Ann&quot; off Cape Clear Island as &quot;Ann&quot; was sailing from Newfoundland to Bristol. &quot;L&#x27;Insurgente&quot; put a prize crew aboard &quot;Ann&quot;, but left her mate and three other men on board. When &quot;Ann&quot; was in sight of the French coast, the British sailors succeeded in recapturing her from the prize crew; the British then took &quot;Ann&quot; into Vigo.

On 16 January 1794 &quot;L&#x27;Insurgente&quot; captured the American ship and brought her into Brest. &quot;John and James&quot; had been built at Philadelphia for George Morrison of Petersburg, Virginia. She had left Petersburg with 450 hogsheads of tobacco and 12,000 staves. On 27 December 1794 the Tribunal of Commerce ordered &quot;John and James&quot; released to Captain James Johnson and the Committee of Public Safety awarded him a payment of 20,000 &quot;livres tournois&quot;.

On 25 April &quot;L&#x27;Insurgente&quot; captured &quot;Freundschaft Lourentz&quot;, Colandt, master, as &quot;Freundschaft Lourentz&quot; was sailing from Lisbon to London. However two &quot;Scilly boats&quot; (i.e., boats from the Isles of Scilly), recaptured her the next day and brought her into St Ives, Cornwall.

On 5 December 1797 &quot;Insurgente&quot; captured as &quot;Prince Frederick&quot; was returning from Madras and Bengal. &quot;Prince Frederick&quot; was so badly damaged in the engagement that she sank soon afterwards. Her people, however, were saved. The EIC put a value of £59,981 on the cargo that it had lost.

US-French Quasi War: On 20 November 1798 she captured USS Retaliation off Guadalupe. &quot;Insurgente&quot; was transporting General Desfourneaux from France, via Cayenne, French Guiana, to Guadalupe to replace Victor Hugues as Governor. After dropping off Desfourneaux she returned Hugues to France and returned to Guadeloupe.

==Battle with &quot;Constellation&quot;==

On 9 February 1799, after being at sea for three days, spotted &quot;L&#x27;Insurgente&quot; approximately northeast off Nevis. &quot;L&#x27;Insurgente&quot;, a fully-rigged frigate, was considered one of the fastest sailing vessels in the world at the time; three weeks earlier she had encountered &quot;Constellation&quot; but was able to outrun her and escape. Shortly after being spotted by &quot;Constellation&quot; this second time the ships encountered a squall during which a violent gust of wind snapped &quot;L&#x27;Insurgente&quot;″s main topmast, impairing her speed. As &quot;Constellation&quot; approached, Captain Michael-Pierre Barreaut first attempted to seek haven by making for St. Eustatius, but to no avail, where &quot;L&#x27;Insurgente&quot; hauled wind and assumed a starboard tack. After being overtaken she hoisted American colors, at which time &quot;Constellation&quot; hoisted the private signals. Unable to respond appropriately, she gave up her attempt at disguise and Captain Barreaut ordered the French tri-colors hoisted and a gun fired to windward to signal the challenge where &quot;L&#x27;Insurgente&quot; boldly sat in wait to be engaged. This was the first time since the American Revolution that a shot had been fired from an enemy vessel at an American ship. Captain Thomas Truxtun gave the order to clear the deck of &quot;Constellation&quot; for action and the boatswain sounded the whistle. Both ships bore up to take positions to engage. &quot;Constellation&quot; fired the first broadside, double-shotted, inflicting much damage to the French vessel&#x27;s hull and killing many in the first minute of the engagement. &quot;L&#x27;Insurgente&quot; responded and fired a broadside, inflicting much damage to &quot;Constellation&quot;″s rigging and fore topmast, which was almost cut off. At 3:30 pm after an hour and a half of running battle and several raking broadsides from &quot;Constellation&quot;, &quot;L&#x27;Insurgente&quot; struck her colors. First Lieutenant John Rodgers, Midshipman David Porter along with eleven men were put on board the captured vessel to take possession and to secure the prisoners who were sent to the lower hold. She had lost 70 men from a crew of 409, while &quot;Constellation&quot;, badly damaged also, only lost three out of a complement of 309. This was the first post-Revolutionary War American victory against a foreign naval vessel.

There were no handcuffs to be found and the prisoners seem disposed to rebel. Accordingly, Rodgers placed sentries at the hatch, armed with blunderbusses and under orders to open fire should the prisoners attempt to breach the hatch way.

==Service in US Navy==
The US Navy considered &quot;Insurgent&quot; a prize in the Quasi-War with France. The frigate was taken to the West Indies and refitted for service in the young American navy. She cruised under Lt. John Rodgers in company with &quot;Constellation&quot; until May 1799. On 17 April 1799 she and USS &quot;Constellation&quot; captured French letter of marque schooner &quot;Diligente&quot; off Basse-Terre, Guadeloupe. Ordered back to the United States, &quot;Insurgent&quot; was purchased by the Navy for $84,500. Commissioned with Captain Alexander Murray in command, &quot;Insurgent&quot; sailed from Hampton Roads for Europe and the Caribbean on 14 August 1799. She arrived at Lisbon, Portugal on 13 September, She departed on 17 September with HMS for the Straits of Gibraltar. She arrived at Cadiz, Spain on 23 Sept., and was off Algeciras 24-28. Proceeded on to Cape Spartel, Madieras, Tenerife, and on to Cayanne, Surinam and Barbados. On 14 November she recaptured British brig &quot;Margaret&quot; captured the day before by a French privateer. On 20 November she and USS off Guadeloupe recaptured schooner &quot;Nancy&quot;, captured on 18 November by a French privateer. On 10 December she was off St. Pierre. On 28 December she recaptured merchantman &quot;Commerce&quot; that had been captured by a french privateer off Antigua earlier in the day. On 22 or 23 January 1800 she recaptured schooner &quot;Aurora&quot;. On 5 February while sailing to Jamaica she came across dismasted , heavily damaged in a battle with French heavy frigate , limping to Jamaica. She escorted her to Jamaica. She then proceeded to head for home and was 15 leagues west of Havana, Cuba on 27 February. Sometime in February she recaptured &quot;William and Mary&quot; Cruising in European waters during the winter of 1799–1800, the frigate captured the French ship &quot;Vendémiaire&quot; and recaptured the American ship &quot;Angora&quot;. She arrived in the Patapsco River on 13 March 1800 after being damaged in rough weather off Cape Hatteras.

==Loss==
On 29 April 1800 Patrick Fletcher assumed command and was ordered to cruise between the West Indies and the American coast to protect American shipping interests and to capture any enemy vessels he encountered. &quot;Insurgent&quot; departed Baltimore on 22 July and after a brief stop at Hampton Roads sailed for her station 8 August 1800. She was never heard from again, and the frigate and her crew were presumed lost during the severe storm that struck the West Indies on 20 September 1800. This storm is also thought to have sunk , which likewise vanished without a trace.

<text>Randolph Air Force Base is a United States Air Force base located in Bexar County, Texas, ( east-northeast of Downtown San Antonio).

Opened in 1931, Randolph has been a flying training facility for the United States Army Air Corps, the United States Army Air Forces, and the Air Force during its entire existence.

On 1 October 2010, Randolph AFB merged with Lackland Air Force Base and the US Army&#x27;s Fort Sam Houston to form Joint Base San Antonio.

==Etymology==

Randolph AFB was named after Captain William Millican Randolph, a native of Austin, who was on the base naming committee at the time of his death in a crash.

The base served as headquarters of the Air Education and Training Command (AETC) as well as the Air Force Personnel Center (AFPC) and was known as &quot;the Showplace of the Air Force&quot; because of the Spanish Colonial Revival Style architecture in which all structures, including hangars were constructed. The symbol of the base was a large water tower atop Building 100, housing the headquarters for Randolph&#x27;s major flying unit, the 12th Flying Training Wing (12 FTW). With its distinctive architecture, the wing&#x27;s headquarters became known throughout the Air Force as &quot;the Taj Mahal&quot;, or simply &quot;The Taj&quot;.

== History ==

=== 1920s and 1930s ===
The idea for Randolph began soon after passage in the United States Congress of the Air Corps Act of 1926, which changed the name of the Army Air Service to the Army Air Corps, created two new brigadier general positions and provided a five-year expansion program for the under-strength Air Corps. One of the new general officer positions was given to Frank P. Lahm, who was placed in charge of all flying training.

General Lahm established the Air Corps Training Center in August 1926 and set up its headquarters at Duncan Field, next to Kelly Field, Texas. He soon learned that the facilities at Kelly and Brooks Fields were not sufficient for proper training. The buildings, erected during World War I with a life expectancy of five years, had no suitable areas for ground training, and the living quarters were inadequate. San Antonio&#x27;s rapid growth was also beginning to interfere with flying training operations. Maj. Gen. Mason Patrick, Chief of the Air Corps, visited San Antonio in December and recommended that an additional training field be built, and in April 1927 a board of officers appointed by Gen. Lahm approved an unusual circular layout.

In 1927, newly assigned to Kelly Field as a dispatch officer in the motor pool, First Lieutenant Harold Clark designed a model four-quadrant airfield having a circular layout of facilities between parallel runways, after learning a new field was to be constructed. Having trained as an architect prior to entering the military during World War I, Clark sketched ideas for a perfect &quot;Air City&quot; on the back of old dispatch sheets, aligning the runways with prevailing winds and placing facilities by function between the runways to keep planes from having to make landing approaches over hangars, as they were forced to do at Kelly. Clark took his drawings to Lahm&#x27;s executive officer, who immediately brought him before the planning board. On 1 November 1927, Clark submitted a finished plan to Lahm, and impressed with Clark&#x27;s designs, Lahm detailed him to ACTC Headquarters on 8 December, to revise and develop the plans.

The Military Affairs Committee of the San Antonio Chamber of Commerce quickly took the forefront in the search for an airfield location, which had to be suited to the airfield design, rather than the other way around as commonly done. A site east on San Antonio was chosen in May 1927 but rejected for those reasons. A second site near Schertz, Texas, was acquired and offered to the Air Corps on 31 December 1927. The land had to have clear title, be donated to the government, and have no restrictions as to use. Legal processes delayed the acceptance of the donated property until 16 August 1928. In the meantime, after a dispute with a blue ribbon committee of senior Air Corps officers who did not favor the circular design, Clark&#x27;s layout was approved, also on 16 August, and construction began on 1 November 1927. It was &quot;the largest construction project undertaken by the Army, up to that time, with the exception of the Panama Canal.&quot;

Clark&#x27;s design was submitted to and drawn upon by George B. Ford, a city planner and civilian advisor to the Construction Service of the Quartermaster Corps whose approval of all site plans for the Army was required between 1926 and 1930. The 2001 National Park Service nomination for the Randolph Field Historic District as a National Historic Landmark commented on the architectural layout of the field:
It appears that Clark&#x27;s plan, submitted by the Air Corps Training Center, was one of the new layouts that George B. Ford, in his position as City Planning Adviser to the War Department, chose for extensive revisions. Other than the circular roads at the center of the layout and the location of flight lines at the edges, Lt. Clark&#x27;s plan and the final layout for Randolph Field have few major features in common. The &quot;official post layout&quot;, signed by George B. Ford, A.I.A., was approved by the Chief of the Air Corps, the Quartermaster General, and the Chief of Staff for the Secretary of War in January 1929. It elegantly combined the Air Corps&#x27; operational and training needs with advanced city planning principles. Key features of Ford&#x27;s design (and which do not appear in Lt. Clark&#x27;s plan) include the dramatic, impressive entranceway, its termination at Washington Circle (a smaller circle below Main Circle, formerly known as North Circle), and the siting of three notable buildings around Washington Circle on the east, west, and south. The final layout for Randolph Field is clearly the work of a master planner.

Once the site for the field was selected, a committee decided to name the base after Captain William Millican Randolph, a native of Austin and graduate of Texas A&amp;M, who was killed on 17 February 1928, in the crash of a Curtiss AT-4 Hawk, &quot;27–220&quot;, on takeoff from Gorman Field, Texas. Ironically, Captain Randolph was serving on the committee to select a name for the new field at the time of his death. Captain Randolph is buried at Fort Sam Houston National Cemetery.

Although barely half-completed, Randolph Field was dedicated 20 June 1930, with an estimated 15,000 people in attendance and a fly-by of 233 planes. The mayor of San Antonio, C.M. Chambers, formally presented the &quot;West Point of the Air&quot; to the Chief of the Air Corps, Maj. Gen. James Fechet. Early in 1931, the School of Aviation Medicine from Brooks Field and the initial service squadron began relocating to Randolph. On 1 October, the Air Corps Training Center moved its headquarters from Duncan Field to Randolph and the principal movement of personnel followed. The flying school at Brooks Field closed on 20 October, followed by the school at March Field on 25 October, and the Primary Flying School opened at Randolph on 2 November 1931.

Between October 1931 and March 1935, more than 2,000 candidates reported for pilot training at Randolph, which began a new class every fourth months. 47% of them graduated as pilots and went on to advanced flying training. 75% of all primary training was conducted at Randolph Field. By May 1932 the field had 251 primary trainers, most the venerable Consolidated PT-3 &quot;Trusty&quot;, but gradually supplemented by the Consolidated PT-11D, which became the Air Corps standard in the 1930s. In 1936, the famous Stearman PT-13 Kaydet began to appear in the skies over San Antonio. Basic training followed primary, at first with Douglas BT-1s and BT-2Bs. The Seversky BT-8 was later introduced as a basic trainer, but was soon deemed too difficult to handle and was replaced by North American BT-9s in 1935.

Increased flying hours for cadets and an expanded syllabus resulted in a need for auxiliary fields within a ten-mile radius of Randolph to handle the volume of takeoffs and landings, and in 1932 Randolph was encircled by seven (clockwise from west to southwest): Dodd, Cade, Davenport, Marion, C.A. Krueger, Zuehl, and Martindale. Primary training continued at Randolph until September 1939 when expansion of the Air Corps forced it to contract primary out to civilian schools, and Randolph&#x27;s mission shifted to basic pilot training only.

The Air Corps Act of 1926 mandated that rated pilots comprise 90% of all commissioned officers of the Air Corps. Because of this requirement, nearly all new officers of the Air Corps underwent Randolph&#x27;s rigorous pilot training program and, in combination with the architectural beauty of the base, Mayor Chamber&#x27;s term &quot;West Point of the Air&quot; became the unofficial nickname for Randolph Field. A 1935 Hollywood film, &quot;West Point of the Air&quot;, was filmed on location at Randolph.

===1940s to 1970s===

In June 1941, the Air Corps became the Army Air Forces. Basic flying training at Randolph continued until March 1943, when the Army Air Forces Central Instructors School (CIS) was created. For the next two years, training instructors for ground schools, instructor pilots (including civilian contract instructors) for all three phases of flying training, and officers destined for administrative duties at air training command bases were trained by the CIS. Randolph produced 15,396 instructor graduates from this course before it moved to Waco Field in 1945. When the CIS moved to Waco Field it was replaced by the Army Air Forces pilot school, which specialized in transition training for B-29 bomber pilots, copilots and engineers. Primary pilot training returned to Randolph from Goodfellow Field in December 1945. Class 42-X gave 235 pilots their wings in an experimental course that sent pilot candidates directly to instructor training without first attending primary school, but though the course was considered a success, AAF Flying Training Command rejected its adoption. The Central Instructors School returned to Randolph in November 1945, was redesignated the AAF Pilot Instructors School, and relocated to Barksdale Field, Louisiana, on 12 March 1946.

Like many military installations during World War II, Randolph fielded an intercollegiate football team, nicknamed the Randolph Field Ramblers. Under coach Frank Tritico, the 1943 team achieved a 9–1 record and was invited to play in the 1944 Cotton Bowl Classic, where they battled the Texas Longhorns to a 7–7 tie. The 1944 team, stocked with such stars as former All-American and National Football League (NFL) Rookie of the Year Bill Dudley and All-American running back Glenn Dobbs, as well as eight other former NFL players, went undefeated and untied in 11 games, and was ranked No. 3 in the nation by the AP Poll.

The Army Air Forces also planned to return basic pilot training to Randolph on 1 February 1946. Even though basic training transferred from Goodfellow Field in February 1946, the Army Air Forces suspended all pilot training when it found itself with a shortfall of maintenance personnel. The U.S. Air Force became a separate service on 18 September 1947, and Randolph Field was officially renamed Randolph Air Force Base on 13 January 1948.

When Randolph resumed flying training activities in March 1948, primary pilot training was deleted from its program, and in August 1948 the 3510th Pilot Training Wing (Basic) was activated. On 7 August 1950, during the Korean War, the 3511th Combat Crew Training Group was established as part of the 3510th PTW to train crews for the B-29 Superfortress, and the instructor pilot school was transferred to Craig Air Force Base, Alabama. On 11 June 1952 the pilot training wing was redesignated as the 3510th Flying Training Wing (Medium Bomber), and again in October 1954 (to reflect more accurately its actual mission) to the 3510th Combat Crew Training Wing.

On 1 April 1952, the Air Force established the Crew Training Air Force (CTAF) with its headquarters at Randolph to administer nine bases and combat crew training wings, including the 3510th. B-29 training by the 3511th Flying Training Group (Medium Bomber) continued for five years, ultimately producing 21,519 crew members. In 1954, with the requirements for B-29 crewmen reduced, the CTAF instituted instrument training for four-engine transport crews using the Fairchild C-119 Flying Boxcar, and added Martin B-57 Canberra crew training to Randolph&#x27;s activities, although a shortage of qualified instructors cut short the latter program after two years. The USAF Helicopter School was based at Randolph from June 1956 to July 1958. The 3510th conducted Boeing KC-97 Stratofreighter crew training from June 1957 to July 1958, after which the Strategic Air Command assigned a tenant wing to Randolph, the 4397th Air Refueling Wing, to instruct crews until 15 June 1962.

The Crew Training Air Force was discontinued on 1 July 1957, and the headquarters of the Flying Training Air Force relocated to Randolph. Shortly after, between 1 August and 30 September, the headquarters of ATC itself relocated to Randolph from Scott Air Force Base, Illinois. In early 1958 ATC assumed responsibility for all Air Force training activities and all other training commands including the Flying Training Air Force were abolished. The 3510th CCTW was redesignated the 3510th Flying Training Wing on 1 June 1958 with the primary mission of qualifying USAF jet pilots.
The Lockheed T-33 Shooting Star was the workhorse trainer during the 1950s and 1960s at Randolph AFB. In 1961 pilot instructor training (PIT) returned to the 3510th Flying Training Wing. Randolph became the Air Force&#x27;s primary PIT base as the Air Force completely revamped its pilot training program, abolishing the nine independent pilot training squadrons (contract instructors) that had been performing primary training for a decade and gearing up to conduct all undergraduate pilot training (UPT) in jet aircraft. Class 62-FZ produced 25 pilots who completed their training in the new Northrop T-38 Talon, then undergoing test and evaluation, only the second class of candidates to receive their wings at Randolph (Class 42-X was the first class to do so). Requirements for new pilots during the Vietnam War saw PIT shifted again, from Randolph to Perrin and Tyndall Air Force Bases, and on 16 May 1967, while retaining its &quot;flying training&quot; designation, Randolph resumed primary training in the Cessna T-37 to become the ninth UPT wing. 1,269 pilots earned their wings at Randolph before UPT was discontinued at Randolph on 2 October 1971. The PIT squadrons at Perrin and Tyndall both returned to Randolph in June 1971 and it became the only source of UPT instructor pilots for the USAF.

To preserve the lineage and histories of combat units, the Air Force directed ATC to replace its four-digit flying and pilot training wings with two-digit designations. The 3510th FTW became the 12th Flying Training Wing (12 FTW) on 1 May 1972, taking on the designation of the tactical fighter wing inactivated in Vietnam the previous November.

=== 1980s to 2010 ===

Today, the 12 FTW provides instructor pilot training and refresher/recurrency training in the T-6A Texan II, T-38C Talon and T-1A Jayhawk. 

The wing previously operated the T-43A Bobcat and T-37B in support of Specialized Undergraduate Navigator Training (SUNT) at Randolph, a mission it assumed following the 1993 Base Realignment and Closure (BRAC) closure of Mather AFB, California and inactivation of the 323d Flying Training Wing which had previously conducted Interservice Undergraduate Navigator Training (IUNT). SUNT trained prospective USAF Navigators/Combat Systems Officers destined for the B-52 Stratofortress, E-3 Sentry, E-8 Joint STARS, RC-135, non-PACER CRAG KC-135 Stratotanker, and all C-130 Hercules variants, as well as prospective Naval Flight Officers enroute to fly land-based U.S. Navy P-3C Orion, EP-3 Aries and E-6 Mercury aircraft.

The 12 FTW also provided training to numerous NATO/Allied officer students via SUNT, as well as supporting Marine Corps and Coast Guard enlisted navigator training via the Marine Aerial Navigation School (MANS). The Marine Aerial Navigation School remained at Randolph until the school was decommissioned with the graduation of Class 04–01 on 31 July 2004 as the Marine Corps transitioned to the KC-130J and the Coast Guard to their version of the HC-130J, both of which eliminated the enlisted navigator position. Advanced Electronic Warfare Officer (EWO) training was also conducted by the 12 FTW for those navigators/CSOs destined for eventual assignment as USAF EWOs.

With the retirement of the T-37 from USAF service in 2009, the retirement of the T-43 in 2010, and the redesignation of USAF Navigators as Combat Systems Officers (CSO), SUNT was disestablished at Randolph AFB and replaced by Undergraduate Combat Systems Officer Training (UCSOT) under the 479th Flying Training Group (479 FTG), a geographically separated unit (GSU) of the 12 FTW located at NAS Pensacola, Florida. The 479 FTG flies the T-6A and T-1A to conduct UCSOT, training prospective USAF CSOs for the B-52, E-3, RC-135, and all C-130 variants, as well as those USAF CSOs destined for the B-1 Lancer, F-15E Strike Eagle and the USN EA-18G Growler who were previously trained at NAS Pensacola by the Navy&#x27;s Training Air Wing SIX (TRAWING SIX). Student Naval Flight Officers enroute to fly land-based U.S. Navy&#x27;s P-8A Poseidon (replacement for the P-3C), the EP-3, and the E-6 previously trained via SUNT are now trained by TRAWING SIX. 

The 12 FTW also operates an additional airfield for practice approaches and touch-and-go landings approximately 12 miles east-northeast of Randolph in Seguin, Texas. Known as Randolph AFB Auxiliary Field/Seguin Field, this airfield was originally constructed with three runways in 1941. Normally unattended, the airfield has a single active 8350-ft runway and is supported by a manned runway supervisor unit (RSU) and aircraft rescue and fire fighting (ARFF) vehicles when conducting flight operations.

Randolph has also completed major renovations to the Base Commissary as well as completely re-paving Harmon Drive, the main entrance to the base leading to &quot;The Taj&quot;. Additional plans include construction of a new Base Exchange, which is managed by the Army and Air Force Exchange Service (AAFES).

=== Merger (2010) ===
The 12th FTW remained the host unit at Randolph AFB for nearly 38 years, until 31 January 2010, when the 502d Air Base Wing became the host unit after Randolph became a component of Joint Base San Antonio.

The base was listed as a census-designated place for statistical purposes, with a population of 1,241 counted at the 2010 census.

<text>El Rito Presbyterian Church is a church in Chacón, New Mexico

Early settlers came to Chacón (El Rito de Agua Negra) from Chamisal, where they were reportedly persecuted because of their Protestant beliefs. Their faith was enriched through the study of Spanish Bibles, provided by the Sandoval, Arqüello, and Ortega families. A school was started by the Arqüello&#x27;s, which further encouraged Bible reading. In 1879, the group was organized as El Rito Presbyterian Church by the Rev. John Annin, the minister in Las Vegas, New Mexico. Elder Juan P Ortega, licensed as a lay evangelist, preached at Chacón through the 1880s. In the 1890s, the congregation was served by the Rev Joseph J. Gilchrist, who also produced a Protestant newspaper in Spanish, and trained local men to work as evangelists.

Native-born ministers educated at Presbyterian schools and colleges in New Mexico and elsewhere, predominated at Chacón from 1900 to 1958. During this period, an elementary school, staffed by women teachers from the Presbyterian Board of National Missions, taught children and sent them on to Allison-James in Santa Fe and Menaul School in Albuquerque, both in New Mexico. The school nourished the church, and also served the community as advocates, clinic and community center.

The church grew steadily until the 1930s, becoming one of the largest Spanish-language congregations in the Presbyterian Church. Numerous teachers, ministers, and Christian lay workers were sent out from El Rito. But the Great Depression, a decline in farming and World War II caused many families to relocate. At the seventy-fifth anniversary, the Rev Epifanio Romero compared the church to a rural irrigation system: &quot;The water has been drained off to water the fields below. It has spent itself giving life to plants which would have suffered. And perhaps would have been lost otherwise...Our people left the community but are giving life and strength to churches in different places...Some have served [in mission work], some are still serving, still others are ready to start this very year of 1954.&quot; Over the years, members of the church have gone to serve as teachers, nurses, agronomists, administrators, ministers, and in other capacities across the United States and abroad.

Lay leadership from within the congregation has maintained the church over its life. Whenever a minister was not present, the members conducted worship services. The buildings have been maintained and improved, Bible school held, special events organized, and diaconal work continued by the members with help from many friends across the Presbyterian Church.

The community continues to change as families return after an absence of many years, challenged to continue the ministry, handing on the gifts that were given many years ago: knowledge of the Bible, and the certainty of God&#x27;s unfolding purpose for their lives.

<text>Joanna Gleason (née Joanne Hall; born June 2, 1950) is a Canadian-American actress and singer, known for her performances in theatrical musicals and plays, and on film and television.

In theatre, Gleason originated the role of the Baker&#x27;s Wife in Stephen Sondheim and James Lapine&#x27;s &quot;Into the Woods&quot; on Broadway, for which she won the Tony Award for Best Leading Actress in a Musical and the Drama Desk Award for Outstanding Featured Actress in a Musical in 1988. She also received Tony nominations for her performances in &quot;A Day in the Death of Joe Egg&quot; (1985) and &quot;Dirty Rotten Scoundrels&quot; (2005). Her notable film appearances include supporting roles in Woody Allen&#x27;s &quot;Hannah and Her Sisters&quot; (1986) and &quot;Crimes and Misdemeanors&quot; (1989), and Paul Thomas Anderson&#x27;s &quot;Boogie Nights&quot; (1997). On television she has appeared in &quot;ER&quot;, &quot;Friends&quot;, &quot;The West Wing&quot;, &quot;The Good Wife&quot; and &quot;The Affair&quot;.

==Early life==
Joanne Hall was born in Toronto, the eldest of three siblings born to television producer and game show personality Monty Hall, and his wife, Marilyn (née Plottel), both of whom died in 2017. At the time of her birth, her father was working at the Canada Wheat Board and had changed his name from to Hall. He later started his TV career and went on to fame as host of &quot;Let&#x27;s Make a Deal&quot;. In May 1956, the Hall family moved to New York and, in the early 1960s, they moved to Los Angeles.

Hall graduated from Beverly Hills High School in 1968. She was in the school&#x27;s productions of &quot;The Music Man, The Mikado, The Grass Harp&quot;, and &quot;The Madwoman of Chaillot&quot;. In high school, Gleason received acting instruction from John Ingle, the soap opera star, who taught at BHHS from 1955 to 1985. She continued her education at UCLA, then Occidental College, from which she graduated. Gleason has been a teacher herself, holding classes and workshops all over the country.

==Career==
===Theatre===
Gleason made her professional debut in &quot;Promises, Promises&quot; in 1972. Five years later she debuted on Broadway, originating the role of Monica in Cy Coleman and Michael Stewart&#x27;s &quot;I Love My Wife&quot; (1977), for which she was honored with a Theatre World Award.

Gleason returned to Broadway in 1984 to appear in Tom Stoppard&#x27;s &quot;The Real Thing&quot;, as a replacement for the role of Charlotte originated by Christine Baranski. In 1985 she played Pam in a revival of Peter Nichols&#x27; &quot;A Day in the Death of Joe Egg&quot;, for which she was nominated for the Tony Award for Best Featured Actress in a Play and the Drama Desk Award for Outstanding Featured Actress in a Play. She won the Drama Desk Award in the same category the following year for her performances off-Broadway as Virginia in Terrence McNally&#x27;s &quot;It&#x27;s Only a Play&quot; and Trudy in Andrew Bergman&#x27;s &quot;Social Security&quot;.

Gleason had her greatest success as the original Baker&#x27;s Wife in &quot;Into the Woods&quot; by Stephen Sondheim and James Lapine, firstly at the Old Globe Theatre, San Diego in 1986, before transferring to Broadway the following year. The &quot;New York Times&quot;, although somewhat critical of the production, described her as &quot;wonderful,&quot; and she won both the Tony Award for Best Leading Actress in a Musical (presented by her co-star Bernadette Peters) and the Drama Desk Award for Outstanding Featured Actress in a Musical. Her performance was captured on the original cast recording and in a filmed version broadcast on the PBS anthology series &quot;Great Performances&quot;.

In 1991 Gleason played the lead role of Nora Charles in Arthur Laurents, Charles Strouse and Richard Maltby Jr.&#x27;s &quot;Nick &amp; Nora&quot;, a musical adaptation of &quot;The Thin Man&quot; that encountered numerous troubles in previews and closed after only nine performances. As Muriel in the musical adaptation of &quot;Dirty Rotten Scoundrels&quot; (2005), she was nominated for the Tony Award for Best Featured Actress in a Musical. The following year she played Titsiana in Douglas Carter Beane&#x27;s &quot;The Cartells&quot;, a staged soap opera in which the &quot;New York Times&quot; deemed her &quot;hilarious.&quot;

In 2007, Gleason was honored by the New England Theatre Conference with a Special Award for Achievement in Theatre.

===Film &amp; Television===
In 1979, Gleason was cast as supporting character Morgan in the television sitcom &quot;Hello, Larry&quot; starring McLean Stevenson; the series ran for two seasons but was poorly received. In the 1983 television movie &quot;Still the Beaver&quot;, she played Beaver&#x27;s ex-wife Kimberly.

Gleason debuted on film in 1986, with roles in Woody Allen&#x27;s &quot;Hannah and Her Sisters&quot; (as Carol) and Mike Nichols&#x27; &quot;Heartburn&quot; (as Diana). She worked with Allen again in &quot;Crimes and Misdemeanors&quot; (1989), playing Wendy, the wife of Allen&#x27;s character. She has since appeared in numerous films including &quot;F/X2&quot; (1991), &quot;Mr. Holland&#x27;s Opus&quot; (1995), &quot;The Wedding Planner&quot; (2001), and &quot;Sex and the City&quot; (2004). She played the memorable role of Dirk&#x27;s mother opposite Mark Wahlberg in Paul Thomas Anderson&#x27;s &quot;Boogie Nights&quot; (1997).

On television, Gleason played the role of Nadine Berkus on the show &quot;Love &amp; War&quot; (1992–95), several episodes of which she also directed, and Joan Silver on &quot;Temporarily Yours&quot; (1997). She starred in the Lifetime series &quot;Oh Baby&quot; as Charlotte from 1998 to 2000, also directing episodes of this show. Shortly following the end of this series, she starred opposite Bette Midler on &quot;Bette&quot; as agent Connie Randolph. She appeared in six episodes of the Canadian black comedy series &quot;Sensitive Skin&quot; as Veronica, from 2014 to 2016.

Gleason&#x27;s numerous guest starring television credits include episodes of &quot;The West Wing&quot;, &quot;The Practice&quot;, &quot;King of the Hill&quot;, &quot;Friends&quot;, &quot;Password Plus&quot;, &quot;Tracey Takes On...&quot;, &quot;Murphy Brown&quot;, &quot;ER&quot;, &quot;The Outer Limits&quot;, &quot;The Good Wife&quot;, &quot;Blue Bloods&quot; and &quot;The Newsroom&quot;.

==Personal life==
Gleason has been married three times. She was married to acting coach Paul G. Gleason. She kept his surname professionally, although they divorced on June 28, 1982. Later, she married Michael Bennahum. Gleason has one child, Aaron David Gleason, from her first marriage.

Gleason has been married to actor Chris Sarandon since 1994. The two met while performing in Broadway&#x27;s short-lived 1991 musical &quot;Nick &amp; Nora&quot;, returned to the stage together in &quot;Thorn and Bloom&quot; (1998), and collaborated on several films, such as &quot;Road Ends&quot;, &quot;Edie &amp; Pen&quot;, &quot;Let the Devil Wear Black&quot;, and &quot;American Perfekt&quot;.

Gleason&#x27;s siblings are television writer/director Sharon Hall Kessler and Emmy award-winning television writer/director Richard Hall.

<text>Peterson Space Force Base, previously Peterson Air Force Base, Peterson Field, and Army Air Base, Colorado Springs, is a United States Space Force base that shares an airfield with the adjacent Colorado Springs Municipal Airport and is home to the North American Aerospace Defense Command (NORAD), the Space Force&#x27;s 21st Space Wing, elements of the Space Force&#x27;s Space Systems Command, and United States Northern Command (USNORTHCOM) headquarters. Developed as a World War II air support base for Camp Carson, the facility conducted Army Air Forces training and supported Cold War air defense centers at the nearby Ent Air Force Base, Chidlaw Building, and Cheyenne Mountain Complex. The base was the location of the Air Force Space Command headquarters from 1987 to 20 December 2019 and has had NORAD/NORTHCOM command center operations since the 2006 Cheyenne Mountain Realignment placed the nearby Cheyenne Mountain Complex on standby. On 26 July 2021, the installation was renamed Peterson Space Force Base to reflect its prominent role in the new space service.

== History ==
Colorado military construction during the buildup of US training installations prior to the bombing of Pearl Harbor included the 1940 Lowry bombardier school at Denver and Camp Carson south of Colorado Springs (HQ completed on 31 January 1942). Sites &quot;in the vicinity of Colorado Springs&quot; were assessed in the summer of 1941 for a USAAF airfield, and during April 1942 the Photographic Reconnaissance Operational Training Unit (PROTU) was activated in a leased facility at Colorado Springs. On 6 May 1942, the site adjacent to the airfield of the 1926 Colorado Springs Municipal Airport was selected, and the airport&#x27;s airfield was subsequently leased as an &quot;air support field&quot;* for Camp Carson under the &quot;air support base development program&quot;. In May 1942, units such as the 5th Mapping Squadron (from Bradley Field) arrived and used city facilities. The &quot;Second Photographic Group Reconnaissance&quot; (activated 7 May 1942 at Will Rogers Field) transferred to Colorado Springs, and the &quot;2nd Group ... headquarters was situated in a former garage across the street from the Post Office, barracks were in the city auditorium ... and the mess hall was located at the busy horseshoe counter of the Santa Fe railway station.&quot; Land at the Broadmoor was used for maneuvers, and the 2nd Group initially operated without aircraft. Personnel were also &quot;housed temporarily at Colorado College&quot; and a youth camp near the Woodmen sanitorium. (the 14th Photographic Reconnaissance Squadron was located at the Kaufman Building on Tejon St.)

=== Army Air Base, Colorado Springs ===
&quot;Army Air Base, Colorado Springs&quot;,* construction began after 10 May 1942, on &quot;nothing more than a large patch of Colorado plain&quot;, and the installation was placed under the Headquarters, United States &quot;AAF [on] 11 June 1942&quot;. The 373d Base HQ and Air Base Sq was activated as the base operating unit on 20 June 1942 (replaced by the 214th AAF Base Unit in 1944), and the base was assigned to the 2nd Air Force on 22 June 1942. On 7 July 1942, &quot;HQ PROTU&quot; was on the &quot;Army Air Base, Colorado Springs&quot; and was ordered to provide &quot;four to five months of training to each individual&quot;. During air base construction, the 20th Combat Mapping Squadron was activated on 23 July 1942, and used the Alamo Garage on Tejon Street. Runways were completed in August 1942, and eponym 1st Lt Edward J. Peterson crashed 8 August 1942 on take off (1st Coloradoan killed at the airfield.)

=== Peterson Field ===
Peterson Field was the airfield named on 13 December 1942, and included the runway used by both the municipal airport and the military installation: &quot;Army Air Base, Peterson Field&quot;, which had begun publishing the &quot;Wingspread&quot; base newspaper by 11 July 1942. The &quot;18 Dep Rpr Sq&quot; was assigned to the military installation from 19 January – 29 April 1943, and the installation was assigned to the Third Air Force (5 March – 1 October 1943) and by the end of the 1943 summer had tar paper barracks, an officer&#x27;s club, and a theater in a Quonset. After the base transferred to Second Air Force on 1 October 1943, in June 1944 Peterson Field began fighter pilot training with P-40N Warhawks. &quot;In March 1943 the Third Air Force took over the photographic reconnaissance Operational Training Unit which had been operating at Peterson Field ... under the direct control of the Director of Photography since April 1942&quot;.

=== Bomber Commands ===
The 4th Heavy Bombardment Processing Headquarters (&quot;4 H Bomb Processing HQ&quot;) was activated on 10 June 1943 (the 1st B-29 landed at Peterson Field in the summer of 1943), and bomber training by the 214th AAF Base Unit (Combat Crew Training School, Heavy) B-24 Liberator) began after the 383rd Bombardment Group relocated from Geiger Field, Washington on 26 October 1943. In 1944 (11 June – 20 October), the XXI Bomber Command was assigned to Peterson; and the &quot;HQ and HQ Sq&quot; of XXII Bomber Command was assigned 14 October 1944 – 13 February 1945, and by 17 August 1944, 4 bomb wings (313th through 316th) were assigned to the base — the last left on 7 June 1945. The 263rd AAF Base Unit became the Peterson &quot;base operating unit&quot; on 8 March 1945 (transferred to Andrews Field on 17 March 1946). The Army Air Forces Instructor School opened at Peterson Field in April 1945, and the base was one of several that transferred to Continental Air Forces on 16 April 1945. (VIII Bomber Command arrived 17 August 1945).

The base was inactivated 31 December 1945 after the 13th Bombardment Wing (17 October) and VIII Bomber Command () departed, and site management by the base operating unit ended on 17 December 1945. In 1946, Peterson&#x27;s last AAF Base Units were discontinued: 260th AAF Base Unit (Fighter Wing) in January, the 202nd AAF Base Unit (Special) in February, and the 268th AAF Base Unit (Instrument Instructor Unit) in March and the 201st (Headquarters Base Unit) in April (the 72nd Fighter Wing was at the base from &quot;4 January 1946 - 9 April 1946&quot;). The 703rd AAF Base Unit (Hq, 53d AACS Group) moved to Kelly Field in February. Designated surplus on 29 July 1946, &quot;the U.S. Government returned control of the [air]field to the City of Colorado Springs&quot;. Many of the base buildings were torn down. In 1946, Tonopah AAF (Nevada, on 1 October), Clovis AAF (New Mexico, 16 October), and Casper AAF (Wyoming, on 15 December) became detached installations of the inactive base for a short period.

During planning for the new United States Air Force, Colorado&#x27;s Arlington Auxiliary Army Airfield became a detached installation of the surplus base (1 January – 1947), and the &quot;468th Construction Co (15th AF)&quot; became the inactive base&#x27;s operating unit in February 1947. The base with new construction was activated 29 September 1947 – 15 January 1948, then was &quot;surplus&quot; until after the notice in November 1950 to reactivate Air Defense Command. The &quot;23 Photo Sq 19 May 1943-9 August 1948&quot; remained throughout both inactive/surplus periods, and the &quot;4600 Maint &amp; Sup Sq&quot; was established at the surplus base on 1 December 1950).

=== USAF installation ===
The military base at the municipal field reactivated as an off-base installation of Ent Air Force Base on 1 January 1951 and was operated by Ent&#x27;s 4600 Air Base Group. After being assigned to Peterson on 1 March 1952, the 4602d Air Intelligence Service Squadron had subordinate organizations at the &quot;Defense Force Headquarters [on] Hamilton Air Force Base, California, at Kansas City, Missouri, and at Stewart Air Force Base&quot; New York. The 4600th Group became the 4600th Air Base Wing on 8 April 1958 (moved to Peterson on 18 October 1972). The 4600th was replaced by the 46th Aerospace Defense Wing on 1 April 1975. In January 1968, Air Training Command&#x27;s 3253d Pilot Training Squadron at Peterson Field began light aircraft indoctrination for cadets. These operations moved to the United States Air Force Academy on 21 March 1974. The military base at Peterson Field gained its own base commander on 28 February 1975.

=== Primary installation === 
Designated Peterson Air Force Base on 1 March 1975, when Ent AFB was being closed, Peterson was the last of the April 1945 Continental Air Forces airbases to be named an air force base. Also on 1 March, Peterson assumed several functions from Ent AFB, which became the &quot;Ent Annex&quot; of Peterson, 18 July 1975 – 7 February 1978 (Peterson&#x27;s off-base &quot;Temporary Military Facility&quot; was opened for space training by 1986). During the first part of the reorganization that broke up ADCOM, the base &quot;transferred to the Strategic Air Command&quot; on 1 October 1979 (units transferred included the 47th Comm Sq to AFCS and the 46th Wing and 4602nd Computer Services Sq to SAC). ADCOM HQ offices at the Chidlaw Building became the Aerospace Defense Center at Peterson on 1 December 1979.

Peterson&#x27;s NORAD COC Backup Facility achieved Full Operational Capability on 16 November 1982 from the Cheyenne Mountain Complex which was placed on warm standby.

The 1st Space Wing replaced the 46th Aerospace Defense Wing on 1 April 1983. Thereafter the 1st Space Wing transferred host unit responsibility to the 3d Space Support Wing activated on 15 October 1986. Army and other units transferred from the former Ent AFB Federal Building to Peterson Building 2 (renamed the Eberhart-Findley Building in October 2012). On 15 May 1992, the personnel and equipment of both the 1st SW and 3d SSW merged to become the 21st Space Wing. Peterson&#x27;s Space Analysis Center was at the corner of Academy &amp; Fountain Blvds by 2004 before moving on base to bldg 1470, and in 2004 the Space Operations School used a building along I-25 at Woodmen Drive.

The Cheyenne Mountain Realignment moved NORAD/USNORTHCOM operations to Peterson AFB in 2006. In 2006, the 76th Space Control Facility was constructed at Peterson (the squadron activated 22 January 2008). The MAFFS aircraft that fought the 2012 Waldo Canyon fire and 2013 Black Forest fire at Colorado Springs flew from Peterson AFB.

Some buildings from the Second World War have survived. Buildings remaining in 1996 were &quot;the terminal, now the Peterson Air and Space Museum, the Broadmoor hangar, and the Spanish House&quot; next to the museum, along with Building 391, Building 365, supply warehouses and office buildings, and aircraft hangars and maintenance shops.

The base&#x27;s Retiree Activities Office has the representative for the Air Force Retiree Council Area IV (Colorado, Nevada, Utah, and Wyoming).

On 20 December 2019, Air Force Space Command was redesignated as the U.S. Space Force and elevated to become an independent military branch. With the new military branch, the Fourteenth Air Force and its units became Space Force Space Operations Command and Air Force Space Command&#x27;s headquarters was redesignated as the Pentagon.

Despite the number of vintage records with &quot;Army Air Base, Colorado Springs&quot;, Mueller in 1989 (p. 471) claims the military installation next to the municipal airfield was initially named &quot;Air Support Command Base&quot; in May 1942, but does not identify an Air Support Command headquarters ever being at the air base, nor that base was even assigned to one of the support commands.

<doc id="843666" wikidata="Q2454516" url="?curid=843666" title="List of gaps in Interstate Highways">
<text>There are gaps in the Interstate Highway System where the roadway carrying an Interstate shield does not conform to the standards set by the Federal Highway Administration (FHWA), the body that sets the regulations for the Interstate Highway System. For the most part, the Interstate Highway System in the United States is a connected system, with most freeways completed; however, some Interstates still have gaps. These gaps can be due to unconnected segments of the same route or from failure of the road to fully conform to Interstate standards by including such characteristics as at-grade crossings, traffic lights, undivided or narrow freeways, or movable bridges (lift bridges and drawbridges).

==True gaps==
True gaps are where multiple disjoint sections of road have the same Interstate highway number and can reasonably be considered part of &quot;one highway&quot; in theory, based on the directness of connections via other highways, or based on future plans to fill in the gap in the Interstate, or simply based on the shortness of the gap. The sections are either not physically connected at all, or they are connected but the connection is not signed as part of the highway. This list does not include different highways that share the same number, such as the two different I-84s, which despite appearances, were always intended as distinct highways and were never intended as a contiguous route.

===Interstate 26===
In North Carolina, Interstate 26 has a gap from Forks of Ivy to Asheville at exit 4A of Interstate 240. This is because not all of the parts in the gap were built to Interstate standards. As of November 2023, Interstate 26 is designated as Future I-26, US 19, and US 23. Construction on building this gap to Interstate Standards was scheduled to start in 2022.

===Interstate 42===
In North Carolina, Interstate 42 has a gap from Clayton to Goldsboro. This is because the corridor that the Interstate will be on is not up to standards or is unbuilt. North Carolina plans to complete I-42 by 2032.

===Interstate 49===
Interstate 49 (I-49) currently has three sections: the original alignment from I-10 in Lafayette to I-20 in Shreveport, one from I-220 near Shreveport to Texarkana; and the third section from I-40 near Alma, Arkansas to I-470/I-435 south of Kansas City, Missouri. A bypass south of Bella Vista, Arkansas was completed in 2021, and existed initially as Arkansas Highway 549; the latter designation is now used on a short section southeast of Fort Smith that is several miles long. It is planned to be connected to an interstate with a project to construct a new roadway from Arkansas Highway 22 to Interstate 40 in Arkansas. I-49 from Fort Smith to Texarkana is still unbuilt. These gaps are expected to be eventually closed.

===Interstate 69===
I-69 currently has several disconnected segments: the northernmost segment travels from near Evansville, Indiana, to Port Huron, Michigan. A second alignment located entirely within the state of Kentucky runs from the Tennessee state line at Fulton to Henderson. On October 2, 2006, a segment of I-69 opened in Tunica and DeSoto counties in Mississippi; this segment has since been continued (but is not signed) through Memphis, Tennessee, to an intersection with U.S. Highway 51 on the north side. Between 2012 and 2015, a portion of U.S. Highway 59 (US 59) between Rosenberg and Cleveland, Texas, extending through Houston, became part of I-69. In South Texas, I-69&#x27;s route splits into three spurs to cities on the U.S.–Mexico border, on which four segments are complete: a short segment of I-69E in Corpus Christi and another from Raymondville to the border in Brownsville; a short segment of I-69C in Edinburg and McAllen; and a very short segment of I-69W adjacent to the border in Laredo.

As of 2025, projects to connect these segments are in varying stages of development. Kentucky and Indiana began construction of the eastern bypass of Henderson and new Ohio River Crossing, connecting the Kentucky and Indiana sections, in 2022. This segment has a tentative completion date of 2031. Kentucky has plans to work with Tennessee to reconstruct the current interchange at the south end of their segment in South Fulton to provide a free-flow connection to the existing US 51 freeway to Union City. Tennessee finished constructing a bypass of Union City in 2021 currently designated as SR 690. A further bypass of Troy is proposed but not yet funded, which would complete a freeway-standard route from I-155 in Dyersburg to Henderson. Tennessee has deferred plans to complete the section between Dyersburg and Memphis to close the gap until the South Fulton–Dyersburg section is completed. The section from Memphis to Houston is the least developed; as of 2021, Mississippi has no current plans to extend I-69 further south, and the states of Louisiana and Arkansas have not funded construction of their portion of the proposed route (via El Dorado and Shreveport) between Mississippi and Texas, other than a two-lane southern bypass of Monticello, Arkansas designed to be incorporated into I-69 at a later date. Texas has continued to fund projects to upgrade U.S. 59, U.S. 77, U.S. 281, and other routes that would eventually form parts of I-69 in South Texas and East Texas, including the I-69W/C/E spurs.

===Interstate 74===
I-74 currently has five sections, the original segment heading northwest from Cincinnati, Ohio, to Davenport, Iowa; one from the Virginia–North Carolina line along I-77 south and east to a point southeast of Mount Airy, North Carolina; one traveling around High Point connecting with I-85 and reaching I-73, where the two are concurrent until Ellerbe; and from west of Laurinburg to south of Lumberton, North Carolina, at I-95. North Carolina is currently working on connecting all its sections of I-74.

===Interstate 86===
The eastern I-86 has had two sections since 2006. One travels for from I-90 in North East, Pennsylvania (which is a town in the northwestern part of the state) to exit 61 in Waverly, New York. The second section is a stretch outside of Binghamton traveling from I-81 in Kirkwood to exit 79 in Windsor. The gap is signed as Future 86. I-86 will eventually travel from North East, Pennsylvania, to the New York State Thruway (I-87) near Harriman, New York. All the designated sections and gaps in New York are part of New York State Route 17.

===Interstate 99===
As of 2023, I-99 has two sections: one from the Pennsylvania Turnpike to just south of I-80, concurrent with US 220, and one from the Pennsylvania–New York state line north to I-86 in Corning, New York, concurrent with US 15. Much of the intervening route, including the entire US 15 section between I-180 in Williamsport and the New York state line, has been constructed to freeway standards but as of yet is not signed as part of I-99.

The signing of the intervening route as I-99 will be completed when the route is upgraded to Interstate standards, connecting the two segments of I-99.

===Interstate 695===
When the Francis Scott Key Bridge in Baltimore, Maryland, collapsed in 2024, a segment of I-695 would physically disappear for some time as a consequence of the bridge collapse. At the time of the collapse, the section of highway was legally Maryland Route 695, but this section was redesignated I-695 by the American Association of State Highway and Transportation Officials in April 2024.

==Freeway gaps==
Freeway gaps occur where the Interstate is signed as a continuous route, but part, if not all of it, is not up to freeway standards. This includes drawbridges where traffic on the Interstate can be stopped for vessels. This does not include facilities such as tollbooths, toll plazas, agricultural inspection stations, or border stations.

===At-grade intersections===
====Major at-grade intersections====
In urban and heavily developed areas, Interstates may travel along surface roads or have at-grade intersections with stop signs or traffic lights. This usually happens because the Interstate started construction after the land was heavily developed and buildings such as residences and businesses and other roads would have to be removed to allow a freeway to pass through. Additionally, more developed land would have to be cleared for space to build interchanges to connect the Interstate and surface streets. This situation is extremely uncommon as Interstates are usually built around cities or through them on pre- or lightly developed land.

* I-516 downgrades to an expressway as it heads toward its eastern terminus. The expressway features a frontage road right turn and an at-grade intersection with Mildred Street close to the terminus at Montgomery Street and Derenne Avenue (SR 21) in Savannah, Georgia. Mildred Street southbound is closed by concrete barriers.
* I-19 between North West Street and its southern terminus at West Crawford Street at North Sonoita Avenue, in Nogales, Arizona, consists of surface streets with traffic lights. The signage of this segment is intended to help direct traffic entering from Mexico to the nearest interstate.
* I-69E in Brownsville, Texas passes through an at-grade signalized intersection with University Boulevard, as well as a minor intersection with Courage Street, before passing through the Brownsville – Veterans Port of Entry and crossing the Veterans International Bridge.
* I-169 in Brownsville, Texas is a divided frontage road with no parts built to Interstate standard; it runs parallel to the SH 550 Toll expressway and consists of a single 4-way stop intersection, a railroad crossing, and four traffic lights, two on each side. I-169 signage ends slightly east of Paredes Line Road to where the frontage road ends, approximately 4.1 miles from the I-69E interchange. The remaining portion of I-169, which ends at SH 48, is unsigned and has a 2-lane, limited-access toll-only segment starting from where FM 511 diverges.
* I-70 uses part of US 30 along a surface road in Breezewood, Pennsylvania at the eastern end of its concurrency with I-76 on the Pennsylvania Turnpike. Traffic traveling eastbound on the Turnpike must exit and travel a short distance on US 30 in order to continue south on I-70 heading to Hancock, Maryland. (The routing is similar for traffic following I-70 in the opposite direction: traffic traveling north on I-70 must exit and travel a short distance on US 30 in order to enter the Turnpike.) This is one of very few instances of traffic lights on an Interstate. There was formerly a sign of a policeman pointing at drivers leaving the Pennsylvania Turnpike to enter US 30, saying, &quot;You! Slow Down!&quot; Local businesses have lobbied to keep the gap to avoid a perceived potential loss of business. Despite this, the Pennsylvania Turnpike has announced plans to close this gap by directly connecting I-70 to the Turnpike in September 2024. 
* I-676 has a surface street section at the west end of the Ben Franklin Bridge in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, because of historically significant areas. Signage and the Federal Highway Administration consider I-676 to use the surface streets; the Pennsylvania Department of Transportation and the New Jersey Department of Transportation consider I-676 to be continuous across the Ben Franklin Bridge, even though the bridge, built in 1926, is not up to Interstate standards. This does not specifically violate Interstate standards, however, as the two separated segments of I-676 are in different states.
* I-78 travels along a one-way pair of surface streets, 12th Street and 14th Street, in Jersey City, New Jersey, between the end of the New Jersey Turnpike Newark Bay Extension and the Holland Tunnel, which leads into New York City. Between the two aforementioned points are four signalized intersections.
* I-180 in Cheyenne, Wyoming is an expressway with no parts built to Interstate standard; the interchange with I-80 is a simple diamond interchange with two traffic lights on I-180.
* I-81 near Alexandria, New York before the Thousand Islands Bridge across the Saint Lawrence River has intersections with an off-ramp leading from NY-12 and a service road connecting from the bridge toll station to a police department while also intersecting NY-12.
* I-587 in Kingston, New York has a traffic circle (with yield signs) at its northern terminus with the ramps leading to/from I-87.

====Minor at-grade intersections====
Several Interstates in rural areas of the U.S. have minor at-grade intersections (including median breaks) with farm access roads or authorized vehicle-only driveways used for highway maintenance or connection to nearby utility stations. This is usually due to the lack of an old highway, the need to provide access to property that was accessed via the road prior to its upgrade to an Interstate, and the high cost to construct an interchange for the small amount of traffic that would use such a connection or to build a frontage road parallel to the freeway to the nearest interchange.

* The northbound lanes of I-5 in Washington intersect with an at-level crosswalk approximately south of the border with Canada. This crosswalk allows pedestrians access to a monument that is part of Peace Arch Park.
* I-10 in Hudspeth County, Texas has at least fifteen at-grade intersections containing median breaks with minor dirt or gravel roads.
* I-520 in Augusta, Georgia has an at-grade intersection with a gravel and asphalt road that provides access to Lovers Lane.
* I-40 in the mountains of western North Carolina has at-grade access to several dirt roads, as well as a partially grade-separated interchange that lacks ramps or RIROs where roads directly connect to the I-40 carriageways.
* I-40 in western Texas has eight at-grade access points for cattle ranches with median breaks.
* I-94 at Fort Custer west of Battle Creek, Michigan is the only instance of an Interstate freeway in Michigan to have a gated driveway (at 44th Street), which facilitates access of military vehicles.

===Undivided and narrow freeways===

This section addresses two-lane freeways and other narrow or undivided freeway sections of the Interstate, excepting instances of continuing routes using one-lane ramps and merge leads. Narrow gaps between opposing directions with jersey barriers taller than are excluded from this section; therefore the separation criterion is really either a wall, or a median, whichever is greater.
* I-40&#x27;s western in North Carolina in the Harmon Den Wildlife Management Area has several S-curves, a Jersey barrier with extremely narrow left shoulders and a few at-grade intersections albeit in RIRO style.
* I-55 enters Tennessee from Arkansas on the Memphis and Arkansas Bridge, which itself merits mention as a narrow through truss bridge. Just east of the bridge I-55 transitions from its east–west river crossing to the north–south alignment heading toward Jackson, Mississippi. There is an interchange that forces through I-55 traffic to enter and exit in an old cloverleaf; in 2015 improvements were announced but are stalled. The improvements to the I-55 / Crump Boulevard interchange will be accomplished by constructing new through travel lanes for mainline I-55 traffic, which will eliminate the requirement for interstate traffic to use single-lane, low-speed ramps in order to continue on I-55. A new multi-lane roundabout intersection will be constructed to replace the existing cloverleaf interchange and provide improved access to and from I-55 and existing local roadways.
* I-555 at its southern terminus through the I-55/U.S. 61/AR 77 interchange becomes a two-lane undivided highway for .
* Interstate 70 is one-lane only in these following locations:
**Interstate 70 in Kansas has only one lane for eastbound through traffic for several hundred feet in Kansas City where the highway approaches the Lewis and Clark Viaduct Bridge, which carries the highway over the Kansas River toward Kansas City, Missouri. Interstate 670, just a few blocks south provides an alternate route without this bottleneck.
** Interstate 70 in West Virginia has only one lane for approximately one thousand feet in Wheeling, where the highway enters the Wheeling Tunnel and crosses the Ohio River on the Fort Henry Bridge. Nearby I-470 provides relief from this situation.
* The Mackinac Bridge, which carries I-75 over the Straits of Mackinac between St. Ignace and Mackinaw City, Michigan, has no wide median or hard shoulders due to space constraints. Nor does it have a Jersey barrier; instead, it has either a yellow divider between the opposing directions (where the inner lanes are a metal grate) or a flat double-yellow line (where the inner lanes are paved). The speed limit is also reduced to for cars and for trucks. The highway returns to Interstate standard for about 50 miles until it reaches the Sault Ste. Marie International Bridge, which carries undivided lanes to the Canada–US border in the middle of the bridge, where I-75 terminates.
* The Thousand Islands Bridge, which carries I-81 over part of the Saint Lawrence River, is an undivided two-lane road.
* I-93 is a two-lane divided parkway, or a &quot;super two&quot;, through Franconia Notch in New Hampshire. A four-lane Interstate Highway was once proposed here, but the concept was abandoned because of environmental concerns, in part because of vibrations that could harm the Old Man of the Mountain rock formation (which collapsed in 2003 regardless). This section of highway was for many years marked as US 3 and &quot;To I-93&quot;, but these have now been replaced with regular I-93 signs. The Federal Highway Act of 1973 exempts this stretch from the Interstate Highway standards that apply elsewhere, and this highway is considered to be I-93 for all practical purposes. This section of I-93 in New Hampshire is now the only remaining multi-mile section of two-lane freeway on an Interstate Highway in the United States. In addition, parking along portions of I-93 through Franconia Notch was permitted until early 2019 when barriers and signage were posted due to safety concerns.
* Some stretches of Interstate highway use a barrier transfer machine on some bridges to convert inner lanes from one direction to the other, where it would be too costly to upgrade/rebuild to a higher-capacity bridge. In any case the traffic distribution is strongly asymmetric depending on the hour of the day. This kind of bridge typically contains undivided lanes without the flexible Jersey barrier that is manipulated by machines.

===Movable bridges===

By Interstate standard, all bridges on the Interstate system must be fixed as to not interrupt the flow of traffic. Several bridges on the system, however, are movable:
* I-5 crosses the Columbia River from Portland, Oregon, to Vancouver, Washington, on the Interstate Bridge, a vertical-lift bridge. The Columbia River Crossing project sought to replace this bridge until being abandoned in 2013. However, in 2019, a new project was approved, scheduled to begin work in 2025. 
* I-110 has a drawbridge across the Back Bay of Biloxi in Biloxi, Mississippi.
* I-64—the Hampton Roads Beltway—crosses the South Branch Elizabeth River in Chesapeake, Virginia, on the High Rise Bridge, which is a drawbridge, expected to be replaced by a larger fixed bridge. It opened in July 2022.
* I-264 has a drawbridge, the Berkley Bridge, crossing the Elizabeth River in Norfolk, Virginia.
* I-278 has a drawbridge across the Bronx River in New York City.
* I-280 has a vertical-lift bridge, the Stickel Memorial Bridge, crossing over the Passaic River between Newark and Harrison, New Jersey.
* I-95/I-495 pass together as the Capital Beltway over the Potomac River on the Woodrow Wilson Bridge, a double-leaf bascule span. Even though the original bridge was replaced in the 2000s, the new bridge also has a draw span, albeit with more vertical clearance resulting in fewer openings than the old bridge—about 65 per year, an average of about one every six days.
* I-695 has a drawbridge over Curtis Creek, south of Baltimore and just west of the Francis Scott Key Bridge. This section of the Baltimore Beltway is not part of the Interstate Highway System, however, and is officially Maryland Route 695 despite the Interstate signage on the highway.

===Freeway-to-freeway crosspaths without direct connection===
* I-271 in Ohio lacks a direct interchange with the Ohio Turnpike (I-80); traffic interchanges between the two via I-77 and Ohio State Route 8, which both pass nearby.
* I-475 has no direct interchange with the Ohio Turnpike (I-80/I-90) near Toledo, though there is an indirect connection via US 20 and Dussel Drive.
* I-476 does not have a direct interchange with I-78 in Allentown, Pennsylvania, though there is an indirect connection via US 22 and PA 309. I-476 also has an indirect connection to I-81 in Dupont via a short stretch of PA 315, in addition to a direct connection at the turnpike&#x27;s northern terminus in Clarks Summit. Additionally, while it connects directly to I-80 near White Haven, the freeway-grade is disrupted when the ramps intersect PA 940.
* I-81 connects to the Pennsylvania Turnpike (I-76) via a stretch of US 11 in Carlisle, Pennsylvania.
* The Massachusetts Turnpike (I-90) passes over I-391 without interchange in Chicopee, Massachusetts. The overpass is about north of the I-391 southern terminus at I-91, and approximately from the Mass Pike interchange with I-91 and US 5.
* I-95 (NJ Turnpike Pearl Harbor Memorial Extension) passes under I-295 without interchange in Columbus, New Jersey
* I-195 passes over I-895 without interchange near Halethorpe, Maryland.
* I-295 passes over the Pennsylvania Turnpike (I-276) without direct interchange in Bristol Township, Pennsylvania, though an interchange is under construction that will provide direct connection.
* I-99 has connection gaps with both I-70/I-76 and I-80 in central Pennsylvania, both through at grade roads near Bedford and Bellefonte, Pennsylvania. The latter is expected to become freeway-grade as part of I-99&#x27;s aforementioned northern extension.

====Proposed====
* I-422 (proposed) would have no direct freeway connection to its parent I-22, though the two routes would cross near Adamsville, Alabama.

==Connection gaps==
Auxiliary Interstates (also known as three-digit Interstates) are intended to connect to their parent either directly or via a same-parented Interstate (like I-280 in California being connected to I-80 via I-680). Often, these connection gaps occur to eliminate concurrencies between other three-digit routes. Freeway gaps (signed or unsigned) that officially connect auxiliary routes to the parent are excluded.

===Current examples===

* I-210 in California does not currently connect directly to I-10 or any of its spurs according to freeway signage. It was signed all the way to I-10 until 1998, when California State Route 57 replaced the portion of I-210 through Covina and San Dimas to provide a proper connection to current State Route 210. The former portion of I-210 now known as SR 57 still remains on the Interstate Highway System federally defined as Interstate 210 maintaining its connection to I-10, but it is not signed as per Caltrans tradition to sign state highways by their state definition over their federal definition. State Route 210, built as an extension to replace Route 30, connects to I-10 further east in Redlands, and California is petitioning to have that portion signed as I-210 as well. When that happens, this gap will close.
* I-238 does not have a parent. It was previously a part of California State Route 238 that was built to Interstate standards, and it was added to the Interstate system using the same number it had as a state highway. It was upgraded to be an auxiliary route of I-80, but no three-digit combinations were available at the time the route was designated an interstate. Additionally, the exit numbers continue the mileage from the state highway instead of starting over from 1.
* Due to highway revolts in New York state forcing the interstate to terminate prematurely, none of the spurs of I-78 in New York City (I-278, I-478, I-678, I-878) connect to the parent road I-78, nor is there any surface street with a state route designation with the same number that continues with a solid connection. I-78 was planned to extend southeast through New York City via the Lower Manhattan Expressway, Williamsburg Bridge and Bushwick Expressway, then east along what is now I-878 and north along what is now I-295. I-78 would have then split into two branches (the current I-295 and I-695), which would have both terminated at I-95. I-478 comes the closest, and would have intersected I-78 as part of the Westway project; this project was later canceled. I-278, the only I-78 spur to leave New York City, was planned to extend northwest to I-78 at Route 24. Since all the spurs are interconnected, only one of them needs to be eventually connected to its parent route for all of them to conform to numbering standards.
* I-585 in South Carolina currently does not connect directly to I-85. Until 1995, I-85 was routed along present-day I-85 Business. In that year, I-85 was moved to the north to bypass Spartanburg while I-85 Business took over its former route, leaving I-585 without a connection to its parent route until upgrades to the existing US 176 highway are complete.
* As of July 2022, I-587 in North Carolina does not connect with its parent route, I-87. Upgrades to the existing US 264 freeway from US 64 to I-95 to Interstate standards, as well as extending I-87 via upgrades to US 64, will connect I-587 with its parent route.
* I-335 in Oklahoma will not have a connection with its parent route, I-35, until an extension of the road to Purcell is built.
*At the present, I-369 in Texas does not connect to its parent route, I-69. I-369 is proposed to extend south via US 59 to Tenaha, where it will intersect with I-69 after its own extension via US 59 from Cleveland, then via US 84 from Tenaha to the Louisiana state line near Joaquin.
* Numerous three-digit Interstate routes are unsigned on some portions, leading some to think there are connection gaps. These so-called connection gaps do not have internal unsigned concurrencies on other Interstate highway segments between the &quot;parent route&quot; and signed terminus.

<text>USS &quot;Murray&quot; (DD-97) was a built for the United States Navy during World War I.

==Description==
The &quot;Wickes&quot; class was an improved and faster version of the preceding . Two different designs were prepared to the same specification that mainly differed in the turbines and boilers used. The ships built to the Bethlehem Steel design, built in the Fore River and Union Iron Works shipyards, mostly used Yarrow boilers that deteriorated badly during service and were mostly scrapped during the 1930s. The ships displaced at standard load and at deep load. They had an overall length of , a beam of and a draught of . They had a crew of 6 officers and 108 enlisted men.

Performance differed radically between the ships of the class, often due to poor workmanship. The &quot;Wickes&quot; class was powered by two steam turbines, each driving one propeller shaft, using steam provided by four water-tube boilers. The turbines were designed to produce a total of intended to reach a speed of . The ships carried of fuel oil which was intended gave them a range of at .

The ships were armed with four 4-inch (102 mm) guns in single mounts and were fitted with two 1-pounder guns for anti-aircraft defense. Their primary weapon, though, was their torpedo battery of a dozen 21 inch (533 mm) torpedo tubes in four triple mounts. In many ships a shortage of 1-pounders caused them to be replaced by 3-inch (76 mm) anti-aircraft (AA) guns. They also carried a pair of depth charge rails. A &quot;Y-gun&quot; depth charge thrower was added to many ships.

==Construction and career==
&quot;Murray&quot;, named for Commodore Alexander Murray and Commodore Murray&#x27;s grandson, Alexander Murray, was laid down 22 December 1917 by Fore River Shipbuilding Corporation, Quincy, Massachusetts; launched 8 June 1918; sponsored by Miss Alice S. Guthrie; and commissioned at Boston 21 August 1918.

During her four years of operations along the East Coast and in the Caribbean with the Atlantic Fleet, &quot;Murray&quot; aided in postwar development of antisubmarine and mine warfare techniques. She was reclassified to a light minelayer (DM-2) 17 July 1920, and received alterations necessary to her new role. She decommissioned at Philadelphia 1 July 1922, and lay there in reserve until stricken from the Navy list on 7 January 1936. She was sold for scrapping 29 September 1936 to Schiavone-Bonomo Corporation, New York City.

<doc id="843671" wikidata="Q1638450" url="?curid=843671" title="Hurlburt Field">
<text>Hurlburt Field is a United States Air Force installation located in Okaloosa County, Florida, immediately west of the town of Mary Esther. It is part of the greater Eglin Air Force Base reservation and is home to Headquarters Air Force Special Operations Command (AFSOC), the 1st Special Operations Wing (1 SOW), the USAF Special Operations School (USAFSOS) and the Air Combat Command&#x27;s (ACC) 505th Command and Control Wing. It was named for First Lieutenant Donald Wilson Hurlburt, who died in a crash at Eglin. The installation is nearly and employs nearly 8,000 military personnel.

This facility is assigned a three-letter location identifier of HRT by the Federal Aviation Administration, but it does not have an International Air Transport Association (IATA) airport code (the IATA assigned HRT to RAF Linton-on-Ouse in England).

==History==
Hurlburt began as a small training field for the much larger Eglin Field. It was initially designated Eglin Auxiliary Field No. 9, and later as Eglin Air Force Base Auxiliary Field 9/Hurlburt Field when the U.S. Air Force became an independent service, before being administratively separated from the rest of the Eglin AFB complex in the 1950s. However, once separated, the facility retained its history and kept all building numbers the same; i.e., all start with a &quot;9&quot;. The installation was named by then-Eglin Field base commander Brigadier General Grandison Gardner for First Lieutenant Donald Wilson Hurlburt (1919–1943), who was killed in an aircraft crash at the main base, then known as Eglin Field, in 1943.

The facility had previously been named the Eglin-Hurlburt Airdrome until 1943; Hurlburt Field, March 1944; Eglin Auxiliary Field No. 9, October 1944; with the current name official on January 13, 1948. The base commander of Eglin Main was also responsible for Hurlburt, 1942–1946, but when the base reactivated on February 1, 1955, it gained a separate commander.

===Donald Wilson Hurlburt===
After flying combat missions from Great Britain in B-17s and receiving the Distinguished Flying Cross (DFC), Lieutenant Hurlburt was assigned in mid-1943 to the First Proving Ground Electronics Test Unit at Eglin Field. He died on October 1, 1943, when his Lockheed AT-18 Hudson gunnery trainer, &quot;42-55591&quot;, crashed during take-off at Eglin. An official history of Eglin AFB&#x27;s early years cites October 2, 1943, as the date for this accident, and also notes that Capt. Barclay H. Dillon, test pilot of the Fighter Section of the 1st Proving Ground Group, died in another accident the same date. Auxiliary Field No. 10 was later named Eglin Dillon Airdrome, now known primarily as Naval Outlying Landing Field Choctaw, a Navy auxiliary field to Naval Air Station Pensacola and NAS Whiting Field. Hurlburt&#x27;s nephew was Captain Craig D. Button, USAF, noted for his mysterious flight and crash of an A-10 Thunderbolt on April 2, 1997.

===Doolittle Raiders===
Lieutenant Colonel Jimmy Doolittle and his Raiders could not have practiced take offs with their B-25 Mitchell bombers at Auxiliary Field No. 9, as it, and the requisite hard-surfaced runway, did not exist in March 1942. &quot;A former Hurlburt Field base commander in the 1950s may have started this story, and several official histories and raider interviews have perpetuated this belief.&quot; Nonetheless, the short cross-field former runway, near the southern end of Hurlburt Field&#x27;s main runway, is now named the Doolittle Taxiway. Other Eglin fields, including Wagner Field/Eglin Auxiliary Field No. 1, and Duke Field/Eglin Auxiliary Field No. 3, were used during this training.

For the 2008 gathering of Doolittle mission survivors, six crew were present for recognition in Fort Walton Beach, Florida, culminating in a reenactment of the training sessions by three civilian-owned B-25 Mitchells at Duke Field on 31 May. Navy personnel from NAS Pensacola, as flight deck &quot;shirt&quot; crew, represented that service&#x27;s contribution to the Tokyo mission.

===Drones and missiles===
Gulf-facing launch sites for drones beginning with Republic-Ford JB-2 Loons, American copies of the V-1 &quot;buzz bombs&quot;, were operated on Santa Rosa Island, from Site A-15, directly south of Field 9 from the fall of 1944 in anticipation of Operation Olympic against Japan from captured Pacific island bases. The atomic missions put paid to this operation. This launch site is now on the National Register of Historic Places.

The 4751st Air Defense Wing (Missile) was organized at Hurlburt on October 1, 1957. It was redesignated the 4751st Air Defense Missile Wing on January 15, 1958 and discontinued on July 1, 1962 when Tactical Air Command took over the field. Its subordinate 4751st Air Defense Missile Squadron continued operations as a tenant until November 30, 1979. It operated IM-99/CIM-10 Bomarc surface-to-air missiles from this site. On August 18, 1960, a Bomarc missile from the Santa Rosa launch facility made a direct hit on its target, a QB-47E drone of the 3205th Drone Group, marking the first shoot-down of a multi-jet medium bomber by a surface-to-air missile.

The 6555th Guided Missile Wing operated CGM-13/TGM-13 Mace cruise missiles from the island. On January 5, 1967 an international incident was narrowly avoided when a TGM-13 Mace, launched from Santa Rosa Island, which was supposed to circle over the Gulf on a racetrack course for shoot-down by a pair of Eglin F-4 Phantoms, instead, headed south for Cuba. A third F-4 overtook the drone, firing two test AAMs with no effect, and damaged it with cannon fire, but the unarmed Mace actually overflew the western tip of Cuba before crashing in open water some further south. The final Mace launches from Hurlburt Site A-15 took place in June 1974. Other launches in the 1960s included six high-altitude releases of vaporized barium from 2-stage Nike Iroquois sounding rockets in January 1967 to measure wind speeds and directions in the upper atmosphere, conducted under the auspices of the Air Force Cambridge Research Laboratories in conjunction with the Space Systems Branch of the Aircraft and Missile Test Division, Air Proving Ground Center, Eglin AFB.

===Tactical bombardment===
Hurlburt Field fell into disrepair following World War II but was reactivated in 1955. The 17th Bombardment Wing was reactivated on April 1, 1955 and assigned to the Ninth Air Force, with the 34th, 37th, and 95th Bomb Squadrons assigned under the 17th Bomb Group. &quot;Officers and airmen of the 17th crossed the Pacific in three echelons. Some flew their B-26&#x27;s from Miho Air Base, Japan, to Florida. The main body made the trip on the troop ship &quot;General Gaffney&quot;, while another group, comprising airmen from other Fifth Air Force units, arrived in San Francisco in early April 1955, aboard the pocket aircraft carrier, the &quot;Cape Esperance.&quot;

The 17th Bomb Wing was stationed at Eglin AFB, Florida, operating from Hurlburt Field, where it was programmed to receive the Martin B-57 Canberra, the replacement for the B-26 Invader. However, the B-57 proved to be troublesome and unreliable and only three or four were ever delivered to Hurlburt. On October 1, 1955, Hurlburt was redesignated the 17th Bombardment Wing, Tactical, and received B-66 aircraft in early 1956.

The first jet aircraft to land at Hurlburt was a Lockheed T-33 Shooting Star which arrived from Ninth Air Force Headquarters, Shaw AFB, South Carolina, on July 28, 1955, piloted by Maj. J. H. Murrow and Maj. L. F. Collins. &quot;Pilots of the 17th Bomb Wing will in the near future be flying T-33&#x27;s for instrument and transitional training to prepare for the new B-66 bomber which is slated for delivery to the wing...&quot; The first B-66 arrived at Hurlburt on March 16, 1956, after a flight from Norton AFB, California, piloted by 17th Bomb Wing commander Col. Howard F. Bronson, with Col. Norton W. Sanders, commanding officer of the 17th Bomb Group, as observer.

The 17th Bomb Wing was equipped with the Douglas B-66B Destroyer and operated the jet light bomber at Hurlburt from 1956 until 1958, then the wing was moved to a base in England. The 17th was inactivated on June 25, 1958 due to budgetary cutbacks.

With the reactivation of Hurlburt, housing was at a premium, and Lieutenant Colonel Robert S. Kramer, Assistant Army District Engineer at Mobile, Alabama, announced on April 5, 1956, that a contract had been awarded in the amount of $3,315,143.34 to the McDonough Construction Company of Georgia, Atlanta, Georgia, for the construction of 151 buildings of concrete block with brick facing. Residences would be single and duplex quarters with two, three, and four bedrooms. Construction began on the first 48 buildings (72 units) in mid-April, with initial completion expected by February 1957.

===Special operations===
On April 14, 1961 the Air Force Tactical Air Command (TAC) activated the 4400th Combat Crew Training Squadron at Hurlburt, to fly operations against guerrillas, either as an overt Air Force operation or in an undefined covert capacity. Known by its nickname &quot;Jungle Jim&quot;, the unit was commanded by Colonel Benjamin H. King. The squadron was authorized 16 C-47s, eight B-26s and eight T-28 Trojans, plus the same number of aircraft in temporary storage. The T-28s were armed with caliber .50 machine guns, 2.75-in. rockets and a small quantity of bombs. These specialists flew missions in Africa, Southeast Asia, Central America and other places throughout the world. In early 1962, plans for the never executed Operation Northwoods called for decoy aircraft to land at this base.

From the 1960s into the early 1970s, the base hosted a wide variety of aircraft types, including A-1E Skyraiders, AC-119G Shadow and AC-119K Stinger gunships, AC-47 Spooky gunships, AC-130A Spectre gunships, B-26K Counter-Invaders (including those deployed to the Congo), UC-123Ks with underwing jet pods, OV-10A Forward Air Control Broncos, Cessna O-2A Skymaster FAC and O-2B PSYOPS aircraft, QU-22B recon drones, and other long-serving C-47s in various support roles. Following the conclusion of the war in Southeast Asia, most reciprocating engine types were retired by the USAF. UH-1s and CH-3s were operated, the latter by the 20th Special Operations Squadron.

The 4410th Combat Crew Training Wing was activated at Hurlburt Field on December 1, 1965, later moving to England AFB, Louisiana, in July 1969. &quot;In early 1967 the wing comprised four squadrons; two were at Hurlburt, the 4408th CCTS training C-123 crews and the 4409th training A-1E and T-28 pilots, including Vietnamese students. The 4410th CCTS at Holley Field primarily trained O-1 Forward Air Controllers and students flying the U-10 and O-2. In December the 4407th CCTS would be activated to assume the mission of the 4410th while that unit began training crews in the new OV-10 Bronco FAC aircraft. The fourth squadron, the 4412th CCTS was at England AFB, training C-47D and AC-47D pilots. On 1 April the 4532nd CCTS was activated to fly A-37Bs and assigned to the Wing. Later in the year both the 4412th and 4532nd were reassigned to the 1st ACW at England AFB.&quot;

The first jet-augmented Fairchild C-123K Provider arrived at Hurlburt Field on January 5, 1968, and the first of 76 of the type to be ferried to Vietnam by the 319th Air Commando Squadron departed on April 10.

The 20th Special Operations Squadron reactivated in 1976 at Hurlburt Field, the unit mission remaining unconventional warfare and special operations using UH-1N gunships and CH-3Es. The HH-53H Pave Low replaced the CH-3E in 1980, providing a long range, heavier lift helicopter capability. &quot;The Air Force&#x27;s newly operational fleet of nine HH-53H Pave Low CSAR helicopters was abruptly transferred to the special operations forces in response to the failed Iranian hostage rescue attempt and the lack of dedicated long-range vertical lift platforms.&quot; &quot;The helicopters brought 200 new military jobs to Hurlburt, bringing the number of military positions at the base to 3,200.&quot;

In the early 1960s, Hurlburt was utilized as a Strategic Air Command dispersal base for B-47s of the 306th Bomb Wing at MacDill AFB, Florida.

Most facilities were located west of the runway, including hangars, through the 1980s. With the growth and importance of special operation capabilities, Lockheed AC-130 Spectre/Spooky gunship and MC-130 Combat Talon/Combat Spear operations have remained on the western flight line, while additional hangars and ramps have been constructed northeast of the intersection of the main runway and the Doolittle runway. These newer facilities are home to CV-22 Osprey operations of the 413th Flight Test Squadron of the 96th Test Wing, and the recently retired MH-53J Pave Low III and MH-53M Pave Low IV helicopter. The Air Force Special Operations Command continues to fly sensitive operations missions from Hurlburt Field worldwide.

The USAF Special Operations School (USAFSOS) trains US Air Force, Army, Navy, Marine Corps, Coast Guard and US government civilian personnel in a variety of courses, including courses in Dynamics of International Terrorism, and the Middle East Orientation Course.

The Joint Special Operations University (JSOU) was previously located at Hurlburt Field until its relocation to MacDill AFB in 2011. JSOU&#x27;s lecturers include specialists from all branches of the US military, the US Department of State, Central Intelligence Agency, civilian universities, and nongovernmental organizations.

The Florida Air National Guard activated the 249th Special Operations Squadron at Hurlburt Field on 28 August 2020. The squadron, part of the 125th Fighter Wing, operates the CV-22B Osprey and is assigned to Air Force Special Operations Command.

==Facilities==
Hurlburt Field has a runway designated 18/36 and a helipad, both with concrete surfaces.

Base housing is located across from the main base divided by U.S. 98 along the beachfront of Santa Rosa Sound.

The Reef is the main dining facility on base and has won the title of best dining facility in the Air Force nine times.

A grade-separated intersection at the main gate with a fly-over on U.S. 98 was completed in the summer of 2015, greatly relieving a long-time traffic bottleneck.

==Airpark==
Starting in 1970s there was an effort to preserve the history of Air Commando operations and the Airmen involved. As part of this effort aircraft of significance were collected and memorials erected to significant operations and individuals dating back to World War II. The air park was open to the general public via special pass until the enhanced security of the post 9/11 era was enacted resulting in the park currently being inaccessible to the general public.

==Based units==
Flying and notable non-flying units based at Hurlburt Field.

Units marked GSU are Geographically Separate Units, which although based at Hurlburt, are subordinate to a parent unit based at another location.
