<doc id="822726" wikidata="Q21156277" url="?curid=822726" title="Silent treatment">
<text>Silent treatment is the refusal to communicate verbally or electronically with someone who is trying to communicate and elicit a response. It may range from just sulking to malevolent abusive controlling behaviour. It may be a passive-aggressive form of emotional abuse in which displeasure, disapproval and contempt is exhibited through nonverbal gestures while maintaining verbal silence. Clinical psychologist Harriet Braiker identifies it as a form of manipulative punishment. It may be used as a form of social rejection; according to the social psychologist Kipling Williams, it is the most common form of ostracism.

== Origin of term ==
The term originated from &quot;treatment&quot; through silence, which was fashionable in prisons in the 19th century. In use since the prison reforms of 1835, the silent treatment was used in prisons as an alternative to physical punishment, as it was believed that forbidding prisoners from speaking, calling them by a number rather than their name, and making them cover their faces so they couldn&#x27;t see each other would encourage reflection on their crimes.

== In interpersonal relationships ==
In a relationship, the silent treatment can be a difficult pattern to break and resolve because if it is ingrained, relationships may gradually deteriorate. The silent treatment is more likely to be used by individuals with low self-esteem and a low tolerance for conflict. In order to avoid conflict, an individual will refuse to acknowledge it and will sometimes use silent treatment as a control mechanism. Enactors of the silent treatment punish their victims by refusing to speak to them or even acknowledge their presence. Through silence, the enactors &quot;loudly&quot; communicate their displeasure, anger, upset and frustration. These feelings can elicit a maladaptive response from victims with high rejection sensitivity levels, which can often lead to violence and more physical displays of aggression.

Purposeful silence is a form of attention seeking behavior and can generate desired responses, such as attention, or a feeling of power from creating uncertainty for the victim. Unfortunately, the avoidance of conflict in the form of silent treatment is psychologically exhausting for all involved parties and leads to the irreparable deterioration of meaningful romantic and familial relationships.

== Tactical ignoring ==

Silence and non-responsiveness are not only passive-aggressive forms of manipulation and attention seeking; they can also be used as tools to promote changes in behavior. Tactical ignoring is a strategy where a person gives no outward sign of recognizing a behavior, such as no eye contact, no verbal or physical response, or acknowledgment that a message has been read. However, it is a very active process as the person remains acutely aware of the behavior and monitors the individual to observe what the individual has planned and ensure their safety or the safety of others. It is a technique that is often employed in parent-child relationships and is similar to the silent treatment because tactical ignoring is a behavioral management technique that, when correctly applied, can convey the message that a person&#x27;s behavior will not lead to their desired outcome. It may also result in the reduction of undesirable behaviors.

Tactical ignoring can be one element of a behavior management plan when there are a variety of challenging behaviors being addressed. Because it is a method that involves not responding to an undesirable behavior, it should be complemented by differential reinforcement for an alternative behavior, as seen in functional communication training, a procedure to teach a more appropriate attention-seeking behavior. Planned ignoring can be used for mild and low impact in terms of helping behavioral issues stemming from attention seeking and power struggles. Power struggles are when a child refuses to do something and it is an ongoing battle of insisting the child to comply.

<text>The Oregon Vortex is a roadside attraction that opened to tourists in 1930, located on Sardine Creek in Gold Hill, Oregon, in the United States. It consists of a number of interesting effects, which are gravity hill optical illusions, but which the attraction&#x27;s proprietors propose are the result of paranormal properties of the area.

== Background ==
Local legend supposedly states that prior to any construction in the area, Native Americans in the area referred to the site as a &quot;forbidden&quot; land, and travelers passing through would often find their horses refusing to go through the area.

The story goes that a gold assay office was built in the area in 1904 by the Old Grey Eagle Mining Company, which slid from its foundation in the early tens, coming to rest at an odd angle. However the building conforms to other purpose-built distorting rooms or &quot;crazy houses&quot; such as at the Santa Cruz Mystery Spot. In 1914, the outpost and assay house were rediscovered by a prospector named William McCollugh. McCollugh convinced his friend, geologist and engineer John Litster to come to the US from his birth place in Alva, Scotland. Litster says he researched the paranormal phenomena of the so-called 165-foot magnet radius.

When the very similar Mystery Spot was created in Santa Cruz, California in 1939, Litster sued for copyright violations, but withdrew the suit when it was pointed out that he claimed the Oregon Vortex was a natural phenomenon.

When Litster died in 1959, his wife sold the Oregon Vortex to Ernie and Irene Cooper. The Coopers&#x27; daughter Maria and grandson Mark kept the attraction open since then, making it one of Oregon&#x27;s oldest examples of roadside americana.

Odd angles create an illusion of objects seemingly rolling uphill. The same effect can be seen in The Montana Vortex and house of mystery, Pennsylvania&#x27;s Laurel Caverns, North Carolina’s Mystery Hill, and at Santa Cruz, California&#x27;s Mystery Spot. Two UC Berkeley researchers studied the Santa Cruz Mystery Spot and published their conclusions in Psychological Science in 1999. They proposed a framework called &quot;orientation framing&quot; which describes how the brain&#x27;s visual processing uses spatial frames of reference. They noted similar illusions including the Ponzo illusion, the Zöllner illusion, the Poggendorf and Wündt-Hering illusions. James Randi, magician and illusionist, also described the Oregon Vortex (House of Mystery) as an optical illusion in 1998 using photography and mathematics to describe the illusion. Russ Donnelly, professor emeritus of physics at the University of Oregon visited the Oregon Vortex in 1966 and was convinced it was some sort of optical illusion. Owner Maria Cooper agreed with Donnelly that what people are seeing inside the House of Mystery is an optical illusion but insisted something else was happening outside the house that makes people&#x27;s height appear to grow and shrink depending on their location. 

Oregon Vortex is also famous for &quot;height change&quot; as the apparent relative height of two people varies, depending on where each stands. The explanation of the strange phenomena is that they are caused by optical illusions. Distorted backgrounds that induce a forced perspective, as with an Ames room. The Oregon site also exhibits phenomena similar to those perceived by visitors at the mystery spot located outside St. Ignace in the upper peninsula of Michigan.

== In popular culture ==
* The site was investigated on a second season episode of the SyFy reality show &quot;Fact or Faked: Paranormal Files&quot;, and although there seemed to be a small debate between the show&#x27;s investigators over the &quot;height change&quot; phenomenon, they ultimately concluded that overall, all of the effects demonstrated were optical illusions.
* The Oregon Vortex was featured in a 1999 episode of X-Files.
* The attraction is the inspiration for the Mystery Shack, a tourist trap and the main setting for the Disney Channel (later Disney XD) original series &quot;Gravity Falls&quot;.
* Mentioned in Season 3 Episode 11 of Supernatural in relation to the mystery spot being investigated and alongside The Bermuda Triangle
* Visited in Season 15 Episode 1 of &quot;Ghost Adventures&quot; &quot;Golden Ghost Town&quot; prior to the overnight investigation in Golden. Whilst there, Zak and Aaron witness a broom being perfectly balanced by the tip of its brush.
* Mentioned in Stranger Than Science by Frank Edwards using glass balls as an example.

<doc id="822749" wikidata="Q1935130" url="?curid=822749" title="So Long and Thanks for All the Shoes">
<text>So Long and Thanks for All the Shoes is the seventh studio album by the American punk rock band NOFX. It was released through Epitaph Records October 21, 1997, in the United States, and November 4, 1997, in Europe.

==Overview==
The title is inspired by the fourth book of Douglas Adams&#x27;s &quot;The Hitchhiker&#x27;s Guide to the Galaxy&quot; series, &quot;So Long, and Thanks for All the Fish&quot;, and refers to the frequent occurrence of fans throwing footwear at the band during their live shows.

The album was recorded at San Francisco&#x27;s Motor Studios in August 1997 and was produced by Fat Mike and regular Fat Wreck Chords producer Ryan Greene. The liner notes for the album claim it is &#x27;arguably their third best album&#x27; (up to that point) although Fat Mike has referred to it as his favourite one on several occasions. Also therein the standard practice of including a photograph of each band member has been mocked, with members of other punk bands standing in for the four NOFX members:

* Fat Mike is replaced by Serge Verkhovsky, bassist in Limp,
* El Hefe is replaced by Otis Bartholomeu, vocalist and guitarist in fluf,
* Eric Melvin (listed as just &quot;Melvin&quot;) is replaced by &#x27;Little John&#x27;, roadie for Swingin&#x27; Utters,
* Erik Sandin (listed as &quot;Smelly&quot;) is replaced by Chuck Platt, bassist in Good Riddance.

Track 9, &quot;Champs Elysées&quot;, is a cover version of the track &quot;Les Champs-Élysées&quot; by Joe Dassin.

The song &quot;Kill Rock Stars&quot; is written about musician Kathleen Hanna, referencing her by name: &quot;Kill the rockstars? How ironic, Kathleen. You&#x27;ve been crowned the newest queen.&quot; The song&#x27;s title is a reference to riot grrrl record label Kill Rock Stars. In response Hanna wrote &quot;Deceptacon&quot;, included on Le Tigre&#x27;s first album, which referred to the NOFX song &quot;Linoleum&quot;: &quot;Your lyrics are dumb like a linoleum floor, I&#x27;ll walk on it, I&#x27;ll walk all over you&quot;.

The final track, &quot;Falling in Love&quot;, is reportedly a love song about a friend of Fat Mike and his friend&#x27;s wife together in a plane in rapid descent, destined to crash. The track has a &#x27;hidden ending&#x27; that starts at timecode 4:15. It is a recording of a segment from Howard Stern&#x27;s radio show in which the host&#x27;s DJ begins to play the track &quot;Drugs Are Good&quot;, from the band&#x27;s &quot;HOFX&quot; EP. Stern clearly dislikes the track and stops it after 36 seconds, effectively labelling it as disco before going on to rename the band &#x27;No Talent&#x27;.
The first pressing of the cd contains an extended bonus track: 8 min instrumental immediately after this radio show segment, that ends with a 10-second song &quot;Congratulations, you made it through the song, I bet you never thought anyone could play something so wrong&quot;.

On the CD it bears the Warning &quot;Unlawful Duplication May be Hazardous to your Health!&quot;. This warning might be a parody of Bad Religion albums because some Bad Religion albums (e.g., &quot;Suffer&quot;, &quot;No Control&quot;) carry this warning.

<text>Holloway Road is a station on the London Underground. It is on the Piccadilly line between Caledonian Road and Arsenal stations, and is in Travelcard Zone 2. The station opened on 15 December 1906.

The station was constructed by the Great Northern, Piccadilly and Brompton Railway and was built with two lift shafts, but only one was ever used for lifts. The second shaft was the site of an experimental spiral escalator which was built by the American inventor of escalators, Jesse W. Reno. The experiment was not successful and was never used by the public. In the 1990s, remains of the escalator equipment were excavated from the base of the lift shaft and stored at the London Transport Museum Depot in Acton. From the platforms, a second exit no longer in use is visible and leads to the back of the used lift shaft.

The station is adjacent to the site of the former Holloway and Caledonian Road railway station.

The station is close to the Emirates Stadium, the home of Arsenal football club. As part of the planning permission £5m was due to be spent expanding the current station to cope with increased passenger numbers on match days. However subsequent studies showed that to ensure the station could cope with the numbers the lifts would have to be replaced with escalators which would cost £60m. As a result, the redevelopment plans were put on hold and now at match times the station is exit only, and before a match eastbound trains do not call.

==Design==
The architect of the station was Leslie Green who built it for the Great Northern, Piccadilly and Brompton Railway (Now part of London Transport) in the Modern Style (British Art Nouveau style). The building is listed by English Heritage as Grade II.

==Refurbishment, 2007–2008==
Refurbishment works completed in 2008 included the installation of a new public address system, replacement of aging customer information screens, and other aesthetic changes to improve the look, feel and security of the station. This includes improved lighting and a dramatic increase in the number of CCTV cameras.

==Lift replacement 2023–24==

In May 2023, works to replace the two 1980s lifts started with the work due to take until September 2024,
replacing one lift at a time. During Emirates Stadium events the station was closed to prevent overcrowding.

==Connections==
London Buses routes 21, 43, 153, 263, 393 and night routes N41 and N271 serve the station.

<doc id="822778" wikidata="Q811478" url="?curid=822778" title="Baum–Welch algorithm">
<text>In electrical engineering, statistical computing and bioinformatics, the Baum–Welch algorithm is a special case of the expectation–maximization algorithm used to find the unknown parameters of a hidden Markov model (HMM). It makes use of the forward-backward algorithm to compute the statistics for the expectation step. The Baum–Welch algorithm, the primary method for inference in hidden Markov models, is numerically unstable due to its recursive calculation of joint probabilities. As the number of variables grows, these joint probabilities become increasingly small, leading to the forward recursions rapidly approaching values below machine precision.

==History==
The Baum–Welch algorithm was named after its inventors Leonard E. Baum and Lloyd R. Welch. The algorithm and the Hidden Markov models were first described in a series of articles by Baum and his peers at the IDA Center for Communications Research, Princeton in the late 1960s and early 1970s. One of the first major applications of HMMs was to the field of speech processing. In the 1980s, HMMs were emerging as a useful tool in the analysis of biological systems and information, and in particular genetic information. They have since become an important tool in the probabilistic modeling of genomic sequences.

==Description==
A hidden Markov model describes the joint probability of a collection of &quot;hidden&quot; and observed discrete random variables. It relies on the assumption that the &quot;i&quot;-th hidden variable given the (&quot;i&quot; − 1)-th hidden variable is independent of previous hidden variables, and the current observation variables depend only on the current hidden state.

The Baum–Welch algorithm uses the well known EM algorithm to find the maximum likelihood estimate of the parameters of a hidden Markov model given a set of observed feature vectors.

Let formula_1 be a discrete hidden random variable with formula_2 possible values (i.e. We assume there are formula_2 states in total). We assume the formula_4 is independent of time formula_5, which leads to the definition of the time-independent stochastic transition matrix
:formula_6
The initial state distribution (i.e. when formula_7) is given by
:formula_8
The observation variables formula_9 can take one of formula_10 possible values. We also assume the observation given the &quot;hidden&quot; state is time independent. The probability of a certain observation formula_11 at time formula_5 for state formula_13 is given by
:formula_14
Taking into account all the possible values of formula_9 and formula_1, we obtain the formula_17 matrix formula_18 where formula_19 belongs to all the possible states and formula_11 belongs to all the observations.

An observation sequence is given by formula_21.

Thus we can describe a hidden Markov chain by formula_22. The Baum–Welch algorithm finds a local maximum for formula_23 (i.e. the HMM parameters formula_24 that maximize the probability of the observation).

===Algorithm===
Set formula_25 with random initial conditions. They can also be set using prior information about the parameters if it is available; this can speed up the algorithm and also steer it toward the desired local maximum.

====Forward procedure====
Let formula_26, the probability of seeing the observations formula_27 and being in state formula_28 at time formula_5. This is found recursively:
#formula_30
#formula_31

Since this series converges exponentially to zero, the algorithm will numerically underflow for longer sequences. However, this can be avoided in a slightly modified algorithm by scaling formula_32 in the forward and formula_33 in the backward procedure below.

====Backward procedure====
Let formula_34 that is the probability of the ending partial sequence formula_35 given starting state formula_28 at time formula_5. We calculate formula_38 as,
# formula_39
# formula_40

====Update====
We can now calculate the temporary variables, according to Bayes&#x27; theorem:
:formula_41
which is the probability of being in state formula_28 at time formula_5 given the observed sequence formula_44 and the parameters formula_24
:formula_46
which is the probability of being in state formula_28 and formula_48 at times formula_5 and formula_50 respectively given the observed sequence formula_44 and parameters formula_24.

The denominators of formula_53 and formula_54 are the same ; they represent the probability of making the observation formula_44 given the parameters formula_24.

The parameters of the hidden Markov model formula_24 can now be updated:
*formula_58
which is the expected frequency spent in state formula_28 at time formula_60.
*formula_61
which is the expected number of transitions from state &quot;i&quot; to state &quot;j&quot; compared to the expected total number of transitions away from state &quot;i&quot;. To clarify, the number of transitions away from state &quot;i&quot; does not mean transitions to a different state &quot;j&quot;, but to any state including itself. This is equivalent to the number of times state &quot;i&quot; is observed in the sequence from &quot;t&quot; = 1 to &quot;t&quot; = &quot;T&quot; − 1.
*formula_62
where
:formula_63
is an indicator function, and formula_64 is the expected number of times the output observations have been equal to formula_65 while in state formula_28 over the expected total number of times in state formula_28.

These steps are now repeated iteratively until a desired level of convergence.

Note: It is possible to over-fit a particular data set. That is, formula_68. The algorithm also does not guarantee a global maximum.

====Multiple sequences====

The algorithm described thus far assumes a single observed sequence formula_69. However, in many situations, there are several sequences observed: formula_70. In this case, the information from all of the observed sequences must be used in the update of the parameters formula_71, formula_72, and formula_73. Assuming that you have computed formula_74 and formula_75 for each sequence formula_76, the parameters can now be updated:
*formula_77
*formula_78
*formula_79
where
:formula_80
is an indicator function

==Example==
Suppose we have a chicken from which we collect eggs at noon every day. Now whether or not the chicken has laid eggs for collection depends on some unknown factors that are hidden. We can however (for simplicity) assume that the chicken is always in one of two states that influence whether the chicken lays eggs, and that this state only depends on the state on the previous day. Now we don&#x27;t know the state at the initial starting point, we don&#x27;t know the transition probabilities between the two states and we don&#x27;t know the probability that the chicken lays an egg given a particular state. To start we first guess the transition and emission matrices.
We then take a set of observations (E = eggs, N = no eggs): N, N, N, N, N, E, E, N, N, N

This gives us a set of observed transitions between days: NN, NN, NN, NN, NE, EE, EN, NN, NN

The next step is to estimate a new transition matrix. For example, the probability of the sequence NN and the state being then is given by the following,
formula_81
Thus the new estimate for the to transition is now formula_82 (referred to as &quot;Pseudo probabilities&quot; in the following tables). We then calculate the to , to and to transition probabilities and normalize so they add to 1. This gives us the updated transition matrix:

Next, we want to estimate a new emission matrix,
The new estimate for the E coming from emission is now formula_83.

This allows us to calculate the emission matrix as described above in the algorithm, by adding up the probabilities for the respective observed sequences. We then repeat for if N came from and for if N and E came from and normalize.

To estimate the initial probabilities we assume all sequences start with the hidden state and calculate the highest probability and then repeat for . Again we then normalize to give an updated initial vector.

Finally we repeat these steps until the resulting probabilities converge satisfactorily.

==Applications==

===Speech recognition===
Hidden Markov Models were first applied to speech recognition by James K. Baker in 1975. Continuous speech recognition occurs by the following steps, modeled by a HMM. Feature analysis is first undertaken on temporal and/or spectral features of the speech signal. This produces an observation vector. The feature is then compared to all sequences of the speech recognition units. These units could be phonemes, syllables, or whole-word units. A lexicon decoding system is applied to constrain the paths investigated, so only words in the system&#x27;s lexicon (word dictionary) are investigated. Similar to the lexicon decoding, the system path is further constrained by the rules of grammar and syntax. Finally, semantic analysis is applied and the system outputs the recognized utterance. A limitation of many HMM applications to speech recognition is that the current state only depends on the state at the previous time-step, which is unrealistic for speech as dependencies are often several time-steps in duration. The Baum–Welch algorithm also has extensive applications in solving HMMs used in the field of speech synthesis.

===Cryptanalysis===
The Baum–Welch algorithm is often used to estimate the parameters of HMMs in deciphering hidden or noisy information and consequently is often used in cryptanalysis. In data security an observer would like to extract information from a data stream without knowing all the parameters of the transmission. This can involve reverse engineering a channel encoder. HMMs and as a consequence the Baum–Welch algorithm have also been used to identify spoken phrases in encrypted VoIP calls. In addition HMM cryptanalysis is an important tool for automated investigations of cache-timing data. It allows for the automatic discovery of critical algorithm state, for example key values.

===Applications in bioinformatics===

====Finding genes====

=====Prokaryotic=====
The GLIMMER (Gene Locator and Interpolated Markov ModelER) software was an early gene-finding program used for the identification of coding regions in prokaryotic DNA. GLIMMER uses Interpolated Markov Models (IMMs) to identify the coding regions and distinguish them from the noncoding DNA. The latest release (GLIMMER3) has been shown to have increased specificity and accuracy compared with its predecessors with regard to predicting translation initiation sites, demonstrating an average 99% accuracy in locating 3&#x27; locations compared to confirmed genes in prokaryotes.

=====Eukaryotic=====
The GENSCAN webserver is a gene locator capable of analyzing eukaryotic sequences up to one million base-pairs (1 Mbp) long. GENSCAN utilizes a general inhomogeneous, three periodic, fifth order Markov model of DNA coding regions. Additionally, this model accounts for differences in gene density and structure (such as intron lengths) that occur in different isochores. While most integrated gene-finding software (at the time of GENSCANs release) assumed input sequences contained exactly one gene, GENSCAN solves a general case where partial, complete, or multiple genes (or even no gene at all) is present. GENSCAN was shown to exactly predict exon location with 90% accuracy with 80% specificity compared to an annotated database.

====Copy-number variation detection====
Copy-number variations (CNVs) are an abundant form of genome structure variation in humans. A discrete-valued bivariate HMM (dbHMM) was used assigning chromosomal regions to seven distinct states: unaffected regions, deletions, duplications and four transition states. Solving this model using Baum-Welch demonstrated the ability to predict the location of CNV breakpoint to approximately 300 bp from micro-array experiments. This magnitude of resolution enables more precise correlations between different CNVs and across populations than previously possible, allowing the study of CNV population frequencies. It also demonstrated a direct inheritance pattern for a particular CNV.

==Implementations==
*Accord.NET in C#
*ghmm C library with Python bindings that supports both discrete and continuous emissions.

<doc id="822781" wikidata="Q1663773" url="?curid=822781" title="Park Royal tube station">
<text>Park Royal is a London Underground station. It is on the Uxbridge branch of the Piccadilly line between and stations and is in Travelcard Zone 3. It is situated on the south side of the east–west Western Avenue (A40), surrounded by residential Ealing and industrial Park Royal. There is a pedestrian subway under the A40 road near the station. Hanger Lane station on the Central line is within walking distance from this station.

The station&#x27;s platforms have a continuous significant gradient (sloping up from south to north).

==History==

The District Railway (DR, now the District line) opened the line through Park Royal on its new extension to on 23 June 1903. A station, Park Royal &amp; Twyford Abbey, was opened at that time a short distance to the north of the current station to serve the Royal Agricultural Society&#x27;s recently opened Park Royal show grounds.

The current station was built for the extension of Piccadilly line services over the District line tracks to . It opened on 6 July 1931 and replaced the earlier station which closed on the previous day.

First opened as a temporary timber structure, the current station building was designed by Welch &amp; Lander in an Art Deco/Streamline Moderne style influenced by the Underground&#x27;s principal architect Charles Holden. The station buildings are formed from a series of simple interconnecting geometric shapes. Plain red brick masses are accented with strong horizontal and vertical glazed elements. A large circular ticket hall with high level windows gives access to the platform stairs. The enclosures for these form cascades of glazed steps down to the platforms.

The most prominent feature of the station building is the tall square tower adjacent to the ticket hall. This is adorned with the Underground roundel; and represents a visible locator for the station from some distance. The permanent structure was opened in 1936. Attached to the station building and across the small open space of Hanger Green are two curved three-storey retail and office buildings built in the same style as the station.

On 4 July 1932, the Piccadilly line was extended to run west of its original terminus at sharing the route with the District line to . From Ealing Common to South Harrow, the District line was replaced by the Piccadilly line.

From 1 March 1936 until 1947 the station name was modified to Park Royal (Hanger Hill). The suffix was then dropped and the station returned to the unmodified version. &quot;Hanger Hill&quot; referred to a residential estate adjacent to the station.

In August 2022 a woman died when the Range Rover she was travelling in crashed through a barrier, hit another vehicle and ended up on Piccadilly line tracks at Park Royal Tube station. The driver and another female passenger were injured also taken to hospital. The driver Rida Kazem admitted causing death by dangerous driving and was jailed. 

==Possible development==
The Mayor&#x27;s plans for the area include improvements to the station access. In 2018, it was announced that the station would gain step free access by 2022, as part of a £200m investment to increase the number of accessible stations on the Tube.

The developers of the &quot;First Central&quot; business park at Park Royal were planning a new station between North Acton and Hanger Lane on the Central line. This would have served the business park and provide a walking distance interchange with Park Royal station. This is not being actively pursued. London Underground has said that the transport benefits of a Park Royal station on the Central line are not sufficiently high to justify the costs of construction.

==Services==
The off-peak service in trains per hour (tph) is:
*6tph to Cockfosters (Eastbound)
*3tph to Rayners Lane (Westbound)
*3tph to Uxbridge via Rayners Lane (Westbound)

The peak time service in trains per hour (tph) is:
*12tph to Cockfosters (Eastbound)
*6tph to Rayners Lane (Westbound)
*6tph to Uxbridge via Rayners Lane (Westbound)

<text>Stephanie Keene (October 13, 1992 – April 5, 1995), better known by the pseudonym Baby K, was an anencephalic baby who became the center of a major American court case and a debate among bioethicists.

==History==

===Prenatal assessment===
Stephanie Keene was born at Fairfax Hospital in Falls Church, Virginia, a hospital in the Washington metropolitan area. At the time of her birth, she was missing most of her brain, including the cortex; only the brainstem, the portion of the brain responsible for autonomic and regulatory functions, such as the control of respiration, the heartbeat and blood pressure, had developed.

===Opposing viewpoints===
Keene&#x27;s mother had been notified of her condition following ultrasonography, and was advised to terminate the pregnancy by her obstetrician and neonatologist but chose to carry the child to term because of &quot;a firm Christian faith that all life should be protected&quot;. The hospital believed that care provided to the baby would be futile, while the mother believed mechanical breathing support must be provided during the baby&#x27;s periodic respiratory crises. Fairfax Hospital doctors strongly advised a &quot;do not resuscitate&quot; order for the child, which the mother refused. Stephanie remained on ventilator support for six weeks while Fairfax searched for another hospital to transfer her to, but no other hospital would accept her. After the baby was weaned off constant ventilator support, the mother agreed to move the child to a nursing facility, but the baby returned to the hospital many times for respiratory problems.

===Legal proceedings===
When baby Keene was admitted to the hospital at six months of age for severe respiratory problems, the hospital filed a legal motion to appoint a guardian for the child&#x27;s care and sought a court order that the hospital did not need to provide any services beyond palliative care. At trial, several experts testified that providing ventilator support to an anencephalic infant went beyond the accepted standard of medical care. In contrast, the baby&#x27;s mother argued her case on the grounds of religious freedom and the sanctity of life. In a controversial ruling, the United States District Court for the Eastern District of Virginia decided that the hospital caring for Keene must put her on a mechanical ventilator whenever she had trouble breathing. The court interpreted the Emergency Medical Treatment and Active Labor Act (EMTALA) to require continued ventilation for the infant. The wording of this act requires that patients who present with a medical emergency must get &quot;such treatment as may be required to stabilize the medical condition&quot; before the patient is transferred to another facility. The court refused to take a moral or ethical position on the issue, insisting that it was only interpreting the laws as they existed. As a result of the decision, Keene was kept on the ventilator much longer than most anencephalic babies. It has been suggested by the dissenting judge in the case that the court should have used the condition anencephaly as the basis of the case, not the recurring subsidiary symptoms of respiratory distress. As the irreversibility of anencephaly is widely understood in the medical community, he argued that the decision to continue futile care only resulted in the repetitive diversion of medical equipment.

Keene&#x27;s cardiac death occurred on April 5, 1995, at Fairfax Hospital, at age of 2 years 174 days.

==Significance==
The case of Baby K is of particular importance to the field of bioethics because of the issues it raises: the definition of death, the nature of personhood, the concept of futile medical care, and many issues relating to the allocation of scarce resources. Some commentators, including Arthur Kohrman and Jacob Appel, have argued that the ruling effectively undermined the right of physicians to make sound medical decisions.

<doc id="822790" wikidata="Q2635878" url="?curid=822790" title="Les amitiés particulières">
<text> is a 1943 novel by French writer Roger Peyrefitte, probably his best-known work today, which won the &quot;Prix Renaudot&quot;. Largely autobiographical, it deals with an intimate relationship between two boys at a Roman Catholic boarding school and how it is destroyed by a priest&#x27;s will to protect them from homosexuality.

The book has been translated into English by Felix Giovanelli (1950) and Edward Hyams (1958), both times under the title &quot;Special Friendships&quot;, the latter reissued in the United States as &quot;Secret Friendships&quot;. , they are out of print. In 1964, a film adaptation titled was made, directed by Jean Delannoy.

==Synopsis==
The plot revolves around Georges de Sarre, a 14-year-old boy who is sent to a Catholic boarding school in 1920s France. Getting to know the other boys, he is immediately interested in Lucien Rouvière, of whom he is warned by the unsympathetic Marc de Blajan, who cryptically informs him that some of the students &quot;may seem good, but are in fact not&quot;. Georges is dismayed when he learns that Lucien already has a boyfriend, André Ferron. He befriends Lucien, but filled with envy, tries to destroy their relationship, eventually succeeding in getting André expelled in a Machiavellian scheme.

When his advances toward Lucien remain fruitless, Georges starts a &quot;special friendship&quot;, i.e. a friendship with homosexual overtones, with a 12-year-old student, the beautiful Alexandre (Alexander) Motier. The priests who lead the school disapprove of these relationships, even though it does not go beyond a few kisses and love poems, with no sexual connotation. 

Despite their air of condemnation of these special friendships, some of the priests harbour sexual feelings for the boys. One of them, Father de Trennes, likes to invite boys to join him in his room at night for a few drinks and cigarettes. Georges continues his scheming ways and gets Father de Trennes expelled by an anonymous letter. However, Father Lauzon, who is a friend of Alexandre&#x27;s family and wants to protect him, learns about their relationship and demands that it be ended immediately.

Lauzon talks Georges into giving back the love letters from Alexandre, which at the time the novel is set meant that a relationship was over. In the film version, this is straightforward: Georges is forced to return the letters, but Alexandre cannot see this, thinks that Georges had abandoned him, and commits suicide. The account in the novel is more complicated: Georges is aware that he could deceive the priest by handing over only a few of the letters and that Alexandre would then know that he was not ending their affair, but nevertheless he decides to return them all in order to subject the boy to a &quot;test&quot; and a &quot;passing crisis&quot;, and thereby lead him to abandon his wild plans of running away from home in order for the two of them to decamp together (p. 397 of the 1946 edition). What is clear is that Georges is not single-minded in his attachment to their affair in the way that Alexandre is. The shock of the boy&#x27;s death, however, works a change of heart, and the novel ends with his attaining the same devotion to love that Alexandre had shown.

The work has been praised for its elegant style, and the discretion with which the subject is treated. One example is the question which Alexander poses to Georges: &quot;Georges, do you know the things one should not know?&quot;

==Relationship to Peyrefitte&#x27;s biography and other similar works==
The plot is understood to be largely autobiographical, with de Sarre being Peyrefitte&#x27;s alter ego in the book. As in the book, Peyrefitte had a relationship with a younger student at a Catholic boarding school, and as in the book, his love interest eventually committed suicide.

The reader can follow George de Sarre&#x27;s later life as a diplomat in Greece in Peyrefitte&#x27;s &quot;Les Ambassades&quot; and &quot;La Fin des ambassades&quot;, where he also meets Father de Trennes again. Again, this parallels Peyrefitte&#x27;s life as a diplomat in the 1930s/1940s.

Peyrefitte was on (mostly) friendly terms with Henry de Montherlant, who in his later years wrote a novel (&quot;Les Garçons&quot;, 1969) about a similar relationship. There exists substantial correspondence between the two on, among other things, love for boys and young men.

<text>Putney Bridge () is a London Underground station on the branch of the District line. It is between and stations and is in Zone 2. The station is located in the south of Fulham, adjacent to Fulham High Street and New Kings Road (A308) and is a short distance from the north end of Putney Bridge from which it takes its name.

==History==
The station was opened on 1 March 1880 as Putney Bridge &amp; Fulham when the District Railway (DR, now the District line) extended its line south from . The station served as the terminus of the line until 1889 when the DR built Fulham Railway Bridge across the River Thames and extended the line south to the London and South Western Railway&#x27;s (L&amp;SWR&#x27;s) newly built East Putney station where it connected to the L&amp;SWR&#x27;s new line to Wimbledon. Services from the station to Wimbledon began on 3 June 1889. The station has an ornate yellow brick façade at the entrance.

On 1 September 1902, the station was renamed Putney Bridge &amp; Hurlingham referring to its proximity to Hurlingham Park and the Hurlingham Club. It received its current name in 1932. Despite taking its name from Putney Bridge, the tube station is in fact on the Fulham side of the Thames and is not actually located in Putney.

==Nearby places of interest==
A World War II pillbox can clearly be seen at the Southern end of the Southbound platform, overlooking Fulham Railway Bridge. The concrete pillbox was built in 1940 as a final line of defense should German troops invade London. It was designed like a fortified look-out post with narrow loopholes (rather like a castle) to protect the inhabitant while allowing them to shoot at intruders.

In addition to the Hurlingham club and Hurlingham Park, the Grade I listed Fulham Palace and its restored garden, the former home of the Bishops of London, in Bishop&#x27;s Park is nearby to the north and contains a small museum. The historic All Saints Church, Fulham and its graveyard are on the riverside route to Fulham Palace.

Fulham Football Club&#x27;s Craven Cottage stadium is about 1 kilometre to the north-west and the tube station is often very busy on matchdays.

==Recent developments==
Putney Bridge had a bay platform (platform 2) which could only accommodate C stock trains and was located between the current eastbound and westbound tracks. After the C stock was removed from service in June 2014, the bay platform ceased to be used, and the track was lifted as of October 2015.

This platform was brought back into use in May 2016. The previous terminating end is now joined to the westbound track and platform 3 is no longer in use and is fenced off. This eliminated the previous 10 mph speed restriction on the westbound side.

==Connections==

London Buses routes 14, 22, 39, 85, 93, 74, 220, 265, 270, 378, 424, 430 and night routes N22, N33, N72 and N74 serve the station.

<doc id="822805" wikidata="Q1757115" url="?curid=822805" title="Royal Oak tube station">
<text>Royal Oak is a London Underground station. It is on the Circle and Hammersmith &amp; City lines, between and Paddington stations. The station is on Lord Hill&#x27;s Bridge and is in Travelcard Zone 2 for the London Underground. Although not heavily used at other times, the station is extremely busy during the annual Notting Hill Carnival. There is no wheelchair access to the platform. It is classed as a &quot;local station&quot; in Transport for London&#x27;s &quot;Fit for the Future&quot; development outline.

The station opened on 30 October 1871, although the Metropolitan Railway extension to Hammersmith had opened in 1864. It is close to the elevated Westway section of the A40 road. The station is named after a nearby public house, &quot;The Royal Oak&quot; (later &quot;The Railway Tap&quot; and now &quot;The Porchester&quot;). There was a small newsagents kiosk next to the ticket office from the 1950s to 1986, when it was closed to make room for ticketing machines needed for the Underground Ticketing System (UTS).

==History==
===The station===
When the Great Western Railway (GWR) main line was first opened in June 1838, the first stop out of Paddington was at , from . Intermediate stations were opened over the years, and the first stop became progressively closer to Paddington: a station at ( from Paddington) was opened in December 1838, and one at ( from Paddington) in 1868. In the meantime, the Hammersmith and City Railway had opened from Green Lane Junction (near the present Westbourne Park) to on 13 June 1864, with the first stop on that route originally at , out, although one opened at Westbourne Park ( out) in 1866.

An agreement between the GWR and the Metropolitan Railway (who had co-owned the Hammersmith &amp; City with the GWR since 1867) came into force on 1 July 1868, although it did not become legal until the following year. Under the agreement, various improvements were to be made; these included the provision of a station at Royal Oak, and the reconstruction of Westbourne Park. On 30 October 1871 the station at Royal Oak opened, out; it was situated between Ranelagh Bridge and Lord Hill&#x27;s Bridge, and access was from the latter. As originally built, it had three platform faces; one for down trains and two, each side of an island, for up trains. It was served by both main line and Hammersmith &amp; City trains, and, for over sixty years, this was the first stop out of Paddington for main line trains; it remains the first stop for Hammersmith &amp; City services. The station was hit during the 1940-41 blitz, with track, the platform and a nearby main-line train taking bomb damage.

During the quadrupling of the Great Western Main Line (GWML) in 1878, a dive-under, known as Subway Tunnel, was constructed between Royal Oak and Westbourne Park. This was for Hammersmith &amp; City services, allowing them to cross the main line without interfering with the flow of traffic; it was brought into use on 12 May 1878. To accommodate the additional track of the main line, it was necessary to reduce Royal Oak station to two platform faces; the former down platform was removed (its track becoming the up main), and the southern of the two former up platforms became the down platform.

Trains along the GWML ceased to call at Royal Oak from 1 October 1934, but the Hammersmith &amp; City service remained. Ownership of the station was not transferred to London Transport until 1 January 1970. The first GWML stop out of Paddington is now .

===Ranelagh Bridge depot===
There had been a locomotive depot at Westbourne Park since 1855, which was replaced by the Old Oak Common depot in 1906. To avoid the need for locomotives to make the round trip from Paddington just to be turned, coaled and watered, a small maintenance facility for locomotives was constructed on the southern side of the line, directly opposite Royal Oak station, which occupied part of the site of Westbourne Lodge and its grounds. It was known as Ranelagh Bridge depot, and opened in 1907. There was a turntable, a water tower, a coaling stage and sidings where about 15 locomotives could be held awaiting their next trip west. The turntable was removed in April 1964, and the depot facilities were altered to suit Diesel locomotives; the depot closed in 1980.

===Coach station proposal===

At the end of 2018 residents became aware that Royal Oak was under consideration as a possible location for a new coach station to replace Victoria Coach Station, to be built on land north of the station (previously used for soil handling machinery used in construction of the nearby Crossrail tunnels). This was strongly opposed by Westminster&#x27;s main political parties, given the limited capacity of Royal Oak tube station and other local transport links, and the predominantly residential nature of the area. No firm details were published by Transport for London, but opponents of the scheme claimed that Royal Oak was the preferred site, that the scheme would occupy a 10,000 sq m site stretching from Lord&#x27;s Hill Bridge (Royal Oak) to Westbourne Terrace, that a road bridge crossing the area would be closed and removed, and (in letters sent to local residents) that the tube station would have to be closed for an extended period while construction was in progress, since the coach station proposal included step-free access to the platform. On 13 March 2019 the Mayor of London informed local groups that use of the site had been considered but it was not a viable site for this purpose and TfL would not take their plans forward. The Mayor has subsequently told the London Assembly that the area of land may instead be used for other purposes such as sustainable housing and improvements to accessibility at the station.

<doc id="822813" wikidata="Q1670635" url="?curid=822813" title="Mill Hill East tube station">
<text>Mill Hill East is a London Underground station in Mill Hill in the London Borough of Barnet, north London. The station is the terminus and only station of a single-track branch of the Northern line to and from Finchley Central station in the High Barnet branch and is in Travelcard Zone 4. It is the least used station on the Northern line with million passengers in .

The station was opened in 1867 as part of the Great Northern Railway&#x27;s line between Finsbury Park and Edgware stations. As part of London Underground&#x27;s partially completed Northern Heights plan, main line passenger services ended in 1939 and Northern line trains started serving the station in 1941.

==History==
===Main line===

Mill Hill East station was built by the Edgware, Highgate and London Railway (EH&amp;LR) on its line from Finsbury Park station to Edgware station. Before the line was opened it was purchased in July 1867 by the larger Great Northern Railway (GNR), whose main line from King&#x27;s Cross ran through Finsbury Park on its way to Potters Bar and the north. The station, originally named Mill Hill, opened along with the railway to Edgware on 22 August 1867 in what was then rural Middlesex.

The line was built as a double track formation, but only a single track was laid, with the intention of doubling the track when traffic developed. When the GNR opened a branch from Finchley Central to High Barnet in April 1872, traffic on that section was greater and the second track between Finchley Central and Edgware was never laid. For most of its history the service between those two stations was operated as a shuttle.

After the Railways Act 1921 created the &quot;Big Four&quot; railway companies, the GNR became part of the London and North Eastern Railway (LNER) in 1923. The station was given its present name on 1 March 1928.
===Northern Heights project===
In 1935, the London Passenger Transport Board (LPTB) announced a proposal, which became known as the Northern Heights project, to take over the LNER lines from Finsbury Park to Edgware, High Barnet and Alexandra Palace, and link them to both the Northern line at East Finchley and to the Northern City Line at Finsbury Park. Reconstruction of the line from Finchley Central to Edgware with double tracks began in 1938. The line and Mill Hill East station were closed for electrification on 11 September 1939.

Following the outbreak of the Second World War on 3 September 1939, completion of the works on the line was slowed. In order to provide a service to the nearby Inglis Barracks, works continued between Finchley Central and Mill Hill East. The station re-opened with electric Northern line services on 18 May 1941. The planned second platform at Mill Hill East was not built and the service continued to operate over the single track line as before.

===Post-war===
After the war, plans to complete the Northern Heights project were reviewed but no work was carried out. Maintenance works and reconstruction of war damage on the existing network had the greatest call on London Underground funds. Funds for new works were severely limited and priority was given to the completion of the western and eastern extensions of the Central line to West Ruislip, Ongar and Hainault. Despite being shown as under construction on underground maps as late as 1950, work never restarted on the unimplemented parts of the Northern Heights project.

British Railways (the successor to the LNER) freight trains continued to serve the station&#x27;s goods yard until 1 October 1962, when it was closed. The site of the yard is now a business park.

As one of two EH&amp;LR stations retaining their original buildings (with Finchley Central), it is one of the oldest parts of the Underground system, pre-dating the first tunnelled section of the Northern line (the City and South London Railway) by more than twenty years.

==Today==
Refurbishment of the station was carried out and completed in 2007. The works included structural repairs to the station and platforms, the re-decoration and re-tiling of walls and floors, a new public address system, as well as CCTV cameras and Help Points.

The station was made accessible in 2020 by means of a new lift and link bridge, which was prefabricated off site, and craned into position in August 2019. The lift finally opened in February 2020, becoming the Underground&#x27;s 79th step-free station.

It is one of the three tube stations not to have ticket barriers.

==Services==
The station is in Travelcard Zone 4.
With million passengers in , it is the station on the network.

 the Northern line service was a shuttle on the single track between Finchley Central and Mill Hill East, with the exception of peak-hour services.
Direct weekend trains were discontinued on 20 May 2007.
 direct peak time trains operated to either Kennington (via Charing Cross) or Morden (via Bank).

However, in 2021, direct trains were reintroduced, with trains now running either to Battersea Power Station via Charing Cross, or to Morden via Bank, each approximately every 30 minutes, giving a train around every 15 minutes on the branch line to Finchley Central.

==Connections==
London Bus routes 221, 240 and 382 serve the station.

Mill Hill East also serves Saracens F.C. on match-days when shuttle buses run from the station to a short walking distance from their stadium, Allianz Park.

<text>Arnold Ruge (; 13 September 1802 – 31 December 1880) was a German philosopher and political writer. He was the older brother of Ludwig Ruge.

==Studies in university and prison==
Born in Bergen auf Rügen, he studied at Halle, Jena and Heidelberg. As an advocate of a free and united Germany, he shared in the student agitations of 1821–24 and was jailed from 1824 to 1830 in the fortress of Kolberg, where he studied Plato and the Greek poets. Moving to Halle on his release, he published a number of plays (including &quot;Schill und die Seinen&quot;, a tragedy) and translations of ancient Greek texts (e.g. &quot;Oedipus at Colonus&quot;). He became a &quot;Privatdozent&quot; at the University of Halle in 1832.

==Hegelians==
He also became associated with the Young Hegelians. In 1837, with Ernst Theodor Echtermeyer, he founded the &quot;Hallesche Jahrbücher für deutsche Kunst und Wissenschaft&quot;. In this periodical he discussed the questions of the time from the point of view of the Hegelian philosophy. According to Frederick Copleston:
&quot;Ruge shared Hegel&#x27;s belief that history is a progressive advance towards the realization of freedom, and that freedom is attained in the State, the creation of the rational General Will.[...] At the same time he criticized Hegel for having given an interpretation of history which was closed to the future, in the sense that it left no room for novelty.&quot;
The &quot;Jahrbücher&quot; was detested by the orthodox party in Prussia; and was finally suppressed by the Saxon government in 1843, and Ruge left for Paris.

In Paris, Ruge co-edited the &quot;Deutsch–Französische Jahrbücher&quot; with Karl Marx briefly. He had little sympathy with Marx&#x27;s socialistic theories, and soon left him. He left Paris in 1845 for Switzerland, and then became a bookseller in Leipzig.

==Revolutions of 1848==
In the revolutionary movement of 1848, he organized the extreme left in the Frankfurt Parliament, and for some time he lived in Berlin as the editor of the &quot;Die Reform&quot;. He supported the Polish demands during the revolution, but based on his belief that failure to meet Polish demands would result in Russia unleashing &quot;the hatred of the entire Slavic element, of this monstrous family of peoples.&quot;

The Prussian government intervened and Ruge soon afterwards left again for Paris, hoping, through his friend Alexandre Ledru-Rollin, to establish relations between German and French republicans; but in 1849 both Ledru-Rollin and Ruge had to take refuge in London.

==London and Brighton==

In London, in company with Giuseppe Mazzini and other advanced politicians, he formed a &quot;European Democratic Committee.&quot; From this Ruge soon withdrew, and in 1850, Ruge moved to Brighton to live as a teacher and writer. In 1866, he vigorously supported Prussia against Austria in the Austro-Prussian War, and in 1870, he supported Germany against France in the Franco-Prussian War. On a smaller scale, while in Brighton, he was chairman of the successful &quot;Park Crescent Residents&#x27; Association&quot;. In his last years, beginning in 1877, he received from the German government a pension of 1000 marks.

He died in Brighton in 1880.

==Works==
In his time, Ruge was a leader in religious and political liberalism. In 1846-48 his
&quot;Gesammelte Schriften&quot; (Collected writings) were published in ten volumes. After this
time he wrote, among other books, &quot;Manifest an die deutsche Nation&quot; (1866), &quot;Geschichte unserer Zeit&quot; (1881), &quot;Unser System&quot;, &quot;Revolutionsnovellen&quot;,
&quot;Die Loge des Humanismus&quot;, and &quot;Aus früherer Zeit&quot; (his
memoirs; 1863–67). He also wrote many poems, and several dramas and
romances, and translated into German various English works,
including the &quot;Letters of Junius&quot; and Buckle&#x27;s &quot;History of Civilization&quot;.
His &quot;Letters and Diary&quot; (1825–80) were published by Paul Nerrlich
(Berlin, 1885–87). See A. W. Bolin&#x27;s &quot;L. Feuerbach&quot;, pp. 127–52
(Stuttgart, 1891).

<text>Woodgrange Park is a railway station on Romford Road in Manor Park in the London Borough of Newham, east London. It is served by the Suffragette line of the London Overground. It is located down the line from ; it lies in Travelcard Zones 3 and 4. It has only limited station buildings and facilities.

==Location==
The station is on the Suffragette line, west of . Its National Location Code (NLC) is 7467. It stands on Romford Road, a short walk from station with which Woodgrange Park has an official out-of-station interchange. However, the National Rail Timetable suggests interchanging one stop to the west, from to .

==History==
Track was laid through the site in 1854 as part of the first section of the London, Tilbury and Southend line, from Forest Gate Junction on the Eastern Counties Railway to Barking. The LT&amp;SR opened a more direct route from Barking to Fenchurch Street on 11 March 1858 so its trains could avoid the congested station at Stratford. After that the line was used by a small number of Liverpool Street to Barking services operated by the Eastern Counties Railway and after 1862 the Great Eastern Railway. A few goods trains also used this route.

In 1894 the Tottenham and Forest Gate Railway opened a new railway to Tottenham, beginning at a junction just north of the station site. This railway was a joint venture between the Midland Railway and London, Tilbury and Southend line. The station was opened on 9 July 1894 and on opening was served by trains from the new line as well as the few GER Liverpool Street – Barking services. A few services were routed to East Ham via the East Ham loop but the majority went onto to Barking (with a small number continuing to Southend).

Some goods sidings were opened on the Barking end of the station and these acted as exchange sidings between Midland Railway and LT&amp;SR trains as well as serving local businesses. In connection with this facility a short spur line (known as the East Ham Loop) to was opened in 1894 and this allowed LTSR goods trains from the London (Fenchurch Street) direction to access the exchange sidings.

The exchange sidings lasted until 1909 when a new facility between Woodgrange Park and Barking was opened as Woodgrange Park and Barking Goods Yard (which acted as the exchange point between the Great Eastern and LTSR) were congested. The whole of this area was remodelled 1905–1909 as part of the quadrupling from Bromley to Barking and the electrification and extension of District Line services. By 1916 the goods sidings at Woodgrange Park were reduced to coal traffic only and continued in this role until closure whilst the former exchange sidings were used for engineering traffic.

Following the Railways Act 1921 Woodgrange Park became a London, Midland &amp; Scottish Railway (LMS) station. In 1948 the station was taken over by British Railways following nationalisation. The spur from East Ham closed in 1958 when the few remaining T&amp;FG services were diverted to Barking and its closure was part of the scheme to separate the LTS and District Line into two distinct railways. The engineering sidings closed 27 June 1964 and the station coal yard closed 7 December 1964. During 1964 the street level station buildings were demolished and replaced by a new structure and the platform buildings were demolished and replaced by shelters circa 1976. At this time the station was little used.

The section from Forest Gate Junction through the station to Barking was electrified in 1962 as part of the LT&amp;SR modernisation and electrification scheme, and was used by a limited number of c2c services (which do not stop at Woodgrange Park) and by regular freight trains.

The station was closed between October 2016 and February 2017 whilst the rest of the Gospel Oak to Barking line was fully electrified. Electric London Overground trains (Class 710) began serving the station in 2019.

==Design==
It is a station with limited facilities; the ticket office was demolished in the late 1990s, and the space used for a small cycle rack. Staff operate from a container-sized portable office. Recently a number of self-service touch-screen ticket machines have been added, which accept coins, credit cards and notes. Oyster card validators have also been installed. The station was briefly equipped with APTIS equipment in 1988/89.

==Services==
All services at Woodgrange Park are operated by London Overground using EMUs.

The typical off-peak service is four trains per hour in each direction between and . During the late evenings, the service is reduced to three trains per hour in each direction.


==Connections==
London Buses routes 25, 86, 425 and night routes N25 and N86 serve the station.

<text>Luigi Beccali (19 November 1907 – 29 August 1990) was the first Italian to win an Olympic gold medal in running, in the 1500 metres at the 1932 Summer Olympics, and the first Italian to win a European Championship title in athletics.

== Biography ==
Born in Milan, Luigi Beccali, as a youth, was fascinated by cycling and track and field athletics, but choose the latter, when he met the coach Dino Nai.

Luigi Beccali, an Italian champion in 1500 m from 1928 to 1931, became a national hero overnight when he won the Olympic 1500 m gold at Los Angeles.

Beccali finished third behind Reg Thomas in the 1 mile event at the British 1930 AAA Championships. 

In 1933, Beccali ran three world records. At first he equalled Jules Ladoumègue&#x27;s world record 3:49.2, then lowered it to 3:49.0. At the end of the year he also set the world record of 2:10.0.

Beccali won the 1500 m at the first European Championships in 1934, but was outrun by Jack Lovelock at the 1936 Summer Olympics, settling for third place in 1500 m. He was again third in 1500 m at the European Championships in 1938. He also won the Italian championships from 1934 to 1938 in 1500 m and at 1935 in the 5000 m.

Beccali was originally a council surveyor, responsible for road maintenance. His work schedule allowed him to train twice a day. He eventually moved to the United States, and retired from running there in 1941, becoming a wine trader.

<text>The Worm Ouroboros is a heroic high fantasy novel by English writer E. R. Eddison, first published in 1922. The book describes the protracted war between the domineering King Gorice of Witchland and the Lords of Demonland in an imaginary world that appears mainly medieval and partly reminiscent of Norse sagas. The work is slightly related to Eddison&#x27;s later Zimiamvian Trilogy, and collectively they are sometimes referred to as the Zimiamvian series.

&quot;The Worm Ouroboros&quot; is written largely in sixteenth-century English, a nearly unique approach among popular fantasy novels; with Eddison making use of his experience translating Norse sagas and reading medieval and Renaissance poetry. Eddison also incorporated a number of actual early modern poems into the story, including , all meticulously credited in an appendix.

The book was illustrated by Keith Henderson, who also illustrated books by Geoffrey Chaucer and W. H. Hudson.

==Plot==

The novel begins with a framing story in which a character named Lessingham travels from Earth to Mercury. Eddison&#x27;s Mercury, though, is a fantasy world, with no effort made to conform to the scientific knowledge of Mercury at the time. Lessingham and the framing story are not seen again after the second chapter.

Having introduced the chief lords of Demonland—the brothers Juss, Spitfire, and Goldry Bluszco, and their cousin Brandoch Daha—the story begins in earnest with a dwarf ambassador from Witchland arriving in Demonland to demand that the Demons recognize King Gorice XI of Witchland as their overlord. Juss and his brothers reply that they and all of Demonland will submit if the king, a famous wrestler, can defeat Goldry Bluszco in a wrestling match.

The match is held in the neutral territory of the Foliot Isles, and Gorice is killed. His successor (or reincarnation) Gorice XII is a sorcerer who banishes Goldry to an enchanted mountain prison, by means of a perilous sorcery requiring the help of the devious Goblin traitor Lord Gro.

While Lord Spitfire is sent back to raise an army out of Demonland, Lord Juss and his cousin Brandoch Daha, aided by King Gaslark of Goblinland, attempt an assault on Carcë, the capital of the Witches, where they think Goldry is held. The rescue fails, the Goblins flee, and Juss and Brandoch Daha are both captured. They escape with the aid of La Fireez, the prince of Pixyland and vassal of King Gorice, who helps them at great personal cost because he owes them a debt of honor.

Juss and Brandoch Daha return home to Demonland and then start an expedition to rescue Goldry Bluszco from his terrible prison, somewhere past the mountains of Impland. Lord Spitfire again stays behind to lead Demonland&#x27;s armies against an expected invasion from Witchland.

The expedition&#x27;s fleet is smashed and its army destroyed. Juss and Brandoch Daha meet with three strange enchanted heroes of an earlier time, and Juss is later nearly killed by a manticore. After a year of wandering they climb the mighty peak of Koshtra Pivrarcha and then attempt the even more difficult peak of Koshtra Belorn. Before reaching the summit of Koshtra Belorn they encounter Queen Sophonisba, a royal from that area to whom the gods have granted eternal youth.

From Sophonisba they learn that Goldry is held in prison on the top of Zora Rach Nam, a mountain which cannot be climbed and whose peak is surrounded by unceasing flames. There is only one way to free him: they must find a hippogriff&#x27;s egg, and one of them must ride the newly hatched hippogriff. Queen Sophonisba gives Lord Juss a hippogriff egg, but their companion, the Impland native Mivarsh Faz, steals the egg and tries to use it himself, resulting in his death. Lord Juss and Brandoch Daha set out for home, their quest defeated for the time being. But matters are not completely hopeless, as one of Queen Sophonisba&#x27;s martlet scouts has told them of another hippogriff egg lying at the bottom of a lake in Demonland.

Meanwhile, the armies of Witchland have attacked Demonland. Duke Corsus is the first commander of the Witchland army, and conquers part of Demonland, but is defeated by Spitfire. A new Witchland army, under the command of Lord Corinius, defeats Spitfire and captures most of Demonland, including Brandoch Daha&#x27;s castle of Krothering, which had been watched over by his sister Lady Mevrian.

At this point, Lord Gro changes sides and helps Lady Mevrian escape from the grasp of Corinius, who wishes to marry her against her will. A few months later, Lord Juss and Brandoch Daha return and expel the Witches from Demonland.

Equipped with a new hippogriff egg, Lord Juss makes a successful second attempt to rescue his brother. However, his forces are trapped in an inland sea by the Witchland navy. Forced to engage in battle directly, they completely destroy that navy. La Fireez dies in this battle.

The Demons then sail to Carcë and face the remaining forces of Witchland in a climactic struggle. In the battle, Lord Gro is lambasted by Corund for switching sides; Gro responds by killing a Demon and is himself killed by Spitfire. Corund dies from wounds he suffers fighting with the heroes of Demonland.

His armies having failed, King Gorice attempts another terrible summoning; lacking the aid of Gro, he is unable to complete the spell and is destroyed. Duke Corsus poisons the remaining nobles of Witchland, and is killed himself by the dying Corinius.

Though triumphant, the Demon lords find that victory is bitter because there are no more enemies worthy of their heroism, no more great deeds to perform. Sophonisba, seeking to reward their heroism, prays to the gods, who return the world to its state of four years before. And so, with a blare of trumpets, an ambassador from Witchland arrives, &quot;craving present audience&quot; and the story starts anew.

==Characters==

The Demons and their allies

*Lord Juss is the chief lord of Demonland and a chief player in most of the battles in the story. He also leads two expeditions to rescue his brother Goldry Bluszco.
*Goldry Bluszco is the brother of the hero and one of the chief lords of Demonland. Bluszco has two brothers, Lord Juss and Lord Spitfire. Unlike his bachelor brothers, Bluszco was betrothed to marry Princess Armelline of Goblinland.
*Lord Spitfire is a Demon lord who spends most of the story in Demonland fighting the various Witchland invasions. His chief residence is the castle Owlswick.
*Brandoch Daha is a lord of Demonland and the greatest swordsman of the age. After Corinius sacks his castle of Krothering, Brandoch Daha swears vengeance against Corinius.
*Lady Mevrian is a great lady of Demonland and the sister of Brandoch Daha, who is left the task of defending her brother&#x27;s castle of Krothering against Corinius&#x27;s army. After a siege, the castle is taken and Lady Mevrian has to fend off the advances of Corinius. She is able to escape only with the aid of Heming and Cargo (Corund&#x27;s sons) and Lord Gro, who betrays Witchland to help her.
*Prince La Fireez is the ruler of Pixyland. Witchland has asserted suzerainty over his land, but he is consistently a Demon ally by way of repaying Lord Juss for saving his life. He dies in a naval battle.
The Witchlanders and their allies

*Gorice is the King of Witchland, ruling from Carcë; he is said to be a single king with twelve incarnations. His eleventh incarnation, a champion wrestler, is killed in a wrestling match by Goldry Bluszco; his twelfth, a sorcerer, wears a signet ring in the shape of the ouroboros of the book&#x27;s title.
*Corinius is a warrior leader of Witchland, full of life and ambition. He is an enemy of Demonland, and as warrior of some skill he commands some respect from the lords of Demonland. He is poisoned by Duke Corsus and dies right after the Demons take Carcë.
*Duke Corsus is one of the war leaders of the armies of Witchland. Duke Corsus was the chief war leader of Witchland a decade before the story begins. Corsus is wily and skillful but prone to drinking and no longer young. Right before the Demons conquer Carcë, he poisons Corinius, his wife Zenambria, his son Dekalajus, Corund&#x27;s son Viglus, and Corund&#x27;s son Heming. Corinius kills him when he realizes that Corsus poisoned him.
*Lord Corund is the chief war leader of the armies of Witchland. He is a noble man, a mighty warrior, and has some respect from the main characters. Corund leads the Witchland army against the Demonland expedition to Impland. He is fatally wounded by Lord Juss.
*Lord Gro is an advisor to Witchland; later he is an ally of Demonland. Gro is originally from Goblinland and was the foster-brother of King Gaslark before a falling-out. Gro is a famous explorer and wrote a book about his travels through Impland. Gro provides crucial aid to King Gorice XII of Witchland when he summons the magic which carries Goldry Bluszco away. He acts as an advisor and trusted messenger to the King regarding the campaign in Demonland. While in Demonland he meets and falls in love with Brandoch Daha&#x27;s sister, the Lady Mevrian. Because of his love, he betrays the Witchland army and helps Mevrian escape from Corinius after Corinius captures her brother&#x27;s castle of Krothering.
*Lady Prezmyra is the young wife of Corund and the sister of La Fireez of Pixyland. She is a close friend of Lord Gro, and poisons herself, after the death of her husband and her brother, when the Demons conquer Carcë.

==The kingdoms of Mercury==
The named nations and countries are:
* Witchland

* Demonland

* Pixyland
* Impland
* Goblinland
* The Foliot Isles
* The land Zimiamvia (beyond the known world)
* The Ghouls, wiped out in a genocidal war a few years before the story opens

The King of Witchland claims lordship over a number of locations which are not described (page 12):
* Duke of Buteny and Estremerine
* Commander of Shulan, Thramnë, Mingos, and Permio
* Warden of the Esamocian Marches
* Duke of Trace
* King Paramount of Beshtria and Nevria
* Prince of Ar
* Great Lord over Ojedia, Maltraëny, Baltary, and Toribia

Despite the names of the nations, all the characters in the book are recognizably human and they are all the same species, or at least able to intermarry (&quot;e.g.&quot;, Goldry Bluszco and Princess Armelline, Lord Corund and Lady Prezmyra). Witchland, Demonland, and others appear to be country names, like England and France. When first presented, the Demons are seen to have horns on their heads, but these horns are not mentioned again, nor is it said whether the other peoples have horns.

===Maps===

* Gerald Hayes, a cartographer with the Royal Navy, created the first map for &quot;Ouroboros&quot; circa 1925, initially from internal evidence, and later in consultation with Eddison. He states in a letter to C.S. Lewis that he secured Eddison&#x27;s approval &quot;as a true presentation of all the lands, seas, and countries of his history.&quot;
* Another map of the world by Bernard Morris was published in &quot;Twilight Zine&quot; No. 4 and reprinted in the book &quot;An Atlas of Fantasy&quot; (compiled by Jeremiah Benjamin Post) in 1979.
* For another map of these lands created by J. B. Hare in 2004, see The world of The Worm Ouroboros. For a German map by Erhard Ringer see Der Wurm Ouroboros
* The map on this page was created by David Bedell in 1978.

==Background==

Research done by Paul Edmund Thomas (who wrote an introduction to the 1991 Dell edition) shows that Eddison started imagining the stories which would turn into &quot;The Worm Ouroboros&quot; at a very early age. An exercise book titled &quot;The Book of Drawings&quot; dated 1892 and created by Eddison is in the Bodleian Library. In this book are 59 drawings in pencil, captioned by the author, containing many of the heroes and villains of the later work. Some of the drawings, such as &quot;The murder of Gallandus by Corsus&quot; and &quot;Lord Brandoch Daha challenging Lord Corund&quot;, depict events of &quot;Ouroboros&quot;.

As might be expected, significant differences exist between the ideas of a 10-year-old boy and the work of a 40-year-old man. Perhaps the most interesting change is in Lord Gro&#x27;s character. In the drawings Lord Gro is a hero of skill and courage, while in the book he is a conflicted character, never able to pick a side and stick to it. Another curious change is that Goldry Bluszco is the main hero of the drawings, but off-stage in an enchanted prison for most of the novel.

Many people (including J. R. R. Tolkien) have wondered at and criticized Eddison&#x27;s curious names for his characters (e.g. La Fireez, Fax Fay Faz), places and nations. According to Thomas, the answer appears to be that these names originated in the mind of a young boy, and Eddison could not, or would not, change them thirty years later when he wrote the stories down.

==Meaning of the title==
The title refers to Ouroboros (&quot;Jörmungandr&quot; in Norse mythology), the snake or dragon that swallows its own tail and therefore has no terminus (in Old English, the word &quot;worm&quot; could mean a serpent or dragon).

Like the Ouroboros, the story ends at the same place as it begins, when the heroes realize that their lives have little meaning without the great conflict and wish that it could continue, and their wish is granted.

The theme of repetition pervades the work. Near the beginning and again near the end, a king of Witchland dies, Carcë is attacked, and Gorice XII carries out a conjuring in the fortress&#x27;s Iron Tower. There are two quests to find and recover Goldry Bluszco. Three armies, under the influence of an enchantment, chase each other in an endless campaign until the heroes shatter the cycle on their quest.

==Comparison with other works==

&quot;The Worm Ouroboros&quot; is often compared with J. R. R. Tolkien&#x27;s &quot;The Lord of the Rings&quot; (which it predates by 32 years). Tolkien had known Eddison personally and had read &quot;The Worm Ouroboros&quot;, and praised it in print, although in a 1957 letter he said of Eddison &quot;I thought that, corrupted by an evil and indeed silly &#x27;philosophy&#x27;, he was coming to admire, more and more, arrogance and cruelty. Incidentally, I thought his nomenclature slipshod and often inept.&quot; C. S. Lewis wrote a short preface to an anthology of Eddison&#x27;s works, including &quot;The Worm Ouroboros&quot;, concluding that &quot;No writer can be said to remind us of Eddison.&quot;

In contrast to &quot;The Lord of the Rings&quot;, to which mythopoeia is central, Eddison makes few references either to actual mythology or to an invented mythology after the fashion of the &quot;Silmarillion&quot;. One example of this is Eddison&#x27;s &quot;ad hoc&quot; names for people and places versus Tolkien&#x27;s invention of entire languages.

The tale&#x27;s morality has also been described as uncommon in modern fantasy; in particular, it differs sharply from Tolkien&#x27;s heroism of the common man in a fight against evil and C. S. Lewis&#x27;s Christian allegory. The Demon lords hold to the Old Norse warrior ethic of loyalty and glory. The leaders of Witchland are regarded as noble and worthy opponents; in the final chapter, Goldry Bluszco compares them very favorably with the &quot;uncivil races&quot; of Impland.

==Influence and reception==

&quot;New York Times&quot; critic Edwin Clark praised the novel lavishly, saying &quot;This romance has the gaudiness and flair of the Elizabethans. It has the exuberance of great appetites and vigorous living. It transcends all ordinary life. It burns with the wonder and awe of excess.&quot; But Clark also noted that Eddison &quot;is stylistic in the grand and heroic manner that evokes beauty and vigorous life, but it seems to us that without injury to his verbal charm or loss of beauty in his passage of atmosphere saturated with glamour of nature, he could have removed much that would quicken the action of his narration to a more attractive pace.&quot;

Reviewing a 1952 edition, Boucher and McComas described it as &quot;one of the major imaginative novels of this century&quot; and &quot;the detailed creation of a vividly heroic alien history.&quot; They particularly commended &quot;the resonant clangor of its prose, the tremendous impetus of its story-telling, [and] the magnificent audacity (and sternly convincing consistency) of its fantasy concepts.&quot; Donald Barr declared that Eddison wrote &quot;in a heroic prose made of high ceremonial gestures and tropes from the great age of metaphor and described &quot;The Worm&quot; as being &quot;quite unique among modern novels&quot; as &quot;a narrative of pure event&quot; where, with a lone exception, &quot;we are never given the interior of a character, only the actions&quot;.

In 1963, Avram Davidson praised the novel&#x27;s prose for &quot;abound[ing] in beautiful, quotable language&quot; and its story as one of &quot;war, witchcraft, adventure, conspiracy, violence, bloodshed, intrigue.&quot; Davidson, though, faulted Eddison&#x27;s conception, saying &quot;&quot;Ouroboros&quot; is a classic, but it is not and cannot be a great classic,&quot; because it lacks &quot;humanity&quot;—the realistic detail of great works like the Arabian Nights, where characters &quot;do not merely kiss and declaim and posture.&quot; However, J. Max Patrick, also reviewing the Xanadu paperback, dismissed the novel as &quot;a pseudo-Ossianic epic, adolescent in tone and pretentiously archaic&quot;, although commenting that &quot;Eddison sometimes achieves the splendid prose and gorgeous artifice appropriate to his sagas.&quot;

In 1973, Ursula K. Le Guin wrote about the beauty of the language, and the consistency of the archaic style Eddison employed. She writes that one of the goals of fantasy is to create a sense of distance from the ordinary and that “The archaic manner is indeed a perfect distancer, but you have to do it perfectly.  It is a high wire: one slip spoils all. The man who did it perfectly of course was Eddison... If you love language for its own sake he is irresistible.&quot; Le Guin continues, &quot;The prose, in spite of or because of its anachronism, is good prose: exact, clear, powerful. Visually it is precise and vivid; musically – that is, in the sound of the words, the movement of the syntax, the rhythm of the sentences – it is subtle and very strong.&quot;

In 1983, E. F. Bleiler praised &quot;The Worm Ouroboros&quot; as &quot;still the finest heroic fantasy.&quot;

Karl Edward Wagner was influenced by &quot;The Worm Ouroboros&quot; as a teenager. Clive Barker has cited &quot;The Worm Ouroboros&quot; as an influence on his work. Michael Swanwick quotes from &quot;Ouroboros&quot; in &quot;The Dragons of Babel&quot;.

American herpetologist Emmett Reid Dunn named a species of South American lizard &quot;Morunasaurus groi&quot;, after the character Lord Gro.

<doc id="822894" wikidata="Q1021243" url="?curid=822894" title="Michael Rockefeller">
<text>Michael Clark Rockefeller (May 18, 1938; disappeared November 19, 1961) was a member of the Rockefeller family. He was a son of New York Governor and later U.S. Vice President Nelson Rockefeller, a grandson of American financier John D. Rockefeller Jr., and a great-grandson of Standard Oil co-founder John D. Rockefeller Sr.

Rockefeller disappeared during an expedition in the Asmat region of southwestern Dutch New Guinea, which is now a part of the Indonesian province of South Papua. In 2014, Carl Hoffman published a book that included details from the official inquest into the disappearance, in which villagers and tribal elders admitted to Rockefeller being killed and eaten after swimming to shore in 1961. Rockefeller&#x27;s twin sister wrote in a memoir published in 2012 that she believes her brother drowned. No remains of Rockefeller or physical proof of his death have been discovered. 

==Early life==
Michael Rockefeller was born on May 18, 1938, the fifth and last child of Nelson and Mary Todhunter Rockefeller. He was the third son of seven children fathered by Nelson, and he had a twin sister named Mary. Rockefeller attended the Buckley School in New York City and graduated from the Phillips Exeter Academy in New Hampshire, where he was a student senator and exceptional varsity wrestler. He then graduated &quot;cum laude&quot; from Harvard University with an A.B. in history and economics. He also served for six months in 1960 as a private in the United States Army.

Following his military service, Rockefeller went on an expedition for Harvard&#x27;s Peabody Museum of Archaeology and Ethnology to study the Dani tribe of western Dutch New Guinea. The expedition filmed &quot;Dead Birds&quot;, an ethnographic documentary film produced by Robert Gardner, for which Rockefeller was the sound recordist. 

Rockefeller and a friend briefly left the Peabody expedition to study the Asmat tribe of southern Dutch New Guinea. After the expedition ended, Rockefeller returned to New Guinea to study the Asmat and collect their distinctive woodwork art.

&quot;It&#x27;s the desire to do something adventurous,&quot; he explained, &quot;at a time when frontiers, in the real sense of the word, are disappearing.&quot;

Rockefeller spent his time in New Guinea actively engaged with the culture and the art while recording ethnographic data. In one of his letters back home, he wrote:

I am having a thoroughly exhausting but most exciting time here ... The Asmat is like a huge puzzle with the variations in ceremony and art style forming the pieces. My trips are enabling me to comprehend (if only in a superficial, rudimentary manner) the nature of this puzzle ...

==Disappearance==

On November 17, 1961, Rockefeller and Dutch anthropologist René Wassing were in a dugout canoe about from shore when their double pontoon boat was swamped and overturned. Their two local guides swam for help, but it was slow in coming. After drifting for some time, early on November 19, Rockefeller said to Wassing: &quot;I think I can make it.&quot; According to Wassing, Rockefeller created a float for himself out of a jerry can and the boat&#x27;s gas tank, took a compass and knife, and set off for the shore between 7 and 8 a.m. on November 19. Wassing&#x27;s last sight of him was about 30 minutes later: &quot;I saw him in a straight line going towards shore until I just saw three dots: the two cans and his head&quot;. 

Wassing was rescued the next day, but Rockefeller was never seen again despite an intensive and lengthy search effort. According to Rockefeller&#x27;s surviving twin Mary Morgan, who accompanied her father to South Papua to participate in the search for her brother, &quot;The Dutch and Australian naval and air units had been sending out helicopters and boats to participate in the search, along with the local Dutch control officers. And many of the Asmat villagers were valiantly combing the small rivers in their canoes for some evidence of Michael&quot;. At the time, his disappearance was major international news. His body was never found, and he was declared legally dead in 1964.

==Speculation==

It was originally reported that Rockefeller either drowned or was attacked by an animal, such as a shark or saltwater crocodile. The boat was an estimated from the shore when Rockefeller made the attempt to swim to safety, supporting the theory that he died from exposure, exhaustion or drowning. 

However, because headhunting and cannibalism were still present in some areas of Asmat in 1961, and still are, there has also been widespread speculation based around local testimony that Rockefeller was killed and eaten by tribespeople from the Asmat village of Otsjanep. 

Two Dutch missionaries, who were fluent in local languages and who had been living in the area for years, accumulated a large amount of testimony from witnesses. The account repeated by a number of villagers was that Rockefeller was pulled out of the water wearing underwear, and despite a dispute about whether or not he should be killed, he was non-fatally stabbed in the abdomen and later finished off somewhere along the Jawor River. 

In December 1961, four locals told minister Hubertus von Peij that Rockefeller&#x27;s remains and personal effects, including his head, long bones, ribs, shorts, and glasses, had been divided amongst 15 Asmats. Von Peij and missionary Cornelius van Kessel both wrote the same regional supervisor, repeating nearly identical accounts with myriad supporting details from residents of four separate villages in the vicinity. Both ministers expressed a very high degree of certainty that Rockefeller had been killed by local warriors. The motive for killing him was revenge for the killing of five Otsjanep residents, Faratsjam, Osom, Akon, Samut, and Ipi, by Dutch colonial soldiers under administrator Max Lapré, who opened fire on the villagers in January 1958. 

The first public report that Rockefeller was killed and dismembered, and his long bones turned into weapons and fishing equipment, was published by the Associated Press in March 1962. A second investigation later that year by a patrolman named Wim van de Waal on behalf of Dutch colonial government came to the same conclusion. Van de Waal was given a &quot;skull bearing no lower jaw and a hole in the right temple—the hallmarks of remains that had been headhunted and opened to consume the brains&quot; which he turned over to Dutch authorities, who never asked him to write a written report and never asked him to verbally report his conclusion. The information was apparently deemed politically sensitive, in part because of the fragile state of the Dutch empire in the Indonesian archipelago and in part because of Nelson Rockefeller&#x27;s political celebrity in the United States. The findings of van de Waal&#x27;s investigation are restated in the written memoir of Anton van de Wouw, a successor missionary to van Kessel. 

In 1969, journalist Milt Machlin traveled to the island to investigate Rockefeller&#x27;s disappearance. He dismissed reports of Rockefeller living as a captive or as a Kurtz-like figure in the jungle, but concluded that circumstantial evidence supported the idea that he had been killed. Neither cannibalism nor headhunting in Asmat were indiscriminate, but rather were part of an eye-for-an-eye revenge cycle, so it is possible that Rockefeller found himself the victim of such a cycle. Under the Asmat belief system, several of the killers, named Fin, Ajim, Pep, Jane, Samut, would have had &quot;sacred obligation to avenge the deaths of the men killed by Lepré&quot;.

Author Paul Toohey, in his book &quot;Rocky Goes West&quot;, claims that Rockefeller&#x27;s mother hired a private investigator in 1979 to go to New Guinea and try to solve his disappearance. The reliability of this story has been questioned, but Toohey claims that the private investigator swapped a boat engine for the skulls of the three men that a tribe claimed were the only white men they had ever killed. The investigator returned to New York and handed these skulls to the family, convinced that one of them was the skull of Rockefeller. If this event did actually occur, the family has never commented on it. However, the History Channel program &quot;Vanishings&quot; reported that Rockefeller&#x27;s mother did pay a $250,000 reward to the private investigator, which was offered for final proof of whether Rockefeller was alive or dead.

In the documentary film &quot;Keep the River on Your Right&quot;, Tobias Schneebaum states that he spoke with some Asmat villagers at Otsjanep, who described finding Rockefeller on the riverside and eating him.

In 2014, Mary Rockefeller Morgan wrote of her twin brother&#x27;s disappearance:

===2014 book on his disappearance===
In 2014, Carl Hoffman published the book &quot;Savage Harvest: A Tale of Cannibals, Colonialism, and Michael Rockefeller&#x27;s Tragic Quest for Primitive Art&quot;, in which he discusses researching Rockefeller&#x27;s disappearance and presumed death. During multiple visits to the villages in the area, Hoffman heard several stories about men from Otsjanep killing Rockefeller after he had swum to shore. The stories, which were similar to testimonials collected in the 1960s, center around a handful of men arguing and eventually deciding to kill Rockefeller in revenge for the 1958 incident. Soon afterward, the villages were swept by a cholera epidemic, leading the villagers to believe that it was retribution for Rockefeller&#x27;s death. As Hoffman left one of the villages for the final time, he witnessed a man acting out a scene wherein someone was killed, and he stopped to videotape it. When translated, the man was quoted as saying:

Don&#x27;t you tell this story to any other man or any other village, because this story is only for us. Don&#x27;t speak. Don&#x27;t speak and tell the story. I hope you remember it and you must keep this for us. I hope. I hope. This is for you and you only. Don&#x27;t talk to anyone, forever; to other people or another village. If people question you, don&#x27;t answer. Don&#x27;t talk to them, because this story is only for you. If you tell it to them, you&#x27;ll die. I am afraid you will die. You&#x27;ll be dead; your people will be dead, if you tell this story. You keep this story in your house; to yourself, I hope, forever. Forever.

==Asmat artifacts and photographs==
Many of the Asmat artifacts Rockefeller collected are part of the Michael C. Rockefeller Wing collection at the Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York. The Peabody Museum has published the catalogue of an exhibition of pictures taken by Rockefeller during their New Guinea expedition.

== Memorial ==
There is a memorial stained glass window for Michael Rockefeller, designed by the artist Marc Chagall, installed at Union Church of Pocantico Hills. Rockefeller&#x27;s twin Mary became a therapist in later life and following 9/11 led a bereavement support group for survivors who had lost their twins in the 2001 terrorist attacks on New York and Washington, D.C. 

==In popular culture==
The 1973 &quot;National Lampoon Comics&quot; compilation contained the story &quot;New Guinea Pig&quot;, originally published in the July 1972 issue, which focused on Rockefeller&#x27;s disappearance as being a ruse, so he could kill all the black people in New Guinea and his family could steal their resources.

Rockefeller&#x27;s disappearance was the subject of episode 30 of &quot;In Search of ...&quot;, which originally aired January 21, 1978.

The band Guadalcanal Diary wrote a song about Rockefeller&#x27;s disappearance called &quot;Michael Rockefeller&quot;. The song appeared on their 1986 album &quot;Jamboree&quot;.

In the travel adventure book &quot;Ring of Fire: An Indonesian Odyssey&quot;, the Blair brothers claim to have discussed Rockefeller&#x27;s death with a tribesman who killed him.

Christopher Stokes&#x27;s short story &quot;The Man Who Ate Michael Rockefeller&quot;, published in the 23rd issue of &quot;McSweeney&#x27;s Quarterly Concern&quot; (Spring 2007), presents a fictional account of young Michael&#x27;s demise.

The 2004 novel &quot;King of America&quot; by Samantha Gillison is loosely based on the life of Michael Rockefeller.

The 2007 film &quot;Welcome to the Jungle&quot; deals with two young couples who venture after Michael Rockefeller (thinking they can make a lot of money if they find evidence of Rockefeller), but meet grisly demises.

Jeff Cohen&#x27;s play &quot;The Man Who Ate Michael Rockefeller&quot;, based on the short story by Christopher Stokes, had its world premiere in an Off Broadway production at the West End Theatre in New York. The play, a Critics Pick in &quot;The New York Times&quot; and &quot;Time Out New York&quot;, was directed by Alfred Preisser, and ran from September 10 to October 3, 2010. Producer Elizabeth McCann was planning to bring the play to Broadway when Michael&#x27;s surviving twin sister, Mary Rockefeller, objected and those plans were scuttled.

In 2011, Agamemnon Films released a documentary titled &quot;The Search for Michael Rockefeller&quot;, based on journalist Milt Machlin&#x27;s book of the same name released in 1974. In his book, Carl Hoffman characterized Machlin&#x27;s early book as &quot;mostly the tale of a wild-goose chase&quot;, but still important in laying the groundwork for questioning official stories of Rockefeller&#x27;s disappearance. The film introduces a third theory, that Rockefeller survived and was living among the locals. This theory is supported by a verbal claim of contact made by a mysterious Australian adventurer, plus a few frames of film footage showing a bearded white man among indigenous men, wearing local garb.

In 2012, Michael&#x27;s surviving twin sister Mary published a memoir, titled &quot;Beginning with the End: A Memoir of Twin Loss and Healing,&quot; about coping with her grief after the death of her brother. The book was issued in paperback in 2014 as &quot;When Grief Calls Forth the Healing.

In their 2013 album &quot;The Devil Herself&quot;, band Megan Jean and the KFB features the song &quot;Tobias&quot; which features the lyrics &quot;We lived amongst the tribe that ate Rockefeller / Out in Papua New Guinea I&#x27;d give you the skinny / Get eaten if I tell ya&quot;.

The chorus of Jenny Lewis&#x27;s song &quot;Hollywood Lawn&quot; off her 2019 album &quot;On the Line&quot; features the lyrics &quot;I&#x27;m long lost like Rockefeller / drifting off to sea.&quot;

<doc id="822900" wikidata="Q1739397" url="?curid=822900" title="Dounreay">
<text>Dounreay (; ) is a small settlement and the site of two large nuclear establishments on the north coast of Caithness in the Highland area of Scotland. It is on the A836 road west of Thurso.

The nuclear establishments were created in the 1950s. They were the Nuclear Power Development Establishment (NPDE), now known as NRS Dounreay, for the development of civil fast breeder reactors, and the Vulcan Naval Reactor Test Establishment (NRTE), a military submarine reactor testing facility. Both these no longer perform their original research functions and will be completely decommissioned. The two establishments have been a major element in the economy of Thurso and Caithness, but this will decrease with the progress of decommissioning.

NRS Dounreay will enter an interim care and surveillance state by 2036, and become a brownfield site by 2336. An announcement in July 2020 that the Nuclear Decommissioning Authority (NDA) will be taking over direct management of the site from the site licence company Dounreay Site Restoration Limited (DSRL) in 2021 has alleviated fears of 560 job losses.

The NRTE is to be decommissioned under a ten-year contract starting in 2023, ending in the creation of a brownfield site, which would be transferred to the NDA.

==Dounreay settlement==
Dounreay is the site of Dounreay Castle (now a ruin) and its name derives from the Gaelic for &#x27;fort on a mound&#x27;. Dounreay was the site of the battle of Sandside Chase in 1437. Robert Gordon&#x27;s map of Caithness, 1642, uses &quot;Dounrae&quot; as the name of the castle. William J. Watson&#x27;s &quot;The Celtic Place-names of Scotland&quot; gives the origin as &quot;Dúnrath&quot;, possibly a reference to a broch.

Dounreay was the site of a Second World War airfield, named RAF Dounreay. It became HMS &quot;Tern&quot; (II) in 1944 when the airfield was transferred to the Admiralty from RAF Coastal Command as a satellite of HMS &quot;Tern&quot; at Twatt in Orkney. It never saw any action during the war and was placed into &quot;care and maintenance&quot; in 1949.

==Nuclear sites==
There are two nuclear sites at Lower Dounreay built on and around the site of the former airfield. The Nuclear Power Development Establishment site is owned by the Nuclear Decommissioning Authority (NDA) but was previously owned and run by the United Kingdom Atomic Energy Authority. Adjacent to this site is the Ministry of Defence Vulcan Naval Reactor Test Establishment. The two sites are best known for their five nuclear reactors, three formerly owned and operated by the UKAEA and two by the Ministry of Defence.

The sites are adjacent to the North Atlantic Ocean, with south east winds prevailing.

During the 1980s and 1990s, a visitor centre was opened in the former air traffic control tower. Visitors would be taken by bus to the PFR building where anything electronic, including watches and cameras, would be stored away securely until return. White coats were worn along with radiation badges. A guided tour through the air lock into the reactor building was then conducted, walking around the reactor core and then returning via scientists working behind thick mineral glass screens.

==Dounreay Nuclear Power Development Establishment==

Dounreay Nuclear Power Development Establishment was formed in 1955 primarily to pursue the UK Government policy of developing civil fast breeder reactor (FBR) technology. The site was operated by the United Kingdom Atomic Energy Authority (UKAEA). Three nuclear reactors were built there by the UKAEA, first a materials test reactor, then two fast breeder reactor prototypes. There were also fabrication and reprocessing facilities for the materials test rigs and for fuel for the FBRs.

Dounreay was chosen as the reactor location, remote from large centres of population, for safety reasons. The site was operated by the site licence company Dounreay Site Restoration Ltd (DSRL) from 2008, and in 2012 management was contracted out to a Babcock-led consortium. However, the NDA was to assume complete control when DSRL became a wholly owned subsidiary of the NDA in March 2021.

===Dounreay Materials Test Reactor (DMTR)===
The first of the Dounreay reactors to achieve criticality was the Dounreay Materials Test Reactor (DMTR) in May 1958, which was a DIDO class research reactor, producing a high neutron flux. This reactor was used to test the performance of materials under intense neutron irradiation, particularly those intended for fuel cladding and other structural uses in a fast neutron reactor core. Test pieces were encased in uranium-bearing alloy to increase the already high neutron flux of this class of reactor, and then chemically stripped of this coating after irradiation. DMTR was closed in 1969 when materials testing work was consolidated at Harwell Laboratory.


===Dounreay Fast Reactor (DFR)===
The second operational reactor (although the first to commence construction) was the Dounreay Fast Reactor (DFR), which achieved criticality on 14 November 1959. Power was exported to the National Grid from 14 October 1962 until the reactor was taken offline for decommissioning in March 1977. During its operational lifespan, DFR produced over 600millionkWh of electricity, of which 540 million kWh was supplied to the grid.

DFR and associated facilities cost £15million to build in late-1950s money (equivalent to £370million in 2021). It was designed to generate 60MW thermal power and achieve a 2% fuel burn-up. It reached 30MWt in August 1962, and 60MWt in July 1963 allowing it to produce its rated 14MWe (electrical). The reactor was surrounded by a steel sphere, still a prominent feature of the landscape, which was constructed by the Motherwell Bridge Company.

DFR was a loop-type FBR cooled by primary and secondary NaK circuits, with 24 primary coolant loops. The reactor core was initially fuelled with uranium metal fuel stabilised with molybdenum and clad in niobium. The core was later used to test oxide fuels for PFR and provide experimental space to support overseas fast reactor fuel and materials development programmes.

It had over 5,000 breeder elements of natural uranium in stainless steel arranged in inner and outer breeder sections. Many were replaced in 1965.

The peak annual net output of 55.9 GWh occurred in 1972, while the lifetime average annual net output was 32.1 GWh. 

===Prototype Fast Reactor (PFR)===
The third and final UKAEA-operated reactor to be built on the Dounreay site was the Prototype Fast Reactor (PFR). In 1966, it was announced that the PFR would be built at Dounreay. PFR was a pool-type fast breeder reactor, cooled by 1,500tonnes of liquid sodium and fuelled with MOX. The design output of PFR was 250MWe (electrical). 

It achieved criticality in 1974 and began supplying National Grid power in January 1975. There were many delays and reliability problems before reaching full power. It had three cooling circuits. Leaks in the sodium water steam generators shut down one and then two of the cooling circuits in 1974 and 1975. By August 1976 it had reached 500MWt, (to produce about 166 MWe) and in 1985 it first reached its design output of 250MWe.

In 1988, it was announced that funding for FBR research was being cut from £105million to £10million per year, and the PFR funding would end in 1994.

The reactor was taken offline in 1994, marking the end of nuclear power generation at the site. It had supplied 9,250GWh in all. The lifetime load factor recorded by the IAEA was 26.9%. The peak and lifetime average annual net outputs were 1042.6 GWh and 528.1 GWh, respectively. 

The control panel for the reactor was earmarked for an exhibition on the reactor at the London Science Museum in 2016.

=== Fuel Cycle Area (FCA) ===

==== Material Test Reactor (MTR) Fuel Reprocessing Plant ====
A plant for reprocessing MTR fuel was built early in the life of the Dounreay facility and operated for over 30 years, reprocessing on a small scale both fuel from UKAEA and other British reactors and, on a commercial basis, some foreign fuel.

==== Dounreay Fast Reactor Irradiated Fuel Reprocessing Plant ====
In the late 1950s the Dounreay Fast Reactor Irradiated Fuel Reprocessing Plant was built to reprocess irradiated HEU core fuel from the 15MW(e) Dounreay Experimental Fast Reactor. The main output from this plant was a highly pure solution of enriched uranium nitrate solution for subsequent re-fabrication into fuel. It was not efficient to use this plant for reprocessing natural or low enriched fuel, Dounreay breeder blanket fuel was reprocessed at Windscale/Sellafield. In the 1970s this plant was substantially modified and enlarged to enable it to reprocess mixed oxide fuel from the commercial scale Prototype Fast Reactor (PFR) on site, which had a design output of 250MW(e). This fuel had a high plutonium content, unlike the HEU fuel previously handled, and a plutonium separation and purification line to produce plutonium oxide was added. The modifications included work to improve containment and to meet more modern safety standards.

===Subsequent activity===
Since the reactors have all been shut down, care and maintenance of old plant and decommissioning activities have meant that Dounreay has still retained a large workforce. Commercial reprocessing of spent nuclear fuel and waste on the Dounreay site was stopped by the UK government in 1998 although some waste is still accepted from other nuclear facilities in special circumstances.

==Significant accidents==
===Sodium explosion===
A deep shaft at the plant was packed with radioactive waste and at least 2kg of sodium and potassium. On 10 May 1977, seawater, which flooded the shaft, reacted violently with the sodium and potassium, throwing off the massive steel and concrete lids of the shaft. This explosion littered the area with radioactive particles.

===Radioactive fuel swarf===
Tens of thousands of fragments of radioactive fuel escaped the plant between 1963 and 1984, resulting in fishing being banned within of the plant since 1997. These milled shards are thought to have washed into the sea as cooling ponds were drained. 
, over 2,300 radioactive particles had been recovered from the sea floor, and over 480 from the beaches. 
 the 2km ban on harvesting seafood was still in place, but there were no other restrictions.

=== Major power failure===
Following an incident in May 1998, where a mechanical digger cut through a main power cable and interrupted the site&#x27;s main and back-up electricity supplies for 16 hours, operations were halted in the Fuel Cycle Area (FCA) and a safety audit of the plant was undertaken by the UK Health and Safety Executive and the Scottish Environment Protection Agency. In September 1998, the highly critical report was published and made 143 recommendations for improvement.

The main points of concern were:
* Weak management and technical base due to organisational changes
* Over-dependence on contractors
* No comprehensive strategy for waste disposal
* Lack of progress with decommissioning
* Lack of integration of decommissioning and waste strategies
* Poor physical condition of plant
* Scope of rapid reporting was too narrow
* Failure to work to the standards required of a modern nuclear licensee

The final report in 2001 on the audit noted that the UKAEA had responded satisfactorily to 89 recommendations, and the remaining 54 would be responded to in the medium to long term.
In November 1998, in the report &quot;Dounreay - The way ahead&quot;, the UKAEA announced a proposed timetable for accelerated decommissioning, reducing the original schedule from 100years to 60years. The cost was initially estimated at £4.3billion.
An accelerated decommissioning plan was welcomed by the Friends of the Earth Scotland, but the environmental group remained opposed to further fuel reprocessing at the site.

==Removal of fuel==
Following the 1998 report, the Department of Trade and Industry was presented with three options for dealing with 25tonnes of radioactive reactor fuel at Dounreay. The options were:
#to reprocess it at Dounreay,
#to reprocess some at Dounreay and some at Sellafield, or
#to store it above ground at Dounreay.
A plan was eventually devised to remove irradiated and unirradiated fuel to the Sellafield nuclear site, starting in 2014. In 2018, the NDA reported that it would be completed in 2018/2019.

==Nuclear Decommissioning Authority ownership==
On 1 April 2005, the Nuclear Decommissioning Authority (NDA) became the owner of the site, with the UKAEA remaining as operator. Decommissioning of Dounreay was initially planned to bring the site to an interim care and surveillance state by 2036, and as a brownfield site by 2336, at a total cost of £2.9billion.

A new company called Dounreay Site Restoration Limited (DSRL) was formed as a subsidiary of the United Kingdom Atomic Energy Authority (UKAEA) to handle the decommissioning process. By May 2008, decommissioning cost estimates had been revised. Removal of all waste from the site was expected to take until the late 2070s to complete, and the end-point of the project was scheduled for 2300.

Apart from decommissioning the reactors, reprocessing plant, and associated facilities, there were five main environmental issues to be dealt with:
* A shaft used for intermediate-level nuclear waste disposal was contaminating groundwater, and would be threatened by coastal erosion in about 300years. The shaft was never designed as a waste depository, but was used as such on a very ad hoc and poorly monitored basis, without reliable waste disposal records being kept. It was originally used to construct a tunnel for the sea discharge pipe. Later use of the shaft as a convenient waste depository had resulted in one hydrogen gas explosion caused by sodium and potassium wastes reacting with water. At one time it was normal for workers to fire rifles into the shaft to sink polythene bags floating on water.
* Irradiated nuclear fuel particles on the seabed near the plant, estimated to be about several hundreds of thousands in number, caused by old fuel rod fragments being pumped into the sea. The beach had been closed since 1983 due to this. In 2008, a clean-up project using Geiger counter-fitted robot submarines was planned to search out and retrieve each particle individually. Particles were still being washed ashore at Sandside Bay beach and one particle at a popular tourist beach at Dunnet in 2006. In 2012, a two million becquerel particle was found at Sandside beach, twice as radioactive as any particle previously found.
* of radiologically contaminated land, and of chemically contaminated land.
* of high and medium active liquors and of unconditioned intermediate-level nuclear waste in store.
* of sodium, of which are radioactively contaminated from the Prototype Fast Reactor.

Historically, much of Dounreay&#x27;s nuclear waste management was poor. On 18 September 2006, Norman Harrison, acting chief operating officer, predicted that more problems will be encountered from old practices at the site as the decommissioning effort continues. Some parts of the plant are being entered for the first time in 50years.

In 2007, UKAEA pleaded guilty to four charges under the Radioactive Substances Act 1960 relating to activities between 1963 and 1984, one of disposing of radioactive waste at a landfill site at the plant between 1963 and 1975, and three of illegally dumping radioactive waste and releasing nuclear fuel particles into the sea, resulting in a fine of £140,000.

In 2007 a new decommissioning plan was agreed, with a schedule of 25years and a cost of £2.9billion, a year later revised to 17years at a cost of £2.6billion.

Due to the uranium and plutonium held at the site, it is considered a security risk and there is a high police presence.

In 2013, the detail design of the major project to decommission the intermediate-level waste shaft was completed, and work was to begin later in the year. The work would include the recovery and packaging of over 1,500tonnes of radioactive waste. 
, the &quot;interim end state&quot; planned date had been brought forward to 2022–2025. In March 2014, firefighters extinguished a small fire in an area used to store low-level nuclear waste.

On 7 October 2014, a fire on the PFR site led to a &quot;release of radioactivity via an unauthorised route&quot;. The Office for Nuclear Regulation (ONR) concluded that &quot;procedural non-compliances and behavioural practices&quot; led to the fire, and served an improvement notice on Dounreay Site Restoration Limited. In 2015, decommissioning staff expressed a lack of confidence in management at the plant and fear for their safety.

In 2016, the task of dismantling the PFR core commenced. Plans were also announced to move about of waste Highly Enriched Uranium to the United States.

On 7 June 2019, there was a low-level radioactive contamination incident that led to the evacuation of the site. A DSRL spokesman said: &quot;There was no risk to members of the public, no increased risk to the workforce and no release to the environment&quot;.

On 23 December 2019, the NDA announced completion of the transfer of all plutonium from Dounreay to Sellafield, where all significant UK stocks of plutonium are now held.

On 20 August 2020, a new date for the site to become available for other uses was announced of 2333, as part of a new draft strategy for reclamation.

In April 2023, Dounreay became a division of Magnox Ltd as part of a simplified operating model for the NDA group. The site licence was transferred from DSRL to Magnox Ltd, and employees at the Dounreay site were transferred from DSRL to Magnox Ltd. In October 2023, Magnox Ltd was re-branded as &#x27;Nuclear Restoration Services&#x27;, with the Dounreay division referred to as &#x27;NRS Dounreay&#x27;.

===Framework contracts===
In April 2019, DSRL awarded six framework contracts for decommissioning services at Dounreay. The total value of these contracts is estimated to be £400million.

==Vulcan Naval Reactor Testing Establishment (NRTE)==
Adjacent to the Dounreay site is Vulcan NRTE. Formerly HMS Vulcan, Vulcan NRTE is a UK Ministry of Defence (MoD) establishment operated by Rolls-Royce Submarines. The site formerly operated two separate prototype nuclear reactors, trialling five different types of submarine reactor core.

<text>Howard Ellsworth Rollins Jr. (October 17, 1950 – December 8, 1996) was an American stage, film, and television actor. He was best known for his role as Andrew Young in 1978&#x27;s &quot;King&quot;, George Haley in the 1979 miniseries &quot;&quot;, Coalhouse Walker Jr. in the 1981 film &quot;Ragtime&quot;, Captain Davenport in the 1984 film &quot;A Soldier&#x27;s Story&quot;, and as Virgil Tibbs on the NBC/CBS television crime drama &quot;In the Heat of the Night&quot; (1988–1994).

Over the span of his acting career, Rollins was nominated for an Academy Award, a Golden Globe, and an Emmy.

==Early life and education==
Born to Ruth and Howard Ellsworth Rollins Sr. on October 17, 1950, in Baltimore, Maryland, Rollins was the youngest of four children. His mother was a domestic worker and his father a steelworker who died in 1975. Rollins attended Northern High School, graduating in 1968. After his high school graduation, Rollins studied theatre at Towson University.

==Career==
In 1970, Rollins left college to play the role of &quot;Slick&quot; in the PBS soap opera &quot;Our Street&quot;. In 1974, Rollins moved to New York City, where he appeared in the Broadway productions of &quot;We Interrupt This Program&quot; (1975), &quot;The Mighty Gents&quot; (1978), and &quot;G. R. Point&quot; (1979). He also appeared in the TV miniseries &quot;King&quot; and &quot;&quot;. In 1981, Rollins made his film debut in the Dino De Laurentiis/Miloš Forman motion picture &quot;Ragtime&quot;. His performance in the film earned him an Academy Award nomination for Best Supporting Actor as well as Golden Globe nominations for Best Supporting Actor in a Motion Picture and New Star of the Year in a Motion Picture. The following year, Rollins was nominated for a Daytime Emmy for his role on &quot;Another World&quot;. In 1984, Rollins starred in director Norman Jewison&#x27;s film &quot;A Soldier&#x27;s Story&quot;, which led to his role as Virgil Tibbs on &quot;In the Heat of the Night&quot;, the television series based on Jewison&#x27;s acclaimed 1967 film of the same name.

&quot;In the Heat of the Night&quot; began airing on NBC in 1988. During the show&#x27;s run, Rollins struggled with addiction to drugs and alcohol. He was arrested four times for drug and alcohol-related crimes, spending one month in jail for reckless driving and driving under the influence. Due to his ongoing personal and legal issues, Rollins was dismissed from the series at the end of Season 6. Rollins returned for several guest appearances in the seventh season of the show in 1993 through 1994. While on the series, Rollins recorded &quot;&#x27;Twas the Night Before Christmas&quot; for the 1991 &quot;In the Heat of the Night&quot; Christmas CD, &quot;Christmas Time&#x27;s A Comin&quot;&#x27;, produced by his co-stars Randall Franks and Alan Autry. Franks wrote the musical score for the classic Christmas story that featured Rollins telling the story to children related to fellow cast members. After being fired from &quot;In the Heat of the Night&quot;, Rollins achieved sobriety and worked on rebuilding his career and reputation. In 1995, he appeared in a guest role on &quot;New York Undercover&quot;, followed by a role in the film &quot;Drunks&quot;. In 1996 (his last television acting role in his lifetime), he appeared in a guest role on &quot;Remember WENN&quot;. Rollins&#x27;s final acting role was in the 1996 television movie &quot;Harambee!&quot;.

==Personal life==
Rollins never married or had children. Rollins is a distant relative of American former MLB player Jimmy Rollins. 

===Legal issues===
In 1988, Rollins pled guilty to cocaine possession in Louisiana. In 1992 and 1993, Rollins was arrested on three occasions for driving under the influence. In 1994, he served a month in jail for reckless driving and driving under the influence. Because of his legal problems, Rollins was dropped from &quot;In the Heat of the Night&quot;. After attending drug rehab, he returned to &quot;In the Heat of the Night&quot; as a guest star.

===Death and legacy===
In the fall of 1996, Rollins was diagnosed with AIDS. Six weeks later, on December 8, Rollins died at age 46 at St. Luke&#x27;s-Roosevelt Hospital Center in New York City from lymphoma-related complications. His funeral was held on December 13 in Baltimore. Rollins was interred at Woodlawn Cemetery in his native Baltimore. On October 25, 2006, a wax statue of Rollins was unveiled at the Senator Theatre in Baltimore. The statue is now at Baltimore&#x27;s Great Blacks in Wax Museum.

<text>Walthamstow Central () is an interchange station in Walthamstow, north London. It provides Victoria line services of the London Underground, of which it is the northern terminus; and Weaver line services on the Lea Valley lines of the London Overground. Located in the London Borough of Waltham Forest, the station lies at a distance of from London Liverpool Street in Travelcard Zone 3.

The station is linked to station on the Suffragette line of the Overground by a broad footpath, Ray Dudley Way; an official out-of-station interchange is recognised between the two stations. Walthamstow Central is the closest tube station to Walthamstow Market, the longest outdoor market in Europe.

==History==

The station was opened by the Great Eastern Railway (GER) as Hoe Street in 1870 when a line was opened from to a temporary station called Shern Hall Street which was east of the Hoe Street station. The line to London, that the Chingford branch uses today was opened two years later in 1872 from Hall Farm Junction to Bethnal Green, with the branch also being extended north to Chingford in 1873.

The GER amalgamated with several other railways to create the London and North Eastern Railway at the beginning of 1923.

In 1948 the railways were nationalised and responsibility for operating the station fell to British Railways (Eastern Region).

The line was electrified in the late 1950s with electric services commencing on 12 November 1960. Early services were formed of Class 305 EMUs but initial technical problems with these saw replacements by Class 302 and Class 304 EMUs.

The station became an interchange station and the eastern terminus of the Victoria line with London Underground services starting on 1 September 1968; when the station&#x27;s present name was adopted. When originally approved in 1955, the terminus of the line was to be at Wood Street, a plan dropped in 1961 before construction of the line. The platforms for the Victoria line (like all stations on the Victoria line) are underground.

On 31 May 2015, the station&#x27;s Abellio Greater Anglia services were transferred to London Overground Rail Operations.

==Description==
===General description===
The underground station, like many stations on the Victoria line, was built to a low budget. White ceiling panels were never fixed to the ceilings above the platforms; instead the steel tunnel segments were painted black and used to support the fixtures and fittings, cutting lighting levels. A concrete stairway sits between two escalators instead of a third; this economy caused a disruptive station closure for several weeks in 2004 when both escalators went out of service.

The main entrance to the above-ground station is on the down side, opposite the bus station, which was revamped in summer 2004. Until August 2015 three staffed ticket windows opened, replaced by improved ticket machines. The entrance to the tube was revamped in early 2006. A smaller entrance is on the up line, facing a car park. Its ticket office is staffed mainly in peak hours.

===Major improvements===
A subway was built in 2005 under Selborne Road linking a new bus station with a new Victoria line ticket office. The new subway and ticket office was scheduled for spring 2005 but problems with insufficient power capacity to supply two new lifts, planning and contractual errors, delayed the opening until 19 November 2007. The lifts began operation in late 2008 and some building work took longer to finish.

Ticket barriers control access to all platforms.

A footpath link, called Ray Dudley Way, providing a shortcut to nearby , opened in August 2014.

Plans for a new entrance with step-free access to the Victoria line platforms were approved by Waltham Forest council in January 2021 to be part-funded by a redevelopment of the shopping mall.

==Services==
Trains are operated as part of the Weaver line of the London Overground.

The typical off-peak weekday service pattern is:
*4 trains per hour (tph) to London Liverpool Street;
*4 tph to Chingford.

==Connections==
London Buses routes 20, 34, 55, 58, 69, 97, 212, 215, 230, 257, 275, 357, W11, W12, W15, W19, SL1, SL2, school route 675 and night routes N26, N38 and N73 serve the station and bus station.

<text>Howell Thomas Heflin (June 19, 1921 – March 29, 2005) was an American lawyer and politician. A member of the Democratic Party, he represented Alabama in the United States Senate from 1979 to 1997.

==Early life==
Heflin was born on June 19, 1921, in Poulan, Georgia. His father Marvin Heflin was a Methodist minister, and his mother, Louise Strudwick Heflin, a former teacher. He attended public school in Alabama, graduating from Colbert County High School in Leighton. He earned his Bachelor of Arts degree in 1942 from Birmingham-Southern College in Birmingham, where he became a member of Lambda Chi Alpha fraternity. There was a tradition of politics in his family: He was a nephew of James Thomas Heflin, a prominent white supremacist politician and U.S. Senator, and great-nephew of Robert Stell Heflin, a U.S. Representative.

During World War II, from 1942 to 1946, Heflin served as an officer in the United States Marine Corps. He was awarded the Silver Star for valor in combat and received two Purple Heart medals, having seen action on Bougainville and Guam.

After World War II, Heflin attended the University of Alabama School of Law, from which he graduated in 1948. For nearly two decades, he served as a law professor, while concurrently practicing law in Tuscumbia, Alabama.

==Political career==

In 1970, Heflin was elected Chief Justice of the Alabama Supreme Court, serving from 1971 to 1977.

In 1978, Heflin was elected to the United States Senate to succeed fellow Democrat John Sparkman, who had been Adlai E. Stevenson&#x27;s running mate in the 1952 presidential election. Heflin won his party&#x27;s nomination by defeating U.S. Representative Walter Flowers of Tuscaloosa, a long-time George C. Wallace ally. The 1966 Republican gubernatorial nominee, former U.S. Representative James D. Martin of Gadsden, announced that he would challenge Heflin. But Martin switched to a second Senate race for a two-year term created by the sudden death of Senator James B. Allen, leaving Heflin without a Republican opponent.

In March 1981, President Reagan was shot during an assassination attempt by John Hinckley, Jr., outside the Hilton Hotel in Washington, D. C., Hinckley being brought to trial fourteen months afterward. Heflin espoused the view that the time between the incident and the trial was part of the need for an overhauling of the criminal justice system, &quot;so that it can more efficiently and effectively deal with the rising epidemic of violent crime in this nation&quot;, and noted the shootings of Pope John Paul II and President of Egypt Anwar Sadat as incidents that had happened after the Reagan shooting, yet had already seen the assailants be convicted and either jailed or executed. Heflin stated that the delays in bringing defendants to trial formed &quot;contempt for the system&quot;, in addition to denouncing the delays as part of the problem, calling for the Senate to form a &quot;Crime Caucus&quot;, as part of an attempt to &quot;put aside petty partisan politics and unite in an effort to wage a successful war on crime&quot;.

In July 1981, Heflin announced he would introduce legislation calling for the creation of a national court of appeals, and that such legislation would relieve the Supreme Court of some of its present burdens, while increasing the national appellate capacity. The legislation was intended to also initiate a long-range study of the federal court system, and call for major reforms in the American judiciary. Heflin noted that only 289 of the 4,242 petitions for hearings submitted to the Supreme Court in the previous year were granted, and that a national appeals court would resolve feuds in the federal circuit courts.

In 1984, Heflin won a second Senate term, handily defeating Republican former U.S. Representative Albert L. Smith, Jr., of Birmingham, who had hoped to win by running on the re-election coattails of President Ronald Reagan. Heflin was re-elected to a third term in 1990, defeating State Senator William J. Cabaniss, who later served as United States Ambassador to the Czech Republic under George W. Bush. Heflin did not run for re-election in 1996, and was succeeded by Republican Jeff Sessions.

In 1987, Heflin, a member of the Senate Judiciary Committee, voted against confirmation of Judge Robert Bork to the Supreme Court of the United States.

Heflin became chairman of the Select Committee on Ethics. While on the Ethics Committee, he led the prosecution against fellow Democratic senator Howard Cannon of Nevada for violations of Senate rules.

As a conservative Democrat, he strongly opposed abortion and gun control. Heflin supported school prayer in public schools, and opposed laws banning discrimination on the basis of sexual orientation. He supported the Gulf War of 1991, and opposed cuts in defense spending. With Fritz Hollings of South Carolina, Heflin was one of only two Democrats in the Senate to vote against the Family and Medical Leave Act. He occasionally voted with Republicans on taxes.

On other economic issues, he was more allied with his party&#x27;s populist wing. He voted against the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA), the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT), and attempts to weaken enforcement of consumer protection measures. He strongly supported affirmative action laws. He voted against confirmation of Clarence Thomas to the United States Supreme Court, citing Thomas&#x27;s lack of experience.

In 1993, Heflin gave a memorable speech on the Senate floor in support of Senator Carol Moseley Braun&#x27;s successful effort to deny renewal of a Confederate Flag design patent for the United Daughters of the Confederacy. Heflin spoke of his pride and love for his Confederate ancestors, his respect for the United Daughters of the Confederacy, and his conflict in breaking with them over this issue. But, he said:

We live in a nation that daily is trying to heal the scars that have occurred in the past. We&#x27;re trying to heal problems that still show negative and ugly aspects in our world that we live in today, and perhaps racism is one of the great scars and one of the most serious illnesses that we suffer from still today.

Heflin lived at his long-time residence in Tuscumbia until his death on March 29, 2005, of a heart attack. He was survived by his wife, Elizabeth Ann, his son H. Thomas, Jr., known as Tom, and two grandchildren.

Heflin was the last Democrat to serve as a senator from Alabama until the swearing in of Doug Jones (winner of the December 2017 special election) on January 3, 2018, 21 years to the day after Heflin left the seat. Heflin had been a mentor to Jones, who worked for him as a senatorial aide.

==Honors==
The University of Alabama School of Law has honored Heflin with the &quot;Howell Heflin Conference Room&quot; in the Bounds Law Library. Tuscumbia named a street &quot;Howell Heflin Lane&quot;, in his honor. The Howell Heflin Lock and Dam in Alabama is named in his honor. The Howell T. Heflin Seminar room in the Birmingham-Southern College Library is also named in his honor.

The &quot;New York Times&quot; characterized him as the &quot;conscience of the Senate&quot;.

<doc id="823021" wikidata="Q7358735" url="?curid=823021" title="Roger Northburgh">
<text>Roger Northburgh (died 1358) was a cleric, administrator and politician who was Bishop of Coventry and Lichfield from 1321 until his death. His was a stormy career as he was inevitably involved in many of the conflicts of his time: military, dynastic and ecclesiastical.

==Origins and education==

Northburgh was long supposed to derive his name from Norbury, Staffordshire, which was considered his birthplace. Sometimes his name has even been rendered as Norbury, as in the edition of his episcopal register by Edmund Hobhouse. However, the identification is no longer accepted as certain. Norbury is, in any case, a very common toponym: even within Northburgh&#x27;s diocese, there were several examples. Nothing definite is known of his background. He seems to have communicated in Norman French, which makes it likely, but still not certain, that he came from the landed class of French descent.

Northburgh is often said to have been educated at Cambridge University. His interest in the university around 1321 makes this plausible, but there is no direct evidence to support it. He must have acquired an adequate education in Latin to perform his ecclesiastical functions.

==Royal servant==

Northburgh appears as early as 1306–7, during the reign of Edward I, already employed in the royal wardrobe. This was the recruiting ground from which senior figures in the royal government were drawn. By 1310, under Edward II he was a wardrobe clerk on a wage of 7½d. per day. However, the wardrobe was coming under great pressure from the powerful baronial opposition, the Lords Ordainers, and its funds reducing as they sought to reduce the independent power of the monarchy. In 1311–12, Northburgh accompanied the king as he led an army to Scotland and then across northern England, while the Ordainers, dominated the south.

==Keeper of the Privy Seal==
It is unclear at exactly what point Northburgh was given custody of the Privy Seal, although he definitely held the post by 18 September 1312 and continued in office until 1316. He was not given the formal title of Keeper of the Privy Seal until 1315, apparently the first so-called, although the function had existed for some time. His keepership is regarded as decisive in constituting it as a separate office. The administrators who worked under him, although at first numbered among the wardrobe clerks, became titled &quot;clerks of the privy seal,&quot; thus constituting a separate staff for the first time.

The barons were determined to separate control of the privy seal from the court, which they saw as the source of the nation&#x27;s ills, and Northburgh seemed ready to work with them. Under the terms imposed on the king by parliament, Northburgh was compelled to work in London with his staff, separately from the rest of the Court, which kept its distance from the barons. He was in London with three clerks during the autumn of 1312 and again, with his staff enlarged to four, for the early part of 1313, and yet again, with two assistants, from February to May. During these absences, John of Reading, a clerk in the royal household forged the privy seal and a major scandal broke, tainting for a time senior members of the royal household whom he tried to implicate in his crime. However, his trial in February 1313 concluded that he was acting alone and he was hanged, despite benefit of clergy. In the summer of 1313 Northburgh was reunited with the king for a time, accompanying him on a journey to France, but was away again in the early part of 1314.
Northburgh rejoined the king for the campaign of summer 1314 in Scotland, which was hampered from the outset by lack of resources. He and the two clerks accompanying him were captured at the Battle of Bannockburn in June, along with the seal itself, and his accounts of the administration of the wardrobe were lost. Some of the king&#x27;s debts were not paid for more than twenty years, as the records were missing. The king was forced to write from Berwick-upon-Tweed to every English sheriff to warn them that the seal was no longer under his control and not to act solely on its authority. The logical problem of validating the letter itself was solved by using the seal of Queen Isabella, and this continued in use until mid-July, when a new privy seal came into use. Northburgh was probably soon at liberty again and acts issued on his initiative recommenced on 22 November. He retained the seal and was with the court intermittently in the first half of 1315, but he was given leave of absence from July to October. He became Keeper of the wardrobe from 1 February 1316, after the previous keeper, William Melton, was elected Archbishop of York. He was to hold the post until 1322.

==Ecclesiastical preferment==

Near the beginning of his political and ecclesiastical career, Northburgh is found in 1308 as a subdeacon, the lowest of the major orders of the Church, but already a rector in the Diocese of Carlisle, and securing papal permission to take a further benefice, valued at 50 marks This was perhaps the rectory in the Diocese of Exeter that he was holding in 1313, when he next received leave to hold benefices in plurality. The number extra was two, and Kingsford reports three possible candidates, all royal grants, including two in the Diocese of Lincoln.

For some years from 1315 the king made persistent efforts to equip his faithful servant Northburgh with further ecclesiastical benefices to provide a steady income in keeping with his status. Initially he tried to place Northburgh in canonries with lucrative prebends at various cathedrals. On 11 June 1315 the king granted him the prebend of Wistow in the Archdiocese of York. This was already the subject of a succession battle that had gone on for two years. The king was forced to make the grant again on 10 December, allowing Northburgh to ease out John Nassington, the victor of the earlier struggle, in the following year. On 26 July 1315 the king granted Northburgh the prebend of Farndon-cum-Balderton in the Diocese of Lincoln. This attempt proved unsuccessful as the prebend was already occupied by an absentee Italian cleric. However the grant of the prebend of Stoke, also in Lincoln Diocese, on 1 November 1315 proved more fruitful. The incumbent, possibly the same Italian cleric, proved vulnerable here, as the prebend had been declared vacant during the reign of Edward I, and he was canonically removed by the bishop on 29 July 1316.
In March 1316 papal approval was given, at the king&#x27;s request, for Northburgh to be provided to a canonry at Wells Cathedral and a long list is given of the benefices he already occupies, including two not already noted: a parish church in the Diocese of Bath and Wells and a prebend of Beverley Minster. However, the provision seems never have happened: this was a period of interregnum for the papacy and there is no subsequent mention of Northburgh among the canons of Wells. Also 1316 the king attempted to present Northburgh to the prebend of Blewbury in the Diocese of Salisbury However, the right of presentation was contested here and the subsequent series of legal challenges dragged on for ten years, leaving Northburgh empty handed. Further confusion attended the king&#x27;s presentation of Northburgh to the prebend of Piona Parva in the Diocese of Hereford in 1317. In this case the king himself unaccountably granted the position to Roger Nassington concurrently. Northburgh emerged victorious but in 1318 exchanged the prebend for that of Yatesbury in the Diocese of Salisbury, which he held until he became a bishop. Northburgh was also successfully inserted into an unidentified prebend of the Diocese of St David&#x27;s, where he is attested on 14 March 1317.

These were relatively small income streams. However, the king also briefly attempted to make Northburgh Dean of St Paul&#x27;s, with what serious hope of success is unclear. There had already been a three-year wrangle over the position, with the king initially favouring John Sandale, while the pope provided Vitalis de Testa, and Richard Newport was elected. However two contenders dropped out of the race by acquiring bishoprics: Sandale became Bishop of Winchester and Newport Bishop of London. Northburgh was imposed by royal grant at some time in early 1317, as the pope complained in May that he had illegally taken charge and requested the king to protect the interests of Vitalis. Northburgh also briefly acquired the St Paul&#x27;s prebend of Newington by royal grant on 1 January 1317. However, Vitalis emerged victorious in 1318 and Northburgh seems to have abandoned hope of an economic or power base in the capital. He settled for being Archdeacon of Richmond, a post to which he was appointed by royal grant of 29 May 1317. On 24 September of that year he made his profession of loyalty to William Melton, whose consecration as Archbishop of York had been greatly delayed, and remained in post until he became a bishop. The powerful and wealthy Archdiaconate of Richmond, dominating much of the north-west of England, was able to act in most respects as a diocese in its own right, with its own consistory court and complete control of institutions to benefices.

With his promotions, the king tried to ensure that the emoluments of previous occupants of the offices passed to Northburgh. For example, a letter under the privy seal was sent to the Abbess of Wilton ordering her to transfer a pension paid to Ralph de Stoke, previous keeper of the wardrobe, to the new man.

==Keeper of the wardrobe==

Tout saw Northburgh as part of a &quot;middle party,&quot; between the king and his most redoubtable opponent, Thomas, 2nd Earl of Lancaster, which formed during 1317-18 and attempted to win the king&#x27;s trust for the moderate, reforming baronial opposition, centred on Bartholomew de Badlesmere, 1st Baron Badlesmere and Aymer de Valence, 2nd Earl of Pembroke Davies had already expressed a similar view. The idea that there was any such party is now generally rejected, but there was certainly a considerable number of churchmen who sought to mediate the disputes. As keeper of the wardrobe, Northburgh had great responsibilities in the area of royal finances and corresponding opportunities to seek compromise reforms.

The parliament of 1318, convened on 20 October at York, came after a reconciliation between the king and Lancaster, who had dominated the political scene since Bannockburn. It was attended by Northburgh, who was claiming an allowance for conducting negotiations with the Scots. It made a serious effort to reform the royal household. An audit of Northburgh&#x27;s accounts showed that the wardrobe had recovered some of its former financial power by 1318, and an increasing proportion of its resources came from &quot;foreign&quot; sources, i.e. income streams that did not pass through the Exchequer and were not easily subject to outside scrutiny. A reform committee was set up, changes made in personnel, and a reform ordinance, prescribing much greater accountability, and closer definition of the roles of royal officials, drafted by a Northburgh, Badlesmere, Despenser and Gilbert Wigton, the controller of the wardrobe. This was accepted by the king. After this, the wardrobe seems to have run smoothly under Northburgh&#x27;s administration, with receipts and expenditure rising only in time of war, particularly the abortive expedition to reverse the capture of Berwick.

The idea that Northburgh was Chancellor of the University of Cambridge from 1321 to 1326 is now discredited, although it goes back at least as far as Henry Wharton&#x27;s 1691 compilation of episcopal biographies, Anglia Sacra. It seems to stem from his initiation of a scheme for the university to set up halls of residence for theology and philosophy students, financed by an investment in the advowsons of churches. This was given a royal licence on 5 February 1321. Nothing more came of the project.

Northburgh was recommended for preferment to the pope by the king in letters from 1318 to 1320. From 1320 to mid-1321 he was also the king&#x27;s candidate to become a cardinal. John de Stratford also claimed that this was one of the aims of his protracted mission to Avignon, from which he emerged as Bishop of Winchester in 1323. However, when the Diocese of Coventry and Lichfield became vacant late in 1321, Northburgh was not the king&#x27;s preferred candidate.

==Bishop of Coventry and Lichfield==

===Elevation to episcopacy===

Walter Langton, Bishop of Coventry and Lichfield, died on 9 November 1321 and the king issued a licence to elect the new bishop on 22 of the month. However, there was disagreement between the secular clergy of the chapter at Lichfield Cathedral and the Benedictine monks of the chapter at Coventry Cathedral, over whether they were to be equal partners in the election: a position agreed during the time of Bishop Roger Weseham (1245–56), although the dispute stretched back to the tortuous election process following the death of Geoffrey de Muschamp in 1208. The Lichfield canons decided to appeal to Pope John XXII over the issue, initiating a case that was to drag on for twelve years. The king wrote to the Pope requesting that he provide Robert Baldock, then keeper of the privy seal, to the see. The Coventry chapter, however, went ahead with the election, choosing their own prior, Henry, who is identified with Henry of Leicester by &quot;Fasti Ecclesiae&quot;.

All of these moves proved futile, as the Pope provided Northburgh to the vacant see on 14 December, apparently without reference to the other candidates, and wrote to the king, the Archbishop, the chapters, the clergy and the people of the diocese, informing them of the appointment on 19 January 1322: in May the unfortunate Baldock was promised a canonry and prebend at Salisbury Cathedral. The spring of that year was marked by the revolt of Thomas of Lancaster and the Battle of Boroughbridge on 16 March. Hence, it not surprising that Northburgh had to wait until 12 April to be invested with the temporalities.

From this point Northburgh began to take control of the diocese, although he was forced to assemble a team of deputies, as he had not yet set foot in either of the diocesan centres. He appointed Master Ralph Holbeach as his commissary-general, dealing with appointments among other matters. Holbeach was forced to act quickly, responding to recent political events. He installed in the prebend of Gaia Major William of Harlaston, a clerk of the chancery who was trusted to look after both the privy seal and the Great Seal on occasion, as John of Chelmsford, the incumbent, had been deprived for supporting Lancaster&#x27;s revolt: this was a decision Chelmsford later emerged from prison to contest. Holbeach also had to see that John of Kynardessey, a clerical client of Lancaster, was transferred to the prebend of Flixton, apparently making room for Robert Baldock in that of Eccleshall, although the details are complex and hazy, and were to lead to further disputes later.

While at Rothwell, Northamptonshire with the king, Northburgh appointed Gilbert Ó Tigernaig, the Bishop of Annaghdown (rendered in the diocesan register as &quot;Enagdun&quot;) as suffragan bishop, to carry out ordinations and other necessary episcopal functions, and Stephen Blound as seneschal. Later, from Bosworth he recommissioned Holbeach, widening his powers, and appointed as his vicar general Geoffrey of Blaston, the experienced Archdeacon of Derby. These were troubled times and there were apparently already disturbances in the diocese. A sentence of excommunication had to be read out at Eccleshall against parishioners suspected of breaking into the bishop&#x27;s deer parks, although it is unclear whether this concerned Blore, near Eccleshall, or Brewood, further south, or both, as both are mentioned. It later transpired that one of the malefactors was a cleric, Thomas de Stretton, who with his brother William, was later fined for a series of outrages: roaming with an armed gang, carrying out assaults and raiding Brewood Park to carry off game.

Northburgh was at last consecrated on 27 June at Halesowen Abbey by Thomas Cobham, the Bishop of Worcester and five other bishops. He decreed a forty-day indulgence to pilgrims who visited the Abbey&#x27;s most important relic, the head of St Barbara, so long as they also made a gift and said both the Lord&#x27;s Prayer for the king and queen and the Hail Mary in English. He made his profession of obedience to the Archbishop of Canterbury on 31 August.

===Diocesan conflicts===
Northburgh was in almost constant conflict with his Lichfield chapter. An underlying problem was that most of the senior diocesan posts, and many of the less important, were filled by papal provision, leading to high rate of absenteeism. Nearly half, 47 out of 98, of the appointments of canons in Northburgh&#x27;s episcopate were made in this way. Northburgh&#x27;s treasurers, a key role in the diocese, were both important foreign prelates. Until 1348 the post was occupied by Gaucelin Johannis Deuza of Cahors, who was cardinal priest of Santi Marcellino e Pietro al Laterano: Then came Hugh Pelegrini, a papal nuncio. Both were absentees. The problem became immediately apparent, as Northburgh&#x27;s first major decision was to conduct a thorough canonical visitation of the diocese, starting with the Archdeaconry of Stafford. The Deanery, another key post in the administration, was occupied by Stephen Segrave, who was absent at the Roman Curia, at that time based in Avignon. Northburgh&#x27;s proposal to visit the chapter itself led to a protest from Dean Segrave, who claimed exclusive rights to discipline the canons. The canons wrote to Northburgh requesting a delay because the dean was still at Avignon. However, Northburgh visited the Coventry chapter on 27 September and at Michaelmas wrote to Lichfield, rejecting the request for a delay and asserting the importance of the proposed visitation. Northburgh seems to have simply reiterated his original citation, rejected the claim of immunity and proceeded with the visitation.

Probably seeing that he would get little practical help from the chapter, Northburgh appointed William Weston as his official, assigned him the prebend of Dasset Parva, and set out on the visitation of Stafford Archdeaconry, which included the areas immediately surrounding Lichfield itself. Problems and resistance were soon encountered. The king&#x27;s invasion of Scotland had ended in an ignominious retreat and some parishes had to be exempted from visitation because their men had been called away to help resist a Scottish counter-invasion. The parishioners of Abbots Bromley refused to appear at Colton parish church and were excommunicated. At Cheswardine there were more excommunications after the bishop&#x27;s representative was assaulted. As the military situation worsened, Northburgh was summoned by the king and had to call off the visitation completely.

Northburgh&#x27;s excommunication of the Archdeacon of Chester in 1323 led to a repetition of the earlier protests, as the archdeacon was a member of the cathedral chapter. The Bishop&#x27;s steward, probably Blound, presumed to test the weights and measures used by the canons and was brought before the chapter, where Segrave abused both him and Northburgh. Segrave had been provided by the pope to become Archbishop of Armagh in 1323 but was allowed to postpone his transfer for a year. He resigned the deanery at last on 29 April 1324, when he was consecrated at Avignon. Northburgh tried to use the vacancy to take over jurisdiction, and the chapter wrote to other cathedrals with chapters of secular clergy for advice. Segrave&#x27;s replacement, Roger de Covenis, was provided by the Pope and was installed on 24 November. He too was keen to uphold the established order at the cathedral, but his commitment to the post did not last long: he exchanged it with John Garssia in 1328 for a canonry at Lleida. However, the chapter continued to defend itself against the Bishop, paying for legal representation from a common fund. By 1329 there were seven cases pending in the Court of Arches.

===Diocesan business===

The ODNB entry on Northburgh describes him as apparently &quot;efficient and conscientious&quot; as a bishop. There is evidence that he undertook further visitations in 1331, 1338 and 1378–8. He seems generally to have been supportive to serving clergy and fairly sensitive to the needs of the laity, while often firm with clerical laxity.

At St John the Baptist&#x27;s Church, Chester, a great collegiate church, Northburgh&#x27;s visitation of 1331 found the usual absenteeism by the chapter, who relied on poorly paid vicars to perform their work. He gave the vicars security of tenure, ordering that they be dismissed only with his own permission, and ordered that they be paid punctually and allowed to use the dwellings of the absentee canons, pending provision of proper common quarters. When he visited in 1348 he found that the vicars were still not being allowed to use the premises of the canons. Moreover, absenteeism and poor management had wasted resources, allowing the fabric of the building and the liturgical vestments to deteriorate alarmingly. This time he cancelled outstanding leases and capped the canons&#x27; incomes at 16 marks, earmarking the surplus for necessary work.
Language issues seem to have loomed large and Northburgh intervened in various ways to remove barriers to communication. When appointing penitentiaries for the diocese, empowered to hear confessions from all the laity and clergy of their districts, Northburgh took care to ensure that there was one to serve the Welsh language speakers – the Rector of Hanmer, near Wrexham – as well as several to work in English. He also licensed John Gilbert to start an embryonic grammar school at Oswestry. Latin was a barrier even to many clerics and religious. After visiting Farewell Priory, very close to Lichfield, in 1331, Northburgh had a good deal to say about enforcing better discipline and segregation from lay people, but was compelled to have his decrees translated from the customary Latin into Norman French to ensure there was no excuse of incomprehension for the nuns.

Northburgh carried out numerous visitations to religious houses, as well as intervening on other occasions to secure improvements in governance. In 1322 William de Bloxham, the Prior of Arbury, offered his resignation as soon as a visitation was announced, explaining that he was &quot;insufficiens ad regimen&quot;, not up to the task of leadership, as soon as Northburgh arrived in the diocese and Holbeach was deputed to hold an inquiry. Evidently Holbeach recommended acceptance of the Prior&#x27;s resignation, as shortly afterwards Northburgh was making enquiries about the competence and character of John de Borebach, the prior-elect. Later still, under 1326, Northburgh&#x27;s register has a record of the Prior being deprived, but this appears out of place: it cannot refer to Borebach, who survived in office until 1329. Hobhouse, the editor, conjectured it had been added as a model document for such occasions. Another displaced entry makes clear that provision was made for the retirement of the former prior.
John of Chetwynd, abbot of Lilleshall seems to have resigned in 1330 with a visitation in the offing. Northburgh&#x27;s register records the proposals made for his retirement by the Augustinian canons, who described Chetwynd as &quot;much beloved.&quot; His allowance was substantial and burdensome to the community: the building where he lived, including several rooms and a chapel, heating, wax for six candles during winter, a corrody equal in value to that of two canons, a servant, two grooms, a canon to act as chaplain, and a palfrey and baggage-horse, with their fodder. Allegedly to cover his clothing, he was also to receive the income from two of the abbey&#x27;s manors, Blackfordby in Leicestershire and Freasley, near Tamworth and of two of its churches. Finally his guests and family were to receive to receive reasonable hospitality at Lilleshall. An earlier visitation, probably in 1324, had reported that Chetwynd ran the abbey in a wasteful, dictatorial and unaccountable way. In fact Chetwynd had a history of criminality and violence. In 1316 he and John Ipstones, one of Staffordshire&#x27;s most turbulent landowners, had raised an armed force to rescue a highway robber who had taken a large sum of money belonging to the king and destined for Ireland. Warrants were issued for their arrest but Chetwynd escaped and went into hiding. Old habits continued and, a year after his retirement, Chetwynd fell out with his successor and raided the abbey with a gang of armed men to seize goods, necessitating a royal intervention to restore order.
Women&#x27;s houses brought criticisms, often of a similar kind. Northburgh had to intervene in the case of Elizabeth la Zouche, who, with another canoness, deserted White Ladies Priory, near Brewood, in 1326. Initially the case was simply advertised in churches. She seems not to have returned until 1331, when she had to confess before Northburgh in Brewood parish church, ask for readmission at the priory entrance and undergo penance. When he visited White Ladies in 1338, Northburgh reprimanded the prioress, Alice Harley, for financial mismanagement and extravagance, including her expenditure on clothes. He also demanded that she cease hunting with hounds.
However, Polesworth Abbey in Warwickshire seems to have had a special relationship with the Bishops, Northburgh included, through most of the 14th century and enjoyed unusual favour. One of Northburgh&#x27;s earliest measures after taking up the see was to grant extraordinary pastoral and liturgical powers to Maud, the abbess-elect. In September 1327 the Pope wrote to the Bishop of Hereford asking him to intervene and secure justice between the rector of Eyton in Shropshire and the abbess of Polesworth. Northburgh had forced Thomas, the rector, to swear to pay the abbess two thirds of his income as a pension before allowing him to be inducted. On taking up the post, Thomas found the remaining third of the revenue insufficient to support him. The Pope had already intervened, ordering members of the Lichfield chapter to annul the oath: Richard Bernard, the Archdeacon of Salop, William de Bosco, the Chancellor, and Gilbert de Bruer, prebendary of Wolvey. He had also ordered the abbess to take the matter no further. However, she had got judgement against Thomas in the secular courts, claiming that the pension was a charge on the rectory instituted by Walter Langton, Northburgh&#x27;s predecessor. Moreover, the Chancellor and Bruer had delegated their powers to Roger le Mareschall, the prebendary of Dernford, and he and Bernard refused to take the matter further. Once Thomas appealed to the Pope, the abbess had deprived him of his rectory and given it to William de Ipstones. Nothing more is reported of the case. When Northburgh visited the abbey in 1352 he found little to remark upon. He had his injunctions delivered in French, as was now the custom with women&#x27;s houses.
Northburgh also attracted papal criticism for refusing to deal with a consanguinity case. In February 1331 he and Stephen Gravesend, the Bishop of London, were ordered by John XXII to summon witnesses to London to investigate the case of John de Bohun, 5th Earl of Hereford, and Margaret Bassett, of a prominent Staffordshire family. The couple had discovered after their marriage that they were related to the fourth degree. They were at that time living apart. However, a papal letter three years later makes clear that Northburgh refused to act. The pope was forced to relaunch the enquiry, nominating canons from London and Lincoln to replace Northburgh on the panel. The reasons for Northburgh&#x27;s inaction are not made clear. He certainly had no principled objection to giving dispensations for cousin marriage: he had ratified a papal dispensation in exactly the same circumstances in the interim. A political grudge might offer an explanation: John de Bohun&#x27;s father, Humphrey de Bohun, 4th Earl of Hereford, had been one of the moderate ordainers but was provoked by personal conflict with Hugh Despenser the Younger into revolt alongside Lancaster, and was killed at Boroughbridge.

The Black Death struck in 1348 and must have created enormous spiritual and practical challenges for the diocese. However, Northburgh&#x27;s register mostly reflects this only indirectly. One definite reference occurs when a recent pestilence is mentioned when dealing with the need to consecrate a chapel yard at Didsbury for burials in 1352.

==Later political career==

===Régime change===
Northburgh remained in favour with Edward II, through the difficulties of his final years. In 1323, he was sent, with others, to sequestrate the property of John de Stratford: Stratford&#x27;s papal provision to the see of Winchester had displeased the king, who had once again tried to place Baldock in the post. As late as February 1326 Northburgh was ordered to give aid to the commissions of array raising troops in his diocese.

However, Northburgh made a smooth transition to the new régime, and on 13 and 20 January 1327 took the Guildhall oaths, pledging support for the privileges of the City of London and for Queen Isabella and the young Edward III. His attitude to the dominance of the Roger Mortimer, 1st Earl of March, the Marcher Lord who effectively ruled in partnership with the queen, is not known. However, he was made Treasurer on 2 March 1328, although he left the post on 20 May of the same year. He was one of several Treasurers who served for only very short periods because they moved to other work. In his case, this was an embassy to France, which set out in May. It is possible that he never actually took over the functions of Treasurer, as his predecessor, Henry Burghersh, was still acting in the post until at least late April, possibly July. Northburgh accompanied Adam Orleton, then Bishop of Worcester, arriving in Paris at the end of May, to press the claims of Edward III to the French throne after the death of his uncle, Charles IV of France. They were too late and Philip of Valois was crowned. This was a prelude to the outbreak of the Hundred Years&#x27; War.

Northburgh remained politically active after Edward III took control of his own realm in 1330. He attended the Parliament of 1333 and was one of a group of bishops and nobles appointed to discuss royal activities. On 2 March, probably of 1334, he was with the king at York and was a witness to a privy seal writ freeing the merchants of Coventry of the obligation to pay a range of tolls. The City of London&#x27;s corporation duly noted the document and agreed the Coventry merchants should no longer pay murage, the toll intended to pay for the city&#x27;s fortifications. Northburgh&#x27;s prominence among the witnesses may suggest he had been an advocate for the merchants of his own diocese. When the king moved to assert his claim to the French throne in 1337, Northburgh was active in supporting the venture. He attended an assembly at Stamford in May to discuss financing the war, including the imposition of a royal wool monopoly. In August the king sent out writs to sheriffs and bishops ordering that assemblies of clergy and laity be held in each county to hear his case for the war against the king of France. Northburgh&#x27;s summonses to the assemblies are recorded in his register. The following month he held a great diocesan assembly of clergy and a simultaneous assembly of Staffordshire laity at Stafford. Each archdeaconry appointed a specific monastery and its head to act as collectors for the tax on clergy, while the laity also voted a grant. A later assembly of merchants agreed a levy on wealthy townsmen.

===Treasurer===

As the war went on, Northburgh was drawn further into government and into a developing constitutional crisis. On 11 June 1340 he was appointed by letters patent as commissioner, with three others, to requisition ships in the Port of London and elsewhere and fit them out for war, in readiness for assembling them as a fleet on the River Orwell. He was again appointed Treasurer on 21 June. His efforts on the king&#x27;s behalf were handsomely rewarded by a grant of £200 on 6 July. As Treasurer, he was part of an administration dominated, in the absence of the king, by John de Stratford, now Archbishop of Canterbury, and containing several other Stratford family members. Northburgh seems to have been a welcome addition to the administration, a veteran administrator who shared many of Stratford&#x27;s values and attitudes.
However, the king was becoming increasingly irritated by delays and deficiencies in the resources reaching him during his campaigns in Flanders and this came to a head while he was at Ghent in October and November 1340. He detached himself by agreement from his allies, sent a delegation to Pope Benedict II to express his feelings about Stratford, and embarked at Sluys. He arrived by surprise with a coterie of mainly military men, of whom William de Bohun, 1st Earl of Northampton, a brother of the Earl of Hereford, was the most prominent. He then carried out a coup against his own administration, removing and in some cases arresting, judges and officials whom he identified with Stratford&#x27;s rule. Northburgh was called to the Tower of London on 1 December, together with Robert de Stratford, the Archbishop&#x27;s brother, Bishop of Chichester and Chancellor of the Exchequer. Both were summarily dismissed, although neither was arrested. John de Stratford escaped to Canterbury Cathedral, from which he continued to preach and to denounce royal intrusions on ecclesiastical privilege. Northburgh and both Stratfords arrived at the parliament convened on 23 April 1341, armed with a safe conduct and determined to take up their seats. They were prevented for a week by two members of the royal household: Ralph de Stafford, 1st Earl of Stafford, the steward, and John Darcy, 1st Baron Darcy de Knayth, the chamberlain. They persisted and were strongly supported by John de Warenne, 7th Earl of Surrey, and his nephew, Richard FitzAlan, 10th Earl of Arundel. Their opponents finally withdrew and the king allowed all three bishops to attend. There was then a formal reconciliation but this was effectively the end of Northburgh&#x27;s participation in national politics.

==Death==

Northburgh died in office on 22 November 1358.

<text>Blackhorse Road is an interchange station, located at the junction of Blackhorse Road/Blackhorse Lane with Forest Road in Walthamstow, London for London Underground and London Overground services.

It is on the Victoria line of the London Underground and is the penultimate station on the eastern end of that line. Above ground, the station is on the Suffragette line of the London Overground, from (measured via Kentish Town and Mortimer Street Junction).
It is in Travelcard Zone 3. It is also the closest railway station to Walthamstow Wetlands.

Ticket barriers control access to all platforms. Passengers using Oyster cards are required to tap on a yellow Oyster card reader at ticket gates when entering and leaving the station and - to be charged a lower fare - suggested to also tap on a pink Oyster card reader if transferring between the two lines.

==History==
The station was opened by the Tottenham and Forest Gate Railway on 9 July 1894, and was originally situated east of Blackhorse Road. Its opening changed the local area from a gentrified London suburb to industrial, with several works and units opening around Ferry Lane to the northwest.

The Victoria line station opened on 1 September 1968, across the road from the mainline station. It was planned as a simple two-platform station, and was the only station on the line with any new structures above ground level. The surface line station was re-sited by British Rail on 14 December 1981, to provide better interchange with the Underground station.

==The station today==

===Structure===
The station contains two underground platforms for the Victoria line and two for the London Overground. Owing to budget restraints at the time of construction, the Underground station, like many stations on the Victoria line, was never completely finished to the standard of other lines. White ceiling panels were never fixed to the ceilings above the platforms; instead the steel tunnel segments were painted black and used to support the fixtures and fittings. This has had a detrimental effect on the lighting levels.

===Artwork===

There are two distinct works of art at the station, both depicting black horses, in reference to the station&#x27;s name. One is in the form of a tile motif depicting a black horse on a white cameo against a light blue background, identical to the Victoria line&#x27;s colour. It was designed by Hans Unger, who also did the tile motif at Seven Sisters tube station. The other is a mural of a black horse outside the station&#x27;s entrance, by David McFall.

==Services==
During peak periods, trains run approximately every two minutes on the Victoria line (up to 33 trains per hour) in both directions.

The typical off-peak service for the Suffragette line of the London Overground in trains per hour (tph) is:
*4 tph westbound to 
*4 tph eastbound to 

From June 2016 until February 2017, services on the route were suspended whilst it was electrified; this project involved lowering track in several places, rebuilding bridges and lengthening platforms as well as installing overhead wires. A replacement bus service was in operation for the duration of the closure period.

==Connections==
London Bus routes 123, 158, 230, W11 and night route N73 serve the station.

<text>Seven Sisters is an interchange station in the Seven Sisters area of the London Borough of Haringey, North London. It is on the Victoria line of the London Underground and the Weaver line on the Lea Valley lines of the London Overground. The station is walk away from South Tottenham station on the Suffragette line of the Overground, forming an official out-of-station interchange.

The station is in Travelcard Zone 3 and has two entrances/exits: one on Tottenham High Road, and the other on Seven Sisters Road. It is the closest tube station to the Tottenham Hotspur Stadium. On the Victoria line, the station is between Finsbury Park and Tottenham Hale stations. On the Weaver line, it is between Stamford Hill and Bruce Grove stations.

==History==
The station was constructed by the Great Eastern Railway (GER) on its Stoke Newington &amp; Edmonton Railway line and opened on 22 July 1872. On 1 January 1878, the GER opened a branch line, the Palace Gates Line, from Seven Sisters station to Noel Park and later that year to Palace Gates (Wood Green) station.

The Palace Gates Line was closed by British Rail in 1963 for passengers and 1964 for freight, with the branch line track and platforms at Seven Sisters later removed.

On 24 July 1967, planning permission was granted to convert the station for London Underground use. The first section of the Victoria line opened on 1 September 1968, serving Seven Sisters, although a shared entrance and interchange facilities with the surface station were not opened until December 1968. The original GER entrance to the station was situated in West Green Road at the north end of the surface station, but the new combined entrance was opened in Seven Sisters Road at the south end on the site of a former wood merchants yard, connecting to the west end of the Victoria line platforms. The original (1872) entrance was closed at that time.
The National Rail platforms are not at street level. Platform 1 (towards London Liverpool Street) is accessed by twin staircases. Platform 2 (towards Enfield Town &amp; Cheshunt) has a staircase and an &quot;up&quot; escalator.

A second entrance at the east end includes the main Victoria line ticket hall, and is accessed via subways on each side of High Road just north of the junction with Seven Sisters Road. There are three Victoria line platforms at Seven Sisters: with one platform reserved for services which terminate at the station to return to the depot or reverse back into central London, although a connection is available for trains to continue to Walthamstow Central.

The distance between Seven Sisters and Finsbury Park stations on the Victoria line is making it the longest distance between adjacent stations in deep level tunnels on the London Underground network. During the planning phase of the Victoria line, thought was given to converting Manor House into a Victoria line station and diverting the Piccadilly line in new tunnels directly from Finsbury Park to Turnpike Lane via Harringay Green Lanes, but the idea was abandoned because of the inconvenience this would cause, as well as the cost.

On 31 May 2015, the station and most National Rail services that call here transferred from Abellio Greater Anglia to London Overground.

During summer 2015, there was no Victoria line service between Seven Sisters and Walthamstow Central to facilitate works outside of Walthamstow Central station which would boost capacity along the line.

As part of the May 2023 timetable change, all Greater Anglia services were withdrawn from this station.

<doc id="823053" wikidata="Q1526395" url="?curid=823053" title="Poplar DLR station">
<text>Poplar is a Docklands Light Railway (DLR) station in Poplar in London, England. Poplar is a cross-platform interchange station for three of the six lines on the DLR (-, Bank- and Tower Gateway-) making it one of the busiest stations on the network in terms of services. It is also nearby the Canary Wharf Station on Crossrail&#x27;s Elizabeth Line.

==History==
Long before the opening of the DLR in 1987, there had been three stations with the name Poplar. However, none was on the site of the current station.
*Poplar railway station was on the London and Blackwall Railway between 8 July 1840 to 4 May 1926. This is near the site of Blackwall DLR station.
*Poplar (East India Dock Road) railway station on the North London Railway was in use from 1866 until 1944. This is now the site of All Saints DLR station.
* A third station named Poplar was constructed in 1851 but never opened. This was sited due south of the North London Railway station (now All Saints DLR), and due east of the present DLR depot.

Poplar DLR station was opened on 21 August 1987, served only by the Stratford-Island Gardens branch of the DLR. The station opened with 4 platforms served by 3 tracks similar to Canary Wharf, and was accessed via an underpass. As the DLR was expanded eastwards the station was remodelled with a new overbridge, the island platforms narrowed to serve 4 rather than 3 tracks, and extended to take two-car operation. On 28 March 1994 Poplar became the western terminus of the new Beckton branch, which opened the same day; on 31 July 1995, the line was extended west, joining Poplar with Westferry via a flying junction and enabling Beckton services to run to Tower Gateway. Bank to King George V (later Woolwich Arsenal) services through the station commenced on 2 December 2005.

A trial as is part of Mayor of London Draft Transport Strategy called Adopt a Station&#x27; took place in 2018, which aims to encourage the use of public transport with space at the station will be given over to help publicise community events, classes, and workshops. It will also provide a platform for schools and groups to showcase art and it is hoped the scheme will make travelling through the station a more pleasant experience.

==Location==
Poplar serves a junction in four directions:
*Eastbound towards Beckton and Woolwich Arsenal (next station Blackwall)
*Northbound towards Stratford (next station All Saints)
*Southbound towards the Isle of Dogs and Lewisham (next station West India Quay)
*Westbound towards Bank and Tower Gateway (next station Westferry).

Poplar DLR depot is situated north of the station, and is accessed through a pair of tracks just east of Poplar. These feature the tightest curves in operation on the railway.

==Services==
The typical off-peak service in trains per hour from Poplar is:
* 6 tph to Tower Gateway
* 6 tph to Bank
* 12 tph to 
* 6 tph to Beckton
* 6 tph to 
* 12 tph to Canary Wharf

During the peak hours, the services to Bank, Tower Gateway, Beckton and Woolwich Arsenal are increased up to 8 tph. In addition, the services to Stratford and Canary Wharf are increased up to 16 tph, with up to 8 tph during the peak hours extended beyond Canary Wharf to and from .



==Connections==
===London Buses===
While no bus routes directly serve the station presently, routes 15 and 115, prefix route D6 and night routes N15 and N551 do provide an indirect link to the station eastbound via Hale Street at &quot;Poplar Recreation Ground/Poplar Station&quot; bus stop on East India Dock Road A13.

===Elizabeth Line===
As part of the construction of the Elizabeth line, Canary Wharf railway station was built and opened in 2022. This enables interchange between DLR and Elizabeth line services.

<doc id="823061" wikidata="Q2818209" url="?curid=823061" title="704 Hauser">
<text>704 Hauser is an American sitcom television series and a spin-off of &quot;All in the Family&quot; (the final of several) that aired on CBS from April 11 to May 9, 1994. The series is built around the concept of a black family, the Cumberbatch Family, moving into the former Queens home of Archie Bunker after Bunker had sold the house located at 704 Hauser Street.

==Overview==

Norman Lear created the series during the time when conservative talk radio was experiencing its initial upswing in popularity in the United States, particularly in the form of Rush Limbaugh. Lear felt that the time was right for a new show to explore new issues, making &quot;704 Hauser&quot; even more explicitly political than &quot;All in the Family&quot;.
John Amos, a veteran of the earlier Lear sitcom &quot;Good Times&quot; (itself a spin-off of the &quot;All in the Family&quot; spin-off &quot;Maude&quot;), starred as Ernie Cumberbatch, while Lynnie Godfrey played his wife, Rose. The show features a reversal of the original &quot;All in the Family&quot; formula. Ernie and Rose Cumberbatch are working class Democrats, while their son Goodie is a conservative activist and his girlfriend, Cherlyn Markowitz (Maura Tierney), is white and Jewish.

The show attracted middling ratings, and was cancelled after five episodes (with one episode remaining unaired).

==Cast==
* John Amos as Ernie Cumberbatch
* Lynnie Godfrey as Rose Cumberbatch
* T.E. Russell as Thurgood Marshall &#x27;Goodie&#x27; Cumberbatch
* Maura Tierney as Cherlyn Markowitz

Casey Siemaszko plays Joey Stivic, Archie&#x27;s grandson, in the first episode. CBS anchor Bob Schieffer appears in the first episode as himself.

==List of episodes==
==Home media==
The pilot episode, &quot;Meet the Cumberbatchs&quot;, was included as a bonus feature on the &quot;All in the Family: The Complete Series&quot; DVD box set released by Shout! Factory on October 30, 2012.

<text>All the Year Round was a British weekly literary magazine founded and owned by Charles Dickens, published between 1859 and 1895 throughout the United Kingdom. Edited by Dickens, it was the direct successor to his previous publication &quot;Household Words&quot;, abandoned due to differences with his former publisher.

It hosted the serialisation of many prominent novels, including Dickens&#x27;s own &quot;A Tale of Two Cities&quot;. After Dickens&#x27;s death in 1870, it was owned and edited by his eldest son Charles Dickens Jr., and a quarter-share was owned by the editor and journalist William Henry Wills.

==History==
===1859–1870===
In 1859, Charles Dickens was the editor of his magazine &quot;Household Words&quot;, published by Bradbury and Evans; their refusal to publish Dickens&#x27; defensive &quot;personal statement&quot; on his divorce in their other publication, &quot;Punch&quot;, led Dickens to create a new weekly magazine that he would own and control entirely.

In 1859, Dickens founded &quot;All the Year Round&quot;, taking William Henry Wills with him from &quot;Household Words&quot; as part-owner and sub-editor. As with his previous magazine, the author searched for a title that could be derived from a Shakespearean quotation. He found it on 28 January 1859 (in &quot;Othello&quot;, act one, scene three, lines 128–129), to be displayed before the title:

The new weekly magazine had its debut issue on Saturday 30 April 1859, featuring the first instalment of Dickens&#x27;s &quot;A Tale of Two Cities&quot;. The launch was an immediate success.

One month after the launch, Dickens won a lawsuit in the Court of Chancery against his former publisher Bradbury and Evans, giving him back the trade name of his previous journal. On Saturday 28 May 1859, five weeks after the launch of &quot;All the Year Round&quot;, Dickens terminated &quot;Household Words&quot;, publishing its last issue with a prospectus for his new journal and the announcement that, &quot;After the appearance of the present concluding Number of &quot;Household Words&quot;, this publication will merge into the new weekly publication, &quot;All the Year Round&quot;, and the title, &quot;Household Words&quot;, will form a part of the title-page of &quot;All the Year Round&quot;.&quot; &quot;AYR&quot;″s full title then acquired a fourth item: &quot;All the Year Round. A Weekly Journal. Conducted by Charles Dickens. With Which Is Incorporated Household Words.&quot;

&quot;All the Year Round&quot; contained the same mixture of fiction and non-fiction as &quot;Household Words&quot; but with a greater emphasis on literary matters and less on journalism. Nearly 11 per cent of the non-fiction articles in &quot;All the Year Round&quot; dealt with some aspect of international affairs or cultures, discounting the American Civil War, which Dickens instructed his staff to avoid unless they had specifically cleared a topic with him first. Old tales of crime (especially with a French or Italian setting), new developments in science (including the theories of Charles Darwin), lives and struggles of inventors, tales of exploration and adventure in distant parts, and examples of self-help among humble folk, are among the topics which found a ready welcome from Dickens.

After 1863, although Dickens continued to micromanage the editorial department, scrupulously revising copy, his own contributions fell off considerably, largely because he spent more and more time on the road with his public readings.

A few weeks before 28 November 1868, Dickens announced a new series for &quot;All the Year Round&quot;: &quot;I beg to announce to the readers of this Journal, that on the completion of the Twentieth Volume on the Twenty-eighth of November, in the present year, I shall commence an entirely New Series of &quot;All the Year Round&quot;. The change is not only due to the convenience of the public (with which a set of such books, extending beyond twenty large volumes, would be quite incompatible), but is also resolved upon for the purpose of effecting some desirable improvements in respect of type, paper, and size of page, which could not otherwise be made.&quot;

===1870–1895===
After hiring him as the subeditor of the magazine a year earlier, Dickens bequeathed &quot;All the Year Round&quot; to his eldest son Charles Dickens, Jr. (&quot;Charles Dickens the younger&quot; in the testament) one week before his death in June 1870.
After Dickens&#x27;s death, his son would own and edit the magazine from 25 June 1870 until the end of 1895 (or possibly just until 1888).

In 1889, the magazine started a &quot;Third series&quot;. It is unclear how much Dickens Jr. was involved with the new series, but a number of stories were contributed by Mary Dickens.

In 1895, &quot;All the Year Round&quot; ended. It had its last issue on 30 March 1895, after three series.

==Series==

Each volume was 26 numbers long, half a year (thus Vol. 1 was Nos 1 to 26, Vol. 2 was Nos 27 to 52, Vol. 3 was Nos 53 to 78, but the annuals and seasonal extras counted for additional numbers.)
# &quot;First Series&quot;: Vol. 1 (30 April 1859) to Vol. 20 (28 November 1868)
# &quot;New Series&quot; : Vol. 1 (5 December 1868) to Vol. 43 (29 December 1888)
# &quot;Third Series&quot;: Vol. 1 (5 January 1889) to Vol. 13 (30 March 1895)

==Collaborative works==

Dickens collaborated with other staff writers on a number of Christmas stories and plays for seasonal issues of the magazine, including:
*&quot;The Haunted House&quot; in the Extra Christmas Number (13 December 1859) with Wilkie Collins, Elizabeth Gaskell, Adelaide Anne Procter, George Augustus Henry Sala, and Hesba Stretton.
*&quot;A Message from the Sea&quot; in the Extra Christmas Number (13 December 1860) with Wilkie Collins, Henry F. Chorley, Charles Allston Collins, Amelia Edwards, and Harriet Parr.
*&quot;Tom Tiddler&#x27;s Ground&quot; in the Extra Christmas Number (12 December 1861) with Wilkie Collins, John Harwood, Charles Collins, and Amelia Edwards.
*&quot;Somebody&#x27;s Luggage&quot; (1862).
*&quot;Mrs. Lirriper&#x27;s Lodgings&quot; in the Extra Christmas Number (12 December 1863) with Elizabeth Gaskell, Charles Lever, Amelia Edwards, Charles Allston Collins, &amp; Edmund H. Yates.
*&quot;Mrs. Lirriper&#x27;s Legacy&quot; in the Extra Christmas Number (1 December 1864) with Charles Allston Collins, Rosa Mulholland, Henry Spicer, Amelia Edwards, &amp; Hesba Stretton.
*&quot;Doctor Marigold&#x27;s Prescriptions&quot; in the Extra Christmas Number (12 December 1865). The most famous story in &quot;Doctor Marigold&#x27;s Prescriptions&quot; is one of Dickens&#x27;s own contributions, &quot;The Trial for Murder&quot; (aka &quot;To Be Taken with a Grain of Salt&quot;).
*&quot;Mugby Junction&quot; in the Extra Christmas Number (12 December 1866) which includes a masterpiece of short fiction, &quot;The Signal-Man&quot; (aka &quot;No. 1 Branch Line: The Signalman&quot;).
*&quot;No Thoroughfare&quot; in the Extra Christmas Number (12 December 1867) with Wilkie Collins.

Staff writers included:
* Henry Morley – informative though rather congested articles on historical, political, economic and literary topics, including the background to the American Civil War
* Charles Allston Collins (younger brother of Wilkie Collins and son-in-law to Dickens) – reportage and articles on art and architecture, marked by a distinctive vein of melancholy humour. He wrote as &#x27;David Fudge&#x27; and &#x27;Our Eye-Witness&#x27;
* Eliza Lynn Linton

Most articles were printed without naming their author; only the editor, &quot;Conducted by Charles Dickens&quot;, was mentioned on the first page and the head of every other page. While a complete key to who wrote what and for how much in &quot;Household Words&quot; was compiled in 1973 by Anne Lohrli (using an analysis of the office account book maintained by Dickens&#x27;s subeditor, W. H. Wills), unfortunately the account book for &quot;All the Year Round&quot; has not survived. Ella Ann Oppenlander has attempted to provide something comparable in a 1984 book not easily procured, but only manages to identify less than a third of the contributors: &quot;Dickens&#x27; All the Year Round: Descriptive Index and Contributor List&quot;. In July 2015 antiquarian bookseller and Dickens scholar Jeremy Parrott announced at a conference in Belgium that he had discovered Dickens&#x27;s own annotated set of &quot;All the Year Round&quot;, naming all the contributors. A full guide to the magazine is now in progress and should be published in 2018.

Noted anonymous articles include:
* 1861 – &quot;The Morrill Tariff&quot;, 28 December 1861 (cited in the Morrill Tariff article)
* 1871 – &quot;Vampyres and Ghouls&quot; (aka &quot;Vampires and Ghouls&quot;), 20 May 1871, pp. 597–600 (later collected in: Gilbert, William (2005). &quot;The Last Lords of Gardonal&quot;. Dead Letter Press)

<doc id="823073" wikidata="Q5347665" url="?curid=823073" title="Egale Canada">
<text>Egale Canada is a Canadian charity founded in 1986 by Les McAfee to advance equality for Canadian lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender (LGBTQ) people and their families, across Canada.

The organization&#x27;s current executive director is former Toronto politician Helen Kennedy. Past executive directors have included Gilles Marchildon, John Fisher and Kaj Hasselriis. Helen Kennedy is the first woman to head the organization.

Egale is Canada&#x27;s equivalent of the US&#x27; Human Rights Campaign and the UK&#x27;s Stonewall. 

== History == 
Founded in 1986 by political activist Les McAfee, Egale Canada was incorporated as a federal not-for-profit organization in 1995, with a focus on education, advocacy, litigation and expert consultation.

The organization was initially named &quot;Equality for Gays and Lesbians Everywhere&quot;. As they extended their efforts to include bisexual and transgender issues, they felt that the acronym was not inclusive enough, and therefore changed the name from the acronym E.G.A.L.E. to simply &quot;Egale&quot; (&quot;égale&quot; being the French word for &quot;equal&quot;) in 2001. Egale Canada&#x27;s partner organization, Egale Canada Human Rights Trust (ECHRT), was founded in 1995 as a charity dedicated to advancing LGBT human rights through education, research and community engagement.

==Focus areas==
Egale Canada&#x27;s work falls under four pillars: Research, Education, Awareness and Legal Advocacy. 
== Research ==
=== Inclusive Schools === 
In 2007 Egale commissioned a survey of 3,700 high school students from across Canada in order to gain data on the situation of LGBT students in Canadian schools and gain insight into the level of homophobia and transphobia in schools. The final report, entitled Every Class in Every School, was released in 2011.[8] A decade later in 2021, Egale released a follow-up report -Still In Every Class In Every School.

=== Healthcare and Seniors ===
The early 2020s saw Egale release several research studies surrounding the experiences of 2SLGBTQI people in healthcare, mental healthcare, dementia, long-term care, retirement and more. These reports include:
* Healthcare access experiences and needs among LBQ women, trans, and nonbinary people in Canada: A research report 
* Aging and Living Well Among LGBTQI Older Adults in Canada: Findings from a National Study 
* Queering Mental Health Supports in Canada: A Research Report 
* Fostering Dialogues: An arts-based action research project imagining futures of community-based care with homecare personal support workers and LGBTQ older adults 
* Coming Out and Coming In to Living with Dementia: Enhancing Support for 2SLGBTQI People Living with Dementia and their Primary Unpaid Carers 

=== Employment ===
Egale&#x27;s 2023 report Working for Change: Understanding the Employment Experiences of Two Spirit, Trans, and Nonbinary People in Canada, examines the challenges Two Spirit, trans, and nonbinary People individuals face in employment, underemployment, and unemployment. The report explores workplace experiences, barriers to employment, and instances of discrimination and bias. While the findings reveal that there is still much progress to be made to achieve employment equity for 2STNB people, we also found that some participants encountered supportive and inclusive workplaces—offering hope for the future.

== Education ==
Egale Canada specialize in three areas of education, training and learning: inclusive schools, training teachers and educators on creating schools more inclusive for 2SLGBTQI students; workplace inclusion, training corporate teams on creating inclusive places of employment; and international, working with partners around the world to deliver inclusion education.

== Awareness == 

=== Awareness Campaigns ===
Egale launches multiple awareness campaigns every year that touch on various topics involving the LGBTQ community. In recent years these campaigns have included LGBT occasions of significance such as Trans Day of Visibility, Pride Season, Intersex Awareness Week and more. 

They also create campaigns around specific topics such as their 2024 award-winning campaign Help Us Remain which focused on raising awareness about the experiences of LGBT people living with dementia.

== Legal Advocacy ==
=== Human Rights and Anti-2SLGBTQI Hate ===

Egale successfully lobbied the federal government to add &quot;sexual orientation&quot; to the Canadian Human Rights Act to protect lesbians, gays and bisexuals from discrimination; lent support to many provincial and territorial efforts to have equal rights enshrined in legislation across the country; lobbied the Government to introduce more severe penalties for those convicted of gay-bashing and other hate crimes; supported the addition of &quot;sexual orientation&quot; to the grounds covered by hate propaganda legislation; intervened in the Nixon case to support the rights of transgender people.

=== Intersex Genital Mutilation ===
In Canada, it is currently legal to perform genital &quot;normalizing&quot; surgery on intersex infants and children who are too young to understand or provide consent. These surgeries are invasive, unnecessary, and irreversible, representing a profound violation of the bodily autonomy and dignity of intersex individuals.

In 2021, Egale, alongside intersex scholars and activists Morgan Holmes and Janik Bastien-Charlebois, filed an application with the Ontario Superior Court of Justice to challenge the constitutionality of Criminal Code exemptions that allow intersex genital mutilation to remain legal. This case is known as Egale et al. v. Canada.

=== 2SLGBTQI Youth === 
Promoting safe and inclusive school environments for 2SLGBTQI students is one of Egale’s core initiatives, achieved through the creation of resources and educational materials. However, this work is hindered when laws and policies prevent school staff from upholding gender-diverse students&#x27; rights to equality, safety, privacy, and self-determination. Some notable cases that Egale has been involved in include: CCLA v. New Brunswick, UR Pride v. Government of Saskatchewan et al., York Region District School Board v. Elementary Teachers’ Federation of Ontario, and A.B. v. C.D.

=== Relationship Recognition ===
Egale successfully lobbied for the introduction and passage of Bill C-23, which amended 68 federal statutes to provide same-sex couples with the same legal status as that of opposite-sex married couples. They also supported union activities and lobbied the federal government in support of equal employment benefits to those in same-sex relationships; coordinated coalitions of equality groups in cases on same-sex pension benefits and equal funeral leave for same-sex families.

Additionally, they have on two occasions challenged the legal definition of the word &quot;spouse.&quot; The first instance was when the group intervened before the Supreme Court of Canada to challenge the opposite-sex definition of &quot;spouse&quot; in the Old Age Security Act (Egan v. Canada). Although the challenge was unsuccessful, it did set a unanimous precedent by which sexual orientation was henceforth entered into the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms as a grounds for protection from discrimination. The second challenge was successful, and revised the opposite-sex definition of &quot;spouse&quot; in Ontario&#x27;s Family Law Act (M. v. H.) so that the right to common-law marriage extended to same-sex couples.

They also helped convince Statistics Canada to include same-sex families in the nationwide census, and worked with LEGIT to advance equal immigration rights for gays and lesbians.

=== Representation, Visibility and Media === 

Egale intervened to support efforts to have LGBT pride officially proclaimed in many cities; supported community initiatives in response to the Calgary bathhouse raids; decried the heavy-handed censorship practices of Canada Customs and helped Little Sisters Bookstore win their court case. Egale has also supported freedom of speech for people with anti-gay points of view, including Albertan pastor Stephen Boissoin, who was found guilty by the Alberta Human Rights Commission of exposing gays to hatred.[6] Part of the ruling was financial compensation paid to Egale as requested by the complainant Darren Lund (who is not homosexual), but Egale refused to accept the money.[7]

In 2023, Egale published an open letter to the CTRC calling for the removal of the conservative news channel Fox News from the list of non-Canadian programming authorized for distribution in Canada, following Fox News host Tucker Carlson&#x27;s comments after a mass shooting in Nashville that &quot;the trans movement is targeting Christians, including with violence.&quot;

== Funding ==
Egale&#x27;s operations and activities have been funded by a range of government agencies, corporations, non-profit organizations and individual donors. Notable funders include:

==Controversies==

===Immigration issue===
Egale blamed the Conservative government for allegedly failing to help gay immigrants from countries that have anti-gay laws, such as Iran, Iraq, Malaysia, Jordan, Mexico and Nicaragua. As of 2017, 72 countries still criminalize LGBTQ activity.

===Bill C-2===
In 2005, the organization was criticized by some of Canada&#x27;s gay press for failing to submit a brief, after indicating an intention to do so, to the Canadian House of Commons Standing Committee on Justice and Human Rights regarding the potential impact on LGBT communities of Bill C-2, a controversial piece of legislation that revised the age of sexual consent. &quot;Xtra!&quot; asserted that Egale was devoting so much time and effort to advocacy around same-sex marriage that it was missing the boat on other important issues.

===Leadership Award===
In 2009, Egale Canada presented Jaime Watt, a political strategist in the government of former Premier of Ontario Mike Harris, with its inaugural Leadership Award in honour of his role in supporting the provincial law that granted common-law marriage rights to same-sex couples. The decision was denounced by some LGBT activists because of Watt&#x27;s role in some other government policies that had been unpopular within the gay community.

<text>Metfield is a village and civil parish in the Mid Suffolk district, in Suffolk, England, but its name is derived from Medefeld or &#x27;Meadow feld&#x27; (see &quot;Concise Oxford Dictionary of English Place Names&quot;). It is situated close to the border with Norfolk, being approximately 5 miles south east of Harleston and 7 miles north west of Halesworth. The population was estimated to be 370 in 1996, increasing to 388 at the 2011 Census.

==History==
The parish was part of the historic Hoxne Hundred.

The parish church is the 13th-century church of St. John the Baptist, which was extensively remodelled in the 15th century. St. John the Baptist has a sister parish in Medfield, Massachusetts in the United States, the Church of the Advent. The town is named after Metfield.

In 1885 a provisional order reallocated part of the neighbouring parish of Withersdale to Metfield resulting in the parish encompassing 2,338 acres. In 1901 the population was recorded as 437.

The Village has had no public house since 2007, when the only pub, The Duke William, closed. In May 2013 the pub re-opened as a successful Tea Room. During early 2014, the Tea Rooms expanded into a Bed and Breakfast along with a shop. Currently (2021) only B&amp;B is available. 

During World War II an airfield was built just outside Metfield for use by the USAAF 491st Bomb Group and the 353d Fighter Group. On 15 July 1944 a bomb dump blew up, detonating over 1,000 tons of bombs and explosive, killing five men and wrecking five B-24 bombers.

The local economy is mainly agricultural with some light industry.

The village now has its own website at metfieldsuffolk.com .

In November 2017, local author Christine Brennan published her book &quot;METFIELD Tales From a Suffolk Village 1928–2017&quot;.

Nearby villages include Cratfield.

<doc id="823124" wikidata="Q897590" url="?curid=823124" title="One Night Only (Bee Gees album)">
<text>One Night Only is a live album and DVD/Blu-ray by the Bee Gees. It features the group&#x27;s concert at the MGM Grand in Las Vegas on November 14, 1997 and includes many of their greatest hits.

The CD is edited, with some songs omitted, though the DVD version of the concert is complete. The album was reissued in 1999, and included a bonus CD with the missing songs. The CD and DVD cover features the band replicating their iconic &quot;Saturday Night Fever&quot; pose. The concert was re-released on SD Blu-ray by Eagle Rock Entertainment in 2013. The re-release provides superior audio quality than what is possible on DVD, but video is only marginally improved (the standard-definition video is now up-scaled to 1080i).

The Bee Gees performed songs from every decade from the 1960s to the &#x27;90s. They also sang a tribute song to their late brother Andy Gibb, &quot;(Our Love) Don&#x27;t Throw It All Away&quot;. During this song old footage of Andy is shown, including him singing the second verse of the song. The vocals from the original recording also play during that section. Céline Dion guest-starred on the Bee Gees-penned &quot;Immortality&quot;. Recorded vocals by Frankie Valli are featured during &quot;Grease&quot;, and are also taken from the original song.

The album&#x27;s title was originally meant to reflect the band&#x27;s plan that the Las Vegas concert would be their final live performance ever. Barry Gibb&#x27;s arthritis in his back had worsened to the point where it seemed it would be impossible for him to continue playing. He nonetheless wanted to expand the tour, so they played several more shows, holding one every two weeks so that Barry would be able to recover from his injury.

<text>Thomas Charlton (died 11 January 1344) was Bishop of Hereford, Lord High Treasurer of England, Lord Privy Seal, and Lord Chancellor of Ireland. He is buried in Hereford Cathedral in Hereford, Herefordshire, England.

==Family==

Charlton was born near Wellington, Shropshire, younger son of Robert de Charleton of Apley, a small landowner. Thomas&#x27; eldest brother was John Charleton, 1st Baron Cherleton, who became a statesman of some importance. Both brothers were in the household of Edward II, and Thomas received numerous ecclesiastical preferments.

The executors of his will were: Alan Cherleton, knight, John Cherleton, junior, knight; William de Sheynton, Richard de Sydenhale, Henry Shipton, Adam Esger and Alan Venyse. 

==Appointments==

Charlton was Lord Privy Seal from 1316 to 1320.

Charlton was nominated to be Bishop of Hereford on 25 September 1327 and consecrated on 18 October 1327.

==In Ireland==

In 1337 his brother John was appointed Justiciar of Ireland, and Thomas accompanied him to Ireland as Lord Chancellor. He was charged by the English Crown to inquire into the perceived inadequacy and corruption of the Irish courts of common law and was authorised to remove the Irish judges and appoint English replacements. His mission does not seem to have been a success, as most of the existing judges, notably the notoriously corrupt Simon Fitz-Richard, the Chief Justice of the Irish Common Pleas, fought off all attempts to replace them. John resigned as justiciar in 1338, following a dispute, and Thomas moved from the Chancellorship to the position of custos rotulorum for Ireland.

Charlton was also Lord High Treasurer from 2 July 1328 until 16 September 1329.

<text>The Belgrade Fortress (, Hungarian: Nándorfehérvár), consists of the old citadel (Upper and Lower Town) and Kalemegdan Park (Large and Little Kalemegdan) on the confluence of the Sava and Danube rivers, in an urban area of modern Belgrade, Serbia. Located in Belgrade&#x27;s municipality of Stari Grad, the fortress constitutes the specific historical core of the city. As one of the most important representatives of Belgrade&#x27;s cultural heritage, it was originally protected right after World War II, among the first officially declared cultural monuments in Serbia. The fortress was declared a Monument of Culture of Exceptional Importance in 1979, and is protected by the Republic of Serbia. It is the most visited tourist attraction in Belgrade, with Skadarlija being the second. Since the admission is free, it is estimated that the total number of visitors (foreign, domestic, citizens of Belgrade) is over 2 million yearly.

== Location ==
Belgrade Fortress is located on top of the high ending ridge of the Šumadija geological bar. The sandbank stretches at least from the city&#x27;s Tašmajdan section, originating from the Miocene period, and the oldest stages of the ancient Pannonian Sea. The cliff-like ridge overlooks the Great War Island () and the confluence of the Sava river into the Danube, and makes one of the most beautiful natural lookouts in Belgrade. It borders the neighborhoods of Dorćol (north and north-east), Stari Grad (east) and Kosančićev Venac (Savamala; south). It is bounded by 3 streets: &quot;Boulevard of Vojvoda Bojović&quot;, &quot;Tadeuša Košćuška&quot;, &quot;Pariska&quot;, plus the railway along the riverside.

== History ==
=== Classical Antiquity ===

Belgrade Fortress is the core and the oldest section of the urban area of Belgrade. For centuries, the city population was concentrated only within the walls of the fortress, and thus the history of the fortress, until most recent times, reflects the history of Belgrade itself (see: Timeline of Belgrade history). The first mention of the city is when it was founded in the 3rd century BC as &quot;Singidunum&quot; by the Celtic tribe of Scordisci, who had defeated Thracian and Dacian tribes that previously lived in and around the fort. The city-fortress was later conquered by the Romans, was known as Singidunum and became a part of &quot;the military frontier&quot;, where the Roman Empire bordered &quot;barbarian Central Europe&quot;. Singidunum was defended by the Roman legion IV Flaviae, which built a fortified camp on a hill at the confluence of the Danube and the Sava rivers. In the period between 378 AD and 441 the Roman camp was repeatedly destroyed in the invasions by the Goths and the Huns. Legend says that Attila&#x27;s grave lies at the confluence of the Sava and the Danube (under the fortress). In 476 Belgrade again became the border between the empires: the Western Roman Empire and Eastern Roman Empire (Byzantine Empire), and the Slav-Avar State in the north.

The Celtic fortification was a primitive one, located on top of Terazije ridge, above the confluence of the Sava into the Danube, where the fortress still stands today. Celts also lived in small, open and fortified settlements around the fort, called &quot;oppida&quot;. Since it is not known for sure where the Celtic fort was; some historians suggest that it was rather close to the necropolises in Karaburma and Rospi Ćuprija. Celtic settlements belonged to the La Tène culture.

The original military camp was probably occupied by the soldiers from the Legio VIII Augusta from 46 AD to 69. Early Singidunum reached its height with the arrival of Legio IV &quot;Flavia Felix&quot; which was transferred to the city in 86 AD and remained there until the mid 5th century. The presence of Legio IV prompted the construction of a square-shaped &quot;castrum&quot; (fort), which occupied Upper Town of today&#x27;s fortress. Construction began at the turn of the 2nd century AD as since the early 100s, Legio IV &quot;Flavia Felix&quot; became permanently stationed in Singidunum. At first, the fortress was set up as earthen bulwarks and wooden palisades, but soon after, it was fortified with stone as the first stone fort in Belgrade&#x27;s history. The remains can be seen today near the northeastern corner of the acropolis. The legion also constructed a pontoon bridge over the Sava, connecting Singidunum with Taurunum.

Rectangular castrum covered what is today the Upper Town and the Kalemegdan Park. The castrum had tall walls, built from the white Tašmajdan limestone and spread over the area of to , being shaped as an irregular rectangle (approximately ).
=== Middle Ages ===
The Byzantine Emperor Justinian I rebuilt the fortress around 535. In the following centuries the fortress suffered continuous destruction under the Avar sieges. The Slavs (Serbs) and Avars had their &quot;state union&quot; north of Belgrade with the Serbs and other Slavic tribes finally settling in the Belgrade area as well as the regions west and south of Belgrade in the beginning of the 7th century. The name Belgrade (or &quot;Beograd&quot; in Serbian), which, not just in Serbian but in most Slavic languages, means a &quot;white town&quot; or a &quot;white fortress&quot;, was first mentioned in AD 878 by Bulgarians. The fortress kept changing its masters: Bulgaria during three centuries, and then the Byzantines and then again Bulgarians. The fortress remained a Byzantine stronghold until the 12th century when it fell in the hands of the newly emerging Serbian state. It became a border city of the Serbian Kingdom, later Empire with Hungary. The Hungarian king Béla I gave the fortress to Serbia in the 11th century as a wedding gift (his son married the Serbian princess Jelena), but it remained effectively part of Hungary, except for the period 1282–1319.
After the Serbian state collapsed following the Battle of Kosovo, Belgrade was chosen as the capital of Despot Stefan Lazarević in 1402. Major work was done to the ramparts which were encircling a big thriving town. The lower town at the banks of the Danube was the main urban center with a new built Orthodox cathedral. The upper town with its castle was defending the city from inland. Becoming a major trade and cultural center, Belgrade became a significant immigration town, with immigrants settling from other parts of Serbia, Dubrovnik, Bulgaria, Hungary, Germany, Italy and Venetia. Population blossomed, so the lower city of the fortress, which was the busiest part of the city, had to be significantly expanded.

Belgrade remained in Serbian hands for almost a century. After the Despot&#x27;s death in 1427, it had to be returned to Hungary. An attempt by the Ottoman Sultan Mehmed II in 1456 to conquer the fortress was prevented by Janos Hunyadi (Siege of Belgrade), saving Hungary from Ottoman dominion for 70 years.

=== Early Modern ===

In 1521, 132 years after the Battle of Kosovo, the fortress, like most parts of the Serbian state, was conquered by the Turks and remained (with short periods of the Austrian and Serbian occupation), under the rule of the Ottoman Empire until the year 1867, when the Turks withdrew from Belgrade and Serbia. During the short period of Austrian rule (1718–1738), the fortress was largely rebuilt and modernized. It witnessed the Great Serbian Migration in the 17th century and two Serbian Uprisings in the 19th century, during the Turkish Period.
During the Austrian occupation of northern Serbia 1717–39, several hospitals were established in Belgrade. The City hospital of Saint John was built within the fortress walls, but its exact location is not known. Emperor Charles VI signed the Belgrade City Statute in 1724 (&quot;Proclamation on organizing German Belgrade&quot;), which mentions city hospital, city pharmacy, medics and midwives. The German municipality had low incomes so it had to ask the state for help and beneficence. The hospital is mentioned in the 1728 Census. It was a hospital already in 1719, later becoming the residence of Thomas Berger, the head of the hospital. After his death, his daughter continued to reside in the building. The hospital (&quot;Stattspital&quot;) was moved to another location, into the newly constructed building in 1724. A small church was built next to it. This new hospital was quite small, with only 2 rooms, a kitchen and a basement, so it way not be the same city hospital.

Lazaret or a quarantine hospital is not mentioned in the documents, but it is safe to presume that it had to be formed during the viral outbreaks, as was usual in the time. The procedure in case of outbreaks was probably analog to the existing procedure in Buda, the capital of Hungary. Today unidentified disease ravaged Belgrade in 1730. Viral epidemic killed a lot of people. During the course of only two weeks, just the Jesuits buried 220 people and themselves lost 3 missionaries. The extremely massive plague outbreak hit the city in October 1738. As the Austrian army retreated in front of the advancing Turks, numerous civilians fled to the fortress, many of them being contagious. Having so many people in a cramped space, triage was not possible so the plague spread quickly. There are reports of the dead lying in the streets for days as there was no one to bury them. The Austrian garrison was decimated and the corpses of the soldiers who died of plague were burned with their personal properties.
After Austria lost the Austro-Turkish War of 1737–1739, northern Serbia, including Belgrade, was returned to the Turks. One of the provisions of the 1739 Treaty of Belgrade stated that Austria had to demolish all the fortifications and military and civilian building it had constructed during the occupation. Many Baroque buildings were demolished within the fortress. However, Austria didn&#x27;t demolish the buildings outside of the fortress walls. That way, the House at 10 Cara Dušana Street, built 1724–1727, in the neighborhood of Dorćol survived, being today the oldest house in Belgrade.

The 1837 plague outbreak almost brought to the war between the ruling prince Miloš Obrenović and the Ottomans in the fortress. The outbreak began in Ottoman Empire in 1836, which had no medical protocols of any kind at the time, and prince Miloš blocked the borders immediately imposing the mandatory quarantine. A group of plague infected Ottoman &quot;nizams&quot; on the way to Belgrade was halted at the border in Aleksinac and placed in the quarantine, but majority of them fled and continued to Belgrade, spreading the plague on its path (Ražanj, Paraćin, Jagodina, Ćićevac) and ultimately reaching the fortress in the spring of 1837. The prince ordered full and strong siege of the fortress by the Serbian guardsmen, cutting the fortress off completely for six weeks. The pasha complained and threatened from inside the fortress, initially hiding and denying the disease, but the fortress Ottomans were reluctant to start military skirmish in this condition. The besieging was successful as the plague never spread to Belgrade.

Four outer city gates, with the adjoining walls and ramparts were demolished from 1862 (Sava, Vidin and Varoš gates) to 1866 (Stambol Gate). After the Ottomans fully evacuated the inner fortress in 1867, Serbian troops took over, but as the state was still only autonomous (full independence was achieved in 1878), Serbia was only to &quot;manage it&quot; and was not acknowledged as the proprietor of the fortress by the neighboring Austria-Hungary. First squad of Serbian soldiers, under the command of colonel Svetozar Garašanin, ceremonially replaced the Ottoman guardsmen on 18 April 1867. First action by the Serbian authorities, just 5 days after the Ottomans left in April 1867, was to rebuild the Ružica Church.

After the Ottoman withdrawal, newspapers in Austro-Hungary continuously published stories, backed by the military experts, that the fortress became strategically obsolete and that, having no value of any kind, Austrian army could destroy it in 24 hours. In the autumn of 1867 citizens were awaken by the heavy artillery fire. Ruling prince Mihailo Obrenović sent two batteries to the fortress (where modern Monument of Gratitude to France is) and ordered them to fire at the fortress wall where the old wooden bridge was located. A barrage fire of 300 salvos from De Bange cannons shelled the fortress during the entire day. It remained unclear why the prince ordered this: he decided to demolish the fortress completely, as such stories spread among the citizens; he wanted to show to the Austrians that the fortress has its values and importance, and that it can&#x27;t be destroyed in a day (despite all the shelling, only of rampart was destroyed); or he simply did it to spite the Austrians. The shelling also disturbed the citizens of Zemun, across the Sava, which was part of Austro-Hungary at the time, and some of the grenades which missed the target hit Austro-Hungarian soil, so the imperial government sent an official diplomatic note to Serbia, protesting the shelling and reminding the prince he is only a &quot;caretaker&quot; of the fortress.

After the takeover of the fortress, Serbian forces kept finding parts of the gallows, chains, gibbets and impalement stakes in the dungeons, used previously by the Ottomans to torture the prisoners. Official reports by the Serbian army hold claims by the soldiers of the &quot;ghoulish, headless and limbless wraiths&quot; and other abominations roaming the fortress. The army issued an order that, despite there was no enemy anymore, all guards must keep watch &quot;at least in pairs&quot;. Mihailo&#x27;s successor, prince and later king Milan Obrenović, ordered the leveling of the terrain in the eastern sections of the fortress and planting of the greenery and trees, which in time developed into the Kalemegdan Park.

=== Modern ===

After the Third Hatt-i sharif of 1833, issued by the Ottoman sultan Mahmud II, number of Turks remaining to live in Belgrade was limited to 6,000, including women and children, and a strong Turkish garrison. Only Turks were allowed to live in the Upper Town, while both Turks and Serbs were allowed to live in the Lower Town. The gates were guarded by the Turkish sentries, except when prince Miloš was visiting the Lower Town, when they were replaced with Serbian policemen. There were two administrators, one Turkish and one Serbian. The Turkish administrator had jurisdiction only over the Turkish population, but in the Turkish-Serbian matters, Serbian judge was presiding. In the mid-1830s there were 3,000 houses in the Lower Town of which 2,500 were owned by the Turks who rented them to the Serbs.

Later, while it was inhabited, the fortress formed one of the quarters in the administrative division of Belgrade. It was called &quot;Grad&quot; (&quot;city&quot;) for administrative purposes and continued to be translated in the foreign languages as &quot;fortress&quot;. According to the censuses, it had a population of 2,219 in 1890, 2,281 in 1895, 2,777 in 1900, 2,396 in 1905 and 454 in 1910.

Kalemegdan was the location of the second airport in Serbia, after one in the neighborhood of Banjica from 1910. A field in the Donji Grad was adapted for planes in January 1911. It was situated along the bank of the Sava river, from the old Turkish bath (modern Planetarium) to the mouth of the Sava into the Danube. One of the flight pioneers, Edvard Rusjan, died in an airplane crash after taking off from this field and being hit by the gust of &quot;košava&quot; on 9 January 1911. Remains of Rusjan&#x27;s plane were originally exhibited in Donji Grad and his funeral was one of the largest recorded in Belgrade. Surviving rib of this airplane became the first exhibit in the predecessor of the modern Aeronautical Museum Belgrade. Today, the area is used by the parachutists and paragliders and as the location of the air shows for sports and ultra-light aviation. In June 2021 it was announced that the memorial bench dedicated to Rusjan will be placed below the fortress and that surrounding green area will be named the Edvard Rusjan Park.

The fortress and the park were damaged during World War I. Serbian army had no proper weaponry to fight the Austro-Hungarian gunboats, so they freely fired at the city from the Sava. The city was especially damaged during the heavy bombardment in 1914–1915. Diplomat and author described it in 1914: &quot;Kalemegdan is &quot;trimmed&quot;, the trees in the park are battered, the ancient ramparts of Singidunum crushed, all being hit by the heavy, modern artillery, from precisely measured distance and even more precisely unmeasured hatred&quot;. Heavy fighting occurred in the Lower Town in 1915, when Serbian forces, led by major Dragutin Gavrilović, persistently but ultimately unsuccessfully, fought the invading Austro-Hungarian army. Before full occupation, Austro-Hungarian army temporarily entered Belgrade, from 3 to 14 December 1914. Already on 4 December they erected gallows in fortress&#x27; Upper Town, and on several other locations around the town, for hanging civilians.

In 1928, building company &quot;Šumadija&quot; proposed the construction of the cable car, which they called &quot;air tram&quot;. The project was planned to connect Zemun to Belgrade Fortress, via Great War Island. The interval of the cabins was set at 2 minutes and the entire route was supposed to last 5 minutes. The project was never realized, but the idea of the cable car was revived in the 21st century. Funiculars were also planned, to connect the Upper and the Lower Town. The entire Lower town was planned for demolition, with the plans including large amusement park, museums, artificial lake, zoo, and stadiums instead of the existing military barracks. Instead of everything, the railway was conducted around the foothills of the fortress, encircling it completely, and effectively cutting it off from the Sava river, which wasn&#x27;t universally accepted among the architects and urbanists of the day.

During his visit to the 1936 Berlin Olympics, Yugoslav prime minister Milan Stojadinović was fascinated by the objects built for the games, especially by the grandiose
Olympic Stadium. He instigated the Yugoslav Olympic Committee to nominate Belgrade as the host of the 1948 Olympics and invited Werner March, architect of the Berlin stadium, to visit Belgrade and design objects for the games. March came to Belgrade in May 1938 and suggested the Fortress&#x27; Lower Town as the location for the Olympic complex. Without architectural design competition or bidding, Stojadinović&#x27;s government accepted his idea and gave him carte blanche regarding the design. The project was finished in 1939 and the architectural model was exhibited in October 1940 at the &quot;Exhibition of the new German architecture&quot; in the German pavilion at the Belgrade Fair.

In the early 1940, March began the preparatory works, as he also planned the partial remodeling of the fortress outside of the sports complex, too. He incited archaeological survey and invited German architectural historian Daniel Krencker to study the excavations. Within the scopes of the Nazi expansion of the megaprojects, and augmentation of the German historic role and importance in this region, Krencker praised March&#x27;s project as the &quot;artistic dream, which represents rare and major German cultural act which will contribute to the old German glory of Belgrade&quot;. Just few days after German scientists left the fortress, Germany attacked Yugoslavia on 6 April 1941. The Olympic complex was pushed aside, shifting the focus of the Germans to the archaeological exploration of the fortress during the war.

The fortress suffered further damage during World War II. Military Museum was damaged in the April 1941 bombing, and subsequently looted. It was immediately placed under the authority of the German Military Museums Chief, repaired, and reopened for public in July 1941. After almost two millennia of continuous sieges, battles and conquests, the fortress is today known as the Belgrade Fortress. The present name of Kalemegdan Park derives from two Turkish words, &quot;kale&quot; (fortress) and &quot;meydan&quot; (field), literally meaning &quot;fortress field&quot;.

After World War II, before skiing facilities were built on the mountains further from Belgrade, the slopes of Kalemegdan (so as of Banovo Brdo, Košutnjak and Avala), were used by Belgraders for skiing. Also, immediately after the war, some parts of the fortress were closed for public. In some parts the new, Yugoslav People&#x27;s Army was stationed, while others were closed because of the ammunition left behind.

In 2018 it was announced that the entire riverbanks section from the Branko&#x27;s Bridge on the Sava, to the Pančevo Bridge on the Danube, will be transformed into the linear park, patterned after the High Line park in New York City and Zaryadye Park in Moscow. It would encircle the Belgrade Fortress. In April 2019 it was announced that the park will stretch for , covering an area of . In August 2021, city expanded the project to , but only will actually make the green corridor, while the rest will be privately owned residential buildings, commercial venues and sports fields. This caused negative comments from experts. New design would actually push people away from the river, to walk along the present boulevard which encircles the fortress. The fortress itself will end up being additionally degraded and devalued, so architects and archaeologists suggested surveys, explorations and conservation of the fortress&#x27; foothills instead. The park project was described as a smokescreen, with the actual purpose of selling the riverbanks to the private investors and elevating the real estate prices.

In 2022, new city administration headed by mayor Aleksandar Šapić included in the city&#x27;s urban plan relocation of the Belgrade Zoo out of the fortress. In February 2023, Šapić announced relocation to the Ada Safari section of Ada Ciganlija island. City manager, Miroslav Čučković, explained the relocation: &quot;Since the foundation of the new city administration...we made decisions which are connected to our dedication to spaces to which Belgraders were coming close to in all of these previous years. Those are spaces for which we think should have some new type of content and possibility to directly invest into them&quot;. Šapić added that the &quot;political decision was made to handle this&quot;, and, if everything goes by the plan, the relocation might be finished in three years.

Public and experts&#x27; backlash against the project was massive, mostly regarding hastiness, arbitration, irrelevance, legality and selected location. Public speculated that the residents of the newly built affluent K-Distrikt residential complex across the zoo are bothered by the smell, or that some more lucrative structures might be built instead of the zoo on such exceptional location, since &quot;direct investments&quot; were given as one of the reasons. Šapić then retreated a bit, stating this is just a &quot;political idea&quot; which is not hastily made, that only now analyses and surveys will be done to check the viability, that nothing will be built instead of the zoo but the fortress will be conserved instead, and that there is no set time frame for the project.

== Archaeology ==
=== World War II ===
Already in April 1941, professor and major was appointed to the Referat for the Protection of the Cultural Values in Serbia. He saved numerous cultural objects in Serbia, which won him praise even from some Serbian historians after the war. On 20 October 1941 the Lower Town was fenced on his orders of keeping and protecting the fortress. He also began archaeological digging. However, the right to dig in the fortress was asked from both the pseudo-scientific organization Ahnenerbe and the Main Work Group Southeast of the Reichsleiter Rosenberg Taskforce. Pressured financially and politically, von Reiswitz felt he must side with one of them, so he arranged the participation of Ahnenerbe with organization&#x27;s head Walther Wüst in October 1941. Based on this, collaborationist Minister for Education and Religion Velibor Jonić issued the &quot;permit on monopoly&quot; to Ahnenerbe&#x27;s Secretary General Wolfram Sievers in February 1942.

Austrian prehistorian was selected to conduct the survey, but he was killed in May 1942 near Kharkiv, Ukraine, before reaching Belgrade. He was replaced with Wilhelm Unverzagt, director of the Berlin&#x27;s Museum for Prehistory and Early History. Joined by Sievers and Herbert Jankuhn, Heinrich Himmler&#x27;s close associate, Unverzagt began targeted digging, searching for the material proof to confirm the German idea of transforming Belgrade into Prinzeugenstadt. He specifically searched for the monumental gate at the entry into the Lower Town, built during the Nicolas Doxat&#x27;s rebuilding of Belgrade under the orders of Prince Eugene of Savoy in the 1720s and 1730s. The gate was named after the Holy Roman Emperor from that period, Charlies VI. Already on 15 July 1941, secretary in the Reich Ministry of the Interior Wilhelm Stuckart sent memo, asking for Belgrade to be transformed into the &quot;Reich&#x27;s Fortress&quot;. It was to be connected military with the copper and gold Bor mines and the Danube&#x27;s Iron Gates gorge, to create the Banat area protection zone. This zone was intended to become Eugenia, or Prinz Eugen&#x27;s District, where Danube Swabians were to settle and expand.

The digging lasted through 1942 and 1943, when it was stopped after the Allied bombing of Belgrade began. By 1943, the Germans completely rebuilt the Gate of Charles VI, in greatest detail. Reconstruction included the cartouche with the initials of the emperor on the capital from the outer side, and the supposed coat-of-arms of never-existing Tribalia, on the inner side (boar with an arrow pierced through the head). As the motif of this coat-of-arms appeared in medieval Serbian seals and was adopted as part of the Serbian coat-of-arms after First Serbian Uprising in 1804, it was meant to show the incorporation of Serbia into the western empire. The gate was damaged already during the heavy Allied Easter bombing in April 1944.

It is not known whether Ahnenerbe was searching for something specifically or just wanted to falsify the route by which Aryans reached Germany from the Middle East. Some surviving documents show that they discovered remains of Celtic and Gothic settlements, a trench from the Roman period and relics from the Austrian rule after the conquest of Eugene of Savoy. Some sources claim that after the bombing started, documentation and part of the artifacts were transported to Lebus, in Germany and are considered to be lost. Others claim that the entire material was stored in the Belgrade City Museum. What is known for sure is that during the &quot;terrain cleaning&quot; in 1941–1942, the Germans completely destroyed the foundations of the Austrian artillery barrack built in the 1723-1736 period.

=== Post war ===

On 29 February 1952 the city adopted the &quot;Decision on protection, adaptation and maintenance of the people&#x27;s park of Kalemegdan&quot; which set the borders of the protected areas as the rivers of Danube and Sava and the streets of Tadeuša Košćuškog and Pariska. In 1962, Belgrade&#x27;s Institute for the cultural monuments protection expanded the zone to several blocks across the streets. Detailed plan on Kalemegdan from 1965 provided that, despite the immense archaeological value that lies beneath the fortress ground, basically only what was discovered by that time can be explored, restored or protected. That caused the problem both for the expansion of the park but even more for the further exploration of the fortress&#x27; underground. Best example is the Lower Town where neither the park fully developed nor the remains of the former port, which was located there, are visible.

The area of the fortress is . By 2000, only 5% of that area was archaeologically surveyed, and by 2010 that number rose to 12% or . Based on the findings so far, it is estimated that during the rule of despot Stefan Lazarević in the first half of the 15th century, when Belgrade became capital of Serbia, the city within the fortress had 5,600 to 12,000 inhabitants. Archaeological examinations were done on the following locations:

* Upper Town in the inner fortress; surveyed 1948–2009; found remains belong to the Prehistory, Antiquity, Middle Ages and Turkish-Austrian period
* waterfront rampart in Lower Town 1963–2010; Middle Ages and Turkish-Austrian period
* Kalemegdan Park 1973–2010; antiquity, Middle Ages and Turkish-Austrian period
* Belgrade Zoo 1988; antiquity, Middle Ages and Turkish-Austrian period

In September 1969 major discoveries were announced. The appearance of the Lower Town was almost completely changed after the excavation. The medieval cobblestone was uncovered, so as the old ramparts and gates. In the process, the Lower Town was made more accessible to the visitors, including the new stairway and reconstruction of the part of the medieval rampart. In the Upper Town, four large, massive pillars from the period of despot Stefan Lazarević (15th century) were discovered. They are remains of the medieval bridge which was located in front of the main entry into the inner fort of the city. The fort was surrounded by the deep trench. It was previously known that an inner, bascule bridge existed within the fortress, which survived until the 17th century, but its exact location and type of construction were unknown.

The explored sections after 2000 include the access downhill path to the Small Staircase in Kalemegdan Park, the bastion on the Sava slope, the gates of King, Sava, Dark and Karađorđe, the Great Ravelin, etc. During the 2017 reconstruction of the Mehmed Paša Sokolović&#x27;s Fountain, next to Defterdar&#x27;s Gate in the Gornji Grad, several archaeological discoveries were made. Remnants of the Roman castrum, two urns from the Bronze Age and remains of the Neolithic object were discovered. The findings were conserved and reburied.

== Features ==

Belgrade Fortress is generally divided into four sections. The four sections, two of which make the fortress itself (Donji and Gornji Grad) and two make Kalemegdan park today, were divided by the Tsarigrad Road, on the location of modern pedestrian path next to the Cvijeta Zuzorić Art Pavilion.

=== Lower Town ===

Donji Grad (Доњи Град); occupies the slope towards the riversides, from the top spot (ridge where &quot;The Victor&quot; is). Between the lowest section and the Danube is Kula Nebojša (&quot;Impregnable, Fearless, or Daredevil Tower&quot;), which has been turned into a museum of the Greek revolutionary Rigas Feraios, who was strangled by the Turks in this tower and his corpse thrown into the Danube. Donji Grad, like the neighboring Savamala, frequently suffers from flooding, and Kula Nebojša suffered extensive damage during the major floods of 2006. The Orthodox churches of &quot;Ružica&quot; (former Austrian gun depot) and &quot;Sveta Petka&quot; are also located in this area, as is the Belgrade Planetarium.

The modern church of Sveta Petka was projected by architect Momir Korunović. Construction began in the first half of the 1930s, on the location of an old chapel. It was consecrated on 27 October 1937, the feast day of Parascheva of the Balkans, called Petka in Serbian.

During the tenure of mayor Dragan Đilas (2008–13), the idea of expanding the zoo to Donji Grad, which it occupied prior to the World War II, resurfaced, but the experts were against it. The urban plan for the fortress from 1965 already projected the complete relocation of the zoo outside of the fortress, to some suburban locations, which in later plans included Veliko Blato, Stepin Lug or Jelezovac. The expansion of the zoo would cut the pedestrian communication between the Danube&#x27;s and Sava&#x27;s parts of the fortress, which was already cut in 1949 but was restored in 2009 with the reconstruction and opening of the Sava Gate. Also, it would prevent the exploration of Donji Grad, which is still largely unexplored and leave the Gate of Charles VI, a masterpiece of Balthasar Neumann, within the zoo itself. As of 2017, the zoo was not relocated but the idea of expansion was dropped, too.

Apart from the protection of the fortress as the cultural monument, parts of the Lower Town, and the slope which separates it from the Upper Town are protected as a natural monument. The area was included in the first protection of the fortress in 1946. In 1968 two areas were separately protected: &quot;Maritime Neogenic Ridge - profile under the Pobednik monument in Kalemegdan&quot; and &quot;Geological-geographical layers at Kalemegdan locality, at the Pobednik monument&quot;. Serbian Environmental Agency drafted a study on the area and submitted it to the government in 2017. In February 2021, the government joined two previously protected area and expanded the protected area to , establishing a natural monument of Kalemegdan Sandbank. The area is a unique geological feature in Serbia, as the remains of the sea ridge of the oldest stage in the history of the Pannonian Sea. Those include sediments originating from the middle, Badenian stage of the Miocene period. The cliffs are thought to have a historical importance also - the Slavic name of Belgrade, white town, according to one of the theories, originates from the exposed white layers of Miocene limestone on top of which the city was built.

==== Church of the Dormition of the Most Holy Mother of God ====

The Church of the Dormition of the Most Holy Mother of God, which also served as the cathedral church, was built sometimes in the 12th century, during the restored Byzantine rule. The church contained a miraculous icon of the Mother of God. It is recorded that the Byzantine princess and Serbian queen Simonida worshiped the icon in 1315 when she visited Belgrade. The structure itself was a large, three-nave church with a large dome. As Belgrade was generally neglected in the second half of the 14th century, the church also deteriorated a lot.

When the Hungarians handed over the city to Serbian despot Stefan Lazarević, he began massive reconstruction of the fortress, including the church, which was restored and expanded. Chronicler Constantine the Philosopher described the church, including the famed icon of the Mother of God, relics of Saint Petka and Saint Empress Theophano (relocated to Belgrade after the fall of Bulgaria to the Ottomans), icons of the Twelve apostles (six on both sides), and the reliquary containing a hand. Despot added the choirs and the monastery complex around it. The church became the seat of the Metropolitan of Belgrade, this time of the Serbian Orthodox Church, and he was proclaimed the &quot;exarch of all Serbian lands&quot;.

Over two decades later, when Belgrade was returned to the Hungarians, the building of the Metropolitan&#x27;s Seat was built next to it. On the very day the Ottomans conquered Belgrade, 29 August 1521, they turned the church into the mosque. The cross was removed from the top of the roof, the icons were painted over and the church bells were remelted. Already tomorrow, Ottoman sultan Suleiman the Magnificent observed the main Islamic Friday prayer, the jumu&#x27;ah namaz, in the former church. When Suleiman resettled Belgrade Christians to Constantinople, they took with them the icon of the Mother of God and relics of Saint Petka and Saint Theophano. Part of them were settled in the Istanbul&#x27;s neighborhood today known as Belgradkapı, or Belgrade Gate, where they built the Church of Theotokos, and presumably kept the icons and relics. Interiors and all the relics in this church were destroyed during the 1955 Istanbul pogrom.

Close to the church, the Ottomans dug into the ground a large gunpowder magazine. During the Austrian attack under the Eugene of Savoy, the Austrian army directly hit the magazine on 17 August 1717 causing an explosion which demolished almost all structures in the Lower Town, including the church. During their massive reconstruction of the fortress, and construction of the Baroque Belgrade which ensued in 1720–1739, the Austrians never reconstructed the church. Furthermore, in order to level the terrain in the Lower Town, they completely demolished the church ruins. Today, it is not known for neither where the church was exactly located, nor what its exterior looked like.

The only surviving part of the church are remains of the marble lintel with the incomplete &quot;ktetor&#x27;s&quot; inscription by despot Stefan Lazarević: &quot;В Христа Бога благоверни деспот Стеф...Београдске обнових место сие и призидах певнице и...придржеш...&quot; It was accidentally discovered in 1967. Larger remains of the Metropolitan&#x27;s Seat were discovered in 1977. They include arched open walls of the former porch. In February 2021, city announced it will finance the archaeological surveys on the locations where the church may have been built, in hope that at least the foundations of the church are preserved being buried underground.

=== Upper Town ===

Gornji Grad (Горњи Град), the upper section of fortress, turned into a park, with beautiful promenades and the statue of &quot;The Victor&quot; (Serbian: &quot;Pobednik&quot;), the so-called &quot;Roman well&quot; (Serbian: &quot;Rimski bunar&quot;), actually built by the Austrians, the Popular Observatory (since 1963) in the Despot Stefan Tower, the &quot;türbe&quot; (tomb) of Damad Ali Pasha, Mehmed Paša Sokolović&#x27;s Fountain, tennis and basketball courts, etc.

==== Gunpowder magazine (ca 1720s) ====

Also adapted for visits is the Great Austrian gunpowder magazine, built during the Austrian occupation of Belgrade 1718–39, after they destroyed the old one during the 1717 Siege of Belgrade. They directly hit the magazine with a cannonball and the explosion which followed allowed the Austrians to capture the city. The object is located below the tall rampart. The magazine is today embellished with the artifacts from the Roman period which were discovered in or around the fortress: tombstone stelae, monuments, altars and the Sarcophagus of Jonah, which originates from the 3rd century AD. It was arranged and opened for visitors in 2014.

One of the Roman marble monuments, exhibited since 2012, was the so-called &quot;Herkulanka&quot; (after Herculaneum, where first such sculptures were discovered in the 18th century). They were usually honorary representations of important women. Estimated to be work of some local sculptor to represent one of the more important female residents of Singidunum, it was made in c.300 and was found close to the Military Museum. The represented woman is rich, in heavily draped &quot;chiton&quot;, with the &quot;himation&quot; mantle wrapped over the arm and head. In May 2020, there was a break in the magazine&#x27;s lapidarium, and the &quot;Herkulanka&quot; was vandalized and broken.

==== Roman well (ca 1720s) ====

The present facility, called the Roman Well, is neither Roman nor a (water) well. It is located along the southwest rampart of the Upper Town, in the vicinity of the &quot;Pobednik&quot; monument and the &quot;King&#x27;s Gate&quot;. An underground object existed during the mediaeval period and is referenced by Constantine of Kostenets during the rule of Despot Stefan Lazarević, in the first half of the 15th century. It apparently was a dungeon as it was mentioned during the 1456 Siege of Belgrade when 30 Hungarian conspirators died in it after their scheme to let the Turks into the fortress and surrender the city to them was thwarted. They were to be paid by the Turks, but were discovered and dropped into the pit with ropes. They were left there without food and after they began losing their minds from hunger, they were thrown knives to kill each other. Turkish traveler Evliya Çelebi in 1660 wrote about the object as the grain silo.
After the Austrians occupied the northern Serbia in 1717, it was obvious that there is a problem of providing water for the city within the fortress. Main sources were two large rivers, Danube and Sava, but as Belgrade was quite often under siege or a battleground, it wasn&#x27;t practical as the rivers would become unreachable during the sieges so they searched for an alternative. Within the scopes of a massive construction and reconstruction of Belgrade in the Baroque manner, from 1717 to 1731 a present facility was dug and a complex wooden mechanism was installed to lift the water up from the pit of . It was designed by Balthasar Neumann. Austrians originally intended to dig a proper water well. They descended to , which is below the water level in the Sava, but found no water and actually hit the impervious rock layer. Then they decided to adapt it into the cistern and to conduct all surface water into it.

The mechanism was manually operated, worked on the lever principle and had 12 segments, or pistons, which all worked at the same time when operated. Water was then &quot;climbing&quot;, being poured from one vessel into another. Being made of wood, it either rotted away completely or was burned in the subsequent battles, but sometimes it is mentioned as the beginning of the &quot;industrial period&quot; in Belgrade. The copy of the schematics is still being kept in the library of the Matica Srpska in Novi Sad. Neumann also constructed a double spiral staircase which descends down the shaft and based it on the staircase in the Saint Peter Well in Orvieto, Italy, in 1527 by Antonio da Sangallo the Younger. The diameter of the shaft is . The staircase has 212 steps and there is a small corridor at the bottom which connects two sections of the staircase, but it is usually flooded. On Austrian maps, it is named the Great Well, but when Serbian rebels liberated Belgrade from the Ottomans in the early 19th century they gradually named it the Roman Well as the common belief at the time was that all old buildings were Roman.

In 1940 the Yugoslav Royal Army emptied the well, measured it and cleaned it. Because of that, during the World War II an urban myth spread through Belgrade claiming that the gold from the National bank of the Kingdom of Yugoslavia was hidden in the well. German occupation forces sent three divers to check the bottom of the well, but all three disappeared. Some of the Yugoslav soldiers apparently carved a number &quot;1940&quot; near the bottom of the well.

In 1954 a man threw his mistress into the well. Police wanted to prove that he killed her so the divers were dispatched to find the body, but they failed. Still, her body resurfaced ten days later. This story served as an inspiration for Dušan Makavejev when he wrote and directed the movie Love Affair, or the Case of the Missing Switchboard Operator in 1967. In 1964 Alfred Hitchcock visited the well and praised the &quot;ambience&quot;. In 1967–1968, new exploration of the object was conducted. The divers discovered that the bottom is full of sludge and retrieved a number of skeletons, several animal ones and two human. In 1987 the divers explored whether there is a connection between the well and the Sava, but found no tunnel. The bottom was flat, there was one park bench in the water and a huge number of coins. The Roman Well served as an inspiration for another , which was nominated by Serbia for an Oscar in 2002. During the 2006 dive, a miniature, long amphipoda, previously undiscovered in Serbia, was found. It was closed in 2007, reconstructed and reopened in March 2014, but as of 2017 the upper section is open for visitors while the descent is forbidden due to the safety reasons.

Divers explored it again in November 2017. The bottom wasn&#x27;t flat anymore as the bench and coins were covered with a thick layer of some of construction waste, iron bars, reflector lights, wired trash bins, etc., which all made the well shallower. Cans, plastic bottles and lids were floating on the water, while a pile of new coins formed. The divers suggested that the well should be cleaned at least once a year. Still, the water was unusually clear, with artificial reflector light it was transparent all the way to the bottom, or and had a temperature of . After 300 years, speleothems began to form near the bottom of the well.

The well remains one of the most &quot;mysterious&quot; and &quot;freighting&quot; structures in Belgrade. An entire mystical body of fringe stories developed around it, all including the idea that it is much older. From the claims that it existed during the despot Stefan Lazarević&#x27;s rule, or actually during the Roman period itself, being built by the soldiers from the Legio IV Flavia Felix, to the claims that it is a &quot;navel of the world&quot; and descend in the Hades, used by Orpheus during his search for Euridice. While a structure called &quot;bunar&quot; was mentioned in some texts regarding the Lazarević period, it was actually a food storage. There are also tales of the well being connected with the network of &quot;lagums&quot;, underground corridors in Zemun, across the Sava. Since 2007, city began making and amending plans for well&#x27;s reconstruction, even calling it a priority due to its bad shape, but as of 2023 it has not been renovated.

Existence of another water well, sort of a &quot;twin&quot; of the Roman well, is not widely known today. This well, built on the same principle and being about the same depth, is located away from the fortress, below the modern Monument to Vuk Karadžić in the Vukov Spomenik neighborhood.

==== Damad Ali Pasha&#x27;s türbe (1784) ====

The türbe is located on the central plateau of the Upper Town and is one of the few remaining monuments of Islamic architecture in Belgrade. It was named after Damad Ali Pasha, a Grand Vizier of the Ottoman Empire 1713–16, during the reign of Sultan Ahmed III. The mausoleum, however, is younger. It was built in 1784 over the grave of Izzet Mehmed Pasha, another Grand Vizier and a &quot;muhafiz&quot;, or governor, of Belgrade. The türbe was badly damaged during the First Serbian Uprising, so the Ottoman governor of Serbia, Marashli Ali Pasha, reconstructed it in 1818–19 and dedicated it to Damad Ali Pasha. Another two &quot;muhafiz&quot;, this time administering only the fortress as Serbia gained autonomy, were buried in the türbe: Selim Sirri Pasha in 1847 and Hasan Pasha in 1850.

The mausoleum is made of stone, with a regular hexagonal base. The sides are long, it is tall with a diameter of . A thorough renovation began in May 2017 and should be finished by October. The wiring and the roof are replaced, the floor was drained and the inner and outer conservation was done. Old roof tiles were broken so the water poured inside. The roof tiles, which were not the original roof cover, were replaced with the lead cover and new, modern roof tiles, rotten wooden floor was replaced with the brick slabs and the wooden covering of the tomb was also replaced.

==== Museum of Natural History (1830s-1840s) ====

The venue is located on the Great Ravelin. It was built in the 1830s or the 1840s. It originally served to house Ottoman guardsmen, so it is not a spacious object, covering . In 1957, the Museum of Forestry and Hunting was relocated from the Residence of Prince Miloš in Topčider into the building. In 1973, the museum was annexed to the Museum of Natural History. After the Museum of Forestry and Hunting was officially abolished in 1994, the building became a gallery of the Museum of Natural History. It has 35,000 visitors yearly.

==== Institute for the Protection of Cultural Monuments (1904) ====

The original building was built from 1902 to 1904, to serve as the headquarters of the Serbian General Staff. It was demolished during the Austro-Hungarian bombing of Belgrade across the Sava in October 1915. It was decided to build the new headquarters on the same location. In the post-war situation, when funds were low and urgency was needed to repair the damages, it was decided to erect two temporary structures. One building was constructed on the location of the First Southwest Rampart&#x27;s bastion, while the other one was built on the foundations of the 1904 building.

The rebuilt building was designed by Janko Šafarik, in the typical manner of 19th-century Serbian urban architecture. Facade and surrounding features include socle made of natural stone, side staircase of artificial stone, and fence and candelabra made of cast iron. When the general staff was moved into the new building in the Kneza Miloša Street in 1928, the building in the fortress was turned into the Military museum. In 1956, the museum was relocated to the nearby, much larger building of the Military and Geography Institute, the auxiliary building on the rampart was demolished, and the Institute for the Protection of Cultural Monuments moved into the remaining building in 1961. The building&#x27;s facade was fully renovated in the fall of 2021.

==== Bunker (1948–1949) ====

In 1948, after the Informbiro resolution and the ensuing Tito–Stalin split, a construction of the defensive bunker began on the fortress. In the process, the thick rampart of the original Nebojša Tower was discovered. It was destroyed and by 1949 the bunker which covers was finished. The tallest point of the bunker is the cannon dome which was used for the artillery and military units. Abandoned later, it was adapted for the tourists and opened in December 2012. It has parts of the authentic inventory from the 1950s: safety doors, beds, ventilation, water tanks, etc.

==== Basketball monument (2018) ====

On 12 December 2018, a monument officially called &quot;Monument to the Founding Fathers of Serbian and Yugoslav Basketball School&quot; was dedicated. The date was symbolic, as it also marked 95 years since the first basketball arrived in Serbia and 70 years since the founding of the basketball association. The monument is located in a small park area between the basketball courts of &quot;Partizan&quot; and &quot;Crvena Zvezda&quot;.

As written on the inscription, the monument is dedicated to the members of the Yugoslavia national basketball team which qualified for the 1950 FIBA World Championship in Argentina. Four players from this team became members of the FIBA Hall of Fame: Nebojša Popović, Aleksandar Nikolić, Radomir Šaper and Borislav Stanković. The sculpture was built on the initiative of the former basketball player Nataša Kovačević. The monument was designed by sculptor Radoš Radenković, symbolizes &quot;fight for global affirmation&quot; and represents three stylized arms reaching for a basketball.

=== Great Kalemegdan Park ===

Veliki Kalemegdanski park (Велики Калемегдански парк) occupies the southern corner of fortress, with geometrical promenades, the Military Museum, the Museum of Forestry and Hunting, and the Monument of Gratitude to France. At the location of the Monument of Gratitude to France there was a monument to Karađorđe which was dedicated on 21 August 1913, a work of Paško Vučetić. There was a relief with various figures on the sides of the pedestal and Karađorđe&#x27;s grandson, king Peter I of Serbia attended the dedication. During the Austro-Hungarian occupation of Belgrade in World War I, the Austrians planned to erect the bronze monument to their emperor, Franz Joseph I on that very spot so they melted the Karađorđe&#x27;s monument to reuse the bronze. When the Franz Joseph monument was being shipped to Belgrade in 1918, Serbian forces captured the ship and confiscated the statue. It was later melted into three church bells, largest of which still tolls from the belltower of the Ružica Church today.

==== Gondola lift ====
In August 2017 the construction of the gondola lift, which would connect Kalemegdan with Ušće was announced by the city government for 2018. Construction was confirmed in March 2018 when the idea of a pedestrian bridge was dropped after it has been described as &quot;complicated&quot; and &quot;unstable&quot;. On the Kalemegdan side, the station will be dug into the hill, 1m (3 ft 3in) below the fortress&#x27; Sava Promenade. There is a cave below the projected station, so there is a possibility that the cave will be adapted for visitations and connected to the future gondola station by an elevator. On the Ušćе side, the starting point will be next to the Skate Park, across the Ušće Tower. The entire route is long, of which will be above the Sava river itself. Estimated cost is €10 million and duration of works 18 months. Already existing criticism of the project continued, from the officially used name (&quot;gondola&quot; instead of a traditional Serbian &quot;žičara&quot;) and chosen location, to the route, especially the Kalemegdan station which is a collapsible locality above the cave, in the area already prone to mass wasting. Park of the Non-Aligned Countries in the neighborhood of Kosančićev Venac was proposed as the better solution.

Cutting of 47 trees in the park, because of the gondola lift began in March 2019. The pine trees were 50 to 60 years old. With an enlarged price of €15 million and unified opposition to the project by the environmentalists, architects and urbanists, with additional cutting of over 100 trees in Ušće park across the river, this prompted popular protests. Citizens organized and as the city was cutting the trees, they were planting new seedlings. Drilling also began and it was announced that the stone wall will be partially demolished, too. Municipality of Stari Grad also organized protests, demolishing fences on the construction site, filing complaints and fines against city and government officials and announcing 24-hours watch on site and demolition of any structure built in the meantime. Construction of the gondola lift is prohibited by the current Belgrade&#x27;s General Regulatory Plan from 2016 which stipulates that construction of the &quot;cables for the alternative transportation and recreation&quot; is forbidden in the area of the Belgrade Fortress.

In March 2020, Belgrade Fortress was voted one of the Europe&#x27;s 7 most endangered heritage sites by the pan-European cultural heritage organization Europa Nostra, specifically due to the planned construction of the gondola lift.

=== Little Kalemegdan Park ===

Mali Kalemegdanski park (Мали Калемегдански парк) occupies the area in the eastern section, which borders the urban section of Belgrade. The northern section of Little Kalemegdan Park is occupied by the Belgrade zoo, opened in 1936. The Cvijeta Zuzorić Art Pavilion is also located here.

== Overview ==

Kalemegdan is the most popular park among Belgraders and for many tourists visiting Belgrade because of the park&#x27;s numerous winding walking paths, shaded benches, picturesque fountains, statues, historical architecture and scenic river views (&quot;Sahat kula&quot; – the clock tower; closed in 2007 for the reconstruction, reopened in April 2014, &quot;Zindan kapija&quot; – Zindan gate, etc.). The former canal which was used for city supplying in the Middle Ages is completely covered by earth but the idea of recreating it resurfaced in the early 2000s. Belgrade Fortress is known for its kilometers-long tunnels, underground corridors and catacombs, which are still largely unexplored. In the true sense, fortress is today the green oasis in the Belgrade&#x27;s urban area.

As a combination of several habitats (parkland with old trees, fortress, landscape view of rivers and forested Veliko Ratno Ostrvo), Kalemegdan may be interesting for overseas tourists-birdwatchers as it provides a snapshot of local bird fauna. It is also important as the resting spot for small passerine birds on migration, before or after crossing the rivers Sava and Danube. Kalemegdan has its own eBird hotspot and associated webpage at Kalemegdan Hotspot

The Belgrade Race Through History, an annual 6 km footrace, takes place in the park and fortress as a way of highlighting the history and culture of the area.

The Belgrade Fortress was nominated by the Serbian government for the UNESCO&#x27;s World Heritage Site. Architects and urbanists think that possible inclusion on the list will protect the fortress from &quot;aggressive transitional construction&quot;. In that case, the outlines of the fortress and a panoramic view on it will have to be preserved. The perceived visual pollution encompasses several objects. A gigantic object, a late 2000s project by the Zaha Hadid&#x27;s studio, on the northern side of the fortress, down the slope of Danube. The project, despite some preparatory works, still didn&#x27;t start off. The other was the spiral project &quot;Cloud&quot; by Sou Fujimoto, which was to connect the Sava port to the fortress, but the project was scrapped after 2013 when the mayoral tenure of Đilas ended. The third project is controversial Belgrade Waterfront project.

The fortress in general functions as a major archaeological, artistic and historical treasury. As of 2014 it comprised:
* 19 memorial busts of important people from Serbian history, science and arts (Jovan Skerlić, Miloš Crnjanski, Jovan Dučić, Đura Daničić, Stevan Mokranjac
* 18 registered archaeological digs (horseshoe towers, remnants of the Metropolitan&#x27;s palace, Roman Castrum, building of the main guards)
* 6 monuments and memorials (Pobednik, Monument of Gratitude to France, Despot Stefan Lazarević&#x27;s Monument)
* 4 restaurants and coffee shops
* 4 sports terrains
* 3 sculptures (&quot;Genius of death&quot;, &quot;Tired fighter&quot;, &quot;Partisan with children&quot;)
* 2 fountains (&quot;Awakening&quot;, &quot;Fisherman&quot;)
* 2 drinking fountains (&quot;Japanese&quot;, &quot;Mehmed Paša Sokolović&quot;)
* 2 churches (Ružica, Saint Petka)
* 2 galleries (of the Natural Museum, Inner Stambol Gate)
* 2 museums (Military Museum, Nebojša Tower)
* Cvijeta Zuzorić Art Pavilion, City Institute for the protection of the cultural monuments, Belgrade Planetarium, Luna Park, Belgrade Zoo, People&#x27;s Observatory, Music Pavilion, Serbian Academy of Sciences and Arts&#x27; Archaeological Institute&#x27;s Science and Research Center for the Fortress, Memorial Ossuary for the 1914–15 defenders of Belgrade
* Tomb of People&#x27;s Heroes, containing the remains of the Communist party members and war heroes Ivan Milutinović, Đuro Đaković, Ivo Lola Ribar and Moša Pijade. The tomb was built for the first three in 1948, using the granite slabs intended for the construction of the Church of Saint Sava. Stevan Bodnarov sculptured their busts in 1949. After his death in 1957, Pijade was also buried in the tomb, and his bust, work of Slavoljub Stanković, was added in 1959. The complex was declared a cultural monument in 1983. Since the 1990s, the tomb has been frequently vandalized. After being vandalized three times in one year, members of organizations claiming Communist heritage organized citizens&#x27; watches to guard the tombs in December 2020, but desecrations continued in 2021 and 2022.

<doc id="823181" wikidata="Q1426628" url="?curid=823181" title="Muppets Tonight">
<text>Muppets Tonight is an American live-action/puppet family-oriented comedy television series, created by Jim Henson Productions and featuring The Muppets. The series ran for two seasons between March 1996 to February 1998, originally airing on ABC before later being aired and rerun on the Disney Channel. The show was a continuation of &quot;The Muppet Show&quot;, with Kermit the Frog and the Muppets running their own television channel and studio, only to request one of their own to run a new show to fill in a timeslot in their channel&#x27;s scheduling.

The series brought back several notable Muppet characters from &quot;The Muppet Show&quot; while introducing several new ones to the program, and made notable parodies of television programs ranging from game shows, chat shows, and educational entertainment. Each episode featured one principal guest star, but a number of episodes also featured additional guest stars; one episode featured a cameo from Leonard Nimoy. &quot;Muppets Tonight&quot; received mixed reviews from critics.

==Format==
The premise of &quot;Muppets Tonight&quot; was that Clifford was the host of a variety/talk show on KMUP. The show stuck closely to &quot;The Muppet Show&quot; format of various skits (mostly featuring the show&#x27;s human guest star) interspersed with some sort of crisis occurring backstage.

==Characters==

===Returning Muppets===
The Muppet characters performed by Frank Oz appeared intermittently on &quot;Muppets Tonight&quot; due to scheduling conflicts with his directing career.
* Clifford (performed by Kevin Clash) – Host of the show. Although he had visible eyes in this series instead of his previous sunglasses, he went back to wearing sunglasses for all of his appearances after &quot;Muppets Tonight&quot; ended. At the MuppetFest convention in 2001, Clash revealed that he preferred Clifford wearing sunglasses, refusing to perform the character again unless he was wearing them.

* The Elvises (performed by Brian Henson, Jerry Nelson, and Bill Barretta) – A group of Muppets resembling Elvis Presley that star in &quot;Great Moments in Elvis History&quot;

BBC1 screened the first 11 episodes at 7pm on Friday evenings from 6 September – 15 November 1996 with the last two going on 30th and 31st December at Lunchtimes. Sky One picked up the series in late December 1996 and continued to repeat episodes until Spring 1999. The BBC repeated 10 episodes in late August 1999.

In Ireland the show was broadcast on TG4, eventually being dubbed into Irish Gaelic.

<text>Bedford Basin is a large enclosed bay, forming the northwestern end of Halifax Harbour on Canada&#x27;s Atlantic coast. It is named in honour of John Russell, 4th Duke of Bedford.

==Geography==

Geographically, the basin is situated entirely within the Halifax Regional Municipality (HRM) and is oriented northwest-southeast, measuring approximately long and wide, surrounded by low hills measuring up to in elevation, although most elevations range up to . The basin is fed by water from the Sackville River and has a maximum depth of ; The basin&#x27;s geologic history can be traced to the Wisconsin Glaciation when it, along with &quot;The Narrows&quot;, formed part of the pre-historic Sackville River valley.

The basin contains the following sub-basins:

* Bedford Bay, in the extreme northwest.
* Birch Cove, on the western shore.
* Fairview Cove, in the extreme southwest.
* Wrights Cove, on the eastern shore.

Bedford on the northwestern corner takes its name from the basin, while Dartmouth sits on its eastern shore and Rockingham occupies the majority of the western shore. Africville Park is situated on the southern shore near the entrance into The Narrows.

The lands surrounding the basin are heavily developed with the only significant greenspace remaining being along the northeastern shore of the basin where a significant blast buffer zone surrounds Canadian Forces Ammunition Depot Bedford (CFAD Bedford); this is the Royal Canadian Navy&#x27;s weapons depot for its Atlantic fleet, known as Maritime Forces Atlantic (MARLANT).

The south shore of the basin at Fairview Cove hosts one of Halifax&#x27;s two container terminals as well as the railway yard, Pace Yard, operated by Canadian National Railway (CN). The east shore of the basin hosts Burnside Industrial Park, the largest industrial park in HRM, as well as a bulk gypsum terminal at Wrights Cove and the Bedford Institute of Oceanography (which also derives its name from the basin) situated near the entrance to The Narrows. The vast majority of the western shore to the head of the basin is fronted by rail lines, behind which are a mix of residential/commercial and institutional developments.

==History==
Though inhabited by the Mi&#x27;kmaq and the French having known of the site since the 17th century, the basin was named for John Russell, 4th Duke of Bedford, who was the British Secretary of State for the Colonies when Halifax was founded in 1749. The North American station of the Royal Navy was based just outside the entrance of the basin from 1759 to 1905, at the Royal Naval Dockyards. The naval base served as the station&#x27;s headquarters until 1818, when it became the summer headquarters of the station. Defences were built around the approach towards the basin&#x27;s entrance, with the construction of the York Redoubt at Ferguson&#x27;s Cove, as well as fortifications on Georges Island, and McNabs Island. These defences were a part of the Halifax Defence Complex. In 1907, the Royal Naval Dockyards was transferred to the Government of Canada, and continues to operate as CFB Halifax.
The basin played a key role during the First and Second World Wars when commercial shipping was being attacked by enemy submarines. Given the size of the Port of Halifax, and its vicinity to Europe in contrast to other North American ports, the basin was used as an assembly point for transatlantic convoys bound for Europe. With defences built just outside of the only access point into the basin (a strait called The Narrows), it provided a safe place to assemble convoys consisting of hundreds of merchant ships and their escorts in relative security, while torpedo nets kept submarines at bay. In December 1917 the basin was the site of the Halifax Explosion, where two ships collided in the basin causing an explosion that levelled most of the surrounding area.

In 1994, the defences that protected Bedford Basin were designated a National Historic Site of Canada, commemorating the assembly of convoys in Bedford Basin during the Second World War. In 2010, on the 100th anniversary of the Royal Canadian Navy, a plaque was unveiled at Bedford Lake, Griesbach, Edmonton, Alberta, in recognition of the role played by Bedford Basin in the world wars.

&quot;Bedford Basin is a large enclosed anchorage, forming the northwestern end of Halifax Harbour in Nova Scotia on Canada&#x27;s Atlantic coast. The basin is quite deep and the good holding ground on the basin floor makes it an ideal anchorage and a protected location for ships.
The Basin came to international significance during both the First and Second World Wars when the German navy began to use submarines as an offensive weapon against Allied shipping. Canada&#x27;s prominent role in the First World War led to Halifax being chosen as the primary logistic port for resupplying Western Europe. The protected waters of Bedford Basin allowed the Royal Navy and Royal Canadian Navy to assemble convoys consisting of hundreds of merchant ships in relative security while torpedo nets kept German submarines at bay. As observed By Rear Admiral Leonard W. Murray (RCN), Halifax saw first hand the tragic loss of life amongst merchant seamen. The Basin was a daily witness to the grim war at sea. Stricken vessels limped back to port and seamen fold their stories of battle and the hazards of the North Atlantic convoy routes.
Today, CFB Halifax is located on the channel at the entrance to Bedford Basin and is the home of Canada&#x27;s Atlantic fleet.&quot;- Bedford Basin Memorial in Alberta

<text>Holland is a neighborhood in the Northeast community in Minneapolis. It is one of ten neighborhoods in Ward 1 of Minneapolis, currently represented by Council President Elliott Payne.

==Location and characteristics==
Holland&#x27;s boundaries are 27th Avenue NE to the north, Central Avenue to the east, 19th and 17th Avenues NE to the south, and University Avenue NE to the west. It is named after Josiah G. Holland, an American educator, novelist and poet.

Much of the neighborhood is smaller residential housing dating from before 1920. During the early 20th century it was a common destination for immigrants from Eastern Europe, some of whom worked at the Shoreham Yards railroad complex north of the neighborhood. Today it is considered part of the Northeast Minneapolis Arts District as it has gradually transformed to include more small businesses, restaurants, art galleries and workspaces.

==Landmarks==
The neighborhood is home to Edison High School, the nearby Jackson Square Park and the Northeast Branch of the Hennepin County Library. A strip of land on the north side of 27th Avenue NE has been dedicated to community use and is maintained by its owners, Canadian Pacific Railway. Although officially the strip is within the Columbia Park neighborhood, Holland volunteers are largely responsible for its development, including a playground and neighborhood garden.

Holland is bisected by two active lines of Burlington Northern Railway which converge within the neighborhood, one connecting to downtown Minneapolis, the other to Saint Paul via the rail yards north of the University of Minnesota. Both are fully grade-separated, making railroad bridges a significant feature of the neighborhood.

Holland&#x27;s east boundary is Central Avenue, one of the main commercial districts of the neighborhood and the larger Northeast community. It includes the Northeast Library branch of the Hennepin County Library. Other businesses lie along Lowry and University Avenues.

==Transportation==
Holland is served by Metro Transit bus routes 10 (Central Avenue), 17 (Washington Street), and 32 (Lowry Avenue). 22nd Avenue NE is a bicycle boulevard and Central Avenue has dedicated bike lanes.

<doc id="823226" wikidata="Q2687297" url="?curid=823226" title="Gilleleje">
<text>Gilleleje () is a fishing town and seaside resort on the north coast of the peninsula North Zealand, Denmark. The town is located at the northernmost point of the island of Zealand. It is one of the main towns of the Gribskov municipality in Region Hovedstaden in Denmark. As of 1 January 2024, it has a population of 6,702.

==Etymology==

The name &quot;Gilleleje&quot; is made up from the combination of the obsolete Danish word &quot;gil&quot;, which is a or , and &quot;leje&quot;, which is a place where fishermen come in specific seasons to fish. It was probably concatenated from Gilbjerg Leje, where Gilbjerg (&quot;cleftmountain&quot;) is a rather dramatic name for a rather mundane point just west of town limits. The towns ending in -leje are often from the 16th century, when the fishermen actually settled and regular townships appeared. Compare with the Swedish ending &quot;läge&quot;.

==History==
=== Fishing village ===
The earliest confirmed permanent residence in Gilleleje is in the early 16th century. An excavation, done in 1979 by the city museum, revealed a lot from a house under the layers of sand. The house had most likely been built shortly after 1536, as a coin was found, dated 1534-36. There were also found ceramics reminiscent of other finds, so the archeologists assumed that the culture layer was from the late 15th century. Additionally, the house was found on the address &quot;Fabersvej 10&quot; which is not the closest to the beach, and the habit was to build from the beach and inwards.
At around this time, it is also known that the village had enough financial means to build a church and hire a priest. This required considerable funds, and the general consensus, then, is that the township went from seasonal fishing to year-round fishing, and the fishermen settled down in the years surrounding 1500. Town hall has established 1488 as the &quot;official&quot; founding year to make celebrating easier. The church was inaugurated in 1538 by the newly ordained priest Hans Lauridtzen.

In 1588, the vassal of Kronborg made a list of the taxes that the fishermen should pay. This was one or a half barrel of cod. From this list, we can see who the earliest citizens were. There are about 70 names (a name is analogous to a house - there were probably about 500 citizens), with the surnames &quot;Lauritsen&quot;, &quot;Rasmussen&quot;, &quot;Jensen&quot; and &quot;Skomager&quot; being the most common. Note that patronymic surnames were the norm then, but from this, it gives an impression of what first names were in vogue among the citizens.

Aside from the fishing, the taxes allowed people to grow various types of crops south of the town, such as wheat. There was also a pasture, on which there were many cows and sheep. Most of the town was on the eastern side of the stream that came from Søborg (&quot;Lakecastle&quot; - ironically, the lake has since been drained and the castle is now a ruin) in the south and went out in the ocean just east of the drying grounds.

Unfortunately, the influx of fishermen made hard on the fishing, and several families could not catch enough fish to both sustain a living and pay the taxes. In 1632, only 18 families were left. This stabilized the conditions somewhat, and in 1682, the number was up to 30, according to the records of Christian V. A new problem was present, though. The shifting sand would bury boats and nets, and had to be shoveled away, delaying the real work somewhat. Part of the eastern side of the town was even deserted as a few houses had gradually been buried under dunes.

South of the town was Nellerupgård, the local manor, home to Carl Christian Lembach and Catrine Marie Milan (a descendant of Gabriel Milan) in the late 18th century. They owned most of the land in the area, especially after extracting &quot;their&quot; parts of the common pasture, letting the common citizens get the furthermost areas.

=== Fishing town and seaside resort ===

During the 1810s and 20s, the city expanded a lot, and many new houses were built in the eastern area that had once been abandoned. A real harbor was built in 1873, where the drying ground had been. This meant larger ships and thus more jobs, making more people move to the town. In 1890, the town was at 865 households, 112 of which were fishermen. In 1896, Gilleleje was connected with the Danish rail network as the Græsted–Gilleleje section of the Gribskov railway line between Hillerød and Gilleleje opened. The outer harbor was finished in 1902, and in 1916 Gilleleje was connected with Elsinore as the Hornbæk-Gilleleje section of the Hornbæk railway line was opened.

At the same time, Gilleleje developed into a seaside resort that attracted a large number of holidaymakers every year. At the turn of the century, the town thus contained a guest house, a bathing hotel, many villas, a sanatorium and recreation homes.

=== World War II ===

Gilleleje continued to thrive on its fishing until 1940 when Nazi-Germany occupied Denmark. Like most other Danes at the time, the Gillelejere were against the oppression and helped the Jews by hiding them various places in the town. However, on 2 October 1943, the Gestapo set out to capture all Danish Jews. The Jews in Gilleleje were hidden on the church-loft, and the fishermen prepared for taking them across the sound to Sweden in their s. They could not leave immediately, though, because of the German patrols in the street. After several days of hiding, an informer let the Germans know where the roughly 75 Jews were hiding, and they were all captured, bar a single boy who hid behind a gravestone in the cemetery. According to local lore, the priest was so mortified by the situation that he never really became normal again.

A memorable exchange resulted after the Gestapo seized Jewish families in the town. &quot;The poor Jews!&quot; exclaimed one villager to a Gestapo officer. When the German responded that it was &quot;written in the Bible that this shall be their fate,” the villager retorted, “but it is not written that it has to happen in Gilleleje.”
After the occupation was over, several memorials have been put up in the town, both commemorating the Jews and the fishermen who lost their lives when colliding with sea mines.

=== Post-war period ===
The eastern areas (called Stæremosen - &quot;Starling moor&quot;) that had been used for pasture became the industrial area in and around 1950, creating more jobs, meaning more newcomers.

== Economy ==
Gilleleje harbor is the 5th largest commercial fishing harbor in Denmark.

==Transportation==
===Railway stations===

The Hornbæk railway line connects Gilleleje with Helsingør and the Gribskov railway line connects Gilleleje with Hillerød. Gilleleje railway station is the principal railway station of the town. The town is also served by the railway halts Gilleleje East, Stæremosen and Fjellenstrup.

<text>Greek temples (, semantically distinct from Latin , &quot;temple&quot;) were structures built to house deity statues within Greek sanctuaries in ancient Greek religion. The temple interiors did not serve as meeting places, since the sacrifices and rituals dedicated to the deity took place outside them, within the wider precinct of the sanctuary, which might be large. Temples were frequently used to store votive offerings. They are the most important and most widespread surviving building type in Greek architecture. In the Hellenistic kingdoms of Southwest Asia and of North Africa, buildings erected to fulfill the functions of a temple often continued to follow the local traditions. Even where a Greek influence is visible, such structures are not normally considered as Greek temples. This applies, for example, to the Graeco-Parthian and Bactrian temples, or to the Ptolemaic examples, which follow Egyptian tradition. Most Greek temples were oriented astronomically.

Between the 9th century BC and the 6th century BC, the ancient Greek temples developed from the small mud brick structures into double-porched monumental &quot;peripteral&quot; buildings with colonnade on all sides, often reaching more than 20 metres in height (not including the roof). Stylistically, they were governed by the regionally specific architectural orders. Whereas the distinction was originally between the Doric and Ionic orders, a third alternative arose in late 3rd century with the Corinthian order. A multitude of different ground plans were developed, each of which could be combined with the superstructure in the different orders. Temples would be destroyed due to warfare in the Greek World or from lack of repairs. Some of these temples such as the temple of Poseidon Soter (The Savior) would be rebuilt outside of Athens after the defeat of the Persian Empire in 449. From the 3rd century onward, the construction of large temples became less common; after a short 2nd century BC flourish, it ceased nearly entirely in the 1st century BC. Thereafter, only smaller structures were started, while older temples continued to be renovated or brought to completion if in an unfinished state.

Greek temples were designed and constructed according to set proportions, mostly determined by the lower diameter of the columns or by the dimensions of the foundation levels. The nearly mathematical strictness of the basic designs thus reached was lightened by optical refinements. In spite of the still widespread idealised image, Greek temples were painted, so that bright reds and blues contrasted with the white of the building stones or of stucco. The more elaborate temples were equipped with very rich figural decoration in the form of reliefs and sculptures on the pediment. The construction of temples was usually organised and financed by cities or by the administrations of sanctuaries. Private individuals, especially Hellenistic rulers, could also sponsor such buildings. In the late Hellenistic period, their decreasing financial wealth, along with the progressive incorporation of the Greek world within the Roman state, whose officials and rulers took over as sponsors, led to the end of Greek temple construction. New temples now belonged to the tradition of the Roman temple, which, in spite of the very strong Greek influence on it, aimed for different goals and followed different aesthetic principles (for a comparison, see the other article).

The main temple building sat within a larger precinct or &quot;temenos&quot;, usually surrounded by a &quot;peribolos&quot; fence or wall; the whole is usually called a &quot;sanctuary&quot;. The Acropolis of Athens is the most famous example, though this was apparently walled as a citadel before a temple was ever built there. This might include many subsidiary buildings, sacred groves or springs, animals dedicated to the deity, and sometimes people who had taken sanctuary from the law, which some temples offered, for example to runaway slaves.
== Development ==
===Origins===
The earliest Greek Sanctuaries probably did not contain temple buildings, though our knowledge of these is limited since many of these were destroyed, and the subject is controversial. A typical early sanctuary seems to have consisted of a , often around a sacred grove, cave or spring, and perhaps defined only by marker stones at intervals, with an altar for offerings. Many rural sanctuaries probably stayed in this style, but the more popular were gradually able to afford a building to house a cult image, especially in cities. This process was certainly under way by the 9th century BC, and probably started earlier.

The Mycenaean &quot;megaron&quot; (15th to the 13th century BC) was the precursor for later Archaic and Classical Greek temples, but during the Greek Dark Age the buildings became smaller and less monumental.
The basic principles for the development of Greek temple architecture have their roots between the 10th century BC and the 7th century BC. In its simplest form as a &quot;naos&quot;, the temple was a simple rectangular shrine with protruding side walls (&quot;antae&quot;), forming a small porch. Until the 8th century BC, there were also apsidal structures with more or less semi-circular back walls, but the rectangular type prevailed. By adding columns to this small basic structure, the Greeks triggered the development and variety of their temple architecture.

The Temple of Isthmia, built in 690–650 BC was perhaps the first true Archaic temple. Its size, colonnade, and roof made it different from then-contemporary buildings.

===Wooden architecture: Early Archaic===
The first temples were mostly mud, brick, and marble structures on stone foundations. The columns and superstructure (entablature) were wooden, door openings and were protected with wooden planks. The mud brick walls were often reinforced by wooden posts, in a type of half-timbered technique. The elements of this simple and clearly structured wooden architecture produced all the important design principles that were to determine the development of Greek temples for centuries.

Near the end of the 7th century, the dimensions of these simple structures were increased considerably. Temple C at Thermos is the first of the , temples with a length of . Since it was not technically possible to roof broad spaces at that time, these temples remained very narrow, at 6 to 10 metres in width.

To stress the importance of the cult statue and the building holding it, the was equipped with a canopy, supported by columns. The resulting set of colonnade surrounding the temple on all sides (the &quot;peristasis&quot;) was exclusively used for temples in Greek architecture.

The combination of the temple with colonnades (&quot;ptera&quot;) on all sides posed a new aesthetic challenge for the architects and patrons: the structures had to be built to be viewed from all directions. This led to the development of the &quot;peripteros&quot;, with a frontal &quot;pronaos&quot; (porch), mirrored by a similar arrangement at the back of the building, the &quot;opisthodomos&quot;, which became necessary for entirely aesthetic reasons.
===Introduction of stone architecture: Archaic and Classical===
After the reintroduction of stone architecture, the essential elements and forms of each temple, such as the number of columns and of column rows, underwent constant change throughout Greek antiquity.

In the 6th century BC, Ionian Samos developed the double-colonnaded &quot;dipteros&quot; as an alternative to the single . This idea was later copied in Didyma, Ephesos and Athens. Between the 6th and the late 4th century, innumerable temples were built; nearly every &quot;polis&quot;, every Greek colony contained one or several. There were also temples at extra-urban sites and at major sanctuaries like Olympia and Delphi.

The observable change of form indicates the search for a harmonious form of all architectural elements: the development led from simpler early forms which often appear coarse and bulky up to the aesthetic perfection and refinement of the later structures; from simple experimentation to the strict mathematical complexity of ground plans and superstructures.
===Decline of Greek temple building: Hellenistic period===

From the early Hellenistic period onwards, the Greek peripteral temple lost much of its importance. With very few exceptions, Classical temple construction ceased both in Hellenistic Greece and in the Greek colonies of Magna Graecia. Only the west of Asia Minor maintained a low level of temple construction during the 3rd century. The construction of large projects, such as the temple of Apollo at Didyma near Miletus and the Artemision at Sardis did not make much progress.

The 2nd century saw a revival of temple architecture, including peripteral temples. This is partially due to the influence of the architect Hermogenes of Priene, who redefined the principles of Ionic temple construction both practically and through theoretical work. At the same time, the rulers of the various Hellenistic kingdoms provided copious financial resources. Their self-aggrandisation, rivalry, desires to stabilise their spheres of influence, as well as the increasing conflict with Rome (partially played out in the field of culture), combined to release much energy into the revival of complex Greek temple architecture. During this phase, Greek temples became widespread in southern Asia Minor, Egypt and Northern Africa.

But in spite of such examples and of the positive conditions produced by the economic upturn and the high degree of technical innovation in the 3rd and 2nd centuries, Hellenistic religious architecture is mostly represented by a multitude of small temples &quot;in antis&quot; and &quot;prostyle&quot; temples, as well as tiny shrines (&quot;naiskoi&quot;). The latter had been erected in important places, on market squares, near springs and by roads, since the Archaic period, but reached their main flourish now. This limitation to smaller structures led to the development of a special form, the &quot;pseudoperipteros&quot;, which uses engaged columns along the &quot;naos&quot; walls to produce the illusion of a peripteral temple. An early case of this is temple L at Epidauros, followed by many prominent Roman examples, such as the Maison Carrée at Nîmes.

===End of Greek temple construction: Roman Greece===
In the early 1st century BC, the Mithridatic Wars led to changes of architectural practice. The role of sponsor was increasingly taken by Roman magistrates of the Eastern provinces, who rarely demonstrated their generosity by building temples. Nevertheless, some temples were erected at this time, e.g. the Temple of Aphrodite at Aphrodisias.

The introduction of the principate lead to few new buildings, mostly temples for the imperial cult or to Roman deities, e.g. the temple of Jupiter at Baalbek. Although new temples to Greek deities still continued to be constructed, e.g. the Tychaion at Selge they tend to follow the canonical forms of the developing Roman imperial style of architecture or to maintain local non-Greek idiosyncrasies, like the temples in Petra or Palmyra. The increasing romanisation of the east entailed the end of Greek temple architecture, although work continued on the completion of unfinished large structures like the temple of Apollo at Didyma or the Olympieion at Athens into the later 2nd century AD.
===Abandonment and conversion of temples: Late Antiquity===
The edicts of Theodosius I and his successors on the throne of the Roman Empire, banning pagan cults, led to the gradual closure of Greek temples, or their conversion into Christian churches.

Thus ends the history of the Greek temples&#x27; original purpose, although many of them remained in use for a long time afterwards. For example, the Athenian Parthenon, first reconsecrated as a church was turned into a mosque after the Ottoman conquest and remained structurally unharmed until the 17th century AD. Only the unfortunate impact of a Venetian cannonball into the building, then used to store gunpowder, led to the destruction of much of this important temple, more than 2,000 years after it was built.

== Structure ==
Canonical Greek temples maintained the same basic structure throughout many centuries. The Greeks used a limited number of spatial components, influencing the plan, and of architectural members, determining the elevation.

=== Floor plan ===
The central cult structure of the temple is the or &quot;cella&quot;, which usually contained a cult statue of the deity. In Archaic temples, a separate room, the so-called &quot;adyton&quot; was sometimes included after the for this purpose. In Sicily, this habit continued into the Classical period.

==== and ====
In front of the , there is a porch, the &quot;pronaos&quot;, created by the protruding side walls of the (the &quot;antae)&quot;, and two columns placed between them. A door allows the to be accessed from the . A similar room at the back of the is called the &quot;opisthodomos&quot;. There is no door connecting the with the ; its existence is necessitated entirely by aesthetic considerations: to maintain the consistency of the peripteral temple and to ensure its visibility from all sides, the execution of the front has to be repeated at the rear. A restricted space, the , may be included at the far end of the , backing up on the .
The complex formed by the , , and possibly the is enclosed on all four sides by the &quot;peristasis&quot;, usually a single row, rarely a double one, of columns. This produces a surrounding colonnade, the &quot;pteron&quot;, which offered shelter to visitors of the sanctuary and room for cult processions.
====Plan types====

These components allowed the realisation of a variety of different plan types in Greek temple architecture. The simplest example of a Greek temple is the , a small rectangular structure sheltering the cult statue. In front of the , a small porch or was formed by the protruding walls, the &quot;antae&quot;. The was linked to the by a door. To support the superstructure, two columns were placed between the (distyle &quot;in antis&quot;). When equipped with an &quot;opisthodomos&quot; with a similar design, this is called a double temple. A variant of that type has the at the back of the indicated merely by half-columns and shortened , so that it can be described as a .

If the porch of a temple has a row of usually four or six columns in front of its whole breadth, the temple is described as a or prostyle temples. The whole may be omitted in this case or just leave the without columns. An &quot;amphiprostylos&quot; or amphiprostyle repeats the same column setting at the back.

In contrast, the term &quot;peripteros&quot; or peripteral designates a temple surrounded by &quot;ptera&quot; (colonnades) on all four sides, each usually formed by a single row of columns. This produces an unobstructed surrounding portico, the &quot;peristasis&quot;, on all four sides of the temple. A Hellenistic and Roman form of this shape is the &quot;pseudoperipteros&quot;, where the side columns of the are indicated only by engaged columns or pilasters directly attached to the external walls.

A or &quot;dipteral&quot; is equipped with a double colonnade on all four sides, sometimes with further rows of columns at the front and back. A has engaged columns in the inner row of columns at the sides.

Circular temples form a special type. If they are surrounded by a colonnade, they are known as peripteral &quot;tholoi&quot;. Although of sacred character, their function as a temple can often not be asserted. A comparable structure is the &quot;monopteros&quot;, or &quot;cyclostyle&quot; which, however, lacks a .

To clarify ground plan types, the defining terms can be combined, producing terms such as: peripteral double temple, prostyle , peripteral amphiprostyle, etc.

====Column number terminology====
An additional definition, already used by Vitruvius (IV, 3, 3) is determined by the number of columns at the front. Modern scholarship uses the following terms:

The term is only used for the 12-column hall at the Didymaion. No temples with facades of that width are known.

Very few temples had an uneven number of columns at the front. Examples are Temple of Hera I at Paestum, Temple of Apollo A at Metapontum, both of which have a width of nine columns (enneastyle), and the Archaic temple at Thermos with a width of five columns (pentastyle).

=== Elevation ===
The elevation of Greek temples is always subdivided in three zones: the &quot;crepidoma&quot;, the columns and the entablature.

====Foundations and ====
Stereobate, and form the substructure of the temple. The underground foundation of a Greek temple is known as the stereobate. It consists of several layers of squared stone blocks. The uppermost layer, the &quot;euthynteria&quot;, partially protrudes above the ground level. Its surface is carefully smoothed and levelled. It supports a further foundation of three steps, the &quot;crepidoma&quot;. The uppermost level of the provides the surface on which the columns and walls are placed; it is called stylobate.

====Columns====
Placed on the stylobate are the vertical column shafts, tapering towards the top. They are normally made of several separately cut column drums. Depending on the architectural order, a different number of flutings are cut into the column shaft: Doric columns have 18 to 20 flutings, Ionic and Corinthian ones normally have 24. Early Ionic columns had up to 48 flutings. While Doric columns stand directly on the stylobate, Ionic and Corinthian ones possess a base, sometimes additionally placed atop a plinth.

In Doric columns, the top is formed by a concavely curved neck, the &quot;hypotrachelion&quot;, and the capital, in Ionic columns, the capital sits directly on the shaft. In the Doric order, the capital consists of a circular torus bulge, originally very flat, the so-called &quot;echinus&quot;, and a square slab, the &quot;abacus&quot;. In the course of their development, the &quot;echinus&quot; expands more and more, culminating in a linear diagonal, at 45° to the vertical. The of Ionic columns is decorated with an egg-and-dart band followed by a sculpted pillow forming two volutes, supporting a thin . The eponymous Corinthian capital of the Corinthian order is crowned by rings of stylised acanthus leaves, forming tendrils and volutes that reach to the corners of the .

====Entablature====
The capitals support the entablature. In the Doric order, the entablature always consists of two parts, the architrave and the Doric frieze (or triglyph frieze). The Ionic order of Athens and the Cyclades also used a frieze above an architrave, whereas the frieze remained unknown in the Ionic architecture of Asia Minor until the 4th century BC. There, the architrave was directly followed by the &quot;dentils&quot;. The frieze was originally placed in front of the roof beams, which were externally visible only in the earlier temples of Asia Minor. The Doric frieze was structured by triglyphs. These were placed above the axis of each column, and above the centre of each intercolumniation. The spaces between the triglyphs contained metopes, sometimes painted or decorated with relief sculpture. In the Ionic or Corinthian orders, the frieze possesses no triglyphs and is simply left flat, sometimes decorated with paintings or reliefs. With the introduction of stone architecture, the protection of the porticos and the support of the roof construction was moved upwards to the level of the &quot;geison&quot;, depriving the frieze of its structural function and turning it into an entirely decorative feature. Frequently, the is also decorated with architrave and frieze, especially at the front of the &quot;pronaos&quot;.

====Cornice and ====
Above the frieze, or an intermediate member, e.g. the dentil of the Ionic or Corinthian orders, the cornice protrudes notably. It consists of the &quot;geison&quot; (on the sloped sides or pediments of the narrow walls a sloped ), and the &quot;sima&quot;. On the long side, the , often elaborately decorated, was equipped with water spouts, often in the shape of lions&#x27; heads. The pedimental triangle or &quot;tympanon&quot; on the narrow sides of the temple was created by the Doric introduction of the gabled roof, earlier temples often had hipped roofs. The was usually richly decorated with pedimental sculpture of mythical scenes or battles. The corners and ridges of the roof were decorated with &quot;acroteria&quot;, originally geometric, later floral or figural decorations.

===Aspect===
As far as topographically possible, the temples were freestanding and designed to be viewed from all sides. They were not normally designed with consideration for their surroundings, but formed autonomous structures. This is a major difference from Roman temples which were often designed as part of a planned urban area or square and had a strong emphasis on being viewed frontally.

== Design and measurements ==

===Proportions===
The foundations of Greek temples could reach dimensions of up to 115 by 55 m, i.e. the size of an average football pitch. Columns could reach a height of 20 m. To design such large architectural bodies harmoniously, a number of basic aesthetic principles were developed and tested already on the smaller temples. The main measurement was the foot, varying between 29 and 34 cm from region to region. This initial measurement was the basis for all the units that determined the shape of the temple. Important factors include the lower diameter of the columns and the width of their plinths. The distance between the column axes (intercolumniation or bay) could also be used as a basic unit. These measurements were in set proportions to other elements of design, such as column height and column distance. In conjunction with the number of columns per side, they also determined the dimensions of stylobate and &quot;peristasis&quot;, as well as of the &quot;naos&quot; proper. The rules regarding vertical proportions, especially in the Doric order, also allow for a deduction of the basic design options for the entablature from the same principles. Alternatives to this very rational system were sought in the temples of the late 7th and early 6th centuries, when it was attempted to develop the basic measurements from the planned dimensions of or stylobate, i.e. to reverse the system described above and deduce the smaller units from the bigger ones. Thus, for example, the length was sometimes set at (100 is a sacred number, also known from the &quot;hecatomb&quot;, a sacrifice of 100 animals), and all further measurements had to be in relation to this number, leading to aesthetically quite unsatisfactory solutions.

=== relationship===
Another determining design feature was the relationship linking and . In the original temples, this would have been subject entirely to practical necessities, and always based on axial links between walls and columns, but the introduction of stone architecture broke that connection. Nevertheless, it did survive throughout Ionic architecture. In Doric temples, however, the wooden roof construction, originally placed behind the frieze, now started at a higher level, behind the . This ended the structural link between frieze and roof; the structural elements of the latter could now be placed independent of axial relationships. As a result, the walls lost their fixed connection with the columns for a long time and could be freely placed within the . Only after a long phase of developments did the architects choose the alignment of the outer wall face with the adjacent column axis as the obligatory principle for Doric temples. Doric temples in Greater Greece rarely follow this system.

===Column number formula===
The basic proportions of the building were determined by the numeric relationship of columns on the front and back to those on the sides. The classic solution chosen by Greek architects is the formula &quot;frontal columns : side columns = n : (2n+1)&quot;, which can also be used for the number of intercolumniations. As a result, numerous temples of the Classical period in Greece ( to 336) had 6 × 13 columns or 5 × 11 intercolumniations. The same proportions, in a more abstract form, determine most of the Parthenon, not only in its 8 × 17 column , but also, reduced to 4:9, in all other basic measurements, including the intercolumniations, the stylobate, the width-height proportion of the entire building, and the (here reversed to 9:4).
===Column spacing===
Since the turn of the 3rd and 2nd centuries BC, the proportion of column width to the space between columns, the intercolumnium, played an increasingly important role in architectural theory, reflected, for example, in the works of Vitruvius. According to this proportion, Vitruvius (3, 3, 1 ff) distinguished between five different design concepts and temple types:
* Pyknostyle, tight-columned: intercolumnium = 1 lower column diameters
* Systyle, close-columned: intercolumnium = 2 lower column diameters
* Eustyle, well-columned: intercolumnium = 2 lower column diameters
* Diastyle, board-columned: interkolumnium = 3 lower column diameters
* Araeostyle, light-columned: intercolumnium = 3 lower column diameters
The determination and discussion of these basic principles went back to Hermogenes, whom Vitruvius credits with the invention of the . The Temple of Dionysos at Teos, normally ascribed to Hermogenes, does indeed have intercolumnia measuring 2 1/6 of the lower column diameters.
== Optical refinements ==
To loosen up the mathematical strictness and to counteract distortions of human visual perception, a slight curvature of the whole building, hardly visible with the naked eye, was introduced. The ancient architects had realised that long horizontal lines tend to make the optical impression of sagging towards their centre. To prevent this effect, the horizontal lines of stylobate and/or entablature were raised by a few centimetres towards the middle of a building. This avoidance of mathematically straight lines also included the columns, which did not taper in a linear fashion, but were refined by a pronounced &quot;swelling&quot; (&quot;entasis&quot;) of the shaft. Additionally, columns were placed with a slight inclination towards the centre of the building. Curvature and &quot;entasis&quot; occur from the mid 6th century onwards.

The most consistent use of these principles is seen in the Classical Parthenon on the Athenian Acropolis. Its curvature affects all horizontal elements up to the , even the walls reflect it throughout their height. The inclination of its columns (which also have a clear &quot;entasis&quot;), is continued by architrave and triglyph frieze, the external walls of the also reflect it. Not one block of the building, not a single architrave or frieze element could be hewn as a simple rectilinear block. All architectural elements display slight variations from the right angle, individually calculated for each block. As a side effect, each preserved building block from the Parthenon, its columns, walls or entablature, can be assigned its exact position today. In spite of the immense extra effort entailed in this perfection, the Parthenon, including its sculptural decoration, was completed in the record time of sixteen years (447 to 431).

==Decoration==

=== Colouring ===
Only three basic colours were used: white, blue and red, occasionally also black. The , columns, and architrave were mostly white. Only details, like the horizontally cut grooves at the bottom of Doric capitals (), or decorative elements of Doric architraves (e.g. &quot;taenia&quot; and &quot;guttae&quot;) might be painted in different colours. The frieze was clearly structured by use of colours. In a Doric triglyph frieze, blue triglyphs alternated with red metopes, the latter often serving as a background for individually painted sculptures. Reliefs, ornaments, and pedimental sculptures were executed with a wider variety of colours and nuances. Recessed or otherwise shaded elements, like mutules or triglyph slits could be painted black. The paint was mostly applied to parts that were not load-bearing, whereas structural parts like columns or the horizontal elements of architrave and were left unpainted (if made of high-quality limestone or marble) or covered with a white stucco.

=== Architectural sculpture ===
Greek temples were often enhanced with figural decorations. especially the frieze areas offered space for reliefs and relief slabs; the pedimental triangles often contained scenes of free-standing sculpture. In Archaic times, even the architrave could be relief-decorated on Ionic temples, as demonstrated by the earlier temple of Apollo at Didyma. Here, the architrave corners bore gorgons, surrounded by lions and perhaps other animals. On the other hand, the Ionic temples of Asia Minor did not possess a separate frieze to allow space for relief decoration. The most common area for relief decoration remained the frieze, either as a typical Doric triglyph frieze, with sculpted metopes, or as a continuous frieze on Cycladic and later on Eastern Ionic temples.

====Metopes====

The metopes, separate individual tableaux that could usually not contain more than three figures each, usually depicted individual scenes belonging to a broader context. It is rare for scenes to be distributed over several metopes; instead, a general narrative context, usually a battle, is created by the combination of multiple isolated scenes. Other thematical contexts could be depicted in this fashion. For example, the metopes at the front and back of the Temple of Zeus at Olympia depicted the Twelve Labours of Heracles. Individual mythological scenes, like the abduction of Europa or a cattle raid by the Dioscuri could be thus depicted, as could scenes from the voyage of the Argonauts or the Trojan War. The battles against the centaurs and Amazons, as well as the gigantomachy, all three depicted on the Parthenon, were recurring themes on many temples.

====Friezes====

Battle scenes of all kinds were also a common theme of Ionic friezes, e.g. the Gigantomachy on the temple of Hekate at Lagina, or the Amazonomachy on the temple of Artemis at Magnesia on the Maeander, both from the late 2nd century BC. Complex compositions visualised the back and forth of fighting for the viewer. Such scenes were contrasted by more quiet or peaceful ones: The Assembly of the gods and a procession dominate the 160 m long frieze that is placed on top of the walls of the Parthenon.

====Pediments====
Special attention was paid to the decoration of the pediments, not least because of their size and frontal position. Pedimental sculpture was originally in massive relief figures, as in the earliest to survive, from shortly after 600, on the temple of Artemis at Kerkyra, where the west pediment is taken up by the gorgon Medusa and her children at the centre, flanked by panthers. Smaller scenes are displayed in the low corners of the pediments, including Zeus with a thunderbolt, fighting a Giant.

The pedimental sculpture of the first peripteral temple on the Athenian Acropolis, from , is nearly free-standing sculpture, but remains dominated by a central scene of fighting lions. Again, the corners contain separate scenes, including Heracles fighting Triton. After the mid-6th century, the compositional scheme changes: animal scenes are now placed in the corners, soon they disappear entirely. The central composition is now taken over by mythological fights or by rows of human figures, and the figures become free-standing, as in the Elgin Marbles from the Parthenon.

The high regard in which the Greeks held pedimental sculptures is demonstrated by the discovery of the sculptures from the Late Archaic temple of Apollo at Delphi, which had received a veritable burial after the temple&#x27;s destruction in 373. The themes of the individual pedimental scenes are increasingly dominated by myths connected with the locality. Thus, the east pediment at Olympia depicts the preparations for a chariot race between Pelops and Oinomaos, the mythical king of nearby Pisa. It is the foundation myth of the sanctuary itself, displayed here in its most prominent position. A similarly direct association is provided by the birth of Athena on the east pediment of the Parthenon, or the struggle for Attica between her and Poseidon on its west pediment. The pediment of the later temple of the Kabeiroi at Samothrace, late 3rd century, depicted a probably purely local legend, of no major interest to Greece as a whole.

====Roofs====

The roofs were crowned by &quot;acroteria&quot;, originally in the form of elaborately painted clay disks, from the 6th century onwards as fully sculpted figures placed on the corners and ridges of the pediments. They could depict bowls and tripods, griffins, sphinxes, and especially mythical figures and deities. For example, depictions of the running Nike crowned the Alcmaeonid temple of Apollo at Delphi, and mounted amazons formed the corner of the temple of Asklepios in Epidauros. Pausanias (5, 10, 8) describes bronze tripods forming the corner and statues of Nike by Paeonios forming the ridge ones on the Temple of Zeus at Olympia.

====Columns====
For the sake of completeness, a further potential bearer of sculptural decoration should be mentioned here: the of the Ionic temples at Ephesos and Didyma. Here, already on the Archaic temples, the lower parts of the column shafts were decorated by protruding relief decorations, originally depicting rows of figures, replaced on their late Classical and Hellenistic successors with mythological scenes and battles.

== Function and design ==
===Cult statue and ===
The functions of the temple mainly concentrated on the &quot;naos&quot;, the &quot;dwelling&quot; of the cult statue. The elaboration of the temple&#x27;s external aspects served to stress the dignity of the . In contrast, the itself was often finished with some moderation, although by the Roman period some had clearly become rather cluttered with other statues, military trophies and other gifts. Often, the only source of light for and cult statue was the &quot;&quot;&#x27;s frontal door, and oil lamps within. Thus, the interior only received a limited amount of light. Exceptions are found in the temples of Apollo at Bassae and of Athena at Tegea, where the southern wall had a door, potentially allowing more light into the interior. A special situation applies to the temples of the Cyclades, where the roof was usually of marble tiles. Marble roofs also covered the temple of Zeus at Olympia and the Parthenon at Athens. As marble is not entirely opaque, those may have been permeated with a distinctive diffused light.

For cultic reasons, but also to use the light of the rising sun, virtually all Greek temples were oriented with the main door to the east. Another reason for the orientation of temples facing east is because of the west was seen as the entrance to the Underworld, such as seen in the Odyssey. Some exceptions existed, e.g. the west-facing temples of Artemis at Ephesos and at Magnesia on the Maeander, or the north–south oriented temples of Arcadia. Such exceptions are probably connected with cult practice. Study of the soils around temple sites, is evidence that temple sites were chosen with regard to particular deities: for example, amid arable soils for the agricultural deities Dionysos and Demeter, and near rocky soils for the hunter gatherer deities Apollo and Artemis.

The cult image normally took the form of a statue of the deity, typically roughly life-size, but in some cases many times life-size, in early days in wood, marble or terracotta, or in the specially prestigious form of a chryselephantine statue using ivory plaques for the visible parts of the body and gold for the clothes, around a wooden framework. The most famous Greek cult images were of this type, including the Statue of Zeus at Olympia, and Phidias&#x27;s Athena Parthenos in the Parthenon in Athens, both colossal statues now completely lost. Fragments of two chryselephantine statues from Delphi have been excavated. Bronze cult images were less frequent, at least until Hellenistic times.

The acrolith was another composite form, this time a cost-saving one with a wooden body. A &quot;xoanon&quot; was a primitive and symbolic wooden image, perhaps comparable to the Hindu lingam; many of these were retained and revered for their antiquity. Many of the Greek statues well known from Roman marble copies were originally temple cult images, which in some cases, such as the Apollo Barberini, can be credibly identified. A very few actual originals survive, for example the bronze Piraeus Athena (2.35 metres high, including a helmet). The image stood on a base, from the 5th century often carved with reliefs.

====Refinements====

The cult statue was often oriented towards an altar, placed axially in front of the temple. To preserve this connection, the single row of columns often found along the central axis of the in early temples was replaced by two separate rows towards the sides. The central one of the three aisles thereby created was often emphasised as the main one. The dignity of the central aisle of the could be underlined by the use of special elements of design. For example, the oldest known Corinthian capitals are from the &quot;naoi&quot; of Doric temples. The impressiveness of the internal aisle could be emphasised further by having a third row of columns along the back, as is the case at the Parthenon and at the temple of Zeus in Nemea. The Parthenon , also had another impressive feature, namely two tiers of columns atop each other, as did the temple of Aphaia on Aegina. The temple of Athena at Tegea shows another variation, where the two column rows are indicated by half-columns protruding from the side walls and crowned with Corinthian capitals. An early form of this solution can be seen at Bassae, where the central column of the back portico remains free-standing, while the columns along the sides are in fact semi-columns connected with the walls by curved protrusions.

Some famous temples, notably the Parthenon, the Temple of Zeus at Olympia, and the Temple of Asclepius, Epidaurus, had much of the floor occupied by a very shallow pool filled with water (Parthenon) or olive oil at Olympia. All these had chryselephantine images, and Pausanias was perhaps correct to link the Parthenon one with the maintenance of the proper humidity, but they probably increased the light, and perhaps gave it attractive effects of reflections.

====Access====

It used to be thought that access to the of a Greek temple was limited to the priests, and it was entered only rarely by other visitors, except perhaps during important festivals or other special occasions. In recent decades this picture has changed, and scholars now stress the variety of local access rules. Pausanias was a gentlemanly traveller of the 2nd-century AD who declares that the special intention of his travels around Greece was to see cult images, which he usually managed to do.

It was typically necessary to make a sacrifice or gift, and some temples restricted access either to certain days of the year, or by class, race, gender (with either men or women forbidden), or even more tightly. Garlic-eaters were forbidden in one temple, in another women unless they were virgins; restrictions typically arose from local ideas of ritual purity or a perceived whim of the deity. In some places visitors were asked to show they spoke Greek; elsewhere Dorians were not allowed entry. Some temples could only be viewed from the threshold. Some temples are said never to be opened at all. But generally Greeks, including slaves, had a reasonable expectation of being allowed into the . Once inside the it was possible to pray to or before the cult image, and sometimes to touch it; Cicero saw a bronze image of Heracles with its foot largely worn away by the touch of devotees. Famous cult images such as the Statue of Zeus at Olympia functioned as significant visitor attractions.

Sometimes, the divine character of the cult image was stressed even more by removing it further into a separate space within the , the &quot;adyton&quot;. Especially in Magna Graecia, this tradition continued for a long time. Over the decades and centuries, numerous votive offerings could be placed in the , giving it a museum-like character (Pausanias 5, 17).
The back room of the temple, the , usually served as a storage space for cult equipment. It could also hold the temple treasury. For some time, the of the Athenian Parthenon contained the treasury of the Delian League, thus directly protected by the deity. and were often closed off from the by wooden barriers or fences.
Like the , the could serve the display and storage of votives, often placed between the columns. In some cases, votive offerings could also be directly affixed to the columns, as is visible e.g. on the Temple of Hera at Olympia. The could also be used for cult processions, or simply as shelter from the elements, a function emphasised by Vitruvius (III 3, 8f).

== Sponsors, construction and costs ==

===Public and private sponsors===

The sponsors of Greek temples usually belonged to one of two groups: on the one hand public sponsors, including the bodies and institutions that administrated important sanctuaries; on the other hand influential and affluent private sponsors, especially Hellenistic kings. The financial needs were covered by income from taxes or special levies, or by the sale of raw materials like silver. The collection of donations also occurred, especially for supra-regional sanctuaries like Delphi or Olympia. Hellenistic monarchs could appear as private donors in cities outside their immediate sphere of influence and sponsor public buildings, as exemplified by Antiochos IV, who ordered the rebuilding of the Olympieion at Athens. In such cases, the money came from the private treasury of the donor.

===Organization===
Building contracts were advertised after a popular or elected assembly had passed the relevant motion. An appointed committee would choose the winner among the submitted plans. Afterwards, another committee would supervise the building process. Its responsibilities included the advertising and awarding of individual contracts, the practical supervision of the construction, the inspection and acceptance of completed parts, and the paying of wages. The original advert contained all the information necessary to enable a contractor to make a realistic offer for completing the task. Contracts were normally awarded to the competitor offering the most complete service for the cheapest price. In the case of public buildings, the materials were normally provided by the public sponsor, exceptions were clarified in the contract. Contractors were usually only responsible for specific parts of the overall construction, as most businesses were small. Originally, payment was by person and day, but from the 5th century onward, payment by piece or construction stage became common.

===Costs===
The costs could be immense. For example, surviving receipts show that in the rebuilding of the Artemision of Ephesos, a single column cost 40,000 drachmas. Considering that a worker was paid about two drachmas, that equals nearly two million euro (at a modern western European wage scale). Since the overall number of columns required for the design was 120, even this aspect of the building would have caused costs equivalent to those of major projects today (circa 360 million euro).

== Temples of the different architectural orders ==
One of the criteria by which Greek temples are classified is the Classical order chosen as their basic aesthetic principle. This choice, which was rarely entirely free, but normally determined by tradition and local habit, would lead to widely differing rules of design. According to the three major orders, a basic distinction can be made between the Doric, the Ionic and the Corinthian temple.

=== Doric temples ===

The modern image of Greek temple architecture is strongly influenced by the numerous reasonably well-preserved temples of the Doric order. Especially the ruins of Southern Italy and Sicily were accessible to western travellers quite early in the development of Classical studies, e.g. the temples at Paestum, Akragas or Segesta, but the Hephaisteion and the Parthenon of Athens also influenced scholarship and Neoclassical architecture from an early point onward.

====Beginnings====
The beginnings of Greek temple construction in the Doric order can be traced to early in the 7th century BC. With the transition to stone architecture around 600, the order was fully developed; from then on, only details were changed, developed and refined, mostly in the context of solving the challenges posed by the design and construction of monumental temples.

====First monumental temples====
Apart from early forms, occasionally still with apsidal backs and hipped roofs, the first peripteral temples occur quite soon, before 600. An example is Temple C at Thermos, , a , surrounded by a of 5 × 15 columns, its divided in two aisles by a central row of columns. Its entirely Doric entablature is indicated by painted clay plaques, probably early example of metopes, and clay triglyphs. It appears to be the case that all temples erected within the spheres of influence of Corinth and Argos in the 7th century were Doric . The earliest stone columns did not display the simple squatness of the high and late Archaic specimens, but rather mirror the slenderness of their wooden predecessors. Already around 600, the demand of viewability from all sides was applied to the Doric temple, leading to the mirroring of the frontal by an at the back. This early demand continued to affect Doric temples especially in the Greek motherland. Neither the Ionic temples, nor the Doric specimens in Magna Graecia followed this principle. The increasing monumentalisation of stone buildings, and the transfer of the wooden roof construction to the level of the removed the fixed relationship between the and the . This relationship between the axes of walls and columns, almost a matter of course in smaller structures, remained undefined and without fixed rules for nearly a century: the position of the &quot;floated&quot; within the .
====Stone-built temples====

=====The Heraion at Olympia (c. 600 BC)=====
The Heraion of Olympia () exemplifies the transition from wood to stone construction. This building, initially constructed entirely of wood and mudbrick, had its wooden columns gradually replaced with stone ones over time. Like a museum of Doric columns and Doric capitals, it contains examples of all chronological phases, up to the Roman period. One of the columns in the remained wooden at least until the 2nd century AD, when Pausanias described it. This 6 × 16-column temple already called for a solution to the Doric corner conflict. It was achieved through a reduction of the corner intercolumniations the so-called corner contraction. The Heraion is most advanced in regards to the relationship between and , as it uses the solution that became canonical decades later, a linear axis running along the external faces of the outer walls and through the central axis of the associated columns. Its differentiation between wider intercolumnia on the narrow sides and narrower ones on the long sides was also an influential feature, as was the positioning of the columns within the , corresponding with those on the outside, a feature not repeated until the construction of the temple at Bassae 150 years later.

=====Temple of Artemis, Kerkyra (early 6th century BC)=====
The oldest Doric temple entirely built of stone is represented by the early 6th century BC Artemis Temple in Kerkyra (modern Corfu). All parts of this building are bulky and heavy, its columns reach a height of barely five times their bottom diameter and were very closely spaced with an intercolumniation of a single column width. The individual members of its Doric orders all differ considerably from the later canon, although all essential Doric features are present. Its ground plan of 8 by 17 columns, probably pseudoperipteral, is unusual.

=====Archaic Olympieion, Athens=====
Among the Doric temples, the Peisistratid Olympieion at Athens has a special position. Although this building was never completed, its architect apparently attempted to adapt the Ionic . Column drums built into the later foundations indicate that it was originally planned as a Doric temple. Nonetheless, its ground plan follows the Ionic examples of Samos so closely that it would be hard to reconcile such a solution with a Doric triglyph frieze. After the expulsion of Hippias in 510, work on this structure was stopped: Democratic Athens had no desire to continue a monument of tyrannical self-aggrandisation.

====Classical period: canonisation====
Apart from this exception and some examples in the more experimental poleis of Greater Greece, the Classical Doric temple type remained the . Its perfection was a priority of artistic endeavour throughout the Classical period.

=====Temple of Zeus, Olympia (460)=====
The canonical solution was found fairly soon by the architect Libon of Elis, who erected the Temple of Zeus at Olympia around 46. With its 6 × 13 columns or 5 × 12 intercolumniations, this temple was designed entirely rationally. Its column bays (axis to axis) measured , a triglyph + metope , a plus the adjacent space () , the tile width of the marble roof was . Its columns are powerful, with only a slight ; the echinus of the capitals is already nearly linear at 45°. All of the superstructure is affected by curvature. The measures exactly 3 × 9 column distances (axis to axis), its external wall faces are aligned with the axes of the adjacent columns.

=====Other canonical Classical temples=====
The Classical proportion, 6 × 13 columns, is taken up by numerous temples, e.g. the Temple of Apollo on Delos (), the Temple of Hephaistos at Athens and the temple of Poseidon on Cape Sounion. A slight variation, with 6 × 12 columns or 5 × 11 intercolumniations occurs as frequently.

=====The Parthenon (450)=====
The Parthenon maintains the same proportion at a larger scale of 8 × 17 columns, but follows the same principles. In spite of the eight columns on its front, the temple is a pure , its external walls align with the axes of the second and seventh columns. In other regards, the Parthenon is distinguished as an exceptional example among the mass of Greek by many distinctive aesthetic solutions in detail.
For example, the of and are shortened so as to form simple pillars. Instead of longer , there are &quot;prostyle&quot; colonnades inside the on the front and back, reflecting Ionic habits. The execution of the , with a western room containing four columns, is also exceptional. The Parthenon&#x27;s Archaic predecessor already contained such a room. All measurements in the Parthenon are determined by the proportion 4:9. It determines column width to column distance, width to length of the stylobate, and of the without . The temple&#x27;s width to height up to the is determined by the reverse proportion 9:4, the same proportion squared, 81:16, determines temple length to height. All of this mathematical rigour is relaxed and loosened by the optical refinements mentioned above, which affect the whole building, from layer to layer, and element to element. 92 sculpted metopes decorate its triglyph frieze: centauromachy, amazonomachy and gigantomachy are its themes. The external walls of the are crowned with a figural frieze surrounding the entire and depicting the Panathenaic procession as well as the Assembly of the Gods. Large format figures decorate the pediments on the narrow sides. This conjunction of strict principles and elaborate refinements makes the Parthenon the paradigmatic Classical temple. The Temple of Hephaistos at Athens, erected shortly after the Parthenon, uses the same aesthetic and proportional principles, without adhering as closely to the 4:9 proportion.
====Late Classical and Hellenistic: changing proportions====
In the 4th century BC, a few Doric temples were erected with 6 × 15 or 6 × 14 columns, probably referring to local Archaic predecessors, e.g. the Temple of Zeus in Nemea and that of Athena in Tegea. Generally, Doric temples followed a tendency to become lighter in their superstructures. Columns became narrower, intercolumniations wider. This shows a growing adjustment to the proportion and weight of Ionic temples, mirrored by a progressive tendency among Ionic temples to become somewhat heavier. In the light of this mutual influence it is not surprising that in the late 4th century BC temple of Zeus at Nemea, the front is emphasised by a two intercolumniations deep, while the is suppressed. Frontality is a key feature of Ionic temples. The emphasis on the already occurred in the slightly older temple of Athena at Tegea, but there it was repeated in the . Both temples continued the tendency towards more richly equipped interiors, in both cases with engaged or full columns of the Corinthian order.

The increasing reduction of the number of columns along the long sides, clearly visible on Ionic temples, is mirrored in Doric constructions. A small temple at Kournó has a of merely 6 × 7 columns, a stylobate of only 8 × 10 m and corners executed as pilasters towards the front. The of monumental Doric temples is merely hinted at here; the function as a simple canopy for the shrine of the cult statue is clear.

====Doric temples in Magna Graecia====
Sicily and Southern Italy hardly participated in these developments. Here, most temple construction took place during the 6th and 5th centuries BC. Later, the Western Greeks showed a pronounced tendency to develop unusual architectural solutions, more or less unthinkable in the mother of their colonies. For example, there are two examples of temples with uneven column numbers at the front, Temple of Hera I at Paestum and Temple of Apollo A at Metapontum. Both temples had fronts of nine columns.

The technical possibilities of the western Greeks, which had progressed beyond those in the motherland, permitted many deviations. For example, innovations regarding the construction of the entablature developed in the west allowed the spanning of much wider spaces than before, leading to some very deep and broad . The often had a depth of two column distances, e.g. at Temple of Hera I, Paestum, and temples C, F and G at Selinus, classifying them as . The only played a subsidiary role, but did occur sometimes, e.g. at the temple of Poseidon in Paestum. Much more frequently, the temples included a separate room at the back end of the , entrance to which was usually forbidden, the &quot;adyton&quot;. In some cases, the was a free-standing structure within the , e.g. temple G in Selinus. If possible, columns inside the were avoided, allowing for open roof constructions of up to 13 m width.

The largest such structure was the Olympieion of Akragas, an 8 × 17 columns , but in many regards an absolutely &quot;un-Greek&quot; structure, equipped with details such as engaged, figural pillars (Telamons), and a partially closed off by walls. With external dimensions of 56 × 113 m, it was the largest Doric building ever to be completed. If the colonies showed remarkable independence and will to experiment in basic terms, they did so even more in terms of detail. For example, the lower surfaces of Doric could be decorated with coffers instead of &quot;mutuli&quot;.

Although a strong tendency to emphasize the front, e.g. through the addition of ramps or stairs with up to eight steps (at Temple C in Selinus), or a depth of 3.5 column distances (temple of Apollo at Syracuse) had become a key principle of design, this was relativised by the broadening of column distances on the long sides, e.g. Temple of Hera I at Paestum. Only in the colonies could the Doric corner conflict be ignored. If South Italian architects tried to solve it, they used a variety of solutions: broadening of the corner metopes or triglyphs, variation of column distance or metopes. In some cases, different solutions were used on the broad and narrow sides of the same building.

=== Ionic temples ===
====Origins====
For the early period, before the 6th century, the term Ionic temple can, at best, designate a temple in the Ionian areas of settlement. No fragments of architecture belonging to the Ionic order have been found from this time. Nonetheless, some early temples in the area already indicate the rational system that was to characterise the Ionic system later on, e.g. the Heraion II on Samos. Thus, even at an early point, the axes of the walls aligned with the column axes, whereas in Doric architecture, the external wall faces do so. The early temples also show no concern for the typical Doric feature of visibility from all sides, they regularly lack an ; the only became widespread in the area in the 4th century. In contrast, from an early point, Ionic temples stress the front by using double porticos. Elongated became a determining element. At the same time, the Ionic temples were characterised by their tendency to use varied and richly decorated surfaces, as well as the widespread use of light-shade contrasts.

====Monumental Ionic temples====

=====The Heraion of Samos=====
As soon as the Ionic order becomes recognisable in temple architecture, it is increased to monumental sizes. The temple in the Heraion of Samos, erected by Rhoikos around 560, is the first known , with outside dimensions of 52 × 105 m. A double portico of 8 × 21 columns enclosed the , the back even had ten columns. The front used differing column distances, with a wider central opening. In proportion to the bottom diameter, the columns reached three times the height of a Doric counterpart. 40 flutings enriched the complex surface structure of the column shafts. Samian column bases were decorated with a sequence of horizontal flutings, but in spite of this playfulness they weighed 1,500 kg a piece. The capitals of this structure were probably still entirely of wood, as was the entablature. Ionic volute capitals survive from the outer of the later rebuilding by Polycrates. The columns of the inner had leaf decoration and no volutes.

=====Cycladic Ionic=====
In the Cyclades, there were early temples entirely built of marble. Volute capitals have not been found associated with these, but their marble entablatures belonged to the Ionic order.

=====The Artemision of Ephesos=====
Roughly beginning with the erection of the older Artemision of Ephesos around 550, the quantity of archaeological remains of Ionic temples increases. The Artemision was planned as a , its architect Theodoros had been one of the builders of the Samian Heraion. With a substructure of 55 × 115 m, the Artemision outscaled all precedents. Its was executed as unroofed internal peristyle courtyard, the so-called . The building was entirely of marble. The temple was considered as one of the seven wonders of the ancient world, which may be justified, considering the efforts involved in its construction.

The columns stood on ephesian bases, 36 of them were decorated with life-sized friezes of human figures at the bottom of the shaft, the so-called . The columns had between 40 and 48 flutings, some of them cut to alternate between a wider and a narrower fluting. The oldest marble architraves of Greek architecture, found at the Artemision, also spanned the widest distances ever achieved in pure stone. The middle architrave block was 8.74 m long and weighed 24 metric tons; it had to be lifted to its final position, 20 m above ground, with a system of pulleys. Like its precedents, the temple used differentiated column widths in the front, and had a higher number of columns at the back. According to ancient sources, Kroisos was one of the sponsors. An inscription referring to his sponsorship was indeed found on one of the columns. The temple was burnt down by Herostratos in 356 BC and reerected soon thereafter. For the replacement, a &quot;crepidoma&quot; of ten or more steps was erected. Older Ionic temples normally lacked a specific visible substructure. This emphasised basis had to be balanced out be a heightened entablature, producing not only a visual contrast to, but also a major weight upon the slender columns.

=====Temple of Apollo at Didyma=====

The temple of Apollo at Didyma near Miletus, begun around 540, was another with open internal courtyard. The interior was structured with powerful pilasters, their rhythm reflecting that of the external . The columns, with 36 flutings, were executed as with figural decoration, like those at Ephesos. Construction ceased around 500, but was restarted in 331 and finally completed in the 2nd century. The enormous costs involved may have been one of the reasons for the long period of construction. The building was the first Ionic temple to follow the Attic tradition of uniform column distances, the frontal differentiation was not practised any more.

=====Temple of Athena Polias, Priene=====

Ionic were usually somewhat smaller and shorter in their dimensions than Doric ones. E.g., the temple of Zeus at Labraunda had only 6 × 8 columns, the temple of Aphrodite in Samothrace only 6 × 9. The temple of Athena Polias at Priene, already considered in antiquity as the classical example of an Ionic temple, has partially survived. It was the first monumental of Ionia, erected between 350 and 330 by Pytheos. It is based on a grid (the exact dimensions of its plinths). The temple had 6 × 11 columns, i.e. a proportion of 5:10 or 1:2 intercolumnia. Walls and columns were aligned axially, according to Ionic tradition. The was of equal depth on all sides, eliminating the usual emphasis on the front, an , integrated into the back of the , is the first proper example in Ionic architecture. The evident rational-mathematical aspect to the design suits Ionic Greek culture, with its strong tradition of natural philosophy. Pytheos was to be of major influence far beyond his lifetime. Hermogenes, who probably came from Priene, was a deserving successor and achieved the final flourish of Ionic architecture around 200 BC.

=====The Artemision of Magnesia=====
One of the projects led by Hermogenes was the Artemision of Magnesia on the Maeander, one of the first . other early include the temple of Aphrodite at Messa on Lesbos, belonging to the age of Hermogenes or earlier, the temple of Apollo Sminthaios on Chryse and the temple of Apollo at Alabanda. The arrangement of the , omitting the interior row of columns while maintaining a with the width of two column distances, produces a massively broadened portico, comparable to the contemporaneous hall architecture. The grid of the temple of Magnesia was based on a square. The was surrounded by 8 × 15 columns or 7 × 14 intercolumniations, i.e. a 1:2 proportion. The consisted of a of four column depths, a four-column , and a two-column . Above the architrave of the , there was a figural frieze of 137 m length, depicting the amazonomachy. Above it lay the dentil, the Ionic and the .

=====Attic Ionic=====
Although Athens and Attica were also ethnically Ionian, the Ionic order was of minor importance in this area. The Temple of Nike Aptera on the Acropolis, a small amphiprostyle temple completed around 420, with Ionic columns on plinthless Attic bases, a triple-layered architrave and a figural frieze, but without the typical Ionic dentil, is notable. The east and north halls of the Erechtheion, completed in 406, follow the same succession of elements.

=====Epidauros=====
An innovative Ionic temple was that of Asklepios in Epidaurus, one of the first of the type. This small ionic prostyle temple had engaged columns along the sides and back, the was thus reduced to a mere hint of a full portico facade.

=====Magna Graecia=====
There is very little evidence of Ionic temples in Magna Graecia. One of the few exceptions is the early Classical Temple D, an 8 × 20-column , at Metapontum. Its architect combined the dentils, typical of Asia Minor, with an Attic frieze, thus proving that the colonies were quite capable of partaking in the developments of the motherland. A small Ionic Hellenistic prostyle temple was found on the Poggetto San Nicola at Agrigento.

=====Hellenistic India=====

Ruins of a provincial Ionic temple with a design very similar to those in the main Greek world survives at Jandial in modern Pakistan. The temple is considered semi-classical, with a plan essentially that of a Greek temple, with a , and an at the back. Two Ionic columns at the front are framed by two &quot;anta&quot; walls as in a Greek distyle in antis layout. It seems that the temple had an outside wall with windows or doorways, in a layout similar to that of a Greek encircling row of columns (peripteral design). It has been called &quot;the most Hellenic structure yet found on Indian soil&quot;.

=== Corinthian temples ===
====Beginnings====
The youngest of the three Classical Greek orders, the Corinthian order came to be used for the external design of Greek temples quite late. After it had proved its adequacy, e.g. on a mausoleum of at modern-day Belevi (near Ephesos), it appears to have found increasing popularity in the last half of the 3rd century. Early examples probably include the Serapeum of Alexandria and a temple at Hermopolis Magna, both erected by Ptolemaios III. A small temple of Athena Limnastis at Messene, definitely Corinthian, is only attested through drawings by early travellers and very scarce fragments. It probably dates to the late 3rd century.

====Examples====

=====Hellenistic Temple of Olympian Zeus, Athens=====
The first dateable and well-preserved presence of the Corinthian temple is the Hellenistic rebuilding of the Olympieion of Athens, planned and started between 175 and 146 BC. This mighty with its 110 × 44 m substructure and 8 × 20 columns was to be one of the largest Corinthian temples ever. Donated by Antiochus IV Epiphanes, it combined all elements of the Asian/Ionic order with the Corinthian capital. Its Asian elements and its conception as a made the temple an exception in Athens.

=====Olba=====
Around the middle of the 2nd century BC, a 6 × 12-column Corinthian was built in Olba-Diokaisarea in Rugged Cilicia. Its columns, mostly still upright, stand on Attic bases without plinths, exceptional for the period. The 24 flutings of the columns are only indicated by facets in the lower third. Each of the Corinthian capitals is made of three separate parts, an exceptional form. The entablature of the temple was probably in the Doric order, as is suggested by fragments of scattered among the ruins. All of these details suggest an Alexandrian workshop, since Alexandria showed the greatest tendency to combine Doric entablatures with Corinthian capitals and to do without the plinth under Attic bases.

=====Temple of Hekate at Lagina=====
A further plan option is shown by the temple of Hekate at Lagina, a small of 8 × 11 columns. Its architectural members are entirely in keeping with the Asian/Ionic canon. Its distinctive feature, a rich figural frieze, makes this building, erected around 100 BC, an architectural gem. Further late Greek temples in the Corinthian order are known e.g. at Mylasa and, on the middle gymnasium terrace at Pergamon.

====Distinctive uses of Corinthian temples, influence====
The few Greek temples in the Corinthian order are almost always exceptional in form or ground plan and are initially usually an expression of royal patronage. The Corinthian order permitted a considerable increase of the material and technical effort invested in a building, which made its use attractive for the purposes of royals&#x27; self-aggrandisement. The demise of the Hellenistic monarchies and the increasing power of Rome and her allies placed mercantile elites and sanctuary administrations in the positions of building sponsors. The construction of Corinthian temples became a typical expression of self-confidence and independence. As an element of Roman architecture, the Corinthian temple came to be widely distributed in all of the Graeco-Roman world, especially in Asia Minor, until the late Imperial period.

==Surviving remains==
Though extremely solidly built, apart from the roof, relatively few Greek temples have left very significant remains; these are often those which were converted to other uses such as churches or mosques. There are many where the platforms are reasonably complete, and some round drum elements of the columns, which were harder for later builders to re-use. The somewhat controversial practice of anastylosis, or re-erecting fallen materials, has sometimes been used. The rectangular wall blocks have usually been carried off for re-use, and some buildings have been destroyed or weakened merely to get the bronze pins linking blocks. Marble sculpture has often been removed to make lime for mortar, and any that has survived has usually been removed to a museum, not always a local one.

The most complete remains are concentrated in Athens and southern Italy; several are described in more detail above, under their orders. Athens has the Parthenon and the even better preserved Doric Temple of Hephaestus, both once churches, as well two small temples on the Acropolis and a corner of the large Corinthian Temple of Olympian Zeus. The small temple of Apollo Epicurius at Bassae survived in a rural location with most of its columns and main architrave blocks in place, amid a jumble of fallen stone. From this British antiquaries extracted the Bassae Frieze in 1812, which was soon in the British Museum.

In Italy, Paestum, some way south of Naples near what was once the northern limit of Magna Graecia (Greek Italy), has three early Doric temples in a row, amid the mostly Roman ruins of the city. In Sicily the Valle dei Templi near Agrigento has an even larger group, with the main structure of the Temple of Concordia especially well-preserved. Along the coast Selinunte was destroyed about 250 BC by the Carthaginians and has the tumbled ruins of five temples, of which one has been rebuilt from the original material. Not far away, Segesta has a single Doric temple whose main structure is largely intact.

<text>The Wason selection task (or four-card problem) is a logic puzzle devised by Peter Cathcart Wason in 1966. It is one of the most famous tasks in the study of deductive reasoning. An example of the puzzle is:
A response that identifies a card that need not be inverted, or that fails to identify a card that needs to be inverted, is incorrect. The original task dealt with numbers (even, odd) and letters (vowels, consonants).

The test is of special interest because people have a hard time solving it in most scenarios but can usually solve it correctly in certain contexts. In particular, researchers have found that the puzzle is readily solved when the imagined context is policing a social rule.

==Solution==
The correct response is to turn over the 8 card and the red card.

The rule was &quot;&quot;If&quot; the card shows an even number on one face, &quot;then&quot; its opposite face is blue.&quot; Only a card with both an even number on one face &quot;and&quot; something other than blue on the other face can invalidate this rule:
* If the 3 card is blue (or red), that doesn&#x27;t violate the rule. The rule makes no claims about odd numbers. (Denying the antecedent)
* If the 8 card is not blue, it violates the rule. (&quot;Modus ponens&quot;)
* If the blue card is odd (or even), that doesn&#x27;t violate the rule. The blue color is not exclusive to even numbers. (Affirming the consequent)
* If the red card is even, it violates the rule. (&quot;Modus tollens&quot;)

===Use of logic===
The interpretation of &quot;if&quot; here is that of the material conditional in classical logic, so this problem can be solved by choosing the cards using modus ponens (all even cards must be checked to ensure they are blue) and modus tollens (all non-blue cards must be checked to ensure they are non-even).

One experiment revolving around the Wason four card problem found many influences on people&#x27;s selection in this task experiment that were not based on logic. The non-logical inferences made by the participants from this experiment demonstrate the possibility and structure of extra logical reasoning mechanisms. 

Alternatively, one might solve the problem by using another reference to zeroth-order logic. In classical propositional logic, the material conditional is false if and only if its antecedent is true and its consequent is false. As an implication of this, two cases need to be inspected in the selection task to check whether we are dealing with a false conditional:

* The case in which the antecedent is true (the even card), to examine whether the consequent is false (the opposite face is &quot;not&quot; blue). 

* The case in which the consequent is false (the red card), to study whether the antecedent is true (the opposite face is even).

==Explanations of performance on the task==
In Wason&#x27;s study, not even 10% of subjects found the correct solution, which for the specific criteria of this problem, would be 8 card and the red card. This result was replicated in 1993. The poor success rate of this selection experiment may be explained by its lack of relevant significance. If this task was reframed, however, empirical evidence has shown an increase in logical responses.

Some authors have argued that participants do not read &quot;if... then...&quot; as the material conditional, since the natural language conditional is not the material conditional. (See also the paradoxes of the material conditional for more information.) However one interesting feature of the task is how participants react when the classical logic solution is explained:

Wason also ascribes participants&#x27; errors on this selection task due to confirmation bias. Confirmation bias compels people to seek the cards which confirm the rule; meanwhile, they overlook the main purpose of the experiment, which is to purposefully choose the cards that potentially disconfirm the rule.

===Policing social rules===

As of 1983, experimenters had identified that success on the Wason selection task was highly context-dependent, but there was no theoretical explanation for which contexts elicited mostly correct responses and which ones elicited mostly incorrect responses.

Evolutionary psychologists Leda Cosmides and John Tooby (1992) identified that the selection task tends to produce the &quot;correct&quot; response when presented in a context of social relations. For example, if the rule used is &quot;If you are drinking alcohol, then you must be over 18&quot; or in other words &quot;If you are not over 18, then you must not drink alcohol&quot;, and the cards have an age on one side and beverage on the other, e.g., &quot;16&quot;, &quot;drinking beer&quot;, &quot;25&quot;, &quot;drinking soda&quot;, most people have no difficulty in selecting the correct cards (&quot;16” and &quot;drinking beer&quot;). In a series of experiments in different contexts, subjects demonstrated consistent superior performance when asked to police a social rule involving a benefit that was only legitimately available to someone who had qualified for that benefit. Cosmides and Tooby argued that experimenters have ruled out alternative explanations, such as that people learn the rules of social exchange through practice and find it easier to apply these familiar rules than less-familiar rules.

According to Cosmides and Tooby, this experimental evidence supports the hypothesis that a Wason task proves to be easier if the rule to be tested is one of social exchange (&quot;in order to receive benefit X you need to fulfill condition Y&quot;) and the subject is asked to police the rule, but is more difficult otherwise. They argued that such a distinction, if empirically borne out, would support the contention of evolutionary psychologists that human reasoning is governed by context-sensitive mechanisms that have evolved, through natural selection, to solve specific problems of social interaction, rather than context-free, general-purpose mechanisms. In this case, the module is described as a specialized cheater-detection module.

==== Evaluation of social relations hypothesis ====
Davies et al. (1995) have argued that Cosmides and Tooby&#x27;s argument in favor of context-sensitive, domain-specific reasoning mechanisms as opposed to general-purpose reasoning mechanisms is theoretically incoherent and inferentially unjustified. Von Sydow (2006) has argued that we have to distinguish deontic and descriptive conditionals, but that the logic of testing deontic conditionals is more systematic (see Beller, 2001) and depend on one&#x27;s goals (see Sperber &amp; Girotto, 2002). However, in response to Kanazawa (2010), Kaufman et al. (2011) gave 112 subjects a 70-item computerized version of the contextualized Wason card-selection task proposed by Cosmides and Tooby (1992) and found instead that &quot;performance on non-arbitrary, evolutionarily familiar problems is more strongly related to general intelligence than performance on arbitrary, evolutionarily novel problems&quot;, and writing for &quot;Psychology Today&quot;, Kaufman concluded instead that &quot;It seems that general intelligence is very much compatible with evolutionary psychology.&quot;

<text>A wildflower (or wild flower) is a flower that grows in the wild, rather than being intentionally seeded or planted. The term implies that the plant is neither a hybrid nor a selected cultivar that is any different from the native plant, even if it is growing where it would not naturally be found. The term can refer to the whole plant, even when not in bloom, and not just the flower.

&quot;Wildflower&quot; is an imprecise term. More exact terms include:
* native species naturally occurring in the area (see flora)
* exotic or introduced species not native to the area, including
** invasive species that out-compete other plants, whether native or not
** imported (introduced to an area whether deliberately or accidentally)
** naturalized (imported, but come to be considered by the public as native)

In the United Kingdom, the organization Plantlife International instituted the &quot;County Flowers scheme&quot; in 2002; see County flowers of the United Kingdom for which members of the public nominated and voted for a wildflower emblem for their county. The aim was to spread awareness of the heritage of native species and about the need for conservation, as some of these species are endangered. For example, Somerset has adopted the cheddar pink (&quot;Dianthus gratianopolitanus&quot;), London the rosebay willowherb (&quot;Chamerion angustifolium&quot;) and Denbighshire/Sir Ddinbych in Wales the rare limestone woundwort (&quot;Stachys alpina&quot;).

<doc id="823254" wikidata="Q17081865" url="?curid=823254" title="Ralston Purina">
<text>Ralston Purina Company was a St. Louis, Missouri,–based American conglomerate with substantial holdings in animal feed, food, pet food, consumer products, and entertainment. On December 12, 2001, it merged with Swiss food-giant Nestlé&#x27;s Friskies division to form Nestlé Purina PetCare Company.

==History==
Ralston Purina (originally Ralston-Purina) traces its roots to 1894, when founder William H. Danforth established the animal feed company Purina Mills. Danforth formed a partnership with George Robinson; William Andrews entered the business of feeding farm animals by founding the Robinson-Danforth Commission Company. Its predominant brand for each animal was generally referred to as &quot;Chow&quot;; hence &quot;Purina Horse Chow&quot;, &quot;Purina Dog Chow&quot;, &quot;Purina Cat Chow&quot;, &quot;Purina Rabbit Chow&quot;, &quot;Purina Pig Chow&quot;, and &quot;Purina Monkey Chow&quot;.

Later, the company began producing cereal, which received endorsement by Webster Edgerly, founder of Ralstonism, to market Ralston breakfast cereals. Edgerly was at the time promoting the consumption of whole-grain cereal. These cereals became so successful that the name of the enterprise was changed in 1902 to the Ralston-Purina Company.

In 1986, Ralston Purina sold Purina Mills, its US animal feed business, to British Petroleum. Purina Mills is now owned by Land O&#x27;Lakes. In 1994, the Ralston &quot;human food&quot; operations of the Ralston Purina Company were spun off into a new company called Ralcorp Holdings. In 1998, Ralston Purina spun off its international animal feed business as Agribrands, which was acquired by Cargill in 2001. The animal feed businesses continue to use the Purina and Chow brands, which Purina Mills and Cargill license for use in the US and internationally, respectively.

===Merger with Nestlé===
Ralston Purina became the subject of an acquisition bid by Swiss-based Nestlé, whose Friskies brand was the other leading US brand of pet food. Nestlé S.A. and Ralston Purina announced in January 2001 a definitive merger agreement. Under the agreement, Nestlé acquired all of Ralston Purina&#x27;s (NYSE: RAL) outstanding shares for US$33.50 per share in cash. The offer represented a premium of 36% over the closing price on Friday, January 12, 2001. The transaction had an enterprise value of US$10.3 billion ($10.0 billion equity plus $1.2 billion of net debt, minus $0.9 billion of financial investments).

Several brands of pet food (e.g., &quot;Meow Mix&quot;) had to be divested separately to meet antitrust concerns. Purina brands are now made and marketed by a division of Nestlé (Nestlé Purina PetCare) which is still headquartered in St. Louis.

While primarily a pet-food company, Ralston Purina also made some other pet-related products, such as Tidy Cats brand and Yesterday&#x27;s News cat litter, which is made from recycled newspaper, purchased from Edward Lowe Industries in 1990. Also, Purina has honoured several Canadian animals every year since 1968 in their Animal Hall of Fame. The latest inductees included a police service dog which &quot;rushed and subdued an armed robber&quot;.

==Acquisitions and diversifications==

In 1974, Ralston Purina purchased and further developed the Keystone ski resort in Colorado. &quot;Checkerboard Flats&quot; for kids and beginners at Keystone still bears their logo. In 1993, Ralston Purina also bought Breckenridge ski area for an undisclosed amount, from Victoria U.S.A. Inc, a Japanese sporting goods retailer. However, both ski resorts were sold in 1997 to Vail Resorts for $331 million.

In 1977, Ralston Purina acquired Missouri Arena Corporation and the St. Louis Blues National Hockey League franchise. During the company&#x27;s ownership of the team, they changed the name of the St. Louis Arena to the Checkerdome, reflecting the Ralston Purina logo. The franchise was sold to Harry Ornest on July 27, 1983.

Ralston Purina purchased the Eveready Battery Company in 1986, owner of the Eveready and Energizer brands. The company was spun off in 2000.

Ralston Purina purchased Continental Baking Company, makers of Wonder bread and Hostess cakes, from ITT in 1984. Ralston spun off Continental Baking Company, subsequently bought by Irving, Texas–based Interstate Brands Corporation (IBC).

Ralston Purina opened test market pizza stores called Checkerboard Pizza in 1986. The format was similar to Domino&#x27;s and Little Caesars. They opened the stores in markets such as Moorhead, Minnesota, to test how the Midwestern market would accept the concept. They did well, but Ralston Purina decided not to enter the pizza franchise business and closed all pilots by late 1987.

Ralston Purina also owned Jack in the Box fast food restaurants from 1968 to 1985, along with several high-end restaurants.

Ralston Purina owned Van Camp Sea Food Company from 1963 to 1988, a tuna cannery with Chicken of the Sea as its main product.

Ralston Purina owned an animal pharmaceutical company in the 1970s and 1980s.

Protein Technologies International was a wholly-owned subsidiary of Ralston Purina making soy protein products since 1958. It was purchased by DuPont in 1997 for $1.554 billion and later became Solae.

==Logo==
Ralston Purina&#x27;s &quot;checkerboard&quot; trademark was introduced in 1902. It was inspired by William Danforth&#x27;s childhood memory of a family dressed in clothing made from the same bolt of checkerboard cloth. The company&#x27;s headquarters was called Checkerboard Square. Danforth used the design as the visualization of a concept put forth in his book &quot;I Dare You&quot;, in which he proposed that four key components in life (&quot;Physical&quot;, &quot;Mental&quot;, &quot;Social&quot;, and &quot;Religious&quot;) need to be in balance, and one area was not to develop at the expense of the others. In 1921, the design inspired the design of feed that was pressed in cubes, called &quot;checkers&quot;.

<text>John Holland Cazale (; August 12, 1935 – March 13, 1978) was an American actor. He appeared in five films over seven years, each of which was nominated for the Academy Award for Best Picture at their respective awards ceremonies. Cazale started as a theater actor in New York City, ranging from regional, to off-Broadway, to Broadway acting alongside Al Pacino, Meryl Streep and Sam Waterston. Cazale soon became one of Hollywood&#x27;s premier character actors, starting with his role as the doomed, weak-minded Fredo Corleone opposite longtime friend Pacino in Francis Ford Coppola&#x27;s &quot;The Godfather&quot; (1972) and &quot;The Godfather Part II&quot; (1974). He then appeared in Coppola&#x27;s &quot;The Conversation&quot; (1974) and Sidney Lumet&#x27;s &quot;Dog Day Afternoon&quot; (1975), the latter of which earned him a Golden Globe Award nomination. In 1977, Cazale was diagnosed with lung cancer, but chose to complete his role in &quot;The Deer Hunter&quot; (1978). He died shortly after, in New York City on March 13, 1978.

Theatrical producer Joseph Papp called Cazale &quot;an amazing intellect, an extraordinary person and a fine, dedicated artist&quot;. David Thomson writes that &quot;It is the lives and works of people like John Cazale that make filmgoing worthwhile.&quot; A documentary tribute to Cazale, &quot;I Knew It Was You&quot;, was screened at the 2009 Sundance Film Festival featuring interviews with Pacino, Streep, Robert De Niro, Gene Hackman, Richard Dreyfuss, Francis Ford Coppola, Sidney Lumet and Steve Buscemi.

== Early life ==
Cazale was born in Revere, Massachusetts, the son of Cecilia Cazale. He had an older sister, Catherine, and a younger brother, Stephen. He grew up in Winchester and attended high school at the Buxton School in Williamstown where he joined the drama club. He studied drama at Oberlin College in Ohio, transferring to Boston University, where he studied under Peter Kass.

== Career ==
=== Theatre career ===
Upon graduation, Cazale worked as a cab driver, as he started his theatrical career at the Charles Playhouse in Boston, appearing in &quot;Hotel Paradiso&quot; and &quot;Our Town&quot; in 1959. Reviewing his performance as George Gibbs in &quot;Our Town,&quot; critic Jean Pierre Frankenhuis said: &quot;[Cazale&#x27;s] portrayal is absolutely stupendous, hilarious, touching, thrilling. We found ourselves wishing that there were more scenes with him, such is the enjoyable performance he gives: a comedian of the first order!&quot;. Cazale moved to New York City and supported himself as a photographer while looking for acting work. He made one of his first appearances there in the Equity Library&#x27;s production of Sidney Howard&#x27;s &quot;Paths of Glory&quot;.

An Off-Broadway production of Archibald MacLeish&#x27;s &quot;J.B.&quot; by the Equity Library Theatre followed on March 17, 1962, at the Master Theatre. He also acted in a 1962 short film titled &quot;The American Way&quot;, directed by Marvin Starkman.

In 1965, Cazale was part of the National Tour of Lorraine Hansberry&#x27;s &quot;The Sign in Sidney Brustein&#x27;s Window&quot;.

He worked as a messenger at Standard Oil, where he met Al Pacino, another aspiring actor. Pacino recalled: &quot;When I first saw John, I instantly thought he was so interesting. Everybody was always around him because he had a very congenial way of expressing himself.&quot; In 1966, the two were cast in a play by Israel Horovitz, &quot;The Indian Wants the Bronx&quot;, playing at the Eugene O&#x27;Neill Theatre Center in Waterford, Connecticut. They reprised their roles in 1968 at the Off-Broadway Astor Place Theatre, for which they both won Obie Awards. That same year, Cazale won another Obie for his role as Dolan in Horovitz&#x27;s &quot;Line&quot;.

In 1968, Cazale appeared in his only television role, playing Tom Andrews in the episode &quot;The Peep Freak&quot; on the cop drama &quot;&quot;N.Y.P.D.&quot;&quot;

In 1969, Cazale joined the Long Wharf Theatre Company, where he appeared for the next three seasons in a number of productions, including &quot;Tartuffe, The Country People, The Skin of Our Teeth, The Iceman Cometh&quot;, and &quot;You Can&#x27;t Take It With You&quot;.

Cazale reprised his role in &quot;Line&quot; in a 1971 production at the Theatre De Lys (now the Lucille Lortel Theatre). Appearing with him were Richard Dreyfuss as Stephen, Barnard Hughes as Arnall, John Randolph as Fleming, and Ann Wedgeworth as Molly. During this run, Cazale was spotted by casting director Fred Roos, who then suggested him to director Francis Ford Coppola for the role of Fredo Corleone in &quot;The Godfather&quot; (1972).

=== Film career ===
==== &quot;The Godfather&quot; films (1972–74) ====
&quot;The Godfather&quot; was Cazale&#x27;s feature film debut. The film&#x27;s star, Marlon Brando, was one of Cazale&#x27;s idols. The film broke box office records and made Cazale and several other previously unknown co-stars famous. Coppola, impressed with Cazale&#x27;s abilities in the small role, wrote the part of Stan for him in his next film, &quot;The Conversation&quot; (1974), in which he co-starred with Gene Hackman. In 1974, he reprised his role as Fredo Corleone, now significantly expanded, in &quot;The Godfather Part II&quot;. Bruce Fretts, in &quot;Entertainment Weekly&quot;, wrote that &quot;Cazale makes his character’s wounded pride hauntingly palpable&quot;.

==== &quot;Dog Day Afternoon&quot; (1975) ====
He again starred alongside Pacino in Sidney Lumet&#x27;s 1975 film &quot;Dog Day Afternoon&quot;. The film&#x27;s screenwriter Frank Pierson said &quot;the film had been cast with many of the actors that Al Pacino had worked with in New York, including John Cazale, who was a close friend and collaborator in &quot;The Godfather&quot;&quot;. For his role as Sal he was nominated for the Golden Globe Award for Best Supporting Actor. Sidney Lumet declared:
=== Return to theatre ===
==== Public theatre (1975–76)====
While achieving success in film, Cazale&#x27;s commitment to the stage continued. In addition to his work with the Long Wharf Theatre, he appeared in a number of plays by Israel Horovitz. In May 1975, he returned to the Charles Playhouse to support Pacino in &quot;The Resistible Rise of Arturo Ui&quot;. Ross Wetzston of &quot;The Village Voice&quot;, reporting on the production, said Cazale &quot;may be the finest actor in America today&quot;. In 1976, ten years after their first collaboration, Cazale and Pacino appeared together for the final time in the Public Theatre&#x27;s production of &quot;The Local Stigmatic&quot;.

==== &quot;Measure for Measure&quot; (1976) ====
In the summer of that year, Cazale starred at the Delacorte Theatre in Central Park with Sam Waterston in Shakespeare&#x27;s &quot;Measure for Measure&quot;. His leading lady was the recent Yale School of Drama graduate Meryl Streep. Mel Gussow of &quot;The New York Times&quot; wrote: &quot;Mr. Cazale, often cast as a quirky, weak outsider, as in &quot;The Godfather&quot;, here demonstrates sterner mettle as a quietly imperious Angelo who sweeps down, vulturelike, to deposit virtue.&quot; During the run of the play, Cazale and Streep began a romance and moved in together. Streep humorously praised her co-star&#x27;s abilities by saying, &quot;The jerk made everything mean something.&quot; Then she added, &quot;Such good judgment, such uncluttered thought!&quot;.

==== &quot;Agamemnon&quot; (1977) ====
Cazale&#x27;s final stage appearance was on April 29, 1977, in the title role of &quot;Agamemnon&quot; at the Vivian Beaumont Theatre. He appeared only in the first preview. After the performance, he took ill and withdrew from the show. It was his only Broadway performance. Shortly afterwards, he was diagnosed with lung cancer.

=== Final film role: &quot;The Deer Hunter&quot; (1978) ===
Despite the terminal diagnosis, Cazale continued work with his romantic partner, Meryl Streep, along with Robert De Niro, Christopher Walken, and John Savage in &quot;The Deer Hunter&quot;. According to author Andy Dougan, director Michael Cimino &quot;rearranged the shooting schedule with Cazale and Streep&#x27;s consent, so that he could film all his scenes first&quot;. He completed his scenes, but died before the film was released. Cazale was considered all but uninsurable due to his illness, jeopardizing his participation in the film, but according to Streep the costs were paid by De Niro, who wanted Cazale to be in it.

== Death==
Cazale was diagnosed with lung cancer in 1977 which was likely related to his history of chain smoking. Despite trying a number of treatments and protocols, he rapidly declined as the cancer metastasized to his bones. On March 13, 1978, Cazale died at the age of 42. Meryl Streep was at his side, as the actress had been throughout his illness. Close friend and &quot;Godfather&quot; co-star Al Pacino said &quot;I&#x27;ve hardly ever seen a person [Streep] so devoted to someone who is falling away like John was. To see her in that act of love for this man was overwhelming.&quot; Pacino later lamented that Cazale was not better recognized for his skill, saying that Cazale &quot;was one of the great actors of our time—that time, any time&quot;.

His close friend and frequent collaborator, Israel Horovitz, wrote a eulogy, published in &quot;The Village Voice&quot; on March 27, 1978. In it, he said:

John Cazale happens once in a lifetime. He was an invention, a small perfection. It is no wonder his friends feel such anger upon waking from their sleep to discover that Cazale sleeps on with kings and counselors, with Booth and Kean, with Jimmy Dean, with Bernhardt, Guitry, and Duse, with Stanislavsky, with Groucho, Benny, and Allen. He will make fast friends in his new place. He is easy to love.

Cazale was buried at Holy Cross Cemetery in Malden, Massachusetts.

===Theatre credits===
== Awards and nominations ==
Cazale was awarded twice for &quot;Distinguished Performance&quot; by the Off-Broadway Obie Awards in the 1967−1968 season for his performances in Israel Horovitz&#x27;s plays &quot;The Indian Wants the Bronx&quot; and &quot;Line&quot;. His only major film acting recognition came in 1976, when he was nominated for a Golden Globe for Best Supporting Actor for &quot;Dog Day Afternoon&quot;. He lost to Richard Benjamin, who won the award for his work in &quot;The Sunshine Boys&quot;.

Although Cazale never received an Oscar nomination, according to Bruce Fretts, he &quot;was the walking embodiment of the aphorism, &#x27;acting is reacting&#x27;, providing the perfect counterbalance to his recurring co-stars, the more emotionally volatile Al Pacino and Robert De Niro&quot;. Cazale had learned to put the lack of recognition into context. While filming &quot;The Deer Hunter&quot;, he said to &quot;Pittsburgh Press&quot; reporter Edward L. Blank: If you have any inclination toward paranoia, that sort of thing will bring it out in you. You say to yourself, &quot;What do I have to do to get recognition of that sort?&quot; Then you put it back into perspective and ask yourself how much that or any award really matters.

== Legacy ==

Cazale was described by those close to him to be &quot;often shy&quot; and &quot;very emotionally sensitive&quot;. He collaborated with a number of artists repeatedly: Israel Horovitz dedicated the entire cycle of his &quot;Wakefield Plays&quot; to Cazale&#x27;s memory, saying he &quot;played in most of my plays, from 67–77, including &quot;Alfred the Great&quot; and &quot;Our Father&#x27;s Failing&quot;&quot;. Directors James Hammerstein and Arvin Brown used him multiple times. He did two plays for Joseph Papp. Francis Ford Coppola was responsible for the majority of Cazale&#x27;s film roles, having cast him three times. Meryl Streep acted with him twice. Close friend and frequent co-star Al Pacino collaborated with him six times: on three films and three stage productions. Pacino once commented: &quot;All I wanted to do was work with John for the rest of my life. He was my acting partner.&quot;

In an interview celebrating &quot;The Godfather&quot; 50th anniversary, when asked about actors that did not get enough credit, Al Pacino said:John Cazale, in general, was one of the great actors of our time — that time, any time. I learned so much from him. I had done a lot of theater and three films with him. He was inspiring, he just was. And he didn&#x27;t get credit for any of it. He was in five films, all Oscar-nominated films, and he was great in all of them. He was particularly great in &quot;Godfather II&quot; and I don&#x27;t think he got that kind of recognition.

In following generations, celebrated actors such as Philip Seymour Hoffman, Steve Buscemi, Sam Rockwell, and Michael Fassbender named Cazale as an influence.

&quot;The Boston Globe&quot; asked: &quot;Why was Cazale so influential? In part, it was because of his commitment to the craft of acting.&quot; To Streep, he was &quot;monomaniacal&quot;, which had an effect on his co-stars, who were then &quot;challenged to take their own games up a notch&quot;.

Cazale has a theater named after him, the McGinn/Cazale Theatre (currently inhabited by the company Second Stage Theatre), located at 2162 Broadway at 76th Street in New York City. The theatre is co-named for Cazale and his friend, the actor Walter McGinn, who had died in a car accident in 1977. The theatre was dedicated on March 12, 1984.

His life and career were profiled in the documentary film, &quot;I Knew It Was You&quot;, directed by Richard Shepard, which premiered at the 2009 Sundance Film Festival.

All five of the films that he starred in would later be selected for preservation in the U.S. National Film Registry of the Library of Congress.

== Notes ==
: Cazale died at approximately 3 a.m. on Monday, March 13, 1978, which is the date on his gravestone and confirmed by his brother, Stephen. His date of death has been commonly reported as March 12, 1978, due to contemporary newspaper reports referencing his death occurring on &quot;Sunday night&quot;.

<text>Aq Bars (or &quot;Ak Bars&quot;) (; ) is the emblem of Tatarstan. It is an ancient Bulgar symbol translated as &quot;White Leopard&quot; or &quot;Snow Leopard&quot;, and has been in use since 1991 as the official symbol of Tatarstan.

Historically, this symbol was used in Volga Bulgaria and the Khanate of Kazan (Qazan) – predecessors of Tatarstan – as a state symbol. The snow leopard symbol comes from the totems of one of the Bulgar tribes – the Barsil. According to legend, the Barsils founded Bilär in Volga Bulgaria.

The creator of the current emblem is the artist Rif Fäxretdinov (Риф Фәхретдинов).

<doc id="823302" wikidata="Q2917177" url="?curid=823302" title="Littlewood's law">
<text>Littlewood&#x27;s law states that a person can expect to experience events with odds of one in a million (referred to as a &quot;miracle&quot;) at the rate of about one per month. It is named after the British mathematician John Edensor Littlewood.

It seeks, among other things, to debunk one element of supposed supernatural phenomenology and is related to the more general law of truly large numbers, which states that with a sample size large enough, any outrageous (in terms of probability model of single sample) thing is likely to happen.

==History==
An early formulation of the law appears in the 1953 collection of Littlewood&#x27;s work, &quot;A Mathematician&#x27;s Miscellany&quot;. In the chapter &quot;Large Numbers&quot;, Littlewood states:
:Improbabilities are apt to be overestimated. It is true that I should have been surprised in the past to learn that Professor Hardy [an atheist] had joined the Oxford Group [a Christian organization]. But one could not say the adverse chance was 106 : 1. Mathematics is a dangerous profession; an appreciable proportion of us go mad, and then this particular event would be quite likely. [...] I sometimes ask the question: what is the most remarkable coincidence you have experienced, and is it, for &quot;the&quot; most remarkable one, remarkable? (With a lifetime to choose from, 106 : 1 is a mere trifle.)
Littlewood uses these remarks to illustrate that seemingly unlikely coincidences can be expected over long periods. He provides several anecdotes about improbable events that, given enough time, are likely to occur. For example, in the game of bridge, the probability that a player will be dealt 13 cards of the same suit is extremely low (Littlewood calculates it as formula_1). While such a deal might seem miraculous, if one estimates that formula_2 people in England each play an average of 30 bridge hands a week, it becomes quite expected that such a &quot;miracle&quot; would happen approximately once per year.

This statement was later reformulated as Littlewood&#x27;s law of miracles by Freeman Dyson, in a 2004 review of the book &quot;Debunked! ESP, Telekinesis, and Other Pseudoscience&quot;, published in the &quot;New York Review of Books&quot;:

:The paradoxical feature of the laws of probability is that they make unlikely events happen unexpectedly often. A simple way to state the paradox is Littlewood’s law of miracles. John Littlewood [...] defined a miracle as an event that has special importance when it occurs, but occurs with a probability of one in a million. This definition agrees with our commonsense understanding of the word “miracle.”
:Littlewood’s law of miracles states that in the course of any normal person’s life, miracles happen at a rate of roughly one per month. The proof of the law is simple. During the time that we are awake and actively engaged in living our lives, roughly for 8 hours each day, we see and hear things happening at a rate of about one per second. So the total number of events that happen to us is about 30,000 per day, or about a million per month. With few exceptions, these events are not miracles because they are insignificant. The chance of a miracle is about one per million events. Therefore we should expect about one miracle to happen, on the average, every month.

<doc id="823303" wikidata="Q1973240" url="?curid=823303" title="Rising Sun (Crichton novel)">
<text>Rising Sun is a 1992 novel by Michael Crichton. It was his eighth under his own name and eighteenth overall, and is about a murder in the Los Angeles headquarters of Nakamoto, a fictional Japanese corporation. The book was published by Alfred A. Knopf, Inc. An image of fashion model Gia Carangi is incorporated in the cover art for the original edition.

Although a detective/murder mystery novel at first glance, &quot;Rising Sun&quot; deals with the controversial subject of Japanese-American relations, and questions the premise that foreign direct investment in the high-technology sectors of the United States is beneficial. Throughout the book, the differences between the Japanese and Western mindsets are highlighted, especially in the areas of business strategy and corporate culture.

The book is set in an unspecified future time when the process of a bloodless Japanese takeover of the US is far advanced: Japanese companies have altogether driven American ones out of whole branches of industry; Japanese technologies in virtually all fields are years ahead of American technologies and Americans see no hope of closing the gap. 

== Plot summary ==

Nakamoto Corporation is celebrating the grand opening of its new headquarters, the Nakamoto Tower, in Downtown Los Angeles; the 45th floor of the building is awash with celebrities, dignitaries and local politicians. On the 46th floor, Cheryl Lynn Austin, 23, is found dead. Lieutenant Peter J. Smith, the Special Services Liaison officer for the Los Angeles Police Department (LAPD), is assigned to the case. He is joined, on request, by retired Captain John Connor, who has lived in Japan and is well-acquainted with Japanese culture.

Upon arriving at Nakamoto Tower, the two policemen learn from officer-in-charge Tom Graham that the Japanese, led by Nakamoto employee Ishiguro, are stalling the investigation by demanding that the liaison be present. Although they have a valid pretense in that the virulently racist Graham is threatening to disrupt the celebration, it is obvious to Connor that a cover-up is underway. The detectives realize that the tapes from the security cameras on the 46th floor have mysteriously disappeared, and the security guards are deliberately unhelpful. Smith and Connor visit the apartment of the late Ms. Austin, realizing that she was a mistress to a wealthy Japanese. It seems that Ms. Austin&#x27;s home had been ransacked soon after her death. After several visits to friends and associates of Ms. Austin and Nakamoto, the two detectives find a suspect in Eddie Sakamura, a wealthy Japanese playboy from Kyoto. However, the two are inclined to release him, due to Eddie&#x27;s previous associations with John Connor. Connor is still able to get Eddie to hand over his passport. 

The two officers are summoned to witness Ms. Austin&#x27;s autopsy; trace evidence strongly suggests a Japanese killer. Afterwards, Smith and Connor are approached by Ishiguro, who now presents them with seemingly authentic videos from the security cameras, which show Sakamura to be the murderer. Having solved the mystery, Connor returns home to rest, while Smith and Graham go to apprehend Sakamura. Upon arriving at Eddie&#x27;s house, the two detectives are stalled by two naked women while Eddie escapes in a Ferrari. After a high-speed chase, Eddie&#x27;s car crashes and bursts into flames, killing him.

The next day, the newspaper runs editorials criticizing Smith, Graham, and Connor&#x27;s actions as racist and accuses them of police brutality. Soon afterward, Smith receives a phone call from the Chief of Police, declaring the investigation officially over. Smith isn&#x27;t satisfied, and decides to take the tapes to the University of Southern California, in order to make copies. There, Smith meets Theresa Asakuma, a Japanese student who is an expert on computers and software manipulation. She is able to quickly point out that the tapes were indeed copies. After duplicating the tapes, Smith then picks up Connor after his golf game with several Japanese friends. On their way back to the USC labs, the two detectives are offered lucrative bribes from the Japanese, including a membership at an expensive golf club and extremely low-priced real estate offers. They visit and consult with companies and industries involved with Nakamoto, in order to learn more about the killer&#x27;s motives. Along the way, they realize that they are only pawns in a much larger political and economic &quot;war&quot; between America and Japan, and how much the United States relies on Japan, which dominates the American electronics industry. Throughout the investigation, Connor educates Smith about the vast cultural differences between Japan and America, as well as the various underhanded business tactics Japan uses to maintain their technological edge over America.

Finally, they meet with U.S. Senator John Morton, a potential presidential candidate in the upcoming elections. They learn that Morton fiercely opposes the Japanese purchase of MicroCon, a small Silicon Valley company that manufactures machinery. At USC, Smith and Theresa deduce that Eddie had been set up by the Japanese who had altered the tapes and inserted Eddie&#x27;s image in them. They undo the changes, discovering that Senator Morton was apparently the real killer and Eddie had been a witness. Connor and Smith return to Smith&#x27;s apartment, where they discover Eddie Sakamura, alive; the man who had actually been killed was a Japanese security officer named Tanaka who had been in Eddie&#x27;s garage, searching for the tapes, before panicking and fleeing in Eddie&#x27;s car, which led to his death. The trio then confront Senator Morton, who confesses to his role in Cheryl Austin&#x27;s death. The senator then shoots himself in a bathroom. Soon afterward, an angry Ishiguro arrives to confront Eddie and the two detectives, making subtle threats to their lives. Strangely, Eddie reacts calmly, leading Connor to conclude afterward that Eddie still possesses an original copy of the tape from the security cameras. Smith and Connor then travel to Eddie&#x27;s home, where they find him tortured to death for the location of the stolen tape. Connor drops Smith off at his home.

Upon entering his apartment, Smith realizes that Eddie had left the tape there. Ishiguro&#x27;s men arrive; he quickly orders his babysitter to hide his daughter and herself in the upstairs bedroom. Connor sneaks back to Smith&#x27;s apartment, carrying a bulletproof vest. The two detectives then engage in a gun battle with the thugs, and Smith is shot in the back, although his vest saves his life.

The next day, the two watch the tape that Eddie had left behind; Austin was still alive after being strangled by Morton in an act of sexual pleasure, but deliberately murdered by Ishiguro after Morton and Eddie left. They go to the Nakamoto Tower to apprehend Ishiguro during an important meeting; Connor radios the police dispatcher knowing that the Japanese are monitoring the frequency and will be prepared for the arrest. The detectives show the tape of the murder to the meeting attendees; when Ishiguro sees that the senior Japanese executives have all left the meeting room he commits suicide by jumping off the building. Having solved the mystery, Connor answers Smith&#x27;s questions before dropping him off at his apartment. The story then concludes with Smith&#x27;s statements about America&#x27;s future with Japan and the observation that no one seems to be taking the potential threats seriously.

==Adaptations==
Random House abridged the novel into an audiobook read by Keith Szarabajka, which ran approximately three hours.

The book was adapted into a film, the 1993 release &quot;Rising Sun&quot; starring Sean Connery as Connor, Wesley Snipes as Smith, Tia Carrere as Asakuma and Harvey Keitel as Graham. Several changes were made in adapting the story for the film. Caucasian Peter Smith was changed to African-American Webster (&quot;Webb&quot;) Smith, Ishiguro became Ishihara, and Theresa became Jingo. Additionally, the identity of the murderer was changed from Ishiguro/Ishihara to Bob Richmond, and reflected in the solution to the film. The film received mixed reviews from critics but was a commercial success, grossing over $107 million worldwide.

==Reception==
Reviews for the novel were widely mixed, owing mostly to the controversial subject matter. The &quot;New York Times&quot;&#x27;s Christopher Lehmann-Haupt gave the novel a mixed review, saying, &quot;The trouble with &quot;Rising Sun&quot; is obviously that as a serious discourse on why we should begin waging economic war against Japan, the book is far too entertaining. And as an entertainment, it is far too didactic.&quot;

The &quot;Chicago Sun-Times&quot; wrote &quot;Though Michael Crichton knew &quot;Rising Sun&quot; would ruffle feathers, the vehemence of the reaction came as a surprise. Challenges to his economic premise - that the United States is selling its future to Japan - failed to materialize. Instead, he recalls with obvious annoyance, American critics labelled him racist.&quot;

In Crichton&#x27;s &quot;Associated Press&quot; obituary his rebuttal to the criticism of &quot;Rising Sun&quot; was quoted, saying &quot;because I&#x27;m always trying to deal with data, I went on a tour talking about it and gave a very careful argument, and their response came back, &#x27;Well you say that but we know you&#x27;re a racist.&#x27;&quot; Furthermore, Crichton has gone on record as saying that he intended his novel to be a &quot;wakeup call&quot; to U.S. industry and that he is more critical of the United States than Japan. According to activist Guy Aoki &quot;if that was his intention, he failed miserably,&quot; and &quot;what you had instead was every character going on for pages about how unfair Japanese business practices are [...] the book was a very one-sided view of what the Japanese are doing, saying that there&#x27;s reason to not trust them and not like them.&quot;

<doc id="823314" wikidata="Q1775519" url="?curid=823314" title="Mouse mammary tumor virus">
<text>Mouse mammary tumor virus (MMTV) is a milk-transmitted retrovirus like the HTL viruses, HI viruses, and BLV. It belongs to the genus &quot;Betaretrovirus&quot;. MMTV was formerly known as Bittner virus, and previously the &quot;milk factor&quot;, referring to the extra-chromosomal vertical transmission of murine breast cancer by adoptive nursing, demonstrated in 1936, by John Joseph Bittner while working at the Jackson Laboratory in Bar Harbor, Maine. Bittner established the theory that a cancerous agent, or &quot;milk factor&quot;, could be transmitted by cancerous mothers to young mice from a virus in their mother&#x27;s milk. The majority of mammary tumors in mice are caused by mouse mammary tumor virus.

==Infection and life cycle==
Several mouse strains carry the virus endogenously, but it is also transmitted vertically via milk from mother to pup. It is contained as a DNA provirus integrated in the DNA of milk lymphocytes. The viruses become transported through the gastrointestinal tract to the Peyer&#x27;s patches where they infect the new host&#x27;s macrophages, and then lymphocytes.

The mouse mammary tumor virus (MMTV) has formerly been classified as a simple retrovirus; however, it has recently been established, that MMTV encodes an extra self-regulatory mRNA export protein, Rem, with resemblance to the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) Rev protein, and is therefore the first complex murine retrovirus to be documented. Rem appears to shuttle between the nucleus and the cytoplasm. In contrast to Rem, which exports exclusively unspliced gag/pol mRNA, the HIV-1 Rev protein mediates cytoplasmic accumulation of both unspliced and singly-spliced mRNAs.

MMTV codes for the retroviral structural genes and additionally for a superantigen. This stimulates T lymphocytes with a certain type of V beta chain in their T cell receptor, which in turn stimulates B cell proliferation increasing the population of cells that can be infected. During puberty, the virus enters the mammary glands with migrating lymphocytes and infects proliferating mammary gland epithelial cells.

As a retrovirus the MMTV is able to insert its viral genome in the host genome. The virus RNA genome is reverse transcribed by reverse transcriptase into DNA. This DNA intermediate state of the virus is called the provirus. When the virus DNA is inserted inside or even near a gene, it is able to change the expression of that gene and potentially produce an oncogene which might eventually develop into cancer. The viral genome is able to cause cancer only if it alters the expression of an oncogene. If the viral genome is inserted in a &quot;silent&quot; region of the host genome then it is harmless or may cause other diseases. High levels of MMTV are expressed in lymphoid leukemias of mouse strain GR and DBA/2 which contain extra integrated MMTV proviruses. These leukemias are active when cells are transferred to other mice.

When the virus genome is inserted inside the host genome it is then able to transcribe its own viral genes. In F. U. Reuss and J. M. Coffin (2000) experiments it is mentioned that the expression of the virus genome is activated by an enhancer element that is present in the U3 region of the long terminal repeat of the genome. In addition the expression of the genome is activated specifically in the mammary gland cells. Estrogen is able to further activate the expression of the viral genome. The expression of &quot;sag&quot; gene which is present in the provirus is responsible for the production of a superantigen.

MMTV can be transferred either through an exogenous or endogenous route. If the virus is transferred exogenously, it is passed from the mother mouse to her pups through her milk.

Alternatively, pups can be infected vertically through endogenous infection, inheriting the virus directly from their mother in the germline. Mice that become infected in this way have higher rates of occurrence of tumors. A retrovirus is endogenous to its host once the proviral DNA is inserted into the chromosomal DNA. As a result, mice with endogenous MMTV have the virus&#x27;s DNA in every cell of its body, as the virus is present in the DNA of the sperm or egg cell from which the animal is conceived.

==Hormonal responsiveness of integrated MMTV DNA==
Endogenous MMTV reacts to the whole range of hormones that regulate normal mammary development and lactation, response has been demonstrated to steroid hormones (androgens, glucocorticoids and progestins), as well as prolactin.

When the mouse reaches puberty the virus begins to express its messenger RNA in the estrogen sensitive tissues. As a result, after puberty all mammary cells will contain the active retrovirus and begin to replicate in the genome and express viral messenger RNA in all new mammary tissue cells.

==The MMTV promoter in models of human breast cancer==
The LTR (long terminal repeat) of MMTV contains a glucocorticoid hormone response element. This glucocorticoid element is a promoter that is often used to construct mice which develop a breast cancer-like disease, because an animal model system for breast cancer close to the human disease is very much looked for.

The MMTV promoter is used in the PyMT model system of mouse models of breast cancer metastasis. Here Py is the abbreviation of polyoma and MT is the abbreviation for middle T. There are more model systems of breast cancer which use the MMTV promoter. The polyoma middle T-antigen is taken from the polyoma virus. The MMTV-PyMT model has been shown to be a reliable model of breast cancer metastasis. In human breast cancer the polyoma middle T- antigen was not found.

<doc id="823320" wikidata="Q5554342" url="?curid=823320" title="Get out the vote">
<text>&quot;Get out the vote&quot; or &quot;getting out the vote&quot; (GOTV) describes efforts aimed at increasing the voter turnout in elections. In countries that do not have or enforce compulsory voting, voter turnout can be low, sometimes even below a third of the eligible voter pool. GOTV efforts typically attempt to register voters, then get them to vote, by absentee ballot, early voting or election day voting. GOTV is generally not required for elections when there are effective compulsory voting systems in place, other than perhaps to register first time voters.

There are two types of GOTV efforts. The first type is general voter registration campaigns and encouragement to vote, conducted by electoral authorities or nonpartisan organizations. The second type is partisan work targeted at potential voters who are likely to vote a particular way. For partisans it may be easier and more cost effective to encourage voting by a hundred supporters who did not vote in the past, than it is to convince fifty voters to switch support from one party to the other. This situation can lead to polarized electoral politics. A 70% turnout from a party&#x27;s committed base can be better than a 50 percent turnout from both committed and marginal supporters.

== Campaign contexts ==
In contexts of the efforts of candidates, party activities and ballot measure campaigns, &quot;get-out-the-vote&quot; or &quot;GOTV&quot; is an adjective indicating having the effect of increasing the number of the campaign&#x27;s &quot;supporters&quot; who will vote in the immediately approaching election.

Typically GOTV is a distinct phase of the overall campaign. Tactics used during GOTV often include: telephoning or sending personalized audio messages to known supporters on the days leading up to an election (or on election day itself), providing transport to and from polling stations for supporters, and canvassing known supporters. Canvassing for the purpose of voter registration usually ceases when GOTV begins. Other activities include literature drops early on election day or the evening before and an active tracking of eligible voters who have already voted.

GOTV can also be important in high turn-out elections when the margin of victory is expected to be close.

== Voter turnout organizations ==
In many countries, the task of electoral authorities includes the promotion of and assisting in the registration of potential voters, and in the exercise of the right to vote. However, such efforts are not uniformly successful, and at times are partisan.

A number of voter turnout organizations have formed in an effort to &quot;get out the vote&quot;. In the United States, such voter turnout organizations include the League of Women Voters, Postcards To Voters, Rock the Vote, The Voter Participation Center and Vote.org, which attempt to motivate voters in targeted demographics to register and to vote.

During the 2016 Georgian parliamentary election, President of Georgia Giorgi Margvelashvili supported an unprecedented &quot;get out the vote&quot; campaign in Georgian history in terms of the scale of coverage, feedbacks, and results, a nation-wide campaign initiated by the Europe-Georgia Institute to increase involvement of youth in the elections.

Shortly before the elections the Europe-Georgia Institute started the &quot;Your Voice, Our Future&quot; (YVOF Campaign) in the village of . President Margvelashvili and George Melashvili, the head of the Europe-Georgia Institute addressed participants. Shortly after summer schools on civic engagement, political culture and &quot;Get out the vote&quot; campaigns were held in 10 different regions of Georgia. participants visited 20 cities and towns and held meetings with locals, describing and explaining the importance of voting. Young people planned creative activities such as flash mobs, plays, theatre sketches and attracted media attention.

The effort of these organizations is in getting people to vote and not to promote particular candidates or political view, and a group is nonpartisan if it is not directing people how to vote. Nonpartisan groups generally do not distribute literature about candidates or causes when assisting potential voters to register to vote, and also do not focus GOTV efforts on voters who are most likely to agree with their personal views.

== Reading system ==
The traditional GOTV method used in the UK is the Reading system, developed by the Reading Constituency Labour Party and its MP Ian Mikardo for the 1945 general election. Once canvassing was performed to identify likely Labour voters, these were compiled onto &#x27;Reading pads&#x27; or &#x27;Mikardo sheets&#x27; featuring the names and addresses of supporters and pasted onto a large table or plank of wood. On election day these lists, with identical copies underneath, were torn off and given to GOTV campaigners. Lists of this type are sometimes referred to as Shuttleworths.

At each polling station, tellers for each party will collect the unique poll numbers of voters from their polling cards. These numbers are regularly collected from the polling stations and collated in a campaign headquarters for each ward, often referred to in the UK as a committee room. &#x27;Promised voters&#x27; who have already voted are then crossed off the list of voters canvassed as supporting Labour. This enables campaigners to then focus more efficiently on the remainder of their supporters who have not voted. Computerisation has heralded further increases in efficiency, but nearly all subsequent methodologies can be traced back in some form to the Reading system.

== Negative campaigning and voter suppression ==
The terminology reflects a distinction of GOTV from the complementary strategy of suppressing turnout among likely opposition voters. Political consultants are reputed to privately advise some candidates to &quot;go negative&quot; (attack an opponent), without any intent to sway voters toward them: this plan is to instead increase the number of eligible voters who &quot;fail to vote&quot;, because their tendency to believe &quot;politics is inherently corrupt&quot; has so recently been reinforced. Such turnout suppression can be advantageous where any combination of three conditions apply:
# The negative campaigning is targeted (by direct mail, telephone &quot;push polls&quot;, or the like) on likely opposing voters, reducing the collateral damage to supporters&#x27; morale.
# The side going negative has an advantage in its supporters being steadier voters than those of its opponent.
# The side going negative has an advantage in doing effective GOTV, so that its campaign workers can get a GOTV &quot;antidote&quot; to more supporters &quot;poisoned&quot; by the negative campaign, than the opposing campaign can of their own supporters.

== Get out the vote in practice ==

Political scientists have conducted hundreds of field experiments to learn which get out the vote tactics are effective, when, and on which types of voters. This research has revolutionized how campaigns conceive of their get out the vote efforts. Research also shows that voting is habit-forming, as voting in one election increases the probability of voting in a future election by 10 percentage points (controlling for other factors).

The value of GOTV is unclear, but a well-organized effort can gain a candidate as much as nine percentage points in campaigns in the United States. In terms of mobilization, studies have found that door-to-door canvassing increases turnout among the contacted households with approximately 4.3 percentage points, according to experts Alan Gerber and Gregory Huber in 2016 while a 2013 study of 71 canvasses including many that targeted low propensity voters found turnout increased by 2–3 percentage points. Even earlier, analysts had often concluded that personal canvassing produced far higher voter turnout rates, such as 9.8–12.8%. While most experiments have been conducted in the US, recent studies have found similar or somewhat smaller effects in Europe.

The guide to grassroots elections &quot;Get Out the Vote&quot; determined that GOTV efforts averaged one vote every 15 door knocks by volunteers ($31 per vote), 35 phone calls by volunteers ($35 per vote), or 273 pieces of nonpartisan direct mail ($91 per vote, no effect from partisan direct mail). They note that campaigns which experiment carefully can do better than these averages. Campaigns can raise turnout up to 8 percentage points with direct mail which tells neighbors when other neighbors have voted and promises to mail an update after the election, though people complain when they have no way to opt in or out of notification.

Other studies have found that GOTV methods contribute little to none to voter turnout. One field experiment found that GOTV phone calls were largely ineffective, and that ease of access to polling locations had the largest impact on voter turnout.

There is also the argument that GOTV targets a more affluent demographic, which is already more likely to vote. Less politically engaged demographic and socioeconomic groups are sometimes neglected in GOTV efforts.

GOTV is often most effective when potential voters are told to do so &quot;because others will ask.&quot; Voters will then go to the polls as a means of fulfilling perceived societal expectations. Paradoxically, informing voters that turnout is expecting to be high was found to increase actual voter turnout, while predicting lower turnouts actually resulted in less voters.

In 2004, Rock the Vote paid to run TV ads aimed at young voters, on a random sample of small cable systems where they could measure the effects. Turnout was three percentage points higher among 18- to 19-year-olds in these sample areas than in the control group covered by other similar small cable systems; there was less effect above age 22.

In November 2012 and 2013, Rock the Vote experimented with Facebook ads to encourage voter turnout by telling people the number of days remaining until the election and which of their friends &quot;liked&quot; the countdown. The ads were shown to over 400,000 adults, randomly selected from a base over 800,000. Rock the Vote had helped many of them register. The ads did not increase turnout in the experimental group, compared to the control group who did not get the ads. In 2012 they also experimented with text message reminders to 180,000 people who had provided their mobile numbers. Texts the day before the election raised turnout six tenths of a percentage point, while texts on election day lowered turnout.

Several mobile apps tell people where to vote, identify their elected officials, or search candidates&#x27; positions, though no evidence measures how much these raise turnout. Facebook apps let users see who their friends endorse, which gives them a shortcut in deciding whom to vote for.

Studies in 2012 and 2017 found that Facebook&#x27;s &quot;I&#x27;m Voting/I&#x27;m a Voter&quot; button increased turnout in the 2010 Congressional elections by six tenths of a percentage point, and in the 2012 presidential election by a quarter of a percentage point. It named their friends who had clicked the voting button, thus opting in and minimizing complaints. However the button only appeared on election day, so it did not let friends track and encourage each other throughout the early voting period which most states have. It has been used in many elections throughout the world since then, without clarity on which users see it, leading to concerns on how it biases turnout.

Groups such as Postcards To Voters send handwritten postcards to potential voters ahead of elections in hopes of increasing turnout. A 2007 study showed that handwritten notes were three times as effective as machine-printed ones.

<text>Chestnuts Long Barrow, also known as Stony Warren or Long Warren, is a chambered long barrow near the village of Addington in the south-eastern English county of Kent. Probably constructed in the fifth millennium BC, during Britain&#x27;s Early Neolithic period, today it survives only in a ruined state.

Archaeologists have established that long barrows were built by pastoralist communities shortly after the introduction of agriculture to Britain from continental Europe. Representing an architectural tradition of long barrow building that was widespread across Neolithic Europe, Chestnuts Long Barrow belongs to a localised regional style of barrows produced in the vicinity of the River Medway. The long barrows built in this area are now known as the Medway Megaliths. Chestnuts Long Barrow lies near to both Addington Long Barrow and Coldrum Long Barrow on the western side of the river. Two further surviving long barrows, Kit&#x27;s Coty House and Little Kit&#x27;s Coty House, as well as the destroyed Smythe&#x27;s Megalith and possible survivals as the Coffin Stone and White Horse Stone, are on the eastern side of the Medway.

The long barrow was built on land previously inhabited in the Mesolithic period. It consisted of a sub-rectangular earthen tumulus, estimated to have been in length, with a chamber built from sarsen megaliths on its eastern end. Both inhumed and cremated human remains were placed within this chamber during the Neolithic period, representing at least nine or ten individuals. These remains were found alongside pottery sherds, stone arrow heads, and a clay pendant. In the 4th century AD, a Romano-British hut was erected next to the long barrow. In the 12th or 13th century, the chamber was dug into and heavily damaged, either by treasure hunters or iconoclastic Christians. The mound gradually eroded and was completely gone by the twentieth century, leaving only the ruined stone chamber. The ruin attracted the interest of antiquarians in the 18th and 19th centuries, while archaeological excavation took place in 1957, followed by limited reconstruction. The site is on privately owned land.

== Name and location ==
Chestnuts Long Barrow is a scheduled ancient monument, standing on private land belonging to a neighbouring house, Rose Alba. It lies on the slope of a hill and borrows its name from the Chestnuts, an area of woodland that crowns the hill. This name was given to the monument in the mid-20th century; it had previously been known as Stony Warren or Long Warren. The barrow is in the greensand belt, above sea level. The underlying geology is a soft sandstone covered with a stratum of white sand.

== Background ==
The Early Neolithic was a revolutionary period of British history. Between 4500 and 3800 BC, it saw a widespread change in lifestyle as the communities living in the British Isles adopted agriculture as their primary form of subsistence, abandoning the hunter-gatherer lifestyle that had characterised the preceding Mesolithic period. The change came about through contact with continental European societies, although it is unclear to what extent this can be attributed to an influx of migrants or to indigenous Mesolithic Britons adopting agricultural technologies from the continent. The region of modern Kent would have been key for the arrival of continental European settlers and visitors, because of its position on the estuary of the River Thames and its proximity to the continent.

Britain was then largely forested; widespread forest clearance did not occur in Kent until the Late Bronze Age (c. 1000 to 700 BC). Environmental data from the vicinity of the White Horse Stone, a putatively prehistoric monolith near the River Medway, supports the idea that the area was still largely forested in the Early Neolithic, covered by a woodland of oak, ash, hazel/alder and Amygdaloideae (stone-fruit trees). Throughout most of Britain, there is little evidence of cereal or permanent dwellings from this period, leading archaeologists to believe that the island&#x27;s Early Neolithic economy was largely pastoral, relying on herding cattle, with people living a nomadic or semi-nomadic life.

=== Medway Megaliths ===
Across Western Europe, the Early Neolithic marked the first period in which humans built monumental structures in the landscape. These structures included chambered long barrows, rectangular or oval earthen tumuli that had a chamber built into one end. Some of these chambers were constructed out of timber, while others were built using large stones, now known as &quot;megaliths&quot;. These long barrows often served as tombs, housing the physical remains of the dead within their chamber. Individuals were rarely buried alone in the Early Neolithic, instead being interred in collective burials with other members of their community. These chambered tombs were built all along the Western European seaboard during the Early Neolithic, from southeastern Spain up to southern Sweden, taking in most of the British Isles; the architectural tradition was introduced to Britain from continental Europe in the first half of the fourth millennium BC.

Although now all in a ruinous state, at the time of construction the Medway Megaliths would have been some of the largest and most visually imposing Early Neolithic funerary monuments in Britain. Grouped along the River Medway as it cuts through the North Downs, they constitute the most southeasterly group of megalithic monuments in the British Isles, and the only megalithic group in eastern England. The Medway Megaliths can be divided into two clusters between and apart: one to the west of the River Medway and the other on Blue Bell Hill to the east. Chestnuts Long Barrow is part of the western group, which also includes Coldrum Long Barrow and Addington Long Barrow. The eastern group consists of Smythe&#x27;s Megalith, Kit&#x27;s Coty House, and Little Kit&#x27;s Coty House, while various stones on the eastern side of the river, most notably the Coffin Stone and White Horse Stone, may also have been parts of such structures. It is not known if they were all built at the same time, or whether they were constructed in succession; nor is it known if they each served the same function or whether there was a hierarchy in their usage.

The Medway long barrows all conformed to the same general design plan, and are all aligned on an east to west axis. Each had a stone chamber at the eastern end of the mound, and they each probably had a stone facade flanking the entrance. They had internal heights of up to , making them taller than most other chambered long barrows in Britain. The chambers were constructed from sarsen, a dense, hard, and durable stone that occurs naturally throughout Kent, having formed out of sand from the Eocene epoch. Early Neolithic builders would have selected blocks from the local area, and then transported them to the site of the monument to be erected.

These common architectural features among the Medway Megaliths indicate a strong regional cohesion with no direct parallels elsewhere in the British Isles. Nevertheless, as with other regional groupings of Early Neolithic long barrows—such as the Cotswold-Severn group in south-western Britain—there are also various idiosyncrasies in the different monuments, such as Coldrum&#x27;s rectilinear shape, the Chestnut Long Barrow&#x27;s facade, and the long, thin mounds at Addington and Kit&#x27;s Coty. These variations might have been caused by the tombs being altered and adapted over the course of their use; in this scenario, the monuments would be composite structures.

The Medway Megaliths&#x27; builders were probably influenced by pre-existing tomb-shrines elsewhere that they were aware of. Whether the builders had grown up locally, or moved into the Medway area from elsewhere is not known. Based on a stylistic analysis of their architectural designs, the archaeologist Stuart Piggott thought that the plan behind the Medway Megaliths had originated in the area around the Low Countries, while fellow archaeologist Glyn Daniel instead believed that the same evidence showed an influence from Scandinavia. John H. Evans instead suggested an origin in Germany, and Ronald F. Jessup thought that their origins could be seen in the Cotswold-Severn megalithic group. Alexander thought that they bore closest similarities with long barrows along the Atlantic coast, perhaps imitating those of either Ireland or Brittany. The archaeologist Paul Ashbee noted that their close clustering in the same area was reminiscent of the megalithic tomb-shrine traditions of continental Northern Europe, and emphasised that the Medway Megaliths were a regional manifestation of a tradition widespread across Early Neolithic Europe. He nevertheless stressed that a precise place of origin was &quot;impossible to indicate&quot; with the available evidence.
== Design and construction ==
Archaeological excavation revealed a Mesolithic layer below the monument, evidenced by much debris produced by flint knapping. During the 1957 excavation of the site, 2,300 Mesolithic flint fragments were found beneath it. Many more have been discovered in test trenches around the area, stretching up the hill towards Chestnuts Wood and for at least east of the tomb and south-west of it. Around west of the long barrow, excavation revealed flints in association with what was interpreted as a Mesolithic hearth. The large quantities of Mesolithic material, coupled with its broad spread, indicated that the site was probably inhabited over a considerable length of time during the Mesolithic period. Some trenches excavated in 1957 had Mesolithic flints directly below the megaliths, leading the excavator John Alexander to believe that &quot;no great interval of time separated&quot; the Mesolithic and Neolithic uses of the site.

Chestnuts Long Barrow was constructed in particularly close proximity to Addington Long Barrow. The chamber was built with sarsen stones that occur naturally within a few miles of the site. These were arranged as two trilithons, next to each other, so that the two lintel stones formed the roof of the chamber. The chamber was trapezoidal in shape, measuring about in length, in width, and probably in height. It was oriented almost east to west, and as with four other Medway Megaliths, it appears to have been facing toward either the Medway Valley or the North Downs. It is probable that the chamber&#x27;s entrance was almost entirely blocked by a large stone. While it is difficult to determine the chamber&#x27;s precise original layout due to damage caused in the medieval period, it is probable that a medial stone divided the chamber in two. A dry stone wall across the west end of the chamber would have also blocked access.

Alexander suggested that the earthen mound was constructed before the chamber, and that it was used as a ramp on which to drag the large stones into position. He suggested that the long barrow&#x27;s builders kept the megaliths in place by filling the chamber with sand. Once the capstone was placed atop and the chamber was stable, he thought, the builders would have removed the supporting sand. In 1950, it was stated that 14 stones survived, however full excavation revealed that 18 large sarsen boulders were extant, alongside four smaller sarsen stones used in the dry stone wall and pavement of the tomb.

The chamber had a pavement set in yellow sand, onto which human remains were placed. These human remains were evidenced by the discovery of 3,500 pieces of bone, reflecting a minimum of nine or ten individuals, at least one of whom was a child. Some of these burials were inhumed, and others were cremated, while the earlier bones were deposited alongside Windmill Hill pottery. Little evidence of inhumed burials was found, in part because they did not survive well in the acidic soils surrounding the site. The appearance of cremated human bone here is unusual; although evidence of cremation has been found at some other long barrows, generally it is rare in Early Neolithic Britain. Ashbee suggested that for this reason, the inclusion of cremated bone here must have had &quot;especial significance&quot;.

While acknowledging that there was evidence of Early Neolithic cremation at certain sites in Britain, the archaeologists Martin Smith and Megan Brickley suggested that the cremated bone was added later, during the Late Neolithic, when cremation was more common. Along with the human remains were found items probably interred with the dead, such as 34 sherds of ceramic, three stone arrow heads, and a clay pendant. In the forecourt of the site, excavators found 100 sherds of Windmill Hill ware, representing parts of at least eight bowls. Alexander suggested that these were once placed in the chamber but later removed to allow the deposition of further human remains inside it.

Although no visible tumulus survived into the 1950s, the name &quot;Long Warren&quot; suggested that knowledge of such a mound had persisted into the 18th century. Excavation found evidence of the northern and eastern edges of the barrow, but all trace of its western and southern ends had been destroyed by levelling and deep ploughing. The barrow was probably trapezoidal or D-shaped, with a width of about . At its widest, opposite the façade, this may have extended to . It was more difficult to determine the long barrow&#x27;s length, although Alexander suggested that it may have been about .

=== Meaning and purpose ===
Britain&#x27;s Early Neolithic communities placed greater emphasis on the ritual burial of the dead than their Mesolithic forebears. Archaeologists have suggested that this is because Early Neolithic Britons adhered to an ancestor cult that venerated the spirits of the dead, believing that they could intercede with the forces of nature for the benefit of their living descendants. The archaeologist Robin Holgate stressed that rather than simply being tombs, the Medway Megaliths were &quot;communal monuments fulfilling a social function for the communities who built and used them&quot;. Thus, it has been suggested that Early Neolithic people entered into the tombs—which doubled as temples or shrines—to perform rituals honouring the dead and requesting their assistance. For this reason, the historian Ronald Hutton termed these monuments &quot;tomb-shrines&quot; to reflect their dual purpose.

In Britain, these tombs were typically located on prominent hills and slopes overlooking the landscape, perhaps at the junction between different territories. The archaeologist Caroline Malone noted that the tombs would have served as one of various landscape markers that conveyed information on &quot;territory, political allegiance, ownership, and ancestors&quot;. Many archaeologists have subscribed to the idea that these tomb-shrines were territorial markers between different tribes; others have argued that such markers would be of little use to a nomadic herding society. Instead it has been suggested that they represent markers along herding pathways. The archaeologist Richard Bradley suggested that the construction of these monuments reflects an attempt to mark control and ownership over the land, thus reflecting a change in mindset brought about by the transition from the hunter-gatherer Mesolithic to the pastoralist Early Neolithic. Others have suggested that these monuments were built on sites already deemed sacred by Mesolithic hunter-gatherers.

== Later history ==

During excavation of the site, four ceramic sherds were found nearby which the excavator believed were possibly Early Iron Age in origin. Excavation also revealed 830 ceramic sherds dating from Roman Britain; these reflected all four centuries of this period, although the majority were 4th century. Also dated to the 4th century was a hut erected on a flat area adjacent to the barrow. Excavation of this hut uncovered 750 ceramic sherds, charcoal, iron nails, burnt clay, bone, and flint fragments. Examining this assemblage of artefacts, the excavator noted that it was not typical of the item assemblages usually found at Romano-British settlement sites, implying that the building was a field shelter rather than a house.

Evidence for human activity near the barrow from the 11th through to the 13th century—during the Middle Ages—appeared in the form of 200 ceramic sherds, two hones, and 17 fragments of daub found by archaeologists in the topsoil. It was probably in this medieval period that the tomb was heavily destroyed, since medieval material was found in some of the pits created by those damaging the chamber and barrow. The destruction was carried out in a systematic manner. Initially, the barrow around the chamber was dug away, and an entrance into it was forced through the drystone wall at the north-western end. The chamber was then cleared down to the bedrock, with the spoil and contents of the chamber dumped behind the diggers. The medial stone of the chamber was pushed atop the spoil heap, and covered over with soil. A pit was dug in the centre of the chamber, and against its walls from the outside; the central pit was then sealed by the collapsing capstones. Finally, several pits were dug around the façade stones. Subsequently, the chamber collapsed, with several stones breaking on the impact of the fall. At some point after they had fallen, the inner pair of the chamber&#x27;s tall stones were further damaged, likely in a process involving heating them with fire and then casting cold water onto them, resulting in breakage.

From the available evidence, it was clear that this demolition was not carried out with the intent of collecting building stone nor for the clearance of ground for cultivation. Alexander believed the damage to the chamber was the result of robbery. Supporting this idea is comparative evidence, with the Close Roll of 1237 ordering the opening of barrows on the Isle of Wight in search for treasure, a practice which may have spread to Kent around the same time. Alexander believed that the destruction may have been brought about by a special commissioner, highlighting that the &quot;expertness and thoroughness of the robbery&quot; would have required more resources than a local community could muster. He further suggested that the individuals who damaged the monument might have also been responsible for the damage at Kit&#x27;s Coty House, Coldrum Long Barrow, and Addington Long Barrow, while Ashbee suggested that the same could also be the case for Lower Kit&#x27;s Coty House. Rather than robbery, Ashbee thought iconoclasm was the probable cause of the medieval damage to the chamber. He suggested that the burial of the stones indicated that Christian zealots had tried to deliberately destroy and defame the pre-Christian monument.

Excavation also revealed evidence for modern activity around the site. Three post-medieval pits were identified in and around the barrow, as well as a post-medieval attempt to dig into the chamber. Finds from this period included ceramic sherds, clay pipes dated from between the 17th and 19th centuries, stone and clay marbles, brick tile, and bottles dated from between the 18th and 20th centuries. Alexander suggested that this evidence confirmed local accounts that Chestnuts Long Barrow had been used as a popular spot for picnics. There are also accounts that it was used as a well-known rabbit warren; during the late 19th century, the field was used as a paddock.

== Folklore ==
In a 1946 paper published in the &quot;Folklore&quot; journal, John H. Evans recorded a Kentish folk belief which had been widespread &quot;up to the last generation&quot;. This held that it was impossible to successfully count the number of stones in the Medway Megaliths. The countless stones motif is not unique to Kent, having been recorded at other megalithic monuments in Britain and Ireland. The earliest textual evidence for it is in an early 16th-century document, where it applies to Stonehenge in Wiltshire, although an early 17th-century document also applied it to The Hurlers, a set of three stone circles in Cornwall. Later records reveal that the folk story had gained widespread distribution in England and single occurrences in both Wales and Ireland. The folklorist S. P. Menefee suggested that it could be attributed to an animistic understanding that these megaliths had lives of their own.

== Antiquarian and archaeological investigation ==
Antiquarians have been aware of Chestnuts Long Barrow since the 18th century. The earliest possible reference to the monuments was provided by the antiquarian John Harris in an ambiguous comment in his &quot;History of Kent in Five Parts&quot;, published in 1719. In 1773, the site was described in print by the antiquarian Josiah Colebrooke in a short article for &quot;Archaeologia&quot;, the journal of the Society of Antiquaries of London. He described it as one of the &quot;temples of the antient Britons&quot;. Colebrook&#x27;s analysis was echoed in the 18th-century writings of Edward Hasted, W. H. Ireland, and John Thorpe. In the early 1840s, the Reverend Beale Post conducted investigations into the Medway Megaliths, writing them up in a manuscript that was left unpublished; this included Addington Long Barrow and Chestnuts Long Barrow, which he collectively labelled the &quot;Addington Circles&quot;.

In the late 1940s, the site was visited by the archaeologists John H. Evans and Albert Egges van Giffen, with the former commenting that they examined the site in its &quot;overgrown state&quot;. In 1953, the archaeologist Leslie Grinsell reported that several small trees and bushes had grown up within the megaliths. That year, the field was prepared for horticultural use, being levelled and ploughed, although the area around the megaliths was left undisturbed. At this time, 16 megaliths were visible, lying at various angles. A high holly tree stood in the centre of them, and there was no sign of a mound. The landowner, Richard Boyle, opened a few test trenches in the area, during which he discovered Mesolithic flint tools. A large number of surface finds were discovered in both the field and a quarry to the east.

In the latter part of the 1950s, with plans afoot to build a house adjacent to Chestnuts Long Barrow, the Inspectorate of Ancient Monuments initiated an excavation of the site under the directorship of John Alexander. The excavation, which lasted five weeks in August and September 1957, was funded by Boyle, with the support of the Inspectorate, and largely carried out by volunteers. Following excavation, the fallen sarsen megaliths were re-erected in their original sockets, allowing for the restoration of part of the chamber and façade. The finds recovered from the excavation were placed in Maidstone Museum. Alexander&#x27;s subsequent excavation report was described by Ashbee as &quot;comprehensive&quot; and &quot;a model of its kind&quot;, and by Jessup as &quot;a notable example of modern archaeology in the field&quot;.

<text>Deshengmen () is a city gate that was once part of Beijing&#x27;s northern city wall. It is one of Beijing&#x27;s few preserved city gates and now stands as a landmark on the northern 2nd Ring Road. 

The original gate complex, built in 1437, was composed of three structures – the gatehouse, archery tower, and barbican. The gatehouse proper was demolished in 1921, and the city wall was torn down in 1969. Today only the archery tower and the barbican survives. They overlook the northern city moat, and house an ancient coin exhibition inside. 

Deshengmen is now a major transportation node in northern Beijing. The gate complex is surrounded by the Deshengmen bridge, a rotary overpass that channels traffic from the 2nd Ring Road to the Badaling Expressway. The street that once passed through the gate is still named in relation to it. South of Deshengmen and inside the old city wall is Deshengmen Inner Street. To the north, it is called Deshengmen Outer Street. 

Deshengmen means &quot;Gate of Virtuous Triumph.&quot; In traditional times, the imperial military would march out of Beijing through Deshengmen, and return through Andingmen, the Gate of Peace and Stability.

==Public transportation==
Line 2 of the Beijing Subway stops near Deshengmen at Jishuitan Station. Deshengmen is the terminus for many Beijing Bus routes, as well as a tourist bus that goes to Badaling Great Wall.

<doc id="823328" wikidata="Q639014" url="?curid=823328" title="Kartal">
<text>Kartal () is a municipality and district of Istanbul Province, Turkey. Its area is 38 km2, and its population is 483,418 (2022). It is located on the Asian side of the city, on the coast of the Marmara Sea between Maltepe and Pendik.

Despite being far from the city centre, Kartal is heavily populated (total population nearly 500,000). The district&#x27;s neighbours are Maltepe to the west, Sultanbeyli and Sancaktepe to the north and Pendik to the east. Inland from the coast, the land rises sharply up to the hills Yakacık and Aydos, the latter of which is the highest point in Istanbul.

==History==
Kartal (&#x27;eagle&#x27; in Turkish, by folk etymology) was a fishing village on the shore of the Marmara Sea during the Byzantine Empire, called Kartalimen or Kartalimin in Greek, and was founded at the beginning of the 6th century. In the 11th century, the town was conquered by the ruler of the Seljuks, Suleyman Shah. In 1329, Kartal became part of the Ottoman Empire, the Byzantines re-took the city in 1403, however, and held it for 17 years before losing it to the Ottomans again.

According to the Ottoman General Census of 1881/82-1893, the kaza of Kartal had a total population of 12,969, consisting of 6,920 Greeks, 5,095 Muslims, 869 Armenians, 3 Catholics, 1 Jew and 81 foreign citizens.

By 1947, Kartal was an industrial area and with the introduction of commuter trains to Haydarpaşa Terminal from Gebze in 1973, Kartal became even more important as an industrial area of Istanbul. However, the current trend is that factories are being closed down and moved inland. For example, the large cement factory on the shore, which is to be converted into a cultural center, was closed in 2003.

There is a historical Roman bath ruin near Dragos Hill, which is being recovered by the Istanbul Archaeology Museums, with the financial support of Kartal Municipality.

In 2008, parts of Kartal were merged with parts of Ümraniye to form the new district of Sancaktepe.

==Kartal today==
Luxury apartment complexes have been built on the coast, along with much more housing inland and this has attracted more shops and infrastructure.

Housing is of good-quality in general. Building near the coast slowed after the 1999 earthquake, when people became aware that a major fault line runs just off this coast. However, building on the high ground inland is proceeding apace.

On 4 June 2007, the Greater Istanbul Municipality and the former mayor of Kartal announced that a new urban city environment would be built in Kartal-Pendik. The plan includes a central business district, luxury residential developments, cultural facilities such as concert halls, museums, and theatres, and leisure locations including a marina and tourist hotels.

Kartal is the terminal station of Kadıköy - Sabiha Gökçen Airport metro line. The Marmaray for commuter trains also passes through Kartal.

==Geography==
The coast of Kartal has sandy and clay soils, whereas the northern part of the district is mostly silica. On Yakacık Hill, there are limestone and quartz deposits. 

The streams of Paşaköy, Kavaklıdere and Fındıklı feed the reservoir behind the Ömerli Dam.

<text>Aish, formerly known as Aish HaTorah (Hebrew: אש התורה, lit. &quot;Fire of the Torah&quot;), is a Jewish educational organization. The focus of Aish is the spread of traditional Jewish religious teachings and culture to Jews around the globe, utilizing a significant online presence made up of its website, Aish.com, and various social media channels. In addition to the educational organization, the organization&#x27;s main campus in Jerusalem also includes a yeshiva and a women&#x27;s seminary, as well as several other in-person programs.

== History ==

Aish, founded in Jerusalem in 1974 by Rabbi Noah Weinberg after leaving the Ohr Somayach yeshiva, which he had co-founded, aimed to educate young Jewish students, particularly travellers and volunteers, in the history and traditions of Orthodox Judaism. It later expanded worldwide and established 30 branches; each is currently run as its own entity. Aish continues to promote an extensive array of relevant in-person courses and online educational material. After Weinberg died in February 2009, his son, Rabbi Hillel Weinberg, served as interim dean for a few years. In 2015, Rabbi Steven Burg was named CEO of the organization, and, in 2019, Rabbi Yitzchak Berkovits was named &quot;rosh yeshiva&quot;. 

==Philosophy==
Rabbi Weinberg developed the yeshiva’s philosophy by blending Lithuanian Jewish traditions with Hasidic philosophy. Educated in Lithuanian Jewish schools and as the grandson of the Slonimer Rebbe, he incorporated influences from both traditions. Additionally, he drew on various streams of Kabbalah, including those of Moshe Chaim Luzzatto and the Vilna Gaon, to enrich the yeshiva’s curriculum. 

The organization is ideologically conservative and its officials have stated they oppose a full hand-over of the West Bank to the Palestinians.

==Programs==
Aish operates roughly 30 full-time branches on five continents, providing seminars, singles events, executive learning groups, Shabbat and Jewish holiday programs, and community-building.

Aish.com

Aish has an interactive-online website at Aish.com which hosts a wealth of articles on almost every topic in Judaism. Additionally, the website hosts live chat sessions with Rabbis who are available to answer any question. Aish has an online community of over 3 million followers across multiple social media platforms. 

Branches

There are 30 full-time branches on five continents, providing seminars, singles events, executive learning groups, Shabbat and Jewish holiday programs, educational classes, and community building. These branches are all their own separate entities and serve their own communities, but they operate under the same banner and share a similar history. 

The Dan Family Aish World Center

The Jerusalem headquarters includes a high-tech main campus and outreach center, that features a rooftop vista overlooking the Temple Mount.

The Jerusalem Yeshiva

In Jerusalem, the Aish yeshiva offers both beginners&#x27; &quot;drop-in classes&quot; and full-time, intensive study programs for Jewish men and women of all backgrounds and levels of knowledge. The offering extends through a 4-year &quot;semikhah&quot; (rabbinic ordination) program; previously, participants were tested by the posek Zalman Nechemia Goldberg.
Discovery Seminar

Aish HaTorah runs the &quot;Discovery Seminar&quot;. The four-hour seminar reviews Jewish history, Jewish philosophy, and Jewish philosophy questions. The Discovery Seminar aims to imbue participants with a newfound connection to Judaism, discovering its depth, beauty, and practical significance in their daily lives. 

Essentials Program

Essentials classes is a series of ongoing drop-in classes that explore critical topics such as God, religion, relationships, Jewish history, and philosophy. With teachers and educators, each session offers diverse perspectives. These classes are offered at the Aish World Center in Jerusalem.

Hasbara Fellowships

The Israeli Foreign Ministry worked with Aish HaTorah to combat anti-Israel ideas on college campuses via the Hasbara Fellowships. This program has flown hundreds of student leaders to Israel for intensive training in pro-Israel activism training. In North America, Hasbara Fellowships guides and funds pro-Israel activities on over 100 college campuses.

== Embezzlement case ==
In December 2013, Aish HaTorah of New York filed suit against its former chief financial officer Jacob Fetman to enforce a Beth Din of America ruling that Fetman had stolen $20 million in funds from the organization.

<text>Harry Edvin &quot;Harri&quot; Larva (born Lagerström, 9 September 1906 – 15 November 1980) was a Finnish athlete who won the 1500 m race at the 1928 Summer Olympics. He never excelled in this event nationally and was the Finnish champion in the 800 m in 1928–1930 and 1934. Larva finished 10th in the 1500 m at the 1932 Summer Olympics.

Larva was requested to change his last name in 1928 by Urho Kekkonen, then president of Finnish Athletics Union and later president of Finland, who thought that his birth name Lagerström did not sound Finnish enough.

<doc id="823343" wikidata="Q217050" url="?curid=823343" title="Late antiquity">
<text>Late antiquity is sometimes defined as spanning from the end of classical antiquity to the local start of the Middle Ages, from around the late 3rd century up to the 7th or 8th century in Europe and adjacent areas bordering the Mediterranean Basin depending on location. The popularisation of this periodization in English has generally been credited to historian Peter Brown, who proposed a period between 150 and 750 AD. The Oxford Centre for Late Antiquity defines it as &quot;the period between approximately 250 and 750 AD&quot;. Precise boundaries for the period are a continuing matter of debate. In the West, its end was earlier, with the start of the Early Middle Ages typically placed in the 6th century, or even earlier on the edges of the Western Roman Empire.

==Terminology==
The term &quot;Spätantike&quot;, literally &quot;late antiquity&quot;, has been used by German-speaking historians since its popularization by Alois Riegl in the early 20th century. It was given currency in English partly by the writings of Peter Brown, whose survey &quot;The World of Late Antiquity&quot; (1971) revised the Gibbon view of a stale and ossified Classical culture, in favour of a vibrant time of renewals and beginnings, and whose &quot;The Making of Late Antiquity&quot; offered a new paradigm of understanding the changes in Western culture of the time in order to confront Sir Richard Southern&#x27;s &quot;The Making of the Middle Ages&quot;.

The continuities between the later Roman Empire, as it was reorganized by Diocletian (r. 284–305), and the Early Middle Ages are stressed by writers who wish to emphasize that the seeds of medieval culture were already developing in the Christianized empire, and that they continued to do so in the Eastern Roman Empire or Byzantine Empire at least until the coming of Islam. Concurrently, some migrating Germanic tribes such as the Ostrogoths and Visigoths saw themselves as perpetuating the &quot;Roman&quot; tradition. While the usage &quot;Late Antiquity&quot; suggests that the social and cultural priorities of classical antiquity endured throughout Europe into the Middle Ages, the usage of &quot;Early Middle Ages&quot; or &quot;Early Byzantine&quot; emphasizes a break with the classical past, and the term &quot;Migration Period&quot; tends to de-emphasize the disruptions in the former Western Roman Empire caused by the creation of Germanic kingdoms within her borders beginning with the &quot;foedus&quot; with the Goths in Aquitania in 418.

The general decline of population, technological knowledge and standards of living in Europe during this period became the archetypal example of societal collapse for writers from the Renaissance. As a result of this decline, and the relative scarcity of historical records from Europe in particular, the period from roughly the early fifth century until the Carolingian Renaissance (or later still) was referred to as the &quot;Dark Ages&quot;. This term has mostly been abandoned as a name for a historiographical epoch, being replaced by &quot;Late Antiquity&quot; in the periodization of the late Western Roman Empire, the early Byzantine Empire and the Early Middle Ages. The term is seldom applied to Britain; the collapse of Roman rule in the island in the early fifth century is seen as a unique aspect of European history in the period.

==Period history==

The Roman Empire underwent considerable social, cultural and organizational changes starting with the reign of Diocletian, who began the custom of splitting the Empire into Eastern and Western portions ruled by multiple emperors simultaneously. The Sasanian Empire supplanted the Parthian Empire and began a new phase of the Roman–Persian Wars, the Roman–Sasanian Wars. The divisions between the Greek East and Latin West became more pronounced. The Diocletianic Persecution of Christians in the early 4th century was ended by Galerius and under Constantine the Great, Christianity was made legal in the Empire. The 4th century Christianization of the Roman Empire was extended by the conversions of Tiridates the Great of Armenia, Mirian III of Iberia, and Ezana of Axum, who later invaded and ended the Kingdom of Kush. During the late 4th century reign of Theodosius I, Nicene Christianity was proclaimed the state church of the Roman Empire.

The city of Constantinople became the permanent imperial residence in the East by the 5th century and superseded Rome as the largest city in the Late Roman Empire and the Mediterranean Basin. The longest Roman aqueduct system, the -long Aqueduct of Valens was constructed to supply it with water, and the tallest Roman triumphal columns were erected there.

Migrations of Germanic, Hunnic, and Slavic tribes disrupted Roman rule from the late 4th century onwards, culminating first in the Sack of Rome by the Visigoths in 410 and subsequent Sack of Rome by the Vandals in 455, part of the eventual collapse of the Empire in the West itself by 476. The Western Empire was replaced by the so-called barbarian kingdoms, with the Arian Christian Ostrogothic Kingdom ruling Rome from Ravenna. The resultant cultural fusion of Greco-Roman, Germanic, and Christian traditions formed the foundations of the subsequent culture of Europe.

In the 6th century, Roman imperial rule continued in the East, and the Byzantine-Sasanian wars continued. The campaigns of Justinian the Great led to the fall of the Ostrogothic and Vandal Kingdoms, and their reincorporation into the Empire, when the city of Rome and much of Italy and North Africa returned to imperial control. Though most of Italy was soon part of the Kingdom of the Lombards, the Roman Exarchate of Ravenna endured, ensuring the so-called Byzantine Papacy. Justinian constructed the Hagia Sophia, a great example of Byzantine architecture, and the first outbreak of the centuries-long first plague pandemic took place. At Ctesiphon, the Sasanians completed the Taq Kasra, the colossal &quot;iwan&quot; of which is the largest single-span vault of unreinforced brickwork in the world and the triumph of Sasanian architecture.

The middle of the 6th century was characterized by extreme climate events (the volcanic winter of 535–536 and the Late Antique Little Ice Age) and a disastrous pandemic (the Plague of Justinian in 541). The effects of these events in the social and political life are still under discussion. In the 7th century the disastrous Byzantine–Sasanian War of 602–628 and the campaigns of Khosrow II and Heraclius facilitated the emergence of Islam in the Arabian Peninsula during the lifetime of Muhammad. Subsequent Muslim conquest of the Levant and Persia overthrew the Sasanian Empire and permanently wrested two thirds of the Eastern Roman Empire&#x27;s territory from Roman control, forming the Rashidun Caliphate. The Byzantine Empire under the Heraclian dynasty began the middle Byzantine period, and together with the establishment of the later 7th century Umayyad Caliphate, generally marks the end of late antiquity.

== Religion ==

One of the most important transformations in late antiquity was the formation and evolution of the Abrahamic religions: Christianity, Rabbinic Judaism and, eventually, Islam.
A milestone in the spread of Christianity was the conversion of Emperor Constantine the Great (r. 306–337) in 312, as claimed by his Christian panegyrist Eusebius of Caesarea, although the sincerity of his conversion is debated. Constantine confirmed the legalization of the religion through the so-called Edict of Milan in 313, jointly issued with his rival in the East, Licinius (r. 308–324). By the late 4th century, Emperor Theodosius the Great had made Christianity the State religion, thereby transforming the Classical Roman world, which Peter Brown characterized as &quot;rustling with the presence of many divine spirits.&quot;

Constantine I was a key figure in many important events in Christian history, as he convened and attended the first ecumenical council of bishops at Nicaea in 325, subsidized the building of churches and sanctuaries such as the Church of the Holy Sepulchre in Jerusalem, and involved himself in questions such as the timing of Christ&#x27;s resurrection and its relation to the Passover.

The birth of Christian monasticism the 3rd century was a major step in the development of Christian spirituality. While it initially operated outside the episcopal authority of the Church, it would become hugely successful and by the 8th century it became one of the key Christian practices. Monasticism was not the only new Christian movement to appear in late antiquity, although it had perhaps the greatest influence and it achieved unprecedented geographical spread. It influenced many aspects of Christian religious life and led to a proliferation of various ascetic or semi-ascetic practices. Holy Fools and Stylites counted among the more extreme forms but through such personalities like John Chrysostom, Jerome, Augustine or Gregory the Great monastic attitudes penetrated other areas of Christian life.

Late antiquity marks the decline of Roman state religion, circumscribed in degrees by edicts likely inspired by Christian advisors such as Eusebius to 4th-century emperors, and a period of dynamic religious experimentation and spirituality with many syncretic sects, some formed centuries earlier, such as Gnosticism or Neoplatonism and the Chaldaean oracles, some novel, such as Hermeticism. Culminating in the reforms advocated by Apollonius of Tyana being adopted by Aurelian and formulated by Flavius Claudius Julianus to create an organized but short-lived pagan state religion that ensured its underground survival into the Byzantine age and beyond.

Mahāyāna Buddhism developed in India and along the Silk Road in Central Asia, while Manichaeism, a Dualist faith, arose in Mesopotamia and spread both East and West, for a time contending with Christianity in the Roman Empire.

Many of the new religions relied on the emergence of the parchment &quot;codex&quot; (bound book) over the papyrus &quot;volumen&quot; (scroll), the former allowing for quicker access to key materials and easier portability than the fragile scroll, thus fueling the rise of synoptic exegesis, papyrology. Notable in this regard is the topic of the Fifty Bibles of Constantine.

===Laity vs clergy===
Within the recently legitimized Christian community of the 4th century, a division could be more distinctly seen between the laity and an increasingly celibate male leadership. These men presented themselves as removed from the traditional Roman motivations of public and private life marked by pride, ambition and kinship solidarity, and differing from the married pagan leadership. Unlike later strictures on priestly celibacy, celibacy in late antique Christianity sometimes took the form of abstinence from sexual relations after marriage, and it came to be the expected norm for urban clergy. Celibate and detached, the upper clergy became an elite equal in prestige to urban notables, the &quot;potentes&quot; or &quot;dynatoi&quot;.

===The rise of Islam===

Islam appeared in the 7th century, spurring Arab armies to invade the Eastern Roman Empire and the Sassanian Empire of Persia, destroying the latter. After conquering all of North Africa and Visigothic Spain, the Islamic invasion was halted by Charles Martel at the Battle of Tours in modern France.

On the rise of Islam, two main theses prevail. On the one hand, there is the traditional view, as espoused by most historians prior to the second half of the twentieth century (and after) and by Muslim scholars. This view, the so-called &quot;out of Arabia&quot;-thesis, holds that Islam as a phenomenon was a new, alien element in the late antique world. Related to this is the Pirenne Thesis, according to which the Arab invasions marked—through conquest and the disruption of Mediterranean trade routes—the cataclysmic end of late antiquity and the beginning of the Middle Ages.

On the other hand, there is a more recent thesis, associated with scholars in the tradition of Peter Brown, in which Islam is seen to be a product of the late antique world, not foreign to it. This school suggests that its origin within the shared cultural horizon of the late antique world explains the character of Islam and its development. Such historians point to similarities with other late antique religions and philosophies—especially Christianity—in the prominent role and manifestations of piety in Islam, in Islamic asceticism and the role of &quot;holy persons&quot;, in the pattern of universalist, homogeneous monotheism tied to worldly and military power, in early Islamic engagement with Greek schools of thought, in the apocalypticism of Islamic theology and in the way the Quran seems to react to contemporary religious and cultural issues shared by the late antique world at large. Further indication that Arabia (and thus the environment in which Islam first developed) was a part of the late antique world is found in the close economic and military relations between Arabia, the Byzantine Empire and the Sassanian Empire. In recent years, the period of late antiquity has become a major focus in the fields of Quranic studies and Islamic origins.

==Political transformations==
The late antique period also saw a wholesale transformation of the political and social basis of life in and around the Roman Empire.

The Roman citizen elite in the 2nd and 3rd centuries, under the pressure of taxation and the ruinous cost of presenting spectacular public entertainments in the traditional &quot;cursus honorum&quot;, had found under the Antonines that security could be obtained only by combining their established roles in the local town with new ones as servants and representatives of a distant emperor and his traveling court. After Constantine centralized the government in his new capital of Constantinople (dedicated in 330), the late antique upper classes were divided among those who had access to the far-away centralized administration (in concert with the great landowners), and those who did not; although they were well-born and thoroughly educated, a classical education and the election by the Senate to magistracies was no longer the path to success. Room at the top of late antique society was more bureaucratic and involved increasingly intricate channels of access to the emperor; the plain toga that had identified all members of the Republican senatorial class was replaced with the silk court vestments and jewelry associated with Byzantine imperial iconography. Also indicative of the times is the fact that the imperial cabinet of advisors came to be known as the &quot;consistorium&quot;, or those who would stand in courtly attendance upon their seated emperor, as distinct from the informal set of friends and advisors surrounding the &quot;Augustus&quot;.
==Cities==
The later Roman Empire was in a sense a network of cities. Archaeology now supplements literary sources to document the transformation followed by collapse of cities in the Mediterranean Basin. Two diagnostic symptoms of decline—or as many historians prefer, &#x27;transformation&#x27;—are subdivision, particularly of expansive formal spaces in both the &quot;domus&quot; and the public basilica, and encroachment, in which artisans&#x27; shops invade the public thoroughfare, a transformation that was to result in the &quot;souk&quot; (marketplace). Burials within the urban precincts mark another stage in dissolution of traditional urbanistic discipline, overpowered by the attraction of saintly shrines and relics. In Roman Britain, the typical 4th- and 5th-century layer of dark earth within cities seems to be a result of increased gardening in formerly urban spaces.

The city of Rome went from a population of 800,000 in the beginning of the period to a population of 30,000 by the end of the period, the most precipitous drop coming with the breaking of the aqueducts during the Gothic War. A similar though less marked decline in urban population occurred later in Constantinople, which was gaining population until the outbreak of the Plague of Justinian in 541. In Europe there was also a general decline in urban populations. As a whole, the period of late antiquity was accompanied by an overall population decline in almost all Europe, and a reversion to more of a subsistence economy. Long-distance markets disappeared, and there was a reversion to a greater degree of local production and consumption, rather than webs of commerce and specialized production. 
Concurrently, the continuity of the Eastern Roman Empire at Constantinople meant that the turning-point for the Greek East came later, in the 7th century, as the Eastern Roman, or Byzantine Empire centered around the Balkans, North Africa (Egypt and Carthage), and Asia Minor. The cities in the East were still lively stages for political participation and remained important for background for religious and political disputes. The degree and extent of discontinuity in the smaller cities of the Greek East is a moot subject among historians. The urban continuity of Constantinople is the outstanding example of the Mediterranean world; of the two great cities of lesser rank, Antioch was devastated by the Persian sack of 540, followed by the plague of Justinian (542 onwards) and completed by earthquake, while Alexandria survived its Islamic transformation, to suffer incremental decline in favour of Cairo in the medieval period.

Justinian rebuilt his birthplace in Illyricum, as &quot;Justiniana Prima&quot;, more in a gesture of &quot;imperium&quot; than out of an urbanistic necessity; another &quot;city&quot;, was reputed to have been founded, according to Procopius&#x27; panegyric on Justinian&#x27;s buildings, precisely at the spot where the general Belisarius touched shore in North Africa: the miraculous spring that gushed forth to give them water and the rural population that straightway abandoned their ploughshares for civilised life within the new walls, lend a certain taste of unreality to the project.

In mainland Greece, the inhabitants of Sparta, Argos and Corinth abandoned their cities for fortified sites in nearby high places; the fortified heights of Acrocorinth are typical of Byzantine urban sites in Greece. In Italy, populations that had clustered within reach of Roman roads began to withdraw from them, as potential avenues of intrusion, and to rebuild in typically constricted fashion round an isolated fortified promontory, or &quot;rocca&quot;; Cameron notes similar movement of populations in the Balkans, &#x27;where inhabited centres contracted and regrouped around a defensible acropolis, or were abandoned in favour of such positions elsewhere.&quot;
In the western Mediterranean, the only new cities known to be founded in Europe between the 5th and 8th centuries were the four or five Visigothic &quot;victory cities&quot;. Reccopolis in the province of Guadalajara is one: the others were &quot;Victoriacum&quot;, founded by Leovigild, which may survive as the city of Vitoria, though a 12th-century (re)foundation for this city is given in contemporary sources; &quot;Lugo id est Luceo&quot; in the Asturias, referred to by Isidore of Seville, and &quot;Ologicus&quot; (perhaps &quot;Ologitis&quot;), founded using Basque labour in 621 by Suinthila as a fortification against the Basques, modern Olite. All of these cities were founded for military purposes and at least Reccopolis, Victoriacum, and Ologicus in celebration of victory. A possible fifth Visigothic foundation is &quot;Baiyara&quot; (perhaps modern Montoro), mentioned as founded by Reccared in the 15th-century geographical account, &quot;Kitab al-Rawd al-Mitar&quot;. The arrival of a highly urbanized Islamic culture in the decade following 711 ensured the survival of cities in the &quot;Hispaniae&quot; into the Middle Ages.

Beyond the Mediterranean world, the cities of Gaul withdrew within a constricted line of defense around a citadel. Former imperial capitals such as Cologne and Trier lived on in diminished form as administrative centres of the Franks. In Britain most towns and cities had been in decline, apart from a brief period of recovery during the fourth century, well before the withdrawal of Roman governors and garrisons but the process might well have stretched well into the fifth century. Historians emphasizing urban continuities with the Anglo-Saxon period depend largely on the post-Roman survival of Roman toponymy. Aside from a mere handful of its continuously inhabited sites, like York and London and possibly Canterbury, however, the rapidity and thoroughness with which its urban life collapsed with the dissolution of centralized bureaucracy calls into question the extent to which Roman Britain had ever become authentically urbanized: &quot;in Roman Britain towns appeared a shade exotic,&quot; observes H. R. Loyn, &quot;owing their reason for being more to the military and administrative needs of Rome than to any economic virtue&quot;. The other institutional power centre, the Roman villa, did not survive in Britain either. Gildas lamented the destruction of the twenty-eight cities of Britain; though not all in his list can be identified with known Roman sites, Loyn finds no reason to doubt the essential truth of his statement.

Classical antiquity can generally be defined as an age of cities; the Greek polis and Roman municipium were locally organised, self-governing bodies of citizens governed by written constitutions. When Rome came to dominate the known world, local initiative and control were gradually subsumed by the ever-growing Imperial bureaucracy; by the Crisis of the Third Century the military, political and economic demands made by the Empire made the service in local government to be an onerous duty, often imposed as punishment. Harassed urban dwellers fled to the walled estates of the wealthy to avoid taxes, military service, famine and disease. In the Western Roman Empire especially, many cities destroyed by invasion or civil war in the 3rd century could not be rebuilt. Plague and famine hit the urban class in greater proportion, and thus the people who knew how to keep civic services running. Perhaps the greatest blow came in the wake of the extreme weather events of 535–536 and subsequent Plague of Justinian, when the remaining trade networks ensured the Plague spread to the remaining commercial cities. The impact of this outbreak of plague has recently been disputed. The end of classical antiquity is the end of the polis model. While there was a decline of urban life in late antiquity (especially in the West) the epoch brought with it new forms of political participation in the urban spaces as well. Especially the role of crowds and masses in cities has increased, leading to new levels of tension.

=== Public building ===
In the cities the strained economies of Roman over-expansion arrested growth. Almost all new public building in late antiquity came directly or indirectly from the emperors or imperial officials. Attempts were made to maintain what was already there. The supply of free grain and oil to 20% of the population of Rome remained intact the last decades of the 5th century. It was once thought that the elite and rich had withdrawn to the private luxuries of their numerous villas and town houses. Scholarly opinion has revised this. They monopolized the higher offices in the imperial administration, but they were removed from military command by the late 3rd century. Their focus turned to preserving their vast wealth rather than fighting for it.

The basilica, which had functioned as a law court or for imperial reception of foreign dignitaries, became the primary public building in the 4th century. Due to the stress on civic finances, cities spent money on walls, maintaining baths and markets at the expense of amphitheaters, temples, libraries, porticoes, gymnasia, concert and lecture halls, theaters and other amenities of public life. In any case, as Christianity took over, many of these buildings which were associated with pagan cults were neglected in favor of building churches and donating to the poor. The Christian basilica was copied from the civic structure with variations. The bishop took the chair in the apse reserved in secular structures for the magistrate—or the Emperor himself—as the representative here and now of Christ Pantocrator, the Ruler of All, his characteristic late antique icon. These ecclesiastical basilicas (e.g., St. John Lateran and St. Peter&#x27;s in Rome) were themselves outdone by Justinian&#x27;s Hagia Sophia, a staggering display of later Roman/Byzantine power and architectural taste, though the building is not architecturally a basilica. In the former Western Roman Empire almost no great buildings were constructed from the 5th century. A most outstanding example is the Basilica of San Vitale in Ravenna constructed at a cost of 26,000 gold solidi or 360 Roman pounds of gold.

City life in the East, though negatively affected by the plague in the 6th–7th centuries, finally collapsed due to Slavic invasions in the Balkans and
Persian destructions in Anatolia in the 620s. City life continued in Syria, Jordan and Palestine into the 8th. In the later 6th century street construction was still undertaken in Caesarea Maritima in Palestine, and Edessa was able to deflect Chosroes I with massive payments in gold in 540 and 544, before it was overrun in 609.

==Sculpture and art==
The stylistic changes characteristic of late antique art mark the end of classical Roman art and the beginnings of medieval art. As a complicated period bridging between Roman art and later medieval styles (such as that of the Byzantines), the late antique period saw a transition from the classical idealized realism tradition largely influenced by ancient Greek art to the more iconic, stylized art of the Middle Ages. Unlike classical art, late antique art does not emphasize the beauty and movement of the body, but rather, hints at the spiritual reality behind its subjects. Additionally, mirroring the rise of Christianity and the collapse of the Western Roman Empire, painting and freestanding sculpture gradually fell from favor in the artistic community. Replacing them were greater interests in mosaics, architecture, and relief sculpture.

As the soldier emperors such as Maximinus Thrax (r. 235–238) emerged from the provinces in the 3rd century, they brought with them their own regional influences and artistic tastes. For example, artists jettisoned the classical portrayal of the human body for one that was more rigid and frontal. This is markedly evident in the combined porphyry Portrait of the Four Tetrarchs in Venice. With these stubby figures clutching each other and their swords, all individualism, naturalism, Roman verism, and Greek idealism diminish. The Arch of Constantine in Rome, which re-used earlier classicising reliefs together with ones in the new style, shows the contrast especially clearly. In nearly all artistic media, simpler shapes were adopted and once natural designs were abstracted. Additionally hierarchy of scale overtook the preeminence of perspective and other classical models for representing spatial organization.

From Early Christian art began to create new public forms, which now included sculpture, previously distrusted by Christians as it was so important in pagan worship. Sarcophagi carved in relief had already become highly elaborate, and Christian versions adopted new styles, showing a series of different tightly packed scenes rather than one overall image (usually derived from Greek history painting) as was the norm. Soon the scenes were split into two registers, as in the Dogmatic Sarcophagus or the Sarcophagus of Junius Bassus (the last of these exemplifying a partial revival of classicism).

Nearly all of these more abstracted conventions could be observed in the glittering mosaics of the era, which during this period moved from being decoration derivative from painting used on floors (and walls likely to become wet) to a major vehicle of religious art in churches. The glazed surfaces of the tesserae sparkled in the light and illuminated the basilica churches. Unlike their fresco predecessors, much more emphasis was placed on demonstrating a symbolic fact rather than on rendering a realistic scene. As time progressed during the late antique period, art become more concerned with biblical themes and influenced by interactions of Christianity with the Roman state. Within this Christian subcategory of Roman art, dramatic changes were also taking place in the Depiction of Jesus. Jesus Christ had been more commonly depicted as an itinerant philosopher, teacher or as the &quot;Good Shepherd&quot;, resembling the traditional iconography of Hermes. He was increasingly given Roman elite status, and shrouded in purple robes like the emperors with orb and scepter in hand — this new type of depiction is variously thought to be derived from either the iconography of Jupiter or of classical philosophers.

As for luxury arts, manuscript illumination on vellum and parchment emerged from the 5th century, with a few manuscripts of Roman literary classics like the Vergilius Vaticanus and the Vergilius Romanus, but increasingly Christian texts, of which Quedlinburg Itala fragment (420–430) is the oldest survivor. Carved ivory diptychs were used for secular subjects, as in the imperial and consular diptychs presented to friends, as well as religious ones, both Christian and pagan – they seem to have been especially a vehicle for the last group of powerful pagans to resist Christianity, as in the late 4th century Symmachi–Nicomachi diptych. Extravagant hoards of silver plate are especially common from the 4th century, including the Mildenhall Treasure, Esquiline Treasure, Hoxne Hoard, and the imperial Missorium of Theodosius I.

==Literature==
In the field of literature, late antiquity is known for the declining use of classical Greek and Latin, and the rise of literary cultures in Syriac, Armenian, Georgian, Ethiopic, Arabic, and Coptic. It also marks a shift in literary style, with a preference for encyclopedic works in a dense and allusive style, consisting of summaries of earlier works (anthologies, epitomes) often dressed up in elaborate allegorical garb (e.g., &quot;De nuptiis Mercurii et Philologiae&quot; [The Marriage of Mercury and Philology] of Martianus Capella and the &quot;De arithmetica&quot;, &quot;De musica&quot;, and of Boethius—both later key works in medieval education). The 4th and 5th centuries also saw an explosion of Christian literature, of which Greek writers such as Eusebius of Caesarea, Basil of Caesarea, Gregory of Nazianzus and John Chrysostom and Latin writers such as Ambrose of Milan, Jerome and Augustine of Hippo are only among the most renowned representatives. On the other hand, authors such as Ammianus Marcellinus (4th century) and Procopius of Caesarea (6th century) were able to keep the tradition of classical Hellenistic historiography alive in the Byzantine empire. Due to several factors of the era, among them the political instability and the constant military threats, treatises on war became a popular genre with the Byzantine military manuals achieving great renown and influence: the most famous of which is the &quot;Strategikon&quot; attributed to Emperor Maurice, written in the 6th century.

One genre of literature among Christian writers in this period was the Hexaemeron, dedicated to the composition of commentaries, homilies, and treatises concerned with the exegesis of the Genesis creation narrative. The first example of this was the Hexaemeron of Basil of Caesarea, with the first occurrence in Syriac literature being the Hexaemeron of Jacob of Serugh.

===Poetry===
Greek poets of the late antique period included Antoninus Liberalis, Quintus Smyrnaeus, Nonnus, Romanus the Melodist and Paul the Silentiary.

Latin poets included Ausonius, Paulinus of Nola, Claudian, Rutilius Namatianus, Orientius, Sidonius Apollinaris, Corippus and Arator.

Jewish poets included Yannai, Eleazar ben Killir and Yose ben Yose.

<doc id="823354" wikidata="Q2080822" url="?curid=823354" title="Clun">
<text>Clun is a town in south west Shropshire, England, and the Shropshire Hills Area of Outstanding Natural Beauty. The 2011 census recorded 680 people living in the town. Research by the Campaign for the Protection of Rural England suggests that Clun is one of the &quot;most tranquil&quot; locations in England.

==History==
Clun takes its name from the river upon whose banks it stands. Deriving from the Welsh , it shares its very early Brythonic root with the two rivers Colne, in Lancashire and Essex, each of which has a town of the same name on its banks.

Clun grew up around the site of an Anglo-Saxon church towards the end of the 7th century AD. However, in the surrounding area there was a scattered population at least as early as the Neolithic period, about 5000 years ago. Clun was on the historic drove road where flocks and herds were driven from Wales to the markets in the Midlands and London. At the time of the Norman Conquest Clun formed part of the extensive lands of Eadric the Wild, who led a revolt against King William I, whereon his lands were confiscated and given to Roger de Montgomery who was created Earl of Shrewsbury. Roger in turn granted 27 manors, of which Clun was the largest, to Picot de Say. These lands constituted a single Marcher Lordship which became known as the Barony of Clun. The de Say family established Clun Castle.
The 14th-century pack horse bridge that crosses the river connecting Saxon Clun to Norman Clun has given rise to a local saying: &quot;whoever crosses Clun Bridge comes back sharper than he went&quot;.

Clun Mill located to the north of the town is nicknamed the &quot;malevolent mill&quot; on account of numerous deaths having been recorded there and occupants disappearing after purchasing it. Last used around 1920, it opened as a youth hostel in 1932.

==Geography==
The town&#x27;s name is taken from that of the River Clun (), which flows from west to east through the settlement. The Clun Valley is dominated by agriculture, though some areas of woodland remain. The River Unk joins the Clun just to the west of the town.

The A488 and B4368 roads cross in the town of Clun. Craven Arms, Bishop&#x27;s Castle and Ludlow are the neighbouring Shropshire towns, and Knighton, which is in Wales, is to the south. Nearby is Offa&#x27;s Dyke and the Offa&#x27;s Dyke Path. Clun Forest is to the west of the town, further upstream of the Rivers Unk and Clun. The Jack Mytton Way passes through the town as does the Shropshire Way and further significant historic routes pass through the area.
The town centre on the north bank of the River Clun lies above sea level while the oldest part of the settlement, by St George&#x27;s Church on the south bank, is a little more elevated, at . Between the two, Clun Bridge above sea level) carries the A488 and B4368 routes across the river.

In addition to Clun Bridge there is also a ford further downstream, at Waterloo, which has recently been made usable to most motor vehicles, A third crossing point, a footbridge just upstream of Clun Bridge, connects the town&#x27;s main car park to the castle grounds.

The population of the civil parish of Clun was 1,184 as measured by the 2011 census. The population of the town is considerably less than that of its much wider parish, recorded as just 680 people in 2011, compared with 642 in 2001; this is a population normally associated with that of a village in modern-day England. It is said that the population of the town is now smaller than it was during the flourishing days of the wool trade in England centuries ago. The town is the smallest in Shropshire and is smaller than many villages in the county. It is also the only town in Shropshire never to have had a railway line or station.

The electoral division of Clun covers a much wider area than the civil parish and the population of this division recorded at the 2011 census was 3,964.

==Attractions==

Attractions in the town include:

*the Norman Clun Castle, now only a ruin but with grounds which are used for the May fair
*the fifteenth century Clun Bridge (basically a packhorse bridge), most of which is still the original stone despite being a road bridge today used by all vehicles
*Trinity Hospital, almshouses built in 1614, on Hospital Lane
*a museum in Clun Town Hall, on the corner of The Square and High Street

The main church in the town is St George&#x27;s Church, which is situated on the steep rise out of the town (&quot;Church Street&quot;) to the south of Clun Bridge. The nave includes Norman columns, but the entire church apart from the tower was rebuilt extensively by the Victorian architect G. E. Street in 1877.

Clun is a popular starting point for walkers who wish to explore the Shropshire Way, the Jack Mytton Way or the local circular walks. A walkers&#x27; car park is situated at the Memorial Hall.

==Facilities==
The main streets in the town are Enfield Street, The Square, High Street, Ford Street, Bridge Street and Church Street. Along these streets are a handful of shops including a hair salon and a convenience store. The town previously had two butchers, which have since closed. However, there are two cafes, one directly on the bridge in a beautiful spot. Caractacus is a shop selling many things from candles to cards in the Square and further along on Ford Street is Craft Creations which opens on selected days and sells handcrafted items made by artisans in the Clun Valley. There is also a post office (now within the convenience store) and a museum in the Square. On the Craven Arms Road there are a number of small businesses (mostly at &quot;The Green Industrial Estate&quot;), as well as the local fire station.

There are two pubs in the town – the Sun Inn and the White Horse Inn. The Buffalo Head Hotel (&quot;the Buffalo&quot;) has been closed since about 2004, but has not yet been converted into another use (it lies dormant). The White Horse has an entry in the CAMRA &quot;Good Beer Guide&quot; 2015.

The town has a primary school (St George&#x27;s). Renowned for its great nursery, the school is situated near the church where it holds its annual nativity and various festivals and plays, open to children and parents. The school has a reputation across Shropshire for its excellent education and student support.

There are two community centres: the Memorial Hall (dedicated to local dead of both World Wars whose names are listed on boards indoors) in the north, which hosts community events such as sports days and flicks in the sticks (regular showings of films and plays), and can also be rented out for weddings; and the Hightown Community Room, located in the south

There is also a Youth Hostel at Clun Mill, just to the north of the town.

There is a short stay car park on the B4368 Newcastle Road, near Clun Bridge, where there are public toilets, although walkers and tourists are encouraged to use the longer stay Memorial Hall car park to prevent overcrowding.

==Festivals==
Over the three days of the first May bank holiday every year, the Green Man festival is held. On the bank holiday Monday the Green Man enters Clun to battle the spirit of winter at Clun Bridge and a May fair is held in the grounds of Clun Castle with a May Queen.

The last weekend in June is Clun Open Gardens. Approximately 20 private gardens are open to the public. Cream teas, plants, books and refurbished garden tools are all on sale. St George&#x27;s Church is the host to flower arrangements and also holds music recitals.

The first Saturday in August every year sees the Clun Carnival and Show take place with a procession through the town&#x27;s streets and a fete at the playing fields to the north of the town. Local people of all ages flock to exhibit their marrows, Victoria sponges and flower arrangements in the show tent. There are many stalls, a bouncy castle and a tea tent.

The first weekend in October sees the Clun Valley Beer Festival which takes place in the six open pubs in the valley (from Anchor to Aston on Clun).

==Media==
In terms of television, the town is covered by BBC Midlands Today and ITV News Central both broadcast from Birmingham. Television signals are received from the local relay transmitter which is transmitted from the Wrekin transmitter, it is situated south east of the town.

Local radio stations are BBC Radio Shropshire on 104.1 FM, Sunshine Radio on 105.9 FM, Greatest Hits Radio Black Country &amp; Shropshire on 106.5 FM, and Hits Radio Black Country &amp; Shropshire on 103.1 FM.

The &quot;Shropshire Star&quot; is the local newspaper which covers the town.

==Related uses of the name==

Clun is also a term used sometimes for the extreme southwest part of the county of Shropshire. Shropshire Council has an electoral division called Clun which covers Clun and the surrounding parishes. From the 2009 elections this electoral division continued to exist, though became slightly smaller. The electoral division returns one councillor to the council. The term &quot;Clun Valley&quot; is also used for the villages and communities along the River Clun – such as Anchor, Newcastle and Aston on Clun.

<doc id="823391" wikidata="Q376581" url="?curid=823391" title="Jack Crawford (tennis)">
<text>John Herbert Crawford, (22 March 1908 – 10 September 1991) was an Australian tennis player during the 1930s. He was the World No. 1 amateur for 1933, during which year he won the Australian Open, the French Open, and Wimbledon, and was runner-up at the U.S. Open in five sets, thus missing the Grand Slam by one set that year. He also won the Australian Open in 1931, 1932, and 1935. He was inducted into the International Tennis Hall of Fame in 1979.

==Early life==
Crawford was born on 22 March 1908 in Urangeline, near Albury, New South Wales, the second youngest child of Jack Sr. and Lottie Crawford. He had no tennis training as a child and practised mainly by hitting against the house and school and playing his older brother. Crawford played his first competition match at age 12 in a mixed doubles match at the Haberfield club. He won the Australian junior championships four consecutive times from 1926 to 1929 which entitled him to the permanent possession of the trophy.

==Career==
Although he won a number of major championship titles he is perhaps best known for something he did not do – complete the tennis Grand Slam in 1933, five years before Don Budge accomplished the feat for the first time in 1938.

In 1933, Crawford won the Australian Championships, French Championships, and Wimbledon Championships, leaving him needing to win the U.S. Championships to complete the Grand Slam. An asthmatic who suffered in the muggy summer heat of Forest Hills, Crawford was leading the Englishman Fred Perry in the final of the US Championships by two sets to one when his strength began to fade. It was said that Crawford was an asthmatic who frequently took brandy mixed with sugar to help his breathing during matches, and on the muggy afternoon in Forest Hills he was said to have downed two or three doses of the concoction, though there are differing accounts of what Crawford actually drank. Crawford ended up losing the match by the final score of 3–6, 13–11, 6–4, 0–6, 1–6.

Crawford was ranked World No. 1 amateur in 1933 by A. Wallis Myers, Bernard Brown, Pierre Gillou,
Didier Poulain, John R. Tunis (&quot;The Literary Digest&quot;), Harry Hopman (&quot;Melbourne Herald&quot;), Alfred Chave (&quot;Brisbane Telegraph&quot;), &quot;Set&quot; (&quot;The West Australian&quot;) and Ellsworth Vines.

Crawford exacted some measure of revenge against Perry at the 1935 Australian, winning the final against Perry in four sets. Historically, he was competing in his tenth straight major final, a record matched only by Big Bill Tilden and then joined by Roger Federer. He advanced to his last Australian finals in 1936 and 1940, felled each time by fellow Aussie Adrian Quist, but he had set a record by making seven Australian finals appearances, equaled only by Roy Emerson in 1967.

In his 1979 autobiography Jack Kramer, the long-time tennis promoter and great player himself, included Crawford in his list of the 21 greatest players of all time.

Crawford was inducted into the International Tennis Hall of Fame in Newport, Rhode Island in 1979 and into the Australian Tennis Hall of Fame in 1997. He was made an Officer of the Order of the British Empire (OBE) in the 1977 New Year Honours for his services to sport.

==Playing style==

Crawford was a right-handed baseline player with a game that was based more on technical skills and accuracy than on power. He was not particularly fast but had excellent anticipation and his game was described as fluent and effortless. His style was compared with Henri Cochet. Crawford always wore long, white pressed flannels and a long-sleeved shirt. He played with an old-fashioned flat-topped racket produced by the Alexander Patent Racket Company in Launceston, Tasmania.

<text>Holbæk () is a town in Denmark and the seat of Holbæk municipality with a population of 30,503 (1 January 2024). It is located in the northwestern part of Region Sjælland, Denmark.

Holbæk is located on Zealand, on the banks of Holbæk Fjord, an inlet of the larger Isefjord. Holbæk is a commercial and industrial center for the surrounding area.

Holbæk is first mentioned in official documents in Absalon&#x27;s letter of 8 June 1199, in which he granted the majority of his estates to Sorø Klosterkirke in Sorø. It was called Holbækgaard, a larger farm belonging to a nobleman, around which the city eventually developed.

Next it appears in Valdemar the Victorious&#x27;s book of properties (see Kong Valdemars Jordebog on the Danish Wikipedia) in 1231. Valdmar broke ground for Holbæk Slot (Holbæk Castle) in 1236.

Holbæk grew from then on but is not mentioned again until around 1400 when Margaret I came for a court proceeding that granted her territories in Jutland. The event may have triggered the creation of the first city seal, which shows the three trees by the water that are the prominent features of the current seal.

<doc id="823398" wikidata="Q33357" url="?curid=823398" title="Crimean Tatar language">
<text>Crimean Tatar (), also called Crimean (), is a Kipchak Turkic language spoken in Crimea and the Crimean Tatar diasporas of Uzbekistan, Turkey and Bulgaria, as well as small communities in the United States and Canada. It should not be confused with Tatar, spoken in Tatarstan and adjacent regions in Russia; the two languages are related, but belong to different subgroups of the Kipchak languages, while maintaining a significant degree of mutual intelligibility. Crimean Tatar has been extensively influenced by nearby Oghuz dialects and is also mutually intelligible with them to varying degrees.

A long-term ban on the study of the Crimean Tatar language following the deportation of the Crimean Tatars by the Soviet government has led to the fact that at the moment UNESCO ranked the Crimean Tatar language among the languages under serious threat of extinction (&quot;severely endangered&quot;). However, according to the Institute of Oriental Studies, due to negative situations, the real degree of threat has elevated to critically endangered languages in recent years, which are highly likely to face extinction in the coming generations.

Crimean language is one of the official languages of the Autonomous Republic of Crimea (Ukraine), along with Ukrainian and Russian. It is also one of the state languages of the Republic of Crimea (Russian occupation, considered &quot;temporarily occupied territories&quot; by the Ukrainian government), the other ones being Ukrainian and Russian.

==Number of speakers==
Today, more than 260,000 Crimean Tatars live in Crimea. Approximately 120,000 reside in Central Asia (mainly in Uzbekistan), where their ancestors had been deported in 1944 during World War II by the Soviet Union. However, of all these people, mostly the older generations are the only ones still speaking Crimean Tatar. In 2013, the language was estimated to be on the brink of extinction, being taught in only around 15 schools in Crimea.

Turkey has provided support to Ukraine, to aid in bringing the schools teaching in Crimean Tatar to a modern state.
An estimated 5 million people of Crimean origin live in Turkey, descendants of those who emigrated in the 19th and early 20th centuries. Smaller Crimean Tatar communities such as (Dobrujan Tatars) are also found in Romania () and Bulgaria ().

Crimean Tatar is one of the most seriously endangered languages in Europe. Almost all Crimean Tatars are bilingual or multilingual, using the dominant languages of their respective home countries, such as Russian, Turkish, Romanian, Uzbek, Bulgarian or Ukrainian.

==Classification and dialects==
The Crimean Tatar language consists of three or four dialects. Among them is also the southern dialect, also known as the coastal dialect (yalıboyu, cenübiy), which is in the Oghuz branch of Turkic languages commonly spoken in Turkey, Azerbaijan and Turkmenistan

==History==

The formation period of the Crimean Tatar spoken dialects began with the first Turkic invasions of Crimea by Cumans and Pechenegs and ended during the period of the Crimean Khanate. However, the official written languages of the Crimean Khanate were Chagatai and Ottoman Turkish. After Islamization, Crimean Tatars wrote with an Arabic script.

In 1876, the different Turkic Crimean dialects were made into a uniform written language by Ismail Gasprinski. A preference was given to the Oghuz dialect of the Yalıboylus, in order to not break the link between the Crimeans and the Turks of the Ottoman Empire. In 1928, the language was reoriented to the middle dialect spoken by the majority of the people.

In 1928, the alphabet was replaced with the Uniform Turkic Alphabet based on the Latin script. The Uniform Turkic Alphabet was replaced in 1938 by a Cyrillic alphabet. During the 1990s and 2000s, the government of the Autonomous Republic of Crimea under Ukraine encouraged replacing the script with a Latin version again, but the Cyrillic has still been widely used (mainly in published literature, newspapers and education). The current Latin-based Crimean Tatar alphabet is the same as the Turkish alphabet, with two additional characters: Ñ ñ and Q q. In the Russian-annexed &quot;Republic of Crimea&quot; all official communications and education in Crimean Tatar are conducted exclusively in the Cyrillic alphabet.

==Phonology==

===Vowels===

The vowel system of Crimean Tatar is similar to some other Turkic languages. Because high vowels in Crimean Tatar are short and reduced, and are realized close to , even though they are phonologically distinct.

===Consonants===

In addition to these phonemes, Crimean also displays marginal phonemes that occur in borrowed words, especially palatalized consonants.

The southern (coastal) dialect substitutes for , e.g. standard &quot;qara&quot; &#x27;black&#x27;, southern &quot;xara&quot;.
At the same time the southern and some central dialects preserve glottal which is pronounced in the standard language. The northern dialect on the contrary lacks and , substituting for and for . The northern is usually , often in the place of , compare standard &quot;dağ&quot; and northern &quot;taw&quot; &#x27;mountain&#x27; (also in other Oghuz and Kipchak languages, such as and ).

 and are usually fronted, close to and .

== Grammar ==
The grammar of Crimean Tatar, like all Turkic languages, is agglutinating, with the exclusive use of suffixing to express grammatical categories. Generally, suffixes are attached to the ends of word stems, although derivational morphology makes uses of compounding as well. Overall, the grammatical structure of the language is similar to that of other West Kipchak varieties. Crimean Tatar is a pro-drop language with a generally SOV word order.

=== Morphophonology ===
Crimean Tatar, like most Turkic languages, features pervasive vowel harmony, which results in sound changes when suffixes are added to verb or noun stems. Essentially, the vowel in a suffix undergoes assimilation to agree in certain categories with the vowel in the stem. The two main types of assimilation that characterize this agreement in Crimean Tatar morphophonology are backness harmony and rounding harmony.

Using the transliteration system in Kavitskaya (2010), non-high vowels undergoing backness harmony vary between [a] and [e], and are represented as A. High vowels that undergo both backness and rounding harmony alternate between [i], [y], [ɪ] and [u] and are represented as I. High vowels in suffixes that are never rounded and alternate between [i] and [ɪ] are represented as Y, whereas high vowels in suffixes that are always round and alternate between [u] and [y] are represented as U.

Some consonants undergo similar harmonizing changes depending on whether the preceding segment is voiced or voiceless, or whether the segment demonstrates backness harmony. Consonants that alternate between [k], [q], [g] and [ɣ] are represented as K, alternating [k] and [g] as G, alternating [t] and [d] by D, and alternating [tʃ] and [dʒ] as Ç.

Thus, the suffix -&quot;şAr&quot; could be rendered as &quot;şar&quot; or &quot;şer&quot; depending on the vowel in the morpheme preceding it.

=== Verbs ===
Crimean Tatar verbal morphology is fairly complex, inflecting for tense, number, person, aspect, mood and voice. Verbs are conjugated according to the following paradigm:

It is possible, albeit rare, for a single verb to contain all of these possible components, as in:

For the most part, each type of suffix would only appear once in any given word, although it is possible in some circumstances for causative suffixes to double up.

Infinitive verbs take the -&quot;mAK&quot; suffix and can be negated by the addition of the suffix -&quot;mA&quot; between the verb stem and the infinitive suffix, creating verb constructions that do not easily mirror English.


Verb derivation 
Novel verb stems are derived chiefly by applying a verbalizing suffix to a noun or adjective, as demonstrated in the following examples:



Bare verb stems can also be compounded with noun stems to create new verbs, as in:
Person markers

There are two types of person markers for finite verbs, pronominal and possessive. Depending on tense and mood, verbs will take one or the other set of endings.
::
:::
Grammatical person is not marked in third person singular, and the marker is optional in third person plural. As shown above, these markers come as the last element in the broader verb complex.

Tense and aspect markers 

Grammatical tense and aspect are expressed in combination by the addition of various markers to the verb stem. Some of these markers match with pronominal person markers, while others take possessive person markers. Each tense/aspect has an associated negation marker; most of these are -&quot;mA&quot; but there is some variation.

A separate set of compound tenses are formed by adding the past tense copula &quot;edi&quot;- to the derived forms listed above.

Mood

The imperative is formed using a specific set of person markers, and negated using -&quot;mA&quot;. In second person imperatives, only the bare verb stem is used. A first person imperative expresses an &quot;I/we should do X&quot; sentiment, whereas third person expresses &quot;let him/her do X,&quot; as shown below with &quot;unut&quot; (&quot;to forget&quot;):




Other moods are constructed similarly to tense/aspect forms.

Voice 

Grammatical voice is expressed by the addition of suffixes which come in sequence before negation, tense, aspect, mood and person markers. There are several causative suffixes which vary depending on the ending of the verb stem.
::
:::
Participles 
Past, future and present participles are formed by the addition of suffixes and are negated in the same way as other verbs.



Copula 
The copula &quot;ol&quot; (&quot;to be, become, exist&quot;) is generally expressed as a predicate suffix in the present tense, closely resembling the pronominal person endings, as displayed below. The third person endings are frequently deleted in colloquial speech. The copula’s past tense form, &quot;edi&quot;, is suppletive. Future tense copular forms are constructed by the addition of the categorical future suffix -&quot;cAK&quot;.
::

VB:Verbalizing Suffix
&lt;section end=&quot;list-of-glossing-abbreviations&quot;/&gt;


Converbs 

Converbs, a characteristic of many Turkic languages, express sequential or dependent action. Present tense converbs are formed by the addition of the suffixes -&quot;A&quot; (used after consonants) and -&quot;y&quot; (used after vowels). In past tense, converbs take the suffix -&quot;Ip&quot;. Thus:

=== Nouns ===
Crimean Tatar noun stems take suffixes which express grammatical number, case and possession. As in all other Turkic languages, there is no grammatical gender in Crimean Tatar. Nouns are declined according to the following paradigm:

Noun derivation 
Noun stems are derived in a number of ways. Most commonly, a bare noun stem can take a denominal suffix which alters its basic meaning. Similarly, a bare verb stem can take a deverbal suffix that converts it into a noun. There are many such denominal and deverbal suffixes in Crimean Tatar; some common suffixes are shown below: 



Noun stems can also be reduplicated, which lends a more generalized meaning. The last method of noun derivation is through the compounding of two noun stems. Thus:


Number

Nouns are pluralized by the addition of the suffix -lAr to the noun stem. The vowel in this plural suffix agrees phonetically with the final vowel in the stem.

Use of the plural can also express respect, as in:

Possession 

Possession is expressed through person-specific suffixing. As with the plural suffix, possession suffixes harmonize with the preceding vowel in regular ways.
::

Case

Crimean Tatar has six grammatical cases. The nominative case is unmarked, and the remaining cases are expressed through suffixing. These suffixes come last in a fully declined noun.

=== Pronouns ===
Like nouns, pronouns are inflected for number, person and case but not for gender. 

The second person plural pronoun can be used to denote formality or respect, even if its referent is a single person.

There are two roots, &quot;öz&quot;- and &quot;kendi&quot;-, that express reflexivity. Of the two, &quot;kendi&quot;- is more common in the southern dialect, but both are used throughout the entire area in which Crimean Tatar is spoken.

Possessive pronouns are formed by adding the suffix -&quot;ki&quot; to the genitive form of a personal pronoun, as in:

=== Adjectives ===
Adjectives in Crimean Tatar precede the nouns they modify. They do not show agreement, and as such do not take any of the case, person or possession suffixes.

Adjectives can be derived by the addition of certain suffixes to a noun or verb stem.

&lt;section begin=&quot;list-of-glossing-abbreviations&quot;/&gt;
SUF:adjectival suffix
&lt;section end=&quot;list-of-glossing-abbreviations&quot;/&gt;

The comparative and superlative forms of adjectives are expressed, respectively, by the suffix -&quot;ÇA&quot; and the particle &quot;eñ&quot;, as in the following examples: 


An idiomatic superlative form using &quot;episi&quot; (&quot;all&quot;) in the ablative case is also possible.

=== Postpositions ===
Crimean Tatar uses postpositions. Each postposition governs a specific case, either dative, genitive or ablative. Some common postpositions are shown below: 

==Writing systems==

Crimean Tatar is written in either the Cyrillic or Latin alphabets, both modified to the specific needs of Crimean Tatar, and either used respective to where the language is used.

Historically, the Arabic script was used from the sixteenth century. In the Soviet Union, it was replaced by a Latin alphabet based on Yañalif in 1928, and by a Cyrillic alphabet in 1938.

After Russia&#x27;s annexation of Crimea in 2014, Cyrillic became the sole script allowed in Russian occupied Crimea because according to the Constitutional Court of Russia decision made in 2004, all languages of Russia must use Cyrillic. However there are some contradictions to the decision: virtually all Finnic languages, including distantly-related Skolt Sámi, spoken in Russia, however, currently use the Latin script as their sister languages Finnish and Estonian do, despite the historical existence of Karelian Cyrillic alphabet.

In 1992, a Latin alphabet based on Common Turkic Alphabet was adopted by the decision of the Qurultay of the Crimean Tatar People, which was formally supported by the Supreme Council of Crimea in 1997 but never implemented officially on practical level. However, in 2021, the Ministry of Reintegration of Temporarily Occupied Territories of Ukraine has announced it begins the implementation of the decision, with vice premier Oleksii Reznikov supporting the transition by stating that Latin corresponds better to Turkic phonetics. The ministry revealed it plans to finish the transition to Latin by 2025, which was supported by the Mejlis of the Crimean Tatar People. The alphabet is co-developed by A. Yu. Krymskyi Institute of Oriental Studies, Potebnia Institute of Linguistics, Institute of Philology of Taras Shevchenko National University of Kyiv and Tavrida National V.I. Vernadsky University.

===Arabic alphabet===
Crimean Tatars used Arabic script from the 16th century to 1928.

Note:
# The letter ﻙ (kef) is often used in place of ﮒ and ﯓ.

===Latin alphabet===
Â â is not considered to be a separate letter. Usually it represents the near-open front unrounded vowel, /æ/.

===Cyrillic alphabet===
The digraphs гъ, къ, нъ and дж are separate letters.

== Sample ==
Universal Declaration of Human Rights, Article 1:

Bütün insanlar serbestlik, menlik ve uquqlarda musaviy olıp dünyağa keleler. Olar aqıl ve vicdan saibidirler ve biri-birilerinen qardaşçasına munasebette bulunmalıdırlar.

==Legal status==

The Crimean peninsula is internationally recognized as territory of Ukraine, but since the 2014 annexation by the Russian Federation is de facto administered as part of the Russian Federation.

According to Russian law, by the April 2014 constitution of the Republic of Crimea and the 2017 Crimean language law, the Crimean Tatar language is a state language in Crimea alongside Russian and Ukrainian, while Russian is the state language of the Russian Federation, the language of interethnic communication, and required in public postings in the conduct of elections and referendums.

In Ukrainian law, according to the constitution of the Autonomous Republic of Crimea, as published in Russian by its Verkhovna Rada, Russian and Crimean Tatar languages enjoy a &quot;protected&quot; () status; every citizen is entitled, at his request (), to receive government documents, such as &quot;passport, birth certificate and others&quot; in Crimean Tatar; but Russian is the language of interethnic communication and to be used in public life. According to the constitution of Ukraine, Ukrainian is the state language. Recognition of Russian and Crimean Tatar was a matter of political and legal debate.

Before the Sürgünlik, the 18 May 1944 deportation by the Soviet Union of Crimean Tatars to internal exile in Uzbek SSR, Crimean Tatar had an official language status in the Crimean Autonomous Soviet Socialist Republic.

== Media ==
The first Crimean Tatar newspaper was &quot;Terciman&quot; published in 1883-1918 by Ismail Gasprinsky. Some other Crimean Tatar media include: &quot;ATR&quot;, &quot;Qırım Aqiqat&quot;, &quot;Qırım&quot;, &quot;Meydan&quot;, &quot;Qırım Alemi&quot;, &quot;Avdet&quot;, &quot;Yañı Dünya&quot;, &quot;Yıldız&quot;.
