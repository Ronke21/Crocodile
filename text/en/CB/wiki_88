<text>John Carmel Heenan (26 January 1905 – 7 November 1975) was a senior-ranking English prelate of the Catholic Church. He served as Archbishop of Westminster from 1963 until his death, and was elevated to the cardinalate in 1965.

==Biography==

===Early life and ordination===
John Heenan was born in Ilford, Essex, the youngest of four children of Irish parents John and Anne Heenan (née Pilkington). He auditioned for Westminster Cathedral Choir School at age 9, but Sir Richard Terry rejected him for his &quot;metallic voice&quot;. Heenan studied at St. Ignatius College in Stamford Hill, Ushaw College in Durham, and the Venerable English College in Rome before being ordained to the priesthood on 6 July 1930. He then did pastoral work in Brentwood until 1947, at which time he became Superior of the Catholic Missionary Society of England and Wales. In this position, Heenan criticized the United States for being too concerned about communism, and not enough about spiritual matters. By this time he had published a biography (1943) of Cardinal Hinsley, Archbishop of Westminster, who had recently died.

===Bishop===
On 27 January 1951, Heenan was appointed the fifth Bishop of Leeds by Pope Pius XII. He received his episcopal consecration on the following 12 March from Archbishop William Godfrey, Apostolic Delegate to Great Britain, with Joseph McCormack, Bishop of Hexham and Newcastle, and John Petit, Bishop of Menevia, serving as co-consecrators. Named the sixth Archbishop of Liverpool on 2 May 1957, Heenan was later appointed the eighth Archbishop of Westminster on 2 September 1963. As Archbishop of Westminster, he served as the spiritual leader of the Catholic Church in England and Wales. In 1968, Heenan was elected President of the Catholic Bishops&#x27; Conference of England and Wales. 

===Positions during the Second Vatican Council===
A participant of the Second Vatican Council (1962–1965), Heenan showed himself to be of a conservative mind. He opposed &quot;Gaudium et spes&quot;, the council&#x27;s constitution on the church in the modern world, saying that it had been &quot;written by clerics with no knowledge of the world&quot;. He also condemned the &quot;periti&quot;, or theological experts, who sought to change the church&#x27;s doctrine on birth control. Moreover, despite the risks to ecumenism, Heenan later supported the canonization of the forty martyrs.

===Cardinal===
He was created Cardinal-Priest of &quot;S. Silvestro in Capite&quot; by Pope Paul VI in the consistory of 22 February 1965.

He died from a heart attack in London at age 70, and is buried in Westminster Cathedral, under the twelfth Station of the Cross (&quot;Jesus dies on the Cross&quot;).

Heenan shared a lengthy correspondence with author Evelyn Waugh regarding the Second Vatican Council. A compilation of their letters, &quot;A Bitter Trial: Evelyn Waugh and John Carmel Cardinal Heenan on the Liturgical Changes&quot;, was first published in 1996 and reprinted in an expanded edition in 2011.

*&quot;A church that is half empty is half full.&quot;
*&quot;At home it is not only women and children but also fathers of families and young men who come regularly to mass. If we were to offer them the kind of ceremony we saw yesterday in the Sistine Chapel we would soon be left with a congregation mostly of women and children.&quot;

<doc id="840879" wikidata="Q1627250" url="?curid=840879" title="Highfather">
<text>Highfather (Izaya) is a fictional character appearing in American comic books published by DC Comics. An integral part of Jack Kirby&#x27;s Fourth World mythos, Highfather is a New God, the leader of the planet New Genesis, and the good counterpart of Darkseid.

Highfather has been adapted into various media outside comics, primarily in association with the New Gods. Mitchell Ryan, Mark Rolston, and Richard Chamberlain have voiced the character in animation.

==Publication history==
Highfather was created by Jack Kirby and first appeared in &quot;The New Gods&quot; #1 (March 1971).

The character played a significant role in &quot;The Great Darkness Saga&quot;, a 1982 storyline in &quot;Legion of Super-Heroes&quot;. In the story, he is reborn in the 31st century and helps the Legion battle Darkseid.

==Fictional character history==
Izaya is a warrior and the leader of New Genesis. After Steppenwolf murders his wife Avia, Izaya participates in the war against Apokolips before enacting a peace treaty with them. To this end, he trades his son Scott Free to Apokolips and adopts Darkseid&#x27;s son Orion. Scott later escapes Apokolips, breaking the treaty.

Highfather often consults the Source when making his decisions. Though never stated explicitly in the &quot;New Gods&quot; series, the Source is implied to be some form of higher power (perhaps even God), making Izaya a spiritual as well as the political leader of his people. As ruler of New Genesis, he is kind, compassionate, and caring but ready to defend it from any threat.

In &quot;Genesis&quot;, Highfather is killed in battle with Ares and succeeded by Takion. His spirit joins the Quintessence, a council of cosmic entities.

In &quot;New Gods (vol. 5),&quot; Highfather is anxious over a prophecy from Metron about a child who will either bring peace, or war to New Genesis. He sends Orion to kill said child to prevent the prophecy from coming to pass.

In &quot;The New 52&quot; continuity reboot, Izaya is resurrected and depicted as the founder of New Genesis. Additionally, he is morally ambiguous rather than purely good, and Infinity-Man is the embodiment of his conscience.

==Powers and abilities==
As a New God, Highfather is nigh-immortal and possesses superhuman physical abilities. He can channel the Source via his staff and once wielded the Life Equation, which enabled him to manipulate reality.

==Other versions==
An alternate universe variant of Highfather appears in &quot;&quot;.

==In other media==

* Highfather appears in series set in the DC Animated Universe (DCAU). Following non-speaking cameo appearances in &quot;&quot;, he appears in the &quot;Justice League&quot; episode &quot;Twilight&quot;, voiced by Mitchell Ryan.
* Highfather appears in the fourth season of &quot;Young Justice&quot;, voiced by Mark Rolston. This version is named Iyaza and his wife Avia is still alive.

===Film===

This version wed Bekka to Orion to bring Apokolips and New Genesis together, subsequently betraying Darkseid and killing him and his elite, including Orion. This action causes Bekka to leave for Earth.

<doc id="840888" wikidata="Q2346961" url="?curid=840888" title="Orion (character)">
<text>Orion is a fictional superhero appearing in comic books published by DC Comics. He is the son of Darkseid and half-brother of Kalibak and Grayven who was traded to Highfather as part of a peace deal between Apokolips and New Genesis. Since then, Orion has assisted the New Gods of New Genesis against his father and was also a member of the Justice League.

Orion has appeared in various media outside comics, primarily in association with the New Gods. Steve Sandor, Ron Perlman, and Benjamin Diskin have voiced the character in animation.

==Publication history==
Orion first appeared in &quot;New Gods&quot; #1 (February 1971), and was created by writer/artist Jack Kirby.

===Jack Kirby era===
Orion originally appeared in &quot;New Gods&quot; #1 (February–March 1971) which was part of Jack Kirby&#x27;s Fourth World titles published in the early 1970s. Other titles included in this metaseries were &quot;Superman&#x27;s Pal Jimmy Olsen&quot;, &quot;Mister Miracle&quot; and &quot;The Forever People&quot;. When the titles were canceled, Orion and his fellow New Gods characters were unseen until DC returned to the Fourth World concept a few years later.

===Return of the New Gods===
Following an appearance in the final issue of &quot;1st Issue Special&quot;, DC revived both the &quot;New Gods&quot; and &quot;Mister Miracle&quot; series, continuing the numbering from the original series. The new stories were done without Jack Kirby and featured a number of changes of concept for the character of Orion. The character&#x27;s &quot;Astro Harness&quot; and trademark helmet were replaced by a more standard superhero costume with a yellow mask. The &quot;New Gods&quot; title was again canceled in 1978 but the story was wrapped up in two issues of &quot;Adventure Comics&quot; featuring a &quot;final battle&quot; between Orion and his father, Darkseid. In this battle Darkseid was supposedly annihilated.

This version of Orion returned in a three–issue arc of &quot;Justice League of America&quot; in which most of the New Gods were captured by the forces of Apokolips. Orion and his fellow New Gods, Metron, Mister Miracle, and Big Barda, summoned the aid of the Justice League and Justice Society to aid them in freeing the forces of New Genesis. This story featured the return, and eventual defeat, of Orion&#x27;s father.

===Post-Crisis===
Following &quot;Crisis on Infinite Earths&quot;, Orion was featured in the 1989–1990 series &quot;New Gods&quot; vol. 3 and served a short stint in the Justice League with his friend Lightray during the Keith Giffen/J. M. DeMatteis run. Orion returned as a main character in &quot;New Gods&quot; vol. 4 which was later relaunched as &quot;Jack Kirby&#x27;s Fourth World&quot;. Orion again served as a member of the Justice League during Grant Morrison&#x27;s tenure on the title, but the character would not receive his own title until 2000.

===Orion===
Orion was a series penciled and written by Walt Simonson, centered around the eponymous character and which ran for 25 issues (June 2000–June 2002). John Byrne filled in as penciller for the main stories in issues 13 and 14. Issues #1–5 were reprinted by DC Comics in the trade paperback &quot;The Gates of Apokolips&quot;. Also included as reprints were portions from the &quot;Secret Origins of Super-Villains 80-Page Giant&quot; #1 and the &quot;Legends of the DC Universe 80-Page Giant&quot; #2.

A backup that ran consistently in the Orion book was &quot;Tales of the New Gods&quot;. Simonson invited fellow artists and writers to provide a short story often supplementing the issue&#x27;s main action.

==Fictional character biography==

Orion is the second son of Darkseid, the dictator of Apokolips, and half-brother of Kalibak and Grayven. He later marries Bekka, the daughter of Apokolips resistance leader Himon. As a child, Orion was traded to New Genesis&#x27; benevolent leader Highfather for Scott Free, Highfather&#x27;s son, as part of a treaty between New Genesis and Apokolips. Raised as Highfather&#x27;s son, Orion was taught to control and focus his rage, and grew to value his adoptive home and its ideals. However, on top of his adoptive parent&#x27;s care, his friends among the New Gods, particularly Lightray, helped him channel his Dark Side toward the protection of New Genesis. As a result of that personal struggle, Orion&#x27;s inherited traits and learned focus allowed Orion to become the most powerful warrior and hero of New Genesis. His fighting skill, stamina, relentlessness, and ruthlessness have earned him the nickname &quot;The Dog of War&quot;, who still occasionally needs the aid of his Mother Box to help control his emotions when they threaten to get the better of him. Orion counts among his closest friends Lightray, Metron, Jezebelle, Scott Free, Big Barda, and Forager.

The 25–issue Walt Simonson series was designed to follow the continuity of the original Fourth World series and was published after John Byrne&#x27;s &quot;Jack Kirby&#x27;s Fourth World&quot; series ended. To flesh out the series, characters such as Fourth World stalwarts Lightray, Darkseid, DeSaad, and Kalibak were used in addition to lesser used characters such as Orion&#x27;s mother Tigra, Mortalla, and the Newsgroup Legion (an update of Jack Kirby&#x27;s 1940s Newsboy Legion). A collection of Simonson&#x27;s Orion stories was released in July 2018.

During Simonson&#x27;s series, Orion obtained the Anti-Life Equation, a mathematical equation that can eliminate free will. Darkseid has coveted the Anti-Life Equation for eons to take control of the multiverse. Orion&#x27;s mother lied to him about Darkseid not being his father. He then went to Apokolips and confronted Darkseid about his parentage. They fought for control of Apokolips with Orion refusing to use the Anti-Life Equation as a matter of pride and his warrior&#x27;s code. He defeated Darkseid and gained control of Apokolips. With the Anti-Life Equation, Orion went to Earth to begin creating intergalactic peace. He used the Anti-Life Equation to turn Earth into a utopian world by usurping all free will and following only his guidance. The lack of free will began disrupting the balance of the Multiverse as Earth is the linchpin holding it all together. It was then revealed that Darkseid, with guidance from Metron, allowed Orion to defeat him. They planned the defeat so that Darkseid could understand the potential of the Anti-Life Equation.
Orion has served two terms with the Justice League. He first demanded to join the League alongside his friend Lightray. They were accepted as Leaguers and stayed on until after the battle with the Evil Eye. Later, Orion and Big Barda were sent as agents of New Genesis to serve in the JLA. During his time in the League, Orion helped to defeat Starro when its actions put almost the entirety of North America to sleep and aided Green Lantern, Steel, Plastic Man, and Barda in capturing a White Martian that had regained its original memory. On one occasion, Orion and other Leaguers were abducted by the temporarily insane Adam Strange as part of a plot to defeat a telepathic race. Steel (John Henry Irons) was forced to steal Orion&#x27;s Mother Box and use it as a telepathic shield. Orion was enraged that his Mother Box was devoting to much energy and focus in keeping him calm to do anything else. Orion and Barda&#x27;s central mission was to help mobilize Earth&#x27;s heroes against the coming of the omnipotent, Old God tech-cosmic weapon known as Mageddon. Orion gave his Mother Box to Oracle for safe-keeping while he confronted Mageddon at full ferocity; channeling his inherited fury from Darkseid. Oracle used it to set up a telepathic, online network that could coordinate Earth&#x27;s defending heroes as they fought to stop wars that Mageddon&#x27;s mind controlling presence was inciting. Once Mageddon was defeated, Orion and Barda resigned from the Justice League.

Years later, Orion returns to Earth via Boom Tube for his final battle with Darkseid. During the celestial fight, Orion ultimately kills Darkseid by ripping his heart out. This created a firepit, like those on Apokolips, from Darkseid&#x27;s chest cavity and fulfilling the prophecy of their final battle. As Darkseid dies, a battered, wounded Orion walks away from the battlefield having &quot;won&quot; the battle against his father once and for all.

Darkseid&#x27;s life essence endured the death of his body and fell back in time and space; fracturing both as he fell toward his own personal Hell inside a black hole at the center of creation. As Darkseid fell, his essence was briefly reborn on Earth as Boss Dark Side. Darkseid&#x27;s Elite had been killed as well and their essences possessed human bodies as well. Using the super-villain Libra, Darkseid unleashes the Anti-Life Equation onto humanity and in the process, drags Earth outside time and space, threatening the multiverse. From this point, Darkseid sought his revenge against
Orion by firing a time travel-based gun backwards in time to kill Orion once and for all. The bullet killed Orion, who by this point had realized that his father and his fellow evil New Gods still lived and were now possessing human beings as host bodies. With his last strength, Orion warns the man who finds his dying body, Detective Dan Turpin, that &quot;They are not dead - He is in you all&quot;. His final command, appropriate for the Dog of War, is for humanity to &quot;Fight...&quot; before he finally dies.

Darkseid&#x27;s murder of his son would ultimately backfire on him. Green Lantern John Stewart would recover the bullet that was used to kill Orion and give it to Batman, who would ultimately be forced to mortally wound Darkseid with the very same bullet Darkseid used to kill his own son, an irony that Superman pointed out when he described the murder of Orion as &quot;suicide&quot; on Darkseid&#x27;s part, due to the fate of the bullet.

While many of the Gods from New Genesis were reborn following &quot;Final Crisis&quot;, Orion is not among them. Metron is seen standing over his astro-harness in effigy.

===The New 52===
In The New 52, a 2011 reboot of the DC Comics universe, Orion appears as a supporting character in the &quot;Wonder Woman&quot; title. After consulting with the Source, he first joins Wonder Woman in her search for a child which was abducted by the gods of Olympia.

=== DC Rebirth ===
In 2016, DC Comics implemented another relaunch of its books called &quot;DC Rebirth&quot; which restored its continuity to a form much as it was prior to &quot;The New 52&quot;. Orion appears in the &quot;Mister Miracle&quot; (2018) series by Tom King and Mitch Gerads in an antagonistic role to the hero, Mister Miracle. He is later killed by Darkseid. However, the reality of this story is questionable whether or not the events in the book truly took place or are canon.

===New Justice===
Orion also appears in the &quot;Justice League Odyssey&quot; series, rescuing the Green Lantern Jessica Cruz after Darkseid kills her. Initially, he is under the guise of Okkult until the ruse is discovered and he continues to appear as Orion.

==Powers and abilities==
Orion belongs to an extraterrestrial race of supernatural immortals known as the New Gods. As a New God, he possesses the standard superhuman attributes of strength, speed, stamina and durability on par with his father Darkseid as well as with Superman; being virtually indestructible, able to run at supersonic speeds up to orbital speed, and lift weights exceeding 100 tons. Although he is a highly skilled warrior, noted for a fierce warrior&#x27;s instinct, his great rage and inner turmoil makes him impulsive and prone to violent, almost psychotic outbursts as he has inherited much of his father&#x27;s darkness. He has access to a Mother Box that can calm his temper and change his appearance, &quot;smoothing&quot; out his coarse features. In addition, Orion possesses a regenerative healing factor, and is able to call upon his Mother Box to assist in healing injuries or to sustain his life energies. Like all other New Gods, Orion is vulnerable to a substance called Radion. The &quot;Astro-Harness&quot; is an alien artifact of unknown origin, capable of self-repair; flight at light speed; interstellar teleportation; energy projection and absorption; force field generation; and possesses a tractor beam. Orion&#x27;s wristbands are virtually indestructible.

Orion is able to harness an interdimensional energy called the &quot;Astro Force&quot;. While Orion himself is a conduit for the Astro Force, he can use either the Astro Harness or his Astro Wristbands as a valve through which he can project this energy. He uses the Astro Force primarily as a weapon, but once he was shown to be able to use the Astro Force to create an energy shield powerful enough to deflect Darkseid&#x27;s otherwise unstoppable &quot;Omega Effect&quot;. Like his father and all members of the Fourth World, Orion is immortal.

<text>DeSaad (also spelled Desaad) is a supervillain, appearing in books published by DC Comics. He is one of the followers of Darkseid from the planet Apokolips in Jack Kirby&#x27;s Fourth World meta-series.

As DeSaad serves as Darkseid&#x27;s master torturer, his name refers to the Marquis de Sade. At one point, DeSaad had an assistant named Justeen, a reference to de Sade&#x27;s novel &quot;Justine&quot;, although she bore little resemblance to the title character.

Steve Byers portrays DeSaad in the television series &quot;Smallville&quot;. The character made his cinematic debut in &quot;Zack Snyder&#x27;s Justice League&quot; (2021), portrayed through voice and motion capture by Peter Guinness.

==Publication history==
DeSaad first appeared in &quot;Forever People&quot; #2 (April/May 1971) and was created by Jack Kirby.

DeSaad is originally a New God from New Genesis before Darkseid corrupts him into serving him. Afterwards, DeSaad assists Darkseid in killing his brother Drax, and becomes his torturer.

In the &quot;Superman/Batman&quot; story &quot;Torment&quot;, Darkseid tasks DeSaad with retrieving Highfather&#x27;s staff to restore his power. He betrays Darkseid and attempts to take the staff for himself before Darkseid siphons its energy.

In &quot;Countdown to Final Crisis&quot;, DeSaad captures Martin Stein, one half of the hero Firestorm, and steals his power. The Atomic Knights defeat DeSaad and separate him from the Firestorm matrix, but he escapes.

In &quot;Salvation Run&quot;, DeSaad trains the Apokoliptian New Gods on a planet where Amanda Waller&#x27;s Suicide Squad has exiled several villains. In &quot;Death of the New Gods&quot; and &quot;Final Crisis&quot;, DeSaad respectively possesses an unnamed man and Mary Marvel.

In &quot;The New 52&quot; continuity reboot, DeSaad contemplates incorporating Superman&#x27;s DNA into a new type of Parademon. Five years later, he impersonates Michael Holt in an attempt to capture Power Girl.

==Powers and abilities==
As a New God, DeSaad is nigh-immortal and possesses superhuman strength and durability. He is additionally a skilled inventor and torturer. In &quot;The New 52&quot;, DeSaad is given the additional abilities of telepathy and energy absorption.

<doc id="840894" wikidata="Q1040040" url="?curid=840894" title="Computation tree logic">
<text>Computation tree logic (CTL) is a branching-time logic, meaning that its model of time is a tree-like structure in which the future is not determined; there are different paths in the future, any one of which might be an actual path that is realized. It is used in formal verification of software or hardware artifacts, typically by software applications known as model checkers, which determine if a given artifact possesses safety or liveness properties. For example, CTL can specify that when some initial condition is satisfied (e.g., all program variables are positive or no cars on a highway straddle two lanes), then all possible executions of a program avoid some undesirable condition (e.g., dividing a number by zero or two cars colliding on a highway). In this example, the safety property could be verified by a model checker that explores all possible transitions out of program states satisfying the initial condition and ensures that all such executions satisfy the property. Computation tree logic belongs to a class of temporal logics that includes linear temporal logic (LTL). Although there are properties expressible only in CTL and properties expressible only in LTL, all properties expressible in either logic can also be expressed in CTL*.

== History ==
CTL was first proposed by Edmund M. Clarke and E. Allen Emerson in 1981, who used it to synthesize so-called &quot;synchronisation skeletons&quot;, &quot;i.e&quot; abstractions of concurrent programs.

Since the introduction of CTL, there has been debate about the relative merits of CTL and LTL. Because CTL is more computationally efficient to model check, it has become more common in industrial use, and many of the most successful model-checking tools use CTL as a specification language.

== Syntax of CTL ==
The language of well-formed formulas for CTL is generated by the following grammar:

:formula_1

where formula_2 ranges over a set of atomic formulas. It is not necessary to use all connectives – for example,
formula_3 comprises a complete set of connectives, and the others can be defined using them.

*formula_4 means &#x27;along All paths&#x27; &quot;(inevitably)&quot;
*formula_5 means &#x27;along at least (there Exists) one path&#x27; &quot;(possibly)&quot;

For example, the following is a well-formed CTL formula:

:formula_6

The following is not a well-formed CTL formula:

:formula_7

The problem with this string is that formula_8 can occur only when paired with an formula_9 or an formula_10. 

CTL uses atomic propositions as its building blocks to make statements about the states of a system. These propositions are then combined into formulas using logical operators and temporal operators.

==Operators==

===Logical operators===

The logical operators are the usual ones: ¬, ∨, ∧, ⇒ and ⇔. Along with these operators CTL formulas can also make use of the boolean constants true and false.

===Temporal operators===
The temporal operators are the following:
* Quantifiers over paths
**A Φ – All: Φ has to hold on all paths starting from the current state.
**E Φ – Exists: there exists at least one path starting from the current state where Φ holds.
* Path-specific quantifiers
**X &quot;φ&quot; – Next: &quot;φ&quot; has to hold at the next state (this operator is sometimes noted N instead of X).
**G &quot;φ&quot; – Globally: &quot;φ&quot; has to hold on the entire subsequent path.
**F &quot;φ&quot; – Finally: &quot;φ&quot; eventually has to hold (somewhere on the subsequent path).
**&quot;φ&quot; U &quot;ψ&quot; – Until: &quot;φ&quot; has to hold &quot;at least&quot; until at some position &quot;ψ&quot; holds. This implies that &quot;ψ&quot; will be verified in the future.
**&quot;φ&quot; W &quot;ψ&quot; – Weak until: &quot;φ&quot; has to hold until &quot;ψ&quot; holds. The difference with U is that there is no guarantee that &quot;ψ&quot; will ever be verified. The W operator is sometimes called &quot;unless&quot;.

In CTL*, the temporal operators can be freely mixed. In CTL, operators must always be grouped in pairs: one path operator followed by a state operator. See the examples below. CTL* is strictly more expressive than CTL.

===Minimal set of operators===
In CTL there are minimal sets of operators. All CTL formulas can be transformed to use only those operators. This is useful in model checking. One minimal set of operators is: {true, ∨, ¬, EG, EU, EX}.

Some of the transformations used for temporal operators are:
*EFφ&quot; == E[trueU(&quot;φ&quot;)] ( because Fφ&quot; == [trueU(&quot;φ&quot;)] )
*AX&quot;φ&quot; == ¬EX(¬&quot;φ&quot;)
*AG&quot;φ&quot; == ¬EF(¬&quot;φ&quot;) == ¬ E[trueU(¬&quot;φ&quot;)]
*AFφ&quot; == A[trueUφ&quot;] == ¬EG(¬&quot;φ&quot;)
*A[&quot;φUψ&quot;] == ¬( E[(¬&quot;ψ&quot;)U¬(&quot;φ&quot;∨&quot;ψ&quot;)] ∨ EG(¬&quot;ψ&quot;) )
==Semantics of CTL==

===Definition===
CTL formulae are interpreted over transition systems. A transition system is a triple formula_11, where formula_12 is a set of states, formula_13 is a transition relation, assumed to be serial, i.e. every state has at least one successor, and formula_14 is a labelling function, assigning propositional letters to states. Let formula_15 be such a transition model, with formula_16, and formula_17, where formula_18 is the set of well-formed formulas over the language of formula_19.

Then the relation of semantic entailment formula_20 is defined recursively on formula_21:
# formula_22
# formula_23
# formula_24
# formula_25
# formula_26
# formula_27
# formula_28
# formula_29
# formula_30
# formula_31
# formula_32
# formula_33
# formula_34
# formula_35
# formula_36

===Characterisation of CTL===
Rules 10–15 above refer to computation paths in models and are what ultimately characterise the &quot;Computation Tree&quot;;
they are assertions about the nature of the infinitely deep computation tree rooted at the given state formula_37.

===Semantic equivalences===
The formulae formula_21 and formula_39 are said to be semantically equivalent if any state in any model that satisfies one also satisfies the other.
This is denoted formula_40

It can be seen that formula_9 and formula_10 are duals, being universal and existential computation path quantifiers respectively:
formula_43.

Furthermore, so are formula_44 and formula_45.

Hence an instance of De Morgan&#x27;s laws can be formulated in CTL:
:formula_46
:formula_47
:formula_48

It can be shown using such identities that a subset of the CTL temporal connectives is adequate if it contains formula_49, at least one of formula_50 and at least one of formula_51 and the boolean connectives.

The important equivalences below are called the expansion laws; they allow unfolding the verification of a CTL connective towards its successors in time.
:formula_52
:formula_53
:formula_54
:formula_55
:formula_56
:formula_57

==Examples==
Let &quot;P&quot; mean &quot;I like chocolate&quot; and Q mean &quot;It&#x27;s warm outside.&quot;

*AG.P
:&quot;I will like chocolate from now on, no matter what happens.&quot;
*EF.P
:&quot;It&#x27;s possible I may like chocolate some day, at least for one day.&quot;
*AF.EG.P
:&quot;It&#x27;s always possible (AF) that I will suddenly start liking chocolate for the rest of time.&quot; (Note: not just the rest of my life, since my life is finite, while G is infinite).
*EG.AF.P
:&quot;Depending on what happens in the future (E), it&#x27;s possible that for the rest of time (G), I&#x27;ll be guaranteed at least one (AF) chocolate-liking day still ahead of me. However, if something ever goes wrong, then all bets are off and there&#x27;s no guarantee about whether I&#x27;ll ever like chocolate.&quot;

The two following examples show the difference between CTL and CTL*, as they allow for the until operator to not be qualified with any path operator (A or E):

*AG(PUQ)
:&quot;From now until it&#x27;s warm outside, I will like chocolate every single day. Once it&#x27;s warm outside, all bets are off as to whether I&#x27;ll like chocolate anymore. Oh, and it&#x27;s guaranteed to be warm outside eventually, even if only for a single day.&quot;
*EF((EX.P)U(AG.Q))
:&quot;It&#x27;s possible that: there will eventually come a time when it will be warm forever (AG.Q) and that before that time there will always be &quot;some&quot; way to get me to like chocolate the next day (EX.P).&quot;

==Relations with other logics==

Computation tree logic (CTL) is a subset of CTL* as well as of the modal μ calculus. CTL is also a fragment of Alur, Henzinger and Kupferman&#x27;s alternating-time temporal logic (ATL).
Computation tree logic (CTL) and linear temporal logic (LTL) are both a subset of CTL*. CTL and LTL are not equivalent and they have a common subset, which is a proper subset of both CTL and LTL.
*FG.P exists in LTL but not in CTL.
*AG(P⇒((EX.Q)∧(EX¬Q))) and AG.EF.P exist in CTL but not in LTL.

== Extensions ==
CTL has been extended with second-order quantification formula_58 and formula_59 to &quot;quantified computational tree logic&quot; (QCTL). There are two semantics:

* the tree semantics. We label nodes of the computation tree. QCTL* = QCTL = MSO over trees. Model checking and satisfiability are tower complete.
* the structure semantics. We label states. QCTL* = QCTL = MSO over graphs. Model checking is PSPACE-complete but satisfiability is undecidable.

A reduction from the model-checking problem of QCTL with the structure semantics, to TQBF (true quantified Boolean formulae) has been proposed, in order to take advantage of the QBF solvers.

<doc id="840895" wikidata="Q1411016" url="?curid=840895" title="Apokolips">
<text>Apokolips is a fictional planet that appears in American comic books published by DC Comics. The planet is ruled by Darkseid, established in Jack Kirby&#x27;s Fourth World series, and is integral to many stories in the DC Universe. Apokolips is considered the opposite of the planet New Genesis.

Apokolips is a large planet covered entirely by a city (an ecumenopolis). It is a notoriously dismal place, where Hunger Dogs (low-class citizens) labor to feed the pits that supply light and power to the world. Both Apokolips and New Genesis exist in a different plane of existence, located near the Source that originated the Old and New Gods.

Apokolips represents a dystopian society. As Jack Misselhorn writes: &quot;No one on Apokolips evolves spiritually because there is no love. It is a stagnant society, its inhabitants living in ignorance, the legacy of oppression&quot;.

Because it exists in another dimension outside of the multiverse, Apokolips is primarily accessed via Boom Tubes. It has been said that the New Gods are normally giants, and that travel through the Boom Tubes rescales them to mortal proportions.

==Fictional history==
Apokolips and its counterpart New Genesis were created after the destruction of Urgrund, the world of the &quot;Old Gods&quot; (implied to be the gods of Norse mythology). While New Genesis was given strength and nobility from the &quot;living atoms&quot; of the Old God Balduur, Apokolips was saturated with evil from an unnamed sorceress. The two planets are locked in an eternal war, symbolizing the struggle of evil and good on a grand mythic scale. Apokolips is ruled by a fell being known as Darkseid, a dark leader who rules over his downtrodden people by force and fear and killed his mother Heggra to obtain the throne.

===&quot;Seven Soldiers&quot;===

Both Apokolips and New Genesis were seemingly destroyed in a final battle prior to Grant Morrison&#x27;s miniseries &quot;Seven Soldiers: Mister Miracle&quot;. However, the final issue of that series implied that the story&#x27;s earlier events were merely visions seen by the hero as part of an elaborate test by the New God Metron. How much of the battle really happened and the current status of the New Gods remains to be seen.

===&quot;Countdown to Final Crisis&quot;===

Using Boom Tube technology, Brother Eye arrives on Apokolips and seemingly assimilates the entire planet. Before the assimilation is fully complete, the Pied Piper intervenes and channels the Anti-Life Equation through his flute. This destroys much of Brother Eye, causing it to flee and reverting much of Apokolips to normal.

===&quot;Death of the New Gods&quot;===

At the end of the &quot;Death of the New Gods&quot; miniseries, with all the gods now dead, the combined entity born from the melding of the Source and the Anti-Life Equation merges Apokolips and New Genesis into a single planet.

===&quot;The Great Darkness Saga&quot;===

In the 30th century, original &quot;Legion of Super-Heroes&quot; continuity, Apokolips is inactive and Darkseid is incapacitated. In the reboot &quot;Legion&quot; continuity, Darkseid was aged and dying, with the planet mostly uninhabited, but the center of a large cult.

===&quot;The New 52&quot;: Earth-0 and Earth-2===
In DC continuity following its 2011 &quot;Flashpoint&quot; event and the launch of its &quot;New 52&quot; line of comics, the DC Multiverse remains composed of 52 worlds, but only one set of New Gods. Darkseid and his army from Apokolips have attempted to invade Earth-0, or Prime Earth, but are repelled by the first incarnation of the Justice League. At the same time, his armies invaded the alternate Earth of Earth-2 under the aegis of Steppenwolf, which was much more successful.

The invasion of Earth-2 cost the lives of that universe&#x27;s original Superman, Batman, Catwoman, Wonder Woman and millions of humans, including Earth-2&#x27;s Lois Lane, who married Superman on that world. The Apokoliptan forces have assistance from Fury (Earth-2 Wonder Woman&#x27;s abducted and brainwashed daughter), with all her mother&#x27;s Amazonian abilities. Five years on, a number of new &quot;wonders&quot; begin to emerge: Green Lantern (Alan Scott), the Atom, Hawkgirl, Doctor Fate, the Red Tornado (an android with Lois Lane&#x27;s consciousness) and the Flash form an embryonic Justice Society. Before long, the armies of Apokolips attempt a second invasion of Earth 2, and the Wonders of the World are supported by further heroes including Batman (Thomas Wayne), a new Superman (Val-Zod), Huntress (Helena Wayne), Power Girl, Aquawoman (Marella), the Accountable (Jimmy Olsen), the New God Mister Miracle, and Earth 0&#x27;s Mister Terrific.

Agents of Darkseid, such as Glorious Godfrey and Kalibak (in &quot;Batman &amp; Robin&quot;) and the Apokoliptian Orion (in &quot;Wonder Woman&quot;), have encountered the heroes of Earth-0 on several occasions, but no full-scale invasions have taken place. Later, in the series &quot;Earth 2: Worlds&#x27; End&quot;, Mister Miracle discovers that Highfather made a deal with Darkseid that the armies of Apokolips could invade Earth-2 and that dimension freely without the intervention of the New Gods of New Genesis, explaining the wild disparity between the fates of Earth-0 and Earth-2. Ultimately, Apokolips itself enters Earth-2&#x27;s Solar System and consumes Earth-2, transforming the planet into fuel to sustain itself.

===&quot;DC Rebirth&quot;===
When Perpetua destroys the Source Wall, one of the side effects is that Apokolips simply vanishes. With Apokolips gone, Darkseid plans to use the Ghost Sector to create a New Apokolips which he will use to invade and conquer the Multiverse.

==Inhabitants==

The population is a downtrodden lot, including many kidnapped from other worlds before being &quot;broken&quot;. The majority of the population are called Lowlies or Hunger Dogs, a bald and fearful race that has no sense of self-worth or value, and yet, in their own way, are just as much gods as those who rule the planet. The Lowlies are subject to constant abuse that ends only with death. Next are the Parademons, who serve as the keepers of order on the planet and are created from other races who have been brainwashed or resurrected to serve Darkseid. Higher above the Parademons are the Female Furies, who are Darkseid&#x27;s personal guard. They are blessed with unnatural strength and longevity and are either trained for their position in the Furies from birth, or are promoted from the ranks of general Apokoliptian troops. The leaders of the Furies are Granny Goodness, who sports the appearance of a matronly old woman while being the most powerful of the guards, and Kanto, who enjoys a unique position as Darkseid&#x27;s master assassin. The chief guard, Big Barda, had a third position under Granny which has not been filled since her defection from the group. Deep below Armagetto, the lifeless forms of the Old Gods live on. They are known as the Dreggs.

Apokolips is ruled by Darkseid as its theocratic god/despot, but he delegates most of the actual day-to-day ruling to his counsellor DeSaad. Darkseid has no real contenders for the throne of Apokolips except Mantis, although his sons Orion, Grayven, and Kalibak are also potential contenders. Darkseid is cursed with Grayven and Kalibak&#x27;s stupidity and Orion&#x27;s service in the name of good. Orion once usurped the throne of Apokolips from his father temporarily, until coming to his senses and returning to New Genesis. It is prophesied that Orion will overthrow Darkseid. In &quot;Kingdom Come&quot;, it is revealed that Darkseid&#x27;s overthrow will not result in major changes on Apokolips, as Apokolips&#x27; evil comes from evil itself rather than from Darkseid.

==Geography==
There are different locations on Apokolips, a ecumenopolis (a world-city) with burning firepits, extant in between dimensions, occupying a ‘frequency’ somewhere between the physical universe and Hell:

* Armagedda - One of the many filth-strewn districts on Apokolips that is inhabited by Hunger Dogs and patrolled by Parademons.
* Armagetto - The planet&#x27;s one city and capital home to a dangerous ghetto outside of Darkseid&#x27;s palace.
* Darkseid&#x27;s Palace - This is where Darkseid lives.
* The Garden of Hope - The only beautiful place on Apokolips that has plants on it. It is here where the precognitive Pythia resides and guards Darkseid&#x27;s oracle. Darkseid tends to visit this area when he gets stressed out.
* Granny Goodness&#x27; Orphanage - This is a training facility where Granny Goodness trains the children of Apokolips to become mighty warriors. It is located in the Night-Time Zone of Armagetto.
* The Happiness Home - The Happiness Home is a rectangular fortress is built on a solid rock base in the centre of a shallow crater. It is over 200 feet high and a training school of sorts.
* The Necropolis - The Necropolis is an underground labyrinth located on Apokolips, home to the Dreggs, the last surviving Old Gods. The Dreggs survived the sundering of Urgrund, but were rendered mindless. Below the Necropolis are the Black Ways, a labyrinth which was the prison of Sirius, one of the last few surviving Old Gods, now trapped in the form of a large wolf. Sirius sacrificed himself to save Orion&#x27;s life, as seen in &quot;Orion&quot; #10 (March 2001). Powerful artifacts created by the Old Gods have been found in the Necropolis. A sword found in the ruins of Asgaard briefly gave John Hedley superhuman powers, which he used to challenge Orion in &quot;New Gods&quot; #16 (May 1990). In another expedition, Kalibak discovered the &quot;Thunderbelt&quot;, a device which increased his strength and durability (and which was a direct homage to Thor&#x27;s belt of strength). New Genesis also has ruined cities from the time of the Old Gods. Lonar found his mystical war horse Thunderer in one of these ruins. They met the Odin for some kind of business, such as a black lightning market that could be a source for Asgaardian people. 
* The Terrorium - 

==Technology==
Apokolips is on par with New Genesis in terms of technological advancement. With their technology, they are the height of power in most of the universe and are able to devastate galaxies when they choose to use it. Technology from Apokolips is sometimes on par with the technology used by Brainiac. Apokoliptian technology is furthermore the source of unparalleled misery in the universe, as the planet routinely arms evil groups with advanced technology to further its influence (and misery) across the universe. Apokoliptian technology was used by Bruno Mannheim and his organization Intergang in the &quot;Superman&quot; comics. It was a deal between Darkseid and Metron which was the cause of the invention of the &quot;Boom Tube&quot; using &quot;Element X&quot;, which could only be found on Apokolips. The &quot;Entropy Aegis&quot; armor, used by Steel to defeat Imperiex, was Apokoliptian technology, as was Dmitri Pushkin&#x27;s second suit of Rocket Red armor.

==Other versions==
===&quot;Darkseid/Galactus: The Hunger&quot;===
During an intercompany crossover, Galactus visited Apokolips, but was unable to feed on the planet, since all of the life force that had dwelled there had either left to New Genesis or had been burned in the fire pits long ago, in essence leaving the planet with no life force and making it too corrupt for him to feed on.

<text>Takion (Joshua Saunders) is a superhero appearing in American comic books published by DC Comics. The character was created by Paul Kupperberg and Aaron Lopresti, first appearing in an eponymous series in 1996 that lasted for 7 issues.

==Creation==
Kupperberg stated the genesis of the character stating,

&quot;Unbeknownst to me and Dan, over in editor Archie Goodwin’s office, a very different version of Starman was in development with writer James Robinson and artist Tony Harris. It only became beknownst when we fed our Starman proposal into the pipeline for review by the senior editors our Starman was bounced like a Spalding. Instead of just chalking it up to experience and sticking the proposal in a drawer, Dan suggested we salvage what we could from it and use that as a foundation to create an entirely new character. This we did and, after a bunch of talking and a few drafts, “Will Payton…Starman” became “Josh Saunders...Takion&quot;.

==Fictional character biography==

Josh Saunders is a blind psychologist who Highfather gave the ability to manipulate the Source and instructed him to cleanse it. Unbeknownst to Saunders, Highfather also intended him to act as an avatar to resurrect him in the event of his death. He also gains cosmic awareness, but struggles with it overwhelming his brain until he spends time in space to overcome this weakness.

===Stayne===
Takion&#x27;s main nemesis is Stayne, a human who was transformed by Darkseid and seeks to keep him from achieving his true potential.

===Highfather===
Takion later becomes the new Highfather after Izaya is killed by Ares during the &quot;Genesis&quot; event and Mister Miracle declines to replace him. However, Izaya survives as a spirit within the Source and possesses Takion to restore Supertown.

===Death===
During &quot;Death of the New Gods&quot;, Takion is killed by Infinity-Man after he and Himon attempt to investigate his murder of several New Gods.

==Powers and abilities==
As the embodiment of the Source, Takion possesses vast reality-manipulating abilities. He can manipulate energy, matter, and time; become intangible; and teleport.

== In other media ==
Takion appears as a character summon in &quot;Scribblenauts Unmasked: A DC Comics Adventure&quot;.

<text>OK-Junior is a kart racing class for top drivers aged 11 to 15 (drivers must reach the age of 12 within the first semester of calendar year).

This class used to be called Junior Intercontinental A (JICA or ICA-J) and has changed since January 2007 when CIK-FIA decided to replace the 100 cc air-cooled two-stroke engines with 125 cc Touch-and-Go (TaG) water-cooled two-stroke engines (KF type).The engines produce . The chassis and engines must be approved by the CIK-FIA. Minimum weight is 145 kg, including kart and driver.

Karts are equipped with an electric starter and clutch. The engine rpm is limited to 14,000 rpm.

It is one of the highest kart classes with national championships (perhaps with different tyre rules).

There is a European championship, a World Cup, as well as Oceania and Asia-Pacific championships. The Junior Monaco Kart Cup is taking place each year in this format.

For 2013 the class was renamed KF-Junior.

In 2016, the karts were completely re-designed by removing much of the electronics. The karts are now push started. The class was subsequently renamed OK-Junior, standing for Original Kart.

<text>William Dunn Moseley (February 1, 1795January 4, 1863) was an American politician. Born in North Carolina, Moseley became a Democratic politician and served in the state senate.

Later he moved to Florida, which became a state in 1845. That year he was elected as the first Governor of Florida, serving from 1845 until 1849.

==Early life and education==
William Dunn Moseley was born on February 1, 1795, at Moseley Hall in Lenoir County, North Carolina.

William was the son of Matthew and Elizabeth Herring Moseley, who built Moseley Hall. He and his father were distant descendants of William Moseley, the immigrant ancestor, a merchant who was a member of the Company of Merchant Adventurers of London, a trading guild. He had been trading in Rotterdam before he came to Virginia in 1649. He settled-in, in what was then Lower Norfolk County, and built &#x27;Greenwich&#x27; near Norfolk on the Elizabeth River. That plantation house was later known as Rolleston Hall; it was the last residence of Virginia Governor Henry A. Wise at the time of the Civil War.

Moseley graduated from the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill in 1818. He was of English ancestry on both sides, descended from ancestors in the original thirteen colonies. He received his master&#x27;s degree from UNC in 1821. While at the university, Moseley was the roommate of James K. Polk, a future president of the US.

==Marriage and family==
In 1822, Moseley married Susan Hill; the couple had six children. Susan Hill Moseley died in March 1842, after the Moseleys moved to Florida.

==Career==
In 1817, Moseley became a tutor at the university. After studying law, he was admitted to the bar and began practice in Wilmington. Like many lawyers of the time, law was not his only profession; Moseley also farmed and taught school.

From 1829 to 1837, Moseley represented Lenoir County in the North Carolina Senate, serving as speaker for four terms between 1832 and 1835. He lost the Democratic nomination for governor in North Carolina by three votes.

In 1835, Moseley and his family moved to Lake Miccosukee in Jefferson County, Florida, after purchasing a plantation there. In 1840, Moseley was elected to the territorial House of Representatives. In 1844, he won a seat in the territorial Senate. On March 3, 1845, Florida was admitted as the twenty-seventh state of the Union.

Later in 1845, in the first statewide election, Moseley won the election for Governor of Florida. He beat Richard Keith Call, who had been the governor of Florida Territory, and Moseley became the first governor of the state of Florida. Moseley was sworn in on June 25, 1845.

During his term, he established the new state government. The state Capitol building was completed during his first year in office. Moseley oversaw the state&#x27;s role in the Mexican–American War. Like other Southern states, Florida supported the war with troops. The planter class believed the war was an opportunity to gain territory where slavery could be extended.

Moseley worked to resolve conflicts between white settlers and the Seminole who remained in Florida, chiefly in the southern Everglades area. (Many Seminole had been removed to Indian Territory west of the Mississippi River after warfare with US forces.)

He encouraged development of agriculture, supporting new citrus, avocado, tobacco, and cotton industries. During his administration, the federal government built Fort Jefferson, on one of the coral keys off the southern Florida coast, and Fort Clinch on Amelia Island, near modern-day Fernandina Beach, Florida. These were defenses against European nations that still had colonies in the Caribbean and the Americas.

Moseley was a strong supporter of states&#x27; rights. Unusually for his time, he favored the establishment of state-funded public schools.

Constitutionally limited to a single term, Moseley returned to his plantation after ending his term on October 1, 1849. Two years later, he settled in the town of Palatka in Putnam County. There he operated a citrus grove. Moseley died on January 4, 1863, and was buried at the West View Cemetery in Palatka.

After his death, his daughters commissioned a portrait to be painted from a daguerreotype. They presented the portrait for display in a state portrait gallery at the Florida capitol.

<doc id="840927" wikidata="Q67139" url="?curid=840927" title="Johann Jakob Moser">
<text>Johann Jakob Moser (18 January 1701 – 30 September 1785) was a German jurist, publicist and researcher, whose work earned him the title &quot;The Father of German Constitutional Law&quot; and whose political commitment to the principles of Liberalism caused him to lose academic positions and spend years as a political prisoner. Moser was born and died in Stuttgart.

==Early life==
Johann Jacob Moser was a member of the Moser family of Filseck, an old and respectable Württemberg family. They were devout Protestants with a history of service as civil servants to the Duchy of Württemberg. Moser&#x27;s father, Johann Jacob Moser of Filseck, was born in 1660 in Stuttgart and died in 1716; his mother, Helene Catharine Moser (&quot;née&quot; Misler), was born in 1672 in Stade and died in 1741 in Stuttgart.

Although the younger Moser had six siblings, his parents managed to fund his pursuit of an academic career.

==Career==
After attending Eberhard-Ludwigs-Gymnasium, Moser studied state journalism at the University of Tübingen. His additional efforts at and success in independent learning enabled him to gain an appointment as professor of law at the same university at the early age of 18 or 19 years.

In 1721 Moser married Friederike Rosine Vischer, daughter of a Württembergian Upper Council President. Their oldest son, Friedrich Karl von Moser, was born on 18 December 1723 in Stuttgart, and became a jurist, political writer and a statesman.

From 1721 to 1726 he worked in Vienna. In 1724 he became an adviser to the state vice-chancellor Count Schönborn. Moser was not able to pursue a career in the imperial service, because he refused to convert to Catholicism. Soon afterwards he entered the civil service of the Holy Roman Empire, and was appointed as a &quot;state adviser&quot; in the Imperial Court. In 1726 Moser returned to Stuttgart as a government advisor. In 1727 he was appointed professor at the Tübingen Collegium. The work brought him into conflict with the government&#x27;s censors, and he quit both his job as professor and his job as government advisor in 1732. He later held a long series of administrative appointments, giving him a thorough knowledge of political and constitutional issues.

In 1736 he was called to head the Faculty of Law at the University of Frankfurt (Oder), but had to leave after three years due to his thoroughly Liberal ideas which were disliked by King Frederick William I of Prussia. Between 1739 and 1751, he had various jobs.

He spent the years 1739 to 1747 at Ebersdorf, mainly concerned with completing the monumental 53 volumes of his &quot;Deutsches Staatsrecht&quot; (&quot;German Constitutional Law&quot;), a pioneering research analysing the named subject matter more systematically than ever done before, and based on a through study of the sources.

In 1751 Moser became a consultant on land reform to the Charles Eugene, Duke of Württemberg. He came into conflict with the Duke by opposing the Duke&#x27;s absolutist tendencies. In July 1759 he was arrested and imprisoned without judicial procedure in solitary confinement in the fortress Hohentwiel, on the charge of authoring subversive writings. He completed his five-year detention with his mental and physical health and his faith in God unbroken. In order to meet his desire to write, without writing materials, he wrote religious songs on the walls with soot from the fireplace on the walls. In 1764, aged 63, he was released, in part due to the intercession of Friedrich the Great of Prussia, and was rehabilitated and restored to his position, rank and titles.

In 1764 he was released, due in part to the intercession of Friedrich the Great of Prussia (son of the king who had hounded Moser in 1739). He was rehabilitated and restored to his position, rank and titles. He retired on 16 July 1770 aged 69. During the next 15 years, he wrote many books. Over his entire life he wrote 500-600 books. This prolific output led sometimes to careless representations of the facts in his works.

==Legacy==
Johann Jacob Moser wrote the first description of the German state based not on abstract principles but on concrete legal rules and judicial decisions. He collected material and organised it systematically. Thus he argued against the deductive systems of natural law advocated by Christian Thomasius (1655-1728) and Christian Wolff (1679-1754). He gave the same treatment to international law, describing how it was actually practiced, rather than attempting to derive it from nature. Moser is considered as laying the foundations for the modern German state and positive international law. He defended the traditional order by defending actual legal rules.

Apart from his work on state law, he was also interested in the local law of the numerous territories of the state. However, because of their great variety, he was not able to describe them with the same comprehensiveness.

Among his important later works can be mentioned &quot;Neues deutsches Staatsrecht&quot;, (&quot;New German Constitutional Law&quot;), published in 24 volumes between 1766 and 1782. His overall ouvre includes about 500 works, on law as well as theology.

<text>The Female Furies are a group of women warriors and supervillains appearing in comics published by DC Comics. All of them are New Gods who serve Darkseid. They operate directly under Granny Goodness, who trains all of Darkseid&#x27;s soldiers.

==Publication history==
The Female Furies first appeared in &quot;Mister Miracle&quot; #6 (February 1972) and were created by Jack Kirby.

In November 2018, the Female Furies headlined their own six-issue miniseries by writer Cecil Castellucci and artist Adriana Melo.

==Fictional team history==
The Female Furies are New Gods fanatically loyal to Darkseid. They have been trained by Granny Goodness to serve as Apokolips&#x27;s elite strike force. Infighting among the Furies is commonplace, most typically to appoint a leader to the group.

After former leader Big Barda defected to Earth to be with her lover, Mister Miracle, Darkseid gave a kill order on the pair, prompting the rest of the Female Furies to strike. First, Mad Harriet and Stompa ambushed Barda but vanished after weakening her. Shortly after, Barda found and grabbed Lashina before she was able to attack, though Lashina escaped Barda&#x27;s grip. A fight quickly ensued, though Lashina teleported away when Barda managed to defeat her. After tracking down a Mother Box to Funky Flashman&#x27;s residence, the Furies, this time with Bernadeth, appeared. Realizing that they had been tricked, the Furies destroyed the house, though Funky Flashman managed to escape by throwing his assistant at the warriors. Having failed to kill either Barda or Mister Miracle, the Furies returned to Apokolips.

Later, Barda had traveled back to Apokolips and recruited dozens of Female Furies to help her rescue the captured Mister Miracle. Gilotina seduced and killed the guard, allowing the other Furies to storm Section Zero. Elsewhere, Lashina took the section director&#x27;s post to discover where Mister Miracle was held captive. The Furies ambushed Granny Goodness, who had been holding a viewing party for Mister Miracle&#x27;s trial by combat with a mysterious creature called the Lump. Bernadeth held the assassin Kanto at bay with her Fahren-knife, while an enraged Barda nearly killed Granny until she learned Mister Miracle had survived. Reunited, Barda and Mister Miracle, along with Bernadeth, Lashina, Stompa, and Mad Harriet, returned to Earth.

On Earth, the Furies had little time to relax as they were soon incapacitated by the World Protective League. When they awoke, they found themselves trapped in a cage behind thick glass. They easily escaped due to Mad Harriet&#x27;s claws and Stompa&#x27;s boots. They also freed Mike McCracken of the All-Nations Agency. They were soon ambushed by a security patrol, though the Furies easily disposed of them. The Furies helped to defeat the Head of the World Protective League, and Mike McCracken sabotaged the building so that it would blow up in four hours. After retrieving her mega-rod, Barda teleported the group to safety.

While on Earth, the Furies, without Mad Harriet, participated in Mister Miracle&#x27;s tricks, using their weapons to show great feats by the escape artist. They also joined in the battle against Doctor Bedlam and his animates. The group was next seen at the beach where they thrash some marines for interrupting their leisure swimming. Lashina and Stompa later helped Barda and Ted Brown clear up a new location for Mister Miracle&#x27;s act. Orion later mentioned that Lashina and the Furies had been called to join New Genesis in the war against Apokolips.

Under unknown circumstances, the Female Furies left Barda on Earth and returned to Apokolips where they were temporarily assigned to command a unit of automated battle machines as punishment for their defection. The Furies attempted to revolt, but they were subdued along with Granny Goodness by Apokoloptian soldiers with electric jolts.

The Female Furies eventually regained Darkseid&#x27;s trust, and he assigned them the task of retrieving Glorious Godfrey from Belle Reve Penitentiary. He appointed Lashina as new leader of the Furies, though DeSaad tried to convince the ruler to appoint his sister Bernadeth in the position. The Furies traveled to Earth and broke into the prison, battling various members of the Suicide Squad and easily capturing their target. As the Furies opened a Boom Tube to return to Apokolips, Bernadeth betrayed Lashina, leaving her for dead on Earth. Lashina briefly took the codename Duchess and joined the Suicide Squad until she was able to find a way to return to her planet.

Lashina recruited several members of the Squad into helping her return to Apokolips, and kidnapped several others (including Big Barda). When they arrived on Apokolips, the Suicide Squad battled through waves of Parademons. They were soon after confronted by the Female Furies and other members of Darkseid&#x27;s Elite. During the battle, Stompa battled Vixen but ended up getting defeated by Barda. Mad Harriet fought and defeated Shade, the Changing Man by using his own energies against him. Newcomer Artemiz and her Cyberpak battled Nightshade, though the Fury suffered defeat. Bernadeth waited until Lashina had exhausted herself battling others, then struck her with her dagger. However, Lashina eventually defeated Bernadeth and killed her by snapping her neck. Granny Goodness ended the battle and welcomed Lashina back to the Furies&#x27;s ranks. When asked what they should do with the remaining members of the Suicide Squad, Lashina replied: &quot;Let&#x27;s just kill them&quot;. Before they were able to finish off the Squad, the Forever People appeared with the Suicide Squad members that had remained on Earth. Their interference allowed Big Barda and the other captives to fight back, though the battle came to an end when Darkseid appeared. Enraged that Lashina had brought humans to Apokolips, he revived Bernadeth and used his Omega Beams to disintegrate Lashina. He then revived the fallen Suicide Squad members and allowed them to leave Apokolips.

Much later, Granny Goodness held a combat demonstration at her orphanage, displaying Bernadeth, Stompa, Mad Harriet, and Artemiz as they battled a group of Series-9 Drones. The demonstration was interrupted by Darkseid, who revealed Mister Miracle had returned to Apokolips, and he wanted the Furies to kill him. He revived Lashina, though as punishment he kept Bernadeth as leader. The Furies managed to quickly defeat Mister Miracle and deliver him to Darkseid&#x27;s throne room. After his comrades aided his escape, Mister Miracle defeated the Female Furies using his miracle mister soap.

A second wave of Female Furies, including long-time member Gilotina, Malice Vundabar, Bloody Mary, and Speed Queen, later appeared and went on a killing spree, but were stopped by Hawk and Dove.

The Furies made an appearance as antagonists in Grant Morrison&#x27;s acclaimed &quot;Seven Soldiers&quot; event, specifically in the &quot;Seven Soldiers: Mister Miracle&quot; mini-series. Here, they are all given human forms along with Darkseid and his other minions, with the Furies all becoming prostitutes with Granny Goodness acting as their pimp. They attempt to entice Shilo Norman, the second Mr. Miracle when he arrives at the Dark Side Club searching for Darkseid himself. They knock Shilo out, and then stuff him in the trunk of a car while he is bound and gagged, eventually torturing and setting him ablaze in a forest. This is later revealed to be an illusion caused by Darkseid&#x27;s Omega Sanction.

They are later shown aiding Granny in her scheme to overthrow the Greek Gods, kidnapping Helena Sandsmark to antagonize her daughter Wonder Girl during the events of her solo mini-series. After the deaths of Mister Miracle and Metron during &quot;Death of the New Gods&quot;, the Source stated Darkseid was the only remaining New God. The only Furies who were not visibly killed, currently, are Lashina, Stompa, Gilotina, Malice, Wunda, and Artemiz; although at the end of &quot;Death of the New Gods&quot; it is reiterated that all the New Gods are dead. While the New Gods were being killed off, Granny Goodness orchestrated the Amazon-American war to pose as Hippolyta to train women (such as Harley Quinn and Holly Robinson) under the auspices of becoming Amazon warriors into new Female Furies. This seems to conflict directly with &quot;Terror Titans&quot;, where Lashina (in her human form), is shown to be one of the villains running the Dark Side Club with the Clock King. She is last seen being electrocuted into unconsciousness by Static, who then presumably turns her over to the authorities with the rest of the upper level Dark Side Club players.

After the end of the Fourth World, in the &quot;Final Crisis&quot;, the corrupted Mary Marvel released the Anti-Life Equation and creates new Female Furies from Earth&#x27;s heroines and villainesses, including Wonder Woman, Catwoman, Giganta, and Batwoman.

===&quot;The New 52&quot;===
In 2011, &quot;The New 52&quot; rebooted the continuity of the DC universe and introduced a brand new Fury named Sweet Leilani. Granny Goodness sent Leilani to Earth to retrieve a Mother Box. She discovered that it was in the new O.M.A.C.&#x27;s possession. After a battle, Leilani was defeated and quickly retreated, vowing to return with the other Female Furies. Under unknown circumstances, Sweet Leilani left Darkseid&#x27;s employ along with teammates Enchanthrax, Killsandra, and Thumpa, and formed the Femmes Fatales. Together, they joined the Cult of Yuga Khan. The cult&#x27;s leader, Aagog, sent the Femmes Fatales to Earth to capture Beautiful Dreamer of the Forever People in hopes to resurrect Yuga Khan. After suffering defeat by the Forever People, the unconscious Femmes Fatales were gathered by Lashina and Granny, the latter of whom mentioned that a war was approaching and that &quot;all they need is the kind of love only Granny can give&quot;.

During the Darkseid War, Lashina and Kanto went to Earth in search of the amazon Myrina Black, who had given birth to Darkseid&#x27;s child, Grail. After Darkseid&#x27;s death, Lashina, Kanto, and Kalibak encountered Wonder Woman, Mr. Miracle, and several other heroes. The New Gods were close to defeating the heroes until Big Barda appeared, which drove the villains back. Barda proposed a peace treaty with Lashina, but Lashina refused, declaring that the Furies would never stop hunting her down.

Later, Barda returned to Apokolips and made a pact with the Furies: Barda would return to the group if they helped her defeat Grail and protect Mr. Miracle. While Grail and the newly revived, enslaved Darkseid were about to defeat Wonder Woman, Mr. Miracle, and the other heroes, Barda appeared through a boom tube alongside Lashina, Stompa, Bernadeth, Mad Harriet, Steppenwolf, Kalibak, and Kanto. Working together with the heroes, the Furies were able to defeat Grail and separate Darkseid from the Anti-Life Equation. In the ensuing explosion, Darkseid and Grail both vanish. Big Barda revealed the truth to Mr. Miracle and left with the other Furies back to Apokolips.

===&quot;DC Rebirth&quot;===
After the events of the &quot;Darkseid War&quot; storyline that led to &quot;DC Rebirth&quot;, Lex Luthor became ruler of Apokolips. Granny Goodness, along with the Furies, remained loyal to Darkseid, and awaited his return on the outskirts of Apokolips. A Mother Box later mysteriously teleported Lois Lane to Apokolips. Granny, along with Lashina, Stompa, and Mad Harriet, as well as several other unnamed Furies, took Lois captive. However, after being ambushed by a Dredge Worm, Lois managed to win over the Furies by aiding them in battle. Granny invited Lois to join the Furies and replace a fallen Fury. When a different Fury opposed Lois joining, Granny reminded her of Alianna Hubbard, the first human to join their ranks. Later, Granny offered Lois Lane some cooked meat and reminded her that the Furies are family.

Granny Goodness and the Furies, with Lois, then made their way for the main citadel of Apokolips. Along the way, they discovered Kalibak, who had captured Superman and Lex Luthor. When Granny scolded Kalibak, he attacked, and a battle between the Furies and Kalibak&#x27;s forces ensued. During the battle, Lois Lane rescued Superman, who attacked Kalibak. Before he could be defeated, Kalibak used his machine to absorb the fires from Apokolips. This severely weakened Superman, though the battle escalated when Superman&#x27;s son rode in on the Hunger Dogs of Apokolips.

As the battle raged on, Lashina and Mad Harriet attacked Superman while Granny fought Kalibak. When Lois Lane jumped to Superman&#x27;s defense, the Furies turned on her, claiming that by caring for a man she was belittling the progress that the Furies had made. Lois managed to defeat the Furies with her spear. Later, Lashina, Stompa, and Harriet were seen dressed in rags in a prison cell after Superman took leadership of Apokolips.

Later, Darkseid freed the Female Furies under unknown circumstances. He sent the Furies, now with Bernadeth and Gilotina, to Turkey in search of his missing artifacts. This led to a confrontation with Wonder Woman&#x27;s lover Steve Trevor and his team, the Oddfellows.

The Oddfellows somehow managed to defeat the Furies, capturing both Lashina and Mad Harriet. Bernadeth, Stompa, and Gilotina reported back to Darkseid without the relics. Furious, Darkseid threatened to kill the trio, though he explained he still had use for them. Lashina and Harriet refused to answer Wonder Woman&#x27;s questioning about Darkseid&#x27;s plans which led to Wonder Woman freeing the two Furies and attempting to battle them for answers. The battle was interrupted by Darkseid, who had transported a chunk of the A.R.G.U.S. headquarters to his lair in the Amazon jungle. In the ensuing chaos, the Female Furies battled the soldiers of A.R.G.U.S. and later fled when Darkseid was apparently killed by Wonder Woman.

Later, the Furies attended the birth of Mister Miracle&#x27;s and Big Barda&#x27;s child Jacob. Bernadeth allowed Mister Miracle to borrow her Fahren-Knife to cut the newborn free from Barda&#x27;s indestructible umbilical cord. Months later, Bernadeth attended the conference to discuss peace between Apokolips and New Genesis.

At some point, Granny Goodness had taken interest in Harley Quinn. While Quinn was on vacation, Granny sent Lashina and Bernadeth to recruit the anti-heroine into the Female Furies. She later assigned her to capture the escaped prisoner and former Fury, Petite Tina. Harley Quinn eventually failed as a Female Fury, and she and Tina were captured and tortured by Bernadeth. Harley was immune to Bernadeth&#x27;s mind-wiping machine, and she and Petite Tina escaped Apokolips to return to Earth.

<text>Brush Motor Car Company (1907-1909), later the Brush Runabout Company (1909-1913), was based in Highland Park, Michigan.

==History==

The company was founded by Alanson Partridge Brush (February 10, 1878, Michigan – March 6, 1952, Michigan). He was a self-taught prolific designer, working with Henry Leland at Oldsmobile, and went on to help design the original one-cylinder Cadillac engine. Although there were many makes of small runabouts of similar size and one to four cylinders at this time (before the Model T Ford dominated the low-price market), the Brush has many unusual design details showing the inventiveness of its creator. The Brush Runabout Company, along with Maxwell-Briscoe, Stoddard-Dayton, and others formed Benjamin Briscoe&#x27;s United States Motor Company(USMC) from 1910, ending when that company failed in 1913. Runabouts, in general, fell out of vogue quickly, partly due to the lack of protection from the weather.

After Brush and the other companies of the USMC folded into Maxwell Motor Company, President Walter Flanders wrote in 1913 document &quot;Why We Did Not Use All Our Plants&quot;, the Brush factory in Detroit (along with the Flanders and Sampson Plants) were to remain open and running as factories. The modern successor is Stellantis North America/Chrysler.

==Design==

===Brush===

Touted as the &quot;Everyman&#x27;s Car&quot;, Brush designed a light car with a wooden chassis (wooden rails and iron cross-members), friction drive transmission and &quot;underslung&quot; coil springs in tension instead of compression on both sides of each axle. Two gas-powered headlamps provided light, along with a gas-powered light in the rear. The frame, axles, and wheels were made of oak, hickory or maple, and were either left plain or painted to match the trim. Wider axles were available for use in the Southern region of the United States, where a 60-inch tread fit wagon ruts on country roads. The horn was located next to the engine cover, with a metal tube running to a squeeze bulb affixed near the driver. A small storage area was provided in the rear, with a drawer accessible under the rear of the seat.

The engines were a single-cylinder, four-stroke water cooled design, producing 6BHP, with power going to a chain-driven rear axle. Lacking a differential drive, the rear-axle disengaged one of the rear wheels while driving around a curve to avoid undue wear and tear on the drivetrain. A feature of engines designed by Brush was that they ran counter-clockwise instead of the usual clockwise. This was Brush&#x27;s idea intended to make them safer for a right-handed person to crank-start by hand. Prior to the invention of the electric starter, crank-starting a clockwise-running engines frequently resulted in dislocated thumbs and broken forearms if the hand crank kicked back on starting.

According to a contemporary review from &quot;Cycle and Automobile Trade Journal&quot; in 1907, author Hugh Dolnar described the recently introduced Brush as a &quot;...very, very new and also very, very old, as will be seen from the detailed construction illustrations below...&quot; In his critique of the Brush, Dolnar was referencing the decision to use wooden axles.

In addition to the Runabout, Brush advertised a $600 &quot;Package Car&quot; (also advertised as the &quot;Delivery Car&quot;) based on the same chassis as the runabout. Also offered was a &quot;Coupe&quot; model for $850. It is unknown how many (if any at all) of these models were ever produced or sold by Brush.

===Liberty-Brush===

In order to increase sales, Brush introduced a lower priced version of the car. Sold between 1911 and 1912, the Liberty-Brush was a simplified version of the standard Runabout offered at a lower price. The most distinguishing feature between the two models were the fenders: the Brush had sweeping front and rear fenders that connected at the midpoint of the car in a short running board, whereas the Liberty-Brush had four bicycle type fenders over only the wheels. While the standard Brush sold in the $450 - $850 range, the Liberty-Brush was extensively advertised at a $350 price.

==Feats of Endurance==
Pikes Peak
In 1908, Fred and Florence Trinkle took their 7BHP Brush Runabout. It was the third car to make it to the top of Pikes Peak under its own power. The trip to the top of Pikes Peak was part of the Trinkle&#x27;s &quot;Across America&quot; trip, covering 2,340 miles.

Glidden Tour
In 1909, two Brush Runabouts participated in the Glidden Tour. Neither Brush successfully completed the tour.

Abernathy Boys
In 1910, Jack Abernathy and his two boys, Bud and Temple rode their horses to see former President Theodore Roosevelt at a celebration. The two boys convinced Jack to return to Oklahoma via automobile, and the trio purchased a 1910 Brush Runabout for the trip. Their return trip included stops in Albany, NY, Niagara Falls, Detroit (and a stop at the Brush Factory for a tune-up), Chicago and Omaha. Brush used the &quot;Little Cowboys from Oklahoma&quot; in their advertisements.

Trans-Australian Trip
In 1912, Sid Ferguson, Francis Birtles and a dog named Rex drove a Brush Runabout across the Australian continent. The pair started out on the west coast in Freemantle and ending on the east coast in Sydney, with the trip occurring between March and April of that year. Ferguson and Birtles became the first persons to successfully undertake such a trip.

<text>George Higgins Moses (February 9, 1869December 20, 1944) was a U.S. diplomat and political figure. He served as a United States senator from New Hampshire and was chosen as the Senate&#x27;s President pro tempore.

==Biography==
George H. Moses was born in Lubec, Maine on February 9, 1869. He was raised in Eastport, Maine, and Franklin, New Hampshire, and graduated from Phillips Exeter Academy in 1887. He graduated from Dartmouth College in 1890, and was a member of the Psi Upsilon fraternity. In 1893 he received a Master of Arts degree from Dartmouth.

After graduating, though he considered a job teaching Latin and Greek, he instead joined the &quot;Concord Monitor&quot;, and became a newspaper editor.

He was private secretary to Governor David H. Goodell from 1889 to 1891. Moses then went into journalism, working as a reporter, news editor, and chief editor for the &quot;Concord Evening Monitor&quot; from 1892 to 1918. Moses was a member of the New Hampshire Forestry Commission from 1893 to 1907, and served as the commission&#x27;s secretary. Moses was a delegate to the 1908 Republican National Convention.

In 1909 Moses was appointed by President William Howard Taft to be the United States Minister to Greece and Montenegro, and he served until 1912. The appointment was a surprise to Moses, who had opposed Taft&#x27;s nomination for President at the 1908 convention. Moses was also a delegate to the 1916 Republican National Convention.

==United States Senator==
In 1918 Moses was elected to the United States Senate from New Hampshire from 1918. He served until 1933 and was President pro tempore from 1925 to 1933. During his Senate service Moses was chairman of: the Committee on Printing (Sixty-sixth through Sixty-eighth Congresses); Committee on Post Office and Post Roads (Sixty-ninth and Seventieth Congresses); and Committee on Rules (Seventy-first and Seventy-second Congresses).

Moses won narrowly in his 1918 special election to complete the term of Jacob H. Gallinger, and he was handily reelected in 1920 and 1926. He ran unsuccessfully for reelection in 1932, losing narrowly to the Democrat nominee and Former Governor Fred H. Brown in the Democratic landslide that also saw Franklin D. Roosevelt nationally defeat Herbert Hoover in that year&#x27;s presidential election. He was a delegate to the 1936 Republican National Convention.

==Later life==
Moses died in Concord, New Hampshire on December 20, 1944. He was buried at Franklin Cemetery in Franklin, New Hampshire.

<doc id="840946" wikidata="Q2157626" url="?curid=840946" title="Robert Hughes, Baron Hughes of Woodside">
<text>Robert Hughes, Baron Hughes of Woodside (3 January 1932 – 7 January 2022) was a British Labour Party politician and life peer who served as a Member of Parliament (MP) for 27 years, and was also Chair of the British Anti-Apartheid Movement (AAM) from 1976 until it was dissolved in 1995 after the ending of apartheid in South Africa.

==Political career==
Hughes first stood for Parliament in 1959 at North Angus and Mearns, where he came second to the Conservative incumbent Colin Thornton-Kemsley. He was the Member of Parliament (MP) for Aberdeen North from 1970 to 1997.

Hughes was Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Scotland from March 1974 until July 1975, when he resigned in disagreement with the government&#x27;s incomes policy.

The 1979 vote of no confidence resulted from the Labour government overturning the &quot;Yes&quot; result of the Scottish devolution referendum. Rather than the SNP, prime minister James Callaghan blamed unionist rebels on his own benches for ultimately bringing about the collapse of his government and opening the door to victory for Margaret Thatcher&#x27;s Conservatives. Hughes was one of those rebels. Tam Dalyell, Peter Doig, and Adam Hunter were the other Scottish Labour MPs who helped overturn the &quot;Yes&quot; vote.

In November 1985 Hughes was appointed to the Shadow Cabinet as Shadow Secretary of State for Transport. On 27 September 1997, he was created a life peer as Baron Hughes of Woodside, of Woodside in the City of Aberdeen.

===Anti-Apartheid Movement===
Under his chairmanship the Anti-Apartheid Movement campaigned against the Thatcher government&#x27;s refusal to impose sanctions against South Africa in the 1980s and organised the 1988 &quot;Free Mandela&quot; concert at Wembley Stadium which was televised by the BBC and broadcast around the world. Hughes attended the independence celebrations in Namibia in 1990 and acted as an observer at South Africa&#x27;s first democratic elections in April 1994. After the dissolution of the AAM he became the first Chairperson of its successor organisation, .

==Personal life and death==
Hughes was born on 3 January 1932, and educated at Robert Gordon&#x27;s College, Aberdeen, and in South Africa, where he lived from 1947 until 1954 and worked as a draughtsman.

He was a patron of Humanists UK.

He died on 7 January 2022, four days after his 90th birthday, after a long illness. Tony Blair, Anas Sarwar and Peter Hain paid tribute to him, with Blair saying, &quot;He was a lovely, kind and exceptional man and embodied all that is best in public service.&quot;

<doc id="840950" wikidata="Q1780005" url="?curid=840950" title="Comma category">
<text>In mathematics, a comma category (a special case being a slice category) is a construction in category theory. It provides another way of looking at morphisms: instead of simply relating objects of a category to one another, morphisms become objects in their own right. This notion was introduced in 1963 by F. W. Lawvere (Lawvere, 1963 p. 36), although the technique did not become generally known until many years later. Several mathematical concepts can be treated as comma categories. Comma categories also guarantee the existence of some limits and colimits. The name comes from the notation originally used by Lawvere, which involved the comma punctuation mark. The name persists even though standard notation has changed, since the use of a comma as an operator is potentially confusing, and even Lawvere dislikes the uninformative term &quot;comma category&quot; (Lawvere, 1963 p. 13).

==Definition==
The most general comma category construction involves two functors with the same codomain. Often one of these will have domain 1 (the one-object one-morphism category). Some accounts of category theory consider only these special cases, but the term comma category is actually much more general.

===General form===
Suppose that formula_1, formula_2, and formula_3 are categories, and formula_4 and formula_5 (for source and target) are functors:

formula_6
We can form the comma category formula_7 as follows:
*The objects are all triples formula_8 with formula_9 an object in formula_1, formula_11 an object in formula_2, and formula_13 a morphism in formula_3.
*The morphisms from formula_8 to formula_16 are all pairs formula_17 where formula_18 and formula_19 are morphisms in formula_20 and formula_21 respectively, such that the following diagram commutes:

Morphisms are composed by taking formula_22 to be formula_23, whenever the latter expression is defined. The identity morphism on an object formula_8 is formula_25.

===Slice category===

The first special case occurs when formula_26, the functor formula_4 is the identity functor, and formula_28 (the category with one object formula_29 and one morphism). Then formula_30 for some object formula_31 in formula_1.

formula_33
In this case, the comma category is written formula_34, and is often called the &quot;slice category&quot; over formula_31 or the category of &quot;objects over formula_31&quot;. The objects formula_37 can be simplified to pairs formula_38, where formula_39. Sometimes, formula_40 is denoted by formula_41. A morphism formula_42 from formula_43 to formula_44 in the slice category can then be simplified to an arrow formula_18 making the following diagram commute:

===Coslice category===

The dual concept to a slice category is a coslice category. Here, formula_46, formula_4 has domain formula_48 and formula_5 is an identity functor.

formula_50
In this case, the comma category is often written formula_51, where formula_52 is the object of formula_2 selected by formula_4. It is called the &quot;coslice category&quot; with respect to formula_55, or the category of &quot;objects under formula_55&quot;. The objects are pairs formula_57 with formula_58. Given formula_57 and formula_60, a morphism in the coslice category is a map formula_19 making the following diagram commute:

===Arrow category===
formula_4 and formula_5 are identity functors on formula_3 (so formula_65).

formula_66
In this case, the comma category is the arrow category formula_67. Its objects are the morphisms of formula_3, and its morphisms are commuting squares in formula_3.

===Other variations===
In the case of the slice or coslice category, the identity functor may be replaced with some other functor; this yields a family of categories particularly useful in the study of adjoint functors. For example, if formula_5 is the forgetful functor mapping an abelian group to its underlying set, and formula_71 is some fixed set (regarded as a functor from 1), then the comma category formula_72 has objects that are maps from formula_71 to a set underlying a group. This relates to the left adjoint of formula_5, which is the functor that maps a set to the free abelian group having that set as its basis. In particular, the initial object of formula_72 is the canonical injection formula_76, where formula_77 is the free group generated by formula_71.

An object of formula_72 is called a &quot;morphism from formula_71 to formula_5&quot; or a &quot;formula_5-structured arrow with domain formula_71&quot;. An object of formula_84 is called a &quot;morphism from formula_4 to formula_86&quot; or a &quot;formula_4-costructured arrow with codomain formula_86&quot;.

Another special case occurs when both formula_4 and formula_5 are functors with domain formula_48. If formula_92 and formula_93, then the comma category formula_7, written formula_95, is the discrete category whose objects are morphisms from formula_9 to formula_11.

An inserter category is a (non-full) subcategory of the comma category where formula_98 and formula_99 are required. The comma category can also be seen as the inserter of formula_100 and formula_101, where formula_102 and formula_103 are the two projection functors out of the product category formula_104.

==Properties==
For each comma category there are forgetful functors from it.
* Domain functor, formula_105, which maps:
** objects: formula_106;
** morphisms: formula_107;
* Codomain functor, formula_108, which maps:
** objects: formula_109;
** morphisms: formula_110.
* Arrow functor, formula_111, which maps:
** objects: formula_112;
** morphisms: formula_113;

==Examples of use==

===Some notable categories===
Several interesting categories have a natural definition in terms of comma categories.
* The category of pointed sets is a comma category, formula_114 with formula_115 being (a functor selecting) any singleton set, and formula_116 (the identity functor of) the category of sets. Each object of this category is a set, together with a function selecting some element of the set: the &quot;basepoint&quot;. Morphisms are functions on sets which map basepoints to basepoints. In a similar fashion one can form the category of pointed spaces formula_117.
*The category of associative algebras over a ring formula_118 is the coslice category formula_119, since any ring homomorphism formula_120 induces an associative formula_118-algebra structure on formula_4, and vice versa. Morphisms are then maps formula_123 that make the diagram commute.
* The category of graphs is formula_124, with formula_125 the functor taking a set formula_71 to formula_127. The objects formula_128 then consist of two sets and a function; formula_129 is an indexing set, formula_130 is a set of nodes, and formula_131 chooses pairs of elements of formula_130 for each input from formula_129. That is, formula_134 picks out certain edges from the set formula_135 of possible edges. A morphism in this category is made up of two functions, one on the indexing set and one on the node set. They must &quot;agree&quot; according to the general definition above, meaning that formula_136 must satisfy formula_137. In other words, the edge corresponding to a certain element of the indexing set, when translated, must be the same as the edge for the translated index.
* Many &quot;augmentation&quot; or &quot;labelling&quot; operations can be expressed in terms of comma categories. Let formula_4 be the functor taking each graph to the set of its edges, and let formula_9 be (a functor selecting) some particular set: then formula_140 is the category of graphs whose edges are labelled by elements of formula_9. This form of comma category is often called &quot;objects formula_4-over formula_9&quot; - closely related to the &quot;objects over formula_9&quot; discussed above. Here, each object takes the form formula_145, where formula_11 is a graph and formula_147 a function from the edges of formula_11 to formula_9. The nodes of the graph could be labelled in essentially the same way.
* A category is said to be &quot;locally cartesian closed&quot; if every slice of it is cartesian closed (see above for the notion of &quot;slice&quot;). Locally cartesian closed categories are the classifying categories of dependent type theories.

===Limits and universal morphisms===

Limits and colimits in comma categories may be &quot;inherited&quot;. If formula_1 and formula_2 are complete, formula_152 is a continuous functor, and formula_153 is another functor (not necessarily continuous), then the comma category formula_7 produced is complete, and the projection functors formula_155 and formula_156 are continuous. Similarly, if formula_1 and formula_2 are cocomplete, and formula_159 is cocontinuous, then formula_7 is cocomplete, and the projection functors are cocontinuous.

For example, note that in the above construction of the category of graphs as a comma category, the category of sets is complete and cocomplete, and the identity functor is continuous and cocontinuous. Thus, the category of graphs is complete and cocomplete.

The notion of a universal morphism to a particular colimit, or from a limit, can be expressed in terms of a comma category. Essentially, we create a category whose objects are cones, and where the limiting cone is a terminal object; then, each universal morphism for the limit is just the morphism to the terminal object. This works in the dual case, with a category of cocones having an initial object. For example, let formula_3 be a category with formula_162 the functor taking each object formula_163 to formula_164 and each arrow formula_134 to formula_166. A universal morphism from formula_167 to formula_168 consists, by definition, of an object formula_164 and morphism formula_170 with the universal property that for any morphism formula_171 there is a unique morphism formula_172 with formula_173. In other words, it is an object in the comma category formula_174 having a morphism to any other object in that category; it is initial. This serves to define the coproduct in formula_3, when it exists.

===Adjunctions===
William Lawvere showed that the functors formula_176 and formula_177 are adjoint if and only if the comma categories formula_178 and formula_179, with formula_180 and formula_181 the identity functors on formula_182 and formula_3 respectively, are isomorphic, and equivalent elements in the comma category can be projected onto the same element of formula_184. This allows adjunctions to be described without involving sets, and was in fact the original motivation for introducing comma categories.

===Natural transformations===
If the domains of formula_185 are equal, then the diagram which defines morphisms in formula_186 with formula_187 is identical to the diagram which defines a natural transformation formula_188. The difference between the two notions is that a natural transformation is a particular collection of morphisms of type of the form formula_189, while objects of the comma category contains &quot;all&quot; morphisms of type of such form. A functor to the comma category selects that particular collection of morphisms. This is described succinctly by an observation by S.A. Huq
that a natural transformation formula_190, with formula_191, corresponds to a functor formula_192 which maps each object formula_9 to formula_194 and maps each morphism formula_195 to formula_17. This is a bijective correspondence between natural transformations formula_188 and functors formula_192 which are sections of both forgetful functors from formula_186.

<text>Grove Karl Gilbert (May 6, 1843 – May 1, 1918), known by the abbreviated name G. K. Gilbert in academic literature, was an American geologist.

==Biography==
Gilbert was born in Rochester, New York, and graduated from the University of Rochester. During the American Civil War, he was twice listed for the draft, but his name was drawn neither time. In 1871, he joined George M. Wheeler&#x27;s geographical survey as its first geologist.

===Rockies geologist===
Gilbert joined the Powell Survey of the Rocky Mountain Region in 1874, becoming Powell&#x27;s primary assistant, and stayed with the survey until 1879. During this time he published an important monograph, &quot;The Geology of the Henry Mountains&quot; (1877). After the U.S. Geological Survey was created in 1879, he was appointed to the position of Senior Geologist and worked for the USGS until his death (including a term as acting director).

Gilbert published a study of the former ancient Lake Bonneville in 1890 (the lake existed during the Pleistocene), of which the Great Salt Lake is a remnant. He named it after the army captain Benjamin Bonneville, who had explored the region. The type of river delta that Gilbert described at this location has since become known to geomorphologists as a Gilbert delta.

===Meteor crater===
In 1891, Gilbert examined the origins of a crater in Arizona, now known as Meteor Crater but then as Coon Butte. For several reasons, and against his intuition, he concluded it was the result of a volcanic steam explosion rather than an impact of a meteorite. Gilbert based his conclusion on the beliefs that the volume of an impact crater including the meteorite should be more than the ejected material on the rim and that, if it was a meteorite, iron should create magnetic anomalies. Gilbert&#x27;s calculations showed that the crater&#x27;s volume and the debris on the rim were roughly equal, and that there were no magnetic anomalies. He argued that the meteorite fragments found on the rim were just &quot;coincidence&quot;. In 1892, Gilbert delivered his paper &quot;The Moon&#x27;s Face; A Study of the Origin of Its Features&quot; as his retiring President&#x27;s lecture to the Philosophical Society of Washington, and it was published in the Society&#x27;s bulletin. He publicized these conclusions in a series of lectures in 1895. Later investigations revealed that it was in fact a meteor crater, but that interpretation was not well established until the mid-20th century. As part of his interest in crater origins, Gilbert also studied the moon&#x27;s craters and concluded they were caused by impact events rather than volcanoes, although he wondered why the craters were round and not oval as expected for an oblique impact. The interpretation of lunar craters as of impact origin was also debated until the mid-20th century.

==Geomorphology==
Gilbert joined the Harriman Alaska Expedition in 1899. Two weeks after the 1906 San Francisco earthquake, he took a series of photographs documenting the damage along the San Andreas fault from Inverness to Bolinas.

Gilbert is considered one of the giants of the subdiscipline of geomorphology, having contributed to the understanding of landscape evolution, erosion, river incision, and sedimentation. He was a planetary science pioneer, correctly identifying lunar craters as caused by impacts, and carrying out early impact-cratering experiments. He coined the term &quot;sculpture&quot; for a pattern of radial ridges surrounding Mare Imbrium on the moon, and correctly interpreted them in 1892 as ejecta from a giant impact. Gilbert was one of the more influential early American geologists.

==Awards==
He won the Wollaston Medal from the Geological Society of London in 1900. He was elected as a member to the American Philosophical Society in 1902. He was awarded the Charles P. Daly Medal by the American Geographical Society in 1910. Gilbert was well-esteemed by all American geologists during his lifetime, and he is the only geologist to ever be elected twice as President of the Geological Society of America (1892 and 1909). Because of Gilbert&#x27;s prescient insights into planetary geology, the Geological Society of America created the G.K. Gilbert Award for planetary geology in 1983. Gilbert&#x27;s wide-ranging scientific ideas were so profound that the Geological Society of America published GSA Special Paper 183 on his research (Yochelson, E.L., editor, 1980, The Scientific Ideas of G.K. Gilbert, fourteen separate biographical chapters, 148 pages).

Craters on the moon and on Mars are named in his honor, as is Mount Gilbert in Alaska, a second Mount Gilbert in California, and Gilbert Peak in the Uinta Mountains of Utah.

<doc id="840970" wikidata="Q465095" url="?curid=840970" title="Colin Hendry">
<text>Edward Colin James Hendry (born 7 December 1965) is a Scottish football coach and former professional footballer.

Hendry, who played as a defender, notably played in the Premier League for Blackburn Rovers, with whom he was part of the title-winning side of 1995. He also played top flight football in both England and Scotland for Dundee, Manchester City, Rangers, Coventry City and Bolton Wanderers, as well as stints in the Football League with Preston North End and Blackpool. He earned 51 caps for Scotland, scoring three times, and was part of the Tartan Army&#x27;s Euro 96 and World Cup 98 squads.

Following on from retirement, Hendry took over as Blackpool manager and later had a spell in charge of Clyde. He later returned to Blackburn as part of their coaching staff, having previously had a spell as assistant manager of Boston United.

==Playing career==
===Club===
Hendry first played for his local semi-professional club, Highland League outfit Keith, and Islavale, a North Scottish Junior club. He began his full-time professional career in 1983 with Dundee. During his early career, Hendry played mainly as a striker. In 1987 he was transferred to Blackburn Rovers, where he was converted into a defender. One of his first appearances came in the Full Members Cup final, where he scored the only goal in the 1–0 Wembley win over Charlton Athletic.

He played over 100 games for Blackburn before joining Manchester City in 1989, where he was named Player of the Year in the 1989–90 season. His days at City were numbered, however, after he fell out of manager Peter Reid&#x27;s plans when Reid took over in November 1990 on the departure of Howard Kendall to Everton.

He was re-signed for Blackburn by Kenny Dalglish in November 1991 for a fee of £700,000 and helped them to great success including promotion from the Second Division and winning the FA Premier League. In 1998, he got a move back to Scotland to play with Rangers where he was signed by manager Dick Advocaat for £4 million. However, despite winning the domestic treble in his first season, his time there was relatively unhappy with Advocaat claiming that Hendry was &quot;not his type of player&quot;. After his spell at Rangers, Hendry moved back to the Premier League to Coventry City who paid £750,000 for him in February 2000. Hendry had a difficult spell for the Sky Blues with his appearances being limited, he was loaned to then First Division side Bolton Wanderers. He impressed manager Sam Allardyce who made the move permanent in February 2001, with Bolton agreeing to pay a fee of £500,000 should they gain promotion at the end of that season, which they subsequently did. He later moved to Preston North End on loan and finally Blackpool, initially a loan before being made permanent, before retiring from playing football. Overall, Hendry played more than 500 league games and scored more than 40 goals in a playing career spanning 20 years.

In November 2018, Hendry played a league game for Blackburn Sunday League side Moorgate F.C.

===International===
Hendry managed to win 51 caps for Scotland despite the fact that he was a latecomer to the international scene, not making his debut until he was 27. He captained Scotland in the 1998 World Cup. His last Scotland appearance, on 28 March 2001, saw Hendry score two goals in a 4–0 win over San Marino. His international career was ended as he was subsequently banned for six matches for elbowing San Marino substitute Nicola Albani later in that game.

== Coaching career ==

Hendry landed his first managerial job in June 2004 when he was appointed manager of his former club Blackpool replacing Steve McMahon. He was dismissed by the club on 29 November 2005 following a poor run of results.

On 9 September 2006 Hendry joined Boston United as assistant manager to Steve Evans. 

On 11 June 2007 he became manager of Scottish First Division side Clyde. Hendry lost his first three games in charge. He picked up his first victory in a Scottish Challenge Cup tie against fellow First Division side Queen of the South in August 2007. His best run was a six-game undefeated streak from November 2007 to December 2007. His final game in charge of Clyde was a Scottish Cup fourth-round match, which Clyde lost 1–0 to Dundee United. Hendry resigned as manager of Clyde on 18 January 2008.

In June 2012, Hendry re-joined Blackburn Rovers, initially as first-team coach, working under manager and fellow Scot Steve Kean. He later became assistant manager of the club&#x27;s under-21 team. On 12 June 2014, Hendry left Rovers.

== Personal life ==

Hendry&#x27;s wife, Denise, died on 10 July 2009, aged 43. Her death was caused by complications during an operation that was needed following cosmetic surgery performed in April 2002. Hendry has four children by his wife: Rheagan, Kyle, Callum and Niamh. His son Callum is also a footballer.

On 23 June 2010, Hendry was formally declared bankrupt at Blackpool County Court. It was reported that he faced a tax bill of more than £1m and owed thousands of pounds to other creditors. One of the creditors was SpreadEx, a betting company.

On 22 April 2015, Hendry was banned from driving for 17 months after being tested and found to be almost twice over the legal limit of 35mg alcohol per 100ml of breath.

Hendry was charged with harassing and assaulting an ex-girlfriend in May 2015. He subsequently pleaded guilty to a charge of harassment, while the assault charge was dropped.

<doc id="840974" wikidata="Q648606" url="?curid=840974" title="Falcon 1">
<text>Falcon 1 was a two-stage small-lift launch vehicle that was operated from 2006 to 2009 by SpaceX, an American aerospace manufacturer. On 28 September 2008, Falcon 1 became the first privately developed fully liquid-fueled launch vehicle to successfully reach orbit.

The Falcon 1 used LOX/RP-1 for both stages, the first stage powered by a single pump-fed Merlin engine, and the second stage powered by SpaceX&#x27;s pressure-fed Kestrel vacuum engine.

The vehicle was launched a total of five times. After three failed launch attempts, Falcon 1 achieved orbit on its fourth attempt in September 2008 with a mass simulator as a payload. On 14 July 2009, Falcon 1 made its second successful flight, delivering the Malaysian RazakSAT satellite to orbit on SpaceX&#x27;s first commercial launch (fifth and final launch overall). 

While SpaceX had announced an enhanced variant, the Falcon 1e, following this flight, the Falcon 1 was retired in favor of the Falcon 9 v1.0, the first version of the company’s successful and long-running Falcon 9 launch vehicle.

== History ==

=== Private funding ===
The Falcon 1 rocket was developed with private funding. 
The only other orbital launch vehicles to be privately funded and developed were the Conestoga in 1982; and Pegasus, first launched in 1990, which uses a large aircraft as its launch platform.

The total development cost of Falcon 1 was approximately US$90 million to US$100 million. 

While the development of Falcon 1 was privately funded, the first two Falcon 1 launches were purchased by the United States Department of Defense under a program that evaluates new US launch vehicles suitable for use by DARPA.

=== Cancelled launches ===
As part of a US$15 million contract, Falcon 1 was to carry the TacSat-1 in 2005. By late May 2005, SpaceX stated that Falcon 1 was ready to launch TacSat-1 from Vandenberg. But the Air Force did not want the launch of an untested rocket to occur until the final Titan IV flew from nearby SLC 4E. Subsequent and repeated delays due to Falcon 1 launch failures delayed TacSat-1&#x27;s launch. After TacSat-2 was launched on an Orbital Sciences Minotaur I on 16 December 2006, the Department of Defense re-evaluated the need for launching TacSat-1. In August 2007, the Department of Defense canceled the planned launch of TacSat-1 because all of the TacSat objectives had been met.

An August 2005 update on SpaceX&#x27;s website showed 6 launches planned for Falcon 1, with customers including MDA Corp (CASSIOPE, which eventually launched in 2013 on Falcon 9), Swedish Space Corp and US Air Force.

== Design ==
According to SpaceX, the Falcon 1 was designed to minimize price per launch for low-Earth-orbit satellites, increase reliability, and optimize flight environment and time to launch. It also was used to verify components and structural design concepts that would be reused in the Falcon 9. SpaceX started with the idea that the smallest useful orbital rocket was the minimum viable product (Falcon 1 with about to orbit), instead of building something larger and more complicated, and then running out of money and going bankrupt. 
=== First stage ===
The first stage was made from friction-stir-welded 2219 aluminum alloy. It employs a common bulkhead between the LOX and RP-1 tanks, as well as flight pressure stabilization. It can be transported safely without pressurization (like the heavier Delta II isogrid design) but gains additional strength when pressurized for flight (like the Atlas II, which could not be transported unpressurized). The parachute system, built by Irvin Para­chute Corp­oration, uses a high-speed drogue chute and a main chute.

For the first two launches, the Falcon 1 used a Merlin 1A engine. An improved version of the Merlin 1A, the Merlin 1B, was supposed to fly on later flights of the Falcon 1, although it was further improved to create the Merlin 1C, which was first flown on the third Falcon 1 flight, and on the first 5 flights of the Falcon 9. The Falcon 1 first stage was powered by a single pump-fed Merlin 1C engine burning RP-1 and liquid oxygen providing of sea-level thrust and a specific impulse of 245 s (vacuum Isp 290 s). The first stage burns to depletion, taking around 169 seconds to do so.

=== Second stage ===
The second stage Falcon 1 tanks were built with a cryogenic-compatible 2014 aluminum alloy,
with the plan to move to aluminum-lithium alloy on the Falcon 1e.
The helium pressurization system pumps propellant to the engine, supplies heated pressurized gas for the attitude control thrusters, and is used for zero-&quot;g&quot; propellant accumulation prior to engine restart. The Kestrel engine includes a titanium heat exchanger to pass waste heat to the helium, thereby greatly extending its work capacity. 
The pressure tanks are composite overwrapped pressure vessels made by Arde corporation with inconel alloy and are the same as those used in the Delta III.

The second stage was powered by a pressure-fed Kestrel engine with of vacuum thrust and a vacuum specific impulse of 330 s.

=== Reusability ===
The first stage was originally planned to return by parachute to a water landing and be recovered for reuse, but this capability was never demonstrated. The second stage was not designed to be reusable.

=== Launch sequence ===
At launch, the first stage engine (Merlin) is ignited and throttled to full power while the launcher is restrained and all systems are verified by the flight computer. If the systems are operating correctly, the rocket is released and clears the tower in about seven seconds. The first-stage burn lasts about 2 minutes and 49 seconds. Stage separation is accomplished with explosive bolts and a pneumatically actuated pusher system. The second stage Kestrel engine burns for about six minutes, inserting the payload into a low Earth orbit. It is capable of multiple restarts.

== Pricing ==
SpaceX quoted Falcon 1 launch prices as being the same for all customers. In 2005 Falcon 1 was advertised as costing $5.9 million ($7.3 million when adjusted for inflation in 2015). In 2006 until 2007 the quoted price of the rocket when operational was $6.7 million. In late 2009 SpaceX announced new prices for the Falcon 1 and 1e at $7 million and $8.5 million respectively, with small discounts available for multi-launch contracts, and in 2012 announced that payloads originally selected as flying on the Falcon 1 and 1e would fly as secondary payloads on the Falcon 9.

Historically, the Falcon 1 was originally planned to launch about to low-Earth orbit for but later declined to approximately as the price increased to approximately . It was SpaceX&#x27;s offering intended to open up the smallsat launch market to competition. The final version of the Falcon 1, the Falcon 1e, was projected to provide approximately for US$11 million. 
Several years ago, SpaceX was going to open up the smallsat launch market with the Falcon 1, which originally was to launch about 600 kilograms to LEO for $6 million; the payload capacity later declined to about as the price increased to around $9 million. Later, the Falcon 1e was to provide approximately for $11 million, but the company withdrew the vehicle from the market, citing limited demand.

== Launch sites ==

All flights were launched from Kwajalein Atoll using the SpaceX launch facility on Omelek Island and range facilities of the Reagan Test Site.

Vandenberg AFB Space Launch Complex 3W was the original launch site for Falcon 1, but it was abandoned at the test-fire stage due to persistent schedule conflicts with adjacent launch pads. Cape Canaveral Air Force Station Space Launch Complex 40 (the Falcon 9 pad) was considered for Falcon 1 launches but never developed before Falcon 1 was retired.

==Variants==

==Launches==
Falcon 1 made five launches. The first three failed, however the subsequent two flights were successful, the first successful launch making it the first privately funded and developed liquid-propellant rocket to reach orbit. The fifth launch was its first commercial flight, and placed RazakSAT into low Earth orbit.
===First flight===

The maiden flight of the Falcon 1 was postponed several times because of various technical issues with the new vehicle. Scheduling conflicts with a Titan IV launch at Vandenberg AFB also caused delays and resulted in the launch moving to the Reagan Test Site in the Kwajalein Atoll. The maiden launch was scheduled for 31 October 2005, but was held off, then rescheduled for 25 November, which also did not occur. Another attempt was made on 19 December 2005 but was scrubbed when a faulty valve caused a vacuum in the first stage fuel tank, causing the walls of the tank to sunk inward, resulting in structural damage. After replacing the first stage, Falcon 1 launched Saturday, 25 March 2006 at 09:30 local time. The DARPA payload was the United States Air Force Academy&#x27;s FalconSAT–2, which would have measured space plasma phenomena.

The launch took place on Saturday, 24 March 2006 at 22:30 UTC, from the SpaceX launch site on Omelek Island in the Marshall Islands. It ended in failure less than a minute into the flight because of a fuel line leak and subsequent fire. The vehicle had a noticeable rolling motion after liftoff, as shown on the launch video, rocking back and forth a bit, and then at T+26 seconds rapidly pitched over. Impact occurred at T+41 seconds onto a dead reef about 250 feet from the launch site. The FalconSAT–2 payload separated from the booster and landed on the island, with damage reports varying from slight to significant. SpaceX initially attributed the fire to an improperly tightened fuel-line nut. A later review by DARPA found that the nut was properly tightened, since its locking wire was still in place, but had failed because of corrosion from saltwater spray.

SpaceX implemented numerous changes to the rocket design and software to prevent this type of failure from recurring, including stainless steel to replace aluminum hardware and pre-liftoff computer checks that increased by a factor of thirty.

===Second flight===
The second test flight was originally scheduled for January 2007, but was delayed because of problems with the second stage. Before the January launch date, SpaceX had stated earlier potential launch dates, moving from September 2006 to November and December. In December the launch was rescheduled for 9 March, but delayed because of range availability issues caused by a Minuteman III test flight, which would re-enter over Kwajalein. The launch attempt on 19 March was delayed 45 minutes from 23:00 GMT because of a data-relay issue, and then scrubbed 1 minute 2 seconds before launch at 23:45 because of a computer issue, whereby the safety computer incorrectly detected a transmission failure caused by a hardware delay of a few milliseconds in the process. 20 March attempt was delayed 65 minutes from an originally planned time of 23:00 because of a problem with communications between one of the NASA experiments in the payload and the TDRS system.

The first launch attempt on 21 March 2007 was aborted at 00:05 GMT at the last second before launch and after the engine had ignited. It was, however, decided that another launch should be made the same day. The rocket successfully left the launch pad at 01:10 GMT on 21 March 2007 with a DemoSat payload for DARPA and NASA. The rocket performed well during the first-stage burn. However, during staging, the interstage fairing on the top of the first stage bumped the second-stage engine bell. The bump occurred as the second-stage nozzle exited the interstage, with the first stage rotating much faster than expected (a rotation rate of about 2.5°/s vs. expected rate of 0.5°/s maximum), thereby making contact with the niobium nozzle of the second stage. Elon Musk reported that the bump did not appear to have caused damage, and that the reason why they chose a niobium skirt instead of carbon–carbon was to prevent problematic damage in the event of such incidents. Shortly after second-stage ignition, a stabilization ring detached from the engine bell as designed. At around T+4:20, a circular coning oscillation began, which increased in amplitude until video was lost. At T+5:01, the vehicle started to roll, and telemetry ended. According to Elon Musk, the second-stage engine shut down at T+7:30 because of a roll-control issue. Sloshing of propellant in the LOX tank increased oscillation. This oscillation would normally have been dampened by the Thrust Vector Control system in the second stage, but the bump to the second-stage nozzle during separation caused an overcompensation in the correction. The rocket continued to within one minute of its expected duration and also managed to deploy the satellite mass-simulator ring. While the webcast video ended prematurely, SpaceX was able to retrieve telemetry for the entire flight. The status of the first stage is unknown; it was not recovered because of problems with a nonfunctioning GPS tracking device. The rocket reached a final altitude of and a final velocity of 5.1 km/s, compared to 7.5 km/s needed for orbit.

SpaceX characterized the test flight as a success, having flight-proven over 95% of Falcon 1&#x27;s systems. Their primary objectives for this launch were to test responsive launch procedures and gather data. The SpaceX team planned both a diagnosis and solution vetted by third-party experts, believing that the slosh issue could be corrected by adding baffles to the second-stage LOX tank and adjusting the control logic. Furthermore, the Merlin shutdown transient was to be addressed by initiating shutdown at a much lower thrust level, albeit at some risk to engine reusability. The SpaceX team wished to work on the problem to avoid a recurrence as they changed over into the operational phase for Falcon 1.

===Third flight===
SpaceX attempted the third Falcon 1 launch on 3 August 2008 (GMT) from Kwajalein. This flight carried the Trailblazer (Jumpstart-1) satellite for the US Air Force, the NanoSail-D and PREsat nanosatellites for NASA and a space burial payload for Celestis. The rocket did not reach orbit. However, the first stage, with the new Merlin 1C engine, performed perfectly.

When preparing for launch, an earlier launch attempt was delayed by the unexpected slow loading of helium onto the Falcon 1; thus exposing the fuel and oxidizer to the cryogenic helium, rendering the vehicle in a premature launch state. Still within the specified window, the launch attempt was recycled, but aborted half a second before lift-off because of a sensor misreading. The problem was resolved, and the launch was again recycled. With 25 minutes left in the launch window, the Falcon 1 lifted off from Omelek Island at 03:35 UTC. During the launch, small vehicle roll oscillations were visible. Stage separation occurred as planned, but because residual fuel in the new Merlin 1C engine evaporated and provided transient thrust, the first stage recontacted the second stage, preventing successful completion of the mission.

The SpaceX flight-3 mission summary indicated that flight 4 would take place as planned and that the failure of flight 3 did not make any technological upgrades necessary. A longer time between first-stage engine shutdown and stage separation was declared to be enough. The full video of the third launch attempt was made public by SpaceX a few weeks after the launch.

Musk blamed himself for the failure of this launch, as well as the two prior attempts, explaining at the 2017 International Astronautical Congress that his role as chief engineer in the early Falcon 1 launches was not by choice and almost bankrupted the company before succeeding:

And the reason that I ended up being the chief engineer or chief designer, was not because I want to, it&#x27;s because I couldn&#x27;t hire anyone. Nobody good would join. So I ended up being that by default. And I messed up the first three launches. The first three launches failed. Fortunately the fourth launch which was – that was the last money that we had for Falcon 1 – the fourth launch worked, or that would have been it for SpaceX.
Musk further explained the situation to Ars Technica journalist Eric Berger:

At the time I had to allocate a lot of capital to Tesla and SolarCity, so I was out of money. We had three failures under our belt. So it&#x27;s pretty hard to go raise money. The recession is starting to hit. The Tesla financing round that we tried to raise that summer had failed. I got divorced. I didn&#x27;t even have a house. My ex-wife had the house. So it was a shitty summer.
===Fourth flight===
Following the three prior failures, the SpaceX team assembled the fourth rocket using available parts in six weeks as a last chance for the company. A Boeing C-17 Globemaster III was chartered to quickly deliver the rocket, but along the way, the rocket partially imploded when repressurization exceeded what the SpaceX team had expected from the C-17&#x27;s manual and the rocket had to undergo emergency repairs to be saved. Despite the challenges, the fourth flight of the Falcon 1 rocket successfully flew on 28 September 2008, delivering a 165-kilogram (363-pound) non-functional boilerplate spacecraft into low Earth orbit. It was Falcon 1&#x27;s first successful launch and the first successful orbital launch of any privately funded and developed, fully liquid-propelled carrier rocket.

The launch occurred from Omelek Island, part of the Kwajalein Atoll in the Marshall Islands. Liftoff occurred at 23:15 UTC on 28 September 15 minutes into a 5-hour launch window. If the launch had been scrubbed, it could have been conducted during the same window until 1 October. 9 minutes 31 seconds after launch, the second-stage engine shut down, after the vehicle reached orbit. The initial orbit was reported to be about 330 × 650 km.
Following a coast period, the second stage restarted and performed a successful second burn, resulting in a final orbit of 621 × 643 km × 9.35°.

The rocket followed the same trajectory as the previous flight, which failed to place the Trailblazer, NanoSail-D, PRESat and Celestis Explorers spacecraft into orbit. No major changes were made to the rocket, other than increasing the time between first-stage burnout and second-stage separation. This minor change addressed the failure seen on the previous flight, recontact between the first and second stages, by dissipating residual thrust in the first-stage engine before separating them.

Ratsat and the attached second stage are still in orbit as of 2021.

=== Fifth flight ===
SpaceX announced that it had completed construction of the fifth Falcon 1 rocket and was transporting the vehicle to the Kwajalein Atoll launch complex where it was to be launched on 21 April 2009, which would be 20 April 2009 in the United States. Less than a week before the scheduled launch date, Malaysian news reported that unsafe vibration levels had been detected in the rocket and repairs were expected to take about six weeks. On 20 April 2009, SpaceX announced in a press release that the launch had been postponed because of a potential compatibility issue between the RazakSAT spacecraft and the Falcon 1 launch vehicle. A concern had been identified regarding the potential impact of predicted vehicle environments on the satellite. On 1 June, SpaceX announced that the next launch window would open Monday, 13 July and extend through Tuesday, 14 July, with a daily window to open at 21:00 UTC (09:00 local time).

The launch on Monday, 13 July was successful, placing RazakSAT into its initial parking orbit. Thirty-eight minutes later, the rocket&#x27;s second-stage engine fired again to circularize the orbit. The payload was then successfully deployed. After the launch Elon Musk, founder and CEO of SpaceX, told a reporter the launch had been a success. &quot;We nailed the orbit to well within target parameters...pretty much a bullseye&quot; Musk said.

The Falcon 1 upper stage is still in low Earth orbit as of 2024.

===End of Program===

Following the fifth flight, future launches of Falcon-1 were postponed, and eventually cancelled, and the vehicle decommissioned from service, with SpaceX stating &quot;We could not make Falcon 1 work as a business.&quot; Launches which had been booked onto Falcon-1 were moved to other vehicles or rebooked as Falcon-9 rideshare payloads.

<doc id="840978" wikidata="Q3135880" url="?curid=840978" title="Tomás Cipriano de Mosquera">
<text>Tomás Cipriano Ignacio Maria de Mosquera y Figueroa Arboleda Salazar, Prieto de Tovar, Vergara, Silva, Hurtado de Mendoza, Urrutia y Guzmán (September 26, 1798 – October 7, 1878) was a Colombian general, political figure, and slaveholder. He was president of Colombia four times. The first time was as president of Republic of New Granada from 1845 to 1849. During the Colombian Civil War of 1860–1862 he led liberal forces in a civil war against conservative factions. After the liberals won, a new, federalist constitution was implemented, which established a two-year presidency, and the nation renamed the United States of Colombia. Mosquera served twice as president of the new government. From 1861 to 1862 he served in a non-elected, interim manner, while the constitution was written. From 1862 to 1864 he served in an elected manner. He had a fourth term from 1866 to 1867. Due to the liberal reforms carried out under his leadership, he is considered one of the most important persons in Colombian history of the 19th century.

Due to large facial wounds received during a battle in 1824, he required the use of a metal prosthesis in his jaw. This affected his ability to speak, which was marked by blowing and whistling sounds. As a result, Mosquera was derisively nicknamed &quot;Mascachochas&quot; (Gaga-chew) by some of his contemporary critics.

== Personal life==
=== Family ===
Mosquera was born in Popayán, on September 26, 1798. His parents were wealthy farm-owner José María de Mosquera-Figueroa y Arboleda and María Manuela de Arboleda y Arrachea, both from prestigious families. His brother Joaquín was President of Gran Colombia, his brother Manuel José was Archbishop of Bogotá, and his brother Manuel María was a diplomat.

=== Marriage and Children ===
General Tomás Cipriano de Mosquera married twice. As was the custom among bourgeoisie at the time, both times he married maternal relatives. His first marriage was to Mariana Benvenuta Arboleda Arroyo, but it has been characterized as unhappy as a result of the frequent cheating of Mosquera, who had a number of children outside of marriage. When Mariana died, he contracted marriage on 1872 to María Ignacia Arboleda Arboleda. Mosquera was 78 at the time, and reportedly when he proposed to her he said, &#x27;Would you like to be the widow of General Mosquera?&#x27; In total he had eight children (with: Mariana Arboleda -Anibal Mosquera and Amalia Mosquera-; María Ignacia Arboleda -José Bolívar Mosquera-; Paula Luque -Clelia Mosquera, Teodulia Mosquera, Isabel Mosquera-; María Lorza -María Engracia Mosquera-; Candelaria Cervantes -Tomás Cervantes Mosquera-).

=== Academic life ===
Mosquera was a self-taught mathematician, historian, and writer, well-versed in Latin, English, French and Italian and wrote different books about philosophy and politics that have academical recognition.

== Military and political career==

=== Beginnings ===
Already by 1814 he was involved in the independence movement and he was under command of General Simón Bolívar. By 1824 he had already been promoted to Lieutenant Colonel, and in that year he battled the royalist Spanish Army under the command of Lieutenant Colonel Agustín Agualongo, during the Pasto Campaign in Barbacoas, (Nariño). It was in this battle that he received the shot that broke his lower jaw and impaired his speech, and that made him the object of the infamous nickname of &quot;Mascachochas.&quot; His prowess in battle was awarded by a promotion to colonel, and he became governor of a number of provinces in the southwest of the country (Buenaventura, Guayaquil, Cauca), at the same time raising among the ranks, and being promoted to general in 1829.

Mosquera was a diplomat in Peru between 1829 and 1830, and subsequently he was a diplomat in various countries in Europe and in the United States (1830–1833). At his return he became a congressman (1834–1837), and later Secretary of War for the conservative government of José Ignacio de Márquez. As secretary of war, Mosquera commanded and was victorious in the War of the Supremes in 1840. He was later sent as ambassador to Peru, Chile and Bolivia, between 1842 and 1845.

=== First Presidential Term (1845–1849) ===

In 1845, the so-called ministerial sector (who later would form the Conservative Party) supported Mosquera as a candidate for Presidency, and he was victorious. During his administration he emphasized economic opening up. In 1846 his administration signed the Mallarino–Bidlack Treaty with the United States. He also was influential in the suppression of remnant colonial taxes, and reinvigorated the tobacco industry. It was also during his term that the International System of Units was implemented. Mosquera also started political measures to separate the State and Catholic Church. He also hired Thomas Reed to direct the building of Capitolio Nacional. His administration was also first one in the history of the Country to conduct a census. Finally, he promoted steam navigation over the Magdalena River, when he authorized in 1849 that exports could pass by the port of Barranquilla.

His political measures were frowned upon by the sectors that had previously supported him in his presidential election, and he was much closer to liberals. By the end of his term he moved to New York city to devote in his family business, and he created an international trade house in there which went bankrupt. While in New York, he wrote his &#x27;Memoria sobre geografía física y política de Nueva Granada&#x27;, one of his many treatises in Colombian geography. He was member of a number of scientific societies in Latin America and Europe. He went back to Colombia some years later to fight the so-called Artisans&#x27; Revolution, and to defeat the dictatorship of José María Melo in 1854. By then he had fully converted to the liberal party, and as such he was a representative and senator in the Congress, as well as a candidate to presidential reelection in 1857, which he lost to conservative Mariano Ospina Rodríguez. With the creation of Granadine Confederation, Mosquera was elected president of the Cauca State, a position from which he made opposition to president Ospina, to whom he accused of disrespecting the states&#x27; autonomy.

=== Civil War 1860–1862 ===

In 1860 Mosquera declared the secession of the Cauca State and declared war to the Granadine Confederation. He soon received support from the states of Santander and Tolima, which proclaimed him governor. After heavy battles Colombian Civil War, Mosquera was able to seize the power in 1861, after which he promoted the creation of the United States of Colombia.

=== Second and Third Presidential Terms (1861–1864) ===

During his second term as president (1861–1863), Mosquera enacted several decrees aimed to control the power of the Catholic Church, selling many of its properties to invigorate the economy and giving them to the poor Colombian people, and banning Jesuits from the country for their open support for the Conservative faction. Despite some dissent, a federal and liberal constitution was proclaimed that guaranteed rights to citizens. All the signers supported this Constitution. It was decided that Mosquera should complete the first two-year term as President of the United States of Colombia, until April 1864.

Mosquera&#x27;s third term included war against Ecuador in 1863, and he personally commanded the Colombian army to victory. This would be the only international conflict to date between the two countries. At the end of his term, he traveled to Paris as ambassador to France.

=== Fourth Presidential Term (1866–1867), retirement and death ===
In 1866 Mosquera went back to Colombia, to be elected President for the fourth time, despite the opposition of radical liberals. Nevertheless, tensions with the Catholic Church led to strong intervention by Pope Pius IX, and his use of dictatorial measures (such as the closing of the ordinary sessions of Congress in 1867) led the opposition to orchestrate a coup d&#x27;état on May 23, 1867. His enemies were besides aware that Mosquera was ready to sue corrupted politicians that had taken advantage of the properties that belonged to the Catholic Church and were assigned to the poor ones. He was exiled for the three next years, during which he lived in Lima, where he wrote his book &#x27;Cosmogonía. Estudio sobre los diversos sistemas de la creación del universo&#x27; (Cosmogony. A study of the diverse systems of the creation of the universe). Back in Colombia by 1871, he ran for president again but failed, although he was elected to the presidency of Cauca State until 1873. He was a senator again in 1876.

He died October 7, 1878, in his farm Coconuco, in Puracé, close to Popayán. He was buried in the Panteón de los Próceres cemetery in Popayán.

<text>The Toronto Evening Telegram was a conservative, broadsheet afternoon newspaper published in Toronto from 1876 to 1971. It had a reputation for supporting the Conservative Party at the federal and the provincial levels. The paper competed with an afternoon paper, &quot;The Toronto Daily Star&quot;, which supported the Liberals. &quot;The Telegram&quot; strongly supported Canada&#x27;s connection with the United Kingdom and the rest of the British Empire as late as the 1960s.

==History==
&quot;The Toronto Evening Telegram&quot; was founded in 1876 by publisher John Ross Robertson. He had borrowed to buy the assets of &quot;The Liberal&quot;, a defunct newspaper, and published his first edition of 3,800 copies on April 18, 1876. The editor of &quot;Telegram&quot; from 1876 to 1888 was Alexander Fraser Pirie (1849–1903), a native of Guelph. Pirie had worked for the &quot;Guelph Herald&quot;, his father&#x27;s paper.

The newspaper became the voice of working-class, conservative Protestant Orange Toronto. In 1881, Robertson erected a building for the paper at the southeast corner of King and Bay Streets, on Melinda Street. John R. (Black Jack) Robinson succeeded Pirie as editor-in-chief in 1888 and held that position until he died in 1928.

&quot;The Telegram&quot; focused on local issues and became the largest circulation daily in Toronto, but it lost that position in 1932 to the &quot;Toronto Daily Star&quot; and never regained it. During the early 20th century, &quot;The Tely&quot;, as it was popularly known was one of the first Canadian newspapers to introduce Saturday (and in 1957 Sunday) colour comics section (which by its later years spanned two sections), and a radio (and after 1952 television) magazine with listings for the entire week. Following the death of Robertson&#x27;s widow in 1947, the paper was bought by George McCullagh, the publisher of &quot;The Globe and Mail&quot;, for . &quot;Evening&quot; was dropped from the paper&#x27;s name in 1949.

McCullagh died in 1952, and the paper was then purchased by John W. H. Bassett for with money borrowed from the Eaton family. In March 1957, the paper introduced a Sunday edition, the first Toronto paper to do so, and was threatened by the Attorney-General of Ontario with charges under the &quot;Lord&#x27;s Day Act&quot;. The Sunday edition was unsuccessful and ceased publication after four months.

In December 1959, Bassett bought a property on Front Street West (formerly Regis College (Toronto)/Loretto Abbey) and in 1963 moved the &quot;Telegram&quot; to a new building at that location from the site at Bay and Melinda Street where the paper had been produced since 1899. At the same time, Telegram Corporation acquired a majority interest in Toronto TV station CFTO-TV.

In July 1964, the International Typographical Union called a strike at the &quot;Telegram&quot;, the &quot;Star&quot;, and &quot;The Globe and Mail&quot;. All three papers continued to publish despite the strike.

The &quot;Telegram&quot; lost in 1969 and $921,000 in 1970 and was on pace to lose another $900,000 in 1971 when it was shut down that year by Bassett on October 30, just as a strike was looming. Many employees moved to the &quot;Toronto Sun&quot;, which launched the Monday after the &quot;Telegram&quot; ceased publication. The &quot;Telegram&quot; subscriber list was sold to the &quot;Toronto Star&quot; for . The &quot;Star&quot; also leased the &quot;Telegram&quot;&#x27;s Front Street facility, until it was sold to &quot;The Globe and Mail&quot;.

In the book &quot;The Death of the Toronto Telegram&quot; (1971), the former &quot;Telegram&quot; writer Jock Carroll described the decline of the paper and provided many anecdotes about the Canadian newspaper business from the 1950s to 1970.

York University&#x27;s library holds about 500,000 prints and 830,000 negatives of pictures taken by the &quot;Telegram&quot;&#x27;s photographers. Over 13,000 images are currently searchable on line, with more appearing on a regular basis.

<text>Aguanga (; Luiseño: &quot;Awáanga&quot;, meaning &quot;dog place&quot;) is a census-designated place located within the Inland Empire in Riverside County, California. It is located about east of Temecula and south-southeast of Hemet. Aguanga lies at an elevation of 1955 feet (596 m). As of the 2010 census, it had a population of 1,028.

==History==
The town gets its name from a former village of the Native village called awáanga, meaning &#x27;dog place&#x27;. Butterfield Overland Mail established a station 1.7 miles to the west of the current post office in 1858. It was at first called Tejungo Station and was located 14 miles east of Temecula Station and 12 miles northwest of Oak Grove Stage Station. The wooden building was located in a grove of trees a few hundred feet from the stage road. Soon, however, it became known as Aguanga Station after the name of the nearby Luiseño village.

The November 7, 1861, report of Lieut. Col. Joseph R. West, mentioned the abandoned station location was then called Giftaler’s Ranch, after its German owner Joseph Giftaler, in a journal of his unit&#x27;s march to Fort Yuma on the old Butterfield Overland Mail route. In a later Civil War itinerary of the route, it is referred to as the &quot;Dutchman&#x27;s&quot;. In 1863, Camp Giftaler Ranch was established at the ranch as a post along the march route of troops to the Arizona Territory by the Union army.

In 1864, Giftaler&#x27;s Ranch was purchased by Jacob Bergman, also a German immigrant, stagecoach driver and Union army veteran, who operated the Bergman Ranch there for many years until his death on September 13, 1894. After the Civil War, he ran Bergman&#x27;s Stage Station there for the Banning and Tomlinson Stage lines for many years. During the Julian gold rush, he ran the Guahonga post office there from July 27, 1870, to September 13, 1871. The post office for the area was then moved to Oak Grove until the Bergman post office was opened in 1894, but its name was changed to Aguanga in 1901.

Today the station site is on the Twin Creek Stage Stop Ranch, on Allmouth Road, found just east of the Stagecoach Inn at 43851 Highway 79. The ruins of the old wooden station building and ranch house is located among a grove of trees, at the foot of the west end of the hill at the bottom of the meadow, along the right fork of Allmouth Road. The small, fenced-in Bergman Family Cemetery and the Jacob Bergman Marker are found on Caprice Road, 200 feet from the highway, just across the highway from the entrance to the ranch and a short distance to the east.

===2020 shooting===
On September 7, 2020, deputies with the Riverside County Sheriff&#x27;s Department responded to reports of an assault with a deadly weapon at a residence along Route 371. Upon responding, they found a woman suffering gunshot wounds, who eventually died from her injuries after being rushed to a hospital. The deputies then discovered six additional victims inside the home, all of whom were dead from gunshots. Authorities believed the shooting was an isolated incident. The residence where the shooting occurred was reportedly being used to grow illegal marijuana. Authorities did not find a motive or any viable suspects. The shooting is the deadliest in Riverside County&#x27;s history. In 2024, new details came out, no suspects were captured, but police believe the robbery was committed by gang members of Laotian descent, and the motive was drug competition/robbery related, because 1,000 pounds and hundreds of plants of weed were on the property, which is 1-5 million dollars worth of drugs, and the victims were recent immigrants from Laos.

===Nixon Fire===
On July 29, 2024, the Nixon Fire ignited near Tule Valley Road and Richard Nixon Boulevard.

<text>Tectamus (Ancient Greek: Τέκταμος &quot;craftsman&quot;, derived from &quot;tectainomai &quot;&quot;to build&quot;, &quot;plan&quot;, from &quot;tecton&quot;, &quot;carpenter&quot;, &quot;builder&quot;) was a king of Crete and hero of ancient Hellenic mythology. He was also called [[Tectaphus]], Teutamus (), Tectauus () and Tectaeus ().

== Name ==
Joseph Vendryes had suggested that the name &quot;Teutamus&quot;, after the legendary Pelasgian founder, may contain the Proto-Indo-European root (&#x27;tribe, people&#x27;). Later scholars proposed a relation of Pelasgian &quot;Teutamus&quot; with similar names that appear in Italy in later times.

== Mythology ==
Tectamus was the son of Dorus and grandson of Hellen. According to Diodorus Siculus, Tectamus invaded Crete together with a horde of Aeolian and Pelasgian settlers and became the island&#x27;s king. It was the third of the tribes that migrated to Crete. According to another version, Tectamus was a chief of Dorians and Achaeans. He married Cretheus&#x27; (Cres’) daughter who gave birth to his son Asterion.

== In later Greek historiography ==
Historian Ctesias wrote of a king of &quot;Assyrian&quot; provenance named Teutamus, and this historical personage appears in an epic tale involving Memnon, son of Eos.

<doc id="841006" wikidata="Q1013827" url="?curid=841006" title="Kilwinning">
<text>Kilwinning (, ; ) is a town in North Ayrshire, Scotland. It is located on the banks of the River Garnock in Ayrshire, west/central Scotland, about southwest of Glasgow. Kilwinning&#x27;s neighbours are the coastal towns of Stevenston to the west and Irvine to the south while inland lies Dalry to the north. It is known as &quot;The Crossroads of Ayrshire&quot;. Kilwinning was also a Civil Parish. The 2001 Census recorded the town as having a population of 15,908.
The estimated population in 2016 was 16,460.

==History==
Kilwinning dates back to the 8th century. The Kilwinning Community Archaeology Project carried out a dig in Kilwinning Abbey in 2010, which revealed much about the life of the people in the area during the medieval period.

According to John Hay, once the headmaster of the parish school in Kilwinning, &quot;North Ayrshire has a history of religion stretching back to the very beginning of missionary enterprise in Scotland. The Celtic Christians or Culdees of the period of St Columba and St Mungo found here, in this part of Scotland, a fertile field for the propagation of the faith. Kilmarnock, Kilbride, Kilbirnie, are all, like Kilwinning, verbal evidence of the existence of &#x27;Cillean&#x27; or cells of the Culdee or Celtic Church.&quot;

The original town was situated at the Bridgend and Corsehill while the other bank of the river was the site of the abbey, its outbuildings, orchards, doocot, etc. 

The parish was in the ownership of Kelso Abbey from about 1140. Abbot Adam&#x27;s Bridge, was constructed in mediaeval times with much of the original structure standing today. The bridge was widened in 1859. 

After the dissolution of the monasteries, Kilwinning passed to the Earl of Eglington. The Abbey church had been partly destroyed during the Reformation and a new parish church built in 1775. Lord Eglington restored the Abbey church tower in 1789 and then replaced it in 1814.

==Toponomy==

In the distant past, the town was called Sagtoun, or Saint&#x27;s Town, after St. Winning, the founder of an early seventh-century church on this site. However, the actual identity of St. Winning is unclear. Some scholars have associated him with the Irish saint known as St Finnian of Moville, who died in the late sixth century. Others believe he was a Welshman by the name of Vynnyn, and the Aberdeen Breviary of 1507 asserts that he was from Scotland. The work of Professor Owen Clancy of the University of Glasgow in 2001 makes another identification possible. Clancy argued that, in fact, Saint Ninian and Saint Finnian were the same person, the difference being attributed to an error on the part of a medieval scribe. If that is so, then Ninian, who was a missionary to the Picts in Scotland, and Winning, who was deemed a Scotsman in the Aberdeen Breviary, could theoretically be one and the same as the Irishman named Finnian. The Aberdeen Breviary implies he was Irish. In early medieval times the term &quot;Scots&quot;/&quot;Scotland&quot; applied also to Ireland. It speaks of the saint originating from a Scottish province, setting sail with companions, and landing at Cunninghame in Lesser Scotland, the latter being a term used in those times to refer to the country which would later be designated by name Scotland.

==Masonic links==

Kilwinning is notable for housing the original Lodge of Freemasonry in Scotland. When the Lodges were renumbered, Kilwinning was kept as Lodge Number &#x27;0&#x27;, the Mother Lodge of Scotland.

The origin of the Lodge is unclear with the first documentary evidence being a mention in The Schaw Statutes of 1598 and 1599, which identify it in its first paragraph as the &quot;heid and secund ludge of Scotland&quot;.

The lodge&#x27;s own legend attributes the formation to the building of the Abbey at Kilwinning in the 12th century. There existed in this period corporations or fraternities of masons, endowed with certain privileges and immunities, capable of erecting religious structures in the Gothic style. A party of these foreign masons is supposed to have come from Italy, or Cologne, for the purpose of building the Abbey at Kilwinning and to have founded there the first regularly constituted Operative Lodge in Scotland. The Lodge is reputed to have been held in the chapter house on the eastern side of the cloisters. On the broken walls and moldering arches of the Abbey numerous and varied Masons&#x27; marks may be seen.

==Modern Kilwinning==
In 1966, Kilwinning fell within the area designated Irvine New Town. Kilwinning rapidly expanded with new estates built on surrounding farm land to meet the planned increase in population.

Today Kilwinning consists of the pedestrianised historic town centre, Bridgend (which originally was a separate village), both now surrounded by the estates of Corsehill, Woodwynd, Blacklands, Pennyburn, Whitehirst Park, and Woodside with the last three being added after its incorporation into Irvine New Town. Kilwinning is a diverse town as areas like Whitehirst Park and Woodside are very affluent and have very high house prices, Parts of Woodwynd also have affluent areas while parts of the town, More so Blacklands, Pennyburn and Corsehill are more working class 

Older residents sometimes refer to the Blacklands as the &quot;Ironworks&quot; after the Eglinton Iron Works which once occupied the land, the only surviving building of that time is now Nethermains Community Centre, although for many years the &quot;slag hill&quot; towered over the area. It was cleared in 1979, and the stone used to build the terminal at Hunterston, with the site being landscaped as Almswall Park.

The Main Street of Kilwinning has recently been refurbished as part of the regeneration of the Irvine Bay area by Irvine Bay Regeneration Company.

==Eglinton Castle and Country Park==

The ancient seat of the Earls of Eglinton, it is located just south of Kilwinning. Built between 1797 and 1802 in Gothic castellated style dominated by a central 100-foot (30 m) large round keep and four 70-foot (21 m) outer towers, it was second only to Culzean Castle in appearance and grandeur. The foundation stone of the new Eglinton Castle in Kilwinning was laid in 1797, the 12th Earl of Eglinton, was proud to have the ceremony performed by Alexander Hamilton of Grange, grandfather of the American Alexander Hamilton.

The castle is chiefly remembered, in modern times, as the scene of the Eglinton Tournament in 1839, which was a magnificent display. Funded and organized by Archibald Montgomerie, 13th Earl of Eglinton, the revival-medieval tournament, attracted thousands of visitors to see the combatants and the ladies in their finery. Among the guests was the future Emperor of the French—Napoleon III. The tournament was an ironic contrast between the old and the new! Excursion trains, among the first ever, were run from Ayr (pre-dating the formal opening of the line in 1840).

Today the castle is a ruin. The Tournament perhaps marked a turning point, being a severe drain on the Eglinton family fortune, which coincided with bottomless expenditure on the Ardrossan harbour and the Glasgow, Paisley and Ardrossan Canal. The castle fell into disrepair after being unroofed in 1925 and was used for Commando demolition practice during World War II, the remains were demolished to the level they are today in 1973. Eglinton Country Park is now a tourist attraction.

==Industry and commerce==

Kilwinning was a noted centre of Archery in medieval times. Later the town had an association with coal mining, quarrying, iron-founding and textile manufacture, now long since declined.

The Pringle knitwear company originally manufactured their goods in Kilwinning. Another company that existed was Wilson&#x27;s Foods, which operated a plant in the grounds of the Eglinton Estate, but this has since closed.

The mill on the banks of the River Garnock briefly fell under the ownership of Blackwood Brothers of Kilmarnock before closing entirely. The site of the mill is largely unchanged, though part of the old factory has been demolished, and the former mill shop now operates as the offices and salesroom for a local car dealership that now uses the site.

The Nethermains Industrial Estate is home to many industrial units of the type commonly built in the 1960s and 1970s as modular units ideal for light industry. Fullarton Computer Industries are one of the large employers in this site. Modern Kilwinning&#x27;s industries include the manufacture of plastics and electronics. Almost 1/4 of Kilwinning&#x27;s workforce is employed by manufacturing.

A new building stands in its place, next to the St Andrews Academy site now known as St Matthews Academy providing education for the towns surrounding Saltcoats.

A large campus of Ayrshire College (formerly James Watt College) was built in Kilwinning in 1998 and was completed in the summer of 2000 ready for the first intake of students in August that year. Its arrival has brought some benefits to the town with increased revenue from the students supporting local businesses. Since 2013 the campus has been part of Ayrshire College, having merged with the Largs campus as well as Kilmarnock College and Ayr College.

It is notable that 37% of Kilwinning residents aged 16–74 have no formal qualifications; the national average is 33%.

There are a number of Community Halls in Kilwinning: Nethermains Community Centre, Cranberry Moss Community Centre, Whitehurst Community Centre, Pryde, The Woodwynd Hall and the Love Memorial Hall.

==Sport==

===Archery===

The Ancient Society of Kilwinning Archers is believed to date back to 1483 and while records are only available from 1688, there is a reference in the early minutes, which would appear to confirm this assumption.

The sport still continues in Kilwinning to this very day. The annual papingo shoot is held in the grounds of the old Abbey on the first Saturday in June, when the wooden bird is mounted on a pole and suspended from the clock tower to allow the archers to attempt to dislodge the wings and then the bird itself. In 2014, Michael Portillo visited the Ancient Society of Kilwinning Archers during a visit to Kilwinning on his Great British Railway Journeys TV series for the BBC.

===Football===
Kilwinning Rangers F.C., or The Buffs as they are more affectionately known, play their home games at Buffs Park and compete in the second tier of the West of Scotland Football League (WoSFL). They play in blue and white hoops.

The team was formed in 1899 as a Juvenile football club, originally playing at Blacklands Park, which they shared with the then senior side of Eglinton Seniors. They officially became a Junior football club on 26 July 1902.

The name Buffs was first recorded on 21 September 1900 when the local paper, the &quot;Irvine Herald&quot;, recorded that the so-called Buffs had had an emphatic victory over Kilmarnock Belgrove. Kilwinning Rangers have had periods of success throughout their history, and proudly boast that they were the first, and last Ayrshire Club to win the Scottish Junior Cup in the twentieth century!

Dirrans Athletic AFC were formed in 1946. They currently play in the Ayrshire Amateur Football League Premier Division.

Kilwinning Sports Club, or KSC as it is known locally, was launched in July 2002 in the Pennyburn area of Kilwinning.

In 2022, Kilwinning Rangers Amateurs became known as Eglinton F.C. and joined the fifth tier of the WoSFL.

<doc id="841008" wikidata="Q1067048" url="?curid=841008" title="Vorarephilia">
<text>Vorarephilia (often shortened to vore) is a paraphilia characterized by the erotic desire to be consumed by, or to personally consume, another person or creature, or an erotic attraction to the process of eating in general practice. Soft vore fantasies are separated from sexual fantasies of cannibalism, also referred to as &quot;hard vore&quot;, because the soft vore victim is normally swallowed alive and whole. The word &quot;vorarephilia&quot; is derived from the Latin &#x27; (to &quot;swallow&quot; or &quot;devour&quot;), and [[Ancient Greek]] (&#x27;, &quot;love&quot;).

== Content ==
Usually, vorarephilic fantasies involve a consumer (usually referred to as &quot;predator&quot; or &quot;pred&quot; for short) ingesting one or multiple victims (sometimes called &quot;prey&quot;) in some way. Since vorarephilic fantasies cannot be acted out in reality without injuring or killing someone, they are often expressed in stories or drawings as well as sexual roleplay.

Vore is most often enjoyed through pictures, stories, videos, and video games, and it can appear in mainstream media. Expressions can involve humans, animals, dragons, giant snakes, and other creatures, real or fictional. In some cases, vorarephilia may be described as a variation of macrophilia and may combine with other paraphilias. Apart from macrophilia, vore fantasies often have themes of BDSM, microphilia, pregnancy fetishism, anthropomorphized animals, and sexual cannibalism.

Most vorarephiles are not overly interested in sadomasochism; instead, they may get their pleasure from the psychological aspects, such as the total annihilation of identity. This does not necessarily indicate suicidal tendencies but is more often linked to general fantasies of escapism and solitude.

== Variations ==

There are several variations to the fantasy, often changing the way in which the victim is ingested. Typically, when the victim is consumed orally, artwork may depict what is known as &quot;soft vore&quot;, meaning that the victim is swallowed whole and enters the stomach of the consumer, then is either left unharmed or digested inside. If the victim is kept safe (also known as &quot;endo vore&quot; or &quot;endosoma&quot;), the victim can eventually be let out by regurgitation or defecation, whereas if digestion happens, the victim is usually killed, but may be magically reformed in some cases. The more extreme and less common form of the fetish is &quot;hard vore&quot;, in which the victim is chewed and torn apart by the consumer, followed by a more gruesome depiction of digestion.

Aside from oral vore, there are plenty of subcategories, some of which are:
*Anal vore depicts the victim being ingested through the anus instead of the mouth.
*Unbirth is the ingestion of a victim through the vagina of the consumer.
*Cock vore depicts the insertion of a victim into the penis of the consumer (which may be depicted as erect).
*Breast vore depicts the insertion of a victim into the breasts of the consumer.
As there is room for artistic interpretation and niches, there are many other subcategories that may be less commonly seen, but they all more or less amount to a victim being inserted through a consumer&#x27;s orifice in some way.

The sizes of the consumer and victim can vary. Macro/micro vore is used to describe art in which the victim is much smaller than the consumer. Same-size vore, on the other hand, depicts a scenario where the victim and consumer are roughly the same size.

== Research ==
One case study analysis connected the fantasy with sexual masochism, and suggested that it could be motivated by a desire to merge with a more powerful other or permanently escape loneliness. With &quot;no known treatment&quot; for vorarephiles who feel &#x27;ill&#x27; with their sexuality, psychologists at Toronto&#x27;s Centre for Addiction and Mental Health have recommended trying to &quot;adjust to, rather than change or suppress&quot; the sexual interest. Medication for libido reduction could be used if deemed necessary.

<doc id="841009" wikidata="Q3331866" url="?curid=841009" title="William Blake's mythology">
<text>The prophetic books of the English poet and artist William Blake contain an invented mythology, in which Blake worked to encode his spiritual and political ideas into a prophecy for a new age. This desire to recreate the cosmos is the heart of his work and his psychology. His myths often described the struggle between enlightenment and free love on the one hand, and restrictive education and morals on the other.

==Sources==
Among Blake&#x27;s inspirations were John Milton&#x27;s &quot;Paradise Lost&quot; and &quot;Paradise Regained&quot;, the visions of Emanuel Swedenborg and the near-cabalistic writings of Jakob Böhme. Blake also included his own interpretations of druidism and paganism.

==The Fall of Albion==

The longest elaboration of this private myth-cycle was also his longest poem, &quot;The Four Zoas: The Death and Judgment of Albion The Ancient Man&quot;, written in the late 1790s but left in manuscript form at the time of his death. In this work, Blake traces the fall of Albion, who was &quot;originally fourfold but was self-divided&quot;. This theme was revisited later, more definitively but perhaps less directly, in his other epic prophetic works, &quot;&quot; and &quot;&quot;.

The parts into which Albion is divided are the four Zoas:
*Tharmas: representing instinct and strength.
*Urizen: reason and conventional society; a cruel god resembling the Gnostic Demiurge.
*Luvah: love, passion and emotive faculties; a Christ-like figure, also known as Orc in his most amorous and rebellious form.
*Urthona, also known as Los: inspiration and the imagination.

The Blake pantheon also includes feminine &quot;emanations&quot; that have separated from an integrated male being, as Eve separated from Adam:
*The sexual Enion is an emanation from Tharmas.
*The intellectual Ahania is an emanation from Urizen.
*The nature goddess Vala is an emanation from Luvah (Orc).
*The musical Enitharmon is an emanation from Los (Urthona).

The fall of Albion and his division into the Zoas and their emanations are also the central themes of &quot;Jerusalem The Emanation of the Giant Albion&quot;.

Rintrah first appears in &quot;The Marriage of Heaven and Hell&quot;, personifying revolutionary wrath. He is later grouped together with other spirits of rebellion in the &quot;Visions of the Daughters of Albion&quot;:
*The loud and lustful Bromion.
*The &quot;mild and piteous&quot; Palamabron, son of Enitharmon and Los (also appears in &quot;Milton&quot;).
*The tortured mercenary Theotormon.

==The mythology and the prophetic books==
Scholarship on Blake has not recovered a &quot;perfected&quot; version of Blake&#x27;s myth. The characters in it have to be treated more like a repertory company, capable of dramatising his ideas (which changed, over two decades). On the other hand, the psychological roots of his work have been revealed, and are now much more accessible than they were a century ago.

&quot;America a Prophecy&quot; is also one of the &quot;prophetic works&quot;. Here, the &quot;soft soul&quot; of America appears as Oothoon.

Other works concerning this pantheon:
*&quot;America a Prophecy&quot;
*&quot;The Book of Urizen&quot;
*&quot;The Book of Los&quot;
*&quot;The Book of Ahania&quot;
*&quot;Visions of the Daughters of Albion&quot;

<text>Alien Nations () is a real-time strategy video game developed by Neo Software and published by JoWooD Productions for Microsoft Windows in 1999. It was re-released on GOG.com in 2009. A sequel, &quot;The Nations&quot;, was published in 2001. &quot;Alien Nations&quot; was a commercial hit in the German market, and ultimately sold close to 1 million units worldwide.

== Gameplay ==
&quot;Alien Nations&quot; is a real-time strategy game based on building a nation and conquering others. The player may choose from 3 races – the Pimmons, the Amazons and the Sajkhi. In single-player mode, there are three gameplay modes: Introduction, Campaigns, and Never-ending Game.

== Reception ==
===Sales===
&quot;Alien Nations&quot; was a commercial hit in the German market. &quot;Der Spiegel&quot;″s Frank Patalong noted that it was one of the construction and management simulations that &quot;dominated the German sales charts for years&quot;, alongside &quot;Anno 1602&quot; and the &quot;Settlers&quot; series. In German-speaking countries, it sold 150,000 units after two months on shelves, according to the game&#x27;s Russian publisher Snowball Studios. It was also a success in Russia, with sales of 80,000 units by April 2001. &quot;Alien Nations&quot; ultimately sold &quot;just under a million copies&quot; by 2016, reported Micharl Furtenbach of Red Bull.

===Critical reviews===
Oleg Hazhinskiy of Game.EXE gave the game 4.1/5 and noted its strong similarities with &quot;The Settlers&quot; series. Among differences, he praised the marketing system, but also mentioned lacking combat.

<doc id="841013" wikidata="Q1548122" url="?curid=841013" title="The Beach Boys (album)">
<text>The Beach Boys is the 25th studio album by American rock band the Beach Boys, released on June 10, 1985. Produced by Steve Levine, the album is the band&#x27;s first after the drowning of founding member Dennis Wilson. It was also the band&#x27;s first album to be recorded digitally and the last released by James William Guercio&#x27;s Caribou Records. The record charted at number 52 in the U.S. and number 60 in the UK.

==Production==
Brian Wilson&#x27;s psychologist Eugene Landy, who was originally awarded co-writing credits on Wilson&#x27;s songs, stated in a contemporary interview, &quot;I&#x27;m practically a member of the band [...] Brian&#x27;s got the talent to make the music. [...] He&#x27;s the creator. The other band members are just performers. So I&#x27;m the one who&#x27;s making the album.&quot;

Among the guest musicians, Ringo Starr played drums on &quot;California Calling&quot;, while Stevie Wonder played most of the instruments on &quot;I Do Love You&quot;.

==Reception==
Critical reaction was mixed. Writing in &quot;Rolling Stone&quot;, Parke Puterbaugh called the album &#x27;pretty entertaining&#x27;, adding &#x27;though not a world-beating act of artistic reassertion, the LP does serve to showcase those amazing voices, and to remind the world that nobody does it better—still.&#x27;

==Legacy==
Levine reflected that he had remained &quot;immensely proud&quot; of the album and lamented its poor sales.

==Track listing==
Eugene Landy originally received co-writer&#x27;s credit for all Brian Wilson compositions. This credit was omitted starting with the album&#x27;s 2000 CD reissue.

<text>The National Democratic Party (, NDP) is a political party in Suriname. It was founded on 4 July 1987 by Surinamese leader Dési Bouterse, and was one of the first parties in the country to have a stable base of support across different ethnic groups. In the 2015 general election the party scored 45.56% of the vote and 26 of 51 seats in parliament.

NDP chairman Bouterse was elected President of Suriname on 19 July 2010, after he won the 2010 elections with his Mega Combination of which the NDP was the dominant party. The party won the 2015 elections as well, winning 26 seats against an alliance of 7 (later 6) opposition parties.

In the 2020 elections, the NDP won 16 of the 51 seats. Dési Bouterse lost the presidency and he was succeeded by opposition leader Chan Santokhi. The opposition parties formed a new coalition government. The NDP subsequently became the main opposition party.

== Foundation ==
The NDP was formed from a reorganisation of the &quot;Vijfentwintig Februari Beweging&quot; (VFB, February Twenty-Five Movement), a political movement established on 24 November 1983 by Dési Bouterse and the ruling military junta.

<text>HostAP is a IEEE 802.11 device driver for Linux. It works with cards using the obsolete Conexant (formerly Intersil) Prism 2/2.5/3 chipset and supports Host AP mode, which allows a WLAN card to perform all the functions of a wireless access point.

The driver code was written by Jouni Malinen, hired by Atheros in 2008, and was included into the main kernel tree in Linux 2.6.14.

As of November 2016, HostAP is officially obsolete in the Linux kernel.

<doc id="841034" wikidata="Q713080" url="?curid=841034" title="Osei Kofi Tutu I">
<text>Osei Kofi Tutu I ( – ) was one of the founders of the Ashanti Empire, assisted by Okomfo Anokye, his chief priest and a distant relative from the town of Awukugua–Akuapem. The Asante comes from the Akan ethnic group of West Africa. Osei Tutu I led an alliance of Asante states against the regional hegemony, the Denkyira, completely defeating them. He ruled the Kwaman State between c.1680/c.1695 and 1701 (he was definitely Kumasehene by 1695) and he ruled the Ashanti Empire from late 1701 to around 1717.

== Asantemansu, Kwaaman, Amantoo and Kumasi states ==
It is unclear who out of Oti Akenten, Obiri Yeboa and Osei Tutu founded Kumasi, or at least had its name changed. This is because Kwaaman is in the same place as Kumasi (Kwaaman is Kumasi). According to most accounts, it was Osei Tutu who, with the help of Okomfo Anokye, founded Kumasi after growing trees in three places and seeing which tree grew the best.

However, it is also said that it was Obiri Yeboa who founded Kumasi in an attempt to move his capital away from his Denkyrian overlords, which makes sense as he was the first chief to form the &quot;Asante&quot; (It was not called the Asante yet) coalition against the Dormaa.

But then there&#x27;s Oti Akenten, who waged a series of successful military operations against neighbouring Akan states, bringing a larger surrounding territory into alliance with the Kwaaman state, which can also be known as the Kumaseman state from this point forward. This suggests that the chief settlement of Kwaaman has already been renamed Kumasi or Kumase and that the tale of its founding by Osei Tutu has been lifted from earlier tradition.

This is supported by the fact that Oti Akenten was the first chief to proclaim himself the ruler of all people who would eventually become the Asante.

It is widely agreed that Obiri Yeboa was the first hene to bring together the states together in a confederation either called the Amantoo confederation, or the Kwaaman clan states, with the capital of this new alliance being Kwaaman, with Osei Tutu renaming it due to the kum tree that Tutu sat under while negotiating the terms for the land.

The first time we hear the term Asante in history is out of the mouth of the king of Denkyira, Ntim Gyakari before his execution. He uttered &quot;esa nti&quot;—meaning &quot;because of war&quot;—as it was because of war with the Denkyiras that the Akan city-states that would form the Asante Union joined.

The Amantoo was the region of Akan-speaking peoples, with almost all of the chiefs of the Amantoo belonging to the same clan, which gave them the idea of a union of peoples was already instilled.

== Early life ==

=== Birth ===
The man said to be the creator of the Asante Empire was born Osei Kofi Tutu Opemsoo in around 1660 in the town of Kokofu Anyinam, in the Ashanti Region of modern-day Ghana, which was also the hometown of his mother. He was born when his mother was going to visit her husband, Owusu Panyin, in Esiase to give birth to Osei there, but due to not reaching Esiase in time as planned, she gave birth to Osei in Anyinam. He and his mother stayed there for 40 days, before going back to Kwaaman.

His father was Owusu Panyin, an Akan noble from the Adanse area, who was the chief Esiase. His mother, Maanu Kotosii, was from Kokofu and was the sister of the hene of the Asantemanso and later Kwaaman, Obiri Yeboa, and his brother, who was either the ruler of the lost Asante city of Asantemansu or the ruler of Kwaaman, Oti Akenten.

It is said that Osei Tutu&#x27;s mother was barren for many years, and she, her husband and her brother Obiri Yeboa consulted a powerful and famous shrine called Otutu, whose deity was the deity of the river Kakaawere, in the land Akuapem to obtain a blessing so his sister and brother-in-law could have a child, with Kotosii making two promises: first, that she would reward the river&#x27;s deity if it allowed her to reach home before she gave birth and, secpondly, that she would also show appreciation to the deity if it allowed her to reach home before she gave birth. She fulfilled her promises by naming her child Tutu, after the shrine. Due to the matrilineal succession the Akan practised, it meant that Osei Tutu was the heir to the Kwaaman throne.

Osei Tutu was of the Oyoko abusua (tribe), an abusua that (according to legend) was formed from the Eukona abusua after a portion of the clan broke the Eukona abusua taboo and ate the meat of a buffalo. The people were then referred to as Owekuo, or Oyoko: those who eat buffalo meat.   

=== Time in the Denkyrian court ===
Little is known about the childhood of Osei Tutu, and most of what is known and told about his life dates from when he reached the age of sixteen. At sixteen, the age when Akan boys were now seen as men, a representative of the Denkyirahene travelled into Kwaaman and demanded that Osei Tutu to come with him. This was not unusual, as the Denkyira had a long-standing practice of holding the heirs to their subordinate kings as hostages to ensure compliance. However, while he was a captive, Osei Tutu was not a prisoner in the traditional sense. Political prisoners like the Osei Tutu were treated with intense respect, thus they had a positive view of the Denkyira when they were eventually released to rule their state. So, rather than being locked in a dungeon, Osei Tutu was essentially a guest in the Denkyirahene&#x27;s palace, albeit one who was not allowed to leave. In Abankesesso, the capital of the Denkyiraman, Osei Tutu spent his days socializing with Denkyira elites (a few of which would become important during his lifetime), playing Oware and learning immensely about the traditions and customs of the Denkyira court, specifically about the manner of administration and the maintenance of power in the Denkyira court. He proved his worth so effectively and was so respected in the Denkyiran court that he was eventually made a royal shield-bearer.

=== Affair scandal and flight to Akwamu ===
However, these were not the only activities Osei Tutu was partaking in Abankesesso. It is said that Osei Tutu, even in his childhood, was a strong, handsome male, with all the marks of Akan royalty. Due to this he easily caught the eye of the ladies of the Denkyiran court, courting many. This was a well known fact about Osei Tutu. However, his fall from grace would be in the form of his relationship with the sister or niece of the Denkyria ruler, Princess (Ohene nuabaa) Akobena Abensua. This relationship was not just imprudent, but also adulterous as Abensua was married to a high ranking Denkyrian dignitary, who by some accounts was the Gyaasehene, who had been betrothed to her since they were children. It became worse as the princess fell pregnant, and rumors spread like wildfire on who the father actually was, which were true. Due to Akan law, Abensua would not be getting in trouble for this relationship, but Osei Tutu. Due to the punishment of possible execution for this affair, and at the behest of Abensua, he fled to the Akan state furthest east, Akwamu. This affair would later lead to a tragic sequel decades later.

=== Time in Akwamu ===
Osei Tutu realised that he could not go to his home state of Kwaaman. To do so would certainly bring doom upon his people, who were still subjects of the Denkyirans. Instead, he fled to the Akwamu court of Sasraku I in Akwamufie. There, he begged Sasraku for protection against the Denkyrians. Sasraku took a liking to Osei Tutu. Whether this was due to either him interceding to save the life of a well known diviner (who had angered Sasraku), or to Osei Tutu&#x27;s own personal beauty, is unclear. The fact that Akwamu were enemies with the Denkyrians, and that around this time the Dormaa, enemies of the Akwamu, had gone to war with the Kwaaman, Osei Tutu&#x27;s state, could also have contributed to Osei Tutu being taken in by Sasraku, treated well, and being protected from the Denkyirans. Here Osei Tutu learned much about the military organisations of the Akwamu. This Akan state was possessed of the most advanced and powerful military of any Akan state. He also learned about the political and social makeup of Akwamuman, and saw a difference when it came to rulers. Unlike the Kwaaman, who had formed the Amantoo coalition with states under the yoke of the Denkyrians, and whose rule was divided between clans and cities, the Akwamu were centralized, and had one supreme ruler. The unity of the Akwamu, and the highly sophisticated army that the Akwamu had at their disposal, allowed the Akwamu to spread their influence immensely. These factors of what made the Akwamu so successful, as well as Akwamu culture itself, greatly inspired the future reforms of Osei Tutu.

=== Meeting Okomfo Anokye ===
It is unclear at what specific time period Osei Tutu met Okomfo Anokye. While some sources say that the two met in Denkyira after it is said that after Anokye and his mother left Akwamu, they settled in Denkyria. Kings of his day courted him. With him on their side, they were sure to hit fresh heights of glory. Anokye&#x27;s mother had an odd coloring on her hands. Denkyira were going through some difficulties at the time. Their priests blamed it on her and executed her. Anokye was devastated. He looked forward to the day he could inflict similar pain on the Denkyira rulers, with Osei Tutu had the same ambition having observed the ill-treatment of non-Denkyira people, like Anokye&#x27;s mother. When Osei Tutu fled Denkyira, Okomfo Anokye fled with him. Others say that it was in Akwamu, where some stories state that the two met after Osei Tutu interceded to save the life of Okomfo Anokye when Anokye killed his own grandmother. However, it was certain that by the time Osei Tutu was in Akwamu, the two had certainly met and became best friends, becoming inseparable. Okomfo Anokye would aid Osei Tutu in his future war with the Denkyrians and in the making of the Asante Empire using his spiritual, strong oratorical skills and considerable intellectual and psychological abilities to influence many of the regional states to unite under Osei Tutu and gain military and political strength, which they could use to confront their enemies. Unknown to the two at the time, they were distant cousins.

=== Return to Kwaaman ===
After a few years in Akwamu, Osei Tutu received news that his Uncle, Obiri Yeboa, had been killed repelling an attack from the Dormaa. Due to this, Osei Tutu was told to go home to Kwaaman and take on the role of Kwaamanhene. However, due to Osei Tutu still being a wanted fugitive by the Denkyira, he was too scared to go back to Kwaaman, so Ansa Sasraku detached 300 of some of his best Akwamu warriors to guide him to Kwaaman. When the soldiers, Osei Tutu and Okomfo Anokye arrived at Kwaaman, the warriors settled among them and later became citizens of Asafo, while Osei Tutu and Okomfo Anokye mourned the death of his uncle for a few days, before Osei Tutu was enstooled as Osei Tutu I of Kwaaman.

== Becoming Kwaamanhene, Kumasehene and Amantoohene ==
The state was quite perilous when Osei Tutu took up the throne, with the coalition of the Akan states greatly fractured. It would have been fully broken up for not Osei Tutu taking up the role of Kwaamanhene. To be able to go to war against the Denkyirans in the future, Osei Tutu needed the full, unrivialled backing of the Amantoo Kings.

=== Centralization of power ===
Creation of the Sika Dwa Kofi

It became clear to Osei Tutu that he must prepare for war as his planned unification of the Amantoo could not be made possible until the Denkyrians had been defeated, but he needed to rally the chiefs of Amantoo behind him and him alone to make his much-needed reforms. He spoke of this to his uncles and to the Queen Mother, Manu. After much thought, she advised him to call a great meeting to settle who would be the leader of the Amantoo. This would be done via Anokye, whom was to be called to Kwaaman.

Osei Tutu agreed, and he sent word to Okomfo Anokye via his &#x27;mouth&#x27; (the royal linguist).

Why Anokye was not with Osei Tutu is unclear. Some reasons have been given, one being that Anokye, in his own time, left Akwamu, travelled to Apedwa and to Akwesiho Kwehu and then to Kwaaman. A more popular reason was because he had been enstooled as the Agonahene, although it is said that he was enstooled Agonahene later Manu knew he would come to Kwaaman to reunite with Osei Tutu, whom he loved and honoured, so she decided to make Kwaaman ready for the arrival for the famous Okomfo. So, she sent out, via her servants, for the plants and animals which would be pleasing to the abosom, and she and her women busied themselves with the necessary rites. Then Osei Tutu sent out messengers, summoning his people and those of the Amantoo to Kwaaman telling the messengers to tell the chiefs that the main agenda being the amalgamation of all the Amantooe Chiefs under one paramount Chief whose stool would be greater than all the other stools. He knew in his mind that Okomfo Anokye would in some way have prepared for him a great thing against his enemies.

Concerning the question of who should be chosen as the paramount chief, the great priest and Chief of Agona Okomfo Anokye explained that the problem would be solved by the ancestors and the gods by offering prayers and supplications to them. He said at the end of the prayer, the ancestors and the gods would send a stool from the skies and the chief on whose laps it would descend, and rest would be the chosen paramount chief.

A festive Friday &quot;(Fofie)&quot; was chosen as the day when all the chiefs would converge for the gods and ancestors to choose their king from among them. They were advised by the great priest Okomfo Anokye to continually fast and pour libation to their ancestors and the gods until the chosen day.

So, for many days thousands of men and women of the Amantoo nation came to Kwaaman, all wearing beads and woven or printed cloths and ornaments of gold and copper and brass. Some wore the well-prepared skins of forest beasts; some wore kilts of palm leaf fiber; many brought food and drink, driving in sheep and goats or carrying sacks of meal and roots, or great calabashes full of palm wine, and gave them to Osei Tutu, who was able in this way to feed all that multitude. The lesser henes came with their queen mothers who were delicately marked with fine blue tattooing so that they were perpetually veiled. The drums sounded all day and all night; dancers danced, and the dust rose between the thick clay walls of the houses of Kwaaman, splendidly decorated with raised patterns, and in the great open space where King Osei Tutu sat with counsellors and drummers and horn blowers, his executioners and his speakers, who when he wished to speak to the people, made themselves his voices.

They carried staves of gold and ivory, splendidly carved into animals and fruits and symbols. But the Kwaamanhene Osei Tutu wore the most wonderful golden ornaments; on his fingers were many weighty rings, each made into some figure about which there was a story or saying. His wrists were weighted down by nobbled gold bracelets, so that he must support his hands on the shoulders of his servants. Round his head was a circlet of pure gold, and his sandals were heavy with golden lumps. His chest was bare so that all could see the strength of his breathing, and round his waist was the cloth woven in thin stripes of many colors which proclaimed him as Amantoohene, just as the Kente worn by his chiefs proclaimed their lineage. His mother, Manu, also wore gold, but she was old, and her hair grey and lost the beauty of her youth, for she had borne many children. Yet for not her, this great festival would not have been set up.

Okomfo Anokye had spoken to them both, the Hene and Queen Mother, in the dark of night. He had spoken of a way of overcoming Denkyira, of making the Amantoo into a great nation, ruler of all the Akan states, trading with the caravans of the north across Bornu and Kanem, and with the new white-faced strangers who were coming into southern courts near the great ocean. Okomfo Anokye had made a dazzling prophecy of riches and power. Manu had agreed first, then her son. They half-knew what was to happen.

On the appointed day, under a calm atmosphere the Chiefs converged and as expected each was anxiously hoping to be the paramount chief elect. Osei Tutu took his spot under a Kum tree. The great priest Okomfo Anokye appeared amidst drumming and dancing, after some magical dances and sacrfices, pausing and then jumping in different directions, Okomfo Anokye began speaking to the Supreme Being, shouting, imploring. The blood of sacrifice steamed up, the drums quickened and quickened. A black cloud seemed to gather; first a few of the people saw it, then more, then all. It was blacker than a thunder cloud, but thunder rumblings came from it. And there came a thick white dust, and then falling, slowly, slowly, turning like a seed, came the stool, with its base sending out three branches to support the shaped top. It glinted with gold, yet it was not entirely golden; below the gold it was carved wood. It fell more and more slowly and at last it came to rest upon Osei Tutu&#x27;s lap.

Osei Tutu was said to be a brave man, but now he was surprised and he could not put out one hand to touch the thing that had come from deep heaven. However, Okomfo Anokye, himself also shaking with effort of the great feat, had made ready elephant hides and cloths and laid them on the ground. He took the Golden Stool, or Sika Dwa Kofi, from Osei Tutu, and set it on the cloths. Then he chose an albino man with white skin, pale eyes and reddish hair and sat him down on the stool. He touched this man on the head and it is said that his body disappeared utterly. His soul is said to have gone into the Sika Dwa Kofi, in great honour. And ever since that time, no albino person has been put to death in Asante.

Then Okomfo Anokye spoke aloud to the King and to all the people, saying that now the stool had been given a soul, and that now it had itself become the soul of the Ashanti nation and all their power was bound up with it. So, the Amantoohene and Queen Mother, and each of the chiefs and his queen mother, gave hairs from their bodies and parings from the nails from their forefinger, so that their own souls should become one with this great soul. These were powdered and mixed with water and palm wine and many other herbs and barks, and some was poured over the stool, and some was drunk. Anokye then explained what the Golden Stool was and its functions.

Okomfo Anokye told them that the stool contained the spirit of the Amantoo Nation. No mortal man, not even the Kwaamanhene, sit on this stool. In dire need the Kwaamanhene must seat himself on his own royal stool, resting his arms on the Sika Dwa Kofi. Okomfo Anokye then said that bels were to be made for the stool, two of gold and two of brass, dangling off of the Golden Stool. He said that over the course of the Golden Stool&#x27;s existence, more objects would be added. The occupant of the Golden stool was to be known as the Amantoohene (later Asantehene) and to be subsequently selected from the lineage of Osei Tutu and Obiri Yeboa. Anokye finally stated that the Stool should have its own attendants and special room. He finished his explanation of the Stool by stating that it was greater than any King.

Anokye then explained that the potion they drank meant that they had sworn to the gods, which meant they had taken an oath of allegiance to unite and forget their past individual histories.  Osei Tutu took the oath of allegiance to the stool and the chiefs, and each chief in turn took an oath of allegiance to Nana Osei Tutu and an oath never to raise arms against the Golden Stool.

Renaming of the capital from Kwaaman to Kumasi

In honour of the creation of the Sika Dwa Kofi, Osei Tutu renamed Kwaaman to Kumase, after the kum tree that Tutu sat under while negotiating the terms and new laws for the land, the same Kum tree grown by Obiri Yeboa when testing the land for his people to inhabit. From then on Osei Tutu would not be known as the Kwaamanhene, but the Kumasehene, showing that change had come to the Amantoo, and that a New Era was a hand for them.

== Role as Amantoo and Kumasehene ==
With the full and undisputed backing of the chiefs of Amantoo behind Osei Tutu, he quickly went about reforming the Amantoo confederacy.

=== Reforms ===

==== Finance reforms ====
Osei Tutu&#x27;s first problem was to sort out the financial situation of his kingdom and confederation, as he planned to use the money to fund his military and pay the soldiers. He set up the Afotosanfoɔ to be responsible for his treasury and provided funds for the royal household. This helped focus the funds of the Amantoo confederacy on helping strengthen the military and raise morale.

==== Military reforms ====

Osei Tutu&#x27;s greatest reforms were that of the military of the Amantoo coalition. Using what he had learned in Akwamu and the Akwamu warriors who were now effectively military advisors, he quickly got to work using his funds and money in the coalition&#x27;s treasury to improve his military. He promised pay to his soldiers after battle, raising morale and giving the soldiers a reason not just for why they should fight, but why they should try to win.

He also split the army into several components. A scouting regiment tracked enemy forces, sabotaged their paths, and launched guerrilla style sniper attacks. They were originally made up with hunters, who were skilled in the requirements needed for the military component of the scout. The forward guard, composed of the best trained members of the Ashanti army would fiercely attack the enemy, forcing the enemy into a static defensive position. The four wings would then move around the pinned enemy, attempting to encircle the enemy. The main body provided a manpower reserve for whichever part of the army needed reinforcements. Meanwhile, the rear guard of the army sat at the back of the force, protecting against encirclement. Officers and nobility were protected by a specialized group of bodyguards meant to protect these critical people from being hurt or killed in a potential defeat, a call back to the death of Obiri Yeboa. Either later or at the same time a horde of medics, engineers, supply transporters, and foragers, meant to support the army in non-combat matters, were introduced.

Finally, he and his military advisors drilled his military in hammer-and-anvil tactics, such as the pincer movement. He and his military advisors had optimized their army for these tactics, as well as to be flexible and fast, with every unit contributing to the hammer-and-anvil tactic.

The widespread use of firearms in the Asante army would take decades to fully implement, with access to firearms in such large numbers for the army being extremely expensive. Many parts of the Asante army that made it one of the most bureaucratized and professionalized armies not just in Africa, but in the entire world at that point, would take decades to fully implement, and would not be finished until the final days of Osei Tutu.

=== Revenge against the Dormaa ===
Nevertheless, these quick and much needed reforms introduced by Osei Tutu and his military advisors did have the desired effect of making the Amantoo alliance. When the Dormaa marched into the lands of the Amantoo to once again try to take Kwaaman, the Amantoo military successfully and easily repelled them and then followed it up by completely driving the Dormaa from the lands of Amantoo. The military reforms of Osei Tutu paid off, but at the cost of bringing the Amantoo alliance to the attention of the Denkyirans.

== War with Denkyirans ==

=== Leadup to the war and cause ===
There are many accounts of how the war between the Amantoo and Denkyrians took place. It is generally accepted that the old Denkyriahene, Boamponsem, had died. An in an election to determine the next Denkyriahene Ntim Gyakari, a warrior who was related to Denkyrian royalty, took the throne. However, the accounts of what happened before or after differ.

One account states:&quot;When he came to the throne, it was clear to Osei Tutu that there was scheming against him in the capital of Dankyera. Ntim Gyakari was jealous of him and wished to destroy him and his people. Secret messengers came and went through the forest paths, quietly, bringing news. It became clear to Osei Tutu that he must prepare for war.&quot;
According to another account, the direct cause of the war was a beautiful woman. Boamponsem, out of pride, sent a mission to Osei Tutu composed of his favorite wives. Richly clad and loaded down with jewels, they were accompanied by a magnificent escort of Boamponsem&#x27;s most stalwart warriors as an indirect way to show the beauty of the Denkyrian women in comparison to those of the Amantoo. This royal delegation was received by Osei Tutu with all the honours and courtesy due its rank. He gave the queens rich and extravagant presents and sent them safely back. In reciprocity, Osei Tutu sent Boamponsem an embassy of his most beautiful wives, led by the chief queen, a woman of extraordinary beauty. When this delegation arrived, Boamponsem received its members with due respect, but fell in love at first sight with the beautiful chief queen. Boamponsem was young and handsome, and the attraction was mutual. On her return, Osei Tutu noticed that she was an expectant mother and swore that he would not rest until he had Boamponsem&#x27;s head. Boamponsem offered him a large quantity of gold as the price of peace, but Osei Tutu was adamant. He began mobilizing his army, apparently forgetting that he had once been forced to flee from Denkyria for a similar offense.

Another account that is given for one of the causes of the war is that Osei Tutu had given protection to Oduro Agyensamoo of Assin, a man wanted in Abankeseso for questioning the King of Denkyira about the circumstances of Boa Amponsem&#x27;s death. Most accounts, though, say that Boamponsem was dead by the time, having ruled for around 40 years at that point.

The casus belli most sources agree on for the start of the war was that Ntim Gyakari started to demand higher payments from his tributes, specifically from the Amantoo after hearing of their alliance turn into a union without his consent. He sent ambassadors with a large brass pan and demanded the following:

* That each chief was to cut off one of his fingers and add to the gold dust to be sent to Denkyira.
* That each chief was to send his favorite wife to Denkyira to serve the King&#x27;s court.
* That they should stop opposing the allowance for Denkyiran men who had sex with the young Amantoo women who went to serve at Denkyira, because to the Denkryiran court it was said a blessing for any woman who became pregnant by a Denkyiran man, since she would get a baby with royal blood in him who would be better fit to occupy a stool in Amantoo.
* That they should dissolve their union because they did not seek permission before its formation.
* That they were to send the Sika Dwa Kofi to him because he was the overlord.

Despite the gold dust payments being the demand that the Amantoo could give to the Denkyirans, the demands for the chiefs to dissolve their union and getting their right to speak out against how Denkykiran men could freely impregnate Amantoo women in Denkyria (akin to rape) were a step to far for the Amantoo, as the chiefs had vowed to protect the spirit of the new nation. To cut off a finger was an unforgivable demand and insult as no maimed person was allowed to occupy a stool in the Amantoo Nation, therefore if that King was demanding their fingers, then he was de-stooling them. The demands for the chiefs to give away their favorite wives was a grave disrespect to Amantoo manhood, and the demand for the Sika Dwa Kofi was the straw that broke the camel&#x27;s back.

The chiefs were initially silent in responding to the demands, then the Dwabenhene, Adaakwaa Yiadom, rose up, the new sunsum, or soul, of Amantoo stirring within him condemned the whole message and swore to avenge, following it up by either cutting the ear off of or killing one of the envoys. All the other Chiefs unanimously supported him. They therefore filled the brass basin with stones to be sent to King of Denkyira instead of the gold dust he was demanding.  They ordered executioners to cut the fingers of the messengers from Denkyira and add to the stones and to also kill the warrior among the messengers.  Their action was a declaration of war on Denkyira their overlord.

=== Road to war-Amantoo planning ===
It is said of the ensuing war that the Amantoo, basking in the glory of the previous feat performed by their great priest and Agonahene, Nana Okomfo Anokye in their previous conquest of the Dormaa people, Okomfo Anokye then told the Amantoo to delay the war for a time, as he set up magical defences. After his preparations were complete, he prophesied that victory was certainly provided three men would have to give themselves up as sacrifices for sacrifices. One would be buried alive with his two hands appearing above ground earth and two brass pans full of war medicine mixed in water would be put in the two palms for the warriors to bath before they left for the war front. The second volunteer would be butchered to death and his flesh thrown away for vultures to take to Denkyira land. Wherever any piece of the flesh would fall the men of that place would lose their bravery and become cowards. The third volunteer should be a paramount chief. He would be armed, and he would be in front of the marching soldiers. He was not to fire a shot even if he met an enemy. He should look on for the enemy to shoot him. It was only when he fell that the Amantoo Nation would be victorious. If he did not conform to that and he shot his gun that would spell doom for the Amantoo Nation.

Those who volunteered were:

* Nana Asenso Kofo, Chief of Adwumkasekese who was buried alive.
* Nana Dikopim I, Chief of Edweso, who was to be butchered to death.
* Nana Tweneboa Kodua, Paramount Chief of Kumawu, who was to lead the marching soldiers, though he was armed, he was forbidden to shoot, therefore he was later killed.

After all the purifications and the necessary preparations, Nana Osei Tutu prepared himself to lead the Nation as War General having had good leadership experience from the war against the Dormaa. But Anokye instructed Nana Osei Tutu to stay at Kumase and requested for another to lead the army, explaining that though Amantoo Nation would win the war, whoever led as the War General would not live beyond seven days after the war. Here Nana Boahen Anantuo, Chief of Mampong, volunteered to lead the soldiers to the war. He, however, asked that since he was taking the place of Amantoohene (later renamed Asantehene) as War General, his stool should be next to that of Amantoohene. Amantoohene was occupying the Golden Stool therefore his state should occupy a Silver Stool, a colour second to gold in the Akan, and his request was unanimously granted. Like Boahen Anantuo, the first three volunteers also made requests. Asenso Kofo requested that his after death, nobody from his town, Adwumakasekese, should ever be killed or sacrificed in any form. Dikopim, the Chief of Edweso, requested that nobody from his clan, Asona, should be sacrificed in any form. Nana Tweneboa Kodua also requested that nobody from his state should ever be sacrificed in any form. As a future reminder of the 4 men&#x27;s sacrifices, it is said whenever a drummer from any of the Asante states started drumming on Atumpan drums, his appellation should be sounded to remind future generations that they too should sacrifice themselves for the Asante Nation, encouraging patriotism. Anokye also predicted that the Denkyrians would never make it to Kumase.

Osei Tutu and Anokye also engaged in a propaganda campaign, trying to get Denkyrian commanders to defect. It is said by some accounts that the defecting Denkyrian commanders had a minimal effect on the Denkyrian army at best, but in other accounts, it was around half left Denkyria to go and join the Amantoo, as by most accounts Ntim Gyakari was not a good ruler. It is said that the first town that changed allegiance from Ntim Gyakari to Osei Tutu was the Abooso people. Abooso was a town that lay in the vicinity of Adanse Akrokeri and Abankeseso. The inhabitants of this town were called Bontwumafo - the red clay people. The Denkyirahene made ten classes of men and women. These men and women were there to offer their bodies as a sacrifice to the King whenever a member of the royal family passed on. They were called the red clay people as when they were sacrificed, their blood was used as red clay in painting some parts of the body of the deceased and their bodies were placed in the grave on which the coffin was laid. Ntim Gyakari, known as a womanizer, took an Abooso wife. Then his mother, Akobena Abensua, fell mortally ill. Learning of this, the wife went to Abooso to alert her ‘‘Bontwumafo’’ kin. When news came that the King&#x27;s mother was dead, the Bontwumafo and the inhabitants of the surrounding towns immediately fled to escape being slaughtered in great numbers and sought refuge with Osei Tutu at Kumasi.

When it was clear that the Bontwumafo were welcomed by Osei Tutu, others from Denkyira followed in numbers. Aboabo was a town near the Oda River. The town was inhabited by Denkyirahene&#x27;s shield-bearers (Akyamfuo) and villagers who prospected and panned for gold on the Ofin flats east of Watreso. A conflict arose between the Akyamfuo and the villagers, and during this, the villagers killed some of the shield-bearers. When Ntim Gyakari was told of the matter, he was incensed and summoned the villagers to appear before him. At the meeting the head of the villagers, Owusu Koanyama verbally abused the Occupant of the Bankam Dwa (the Denkyira Stool) saying that the hene&#x27;s servants (the shield-bearers) were ruffians who stole everything from the people. King Ntim Gyakari flew in a rage and ordered that Owusu Koanyama should be killed forthwith together with all his family. This was done on the spot. The villagers and the inhabitants of the towns close to Aboabo escaped to Amantoo. However, some then decided among themselves to return to their home and beg the Denkyriahene to forgive them. Ntim Gyakari was preparing to fight the Amantoo and so he killed them. This scared others in exile from returning to their home.

Others of Ntim Gyakari&#x27;s household servants who also defected were the brothers Akwadan and Nuamoa, the chief hornblowers of the Denkyirahene. They came to Kumase with their golden horns and their large followers. They were resettled at Asuoyeboa (in Kumase) and later brought into Kumasi when Osei Tutu created the Asokwa (also in Kumase) stool for them so that they might act as his traders as well as his hornblowers. Similarly, the Denkyirahene&#x27;s head drummer also fled to Osei Tutu with his sister Boatemaa Twum and many followers. Osei Tutu appointed him as Nkukuwafohene. It is said that several others fled to Amantoo to seek safety from the tyranny of Ntim Gyakari.

The most important of all those who migrated which drastically reduced Ntim Gyakari&#x27;s power and his authority over northern Denkyira was the ‘Inkwayulaes or Nkawie people. Nkawie, 20 miles north of Abankeseso, was the second most important town in the Denkyira Empire. Nkawie was itself a state just like Kumasiman. It was ruled by a lineage that occupied a Stool from which you become the King of Denkyira. Its female stool was also occupied by Denkyirahene’s ‘nieces’, women who were eligible to become the Queenmother of Denkyira. This was to make the enstoolment of Denkyira Kings smoothly after the King&#x27;s death, preventing disputes in the Royal family. This is how a Denkyiran noble by the name of Asenso Kufuor. In 1694, after the death of King Boa Amponsem I, Ntim Gyakari won over Asenso Kufuor in the contest to succeed Boa Amponsem. Boaamponsem however, was not from the Denkyira Royal family but came up to take the Denkyira Stool as he was the famous warrior. So after his death, the Denkyirans gave the Bankam Dwa also called Offin Ba (a child of the River Offin) in turn to Ntim Gyakari, his relative and possible son of Osei Tutu. Ntim Gyakari feared Kufuor may overthrow him and ordered Asenso Kufuor and his sister Adoma to reside at Abankeseso under his personal surveillance. Asenso Kufuor not satisfied with Ntim Gyakari&#x27;s conditions decided to side with Osei tutu and came to Kwaaman. Since he was a royal eligible to become the King of Denkyira, he came with all his subordinate chiefs together with many guns and gold to supply to the Amantoo. Several Denkyira people including royals also followed him.

When all was set, the Chiefs swore to Nana Osei Tutu that they would forever push forward, never would they retreat. They subsequently buried the Chief of Adwumkasekese, Nana Asenso Kofo alive with his two hands appearing above ground, prepared war medicine, mixed it with water, poured it into two brass pans, had the warriors pour it into their palms to bath and rub themselves and then they went to war.

=== Road to war - Denkyrian planning ===
Ntim Gyakari was not staying idle as these events happened. He had his own diviner, who went by the name of Kenyeke. Kenyeke informed Gyakari of the steps that Anokye was taking. Gyakari ordered Kenyeke to do what was necessary to counter Anokye&#x27;s magic. The two diviners (Anokye and Kenyeke) worked against one another to try and get an advantage for their side over the other. At one point it is said that Anokye challenged Kenyeke to undo a knot he had tied in an elephant&#x27;s tusk. Kenyeke returned the favour by challenging Anokye to undo a knot that he had tied in water.

== Amantoo- Denkyrian war ==

=== Stats ===
From the offset of the war, the Amantoo were at a great disadvantage. The Denkyrian soldiers were better equipped than the Amantoo troops, with their gun and ammunition supplies being frequently replenished and craftsmen who could manufacture guns and ammunition, and their troops more experienced in combat than their Amantoo counterparts. Loyalty among the Denkyrians to their Denkyriahene was greater than that to Osei Tutu with his own men. Due to this, Gyakari was confident that he&#x27;d quickly crush the Amantoo uprising.

=== Events of the initial stages of the war ===
Gyakari&#x27;s confidence was quickly confirmed as his army advanced upon the Amantoo army. At the battles of Adunku and Abuontem, Ntim Gyakari managed to force Amantoo militias back, with these three battles resulting in the Denkyrians as the clear victors. At this point, Nana Dikopim I, Chief of Edweso, was killed. This was either by the Denkyrian soldiers killing him or the Amantoo butchering him to death as the planned sacrifice. Later, at the Amantoo city of Aputuogya, the Denkyrians saw the whole Amantoo army for the first time. Gyakari ordered an attack, which lead the Amantoo army to go on a retreat. It is said that the Amantoo retreated under the leadership of the Mamponghene and at the advice of the diviners for miles, always on the back foot but never breaking. This was until the retreating Amantoo army and the advancing Denkyrian army got to the town of Feyasie.

=== Battle of Feyiase ===
At the Amantoo town of Feyiase, the Asante stopped retreating, since if they were to have retreated any further, it would have meant retreating to the Amantoo capital of Kumase. Gyakari, knowing full well that if he was to achieve absolute victory at Feyiase ordered one last final grand assault on the Amantoo forces. However, this was a mistake. For a time, the Amantoo had planned for this, and they then put their plan into action. One legend states that Anokye transformed into a vulture and got a committee of vultures to pick the butchered pieces of Nana Dikopim I and sprinkled the flesh onto the Denkyrian forces. The Vulture Anokye was then to have said to have followed it up by releasing his dropping onto the eyes of Gyakari, greatly or (and most likely) temporarily blinding him. Another story goes that Ankoye managed to finally kill Kenyeke (He was definitely dead by the end of the war). The news of his death so emboldened the Amantoo forces that the Amantoo turned to attack the Denkyrians.

However, most accounts and even the two above have the same result. All of this happened according to Osei Tutu&#x27;s plan. Gyakari and the Denkyrians had significantly and fatally underestimated the Amantoo army both in size and in tactics, just as Osei Tutu had planned. He had sent out Amantoo scouts to skirmish with the Denkyrians at Adunku and Abuontem to make them believe that they were Amantoo militias. The &quot;whole Amantoo army&quot; the Denkyrians had encountered at Aputuogya were actually the forward guard and main body. The Denkyrians had not been pushing the Amantoo back, but reeling them in.

The wings of the Amantoo army, who had been lying in wait in Feyiase, rose from their hiding spaces and poured onto the battlefield. The Denkyrian commanders, seeing the advancing troops of their enemies, attempted to reposition their forces to fight the advancing wings. The forward guard then turned and slammed into the disorganized Denkyrian lines, commencing a brutal assault on the Denkyrian front. This caused the Denkyrians to once again attempt a reorganization of their troops to fight the Amantoo forward guard. However, at this, the wings of the Amantoo army fully encircle the Denkyrian army. This allowed the Amantoo to attack from all sides and to deny the Denkyrians any means of escape. The battle turned into a massacre. Most of the Denkyrian forces were killed. Some were captured and sold into slavery. Those who surrendered were conscripted into the Amantoo army. Only a few managed to successfully flee back to Denkyrian lands.

Among those captured or, in some interpretations, killed was Ntim Gyakari. The Dwaben Asafo (the Dwaben part of the Amantoo army headed by the Dwabenhene himself) found Gyakari playing golden oware with his wife, blissfully unaware of what was happening on the battlefield due to absolute belief that the Denkyrians would win over the Amantoo. There are many ways stated for how Ntim died. One source says that after him trying to resist his capture, in which the Dwabenhene himself attacked and subdued Gyakari, they captured him and brought him to Osei Tutu, his possible father but the two did not know they were even possibly related. Gyakari&#x27;s only wish bravely requested that he be executed publicly in front of Osei Tutu himself. His wish was granted. After gulping down a gourd (bottle) of palm wine, King Gyakari of his own volition laid his neck on the executioner&#x27;s stone to be executed. Other sources state that either the Dwaben Asafo or the Dwabenhene himself killed and beheaded Ntim on the spot. One source states that a man called Adakwayiadom, a Dwaben man, stabbed Ntim to death, the first stab denting a golden bangle Ntim was wearing. This gold bangle would become a point of disagreement between the Dwabenhene and Osei Tutu. His last words are also debated as some sources do not state Ntim&#x27;s last words, while some say they were &quot;esa nti&quot;, meamimg &quot;because of war&quot;. He would have said this because it was because of war with the Denkyiras that the Akan city-states that would form the Asante Union joined. After his execution, his body was divided into three more parts: his head was given to the Amantoohene, but the Osei Tutu got a gold cast of his face and gifted it to the Dwabenhene either as a reward for capturing Gyakari, or because the Dwabenhene and Osei had argued over who got Ntim&#x27;s head and due to Tutu not wanting infighting among the Amantoo he made a gold mask of Ntim&#x27;s face and gave it to the Dwaben, his left-leg bone to Asumegya, right-leg bone to Mampong, the vertebrae to Aduaben.

== Becoming the Asante confederacy, contact with the Europeans and expanding territory ==

=== Aftermath of the war ===
With the Denkyrian army evaporated, the Denkyrian territories were left undefended and exposed. What happened next varies from telling to telling. What is clear is that the Amantoo, Adanse and Twifo descended upon the Denkyrian lands with no mercy, carving out territories for themselves. The lion&#x27;s share, though, was taken by the Amantoo. Osei Tutu divided the territory among his supporters, with the people of Asumegya founding the villages of Dominase and Agyemasu, and Osei Tutu resettling the Bontwumafo in Atwima (now Atwima Mponua and Atwima Nwabiagya Districts) and their leader was made the Atwimahene.

How the Amantoo eventually descended onto either Abankesesso or (possibly) the new capital of Entuam is unclear. Most retellings state that the Amantoo forces descended on the capital of Denkyriaman, Abankesesso, straight after the war&#x27;s end. Here, the Amantoo forces ransacked Abankesesso for all of its worth, with even the working class of Abankesesso being stripped of anything of worth. Other sources say that after the war, there was a lull in hostilities for a year, until the Amantoo heard that Boadu Akufu, the new Denkyriahene, was making preparations for reprisals. Under Anokye&#x27;s prediction that stated that the Asante would crush the uprising, the Amantoo army marched south, encamped close to Entuam and bribed those in Entuam to hand over Boadu, which was a success. Boadu was later executed. It is then said that the Denkyrians were so disheartened at losing Bodu that they fled across the River Ofin, leaving the Amantoo to plunder and destroy Entuam. One thing is clear, however. The Denkyrians were completely ransacked by the war&#x27;s end in 1707, with vast amounts of war treasure being brought back to Kumase. It is said that the period of plundering went on for 15 consecutive days, with the body of Boamponsem being exhumed, the flesh being removed to feed to serpents and snakes, and his skull and thigh bones being carried off as war trophies, as well as three small cannons gifted to Gyakari by the Dutch East India Company to fight the Amantoo. Denkyria would henceforth be under Amantoo influence, with sizeable contingents of military police frequently patrolling the territory of the once great Akan state to ensure the locals felt Amantoo influence. The Denkyrians would never again rise to be the most prominent of the Akan states. In honour of their victory over the Denkyrians, having finally fulfilled the wishes of Oti Akenten and Obiri Yeboa and either due to Gyakari&#x27;s last words or from the old Amantoo state name of Asantemansu, the Amantoo renamed themselves Asanteman: The Asante empire.

=== Akim ===
The Akim were the only Akan state to outwardly side with the Denkyrians against the Asante so not only shared in the losses, but also brought down upon themselves the wrath of the Asante. 2 years after dealing with the Denkyrian army, the Asante military moved on Akim and gained such a decisive victory that the Akim sued for peace. It was granted on the condition that Akim became feudatory to the Asante and paid 2,000 benda&#x27;s of gold to the Asante (between £887,471- £1,002,079 in 2023 money) as war indemnity. Two Akim chiefs, Kakramsi and Ajumako, &quot;took fetish&quot; and were handed over to the Asante as security for the sum before the Asante army withdrew to Kumase.

== Death ==
In 1717, Osei Tutu was killed in a war against the Akyem. At the onset of the struggle, he had underestimated the Akyem because they were few in number, going into battle without his usual &quot;magical amulets&quot;, and even leaving some of his body armour back at Kumasi, his capital. One day, as he was crossing River Pra in a canoe, he was struck by bullets from snipers and sharpshooters, who were hiding in the dense treeline. Asantehene Osei Tutu I died minutes after being shot. His last words were &quot;Ankah me nim a&quot; (If only I knew), an apparent reference to his having underestimated the Akyem.

Until the present day, the occupant of the Golden Stool is forbidden to cross the River Pra.

== Legacy ==
Osei Kofi Tutu I and his adviser, Okomfo Anokye, forged the Asante Union from a number of different &quot;Abusua&quot; groups who submerged their old rivalries and hatred for the common good—the overthrow of their common oppressor, the Denkyira. Skillfully utilizing a combination of spiritual dogma and political skill, and ably supported by military prowess, he tripled the size of the small kingdom of Kumasi which he had inherited from his uncle Obiri Yeboa and laid the foundation for the Empire of Ashanti in the process.

A shrine in Anyinam commemorates the birth of Osei Tutu. The village chief told historian Gus Casely-Hayford regarding Osei Tutu: &quot;He was more than a man, he was our messiah, brave, intelligent, someone who through almost force of will forged this country. He built a culture, it did not evolve; it was made by a great man.&quot;

<doc id="841045" wikidata="Q2332772" url="?curid=841045" title="Star hopping">
<text>Star hopping is a technique that amateur astronomers often use to locate astronomical objects in the night sky. It can be used instead of or in addition to setting circles or go-to/push-to systems.

==The problem==
Many celestial objects of interest are too faint to be visible to the unaided eye. Telescopes or binoculars collect much more light, making faint objects visible, but have a smaller field of view, thus complicating orientation on the sky. 

The field of view of binoculars is rarely more than eight degrees, while that of typical amateur telescopes may be substantially less than one degree, depending on the magnification used. Many objects are best observed using higher magnifications, which inevitably go along with narrow fields of view.
==The technique==
Star hopping uses bright stars as a guide to finding fainter objects. A knowledge of the relative positions of bright stars and target objects is essential. After planning the star hop with the aid of a star chart, the observer first locates one or more bright stars in a finderscope, reflex sight, or, at a low magnification, with the instrument to be used for observation. The instrument is then moved by one or more increments, possibly using a reticle to identify specific angular distances, to follow identified patterns of stars in the sky, until the target object is reached.

Using a telescope equipped with a properly aligned equatorial mount, the observer may also follow the equatorial coordinate system on a star map to &quot;hop&quot; or &quot;slide&quot; along the lines of right ascension or declination from a well known object to find a target. This can be assisted using setting circles.

Once an instrument is centered on the target object, higher magnifications may be used for observation.

==Example==

A simple example of star hopping would be finding Messier 13, a globular cluster in the constellation Hercules, which is too faint to be seen by the unaided eye under most conditions. As shown on the star chart, M 13 lies on a line connecting the stars ζ Herculis and η Herculis. Using star hopping techniques an observer would first identify these two by the naked eye and then point an instrument (binocular or telescope) two thirds of the way up from ζ, one third down from η to see M 13. An observer using a telescope equipped with an equatorial mount would pan down from η in declination to site M 13.

<text>A demitasse (; French: &quot;half cup&quot;), demi-tasse, or espresso cup is a small cup used to serve espresso. It may also refer to the coffee served in such a cup, though that usage had disappeared in France by the early 20th century.

A demitasse typically has a capacity of approximately , half the size of a full coffee cup (a &quot;tasse à café&quot; is about ). The Italian Espresso National Institute recommends serving espresso in a white china cup holding 50−100 ml. They are typically ceramic and accompanied by matching saucers, but some coffeehouses and china companies also produce brightly decorated varieties. Another type of demitasse has a glass cup set into a metal cup-holder frame, called a zarf in Turkey.

Demitasse cups are small because they usually serve espresso, which is a stronger, more concentrated coffee, best served in smaller portions. 

Demitasse cup size is also used for drinking Turkish coffee.

<text>A conclavist was a personal aide of a cardinal present in a papal conclave. The term is sometimes used to refer to all present with a conclave, including the cardinal-electors, but is more properly applied only to the non-cardinals. Conclavists played an important historical role in the negotiations of papal elections and in the evolution of secrecy (or the lack thereof), writing many of the extant accounts of papal elections.

Three popes have been elected from former conclavists, including Pope Pius VI (a conclavist in the 1740 conclave). Other conclavists have later been elevated to the cardinalate, such as Pierre Guérin de Tencin (1721), Niccolò Coscia (1724), Christoph Anton Migazzi (1740), and Carlo Confalonieri (1922).

Pope Paul VI in effect eliminated the role of the historical conclavist by banning private aides and creating a common support staff.

==Background==
The participation of the laity in the election of a pope predates the creation of the papal conclave, with different degrees of involvement characterizing papal selection before 1059. The concept of papal elections as an exclusive event dates to the use of the Basilica of St. John Lateran, which was too small to accommodate &quot;the whole people&quot;, as the site of papal elections during the Byzantine Papacy (537–752). The modern conception of the papal election as the exclusive provenance of the College of Cardinals dates to Pope Nicholas II&#x27;s 1059 bull &quot;In Nomine Domini&quot;, which limited suffrage to the cardinal-bishops.

The word &quot;conclavist&quot; comes from &quot;conclave&quot; (derived from the Latin &quot;cum clave&quot;, meaning &quot;with a key&quot;), which evolved during the thirteenth century, being formalized by Pope Gregory X&#x27;s &quot;Ubi periculum&quot; in 1274, promulgated during the Second Council of Lyon. The procedure of locking in the papal elections was intermittently used until, and exclusively used after, 1294. The norms on the number and type of individuals that could accompany them varied from conclave to conclave until the mid fifteenth century, when the role of the conclavist &quot;had become defined&quot;.

==History==

===From the 15th century===
From the mid-fifteenth century, cardinals were permitted only one conclavist each, usually a servant. This man servant served as a secretary and confidant to his cardinal master, and an intermediary between the cardinals. Many cardinals preferred to delegate the negotiation of &quot;promises of favors&quot; to their conclavist, which &quot;played so major a role in papal elections for the next three centuries&quot;. Clandestine meetings between conclavists were often influential on the outcome of the conclave. According to Baumgartner, &quot;talented conclavists could achieve a great deal for their masters, but because so much of what they did was behind the scenes, it is difficult to assess accurately their place in the elections, although many conclavists wrote diaries and memoirs detailing the events of the conclaves and their roles&quot;.

The allowable number of conclavists was increased by two by the time of the 1484 conclave and these were housed above the cells of the cardinal electors, all of whom could be housed in the same chapel due to their small number. Limitations on the number of conclavists were often viewed as only a suggestion: during the conclave of 1549–50, when cardinals were limited to two conclavists, some had three or more, and one snapshot of the occupants of the conclave suggests an average of seven conclavists per cardinal. Attempts to reduce the total number of people in the conclave—including many ambassadors and foreign agents—proved unsuccessful. The number of the conclavists ensured that the various bookmakers of Rome were well-informed, streamlining the practice of gambling on papal elections.

Conclavists were compensated for the inconvenience of being locked in the conclave by the ransacking of the furnishings of the cell of the newly elected pope and by the expectation of money and benefices.

===From Pius IV===

A frequent choice of conclavist was the brother or nephew of the cardinal elector, until Pope Pius IV (1559–1565) banned this practice. Pius IV issued an apostolic constitution on the subject of conclavists; he limited cardinals to two conclavists, except for princes and the most senior cardinals, whom he permitted three. In addition to the restriction on relatives, Pius IV required that the conclavist have been in the service of the cardinal for at least one year prior to the conclave. He also decreed that the conclavists collectively be paid 10,000 crowns from the papal treasury and 2,000 more from vacant benefices. He banned the practice of sacking the cell of the elected pope, but the practice continued nonetheless.

A document from the seventeenth century entitled &quot;Advice for the Conclavist&quot; describes the duties and rewards of the practice: conclavists were expected to care for the physical needs of the cardinal elector (e.g. making his bed and warming his food), gather information, spread disinformation, carry a heavy purse for distributing funds to minor conclave servants in exchange for information, possess wine and food in his cell for entertaining, and carry disguises for himself and his boss so they could move from cell to cell unrecognized.

The erudite abbot Felice Gualterio, of the noble family from Orvieto and younger brother of the conclavist Sebastiano Gualterio, in his treatise &quot;The Conclavist&quot; underscores that sentiment: &quot;I wish my conclavist would transform himself, if it were possible, into the nature of a chameleon, as this animal takes on the quality of the colours of all things which he comes near to and so, speaking and dealing with humans, he would be able to satisfy everyone&#x27;s nature&quot;.

Unlike a cardinal, who—in the case of illness, certified under oath by a physician—may leave a conclave, a conclavist cannot. In 1621, forty conclavists died during the conclave (along with eight cardinals) due to a bout of malaria. Two conclavists were forcibly ejected from the 1829 conclave on March 15 for being agents of Austria. During the papal conclave, 1878 (the first in the Vatican since 1775) a common kitchen was used from meals and cardinals were barred from receiving food from the outside; as this reduced the chances for communicating with the outside world during meals, the cardinals began objecting to eating with the conclavists and staff and were given a separate table.

Throughout history, conclavists have almost exclusively been men; however, during the conclave of 1939, Cardinal Pacelli (who was elected Pope Pius XII) was allowed to bring several German nuns, including Pascalina Lehnert, into &quot;Cell No. 13&quot; as his conclavists.

Anecdotal accounts have often blamed conclavists for the breach of secrecy in papal elections. For example, after the 1903 conclave, before the election of Giuseppe Sarto as Pope Pius X was announced, several conclavists apparently attempted to signal his election from the window by &quot;imitating the sewing motions of a tailor, &quot;sarto&quot; in Italian&quot;. The papal conclave, 1963 was the first swept for listening devices, and there are contradictory accounts of a conclavist using a small radio to alert the CIA (or, alternatively, the Vatican Radio) of the results of the election before flushing the device down the toilet.

===From Paul VI===
Pope Paul VI (1963–1978) reformed the rules of the conclave in an attempt to enforce secrecy; he replaced the allowance of two conclavists per cardinal with a set of common secretaries and servants. Paul VI&#x27;s reforms in effect eliminated the conclavists, increasing the space available for the rapidly expanding size of the College of Cardinals (the common secretaries and servants numbered about seventy in the two 1978 papal conclaves). Since the reign of Paul VI, the only non-cardinals present in conclave after the pronunciation of &quot;Extra omnes&quot; (&quot;everyone out&quot;) by the master of papal liturgical celebrations are the master himself and the priest chosen to give a homily on the subject of electing the pope, and even they depart after the homily.

==Other notable conclavists==
The following conclavists have written notable historical accounts of conclaves:
*Pietro Paolo Gualtieri of Arezzo, conclavist to Bernardino Maffei during the conclave of 1549–1550
*Sebastiano Gualterio, bishop of Viterbo, of the noble family from Orvieto (also spelled &quot;Gualtieri&quot;, but not related to Pietro Paolo Gualtieri), conclavist to Alessandro Farnese during the conclave of 1549–1550
*Angelo Massarelli, conclavist to Cardinal Cervini during the conclave of 1549–1550
*Antonio Maria di Savoia di Collegno, conclavist to Cristoforo Madruzzo during the conclave of 1549–1550
*Pedro de Toledo, conclavist and brother to Juan Álvarez de Toledo during the conclave of 1549–1550

<doc id="841054" wikidata="Q881045" url="?curid=841054" title="Jim Folsom">
<text>James Elisha Folsom Sr. (October 9, 1908 – November 21, 1987), commonly known as Jim Folsom or Big Jim Folsom, was an American politician who served as the 42nd governor of the U.S. state of Alabama, having served from 1947 to 1951, and again from 1955 to 1959. He was the first Governor of Alabama born in the 20th century.

==Early life==
Born in Coffee County, Alabama, in 1908, Folsom was of English ancestry.

Before serving in the United States Army and United States Merchant Marine during World War II, Folsom had been an insurance salesman. He attended the University of Alabama, Samford University in Birmingham, and George Washington University in Washington, D.C., but he never obtained a college degree.

Before his gubernatorial campaigns, he won a race only once as a delegate to the 1944 Democratic National Convention. He was a strong supporter of keeping U.S. Vice President Henry A. Wallace on the ticket, rather than replacing him with Harry S. Truman of Missouri, which occurred.

==Governor==

Folsom was elected governor for the first time in 1946 on a New Deal liberal platform attacking corporate interests and the wealthy. He waged a colorful campaign with a hillbilly band, brandishing a mop and bucket that he said would &quot;clean out&quot; the Capitol. His opponent, Handy Ellis, attacked Folsom by saying his election would threaten segregation laws and encourage &quot;communist-backed labor unions&quot;.

Historian Dan T. Carter summarized Folsom&#x27;s democratic ideals thus: &quot;(T)he three pillars of a democratic society were the Bill of Rights, an activist and compassionate government, and an absolute and unqualified democracy.&quot; Folsom warned voters that, in the wake of World War II, which he said was fought &quot;against hatred and violence,&quot; those sought to use mischaracterizations of political ideas to divide &quot;race and race, class and class ... religion and religion.&quot;

Folsom was among the first Southern governors to advocate a moderate position on racial integration and improvement of civil rights for African Americans. In his Christmas message on December 25, 1949, he said, &quot;As long as the Negroes are held down by deprivation and lack of opportunity, the other poor people will be held down alongside them.&quot;

On March 3, 1948, Folsom&#x27;s name was in headlines across the nation when the 30-year-old Christine Putman Johnston, who had met Folsom in late 1944 while she was working as a cashier at the Tutwiler Hotel in Birmingham, filed a paternity suit against the governor by alleging that he was the father of her 22-month-old son. Undaunted, nine days after the suit was filed Folsom appeared on the sidewalk in front of the Barbizon Modeling School in New York City, where he kissed a hundred pretty models who had voted him &quot;The Nation&#x27;s Number One Leap Year Bachelor,&quot; attracting a crowd of 2500 onlookers and causing a traffic jam. The kissing stunt made national news but did nothing to stop the political damage being done by the suit. When the paternity suit broke, Folsom was challenging president Truman for the Democratic nomination for President. Because of the negative publicity surrounding the suit, Folsom lost his bid to represent Alabama as a favorite son candidate for president in an election held on May 4, 1948. On May 5, 1948, without prior publicity, Folsom married the 20-year-old Jamelle Moore, a secretary at the state Highway Department, whom he had met during his 1946 campaign and had been dating and seeing &quot;almost daily&quot; since then. Johnston subsequently dropped the suit in June for a cash settlement from Folsom; years later, he admitted to an interviewer that he was indeed the father of Johnston&#x27;s child.

However, despite the paternity suit and other scandals during his administration, he was easily elected to a second non-consecutive term in 1954. During his campaign, Folsom denounced the Ku Klux Klan and promised free textbooks for children. As noted by one study, Folsom brought to power &quot;a legislative slate that gave him a working majority in both the House and Senate.&quot; The Alabama Constitution then forbade a governor from succeeding himself, a common provision in other southern states at the time. Folsom was tall and employed the slogan &quot;the little man&#x27;s big friend.&quot;

In 1958, Folsom commuted a death sentence imposed on James E. Wilson, an African American sentenced to death for a violent robbery. The Wilson case sparked international protests, but some segregationists called for Folsom not to commute the sentence. Folsom opposed capital punishment, stating that he would always grant clemency in death penalty cases &quot;if I can find some excuse.&quot; He regularly paroled and pardoned black convicts, believing they had been unjustly convicted or punished due to their race. However, Folsom did not intervene in another controversial case; Jeremiah Reeves was electrocuted the same year, which also sparked protests. He later confessed that his silence was solely due to political reasons. Folsom said he &quot;just couldn&#x27;t&quot; commute the death sentence of a black man who had been convicted of raping a white woman, since it would destroy him politically.&quot;I&#x27;d never get anything done for the rest of my term if I did that. Hell, things are getting so bad, they&#x27;re even trying to take Black &amp; White Scotch off the shelves.&quot;

A wide range of reforms were carried out during Folsom&#x27;s two terms as governor. An indigent care bill for hospitalization was passed, while unemployment compensation was stepped up.

During Folsom&#x27;s first term, an Act was introduced in 1947 that provided for various employers to provide policies of hospitalization, accident, health and life insurance for the benefit of officers and employees. An Act of September 1947 raised the minimum age of employment of children from 14 to 16 for all occupations during school hours, &quot;except in agriculture and domestic service, and for work in manufacturing establishments or canneries at any time.&quot; The Act also reduced the maximum workweek for children from 48 to 40 hours. Another Act from that same month provided for the establishment of a second injury fund &quot;financed by payment by employer of $500 in death cases where there are no dependents.&quot; In 1949 coal mine safety legislation was signed into law. An Act of June 1949 related to workmen&#x27;s compensation introduced various changes such as the provision of full benefits for 550 weeks, instead of reduced benefits for weeks after 400, &quot;in permanent total disability resulting from loss of both eyes or both arms, paralysis, or mental incapacity.&quot; An Act of July 1949 increased from 25% to 35% of employee&#x27;s weekly the death benefit payable to a dependent widower.

A diluted sales tax exemption repeal was also carried out, with tax exemptions on alcoholic beverages, cigarettes, and stock withdrawn for private use by retail store owners, while revenue was provided for 4 trade schools. An REA loan for an electric cooperative was also secured, while schoolteacher&#x27;s salaries were raised. Hundreds of new school buildings were also constructed, while a 9-month school term was introduced. Improvements were also made in public health; helped by the passage of laws in 1947 that provided for TB examination and blood-testing. A farm-to-market roads program improved rural life while the establishment of an industrial development commission pleased business, while funding for health, welfare, education and old-age pensions was increased. During his first term, for instance, as noted by one study, &quot;When adopted by both houses, the 1947-49 biennial budget included the promised $5.5 million appropriation for old age pensions and represented an increase of approximately $50 million over the appropriations for the preceding biennium.&quot; In addition, Fiscal 1947– 48 was the biggest year on record for the Department of Public Welfare. Increased state appropriations and federal matching funds provided $6 million more than the department had spent in fiscal 1946–47, and for pensioners the department was able to increase the average monthly check from $15.08 to $21.14 between June 1947 and June 1948, while enlarging its eligibility rolls from 27,000 to over 65,000 retired Alabamians. According to one study, Folsom had supported the “largest appropriation of funds for public education in Alabama history.”

Further reforms were carried out during Folsom&#x27;s second term as governor. An Act of 1955 provided for the education of exceptional children, while another Act passed that same year provided for slum clearance and prevention along with the building of good homes. An Act of 1957 provided for a hospital service program for certain needy persons unable to pay for the hospitalization they need. An Act of August 1957 raised from 60% to 75% &quot;the amount of wages of a resident worker exempt from garnishment.&quot; An Act from that same month specified (in relation to workmen&#x27;s compensation) &quot;that in lump-sum payments, which are permitted with court approval, the court must be satisfied that such payment is in the best interest of the employee or his dependents.&quot; Another Act from August 1957 raised maximum medical benefits from $1,00 to $1,200, and extended the maximum period from 90 days to 6 months. Further Acts introduced in 1957 provided for supplementary benefits for certain municipal employees, old age assistance for various teachers, retirement supplements for particular state employees, and a State scholarship program for black nurses. The Relative Responsibility Act (under which elderly pensioners were ineligible for help if assistance could be provided by immediate relatives) was also repealed.

==Unsuccessful races==
In 1962, Folsom again ran for governor against his one-time protégé George C. Wallace but was defeated. A sardonic slogan that referred to Folsom&#x27;s reputation for taking graft emerged during that campaign: &quot;Something for everyone and a little bit for Big Jim.&quot; Folsom sometimes referred to &quot;the emoluments of office&quot; and once told a campaign crowd, &quot;I plead guilty to stealing. That crowd I got it from, you had to steal it to get it... I stole for you, and you, and you.&quot;

Folsom&#x27;s campaign was also damaged by a television appearance in which he appeared seriously intoxicated and unable to remember his children&#x27;s names. Both the appearance and the supposed &quot;slogan&quot; hurt him with the image-conscious middle class.

Folsom ran again for governor in 1966 and faced three other leading Democrats in the primary, former US Representative Carl Elliott, former Governor John Malcolm Patterson, and Attorney General Richmond Flowers Sr. However, the primary winner was none of those candidates but the surrogate for the outgoing Governor George Wallace: his first wife, Lurleen Burns Wallace. In the general election, Lurleen handily defeated the Republican nominee, James D. Martin, a one-term US representative from Gadsden.
Folsom would continue to run for governor in 1970, 1974, 1978, and 1982, but he was never taken seriously by his opponents. In the 1970 gubernatorial race, Folsom expressed opposition to the Vietnam War, high taxes and race against race politics stating “I&#x27;m the first and the last Governor the little man, the young people and the blacks ever had in Alabama.”

==Later life==
Folsom was plagued by ill health in the last years of his life. A 1976 article in People magazine reported that he was legally blind, with only 5% vision, and nearly deaf.

Folsom died in 1987 in Cullman.

== In pop culture ==
A documentary film about Folsom &quot;Big Jim Folsom: The Two Faces of Populism&quot; , was produced in 1996 by the Alabama filmmaker Robert Clem and won the 1997 International Documentary Association/ABCNews VideoSource Award and the Southeastern Filmmaker Award at the 1997 Atlanta Film Festival.

In the 1997 TNT film &quot;George Wallace&quot;, directed by John Frankenheimer, Jim Folsom is played by Joe Don Baker, who was nominated for a CableACE award for his performance. Gary Sinise played Wallace.

== Personal life ==
Folsom married teacher and social welfare worker Sarah Carnley in 1936. She died in 1944 at age 36 due to pregnancy complications.

In 1948, Christine Putman Johnston filed suit requesting legal recognition of her and Folsom&#x27;s common-law marriage, and his paternity of her 22-month-old son, James Douglas. Johnston did not request financial compensation in the suit. Folsom settled the suit, and later admitted that he was the child&#x27;s father. Johnston died at age 33 in 1951.

In 1948, Folsom eloped with his second wife, Jamelle Folsom, nee Jamelle Moore. They had met in 1946 when she was 17 years old, and remained married until his death.

Folsom had ten children: two by his first wife, Sarah; one by Christine Putman Johnston; and seven by his second wife, Jamelle.

Folsom&#x27;s son James E. Folsom Jr.—dubbed &quot;Little Jim,&quot; though physically large, because of his father&#x27;s nickname—is also a noted Alabama politician. He served as lieutenant governor of Alabama from 1987 to 1993. He assumed the governor&#x27;s office when Republican Governor Guy Hunt convicted of state ethics law violations and removed from office. Folsom, Jr. ran for a full term as governor in 1994, but was defeated by Republican former Governor Fob James. Folsom, Jr. decided to re-enter state politics in 2006, qualified, and eventually won the lieutenant governor&#x27;s position again; he served from 2007 to 2011.

Folsom&#x27;s niece, Cornelia Wallace, the daughter of his sister, Ruby Folsom Ellis, was from 1971 to 1978 the second wife of his former rival, George Wallace.

<doc id="841057" wikidata="Q8051883" url="?curid=841057" title="Yellow grease">
<text>Yellow grease, also termed used cooking oil (UCO), used vegetable oil (UVO), recycled vegetable oil, or waste vegetable oil (WVO), is recovered from businesses and industry that use the oil for cooking.

It is used to feed livestock, and to manufacture soap, make-up, clothes, rubber, and detergents. Due to competition from these other industrial sectors, the EIA estimates that less than a third of yellow grease could be spared for biodiesel production annually.

It is distinct from brown grease; yellow grease is typically used frying oils from deep fryers, whereas brown grease is sourced from grease interceptors.

== Market and use ==
The global used cooking oil market was 5.16 billion USD in 2020 and expected to grow at 7.76% CAGR to reach 10.08 billion USD in 2028.

The market for biodiesel/renewable diesel has reached 2.8 billion gallons with more than 3 billion gallons online today. Expectations are for 6 billion gallons by 2030.

== Oil collectors ==

The industry which collects and renders yellow grease to make refined used cooking oil is dominated by a number of very large companies.

No reliable statistics exist on the number of smaller to mid-size companies who collect yellow grease and either sell or render it to produce refined used cooking oil. Estimates run to a couple of hundred. Even so, theft is common and many “companies” may remain unregistered. 

This formerly Mom and Pop industry, the collection of used cooking oil, has grown to the point where fleets of trucks, regional and nationwide coverage and large processing plants are commonplace and consulting groups and software companies play an increasingly prominent role. Automated collection and storage systems for used cooking oil are rising dramatically. 

ERP (enterprise resource planning) Management software, route optimization tools, fill rate tracking, CRM (customer relationship management) and automated contracts are becoming the norm and a prerequisite for UCO collectors (greasers) to manage rapid growth in the collection of used cooking oil.

In the UK, waste cooking oil collection is governed by the Environment Agency. All collections need to be carried out by a company registered as a waste carrier by the Environment Agency. On each collection a waste transfer note needs to the filled out and copies held by both parties for a minimum of 3 years. Waste transfer notes can be hard paper copies or electronic versions. Here is an example of a waste transfer note currently in use by a UK waste cooking oil company.

== Oil renderers ==
The recycling of waste cooking oil (aka restaurant grease, used cooking oil or yellow grease) is a process known as “rendering”. During the rendering process fatty acid is separated from the moisture, the solids and any impurities that are present in the waste cooking oil. The rendering of waste cooking oil produces one usable element and several waste elements.

Some collectors do their own rendering while others may sell their grease for a lower price to a company with the space and equipment to do so.

Refined used cooking oil is what is left after separation of solids and moisture from yellow grease. Refined used cooking oil is the base for producing biodiesel and renewable diesel. 

Refined used cooking oil then goes through either to transesterification to produce biodiesel or hydrodeoxygenation to produce renewable diesel.

<doc id="841060" wikidata="Q851717" url="?curid=841060" title="The Princeton Review">
<text>The Princeton Review is an education services company providing tutoring, test preparation and admission resources for students. It was founded in 1981, and since that time has worked with over 400 million students. Services are delivered by 4,000+ tutors and teachers in the United States, Canada and international offices in 21 countries.; online resources; more than 150 print and digital books published by Penguin Random House; and dozens of categories of school rankings. The Princeton Review&#x27;s affiliate division, Tutor.com, provides online tutoring services. The Princeton Review is headquartered in New York City and is privately held. The Princeton Review is not associated with Princeton University.

== Corporate history ==
The Princeton Review was founded in 1981 by John Katzman, who—shortly after graduating from Princeton University—began tutoring students for the SAT from his Upper West Side apartment. A short time later, Katzman teamed up with Adam Robinson, an Oxford-trained SAT tutor who had developed a series of techniques for &quot;cracking the system.&quot; Katzman built the Princeton Review into a national and then international operation and was CEO until 2007, when he was replaced by Michael Perik.

In March 2010, Perik resigned and was replaced by John M. Connolly. In April 2010, the company sold $48 million in stock for $3 per share, and a short time later was accused of fraud in a class action suit filed by a Michigan retirement fund, which claimed The Princeton Review leadership exaggerated earnings to boost its stock price. In 2012, the company was acquired by Charlesbank Capital, a private equity fund, for $33 million. On August 1, 2014, the Princeton Review brand name and operations were bought for an undisclosed sum by Tutor.com, an IAC company, and Mandy Ginsburg became CEO. The company is no longer affiliated with its former parent, Education Holdings 1, Inc. On March 31, 2017, ST Unitas acquired The Princeton Review for an undisclosed sum. In January 2022, Primavera Capital Group acquired The Princeton Review and Tutor.com from ST Unitas.

== Criticisms ==

===General===
Test preparation providers have been criticized in the past on the grounds that their courses claim larger score increases than they deliver.

===Ranking schools===
College rankings, including those published by the Princeton Review, have been criticized for failing to be accurate or comprehensive by assigning objective rankings formed from subjective opinions. Princeton Review officials counter that their rankings are unique in that they rely on student opinion and not just on statistical data.

In 2002 an American Medical Association affiliated program, A Matter of Degree, funded by the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation, criticized the Princeton Review list of Best Party Schools. &quot;USA Today&quot; published an editorial titled &quot;Sobering Statistics&quot; in August 2002 and stated, &quot;the doctor&#x27;s group goes too far in suggesting that the rankings contribute to the problem (of campus drinking).&quot; The editorial noted the fact that among the schools the AMA program was then funding as part of its campaign against campus drinking, six of 10 of those schools calling for The Princeton Review to &quot;drop the annual ranking...had made (Princeton Review&#x27;s) past top-party-school lists: many times for some. That&#x27;s no coincidence.&quot; The editorial commended The Princeton Review for reporting the list, calling it &quot;a public service&quot; for &quot;student applicants and their parents&quot;.

The Princeton Review rankings for LGBT-related lists were criticized in 2010 by a ranking competitor in &quot;The Advocate&quot; magazine as inaccurate due to outdated methodologies. The Princeton Review has always based its &quot;LGBTQ-Friendly&quot; and &quot;LGBTQ-Unfriendly&quot; top twenty ranking lists on its tri-annual surveys of students at colleges profiled in the company&#x27;s &quot;Best Colleges&quot; book which asks undergraduates: &quot;Do students, faculty, and administrators at your college treat all persons equally regardless of their sexual orientations and gender identify/expression?&quot; The Princeton Review also publishes &quot;The Gay &amp; Lesbian Guide to College Life (2007)&quot;. It has been available as an eBook since 2011.

===Privacy concerns===
In 2016, the company was criticized by privacy rights advocates concerned that a company that owns online dating and college preparation services could amass data and exploit it in a way that preys on unsuspecting consumers, particularly younger people. &quot;Do parents know that when their underage kids enroll for exam prep or tutoring, personal information may be shared with hookup sites that could then target their kids to become customers?&quot; asked the critic, who concluded that the company &quot;makes no guarantee that data sharing among its entities will not include those customers whose sole aim is to improve their grades and test scores.&quot; Indeed, another critic points out that The Princeton Review &quot;policy states &#x27;we may collect certain information from your computer each time you visit our site&#x27;—information like data &#x27;regarding your academic and extracurricular activities and interests.&#x27; That information can be used to &#x27;send you email notices and offers; perform research and analysis about your use of or interest in our products, services or products or services offered by others; [and] develop and display content and advertising tailored to your interests on our site and other sites.

No evidence was ever presented that IAC, which owned The Princeton Review when these criticisms were made, used data gathered by The Princeton Review to promote IAC company dating services to younger people.

<text>George Chauncey Sparks (October 8, 1884 – November 6, 1968), known as Chauncey Sparks, was an attorney and Democratic American politician who served as the 41st Governor of Alabama from 1943 to 1947. He improved the state education of whites and expanded the state schools and centers for agriculture. He campaigned for passage of the Boswell Amendment to the state constitution, which was designed to keep blacks disfranchised following the US Supreme Court ruling &quot;Smith v. Allwright&quot; (1944) against the use of white primaries by the Democratic Party in the states.

Under the state constitution, Alabama governors could not serve consecutive terms at the time, so Sparks left office without seeking reelection. In 1950, Sparks ran unsuccessfully for reelection as governor. He was the only lifelong bachelor to serve as Alabama governor in the 20th century.

== Life and career ==
Chauncey Sparks was born in Barbour County, Alabama, the son of George Washington and Sarah E. (Castello) Sparks. After his father&#x27;s death when Chauncey was two years old, the family moved to Quitman County, Georgia where his mother&#x27;s people lived. He attended school and helped with the family farm. Sparks graduated from Mercer University in Macon, Georgia in 1907 with a Bachelor of Arts degree and received his law degree in 1910.

He wanted to return to Alabama and passed the State Bar exam that year, opening a law practice in Eufaula soon afterward. It was the commercial center of Barbour County, which still had prosperous, extensive white-owned plantations and a majority-black population. Most blacks had been disfranchised since 1901, when the state passed a new constitution containing voter registration requirements such as poll taxes, literacy tests, and grandfather clauses, resulting in the virtual exclusion of blacks from the political system until after passage of federal legislation in the mid-1960s to enforce their constitutional rights as citizens. Tens of thousands of poor whites were also excluded at the time and over the following decades. In the first half of the 20th century, Alabama was effectively a one-party state controlled by white Democrats.

In 1911, Sparks was appointed judge of the inferior court of Barbour County by Democratic Governor Emmet O&#x27;Neal, a position he held until 1915. He was a representative in the Alabama Legislature from 1919 to 1923 and 1931–1939. A prominent Democrat, Sparks served as secretary of the Barbour County Democratic Executive Committee from 1914 to 1918. He also served as a member of the board of trustees of the Department of Archives and History, representing the 3rd Congressional District.

Sparks&#x27; first bid for governor of Alabama was in 1938, and he was defeated by Frank M. Dixon.

== Governor ==
In 1942, Sparks defeated James E. Folsom and Chris Sherlock to win the governor&#x27;s seat, in the process proving himself &quot;an adaptable &#x27;born-aginner&#x27; candidate: against organized labor, against social welfare of any kind, against progressive taxation, against anything that smacked of the hated &#x27;collectivist&#x27; New Deal.&quot;

During his administration, Sparks had to contend with the effects of a wartime economy and the dismantling of war-geared programs after World War II. The massive industrial growth in Alabama during the war resulted in numerous labor problems, making it necessary to re-establish the state Labor Department.

Sparks achieved noteworthy educational gains by doubling state appropriations and lengthening the seven-month school term to eight months. Nevertheless, the system was segregated, and black education was typically underfunded by the state legislature, as were other black facilities.

Under his administration, the University of Alabama School of Medicine (now The University of Alabama at Birmingham) was established in Birmingham, which had become a major industrial city; and a school of forestry was opened at Alabama Polytechnic Institute (now Auburn University). Due to his agricultural background, Sparks was interested in aiding the state&#x27;s agricultural programs. This included increased appropriations and the establishment of several new farm experiment stations under the auspices of Alabama Polytechnic Institute&#x27;s Agricultural College.

During Sparks&#x27; administration, a constitutional amendment was passed requiring the state legislature to convene every two years instead of every four years. The legislature continued to be dominated by rural counties and was not reapportioned to acknowledge changes in the state and movement of population to urban centers until the mid-century. One of Sparks&#x27; most significant achievements was his success in reducing state debt by 25 percent.

== Race relations ==
Sparks was an outspoken opponent of what he terms as &quot;federal encroachments&quot; on what he perceived as states rights issues, especially regarding race relations. Alabama, like other Southern states, had established legal racial segregation in the late 19th and early 20th centuries; it excluded blacks from voting by a variety of devices and had Jim Crow as the custom.

During his campaign, Sparks pledged to &quot;keep the federal government&#x27;s nose out of Alabama business.&quot; He believed in &quot;absolute segregation&quot; and said the Alabama Democratic Party should &quot;do everything necessary to maintain an all-white party.&quot;

During his administration, Alabama voters approved the Boswell Amendment, which reduced the already limited franchise of black people in the state. Sparks had campaigned heavily for the amendment, saying it was needed to prevent &quot;a flood of Negroes&quot; from registering to vote as a result of the recent US Supreme Court ruling &quot;Smith v. Allwright&quot; (1944) that determined white primaries were unconstitutional, as used in Alabama and some other states to restrict access to Democratic Party primaries, which were the only competitive political contests left.

In response to nationwide protests over the kidnapping and gang rape of Recy Taylor, an African American woman from Abbeville, Sparks &quot;reluctantly agreed to launch an investigation&quot; to keep the Federal government from becoming involved. The six white men who raped Taylor admitted to authorities what they had done, but two all-white grand juries subsequently declined to indict them. (As most blacks could not vote, they were excluded from juries.)

In 2011, the Alabama House of Representatives apologized to Taylor on behalf of the state &quot;for its failure to prosecute her attackers&quot; and bring them to justice.

== Later life ==
Sparks was defeated in his bid for reelection in 1950 by Democrat Gordon Persons. Sparks devoted the rest of his life to his private law practice in Eufaula. A lifelong bachelor, he died there on November 6, 1968.

<text>Sigebert III ( 630–656) was the Merovingian king of Austrasia from 633 to his death around 656. He was described as the first Merovingian &quot;roi fainéant&quot;, or &quot;do-nothing king&quot;, with the mayor of the palace in fact ruling the kingdom throughout his reign. Nevertheless, Sigebert lived a pious Christian life and was later sanctified, being remembered as Saint Sigebert of Austrasia in the Roman Catholic Church and Eastern Orthodox Church.

== Life ==

Sigebert was born in 630 as the eldest son of Dagobert I, King of the Franks, and his concubine Ragnetrude. The king recalled and made peace with Saint Amand, who was previously banished for criticizing the king&#x27;s vices, and asked him to baptize his new-born son. The ceremony was performed at Orléans and Charibert II, Dagobert&#x27;s half-brother who was King of Aquitaine at the time, was the god-father. Dagobert assigned the education of Sigebert to Pepin of Landen, who was the mayor of the palace in Austrasia under his father Chlotar II, until 629. Pepin took the young Sigebert and moved with him to his domains in Aquitane, where they stayed the next three years.

In 633, a revolt of the nobles forced Dagobert to make the three-year old Sigebert king of Austrasia, similar to how his father Chlotar II had made him king of Austrasia in 623. However, he refused to give the power to Pepin of Landen by making him mayor of the palace for the child-king. Instead he had put Sigebert under the tutelage of Adalgisel as mayor of the palace and the Bishop of Cologne Saint Cunibert as regent, while keeping Pepin in Neustria as hostage. In 634 Dagobert&#x27;s second son, Clovis II, was born, and the king forced the nobles to accept him as the next king of Neustria and Burgundy, setting up a new division of the empire.

On the death of Dagobert in 639, the two Frankish kingdoms became independent once again under Sigebert III and Clovis II. Both kingdoms were under child-kings – Sigebert was around eleven years old and Clovis was five – and were ruled by the respective regents. It was under Seigbert&#x27;s reign that the mayor of the palace began to play the most important role in the political life of Austrasia, and he has been described as the first &quot;roi fainéant&quot;—do-nothing king—of the Merovingian dynasty. Pepin replaced Adalgisel as mayor of the palace of Austrasia in 639 but died the following year, in 640, and was replaced by his son Grimoald.
In 640 the Duchy of Thuringia rebelled against Austrasia in the only war of Sigebert&#x27;s reign. Grimoald allowed the young king to stand at the head of the army trying to quell the rebellion, but was defeated by Duke Radulph. The &quot;Chronicle of Fredegar&quot; records that the rout left Sigebert weeping in his saddle.

Though ineffective as a king, Sigebert had become a pious adult under the tutelage of Pepin and later Saint Cunibert and lived a life of Christian virtue. He used his wealth to establish numerous monasteries, hospitals, and churches, including the monastery of Stavelot-Malmedy.

Sigebert III died of natural causes on 1 February 656 at age 25. He was buried in the Abbey of Saint Martin near Metz which he had founded. In 1063 his body, found incorrupt, was taken out of the tomb and moved to the side of the altar. The abbey was demolished in 1552 and the relics were moved to the Nancy Cathedral. Sigebert III is revered as a saint by the Catholic Church with his feast day on 1 February. He is the patron saint of Nancy.

== Marriage and succession ==
The Mayor of the Palace Grimoald managed to convince the young Sigebert, who was childless at the time, to adopt as his heir Grimoald&#x27;s son Childebert the Adopted. However, the king married Chimnechild of Burgundy and had a son of his own, the future king Dagobert II. He also had a daughter, Bilichild, the future Queen of Neustria and Burgundy.

In 656, after the death of Sigebert, Grimoald attempted to usurp the throne of Austrasia and had the young Dagobert (who was seven years old at the time) tonsured and sent to a monastery in Ireland. Grimoald&#x27;s son Childebert was proclaimed King of Austrasia in 656, but the reign was short-lived as he was deposed after seven months in 657 and both he and his father were killed in a revolt.

Austrasia next passed under the rule of the children of Sigebert&#x27;s brother Clovis II for a period. Chlothar III, the elder son of Clovis II, became the king of Austrasia in 657. The next year, in 658, he also became King of Neustria and Burgundy upon the death of his father, thus temporarily reuniting the Frankish kingdoms under one rule. A few years later however, the Austrasian nobility again pressed successfully for the kingdoms to be separated. As a result, Childeric II, the younger brother of Chlotar III, became king of Austrasia from 662 to his death in 675. The nobles had put on the throne Clovis III, about whom not much is known, but his reign was short. One year later, in 676, Dagobert II, Siegbert&#x27;s son, was recalled from Ireland and took his father&#x27;s throne after approximately 20 years in exile.

<text>Frank Murray Dixon (July 25, 1892 – October 11, 1965) was an American politician. A member of the Democratic Party, he served as the 40th governor of Alabama from 1939 to 1943 and is most known for reorganizing the state government and reforming the way property taxes were assessed.

==Early life==
Dixon was born in Oakland, California to Reverend Frank Dixon and Laura Dixon. Dixon spent the majority of his youth in Virginia and attended public schools in both Virginia and Washington, DC. He graduated from Phillips Exeter Preparatory School (Phillips Exeter Academy) and then went on to graduate from Columbia University. In 1916 he obtained his law degree from the University of Virginia. He began his law career in Birmingham, Alabama in the law firm of Captain Francis S. White. Soon after, he married Juliet Perry, with whom he had a son and a daughter.

His law practice was interrupted by World War I. Dixon enlisted in the Royal Canadian Air Corps as a volunteer. As a second lieutenant, Dixon was assigned to the French escadrille as an aerial observer and machine gunner. In July 1918, he was wounded when his plane was shot down over Soissons, France, which in turn required his leg to be amputated. Dixon was awarded the Croix de Guerre with Palm by the French government; the French government also named him chevalier of the French Legion of Honor and promoted him to major.

When he returned to Birmingham, he founded a law partnership, Bowers and Dixon, and became a successful corporate lawyer. At that point, he became a commander of the American Legion and was active in veterans&#x27; causes. In 1934 Dixon made his first attempt at the governorship of Alabama but lost the Democratic primary to Bibb Graves. However, in 1938 he easily defeated his opponent and succeeded Graves as the Governor of Alabama.

==Governor of Alabama==

Before his inauguration, Dixon spent extensive time preparing for his term. He met with Bibb Graves, public administration experts, and Franklin Roosevelt to get advice and expertise on his plans for changing Alabama&#x27;s government. As governor, Dixon strove to streamline the state government. He eliminated twenty-seven government agencies in the state by consolidating duties within the departments. The agencies that initially were under the leadership of committees were placed under the authority of one individual who reported directly to the governor. He, therefore, also centralized power in the office of the governor. He terminated the employment of every state employee added to the payroll after the date of his inauguration. He ordered every employee that did not have specific duties to be terminated as well. He pushed through a teachers&#x27; retirement system and a teacher tenure law. He also established a state civil service system that required hiring state employees based on a merit system.

Dixon spent much time reforming the property tax assessment method in the state. Dixon believed that the property tax review boards assigned by the county deliberately under-assessed property taxes. This, in turn, led to inadequately supported school districts and municipal services. He pushed through his reform bill that required local assessment boards to be replaced by a three-person board appointed by the governor.

As World War II began at the end of his term, Dixon&#x27;s accomplishments only increased. He oversaw a wartime reorganization of the docks in Mobile, Alabama, resulting in a four-hundred percent increase in barge traffic. Alabama&#x27;s economy flourished with the shipbuilding and repairing industry brought about by the war. During World War II, Dixon oversaw some war-related events as governor. British soldiers trained in the United States as part of lend-lease; sometimes, those soldiers died in Alabama. Due to the British Army&#x27;s policy of British soldiers being buried in the land where they died, Maddox set up special areas for British pilots who died in Alabama at The Oakwood Cemetery Annex; they were &quot;given a place of their own over which flew the Union Jack.&quot; The graves were maintained by Montgomery women who were members of the Federated Garden Clubs. Dixon organized a very large Armistice Day parade on November 11, 1941. Seven thousand people marched in the parade, with members from every branch of the American armed forces, including Lanier Band, Alabama State band, and the Maxwell band, as well as 3,000 U.S. Army Air Corps flying cadets and several hundred British RAF cadets. The &quot;Montgomery Advertiser&quot; commented that even though thousands lined the parade route, most people did not cheer but rather were calm, respectful, and quiet observers until the British cadets came by. At that point, the crowd did cheer, &quot;...the British cadets alone waking applause from the onlookers.&quot; Governor Dixon also organized and oversaw a &quot;massive&quot; USO show in Montgomery that featured Erle Danley, a music professor from Huntingdon, a choir from Alabama State sang carols, British cadets singing &quot;God Rest Ye Merry, Gentlemen&quot; as well as other events.

==Post gubernatorial years==
After Dixon left office in 1943, he returned to his corporate law practice and began a private firm called Bowers, Dixon, Dunn, and McDowell in Birmingham. He was a lobbyist for conservative causes in the state legislature. He spent much of his time lobbying for the right-to-work law. In 1948, former governor Dixon was temporary chairman and keynote speaker at the Birmingham convention of the States&#x27; Rights Democratic Party that nominated Strom Thurmond and Fielding Wright as their presidential ticket. In the 1960 United States presidential election, Dixon was the highest vote-getter for a slate of unpledged Democratic electors that chose Harry F. Byrd and Strom Thurmond over John F. Kennedy and Lyndon B. Johnson. Dixon died in Birmingham on October 11, 1965.

<doc id="841072" wikidata="Q3545045" url="?curid=841072" title="Crimson Avenger">
<text>The Crimson Avenger is the name of three separate superheroes and supervillains in the DC Comics Universe. The character debuted in 1938 and is notable as the first masked hero in DC Comics.

The first Crimson Avenger, [[Crimson Avenger (Lee Travis)|Lee Walter Travis]], first appeared in &quot;Detective Comics&quot; #20 (October 1938). He is also known as a founding member of DC&#x27;s second depicted superhero team, Seven Soldiers of Victory.

==Fictional character biography==
===Lee Walter Travis===

The Crimson Avenger (along with his sidekick Wing) first appeared in the DC Comics anthology American comic book series &quot;Detective Comics&quot; in issue #20.
The Crimson Avenger had many similarities to The Green Hornet, including a sidekick named Wing who was an Asian valet, and a gas gun that he used to subdue opponents.

===Albert Elwood===
Albert Elwood made a single appearance as the Crimson Avenger, in &quot;World&#x27;s Finest Comics&quot; #131 (February 1963), in a story entitled &quot;The Mystery of the Crimson Avenger&quot;. Eccentric inventor Albert Elwood adopted the guise and attempted to help Superman, Batman and Robin thwart the robberies of the Octopus Gang. A requisite identity confusion occurs when one of the Gang members assumed the Crimson Avenger&#x27;s identity. Elwood helped the heroes capture the gang and retired right afterward. He had many sophisticated gadgets, but his efforts often proved counterproductive, more a hindrance than a help. Elwood did mention that he had &quot;taken the name of a former lawman&quot;, meaning the by-then long defunct original Crimson Avenger.

After the introduction of the DC Comics multiverse in the 1960s, the original Crimson Avenger (Lee Travis) was explained to have lived on Earth-Two; Albert Elwood&#x27;s Earth has never been specified.

===Jill Carlyle===
A female Crimson Avenger first appeared in &quot;Stars and S.T.R.I.P.E.&quot; #9 (April 2000), created by Geoff Johns and Scott Kolins. This version, like the original El Diablo, served as a minor Spirit of Vengeance. She was an African American woman who possessed the powers of teleportation and intangibility. In a flashback sequence, it was revealed that Carlyle studied law but apparently lost a case in which the defendant was clearly guilty. She obtained a pair of Colt pistols originally owned by the first Crimson Avenger and used them to exact vengeance upon the unknown criminal. These guns are cursed such that, if the possessor uses them out of revenge, they will be cursed to track and kill those who have taken an innocent life. Carlyle becomes the Crimson Avenger after taking revenge on the unknown criminal and, also as part of the curse, an ever-bleeding bullet hole appears on her chest. This version was never given a name, but is referred to by fans as Jill Carlyle, a name taken from the headstone of a victim the character was shown avenging in an early appearance. Whether the Avenger is Carlyle herself or not remains unclear.

While the Avenger&#x27;s curse sends her after those who have taken an innocent life, an encounter with Wildcat and Power Girl reveals that &quot;innocent&quot; only has to mean that the victim was innocent of whatever circumstances led to their deaths. Crimson Avenger once targeted Wildcat for causing a man&#x27;s death, but Wildcat revealed that his &quot;victim&quot; had already killed his own brother and the man&#x27;s wife and son after they killed his fiancé; Wildcat planted evidence to frame the dead man for his fiancé&#x27;s murder as he couldn&#x27;t prove the man&#x27;s real crime, and it was up to the legal system if the dead man was executed afterwards.

In the pages of &quot;The New Golden Age&quot;, Crimson Avenger assembles the Seven Soldiers of Victory and takes them on a mission that involved Clock King using Per Degaton&#x27;s time machine on the ship where Lee Travis sacrificed his life on.

==Other versions==
* In Michael Uslan&#x27;s Elseworlds title &quot;Batman: Detective No. 27&quot;, the Crimson Avenger appears as part of an order of detectives including Alfred Pennyworth and Sam Spade and attempts to recruit Bruce Wayne.
* In &quot;The League of Extraordinary Gentlemen: Black Dossier&quot;, the Crimson Avenger is briefly mentioned as having met with Allan Quatermain and Mina Murray during their self-exile from Britain during the years of the Ingsoc government. A photo of Allan and Murray standing in front of the Crimson Avenger&#x27;s second costume is shown.
* The Crimson Avenger makes an appearance in the &quot;Justice League of America 80-Page Giant&quot; #1 comic (November 2009) in a story titled &quot;Zatanna &amp; Black Canary in Fishnet Femmes Fatales!&quot;, when the two heroines are tossed back in time by the supervillain Epoch.
* In &quot;Kingdom Come&quot;, Alex Ross portrayed the character as a giant demon imprisoned in the Gulag. Naming him &quot;King Crimson&quot; in a nod to the band of the same name, his look owes more to his standard superhero look than his previous pulp fiction costume.
* In the pages of &quot;L.E.G.I.O.N.&quot;, Garv assumed a masked identity after quitting the team, calling himself the Crimson Avenger. He dropped the identity when he returned to the team near the end of the series.

==In other media==

* The Lee Travis version of Crimson Avenger makes cameo appearances in &quot;Justice League Unlimited&quot; This version is a member of the Justice League.
** Crimson Avenger also appears in issue #33 of the comic book tie-in &quot;Justice League Adventures&quot;, in which he is revealed to be among the oldest members of the Justice League who began fighting crime sometime after the 1930s.
* The Lee Travis incarnation of Crimson Avenger appears in a photograph in the &quot;Stargirl&quot; episode &quot;Brainwave&quot; as a member of the Seven Soldiers of Victory.

<doc id="841074" wikidata="Q6940317" url="?curid=841074" title="Muscle fatigue">
<text>Muscle fatigue is when muscles that were initially generating a normal amount of force, then experience a declining ability to generate force. It can be a result of vigorous exercise, but abnormal fatigue may be caused by barriers to or interference with the different stages of muscle contraction. There are two main causes of muscle fatigue: the limitations of a nerve’s ability to generate a sustained signal (neural fatigue); and the reduced ability of the muscle fiber to contract (metabolic fatigue).

Muscle fatigue is not the same as muscle weakness, though weakness is an initial symptom. Despite a normal amount of force being generated at the start of activity, once muscle fatigue has set in and progressively worsens, if the individual persists in the exercise they will eventually lose their hand grip, or become unable to lift or push with their arms or legs, or become unable to maintain an isometric position (such as plank). Other symptoms may accompany such as myalgia (muscle pain), shortness of breath, fasciculations (muscle twitching), myokymia (muscle trembling), and muscle cramps during exercise; muscle soreness may occur afterwards. An inappropriate rapid heart rate response to exercise may be seen, such as in the metabolic myopathy of McArdle disease (GSD-V), where the heart tries to compensate for the deficit of ATP in the skeletal muscle cells (metabolic fatigue) by increasing heart rate to maximize delivery of oxygen and blood borne fuels to the muscles for oxidative phosphorylation. The combination of an inappropriate rapid heart rate response to exercise with heavy or rapid breathing is known as an exaggerated cardiorespiratory response to exercise. 

Due to the confusion between muscle fatigue and muscle weakness, there have been instances of abnormal muscle fatigue being described as exercise-induced muscle weakness. 

==Muscle contraction==

Muscle cells work by detecting a flow of electrical impulses from the brain which signals them to contract through the release of calcium by the sarcoplasmic reticulum. Fatigue (reduced ability to generate force) may occur due to the nerve, or within the muscle cells themselves.

==Neural fatigue ==
Nerves are responsible for controlling the contraction of muscles, determining the number, sequence and force of muscular contraction. Most movements require a force far below what a muscle could potentially generate, and nervous fatigue is seldom an issue. But, during extremely powerful contractions that are close to the upper limit of a muscle&#x27;s ability to generate force, nervous fatigue (enervation) — in which the nerve signal weakens — can be a limiting factor in untrained individuals.

In novice strength trainers, the muscle&#x27;s ability to generate force is most strongly limited by nerve’s ability to sustain a high-frequency signal. After a period of maximum contraction, the nerve’s signal reduces in frequency and the force generated by the contraction diminishes. There is no sensation of pain or discomfort, the muscle appears to simply ‘stop listening’ and gradually cease to contract, often going backwards. Often there is insufficient stress on the muscles and tendons to cause delayed onset muscle soreness following the workout.

Part of the process of strength training is increasing the nerve&#x27;s ability to generate sustained, high frequency signals which allow a muscle to contract with its greatest force. This neural training can cause several weeks of rapid gains in strength, which level off once the nerve is generating maximum contractions and the muscle reaches its physiological limit. Past this point, training effects increase muscular strength through myofibrillar or sarcoplasmic hypertrophy and metabolic fatigue becomes the factor limiting contractile force.

==Metabolic fatigue==
Though not universally used, ‘metabolic fatigue’ is a common term for the reduction in contractile force due to the direct or indirect effects of two main factors:
# Shortage of, or inability to metabolize, fuel (substrates) within the muscle fiber causing a low ATP reservoir.
# Accumulation of substances (metabolites) within the muscle fiber, which interfere either with the release of calcium (Ca2+) or with the ability of calcium to stimulate muscle contraction.

===Substrates===
Substrates within the muscle serve to power muscular contractions. They include molecules such as adenosine triphosphate (ATP), glycogen and creatine phosphate. ATP binds to the myosin head and causes the ‘ratchetting’ that results in contraction according to the sliding filament model. Creatine phosphate stores energy so ATP can be rapidly regenerated within the muscle cells from adenosine diphosphate (ADP) and inorganic phosphate ions, allowing for sustained powerful contractions that last between 5–7 seconds. Glycogen is the intramuscular storage form of glucose, used to generate energy quickly as intramuscular phosphocreatine stores become exhausted, producing lactic acid as a metabolic byproduct.

Substrate shortage is one of the causes of metabolic fatigue. Substrates are depleted during exercise or are unable to be metabolized (e.g. metabolic myopathies), resulting in a lack of intracellular energy sources to fuel contractions. In essence, the muscle stops contracting because it lacks the energy to do so.

===Metabolites===
Metabolites are the substances (generally waste products) produced as a result of muscular contraction. They include chloride, potassium, lactic acid, ADP, magnesium (Mg2+), reactive oxygen species, and inorganic phosphate. Accumulation of metabolites can directly or indirectly produce metabolic fatigue within muscle fibers through interference with the release of calcium (Ca2+) from the sarcoplasmic reticulum or reduction of the sensitivity of contractile molecules actin and myosin to calcium.

Intracellular chloride partially inhibits the contraction of muscles. Namely, it prevents muscles from contracting due to &quot;false alarms&quot;, small stimuli which may cause them to contract (akin to myoclonus).

====Potassium====
High concentrations of potassium (K+) also causes the muscle cells to decrease in efficiency, causing cramping and fatigue. Potassium builds up in the t-tubule system and around the muscle fiber as a result of action potentials. The shift in K+ changes the membrane potential around the muscle fiber. The change in membrane potential causes a decrease in the release of calcium (Ca2+) from the sarcoplasmic reticulum.

====Lactic acid====
It was once believed that lactic acid build-up was the cause of muscle fatigue. The assumption was lactic acid had a &quot;pickling&quot; effect on muscles, inhibiting their ability to contract. Though the impact of lactic acid on performance is now uncertain, it may assist or hinder muscle fatigue.

Produced as a by-product of fermentation, lactic acid can increase intracellular acidity of muscles. This can lower the sensitivity of contractile apparatus to Ca2+ but also has the effect of increasing cytoplasmic Ca2+ concentration through an inhibition of the chemical pump that actively transports calcium out of the cell. This counters inhibiting effects of potassium on muscular action potentials. Lactic acid also has a negating effect on the chloride ions in the muscles, reducing their inhibition of contraction and leaving potassium ions as the only restricting influence on muscle contractions, though the effects of potassium are much less than if there were no lactic acid to remove the chloride ions. Ultimately, it is uncertain if lactic acid reduces fatigue through increased intracellular calcium or increases fatigue through reduced sensitivity of contractile proteins to Ca2+.

Lactic acid is now used as a measure of endurance training effectiveness and VO2 max.

==Pathology==
Muscle fatigue may be due to problems with the nerve supply, neuromuscular disease (such as myasthenia gravis), inborn errors of metabolism (such as metabolic myopathies), or problems with muscle itself. The latter category includes polymyositis and other muscle disorders.

==Molecular mechanisms==
Muscle fatigue may be due to precise molecular changes that occur &quot;in vivo&quot; with sustained exercise. It has been found that the ryanodine receptor present in skeletal muscle undergoes a conformational change during exercise, resulting in &quot;leaky&quot; channels that are deficient in calcium release. These &quot;leaky&quot; channels may be a contributor to muscle fatigue and decreased exercise capacity.

==Effect on performance==
Fatigue has been found to play a big role in limiting performance in just about every individual in every sport. In research studies, participants were found to show reduced voluntary force production in fatigued muscles (measured with concentric, eccentric, and isometric contractions), vertical jump heights, other field tests of lower body power, reduced throwing velocities, reduced kicking power and velocity, less accuracy in throwing and shooting activities, endurance capacity, anaerobic capacity, anaerobic power, mental concentration, and many other performance parameters when sport specific skills are examined.

==Electromyography==
Electromyography is a research technique that allows researchers to look at muscle recruitment in various conditions, by quantifying electrical signals sent to muscle fibers through motor neurons. In general, fatigue protocols have shown increases in EMG data over the course of a fatiguing protocol, but reduced recruitment of muscle fibers in tests of power in fatigued individuals. In most studies, this increase in recruitment during exercise correlated with a decrease in performance (as would be expected in a fatiguing individual).

Median power frequency is often used as a way to track fatigue using EMG. Using the median power frequency, raw EMG data is filtered to reduce noise and then relevant time windows are Fourier Transformed. In the case of fatigue in a 30-second isometric contraction, the first window may be the first second, the second window might be at second 15, and the third window could be the last second of contraction (at second 30). Each window of data is analyzed and the median power frequency is found. Generally, the median power frequency decreases over time, demonstrating fatigue. Some reasons why fatigue is found are due to action potentials of motor units having a similar pattern of repolarization, fast motor units activating and then quickly deactivating while slower motor units remain, and conduction velocities of the nervous system decreasing over time.

<doc id="841077" wikidata="Q409468" url="?curid=841077" title="Metoprolol">
<text>Metoprolol, sold under the brand name Lopressor among others, is a medication used to treat angina, high blood pressure and a number of conditions involving an abnormally fast heart rate. It is also used to prevent further heart problems after myocardial infarction and to prevent headaches in those with migraines. It is a beta blocker, specifically a selective β1 receptor blocker, and is taken by mouth or is given intravenously.
Common side effects include trouble sleeping, feeling tired, feeling faint, and abdominal discomfort. Large doses may cause serious toxicity. Risk in pregnancy has not been ruled out. It appears to be safe in breastfeeding. The metabolism of metoprolol can vary widely among patients, often as a result of hepatic impairment or CYP2D6 polymorphism.
Metoprolol was first made in 1969, patented in 1970, and approved for medical use in 1978. It is on the World Health Organization&#x27;s List of Essential Medicines. It is available as a generic medication. In 2022, it was the sixth most commonly prescribed medication in the United States, with more than 65million prescriptions.

== Medical uses ==
Metoprolol is used for a number of conditions, including angina, acute myocardial infarction, high blood pressure, supraventricular tachycardia, ventricular tachycardia, congestive heart failure, and prevention of migraine headaches. It is an adjunct in the treatment of hyperthyroidism. Both oral and intravenous forms of metoprolol are available for administration. The different salt versions of metoprolol – metoprolol tartrate and metoprolol succinate – are approved for different conditions and are not interchangeable.

Off-label uses include supraventricular tachycardia and thyroid storm.

== Adverse effects ==
Adverse effects, especially with higher doses, include dizziness, drowsiness, fatigue, diarrhea, unusual dreams, trouble sleeping, depression, and vision problems such as blurred vision or dry eyes. β-blockers, including metoprolol, reduce salivary flow via inhibition of the direct sympathetic innervation of the salivary glands. Metoprolol may also cause the hands and feet to feel cold. Due to the high penetration across the blood–brain barrier, lipophilic beta blockers such as propranolol and metoprolol are more likely than other less lipophilic beta blockers to cause sleep disturbances such as insomnia, vivid dreams and nightmares. Patients should be cautious while driving or operating machinery due to its potential to cause decreased alertness.

There may also be an impact on blood sugar levels, and it can potentially mask signs of low blood sugar.

The safety of metoprolol during pregnancy is not fully established.
=== Precautions ===
Metoprolol reduces long-term mortality and hospitalisation due to worsening heart failure. A meta-analysis further supports reduced incidence of heart failure worsening in patients treated with beta-blockers compared to placebo. However, in some circumstances, particularly when initiating metoprolol in patients with more symptomatic disease, an increased prevalence of hospitalisation and mortality has been reported within the first two months of starting. Patients should monitor for swelling of extremities, fatigue, and shortness of breath. 

A Cochrane Review concluded that although metoprolol reduces the risk of atrial fibrillation recurrence, it is unclear whether the long-term benefits outweigh the risks.

This medicine may cause changes in blood sugar levels or cover up signs of low blood sugar, such as a rapid pulse rate. It also may cause some people to become less alert than they are normally, making it dangerous for them to drive or use machines.

===Pregnancy and breastfeeding===
Risk for the fetus has not been ruled out, per being rated pregnancy category C in Australia, meaning that it may be suspected of causing harmful effects on the human fetus (but no malformations). It appears to be safe in breastfeeding.

== Overdose ==
Excessive doses of metoprolol can cause bradycardia, hypotension, metabolic acidosis, seizures, and cardiorespiratory arrest. Blood or plasma concentrations may be measured to confirm a diagnosis of overdose or poisoning in hospitalized patients or to assist in a medicolegal death investigation. Plasma levels are usually less than 200 μg/L during therapeutic administration, but can range from 1–20 mg/L in overdose victims.

== Pharmacology ==

=== Mechanism of action ===
Metoprolol is a beta blocker, or an antagonist of the β-adrenergic receptors. It is specifically a selective antagonist of the β1-adrenergic receptor and has no intrinsic sympathomimetic activity.

Metoprolol exerts its effects by blocking the action of certain neurotransmitters, specifically adrenaline and noradrenaline. It does this by selectively binding to and antagonizing β1 adrenergic receptors in the body. When adrenaline (epinephrine) or noradrenaline (norepinephrine) are released from nerve endings or secreted by the adrenal glands, they bind to β1 adrenergic receptors found primarily in cardiac tissues such as the heart. This binding activates these receptors, leading to various physiological responses, including an increase in heart rate, force of contraction (inotropic effect), conduction speed through electrical pathways in the heart, and release of renin from the kidneys. Metoprolol competes with adrenaline and noradrenaline for binding sites on these β1 receptors. By occupying these receptor sites without activating them, metoprolol blocks or inhibits their activation by endogenous catecholamines like adrenaline or noradrenaline.

Metoprolol blocks β1-adrenergic receptors in heart muscle cells, thereby decreasing the slope of phase 4 in the nodal action potential (reducing Na+ uptake) and prolonging repolarization of phase 3 (slowing down K+ release). It also suppresses the norepinephrine-induced increase in the sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR) Ca2+ leak and the spontaneous SR Ca2+ release, which are the major triggers for atrial fibrillation.

Through this mechanism of selective blockade at β1 receptors, metoprolol exerts the following effects:
# Heart rate reduction, i.e., decrease of the resting heart rate (negative chronotropic effect) and reduction of excessive elevations resulting from exercise or stress.
# Reduction of the force of contraction, i.e., decrease in contractility (negative inotropic effect), which lessens how hard each heartbeat contracts.
# Decrease in cardiac output, i.e., decrease in both heart rate and contractility within myocardium cells, where β1 is predominantly located, overall blood output per minute lowers called cardiac output/dysfunction, allowing decreased demands placed onto impaired hearts, reducing oxygen demand-supply mismatch.
# Lowering of blood pressure.
# Antiarrhythmic effects, such as supraventricular tachycardia prevention. Metoprolol also prevents electrical wave propagation.

=== Pharmacokinetics ===
Metoprolol is mostly absorbed from the intestine with an absorption fraction of 0.95. The systemic bioavailability after oral administration is approximately 50%. Less than 5% of an orally administered dose of metoprolol is excreted unchanged in urine; most of it is eliminated in metabolized form through feces via bile secretion into the intestines.

Metoprolol undergoes extensive metabolism in the liver, mainly α-hydroxylation and O-demethylation through various cytochrome P450 enzymes such as CYP2D6 (primary), CYP3A4, CYP2B6, and CYP2C9. The primary metabolites formed are α-hydroxymetoprolol and O-demethylmetoprolol.

Metoprolol is classified as a moderately lipophilic beta blocker. More lipophilic beta blockers tend to cross the blood–brain barrier more readily, with greater potential for effects in the central nervous system as well as associated neuropsychiatric side effects. Metoprolol binds mainly to human serum albumin with an unbound fraction of 0.88. It has a large volume of distribution at steady state (3.2 L/kg), indicating extensive distribution throughout the body.

== Chemistry ==

Metoprolol was synthesized and its activity discovered in 1969. The specific agent in on-market formulations of metoprolol is either metoprolol tartrate or metoprolol succinate, where tartrate is an immediate-release formulation and the succinate is an extended-release formulation (with 100 mg metoprolol tartrate corresponding to 95 mg metoprolol succinate).

=== Stereochemistry ===

Metoprolol contains a stereocenter and consists of two enantiomers. This is a racemate, i.e. a 1:1 mixture of (&quot;R&quot;)- and the (&quot;S&quot;)-form:
== Society and culture ==
=== Legal status ===
Metoprolol was approved for medical use in the United States in August 1978.

=== Economics ===
In the 2000s, a lawsuit was brought against the manufacturers of Toprol XL (a time-release formula version of metoprolol) and its generic equivalent (metoprolol succinate) claiming that to increase profits, lower cost generic versions of Toprol XL were intentionally kept off the market. It alleged that the pharmaceutical companies AstraZeneca AB, AstraZeneca LP, AstraZeneca Pharmaceuticals LP, and Aktiebolaget Hassle violated antitrust and consumer protection law. In a settlement by the companies in 2012, without admission to the claims, they agreed to a settlement pay-out of US$ 11million.

===Sport===
Because beta blockers can be used to reduce heart rate and minimize tremors, which can enhance performance in sports such as archery, metoprolol is banned by the world anti-doping agency in some sports.

<doc id="841082" wikidata="Q165465" url="?curid=841082" title="Albert Augustus Pope">
<text>Albert Augustus Pope (May 20, 1843 – August 10, 1909) was a Brevet Lieutenant-Colonel in the Union Army. He was an importer, promoter, and manufacturer of bicycles, and a manufacturer of automobiles.

==Early life==
Pope was born on May 20, 1843, in Boston, Massachusetts. His parents were Charles Pope and Elizabeth Bogman Pope. His father descended from a line of New Englanders in the timber and lumber business since the 1660s, but Charles opted for speculating in real estate. His maternal grandfather, Captain James Bogman, disappeared at sea after sailing out of Norfolk, Virginia, when Elizabeth was a youth. Albert was one of eight children.

Around 1845, Charles Pope initiated his independence from the family business when he purchased his first lot in Brookline, Massachusetts, a nearby suburb of Boston. In 1846, he moved the family from Milton, Massachusetts, to a large house on Harvard Street in Brookline. He borrowed against his older landholdings to accumulate more lots at Harvard Place, and on Summer, Vernon, and Washington Streets. As these lots gained convenient streetcar access, or were even rumored to be so, he sold his Brookline properties at a hefty profit. He continued to accumulate property through 1850, but starting in 1851, the financial leverage caught up to him, and sales of his land holdings only paid his creditors.

William Pope, a brother of Charles, moved to Brookline prior to 1850, bringing some of Albert&#x27;s cousins into the neighborhood. Albert attended Brookline Grammar School with his cousin George, who was just a year younger than Albert.

Charles Pope never recovered from his business downfall, according to the family story. Albert was already the breadwinner at age nine: first plowing fields, then selling produce, and at the age of fifteen, working the Quincy Market. A few years later he worked as a store clerk for $4 per week. Yet an Albert Pope biographer writes, &quot;a study of his life suggests that his well-connected wider family helped him to get ahead and that his leaving school had less to do with providing for his needy family than with perceiving he could go, further, faster on his own.&quot; Another historian argues that Charles Pope invested with Albert in Boston real estate and was an original investor in Pope Manufacturing Company.

==American Civil War==
On August 27, 1862, at the age of nineteen, Albert Pope joined the Union Army attached to the 35th Massachusetts Volunteer Regiment, commissioned as a Second Lieutenant. The unit crossed the Potomac River on September 7, and just ten days later, fought at Antietam. The 35th Massachusetts confronted a Confederate crossfire and was stranded behind enemy lines with its ammunition exhausted before answering an order to retreat. Seventy-nine men from Pope&#x27;s unit died that day. Pope survived a bout with cholera, and his unit served at the Battles of Fredericksburg, Vicksburg, and Knoxville. He mustered out as a captain, though he received the honorary title of Brevet Lieutenant-Colonel for distinguished service. A Brevet title did not carry with it added authority or added pay.

==Life after the war==
Albert used $900 in savings from his military salary to invest in a shoemakers&#x27; supply business at Dock Square in Boston. After just a year, this investment had returned $9,600, worth more than $100,000 in 2000 U.S. dollars. Though Albert left school at an early age, he supported the college education of three of his siblings: his twin sisters Emily and Augusta, and his youngest brother, Louis. Emily and Augusta Pope would later become physicians, and Louis would graduate from seminary and become a minister. His eldest brother, a widower named Charles, died in 1868. Albert adopted his seven-year-old nephew, Harry Melville Pope. Later, Emily and Augusta would both graduate from medical school, complete post-doctoral studies in Europe, and practice at the New England Hospital for Women and Children (known today as the Dimock Center). In 1886, they were both admitted into the Massachusetts Medical Society.

He married September 20, 1871, Abbie Linder, daughter of George Linder and Matilda Smallwood, of Newton, Massachusetts, and they had four sons and one daughter. At the time of his marriage, Pope was still supporting his youngest brother Louis. Abbie bore two children during the first few years of their marriage, Albert Linder Pope in 1872 and Margaret Roberts Pope in 1874. He was also successful in expanding his business interests to air pistols, cigarette rollers, and shoe findings.

==The bicycle years==

===Imports and the first Columbias===
Pope was elected to Newton Common Council in 1875. The following summer, he attended the Philadelphia Centennial Exhibition in his capacity as Newton Alderman, where he saw a display of English ordinary bicycles. Some Baltimore-based importers sponsored the bicycle exhibit. The English manufacturer Haynes &amp; Jefferies was building and exporting copies of the Ariel model with the permission of James Starley and William Hillman. The Ariel-design featured a system of spokes that allowed larger wheels, and to prove the point, an ordinary with an 84-inch front wheel was on display.

In 1877, English bicycle-manufacturer John Harrington visited Pope during an extended stay in the United States. He hired a machinist to build a bicycle, completed in August 1877 at a cost of $313. Harrington used this machine to teach Pope how to ride. Pope made arrangements to import eight model &quot;Excelsior Duplexes&quot; from Bayliss, Thomas and Company of Coventry, England. He accepted delivery in January 1878, and placed an advertisement for his imported bicycles in &quot;Bicycling World&quot; magazine a few months later.

Pope had already invested over $4,000 importing about fifty bicycles through the first part of 1878. In May, he started inquiring about manufacturing his own machine. He met with George Fairfield, president of Weed Sewing Machine Company in Hartford. Pope stowed his Excelsior Duplex in the baggage hold of a New Haven Railroad train bound for Hartford, then rode from the Hartford station to the meeting at the Weed factory. Pope proposed to Fairfield that Weed produce fifty copies of this bicycle on a contract basis. Fairfield later accepted the offer. The Weed factory completed the order in September 1878, and these were the first bicycles Pope marketed under the &quot;Columbia&quot; brand. He managed his new bicycle business from his Pope Manufacturing Company office in Boston.

Pope sold a total of about ninety-two bicycles in 1878, combining imports and Columbias. In 1879, he sold about 1000 Columbias, the last year of the Excelsior Duplex copies. Demand for his bicycles exceeded his ability to produce them, so his advertisements stressed imports. Fairfield started tinkering with the design, improving the head and the front ball-bearing assembly resulting in the &quot;Special&quot; model. In 1880, a Special with a 48-inch wheel and full-nickel plating retailed at $132.50. The newly named &quot;Standard&quot; model also had design changes, but could be purchased without the ball bearings and nickel plating for $87.50.

===Patent control===
Two American firms formed a cartel around the United States patents of bicycles shortly after Pope entered the industry: Boston-based Richardson and McKee, and Montpelier Manufacturing of Vermont. Richardson and McKee owned the Pierre Lallement patent with six years remaining. Montpelier Manufacturing had gained shared control through legal threats and negotiation. The Vermont-based firm told Richardson and McKee that it was infringing on its rocking-horse patent. The two companies agreed to combine their patents and split a $10 or $15 royalty per bicycle that they would enforce against American producers. Pope managed to negotiate separately with the two companies and purchased controlling interest in the patent pool. He continued to invest in patents even remotely related to bicycle production. He filed lawsuits against rival bicycle marketers, then agreed to drop the suits in exchange for a $10 per unit royalty fee.

===Promotion of bicycles and cycling===
Pope spent no less than $8,000 on bicycle advocacy. As some local governments had introduced restrictions or bans on bicycle use, Pope treated this as a threat to his business. In response to an 1880 New York City ban against bicycle riding in Central Park, he staged a legal confrontation. Three cyclists rode into Central Park to defy the law with the knowledge that Pope would pay their legal fees. The cyclists, however, lost the cases and all the appeals, but Pope did provide the support he promised.

Pope, with his brother Arthur and his cousin Edward, were among the founders of the Massachusetts Bicycle Club.

Pope continued importing ordinaries from Europe and taking out US patents on these models. By the early 1890s, he had established a bicycle trust which controlled the central bicycle patents in the US. Nearly every US bicycle manufacturer paid Pope around $10 per bicycle. His bicycle brand was known as the Columbia. By the mid-1890s, at the height of the bicycle craze, Pope was manufacturing about a quarter million bicycles annually.

The major problem for bicycles at this time was the lack of suitable roads on which to ride them. Pope being not only a bicycle manufacturer but a bicycle-riding enthusiast, was particularly troubled by this problem. He formed the League of American Wheelmen and the Good Roads Movement to agitate for and petition governments for improved roads.

==Automobiles==
===Columbia Automobile Company===
From 1896, he began to diversify into automobile production. The chief engineer of his Pope Motor Carriage department was Hiram Percy Maxim. In 1897, he renamed the Motor Carriage Department as the separate Columbia Automobile Company, which was spun off and sold to the Electric Vehicle Company, in which he was also an investor.

In 1897, Pope Manufacturing began production of an electric automobile in Hartford, Connecticut. By 1899, the company had produced over 500 vehicles. Hiram Percy Maxim was head engineer of the Motor Vehicle Department. The Electric Vehicle division was spun off that year as the independent company Columbia Automobile Company but it was acquired by the Electric Vehicle Company by the end of the year.

Pope tried to re-enter the automobile manufacturing market in 1901 by acquiring a number of small firms, but the process was expensive and competition in the industry was heating up.

Between the years 1903 and 1915, the company operated a number of automobile companies including Pope-Hartford (19031914), Pope-Robinson, Pope-Toledo (19031909), Pope-Tribune (19041907) and Pope-Waverly.

Pope declared bankruptcy in 1907 and abandoned the automobile industry in 1915.

Pope is credited with being the first auto manufacturer to use mass production practices. In 1900 Pope&#x27;s [Hartford] factories produced more motor vehicles than any other factory in the world.

==Death==
He died on August 10, 1909.

==Legacy==

===Pope Park===
Pope donated the land for Pope Park to the city of Hartford in 1894 and provided an endowment for its upkeep. A horse trough and fountain was dedicated to him in the park.

Following his death, some companies joined the United States Motor Company. Pope&#x27;s empire collapsed in 1913.

<doc id="841085" wikidata="Q1048197" url="?curid=841085" title="Rally Trophy">
<text>Rally Trophy is a 2001 historic PC rally simulation, developed by Bugbear Entertainment and published by JoWooD Productions for the Microsoft Windows operating system in 2001.

==Reception==
&quot;Rally Trophy&quot; received &quot;favorable&quot; reviews according to the review aggregation website Metacritic. The Finnish gaming magazine &quot;Pelit&quot; summarized that &quot;&quot;Rally Trophy&quot; sets the standard for all future driving games. The graphics are absolutely stunning and the lack of inspiring game modes is compensated by the sheer thrill of driving cars that behave uniquely and realistically. A must-have for all rally fans&quot;.

IGN summarized that &quot;&quot;Rally Trophy&quot; is a superb game that offers an unusual alternative to the more technology packed offerings like McRae and &quot;Pro Rally&quot;&quot;. Several critics compared the game to &quot;Grand Prix Legends&quot; including &quot;Pelit&quot;, IGN and GameSpot.

&quot;GameSpot&quot; presented &quot;Rally Trophy&quot; with its annual &quot;Best Driving Game on PC&quot; award. The game was a nominee for &quot;PC Gamer US&quot;″s &quot;2002 Best Racing Game&quot; award, which ultimately went to &quot;NASCAR Racing 2002 Season&quot;.

The game sold over 650.000 copies.

<doc id="841086" wikidata="Q456991" url="?curid=841086" title="Pablo Gargallo">
<text>Pablo Emilio or Pau Emili Gargallo (5 January 1881 – 28 December 1934), known simply as Pau or Pablo Gargallo, was a Spanish sculptor and painter.

==Life and career==
Born in Maella, Aragon, he moved to Barcelona, with his family in 1888, where he would begin his training in the arts. Gargallo developed a style of sculpture based on the creation of three-dimensional objects from pieces of flat metal plate, and he also used paper or cardboard. Some of these sculptures have a form of cubism. For example, only one half of a face may be shown, and it may have only one eye. He also made more traditional sculptures in bronze, marble and other materials.

He spent a significant part of his life in the Montparnasse Quarter of Paris, France. In 1903, he invested a studio at the &quot;Cité d&#x27;Artistes&quot;, rue Vercingétorix in the 14th arrondissement of Paris. There he met Max Jacob and Carlos Casagemas, both friends of Pablo Picasso.

In 1907, he stayed at the artists commune Le Bateau-Lavoir in Montmartre with Max Jacob, Juan Gris and other artists. He spent his first night in the studio of his friend Picasso, whose head he modeled as a sculpture. There he was able to contemplate Picasso&#x27;s seminal proto-Cubist painting &quot;Les Demoiselles d&#x27;Avignon&quot;. Shortly thereafter, Juan Gris introduced him to Magali Tartanson, whom he married in 1915. During this period, Gargallo was influenced by the work of Picasso.

Among Gargallo&#x27;s works are three pieces based on Greta Garbo: &quot;Masque de Greta Garbo à la mèche,&quot; &quot;Tête de Greta Garbo avec chapeau,&quot; and &quot;Masque de Greta Garbo aux cils.&quot;
Together with Dídac Masana, Gargallo sculpted the great arch over the front of the stage of the Palau de la Música Catalana in Barcelona. The work depicts the Ride of the Valkyries in Richard Wagner&#x27;s opera &quot;Die Walküre&quot; (&quot;The Valkyries&quot;).

Gargallo suffered from fulminating bronchial pneumonia and died in Reus, Tarragona. He is considered to be one of the most significant artists of the Spanish avant-garde, and in 1985 the Pablo Gargallo Museum in Zaragoza opened in the former Argillo Palace. Gargallo&#x27;s birthplace and early home, on the street now dedicated to his name in Maella, Zaragosa, has been transformed into a museum dedicated to his life and works.

<text>Sheikh Sultan bin Zayed bin Sultan Al Nahyan (; 1955 – 18 November 2019) was an Emirati politician and member of the Al Nahyan family who previously served as the 3rd Deputy Prime Minister of the United Arab Emirates.

==Early life and education==
Sheikh Sultan was the second son of Sheikh Zayed bin Sultan Al Nahyan, founder of the UAE. He was born in 1953. His mother was his father&#x27;s second wife, Sheikha bint Madhad Al Mashghouni. Sheikh Sultan was educated at Millfield School in Somerset, England and was a graduate of Royal Military Academy Sandhurst. His older paternal half-brother Sheikh Khalifa, was the president of the United Arab Emirates (2004-2022), while his other half-brother, Sheikh Mohamed, is the current president of the United Arab Emirates and the ruler of Abu Dhabi.

==Career==
Sheikh Sultan served as the chairman of the UAE Football Association (1976–1981). In 1990, he was appointed as deputy prime minister of the United Arab Emirates.

From 1997 to 2009 he served with his younger half-brother Sheikh Hamdan as deputy prime minister. In 2009, he was replaced by his half-brother Sheikh Saif and Sheikh Mansour in the post.

Sheikh Sultan was the president&#x27;s representative, chairman of the media and cultural centre, chairman of the Emirates Heritage Club and chairman of Zayed center for coordination and follow-up, a member of Supreme Petroleum Council, and a member of Abu Dhabi Investment Authority.

Sheikh Sultan once served as the chairman of the Zayed Center which was later closed by the UAE government when it became known that it disseminated and provided a platform for anti-American, anti-Semitic, and extreme anti-Israel views.

==Death==
Sultan bin Zayed died on 18 November 2019.

<doc id="841093" wikidata="Q988405" url="?curid=841093" title="Essential hypertension">
<text>Essential hypertension (also called primary hypertension, or idiopathic hypertension) is a form of hypertension without an identifiable physiologic cause. It is the most common type affecting 85% of those with high blood pressure. The remaining 15% is accounted for by various causes of secondary hypertension. Essential hypertension tends to be familial and is likely to be the consequence of an interaction between environmental and genetic factors. Hypertension can increase the risk of cerebral, cardiac, and renal events.

==Classification==

Blood pressure is classified as normal blood pressure, prehypertension, hypertension (stages I and II), and isolated systolic hypertension, which is a common occurrence among the elderly. These readings are based on the average of seated blood pressure readings that were properly measured during 2 or more office visits. In adults, hypertension is considered to be present when a person&#x27;s blood pressure is consistently at least 140 mmHg systolic or 90 mmHg diastolic. Patients with blood pressures over 130/80 mmHg along with Type 1 or Type 2 diabetes, or kidney disease require further treatment.

Resistant hypertension is defined as the failure to reduce blood pressure to normal levels following an adequate trial of three antihypertensive medications. Guidelines for treating resistant hypertension have been published in the UK, and US.

==Risk factors==
The etiology of hypertension differs widely amongst individuals within a large population. While essential hypertension has no identifiable cause, several risk factors have been identified.
===Genetics===
Having a personal family history of hypertension increases the likelihood that an individual develops it. More than 50 genes have been examined in association studies with hypertension, and the number is constantly growing. One of these genes is the angiotensinogen (AGT) gene, studied extensively by Kim et al. They showed that increasing the number of AGT increases the blood pressure and hence this may cause hypertension. In single variant tests, it has been shown that SNPs were enriched for variants associated with adiposity, type 2 diabetes, coronary heart disease and kidney function in previously published GWAS, providing evidence that genetic loci related to blood pressure contribute to cardiovascular outcomes. Twins have been included in studies measuring ambulatory blood pressure; from these studies it has been suggested that there is a large genetic influence on essential hypertension. Supporting data has emerged from animal studies as well as clinical studies in human populations. The majority of these studies support the concept that the inheritance is probably multifactorial or that a number of different genetic defects each has an elevated blood pressure as one of its phenotypic expressions. However, the genetic influence on hypertension is not fully understood at the moment. It is believed that linking hypertension-related phenotypes with specific variations of the genome may yield definitive evidence of heritability. Another view is that hypertension can be caused by mutations in single genes, inherited on a Mendelian basis.

=== Race ===
In the United States, essential hypertension is four times more common in black than white people, accelerates more rapidly and is often more severe with higher mortality in black patients. It is argued there are numerous racial inequities, often inconspicuous, that contribute to black individuals having higher prevalence of essential hypertension than white people. Discrimination may have both a direct and indirect effect on hypertension. Chronic stress, like that caused by perceived discrimination, has been linked to a number of health problems. Access to social, financial, and educational resources that can enhance one&#x27;s health is unequally impacted by racial prejudice. Numerous studies have demonstrated the connection between feeling discriminated against and having elevated blood pressure. In comparison to participants who reported low levels of lifetime discrimination, a study from the Jackson Heart Study indicated that those people who reported high or medium levels of prejudice were more likely to acquire hypertension. Racial inequities are rarely acknowledged as significant risk factors in the healthcare industry.

Other studies have noted while African-Americans tend to have elevated hypertension relative to the general American population, their rates of high blood pressure are nonetheless much lower than some other white populations globally. Russians and eastern Europeans have markedly higher hypertension rates than Black Americans, and blood pressure rates vary substantially among black Africans with obesity rates being closely correlated with hypertension.

===Diet===

An unhealthy diet, which includes excessive consumption of unhealthy food, is a recognized risk factor for hypertension. A balanced diet is recommended for both its prevention and control. Dietary sodium intake also contributes to blood pressure. Approximately one third of the essential hypertensive population is responsive to sodium intake. When sodium intake exceeds the capacity of the body to excrete it through the kidneys, blood volume will expand due to movement of fluids by osmosis into the blood vessels. This causes the arterial pressure to rise as the cardiac output will increase. Local autoregulatory mechanisms counteract this by increasing the vascular resistance to blood flow in order to maintain normal pressure in the capillary blood vessels . As arterial pressure increases in response to high sodium chloride intake, urinary sodium excretion increases but this higher excretion of salt is maintained at the expense of increased arterial blood pressure. The increased sodium ion concentration stimulates ADH and thirst mechanisms, leading to increased reabsorption of water in the kidneys, a concentrated urine, and thirst with a higher intake of water. 

===Aging===

Hypertension can also be age-related when associated with a western diet and lifestyle, and if this is the case, it is likely to be multifactorial. One possible mechanism involves a reduction in vascular compliance due to the stiffening of the arteries. This can build up due to isolated systolic hypertension with a widened pulse pressure. A decrease in glomerular filtration rate is related to aging and this results in decreasing efficiency of sodium excretion. The developing of certain diseases such as renal microvascular disease and capillary rarefaction may relate to this decrease in efficiency of sodium excretion. There is experimental evidence that suggests that renal microvascular disease is an important mechanism for inducing salt-sensitive hypertension.

===Obesity===

Obesity can increase the risk of hypertension to fivefold as compared with normal weight, and up to two-thirds of hypertension cases can be attributed to excess weight. More than 85% of cases occur in those with a Body mass index (BMI) greater than 25. A definitive link between obesity and hypertension has been found using animal and clinical studies; from these it has been realized that many mechanisms are potential causes of obesity-induced hypertension. These mechanisms include the activation of the sympathetic nervous system as well as the activation of the renin–angiotensin–aldosterone system.

===Alcohol===

Excessive alcohol consumption can increase blood pressure over time. Alcohol also contains a high density of calories and may contribute to obesity.

===Renin===
Renin elevation is another risk factor. Renin is an enzyme secreted by the juxtaglomerular apparatus of the kidney and indirectly stimulates the release of aldosterone . Consequently, some hypertensive patients have been defined as having low-renin and others as having essential hypertension. Low-renin hypertension is more common in African Americans than white Americans, and may explain why African Americans tend to respond better to diuretic therapy than drugs that interfere with the renin–angiotensin system.

===Diabetes===
Insulin resistance and/or hyperinsulinemia, can also contribute to hypertension. Insulin is a polypeptide hormone secreted by cells in the islets of Langerhans, which are contained throughout the pancreas. Its main purpose is to regulate the levels of glucose in the body antagonistically with glucagon through negative feedback loops. Insulin resistance can lead to increased arterial stiffening, inappropriate activation of the renin-angiotensin system, and inappropriate activation of the sympathetic nervous system.

===Smoking===

Smoking directly causes a temporary increase in blood pressure through activation of the sympathetic nervous system by nicotine. Chronic tobacco use is also linked to a variety of medical conditions including coronary artery disease, pulmonary disease, cancer, and stroke.

===Vitamin deficiency===

It has been suggested that vitamin D deficiency is associated with cardiovascular risk factors. It has been observed that individuals with a vitamin D deficiency have higher systolic and diastolic blood pressures than average. Vitamin D inhibits renin secretion and its activity, it therefore acts as a &quot;negative endocrine regulator of the renin–angiotensin system&quot;. Hence, a deficiency in vitamin D leads to an increase in renin secretion. This is one possible mechanism of explaining the observed link between hypertension and vitamin D levels in the blood plasma.

Also, some authorities claim that potassium might both prevent and treat hypertension.

===Lack of exercise===

Regular physical exercise reduces blood pressure. The UK National Health Service advises 150 minutes (2 hours and 30 minutes) of moderate-intensity aerobic activity per week to help prevent hypertension.

==Pathophysiology==
Cardiac output and peripheral resistance are the two determinants of arterial pressure and so blood pressure is normally dependent on the balance between cardiac output and peripheral resistance. Cardiac output is determined by stroke volume and heart rate; stroke volume is related to myocardial contractility and to the size of the vascular compartment. Peripheral resistance is determined by functional and anatomic changes in small arteries and arterioles.
The pathophysiology of essential hypertension is an area of research, and until now remains not well understood, but many theories have been proposed to explain this.

What is known is that cardiac output is raised early in the disease course, with total peripheral resistance (TPR) normal; over time cardiac output drops to normal levels but TPR is increased. Three theories have been proposed to explain this:
* An overactive Renin–angiotensin system leads to vasoconstriction and retention of sodium and water. The increase in blood volume leads to hypertension.
* An overactive sympathetic nervous system, leading to increased stress responses.
It is also known that hypertension is highly heritable and polygenic (caused by more than one gene) and a few candidate genes have been postulated in the etiology of this condition.
Essential hypertension can lead to impaired white matter of the brain, which is accompanied by specific cognitive impairment.

==Diagnosis==
For most patients, health care providers diagnose high blood pressure when blood pressure readings are consistently 140/90 mmHg or above. A blood pressure test can be done in a health care provider&#x27;s office or clinic. To track blood pressure readings over a period of time, the health care provider may ask the patient to come into the office on different days and at different times. The health care provider also may ask the patient to check readings at home or at other locations that have blood pressure equipment and to keep a written log of results. The health care provider usually takes 2–3 readings at several medical appointments to diagnose high blood pressure. Using the results of the blood pressure test, the health care provider will diagnose prehypertension or high blood pressure if:
* For an adult, systolic or diastolic readings are consistently higher than 120/80 mmHg.
* A child&#x27;s blood pressure numbers are outside average numbers for children of the same age, gender, and height.

Once the health care provider determines the severity, he or she may order additional tests to determine if the blood pressure is due to other conditions, medications, or if there is primary high blood pressure. Health care providers can use this information to develop a treatment plan.

==History==
Prior to the work of Australian cardiovascular physiologist Paul Korner, in the 1940s, little was known about essential hypertension.

<doc id="841094" wikidata="Q7423908" url="?curid=841094" title="Sarge (TV series)">
<text>Sarge is an American crime drama television series starring George Kennedy. The series aired for one season on NBC from September 1971 to January 1972.

==Overview==
Kennedy stars as Samuel Patrick Cavanaugh, a San Diego police detective sergeant who decides to retire and enter the priesthood after his wife is murdered. Sarge had initially studied for the priesthood prior to his police career, but his seminary studies were interrupted by military service in the Marine Corps during World War II.

The series, which ran in 1971-72, was preceded by a pilot titled &quot;Sarge: The Badge or the Cross&quot; (February 22, 1971 airdate), which set the premise for the subsequent series. One week before the show&#x27;s fall premiere, on September 14, 1971, Cavanaugh traveled to San Francisco because of the death of a friend and fellow priest. His investigation caused him to cross paths with the characters from &quot;Ironside&quot; in a two-hour special that consolidated the two series&#x27; consecutive time slots. This has been subsequently seen as a TV-movie, &quot;The Priest Killer&quot;.

The series was set in San Diego and the pilot movie was filmed primarily on location. However, when the series went into production, episodes were filmed in Los Angeles. The parish church used was St. Peter&#x27;s Italian Catholic Church on North Broadway in Chinatown.

George Kennedy&#x27;s character was originally Sarge Swanson in the pilot movie. Starting with the &quot;Ironside&quot; crossover episode, and for the rest of the series, his last name was changed from Swanson to Cavanaugh. Supporting actor Ramon Bieri played Sarge&#x27;s police contact. In the pilot, his name was Chief Dewey, but was changed to Lt. Barney Verick, chief of detectives, for the series. Sallie Shockley (Valerie) and Harold Sakata (Kenji Takichi) reprised their roles from the pilot movie for the series. Henry Wilcoxon as Bishop Andrade and Dana Elcar as Father Frank Dismore also appeared in the pilot, as well as the series.

==Dan Cooper==
The second episode of &quot;Sarge&quot;, &quot;Ring In, Ring Out&quot;, features a character named Dan Cooper (played by guest star Martin Sheen). It aired on September 28, 1971. On November 24, 1971, a man giving the name Dan Cooper hijacked Flight 305 from Portland, Oregon, to Seattle, Washington. The name the hijacker gave, Dan Cooper, was mistakenly reported in the press as D.B. Cooper. 

==Cast==
* George Kennedy as &quot;Sarge&quot; (Sarge Swanson in the pilot, Samuel Patrick Cavanaugh in the series)
* Sallie Shockley as Valerie
* Ramon Bieri as Chief Dewey (pilot), Lt. Barney Verick (series)
* Harold Sakata as Kenji Takichi

==Episode list==
==Reception==
&quot;Sarge&quot; was well received but ultimately failed by being pitted against CBS&#x27;s &quot;Hawaii Five-O&quot; and &quot;The ABC Tuesday Movie of the Week&quot;.

==Syndication==
Since 1973, episodes have been syndicated under &quot;The Bold Ones&quot; umbrella title, and can be seen on Cozi TV; it was previously seen on the RTV network in selected areas.

==See also==
* Father John Blackwood &quot;Blackie&quot; Ryan - a similar priest character who solves crimes in novels written by Andrew Greeley
* Father Frank Dowling - priest character created by Ralph McInerny who solves crimes in several novels written by McInerny and in the subsequent TV show

<doc id="841095" wikidata="Q2996391" url="?curid=841095" title="Convergence for Social Democracy (Equatorial Guinea)">
<text>Convergence for Social Democracy (, CPDS) is the opposition party in Equatorial Guinea. It was the only opposition party with parliamentary representation during 2013-2017.

==Structure==
The CPDS is headed by a president and a secretary-general, who are currently Santiago Obama Ndong and Andres Esono Ondo, respectively. The Secretary-General is defined as the leader of the party, while the President is assigned the role of a moderator.

==History==
After operating clandestinely and publishing its newspaper &quot;La Verdad&quot; (&quot;The Truth&quot;) in the early 1990s, the CPDS applied for legal recognition in November 1992 and was given legal recognition in February 1993. The party was led and founded by Secundino Oyono Edú-Aguong. The CPDS attributed this recognition to international pressure.

In December 1994, the CPDS held its Constitutive Congress in Bata. The Congress chose Plácido Micó Abogo as Secretary-General at the head of an Executive Commission. The party held its Second National Congress in Bata in February 2001; Plácido Micó Abogo was again chosen as secretary-general. The Third National Congress, held in Bata in February 2005, again chose Plácido Micó Abogo as Secretary-General and elected a National Executive Commission.

Plácido Micó Abogo was the only CPDS candidate to win a seat in the 1999 legislative election. The party&#x27;s candidate in the December 2002 presidential election was Celestino Bonifacio Bacalé, who withdrew from the election along with other opposition candidates due to alleged fraud and intimidation but remained on the ballot and won 2.2% of the vote; President Teodoro Obiang Nguema Mbasogo of the Democratic Party of Equatorial Guinea won 97.1%.

In the April 2004 parliamentary election, the party won two seats in the 100-member Chamber of People&#x27;s Representatives, with CPDS candidates Plácido Micó Abogo and Bacalé winning seats from Malabo. In the May 2008 parliamentary election, it won one out of 100 seats; this seat was won by Plácido Micó Abogo.

Although the Convergence is a legally recognized party, its members are regularly detained and/or tortured by police. The CPDS acquired a radio station in August 2008 and began broadcasting from it in September. The police raided the CPDS headquarters on 13 September 2008, searching for the party&#x27;s radio transmitter, although the police reportedly failed to find the transmitter and only seized electoral campaign material.

The CPDS is a full member of the Socialist International.

<doc id="841096" wikidata="Q2256736" url="?curid=841096" title="Abdominal aortic aneurysm">
<text>Abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA) is a localized enlargement of the abdominal aorta such that the diameter is greater than 3 cm or more than 50% larger than normal. An AAA usually causes no symptoms, except during rupture. Occasionally, abdominal, back, or leg pain may occur. Large aneurysms can sometimes be felt by pushing on the abdomen. Rupture may result in pain in the abdomen or back, low blood pressure, or loss of consciousness, and often results in death.
AAAs occur most commonly in men, those over 50, and those with a family history of the disease. Additional risk factors include smoking, high blood pressure, and other heart or blood vessel diseases. Genetic conditions with an increased risk include Marfan syndrome and Ehlers–Danlos syndrome. AAAs are the most common form of aortic aneurysm. About 85% occur below the kidneys, with the rest either at the level of or above the kidneys. In the United States, screening with abdominal ultrasound is recommended for males between 65 and 75 years of age with a history of smoking. In the United Kingdom and Sweden, screening all men over 65 is recommended. Once an aneurysm is found, further ultrasounds are typically done regularly until an aneurysm meets a threshold for repair.
Abstinence from cigarette smoking is the single best way to prevent the disease. Other methods of prevention include treating high blood pressure, treating high blood cholesterol, and avoiding being overweight. Surgery is usually recommended when the diameter of an AAA grows to &gt;5.5 cm in males and &gt;5.0 cm in females. Other reasons for repair include symptoms and a rapid increase in size, defined as more than one centimeter per year. Repair may be either by open surgery or endovascular aneurysm repair (EVAR). As compared to open surgery, EVAR has a lower risk of death in the short term and a shorter hospital stay, but may not always be an option. There does not appear to be a difference in longer-term outcomes between the two. Repeat procedures are more common with EVAR.
AAAs affect 2-8% of males over the age of 65. They are five times more common in men. In those with an aneurysm less than 5.5 cm, the risk of rupture in the next year is below 1%. Among those with an aneurysm between 5.5 and 7 cm, the risk is about 10%, while for those with an aneurysm greater than 7 cm the risk is about 33%. Mortality if ruptured is 85% to 90%. Globally, aortic aneurysms resulted in 168,200 deaths in 2013, up from 100,000 in 1990. In the United States AAAs resulted in between 10,000 and 18,000 deaths in 2009.
==Signs and symptoms==

The vast majority of aneurysms are asymptomatic. However, as the abdominal aorta expands and/or ruptures, the aneurysm may become painful and lead to pulsating sensations in the abdomen or pain in the chest, lower back, legs, or scrotum.

===Complications===
The complications include rupture, peripheral embolization, acute aortic occlusion, and aortocaval (between the aorta and inferior vena cava) or aortoduodenal (between the aorta and the duodenum) fistulae. On physical examination, a palpable and pulsatile abdominal mass can be noted. Bruits can be present in case of renal or visceral arterial stenosis.

The signs and symptoms of a ruptured AAA may include severe pain in the lower back, flank, abdomen, or groin. A mass that pulses with the heartbeat may also be felt. The bleeding can lead to a hypovolemic shock with low blood pressure and a fast heart rate, which may cause fainting. The mortality of AAA rupture is as high as 90 percent. 65 to 75 percent of patients die before they arrive at the hospital and up to 90 percent die before they reach the operating room. The bleeding can be or into the abdominal cavity. Rupture can also create a connection between the aorta and intestine or inferior vena cava. Flank ecchymosis (appearance of a bruise) is a sign of retroperitoneal bleeding and is also called Grey Turner&#x27;s sign.

==Causes==
The exact causes of the degenerative process remain unclear. There are, however, some hypotheses and well-defined risk factors.
* Tobacco smoking: More than 90% of people who develop an AAA have smoked at some point in their lives.
* Alcohol and hypertension: The inflammation caused by prolonged use of alcohol and hypertensive effects from abdominal edema which leads to hemorrhoids, esophageal varices, and other conditions, is also considered a long-term cause of AAA.
* Genetic influences: The influence of genetic factors is high. AAA is four to six times more common in male siblings of known patients, with a risk of 20–30%. The high familial prevalence rate is most notable in male individuals. There are many hypotheses about the exact genetic disorder that could cause a higher incidence of AAA among male members of the affected families. Some have presumed that the influence of alpha 1-antitrypsin deficiency could be crucial, while other experimental works favor the hypothesis of X-linked mutation, which would explain the lower incidence in heterozygous females. Other hypotheses of genetic causes have also been formulated. Connective tissue disorders, such as Marfan syndrome and Ehlers-Danlos syndrome, have also been strongly associated with AAA. Both relapsing polychondritis and pseudoxanthoma elasticum may cause abdominal aortic aneurysm.
* Atherosclerosis: The AAA was long considered to be caused by atherosclerosis because the walls of the AAA frequently carry an atherosclerotic burden. However, this hypothesis cannot explain the initial defect and the development of occlusion, which is observed in the process. Another hypothesis is that plaque buildup can cause a feed-forward dysfunction in the signaling among neurons that regulate pressure in the aorta. This feed-forward process leads to an over-pressuring condition that ruptures the aorta.
* Other causes of the development of AAA include: infection, trauma, arteritis, and cystic medial necrosis.

==Pathophysiology==
The most striking histopathological changes of the aneurysmatic aorta are seen in the tunica media and intima layers. These changes include the accumulation of lipids in foam cells, extracellular free cholesterol crystals, calcifications, thrombosis, and ulcerations and ruptures of the layers. Adventitial inflammatory infiltrate is present.
However, the degradation of the tunica media by means of a proteolytic process seems to be the basic pathophysiologic mechanism of AAA development. Some researchers report increased expression and activity of matrix metalloproteinases in individuals with AAA. This leads to the elimination of elastin from the media, rendering the aortic wall more susceptible to the influence of blood pressure. Other reports have suggested the serine protease granzyme B may contribute to aortic aneurysm rupture through the cleavage of decorin, leading to disrupted collagen organization and reduced tensile strength of the adventitia. There is also a reduced amount of vasa vasorum in the abdominal aorta (compared to the thoracic aorta); consequently, the tunica media must rely mostly on diffusion for nutrition, which makes it more susceptible to damage.

Hemodynamics affect the development of AAA, which has a for the aorta. The histological structure and mechanical characteristics of the infrarenal aorta differ from those of the thoracic aorta. The diameter decreases from the root to the aortic bifurcation, and the wall of the infrarenal aorta also contains a lesser proportion of elastin. The mechanical tension in the abdominal aortic wall is therefore higher than in the thoracic aortic wall. The elasticity and also decline with age, which can result in gradual of the segment. Higher intraluminal pressure in patients with arterial hypertension markedly contributes to the progression of the pathological process. Suitable hemodynamic conditions may be linked to specific intraluminal thrombus (ILT) patterns along the aortic lumen, which in turn may affect AAA&#x27;s development.

==Diagnosis==
An abdominal aortic aneurysm is usually diagnosed by physical exam, abdominal ultrasound, or CT scan. Plain abdominal radiographs may show the outline of an aneurysm when its walls are calcified. However, the outline will be visible by X-ray in less than half of all aneurysms. Ultrasonography is used to screen for aneurysms and to determine their size if present. Additionally, free peritoneal fluid can be detected. It is non-invasive and sensitive, but the presence of bowel gas or obesity may limit its usefulness. CT scan has nearly 100% sensitivity for an aneurysm and is also useful in preoperative planning, detailing the anatomy and possibility for endovascular repair. In the case of suspected rupture, it can also reliably detect retroperitoneal fluid. Alternative less often used methods for visualization of an aneurysm include MRI and angiography.

An aneurysm ruptures if the mechanical stress (tension per area) exceeds the local wall strength; consequently, peak wall stress (PWS), mean wall stress (MWS), and peak wall rupture risk (PWRR) are more reliable parameters than diameter to assess AAA rupture risk. Medical software allows computing these rupture risk indices from standard clinical CT data and provides a patient-specific AAA rupture risk diagnosis. This type of biomechanical approach has been shown to accurately predict the location of AAA rupture.

===Classification===

Abdominal aortic aneurysms are commonly divided according to their size and symptomatology. An aneurysm is usually defined as an outer aortic diameter over 3 cm (normal diameter of the aorta is around 2 cm), or more than 50% of normal diameter. If the outer diameter exceeds 5.5 cm, the aneurysm is considered to be large. Ruptured AAA should be suspected in any person older than 60 who experiences collapse, unexplained low blood pressure, or sudden-onset back or abdominal pain. Abdominal pain, shock, and a pulsatile mass are only present in a minority of cases. Although an unstable person with a known aneurysm may undergo surgery without further imaging, the diagnosis will usually be confirmed using CT or ultrasound scanning.

The suprarenal aorta normally measures about 0.5 cm larger than the infrarenal aorta.

===Differential diagnosis===
Aortic aneurysm rupture may be mistaken for the pain of kidney stones, or muscle related back pain.

==Prevention==
In terms of prevention, the following are effective measures to reduce the risk of developing a AAA:
* Smoking cessation
* Treatment of hypertension

==Screening==
The U.S. Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF) recommends a single screening abdominal ultrasound for abdominal aortic aneurysm in males aged 65 to 75 years who have a history of smoking. Among this group who does not smoke, screening may be selective. It is unclear if screening is useful in women who have smoked and the USPSTF recommends against screening in women who have never smoked.

In the United Kingdom, the NHS AAA Screening Programme invites men in England for screening during the year they turn 65. Men over 65 can contact the programme to arrange to be screened.

In Sweden one time screening is recommended in all males over 65 years of age. This has been found to decrease the risk of death from AAA by 42% with a number needed to screen just over 200. In those with a close relative diagnosed with an aortic aneurysm, Swedish guidelines recommend an ultrasound at around 60 years of age.

Australia has no guideline on screening.

Repeat ultrasounds should be carried out in those who have an aortic size greater than 3.0 cm. In those whose aorta is between 3.0 and 3.9 cm this should be every three years, if between 4.0 and 4.4 cm every two years, and if between 4.5 and 5.4 cm every year.

==Management==
The treatment options for asymptomatic AAA are management, surveillance with a view to eventual repair, and immediate repair. Two modes of repair are available for an AAA: open aneurysm repair, and endovascular aneurysm repair (EVAR). An intervention is often recommended if the aneurysm grows more than 1 cm per year or it is bigger than 5.5 cm. Repair is also indicated for symptomatic aneurysms. Ten years after open AAA repair, the overall survival rate was 59%. Mycotic abdominal aorta aneurysm (MAAA) is a rare and life-threatening condition. Because of its rarity, there is a lack of adequately powered studies and consensus on its treatment and follow-up. A management protocol on the management of mycotic abdominal aortic aneurysm was recently published in the Annals of Vascular Surgery by Premnath et al.

===Conservative===
Conservative management is indicated in people where repair carries a high mortality risk and in patients where repair is unlikely to improve life expectancy. The mainstay of the conservative treatment is smoking cessation.

Surveillance is indicated in small asymptomatic aneurysms (less than 5.5 cm) where the risk of repair exceeds the risk of rupture. As an AAA grows in diameter, the risk of rupture increases. Surveillance until an aneurysm has reached a diameter of 5.5 cm has not been shown to have a higher risk as compared to early intervention.

===Medication===
No medical therapy is effective at decreasing the growth rate or rupture rate of asymptomatic AAAs. Blood pressure and lipids should, however, be treated per usual.

===Surgery===
The threshold for repair varies slightly from individual to individual, depending on the balance of risks and benefits when considering repair versus ongoing surveillance. The size of an individual&#x27;s native aorta may influence this, along with the presence of comorbidities that increase operative risk or decrease life expectancy. Evidence, however, does not usually support repair if the size is less than 5.5 cm.

====Open repair====

Open repair is indicated in young patients as an elective procedure, or in growing or large, symptomatic or ruptured aneurysms. The aorta must be clamped during the repair, denying blood to the abdominal organs and sections of the spinal cord; this can cause a range of complications. As it is essential to perform the critical part of the operation quickly, the incision is typically made large enough to facilitate the fastest repair. Recovery after open AAA surgery takes significant time. The minimums are a few days in intensive care, a week total in the hospital, and a few months before full recovery.

====Endovascular repair====
Endovascular repair first became practical in the 1990s and although it is now an established alternative to open repair, its role is yet to be clearly defined. It is generally indicated in older, high-risk patients or patients unfit for open repair. However, endovascular repair is feasible for only a portion of AAAs, depending on the morphology of the aneurysm. The main advantages over open repair are that there is less peri-operative mortality, less time in intensive care, less time in hospital overall, and an earlier return to normal activity. Disadvantages of endovascular repair include a requirement for more frequent ongoing hospital reviews and a higher chance of further required procedures. According to the latest studies, the EVAR procedure does not offer any benefit for overall survival or health-related quality of life compared to open surgery, although aneurysm-related mortality is lower. In patients unfit for open repair, EVAR plus conservative management was associated with no benefit, more complications, subsequent procedures and higher costs compared to conservative management alone. Endovascular treatment for paraanastomotic aneurysms after aortobiiliac reconstruction is also a possibility. A 2017 Cochrane review found tentative evidence of no difference in outcomes between endovascular and open repair of ruptured AAA in the first month.

===Rupture===
In those with aortic rupture of the AAA, treatment is immediate surgical repair. There appear to be benefits to allowing permissive hypotension and limiting the use of intravenous fluids during transport to the operating room.

==Prognosis==

Although the current standard of determining rupture risk is based on maximum diameter, it is known that smaller AAAs that fall below this threshold (diameter&lt;5.5 cm) may also rupture, and larger AAAs (diameter&gt;5.5 cm) may remain stable. In one report, it was shown that 10–24% of ruptured AAAs were less than 5 cm in diameter. It has also been reported that of 473 non-repaired AAAs examined from autopsy reports, there were 118 cases of rupture, 13% of which were less than 5 cm in diameter. This study also showed that 60% of the AAAs greater than 5 cm (including 54% of those AAAs between 7.1 and 10 cm) never experienced rupture. Vorp &quot;et al.&quot; later deduced from the findings of Darling &quot;et al.&quot; that if the maximum diameter criterion were followed for the 473 subjects, only 7% (34/473) of cases would have died from rupture before surgical intervention as the diameter was less than 5 cm, with 25% (116/473) of cases possibly undergoing unnecessary surgery since these AAAs may never have ruptured.

Alternative methods of rupture assessment have been recently reported. The majority of these approaches involve the numerical analysis of AAAs using the common engineering technique of the finite element method (FEM) to determine the wall stress distributions. Recent reports have shown that these stress distributions have been shown to correlate to the overall geometry of the AAA rather than solely to the maximum diameter. It is also known that wall stress alone does not completely govern failure as an AAA will usually rupture when the wall stress exceeds the wall strength. In light of this, rupture assessment may be more accurate if the patient-specific wall stress is coupled together with patient-specific wall strength. A noninvasive method of determining patient-dependent wall strength was recently reported, with more traditional approaches to strength determination via tensile testing performed by other researchers in the field. Some of the more recently proposed AAA rupture-risk assessment methods include: AAA wall stress; AAA expansion rate; degree of asymmetry; presence of intraluminal thrombus (ILT); a rupture potential index (RPI); a finite element analysis rupture index (FEARI); biomechanical factors coupled with computer analysis; growth of ILT; geometrical parameters of the AAA; and also a method of determining AAA growth and rupture based on mathematical models.

The postoperative mortality for an already ruptured AAA has slowly decreased over several decades but remains higher than 40%. However, if the AAA is surgically repaired before rupture, the postoperative mortality rate is substantially lower, approximately 1-6%.

==Epidemiology==
The occurrence of AAA varies by ethnicity. In the United Kingdom, the rate of AAA in Caucasian men older than 65 years is about 4.7%, while in Asian men it is 0.45%. It is also less common in individuals of African, and Hispanic heritage. They occur four times more often in men than in women.

There are at least 13,000 deaths yearly in the U.S. secondary to AAA rupture. The peak number of new cases per year among males is around 70 years of age, and the percentage of males affected over 60 years is 2–6%. The frequency is much higher in smokers than in non-smokers (8:1), and the risk decreases slowly after smoking cessation. In the U.S., the incidence of AAA is 2–4% in the adult population.

Rupture of the AAA occurs in 1–3% of men aged 65 or more, for whom the mortality rate is 70–95%.

==History==
The first historical records about AAA are from Ancient Rome in the 2nd century AD, when Greek surgeon Antyllus tried to treat the AAA with proximal and distal ligature, central incision and removal of thrombotic material from the aneurysm.
However, attempts to treat the AAA surgically were unsuccessful until 1923. In that year, Rudolph Matas (who also proposed the concept of endoaneurysmorrhaphy), performed the first successful aortic ligation on a human. Other methods that were successful in treating the AAA included wrapping the aorta with polyethene cellophane, which induced fibrosis and restricted the growth of the aneurysm. Endovascular aneurysm repair was first performed in the late 1980s and has been widely adopted in the subsequent decades. Endovascular repair was first used for treating a ruptured aneurysm in Nottingham in 1994.

==Society and culture==

Theoretical physicist Albert Einstein underwent an operation for an abdominal aortic aneurysm in 1949 that was performed by Rudolph Nissen, who wrapped the aorta with polyethylene cellophane. Einstein&#x27;s aneurysm ruptured on April 13, 1955. He declined surgery, saying, &quot;I want to go when I want. It is tasteless to prolong life artificially. I have done my share, it is time to go. I will do it elegantly.&quot; He died five days later at age 76.

Actress Lucille Ball died on April 26, 1989, from an abdominal aortic aneurysm. At the time of her death, she was in Cedars-Sinai Medical Center recovering from emergency surgery performed just six days earlier because of a dissecting aortic aneurysm near her heart. Ball was at increased risk as she had been a heavy smoker for decades.

Musician Conway Twitty died in June 1993 from an abdominal aortic aneurysm at the age of 59, two months before the release of what would be his final studio album, &quot;Final Touches&quot;.

Actor George C. Scott died in 1999, aged 71, from a ruptured abdominal aortic aneurysm.

In 2001, former presidential candidate Bob Dole underwent surgery for an abdominal aortic aneurysm in which a team led by vascular surgeon Kenneth Ouriel inserted a stent graft:


Actor Robert Jacks, who played Leatherface in &quot;Texas Chainsaw Massacre: The Next Generation&quot;, died from an abdominal aneurysm on August 8, 2001, one day shy of his 42nd birthday. When Jacks was a child, his father died from the same cause.

Actor Tommy Ford died of abdominal aneurysm in October 2016 at 52 years old.

Gary Gygax, co-creator of &quot;Dungeons &amp; Dragons&quot;, died from an abdominal aortic aneurysm in 2008, at the age of 69.

Harvey Korman died on May 29, 2008, aged 81, at UCLA Medical Center as the result of complications from a ruptured abdominal aortic aneurysm he had suffered four months earlier. He is interred at Santa Monica&#x27;s Woodlawn Cemetery.

==Research==

===Risk assessment===
There have been many calls for alternative approaches to rupture risk assessment over the past number of years, with many believing that a biomechanics-based approach may be more suitable than the current diameter approach. Numerical modeling is a valuable tool to researchers allowing approximate wall stresses to be calculated, thus revealing the rupture potential of a particular aneurysm. Experimental models are required to validate these numerical results and provide further insight into the biomechanical behavior of the AAA. &quot;In vivo&quot;, AAAs exhibit a varying range of material strengths from localised weak hypoxic regions to much stronger regions and areas of calcifications.

Finding ways to predict future AAA growth is seen as a research priority.

Another related line of research is utilizing mathematical decision modeling (e.g., Markov decision processes) to determine improved treatment policies. Initial results suggest that a more dynamic policy could provide benefits, although such claims have not been clinically verified. A study recently showed that aneurysms can be accurately predicted as to whether they are stable (lacking repair or intervention), requiring repair, or at risk of rupture from scans years prior to any event based on a machine-learning based classification tool.

===Experimental models===
Experimental models can now be manufactured using a novel technique involving the injection-moulding lost-wax manufacturing process to create patient-specific anatomically correct AAA replicas. Work has also focused on developing more realistic material analogues to those &quot;in vivo&quot;, and recently a novel range of silicone-rubbers was created allowing the varying material properties of the AAA to be more accurately represented. These rubber models can also be used in a variety of experimental situations, from stress analysis using the photoelastic method New endovascular devices are being developed that are able to treat more complex and anatomies.

===Prevention and treatment===
An animal study showed that removing a single protein prevents early damage in blood vessels from triggering a later-stage, frequently lethal complication. By eliminating the gene for a signaling protein called cyclophilin A (CypA) from a strain of mice, researchers were able to provide complete protection against abdominal aortic aneurysm.

Other recent research identified Granzyme B (GZMB) (a protein-degrading enzyme) to be a potential target in the treatment of abdominal aortic aneurysms. Elimination of this enzyme in mice models both slowed the progression of aneurysms and improved survival.

=== Preclinical Research ===
The mechanisms that lead to AAA development are still not completely understood at a cellular and molecular level. To better understand the pathophysiology of AAA, it is often necessary to use experimental animal models. It is often questioned how well these models translate to human disease. Even though no animal model exactly represents the human condition, all the existing ones focus on one different pathophysiological aspect of the disease. Combining the results from different animal models with clinical research can provide a better overview of the AAA pathophysiology. The most common animal models are rodents (mice and rats), although, for certain studies, such as testing preclinical devices or surgical procedures, large animal models (pig, sheep) are more frequently used. The rodent models of AAA can be classified according to different aspects. There are dissecting models vs non-dissecting models and genetically determined models vs chemically induced models. The most commonly used models are the angiotensin-II infusion into ApoE knockout mice (dissecting model, chemically induced), the calcium chloride model (non-dissecting, chemically induced), and the elastase model (non-dissecting, chemically induced model). A recent study has shown that β-Aminopropionitrile plus elastase application to abdominal aorta causes more severe aneurysm in mice as compared to elastase alone.

<doc id="841098" wikidata="Q3616648" url="?curid=841098" title="Thoracic aortic aneurysm">
<text>A thoracic aortic aneurysm is an aortic aneurysm that presents primarily in the thorax.

A thoracic aortic aneurysm is the &quot;ballooning&quot; of the upper aspect of the aorta, above the diaphragm. Untreated or unrecognized they can be fatal due to dissection or &quot;popping&quot; of the aneurysm leading to nearly instant death. Thoracic aneurysms are less common than an abdominal aortic aneurysm. However, a syphilitic aneurysm is more likely to be a thoracic aortic aneurysm than an abdominal aortic aneurysm. This condition is commonly treated via a specialized multidisciplinary approach with both vascular surgeons and cardiac surgeons.

==Presentation==
===Complications===

The principal causes of death due to thoracic aneurysmal disease are dissection and rupture. Once rupture occurs, the mortality rate is 50–80%. Most deaths in patients with Marfan syndrome are the result of aortic disease.

==Causes==
There are a number of causes, Aneurysms in patients younger than 40 usually involve the ascending aorta due to a weakening of the aortic wall associated with connective tissue disorders like the Marfan and Ehlers-Danlos syndromes or congenital bicuspid aortic valve. Younger patients may develop aortic aneurysms of the thoracoabdominal aorta after an aortic dissection. It can also be caused by blunt injury. Atherosclerosis is the principal cause of descending aortic aneurysms, while aneurysms of the aortic arch may be due to dissection, atherosclerosis, or inflammation.

===Age===
The diagnosis of thoracic aortic aneurysm usually involves patients in their 60s and 70s.

==Risk factors==
Hypertension and cigarette smoking are the most important risk factors, though the importance of genetic factors has been increasingly recognized. Approximately 10 percent of patients may have other family members who have aortic aneurysms. It is also important to note that individuals with a history of aneurysms in other parts of the body have a higher chance of developing a thoracic aortic aneurysm.

==Diagnosis==

Thoracic aortic aneurysm is defined as a cross-sectional diameter exceeding the following cutoff:
* 4.5 cm in the United States
* 4.0 cm in South Korea

A diameter of 3.5 cm is generally considered dilated. However, average values vary with age and size of the reference population, as well as different segments of the aorta.
==Screening==
Guidelines were issued in March 2010 for early detection of thoracic aortic disease, by the American College of Cardiology, the American Heart Association, and other groups. Among the recommendations:
* First-degree relatives of people with thoracic aortic aneurysm or dissection should have aortic imaging to identify asymptomatic disease.
* People with symptoms suggestive of thoracic aortic dissection should be routinely evaluated &quot;to establish a pretest risk of disease that can then be used to guide diagnostic decisions.&quot;
* People diagnosed with Marfan syndrome should immediately have an echocardiogram to measure the aorta and followed up six months later to check for aortic enlargement.

==Treatment==

The size cut off for aortic aneurysm is crucial to its treatment. A thoracic aorta greater than 4.5 cm is generally defined as aneurysmal, while a size greater than 5.5 cm is the distinction for treatment, which can be either endovascular or surgical, with the former reserved for pathology at the descending aorta.

Indication for surgery may depend upon the size of the aneurysm. Aneurysms in the ascending aorta may require surgery at a smaller size than aneurysms in the descending aorta.

Treatment may be via open or via endovascular means. Open surgical repair remains the gold standard for thoracoabdominal aortic aneurysm treatment, particularly in patients with connective tissues disease. Rates of postoperative spinal cord ischaemia can be kept at low levels after open surgical repair with the adequate precautions and perioperative maneuvers.

== Epidemiology ==
Each year in the United States, some 45,000 people die from diseases of the aorta and its branches. Acute aortic dissection, a life-threatening event due to a tear in the aortic wall, affects 5 to 10 patients per million population each year, most often men between the ages of 50 and 70; of those that occur in women younger than 40, nearly half arise during pregnancy. The majority of these deaths occur as a result of complications of thoracic aneurysmal disease

<doc id="841099" wikidata="Q371319" url="?curid=841099" title="Ardashir I">
<text>Ardashir I (), also known as Ardashir the Unifier (180–242 AD), was the founder of the Sasanian Empire, the last empire of ancient Iran. He was also Ardashir V of the Kings of Persis, until he founded the new empire. After defeating the last Parthian shahanshah Artabanus IV on the Hormozdgan plain in 224, he overthrew the Arsacid dynasty and established the Sasanian dynasty. Afterwards, Ardashir called himself &quot;shahanshah&quot; and began conquering the land that he called &quot;Eranshahr&quot;, the realm of the Iranians.

There are various historical reports about Ardashir&#x27;s lineage and ancestry. According to al-Tabari&#x27;s &quot;History of the Prophets and Kings&quot;, Ardashir was son of Papak, son of Sasan. Another narrative recorded in &quot;Kar-Namag i Ardashir i Pabagan&quot; and Ferdowsi&#x27;s &quot;Shahnameh&quot; states that Ardashir was born from the marriage of Sasan, a descendant of Darius III, with the daughter of Papak, a local governor in Pars.

According to al-Tabari&#x27;s report, Ardashir was born in the outskirts of Istakhr, Pars. Al-Tabari adds that Ardashir was sent to the lord of Fort Darabgard when he was seven years old. After the lord&#x27;s death, Ardashir succeeded him and became the commander of Fort Darabgard. Afterwards, Papak overthrew the local Persian shah named Gochihr and appointed his son, Shapur, instead of him. Shapur and his father, Papak, suddenly died and Ardashir became the ruler of Pars. Tension rose between Ardashir and the Parthian empire, and eventually on April 28, 224, Ardashir faced the army of Artabanus IV in the Hormozdgan plain, where the Parthian shahanshah was defeated and killed in battle.

According to the royal reports, it was Papak who overthrew Gochihr, the local Persian shah, and appointed his son, Shapur, instead of him; Ardashir refused to accept Shapur&#x27;s appointment and removed his brother and whosoever stood against him and then minted coins with his face drawn on and his father, Papak&#x27;s behind. It is probable that the determining role that is stated about Ardashir in leading the rebellion against the central government is the product of the later historical studies. Papak had probably united most of Pars under his rule by then.

Ardashir had an outstanding role in developing the royal ideology. He tried to show himself as a worshiper of Mazda and a descendant of the gods who possesses &quot;khvarenah&quot;, the divine royal glory attributed to kings in Zoroastrianism. In order to legitimize his rule and delegitimize that of the Parthians, he claimed descent from mythical Iranian shahs and presented himself as a continuator of the Achaemenids, the creators of the first Persian empire, although the current belief is that the early Sasanians did not know much about the history of the Achaemenids. On the other hand, some historians believe that the first Sasanian shahanshahs were familiar with the Achaemenids and their successors deliberately turned to the legendary Kayanians. They knowingly ignored the Achaemenids in order to attribute their past to the Kayanians; and that was where they applied holy historiography.

In order to remark his victories, Ardashir carved petroglyphs in Firuzabad (the city of Gor or Ardashir-Khwarrah), Naqsh-e Rajab and Naqsh-e Rustam. In his petroglyph in Naqsh-e Rustam, Ardashir and Ahura Mazda are opposite to each other on horsebacks and the corpses of Artabanus and Ahriman are visualized under the hooves of the horses of Ardashir and Ahura Mazda. It can be deduced from the picture that Ardashir assumed or wished for others to assume that his rule over the land that was called &quot;Iran&quot; in the inscriptions was designated by the lord. The word &quot;Iran&quot; was previously used in &quot;Avesta&quot; and as &quot;the name of the mythical land of the Aryans&quot;. In Ardashir&#x27;s period, the title &quot;Iran&quot; was chosen for the region under the Sasanian rule. The idea of &quot;Iran&quot; was accepted for both the Zoroastrian and non-Zoroastrian societies in the whole kingdom and the Iranians&#x27; collective memory continued and lived on in the various stages and different layers of the Iranian society until the modern period today. What is clear is that the concept of &quot;Iran&quot; previously had a religious and ethnic application and then ended up creating its political face and the concept of a geographical collection of lands.

== Etymology ==
&quot;Ardashir&quot; is the New Persian form of the Middle Persian name , which is ultimately from Old Iranian &quot;*Artaxšaθra-&quot;, equivalent to Greek &quot;Artaxérxēs&quot; (), and Armenian &quot;Artašēs&quot; (). Literally, Ardashir means &quot;the one whose reign is based on honesty and justice&quot;. The first part of &quot;*Arta-xšaθra-&quot; is adapted from the religious concept of justice known as Ṛta or Asha and the second part is related to the concept &quot;city&quot; and &quot;kingdom&quot;.

Three of Achaemenid kings of kings and four of the local Shahs of Pars—known as Frataraka and Kings of Persis—were named Ardashir, and Ardashir I has been Ardashir V in the chain of local Shahs.

== Historiography ==
The primary references of the Sassanian era can be divided to the two categories &quot;text remnants&quot; and &quot;reports&quot;:

=== Text remnants ===
Text remnants include inscriptions, leather writings, papyri and crockeries written in multiple languages and scripts. Examples of text remnants related to Ardashir I include his short inscription in Naqsh-e Rajab and also Shapur I&#x27;s inscription at the Ka&#x27;ba-ye Zartosht.

=== Reports ===
Reports are texts that are written in various languages and periods. The basis of the writings of all Muslim historians (Arabic and Persian histories), has been the official &quot;Khwaday-Namag&quot; of the Sassanian court that have utilized the recorded diaries in the official calendars of the court as references. Khwaday-Namag was prepared at the end of the Sassanian era in Middle Persian. The title of the Arabic translation of the book was &quot;Seir-ol Moluk-el Ajam&quot; and the Persian version was &quot;Shahnameh&quot;. Today, none of the direct translations of &quot;Khwaday-Namag&quot; or its original Persian text are available.

==== Greek-Roman ====
Cassius Dio is one of the resources of Parthian history that has given a report about the downfall of the Parthians and the rise of Ardashir I.

Herodian&#x27;s &quot;History&quot; has also extensively explained the procedure of the change of monarchy from Parthian to Sassanian.

Although Agathias lived during the time of Khosrow I, due to his access to the royal yearbooks in Ctesiphon archives, his history book is one of the main sources. However, he has used colloquial statements in reporting the story of Ardashir&#x27;s youth.

==== Armenian ====
The Armenian history in the Sassanian era is completely connected with Iranian royal history; thus, not only do the writings of then Armenian historians provide important matters about the adventures of Iranian kings of kings, but show the status of Iran-Armenia relations. &quot;Armenian History&quot; by Agathangelos is one of Armenian resources about the early Sassanian era.

Movses Khorenatsi, known as the Armenian Herodotus, an historian of the fifth century AD has stated a story about Ardashir I that is relatively similar to the adapted story from the biography of Cyrus the Great.

==== Syriac ====
Another class of Sasanian history references is the books written by Christians in Syriac language.

&quot;Arbella&#x27;s Chronicles&quot; is a text written in mid-sixth century AD and includes the history of Christian regions of Mesopotamia from the second century until 550. The book is very valuable for the period of the downfall of the Parthians and the rise of the Sasanians.

&quot;History of Odessa&quot; is a book written in 540 and includes chronicles from 132 BC until 540.

&quot;Chronicles of Karakh Beit Solug&quot;, is a short but important source that presents valuable information about the early Sasanian period.

==== Middle Persian ====
&quot;Kār-Nāmag ī Ardašīr ī Pābagān&quot; is an epic story about Ardashir I and the procedure of his ascension to the throne of Iran. The text was written in about 600 AD and in the end of Sasanian era in Middle Persian language.

==== New Persian ====
Ferdowsi&#x27;s Shahnameh is the largest and most important reference about the reports related to the national Iranian history. It presents helpful information about the Sasanian organizations and civilization.

&quot;Bal&#x27;ami&#x27;s History&quot;, which is a Persian rewrite of Tabari&#x27;s History, is one of the most important Persian prose works about the Sasanians. Apart from the Arabic text, the work is valuable, since it provides the Persian equals of Arabic expressions in Tabari&#x27;s History.

&quot;Farsnameh&quot; is one of the helpful Persian references about Sasanian history that presents valuable information about the status and the rankings of grand appointed governors and their positions, while they were considered part of the public relative to the kings.

Ibn Isfandiyar&#x27;s &quot;History of Tabaristan&quot; is another one of Sasanian history sources. The Letter of Tansar is written in the book.

Mojmal al-tawarikh is a text with limited value, since most of its reports are mentioned extensively in other sources.

&quot;Ardasgir&#x27;s Oath&quot; is a letter or preach by Ardashir I about government rituals that is named in &quot;Mojmal al-tawarikh&quot;.

==== Arabic ====
&quot;Tabari&#x27;s History&quot; is a book series in Arabic that is the main and essential source about Sasanian history.

Al-Masudi&#x27;s &quot;The Meadows of Gold&quot; is another source about the Sasanian history.

== Lineage and ancestry ==

There are different historical reports about Ardashir&#x27;s ancestry and lineage. According to Al-Tabari&#x27;s report, Ardashir was son of Papak, son of Sasan. Another statement that exists in &quot;Kar-Namag i Ardashir i Pabagan&quot; and is told the same way in Ferdowsi&#x27;s &quot;Shahnameh&quot;, states that Ardashir was born as a result of the marriage of Sasan, a descendant of Darius III, with the daughter of Papak, a local governor in the province of Pars. In &quot;Kar-Namag i Ardashir i Pabagan&quot;, which was written after him, Ardashir is announced &quot;a Papakan king with a paternal line from Sasan and a maternal line from Darius III&quot;. Daryaee intends to say that according to that line in the text, it can be deduced that Ardashir has claimed his lineage to whoever he could. Relating Ardashir to the legendary Kayanians with the nickname Kay beside connecting himself to Sasan, who has been a guardian and mysterious deity and also to Dara, which is a combination of Darius I and II the Achaemenid with local Persian shahs Dara I and II, shows the former&#x27;s fake lineage.

Since Ardashir had claimed his royal lineage to Sasan, it is important to inspect who Sasan was. First it was composed that the epigraphic form &quot;Ssn&quot; on potterywares and other documents imply that Sasan was a Zoroastrian deity, though he is not mentioned in Avesta or other ancient Iranian texts. Martin Schwartz has recently shown that the deity shown on the potterywares is not related to Sasan, but shows Ssn, an old Semitic goddess that was worshiped in Ugarit in the second millennium B.C. The word &quot;Sasa&quot; is written on coins found in Taxila; it is probable to be related to &quot;Sasan&quot;, since the symbols on the mentioned coins are similar to the coins of Shapur I. It is remarked in Ferdowsi&#x27;s &quot;Shahnameh&quot; about Sasan&#x27;s Oriental lineage that might imply that his house had come from the Orient. After all and considering all the difficulties, it can be said that Ardashir claimed his lineage to be belonging to gods and the Sasanians may have raised Sasan&#x27;s rank to a god&#x27;s. The primary Islamic sources, which are adapted from Sasanian statements, have emphasized on Sasan being a mysticist and hermit and have actually stated India, which is the center of asceticism, as Sasan&#x27;s origin. That was the only way for Ardashir to forge himself a double noble-religious lineage. It is not strange that Ardashir&#x27;s religious lineage is emphasized in religious Sasanian statements and his noble lineage is emphasized in royal reports and then they are linked to religious statements about him. Anyway, whoever Sasan was and wherever he lived, he was not a native Persian and the eastern and western Iranian Plateau are mentioned as his origins in the references.
Most of foreign sources are unanimous in considering an unknown lineage for Ardashir; for example, Agathias has stated that Papak was a shoemaker who found out from astronomic proofs that Sasan would have a great son; thus Papak allowed Sasan to sleep with the former&#x27;s wife and the result was Ardashir. Shakki considered Agathias&#x27;s narrative a useless and vulgar story by the familiar Sergeus, Surianian translator of Khosrow I&#x27;s court, ordered by the opponents and foes of Sasanians. Shakki said it was obvious Sergeus the Christian had induced that nonsense to Agathias. Like he had cleared Ardashir&#x27;s family tree, and it was adapted from the imaginations of Christians and the materialist and atheist league. Shakki&#x27;s reasoning is based on the current norm in marital customs that the children resulting from a woman&#x27;s marriage with a second spouse (after divorcing her first spouse) will belong to the first spouse. In the three-language inscription of Shapur I&#x27;s on Ka&#x27;ba-ye Zartosht in Naqsh-e Rustam, Sasan is introduced only as a nobleman and Papak as a king.

There are opinions about the validity and authenticity of each of the mentioned narratives. Some have considered Al-Tabari&#x27;s report suspicious since he presents an elaborate family tree of Ardashir that relates his generation to mythical and mighty ancient Iranian kings. Some consider the reports of &quot;Karnamag&quot; and &quot;Shahnameh&quot; more justifiable, since Ardashir being Sasan&#x27;s son and his adoption by Papak aligns with Zoroastrian norms and customs. However, some have questioned the reports of &quot;Karnamag&quot; and &quot;Shahnameh&quot;, considered them mythical and intended to legitimize the founder of the Sasanian dynasty.

Due to the high number of reports about Ardashir&#x27;s lineage, it is not easy to accept any; though it should not be ignored that most of the founders of dynasties claimed to be descendants of ancient kings in order to become legitimate. About that, Daryaee says: &quot;If Ardashir had been evolved from a noble house, he would have insisted on a report; while various stories show that he intended to gain legitimacy from all Iranian traditions and perhaps foreign tribes.&quot;

In sources, Ardashir&#x27;s religious relations and his father being a cleric are mentioned; so it can be deduced that Ardashir had no connections with royal houses and was only a cleric&#x27;s son who knew about religion, but was not a cleric himself; and that was how he, by his religious knowledge, found the chance to be the first person in his inscriptions receiving the royal ring from Ahura Mazda, something a Persian nobleman did not need and only a newcomer had to claim to be from the line of gods. It should be mentioned that it was not precedent to Ardashir to take a royal ring from Ahura Mazda, and it is not seen even in Achaemenid inscriptions.

== Pars before rise of the Sasanians ==
Persis, the state in which the movement of establishing the new Sasanian government began, had lost its fame by third century AD. Since old times, a new city named Istakhr had risen beside the ruins of Persepolis, an Achaemenid capital which was burnt by troops of Alexander III of Macedon. Although the land&#x27;s local shahs picked themselves Achaemenid names like Dara (Darius) and Ardashir in order to preserve old traditions, that was almost the only remaining instance of the ancient magnificence and greatness. The local governors of Pars that considered themselves the rightful heirs of the Achaemenids, had accepted submitting to the Arsacids during the four and a half century of the latters&#x27; reign and always waited for a chance to retake their old glory. They considered the Parthians primordial usurpers who had taken the formers&#x27; right by force.

The remnants of Pasargadae and Persepolis could be permanent memorials of the past magnificence of Pars; though the knowledge about the existence of a large empire was almost forgotten.

As of now, not much knowledge is gained about the four hundred-year history of that state, which was once part of the Seleucid Kingdom and then of Parthian Empire, and almost all the knowledge about the political status of Pars—before the rise of Ardashir, depends on the coins which were minted by the local semi-dependent kings; based on the existent information on the Persian coins, at least one local king ruled in Persian lands slightly after the demise of Alexander III. Even if the existence of the names of kings like Dara and Ardashir on the coins of local shahs of the land does not prove that a subsidiary house of the Achaemenids still ruled in Pars, it at least shows the continuance of some of Achaemenid traditions in that land.

During the Seleucid era, the Frataraka (local Persian shahs) ruled Pars at the time of the rebellion of Alexander, Molon&#x27;s brother, against Antiochus III. That shows those local shahs shared power with Seleucid satraps or each of them ruled part of Pars separately. Also in the Parthian era, the local Persian shahs were entitled to mint coins with their own names like some other semi-dependent shahs of the Parthian Empire. During the time, the Persian governors called themselves &quot;Frataraka&quot;, which probably meant &quot;governor&quot; based on its synonym achieved from the Aramaic documents of the Achaemenid era. Afterwards, the titles of local governors altered and they named themselves &quot;Shahs&quot;. There have been royal crowns and symbols, temple pictures, fireboxes with aflame fires, and symbols of the moon, stars and the portrait of Ahura Mazda minted on coins of the Frataraka that shows the holy fire was adored and the Zoroastrian gods were worshiped and the old creed was permanent in Pars in contrast to other regions.

In a portrait of Papak and his son Shapur carved on Takht-e Jamshid, Papak, while dressed as a priest, squeezes the hilt of his sword by one hand and manipulates the fire of the hearth and adds more firewood to it by the other hand, with his son Shapur taking the royal ring from him. In other pictures of granting the royal medal during the time, meaning granting Khwasak, the mayor of Susa, which is discovered there, and the picture of granting the medal to the governor of Elymais, discovered in Bardneshandeh, the Parthian emperor is granting the royal medal to local shahs; while in the mentioned picture of Papak and his son Shapur in Takht-e Jamshid, it is Papak who is granting the royal ring to Shapur wearing like priests. Lokonin believed that the carving of Papak granting the royal medal to his sone shows that the Sasanians took the power by force in Pars and wished to show their independence from the Parthian emperors; that was why Papak personally grants the royal medal to his son in the mentioned picture. Lokonin also believes that the religious clothes and medals of Papak on the pictures and cois of Shapur (his son), show the separation of religious and royal rule -at the time; Papak was the grand priest and his son Shapur was the land&#x27;s shah. Daryaee believes that the picture shows multiple things; first that the House of Sasan had both the religious and irreligious powers together in Pars; second that the fire creed, related to Zoroastrianism, lived on before the rise of Ardashir; third that the carved picture of Shapur and Papak in Takht-e Jamshid shows the importance of the Achaemenid structure for the Sasanians.

== State of the Parthian Empire before its demise ==
After the demise of Commodus, Roman emperor, in 192 AD, a rivalry between his generals, Pescennius Niger and Septimius Severus, arose, and Vologases V, Parthian emperor, decided to support Niger against Severus. According to Herodian&#x27;s History, the Parthian emperor only managed to request his local following governors to send troops to aid Niger, as Vologases V did not possess a great army. Eventually in 194, Severus won the quest for power in Rome, and he invaded Western Mesopotamia in order to retake the lost regions. The accurate details of the invasion is not known, but Osroene and Nusaybin were retaken anyway. Then Severus returned to Rome due to Clodius Albinus&#x27;s rebellion; during Severus&#x27;s return from Mesopotamia, the Parthian Empire was in disarray. In 197, Severus initiated hostilities with the Parthians. Meanwhile, Vologases suppressed a rebellion in the east of the Empire. Narses, governor of Adiabene (a region to the west of current Lake Urmia), disobeyed to accompany Vologases to invade the East to suppress the rebellion. The noncompliance and also Narses&#x27;s friendly relations with Rome caused Vologases to attack Adiabene, to destroy multiple cities there and to also kill Narses.

Vologases later proceeded towards Nusaybin and laid siege to it, but aborted it due to Roman reinforcements and failed to capture the city. Afterwards, Severus started marching toward Euphrates and to South and took Seleucia and Babylon without resistance, although the Romans contended heavily in late 198 during the fall of Ctesiphon. However, the Romans did not manage to hold the captured regions; they had to retreat due to lack of provisions. The Romans decided to take Hatra while returning, but failed and tried once more in spring 199 to conquer Hatra, and were forced to cede control of Syria with heavy casualties. It must have been that &quot;highly disruptive period of Vologases V&#x27;s reign&quot; and the raid and destruction of Mesopotamia by Severus when Papak probably united most of Pars under his rule. Apparently a peace treaty was then formed between the two powers, though the ancient historians have had no mention of it. Until Vologases&#x27; death in 206 or 207 and also Severus&#x27;s in 211, the Parthian-Roman relations were peaceful. After Vologases V&#x27;s death, his son Vologases VI rose to the throne; but shortly afterward, his reign was challenged by his brother Artabanus IV. In about 213, Artabanus launched a rebellion against his brother Vologases and took the rule of a large part of the Parthian Empire; it can be deduced from the coins found in Hamadan that he ruled the Median land.

According to an inscription of his in Susa, the control of the region is considered to have been Artabanus&#x27;s. Elsewhere, Vologases VI&#x27;s coins found in Seleucia show his control over the land. In Rome, Caracalla rose to power after the death of Septimius Severus, his father. Although the information about the contest between Artabanus and Vologases is trace, the Latin sources say that Caracalla gave special attention to the internal contest of Parthians and reported the disruption of the Parthians&#x27; status to the Roman Senate. Knowledge about the civil war in the Parthian Empire might have encouraged &quot;the idea of a military conquest&quot; in Caracalla and stimulated him towards successes larger than those of his father&#x27;s (Septimius Severus) in fighting the Parthians. At the time while Emperor Caracalla had already been formulating a plan to start a new war with the Parthians, he sent a request for extradition of two fugitives, a philosopher named Antiochus and an unknown man called Tiridates, to Vologases searching for an excuse to start a war in 214 or early 215; Vologases returned the two fugitives; but Caracalla invaded Armenia anyway.

It can be deduced from Caracalla&#x27;s request from Vologases for returning the two fugitives that the Romans considered Vologases the actual Parthian power and great shah at the time. About one year later in 216, Caracalla made another excuse to attack Parthia; that time he demanded Artabanus (not Vologases) to give him his daughter for marriage, which Artabanus did not accept and the war started in summer 216. According to that request of Caracalla from Artabanus, it is assumed that Aratabanus gained &quot;the upper hand&quot; in his internal contest with Vologases then, though Vologases&#x27; coins were minted until 221–222 in Seleucia. Although the exact path of the Romans&#x27; invasion is not known, they certainly conquered Erbil, center of Adiabene; apparently the Parthians avoided a large confrontation; but they applied an offensive policy toward Mesopotamia in early 217. That was the time Caracalla, who was heading to Harran, was killed by head of his security detail Macrinus, who showed his inclination towards peace with the Parthians by &quot;putting the blame of starting the war on Caracalla&quot; and &quot;freeing Parthian prisoners&quot;; but Artabanus demanded the Romans&#x27; &quot;relinquishing of the whole Mesopotamia&quot;, &quot;rebuilding the destroyed cities and fortresses&quot; and &quot;paying compensations for destroying the royal cemetery of Erbil&quot;, knowing of having the upper hand.

Macrinus refused the extensive demands of the Parthians and war was restarted and its peak was in a three-day battle in Nusaybin. Although there is controversy about the result of the battle in the views of the ancient world&#x27;s historians, the aftermath of the battle was obviously Roman defeat. After the end of the war, peace negotiations began and resulted in a peace treaty in 218 according to which the Romans paid 50 million dinars to the Parthians and kept Armenia and Northern Mesopotamia. It was probably in about 220 that the local Persian governors (Ardashir I) started taking far and close lands. At the time, Artabanus did not pay much attention to his actions and decided to fight him when it had become too late. Eventually, Ardashir ended the life of the House of Arsaces in the Battle of Hormozdgan and founded the Sasanian dynasty. However, the end of the Parthian dynasty did not mean an endpoint for all Parthian houses. Movses Khorenatsi, Armenian historian, has quoted some reports of the roles and aids of some Parthian houses, like Suren and Ispahbudhan, in Ardashir&#x27;s uprising.

== Biography ==

=== Early years until his uprising and gaining power ===

According to Al-Tabari&#x27;s report, Ardashir was born in a village named &quot;Tirudeh&quot; in the country &quot;Khir&quot; around Istakhr, Pars in an established family. His grandfather, Sasan, was the trustee of the Temple of Anahita in Istakhr and his grandmother was Rambehesht from Bazrangi House. Al-Tabari added that when Ardashir was seven years old, Papak, Ardashir&#x27;s father, asked Gochihr, local shah in Pars, to send Ardashir to Tiri, commander of Fort Darabgard, for raising, which Gochihr did. After Tiri&#x27;s death, Ardashir took over for him and became the commander of Fort Darabgard.

According to the current sources, Papak was the priest of the Fire Temple of Anahita. He managed to assemble local Persian warriors who believed in the deity. At the time, Vologases V&#x27;s reign was disrupted due to the invasion of Septimius Severus, Roman emperor, on Mesopotamia. It is probable that Vologases defeated Papak after he rebelled and forced him to submit to Parthian rule for a while. It is not probable that Papak&#x27;s kingdom was beyond the Persian land.

According to Arabic-Persian sources, Ardashir started his uprising when he was the commander of Fort Darabgard in eastern Pars. The oldest archaeological proofs of the period of Ardashir&#x27;s reign are acquired from &quot;Ardashir-Khwarrah&quot; (Gor or current Firuzabad) in south border of Pars. Therefore, Ardashir rose up in his war in &quot;Ardashir-Khwarrah&quot;, far from the fortress of local Persian shahs in Istakhr and farther from the Parthian Empire. The beginning of Ardashir&#x27;s uprising may be related to his first inscription in Firuzabad; in the inscription, he is shown acquiring the royal ring from Ahura Mazda in front of his henchmen. Ardashir began the procedure of extending his reign by killing some local kings and taking their domains. According to Al-Tabari&#x27;s report, Ardashir then asked Papak to stand against Gochihr and start a rebellion. Papak did it and rebelled against Gochihr and killed him. Daryaee believes that Papak was a local governor who dreamed of conquering Istakhr and was eventually able to achieve it by the help of his older son Shapur; that means in contrast to Al-Tabari&#x27;s report, it was not Ardashir&#x27;s request and order that caused Papak&#x27;s rebellion against Gochihr, governor of Istakhr, and it can be implied from the common coins of Papak and Shapur. Later, Papak wrote a letter to Artabanus IV and requested permission to appoint Shapur instead of the &quot;overthrown&quot; Gochihr in power; in response, Artabanus announced Papak and Ardashir outlaws. Although Artabanus had defeated the Romans, he faced the problem of the defiance of Vologases VI, who had minted coins in his own name between 221 and 222; and this shows that no powerful emperor controlled the Parthian Empire then. During the time that Artabanus was dealing with a more important challenge, he could not pay much attention to the rise of a newcomer in Pars. After a while, Papak died in an unknown date and Shapur ascended to the throne; afterward, the contest and fight started between the two brothers (Shapur and Ardashir), but Shapur died in an accidental way. According to sources, Shapur stopped at a ruin while assaulting Darabgard and a stone suddenly separated from the ceiling and hit his head and Shapur succumbed immediately. After the incident, the brothers relinquished the Persian throne and crown to Ardashir, who became the Persian Shah thereafter. Ardashir and his followers could be considered the main suspects of Shapur&#x27;s mysterious death, since they &quot;benefitted from the accidental death&quot;; but the accusation is not provable.

Papak&#x27;s picture has been drawn on both Shapur&#x27;s coins and later Ardashir&#x27;s; in the picture of the Papak drawn on Shapur&#x27;s coins, he wears a wig dissimilar to normal Parthian and local Persian shahs and only Shapur has worn a royal wig. According to royal reports, it was Papak who overthrew Gochihr and appointed Shapur instead of him. Ardashir refused to accept Shapur&#x27;s appointment and removed his brother and whoever stood against him and then minted coins with his face drawn on them and Papak&#x27;s behind them. Papak&#x27;s picture on Ardashir-Papak coins, wears a wig similar to those of local Persian shahs in contrast to his picture in Shapur-Papak coins. According to the descriptions given on Papak&#x27;s pictures on the coins, it is probable that the determining role of Ardashir depicted in leading the rebellion against the central government is the product of later historical studies. It is probable that Papak had united most of Pars under his rule by the time; since his picture exists on Ardashir&#x27;s coins too.

In the procedure of extending his domain and power, Ardashir made many Parthian-dependent local shahs and landlords follow him. In the first phase of rebellion, Ardashir challenged the Parthians&#x27; central power by actions like minting coins and constructing new cities. After all, a sight of victory was not imaginable for Ardashir without a public dissatisfaction and interest in rebellion against the Parthians. For example, according to sources, the governor of a land northeast of Ctesiphon called &quot;Beth Garmai&quot; in Syriac and its center was today Kirkuk, along with Sharat, who was the governor of Adiabene, aided Ardashir in his rebellion against the Parthians. In order to consolidate his power, Ardashir killed some of the important figures in Darabgard; then he invaded Kerman and took it too and took control of whole Pars, including the Persian Gulf shores. At that time, Ardashir constructed a palace and fire temple in Gor (current Firuzabad) that its ruins still remain and is called the Palace of Ardashir. He appointed one of his sons named Ardashir as the governor of Kerman. Artabanus, the Parthian emperor, ordered the governor of Susa to attack Ardashir, suppress his rebellion and send him to Ctesiphon. After Ardashir killed and terminated Shadh-Shapur, the governor of Spahan, after fighting him, headed towards Khuzestan and killed the governor of Susa too and added his domain to the lands under his rule. Then he invaded Characene State in the mouth of Tigris and took it and added it to his kingdom.

Eventually, in Ardashir&#x27;s contest with Artabanus in the Battle of Hormozdgan on April 28, 224, Artabanus was killed by Ardashir and the Parthian dynasty was overthrown with his death. The year of the occurrence of the battle is confirmed by Shapur I&#x27;s inscription in Bishapur. The extended report of the Battle of Hormozdgan is probably made for the Sasanian&#x27;s formal history. If the mentioned assumption is right, the writing may have been the main source of Al-Tabari&#x27;s History. After Artabanus&#x27;s death, Ardashir&#x27;s quest for extending his kingdom did not end. In a procedure, the large landlord Parthian houses, either submitted to Ardashir (willingly or unwillingly) or were conquered by him.

The subsequent sources emphasized on the Sasanians&#x27; hatred of everything adapted from the Parthians. The existence of such a mentality in Ardashir is understandable; but even he was forced to establish his newborn government on Parthian foundations by the help of other remarkable Iranian houses, who were either affiliated with the Parthians or nursed by them. However, no change is seen in that hatred of the Parthians in the next generations of Sasanian emperors either. Therefore, it can be deduced that the Parthians enforced a more hard and tyrannical domination than presumed on their submitted shahs and that might have been the reason that facilitated Ardashir&#x27;s conquest.

=== After coronation ===
There is controversy among specialists about the year of Ardashir&#x27;s coronation; according to W.B. Henning&#x27;s studies and calculations, Ardashir was crowned on April 28, 224; however, the calculations of H. Taqizadeh show the date April 6, 227. Josef Wiesehöfer believes the year of Ardashir&#x27;s coronation in Ctesiphon 226 and at the time of his invasion on Northern Mesopotamia based on other sources.

Anyway, by choosing the title &quot;Shahanshah&quot; (king of kings), Ardashir revealed his inclination toward government. During about 226–227, Ardashir experienced a failed attempt to conquer Hatra, which was previously unsuccessfully tried by Trajan and Septimius Severus, while on a crusade for taking the northwest regions of the land. In the late Parthian era, Hatra had become semi-dependent due to the gradual deterioration of the central government. After that unsuccessful attempt of Ardashir&#x27;s in the west, he started taking eastern lands and dominating large Parthian landlords, local noblemen and large Iranian houses and was successful. The exact extent and limits of Ardashir&#x27;s ruled domain can not be determined correctly. Ardashir&#x27;s domain in the west was probably extended to the traditional borders between the Romans and Parthians in the northwest; in the east, the Kushan and Turan and probably Merv Desert rulers surrendered to Ardashir&#x27;s empire; and in the southwest, the northern part of &quot;Arabic shores of the Persian Gulf&quot;were taken by war.

=== War with Rome ===
According to the information collected from Latin and Greek sources, the first clash between the &quot;newborn Sasanian power&quot; in its west borders with Rome occurred by the Persians&#x27; attack on the regions held by Rome in Northern Mesopotamia on Ardashir&#x27;s era, 230. Ardashir besieged Nusaybin, which was one of the two fortresses of Roman defense system in Mesopotamia -the other being Harran, but was not able to take it; the Sasanian riders&#x27; assault was pulled to other Syrian regions and Cappadocia and they invaded it. After the Romans&#x27; unfruitful attempt to make peace with Ardashir, Severus Alexander eventually decided to oppose the Persians unwillingly and reluctantly in 232. The Roman forces led by Alexander attacked Armenia by one military column and the south by two columns. Although there is no accurate information about the details of the events, it is known that the Romans achieved some victories in the north (Armenia); but the troops sent to Southern Mesopotamia did not achieve anything.

In any case, &quot;the first war test between the Sasanians and Romans&quot; ended without any positive result for the Romans; though Alexander held a celebration in Rome for his &quot;victory&quot; and the war has been viewed as a victory in some Roman writings due to preserving the past borders of the Roman empire and Alexander appeared as a victor in Rome. In the war, many casualties were inflicted upon the two armies. In subsequent Arabic-Persian sources, there has been no mention of the war; the cause of not mentioning might have been Ardashir considering the incident shameful.

Although no peace treaty was signed, the eastern Roman borders were not attacked by the Sasanians in the next years. It might have been more important for the Romans to attach Hatra to their fortresses of the border defense system. The people of Hatra knew that their relative autonomy, which became possible at the late Parthian era due to the weakness of the central government, was under the threat of the policies announced by the Sasanians. The foreign policy of the new Persian rulers was to proceed to the Occident and that was probably in order to divert the public attention from the internal problems of the land; that is while the procedure of the Parthians and the Romans in the final years was to leave everything be as they are.

The murder of Severus Alexander by his soldiers and its aftermath which resulted in disturbances in Rome, motivated Ardashir to attack Rome again. In about the years 237–238, Ardashir took Nusaybin and Harran and attacked the city Dura; then he marched toward Hatra, which was a commercial city and the center of the traffic of commercial caravans. Hatra stood hard against the Persian siege and did not fall until April or September 240; it seems that Hatra was chosen as a point for pushing and operation against Roman Mesopotamia. The fall of Hatra might have been the cause of Gordian III&#x27;s wars with Persia.

In the mythical-national Persian history, the Battle of Hatra and the incident of its fall is accompanied with a romantic story. According to the story, at the time of the Persian attack on Hatra, the daughter of the city&#x27;s king had fallen in love with Shapur I, Ardashir&#x27;s son and had him promise her marriage and then opened the gate of the city; then the Persians captured the city and destroyed it. After Shapur found out about the kindness and attention of the father towards his daughter on the wedding night, the former had her killed due to the daughter&#x27;s inappreciation to that kind of father.

=== Final years and succession ===
Due to the difficulties in the sources, the last years and the day of Ardashir&#x27;s death are not very clear. His son, Shapur probably ascended as a royal partner on April 12, 240. The time is found from the Pirchavush inscriptions in Salmas, Northwestern Iran that show Shapur&#x27;s royal participation. The answer to the question if Shapur was crowned as a shah without a partner during Ardashir&#x27;s life depends on the interpretation a special kind of coin. On those coins, the faces of Ardashir and Shapur are carved together. Adding Shapur to his royal position was probably Ardashir&#x27;s plan to solve the succession problem without any troubles; the reason was that Ardashir had other sons and feared that they might have craved the throne like himself.

About the year of Shapur&#x27;s participation in reign with Ardashir, it has been written in Cologne Mani-Codex in Greek about Mani&#x27;s life:&quot;When I became twenty-four years old; in the year that Persian king, Dari-Ardashir opened the city Hatra, and in the year Shapur Shah, his son, put the largest crown in the month Famuthi, on the month day (8th day of Farmuthi), my god, who is the most blessed, made me proud by his generosity, summoned me by his favor...&quot;It can be deduced by calculating the Egyptian month and year that Shapur&#x27;s coronation as his father&#x27;s royal partner occurred on April 12, 240 (the first day of the Babylonian month Nisan in the year 551). Ardashir and Shapur&#x27;s simultaneous reign lasted apparently until early 242. Therefore, it can be said that Shapur was probably crowned twice; once as a royal partner in 240 and later in 243 as lonely reign; however it is more likely that he was crowned only once in 240.

=== Timeline of life ===
According to three dates that are achieved from Shapur&#x27;s inscription on a column in Bishapur, the period between 205 and 206 appears as the beginning of an era in Sasanian history; it is written in the first lines of the mentioned inscription:&quot;1- Farvardin 58, 2- Azar Ardashir 40, 3- Azar Shapur from royal Azars 24&quot;Therefor, history is designated with &quot;three eras&quot; in the inscription; &quot;Azar Ardashir 40&quot; means the 40th year in Ardashir&#x27;s era and &quot;Azar Shapur 24&quot; means the 24th year in Shapur&#x27;s era. 58 shows an era that has remained unknown. It has been deduced from the allusion that one of the mentioned events (overthrowing the local shah of Istakhr by Papak or announcing independence from the Parthians) has happened between the years 205 and 206; since the year is implied as &quot;the year of the beginning of an era&quot;. The assumption that &quot;the period between the years 205 and 206&quot; is related to Papak&#x27;s rebellion is very probable since &quot;the period between the years 205 and 206&quot; was never a basis in any of the future achieved histories from the Sasanians and usually every Sasanian emperor either based the calendar on the year of &quot;his ascension&quot; or based it on the Seleucid calendar that began with 312 B.C. R. Ghirshman believes that the year 58 shows the beginning of the domination of the Sasanian dynasty over the Iranian lands. Besides, the date of altering the Persian coins along with which the names of previous governors were replaced with the Sasanian dynasty can be accepted to be 205–206. It is very probable that Papak took the royal throne of Istakhr between the years 205/206 and 211/212 and appointed his son Shapur for it; then in an insurgent action, Ardashir moved to Gur (Ardashir-Khwarrah or current Firuzabad) from Darabgard and raised his defense fortifications there in order to be able to attack his older brother just after the death of his father, Papak. &quot;The first inscription of Ardashir&#x27;s quest of the crown&quot; in Firuzabad is probably the symbol of his rebellion against his father and brother. Papak probably died in about 211/212 and it is after that when his two sons (Shapur and Ardashir) minted coins titled &quot;The Shah&quot; and decorated them with the face of their recently deceased father (Papak) behind. The report of &quot;Zin-el-Akhbar&quot; also confirms that Ardashir was crowned as a local shah in 211/212. The events of 211/212, which contain the defeat of Shapur (Ardashir&#x27;s brother) and his probable murder, might be related to Ardashir&#x27;s second inscription on Naqsh-e Rajab and also minting coins without the Papak&#x27;s face. The writing of the phrase &quot;his majesty worshiping Mazda, Ardashir the Persian Shah&quot; on some second group of coins of Ardashir&#x27;s might have been after his conquest of Istakhr and taking control of Pars. Ardashir&#x27;s conquest of Pars and taking the adjacent lands was a threat for Artabanus; therefore, Artabanus defied Ardashir and eventually lost the Battle of Hormozdgan and was killed. It was after that when Ardashir was able to claim being &quot;the Shahanshah of Iranians&quot;. Ardashir carved a memorial inscription for victory in the Battle of Hormozdgan near the city Gur. The signs of these events (the period between taking Istakhr until conquering Ctesiphon and formal coronation there) are shown in the inscription of Ardashir&#x27;s coronation in Naqsh-e Rostam and also the alteration of his coins.

==Reign infrastructure==

=== The procedure of centralization of power ===

The history of the Sasanian society can be studied based on two completely opposite principles; one was the central power, whose incarnation was the &quot;shahanshah&quot; himself and constantly attempted to increase his power; and on the other hand was the liegemen and grand landlords who prevented the centralization of power by the shahanshah and sometimes increased their own powers against the shah.

At first, the Sasanian policies were formed based on the relations between the shah, the royal family and the noble landlords (including members of the old Parthian high class). In Ardashir&#x27;s period, though the centralization had begun and the number of local shahs had decreased sharply, his reign stood on the same bases which the Parthian empire was on after all.

According to the description of &quot;Shapur I&#x27;s inscription at the Ka&#x27;ba-ye Zartosht&quot; of Ardashir&#x27;s court, the latter&#x27;s name is mentioned as the king of kings (shahanshah) along with four &quot;shahs&quot;, who were the rulers of Nishapur, Marw, Kerman and Sakastan. There were also the three kingdoms Makran, Turgistan and Kushanshahr that had submitted to Ardashir&#x27;s command and paid him taxes. Those local shahs were partly semi-dependent from the central government and the successions were inherited for them. However at the periods of the succeeding Sasanian shahanshahs, the independences of some of them were taken; for example at the time of Shapur I, the independences of Merv and Nishapur were taken and Sakastan became a province (city) and was granted to liegeman Narseh, son of Shapur. This shows an increasing inclination towards the centralization of power since the early Sasanian era.

The structure of the central Parthian government depended on &quot;local noblemen&quot; and &quot;clan grandees&quot; and included local autonomous governments based on &quot;aristocracy&quot; and &quot;tribal interests&quot;. Ardashir had realized that it would be impossible to pursue and finish the policy of attacking and attaching without permanentizing and consolidating power in his domain; and thus, he could alter the military balance in then status and the homeland structure only by removing the local governors and establishing a central power with an organized bureaucratic system. Although the Sasanian government did not have any difference from the final Parthian era on its first days, but as mentioned, one of the prominent features of the Sasanian era was an increasing inclination toward the concentration of power in Iran since the first days of the Sasanians&#x27; uprising. In the Sasanian dawn, Iran included a union of kingdoms and noble landlords (liegemen), each of which possessed a various degree of independence from the central government and were economically connected to it by different channels. In other words, a type of feudal society under the rule of large owners stood in the Iranian Plateau while in the Mesopotamian deserts, the urban culture and pathway cities were the face of society more often.

==== Urbanization ====
The first Sasanian shahanshahs founded or renovated some cities in different Iranian regions. It is clear from the first Sasanian inscriptions that &quot;altering the names&quot;, renovating or rebuilding of new cities were done in regions that had been conquered by Sasanian troops and were considered part of the royal property (). Those &quot;royal cities&quot; of the Sasanian era were the centers of military garrisons in newly taken lands and later became the centers of newfound official divisions and abodes of government agents. Therefore, the increase in the number of &quot;royal cities&quot; equaled with the growth of royal ; thus, instead of the autonomous cities of the Parthian era that were usually in western regions of the land and governed more of less extensive regions independently from the central government, came the &quot;royal cities&quot; in the early Sasanian era that were considered the garrison centers of the central government. Each of those regions were constructed to center a rural district under the rule of a &quot;Shahrab&quot; and the taxes of those regions were sent directly to the empire. On the other hand, beside the royal fields (), wide lands ruled by noble landlords and local grandees also existed and the shahanshah did not have direct control over them and the taxes of those lands were paid to the royal treasury by indirect channels. That was why it became the internal goal and financial policy of Ardashir and his descendants to increase the number of royal districts and the regions attached (); though the dichotomy of taxation between the royal lands () with direct taxes to the royal treasury and the lands ruled by grandees and noble landlords with indirect taxes to the royal treasury continued until the fiscal reforms at the time of Kavadh I and Khosrow I.

The cities which are believed to had been constructed by Ardashir are:

According to Al-Tabari, Ardashir I founded eight cities, three of which were in Pars, titled &quot;Ardashir-Khwarrah&quot;, &quot;Ram-Ardashir&quot; and &quot;Riv-Ardashir&quot;; one was in Khuzestan titled &quot;Hormozd-Ardashir&quot;, two cities in Asoristan titled &quot;Veh-Ardashir&quot; and &quot;Ostabad&quot;, one in Bahrain titled &quot;Pasa-Ardashir&quot; and one close to today Mosul titled &quot;Nud-Ardashir&quot;. However, attribution of the dates of constructions of all these cities to Ardashir&#x27;s royal era is doubted. For example, it is known that Shapur I founded several cities &quot;with a name combined with Ardashir&#x27;s&quot; to honor his father; while some other are founded by other people named Ardashir.

=== Government ideology and Iranian thought ===

The remnants of the ruins of Pasargadae and Takht-e Jamshid could be permanent memorials of the previous magnificence of Pars; though the knowledge about the existence of a great empire was almost forgotten. According to the information from the coins of local Persian governors before the Sasanian uprising, at least one local king ruled in Persian land almost slightly after the demise of Alexander III of Macedon. The first local Persian shahs were known as &quot;Frataraka&quot;, meaning mayors or governors. They carved the title &quot;Lord of the Gods&quot; (Ferehtorkeh of Baghs) on their coins; this carving was the subject of important studies. Panaino believes that by the phrase &quot;gods&quot; (baghs), deities like &quot;Ahura Mazda&quot;, &quot;Mitra&quot; and &quot;Anahita&quot; are meant that were supported by Achaemenid shahs. Daryaee believes that &quot;gods&quot; indicates Achaemenid shahs and not &quot;the deities they supported&quot;. He adds that the &quot;gods&quot; (baghs) mentioned on the coins were the Achaemenid shahs that were worshiped by the Seleucids after death. This is probably why the fact that &quot;bagh&quot; is translated as &quot;god&quot; on the coins of Ardashir and other succeeding shahs today is originated from Greek concepts.

It is deduced from onomastic and physiognomic findings that the remark of the Achaemenids and adoring fire, one of the principles of Zoroastrianism, still existed in Pars. The similarity of Ardashir I&#x27;s coins with the remaining coins of local Persian shahs shows a Persian tradition and the adoring of local shahs toward it. On the coin of Hubarz, one of local Persian shahs, it is written: &quot;Hubarz, a governor from the gods, son of a Persian&quot;. The importance of this writing is that it shows the title on Ardashir&#x27;s coins &quot;Worshiper of Mazda, Lord Ardashir, the shahanshah of Iran that &quot;has a face from the gods&quot;&quot; is the continuation of the tradition of Fratarakas. On the other hand, with the existence of the names of kings like Darius and Artaxerxes on the coins of local shahs of the land, if it is not assumed that a subsidiary house of the Achaemenids still ruled in Pars, it at least testifies for the continuation of a part of the Achaemenid traditions. After all, the rise of the Parthians to power meant the domination of nomadic and degenerate Iranians on urban Iranians; the second faction, which was more original and nationally authentic than the first faction, looked at the Parthians with a grudge, considered them usurpers who had violated their right and Pars was the head of those regions.

Ardashir had a remarkable role in developing the royal ideology. He tried to announce himself as a Mazda worshiper connected to god and owner of divine khvarenah. The claim of his royal eligibility as a rightful newcomer from the line of mythical Iranian shahs and the propagations attributed to Ardashir against the eligibility and the role of the Parthians in the Iranian history sequence confirms the excellent place that the Achaemenid legacy had in the minds of the first Sasanian shahanshahs; though the consensus is that the Sasanians probably did not know much about the Achaemenids and the status. On the other hand, Shahbazi believes that the first Sasanian shahanshahs were familiar with the Achaemenids and their succeeding shahanshahs turned to the Kayanians deliberately. About that, Daryee adds that the Sasanians knowingly ignored the Achaemenids in order to be able to attribute their origins to the Kayanians; and that is why they applied the holy historiography. In that method, the social familiarity and bureaucracy did not matter and the court propagated its custom history by the help of the religious system. In order to remark his victories, Ardashir carved pictures in Firuzabad, Naqsh-e Rustam and Naqsh-e Rajab; on his picture in Naqsh-e Rustam, Ardashir and Ahura Mazda are opposite to each other on horsebacks and the bodies of Artabanus IV and Ahriman are visualized under the nails of Ardashir and Mazda&#x27;s horses. It can be deduced from the picture that Ardashir believed or wanted others to believe that his reign over the land that is called &quot;Iran&quot; in inscriptions is designated by the Lord. The word &quot;Iran&quot; was previously used in Avesta and as &quot;the name of the mythical Aryan land&quot;. In Ardashir&#x27;s period, the title &quot;Iran&quot; was applied to the geography under Sasanian rule. The thought of &quot;Iran&quot; was accepted by both Zoroastrian and non-Zoroastrian societies in the whole empire and the collective memory of the Iranians has continued and survived until the modern period today in different stages and various layers of the Iranian society. What is clear is that the concept &quot;Iran&quot; has had a religious application too and has later ended in the formation of its political face meaning a collection of lands.

Choosing a place like Naqsh-e Rustam, which is mausoleum of Achaemenid shahs, for carving and inscribing, the site of the temple of Anahita in Istakhr and the existence of the names of some Achaemenid shahs as ancestors in the legendary Sasanian family tree show the existence of an inclination toward the Achaemenids in the early Sasanian period. There are many proofs in Middle Persian and Arabic-Persian writings that show the Sasanians&#x27; aggressive confrontation with Rome in order to return to the magnificent past status in the west and it had been assumed that the glory was taken by the Romans. About that, Al-Tabari has mentioned that Ardashir claimed and announced that he had risen to take the revenge of Darius III, who had been defeated and killed by Alexander III of Macedon. Roman historians like Herodian and Cassius Dio have also mentioned reports about &quot;the Sasanians&#x27; desire to return to the magnificence and kingdom of the Achaemenids&quot;; these reports of Roman historians show that the Romans had understood the goals of the Sasanian foreign policy well; though they did not have a decent understanding of the change and transformation in the royal Iranian continuum. The place of Alexander, who was known as a nemesis of Iran, in the thought of the Sasanians&#x27; desire for return at the time was simultaneous and aligned with the idea of &quot;following and honoring Alexander&quot; in the Roman emperors; Caracalla called himself &quot;the second Alexander&quot; and &quot;Severus Alexander&quot; honored him. Kettenhofen, Robin and Heuse believe that the class of Greek-Roman sources that have reported the Sasanians&#x27; familiarity with the Achaemenids and their desire for return to and extension of the Achaemenid lands had propagative applications and should be interpreted in the frame of the Roman empire thoughts. But what is clear is Ardashir&#x27;s and later his son Shapur&#x27;s claim of Roman lands. Daryee believes that the cause of Ardashir and Shapur&#x27;s wars with Rome was to accommodate their territorial ideals with traditions; he believes that the Sasanians&#x27; claim of Asian lands as their fathers&#x27; legacy had a mythical basis and originated from the mythical story of Fereydun dividing the world between his sons (Salm, Tur and Iraj); in that myth, Fereydun grants the reign of Turan to Tur and Rome to Salm and Iran, which is the best land in the world, to Iraj; the brothers become envious of the latter and the world goes under war. Thus, the Sasanians considered themselves Iraj&#x27;s children and the Romans Salm&#x27;s heirs by a mythical view. Daryee adds that only by that way the Sasanians&#x27; territorial claims, which are mentioned in Cassius Dio and Herodian&#x27;s works, can be understood. He believes that the Sasanians&#x27; territorial claims were basically different from those of the Achaemenids.

In the Sasanians&#x27; legendary genealogy that has appeared in Kar-Namag i Ardashir i Pabagan, the relation between the Sasanians and the Achaemenids is mentioned. In the book, the thought that has been reflected is the relation of Sasan, the ancestor of the Sasanian house, with Darius&#x27;s descendants on one hand and the local Persian kings on the other hand; though in the fifth century, the Sasanians attributed their lineage to the mythical kings of Avesta or Kayanians; and its proof is the addition of the prefix &quot;Kay&quot; to the aliases of the Sasanian shahanshahs.

The question whether those claims and schemes and avengings, in the same way as mentioned in the historical sources, were actually proposed by Ardashir himself or were later attributed to him as the founder of the empire has still remained without answer due to the lack of sufficient sources; though the attribution of these claims to Ardashir after his lifetime seems more logical. According to these, it is undoubtedly true that Ardashir&#x27;s grandiose views about policy and relations with the outside world had formed based on rebooting and repeating the Achaemenids&#x27; successes. However, the Sasanians&#x27; knowledge of the Achaemenids were superficial and vague information and did not have a regular and historical basis. About that, Richard Frye and Daryee believe that the section of the Arabic-Persian sources (like Al-Tabari) that contain the Sasanian history since the beginning until the age of Khosrow I should be looked at suspiciously; they consider this suspicious look at texts like Kar-Namag i Ardashir i Pabagan too. The suspicious look has been due to that most of the Iranian history sources were edited in the age of Khosrow I and by the royal writers and clerics in order to accommodate their predecessors&#x27; history with then world view of the Sasanian empire and draw a picture of Ardashir idealistic and aligning with Khosrow&#x27;s ideals in the best way.

=== Religious policy ===

Papak was the grand priest of the temple of Anahita in Istakhr and the father of Ardashir, the founder of the Sasanian house, with the beginning of whose reign religion sat on the Persian throne. Papak&#x27;s religious credit might have helped him in taking the power from Gochihr, then Persian governor who had no interest in following the religion of fire. In a scratched picture, Papak and his son Shapur are shown on a wall in Takht-e Jamshid; in the picture, Papak and Shapur both wear the same helmet similar to that of Shapur I&#x27;s in his coins; in the picture, Shapur is visualized in the dual place of shah-priest in a way that he squeezes the hilt of his sword by one hand and manipulates the fire in the fireplace and adds woods by the other hand; and Shapur, son of Papak, squeezes his sword by one hand and takes a ring having a ribbon which is the royal symbol by the other hand on horseback. In his coins, Ardashir, who replaces his brother Shapur as the ruler of Pars in 220, wears the same crown as Shapur&#x27;s, from the front however, and the picture of his father Papak is drawn behind. Zoroastrianism was the believed and supported religion of the Sasanians until Ardashir&#x27;s takeover. The current belief is that the priests of the fire temples became noticed and respected by Ardashir&#x27;s uprising and the opponents were disturbed; but this narrative is the subject of controversy today. Although no remarkable authority of Zoroastrianism had a high rank in Ardashir&#x27;s court, it seems that the first attempts to establish Zoroastrianism as a government religion was done during Ardashir&#x27;s period; also the remaining Achaemenid, Hellenic and Parthian traditions were combined and used in that era. Ardašhir demolished the dynastic sanctuaries of all the vassal kings, permitting only those established with his approval and that honored his dynasty. Accordingly, in Arsacid Armenia, Ardašhir expanded the temple cults and commanded that the fire of Ohrmazd, which burned on the altar at Bagavan, be kept alight forever. However, he destroyed the statues that Valarsace had erected as representations of his ancestors, along with those of the sun and moon at Armavir. These statues, which had been moved from Armavir to Bagaran and then to Artashat, were also broken by Ardašhir.
In his coins and inscription in Naqsh-e Rustam, Ardashir has called himself the worshiper of Ahura Mazda and from the line of gods. In Ardashir&#x27;s subsequent coins, the dentate crown has replaced the traditional hat on his head; that change along with the addition of the phrase &quot;...looks similar to the gods&quot; (he is from the line of gods) claim Ardashir&#x27;s divine place. That dentate crown looks like the same crown that is drawn on the head of Ahura Mazda in the carvings of the coronation in Naqsh-e Rustam and it is not known whether Ahura Mazda&#x27;s crown is adapted from Ardashir&#x27;s or vice versa. His beliefs are revealed behind his coins by visualizing the fire temple. His projecting pictures in Firuzabad, Naqsh-e Rustam and Naqsh-e Rajab have shown him close to Ahura Mazda. The latter&#x27;s attention towards Ardashir has been known as khvarenah due to the mythical Iranian thoughts and it can be compared to the Greek &quot;tuxeh&quot; and the Roman &quot;fortuna&quot;. Ardashir&#x27;s khvarenah status shows the legitimacy of his reign. Founding the fire temples and giving budget to them along with considering Zoroastrian religious texts was another way for Ardashir to gain legitimacy. A special fire temple called &quot;Ardashir&#x27;s Fire&quot; was founded in the beginning of his reign that is named in his inscriptions in Bishapur. In &quot;the Meadows of Gold&quot;, Al-Masudi has attributed some words to him:&quot;Remember that religion and reign are two brothers that one can not exist without the other; because religion is the basis of reign and reign is the supporter of religion. Whatsoever does not stand on a basis will be doomed and whatever does not have a supporter will deteriorate&quot;.Ardashir&#x27;s policy against non-Mazda worshiping societies inside his kingdom had made it a difficult period for them. The Jews and believers in some other religions were more or less tolerated in the Parthian era and also had limited independence. Ardashir and his son Shapur, especially in the beginning of his reign, tried to limit the Jews&#x27; autonomy and deprive them of their independent judiciary and legal rights. The purpose of those actions might have been to extend the Zoroastrian society. The Syriac-language Christians were treated with more tolerance and leniency and their population increased until mid-third century. Mani did not reveal his propaganda until Ardashir&#x27;s death; he might have realized that Shapur was more convincing than his father.

=== Court and government posts ===
The rankings of the figures in Ardashir&#x27;s court is found from Shapur I&#x27;s inscription at the Ka&#x27;ba-ye Zartosht. Thus, the first four shahs are mentioned as Satarop Shah Abarinag (Abarineh: higher (lands), Nishapur, Khorasan), Ardashir the Shah of Merv, Ardashir the Shah of Kerman, Ardashir the Shah of Sekan (Sakastan), having the right of inherited succession in their family. After that, the name of three queens Denag Bazrangi, Ardashir&#x27;s grandmother, Rodag, Ardashir&#x27;s mother, and Denag Babakan, Ardashir&#x27;s sister and wife are mentioned. Then, the names of &quot;Ardashir Bidakhsh&quot; and &quot;Papak Hazarbed&quot; and the five members of the great houses, called &quot;Dihin&quot; from the House of Veraz, Sasan from the House of Suren, Sasan-e Andigan-e Khoday va Piruz and Goug from the House of Karen along with &quot;Abarsam-e Farardashir&quot;, who was probably the senior advisor are mentioned. Afterward, the names of fifteen remarkable characters like &quot;Spahbed&quot;, &quot;Dabiroft&quot;, Ayundbad (Director of Ceremonies), Framadar and his clerks and religious authorities like Herbad and Mubed and Mogh are mentioned. According to the inscription, the high posts of wuzurg framadar, priest of priests and Herbadan Herbad were not yet established in Ardashir&#x27;s period.

It can be deduced from the list that some deviations have occurred in the important names and events of the era in the late Sasanian sources. For example, in the narrative Iranian history, the land that was ruled by &quot;Mihrak Andigan&quot; was named &quot;the largest enemies of Ardashir&quot;; while the mentioned region was under the rule of Sasan Shah Andigan and is mentioned as one of the pro-Ardashir regions in the mentioned inscription. It can be deduced from the list that a same-story group had appeared supporting Ardashir that included the representatives of large Iranian houses like the Varazes, Surens and Karens in addition to the shahs of Andigan and Opernak and Merv and Sakastan. According to Roman sources, some of the minor Mesopotamian governors had also joined them.

== Ardashir in the narrative-mythical Iranian history ==
In the narrative Iranian history, Ardashir is described as a heroic, bold, forethoughtful man with a high amount of fortitude and mood. According to those texts, he was a persistent man and had a chivalric behavior though he applied much violence and cruelty, and fought alongside his warriors in battles. In the narrative Iranian history texts, Ardashir succeeded because he was from the line of the ancient Iranian shahanshahs and was chosen by the gods to rule Iran. But there is no doubt in that justifying the Sasanian rule occurred by adding some matters to the real trend of the events of the era later and at the end of their reign and it probably had a political reason to mention those matters in official writings.

In the &quot;Letter of Tansar&quot;, it is mentioned that Ardashir&#x27;s intention was to seek the revenge of Darius III from the Alexandrians (Romans). That text was obviously written in order to arouse the Iranians national emotions; though these narratives have more actually the criteria of epic stories. But it reveals the psychological truth that the Iranians deeply had the feeling of possessing a national identity for several centuries and considered themselves separate from other peoples; and that is why the other lands that the Iranians conquered were never named &quot;Iran&quot;, but were called &quot;Aniran&quot;.

== Ardashir&#x27;s petroglyphs ==
The Sasanians&#x27; petroglyphic art was established by Ardashir and lived on until Shapur II&#x27;s reign. The art was revived in Khosrow II&#x27;s period. Ardashir&#x27;s petroglyphs are clearly different from the few remaining Parthian samples and a new historic frame is seen in them. His first three petroglyphs have various styles, but do not show a clear evolutionary procedure. Only the fourth petroglyph, the picture of Ardashir&#x27;s coronation in Naqsh-e Rustam, possesses clear features that reappears in the petroglyphs of Shapur I and his successors.

== Numismatics ==
The coins minted in Ardashir&#x27;s period are divided into three general groups based on the applied designs:

The first group is the coins that show a full-face portrait of Ardashir on the coin and a profile of Papak, Ardashir&#x27;s father who looks left due to the Parthians, behind the coin. The phrase &quot;Ardashir Shah&quot; is written on these coins with the phrase &quot;His Majesty Papak Shah&quot; behind.

The second group have the profile of Ardashir wearing a hat or crown looking right similar to other coins of the Sasanian era. Behind the second group coins, a symbol of the firebox of the fire temple is seen like in all the coins of the Sasanian era. On the second group of the coins, the phrase &quot;The worshiper of Mazda, his majesty Ardashir the Iranian shahanshah who has his face from the gods&quot; is written that shows Ardashir&#x27;s religious beliefes.

On the third group of the coins, the picture of Ardashir is carved in front of the picture of his son, Shapur, with the phrases &quot;Shapur the Iranian shah who has his face from the gods&quot; and &quot;Ardashir&#x27;s fire&quot;. The firebox of the fire temple is carved behind the coins.

The symbol behind the second group coins is a fireplace carving based on a design found in Persia and the phrase &quot;Ardashir&#x27;s fire&quot; implies a royal fire that was ignited in the beginning of every shah&#x27;s reign. The section of the supporting basis of the fireplace has some similarity to the Achaemenid throne. Some hanging bands are carved in the end of an open headband, which is the royal symbol in Persian traditions. Therefore, the petroglyphs behind these coins show Ardashir&#x27;s concern for showing himself not only as the Achaemenids&#x27; rightful heir, but also as a religious Zoroastrian. In the makeup of head and hair, Ardashir was loyal to the Parthian traditions in the first coins and chose a crown similar to the crowns of Mithridates II&#x27;s period. However, in the final years, Ardashir&#x27;s main crown was from a type in which a part of the hair was decorated in a globe above the head; the globe and the lid were covered with a thin silky net and some bands were hanging behind it.

Based on a research by Callieri, most of the symbols of the Frataraka&#x27;s coins like the flag, the memorial building and the appearing posture of the person standing opposite to it are derived from the Achaemenids. Daryaee believes that though the Fratarakas probably did not know the proper application of a building like Ka&#x27;ba-ye Zartosht, it still had an ideological importance to them. Therefore, it can be deduced from the similarity of Ardashir&#x27;s coins with the late coins of local Persian governors there was a movement based on Persian traditions and the local Persian governors&#x27; adornment of it. However that does not necessarily mean that Ardashir was related to the local Persian shahs in all affairs.

==Legacy==
Among the Sasanian shahs, two, Ardashir I and Khosrow I, are attributed preaches and scholarly words more than other shahs and these works are quoted of them in most of Arabic literature and history books and by them in Persian ethics and history books. One of the most important works attributed to Ardashir is his &quot;testament&quot;.

=== Ardashir&#x27;s Testament ===
&quot;Ardashir&#x27;s Testament&quot; is a book including Ardashir&#x27;s political advice to the Iranian shahs who rose after him and he had mentioned lectures in it that he believed were necessary to be applied in running the kingdom.

Ibn al-Nadim once mentioned a book called &quot;Ardashir&#x27;s Testament&quot; that Al-Baladhuri (died 279 Hijri), one of Persian (Middle) translators, had turned into an Arabic poem. Once again in the chapter about the books of the Persians, Romans, Indians and Arabs in the preaches and ethics and doctrines, he mentioned a book called &quot;Ardashir I&#x27;s Testament to His Son Shapur&quot; and it seems that he meant another book.

The original Middle Persian text of &quot;Ardashir&#x27;s Testament&quot; is lost; but some versions of its Arabic translations are available:
# The text that is written in the book &quot;Al-Ghorreh&quot; that was probably written in the second half of the fourth century and its author is not known. That version was rewritten in 584 Hijri.
# The text that is written in Miskawayh&#x27;s &quot;Tajarob-ol Omam&quot;.
# The text that is written in a series belonging to the Kuperolo Library (No. 1608) and was probably rewritten from a sixth-century version in the early eleventh century.
# The text written by Abi.
In addition to the complete text, there is an abridged version of it titled &quot;Montakhab men Ahd-e Ardashir bin Babak&quot; available.

In the Islamic era, &quot;Ardashir&#x27;s Testament&quot; is mentioned in many history and literature books. Al-Masudi has remarked it and has quoted a phrase of its about the last millennium. It is also named in &quot;Mojmal al-tawarikh&quot; and &quot;Farsnameh&quot; and in the latter it is mentioned about Khosrow I that &quot;he suggested the testaments of Ardashir, son of Papak, and applied his preaches that were in that testament.&quot; The same matter is mentioned by Al-Tabari and Al-Tha&#x27;alibi. Al-Jahiz has mentioned &quot;Ardashir&#x27;s Testament&quot; along with &quot;Bozorgmehr&#x27;s Quotes&quot; and mentions that the writers (Kottab) used it. Al-Mubarrad (died 286 Hijri) writes that Al-Ma&#x27;mun had ordered his son&#x27;s mentor to teach him &quot;Al-Watheg bellah&quot; the book of God and read him &quot;Ardashir&#x27;s Testament&quot; and force him to memorize &quot;Kelileh va Demneh&quot;.

=== Ardashir&#x27;s Testament to His Son Shapur ===
Ibn al-Nadim names a book titled &quot;Ardashir I&#x27;s Testament to His Son Shapur&quot; among the books of preaches and ethics and doctrines. That is probably the same short text that is written with the version title &quot;Ardashir&#x27;s Testament to His Son Shapur&quot; in the book &quot;Nahayat-ol Aarab&quot; attributed to Al-Asma&#x27;i. Apparently, Ibn al-Muqaffa&#x27; or more probably the author of the &quot;Seir-ol Moluk&quot; that was the reference of &quot;Nahayat-ol Aarab&quot; chose the text from the Arabic translation of &quot;Ardashir&#x27;s Testament&quot; and added some matters from other places to it. Ibn Qutaybah has written a matter from Ardashir intended to his son quoted from &quot;One of the Ajam Books&quot; that can be found in this testament.

=== Ardashir&#x27;s Book on Government Principles ===
A book attributed to Ardashir about the bases of government is written in an Arabic translation in the book &quot;Nahayat-ol Aarab&quot; and the warriors (Asawereh), writers (Kottab), Judges (Gozat), invasion (Bo&#x27;uth va Thoghur), accepting ambassadors () constructing cities (Bana-ol Modon), his strategy for noble houses (Tadbirohu fi Ahl-e Boyutat-el Sharaf), complaint (Mazalem) and development of lands (Tadbirohu Emarat-al Arzain) are discussed in it. The Persian translation of that book is written in the translation of &quot;Nahayat-ol Aarab&quot; called &quot;Tajarob-ol Omam&quot; and also in Ferdowsi&#x27;s &quot;Shahnameh&quot;. It is not known whether the book is translated directly from Middle Persian or not. Grinaski believes that an Arabic-writing author had assembled it from different places. In order to prove his opinion, he mentions evidence that shows the influence of Islamic principles in it, for instance the writing in the book that one fifth of the war plunder is for the shah. However, since the text is written in &quot;Shahnameh&quot;, it probably existed in &quot;Khwaday-Namag&quot; too and some matters aligning with Islamic principles were added to it in the translation.

=== Ardashir-Khwarrah ===

Ardashir-Khwarrah is one of the five Iranian villages in the Sasanian era until the first Islamic centuries centered by the city of Gur (Arabic: Jur) that were constructed by Ardashir. The name means &quot;Ardashir&#x27;s magnificence&quot;. The town was probably constructed after Ardashir&#x27;s victory over Artabanus in 224. The town was constructed beside Ardashir&#x27;s palace (where he lived before the rebellion) and it is said that the emperor built five fire temples beside the town that the historian, Al-Masudi had seen. The city of Gur was run by a representative from the shah. Gur was later renamed Firuzabad by the 10th-century Buyid king &#x27;Adud al-Dawla. Ardashir-Khwarrah can be mentioned as a military base and one of the active mints of the Sasanian era. Of the works of Ardashir-Khwarrah, the building of Tarbal (Menar) Kiakhoreh beside the building of Chaharotag (The Gur fire temple), Ardashir&#x27;s palace, the inscription of Mihr Narseh (the vizier of three Sasanian kings; Yazdegerd I, Bahram V and Yazdegerd II) and his four fire temples can be mentioned.

The structure of the town is inspired by the architectural method of Darabgard and contains circular walls that surround an area with a diameter of about two kilometers and a double muddy wall and a trench with a Parthian style and two axes divide the perpendicular intersection of the city to four sectors with four main gates of Mehr, Bahram, Hormoz and Ardashir that each is divided to five smaller sections that are connected to each other by ring-like streets.

<doc id="841100" wikidata="Q1755351" url="?curid=841100" title="Hopscotch (Cortázar novel)">
<text>Hopscotch () is a novel by Argentine writer Julio Cortázar. Written in Paris, it was published in Spanish in 1963 and in English in 1966. For the first U.S. edition, translator Gregory Rabassa split the inaugural National Book Award in the translation category.

&quot;Hopscotch&quot; is a stream-of-consciousness novel which is advised to be read according to two (or three) different sequences of chapters; the third being read with chapters in any order. This novel is often referred to as a counter-novel, as it was by Cortázar himself. It meant an exploration with multiple endings, a neverending search through unanswerable questions.

==&quot;Table of Instructions&quot; and structure==
An author&#x27;s note suggests that the book would best be read in one of two possible ways: either progressively from chapters 1 to 56, with all subsequent &quot;expendable chapters&quot; being excluded, or by &quot;hopscotching&quot; through the entire set of 155 chapters according to a &quot;Table of Instructions&quot; designated by the author. Chapter 55 is left out all together in this second method, and the book would end with a recursive loop, as the reader is potentially left to &quot;hopscotch&quot; back and forth between chapters 58 and 131 infinitely. Cortázar also leaves the reader the option of choosing a unique path through the narrative.

Several narrative techniques are employed throughout the book, and frequently overlap, including first person, third person, and a kind of stream-of-consciousness. Traditional spelling and grammatical rules are not always applied.

==Plot (chapters 1–36)==

The first 36 chapters of the novel in numerical order are grouped under the heading &quot;From the Other Side.&quot; They provide an account of Horacio Oliveira&#x27;s life in Paris in the 1950s. La Maga and a band of bohemian intellectuals who call themselves the Serpent Club are other characters who appear in these chapters. 

The story opens with Horacio searching the bridges of Paris for his lover, a Uruguayan woman named Lucia (better known throughout the novel as la Maga), who has disappeared. 

Both meet frequently with their mutual friends, the members of a group nicknamed the Serpent Club. This is a circle of artists, writers, and musicians that drink and listen to music while discussing art, literature, philosophy, architecture, and other subjects. In their discussions, they frequently mention a writer by the name of Morelli, who insists on the necessity of breaking with the linguistic forms of the moment. The group jumps from one topic to another with relative ease, but la Maga, who is not as well-read as the others, generally needs the others to explain the subjects at hand. Her vivacity distances her from the group, foreshadowing her eventual separation from it. The club, however, shows affection toward Lucia, but almost always in a condescending manner.

Horacio and la Maga had been living together for some time at the beginning of the narrative, but Rocamadour, the baby of la Maga who is in the care of a nanny in the countryside, becomes ill. La Maga has to bring him to live with her and Horacio. Rocamadour&#x27;s health is too delicate to improve in the cold and cramped apartment, but la Maga is terrified by the idea of sending him to a hospital. This leads the infant to become gravely ill. Meanwhile, Oliveira increasingly resents the situation, because he had not agreed to live with a baby. During a fight, Horacio tells la Maga that she can consider their relationship to be over. La Maga bursts into tears. Oliveira leaves the apartment, possibly with the intention of visiting Pola, a lover of his. He is unsure whether he will return or not.

Later, while wandering the streets without any fixed destination, Oliveira witnesses a car running over an older man. Another witness states that the victim is a writer who lives near the site of the accident. An ambulance arrives to pick up the injured man.

A light rain begins. Horacio continues his melancholic preponderances. He is left struck by the mechanical way in which the paramedics treated the victim. To take cover from the poor weather, he steps into the entrance of a theater and decides to stay and watch the piano concert being given there by a &quot;madame&quot; Berthe Trepat.

In the theater, Oliveira listens to the compositions of Trepat, which he judges to be badly written and played even worse. The rest of the audience leaves in the middle of the concert. Everything indicates that Oliveira sympathizes with the woman, whose failure contrasts with her proud attitude. He offers to walk her home. In the rain, she tells him about her problems with Valentin, her partner, who she expects to be at home with one of his lovers. When they arrive, Horacio offers to find her a hotel, and she slaps him, suspecting he has unwholesome intentions. Oliveira walks away crying, humiliated.

He returns to la Maga&#x27;s apartment, where he runs into a suitor of hers, Gregorovius. Horacio believes the two slept together while he was out. In reality, la Maga had rejected his advances. Horacio sits down with the two to have a chat in the style of the Club de la Serpiente, but they are constantly interrupted by an older man who lives on the upper floor and continually hits the floor of his apartment. At a critical point in the conversation, Oliveira touches Rocamadour and realizes that the baby is dead.

After reflecting on the senselessness of the death and considering the confusion that the event would cause, Oliveira, with his habitual attitude, decides not to communicate the terrible news. However, given the insistence of the neighbor from the upper floor, he suggests that la Maga go upstairs and confront the man. While she leaves to do that, Oliveira relates Rocamadour&#x27;s death to Gregorovius. Both sit down to consider the legal implications. Gregorovius does not mention the matter when la Maga returns.

Various friends from the Club de la Serpiente arrive at the apartment. Two of them, Ronald and Babs, tell the others that one of the Club&#x27;s members, Guy Monod, had attempted suicide. Later, a third member of the group, Etienne, arrives to tell them that Monod would survive but was in critical condition. The group embarks on one of their characteristic philosophical discussions, during which they discreetly communicate to each other about the horrible event that had come to pass in the apartment. La Maga is excluded from the conversation, but she finally realizes that her son has died when she tries to give him a dose of his medicine. She becomes hysterical, and the chaos that Oliveira had feared breaks loose. La Maga goes to Horacio for support, but he either cannot or does not want to comfort her, so he remains silent and decides to leave the apartment.

Later, a wake is held for the baby. All of the members attend, except Horacio, who is once again wandering the streets of Paris without a destination. When he finally returns to the apartment, various days have passed and la Maga has disappeared. Gregorovius, who is now living in the apartment, implies that la Maga may have returned to her native Montevideo, but Horacio doubts that she has the means to afford the trip. He feigns disinterest, but he suspects that la Maga may have committed suicide after the wake. Another possibility is that she had gone to stay with Pola (who had been diagnosed with breast cancer).

While walking along the bank of the Seine, Horacio runs into an indigent person who he and la Maga had met before, though Horacio does not recall the specific details. Having nowhere to go, Horacio decides to sit and talk with the beggar for a time. Her name, Horacio remembers, is Emmanuele. He accepts the woman&#x27;s request to buy wine and drink together. Both end up intoxicated below a bridge. Emmanuele attempts to give Horacio oral sex, but the police arrive and arrest them.

They are taken to the police station along with two pederasts. During the journey, Oliveira continues to reflect on his search for unity and his relationship with la Maga. The pederasts, meanwhile, argue about a kaleidoscope. They note that the &quot;beautiful patterns&quot; inside are only visible when the lighting is correct.

The first part of the book ends with Oliveira&#x27;s intuition that heaven is not a place above the Earth, but on the surface of it. However, people tend to approach it in a similar manner to the way children play hopscotch.

==Plot (chapters 37–56)==

Chapters 37 to 56 are collected under the heading &quot;From this Side&quot;, and the action takes place in Argentina. It opens with a brief introduction to the life of Manolo Traveler, Horacio Oliveira&#x27;s friend from childhood, who lives in Buenos Aires with his wife Talita. Although Traveler is restless, the marriage appears to be on solid ground until Gekrepten, Horacio&#x27;s old Argentinian lover, informs him that Horacio is due to arrive by boat. The news fills Traveler with a dark sense of foreboding; nonetheless, he and Talita greet Horacio at the docks, where Oliveira momentarily mistakes Talita for La Maga. Horacio then settles with Gekrepten in a hotel room located directly across the street from the flat Traveler and Talita share, where his mind slowly begins to unravel.

Traveler and Talita work for a circus, and when Horacio&#x27;s temporary employment falls through, Traveler arranges for his old friend to be hired on there as well, though not without misgivings. Oliveira&#x27;s presence has begun to disturb him, but he is unable to determine why. He wishes to ascribe it to Horacio&#x27;s flirtations with Talita, but cannot do so, as there seems to be something more going on. And anyway, he has no doubts about his wife&#x27;s remaining faithful to him. Unable to decipher the mystery, and unable to tell Horacio to leave them alone, he begins to sleep less and less, and his sense of restlessness increases.

Horacio, meanwhile, observing the relationship between Traveler and Talita, who more and more reminds him of La Maga, endeavors to enter more intimately into their lives, but he is unable to do so. His frustrations increase, and he begins to show signs of impending mental breakdown. One hot afternoon, he spends hours on the floor trying to straighten nails, although he has no particular use in mind for them. He then convinces Traveler and Talita to help him build a makeshift bridge between the windows of the two buildings over which Talita can cross. Traveler indulges his friend&#x27;s eccentric behavior, but Talita is frightened and must be prodded into participating. She feels it is a test of some sort. In the end, Talita does not cross between the buildings.

Soon after this incident, the owner of the circus sells the operation to a Brazilian businessman and invests in a local mental institution. Traveler, Talita and Horacio decide to go to work there despite the irony of the situation, or perhaps because of it. Horacio jests that the patients in the hospital will be no more mad than the three of them, anyway. On the day the ownership of the hospital is to be transferred, they are told that all the inmates must agree to the deal by signing a document, and that the three of them must act as witnesses. They meet a good-natured orderly named Remorino as well as a Dr. Ovejero, who manages the facility. The former owner of the circus and his wife, Cuca, are also present. One by one the inmates are led in to sign the document, a procedure that lasts well into the night.

Talita becomes the resident pharmacist at the hospital, while Horacio and Traveler act as either orderlies or guards at night. The place is dark and eerie in the long hours before dawn, with the three often seeking refuge in alcohol and conversation in the pharmacy&#x27;s warmer atmosphere. Remorino shows Horacio and Traveler the basement, where dead bodies are kept and cold beer can be had.

One night Horacio is smoking in his room when he sees Talita crossing the moonlit garden below, apparently heading to bed. A moment later, he thinks he sees La Maga appear and begin a game of hopscotch in the same general area; but when she looks up at him, he realizes it is Talita, who had turned and recrossed the garden. A kind of guilt, fed in part by the institution&#x27;s gloomy atmosphere, begins to steal into his musings, and it is not long before he conceives of the idea of someone&#x27;s trying to murder him while he is on duty—perhaps Traveler.

Later in the night, while Oliveira is on the second floor pondering over the symbolic implications of the mental institution&#x27;s elevator, Talita approaches and the two talk about holes, passages, pits, and La Maga, and as they do, the elevator comes to life, ascending from the basement. One of the mental patients is inside. After sending the man back to his room, Horacio and Talita decide to go down, ostensibly to see what he was up to.

Alone with Talita and the dead bodies, Horacio finds himself talking to her not as if she reminded him of La Maga, but as if she &quot;were&quot; La Maga. In a final moment of desperation, he attempts to kiss this Talita/La Maga mixture, but is repelled. Returning to her room, Talita tells Traveler about it, who surmises that something may be seriously wrong with his friend.

Meanwhile, having retreated to his own room, Horacio is now convinced that Traveler is coming to kill him. He begins to construct a kind of defense line in the dark room that is intended to confuse and irritate an attack, rather than deter it: water-filled basins placed on the floor, for example, as well as threads tied to heavy objects (which are in turn tied to the doorknob).

Horacio then sits in the dark on the opposite side of the room, near the window, waiting to see what will happen. The hours pass slowly and painfully, but finally Traveler does try to come in, and the tumult that results brings Dr. Ovejero and the others out into the garden, where they find Oliveira leaning out the window of his room as if intending to let himself fall. Traveler tries to talk Horacio out of doing what he, for his part, insists he doesn&#x27;t intend to do, though at the conclusion of this part of the book, he suddenly muses that maybe he does mean to do such a thing after all, that maybe it is for the best, and the end of the passage is wholly open to this interpretation. Only by proceeding to read the &quot;Expendable Chapters&quot; will the reader be able to place Horacio firmly back inside the mental institution, where, after being sedated by Ovejero, he succumbs to a lengthy delirium.

==The &quot;Expendable Chapters&quot;==

The third section of the book, under the heading &quot;From Diverse Sides&quot;, does not need to be read in order to understand the plot, but it does contain solutions to certain puzzles that arise during the perusal of the first two parts. For example, the reader finds out a great deal more about the mysterious Morelli, as well as finding out how La Maga and Emmanuele first became acquainted. Through Morelli&#x27;s writings, Cortazar hints at some of the motives behind the actual construction of &quot;Hopscotch&quot; (such as a desire to write a work in which the reader is a true co-conspirator). The inner workings of Horacio Oliveira himself are described in a much less evasive manner than in any previous chapters, as well. The section, and the book, ends with Horacio visiting Morelli in the hospital, who asks him to go to his apartment and organize his notebooks while he is away. Most of these notebooks are unpublished and Oliveira not only considers doing this work as a great honor to himself personally, but also as perhaps the best chance yet of his attaining the ninth square in his lifelong game of spiritual, emotional, and metaphysical hopscotch.

==Characters==

The main character, Horacio Oliveira, is a well-read and loquacious bohemian. He enjoys a mostly intellectual participation in life, as is characterized by his general passivity towards his environment, and appears to be obsessed with attaining what is referred to as a unifying conception of life, or center in which he can contentedly exist.

&quot;La Maga&quot; (a nickname, as her real name is Lucía) is a beguiling, intelligent being whose love of life and spontaneous nature challenge Horacio&#x27;s ego as well as his assumptions about life. Oliveira&#x27;s lover in Paris, she is lively, an active participant in her own adventures, and a stark contrast to Horacio&#x27;s other friends, with whom he has formed a philosophical social circle called the Serpent Club. She eventually develops into an indispensable muse for Horacio and a lens he employs to examine himself and the world in a more three dimensional manner. La Maga also has an infant son, Rocamadour, whose appearance in France causes a crisis in the relationship between Lucía and Oliveira.

Apart from Horacio and La Maga, the other members of the Serpent Club include Ossip Gregorovius, who is presented as a rival for Lucía&#x27;s affections, the artists Perico Romero and Etienne, Etienne&#x27;s friend Guy Monod, Wong, and Ronald and Babs (who are married). The club meets either in La Maga&#x27;s apartment or the flat Ronald and Babs share.

When Horacio returns to Argentina he is greeted by his old friend Manolo, nicknamed &quot;Traveler&quot;, and his wife, Talita. The two are employed at a circus and seem to enjoy a mostly serene existence. Talita bears a striking similarity to Horacio&#x27;s great love interest, La Maga, while Traveler is referred to as his &quot;doppelgänger.&quot; The relationship that develops between the three centers around Oliveira&#x27;s interest in Talita, which seems disingenuous, and Traveler&#x27;s attempts to lessen Horacio&#x27;s metaphysical burden. Oliveira desires to inhabit Traveler&#x27;s life, while Traveler appears to be mostly concerned with his friend&#x27;s deteriorating mental health.

Other major characters include Pola, another Parisian love interest of Horacio&#x27;s, who is diagnosed with breast cancer after being cursed by La Maga; Gekrepten, Horacio&#x27;s lover in Argentina; and Morelli, an Italian writer much discussed by the Serpent Club. Minor characters of note include Madame Berthe Trepat, a composer who mistakes Horacio&#x27;s attention for sexual interest, and a homeless woman named Emmanuele with whom Oliveira has a brief, disastrous tryst shortly after La Maga&#x27;s disappearance.

==Main themes==

===Order vs. chaos===
Horacio says of himself, &quot;I imposed the false order that hides the chaos, pretending that I was dedicated to a profound existence while all the time it was the one that barely dipped its toe into the terrible waters&quot; (end of chapter 21). Horacio&#x27;s life follows this description as he switches countries, jobs, and lovers. The novel also attempts to resemble order while ultimately consisting of chaos. It possesses a beginning and an end but traveling from one to the other seems to be a random process. Horacio&#x27;s fate is just as vague to the reader as it is to him. The same idea is perfectly expressed in improvisational jazz. Over several measures, melodies are randomly constructed by following loose musical rules. Cortázar does the same by using a loose form of prose, rich in metaphor and slang, to describe life.

===Horacio vs. society===
Horacio drifts from city to city, job to job, love to love, life to life, yet even in his nomadic existence he tries to find a sense of order in the world&#x27;s chaos. He is always isolated: When he is with La Maga, he cannot relate to her; when he is with the Club, he is superior; when he is with Traveler and Talita, he fights their way of life. Even when with Morelli, the character he relates to most, there exists the social barriers of patient and orderly. Order versus chaos also exists in the structure of the novel, as in Morelli&#x27;s statement, &quot;You can read my book any way you want to” (556). At the end of chapter 56, he realizes that he is neither on &#x27;the territory&#x27; (Traveler&#x27;s side, with society) nor on &#x27;the bedroom&#x27; (what would be his side, his real place, if he had reached it).

===The conundrum of consciousness===
One of the biggest arguments between Horacio and Ossip, one that threatens to put a rift in the club, is what Horacio deems &quot;the conundrum of consciousness&quot; (99). Does art prove consciousness? Or is it simply a continuation of instinctual leanings toward the collective brain? Talita argues a similar point in her seesaw-questions game with Horacio, who believes that only when one lives in the abstract and lets go of biological history can one achieve consciousness.

===The definition of failure===
Horacio&#x27;s life seems hopeless because he has deemed himself a failure. La Maga&#x27;s life seems hopeless because she has never worked to resolve the issues of rape and abuse in her childhood. Traveler&#x27;s life seems hopeless because he has never done what he wanted to do, and even the name he has adopted teases at this irony. But none of these people are considered by outward society to be failures. They are stuck where they are because of their own self-defeating attitudes.

Short chapters also express the idea that there is no penetrating purpose to the novel and life in general. For Horacio, life is a series of artistic flashes by which he perceives the world in profound ways but still remains unable to create anything of value. Other major themes include obsession, madness, life-as-a-circus, the nature and meaning of sex, and self-knowledge.

==Influences==
The novel was the inspiration for Yuval Sharon&#x27;s 2015 production of &quot;Hopscotch&quot;, an opera by six composers and six librettists set on multiple stages in Los Angeles.

The Gotan Project&#x27;s 2010 studio album &quot;Tango 3.0&quot; includes a song &quot;Rayuela&quot; written in honor of the author.

<text>Shadow counsel or a shadow lawyer is a term used in law to mean an appointed, duplicate lawyer as an auxiliary or alternate, should the original lawyer (or legal team) fail in some way.

Shadow counsel is a legal term referring to a second lawyer that is appointed in secrecy to protect a witness from the other defendants who may be sharing the same lawyer (and thus, the known appointed lawyer is biased). Such a situation could be a drug conspiracy or people forced into being accomplices by a mob leader. Shadow counsel advises in the best interests of the witness. Lawyer and former prosecutor and judge Leslie Crocker Snyder invoked the privilege for a defendant whose trial she presided over so he could be safe as an informant against a drug ring leader he was afraid would replace his counsel. Despite its full legal allowance, Snyder faced serious backlash from opposition deliberately being uninformed in the interest of maintaining the trial&#x27;s security. 

Some fictional, yet informative, examples would be the &quot;Law &amp; Order&quot; episode &quot;Shadow&quot; (season 8, episode 8) and the &quot;Law &amp; Order: SVU&quot; episode &quot;Ace&quot; (season 11, episode 22). Snyder was a consultant for the franchise and even guest appearances in &quot;Law &amp; Order&quot;.The concept also appeared in Season 5 of &quot;The Practice&quot;, episode 10 &quot;Friends and Ex-Lovers.&quot;

<doc id="841110" wikidata="Q3808438" url="?curid=841110" title="The Jimmy Stewart Show">
<text>The Jimmy Stewart Show is an American sitcom starring James Stewart as a college professor in a small town who shares his home with three generations of his family. Twenty-four episodes of the show were broadcast during the 1971–72 season on NBC.

== Synopsis ==
Dr. James K. Howard, known as Jim, is an anthropology professor at Josiah Kessel College, the small-town institution of higher learning founded by his grandfather Josiah Kessel in the fictional town of Easy Valley in Northern California. Jim — whose middle name is Kessel — lives with his wife of 30 years, Martha, and their eight-year-old son Teddy. Jim also has a 29-year-old son, Peter J. Howard, Sr., known as &quot;P.J.,&quot; who owns the Easy Valley Construction Company, where his pretty and perky wife Wendy assists him. P.J. and Wendy also have an eight-year-old son, Peter J. &quot;Jake&quot; Howard, Jr., who is Teddy&#x27;s nephew but finds it strange to refer to Teddy as his uncle; the two boys often bicker over what to call one another and who should show greater respect to whom. Jim&#x27;s easygoing life becomes complicated when he inadvertently burns down P.J. and Wendy&#x27;s house and he and Martha invite P.J., Wendy, and Jake to move in with them temporarily. Jim is good-natured, and the two families do the best they can to get along in the overcrowded house, but conflicts are inevitable.

Dr. Luther Quince, a Nobel Prize-winning chemistry professor, is a faculty colleague of Jim&#x27;s at the college and quite a contrast to Jim — Luther drives a Rolls-Royce while Jim rides a bicycle to class, and Luther thinks of himself as having refined tastes, while Jim plays the accordion. Nonetheless, the two men are good friends. One of Martha&#x27;s projects is a portrait of Luther, which she has been painting for a long time but never seems to finish. Woodrow Yamada is the Howards&#x27; talkative milkman.

In the show&#x27;s opening credits, Stewart (as Professor Howard) bicycles through the community. Stewart speaks directly to the camera and out of character at the beginning of each episode, introducing himself as &quot;Jim Stewart&quot; and telling the audience the title of the episode. At the end of each episode, he again speaks to the viewers, expressing the hope that they will return for the following week&#x27;s show and wishing them &quot;peace and love and laughter&quot;. In some episodes, he speaks to the viewers at other times as well, in character as Jim Howard, with any other actors in the scene behaving as if Jim is talking to himself.

Episodes occasionally include flashbacks depicting Jim Howard&#x27;s grandfather, Josiah Kessel. In these flashbacks, Stewart portrays Kessel and Stewart&#x27;s real-life wife, Gloria Stewart, plays Kessel&#x27;s wife.

* Dennis Larson as Teddy Howard
* Kirby Furlong as Peter J. &quot;Jake&quot; Howard, Jr.

==Production==
The show is notable as the only television or film production in which Stewart allowed himself to be billed on-screen as &quot;Jimmy.&quot; In all of his movies, he was billed as &quot;James Stewart&quot; (although he also used &quot;Jimmy&quot; for his book &quot;Jimmy Stewart and His Poems&quot;).

&quot;The Jimmy Stewart Show&quot; had no laugh track. Procter &amp; Gamble sponsored the show.

In the episode &quot;The Identity Crisis,&quot; Beulah Bondi portrayed James Stewart&#x27;s mother. She also played his mother in four films: &quot;It&#x27;s a Wonderful Life&quot;, &quot;Mr. Smith Goes to Washington&quot;, &quot;Of Human Hearts&quot;, and &quot;Vivacious Lady&quot;.

According to series producer Hal Kanter, Stewart objected to a scene where African American actor Hal Williams, played a police officer who would &quot;lash out&quot; at Stewart&#x27;s character. Kanter claimed Stewart did not like the idea of an African American police officer &quot;lecturing him&quot; and threatened to dismiss Williams. However, once Kanter explained that Williams was to play an FBI agent in a different episode, Stewart felt &quot;chagrined&quot; by the mistake. However, historian Shannon Allen disputes Kanter&#x27;s, noting that no FBI agent ever appeared on &quot;The Jimmy Stewart Show&quot;, that Williams does play a police officer in Episode 6, and the two interactions that Stewart has with white police officers on the show do not fit Kanter&#x27;s description of the scene.

==Reception==

The show fared poorly critically, was also a ratings disappointment, and was cancelled after only one season. It finished 44th out of 78 shows that season with a 17.7 rating.

==Broadcast history==

&quot;The Jimmy Stewart Show&quot; premiered on September 19, 1971. Its 24th and last original episode was broadcast on March 12, 1972. Reruns of the show then aired in its regular time slot until August 27, 1972. It was broadcast on NBC on Sundays from 8:30 to 9:00 p.m. Eastern Time throughout its run.

Through its various subsidiaries, Richemont produces and sells jewellery, watches, leather goods, pens, firearms, clothing, and accessories. Richemont is publicly traded as CFR on the SIX Swiss Exchange and the JSE.

The brands it owns include A. Lange &amp; Söhne, Alaïa, AZ Factory, Baume &amp; Mercier, Buccellati, Cartier, Chloé, Delvaux, Dunhill, IWC Schaffhausen, Jaeger-LeCoultre, Montblanc, Mr Porter, Net-a-Porter, Panerai, Piaget, Peter Millar, Purdey, Roger Dubuis, Serapian, The Outnet, TimeVallée, Vacheron Constantin, Van Cleef &amp; Arpels, Vhernier, Watchfinder &amp; Co., and Yoox.

As of October 2023, Compagnie Financière Richemont S.A. was the sixth-largest corporation by market capitalization in the Swiss Market Index.

==History==
Johann Rupert founded Compagnie Financière Richemont S.A. when he spun off the international assets of Rembrandt Group Ltd. (now Remgro Limited), a South Africa-based company founded in the 1940s by his father, Anton Rupert. The division, originally founded on 5 March 1979 as Intercontinental Mining and Resources S.A., was later renamed IMR Group S.A. on 31 March 1987 and finally Richemont S.A. on 17 August 1988. The spin-off was completed on 20 September 1988. The luxury goods investments of Rembrandt Group combined with Rothmans International formed the initial group of Richemont subsidiaries.

In October 2008, the Group divested all of its remaining interests in the tobacco industry.

As of 2014, Richemont is the second-largest luxury goods company in the world after LVMH.

In 2015, Richemont&#x27;s Net-a-Porter Group was merged with the YOOX Group in an all-share transaction. In August 2022, Richemont announced the prospective sale of a 47.5% stake in Yoox Net-a-Porter (YNAP) to Farfetch in exchange for Farfetch shares, and the sale of a 3.2% stake to Mohamed Alabbar. In January 2024, Farfetch was acquired by Korean e-commerce company Coupang, and delisted, which ended Richemont&#x27;s planned sale of the YNAP majority stake.

In 2018, Jérôme Lambert was named CEO of Richemont Group.

The compensation of the Richemont group&#x27;s executives increased by an average of 14% in 2018.

In July 2023, Richemont acquired a 70% stake in Italian shoemaker Gianvito Rossi.

As of October 2023, Compagnie Financière Richemont S.A. was the sixth-largest corporation by market capitalization in the Swiss Market Index.

In May 2024, Nicolas Bos, the head of Van Cleef &amp; Arpels was appointed CEO effective June 1 2024, replacing Jérôme Lambert. Jérôme Lambert would stay at Richemont Group as Chief Operating Officer reporting to Bos.

In May 2024, Richemont acquired Italian jewellery brand Vhernier for an undisclosed sum.

==Organization==
Compagnie Financière Richemont S.A. organizes its business activities into three operating divisions: Jewellery Maisons, Specialist Watchmakers, and Other Businesses.

Cartier, Van Cleef &amp; Arpels, and Buccellati constitute the Jewellery Maisons.

The Specialist Watchmakers group is composed of A. Lange &amp; Söhne, Baume &amp; Mercier, IWC Schaffhausen, Jaeger-LeCoultre, Officine Panerai, Piaget, Roger Dubuis, and Vacheron Constantin.

The Other Businesses division includes Alaïa, AZ Factory, Chloé, Delvaux, Dunhill, Montblanc, Peter Millar, Purdey, and Serapian.

==Ownership and control==

It held 6,263,000 Richemont Class &quot;A&quot; shares and 522,000,000 Richemont Class &quot;B&quot; registered shares, representing 10% of the equity of the company and controlling 51% of the company&#x27;s voting rights.

<doc id="841120" wikidata="Q7883416" url="?curid=841120" title="Under the Umbrella Tree">
<text>Under the Umbrella Tree is a Canadian children&#x27;s television series created by Noreen Young that originally aired on CBC from 1987 to 1993. It was produced by CBC and Noreen Young Productions, and later by The Disney Channel, which began airing it on May 7, 1990.

The series centers on a quartet of main characters who share a house on Spring Street in a suburb of Ottawa, Ontario. The characters include Holly (a human), Iggy (an iguana), Jacob (a blue jay), and Gloria (a gopher). The show&#x27;s title is derived from the fact that the characters live together in a home featuring a prominent indoor umbrella tree.

When production of the show ended in 1993, syndication continued on The Disney Channel and Canal Famille until 1997. Twenty-seven episodes of the show were released to DVD by Cinerio Entertainment in partnership with Noreen Young in 2006, following a long wait for expiration of ownership rights. In 2019, Gloria, Iggy and Jacob were featured in episode 1 of &quot;Cavendish&quot;, in Andy and Mark&#x27;s childhood bedroom.
In 2020, the original cast (Holly Larocque, Noreen Young, Stephen Brathwaite and Bob Stutt) reunited to make a video called &quot;Under the Umbrella Tree: The Mask Special&quot;, which was uploaded to YouTube and Facebook.

==Overview==
===Premise===
A total of 285 episodes were produced over the years, with 270 being 15 minutes long and 15 being 30-minute specials. Every episode focuses on a different theme, such as sports, holidays, singing, dancing, exercise and various other activities. Valuable life lessons are often woven into every story, such as the importance of keeping promises, being considerate of others or assuming responsibility for one&#x27;s actions. The show&#x27;s characters were created by Ken Sobol, who also wrote the majority of the series episodes. Sobol had previously worked closely with Noreen Young on &quot;Readalong&quot; and &quot;Téléfrançais&quot;, two other children&#x27;s television series.

===Characters===
====Main====
* Gloria Gladys Grace Gabrielle Gardenia Glenda Gale Gopher (performed by Noreen Young) – Gloria is the only female puppet in the Umbrella Tree household and lives and sleeps underneath it, entering her burrow from behind the couch. She enjoys music and other performing arts, keeping her more particular interests secret, even from her best friends. She is a tomboy and does not like being treated like a girl.
* Holly Penelope Higgins (played by Holly Larocque) – The only human character. She serves as a parental figure and mentor for the three puppet characters, although she considers them more as her &quot;roommates&quot;. She handles most of the cleaning and cooking and pays the rent. She is funny, artistic, patient and generous. She has an Uncle Jack (played by Don Westwood) and an Aunt Jill who never visits; they are a musical duo in England.
* Ignatz &quot;Iggy&quot; Julio Iguana (performed by Bob Stutt) – Iggy sleeps on the shelf at the Umbrella Tree residence, sometimes thinking too highly of himself and making honest mistakes. He plays guitar when not rivaling his friend Jacob in sports and beyond. His uncle, Rod Iguana, lives in Arizona, as do his cousins, Emmet and Camille. The shortest of the group, he habitually tricks people into looking at their shirts, then points at their noses and laughs.

* Jacob Barnaby Blue (performed by Stephen Brathwaite) – Jacob sometimes enters the house by flying through open windows. He usually sleeps in his own bird house on the patio. Other times, he invents things which seldom work as he plans, resulting in a humorous outcome. He tends to get things mixed up and say &quot;I knew that&quot; when he learns something. He is the second-tallest of the group. As revealed in &quot;How it All Began&quot;, he was the apartment&#x27;s original occupant. Iggy and Gloria soon followed; Holly came later. He was named after his twenty-times great-grandfather, Sir Jacob of Blue, said to have invented the catapult, defeated the evil Duke of Doublepeck and married the good Lady Flyella.

====Other====
* Lewis A. Byrd (performed by Bob Stutt) – Lewis is a friend of the Umbrella Tree gang who works at the Bird Migration Office, usually involved in festivities outside the apartment or in dialogue within several episodes. He is a stuffy workaholic who needs to feel needed. He is well known for overusing the term &quot;indeed&quot; and usually adds the phrase &quot;hmm, indeed!&quot; at the end of his statements. He also has a crush on Holly, which is revealed in the Valentine&#x27;s Day episode with his secret admirer attempts.
* Mitzi the Dog (performed by Holly Larocque) – Mitzi is Gloria&#x27;s best friend who is always seeming to get either herself or Gloria in trouble.
* Charles &quot;Chuck&quot; Chickadee (performed by Bob Stutt) – Chuck is Jacob&#x27;s best friend who is extremely talkative and sometimes gets on everyone&#x27;s nerves because of this.
* Chester Chickadee (performed by Stephen Brathwaite) - Chuck&#x27;s father.
* Charlene Chickadee (performed by Noreen Young) – Chuck&#x27;s mother.
* Chelsea Chickadee (performed by Noreen Young) - Chuck&#x27;s little sister.

==Broadcast==
In 1997, &quot;Under the Umbrella Tree&quot; reruns were placed on hiatus, after The Disney Channel stopped allowing the airing of the program and shelved the episodes. Since Disney owned all rights to the show, airing reruns on another television station was not possible until the rights expired in 2005. From 2009 to 2011, &quot;Under The Umbrella Tree&quot; aired on TV3 Medford weekdays and weekends as part of the network&#x27;s children&#x27;s block.

Starting in 2018 a number of episodes had been made available on the Canada Media Fund&#x27;s YouTube channel Encore+ in both English and French. However, on December 1, 2022, Encore+ shut down its French- and English-language YouTube pages.

<doc id="841140" wikidata="Q486181" url="?curid=841140" title="Samanid Empire">
<text>The Samanid Empire () was a Persianate Sunni Muslim empire, ruled by a dynasty of Iranian &quot;dehqan&quot; origin. The empire was centred in Khorasan and Transoxiana, at its greatest extent encompassing northeastern Iran and Central Asia, from 819 to 999.

Four brothers—Nuh, Ahmad, Yahya, and Ilyas—founded the Samanid state. Each of them ruled territories under Abbasid suzerainty. In 892, Ismail Samani (892–907) united the Samanid state under one ruler, thus effectively putting an end to the feudal system used by the Samanids. It was also under him that the Samanids became independent of Abbasid authority. However, by 945, the government was under the de facto control of the Turkic military slave faction, and the Samanid family&#x27;s authority had become purely symbolic.

The Samanid Empire is part of the Iranian Intermezzo, which saw the creation of a Persianate culture and identity that brought Iranian speech and traditions into the fold of the Islamic world. This later contributed to the formation of the Turko-Persian culture.

The Samanids promoted the arts, giving rise to the advancement of science and literature, and thus attracted scholars such as Rudaki, Ferdowsi, and Avicenna. While under Samanid control, Bukhara was a rival to Baghdad in its glory. Scholars note that the Samanids revived Persian language and culture more than the Buyids and the Saffarids while continuing to use Arabic for sciences as well as religious studies. They considered themselves to be descendants of the Sasanian Empire. In a famous edict, Samanid authorities declared that &quot;here, in this region, the language is Persian, and the kings of this realm are Persian kings.&quot;

== History ==

=== Origins ===
The Samanid dynasty was founded by Saman Khuda, his descendants became rulers of the Samanid Empire. He was a &quot;dehqan&quot; of Iranian origin from the village of Saman in Balkh province, in present-day northern Afghanistan. The earliest appearance of the Samanid family appears to be in Greater Khorasan rather than Transoxiana. In some sources, the Samanids claimed to be descended from the House of Mihran of Bahram Chobin. This claim is further supported by a geographical treatise from the second half of the 8th century, compiled by five choirs (Togonians) and translated into the Tibetan language. In this chronicle, it is mentioned that the descendants of Bahram Chobin migrated to Balkh and settled there. According to Gumilev, they were considered the ancestors of the Samanids. This provides evidence of the claim even before the Samanid Empire existed. It has been claimed that the House of Saman belonged to the Oghuz Turks, although the veracity is unlikely. Originally a Zoroastrian, Saman Khuda converted to Islam during the governorship of Asad ibn Abdallah al-Qasri in Khorasan, and named his oldest son as Asad ibn Saman in the governor&#x27;s honour. In 819, the governor of Greater Khorasan, Ghassan ibn Abbad, rewarded the four sons of Asad ibn Saman for their aid against the rebel Rafi ibn al-Layth. Nuh ibn Asad received Samarkand; Ahmad ibn Asad received Farghana; Yahya ibn Asad received Tashkent, and Ilyas ibn Asad received Herat.

=== Rise ===

==== The Samanids in Herat (819–857) ====

Ilyas died in 856, and his son Ibrahim ibn Ilyas became his successor. The Tahirid governor of Khorasan, Muhammad ibn Tahir, subsequently appointed him as the commander of his army, and sent him on an expedition against the Saffarid ruler Ya&#x27;qub ibn al-Layth al-Saffar in Sistan. After facing defeat in battle near Pushang in 857, he fled to Nishapur, only to be captured by Ya&#x27;qub al-Saffar and sent to Sistan as a hostage.

==== The Samanid dynasty in Transoxiana (819–892) ====
In 839/40, Nuh seized Isfijab from the nomadic pagan Turks living in the steppe. Consequently, he had a wall constructed around the city to protect it from their attacks. He died in 841/2—his two brothers Yahya and Ahmad, were then appointed as the joint rulers of the city by the Tahirid governor of Khorasan. After Yahya died in 855, Ahmad took control over Châch, thus becoming the ruler of most of Transoxiana. He died in 864/5; his son Nasr I received Farghana and Samarkand, while his other son Ya&#x27;qub received Châch (areas around modern Tashkent/Chachkent).

Meanwhile, the Tahirids&#x27; authority had significantly weakened after suffering several defeats to Saffarid ruler Ya&#x27;qub al-Saffar. Hence, causing the Tahirids to lose their grip over the Samanids, who became more or less independent. Nasr I, used this opportunity to strengthen his authority by sending his brother Ismail to Bukhara, which was in an unstable condition after suffering from raids by the Afrighid dynasty of Khwarazm. When Ismail reached the city, he was warmly received by its inhabitants, who saw him as one who could restore order.

After not so long, disagreement over where to distribute tax money caused a conflict between the brothers. Ismail was eventually victorious in the dynastic struggle and took control of the Samanid state. However, Nasr had been the one who had been invested with Transoxiana, and the Abbasid caliphs continued to recognize him as the rightful ruler. Because of this, Ismail continued to recognize his brother as well, but Nasr was completely powerless, a situation that would continue until his death in August 892.

=== Final unification and height of power (892–907) ===

Following Nasr&#x27;s death, Ismail moved the capital of the Samanid dynasty from Samarkand to Bukhara. A few months later the Saffarid emir, Ya&#x27;qub al-Saffar, also died and was succeeded by his brother Amr ibn al-Layth, who saw himself as the heir of the Saffarids. In the spring of 900, Amr clashed with Ismail near Balkh, but was defeated and taken into captivity. Ismail thereafter sent him to Baghdad, where he was executed. Ismail was thereafter recognized as the ruler of all of Khorasan and Transoxiana by the caliph. Furthermore, he also received the investiture over Tabaristan, Ray and Isfahan. It was also during this period that the Afrighid dynasty was forced into submission.

Before Ismail Samani&#x27;s major victory against the Saffarids, he had made various expeditions in Transoxiana; in 892, he put an end to the Principality of Ushrusana by seizing all of its lands. During the same period, he put an end to the Bukhar Khudas in Bukhara. In 893, Ismail Samani invaded the territories of the Karluk Turks, taking Talas and converting the Nestorian church there into a mosque. The same year, he conducted a campaign to gather slaves, taking ten to fifteen thousand captives.
The Samanid slave trade was the main trade income of the Samanid Empire, forming the base of economy of the state.

In 900, Ismail sent an army under Muhammad ibn Harun al-Sarakhsi against Muhammad ibn Zayd, the Zaydi ruler of Tabaristan and Gorgan. The invasion was successful; Muhammad ibn Zayd was killed and Tabaristan was conquered by the Samanids. However, Muhammad ibn Harun shortly revolted, forcing Ismail himself to invade the region the following year. Muhammad ibn Harun thereafter fled to Daylam, while Ismail reconquered Tabaristan and Gorgan. In 901, Amr Saffari was defeated at the battle of Balkh by the Samanids, which reduced the Saffarid dynasty to a minor tributary in Sistan. It was during this period that the Samanids were at their height of power, ruling as far as Qazvin in the west and Peshawar in the east.

Ismail is known in history as a competent general and a strong ruler; many stories about him are written in Arabic and Persian sources. Furthermore, because of his campaigns in the north, his empire was so safe from enemy incursions that the defences of Bukhara and Samarkand went unused. However, this later had consequences; at the end of the dynasty, the walls—earlier strong, but now falling apart—were greatly missed by the Samanids, who were constantly under attack by the Karakhanids and other enemies.

Ismail died in November 907, and was succeeded by his son Ahmad Samani (r. 907–914).

=== Intermediate period (907–961) ===

Not long after his accession, Ahmad invaded Sistan; by 911, Sistan was under complete Samanid control, and Ahmad&#x27;s cousin Abu Salih Mansur was appointed as its governor. Meanwhile, an Alid named Hasan al-Utrush was slowly re-establishing Zaydi over Tabaristan. In 913, Ahmad sent an army under Muhammad ibn Sa&#x27;luk to deal with him. Although the Samanid army was much larger, Hasan managed to emerge victorious. Ahmad, before he could plan another expedition to Tabaristan, was the following year murdered by some of his slaves in a tent near Bukhara. During his reign, Ahmad is also said to have replaced the language of the court from Persian to Arabic, which made him unpopular among his subjects, and forced him to change it back to Persian. After Ahmad&#x27;s death, his eight-year-old son Nasr II (r. 914–943) succeeded him.

Due to Nasr&#x27;s youth, his prime minister Abu &#x27;Abd-Allah al-Jaihani took care over most of the state affairs. Jaihani was not only an experienced administrator, but also a prominent geographer and greatly educated man. Almost right after Nasr II had ascended the throne, several revolts erupted, the most dangerous one being under his paternal grand-uncle, Ishaq ibn Ahmad, who seized Samarkand and began minting coins there, while his son Abu Salih Mansur seized Nishapur and several cities in Khorasan. Ishaq was eventually defeated and captured, while Abu Salih Mansur died of natural causes in 915. Some time later Nasr II once again had to deal with rebels; in 919, the governor of Khorasan, Husayn ibn Ali Marvarrudhi, rebelled against Samanid authority. Nasr responded by sending an army under Ahmad ibn Sahl to suppress the rebellion, which the latter managed to accomplish. After a few weeks, however, Ahmad shortly rebelled himself at Nishapur, made incursions into Gorgan, and then fortified himself in Merv to avoid a Samanid counter-attack. Nevertheless, the Samanid general Hamuya ibn Ali managed to lure Ahmad out of Merv, and defeated him in a battle at Marw al-Rudh; he was captured and imprisoned in Bukhara, where he remained until his death in 920.

At considerable expense, Nasr II b. Ahmad erected a new palace for himself and for his officials in Bukhara, in the ancient Rigistan region. In the west, Nasr II clashed several times with Daylamite and Gilite rulers. In 921, the Zaydids under the Gilite ruler Lili ibn al-Nu&#x27;man invaded Khorasan, but were defeated by the Simjurid general Simjur al-Dawati. Later in 930, a Dailamite military leader, Makan ibn Kaki, seized Tabaristan and Gurgan, and even took possession of Nishapur in western Khorasan. He was, however, forced to withdraw back to Tabaristan one year later, due to the threat that Samanids posed. Makan then returned to Tabaristan, where he was defeated by the Ziyarid ruler Mardavij, who managed to conquer the region. In 935, Nasr II re-established Samanid control in Gurgan and made Mardavij&#x27;s successor Vushmgir his vassal. However, in 939 he declared independence, but was defeated the following year at Iskhabad.

In 943 several Samanid army officers, angry at Nasr&#x27;s support of Isma&#x27;ili missionaries, formed a conspiracy to murder him. Nasr&#x27;s son Nuh I, however, learned of the conspiracy. He went to a banquet designed to organize the plot and had the head of their leader cut off. To appease the other officers, he promised to stop the Isma&#x27;ili missionaries from continuing their activities. He then convinced his father to abdicate, who died of tuberculosis after a few months.

Right when Nuh I ascended the throne, a revolt erupted in Khwarazm, which he managed to suppress. Later in 945, he had to deal with the Muhtajid ruler Abu &#x27;Ali Chaghani, who refused to relinquish his post as governor of Khorasan to Ibrahim ibn Simjur. Abu &#x27;Ali Chaghani then rebelled, and was joined by several prominent figures such as Abu Mansur Muhammad, whom he appointed as his commander-in-chief. In 947, he installed Nuh&#x27;s uncle Ibrahim ibn Ahmad as &quot;amir&quot; in Bukhara. Abu &#x27;Ali Chaghani then returned to his domains in Chaghaniyan. Ibrahim, however, was unpopular with the people of Bukhara, and Nuh soon retaliated by retaking the city and blinding Ibrahim and two brothers.

When Abu Ali Chaghani received the news of the re-capture of Bukhara, he once again marched towards it, but was defeated by an army sent by Nuh and withdrew back to Chaghaniyan. After some time, he left the region and tried to obtain support from other Samanid vassals. Meanwhile, Nuh had Chaghaniyan ravaged and its capital sacked. Another battle shortly ensued between Abu &#x27;Ali Chaghani and a Samanid army in Tukharistan, which resulted in a Samanid victory. Fortunately for Abu Ali Chaghani, he managed to secure the support of other Samanid vassals, such as the rulers of Khuttal, and the Kumiji mountain people, but in the end made peace with Nuh, who allowed him to keep Chaghaniyan in return for sending his son Abu&#x27;l Muzaffar Abdallah as hostage to Bukhara.

By 945, the Turkic military slave faction (who were formerly recruited by the Samanid rulers in positions of governance) were fully in charge of the government. By this time, the Samanid family only held nominal power; similar to how the Buyids held de facto power over the Abbasid Caliphate around the same time.

Alp Tigin, nominal vassal of the Samanids, conquered Ghazna in 962 from the Lawik dynasty. The fifth of these commanders was Sebüktigin, who governed Ḡazna for twenty years till 387 AH/997 CE with the title (as it appears from his tomb inscription) of al-ḥājeb al-ajall (most noble commander). He would later be the founder of an independent dynasty based in Ghazna, following the decline of the Samanid Empire in the 990s.

=== Decline and fall (961–999) ===
The power of the Samanids began to crumble in the latter half of the 10th century. In 962, one of the ghulams, Alp Tigin, commander of the army in Khorasan, seized Ghazna and established himself there. His successors, however, including Sebük Tigin, continued to rule as Samanid &quot;governors&quot;. With the weakened Samanids facing rising challenges from the Karakhanids for control of Transoxiana, Sebük later took control of all the provinces south of the Oxus and established the Ghaznavid Empire.

In 992, a Karakhanid, Harun Bughra Khan, grandson of the paramount tribal chief of the Karluk confederation Sultan Satuq Bughra Khan, captured Bukhara, the Samanid capital. Harun died shortly afterwards, however, and the Samanids returned to Bukhara. In 999, Nasr b. Ali, a nephew of Harun, returned and took possession of Bukhara, meeting little resistance. The Samanid domains were split up between the Ghaznavids, who gained Khorasan and Afghanistan, and the Karakhanids, who received Transoxiana; the Oxus River thus became the boundary between the two rival empires.

=== Isma&#x27;il Muntasir&#x27;s attempt to resurrect the Samanid state (1000–1005) ===

Isma&#x27;il Muntasir was the youngest son of Nuh II—he was imprisoned by the Karakhanids after their conquest of Bukhara in 999. Some time later, Isma&#x27;il managed to escape to Khwarazm, where he gained support. Driving the Karakhanids out of Bukhara, he then moved on to and captured Samarkand. The approach of the Karakhanid army, however, forced Isma&#x27;il to give up all of his possessions, following which he travelled to Khorasan, where he captured Nishapur. Mahmud&#x27;s army, however, made its way to the region, and Isma&#x27;il decided it necessary to flee again.

In 1003 Isma&#x27;il came back to Transoxiana, where he requested and received assistance from the Oghuz Turks of the Zarafshan valley. They defeated the Karakhanids in several battles, even when Nasr Khan was involved. For various reasons, however, Isma&#x27;il came to feel that he could not rely on the Oghuz to restore him, so he went back to Khorasan. He tried to gain Mahmud&#x27;s support for a campaign to restore the Samanid state, but failed. Some time afterwards, he returned to the Zarafshan valley, where he gained the support of the Oghuz and others. A Karakhanid army was defeated in May 1004, but subsequently the Oghuz deserted Isma&#x27;il during another battle, and his army fell apart.

Fleeing to Khorasan yet again, Isma&#x27;il attempted to reenter Transoxiana in the end of 1004. The Karakhanids stopped this and Isma&#x27;il was nearly killed. Following this, he sought the hospitality of an Arab tribe near Merv. Their chief, however, killed Isma&#x27;il in 1005. His death marked the defeat of the last attempt to restore the Samanid state. Descendants of the Samanid family continued to live in Transoxiana where they were well regarded, but their power was relatively broken.

=== Iranian intermezzo ===
Along with several other states, the Samanid Empire was part of the Iranian Intermezzo, or &quot;Persian renaissance&quot;. This period has been described as having a key importance in the formation of the Islamic civilization, both politically and culturally. In political terms, it saw an effective break up of the Abbasid power and the rise of several successor states such as the Samanids and Buyids while in cultural terms, it witnessed the rise of new Persian as an administrative and literary language.

== Culture ==

=== Government ===

The system of the Samanid state was modelled after the Abbasid system, which in turn was modelled after the Sasanian system. The ruler of the state was the &quot;amir&quot;, and the provinces were governed by appointed governors or local vassal rulers. The administrative, political and economic affairs were administered by the &quot;divan&quot;, and the Samanid bureaucracy used Arabic in its diplomatic discourses. The economy was managed by the &quot;mustawfi&quot;, diplomatic correspondence and important state papers by the &quot;diwanal-rasa&#x27;il&quot;, and the royal guard and military affairs by the &quot;sahib al-shurta&quot;. The main responsibility of both governors and local rulers was to collect taxes and support the Samanid ruler with troops if needed. The most important province in the Samanid Empire was Khorasan, which was initially given to a relative of the Samanid ruler or a local Iranian prince (such as the Muhtajids), but was later given to one of his most trusted slaves. The governor of Khorasan was normally the &quot;sipah-salar&quot; (commander-in-chief).

Like in the Abbasid Caliphate, Turkic slaves could rise to high office in the Samanid state, which would sometimes give them enough power to nearly make the ruler their puppet.

=== Cultural and religious efforts ===
The Samanids revived Persian culture by patronizing Rudaki, Bal&#x27;ami and Daqiqi. The Samanids determinedly propagated Sunni Islam, and repressed Ismaili Shiism but were more tolerant of Twelver Shiism. Islamic architecture and Islamo-Persian culture was spread deep into the heartlands of Central Asia by the Samanids. Following the first complete translation of the Qur&#x27;an into Persian in the 9th century, populations under the Samanid empire began accepting Islam in significant numbers. The arabization of the Samanids was clearly minimal compared to the almost entirely arabized Tahirids. Despite Arabic literature and science flourishing in the Samanid Empire, its distance from Baghdad allowed the Samanids to be a crucial element in the renaissance of New Persian language and culture. This Persianate culture variant was the first to use a language besides Arabic in Islamic culture.

Although the Zoroastrian population had previously been suppressed by the Abbasid Caliphate, according to Al-Masudi, the Samanid empire still had fire-temples that were still being venerated by the present Zoroastrian population. Despite the fact that the Samanids professed Sunni Islam, however, they were much more tolerant towards its Zoroastrian population than the previous empires.

Through zealous missionary work as many as 30,000 tents of Turks came to profess Islam and later under the Ghaznavids more than 55,000 under the Hanafi school of thought. The mass conversion of the Turks to Islam eventually led to a growing influence of the Ghaznavids, who would later rule the region.

Under Nuh II, a Hanafi work, which was being used to contest Ismailism, was translated into Persian.

Agriculture and trading were the economic bases of the Samanid State. The Samanids heavily engaged in trade with Europe. Thousands of Samanid coins have been found in the Baltic and Scandinavia.

=== Literature ===
During the 9th and 10th centuries, there was a large amount of growth in literature, mostly in poetry. It was during the Samanid period that Persian literature appeared in Transoxiana and was formally recognized. The advancement of an Islamic New Persian literature thus started in Transoxiana and Khorasan instead of Fars, the homeland of the Persians. The best known poets of the Samanid period were Rudaki (d. 941), Daqiqi (d. 977) and Ferdowsi (d. 1020).

Although Persian was the most-favored language, Arabic continued to enjoy a high status and was still popular among the members of the Samanid family. For example, al-Tha&#x27;alibi wrote an Arabic anthology named &quot;Yatimat al-Dahr&quot; (&quot;The Unique Pearl&quot;). The fourth section of the anthology included a detailed account of the poets that lived under the Samanids. It also states that the poets of Khwarazm mostly wrote in Arabic.

The acknowledged founder of Persian classical poetry, and a man of great perception, was Rudaki, who was born in the village of Panjrudak, which is today part of the Panjakent District in Tajikistan. Rudaki was already becoming popular during his early years, due to his poems, his voice, and his great skill in using the chang (an Iranian instrument similar to the harp). He was shortly invited to the Samanid court, where he stayed almost the rest of his life. Fewer than 2,000 lines of his poetry have survived, but are enough to prove his great poetic skills—he perfected every basic verse form of medieval Persian poetry: &quot;mathnawi&quot;, &quot;qasida&quot;, &quot;ghazal&quot; and &quot;ruba&#x27;i&quot;.
&quot;Look at the cloud, how it cries like a grieving man
: Thunder moans like a lover with a broken heart.
: Now and then the sun peeks from behind the clouds
: Like a prisoner hiding from the guard.&quot; – Rudaki
Another prominent poet was Shahid Balkhi, born in the village of Jakhudanak near Balkh. Not much is known about his life, but he is mentioned as being one of the best poets in the court of Nasr II, and one of the best scholars of the age. He was also a student of Rudaki, and had close relations with him. He died in 936, a few years before Rudaki&#x27;s death. His death saddened Rudaki, who afterwards wrote an emotional elegy about him.

Daqiqi, who was a native of Tus, began his career at the court of the Muhtajid ruler Abu&#x27;l Muzaffar ibn Muhammad in Chaghaniyan, and was later invited to the Samanid court. Under the Samanids, a special interest arose in ancient Iranian legends and heroic traditions, thus inspiring Daqiqi to write the Shahnameh (&quot;The Book of Kings&quot;), a long epic poem based on the history of the Iranians. However, by his death in 977, he had only managed to complete a small part of it, which was about the conflict between Gushtasp and Arjasp.

However, the most prominent poet of that age was Ferdowsi, born in Tus in 940 to a &quot;dehqan&quot; family. It was during his youth that there was a period of growth under the Samanids. The rapid growth of interest in ancient Iranian history made him continue the work of Daqiqi, completing the Shahnameh in 994, only a few years before the fall of the Samanid Empire. He later completed a second version of the Shahnameh in 1010, which he presented to the Ghaznavid Sultan Mahmud. However, his work was not as appreciated by the Ghaznavids as it had been by the Samanids.

=== Population ===
Under the Samanid Empire, the Zarafshan valley, Kashka Darya and Usrushana were populated by Sogdians; Tukharistan by the Bactrians; Khwarezm by the Khwarazmians; the Ferghana valley by the Ferghanans; southern Khorasan by Khorasanians; and the Pamir mountains and environs by the Saka and other early Iranian peoples. All these groups were of Iranian ethnicity and spoke dialects of Middle Iranian and New Persian. In the words of Negmatov, &quot;they were the basis for the emergence and gradual consolidation of what became an Eastern Persian-Tajik ethnic identity.&quot;

=== Language ===
Ferghana, Samarkand, and Bukhara were starting to be linguistically Persianized in originally Khwarazmian and Sogdian areas during Samanid rule. The Persian language spread and led to the extinction of Eastern Iranian languages like Bactrian and Khwarezmian with only a tiny amount of Sogdian-descended Yaghnobi speakers remaining among the now Persian-speaking Tajik population of Central Asia. This was due to the fact that the Arab-Islamic army which invaded Central Asia at the time also included some Persians who later governed the region like the Samanids. Persian was rooted into Central Asia by the Samanids.

=== Intellectual life ===
In the 9th and 10th centuries, intellectual life in Transoxiana and Khorasan reached a high level. In the words of N.N. Negmatov, &quot;It was inevitable that the local Samanid dynasty, seeking support among its literate classes, should cultivate and promote local cultural traditions, literacy and literature.&quot;

The main Samanid towns – Bukhara, Samarkand, Balkh, Merv, Nishapur, Khujand, Bunjikath, Hulbuk, Termez and others, became the major cultural centres under the state. Scholars, poets, artists and other men of education from many Muslim countries assembled in the Samanid capital of Bukhara, where a rich soil was created for the prosper of creative thought, thus making it one of the most distinguished cultural centres of the Eastern world. An outstanding library known as &quot;Siwān al-Hikma&quot; (&quot;Storehouse of Wisdom&quot;) was put together in Bukhara, known for its various types of books.

=== Arts ===
Due to extensive excavations at Nishapur, Iran, in the mid-twentieth century, Samanid pottery is well-represented in Islamic art collections around the world. These ceramics are largely made from earthenware and feature either calligraphic inscriptions of Arabic proverbs, or colorful figural decorations. The Arabic proverbs often speak to the values of &quot;Adab&quot; culture—hospitality, generosity, and modesty.

== Legacy ==

In commending the Samanids, the epic Persian poet Ferdowsi says of them:
کجا آن بزرگان ساسانیان
ز بهرامیان تا به سامانیان
&quot;Where have all the great Sasanians gone?
From the Bahrāmids to the Samanids what has come upon?&quot;

A Bukharan historian writing in 943 stated that Ismail Samani: was indeed worthy and right for padishahship. He was an intelligent, just, compassionate person, one possessing reason and prescience...he conducted affairs with justice and good ethics. Whoever tyrannized people he would punish...In affairs of state he was always impartial.

The celebrated scholar Nizam al-Mulk, in his famous work &quot;Siyasatnama&quot;, stated that Ismail Samani: was extremely just, and his good qualities were many. He had pure faith in God (to Him be power and glory) and he was generous to the poor – to name only one of his notable virtues.

== Tajiks and Samanids ==
Tajik nationalism has been the domain of the government elite. The Tajik regime has been rewriting history and in doing so, redefining its political system. And the &quot;drive for &#x27;authenticity&quot; let to rewriting history to foreground the modern Tajiks connection of the 9th-century Samanids. And to portray them as Tajiks for, historical heritage competition with Uzbekistan. Tajik nationalist historians have sought to portray, the Samanid empire as the original &quot;Tajik&quot; state with Ismail Samani as its founder. It should be conceded that this claim is occasionally exaggerated and distorted. The Samanids would not have approved of their classification as Tajiks separate from the larger Persian-speaking community.

&quot;Owen Marshall, Counselor at Law&quot; had two crossovers with &quot;Marcus Welby, M.D.,&quot; another series in whose creation and production David Victor was directly involved. In the first, &quot;Men Who Care,&quot; Welby (Robert Young) persuades Marshall to defend a man who is accused of killing his daughter&#x27;s boyfriend, the daughter being one of Welby&#x27;s patients. In the second, &quot;I&#x27;ve Promised You a Father,&quot; Marshall defends Welby&#x27;s colleague Dr. Steven Kiley (James Brolin) in a paternity suit filed by a young nurse, who claims that Kiley is the father of her child.

<text>Royal Troon Golf Club is a links golf course in Scotland, located in Troon, South Ayrshire. The club was established in 1878, and originally only consisted of five holes whereas today, it has increased to a total of 45 holes. Its Old Course is one of the host courses for The Open Championship, one of the major championships on the PGA Tour and European Tour. The Club most recently hosted in 2024 for the tenth time. It also hosted the Women&#x27;s British Open in 2020.

On 1 July 2016, Royal Troon members voted overwhelmingly to admit women into the club as members, avoiding a potential controversy that could have led to the club being removed from the Open Championship rota.

==History==
===Establishment===
The club, which now has a total of 45 holes, was founded in 1878, initially with five holes. It lies adjacent to the Firth of Clyde. George Strath was appointed in 1881 as the club&#x27;s first golf professional, and together with 1882 Open champion Willie Fernie, designed the original course, expanding it to 18 holes by 1888. The two were assisted by Charlie Hunter, greenskeeper of the neighbouring Prestwick Golf Club, in Troon&#x27;s formative years.

When Strath left the club&#x27;s employ in 1887, Fernie became head professional, and served in that role until his death in 1924. He laid out the club&#x27;s Relief course, on the site of what would become Troon&#x27;s New course, designed by Alister MacKenzie; Shortly after opening the New course was renamed in honour of the 6th Duke of Portland, an essential early Troon Golf Club patron and facilitator, who was one of the region&#x27;s largest landowners.

The club&#x27;s property lies between the Firth of Clyde on the west, a caravan park on the south (slightly further south lies Prestwick Golf Club), the railway line and main road on the east, and the town of Troon on the north. Glasgow Prestwick Airport is located slightly to the south and east of the club, and low-flying aircraft are nearest its southern section.

===Open Championship===

Its &quot;Old Course&quot; is one of the host courses for The Open Championship, one of the major championships on the PGA Tour and European Tour. The club has hosted 11 Open Championships -- 1923, 1950, 1962, 1973, 1982, 1989, 1997, 2004, 2016, 2020 (women&#x27;s, The R&amp;A did not offer a male equivalent), and 2024.

Just prior to Royal Troon hosting its first Open Championship in 1923, the Old Course was redesigned, lengthened, and strengthened by James Braid, a five-time Open champion, one of the era&#x27;s top architects, and a member of the World Golf Hall of Fame. Other than having new back tees on several holes, six completely re-sited greens, much narrower fairways, (when not changed entirely for the re-positioned greens), and vastly different bunkering, the current Old Course is essentially very similar to Braid&#x27;s finished work.

Past Open champions at Royal Troon include Justin Leonard, Mark Calcavecchia, Tom Watson, Tom Weiskopf, Arnold Palmer, Bobby Locke, and Arthur Havers. Six consecutive Opens at Troon were won by Americans, from 1962 through 2004, ended by Henrik Stenson of Sweden in 2016.

German golfer Sophia Popov&#x27;s status as Champion Golfer of the Year in the 2020 Women&#x27;s British Open, where there was only a tournament for women that year, was regarded as one of the greatest upsets in major championship golf.

===Royal designation===

Troon was granted its &quot;Royal&quot; designation in 1978, during its centenary. Its clubhouse, designed by Henry Edward Clifford and built in 1886, is richly decorated with historical golf artifacts. James Montgomerie, father of Colin Montgomerie, served as Secretary in the 1980s.

Its &quot;Old Course&quot; is one of the host courses for The Open Championship, one of the major championships on the PGA Tour and European Tour. The club has hosted 11 Open Championships, ten for men (most recently in 2024), and the 2020 Open for women (no men&#x27;s equivalent that year).

===Recent history===

On 1 July 2016, Royal Troon members voted overwhelmingly to admit women into the club as members, avoiding a potential controversy that could have overshadowed the 2016 Open Championship and led to the club being removed from the Open rota.

==Noteworthy characteristics==
The Old Course begins alongside the sea, running southwards in a line for the first six holes. This opening section offers full visibility and plenty of space, but does still require accuracy to avoid deep bunkers. Many good rounds have been fashioned through low scores here, often aided by prevailing downwind conditions. Beginning with the seventh, the Old Course turns further inland, while simultaneously changing direction, on each of its next six holes, among hillier dunes and thicker vegetation, including ulex (commonly known as gorse, furze, or whin), to severely punish offline shots. This sector, with two blind tee shots on the tenth and 11th, marks a sharp rise in difficulty from the opening holes. With the 13th hole, the player turns northwards for a long, very stern finish, running parallel to the opening stretch. This comprises three long par 4s, two tough par 3s, and a challenging par 5 (the 16th) with its fairway bisected at the halfway point by a ditch, which can only very rarely be carried from the tee. The player very often has to face a strong prevailing wind.

Royal Troon is home to the shortest hole in Open Championship golf. Described by &quot;Golf Monthly&quot; as one of the most famous holes in the world, the par-3 8th hole (&quot;Postage Stamp&quot;) measures a scant , but its diminutive green measures a mere . Two holes earlier, the par-5 6th (&quot;Turnberry&quot;) extends to a lengthy and until the championship at Royal Liverpool in 2023 was the longest hole in Open history.

The 11th hole (&quot;The Railway&quot;) is one of the most difficult holes in major championship golf. Now a long par-4, a blind tee shot has a long carry over gorse with out of bounds all along the railway on the right. The lengthy approach shot is to a small green that falls away, with nearby out of bounds.

==The Portland and Craigend Courses==
The Old Course is the championship layout at Royal Troon. Its second course, the Portland, also an 18-hole layout from 1895, but significantly shorter than the Old Course, was redesigned in 1921 by golf course architect Dr. Alister MacKenzie, a member of the World Golf Hall of Fame. The Portland is also of very high standard. It is located slightly further inland and further north than the Old Course, with no holes bordering the Firth of Clyde; it has its own clubhouse. The Craigend Course is a nine-hole par-3 course.

The club is private; guests are allowed at certain times, under advance booking, with a handicap certificate establishing proficiency. The Old Course has four tees – &quot;Ladies&quot;, &quot;Short&quot;, &quot;Medal&quot; and &quot;Championship&quot;.

<text>The Phantom Stranger is a superhero appearing in American comic books published by DC Comics, of unspecified paranormal origins, who battles mysterious and occult forces, sometimes under their Vertigo imprint. The character first appeared in an eponymous comics anthology published in August/September 1952.

The Phantom Stranger made his first live-action appearance in the 2019 DC Universe television series &quot;Swamp Thing&quot;, portrayed by Macon Blair. Additionally, Kevin Conroy, D. B. Woodside, and Peter Serafinowicz have voiced the character in animation.

==Publication history==
===Volume 1===
The Phantom Stranger first appeared in an eponymous six-issue comics anthology published in 1952 and was created by John Broome and Carmine Infantino.

===Volume 2===
After an appearance in &quot;Showcase&quot; #80 (February 1969), he received another series beginning May–June 1969 that lasted until February–March 1976. The &quot;Showcase&quot; appearance and the first three issues of &quot;Phantom Stranger&quot; consisted of reprints from both the 1950s title and the &quot;Dr. 13: Ghost-Breaker&quot; feature from the last nine issues of &quot;Star Spangled Comics&quot; at the same time, with new, brief framing sequences. These had Dr. Thirteen, certain that the Phantom Stranger was an impostor, determined to expose him.

Beginning with issue #4 (November-December 1969), the series began featuring all-new material, with stories produced by Robert Kanigher, Len Wein, Jim Aparo, Neal Adams, Tony DeZuniga and others. In these stories, while the Stranger&#x27;s past remained a mystery, the writers added a semi-regular cast of characters for him. A demonic sorceress named Tala would become his archenemy; an alchemist/sorcerer named Tannarak was first an enemy and would later assist him against the Dark Circle; and a blind psychic named Cassandra Craft would assist him. The stories hinted at a romantic attraction between the Stranger and Craft, but he eventually left her, deciding she could not be part of his life, convincing her he had been killed in their final battle against the Dark Circle. She eventually learned differently and turned up occasionally. Doctor Thirteen, dropped along with the reprints, was given a back-up series here as of #12 (March-April 1971) which morphed into &quot;The Spawn of Frankenstein&quot; in #23 (January-February 1973).

The second volume originally ended with the forty-first issue in November 1975, cover dated March 1976. In January 2010, a forty-second issue was added to the second series during the &quot;Blackest Night&quot; event, effectively a one-shot.

===Saga of the Swamp Thing===
A backup series in &quot;Saga of the Swamp Thing&quot; #1-13 featured The Phantom Stranger. Most of those short stories were written by Mike W. Barr; one was written by Paul Levitz. These were mostly morality tales in the style of The Phantom Stranger vol. 2, without connections to the character&#x27;s Bronze Age continuity with Batman or the Justice League. One two-part story explicitly connected with the continuity of vol. 2, continuing the story of Tannarak. 

After the backup series ended with #13, the Stranger appeared in the main story of Saga of the Swamp Thing #14. After Saga of the Swamp Thing became Swamp Thing volume 2 written by Alan Moore, the Stranger became an occasional recurring character, as Swamp Thing became more involved with the afterlife and the mystical world.

===Volume 3===
The Stranger also starred in a miniseries in 1987. This series portrayed him as an agent of the Lords of Order. They temporarily stripped the Stranger of his powers, due to his desire to continue a battle against the Lords of Chaos. This went against the wishes of the Lords of Order, who had believed a victory by darkness over light was necessary and preordained. This series featured Eclipso as an agent of Chaos.

===Action Comics Weekly===

During the period 1988-89 when Action Comics became the anthology Action Comics Weekly, one rotating strip featured The Phantom Stranger. It explicitly continued the continuity of The Phantom Stranger Volume 2.

The story of Volume 2 and the Action Comics Weekly strip was resolved in Neil Gaiman&#x27;s proposed story concluding the whole of Action Comics Weekly. This was published years later as the non-canonical in &quot;Green Lantern/Superman: Legend of the Green Flame.&quot; In this story, the Stranger claims that he belongs to no group, including the servants of the Lords of Order. The Lords of Order threaten to strip him of his powers, and he leaves, claiming that he shall continue to wander.

===Volume 4===
The Phantom Stranger received a new ongoing series in September 2012 written by Dan DiDio and drawn by Brent Anderson. This series was retitled as &quot;Trinity of Sin: The Phantom Stranger&quot; as of issue #9 (Aug. 2013) and cancelled as of #22 (Oct. 2014).

===Justice League membership status===
The Phantom Stranger is better known for his role as a supernatural assistant to other heroes, such as the Justice League. His status as either a full, reserve, or honorary member of the League is debatable. After a vote of the majority of the team in &quot;Justice League of America&quot; #103, they offered him membership, with Superman declaring the Stranger &quot;a member&quot; without qualification, though he left before accepting. This issue was part of an unofficial metafictional crossover with Marvel Comics, spanning titles from both of the major comics companies. Beginning in Marvel&#x27;s &quot;Amazing Adventures&quot; #16 (by Steve Englehart with art by Bob Brown and Frank McLaughlin), the story continued in DC&#x27;s &quot;Justice League of America&quot; #103 (by Len Wein, Dick Dillin and Dick Giordano), and is concluded in &quot;Thor&quot; #207 (by Gerry Conway and penciler John Buscema). Each comic featured writers Steve Englehart, Gerry Conway, and Len Wein, as well as Wein&#x27;s first wife Glynis, interacting with Marvel or DC characters at the Rutland Halloween Parade in Rutland, Vermont. The Phantom Stranger has at least twice asserted his membership status when other Leaguers challenged his input, during the vote on the League&#x27;s re-admission of Wonder Woman and during the crossover with &quot;The Avengers&quot;. In contrast, many in-story accounts of League membership fail to include the Stranger; when Zatanna was admitted as a member, Superman and Hawkman clarified that the 12-member limit in the League&#x27;s charter had been rewritten previously to admit Hawkgirl as the 13th. Writer Len Wein commented on the Phantom Stranger&#x27;s relationship with the JLA in a 2012 interview stating that the character &quot;only &quot;sort of&quot; joined. He was offered membership but vanished, as per usual, without actually accepting the offer. Over the years, other writers have just assumed [he] was a member, but in my world, he never really said yes&quot;.

==Fictional character biography==
===Origin===
Unusually for a comic book character of such longevity, nothing in the way of personal data about the Phantom Stranger—his real name, his true nature, or his origins—has ever been revealed. In 1987, DC produced a special issue of &quot;Secret Origins&quot; (vol. 2, #10) that postulated four possible origins:
#In a variation of the Wandering Jew story, he was a man named Isaac whose family were killed during the Massacre of the Innocents. Afterward, he spends the next 30 years seeking revenge against Jesus Christ, and is cursed to wander the world until the Second Coming. In the present day, God offers to lift the Stranger&#x27;s curse, but he refuses.
#The Stranger was a man in Biblical times who was spared God&#x27;s wrath by an angel. Questioning God&#x27;s actions, he commits suicide. An angel forbids his spirit from entering the afterlife, resurrects him with amnesia, and condemns him to wander the world and erase evil from others&#x27; souls.
#The Phantom Stranger is a being caught in a time loop. Near the end of the universe, he approaches several scientists who are trying to transfer energy from the Big Bang to extend the universe&#x27;s lifespan and stops one of the scientists, who is an avatar of Anti-Life and attempting to destroy the universe. The story concludes with the Phantom Stranger passing a portion of himself to a scientist, who becomes his successor.
#The Phantom Stranger was a fallen angel who sided with neither Heaven nor Hell during Lucifer&#x27;s rebellion and thus was condemned to walk the Earth. In the comic book miniseries &quot;The Trenchcoat Brigade&quot;, John Constantine sees that the fourth origin story is essentially correct. &quot;Vertigo Visions: Phantom Stranger&quot; #1 by Alisa Kwitney and Guy Davis builds upon Alan Moore&#x27;s fallen angel story from &quot;Secret Origins&quot; and adds the story of a woman called Naamah, who was condemned to Hell for loving an angel. This angel is implied to have become the Phantom Stranger.

Another possible origin was hinted at in &quot;The Kingdom&quot; (the sequel to &quot;Kingdom Come&quot;) in which it was implied that Jonathan Kent, the future son of Superman and Wonder Woman, might grow up to be the Phantom Stranger. This also tied some of his abilities into the Hypertime concept, giving him the innate ability to enter alternate timelines and to exist in the spaces between them. The story ultimately revealed this to be a red herring. The character in question had been deliberately drawn in shadows to suggest that he was the Stranger, but when Wonder Woman finally saw his face, she said that she now realized he was not the Stranger they knew.

His appearances in titles featuring Doctor Fate state that the Stranger was a servant of the Lords of Order during the Ninth Age of Magic (at least). This may be a later development unrelated to his actual origin.

The one-shot &quot;Vertigo Visions: The Phantom Stranger&quot; (1993) written by Alisa Kwitney suggests another origin for the Stranger, drawing on Jewish Talmudic and Kabbalistic stories: that he was an angel who sinned by impregnating the demon Naamah ; their child was the demon Asmodeus. The story does appear to be in continuity with Vertigo&#x27;s &quot;Sandman&quot; series, but the continuity status of the Vertigo line relative to the mainline DC Comics Universe was unclear and inconsistent in this era.

In &quot;Phantom Stranger&quot; (vol. 4) #0 (2012), the Phantom Stranger is Judas Iscariot. He is judged by the Circle of Eternity, who are implied to be proxies for a higher power. The Stranger is condemned to walk the Earth forever as an agent of God. He wears a necklace made of the 30 pieces of silver which he took as payment for betraying Jesus. When the Stranger facilitates the transformation of Jim Corrigan into the Spectre, one of the coins falls from the necklace and crumbles, bringing him one step closer to redemption.

===Depictions by different writers===

In his earliest appearances, the Phantom Stranger would prove supernatural events to be hoaxes perpetrated by criminals. He would directly confront the villains, and displayed no supernatural abilities apart perhaps from his uncanny ability to appear where and when he is needed and to disappear just as mysteriously, with nobody seeing him coming or going. In later stories, the supernatural events were real and the Phantom Stranger was given unspecified supernatural powers of his own to defeat them. For example, he was able to control a smoke-based sedative with a gesture, claiming that smoke itself is his ally.

In his second comic book series, the Phantom Stranger became a truly supernatural hero.

The Phantom Stranger played a major part in Neil Gaiman&#x27;s &quot;The Books of Magic&quot;, taking protagonist Tim Hunter through time to show him the history and nature of magic. He has assisted the Justice League on numerous occasions, even being formally elected to the group in &quot;Justice League of America&quot; #103, although he did not acknowledge his membership until &quot;Justice League of America&quot; #143. The Stranger also had his own limited series, where, lacking much of his power, he tries to foil Eclipso&#x27;s plan to cause a nuclear war.

During Kevin Smith&#x27;s relaunch of &quot;Green Arrow&quot;, he prevented Hal Jordan from uniting the resurrected body of Oliver Queen with his soul in Heaven. This earned him Jordan&#x27;s wrath; indeed, the Spectre threatened to judge the Stranger to see whether God had &quot;punished&quot; him properly by refusing him access to Heaven itself. Nonetheless, the Phantom Stranger assisted Jordan during his tenure as the Spectre on numerous occasions as well, most notably in a short stint babysitting his niece Helen.

In 2005&#x27;s &quot;Day of Vengeance&quot;, the Phantom Stranger had been turned into a mouse by the Spectre. Upon the Spectre&#x27;s confrontation and battle with the Stranger, the Stranger states: &quot;You can&#x27;t kill me. I doubt that the universe would allow it&quot;. He was still able to advise Detective Chimp, however, who sheltered him in his hat while he regained his powers. He changed back using recovered energies in &quot;Day of Vengeance&quot; #6 and aided the Shadowpact, allowing them to see the battle between the Spectre and Shazam. The series makes a point that the supernatural community generally regards the Phantom Stranger as invincible. The first reaction of some characters to the Spectre&#x27;s assault on magic is simply to presume that the Stranger will take care of it. Other stories have shown the Stranger to be nearly as powerful as the Spectre.

In &quot;Day of Vengeance: Infinite Crisis Special&quot; #1, the Phantom Stranger works with Nabu, Doctor Occult, Zatanna, the Shadowpact, and other mystics to re-form the Rock of Eternity and help defeat the maddened Spectre.

The Phantom Stranger&#x27;s relationships with the other mystic heroes are usually tense. The Stranger has no qualms gathering various forces to combat evil, often invading those people&#x27;s personal lives. However, he does not usually extend them that same courtesy. The Phantom Stranger has resisted such people as Doctor Fate (notably Hector Hall) in this, although Doctor Fate is, in almost any incarnation, an ally of the Stranger. Despite this, he does get along well with Zatanna; in &quot;Justice League of America&quot; #6, he appeared by her side to help remove the influence of Faust on the Red Tornado, and in the &quot;Justice&quot; series he seems to have a fatherly affection for her, calling her &quot;my dear&quot;.

Since he is ultimately an unpredictable force, others often meet the Phantom Stranger&#x27;s appearance with distrust. Nonetheless, most heroes will follow him, seeing not only his immense power, but also knowing that the Stranger is, in the end, a force for good. He has generally shown to side with humanity first in many supernatural-based problems, such as when he aided Superman in a confrontation with the magician Arion, who attempted to force Superman to retire in the belief that Superman and other alien heroes would hold back the &#x27;darkness&#x27; that would make civilization—Arion describing human history as existing in a cycle that would allow humanity to develop to a certain point before they collapsed and had to start again—for so long that it would destroy humanity when it came. Although the Stranger acknowledged that the future Arion had foreseen, where Earth was completely destroyed by Khyber due to Superman delaying him for so long that he only struck at his peak, was possible, he also told Superman to keep fighting to find another way as the cost in souls and experience if Arion succeeded would be too great. A notable exception to the heroes who will work with the Stranger is Madame Xanadu, who has refused to join the Stranger on a few occasions, although she is a member of his Sentinels of Magic. Eventually, it was revealed that Madame Xanadu&#x27;s hatred for the Phantom Stranger stems from his involvement in the events costing young Nimue her powers and heritage, and turning the young fey into the immortal yet powerless clairvoyant.

The Stranger also holds a unique relationship with the Spectre, as the two forces often come into conflict. He was responsible for gathering a group of mystic heroes to combat the Spectre, when its human host Jim Corrigan seemingly lost control of the Spectre. It was during this time that they destroyed the country of Vlatava. The Phantom Stranger participated in Jim Corrigan&#x27;s funeral, when Corrigan&#x27;s soul finally earned its rest and left the Spectre. The Stranger subsequently became one of the forces that stood against the Spectre when it went on a rampage without its human host, until the soul of Hal Jordan bonded with it. The Stranger occasionally took on an advisory role for this new Spectre. In &quot;Infinite Crisis&quot; #6, aware that the Spectre now has yet another new host, the Phantom Stranger gathered a large group of magic wielders in an unsuccessful attempt to solicit the Spectre&#x27;s assistance in the Crisis.

In the &quot;Madame Xanadu&quot; series, the first encounter between the then-young and innocent Nimue, as Xanadu was known in the Arthurian Age, and the Phantom Stranger himself is told. There, Nimue acknowledges his unearthly nature, describing him as &quot;Ageless and yet so...uneasy&quot;, and claiming, &quot;You&#x27;re not human! Nor are you of the Ancient Folk! Nor fey creature. Nor...nor demon...&quot; Before Nimue is able to grasp his nature, the Stranger goes away, claiming to be &quot;compelled to counsel and yet forbidden to interfere in the course of history&quot;.

The Phantom Stranger serves as the narrator of &quot;Shadowpact&quot;. He is shown to be aware of the mystical happenings, not only on Earth, but across several dimensions; once again he is shown to be unable to interfere, no matter how dire the danger that he is aware of may be.

=== &quot;Blackest Night&quot; ===
In &quot;Blackest Night&quot; #2, Black Hand refers to the Phantom Stranger as neither dead nor alive, meaning he cannot be killed, resurrected, or turned into a Black Lantern. The Stranger watches as a black power ring attaches itself to Crispus Allen&#x27;s body, turning him into a Black Lantern, and sealing the Spectre within him. In the tie-in one-shot revival of &quot;Phantom Stranger&quot; #42, the Stranger, with the help of Blue Devil, attempts to fight the Black Lantern Spectre, but fails. The two then travel to Nanda Parbat, where the Stranger helps Deadman remove the black ring from his body. The Stranger has the body brought into Nanda Parbat and placed under guard, stating that it is of &quot;singular importance&quot;.

===&quot;The New 52&quot;===
In &quot;DC Comics - The New 52 FCBD Special Edition&quot; #1 as part of &quot;The New 52&quot; (a reboot of the DC Comics universe), the Phantom Stranger is implied to be Judas Iscariot and part of the Trinity of Sin with Pandora and the Question. While not named explicitly, the necklace he wears is presumed to be made from the 30 pieces of silver that he received for his betrayal of Jesus Christ. His hair and eyes become totally white from the experience.

&quot;Phantom Stranger&quot; (vol. 4) #0 confirmed that Phantom Stranger was once Judas Iscariot, the man who betrayed Jesus. In this origin tale he is about to hang himself when his suicide attempt is stopped by a mysterious group of individuals. He is subsequently judged along with Pandora and another man who was turned into the Question. Thousands of years later, he is guided to help desperate former detective Jim Corrigan find his kidnapped girlfriend. He leads him to the abandoned warehouse where she has been kept, but this turns out to be a trap. Corrigan is killed by the kidnappers, then transforms into the Spectre and accuses the Stranger of betraying him. As the Spectre is about to attack the Stranger, a mysterious Voice sends him off to inflict his wrath on the more deserving. As payment for what occurred with Corrigan, one coin drops off the necklace he was cursed with (made of the 30 pieces of silver he betrayed Jesus for) and the Stranger realizes he has more encounters ahead of him before he is forgiven.

Pandora meets the Phantom Stranger and tells him she needs his help to find the person who can open her box. He refuses, reminding her of the last time the box was opened, when the sins of the world were unleashed. To this, she responds that she only wants to save everyone from what she unleashed. John Constantine tries to con the Phantom Stranger to join the Justice League Dark by promising to return one of the coins bound to him through his punishment. The Phantom Stranger rejects the offer, but Constantine feels he will eventually come around and be on the Justice League Dark&#x27;s side. The Question manipulates Doctor Thirteen to impale the Phantom Stranger with the Spear of Destiny. The Phantom Stranger is left on the door to the House of Mystery, and the Justice League Dark attempt to revive him, summoning the Nightmare Nurse. Once they do revive him, the Phantom Stranger states that they are all in his debt and asks the Justice League Dark (specifically Zatanna) to help him enter Hell to save his family. Zauriel warns the Phantom Stranger that he is never allowed to enter Heaven again, having gone to Hell to try to save his family. Zauriel also states to the Phantom Stranger that if he tries, he will be erased from time and history forever.

==Powers and abilities==
The natures of these are as mysterious as the Stranger himself, who seems to be effectively immortal, never aging. The Phantom Stranger has demonstrated enormous powers and capabilities, the exact origin of which is undetermined. He can travel enormous distances in a short period of time, such as to the JLA Watchtower and Apokolips, as well as to mystical dimensions, such as Heaven, Hell and the realm occupied by the Quintessence, though he is forbidden from entering Heaven directly. He can fire energy bolts of great force, travel through time, dispel magic, reveal illusions, warp reality on a universal scale, and survive in space without any type of life support system; on one occasion, he created a mystical shield that protected Superman from any spells cast against him directly in preparation for Superman&#x27;s upcoming confrontation with Arion. The limits of his power have not been defined. In many cases, despite his capabilities, he claims he is not allowed to end a crisis directly, only to guide others to take the necessary actions.

The Phantom Stranger&#x27;s greatest and most well-known power is his omniscience. This allows him to provide helpful advice and assistance to others. He claims that &quot;nothing remains hidden to [him]&quot;.
