<text>A coffee cabinet is an ice cream-based milkshake found almost exclusively in Rhode Island consisting of coffee ice cream, coffee syrup, and milk. The ingredients are mixed in a drink blender or milkshake blender.

Among the famous Rhode Island creameries which serve them are Delekta Pharmacy in Warren, and the Original Vanilla Bean in South Kingstown. Newport Creamery, a chain of family restaurants found almost exclusively in Rhode Island, serve a variation of cabinets made with ice milk under the brand name &quot;Awful Awful&quot;. A cabinet is often referred to elsewhere in New England as a frappe.

The earliest known reference to the Coffee Cabinet was published in &quot;The Spatula&quot; in 1903:A drink that has become the most popular is &quot;Coffee Cabinet,&quot; consisting of coffee syrup, egg, plain cream, ice cream, and shaved ice, thoroughly shaken. The coarse stream of soda is drawn and the drink is strained. This has often been called a meal in itself.

As with &quot;downcity&quot;, the etymology of this term is unknown. One common, but unsubstantiated, explanation is that the soda jerk or pharmacist kept the coffee syrup in one of the polished wooden cabinets behind the counter. It has also been theorized by some that the name was a variation on a drink known as the &quot;Royal Cabinet&quot;, an egg cream first popularized in Chicago.

<text>Edward Onslow Ford (27 July 1852 – 23 December 1901) was an English sculptor. Much of Ford&#x27;s early success came with portrait heads or busts. These were considered extremely refined, showing his subjects at their best and led to him receiving a number of commissions for public monuments and statues, both in Britain and overseas. Ford also produced a number of bronze statuettes of free-standing figures loosely drawn from mythology or of allegorical subjects. These &#x27;ideal&#x27; figures became characteristic of the New Sculpture movement that developed in Britain from about 1880 and of which Ford was a leading exponent.

==Biography==
===Early life===
Ford was born at Islington in north London, the son of businessman Edward Ford and Martha Lydia Gardner. His family moved to Blackheath while he was still a child. After he had spent some time at Blackheath Proprietary School, he went to Antwerp to study painting at Royal Academy of Fine Arts there during 1870 and 1871. Ford then studied under Michael Wagmüller in Munich until 1874, during which time he shared a studio with the sculptor Edwin Roscoe Mullins. Before leaving Munich, Ford married a fellow student Anne Gwendoline, the third daughter of Baron Frans von Kreusser, in 1873.

===Portrait work===

On returning to England around 1874, Ford settled at Blackheath and established a studio concentrating on portrait sculptures. In 1875, he submitted a portrait bust he had sculpted of his wife to the Royal Academy Summer Exhibition in London. From 1875 to 1884 Ford exhibited portrait sculptures each year at the Academy.

Much of Ford&#x27;s early success came in portraiture. His portrait busts are extremely refined and show his subjects at their best. He sculpted many portrait busts which are noted for their tasteful conception, delicate modelling, and verisimilitude. The best, perhaps, are the heads of John Everett Millais, Thomas Huxley, Herbert Spencer, Sir WQ Orchardson, Matthew Ridley Corbet, the duke of Norfolk, Briton Rivière, Sir Lawrence Alma-Tadema, Sir Walter Armstrong, Sir Hubert von Herkomer, Arthur Hacker (1894), and M. Dagnan-Bouveret. Those in bronze of his fellow-artist Arthur Hacker (1894) and of the politician Arthur Balfour are striking likenesses, as is the marble statue of Sir Frederick Bramwell for the Royal Institution.

In 1881 Ford moved his studio operation to Sydney Mews, among a block of studios off the Fulham Road. Alfred Gilbert had a neighbouring studio and together they worked on a number of experimental techniques, notably in lost wax casting which Ford would use throughout his career.

===Exhibition pieces===
In 1885 Ford exhibited a full-size bronze male nude, &quot;Linus&quot; at the Royal Academy and the following year exhibited &quot;Folly&quot; there, the first in an extended series of bronze statuettes of adolescent girls in poses loosely derived from mythology or allegorical themes. &quot;Folly&quot; was acquired by the Trusties of the Chantrey Fund for the Tate in 1886 and Ford&#x27;s subsequent variations on the subject, including &quot;Peace&quot; (1887), &quot;The Singer&quot; (1889), &quot;Applause&quot; (1893) and &quot;Echo&quot; (1895) were also widely praised. These works, termed &#x27;ideal figures&#x27;, came to be regarded by art critics as among the defining works of the New Sculpture movement that had developed in Britain from about 1880 onwards as a reaction to the blandness of much other Victorian sculpture.

The modest scale of these works by Ford indicate they were not intended for grand country houses but rather for smaller domestic settings and, like other New Sculpture artists, Ford supported the commercial production of bronze statuettes and smaller copies of his work for the home market with &quot;Peace&quot; and other works by him becoming popular reproductions. Another characteristic of New Sculpture which Ford embraced was the use of polychromatic materials. For example, &quot;Applause&quot; has coloured resins with semi-precious stones and elements in silver, while &quot;The Singer&quot; uses copper and brass strips.

&quot;The Singer&quot; and &quot;&#x27;Applause&quot; were both originally on lotus-shaped pedestals, share the use of Egyptian motifs and iconography and are related by subject matter. Although created four years apart, Ford clearly considered the two works a pair and they each appear in several portraits of him, indicating both their significance to him personally and their place as his most widely exhibited works. The two were only exhibited together once, at the Paris International Exhibition of 1900, during Ford&#x27;s lifetime but since 2008 both have been in the Tate collection in London.

===Public monuments===
Alongside his portrait work, Ford received his first public commission in 1881 for the statue of
Rowland Hill now at King Edward Street in London. Other notable commissions included &quot;Irving as Hamlet&quot; (1883) depicting Henry Irving, found in the Guildhall Art Gallery and the Shelley Memorial in University College, Oxford (1892). The standing statue of William Ewart Gladstone, 1894, for the City Liberal Club, London, is regarded as one of Ford&#x27;s best portrait works.

A number of Ford&#x27;s monumental commissions celebrate the British Empire, either by promoting imperial values or as memorials to military figures. A memorial statue by Ford from 1890, depicting General Gordon on a camel, stands at Brompton Barracks, Chatham, the home of the Royal School of Military Engineering. A second cast of the statue was installed in Khartoum from 1904 until 1958 when, shortly after Sudan achieved its independence, the statue was removed and relocated to Gordon&#x27;s School at Woking in Surrey during 1959. Ford oversaw the production of small copies in bronze of the complete Gordon figure and of the camel alone for the domestic retail market. The full-size statue was exhibited in the Egyptian Hall of The Crystal Palace in south London for a time and a statuette of the camel was shown at the Arts and Crafts Exhibition Society in 1889. Ford&#x27;s 1895 equestrian statue of the army officer Lord Strathnairn, originally erected at Knightsbridge, was cast in gun-metal presented by the Indian government. He created a silver equestrian statuette, commissioned by the family, of Frederick Roberts, who was killed in action at the Battle of Colenso in the Second Boer War.

Ford received several commissions for monuments in India. These included the 1898 statue of the Maharaja of Mysore, Chamarajendra Wadiyar X in full state regalia, installed in the Lal Bagh botanical garden in Bangalore, the 1899 seated statue of Maharaja Lakshmeshwar Singh Bahadur of Darbhanga in Kolkata and two full-size statues representing &quot;Dance&quot; and &quot;Music&quot; which were commissioned by the Maharajah of Durbhanga, Lachmeswar Singh Bahadur.

Completed sometime during 1890, Ford&#x27;s memorial to Percy Bysshe Shelley was commissioned by Lady Shelley, the widow of the poets&#x27; son, Sir Percy Shelley, 3rd Baronet, for the Protestant Cemetery in Rome but was deemed too large for the intended location and eventually installed at University College, Oxford. With the intended cemetery location in mind, Ford designed the monument with a tall and elaborate base in bronze and coloured marble featuring a mourning figure and winged lions supporting a marble figure of the drowned Shelley. The work was shown at the Royal Academy in 1891, to considerable praise, before being installed at Oxford.

For Queen Victoria&#x27;s Diamond Jubilee in 1897, Ford was commissioned to create a monumental statue of the Queen for Manchester. The work was not completed until after her death and received poor reviews when exhibited, indoors, at the Royal Academy in May 1901 but was greatly praised when unveiled in a more appropriate external setting in Manchester later the same year. Victoria sat for Ford a number of times for the Manchester monument. At her request, those studies became the basis of several portrait busts of the queen by Ford, in both marble and bronze, which she used as gifts. Ford delivered the last of these early in January 1901, weeks before she died. He subsequently produced a number of small-scale copies, in bronze, of the work which is considered a sensitive and sympathetic study of the elderly Victoria and the last sculptured likeness of her for which she sat.

Ford was a founding member of the Art Workers Guild in 1884 and became president of the Guild in 1885. He was elected an Associate Member of the Royal Academy in 1888 and became a full Academician in 1895.
===Death and legacy===
Around 1900, following an extended period of over-work and stress from financial worries, Ford developed heart disease but continued working at pace and died suddenly at his home in St John&#x27;s Wood on 23 December 1901. Ford&#x27;s obituary in &quot;The Sketch&quot;, dated 1 January 1902, states that he died of pneumonia exacerbated by a weak heart. However the suddenness of his death, and his debt issues, led to some speculation about suicide. He was survived by his mother, his wife, four sons, and a daughter. Two of his sons had worked with Ford in his studio and they completed some of his unfinished works, most notably the marble sculpture, &quot;Snowdrift&quot;. His salt cellar, in silver, ivory, marble and lapis lazuli, of &quot;St George and the Dragon&quot; was completed by John Seymour Lucas.

A monument was erected to Ford&#x27;s memory which was designed by the architect J W Simpson and sculpted by Ford&#x27;s former studio assistant Andrea Carlo Lucchesi in St John&#x27;s Wood, near his home. The monument comprises a stone pillar with a bronze seated figure in mourning at the front, based on Ford&#x27;s statue &quot;The Muse of Poetry&quot;, and a wreathed bust of Ford at rear.

The Henry Moore Foundation in Leeds holds an archive of Ford&#x27;s papers and correspondence. The Fine Art Society held a memorial exhibition for Ford in 1905, from which the Victoria and Albert Museum in London purchased a, unfinished, bronze titled &quot;Fate&quot;. Several other national collections in Britain hold examples of Ford&#x27;s work, notably the Tate, the National Portrait Gallery in London, the Lady Lever Art Gallery on Merseyside and the Walker Art Gallery in Liverpool.

<doc id="838084" wikidata="Q12858578" url="?curid=838084" title="InterCity (British Rail)">
<text>InterCity (or, in the earliest days, the hyphenated Inter-City) was a brand name introduced by British Rail in 1966 for its long-haul express passenger services (see British Rail brand names for a full history).

In 1982, the British Railways Board divided its operations into a number of sectors (sectorisation). The sector responsible for long-distance express trains assumed the brand-name InterCity, although many routes that were previously operated as InterCity services were assigned to other sectors (e.g. London to King&#x27;s Lynn services were transferred to the commuter sector Network SouthEast).

==InterCity brand==

===Etymology===
InterCity derives from the prepositional of the with &quot;City&quot; giving rise to meaning &quot;between cities&quot;.

===The Inter-City train===
British Rail first used the term &quot;Inter-City&quot; in 1950 as the name of a train running between London Paddington and Wolverhampton Low Level. This was part of an overall policy of introducing new train names in the post World War II period.

The name was applied to the business express which ran from London in the morning and returned in the afternoon, and became part of the railway lore of the West Midlands. West Midlands residents always believed that it was the success of this one train that led to the adoption of the name as a British Rail brand in 1966. This belief was supported by the timeline: in 1966 &quot;The Inter-City&quot; was heading towards its ultimate demise in 1967, when the mainline London-West Midlands service was consolidated into the newly electrified route via Rugby.

===InterCity brand===
British Rail introduced the Inter-City brand for long haul passenger services in 1966.

===Other brand users===
The InterCity brand has also been adopted by countries in Europe.

==InterCity Company==
With sectorisation of British Rail in 1982 most long haul services became consolidated in the InterCity division which retained the brand. InterCity became profitable and one of Britain&#x27;s top 150 companies, providing city centre to city centre travel across the nation from Aberdeen and Inverness in the north to Poole and Penzance in the south.

==Divisions==
InterCity had the following divisions:

* East Coast: Services on the East Coast Main Line from London King&#x27;s Cross to Yorkshire, North East England and eastern Scotland.
* West Coast: Services on the West Coast Main Line from London Euston to the West Midlands, North Wales, North West England and southern Scotland, including overnight sleeper services to Scotland.
* Midland: Services on the Midland Main Line from London St Pancras to the East Midlands and South Yorkshire.
* Great Western: Services on the Great Western Main Line from London Paddington to South Wales and the West Country, including overnight sleeper services to the West Country.
* Great Eastern: Services on the Great Eastern Main Line from London Liverpool Street to Essex and East Anglia.
* Cross-Country: Services between city pairs that used a combination of the various main lines, but usually avoided Greater London; many of these served the Cross-Country Route.
* Gatwick Express: Shuttle service between London Victoria and Gatwick Airport.
* Motorail: long-distance services that carried passengers and their cars. Later it was grouped under the wider InterCity sector.
* InterCity Sleepers: Night Train service between to Scotland (along the WCML), to Scotland (along the ECML) (pre 1986) and to 
Note: &quot; before 1974 services also ran from to .

==Operations==
InterCity operated High Speed Trains (HST) under the brand-name &quot;InterCity 125&quot;, as well as InterCity 225s for the electric high-speed trains operated on the East Coast route. The &quot;125&quot; referred to the trains&#x27; top speed in miles per hour (mph), equivalent to 201 km/h, whereas &quot;225&quot; referred to the intended top speed in km/h (equivalent to 140 mph) and for signalling reasons their actual speed limit was the same 125 mph. &quot;InterCity 250&quot; was the name given by InterCity to the proposed upgrade of the West Coast Main Line in the early 1990s. The existing trains operating on the West Coast were intended to be marketed under the brand InterCity 175, again referring to those trains&#x27; top operating speed of 110 mph, roughly equivalent to 175 km/h, although this idea was subsequently dropped.

All InterCity day services ran with a buffet car and the majority ran at speeds of 100 mph or above. If expresses on other sectors are included, there was a period in the early 1990s when British Rail operated more 100 mph services per day than any other country. Special discounted fares, including the Super Advance and the APEX, were available on InterCity if booked ahead.

==Rolling stock==
HST services were first introduced in 1976 on the Great Western Main Line from London Paddington to Bristol, Cardiff and Swansea. Formations consisted of 2 first-class, a Restaurant Buffet and 4 standard-class Mark 3 carriages with a Class 43 power car at each end.

East Coast – InterCity 125 HST services started in 1977: Typically 2 first-class, a Restaurant Kitchen, Buffet Standard and 4 standard-class British Rail Mark 3 carriages with a Class 43 power car at each end. These progressively replaced Class 55 &quot;Deltics&quot; which were finally withdrawn in 1981. Later, as catering needs changed, the Restaurant Kitchen was replaced by a fifth standard-class coach. InterCity 225: a Class 91 electric locomotive, nine Mark 4 coaches and a Driving Van Trailer (DVT) operating in push-pull mode; introduced in 1990, with electrification completed in 1991. This saw most of the HSTs transferred to Great Western, Midland and Cross-Country routes, but some remained for the runs to/from Aberdeen, Inverness and Hull.

West Coast – London Euston to Wolverhampton used Class 86 electric locomotives hauling Mark 2 carriages and operated at 100 mph. Euston to Glasgow services used Class 86, Class 87, and Class 90 locomotives hauling Mark 3 coaches and operated at 110 mph. Euston to Holyhead services used Class 47 hauled Mark 2s or HSTs. From 1988, West Coast trains operated in push-pull mode with a DVT at the London end of the train. Before DVTs were introduced, larger fleets of Classes 81–87 were used to haul the trains conventionally. Class 50s operated in pairs north of Preston until electrification was completed in 1974.

Midland – Class 45, 46 and 47 locomotives hauling Mark 1 and Mark 2 carriages. HSTs replaced the loco-hauled trains in the 1980s.

Great Western – InterCity 125s from new, which replaced Class 50s, which in turn, replaced Class 52s. Other services were also operated by Mark 2 carriages hauled by Class 47s and 50s; later these were transferred to Network SouthEast and replaced by Class 165 DMUs.

Great Eastern – Class 47 diesels hauled Mark 1 and Mark 2 carriages before electrification of the route in the mid-80s. Class 86 electrics were introduced to haul trains from Liverpool Street to Ipswich from 1985, with through electric trains reaching Norwich by 1987. Mark 2 Driving Brake Standard Opens were cascaded from Scotland in the early 90s, so that trains could operate in push-pull mode. Some routes transferred to Network SouthEast, leaving London-Norwich and the London-Harwich boat-train with InterCity.

Cross Country – Some routes were operated by InterCity 125s, but with only one first class carriage and standard class seats in the buffet car replaced the restaurant. Other routes saw Mark 2 carriages hauled by Class 47 diesel locomotives. Services operating north of Birmingham on the West Coast main line switched to electric traction using Class 86 and Class 90 locomotives. DVTs were not used.

Gatwick Express – Originally used dedicated Class 423 electric multiple units as part of the Southern Region. Prior to being transferred to InterCity, the service ran from London Victoria calling at Clapham Junction, East Croydon (sometimes via Redhill) and Gatwick Airport running via Haywards Heath to Brighton. The service was transferred to InterCity with Class 73 electro-diesel locomotives (electric third-rail current or diesel-powered) hauling Mark 2 coaches and a modified driving motor carriage were introduced in 1984 in push-pull mode. When InterCity took over, the service only served London Victoria and Gatwick Airport.

Sleepers – Originally consisted of Mark 2 or Mark 3 seating coaches with Mark 1 sleeper cars. Mark 3 sleeper cars replaced the Mark 1s in the early 1980s. DVTs were not used. The &quot;Night Riviera&quot; (Paddington-Penzance) was hauled by Class 47s while the Euston-Scotland sleepers were usually hauled by Class 86, 87 or 90 electric locomotives as far as Edinburgh and Glasgow. The sections north of Edinburgh were hauled by Class 37 or 47 diesel locomotives to/from Aberdeen and Inverness, while the section to/from Fort William was hauled by Class 37s. The London Euston to Stranraer Harbour service worked on the same basis with a change from electric to diesel at Carlisle. The service to Holyhead saw locomotive changes at Crewe.

===Fleet details===
==Train formation==
Formations of HST and push–pull train sets would always place the driving van at the London end of the train, then two or three first-class carriages, restaurant and buffet car, and 5 standard-class carriages; the locomotive would always be at the country end of the train. The only exception was the London to Norwich route. As Crown Point depot is to the south of Norwich station, the locomotives worked from the London end as this facilitated easier loco changing at Norwich if necessary. Operating trains in push-pull mode eliminated the requirement to attach locos at terminus stations in order to turn the trains around. This also saved maintenance costs and reduced the number of locomotives and carriages needed to operate the services.

==Livery==
British Rail introduced a new corporate livery in 1965. The basic blue colour was relieved on long-distance coaches by a light grey panel around the windows. The fronts of locomotives and multiple-unit trains were painted yellow to improve visibility, and this was often wrapped around on to the side in varying amounts. This was therefore the colour scheme used by the new Inter-City services when they were launched the following year. Coaches used on these routes later had a white &#x27;Inter-City&#x27; logo added to the blue area near the door at the left end of each side. This was extended to show the purpose of specialist vehicles such as &#x27;Inter-City Sleeper&#x27;.

When the production High Speed Train (HST) sets entered service in 1976, they too carried the blue and grey livery. The coaches carried an &#x27;Inter-City 125&#x27; logo by the left-hand door. The part of the power car nearest the passenger coaches was also painted blue and grey, but most of the power car was painted yellow with a wide blue panel which lined up with the grey on the coaches. On this blue panel was a large &#x27;Inter-City 125&#x27; logo, albeit in outline rather than solid white.

===Executive livery===
The first production Advanced Passenger Train was unveiled on 7 June 1978. It was painted in a new livery with dark grey upper body and light grey lower body separated by wide white and red bands. The roof was white to reduce solar heating, and a large &#x27;InterCity APT&#x27; logotype was positioned on the dark grey section of the power cars – &#x27;InterCity&#x27; had no hyphen and was solid white but the &#x27;APT&#x27; was an outline. A new &#x27;Executive&#x27; service was part of the relaunch of the InterCity Sector on 3 October 1983. This saw the coaches of the Manchester Pullman and two HSTs refurbished and repainted experimentally into the same colour scheme as the APT. The HSTs continued to carry an outline &#x27;InterCity 125&#x27; logotype (now with no hyphen) and the large yellow area on the power car that had been a feature of the blue and grey livery. The logotype on coaches was positioned as before but changed to black. By May 1984 other coaches and locomotives were entering service in the dark and light grey livery. 87012 &quot;Coeur de Lion&quot; entered service with black numbers on the cab side but no logo. 73123 &quot;Gatwick Express&quot; had white numbers and a large double arrow logo on the dark grey of its bodyside, although the new Gatwick Express service was not operated by the InterCity Sector. In use there were problems with the light colour showing dirt on the diesel HSTs and so dark grey was extended from the roof to cover louvres near the top of the power car body, and the logotype was changed from an outline to solid white to make it more striking. The use of the term &#x27;Executive&#x27; was dropped in 1985 and the livery was then referred to as just &#x27;InterCity&#x27;.

===Swallow livery===
A new logotype was introduced on 1 May 1987 as part of InterCity&#x27;s 21st anniversary celebrations. The colours were unchanged (although locomotives often carried less yellow than before) but locomotives, carriages and advertising received a new logotype. The word &quot;INTERCITY&quot; was presented in italic, serif upper case letters. A new swallow logo &#x27;to symbolise grace and speed&#x27; replaced the double arrow. It was announced that the new branding would appear on &#x27;all InterCity trains that meet high quality standards&#x27;. The logotype was omitted from some older locomotives that were otherwise carrying InterCity livery, although some locomotives that predominantly worked in Scotland were given a ScotRail logotype.

==Privatisation==
During the privatisation of British Rail, InterCity&#x27;s services were divided up into several franchises. Initial plans were for the train operating companies to co-operate to continue providing a consistent InterCity network, but disagreements meant this did not occur. Great Western Trains registered the term as a British trademark and applied it to its HSTs, but the term fell into disuse before Great Western was bought by FirstGroup in 1998. Occasional services are run using &#x27;Inter-City&#x27; branded coaches, usually where additional rolling stock has been hired, but the term is not in official use by train operators. The planned upgrade to many of Britain&#x27;s former InterCity lines has been termed Intercity Express Programme. The new operators replaced the InterCity branding and liveries with their own branding. One set of Mark 2 carriages remained in InterCity livery until withdrawn by National Express East Anglia in 2005. Several locomotives and carriages have subsequently been repainted into InterCity livery. Virgin CrossCountry repainted 47826 into InterCity livery in December 2001. Some stations on the West Coast Main Line still retain Swallow motifs in 2017. Abellio ScotRail announced that it is to revive the InterCity name on new services operated by refurbished High Speed Train sets, linking the seven cities in Scotland, from mid-2018.

==InterCity Railtours==
The train operating company Locomotive Services Limited has begun to reuse the InterCity name for its numerous programmes of electric-worked or occasional diesel railtours. An Intercity-liveried set of first-class Mk3 coaches, including a matching DVT, is used for the trains. The electric locomotives used for the tours are painted in the matching InterCity paint scheme. Electric locomotives allocated to these trains include British Rail Class 86s, Class 87s &amp; Class 90s. The unique Class 89 No 89001 is planned to be used to haul InterCity trains following the completion of its restoration. Most diesel-worked trains use locos which are not painted in InterCity livery. Although allocated for use on diesel and electric railtours, the coaches have on occasion been hauled by steam locomotives when out on test.

<doc id="838101" wikidata="Q588662" url="?curid=838101" title="Soda jerk">
<text>Soda jerk (or soda jerker) is an American term used to refer to a person—typically a young man—who would operate the soda fountain in a restaurant, preparing and serving soda drinks and ice cream sodas. The drinks were made by mixing flavored syrup, carbonated water, and occasionally malt powder over either ice or a few scoops of ice cream. The drink would then be served in a tall glass with a long-handled spoon, most commonly known as a &quot;soda spoon&quot;, and drinking straws.

Soda jerks were relatively common in the United States from the 1920s until the late 1950s; due to economic and social trends, the occupation essentially no longer exists.

==Origin of term== 
The term &quot;soda jerk&quot; was a pun on &quot;soda clerk&quot;, the formal job title of the drugstore assistants who operated soda fountains. It was inspired by the &quot;jerking&quot; action the server would implement to drive the fountain handle back and forth when adding soda. The soda fountain spigot itself was typically a sturdy, shiny fixture attached at the end of a pipe which protruded over the counter and curved down at the end for filling glasses. Since most drinks required carbonated water, the tap handle was built large to accommodate frequent use of the fountain.

==History==
The practice of operating a soda fountain in a drugstore reached its peak popularity in the 1940s but was popular from the 1920s through the 1950s. The position was coveted, and was commonly only awarded after protracted menial labor in the store. Soda jerking was dominated by popular young men with loud personalities and good people skills because of the popular environment and &quot;cool&quot; association. These boys who worked at the shops were expected to serve the drinks and also socialize and entertain the guests.

Michael Karl Witzel describes an archetypal soda jerk as &quot;[a] consummate showman, innovator and freelance linguist... the pop culture star of the Gilded Age&quot;.

The proliferation of ice cream parlors declined as drive-ins and walk-up fast food stands grew in popularity, and grill and fry cooks replaced soda jerks.

== Lingo ==
Soda jerks were known for having their own lingo for how their drinks were made. They created nicknames for different drinks. For example, they called a glass of milk &quot;baby&quot; and a strawberry milkshake &quot;in the hay&quot;. A Coca-Cola with ice was called &quot;scratch one&quot;. They also had lingo to express how they wanted their drink to be served. Coffee, or &quot;draw one&quot; would be served strong if called &quot;draw one from the south&quot;. If a drink was ordered with extra ice it was &quot;heavy on the hail&quot;.

Some of these terms are still used today. Egg creams, the shorthand for a chocolate soda with some milk, are served in many places and are especially known in New York where they originated.

Another term from soda-jerk lingo that remains in use is &quot;concrete&quot;, a name for an extremely thick milkshake or custard. For example, Culver&#x27;s continues to serve their famous Concrete Mixers.

<text>Christopher Patrick John O&#x27;Kelly (18 November 1895 – 15 November 1922) was a Canadian First World War officer and prospector. O&#x27;Kelly was a recipient of the Victoria Cross, the highest and most prestigious award for gallantry in the face of the enemy that can be awarded to British and Commonwealth forces.

==Biography==

Born in Winnipeg, Manitoba, O&#x27;Kelly joined the Canadian Expeditionary Force in October 1915 during the First World War. He was 21 years old and an acting captain in the 52nd Battalion (New Ontario), CEF, when on 26 October 1917, in the Battle of Passchendaele, Belgium, he led his company in the action that resulted in his Victoria Cross. His citation reads:

Lt. (A./Capt.) Christopher Patrick John O&#x27;Kelly, M.C., Can. Inf.

For most conspicuous bravery in an action in which he led his company with extraordinary skill and determination. After the original attack had failed and two companies of his unit had launched a new attack, Capt. O&#x27;Kelly advanced his command over 1,000 yards under heavy fire without any artillery barrage, took the enemy positions on the crest of the hill by storm, and then personally organised and led a series of attacks against &quot; Pill-boxes,&quot; his company alone capturing six of them with 100 prisoners and 10 machine guns. Later on in the afternoon, under the leadership of this gallant officer, his company repelled a strong counter-attack, taking more prisoners, and subsequently during the night captured a hostile raiding party consisting of one officer, 10 men and a machine
gun.

The whole of these achievements were chiefly due to the magnificent courage, daring and ability of Capt. O&#x27;Kelly.
He was later promoted the rank of major. 

After the war, O&#x27;Kelly became a prospector in northwestern Ontario. 

He drowned in 1922 while canoeing on Lac Seul. His Victoria Cross is displayed at the Canadian War Museum in Ottawa, Canada.

<doc id="838103" wikidata="Q7249748" url="?curid=838103" title="Prominent Americans series">
<text>The Prominent Americans series is a set of definitive stamps issued by the United States Post Office Department (and later the United States Postal Service) between 1965 and 1978.

It superseded the Liberty Issue of 1954, which by the mid-1960s had become somewhat dated, especially in its focus on political figures. This was the first U. S. omnibus definitive series in which Benjamin Franklin did not appear on one of the lower-valued issues. The values of the new series included figures from all walks of life, each depicted in a different style by a different designer, presumably in a quest for wider diversity—a significant departure from the uniformity of concept that had marked previous definitive issues. That portraits of two women appear in the series (Elizabeth Blackwell and Lucy Stone) represented a small but significant step toward gender equality in U. S. Stamp history: no previous definitive set had included more than one prominent female (Martha Washington in the issues of 1902, 1922 and 1938; Susan B. Anthony in the Liberty series). This was also the first definitive issue to include a stamp devoted to an African-American, with Frederick Douglass portrayed on the 25¢ denomination.

The stamps appeared one by one from 1965 on, and the basic designs had all been issued by 1968; tagged versions made their first appearances gradually through 1973, and coil and booklet versions of the 15¢ were issued in 1978 in response to a first-class rate change.

The 5¢ Washington was originally excessively shaded around the lower part of the face, so much so that it has come to be known as the &quot;dirty face&quot; or &quot;unshaven&quot; Washington. Originally appearing in February 1966, it was superseded by a lightened version in November 1967. The $1 Eugene O&#x27;Neill stamp was notable for its repeated use by Theodore Kaczynski, the Unabomber, who habitually used them on his mail bombs.
Stamps of the series:

*1¢ green - Thomas Jefferson, third President of the United States

<text>A soda fountain is a device that dispenses carbonated soft drinks, called fountain drinks. They can be found in restaurants, concession stands and other locations such as convenience stores. The machine combines flavored syrup or syrup concentrate and carbon dioxide with chilled and purified water to make soft drinks, either manually, or in a vending machine which is essentially an automated soda fountain that is operated using a soda gun. Today, the syrup often is pumped from a special container called a bag-in-box (BiB).

Fountain coke is an often confused term normally referring to a handheld dispenser behind a bar or counter that are used in many countries, including Spain, France and the United Kingdom. The term &#x27;fountain&#x27; helps differentiate from &#x27;machine&#x27; cola, as the fountain is more easily controlled and offers more flavours.

A soda fountain is also referred to as a postmix machine in some markets. Any brand of soft drink that is available as postmix syrup may be dispensed by a fountain.

The term may also refer to a small eating establishment, soda shop or luncheonette, common from the late 19th century until the mid-20th century, often inside a drugstore, candy store or other business, where a soda jerk served carbonated beverages, ice cream, and sometimes light meals. The soda jerk&#x27;s fountain generally dispensed only unflavored carbonated water, to which various syrups were added by hand only.

==History==

The soda fountain was an attempt to replicate mineral waters that bubbled up from the Earth. Many civilizations believed that drinking, and bathing, in these mineral waters cured diseases. Large industries often sprang up around hot springs, such as Bath in England (43 AD) or the many &quot;onsen&quot; of Japan.

Although vessels to bottle and transport water were part of the earliest human civilizations, bottling water began in the United Kingdom with the first water bottling at the Holy Well in 1621. The demand for bottled water was fueled in large part by the resurgence in spa-going and water therapy among Europeans and American colonists in the 17th and 18th centuries. The first commercially distributed water in America was bottled and sold by Jackson&#x27;s Spa in Boston in 1767. Early drinkers of bottled spa waters believed that the water at these mineral springs had therapeutic properties, and that bathing in or drinking the water could help treat many common ailments. Many types of mineral water are sparkling, and thus so were they when bottled.

Early scientists tried to create effervescent waters with curative powers, including Robert Boyle, Friedrich Hoffmann, Jean Baptiste van Helmont, William Brownrigg, Antoine Laurent Lavoisier, and David Macbride. In the early 1770s, Swedish chemist Torbern Bergman, and (separately) English scientist Joseph Priestley invented equipment for saturating water with carbon dioxide. In 1774, John Mervin Nooth demonstrated an apparatus that improved upon Priestley&#x27;s design. In 1807, Henry Thompson received the first British patent for a method of impregnating water with carbon dioxide. This was commonly called soda water, although it contained no sodium bicarbonate.

The soda fountain began in Europe, but achieved its greatest success in the U.S. Benjamin Silliman, a Yale chemistry professor, was among the first to introduce soda water to America. In 1806, Silliman purchased a Nooth apparatus and began selling mineral waters in New Haven, Connecticut. Sales were brisk, so he built a bigger apparatus, opened a pump room, and took in three partners. This partnership opened soda fountains in New York City and Baltimore, Maryland. At roughly the same time, other businessmen opened fountains in New York City and Philadelphia. Although Silliman&#x27;s business eventually failed, he played an important role in popularizing soda water.

In 1832, John Matthews of New York City and John Lippincott of Philadelphia began manufacturing soda fountains. Both added innovations that improved soda-fountain equipment, and the industry expanded as retail outlets installed newer, better fountains. Other pioneering manufacturers were Alvin Puffer, Andrew Morse, Gustavus Dows, and James Tufts. In 1891 the four largest manufacturers—Tufts, Puffer, Lippincott, and Matthews—formed the American Soda Fountain Company, which was a trust designed to monopolize the industry. The four manufacturers continued to produce and market fountains under their company names. The trust controlled prices and forced some smaller manufacturers out of business.

Before mechanical refrigeration, soda fountains used ice to cool drinks and ice cream. Ice harvesters cut ice from frozen lakes and ponds in the winter and stored the blocks in ice houses for use in the summer. In the early 20th century, new companies entered the soda fountain business, marketing &quot;iceless&quot; fountains that used brine.
The L.A. Becker Company, the Liquid Carbonic Company, and the Bishop &amp; Babcock Company dominated the iceless fountain business. In 1888 Jacob Baur of Terre Haute, Indiana founded the Liquid Carbonics Manufacturing Company in Chicago, becoming the Midwest&#x27;s first manufacturer of liquefied carbon dioxide. In 1903 Liquid Carbonic began market-testing its prototype iceless fountain in a Chicago confectionery. Louis A. Becker was a salesman who started his own manufacturing business in 1898, making the 20th-Century Sanitary Soda Fountain. In 1904 Becker&#x27;s company produced its first iceless fountain. In 1908 William H. Wallace obtained a patent for an iceless fountain and installed his prototype in an Indianapolis drugstore. He sold his patent to Marietta Manufacturing Company, which was absorbed by Bishop &amp; Babcock of Cleveland.
Liquid Carbonic spawned another leading soda fountain manufacturer, the Bastian-Blessing Company. Two Liquid Carbonic employees, Charles Bastian and Lewis Blessing, started their company in 1908. The newer manufacturers competed with the American Soda Fountain Company and took a large share of the market. The trust was broken up, and its member companies struggled to stay in business. During World War I, some manufacturers marketed &quot;50% fountains,&quot; which used a combination of ice and mechanical refrigeration. In the early 1920s, many retail outlets purchased soda fountains using ammonia refrigeration.
In their heyday, soda fountains flourished in pharmacies, ice cream parlors, candy stores, dime stores, department stores, milk bars and train stations. They served an important function as a public space where neighbors could socialize and exchange community news. In the early 20th century many fountains expanded their menus and became lunch counters, serving light meals as well as ice cream sodas, egg creams, sundaes, and such. Soda fountains reached their height in the 1940s and 1950s.

In 1950, Walgreens, one of the largest chains of American drug stores, introduced full self-service drug stores that began the decline of the soda fountain, as did the coming of the Car Culture and the rise of suburbia. Drive-in restaurants and roadside ice cream outlets, such as Dairy Queen, competed for customers. North American retail stores switched to self-service soda vending machines selling pre-packaged soft drinks in cans, and the labor-intensive soda fountain did not fit into the new sales scheme. Today only a sprinkling of vintage soda fountains survive.

In the Eastern Bloc countries, self-service soda fountains, located in shopping centers, farmers markets, or simply on the sidewalk in busy areas, became popular by the mid-20th century. In the USSR, a glass of carbonated water would sell for 1 kopeck, while for 3 kopecks one could buy a glass of fruit-flavored soda. Most of these vending machines have disappeared since 1990; a few remain, usually provided with an operator.

==In literature and popular culture==
The arrival of soda fountain establishments in Glasgow, Scotland, was satirised by Neil Munro in his Erchie MacPherson story, &quot;The Soda-Fountain Future&quot;, first published in the &quot;Glasgow Evening News&quot; on 11 October 1920.

Zürich is a major railway hub, with services to and from across Switzerland and neighbouring countries such as Germany, Italy, Austria and France. The station was originally constructed as the terminus of the Spanisch Brötli Bahn, the first railway built completely within Switzerland. Serving up to 2,915 trains per day, Zürich HB is one of the busiest railway stations in the world. It was ranked as the best European railway station in 2023 and 2024.

The station can be found at the northern end of the Altstadt, or &quot;old town&quot;, and east of the Europaallee in central Zürich, near the confluence of the rivers Limmat and Sihl. (The Sihl passes through the station in a tunnel with railway tracks both above and below.) The station is on several levels, with platforms both at ground and below-ground level, and tied together by underground passages and the ShopVille shopping mall. The station&#x27;s railway yards extend about to the west.

The station is included in the Swiss Inventory of Cultural Property of National Significance.

Besides Zürich HB, there are 22 railway stations in the municipality of Zürich: Affoltern, , Binz, Brunau, , Friesenberg, Giesshübel, , Leimbach, Manegg, , Saalsporthalle, Schweighof, , , , , , , , and (excluding the five stations of the Forch railway, which uses the tracks of the tram system in Zürich). Another railway station, Letten, has been disused since 1989.

== History ==

=== The first station ===

The first Zürich railway station was built by , on what were then the north-western outskirts of the city. It occupied a piece of land between the rivers Limmat and Sihl, and trains accessed it from the west via a bridge over the Sihl. At the eastern end of the station was a turntable, used for turning locomotives. This basic terminal station layout, with all trains arriving from the west, was to set the basic design of the station for the next 143 years.

The new station was the initially the terminus of the Swiss Northern Railway, more often called the &quot;Spanisch-Brötli-Bahn&quot;, which opened on 9 August 1847 and linked Zürich with Baden. Initially the railway lines in the station were laid to a gauge of , perhaps because the same gauge was used at the contemporaneous and nearby Grand Duchy of Baden State Railway.

From the opening of the station, the railways of northern Switzerland developed rapidly, and by 1853 the Swiss Northern Railway had been merged into the Swiss Northeastern Railway (&quot;Schweizerische Nordostbahn&quot;; NOB). Also in 1853, the tracks in the station were regauged to the standard gauge () that is still used by all lines in the station. In 1856, the NOB completed its line from the station to Winterthur via the Wipkingen Tunnel and Oerlikon. In 1858, the NOB completed its line from Baden via Brugg to Aarau, where it connected with the Swiss Central Railway (&quot;Schweizerische Centralbahn&quot;; SCB), thus providing connections to Basel, Solothurn and Lausanne.

With further railways planned, it became clear that the 1847 station was not large enough. A rebuild was started to meet Zürich&#x27;s increased transport needs, albeit on the same site and using the same basic layout.

=== The 1871 station ===

In 1871, the replacement station building opened, to a design by architect Jakob Friedrich Wanner. Its main entrance is a triumphal arch facing the end of the then newly built Bahnhofstrasse. In front of the arch stands a monument to the railway pioneer Alfred Escher. The magnificent sandstone neo-Renaissance building features richly decorated lobbies and atriums, restaurants and halls. Originally housed inside it was the headquarters of the Schweizerische Nordostbahn (NOB). The train shed, spanned by iron trusses, initially covered six tracks. 

The station was named &quot;Zürich Hauptbahnhof&quot; in 1893, to reflect that year&#x27;s incorporation of many of Zürich&#x27;s suburbs into an enlarged municipality. In 1902, the year in which the Swiss Federal Railways (SBB) took over the Schweizerische Centralbahn and the NOB, the tracks inside the eastern end of the train shed were lifted, due to a lack of space. Since then, these tracks have terminated at a more central location, immediately to the north of the Bahnhofstrasse. Also in 1902, four more tracks and a north wing with a restaurant and railway mail service were added to the north of the train shed. In the vacant space left inside the train shed, new rooms were built for baggage handling.

On 18 February 1916, the SBB decided that electrification of its network would be by the high-tension single-phase alternating current system that is still used on all routes. On 5 February 1923, the electrified Zug–Zürich railway was put into operation, the first electrified line to Zurich. By 1927 all routes from Zürich Hauptbahnhof had been electrified.

In 1933, the station&#x27;s simple concourse and the iron and glass train shed were created with seven and a half arches to cover 16 tracks. As part of that work, the main shed was shortened by two segments.

In the 1940s, the line between Zürich and Geneva served as a &quot;parade route&quot;. The first lightweight steel express train had entered service on this route in 1937. By 11 June 1960, the SBB network was largely electrified. In the following year, the SBB introduced its first four-system electric trains under the Trans Europ Express banner, and thereby increased the Zürich Hauptbahnhof&#x27;s international importance.

In 1963, about 500 metres before the concourse, an imposing six-storey concrete cube arose in the station yard. It was designed by SBB architect , and it has been the home of the &quot;Zentralstellwerk Zürich&quot; (central signalling control) since 1966. The then state-of-the-art relay-controlled interlocking system replaced the decentralised mechanical and electro-mechanical signal boxes in the station throat, including the &quot;Stellwerk «Seufzerbrücke»&quot; (&quot;&quot;Bridge of Sighs&quot; signal box&quot;), which had spanned the entire station throat just east of the Langstrasse.

The signalling control system was modernised to coincide with the commissioning of the Zürich S-Bahn. It is equipped with a computerised controller that performs the standard operations. Apart from the tracks and points (switches) of the &quot;Sihlpost station&quot; (which are controlled by an electronic control system), the entire control of the points and signals in the Langstrasse–Concourse section is still largely under relay control, in some cases with the original relay sets installed in 1966.

The immense station yard, with its platform tracks and station building, is a bottleneck for the city of Zürich. The Limmat and the Sihl were further bottlenecks, and the combination of the three led to gridlock in the 1950s and 1960s. In parallel, there were plans for a subway system. Although the people voted against it in 1962, the city&#x27;s Civil Engineering Department had already started to convert the Bahnhofplatz for the purpose of a possible underground line.
=== ShopVille and S-Bahn ===

On 1 October 1970, construction of the Bahnhofplatz, as well as the pedestrian and shopping arcade ShopVille was completed. Upon its opening, the Bahnhofplatz became a pedestrian-free zone, and the underground ShopVille the only access to the station. Contrary to expectations, ShopVille did not capture the support of the people, who, in 1973, voted even more emphatically to reject a subway system.

In the 1980s, ShopVille became a drug-dealing hub, due to its proximity to the &quot;Autonomes Jugendzentrum Zürich&quot; (&quot;Autonomous Youth Center Zürich&quot;). Its low point was reached at the end of the decade, when travellers avoided all parts of it other than the concourse and the tram stop. Consequently, there were several night-time closures by mesh fences. However, the solution to this problem was foreseeable, as the people had agreed on 29 November 1981 to the construction of the Zürich S-Bahn and the extension of the Sihltal Zürich Uetliberg Bahn to the Hauptbahnhof.

The long Hirschengraben Tunnel was built for the S-Bahn from the Hauptbahnhof to Zürich Stadelhofen. This new line continued through the Zürichberg Tunnel to Stettbach, with connections to the existing lines to Dietlikon and Dübendorf. In the Hauptbahnhof, two underground stations were constructed. For the S-Bahn, a four-track station with the working title &quot;Museumstrasse&quot; was built, and the Sihltal Zürich Uetliberg Bahn was extended to the station, which had once been intended for the never-realized U-Bahn.

The opening of the S-Bahn was on 27 May 1990, and since then, the ShopVille arcades have connected the two underground stations with the main hall. Black and white striped marble walls and granite floors are the main design features of what is one of the largest shopping centres in Switzerland. In 1996, the main hall was cleared of its temporary installations. In 1997, the train shed was fitted on both sides with pitched roofs on sloping concrete supports, designed by local architects Marcel Meili and Markus Peter.
=== Löwenstrasse station ===

The planning of the S-Bahn and the Rail 2000 long-haul project raised the idea of building the Weinberg Tunnel, a through route from Zürich Hauptbahnhof to Oerlikon. That proposal was initially postponed, but the great success of the S-Bahn led to an expansion of services and, consequently, to capacity constraints. Plans were made to expand existing rail lines within Zürich leading to the north, but this encountered resistance from the population living near those rail lines. As an alternative the construction of the Weinberg tunnel and four additional underground tracks in the railway station was suggested and confirmed by a referendum.

In 2002, an architectural competition was held for the new &quot;Löwenstrasse transit station&quot;, won by the architect . On 22 December 2006, the Federal Office of Transport approved the building of the tunnel and a third underground four-track Löwenstrasse station. In September 2007, construction began on the project, nicknamed &quot;Durchmesserlinie&quot; (cross-city link). On 14 June 2014, the new platforms and tunnels were opened.

The new line runs from the Altstetten railway station, crosses the Zürich HB station throat on a bridge, and leads into the underground Löwenstrasse station. From there, it goes through the new, approximately long Weinberg Tunnel in a long left-hand curve under the existing Zürich HB–Stadelhofen line. It then ends at the level of the portals of the existing &quot;Wipkinger Tunnels&quot; in Oerlikon, where it connects with the northbound lines, including the line to Zürich Airport and Winterthur.

In 2007, the SBB and Deutsche Bahn entered into a station partnership between the Zürich HB and the Berlin Hauptbahnhof to promote knowledge sharing between operators of similarly sized stations.
== Layout and facilities ==

=== Layout ===
The station is aligned approximately east to west, at the northern edge of the city centre and the northern end of &quot;Bahnhofstrasse&quot;, the city&#x27;s main shopping street. North of the station are the Platzspitz park and the Swiss National Museum (). East of the station is the river Limmat with two bridges, the and the &quot;Bahnhofbrücke&quot;.

The station is split over three principal levels, with the ground level housing sixteen terminal platform track and the station&#x27;s main concourse. Below this level are a series of pedestrian passageways, the ShopVille shopping centre, and the course of the Sihl river. At the lowest level, and parallel to the terminal platforms at ground level, are ten underground platform tracks, of which two are terminal () and eight are through ().

The station&#x27;s main concourse itself comprises two sections. To the east is the (), which was the train hall of the 1871 station but is now a pedestrian circulation space, sometimes also used for events and exhibits. The is surrounded on three sides by station buildings, whilst to the west it opens onto the (), which stretches across the head of the ground level terminal platforms. These platforms, comprising two side platforms and seven island platforms, are sheltered by the 1933-built train shed and are served by tracks () numbered 3 to 18.

At the subterranean middle level, the station site is crossed north to south by four pedestrian passageways (). The eastern three of these, the , the and the , form an interconnected complex with the ShopVille shopping complex and give direct access to all the station&#x27;s platforms as well as to the surrounding streets. An intermediate underground level, immediately below the , connects these passageways with the concourse. The westernmost passage, the , lies to the west of the Sihl, which passes under the station from north to south at the same level as the passageways. Because of the presence of the river channel, the Sihlquai passage has no direct connection to the other passageways, but it connects to streets to the north and south of the station, and to all platforms except that serving tracks 21 and 22.

At the lowest level, there are three groups of underground platforms. The most southerly are terminal tracks 21 and 22 of the station, with a single island platform, and accessible only to trains on the SZU&#x27;s Sihltal (S4) and Uetliberg (S10) lines. To the north of these are two island platforms serving tracks 31 to 34, known as the &quot;Löwenstrasse&quot; station, which link to the station&#x27;s western and southern rail approaches, and to an eastern approach via the Weinberg tunnel from Oerlikon station. Some distance to the north of these are two further island platforms serving tracks 41 to 44, known as the &quot;Museumstrasse&quot; station, which also link to the station&#x27;s western and northern approaches, and to an eastern approach via the Hirschengraben Tunnel from Stadelhofen station.
=== Facilities ===

Underneath the Bahnhofplatz and the station is the large underground shopping centre called &quot;ShopVille&quot; of over 200 shops or other businesses. It benefits from the Swiss employment law rule that while generally labour on Sundays is not allowed, it is allowed in &quot;centres of public transport&quot;. The huge underground &quot;Rail City&quot; is, therefore, usually bustling on Sundays even while the streets of Zurich are largely empty. The western underpass (between Sihlpost and Sihlquai) also contains shops and take aways. Between 2018 and 2023, the south wing of the station building, facing &quot;Bahnhofplatz&quot;, was renovated. It features shops, restaurants and ticket offices.

Events take place regularly in the &quot;Haupthalle&quot;, including &quot;open air&quot; cinema; vegetable, flea and Christmas markets; and events such as skating, beach volleyball and the &quot;warm up&quot; for the Street Parade.

Since 8 June 2009, Zürich HB has been the site of the first &quot;SBB Lounge&quot;. This waiting room was exclusively for holders of a first-class general subscription or a valid international first-class ticket or for frequent traveller program members of the Railteam partner railways. However, the lounge was closed in 2016.

The station also has its own chapel, jointly run by the Evangelical Reformed and the Roman Catholic churches, but open to travellers of all denominations or religions. The chapel is located on the intermediate underground level, immediately below the &quot;Haupthalle&quot;.
Between 2009 and 2020, the Europaallee building complex was constructed on the former rail yard of the Sihlpost, located west of the Zürich HB station building. The site features several shops, restaurants and offices. The Europaallee is connected with the district north of the railway tracks via the (), which opened in 2021, and with the station&#x27;s platforms via the western underpass.

=== Station bells, clock and lights ===
There are station bells above the rear exit of the large hall. In the 1847 station, bells rang before each departure of the &quot;Spanisch-Brötli-Bahn&quot;. The &quot;signal order&quot; prescribed as follows: &quot;10 minutes before the departure of a train, one [bell]; 5 minutes before the same, two [bells]; and immediately prior to departure, three bells&quot;. For the 1871 renovations, the architect Jakob Friedrich Wanner gave the station clock the place of honour in the portal above the main entrance, and the bells were placed in a small tower in the east facade.

On 12 September 2006, to commemorate the station&#x27;s 150th anniversary, the ETH Zürich installed the &quot;NOVA&quot;, a three-dimensional, bivalent display, which consists of 25,000 individually addressable light balls. It represents a play of light of several colours, but can also represent cinematic sequences. It is expected to remain hanging in the station until further notice.

== Operation ==
Zürich HB is served by more than 2,900 trains daily. In 2018, it had an average of 471,300 passengers each working day. The station is busy at all times, with trains running from 05:00 until 01:00 during the week. From Friday night to Sunday morning, trains run also all night as part of the &quot;ZVV Nachtnetz&quot; (nighttime network).

=== Tracks ===
The station has four distinct groups of tracks (), giving a total of 26 tracks:

* Tracks 3–18 are terminal tracks located at ground level, served by two side platforms and seven island platforms. These are used by long-distance trains from throughout Switzerland, and by international trains such as the EuroCity, Cisalpino, InterCityExpress and TGV. A few S-Bahn services (, , , ) also depart from these tracks.
* Tracks 21 and 22 are underground terminal tracks, served by a single island platform, and located on the southern side of the station. This platform is known as and is used by SZU operated S-Bahn services and , heading south and west towards Sihl valley and Uetliberg, respectively.
* Tracks 31–34 (&quot;Löwenstrasse&quot; station) are underground through tracks, served by a pair of island platforms, and located just to the north of tracks 21 and 22. These are used by long-distance trains and S-Bahn services and running to and from Oerlikon station via the Weinberg Tunnel. 
* Tracks 41–44 (&quot;Museumstrasse&quot; station) are underground through tracks, served by a pair of island platforms, and located on the northern side of the station. These are used by S-Bahn trains running via the Hirschengraben Tunnel and Zürich Stadelhofen station (services , , , , , , , , , , ).

=== S-Bahn services ===

Since the commissioning of the Zürich S-Bahn in May 1990, the Hauptbahnhof has been the central node of the Zürich S-Bahn &quot;Stammnetz&quot; (core network). As such, it is the nodal point where S-Bahn lines S2, S3, S5, S6, S7, S8, S9, S12, S14, S15, S16, S19, S20, S21, S24 and S25, the Sihltal Zürich Uetliberg Bahn (S4 and S10) and Zürich trams interconnect.

During weekends, there are seven nighttime S-Bahn services (SN1, SN4, SN5, SN6, SN7, SN8, SN9) calling at the Hauptbahnhof, offered by ZVV:

* : hourly service between and .
* : hourly service to .
* : hourly service between and .
* : hourly service between and .
* : hourly service between and .
* : hourly service between and .
* : hourly service between and .

=== Urban public transport ===
Around the station, the trams and trolleybuses of the Verkehrsbetriebe Zürich (VBZ) provide local public transport services. The Hauptbahnhof is one of the most important nodes of the Zürich tramway network.

The main station is accessible from five tram and bus stops:
*Sihlquai|HB to the north next to exit &quot;Sihlquai&quot; via the most western underpass, tram lines , , and ;
*Bahnhofquai|HB to the east via the main hall, tram lines , , , , and trolleybus ;
*Bahnhofplatz|HB to the south via traverse hall, main hall, or underground ShopVille, tram lines , , , and trolleybus ;
*Bahnhofstrasse|HB just south of &quot;Bahnhofplatz&quot; via main hall or underground ShopVille, tram lines , , , and ;
*Sihlpost|HB 300m to the south-west from exit &quot;Europaallee&quot; via the most western underpass, tram lines , and trolleybus .

=== Train operations ===
Due to its central location in Switzerland and in Europe, the station was quickly able to establish itself as an important railway junction. Most trains running through several European countries operated through Switzerland. In addition, a majority of Swiss mainline trains travelled to or from Zürich. For the clock-face timetable introduced to Switzerland in 1982, Zürich is the &quot;pacemaker&quot;. Delays and other disruptions at Zürich Hauptbahnhof sometimes affect the whole of Switzerland.

Long-distance trains meet in Zürich on the hour and half-hour, and thus connect with each other. In cases of delays, connecting trains wait a maximum of 3 minutes beyond the scheduled departure time, except for some international trains and the late night trains. S-Bahn services do not wait for late connecting trains, but the long-distance trains - contrary to popular opinion - usually wait for delayed S-Bahn trains (also for a maximum of 3 minutes).

=== Flood risk ===
The Sihl passes through the station in a tunnel, with platforms above and below the river, and public circulation areas to either side. The tunnel comprises 5 culverts with a length of and a clear opening of by each. This limits the river&#x27;s flow capacity, raising concerns about the capacity of the tunnel to deal with extreme flood events. Additionally, during the building of the new Löwenstrasse platforms, it was necessary to temporarily close part of this tunnel, thus reducing the capacity even further.

Some upstream of the station lies the Sihlsee, Switzerland&#x27;s largest artificial lake, which is impounded by a high dam. Studies showed that a failure of this dam could lead to an high flood wave reaching the Hauptbahnhof within 2 hours. This threat has led the City of Zürich to develop, publish and test evacuation plans for the affected areas of the city, and especially the station area.

===Customs===
Zurich main station is, for customs purposes, a border station for passengers arriving from Germany. As such, customs checks may be performed in the station by Swiss customs officials. Systematic passport controls were abolished, however, when Switzerland joined the Schengen Area in 2008.

<text>Del&#x27;s is a brand of frozen lemonade typically found in Rhode Island and southeastern Massachusetts during the summer months. Del&#x27;s lemonade is available in 20 states. Frozen lemonade is a kind of slush. It is made from water, concentrate, and real lemons in an ice cream machine. In Rhode Island and southeastern Massachusetts &quot;Del&#x27;s&quot; is synonymous with frozen lemonade.

==History==
Del&#x27;s was founded by Angelo DeLucia, who originally received the recipe for lemonade from his father, Franco DeLucia, who brought the recipe to the United States from Italy. Angelo then developed a machine to dispense their product.

The first Del&#x27;s stand was a small, pushable cart in Cranston, Rhode Island, in 1948. Soon afterwards, Angelo started using &quot;Del&#x27;s Trucks&quot; to serve the beverage anywhere in the state. The company still uses the trucks today in addition to its storefront locations.

In 1993, the Rhode Island legislature made an attempt to select an official state beverage. Del&#x27;s lemonade and coffee milk were chosen as &quot;finalists&quot;; however, coffee milk was eventually chosen as the official state beverage.

The 2011 television movie &quot;Lemonade Mouth&quot;, a Disney Channel Original Movie adapted from the book of the same name by Massachusetts author Mark Peter Hughes, prominently features &quot;Mel&#x27;s Frozen Lemonade&quot;, which the author has indicated is a parody of Del&#x27;s.

Angelo DeLucia died of prostate cancer on September 6, 2007.

==Products==
There are seven main flavors of the popular drink: lemon, watermelon, peach-mango, blueberry, cherry, grapefruit, and blood orange. There are occasionally extra seasonal flavors, like tangerine. Coffee was once a flavor but has not appeared on the menu for many years. Del&#x27;s also sells other various products such as pretzel sticks, candy, and popcorn as well as many different Del&#x27;s branded products in its gift shop located at its corporate office location, as well as online.

In partnership with Del&#x27;s, the Narragansett Brewing Company produces a shandy called Del&#x27;s Shandy.

==Distribution==
Del&#x27;s operates franchises selling their prepared product, with 20 locations in Rhode Island, the most of any state, as well as locations throughout the US, and even internationally. Trucks selling the product are often seen at popular beach locations in summer months. The Del&#x27;s &quot;take-home&quot; mix and non-frozen variety of lemonade can be found in grocery stores throughout the world.

<text>Kolberg is a 1945 Nazi propaganda historical film written and directed by Veit Harlan. One of the last films of the Third Reich, it was intended to bolster the will of the German population to resist the Allies.

Harlan and Alfred Braun, who also worked on the screenplay, based the film on the autobiography of , mayor of Kolberg in Pomerania, and on Paul Heyse&#x27;s later play adapted from the book. (Joseph Goebbels participated in writing the screenplay but was not credited. He insisted that a romantic interest be added; this is the figure of Maria.)

The film recounts the defence of the besieged fortress town of Kolberg against French troops between April and July 1807, during the Napoleonic Wars. In fact, the city&#x27;s defence, led by then-Lieutenant Colonel August von Gneisenau, held out until the war was ended by the Treaty of Tilsit. But the film portrays the French abandoning the siege.

==Plot==
The film begins in 1813 after the phase of the Napoleonic Wars known in German as the &quot;Befreiungskriege&quot; (Wars of Liberation). The opening scenes show Prussian Landwehr and volunteers marching in the streets of Breslau through enthusiastic crowds. King Frederick William III of Prussia and Count August von Gneisenau discuss recent events, with Gneisenau saying that the successful defence of Kolberg under siege taught the importance of citizen armies.

After an admonition that kings who cannot lead must abdicate, the scene switches to Vienna in 1806. It shows the abdication of the last Holy Roman Emperor, Francis II of Austria. In the film, the character Gneisenau describes him as &quot;an Emperor who abandoned the German people in their hour of need&quot;.

The film moves to Kolberg in 1806, where inhabitants are shown enjoying ordinary life. The town&#x27;s leaders, Mayor Nettelbeck chief among them, discuss Napoleon&#x27;s announcements and what it will mean to them. Some see the French victories as a good thing; some wonder whether to leave. Nettelbeck alone is set on resisting the French.

Nettelbeck struggles to defend his city against others&#x27; cowardice and lethargy, and the old-fashioned ideas of the garrison commander. Nettelbeck creates a citizen militia although opposed by the regular Prussian Army. He has supplies collected and strongly opposes any idea of surrender to the French.

Finally, having been threatened with execution by the military, and convinced that Kolberg can be saved only if a great leader can be found, Nettelbeck sends Maria, a farmer&#x27;s innocent daughter the dangerous journey to Königsberg, whither the Court of Prussia has retreated. She is to meet with the King and with Queen Louise. Napoleon had described the Queen as &quot;the only man in Prussia&quot;. Maria meets with the Queen alone and persuades her to order Gneisenau to Kolberg.

He confronts Nettelbeck, and emerges as the top leader. But the two work together with the army and the citizens to save the city from the French. After Kolberg is saved when the French retreat (this is not historically true), the film returns to 1813 after the Convention of Tauroggen. Napoleon had been defeated in Russia, and Prussian leaders wonder whether it is time to confront him. Gneisenau convinces Frederick William to do so; he writes the proclamation &quot;An Mein Volk&quot; (&quot;To my People&quot;) announcing the Wars of Liberation.

==Production==
Joseph Goebbels began planning for &quot;Kolberg&quot; in 1941, and the film entered production in 1943. He hired Veit Harlan, the director of &quot;Jud Süß&quot;, to make the film on 1 June 1943. It was made in Agfacolor and cost , not as is often stated.

Principal cinematography took place from 22 October 1943 to August 1944. The exteriors were shot in and around the cities of Kolberg, Königsberg, Treptow, Berlin, Seeburg, and Neustettin. Harlan said that the &quot;law of madness&quot; applied during the film&#x27;s production, and that Adolf Hitler and Goebbels believed the film &quot;could be more useful to them than even a military miracle, because they no longer believed in victory in any rational way&quot;. Goebbels worked on the film as an uncredited screenwriter.

Kristina Söderbaum, the director&#x27;s wife, was cast as Maria, a farmer&#x27;s daughter and one of the lead roles in the film.

Harlan claimed that 10,000 uniforms were made for the film, and that 6,000 horses and 187,000 soldiers were used for it. Harlan stated that he was given 4,000 sailors for a scene of a French attack across flooded fields after appealing the Kriegsmarine&#x27;s rejection of his demand. The film&#x27;s extras amounted to perhaps 5,000 soldiers; hundreds of Kolberg people participated for a daily fee of . The number of extras is commonly exaggerated at 187,000, and claims of entire divisions of troops taking part are completely false.

Goebbels sent a memorandum from script supervisor Hans Hinkel requesting changes on 6 December 1944. These demands included the cutting of &quot;all the mass battle and street scenes&quot; in favor of &quot;scenes featuring the familiar characters&quot;, a scene of a woman giving birth, and &quot;the hysterical outburst of the brother Klaus&quot;. One-fourth of the film&#x27;s budget was spent on scenes cut by Goebbels. 100 railroad cars were used to transport salt to be used as snow in the film.

==Release==
The film was approved by the censors on 26 January 1945, and premiered for German forces in the defense zone in occupied La Rochelle, France on 30 January. The city was liberated by Allied forces two months later.

It opened in a temporary cinema (U.T. Alexanderplatz) and at Tauentzien-Palast in Berlin. It ran under constant threat of air raids until the fall of Berlin to Soviet forces in May 1945. Simultaneously with the opening in Berlin, it was shown to the crew of the naval base at La Rochelle at the Théâtre de la Ville. It was also screened in the Reich Chancellery after the broadcast of Hitler&#x27;s last radio address on 30 January. One of the last films of the Third Reich, it never went into general release.

The city of Kolberg was declared a &quot;Festung&quot; (&quot;fortress town&quot;) as Soviet forces neared it on 24 February 1945. Within a month of the film&#x27;s opening Kolberg was under full siege (sometimes called the &quot;Second Siege&quot; or &quot;Second Battle&quot; of Kolberg), with around 70,000 trapped German civilians and military personnel. House-to-house fighting caused devastation. Kolberg fell to Soviet and Polish forces on 18 March 1945. Many civilians escaped by sea. The Soviet Union permanently expelled all who survived the siege, along with all Germans in east Pomerania. The ruined city of Kolberg became part of the postwar socialist republic of Poland. The city is now known as Kołobrzeg.

After World War II the film was released in Argentina as &quot;Burning Hearts&quot; and in Switzerland as &quot;The Renunciation&quot;. It was theatrically released by Atlas Films in West Germany in 1966.

<text>The Emirates Office Tower, is a 54-floor office building along Sheikh Zayed Road in the city of Dubai, United Arab Emirates. Connected with the 56-floor Jumeirah Emirates Towers Hotel by a retail boulevard, the two towers form what is commonly referred to as the Emirates Towers complex. The tower has a total structural height of and roof height of , making it the 55th-tallest building in the world. The Emirates Office Tower One is taller than the neighbouring Jumeirah Emirates Towers Hotel, but has two fewer floors. Construction of the building was completed on 3 November 1999.

== Design and Style ==

The Emirates Office Tower is located in the financial centre of Dubai. The Emirates Towers complex designed by NORR represents modern business age architecture. Two equilateral triangles are one of their kind in Dubai. The tower consists of three large core walls. The walls support the load transferred at four levels by large steel trusses, which are connected to the cores with the aid of post tensioning and shear stud connection. A curved wall rising almost the whole height of one face of the triangular building provides a view of the city.

The Emirates Office Tower building is surrounded by clad in silver aluminium panels, silver and copper reflective glass. Flanking each tower at the base is a low curvilinear structure, that houses parking and service elements. Both towers rise from a terraced podium featuring a boutique retail mall, restaurants, and cafes with leasable retail area of , at the three storey base. Landscaping is an integral feature of the design with undulating land forms, water features, and a variety of plants creating a unique development in downtown Dubai. Located along the Sheikh Zayed road the buildings are one of the most distinctive pairs of skyscrapers.

<doc id="838126" wikidata="Q6939929" url="?curid=838126" title="Musa Hitam">
<text>Tun Musa bin Hitam (Jawi: موسى بن هيتم; born 18 April 1934) is a Malaysian retired politician who served as the Deputy Prime Minister of Malaysia from 1981 to 1986, serving under Mahathir Mohamad. He was the chairman of Sime Darby Berhad.

==Early life and education==
Musa bin Hitam was born on 18 April 1934 in Johor Bahru, British Malaya, to a Malay father of Javanese descent and a mother of Chinese descent, who was adopted by and grew up in a Malay household at the age of five.

Musa continued his studies at the English College Johore Bahru. He received his bachelor&#x27;s degree from the University of Malaya and his master&#x27;s degree from the University of Sussex. He has since been awarded with various honours, including an Honorary Doctorate from the University of Sussex and an Honorary Doctorate from Ohio University (in 1980). Musa has held various posts at the international level at various times. These included being Chairman of the Commonwealth Parliamentary Association, Member of the Board of UNESCO, Leader of the Commonwealth Observer Delegation to the Malawi general elections and Member of the Commonwealth Ministers Delegations to Nigeria, Pakistan, Fiji and Gambia.

==Political career==
In the 1960s, Musa was briefly served as Acting Secretary-General of UMNO. He was later expelled from the party in the wake of the 13 May racial rioting for insubordination to Prime Minister and UMNO President Tunku Abdul Rahman. During his political exile, he obtained his Master&#x27;s from the University of Sussex.

In 1971, he was readmitted to UMNO under the Tunku&#x27;s successor, Abdul Razak Hussein. He rose quickly, becoming Deputy Whip of the Alliance coalition in Parliament, and was elected as a member of the UMNO Supreme Council. He was elected as a UMNO Vice-President in 1978.

When Mahathir Mohamad became Prime Minister of Malaysia, he announced that the election for the Deputy Presidency of UMNO—and by extension, the position of Deputy Prime Minister—would be open, stating that he would not endorse any candidate. Musa Hitam faced Tengku Razaleigh Hamzah in 1981 the party election. Eventually, Musa won the election with 722 votes to Razaleigh&#x27;s 517 votes, becoming the new Deputy President and Deputy Prime Minister. Razaleigh blamed himself for taking &quot;a rather passive stance&quot; and not having a campaign strategy.

==Government positions==
Before becoming Malaysia&#x27;s fifth Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of Home Affairs in 1981–1986, Musa held a number of key government posts, including
* Chairman of the Federal Land Development Authority (FELDA)
* Deputy Minister of Trade &amp; Industry (1970–1974)
* Minister of Primary Industries (1974–1978); and
* Minister of Education (1978–1981).
* Deputy Prime Minister (1981–1987)
In September 1981, Musa Hitam served as Acting Prime Minister when Mahathir Mohamad went on a two-week vacation with his family to Spain and Portugal.

Musa retired and was replaced by Ghafar Baba as Deputy Prime Minister in 1986.

==Post-political career==
In 1987, Tengku Razaleigh challenged Mahathir Mohamad for the presidency of UMNO. Musa Hitam, who was then having a growing rift with Mahathir, resigned as Deputy Prime Minister, citing irreconcilable differences with Mahathir. He then joined Razaleigh&#x27;s Team B as UMNO deputy president candidate. In the election, Dr. Mahathir and his Team A managed to retain his position and power over the party. However, UMNO was split into two separate entities as Tengku Razaleigh was left unsatisfied with the result. The split forced the Malaysian court to declare UMNO as illegal. Shortly after the court ruling, Dr. Mahathir reestablished UMNO as UMNO Baru (New UMNO), though the new UMNO was badly weakened. Tengku Razaleigh at the same time went on his own path and found a new political party called Semangat 46 in 1989. The number 46 refers to the year UMNO was founded. Musa, however, decided to retire from politics and has not joined the fray since.

Between 1990 and 1991, he was Malaysia&#x27;s Special Envoy to the United Nations, and since 1995 he has been the Prime Minister&#x27;s Special Envoy to the Commonwealth Ministerial Action Group (CMAG). Tan Sri Musa also led the Malaysian delegation to the UN Commission on Human Rights from 1993 to 1998 and was elected Chairman of the 52nd Session of the Commission in 1995.

<text>85 Sky Tower (), formerly known as the T &amp; C Tower or Tuntex Sky Tower, is an 85-story skyscraper in Lingya District, Kaohsiung, Taiwan. The structure is high. An antenna increases the pinnacle height to . Constructed from 1994 to 1997 by the now-defunct Tuntex Group, it is the tallest building in Kaohsiung, and the 2nd tallest in Taiwan after the Taipei 101.

As of 2023, the building is almost entirely unoccupied except for a few condominiums (some subleased as short-term rentals) and offices from the 12th to 35th floors. Many floors have not been used in decades, and their conditions have become dirty and run-down. When the building first opened, it once housed a department store, indoor amusement park, five-star hotel, observatory, steakhouse and disco, VIP club and spa, and other amenities.

The building was designed by C.Y. Lee &amp; Partners and Hellmuth, Obata &amp; Kassabaum, and has an unusual &#x27;prong&#x27; design with two separate 39-floor sections, which merge into a single central tower rising to a spire. This unique design leaves a substantial space below the central part of the tower. The design was inspired by the Chinese character Gāo () meaning tall, and also part of the city&#x27;s name. John W. Milton was Project Director on behalf of Turner International Inc. (New York), a subsidiary of Turner Construction.

There is no 44th floor in the building due to tetraphobia, so the 43rd floor connects directly to the 45th floor; the 57th floor, a mechanical floor, is numbered 57A. The pyramid shaped crown is the equivalent of three stories high and is hence marketed as 83–85 to arrive at a round number. There is no elevator access to floors above 80.

== Occupancy ==
Floor 34 and 35 are currently leased by Look Hotel Group (). The 85 Sky Tower Hotel (ceased operations) () occupies floors 37 to 85, and it owns the observation deck. Office space and studio apartments occupy each side of the lower floors.

== Atrium ==
There is an Atrium that extends from Level 45&#x27;s Shimmer Ballroom (as of 2015 the entire floor is dark and unoccupied) to Level 83; it is one of the highest continuous atriums in the world.

<doc id="838137" wikidata="Q270117" url="?curid=838137" title="Lycurgus (son of Dryas)">
<text>In Greek mythology, Lycurgus (/laɪˈkɜːrɡəs/; Ancient Greek: Λυκοῦργος &quot;Lykoûrgos&quot;, Ancient Greek: [lykôrɡos]; also Lykurgos, Lykourgos) was the king of the Edoni in Thrace, son of Dryas, the &quot;oak&quot;, and father of a son whose name was also Dryas. 

== Mythology ==
Lycurgus banned the cult of Dionysus. When Lycurgus heard that Dionysus was in his kingdom, he imprisoned Dionysus&#x27;s followers, the Maenads, or &quot;chased the[m] through the holy hills of Nysa, and the sacred implements dropped to the ground from the hands of one and all, as [he] struck them down with his ox-goad&quot;.

The compiler of &quot;Bibliotheke&quot; (3.5.1) says that as punishment, especially for his treatment for Ambrosia, Dionysus&#x27; nursemaid; the god drove Lycurgus insane. In his madness, Lycurgus mistook his son for a mature trunk of ivy, which is holy to Dionysus, and killed him, pruning away his nose and ears, fingers and toes. Consequently, the land of Thrace dried up in horror. Dionysus decreed that the land would stay dry and barren as long as Lycurgus was left unpunished for his injustice, so his people bound him and flung him to man-eating horses on Mount Pangaeüs. However, another version of the tale, transmitted in Servius&#x27;s commentary on &quot;Aeneid&quot; 3.14, Porphyrio&#x27;s commentary on Horace&#x27;s &quot;Ode&quot; 2.19, and Hyginus in his &quot;Fabulae&quot; 132, records that Lycurgus cut off his own foot when he meant to cut down a vine of ivy. With Lycurgus dead, Dionysus lifted the curse. Also according to Hyginus, Lycurgus tried to rape his mother after imbibing wine. When he discovered what he had done, he attempted to cut down the grapevines, believing the wine to be a bad medicine. Dionysus drove him mad as a punishment, causing him to kill both his wife and his son, and threw him to the panthers on Mount Rhodope.

Diodorus Siculus relates that, centuries before the Trojan war, King Lycurgus of Thrace exiled one of his commanders, Mopsus, along with Sipylus the Scythian. Sometime later, when the Libyan Amazons invaded Thrace, Mopsus and Sipylus came to the rescue by defeating them in a pitched battle, in which their queen Myrine was slain; the Thracians then pursued the surviving Amazons all the way to Libya.

In some versions the story of Lycurgus and his punishment by Dionysus is placed in Arabia rather than in Thrace. The tragedian Aeschylus, in a lost play, depicted Lycurgus as a beer-drinker and hence a natural opponent of the wine god. There is a further reference to Lycurgus in Sophocles&#x27; &quot;Antigone&quot; in the Chorus&#x27;s ode after Antigone is taken away (960 in the Greek text).

In Homer&#x27;s &quot;Iliad&quot;, an older source than Aeschylus, Lycurgus&#x27;s punishment for his disrespect towards the gods, particularly Dionysus, is blindness inflicted by Zeus followed not long after by death.

According to Sophocles, the frenzied Lycurgus mocked at Dionysus and as punishment was shut in &quot;a prison of stone&quot; until his madness went away.

The author of the &quot;Geoponica&quot; states that Dionysus, fleeing from Lycurgus, tied him up with vines and dove into the sea; Lycurgus shed a tear then, which transformed into cabbage. This was supposedly why grapevines and cabbages had a mutual dislike toward one another, and could not thrive together, as vines withered in the fields whenever a cabbage was growing nearby.

<text>Lycurgus (; ) was the legendary lawgiver of Sparta, credited with the formation of its (), involving political, economic, and social reforms to produce a military-oriented Spartan society in accordance with the Delphic oracle. The Spartans in the historical period honoured him as a god.

As a historical figure, almost nothing is known for certain about him, including when he lived and what he did in life. The stories of him place him at multiple times. Nor is it clear when the political reforms attributed to him, called the Great Rhetra, occurred. Ancient dates range from – putting aside the implausibly early Xenophonic 11th century BC – the early ninth century () to as late as early eighth century (). There remains no consensus as to when he lived; some modern scholars deny that he existed at all.

The reforms at various times attributed to him touch all aspects of Spartan society. They included the creation of the Spartan constitution (in most traditions after the dual monarchy), the imposition of the Spartan mess halls called syssitia, the redistribution of land to each citizen by head, Spartan austerity and frugality, and Sparta&#x27;s unique wedding and funerary customs. None of these reforms can be concretely attributed to Lycurgus. Most of the reforms likely date to the late sixth century BC (shortly before 500 BC), postdating his supposed life by centuries; some of the reforms, such as for the redistribution of land, are fictitious.

The extent of the Lycurgan myth emerges from Sparta&#x27;s self-justification, seeking to endow its customs with timeless and divinely sanctioned antiquity. That antiquity was also malleable, reinvented at various times to justify the new as a return to Lycurgus&#x27; ideal society: his land reforms, for example, are attested only after the reformist Spartan monarchs Agis IV and Cleomenes III who sought to redistribute Sparta&#x27;s land. The reforms attributed to Lycurgus, however, have been praised by ancients and moderns alike, seeing at various times different morals projected on a figure of which so little concrete can be known.

== Biography ==

=== Historicity and chronology ===

A multitude of ancient sources mention Lycurgus; it is, however, troubling inasmuch as those accounts evolved according to then-contemporary political priorities and that they are profoundly inconsistent. The oldest is that of Herodotus, who wrote in the latter half of the fifth century BC. His account is likely based on oral accounts from both Spartans and non-Spartans in Greece. The two royal dynasties of Sparta, the Agiads and Eurypontids, both claimed Lycurgus in their ancestries.

However, Lycurgus does not feature in the earliest preserved Spartan source – the poet Tyrtaeus – which has led many historians today to doubt his historicity: for example, Massimo Nafissi in &quot;A companion to Sparta&quot; writes he is &quot;probably mythical&quot;. Others have attempted to glean from the myths that survive some kernel of truth. But most historians &quot;would subscribe to the stark judgement of Antony Andrewes: &#x27;if there was a real Lycurgus, we know nothing of him.

There is no consensus as to when a historical Lycurgus lived, neither today or in the ancient world (Plutarch, in his &quot;Life of Lycurgus&quot;, in fact makes this remark in the opening paragraph). Most attempts to date his life are based on when the Great Rhetra, which promulgated Lycurgus&#x27; reforms, occurred. The most accepted date in the ancient world was that based on the genealogy of Ephorus and the chronology of Eratosthenes, which dated the to 118 years after the reign of one of Sparta&#x27;s founding kings, Procles, which corresponds to . Alternatively, an excursus in the 5th century BC Greek historian Thucydides&#x27; &quot;Archaeology&quot; indicates that the reforms were instituted some four hundred years prior to the end of the Peloponnesian war, placing them to 804 or 821 BC. The 4th century BC Greek general Xenophon, on the other hand, claimed that he was also responsible for the creation of the Lacedaemonian dual monarchy, placing him during the reign of the Heraclid kings Eurysthenes and Procles, dated to . Modern scholars generally date the Great Rhetra to before the First Messenian War, placing it prior to 736 BC. Little consensus exists for any more specificity. Nor should Lycurgus necessarily be credited with, and therefore dated to, the rhetra: it may have been a charter created some time in the seventh century to justify and ennoble with antiquity Sparta&#x27;s institutions, especially after Sparta&#x27;s emergence as the most powerful state in Greece.

One artefact, the Disc of Iphitos, also allegedly documents Lycurgus&#x27; involvement with the formation of the Olympic Games and would therefore place him , per the philosopher Aristotle. The disc, however, is likely a forgery from the fourth century BC. The ancients had two solutions for this lack of chronological clarity: the historian Timaeus posited two Lycurguses: one who did the reforms and a later one with the same name who was present at the first Olympics. Eratosthenes instead posited the disc reflected informal Olympics held before 776 BC.

The tradition in Sparta of Lycurgus&#x27; existence dates to some time between the archaic age and the fifth century. Inasmuch as no Lycurgus is mentioned in Tyrtaeus, it is likely that the legend dates to shortly after Tyrtaeus&#x27; time, and therefore the late seventh or early sixth century. It likely emerged from Spartan success in that period and a desire to explain it. His legend was also constantly reworked and expanded through the course of the classical Greek period by securing for Spartans in their times divine sanction and greater legitimacy for actions which they claimed to be a return to Lycurgus&#x27; laws.

=== Life ===


In the earlier legends of Lycurgus, namely in the accounts of the Great Rhetra, Lycurgus is not credited with a radical reorganisation of Spartan life or with the institution of the ephorate. These early oral traditions – contra the written accounts – are &quot;far from uniform&quot;. The earliest surviving &quot;written&quot; account on Lycurgus is in Herodotus, placing him as the guardian and regent of the early Argiad king Leobotes. Later accounts of Lycurgus&#x27; activities associate him with the later-more-influential Eurypontid dynasty instead, specifically as regent of Charilaus; the disputes indicate that the two royal houses by the historical period attempted to associate themselves by blood with the figure. 

Herodotus provides two accounts for how the laws which Lycurgus enacted came to him: in the first version, Lycurgus receives those laws from Apollo through the Pythia at Delphi; in the second, based on Sparta&#x27;s own traditions, Lycurgus bases the reforms off of existing laws in Crete. Spartan and Cretan institutions did indeed have common characteristics, but, though some direct borrowing may have occurred, such similarities are in general more likely to be because of the common Dorian inheritance of Sparta and Crete rather than because some individual such as Lycurgus imported Cretan customs to Sparta. Some versions of the story say that Lycurgus subsequently traveled as far as Egypt, Spain, and India. In the narrative of Lycurgus&#x27; reforms in Herodotus, Lycurgus is supposed to have created much of the Spartan constitution, including the gerousia and the ephorate (respectively, the Spartan council of elders and annually-elected overseeing magistrates). He also is supposed to have reorganised Spartan military life and instituted the syssitia (the mess halls to which each Spartan belonged). In Xenophon&#x27;s telling, the legend of Lycurgus expanded even further, ascribing to him not only reforms but also the creation of the Lacedaemonian dual monarchy and state as well.

The description of Lycurgus as a regent or guardian who establishes the laws characterises him as a selfless figure who places the good of his king and community before his own. To that end there are two main traditions relating to his regency. The first, in Herodotus, is that he undertakes the regency until his ward came of age. The second is that he resigns, to protect his ward, amid rumours that he wishes to supplant the ward as king. Plutarch&#x27;s version of the story includes the ward&#x27;s mother seeking Lycurgus&#x27; hand in marriage to facilitate his accession. In this version, Lycurgus leaves to prevent himself from being used as a pawn in politics against his nephew.

The tradition where Lycurgus continues in the regency has little difficulty in placing him in a position to promulgate his laws. But the latter tradition where he leaves the city requires him to be recalled. In Aristotle&#x27;s version, recounted by Plutarch, Lycurgus leads his followers into the city and occupies the agora to impose his laws; backed by Apolline divine approval, he forces the tyrannical Charilaus to accede to them and institutes the gerousia. Xenophon instead has Lycurgus forging an alliance with the most powerful non-royal citizens and forcing the laws through. Plutarch&#x27;s narrative presented in his own voice instead consolidates prior disparate stories into a general upsurge of support from the kings, the people, and the aristocracy.

In Plutarch&#x27;s narrative, Lycurgus&#x27; laws cause backlash among the wealthy, who attempt to have him stoned. After he flees to the temple of Athena Chalcioecus and has one of his eyes put out by an adolescent, his opponents back down and he forgives the adolescent. The extent to which this story of revolution and conflict with the wealthy is driven by – or a retrojection from – the experiences of the reformist Spartan kings Agis IV and Cleomenes III is unclear; the two later Spartan kings used the Lycurgan legend to justify their redistributive policies (and violent means) as a return to Lycurgus&#x27; &quot;true&quot; Spartan traditions, deviations from which explained all problems of latter-day Sparta. Finally, in Plutarch&#x27;s version, after Lycurgus&#x27; recall to Sparta to institute new laws, he has the community swear not to change the laws until he returns from Delphi. Upon reaching Delphi he dies so to enshrine the laws forever.

== Attributed reforms ==

Lycurgus&#x27; laws are supposed to have touched the whole of Spartan society. At various times, the Spartans attributed every one of their institutions to him, except the institution of the dual monarchy. Because the Spartans attributed all manner of laws and customs to him, it is impossible to determine which laws (if any) are his in actuality. However, it is clear today, from comparisons with other archaic Greek states, that Spartan institutions such as men&#x27;s dining halls, organisation of age cohorts, and the use of iron money were not entirely out of the norm and had previously existed in other Greek cities: what made them distinctive was for how long they had been preserved at Sparta.

The character of many of the economic and social reforms attributed to Lycurgus was allegedly to ensure that citizens competed with each other only in merit rather than in wealth. However, many of the social reforms which are attributed to Lycurgus postdate him by centuries, occurring between 600–500 BC after various Spartan conquest of Messenia and Cynuria made landholdings available for the Spartan citizens. The economic reforms, which are supposed to have made Spartan citizens equal, never happened and were invented to legitimise redistributive policies in the Hellenistic period.

=== Political and military ===
Lycurgus&#x27; political reforms were supposedly promulgated in a Great Rhetra that he received from the Pythia. It, however, is not genuine and contains anachronistic contents. Regardless, Plutarch records it as having included provisions related to Sparta&#x27;s religious and political practices:

Plutarch states that the provision that the elders and kings could set aside decisions of the apella, called the &quot;rider&quot;, was a later addition. However, the grammatical construction of preserved rhetra is consistent with it being part of the original text, a view taken by Massimo Nafissi in &quot;Companion to archaic Greece&quot;, believing that the idea that the set-aside provision was later inserted was itself a fabrication of the fourth century BC.

Lycurgus is supposed also to have established the Spartan mess halls called or . Such halls were public, where all citizen men were required to eat dinner. Citizens were required to contribute to the mess hall&#x27;s pantries with a substantial amount of food, wine, and money; failure or inability to do so would entail loss of citizenship. A relatively old tradition, predating the Hellenistic Spartan reformers Agis IV and Cleomenes III as well as likely Herodotus, claimed that Lycurgus&#x27; imposition of the mess halls created a citizen body of some 9,000 men. Each of these mess halls also played a role in military organisation: each likely had 15 men with three mess halls forming a &quot;sworn band&quot;; but after the were merged into the Spartan army, each mess hall likely formed its own band. Such messes were likely preceded in the seventh century BC poet Alcman&#x27;s time with (private men&#x27;s eating clubs). They became the classical after sumptuary restrictions, compulsory contributions from poorer citizens who previously abstained, and intermixture of rich and poor shortly before 500 BC.

The silence of the rhetra, a text meant to describe and legitimise the Spartan political system of the seventh century, with regard to Sparta&#x27;s ephors suggests that the ephorate was a product of a later reform at Sparta and was not Lycurgan – Herodotus and Plutarch – in origin. In fact, archaeological discoveries at Sparta – showing the decline of Spartan art expressed on vases as well as a sudden expansion of agricultural labour in the mid-sixth century BC – suggest that much of the communitarian reforms attributed to Lycurgus may date to that time.

=== Economic ===

One of the illusions of the Spartan mirage was the illusion that Spartan citizens were economically equal: that no citizen owned more land than another. There is, however, no evidence of equal land ownership at Sparta, with exception of Cleomenes&#x27; five-year regime.

Land inequality increased through Spartan history, mediated by conquests abroad which allowed poorer citizens to retain a reasonable standard of living. When conquests ended after 550 BC, the poorer citizens were, over time, removed from the citizen rolls, for inability to pay dues to the syssitia. Demands for redistribution, heard by the reformist Spartan monarchs Agis IV and Cleomenes III, led to the creation of a myth that Lycurgus redistributed the land of Laconia and Messenia equally among the homoioi with the helots as bound tenants. The consensus among scholars is that this never happened. The seventh century Spartan poet, Tyrtaeus, already opposed land distribution in the poem &quot;Eunomia&quot;, attesting to land inequality at the earliest times.

Lycurgus is also supposed to have ensured the austere lifestyle of the Spartans by banning the use of gold and silver coins, requiring a currency made of iron. Xenophon claimed that this meant acquisition of wealth became too bulky to hide; Plutarch believed that this was to make it impossible, or at least difficult, for Spartans to purchase luxury goods. Coinage came to Greece in the 550s BC; it is not possible that any law mentioning coins dates to the eighth century BC (or earlier), when Lycurgus is supposed to have lived. Nor is any ban on gold and silver mentioned in Herodotus. Usage of gold and silver at Sparta is implied by other reports that the kings were fined in drachma and talents as well as by Spartan state rewards and ransoms. Plutarch&#x27;s attempted to reconcile the evidence by depicting the Spartans allowing gold and silver for public use but retaining the allegedly Lycurgan restrictions on private use. Such a depiction, however, is not consistent with actions by Spartan generals during the Peloponnesian War. Other ancient authors were more equivocal, dating the alleged ban on precious metals to after Lycurgus and to different men.

Ancient authors claimed of the Spartans a general aversion to commerce, which was also attributed to Lycurgus, who was supposed to have &quot;forbade free men to touch anything to do with making money&quot;. This likely emerged from the fact that Spartan citizens, the spartiates or homoioi, were a leisurely class of land owners who looked down on manual labourers and craftsmen. Such a ban also likely emerged in the sixth century, since Spartan citizen sculptors are attested to prior to that time. The inequality of Spartan society also implies that trade must have occurred; the second dinner in the syssitia involved bread, meat, fish, and other produce which were bought or donated by wealthy Spartans. Plutarch, who claims Spartan did not dispute or talk about money, is also internally inconsistent when elsewhere notes Spartan commercial contracts and Sparta&#x27;s delegation of such matters to expert resolution.

Plutarch also claims that Lycurgus imposed sumptuary legislation, prohibiting foreign artisans from residing at Sparta and restricting the tools with which Spartan houses could be built, to encourage simplicity. Archaeological evidence of foreign wares postdates the eighth century, with a decline in imports met by local production by the sixth century. The alleged simplicity of Spartan dwellings evidently did not extend to their interiors; and Spartans were famous across Greece for the jewellery worn by Spartan women, their number of slaves and horses, and their dominance at the expensive sport of chariot racing at pan-Hellenic games. While most male Spartan citizens affected a generally consistent and relatively inexpensive form of dress at home, Spartans on campaign showed extreme wealth from the expense of their crimson dyes to the polish of their armour. However, while Xenophon claims this austere dress also came from Lycurgus, art from Laconia implies adoption after 500 BC, consistent with Thucydides claim that Spartans wore complex and luxurious clothing until &quot;not long ago&quot;.

=== Social ===
Lycurgus is also supposed to have instituted the Spartan practice of staged bride capture where the bride, rather than being processed to the groom&#x27;s home for a wedding ceremony with feast, was instead ritually seized by the groom, and the marriage consummated without feast. The seventh century Spartan poet Alcman makes no mention of such customs, and composed wedding hymns reflecting the more common Greek wedding processions; Spartan wedding customs therefore also postdate Lycurgus, emerging some time before 500 BC. The further claim in Plutarch&#x27;s &quot;Moralia&quot; that Lycurgus prohibited dowries altogether has no basis. Lycurgus is also said to have instituted a system of wife sharing as a pronatalist and eugenicist policy; if such wife sharing existed, it is likely a product of Spartan population decline in the fifth century BC.

Plutarch also credits Lycurgus with sumptuary laws on burials. Archaeological evidence broadly supports the notion that Spartans practiced uniform burial without grave goods, albeit with exceptions for generals and Olympic victors. However, Lycurgus is also said to have banned lamentations and allowed burials near temples. Burials near temples were common in archaic Greece before being prohibited by most cities; Sparta merely retained the practice. The earliest Spartan art and poems also still mention lamenting mourners, implying that such a ban likely postdates Lycurgus and was introduced ; moreover, any ban on grave goods must postdate a grave, also , containing pottery grave goods. Further claims that Lycurgus required the burial of fallen Spartan soldiers abroad are not compatible with archaeological evidence showing that the first certain mass grave for Spartan battlefield losses was at Plataea.

The education of Spartan boys in the , less anachronistically the &quot;paideia&quot;, was also attributed to an initiative of Lycurgus to equalise Spartan citizens socially, by raising them without outside family and clan loyalties. Though the story is rejected by Plutarch, Lycurgus is also said to have instituted the crypteia, a select group of young men tasked with clandestinely killing helots in the night. Both the and likely emerged some time during the seventh century alongside the institution of the ephorate. The education of Spartan women, mainly focusing on physical fitness, or, supposedly, physical fitness to produce healthy children for eugenic purposes, was similarly attributed to Lycurgus.

== Legacy ==

=== Ancient ===
In Spartan society, Lycurgus and his laws were received as the creator of the Spartan way of life. Xenophon&#x27;s pro-Spartan &quot;Spartan Constitution&quot; &quot;unreservedly regard[s Lycurgus] as the Spartan legislator &quot;par excellence&quot;, who arranged the Spartan way of life once and for all&quot;. For these achievements, which they viewed as having facilitated the emergence of Sparta as the most powerful state in Greece, Lycurgus was honoured with a hero cult, which may have developed slowly into the Roman imperial period into full godhood. His temple and sanctuary, according to Pausanias, included a grave for his son with the name &quot;Eukosmos&quot; (referring to good order) with the graves of the Spartan dual monarchy&#x27;s founders&#x27; wives nearby.

The idealisation of Sparta, called the &quot;Spartan mirage&quot;, also drove praise of Lycurgus in other Greek states. The tradition of a timeless legislator with his divinely-inspired (or at least sanctioned) laws gave Sparta&#x27;s constitution greater legitimacy while also making it inflexible. Even attempts to &quot;reform&quot; Spartan life during the Hellenistic period, by Spartan monarchs Agis IV and Cleomenes III, were viewed in their time as returning to Lycurgan tradition rather than an innovation. The stories of Lycurgus were constantly reinvented for each Spartan generation; the decline of Sparta through to Hellenistic times saw Lycurgus&#x27; praise extended to praise him for having creating an ideal Sparta, free from the moral and political decay of the real one.

Admiration of the customs of Sparta, supposed to be established by Lycurgus, survived – with a break during the second century when Sparta was part of the Achaean League – continuously into the Sparta of the Roman Empire. Aristotle, for example, praised the Lycurgan as a form of universal education especially in the way it supported the stability of the Spartan state. Into the Roman period, Sparta received privileged treatment from the Romans as in part a means to preserve Greek traditions to display to tourists: while this touristic Sparta at times veered toward the extreme, it also cultivated its Lycurgan inheritance by means of architecture, theatre, and retention of distinctive political institutions.

The Plutarchian comparison between the paired lives of Lycurgus and Numa (the early Roman lawgiver and king), for example, judged Lycurgus favourably compared to the Roman by emphasising Lycurgan education and pronatalism. Another argument for Lycurgan superiority was also that Sparta declined as it supposedly deviated from Lycurgus&#x27; settlements while Rome flourished as it similarly deviated from Numa&#x27;s ideals. In the end, for Plutarch, Lycurgus was seen as a more important political theorist than Plato and as one of the most famous, moral, and effective legislators of the Greek tradition.

=== Modern ===
The main elements of Lycurgus&#x27; legacy are through the laws attributed to him. In the modern world this took on a number of aspects: the stability of the Lacedaemonian state from Lycurgus&#x27; balanced constitution; universal male citizen conscription and contribution (via the ); economic freedom for citizens by their possession of sufficient land and helots to meet their needs; and austere politics for the common good. The republican views of Niccolò Machiavelli trended toward the Lycurgan &quot;mixed constitution&quot; but this was not necessarily a through-line in Renaissance European political thought. Other thinkers of the period hailed Lycurgan politics as building a stable polity dedicated to simplicity, unity, and the communal interest – attributing to the Spartans, not necessarily rightly, universal education and equality among citizens – while also noting the cruelty of the &quot;agoge&quot; and denigration of autonomy, especially in contrast to democratic Athens.

Charles Rollin, a French educator, produced an enduring and admiring conception of Lycurgus as having created the rule of law, the mixed constitution, equality, and universal education. The philosopher Jean-Jacques Rousseau, who derived most of his knowledge of Lycurgus from Plutarch&#x27;s biography, viewed the figure positively as standing for an austere civil morality acting for the collective good. This view of Lycurgus and Sparta saw him associate Lycurgus&#x27; reforms with the &quot;general will&quot;. Positive views of Sparta pervaded some articles in the but this was not shared by all authors. Diderot, the main editor of the , was more pessimistic, saying that Lycurgan laws &quot;created monks bearing arms&quot; while branding the system as a whole &quot;an atrocity&quot; and &quot;incompatible with a large... [or] commercial state&quot;. The branding of Lycurguan Sparta as a &quot;dismal monastery&quot; was widely, but not universally, shared among the philosophes. Similar negative views were expressed by the American founder John Adams who saw Lycurgus as having doomed his own people to poverty and futile militarism; however, he also praised the Lycurgan – as well as the Polybian – mixed constitution in &quot;Defense of the Constitutions&quot; as did James Madison in the &quot;Federalist Papers&quot; (number 63).

Nationalist views of Spartan society, which praised Spartan eugenicism and militarism became common in Germany in the later nineteenth century through to the Nazi regime. Such views, however, were not unanimous. The German classicist Karl Julius Beloch, for example, was one of the first to take a highly critical view of Sparta, suggesting that Lycurgus was a fiction and his Great Rhetra was a fabrication. In the aftermath of the First World War German nationalism embraced Sparta and Lycurgus, seeing it as a locus of heroism, physicality, racial purity, and struggle. Such themes complemented fascist and Nazi ideology, painting Sparta as a &quot;proto-National Socialist state&quot;. Defeat in the Second World War largely ended such hagiography.

<text>The Heinrich Hertz Tower () is a landmark radio telecommunication tower in the city of Hamburg, Germany.

Designed by architect Fritz Trautwein, in co-operation with civil engineers Jörg Schlaich, Rudolf Bergermann and Fritz Leonhardt, the tower was built between 1965–1968 for the former &quot;Deutsche Bundespost&quot; (German Federal Post and Telecommunications Agency, now &quot;s subsidiary&#x27;) near &quot;&quot; park. 

With an overall height of 279.2 m (916 ft) it is Hamburg&#x27;s tallest structure, consisting of a 204 m (670 ft) steel-reinforced concrete lower section topped by a 45 m (148 ft) steel-lattice tower and a three-segmented cylinder of about 30 m (98 ft), which supports various antennas. There are eight concentric platforms stacked one above the other: starting at 128 m (420 ft) with the two-story observation (lower floor) and revolving restaurant (upper floor) platform, served by two high-speed elevators. Above that at 150 m (492 ft) is the operations platform housing the workforce and equipment, and further up six differentially sized, smaller open platforms in same distances, populated with high-gain directional microwave radio relay antennas (&quot;parabolic mirrors&quot;). Number nine was added at 25 m height in July 2005.
After the observation platform and restaurant were closed due to asbestos decontamination, former stuntman Jochen Schweizer had a bungee jumping base installed. The restaurant will not open again due to new fire escape regulations, and the bungee platform was closed at the end of 2001.

The tower has been home to the VFDB Hamburg section&#x27;s radio amateur club station &quot;DF0HHT&quot;. It also housed a DGPS transmitting station serving the city of Hamburg&#x27;s Surveying Agency. 
The tower is named after the Hamburg-born German physicist Heinrich Hertz. A memorial plaque in his honour on the tower&#x27;s wall reads: &quot;&quot; (&quot;Heinrich Hertz - Son of the City of Hamburg&quot;).

<doc id="838142" wikidata="Q367183" url="?curid=838142" title="Addressing mode">
<text>Addressing modes are an aspect of the instruction set architecture in most central processing unit (CPU) designs. The various addressing modes that are defined in a given instruction set architecture define how the machine language instructions in that architecture identify the operand(s) of each instruction. An addressing mode specifies how to calculate the effective memory address of an operand by using information held in registers and/or constants contained within a machine instruction or elsewhere.

In computer programming, addressing modes are primarily of interest to those who write in assembly languages and to compiler writers. For a related concept see orthogonal instruction set which deals with the ability of any instruction to use any addressing mode.

==Caveats==

There are no generally accepted names for addressing modes: different authors and computer manufacturers may give different names to the same addressing mode, or the same names to different addressing modes. Furthermore, an addressing mode which, in one given architecture, is treated as a single addressing mode may represent functionality that, in another architecture, is covered by two or more addressing modes. For example, some complex instruction set computer (CISC) architectures, such as the Digital Equipment Corporation (DEC) VAX, treat registers and literal or immediate constants as just another addressing mode. Others, such as the IBM System/360 and its successors, and most reduced instruction set computer (RISC) designs, encode this information within the instruction. Thus, the latter machines have three distinct instruction codes for copying one register to another, copying a literal constant into a register, and copying the contents of a memory location into a register, while the VAX has only a single &quot;MOV&quot; instruction.

The term &quot;addressing mode&quot; is itself subject to different interpretations: either &quot;memory address calculation mode&quot; or &quot;operand accessing mode&quot;. Under the first interpretation, instructions that do not read from memory or write to memory (such as &quot;add literal to register&quot;) are considered not to have an &quot;addressing mode&quot;. The second interpretation allows for machines such as VAX which use operand mode bits to allow for a register or for a literal operand. Only the first interpretation applies to instructions such as &quot;load effective address,&quot; which loads the address of the operand, not the operand itself.

The addressing modes listed below are divided into code addressing and data addressing. Most computer architectures maintain this distinction, but there are (or have been) some architectures which allow (almost) all addressing modes to be used in any context.

The instructions shown below are purely representative in order to illustrate the addressing modes, and do not necessarily reflect the mnemonics used by any particular computer.

Some computers, e.g., IBM 709, RCA 3301, do not have a single address mode field but rather have separate fields for indirect addressing and indexing.

==Number of addressing modes==
Computer architectures vary greatly as to the number of addressing modes they provide in hardware. There are some benefits to eliminating complex addressing modes and using only one or a few simpler addressing modes, even though it requires a few extra instructions, and perhaps an extra register. It has proven much easier to design pipelined CPUs if the only addressing modes available are simple ones.

Most RISC architectures have only about five simple addressing modes, while CISC architectures such as the DEC VAX have over a dozen addressing modes, some of which are quite complicated. The IBM System/360 architecture has only four addressing modes; a few more have been added for the ESA/390 architecture.

When there are only a few addressing modes, the particular addressing mode required is usually encoded within the instruction code
(e.g. IBM System/360 and successors, most RISC). But when there are many addressing modes, a specific field is often set aside in the instruction to specify the addressing mode. The DEC VAX allowed multiple memory operands for almost all instructions, and so reserved the first few bits of each operand specifier to indicate the addressing mode for that particular operand.
Keeping the addressing mode specifier bits separate from the opcode operation bits produces an orthogonal instruction set.

Even on a computer with many addressing modes, measurements of actual programs indicate that the simple addressing modes listed below account for some 90% or more of all addressing modes used. Since most such measurements are based on code generated from high-level languages by compilers, this reflects to some extent the limitations of the compilers being used.

==Important use case==
Some instruction set architectures, such as Intel x86 and IBM/360 and its successors, have a load effective address instruction. This calculates the effective operand address and loads it into a register, without accessing the memory it refers to. This can be useful when passing the address of an array element to a subroutine. It may also be a clever way of doing more calculations than normal in one instruction; for example, using such an instruction with the addressing mode &quot;base+index+offset&quot; (detailed below) allows one to add two registers and a constant together in one instruction and store the result in a third register.

==Simple addressing modes for code==

Some simple addressing modes for code are shown below. The nomenclature may vary depending on platform.

===Absolute or direct===
 |jump| address |
 
 (Effective PC address = address)

The effective address for an absolute instruction address is the address parameter itself with no modifications.

===PC-relative===
 |jump| offset | jump relative
 
 (Effective PC address = next instruction address + offset, offset may be negative)

The effective address for a PC-relative instruction address is the offset parameter added to the address of the next instruction. This offset is usually signed to allow reference to code both before and after the instruction.

This is particularly useful in connection with jump instructions, because typical jumps are to nearby instructions (in a high-level language most if or while statements are reasonably short). Measurements of actual programs suggest that an 8 or 10 bit offset is large enough for some 90% of conditional jumps (roughly ±128 or ±512 bytes). For jumps to instructions that are not nearby, other addressing modes are used.

Another advantage of PC-relative addressing is that the code may be position-independent, i.e. it can be loaded anywhere in memory without the need to adjust any addresses.

===Register indirect===
 |jumpVia| reg |
 
 (Effective PC address = contents of register &#x27;reg&#x27;)

The effective address for a register indirect instruction is the address in the specified register. For example, (A7) to access the content of address register A7.

The effect is to transfer control to the instruction whose address is in the specified register.

Many RISC machines, as well as the CISC IBM System/360 and successors, have subroutine call instructions that place the return address in an address register—the register indirect addressing mode is used to return from that subroutine call.

==Sequential addressing modes for code==

===Sequential execution===
 | nop | execute the following instruction
 
 (Effective PC address = next instruction address)

The CPU, after executing a sequential instruction, immediately executes the following instruction.

Sequential execution is not considered to be an addressing mode on some computers.

Most instructions on most CPU architectures are sequential instructions. Because most instructions are sequential instructions, CPU designers often add features that deliberately sacrifice performance on the other instructions—branch instructions—in order to make these sequential instructions run faster.

Conditional branches load the PC with one of 2 possible results, depending on the condition—most CPU architectures use some other addressing mode for the &quot;taken&quot; branch, and sequential execution for the &quot;not taken&quot; branch.

Many features in modern CPUs—instruction prefetch and more complex pipelineing, out-of-order execution, etc.—maintain the illusion that each instruction finishes before the next one begins, giving the same final results, even though that&#x27;s not exactly what happens internally.

Each &quot;basic block&quot; of such sequential instructions exhibits both temporal and spatial locality of reference.

====CPUs that do not use sequential execution====
CPUs that do not use sequential execution with a program counter are extremely rare. In some CPUs, each instruction always specifies the address of next instruction. Such CPUs have an instruction pointer that holds that specified address; it is not a program counter because there is no provision for incrementing it. Such CPUs include some drum memory computers such as the IBM 650, the SECD machine, Librascope RPC 4000, and the RTX 32P.

On processors implemented with horizontal microcode, the microinstruction may contain the high order bits of the next instruction address.

Other computing architectures go much further, attempting to bypass the von Neumann bottleneck using a variety of alternatives to the program counter.

===Conditional execution===
Some computer architectures have conditional instructions (such as ARM, but no longer for all instructions in 64-bit mode) or conditional load instructions (such as x86) which can in some cases make conditional branches unnecessary and avoid flushing the instruction pipeline. An instruction such as a &#x27;compare&#x27; is used to set a condition code, and subsequent instructions include a test on that condition code to see whether they are obeyed or ignored.

===Skip===
 |skipEQ| reg1| reg2| skip the next instruction if reg1=reg2
 
 (Effective PC address = next instruction address + 1)

Skip addressing may be considered a special kind of PC-relative addressing mode with a fixed &quot;+1&quot; offset. Like PC-relative addressing, some CPUs have versions of this addressing mode that only refer to one register (&quot;skip if reg1=0&quot;) or no registers, implicitly referring to some previously-set bit in the status register. Other CPUs have a version that selects a specific bit in a specific byte to test (&quot;skip if bit 7 of reg12 is 0&quot;).

Unlike all other conditional branches, a &quot;skip&quot; instruction never needs to flush the instruction pipeline, though it may need to cause the next instruction to be ignored.

==Simple addressing modes for data==

Some simple addressing modes for data are shown below. The nomenclature may vary depending on platform.

===Register (or, register direct)===
 | mul | reg1| reg2| reg3| reg1 := reg2 * reg3;

This &quot;addressing mode&quot; does not have an effective address and is not considered to be an addressing mode on some computers.

In this example, all the operands are in registers, and the result is placed in a register.

===Base plus offset, and variations===
This is sometimes referred to as &#x27;base plus displacement&#x27; or &#x27;truncated&#x27;.
 | load | reg | base| offset | reg := RAM[base + offset]
 
 (Effective address = offset + contents of specified base register)

If the offset is zero, this becomes an example of &quot;register indirect&quot; addressing; the effective address is just the value in the base register.

On many RISC machines, register 0 is fixed at the value zero. If register 0 is used as the base register, this becomes an example of &quot;absolute addressing&quot;. However, only a small portion of memory can be accessed.

The offset is often small in relation to the size of current computer memories. However, the principle of locality of reference applies: over a short time span, most of the data items a program wants to access are fairly close to each other.

This addressing mode is closely related to the indexed absolute addressing mode.

&quot;Example 1&quot;:
Within a subroutine a programmer will mainly be interested in the parameters and the local variables, for which one base register (the frame pointer) usually suffices. If this routine is a class method in an object-oriented language, then a second base register is needed which points at the attributes for the current object (this or self in some high level languages).

&quot;Example 2&quot;:
If the base register contains the address of a composite type (a record or structure), the offset can be usually used to select a field from that record.

===Immediate/literal===
 | add | reg1| reg2| constant | reg1 := reg2 + constant;

This &quot;addressing mode&quot; does not have an effective address, and is not considered to be an addressing mode on some computers.

The constant might be signed or unsigned. For example, codice_1 to move the immediate hex value of &quot;FEEDABBA&quot; into register D0.

Instead of using an operand from memory, the value of the operand is held within the instruction itself. On the DEC VAX machine, the literal operand sizes could be 6, 8, 16, or 32 bits long.

Andrew Tanenbaum showed that 98% of all the constants in a program would fit in 13 bits (see RISC design philosophy).

===Implicit===
 | clear carry bit |
 
 | clear Accumulator |
The implied addressing mode, also called the implicit addressing mode (x86 assembly language), does not explicitly specify an effective address for either the source or the destination (or sometimes both).

Either the source (if any) or destination effective address (or sometimes both) is implied by the opcode.

Implied addressing was quite common on older computers (up to mid-1970s). Such computers typically had only a single register in which arithmetic could be performed—the accumulator. Such accumulator machines implicitly reference that accumulator in almost every instruction. For example, the operation &lt; a := b + c; &gt; can be done using the sequence &lt; load b; add c; store a; &gt; -- the destination (the accumulator) is implied in every &quot;load&quot; and &quot;add&quot; instruction; the source (the accumulator) is implied in every &quot;store&quot; instruction.

Later computers generally had more than one general-purpose register or RAM location which could be the source or destination or both for arithmetic—and so later computers need some other addressing mode to specify the source and destination of arithmetic.

Among the x86 instructions, some use implicit registers for one of the operands or results (multiplication, division, counting conditional jump).

Some instruction sets (such as x86 and AVR) have one special-purpose register called the stack pointer which is implicitly incremented or decremented when pushing or popping data from the stack, and the source or destination effective address is (implicitly) the address stored in that stack pointer.

Some other instruction sets (such as m68k, ARM, and PowerPC) have more than one register that could be used as a stack pointer—and so use the &quot;register autoincrement indirect&quot; addressing mode to specify which of those registers should be used when pushing or popping data from a stack.

Some current computer instruction sets (e.g. z/Architecture and IA-32/x86-64) contain some instructions with implicit operands in order to maintain backwards compatibility with earlier designs.

On some instruction sets, instructions that flip the user/system mode bit, the interrupt-enable bit, etc. implicitly specify the special register that holds those bits. This simplifies the hardware necessary to trap those instructions in order to meet the Popek and Goldberg virtualization requirements—on such a system, the trap logic does not need to look at any operand (or at the final effective address), but only at the opcode.

Some instruction sets have been designed where every operand is always implicitly specified in every instruction -- zero-operand CPUs.

==Other addressing modes for code or data==

===Absolute/direct===
 | load | reg | address |
 
 (Effective address = address as given in instruction)

This requires space in an instruction for quite a large address. It is often available on CISC machines which have variable-length instructions, such as x86.

Some RISC machines have a special &quot;Load Upper Literal&quot; instruction which places a 16- or 20-bit constant in the top half of a register. That can then be used as the base register in a base-plus-offset addressing mode which supplies the low-order 16 or 12 bits. The combination allows a full 32-bit address.

===Indexed absolute===
 | load | reg |index| address |
 
 (Effective address = address + contents of specified index register)

This also requires space in an instruction for quite a large address. The address could be the start of an array or vector, and the index could select the particular array element required. The processor may scale the index register to allow for the size of each array element.

Note that this is more or less the same as base-plus-offset addressing mode, except that the offset in this case is large enough to address any memory location.

&quot;Example 1&quot;:
Within a subroutine, a programmer may define a string as a local constant or a static variable. The address of the string is stored in the literal address in the instruction. The offset—which character of the string to use on this iteration of a loop—is stored in the index register.

&quot;Example 2&quot;:
A programmer may define several large arrays as globals or as class variables. The start of the array is stored in the literal address (perhaps modified at program-load time by a relocating loader) of the instruction that references it. The offset—which item from the array to use on this iteration of a loop—is stored in the index register. Often the instructions in a loop re-use the same register for the loop counter and the offsets of several arrays.

===Base plus index===
 | load | reg | base|index|
 
 (Effective address = contents of specified base register + contents of specified index register)

The base register could contain the start address of an array or vector, and the index could select the particular array element required. The processor may scale the index register to allow for the size of each array element. This could be used for accessing elements of an array passed as a parameter.

===Base plus index plus offset===
 | load | reg | base|index| offset |
 
 (Effective address = offset + contents of specified base register + contents of specified index register)

The base register could contain the start address of an array or vector of records, the index could select the particular record required, and the offset could select a field within that record. The processor may scale the index register to allow for the size of each array element.

===Scaled===
 | load | reg | base|index|
 
 (Effective address = contents of specified base register + scaled contents of specified index register)

The base register could contain the start address of an array or vector data structure, and the index could contain the offset of the one particular array element required.

This addressing mode dynamically scales the value in the index register to allow for the size of each array element, e.g. if the array elements are double precision floating-point numbers occupying 8 bytes each then the value in the index register is multiplied by 8 before being used in the effective address calculation. The scale factor is normally restricted to being a power of two, so that shifting rather than multiplication can be used.

===Register indirect===
 | load | reg1 | base|
 
 (Effective address = contents of base register)

A few computers have this as a distinct addressing mode. Many computers just use &quot;base plus offset&quot; with an offset value of 0. For example, (A7)

===Register autoincrement indirect===
 | load | reg | base |
 
 (Effective address = contents of base register)

After determining the effective address, the value in the base register is incremented by the size of the data item that is to be accessed. For example, (A7)+ would access the content of the address register A7, then increase the address pointer of A7 by 1 (usually 1 word). Within a loop, this addressing mode can be used to step through all the elements of an array or vector.

In high-level languages it is often thought to be a good idea that functions which return a result should not have side effects (lack of side effects makes program understanding and validation much easier). This addressing mode has a side effect in that the base register is altered. If the subsequent memory access causes an error (e.g. page fault, bus error, address error) leading to an interrupt, then restarting the instruction becomes much more problematic since one or more registers may need to be set back to the state they were in before the instruction originally started.

There have been at least three computer architectures that have had implementation problems with regard to recovery from faults when this addressing mode is used:
*DEC PDP-11. Could have one or two autoincrement register operands. Some models, such as the PDP-11/45 and PDP-11/70, had a register that recorded modifications to registers, allowing the fault handler to undo the register modifications and re-execute the instruction.
*Motorola 68000 series. Could have one or two autoincrement register operands. The 68010 and later processors resolved the problem by saving the processor&#x27;s internal state on bus or address errors and restoring it when returning from the fault.
*DEC VAX. Could have up to 6 autoincrement register operands. The First Part Done bit in the saved processor status longword in a stack frame for a fault is set if the faulting instruction must not be restarted at the beginning, resolving the problem.

===Register autodecrement indirect===
 | load | reg | base|
 
 (Effective address = new contents of base register)

Before determining the effective address, the value in the base register is decremented by the size of the data item which is to be accessed.

Within a loop, this addressing mode can be used to step backwards through all the elements of an array or vector. A stack can be implemented by using this mode in conjunction with the previous addressing mode (autoincrement).

See the discussion of side-effects under the autoincrement addressing mode.

===Memory indirect or deferred===
Any of the addressing modes mentioned in this article could have an extra bit to indicate indirect addressing, i.e. the address calculated using some mode is in fact the address of a location (typically a complete word) which contains the actual effective address.

Indirect addressing may be used for code or data. It can make implementation of &quot;pointers&quot;, &quot;references&quot;, or &quot;handles&quot; much easier, and can also make it easier to call subroutines which are not otherwise addressable. Indirect addressing does carry a performance penalty due to the extra memory access involved.

Some early minicomputers (e.g. DEC PDP-8, Data General Nova) had only a few registers and only a limited direct addressing range (8 bits). Hence the use of memory indirect addressing was almost the only way of referring to any significant amount of memory.

Half of the DEC PDP-11&#x27;s eight addressing modes are deferred. Register deferred @Rn is the same as register indirect as defined above. Predecrement deferred @-(Rn), postincrement deferred @(Rn)+, and indexed deferred @nn(Rn) modes point to addresses in memory which are read to find the address of the parameter. The PDP-11&#x27;s deferred mode, when combined with the program counter, provide its absolute addressing mode.

===PC-relative===
 | load | reg1 | base=PC | offset |
 
 reg1 := RAM[PC + offset]
 (Effective address = PC + offset)

The PC-relative addressing mode can be used to load a register with a value stored in program memory a short distance away from the current instruction. It can be seen as a special case of the &quot;base plus offset&quot; addressing mode, one that selects the program counter (PC) as the &quot;base register&quot;.

There are a few CPUs that support PC-relative data references. Such CPUs include:

The x86-64 architecture and the 64-bit ARMv8-A architecture have PC-relative addressing modes, called &quot;RIP-relative&quot; in x86-64 and &quot;literal&quot; in ARMv8-A. The Motorola 6809 also supports a PC-relative addressing mode.

The PDP-11 architecture, the VAX architecture, and the 32-bit ARM architectures support PC-relative addressing by having the PC in the register file.

The IBM z/Architecture includes specific instructions, e.g., Load Relative Long, with PC-relative addressing if the General-Instructions-Extension Facility is active.

When this addressing mode is used, the compiler typically places the constants in a literal pool immediately before or immediately after the subroutine that uses them, to prevent accidentally executing those constants as instructions.

This addressing mode, which always fetches data from memory or stores data to memory and then sequentially falls through to execute the next instruction (the effective address points to data), should not be confused with &quot;PC-relative branch&quot; which does not fetch data from or store data to memory, but instead branches to some other instruction at the given offset (the effective address points to an executable instruction).

==Obsolete addressing modes==
The addressing modes listed here were used in the 1950–1980 period, but are no longer available on most current computers.
This list is by no means complete; there have been many other interesting and peculiar addressing modes used from time to time, e.g. absolute-minus-logical-OR of two or three index registers.

===Multi-level memory indirect===
If the word size is larger than the address, then the word referenced for memory-indirect addressing could itself have an indirect flag set to indicate another memory indirect cycle. This flag is referred to as an indirection bit, and the resulting pointer is a tagged pointer, the indirection bit tagging whether it is a direct pointer or an indirect pointer. Care is needed to ensure that a chain of indirect addresses does not refer to itself; if it does, one can get an infinite loop while trying to resolve an address.

The IBM 1620, the Data General Nova, the HP 2100 series, and the NAR 2 each have such a multi-level memory indirect, and could enter such an infinite address calculation loop.
The memory indirect addressing mode on the Nova influenced the invention of indirect threaded code.

The DEC PDP-10 computer with 18-bit addresses and 36-bit words allowed multi-level indirect addressing with the possibility of using an index register at each stage as well. The priority interrupt system was queried before decoding of every address word. So, an indirect address loop would not prevent execution of device service routines, including any preemptive multitasking scheduler&#x27;s time-slice expiration handler. A looping instruction would be treated like any other compute-bound job.

===Memory-mapped registers===
On some computers, there were addresses that referred to registers rather than to primary storage, or to primary memory used to implement those registers. Although on some early computers there were register addresses at the high end of the address range, e.g., IBM 650, IBM 7070, the trend has been to use only register address at the low end and to use only the first 8 or 16 words of memory (e.g. ICL 1900, DEC PDP-6/PDP-10). This meant that there was no need for a separate &quot;add register to register&quot; instruction – one could just use the &quot;add memory to register&quot; instruction.

In the case of early models of the PDP-10, which did not have any cache memory, if the &quot;fast registers&quot; option, which provided faster circuits to store the registers but still allowed them to be addressed as if they were in memory, was installed, a tight inner loop loaded into the first few words of memory ran much faster than it would have in magnetic core memory.

Later models of the DEC PDP-11 series mapped the registers onto addresses in the input/output area, but this was primarily intended to allow remote diagnostics. Confusingly, the 16-bit registers were mapped onto consecutive 8-bit byte addresses.

===Memory indirect and autoincrement===
The DEC PDP-8 minicomputer had eight special locations (at addresses 8 through 15). When accessed via memory indirect addressing, these locations would automatically increment prior to use. This made it easy to step through memory in a loop without needing to use the accumulator to increment the address.

The Data General Nova minicomputer had 16 special memory locations at addresses 16 through 31. When accessed via memory indirect addressing, 16 through 23 would automatically increment before use, and 24 through 31 would automatically decrement before use.

===Zero page===
The Data General Nova, Motorola 6800 family, and MOS Technology 6502 family of processors had very few internal registers. Arithmetic and logical instructions were mostly performed against values in memory as opposed to internal registers. As a result, many instructions required a two-byte (16-bit) location to memory. Given that opcodes on these processors were only one byte (8 bits) in length, memory addresses could make up a significant part of code size.

Designers of these processors included a partial remedy known as &quot;zero page&quot; addressing. The initial 256 bytes of memory ($0000 – $00FF; a.k.a., page &quot;0&quot;) could be accessed using a one-byte absolute or indexed memory address. This reduced instruction execution time by one clock cycle and instruction length by one byte. By storing often-used data in this region, programs could be made smaller and faster.

As a result, the zero page was used similarly to a register file. On many systems, however, this resulted in high utilization of the zero page memory area by the operating system and user programs, which limited its use since free space was limited.

===Direct page===
The zero page address mode was enhanced in several late model 8-bit processors, including the WDC 65816, the CSG 65CE02, and the Motorola 6809. The new mode, known as &quot;direct page&quot; addressing, added the ability to move the 256-byte zero page memory window from the start of memory (offset address $0000) to a new location within the first 64 KB of memory.

The CSG 65CE02 allowed the direct page to be moved to any 256-byte boundary within the first 64 KB of memory by storing an 8-bit offset value in the new base page (B) register. The Motorola 6809 could do the same with its direct page (DP) register. The WDC 65816 went a step further and allowed the direct page to be moved to any location within the first 64 KB of memory by storing a 16-bit offset value in the new direct (D) register.

As a result, a greater number of programs were able to utilize the enhanced direct page addressing mode versus legacy processors that only included the zero page addressing mode.

===Scaled index with bounds checking===
This is similar to scaled index addressing, except that the instruction has two extra operands (typically constants), and the hardware checks that the index value is between these bounds.

Another variation uses vector descriptors to hold the bounds; this makes it easy to implement dynamically allocated arrays and still have full bounds checking.

===Indirect to bit field within word===
Some computers had special indirect addressing modes for subfields within words.

The GE/Honeywell 600 series character addressing indirect word specified either 6-bit or 9-bit character fields within its 36-bit word.

The DEC PDP-10, also 36-bit, had special instructions which allowed memory to be treated as a sequence of fixed-size bit fields or bytes of any size from 1 bit to 36 bits. A one-word sequence descriptor in memory, called a &quot;byte pointer&quot;, held the current word address within the sequence, a bit position within a word, and the size of each byte.

Instructions existed to load and store bytes via this descriptor, and to increment the descriptor to point at the next byte (bytes were not split across word boundaries). Much DEC software used five 7-bit bytes per word (plain ASCII characters), with one bit per word unused. Implementations of C had to use four 9-bit bytes per word, since the &#x27;malloc&#x27; function in C assumes that the size of an &quot;int&quot; is some multiple of the size of a &quot;char&quot;; the actual multiple is determined by the system-dependent compile-time operator sizeof.

===Index next instruction===
The Elliott 503, the Elliott 803, and the Apollo Guidance Computer only used absolute addressing, and did not have any index registers.
Thus, indirect jumps, or jumps through registers, were not supported in the instruction set. Instead, it could be instructed to &quot;add the contents of the current memory word to the next instruction&quot;. Adding a small value to the next instruction to be executed could, for example, change a codice_2 into a codice_3, thus creating the effect of an indexed jump. Note that the instruction is modified on-the-fly and remains unchanged in memory, i.e. it is not self-modifying code. If the value being added to the next instruction was large enough, it could modify the opcode of that instruction as well as or instead of the address.

<text>A pastebin or text storage site is a type of online content-hosting service where users can store plain text (e.g. source code snippets for code review via Internet Relay Chat (IRC)). The most famous pastebin is the eponymous pastebin.com. Other sites with the same functionality have appeared, and several open source pastebin scripts are available. Pastebins may allow commenting where readers can post feedback directly on the page. GitHub Gists are a type of pastebin with version control.

==History==
Pastebin was developed in the late 1990s to facilitate IRC chatrooms devoted to computing, where users naturally need to share large blocks of computer input or output in a line-oriented medium. In such chatrooms, sending messages containing large blocks of computer data can disrupt conversations, which can be closely interleaved. When users send such messages, they are often warned to instead use pastebins or risk being banned from the service. Contrarily, a reference to a pastebin entry is a one-line hyperlink.

A new class of IRC bot has evolved. In a chatroom that is largely oriented around a few pastebins, nothing more needs to be done after a post at its pastebin. The receiving party then awaits a bot announcing the expected posting by the known user.

After the use of the pastebin.pl pastebin for a data breach, Pastebin started monitoring the site for illegally pasted data and information, leading to a backlash from Anonymous. Hacktivists teamed up with an organization calling itself the People&#x27;s Liberation Front, launching an alternative called AnonPaste.

<text>Hilbert&#x27;s axioms are a set of 20 assumptions proposed by David Hilbert in 1899 in his book &quot;Grundlagen der Geometrie&quot; (tr. &quot;The Foundations of Geometry&quot;) as the foundation for a modern treatment of Euclidean geometry. Other well-known modern axiomatizations of Euclidean geometry are those of Alfred Tarski and of George Birkhoff.

== The axioms ==
Hilbert&#x27;s axiom system is constructed with six primitive notions: three primitive terms:
* point;
* line;
* plane;
and three primitive relations: 
* &quot;Betweenness&quot;, a ternary relation linking points;
* &quot;Lies on (Containment)&quot;, three binary relations, one linking points and straight lines, one linking points and planes, and one linking straight lines and planes;
* &quot;Congruence&quot;, two binary relations, one linking line segments and one linking angles, each denoted by an infix ≅.

Line segments, angles, and triangles may each be defined in terms of points and straight lines, using the relations of betweenness and containment. All points, straight lines, and planes in the following axioms are distinct unless otherwise stated.

===I. Incidence===
# For every two points &quot;A&quot; and &quot;B&quot; there exists a line &quot;a&quot; that contains them both. We write &quot;AB&quot; = &quot;a&quot; or &quot;BA&quot; = &quot;a&quot;. Instead of &quot;contains&quot;, we may also employ other forms of expression; for example, we may say &quot;&quot;A&quot; lies upon &quot;a&quot;, &quot;A&quot; is a point of &quot;a&quot;, &quot;a&quot; goes through &quot;A&quot; and through &quot;B&quot;, &quot;a&quot; joins &quot;A&quot; to &quot;B&quot;&quot;, etc. If &quot;A&quot; lies upon &quot;a&quot; and at the same time upon another line &quot;b&quot;, we make use also of the expression: &quot;The lines &quot;a&quot; and &quot;b&quot; have the point &quot;A&quot; in common&quot;, etc.
# For every two points there exists no more than one line that contains them both; consequently, if and , where , then also .
# There exist at least two points on a line. There exist at least three points that do not lie on the same line.
# For every three points &quot;A&quot;, &quot;B&quot;, &quot;C&quot; not situated on the same line there exists a plane α that contains all of them. For every plane there exists a point which lies on it. We write . We employ also the expressions: &quot;&quot;A&quot;, &quot;B&quot;, &quot;C&quot; lie in &quot;α&quot;; &quot;A&quot;, &quot;B&quot;, &quot;C&quot; are points of &quot;α&quot;&quot;, etc.
# For every three points &quot;A&quot;, &quot;B&quot;, &quot;C&quot; which do not lie in the same line, there exists no more than one plane that contains them all.
# If two points &quot;A&quot;, &quot;B&quot; of a line &quot;a&quot; lie in a plane &quot;α&quot;, then every point of &quot;a&quot; lies in &quot;α&quot;. In this case we say: &quot;The line &quot;a&quot; lies in the plane &quot;α&quot;&quot;, etc.
# If two planes &quot;α&quot;, &quot;β&quot; have a point &quot;A&quot; in common, then they have at least a second point &quot;B&quot; in common.
# There exist at least four points not lying in a plane.

===II. Order ===
# If a point &quot;B&quot; lies between points &quot;A&quot; and &quot;C&quot;, &quot;B&quot; is also between &quot;C&quot; and &quot;A&quot;, and there exists a line containing the distinct points &quot;A&quot;, &quot;B&quot;, &quot;C&quot;.
# If &quot;A&quot; and &quot;C&quot; are two points, then there exists at least one point &quot;B&quot; on the line &quot;AC&quot; such that &quot;C&quot; lies between &quot;A&quot; and &quot;B&quot;.
# Of any three points situated on a line, there is no more than one which lies between the other two.
# Pasch&#x27;s Axiom: Let &quot;A&quot;, &quot;B&quot;, &quot;C&quot; be three points not lying in the same line and let &quot;a&quot; be a line lying in the plane &quot;ABC&quot; and not passing through any of the points &quot;A&quot;, &quot;B&quot;, &quot;C&quot;. Then, if the line &quot;a&quot; passes through a point of the segment &quot;AB&quot;, it will also pass through either a point of the segment &quot;BC&quot; or a point of the segment &quot;AC&quot;.

===III. Congruence ===
# If &quot;A&quot;, &quot;B&quot; are two points on a line &quot;a&quot;, and if &quot;A&quot;′ is a point upon the same or another line &quot;a&quot;′, then, upon a given side of &quot;A&quot;′ on the straight line &quot;a&quot;′, we can always find a point &quot;B&quot;′ so that the segment &quot;AB&quot; is congruent to the segment &quot;A&quot;′&quot;B&quot;′. We indicate this relation by writing . Every segment is congruent to itself; that is, we always have .&lt;br&gt;We can state the above axiom briefly by saying that every segment can be &quot;laid off&quot; upon a given side of a given point of a given straight line in at least one way.
# If a segment &quot;AB&quot; is congruent to the segment &quot;A&quot;′&quot;B&quot;′ and also to the segment &quot;A&quot;″&quot;B&quot;″, then the segment &quot;A&quot;′&quot;B&quot;′ is congruent to the segment &quot;A&quot;″&quot;B&quot;″; that is, if and , then .
# Let &quot;AB&quot; and &quot;BC&quot; be two segments of a line &quot;a&quot; which have no points in common aside from the point &quot;B&quot;, and, furthermore, let &quot;A&quot;′&quot;B&quot;′ and &quot;B&quot;′&quot;C&quot;′ be two segments of the same or of another line &quot;a&quot;′ having, likewise, no point other than &quot;B&quot;′ in common. Then, if and , we have .
# Let an angle be given in the plane &quot;α&quot; and let a line &quot;a&quot;′ be given in a plane &quot;α&quot;′. Suppose also that, in the plane &quot;α&quot;′, a definite side of the straight line &quot;a&quot;′ be assigned. Denote by &quot;h&quot;′ a ray of the straight line &quot;a&quot;′ emanating from a point &quot;O&quot;′ of this line. Then in the plane &quot;α&quot;′ there is one and only one ray &quot;k&quot;′ such that the angle , or , is congruent to the angle and at the same time all interior points of the angle lie upon the given side of &quot;a&quot;′. We express this relation by means of the notation .
# If the angle is congruent to the angle and to the angle , then the angle is congruent to the angle ; that is to say, if and , then .
# If, in the two triangles &quot;ABC&quot; and &quot;A&quot;′&quot;B&quot;′&quot;C&quot;′ the congruences , , hold, then the congruence holds (and, by a change of notation, it follows that also holds).

===IV. Parallels ===
# Playfair&#x27;s axiom: Let &quot;a&quot; be any line and &quot;A&quot; a point not on it. Then there is at most one line in the plane, determined by &quot;a&quot; and &quot;A&quot;, that passes through &quot;A&quot; and does not intersect &quot;a&quot;.

===V. Continuity ===
# Axiom of Archimedes: If &quot;AB&quot; and &quot;CD&quot; are any segments then there exists a number &quot;n&quot; such that &quot;n&quot; segments &quot;CD&quot; constructed contiguously from &quot;A&quot;, along the ray from &quot;A&quot; through &quot;B&quot;, will pass beyond the point &quot;B&quot;.
# &quot;Axiom of line completeness&quot;: An extension (An extended line from a line that already exists, usually used in geometry) of a set of points on a line with its order and congruence relations that would preserve the relations existing among the original elements as well as the fundamental properties of line order and congruence that follows from Axioms I-III and from V-1 is impossible.

== Hilbert&#x27;s discarded axiom ==
Hilbert (1899) included a 21st axiom that read as follows:
:II.4. Any four points &quot;A&quot;, &quot;B&quot;, &quot;C&quot;, &quot;D&quot; of a line can always be labeled so that &quot;B&quot; shall lie between &quot;A&quot; and &quot;C&quot; and also between &quot;A&quot; and &quot;D&quot;, and, furthermore, that &quot;C&quot; shall lie between &quot;A&quot; and &quot;D&quot; and also between &quot;B&quot; and &quot;D&quot;.

This statement is also known as Pasch&#x27;s theorem.

E. H. Moore and R. L. Moore independently proved that this axiom is redundant, and the former published this result in an article appearing in the &quot;Transactions of the American Mathematical Society&quot; in 1902.

Before this, Pasch&#x27;s axiom, now listed as II.4, was numbered II.5.

== Editions and translations of &quot;Grundlagen der Geometrie&quot; ==
The original monograph, based on his own lectures, was organized and written by Hilbert for a memorial address given in 1899. This was quickly followed by a French translation, in which Hilbert added V.2, the Completeness Axiom. An English translation, authorized by Hilbert, was made by E.J. Townsend and copyrighted in 1902. This translation incorporated the changes made in the French translation and so is considered to be a translation of the 2nd edition. Hilbert continued to make changes in the text and several editions appeared in German. The 7th edition was the last to appear in Hilbert&#x27;s lifetime. In the Preface of this edition Hilbert wrote:
:&quot;The present Seventh Edition of my book &quot;Foundations of Geometry&quot; brings considerable improvements and additions to the previous edition, partly from my subsequent lectures on this subject and partly from improvements made in the meantime by other writers. The main text of the book has been revised accordingly.&quot;
New editions followed the 7th, but the main text was essentially not revised. The modifications in these editions occur in the appendices and in supplements. The changes in the text were large when compared to the original and a new English translation was commissioned by Open Court Publishers, who had published the Townsend translation. So, the 2nd English Edition was translated by Leo Unger from the 10th German edition in 1971. This translation incorporates several revisions and enlargements of the later German editions by Paul Bernays.

The Unger translation differs from the Townsend translation with respect to the axioms in the following ways:
* Old axiom II.4 is renamed as Theorem 5 and moved. 
* Old axiom II.5 (Pasch&#x27;s Axiom) is renumbered as II.4.
* V.2, the Axiom of Line Completeness, replaced:
:: &quot;Axiom of completeness&quot;. To a system of points, straight lines, and planes, it is impossible to add other elements in such a manner that the system thus generalized shall form a new geometry obeying all of the five groups of axioms. In other words, the elements of geometry form a system which is not susceptible of extension, if we regard the five groups of axioms as valid.
* The old axiom V.2 is now Theorem 32.

The last two modifications are due to P. Bernays.

Other changes of note are:
* The term &quot;straight line&quot; used by Townsend has been replaced by &quot;line&quot; throughout.
* The &quot;Axioms of Incidence&quot; were called &quot;Axioms of Connection&quot; by Townsend.

== Application ==
These axioms axiomatize Euclidean solid geometry. Removing five axioms mentioning &quot;plane&quot; in an essential way, namely I.4–8, and modifying III.4 and IV.1 to omit mention of planes, yields an axiomatization of Euclidean plane geometry.

Hilbert&#x27;s axioms, unlike Tarski&#x27;s axioms, do not constitute a first-order theory because the axioms V.1–2 cannot be expressed in first-order logic.

The value of Hilbert&#x27;s &quot;Grundlagen&quot; was more methodological than substantive or pedagogical. Other major contributions to the axiomatics of geometry were those of Moritz Pasch, Mario Pieri, Oswald Veblen, Edward Vermilye Huntington, Gilbert Robinson, and Henry George Forder. The value of the &quot;Grundlagen&quot; is its pioneering approach to metamathematical questions, including the use of models to prove axioms independent; and the need to prove the consistency and completeness of an axiom system.

Mathematics in the twentieth century evolved into a network of axiomatic formal systems. This was, in considerable part, influenced by the example Hilbert set in the &quot;Grundlagen&quot;. A 2003 effort (Meikle and Fleuriot) to formalize the &quot;Grundlagen&quot; with a computer, though, found that some of Hilbert&#x27;s proofs appear to rely on diagrams and geometric intuition, and as such revealed some potential ambiguities and omissions in his definitions.

<text>Paul Pena (; January 26, 1950 – October 1, 2005) was an American singer, songwriter and guitarist.

Pena&#x27;s music from the first half of his career touched on Delta blues, jazz, morna, flamenco, folk, and rock and roll. Pena is probably best known for writing the song &quot;Jet Airliner,&quot; a major 1977 hit for the Steve Miller Band and a staple of classic rock radio; and for appearing in the 1999 documentary film &quot;Genghis Blues&quot;, wherein he displayed his abilities in the field of Tuvan throat singing.

==Early years==
Pena was born in Hyannis, Massachusetts, to Jack and Virginia Pena. His grandparents were from Cape Verde. Pena was born with congenital glaucoma, and was almost completely blind since birth. He attended the Perkins School for the Blind in Watertown, Massachusetts, from the age of 5, and graduated in 1967. He then attended Clark University in Worcester, Massachusetts.

==Musical career==

In February 1969, Pena&#x27;s band played for a week at the Electric Factory in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, opening twice for both Frank Zappa and the Mothers of Invention and the Grateful Dead. Pena performed in the Contemporary Composer&#x27;s Workshop at the Newport Folk Festival the same year. He also played in the T-Bone Walker Blues Band during the early 1970s, including an appearance in the Montreux Jazz Festival in 1972. He played bass guitar and provided backup vocals on Bonnie Raitt&#x27;s 1971 debut album.

After moving to San Francisco in 1971, Pena called the Grateful Dead office, which helped find him work. He opened for Jerry Garcia and Merl Saunders at the Keystone in Berkeley and other area clubs many times over the course of the next three years. Pena said of Keystone owner Freddie Herrera, &quot;His idea of an audition was for me to come and open up for Garcia and Saunders. That went on for some time. Whenever he would have somebody, not knowing who would open, he would call me.&quot;

Pena&#x27;s debut album was the self-titled &quot;Paul Pena&quot;, recorded with guitarist Jeff Baxter, drummer Juma Santos, and former Perkins classmate Ellis Hall on backing vocals, and released by Capitol Records in 1972. His follow-up album &quot;New Train&quot; was recorded in 1973 by Bearsville Records and was produced by Ben Sidran (keyboardist for the Steve Miller Band). &quot;New Train&quot; featured Jerry Garcia, Merl Saunders, and The Persuasions. Albert Grossman, the owner of Bearsville Records (and best known as the manager of Bob Dylan), stopped release of the record after a dispute with Pena and his then-manager, Dr. Gunther Weil. Pena remained contractually obligated to Grossman, and was unable to record for another label.

Sidran gave an unreleased copy of &quot;New Train&quot; to Steve Miller, who recorded &quot;Jet Airliner&quot; with the Steve Miller Band for the 1977 album &quot;Book of Dreams&quot;. Miller&#x27;s version of &quot;Jet Airliner&quot; was a hit single, and went to #8 on the charts. Pena&#x27;s primary source of income in his later years were royalties from that single, which was a song about Pena&#x27;s airplane trip from Boston to Montreal to play the first-ever date with T-Bone Walker&#x27;s band.

Pena temporarily suspended his musical career to care for his wife Babe, who was experiencing kidney failure. She died in 1991.

&quot;New Train&quot; was finally released in 2000, 27 years after it was recorded. In 2001 Pena conducted his last tour, playing a number of dates in support of the album. He opened shows for The String Cheese Incident in March of that year, and for Bob Weir&#x27;s Ratdog in April. He was a presenter at the 22nd annual W. C. Handy Awards in May. He then appeared on &quot;Late Night with Conan O&#x27;Brien&quot; on June 8, 2001, and played &quot;Jet Airliner&quot;.

&quot;Gonna Move,&quot; a song from &quot;New Train&quot;, has been covered by a number of artists, including Les Dudek on his 1978 album &quot;Ghost Town Parade&quot;, Susan Tedeschi on her 2002 album &quot;Wait for Me&quot;, the Derek Trucks Band on their 2004 album &quot;Live at Georgia Theatre&quot;, and by Taylor Hicks on 2006&#x27;s &quot;Taylor Hicks&quot;. The Derek Trucks Band also covered Pena&#x27;s song &quot;Something to Make You Happy&quot; on their 2009 Grammy Award-winning album &quot;Already Free&quot;.

==Throat singing==
While searching for a Korean language lesson on shortwave radio on December 29, 1984, Pena was intrigued by an example of Tuvan throat singing he heard on a Radio Moscow broadcast. At the same time he heard an interview with the English musician Jill Purce, one of the pioneers of overtone chanting in the West, on KPFA radio in Berkeley, California, and obtained her recording. Seven years later he found a Tuvan record at a local record store called &quot;Tuva: Voices From the Center of Asia&quot;, and listened to it &quot;continuously&quot;. Based on that record and extended experimentation, he was able to teach himself the vocal techniques called Khoomei, Sygyt, and Kargyraa. Pena said:

Pena also taught himself Tuvan. There were no Tuvan-to-English translation dictionaries, so Pena used two dictionaries: Tuvan-to-Russian and Russian-to-English. He used a device called an Optacon to scan the pages and convert the printed words into tactile sensations he could read with his finger.

Pena attended a performance of Tuvan throat singing at the Asian Art Museum of San Francisco on February 6, 1993. He performed an impromptu Tuvan song in the kargyraa style, which impressed famous Tuvan throatsinger Kongar-ol Ondar. Ondar invited Pena to sing in the second international Khoomei Symposium in 1995 in Kyzyl, Tuva. Pena travelled to Tuva and was the first westerner to compete in the Symposium. He placed first in the Kargyraa contest and also won the &quot;audience favorite&quot; category.

Tuvans affectionately call him &quot;Cher Shimjer&quot; (which means &quot;earthquake&quot;, , ), because of the deepness of his voice. Pena said, &quot;My voice is lower than most Tuvans. They have a style that makes your voice lower. When I use that, there&#x27;s a slow song when I hit a note that&#x27;s four white keys from the left of the piano.&quot;

The 1999 film &quot;Genghis Blues&quot; documented Pena&#x27;s journey to Tuva. It won the 1999 Sundance Film Festival Audience Award for a Documentary. It was also nominated for an Academy Award in 2000 in the Documentary Feature category.

==Death==
Pena was in poor health in the years leading up to his death. He died in his San Francisco, California, apartment of complications from diabetes and pancreatitis on October 1, 2005.

<text>Three Logan Square, formerly known as the Bell Atlantic Tower, is a 55-story skyscraper located in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. Standing 739 ft (225 m) tall to its structural top, the building encloses of office space. The building, designed by the Philadelphia-based architecture firm Kling Lindquist, was completed in 1991.

A city ordinance dictates that no building within of the nearby Benjamin Franklin Parkway may rise taller than ; the tower stands just outside this zone. A landscaped plaza, constructed of the same red granite as the building, occupies the rest of the plot, fulfilling a city requirement that 1% of the total budget for new building construction must go toward a work of public art.

A banquet hall, known as Top of the Tower, occupies the top floor of the building and is available for public rentals.

It was the headquarters for Philadelphia-based Baby Bell Bell Atlantic until 1996, when Bell Atlantic acquired New York City-based NYNEX and moved its headquarters to New York. In 2000, Bell Atlantic and GTE merged to become Verizon and the &quot;Bell Atlantic&quot; name became obsolete. However, the building&#x27;s managers kept the original name, mainly because of the difficulties in getting all necessary parties to agree to change it.

The building had been offered for sale in the past, and on August 5, 2010, it was sold to Brandywine Realty Trust. The company has since renamed the tower Three Logan Square, to better identify its location near two other Brandywine-owned buildings, One and Two Logan Square.

<doc id="838167" wikidata="Q1090886" url="?curid=838167" title="Lepiota">
<text>Lepiota is a genus of gilled mushrooms in the family Agaricaceae. All &quot;Lepiota&quot; species are ground-dwelling saprotrophs with a preference for rich, calcareous soils. Basidiocarps (fruit bodies) are agaricoid with whitish spores, typically with scaly caps and a ring on the stipe. Around 400 species of &quot;Lepiota&quot; are currently recognized worldwide. Many species are poisonous, some lethally so.

==Taxonomy==

===History===
&quot;Agaricus&quot; section &quot;Lepiota&quot; was originally published in 1797 by South African-born mycologist Christian Hendrik Persoon. It was subsequently raised to the rank of genus by Samuel Frederick Gray. As originally conceived, the genus was a mix of agarics with rings on their stems, including species now placed in &quot;Armillaria&quot;, &quot;Cortinarius&quot;, and &quot;Pholiota&quot;. In 1822, however, the influential Swedish mycologist Elias Magnus Fries restricted &quot;Lepiota&quot; to white-spored, ringed agarics.

Based on macro- and micromorphology, later authors gradually refined the generic concept of &quot;Lepiota&quot;. Some unrelated genera, such as &quot;Cystoderma&quot; (Fayod 1889) and &quot;Limacella&quot; (Earle 1909), were removed from the genus whilst several related genera, including &quot;Leucocoprinus&quot; (Patouillard 1888), &quot;Macrolepiota&quot; and &quot;Leucoagaricus&quot; (Singer 1948), &quot;Cystolepiota&quot; (Singer 1952), and &quot;Echinoderma&quot; (Bon 1991) were separated off. These segregated genera, together with &quot;Lepiota&quot; itself, are still often grouped together as &quot;Lepiota s.l.&quot; (&quot;sensu lato&quot; = &quot;in the wide sense&quot;) or as the &quot;lepiotoid&quot; fungi.

The secotioid species &quot;Amogaster viridiglebus&quot;, described in 1996 and initially placed in the order Boletales, was later determined to be a member of &quot;Lepiota&quot;, and officially transferred to the genus in 2013.

===Current status===
Following some discussion over the type species, &quot;Lepiota&quot; has now been conserved under the International Code of Nomenclature for algae, fungi, and plants, typified by &quot;Agaricus colubrinus&quot; Pers. (= &quot;Lepiota clypeolaria&quot;). Recent molecular research, based on cladistic analysis of DNA sequences, suggests that the morphological concept of &quot;Lepiota s.s.&quot; (&quot;sensu stricto&quot; = in the strict or narrow sense) is soundly based.

The name &quot;Lepiota&quot; is derived from the Greek λεπις (= &quot;scale&quot;) + οὖς (= &quot;ear&quot;).

==Description==
Fruit bodies of &quot;Lepiota&quot; species are almost all agaricoid (&quot;Lepiota viridigleba&quot; is the sole sequestrate species in the genus), most (but not all) having comparatively small caps (less than in diameter) and slender stems. The cap cuticle (surface skin) typically splits as the cap expands, breaking up into concentric rings of scales towards the margin. The gills beneath the cap are white to cream (rarely yellow) and are free (not joined to the stem). The gills are covered by a partial veil when young, which typically ruptures to leave a cuff-like ring (sometimes ephemeral) often with additional scaly remains on the stem. Several species have a distinct, often rubbery, smell. The spore print is white to cream. The spores are usually (but not always) dextrinoid (turning red-brown in an iodine-based reagent).

==Habitat and distribution==
Most if not all &quot;Lepiota&quot; species are nitrophilic, with a preference for calcareous soils. They typically occur in rich humus in broadleaf or conifer woodland, in northern Europe often among nettles (&quot;Urtica dioica&quot;) or dog&#x27;s mercury (&quot;Mercurialis perennis&quot;). A few species are more frequently found in calcareous grassland or in dunes. The genus has a cosmopolitan distribution, but with a preference for warm areas, meaning there are fewer species in colder climates. Around 400 species are currently recognized worldwide.

==Toxicity==
Several species contain amatoxins and are lethally poisonous, if consumed. Those known to have caused fatalities include &quot;Lepiota brunneoincarnata&quot;, &quot;L. brunneolilacea&quot;, &quot;L. castanea&quot;, &quot;L. helveola&quot;, and &quot;L. subincarnata&quot; (synonym &quot;L. josserandii&quot;). No &quot;Lepiota&quot; species is recommended as edible.

==Literature==
No comprehensive monograph of the genus has yet been published. In Europe, however, species of &quot;Lepiota&quot; were illustrated and described in a regional guide by Candusso &amp; Lanzoni (1990) and more briefly in descriptive keys by Bon (1993). Dutch species were illustrated and described by Vellinga (2001). No equivalent modern guides have been published for North America, but Vellinga (2008) has published an online bibliography of the relevant literature. In Australia, a guide to the &quot;Lepiota&quot; species of south-eastern Queensland was published by Aberdeen (1992). In Asia, a study of &quot;Lepiota&quot; diversity in northern Thailand revealed 73 species.

<text>Peter Evrard (born 19 October 1974) is the winner of the first season of &quot;Idool 2003&quot;, the Belgian version of &quot;Pop Idol&quot;.

Evrard defied the traditional rules of the Idols series by singing rock music instead of the expected pop. Regardless, he managed to win the series, and in 2003 he placed third overall in the World Idol contest. Evrard lives and works in Beerse, Belgium. He is married and has 2 sons and a daughter.

In 2005, Peter began recording music again with his band Toner on the CD Radio Honolulu. The song &quot;Let Me Take You Through the Night&quot; was used for the soundtrack of &quot;Flikken&quot;, a popular Belgian television series.

In 2007, he recorded, together with Sofie Van Moll, the new theme for the Belgian soap opera &quot;Thuis&quot;.

In 2014, he joined the band 10Rogue, and their first single &quot;Know Better&quot; was released in September 2015.

In January 2016 they released their second single &quot;Dark Angel Princess&quot;.

<doc id="838172" wikidata="Q213744" url="?curid=838172" title="Christian Graf von Haugwitz">
<text>Christian August Heinrich Kurt Graf von Haugwitz (11 June 1752 – 1832) was a German statesman, best known for serving as Foreign Minister of Prussia during the Napoleonic Wars.

== Life ==
Haugwitz was born at Peucke near Oels, a member of the Silesian (Protestant) branch of the ancient family of Haugwitz, of which the Catholic branch was established in Moravia. He studied law, spent some time in Italy, returned to settle on his estates in Silesia, and in 1791 was elected general director of the province by the Silesian estates. Upon the request of King Frederick William II of Prussia he entered the Prussian civil service and became ambassador at Vienna in 1792. At the end of the same year he became a member of the cabinet at Berlin.

===Policy before the rise of Napoleon===
Haugwitz, who had attended the young Emperor Francis II at his coronation and been present at the conferences held at Mainz to consider the attitude of the German powers towards the French Revolution, was opposed to the attitude of the French émigrés and to any interference in the internal affairs of France. After the War of the First Coalition broke out, however, the policy of the Committee of Public Safety made peace impossible, while the strained relations between Austria and Prussia on the question of territorial compensations crippled the power of the Allies to carry the war to a successful conclusion.

It was in these circumstances that Haugwitz entered on the negotiations that resulted in the subsidy treaty between Great Britain and Prussia, and Great Britain and the Netherlands, signed at the Hague on 19 April 1794. Haugwitz, however, was not the man to direct a strong and aggressive policy; the failure of Prussia to make any effective use of the money supplied broke the patience of Pitt, and in October the denunciation by Great Britain of the Hague treaty broke the last tie that bound Prussia to the Coalition. The Peace of Basel on 5 April 1795, was mainly due to the influence of Haugwitz.

===During the Napoleonic Period===
His object was now to save the provinces on the left bank of the Rhine from being lost to the Empire. No guarantee of their maintenance had been inserted in the Basel treaty; but Haugwitz and the king hoped to preserve them by establishing the armed neutrality of northern Germany and securing its recognition by the French Republic. This policy was rendered futile by the victories of Napoleon Bonaparte and the conquest of southern Germany by the French. Haugwitz, who had continued to enjoy the confidence of the new king, Frederick William III, recognized this fact, and urged his master to join the new Second Coalition in 1798. However, the king clung to the illusion of neutrality, and Haugwitz allowed himself to be made the instrument of a policy of which he increasingly disapproved. It was not till 1803, when the king refused his urgent advice to demand the evacuation of Hanover by the French, that he tendered his resignation. In August 1804 he was replaced by Hardenberg, and retired to his estates.

===Retirement and Foreign Minister again===
In his retirement Haugwitz was still consulted, and he used all his influence against Hardenberg&#x27;s policy of a rapprochement with France. His representations had little weight, however, until Napoleon&#x27;s violation Prussian territory by marching troops through the Principality of Ansbach roused the anger of the king. Haugwitz was now once more appointed foreign minister, as Hardenberg&#x27;s colleague, and it was he who was charged to carry to Napoleon the Prussian ultimatum which was the outcome of the visit of the Tsar Alexander I to Berlin in November. But in this crisis his courage failed him; his nature was one that ever let &quot;I dare not&quot; wait upon &quot;I will&quot;; he delayed his journey pending some turn in events and to give time for the mobilization of the Duke of Brunswick&#x27;s army; he was frightened by reports of separate negotiations between Austria and Napoleon, not realizing that a bold declaration by Prussia would nip them in the bud. Napoleon, when at last they met, read him like a book and humoured his diplomatic weakness until the whole issue was decided at Austerlitz. On 15 December 1805 instead of delivering an ultimatum, Haugwitz signed a treaty of alliance at Schönbrunn which gave Hanover to Prussia in return for Ansbach, Cleves and Neuenburg.

The humiliation of Prussia and her minister was, however, not yet complete. In February 1806 Haugwitz went to Paris to ratify the Treaty of Schönbrunn and to attempt to secure some modifications in favour of Prussia. He was received with a storm of abuse by Napoleon, who insisted on tearing up the treaty and drawing up a fresh one, which doubled the amount of territory to be ceded by Prussia and forced her to a breach with Great Britain by binding her to close the Hanoverian ports to British commerce. The treaty, signed on 15 February, left Prussia wholly isolated in Europe.

===New retirement and death===
Haugwitz remained head of the Prussian Ministry of Foreign Affairs, but the course of Prussian policy was beyond his power to control. The Prussian ultimatum to Napoleon was forced upon him by overwhelming circumstances, and with the Battle of Jena, on 14 October, his political career came to an end. He accompanied the flight of the king into East Prussia, but thereafter took leave of him and retired to his Silesian estates. In 1821 he was appointed Curator of the University of Breslau; in 1820, owing to failing health, he went to live in Italy, where he remained till his death at Venice in 1832. His grave is in Este in the garden of the Villa Contarini (Este) in the Veneto.

==Terminology note==
* Regarding personal names, &quot;Graf&quot; is a German title, translated as Count, not a first or middle name. The feminine form is &quot;Gräfin&quot;.

<text>Bank of America Plaza, formerly Security Pacific Plaza, is a 55-story, class-A office skyscraper on Bunker Hill, Los Angeles, California. It was completed in 1974 with the headquarters of Security Pacific National Bank, Capital Group Companies and Sheppard, Mullin, Richter &amp; Hampton as its main tenants. The tower is the fifth tallest building in Los Angeles, and the 92nd-tallest building in the United States. In 2009 it had the highest assessed value of any office building in Los Angeles County. When it was constructed, Security Pacific Plaza was unique for Downtown Los Angeles, in that its four sides each faced true north, south, east and west. It has a total of 64 floors, 55 above ground and 9 basements, served by 30 elevators.

From when it opened in 1974 until 1992, it bore the Security Pacific Bank logo. This logo was removed when Bank of America acquired Security Pacific Bank. Featured in several motion pictures, such as being used as the fictional headquarters for &quot;Mattel&quot; in the film &quot;Barbie&quot;. Its plaza area was also filmed as that of the adjacent &quot;Peerless Building&quot; to the Glass Tower in &quot;The Towering Inferno&quot; (which was set in San Francisco), as well as the lawyer&#x27;s office in the film &quot;Pretty Woman&quot;, and as Tex Richman&#x27;s office headquarters in &quot;The Muppets&quot;. The tower was also used in establishing shots as the headquarters for the fictional company Denver-Carrington in the 1991 prime time soap opera &quot;Dynasty&quot;. The epilogue of &quot;Night of the Comet&quot; was filmed in the plaza, the tower having been prominently in the background of numerous scenes earlier in the film.

The building site is situated on that features a formal garden with over 200 trees and three waterfalls. In front of the main entrance is the &quot;Four Arches&quot; sculpture by Alexander Calder.

<text>Lane Davies (born July 31, 1951) is an American actor.

==Personal life==
Davies was born in Dalton, Georgia, the son of Emily and Bill Davies. He has three brothers—Bruce, George, and Whit. He graduated from Middle Tennessee State University with cum laude honors for his degree in speech and theater. Currently, he resides in Georgia with his family. He has two sons, Nathan Hamilton and Thatcher Lee.

==Stage roles==
On stage, Davies has worked with such companies as the Trinity Square Repertory Company of Providence, Rhode Island; Atlanta&#x27;s Alliance Theater; Houston&#x27;s Alley Theatre; The Old Globe Theater in San Diego; the Georgia Shakespeare Festival; and the Globe Playhouse in Los Angeles, as well as with the two companies he founded and co-founded. His classical credits include &quot;Henry V&quot;, &quot;Mark Antony&quot;, &quot;Hamlet&quot;, &quot;The Taming of the Shrew&quot;, &quot;Much Ado About Nothing&quot;, &quot;The Two Gentlemen of Verona&quot;, &quot;Orlando&quot;, &quot;A Midsummer Night&#x27;s Dream&quot;, &quot;Romeo &amp; Juliet&quot;, &quot;Twelfth Night&quot;, &quot;Macbeth&quot;, and &quot;Richard III&quot;, as well as the direction of several productions.

Some of his more contemporary work includes: John Barrymore in &quot;I Hate Hamlet&quot;, Sweeney Todd, Henry Higgins, Boolie in &quot;Driving Miss Daisy&quot;, David Crockett in the highly acclaimed &quot;Crockett By Himself&quot;, Slim in &quot;Of Mice and Men&quot; and William Desmond Taylor in a revival of &quot;Mack and Mabel&quot;, and 6 productions of &quot;Man of La Mancha&quot; as Cervantes/Quixote.

Davies also played the lead in such plays as &quot;Hamlet&quot;, &quot;Macbeth&quot;, &quot;The Taming of the Shrew&quot; and &quot;Cyrano de Bergerac&quot; at Thad Taylor&#x27;s Globe Playhouse. He co-starred with Matthew Faison in a revival of Rosencrantz and Guildenstern Are Dead by Tom Stoppard, playing Rosencrantz. He has directed multiple productions of &quot;A Midsummer Night&#x27;s Dream&quot;. Davies co-founded the Santa Susana Repertory Company in Thousand Oaks, California as well as the Kingsmen Shakespeare Company in cooperation with California Lutheran University. Kingsmen Shakespeare Company was listed, in 2004, as a Major Festival in the book &quot;Shakespeare Festivals Around the World&quot; by Marcus D. Gregio (Editor). In 2007–2008, Davies founded the Tennessee Shakespeare Festival in Bell Buckle, TN, as a professional summer company. Its first production was Shakespeare&#x27;s &quot;A Midsummer Night&#x27;s Dream&quot; (one of Davies&#x27; favorites) set in Athens, GA, instead of Athens, Greece. Lane is now involved in many productions in Middle Tennessee, including multiple performances with the Tennessee Repertory Theater in Nashville.

==Television roles==
Davies has appeared in lead or supporting roles in four short-lived comedies: &quot;Good &amp; Evil&quot;, &quot;Woops!&quot;, &quot;The Crew&quot;, and &quot;The Mommies&quot;. He had appeared as a feature actor on a number of shows, including &quot;Married... with Children&quot;, &quot;Major Dad&quot;, &quot;Scrubs&quot;, &quot;Seinfeld&quot;, &quot;Just Shoot Me!&quot;, and &quot;Lois &amp; Clark: The New Adventures of Superman&quot;, where he played a time-travelling sociopath named Tempus. He also had recurring roles on &quot;3rd Rock from the Sun&quot;, &quot;The Practice&quot;, &quot;Coach&quot;, &quot;Complete Savages&quot;, &quot;The Nanny&quot;, &quot;Dallas&quot; (“The Ewing Blues” as Craig Gurney), &quot;The Golden Girls&quot;, &quot;Empty Nest&quot; and &quot;Ellen&quot;.

Davies also played a role in the first Russian-American television crime drama, &quot;Russians in the City of Angels&quot;, also known as &quot;A Force of One&quot;, a new 12-part series that aired in Russia. Besides Lane, other American actors featured on the show included Eric Roberts, Gary Busey, and Sean Young as well as Russian stars such as acclaimed Russian filmmaker and actor Rodion Nahapetov, and Ekaterina Rednikova.

Davies guest-starred in a 2011 episode of &quot;Good Luck Charlie&quot;, season 2, episode 5, &quot;Duncans vs. Duncans&quot;, as Mr. Krump. He was seen most recently on &quot;Supernatural&quot; as Jack the Ripper.

===Soap opera roles===
Davies also has had a prolific body of work in daytime soap operas.

*His first role was as Evan Whyland on &quot;Days of Our Lives&quot;, which he played from 1981 to 1982.
*Davies&#x27; trademark dry, quick wit was part of what was perhaps his best known role, that of Mason Capwell on the now-defunct soap opera &quot;Santa Barbara&quot;. He played the role from the show&#x27;s debut in July 1984 until July 1989. Davies was challenged by a complicated working relationship with co-star Nancy Lee Grahn. Constant conflict over the direction of their characters led to his departure in 1989. When he first left the show, he was quoted as saying, &quot;It&#x27;s not that I&#x27;m looking for another kind of challenge as far as acting is concerned. I&#x27;m just ready for a rest more than a challenge. I&#x27;ve kind of challenged myself into an early grave.&quot; He took a six-month around-the-world tour and returned to the United States in February 1990. Davies never returned to the role of Mason Capwell.
* In 1992, he filled in for Ronn Moss as Ridge Forrester on &quot;The Bold and the Beautiful&quot; as a temporary replacement while Moss was on leave.
* Davies was cast as Dr. Cameron Lewis on &quot;General Hospital&quot; from 2002 to 2004. He again appeared opposite Grahn; the two resolved their problems and were friends, and she had joined &quot;General Hospital&quot; as lawyer Alexis Davis in 1996. However, Davies was never prominently featured during his time on the show, and his character was written out just a little over a year after he joined the show.
* Davies played the role of MacKenzie Johnson on the web series &quot;The Bay&quot; from 2010 to 2012. He replaced fellow soap actor John Callahan.
* In 2024, Davies re-joined the cast of &quot;General Hospital&quot; in the role of Fergus Byrne.

==Film roles==
His film roles include &quot;The Magic of Lassie&quot; with James Stewart, Stephanie Zimbalist, and Mickey Rooney; &quot;Body Double&quot; with Melanie Griffith; &quot;Impure Thoughts&quot; with Brad Dourif; and &quot;Funland&quot; with David L. Lander, and William Windom.

==Other achievements==
Davies has served as a member, roaming ambassador, and a Vice President of the International Federation of Festival Organizations (FIDOF), which promotes peace and friendship through music and art.

He is also actively involved in mentoring actors and teaching acting classes at various levels, including grade schools, high schools, colleges, and universities.

<text>The Corps of Royal Electrical and Mechanical Engineers (REME ) is the maintenance arm of the British Army that maintains the equipment that the Army uses. The corps is described as the &quot;British Army&#x27;s professional engineers&quot;.

==History==
Prior to REME&#x27;s formation, maintenance was the responsibility of several different corps:
* Royal Army Ordnance Corps—weapons and armoured vehicles
* Royal Engineers—engineering plant and machinery, and RE motor transport
* Royal Corps of Signals—communications equipment
* Royal Army Service Corps—other motor transport
* Royal Artillery—heavy weapons artificers

During World War II, the increase in quantity and complexity of equipment exposed the flaws in this system. Pursuant to the recommendation of a Committee on Skilled Men in the Services chaired by William Beveridge, the Corps of Royal Electrical and Mechanical Engineers was formed on 1 October 1942.

===Phase I===
Such a major re-organisation was too complex to be carried out quickly and completely in the middle of a world war. Therefore, the changeover was undertaken in two phases. In Phase I, which was implemented immediately, REME was formed on the existing framework of the RAOC Engineering Branch, strengthened by the transfer of certain technical units and tradesmen from the RE and RASC.

At the same time, a number of individual tradesmen were transferred into REME from other corps. The new corps was made responsible for repairing the technical equipment of all arms with certain major exceptions.

REME did not yet undertake:

* Those repairs that were carried out by unit tradesmen who were driver/mechanics or fitters in regiments and belonged to the unit rather than being attached to it.
* Repairs of RASC-operated vehicles, which remained the responsibility of the RASC; each RASC Transport Company had its own workshop.
* Repairs of RE specialist equipment, which remained the responsibility of the RE.

===Phase II===
In 1949, it was decided that &quot;REME Phase II&quot; should be implemented. This decision was published in Army Council Instruction 110 of 1949, and the necessary reorganisation was carried out in the various arms and services in three stages between July 1951 and January 1952. The main changes were:
* The transfer to REME of most of the unit repair responsibilities of other arms (Infantry, Royal Artillery, Royal Armoured Corps etc.).
* The provision of Light Aid Detachments for certain units that had not possessed them under the old organisation.
* The provision of new REME workshops to carry out field repairs in RASC transport companies. Maintenance of vessels of the RASC fleet whilst in port was given to the fleet repair branch, a civilian organisation which came under the REME umbrella.
This organisation was also responsible for arranging and overseeing ship refits.

===Cap badges===

After some interim designs, the badge of the Corps was formalised in June 1943 for use as the cap-badge, collar-badge, and on the buttons. It consisted of an oval Royally Crowned laurel wreath; on the wreath were four small shields at the compass points, each shield bearing one of the letters of &quot;REME&quot;. Within the wreath was a pair of calipers. Examples of these early badges can be found at the REME Museum. In 1947, the Horse and Lightning was adopted as the cap badge, designed by Stephen Gooden.

=== Major Ivan Hirst REME and Volkswagen ===
At the end of the war, the Allies occupied the major German industrial centres to decide their fate. The Volkswagen factory at Wolfsburg became part of the British Zone in June 1945 and No. 30 Workshop Control Unit, REME, assumed control in July. They operated under the overall direction of Colonel Michael McEvoy at Rhine Army Headquarters, Bad Oeynhausen. Uniquely, he had experience of the KdF Wagen in his pre-war career as a motor racing engineer; whilst attending the Berlin Motor Show in 1939, he was able to test drive one.

After visiting the Volkswagen factory, McEvoy had the idea of trying to get Volkswagen back into production to provide light transport for the occupying forces. The British Army, Red Cross and essential German services were chronically short of light vehicles. If the factory could provide them, there would be no cost to the British taxpayer and the factory could be saved. To do this, a good manager with technical experience would be needed. Maj. Ivan Hirst was told simply to &quot;take charge of&quot; the Volkswagen plant before arriving in August 1945. He had drains fixed and bomb craters filled in; land in front of the factory was given over to food production.

At first, the wartime Kubelwagen was viewed as a suitable vehicle. Once it became clear it could not be put back into production, the Volkswagen saloon or Kaefer (Beetle) was suggested. Hirst had an example delivered to Rhine Army headquarters, where it was demonstrated by Colonel McEvoy. The positive reaction led to the Military Government placing an order for 20,000 Volkswagens in September 1945.

==Museum==
The REME Museum is based at MoD Lyneham in Wiltshire.

==Training==
The Defence School of Electronic and Mechanical Engineering at MoD Lyneham meets most of the training needs of the corps.

==Units==
With minor exceptions, the Corps is responsible for the examination, modification, repair and recovery of all mechanical, electronic, electrical and optical equipment of the Army beyond the capacity of unit non-technical personnel. REME has its Regimental Headquarters co-located with 8 Training Battalion REME based in MoD Lyneham, Wiltshire. All trade training and Artificer training of electro/mechanical trades of REME and various related training to other units within the British Army, Navy and Air Force is conducted by 8 Training Battalion REME. In line with Army 2020 Refine, there are seven regular, one training and three Army Reserve battalions within REME. Alongside these major units, all battalion sized units within the army have a workshop integrated, made up of REME soldiers, called a Light Aid Detachment (LAD).

<doc id="838197" wikidata="Q5622819" url="?curid=838197" title="Guyed mast">
<text>A guyed mast is a tall thin vertical structure that depends on guy lines (diagonal tensioned cables attached to the ground or a base) for stability. The mast itself has the compressive strength to support its own weight, but does not have the shear strength to stand unsupported or bear loads. It requires guy lines to stay upright and to resist lateral (shear) forces such as wind loads. Examples include masts on sailing vessels, towers for telecommunications, meteorology, and masts on cranes, power shovels, draglines, and derricks, starting with the simple gin pole.

==Applications==
The principal applications of guyed masts are the masts of sailing vessels, guyed towers, and as the main tower of heavy equipment such as cranes, power shovels, draglines, and derricks, the simplest of which is the gin pole.

Guyed masts are frequently used for radio masts and towers. The mast can either support radio antennas (for VHF, UHF and other microwave bands) mounted at its top, or the entire structure itself can function as a mast radiator antenna (for VLF, LF, MF). In the latter case, the mast needs to be insulated from the ground. Guyed radio masts are typically tall enough that they require several sets of guy lines, 2 to 4, attached at different heights on the mast, to prevent them from buckling. An exception to multiple guys was the Blaw-Knox tower, widely used during the 1930s, whose distinctive wide diamond (rhomboidal) shape gave it the shear strength that it only required one set of guys.

Guyed masts are sometimes also used for measurement towers, to collect meteorological measurements at certain heights above ground level. Sometimes they are used as pylons (transmission towers), although their usage in agricultural areas is problematic because anchor foundations handicap ploughing. The tallest guyed tower is currently the KRDK-TV mast in Traill County, North Dakota, USA.

The mast on heavy equipment such as a crane is its main supporting tower, typically of trussed steel construction. Wire rope guys typically led back to the crane&#x27;s base stabilize it and support its ability to bear significant shear loads while lifting.

==Partially guyed tower==


A partially guyed tower is a tower structure which consists of a free-standing base, in most cases of concrete or of lattice steel, with a guyed mast on the top. The anchor base of the guyed mast can be on the top of the tower or on the ground.

===Use===
Partially guyed towers are typically used when a very high tower for FM and TV transmission is required, while also carrying antennas for directional radio services at a much lower height. In such cases the antennas for directional radio services are mounted on the top of the free-standing part of the tower, while the guyed mast on its top carry the FM and TV antennas.
They can be also used in order to upgrade small stable towers (like watertowers) with a long antenna mast for FM and TV broadcasting.
However their use is rare, and they exist chiefly in certain European countries.

Note that mast radiators which stand atop an antenna tuning hut ( helix building) are not considered partially guyed towers, because the hut is much smaller than the mast radiator. Such constructions include the Mühlacker radio transmitter and the Ismaning radio transmitter.

===Anchor placements===
Partially guyed towers can be divided into two types, depending on the placement of the guy anchors.

====Atop the free-standing tower====
Guyed masts on skyscrapers or wider towers are often guyed on the roof of the free-standing basement structure.
In such cases, there is no major constructive difference of the guyed mast to a guyed mast on plain ground, and the construction of the free-standing basement tower does not differ much from a tower of the same height without a mast. The guyed mast of such constructions is usually of lesser height than basement tower.

====On the ground====
Partially guyed towers in which at least one basement of the guy anchors is on the ground are more rare. The placement of guy basements across a broader geometric base allows for a mast much taller than the free-standing basement tower, and the integration of tower and mast should be considered in all facets of construction and maintenance.

<doc id="838202" wikidata="Q6759288" url="?curid=838202" title="Margaret Cole">
<text>Dame Margaret Isabel Cole ( [[Postgate family|Postgate]]; 6 May 1893 – 7 May 1980) was an English socialist politician, writer and poet. She wrote several detective stories jointly with her husband, G. D. H. Cole. She went on to hold important posts in London government after the Second World War.

==Life==
A daughter of John Percival Postgate and Edith (née Allen) Postgate, Margaret was educated at Roedean School and Girton College, Cambridge. While reading H. G. Wells, George Bernard Shaw and others at Girton, she came to question the Anglicanism of her upbringing and to embrace socialism after reading notable books on the subject.

Having completed her course (Cambridge did not allow women to graduate formally until 1947), Margaret became a classics teacher at St Paul&#x27;s Girls&#x27; School. Her poem &quot;The Falling Leaves&quot;, a response to the First World War, and currently on the OCR English Literature syllabus at GCSE, shows the influence of Latin poetry in its use of long and short syllables to create mimetic effects.

===Pacifist period===
During World War I, her brother Raymond Postgate sought exemption from military service as a socialist conscientious objector, but was denied recognition and jailed for refusing military orders. Her support for her brother led her to a belief in pacifism. During her subsequent campaign against conscription, she met G. D. H. Cole, whom she married in a registry office in August 1918. The couple worked together for the Fabian Society before moving to Oxford in 1924, where they both taught and wrote.

In the early 1930s, Margaret abandoned her pacifism in reaction to the suppression of socialist movements by governments in Germany and Austria and to events in the Spanish Civil War.

===Education work===
In 1941, Margaret Cole was co-opted onto the Education Committee of the London County Council, nominated by Herbert Morrison, and became a champion of comprehensive education. She was an alderman on London County Council from 1952 until the council&#x27;s abolition in 1965. She was a member of the Inner London Education Authority from its creation in 1965 until her retirement from public life in 1967.

In the 1965 New Year Honours, she was appointed an Officer of the Order of the British Empire (OBE) &quot;for political and public services&quot;. In the 1970 Queen&#x27;s Birthday Honours, she was promoted to Dame Commander of the Order of the British Empire (DBE) &quot;for services to local government and education&quot; and thereby granted the title &quot;dame&quot;.

Brian Harrison recorded an oral history interview with Cole, in July 1975, as part of the Suffrage Interviews project, titled &quot;Oral evidence on the suffragette and suffragist movements: the Brian Harrison interviews.&quot; Cole talks about her family and upbringing, her involvement in the Labour Party, and of her dislike for Christabel Pankhurst&#x27;s extreme suffragism.

Dame Margaret Cole died on 7 May 1980, the day after her 87th birthday. Her estate was valued at £137,957.

===Writings===
Cole wrote several books, including a biography of her husband. Her brother Raymond was a labour historian, journalist and novelist. She and her husband jointly authored many mystery novels.

Margaret and her husband created a partnership, but not a full marriage: her husband took little interest in sex and regarded women as a distraction from men. Nevertheless, they had a son and two daughters. Margaret Cole comprehensively documented their life together in a biography she wrote of her husband after his death.

The Coles wrote 29 detective novels together, credited as &quot;G.D.H. and M. Cole&quot;.

<text>Paul Fierlinger (born March 15, 1936, as Pavel Fierlinger) is a creator of animated films and shorts, especially animated documentaries. He is also a part-time lecturer at University of Pennsylvania School of Design.

==Early life==
Paul Fierlinger was born on March 15, 1936, in Ashiya, Japan. His father, Jan Fierlinger, was a Czechoslovak diplomat, and his uncle Zdeněk Fierlinger was a prominent figure in the Czechoslovak communist regime from 1948 until 1968. He spent the WWII years in the United States. He studied at a boarding school in Poděbrady, where his schoolmates were Miloš Forman, Ivan Passer and Václav Havel. There, at age 12 Fierlinger created his first animated film by shooting drawings from his flipbook with a 16 mm Bolex camera. His experiences of youth and the difficulties of adapting to life in America and then returning to Czechoslovakia are documented in his biopic animated film &quot;Drawn from Memory&quot;.

== European career ==
In 1955, he graduated from the School of Applied Arts in Bechyně. After two years of military service, he freelanced in Prague as a book illustrator and gag cartoonist for cultural periodicals under the pen name Fala. Fierlinger established himself in 1958 as Czechoslovakia&#x27;s first independent producer of animated films, providing 16 mm films from his home studio in Prague for Czechoslovak Television and the 16 mm division of Kratký Film. Fierlinger was one of the first animators in all of the communist countries across the Eastern Bloc to get away with privately producing animated films, which he sold to many state-run film and television studios across Czechoslovakia. Thus, he created approximately 200 films, ranging from 10-second station breaks to 10-minute theatrical releases and TV children’s shorts.

In 1967, Fierlinger moved from communist Czechoslovakia to the Netherlands for freedom, where he pitched for a number of station breaks for Dutch television in Hilversum. He then went to Paris, France to work for a short stint as a spot animator for Radio Television France and ended up in Munich, West Germany for half a year, having been offered the job of key animator on a feature film at Linda Films, &quot;The Conference of the Animals&quot;. In West Germany, prior to his departure to the United States, he married Helena Straková, a Czechoslovak compatriot and photographer.

== AR&amp;T ==
In the United States Fierlinger formed AR&amp;T Associates Inc., his own animation house, in 1971. It produced animated segments for ABC&#x27;s &quot;Harry Reasoner&quot; specials and PBS&#x27; &quot;Sesame Street&quot;, including the popular &quot;Teeny Little Super Guy&quot; series; a network ID for TVPaint; Nickelodeon; and more. Since 1971, AR&amp;T produced over 700 films, of which several hundred were television commercials. Many of these films received considerable recognition, including an Academy Award nomination for &quot;It&#x27;s So Nice to Have a Wolf Around the House&quot;. Other awards include some from the Ottawa International Animation Festival for &quot;And Then I&#x27;ll Stop&quot;, a 1989 film on drug and alcohol abuse. At that time, Paul and Helena were divorced.

== 1990s and beyond ==
Fierlinger became a steady provider of many TV commercials and sales films for US Healthcare (now Aetna), winning a variety of international awards. At this time he met and married Sandra Schuette, a fine-arts painter and printmaker at the Boston Museum of Art School and the Pennsylvania Academy of the Fine Arts. Together they developed a small series of interstitials for Nickelodeon called &quot;Amby &amp; Dexter: The Way of Silent&quot;; a &quot;Sesame Street&quot; series called &quot;Alice Kadeezenberry&quot;; and a twenty-minute film of children’s songs for the Children&#x27;s Book of the Month Club called &quot;Playtime&quot;.

During this time, Fierlinger received a commission from PBS&#x27; American Playhouse to create a one-hour-long autobiography, called &quot;Drawn from Memory&quot;.

In 1997, Fierlinger received a PEW Fellowship in the Arts award for the body of his work.

In the late 1990s, ITVS, an agency of the Corporation for Public Broadcasting, commissioned Fierlinger to create a half-hour PBS special called &quot;Still Life with Animated Dogs&quot;. This film, about dogs and other things of a divine nature, premiered on national feed March 29, 2001. The film went on to win First Prize at the 2002 International Festival of Animation in Zagreb and the Peabody Award in April 2001.

At the end of 1999, production on &quot;Still Life&quot; had to be interrupted for several months so that the Fierlingers could develop and begin the production of an animation series for Oxygen Network, &quot;Drawn from Life&quot;: two-minute films that feature the voices and simple stories of real-life women. That series won the Grand Prix of 2000 at the Ottawa International Animation Festival in Ottawa, Ontario, Canada.

The Fierlingers&#x27; own production of &quot;My Dog Tulip&quot;, based on the book of the same title by British author J. R. Ackerley, featured the voice talents of Christopher Plummer, Lynn Redgrave and Isabella Rossellini.

Paul and Sandra Fierlinger currently live and work out of their Wynnewood, Pennsylvania, home and studio.

<doc id="838215" wikidata="Q696782" url="?curid=838215" title="Friedrich Ludwig, Prince of Hohenlohe-Ingelfingen">
<text>Frederick Louis, Prince of Hohenlohe-Ingelfingen () (31 January 1746 – 15 February 1818) was a Prussian general.

== Early life ==
Frederick Louis was the eldest son of Henry August, Prince of Hohenlohe-Ingelfingen (1715-1796) and his wife, Wilhelmine Eleonore of Hohenlohe-Neuenstein-Öhringen (1717-1794). His grandfather, Christian Kraft, was a younger son of Henry Frederick, Count of Hohenlohe-Langenburg

== Biography ==
He began his military career as a boy, serving against the Prussians in the last years of the Seven Years&#x27; War. Entering the Prussian army after the peace, he was, as a result of his princely rank, at once made a major; and in 1775 he was elevated to lieutenant-colonel. In 1778 Frederick Louis took part in the War of the Bavarian Succession and at about the same time was made a colonel. Shortly before the death of King Frederick the Great, he was promoted to the rank of major general and appointed Chief of a Regiment. For some years the prince did garrison duty at Breslau, until in 1791 he was made governor of Berlin. In 1794 he commanded a corps in the Prussian army on the Rhine and distinguished himself greatly in many engagements, particularly in the Battle of Kaiserslautern on 20 September.

Frederick Louis was at this time the most popular soldier in the Prussian army. Blücher wrote of him that he was a leader of whom the Prussian army might well be proud. He succeeded his father in the principality, and acquired additional lands by his marriage with a daughter of Count von Hoym. In 1806 Frederick Louis, now a general of infantry, was appointed to command the left wing of the Prussian forces opposing Napoleon, having under him Prince Louis Ferdinand of Prussia; but, feeling that his career had been that of a prince and not that of a professional soldier, he allowed his quartermaster-general, the incompetent Oberst (Colonel) Christian Karl August Ludwig von Massenbach to influence him unduly. Disputes soon broke out between Hohenlohe and the commander-in-chief the Duke of Brunswick, the armies marched hither and thither without effective results, and finally Frederick Louis&#x27;s army was almost destroyed by Napoleon at the Battle of Jena on 14 October 1806.

The prince displayed his usual personal bravery in the battle, and managed to rally a portion of his corps near Erfurt, whence he retreated into Prussia. But the pursuers followed him up closely and Marshal Joachim Murat intercepted his corps at Prenzlau. On the morning of 28 October, a fortnight after Jena and three weeks after the beginning of hostilities, Hohenlohe refused two French demands that he surrender. However, the initial fighting went against the Prussians in the Battle of Prenzlau. Massenbach, who had gone to negotiate with the French, suddenly turned up with the news that the French completely surrounded them, which was untrue. Influenced by his chief of staff and assured by Murat &quot;on his honour&quot; that 100,000 French had encircled his forces, Hohenlohe capitulated with 10,000 men (in fact, Murat had no more than 12,000 near Prenzlau, including only 3,000 infantry).

Frederick Louis&#x27;s former popularity and influence in the army had now the worst possible effect, for the commandants of garrisons everywhere lost heart and followed his example. The capitulation of Pasewalk occurred on 29 October, the capitulation of Stettin on the night of 29–30 October, and Küstrin surrendered on 1 November. Before the month of November was over, the Siege of Magdeburg ended in a capitulation. West of the Elbe River, the Sieges of Hameln, Nienburg, and Plassenburg also ended badly for Prussia.

After two years spent as a prisoner-of-war in France, Frederick Louis retired to Sławięcice Palace (Schloss Slawentzitz) and its estates, living in self-imposed obscurity until his death. He had, in August 1806, just before the outbreak of the War of the Fourth Coalition, resigned the principality to his eldest son, not being willing to become a mediatized ruler under Württemberg suzerainty.

== Marriage and issue ==
On 8 April 1782 in Gleina, he married Countess Marie Amalie Christiane Charlotte Luise Anna von Hoym (1763-1840), daughter Count Julius Gebhard von Hoym (d. 1769) and his wife, Christiane Charlotte von Dieskau, later Princess von der Osten-Sacken (1733-1811). They had:

* Prince August of Hohenlohe-Ingelfingen; he married Louise of House of Württemberg (1789-1851) and had issue
* Princess Adelheid of Hohenlohe-Ingelfingen (1787-1858), she married Prince Georg Ludwig Moritz of Hohenlohe-Kirchberg (1786-1836), no issue
* Princess Emilie of Hohenlohe-Ingelfingen (1788-1859), she married Count Albrech August Ludwig of Erbach-Fürstenau (1787-1851) and had issue
* Prince Wilhelm Ludwig Eduard of Hohenlohe-Ingelfingen (1789-1790)
* Princess Auguste of Hohenlohe-Ingelfingen (1793-1821), she married Charles, Landgrave of Hesse-Philippsthal-Barchfeld and had issue
* Prince Ludwig Karl of Hohenlohe-Ingelfingen (1794-1794)
* Prince Adolf of Hohenlohe-Ingelfingen, married Princess Luise of Hohenlohe-Langenburg (1799-1881) and had issue
* Prince Alexander of Hohenlohe-Ingelfingen (1798-1829)

== Death ==
Frederick Louis died in Slawentzitz in Upper Silesia in 1818. He was succeeded by his sons August, Prince of Hohenlohe-Öhringen and Prince Adolf zu Hohenlohe-Ingelfingen.

<text>Tosia Altman (; 24 August 1919 – 26 May 1943) was a courier and smuggler for Hashomer Hatzair and the Jewish Combat Organization (ŻOB) during the German occupation of Poland and the Warsaw Ghetto Uprising.

Born into a well-off family of Zionist leanings, she joined Hashomer Hatzair and became part of the central leadership before the war. After the invasion of Poland, she fled with the leadership of the youth movements to Vilnius. Volunteering as a courier, she passed herself off as a Polish gentile and risked her life to visit ghettos, first to organize underground education and later to warn them of the impending mass extermination of Jews. 

After the formation of the ŻOB in the Warsaw Ghetto, Altman was appointed a liaison to the Home Army. She smuggled weapons and explosives into the ghetto and established a chapter of the ŻOB in the Kraków Ghetto. During the Warsaw Ghetto Uprising, she acted as a courier between bunkers. Seeking shelter at the command bunker at 18 Miła Street, she was one of six to escape when the Germans discovered it. Despite suffering wounds to the leg and head, Altman escaped from the ghetto via the sewers. She was captured two weeks later when the factory she was sheltering in caught fire. Severely burned, she was handed over to the Gestapo and died two days later.

==Early life==
Altman was born on 24 August 1919 to Anka and Gustaw Altman in Lipno, Poland, near the city of Włocławek. Her father, a watchmaker, owned a jewelry shop in Włocławek and the family was relatively well-off. Although her father had been raised in a Hasidic household, Altman&#x27;s parents had a liberal interpretation of the Jewish faith and encouraged Altman to study Polish and Hebrew. Influenced by her father&#x27;s General Zionist convictions, Altman studied at a Hebrew-language gymnasium and joined the Hashomer Hatzair youth movement at the age of eleven. Elected as a representative of the local branch of Hashomer Hatzair, she attended the Fourth World Convention in 1935. Inspired to immigrate to Israel, she joined a training kibbutz in Częstochowa in 1938, but Hashomer Hatzair soon appointed her to the central leadership of youth education in Warsaw.

==World War II ==

===Courier ===

Upon the invasion of Poland by Nazi Germany in September 1939, the Zionist youth movements urged their members to flee eastward to avoid the Germans. With Adam Rand, a friend from Hashomer Hatzair, Altman walked to Rovno. When the Soviet Union invaded, Altman and the youth movement leadership evacuated to Vilna, under Polish and then Lithuanian control until June 1940. Altman joined the headquarters of Hashomer Hatzair in Vilna, and helped to organize several unsuccessful attempts to send members of the youth movements illegally to Palestine.

The youth movements were concerned about their friends and relatives trapped under Nazi occupation. Because most of the leaders had fled, the remaining members of youth movements could not organize effectively. It was therefore decided to send some of the leadership back into the General Government region of occupied Poland. Altman was considered to be an inspiring leader and good at organizing. Her blonde hair and fluent Polish meant that she could easily pass as a gentile. Most youth movement couriers were women, because Jewish men could be distinguished by their circumcision.

After two failed attempts to cross the Soviet and German borders, in December 1939 she visited her family in Włocławek and returned to Warsaw, the first youth movement leader to do so. Altman traveled frequently to Galicia and Częstochowa despite restrictions on Jews traveling by train, where she attempted to organize clandestine education and even training kibbutzim. She sent postcards to youth movement leaders in Vienna, Vilna, and Switzerland, describing the suffering of the Jews under the Nazi regime. After the walling-off of the Warsaw Ghetto, her own family trapped inside, Altman continued to travel under false papers despite the fact that to be caught outside the ghetto was a capital offense. She sent food packages into the Warsaw Ghetto for her family and friends.

On 24 December 1941, Altman and Haika Grossman managed to return to the Vilna Ghetto, where they met with Abba Kovner and the leadership of the United Partisan Organization. Altman described the horrible conditions in the Warsaw Ghetto, but still urged the Zionist leaders to evacuate there since the Vilna Ghetto was being systematically depopulated in a series of massacres at Ponary. Kovner disagreed, as he believed that there was a systematic plan to exterminate all Jews under Nazi control. The youth movements decided to promulgate the word about mass killings and encourage the ghettoized Polish Jews to resist with force. On her trip back to Warsaw, Altman visited several eastern Polish ghettos, including Grodno, to pass along this message.

===Smuggling arms ===

Upon her return to Warsaw, Altman found that the Jews were unwilling to accept that they were about to be exterminated, even after reports arrived of a death camp at Chełmno. In early 1942, she collaborated with other leftist groups to establish a self-defense organization, but their efforts came to nothing because they were unable to secure any arms. In July, during the Grossaktion Warsaw and after the establishment of the Jewish Combat Organization (ŻOB), Altman, due to her Aryan appearance and Polish language skills, was appointed a liaison with the Home Army and Armia Ludowa. Although these Polish resistance organizations refused to offer any substantial help, Altman helped smuggle some grenades and explosives. Living on the Aryan side of the city, she also helped Jews escape from the ghetto and find places to hide. In a letter to Adam Rand, then in Vienna, in April 1942, she wrote, &quot;Jews are dying before my eyes and I am powerless to help. Did you ever try to shatter a wall with your head?&quot;
In September, the Grossaktion finally ceased, leaving less than 70,000 Jews in the Warsaw Ghetto, one-fifth the original population. The leadership of Hashomer Hatzair was damaged by Gestapo arrests and an explosives cache of another smuggler was detected. Altman was joined by Arie Wilner, another Hashomer Hatzair activist, in an attempt to convince the Polish resistance groups to arm them. She also continued her visits to other ghettos, this time organizing armed resistance. She was instrumental in setting up a chapter of the ŻOB in the Kraków Ghetto. In October, the Home Army recognized the ŻOB and began to provide weapons, starting in December. 

===Warsaw Ghetto Uprising and death===
In January 1943, during the next wave of deportations, the Warsaw Jews put up scattered armed resistance. The ŻOB infiltrated the Jews rounded up for deportation and launched a surprise attack on the Germans. Most were killed, but the leader, Mordechai Anielewicz, managed to escape. During the action, Altman returned to the ghetto with another female smuggler, Tema Schneiderman, to fight with the ŻOB. Both were apprehended and taken to the &quot;Umschlagplatz&quot; for deportation to Treblinka, but Altman was released by a Jewish ghetto policeman acting for Hashomer Hatzair. The resistance was partly successful: the Germans only deported 5,000 Jews, rather than the 8,000 that they had wanted to. After the January skirmish, the Home Army began to support the ŻOB in earnest, and the remaining Jews trained and built bunkers in preparation for the final liquidation. Altman and Wilner were also able to buy a few weapons on the black market. Wilner was arrested in March, but he did not betray the resistance even under torture. Afraid that the Germans had tracked her down, Altman returned to the ghetto, replaced by Yitzhak Zuckerman as liaison to the Polish resistance.

On 18 April, German forces surrounded the ghetto in preparation for its liquidation. Altman, whose function was still to relay messages, reported the initial success of the resistance to Zuckerman via telephone. On 21 April, as the Germans began to burn the ghetto, Anielewicz took refuge in a bunker at 18 Mila Street; Altman became the courier between the command bunker and another bunker where the wounded were held. She also rescued some fighters from the fires. At this time, the fighters decided to try to escape via the sewer system. When the Germans discovered the Mila Street bunker on 8 May, they filled it with gas to force the inhabitants to leave. Anielewicz and many other resistance fighters committed suicide. Altman, although wounded, was one of six who managed to escape and was found by Zivia Lubetkin and Marek Edelman, who smuggled her out to the Aryan side.

Altman hid with other Jewish fighters in a celluloid factory. On 24 May, an accidental fire broke out. Severely burned, Altman was forced into the open where she was captured by police who turned her over to the Gestapo. She died of her injuries two days later.

==Legacy==
Altman was posthumously awarded the Silver Cross of the Military Order of Virtuti Militari by the decision of the President of the Polish People&#x27;s Republic on April 1, 1948, for her merits in the underground struggle during the occupation.

She was portrayed by American actress Leelee Sobieski in the 2001 television film &quot;Uprising&quot;.

<doc id="838222" wikidata="Q523887" url="?curid=838222" title="Beijing West railway station">
<text>Beijingxi (Beijing West) railway station (), colloquially referred to as &quot;West Station&quot; (), is located in western Beijing&#x27;s Fengtai District. Opened in early 1996 after three years of construction, it was the largest railway station in Asia with an area of , before being surpassed by Shanghai Hongqiao railway station in platform capacity. The station serves in average 150,000–180,000 passengers per day with a maximum of 400,000 people per day. It was expanded during the 2000s decade, during which several platforms were added. It also has a fairly large number of car-parking spaces.

==Overview==
The construction concept of Beijing West railway station began as early as 1959. It was planned and researched three times in history, but the first two were put on hold for political and economic reasons. For the third time, in 1989, the preparatory work, adjustment planning, and re-reporting were resumed and finally approved by the state. Beijing West railway station project was jointly funded by the Beijing Municipal Government and the Ministry of Railways. It was a key project in China&#x27;s eighth five-year plan with a total investment of 6.5 billion yuan.

After the completion of the Beijing West railway station, the passenger pressure at the Beijing railway station was greatly alleviated. Beijing West station is the passenger train departure station of Beijing–Guangzhou high-speed railway, the two main railway lines in China: Beijing–Guangzhou railway (connected via the Beijing-Guangzhou railway west long link) and the Beijing–Kowloon railway, and a high-speed railway line. Most passenger trains in China&#x27;s Central South, South China, Southwest, and Northwest China depart from Beijing West Railway Station. As of May 2011, Beijing West railway station had received more than 110 trains per day, of which about 100 departed. The Beijing underground cross-city railway, which passes through the urban area of Beijing and connects to Beijing railway station, was opened to traffic on 20 March 2015.

Beijing railway station is one of the transportation hubs in Beijing. There are bus hubs in North Square and South Square. A large number of buses depart from there; a taxi rank is also built underground; and the subway station reserved for construction has been completed by the end of 2011, a transfer station between Line 7 and Line 9.

Beijing West railway station&#x27;s architectural style, building quality, design and planning have been criticised and controversial since its opening, but despite this, the station is still one of Beijing&#x27;s most eye-catching buildings. At the end of 2007, the &quot;Beijing New Landmarks Selection&quot; event sponsored by the Beijing News announced the top ten new landmarks in Beijing after the public vote in January 2008. Beijing West railway station unexpectedly took 51,335 votes, second only to the National Stadium, becoming the new landmark in Beijing with the second most votes.

==History==
===Background===
As early as the 1950s, the concept of building the second passenger-railway station for Beijing and the underground diameter line had been formed. In the autumn of 1959, when the Beijing railway station, one of the “Ten Great Buildings” erected in celebration of the 10th anniversary of the National Day of the People&#x27;s Republic of China, was just completed, the then Premier of the State Council, Zhou Enlai, during the process of reviewing the planning of Beijing&#x27;s railway, affirmed the suggestion of a west passenger station in Beijing. In the general layout of the Beijing Railway Hub revised in September 1960, the idea at the time was to use Beijing West Railway Station and Beijing Railway Station as the main passenger terminal of the hub, and may connect the two major stations through the center of Beijing through four parallel underground tunnels. The site of the West Railway Station is directly opposite the Gongzhufen (Tomb of the Princess). The Beijing Municipal Government has correspondingly reserved land for the lotus pond that was still in the suburbs in the urban master plan. Therefore, for a long period of time thereafter, the lotus pond area has been a warehouse area dominated by simple bungalows. No permanent building has been constructed. However, due to the reduction in the scale of construction during the three-year difficult period, the planning has not made much progress. The subsequent start of the Cultural Revolution led to the suspension of the overall urban planning work in Beijing and the cancellation of the planning agency.

===Planning===
====The first plan (1975–76)====
In January 1975, the first session of the 4th National People&#x27;s Congress was convened. Deng Xiaoping was elected Vice Premier of the State Council and began to preside over the daily work of the Central Committee and the State Council; Wan Li was then appointed as the Minister of Railways, responsible for rectifying the chaotic railway transportation system at that time; In March, the &quot;Decision of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China on Strengthening Railway Work&quot; was issued as a mobilization order for the comprehensive rectification of the railway, and it soon achieved results, and then proposed to build the Beijing West railway station again. At that time, the railway department and planning department were still very vague about the location and construction plan of Beijing West railway station. There was no detailed design before, and whether the planned underground diameter line was retained or not, and the technical plan was not finalized, resulting in the design of Beijing West railway station. It is difficult to decide whether to choose through or end. As agreed by the Ministry of Railways and the Beijing Municipal Government, it was decided to jointly establish a planning working group to be responsible for researching and selecting the site and construction plan of the West Railway Station. The Third Design Institute of the Ministry of Railways (now China Railway Design Group Co., Ltd.) and Beijing Architectural Design Institute (Now Beijing Architectural Design and Research Institute Co., Ltd.) were responsible for specific technical work.

After some investigation, comparison and discussion, the planning working group came up with the preliminary plan for Beijing West railway station in November 1975 and determined that the Beijing West station was a pass-through station. The station&#x27;s site is located at the southwest corner of Lianhua Bridge. The road runs northwest–southeast, adopts a triangular square, and the station faces the center of the overpass. However, the political situation changed again soon after, affected by the &quot;Counterattack the Right-Deviationist Reversal-of-Verdicts Trend&quot; in 1976, and the site plan was shelved without approval.

====The second plan (1981–85)====
Into the 1980s, with the gradual implementation of the reform and opening up policy, the pressure of China&#x27;s railway transportation infrastructure has increased greatly, and transportation capacity is tight. By 1981, Beijing&#x27;s railway passenger traffic had increased sharply, and 108 pairs of passenger trains were running every day in the central station, with an average daily passenger volume of 352,000; Beijing Station, as the largest railway passenger station in Beijing at that time, was already overloaded in operation, the annual passenger flow of Beijing Station in 1981 was 27.72 million, equivalent to 78,000 passengers per day. On 3 October 1981, the then Mayor of Beijing Jiao Ruoyu and Secretary of the Municipal Party Committee Duan Junyi reported on Beijing&#x27;s railway transport situation to Vice Premier Wan Li and talked about the design and planning of the Beijing West Railway Station. This was the third such occurrence in the history of Beijing Municipal Government. It is proposed to construct the Beijing West station as soon as possible. In early December 1981, the Beijing Railway Bureau issued a letter to the Ministry of Railways and the Beijing Municipal Government to apply for the construction of the Beijing West Railway Station, and the preliminary design was officially launched. Subsequently, the planning team headed by former Minister of Railways Lu Zhengcao, together with personnel from the Ministry of Railways, Beijing Railway Administration, and the Third Design Institute of the Ministry of Railways, conducted on-site inspections to select the site for the station. The team members once climbed the Xiaotu Mountain on the north bank of the lotus pond to get an overview of the local area. Due to the dry season at that time and the excessive extraction of groundwater in the lotus pond area over the years, more than 20 hectares of ponds were dried up, overgrown with weeds, and deserted; the design team believed that this area did not occupy arable land and there would be less demolition, which was in line with the plan and saved money. It instructed the Third Design Institute of the Ministry of Railways on the spot to arrange the West Station at this location, and the design drawings needed to be submitted within three months. After the meeting, the group forwarded the site selection opinions to the Beijing Municipal Government for comments.

====The third plan (1989–1993)====
By the end of the 1980s, the problem of tight passenger capacity in the central Beijing railway hub became more and more serious. It was more difficult to cope with demand by relying solely on one main passenger station and two auxiliary passenger station (Beijing North and Beijing South) with insufficient equipment and capacity. Those three stations have not been expanded on a large scale for more than 30 years, and the passenger volume of the Beijing area has increased four-fold from 1970 to 1988. The construction of the Beijing West railway station has become an urgent need. In February 1989, the Beijing Municipal Government again formally proposed the construction of the Beijing West station. In March of the same year, the Beijing Municipal Government led the establishment of the &quot;Beijing West Railway Station Preliminary Working Group&quot;, which convened a number of design institutes with certain strengths across the country to conduct an architectural design competition. At the same time, with the approval of the State Council, the pre-relocation works for the construction of the Beijing West station were launched during 1989. Involving the Xibianmen Goods Yard of Guang&#x27;anmen railway station and many factories and residential areas at Beijing West, the process had been large, difficult, and costly. At that time, the state&#x27;s total investment in the project was 2.3 billion yuan, with the demolition alone costing more than one billion yuan.

In March 1990, the working group compiled and reported the &quot;Beijing West Railway Station Plan and Tasks&quot;, and the Yangfangdian Road plan that reached a consensus as early as 1983 was officially &quot;thawed&quot;. Since August 1990, the architectural plans of 7 design units have been selected. After several rounds of demonstration and selection of various design plans, the implementation design plan had been determined. On 30 September 1990, the Beijing Municipal Government, the Ministry of Railways, and the Ministry of Posts and Telecommunications submitted to the State Planning Commission the document &quot;On the basis of the revised plan for the Beijing West Railway Station&quot;, and proposed an investment of 2 billion yuan. Construction started in 1991 and opened in 1993. Used, the finishing work was completed in 1994. In March 1991, the State Council formally approved the design specification of the Beijing West station.

=== Renovation and Expansion ===
The designed capacity of Beijing West Railway Station is 60 to 70 pairs of trains per day, but the actual number of trains sent during the Spring Festival peak period is as high as 90 to 100 pairs. This overload operation has caused great pressure on the already imperfect station facilities. In 2001, the Beijing Municipal Government took advantage of Beijing&#x27;s bid for the Olympic Games to launch the &quot;Beijing First Impression&quot; project aimed at the Capital Airport and its surrounding areas, as well as major railway stations in Beijing and its surrounding environment. Public facilities and places have been comprehensively renovated and renovated, but the capacity of the West Railway Station to receive and dispatch trains is still tight. In the second half of 2003, the Ministry of Railways and the Beijing Railway Bureau started the second phase project of Beijing West Railway Station, adding three platforms 7, 8 and 9 on the basis of the original 6 platforms. After the completion of the project, Beijing West Railway Station can send 137 trains daily. At the same time, a large-scale transformation of the station platform has been carried out, including improving lighting facilities, transforming awnings, and raising the platform. On October 2 of the same year, the entry-exit joint inspection hall of Beijing West Railway Station was opened for passengers of the Beijing-Kowloon through train (Z97 times), so the Beijing-Kowloon through train no longer stopped at Changping Station. The renovated Beijing West Railway Station canopy is the first large-span steel structure canopy in China.

In 2005, in anticipation of the closure of Beijing South Railway Station, the Beijing West Railway Station expanded the No. 9 platform and constructed the No. 10 platform to accommodate part of the passenger flow of Beijing South Railway Station. In addition, as part of the expansion, the canopies of platforms 1 to 7 were rebuilt at the same time, and the canopies of platforms 8 to 10 were newly built, using large-span, arc-shaped, steel truss-structured canopies without platform columns.

In February 2009, more than 13 million passengers got on and off at the Beijing West Railway Station during the 2009 Spring Festival, setting a record high since the station was established.

According to the &quot;Medium and Long-Term Railway Network Planning (2008 Adjustment)&quot;, the incoming routes of the Beijing hub have been adjusted accordingly. The Beijing Railway Hub has formed a layout of seven passenger stations including Beijing Railway Station, Beijing South Railway Station, Beijing West Railway Station, Beijing North Railway Station, Tongzhou Railway Station, Xinghuo Railway Station and Fengtai Railway Station. Due to the delay of the reconstruction and expansion plan of Fengtai Station, Beijing-Shijiazhuang Passenger Dedicated Line will be introduced to Beijing West Station in the near future, and Fengtai Station will be introduced after the new station of Fengtai Station is completed. For this reason, Beijing West Railway Station needs to carry out the largest reconstruction since its construction. The “Approval for the Preliminary Design of the Station Building Reconstruction Project” document, Beijing West Railway Station will be transformed in four aspects: the elevated waiting room, the passenger service system project, the VIP waiting room in the South Station Building, and the related transformation of the hub transfer facilities. There is a patio in the elevated waiting room between the second and ninth platforms, adding an elevated waiting space of 6,600 square meters; adding paper magnetic card ticket making machines, automatic ticket machines and necessary network equipment; adding the second floor of the South Station Ticket Center Transformed into a VIP area; and opened up the south exit of the east and west outbound passages, so that passengers can directly access the South Square transportation hub. The renovation project of the elevated waiting room was originally planned to start in early April 2012. Affected by this, a total of 159 trains were adjusted for this purpose. However, the railway department considered that the expansion of the elevated waiting room would not only have a high budgetary cost, but would also affect the erection of the elevated waiting room. Due to the inconvenience caused by the platform of the column, the renovation project of the elevated waiting room was finally cancelled, and the existing waiting room resources were used to allocate the passenger flow of the Beijing-Shijiazhuang Passenger Dedicated Line.

The Beijing Underground Diameter Line, which was proposed as early as 1959 and connects Beijing Railway Station and Beijing West Railway Station, started construction in December 2005, and was completed and opened to traffic on March 20, 2015. The underground Diameter Line enables both Beijing Railway Station and Beijing West Railway Station to receive and dispatch passenger trains from the Beijing-Harbin Line and other directions. According to the railway development plan, the capacity of Beijing West Railway Station will continue to increase year by year. It is estimated that by 2020, the number of trains arriving and departing from Beijing West Railway Station will reach 137 pairs, including 79 pairs of high-speed trains.

==Services==
===China Railway===
Beijing West railway station is a terminal for both &quot;traditional&quot; and high-speed trains. It is the Beijing terminal for most trains leaving the city for destinations in western and southwestern China, including Xi&#x27;an, Chongqing, Chengdu, Lhasa and Urumqi. Major &quot;traditional&quot; rail lines beginning at this station include the Beijing-Guangzhou railway (via Wuhan) and the Beijing–Kowloon railway (via Nanchang and Shenzhen).

Beijing West is the terminal both for the Beijing–Kowloon through train and (since the opening of the Qingzang railway in 2006) for the Beijing-Lhasa trains.

Beijing West is the northern terminal of the Beijing–Guangzhou high-speed railway as of December 2012. High-speed trains leave the station for Guangzhou and Shenzhen, as well as various destinations on the connecting lines, such as Taiyuan and Xi&#x27;an. There are, however, plans to construct a new major railway terminal (the new Fengtai railway station) in the southwestern part of Beijing, and to eventually make it the terminal for the high-speed trains on the Beijing-Guangzhou line.

The Beijing underground cross-city railway connects Beijing West with Beijing railway station.

<text>Wirt Clinton Rowland (December 1, 1878 – November 30, 1946) was an American architect best known for his work in Detroit, Michigan.

==Biography==
Rowland was born December 1, 1878, in Clinton, Michigan, to Clinton Charles and Melissa Ruth Rowland. In 1901, he landed a job as an office boy for the Detroit firm of Rogers and MacFarlane, quickly moving on to the prestigious George D. Mason firm. In 1909, he joined the office of Albert Kahn Associates, who had also apprenticed under Mason. In 1910, with the encouragement of both Mason and Kahn, Rowland attended the Harvard Graduate School of Design in Cambridge, for a year.

The combination of Rowland&#x27;s natural design talent, Harvard education, and Detroit&#x27;s healthy economy positioned him to make major contributions to the city&#x27;s architecture. Rowland is a case study in design attribution. In 1911, in the office of Kahn, he and Ernest Wilby are said have been primarily responsible for the Hill Auditorium at the University of Michigan. Through 1915, Rowland worked for the local firm of Malcomson &amp; Higginbotham. He then returned to Kahn&#x27;s office, contributing to the firm&#x27;s classic projects, namely the Harland Hatcher Graduate Library at the University of Michigan, the Detroit News Building, the First National Building (1922), and the General Motors Building (1922).

Rowland&#x27;s career peaked as Head Designer (1922–1930) of Smith, Hinchman &amp; Grylls (SmithGroup). There, he designed a dozen major structures in downtown Detroit; among these are a number of the city&#x27;s most accomplished and evocative buildings. To a large extent, Rowland helped define Detroit&#x27;s architectural genre. Of the Guardian building Rowland said, &quot;We no longer live in a leisurely age, . . What we see we must see quickly in passing, and the impression must be immediate, strong, and complete. Color has this vital power.&quot; For the Guardian Building, he had assembled a multitude of artisans, mosaicists, sculptors, painters, and tile manufacturers including sculptor Corrado Parducci, muralist Ezra Winter, and tile from the Rookwood and Pewabic pottery companies. He thus recreated the architectural synthesis of a medieval cathedral. Hence, Rowland had reached a climax, when his Union Trust/Guardian Building became known as &quot;the Cathedral of Finance.&quot;

The Guardian Building opened in 1929. With the onset of the Great Depression, most of the employees of Smith Hinchman &amp; Grylls were laid off, including Rowland. In January 1931, he joined in a partnership with his long-time friend, Augustus (Gus) O&#x27;Dell. The firm secured a small number of important commissions, including the Victor Vaughan House dormitory at the University of Michigan, Maire Elementary School in Grosse Pointe, and the Mark Twain Branch Library in Detroit, supplemented with reconstruction necessitated by the widening of Woodward Avenue, and by insurance re-valuations of existing buildings.

Beginning in 1935, Rowland was hired by Edwin S. George to design a Gothic cathedral, later known as Kirk in the Hills. The church was to have been constructed on land owned by George adjoining his suburban home in Bloomfield Hills, Michigan, however, the funds available were insufficient to proceed with construction. In 1946, George realized that by incorporating his existing suburban home into the church to house administrative activities, the cost of construction would be greatly reduced. Rowland approved of this revision, but died before he could redraw the plans. The firm of George D. Mason &amp; Co. was hired in 1947 to draw new plans for the church and oversee construction and the church was completed in 1958.

Rowland was a member of the Chandler Park Partnership, a group of nineteen architects and engineers that designed Parkside housing project (1935–1938) in Detroit. During World War II, Rowland was employed by the firm Giffels &amp; Valet in their office at Naval Station Norfolk. Among the structures he designed during that period was the David Adams Memorial Chapel and Our Lady of Victory Chapel in the base chapel building.

<doc id="838228" wikidata="Q84477" url="?curid=838228" title="Christian Karl August Ludwig von Massenbach">
<text>Christian Karl August Ludwig von Massenbach (16 April 1758 – 21 November 1827), Prussian soldier, was born at Schmalkalden, and educated at Heilbronn and Stuttgart, devoting himself chiefly to mathematics.

He became an officer of the Württemberg army in 1778, and left this for the service of Frederick the Great in 1782. The pay of his rank was small, and his appointment on the quartermaster-general&#x27;s staff made it necessary to keep two horses, so that he had to write mathematical school-books in his spare time to eke out his resources. He was far however from neglecting the science and art of war, for thus early he had begun to make his name as a theorist as well as a mathematician. After serving as instructor in mathematics to the young prince Louis, he took part with credit in the expedition into the Netherlands, and was given the order Pour le mérite.

On returning to Prussia Massenbach became mathematical instructor at the school of military engineering, leaving this post in 1792 to take part as a general staff officer in the war against France. He was awarded a prebend (sic) at Minden for his services as a topographical engineer at the Battle of Valmy, and after serving through the campaigns of 1793 and 1794 he published a number of memoirs on the military history of these years.

However, Massenbach was chiefly occupied with framing schemes for the reorganization of the then neglected general staff of the Prussian army, and many of his proposals were accepted. Bronsart von Schellendorf, in his &quot;Duties of the General Staff&quot;, says of Massenbach&#x27;s work in this connection, that the organization which he proposed and in the main carried out survived even the catastrophes of 1806-1807, and exists even now in its original outline. This must be accounted as high praise when it is remembered how much of the responsibility for these very disasters must be laid to Massenbach&#x27;s account. The permanent gain to the service due to his exertions was far more than formal, for it is to him that the general staff owes its tradition of thorough and patient individual effort. But the actual doctrine taught by Massenbach, who was now a colonel, may be summarized as the doctrine of positions carried to a ludicrous excess; the claims put forward for the general staff, that it was to prepare cut-and-dried plans of operations in peace which were to be imposed on the troop leaders in war, were derided by the responsible generals; and the memoirs on proposed plans of campaign to suit certain political combinations were worked out in quite unnecessary detail. It was noteworthy that none of the proposed plans of campaign considered France as an enemy.

In 1805 came threats of the war with Napoleon which Massenbach had strongly opposed. He was made quartermaster-general (chief of staff) to Prince Hohenlohe, over whom he soon obtained a fatal ascendancy. War was averted for a moment by the result of the Battle of Austerlitz, but it broke out in earnest in October 1806. Massenbach&#x27;s influence clouded all the Prussian operations.

The afternoon before the crushing Prussian defeat at the Battle of Jena, Massenbach convinced Hohenlohe not to drive Louis Gabriel Suchet&#x27;s division off the height to the west of Jena, which should have been an easy thing to do for the 38,000 available troops. Consequently, Napoleon was able to mass a large force on the key height the night before the 14 October battle. At the Battle of Prenzlau on 28 October, Massenbach was completely fooled by French claims that the Prussians were surrounded by overwhelming numbers. He bore a heavy responsibility for convincing Prince Hohenlohe to capitulate, when escape was still possible.

Even suggestions of disloyalty were not wanting; an attempt to try him by court-martial was only frustrated by Prince Hohenlohe&#x27;s action in taking upon himself, as commander-in-chief, the whole responsibility for Massenbach&#x27;s actions. Massenbach then retired to his estate in the Grand Duchy of Posen, and occupied himself in writing pamphlets, memoirs, and so forth. When his estates passed into the grand duchy of Warsaw, he chose to remain a Prussian subject, and on the outbreak of the war of liberation he asked in vain for a post on the Prussian staff. After the fall of Napoleon he took part in Württemberg politics, was expelled from Stuttgart and Heidelberg, and soon afterwards arrested at Frankfurt-on-the-Main, delivered over to the Prussian authorities and condemned to fourteen years fortress imprisonment for his alleged publication of state secrets in his memoirs. He was kept in prison till 1826, when Frederick William III, having recovered from an accident, pardoned those whom he considered to have wronged him most deeply. He died at his estate of Bialokoscz, Posen.

The obituary in &quot;Neuer Nekrolog der Deutschen&quot;, pt. ii. (Ilmenau, 1827) is founded on a memoir (&quot;Der Oberst C. v. Massenbach&quot;) which was published at the beginning of his imprisonment.

<text>Shadow Gallery is an American progressive metal band formed in the Lehigh Valley, Pennsylvania during the early 1980s. It was originally called Sorcerer. After changing their name to Shadow Gallery, taken from the graphic novel &quot;V for Vendetta&quot; by Alan Moore, and recording a short 8-track demo, the band was signed to Magna Carta Records in 1991. Shadow Gallery&#x27;s eponymous debut was released the following year in Japan and Europe. In mid-2005, Shadow Gallery released their fifth studio album, &quot;Room V&quot;, on the European-American independent label Inside Out.

The band has been compared to contemporary progressive metal bands Dream Theater and Symphony X. The members of Shadow Gallery have also collaborated with other progressive metal bands. Dream Theater&#x27;s James LaBrie contributed backing vocals to the song &quot;I Believe&quot;, which appeared on Shadow Gallery&#x27;s 1998 album, &quot;Tyranny&quot;, and in return Shadow Gallery members have contributed to LaBrie&#x27;s side projects, including MullMuzzler.

Shadow Gallery songs, often in the context of a concept album or story, are frequently long with extended instrumental pieces in the middle. For diversity, their music is heavy at times and mellow at others, sometimes incorporating elements of neoclassical and symphonic metal.

On October 29, 2008, lead singer Mike Baker died of a heart attack at age 45.

==Influences==
Shadow Gallery combines musical influences from virtuoso guitarists, like as Jason Becker and Al Di Meola, as well as progressive rock bands such as Rush, Yes, Genesis and Pink Floyd. The band displays heavy metal influences from outfits Black Sabbath, Iron Maiden, Queensrÿche and Judas Priest. When interviewed on the subject, Gary Wehrkamp has also added that &quot;The band likes everything from Tori Amos, to old Metallica, Alice Cooper, Gamma Ray, Type O Negative, and Nine Inch Nails.&quot;

==History==
===1985–1991: As Sorcerer===
Sorcerer originally consisted of Mike Baker, Carl Cadden-James, Ron Evans, and John Cooney. The ensemble began as a cover band, particularly interested in covering difficult to play songs by artists such as Yngwie Malmsteen and Rush. In 1985, guitarists Chris Ingles and Brendt Allman joined the band, with Ingles immediately switching to keyboard duties. At this time, Ron Evans departed in order to pursue other musical interests and goals.

===1991–1998: Debut and &quot;Carved in Stone&quot;===
After changing their name to Shadow Gallery and recording a short 8 track demo, Mike Varney eventually signed them to Magna Carta records on August 23, 1991 as the label&#x27;s second contract (the first having been Magellan). The record label&#x27;s objective had been &quot;..to bring a fresh breath of progressive rock to an audience who was subdued by larger record companies quest for typical commercial music&quot;. Impressed with Shadow Gallery&#x27;s initial demo, Varney suspected the band could help fulfill this objective.

Shadow Gallery&#x27;s eponymous debut was released the following year in Japan and Europe. However, before the arduous commitments of a supporting tour and a new studio album, the band needed to secure a stable lineup. April 1993 saw the recruitment of guitarist/keyboardist Gary Wehrkamp, originally of the band The Boxtops. Another lineup addition followed in April 1994 with drummer Kevin Soffera. With this new solidified lineup, Shadow Gallery released its second studio recording on July 11, 1995, titled &quot;Carved in Stone&quot;. However, time constraints and other commitments precluded the band from touring in support of both albums.

===1998–2001: &quot;Tyranny&quot;===
&quot;Carved in Stone&quot; was followed up by their 1998 release, &quot;Tyranny&quot; with drummer Joe Nevolo replacing Kevin Soffera. The album is a deeply political concept album, with themes including the nature of war and the military-industrial complex. &quot;Tyranny&quot; is also notable for the contributions made by a number of guest musicians. Beyond James LaBrie&#x27;s vocal contribution to &quot;I Believe,&quot; D. C. Cooper (vocalist of Royal Hunt) contributed vocals to the track &quot;New World Order,&quot; and violinist Paul Chou made a guest appearance on the tracks &quot;Spoken Words&quot; and &quot;New World Order,&quot; with the former featuring a duet between Mike Baker and Laura Jaeger. Shadow Gallery would return the favor to LaBrie in 1998 when Allman, Cadden-James, Wehrkamp and local musician/songwriter Gary Sloyer appeared on and aided in LaBrie&#x27;s musical side project, Mullmuzzler. Their debut record, &quot;Keep It to Yourself&quot;, was released by Magna Carta in the Summer of 1999.&quot;

===2001–2005: &quot;Legacy&quot;===
On April 10, 2001, the band released their fourth studio album, &quot;Legacy&quot;, which would prove to be their last under Magna Carta Records. While this album was released in between &quot;Tyranny&quot; and &quot;Room V&quot;, it had no relation to the ongoing narrative of the two albums, instead forming a collection of independent songs. The album was met with generally favorable reviews, for example &quot;Screaming in Digital&quot; wrote that:

===2005–2008: Room V===
On May 30, 2005 (Europe) and June 7, 2005 (USA) Shadow Gallery released &quot;Room V&quot;, the band&#x27;s fifth studio album and its first under new record label InsideOut and also the first album without Chris Ingles. It is a concept album, which continued the narrative set out in &quot;Tyranny&quot;. The album included Jaeger returning to perform a vocal duet on &quot;Comfort Me.&quot;

Included as a limited edition, the band also released a second disc. In addition to a multimedia segment titled &quot;The Story of Room V&quot; (that can be accessed on a computer&#x27;s CD-ROM) the album contained five extra tracks, including a Joe Nevolo drum solo (&quot;Joe&#x27;s Spotlight&quot;), an unreleased demo (entitled &quot;Memories&quot;), an acoustic version of &quot;Room V&quot;&#x27;s &quot;Rain&quot;, and a long medley covering many Pink Floyd songs titled &quot;Floydian Memories&quot;. This track is particularly notable, as it features Mark Zonder performing drums on the &quot;One in a Crowd&quot; portion of the medley, as well as Arjen Lucassen performing guest vocals and the &quot;Shine On&quot; guitar solo.

===2008–2009: Baker&#x27;s death and &quot;Digital Ghosts&quot;===
According to an email sent to the Shadow Gallery News email list on October 31, 2008, Baker died after suffering a heart attack on October 29, 2008 at the age of 45. Despite the death of Baker, Shadow Gallery continued, and their latest album, Digital Ghosts, was released on October 23, 2009 in Europe with new vocalist Brian Ashland. Wehrkamp stated on Shadow Gallery&#x27;s MySpace page:

===2010–2013: Touring===
===Since 2014: Hiatus===
On September 3, 2014, Shadow Gallery responded to a question on their Facebook page regarding a new album with: &quot;There is movement, creation, there is collaboration, preparation – words spin into music freely given, voices for the stories told, passion to share with strokes so tender, so bold – a new dream born of old. Days pass but we do not count, we are forever past the age of doubt. We will rise. We will rise. You whisper time and who will follow you?...We are working on it.&quot;

On November 29, 2015, Wehrkamp&#x27;s home and studio was destroyed by fire. Shadow Gallery subsequently posted links to their Facebook page asking fans to donate money to nonprofit organization Mady&#x27;s Angels to aid Wehrkamp and his family. In addition, a benefit concert for the Wehrkamps was held at Sherman Theater on December 26. Although Wehrkamp and his family have made a recovery since, it is unclear how this will affect the band&#x27;s progress on the new album. In June 2016, the band&#x27;s Facebook page featured new material in the making via short Periscope videos.

==Live performances==
To the chagrin of long-time fans, the band waited until 2010 to perform live, despite having been together (as Shadow Gallery) since the early 1990s. When asked the question in one interview, Wehrkamp explained that &quot;We have always been more a studio band than a performing band unfortunately, and while we rehearsed for a tour just before &quot;Tyranny&quot; was started, a few obstacles blocked our touring options, and we were locked back in the studio to make another record. I know there are many people who cannot understand why we haven&#x27;t played in support of this record, and I can see why they feel that way, but honestly, it&#x27;s very difficult.&quot;

In a more recent 2005 interview, he cited the band&#x27;s various side projects as a reason, stating that &quot;I truly think that it will maybe never happen as we all have full diaries, families, full time jobs and mortgages... I for instance give lessons and I play in 2 other bands... But we will seriously consider it this time, as it will be very difficult to get all the guys of the band together to go on tour. Besides it was never our intention in the first place to do live gigs as SG is most and for all a real studio band. Maybe, some day, never say never….&quot;

On December 17, 2009, it was announced on the band&#x27;s website they were going to make their first live appearance on the Triton Power Cruise (along with nine other bands), which was set to sail April 30 to May 3, 2010, from Miami, Florida. However, in February the cruise was cancelled due to an extreme medical crisis within the promoter&#x27;s family.

On April 17 of 2010, Shadow Gallery announced on their website they will be the headliner on Saturday, October 2, 2010 at ProgPower Europe in Baarlo, Netherlands. On July 20 a local show in Tannersville, Pennsylvania, on September 5, 2010 at Barley Creek Brewing Company was announced. This will become the band&#x27;s debut show and the opening band will be New Jersey–based progressive metal act Suspyre.

On the same day a statement appeared on the band&#x27;s website saying they would embark on a two-week European tour starting with the ProgPower Europe show on October 2. The tour is called the &quot;Shadow Gallery Live: 2010 Tour&quot; and is sponsored by Greek concert promoter Warcry Entertainment Group. Support act during most of the shows will be the Greek modern rock band Maplerun. Although all band members have performed live onstage before in other bands this will be the first tour in 20 years of their career as Shadow Gallery.

In the weeks following the initial announcement more tour dates were confirmed and as of August 23, 2010, the final European tour schedule is listed as:
* October 2, 2010 – ProgPower Europe Festival – Baarlo, Netherlands
* October 3, 2010 – House of Progression – London, England
* October 4, 2010 – Nouveau Casino – Paris, France
* October 6, 2010 – Alcatraz – Milan, Italy
* October 8, 2010 – 8Ball – Thessaloniki, Greece
* October 9, 2010 – Stage Club – Larissa, Greece
* October 10, 2010 – Kyttaro – Athens, Greece
* October 14, 2010 – MMC Club – Bratislava, Slovakia
* October 16, 2010 – Turock – Essen, Germany
* October 17, 2010 – Biebob – Vosselaar, Belgium

In an interview with the band conducted on August 22, 2010, guitarist Brendt Allman answered a question about the probability of touring again after the European dates as follows: &quot;It&#x27;s tough to say because there&#x27;s a lot of different things going on in a lot of people&#x27;s lives, but if we can do it once, we can probably do it twice.&quot;

The band has announced in 2013 that they will be playing live again. Their first announced headlining gigs are on May 5, 2013, at the U.S. progressive rock Rites of Spring festival (RoSfest) in Gettysburg, Pennsylvania, and on Friday, September 6, 2013, at the U.S. progressive metal festival ProgPower USA in Atlanta, Georgia. The month following the band heads over to Europe to perform at ProgPower Europe in Baarlo, Netherlands, on Friday, October 4. This will be Shadow Gallery&#x27;s second headlining appearance at the Dutch progressive music festival and the band has stated they will play a special two hour set.

<text>The Mission fig (also known as Black Mission or &quot;Franciscana&quot;) is a popular variety of the edible fig (&quot;Ficus carica&quot;). It was first introduced to the United States in 1768 when Franciscan missionaries planted it in San Diego. It was also planted in the subsequent missions that the Franciscans established up the California coast. Gustav Eisen writes, &quot;The early padres and missionaries in the Pacific coast States cultivated no other variety of fig&quot;. It later became the main commercial variety planted throughout California. The Mission fig was later surpassed by the Sari Lop fig (also known as Calimyrna) as the most popular commercial fig variety grown in California.

The Mission fig is a high quality fig variety. It produces both a breba and main crop, and is considered an everbearing variety when planted in the right climate. The breba crop is large. The main crop is medium-sized. It is a dark skinned fig with a strawberry colored interior. The skin of the fruit often cracks when it is ripe. The tree is long lived and grows to be quite large. It is sensitive to frost. Mission fig trees are almost always infected with Fig mosaic virus, which can affect the color and shape of leaves, but usually does not affect fruit production. It is still considered one of the highest quality figs that can be grown in USDA zones 9 and up in the United States.

<doc id="838233" wikidata="Q3816355" url="?curid=838233" title="Kongar-ool Ondar">
<text>Kongar-ool Borisovich Ondar (, &quot;Ondar Konggar-ool Boris oglu&quot;, , ; 29 March 1962 – 25 July 2013) was a master Soviet and Russian Tuvan throat singer and a member of the Great Khural of Tuva.

Ondar was born near the Khemchik River in western Tuva, in the village of Iyme. In the Central Asian tradition of self-fulfilling child naming, &quot;Kongar-ool&quot; literally translates to &quot;loud boy.&quot; In 1983 Ondar was drafted into the army, but was discharged due to a neck injury. After this, in the 1980s, he was twice thrown into prison (the first time for fighting and the second for a stabbing), serving several years in Siberia. By 1990 he was touring Europe as a member of the Tuvan State Ensemble &quot;Sayani.&quot; In 1992, he won an international throat-singing contest, which brought invitations to perform in Europe and the United States and began his singing career.

Considered a living treasure by the Republic of Tuva, Ondar was granted a stipend and an apartment for the musical skills he possessed. Jovial and personable, Ondar is probably the best-known face of &quot;khöömei&quot; () throat singing to Westerners, appearing on the &quot;Late Show with David Letterman&quot;, the Oscar-nominated documentary &quot;Genghis Blues&quot;, and in interviews for CNN and other television networks. Ondar was also a teacher and opened a Center for the Development of Tuvan Traditional Arts in Kyzyl.

Ondar is also known outside Tuva for inviting American blues musician Paul Pena to Tuva. Pena, who had learned throat singing before coming to Tuva, was the subject of the documentary &quot;Genghis Blues&quot; in which Ondar was also featured. In 1993, he performed at Frank Zappa&#x27;s eclectic &quot;garden party/soiree&quot; gathering in his last days.

He also appears on the Béla Fleck and the Flecktones albums &quot;Outbound&quot;, album/DVD &quot;Live at the Quick&quot;, and &quot;Jingle All the Way&quot;. He released one album on Warner Bros. Records, &quot;Back Tuva Future&quot;.

His first studio album, 1996&#x27;s &quot;Echoes of Tuva&quot;, was released by the TuvaMuch Music label. He released another album sampling physicist Richard Feynman titled &quot;Tuva Talk&quot;.

He died after emergency surgery for a brain hemorrhage in Kyzyl on 25 July 2013. He was 51 years old.

<doc id="838234" wikidata="Q16995947" url="?curid=838234" title="House of Joseph (LDS Church)">
<text>The House of Joseph (sometimes referred to as the [[Tribe of Joseph]]) is a designation which members of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints (LDS Church) apply to the ancient &quot;birthright&quot; tribe of the house of Israel (Jacob) as it is described in the Old Testament, made up of the tribes of Ephraim and Manasseh. The tribes&#x27; namesakes — the two sons of Joseph of Egypt — are first mentioned in . 

Members of the LDS Church believe themselves, in a general sense, to be members of the House of Israel, many of whom believe themselves also to be the literal bloodline descendants of Ephraim, Joseph of Egypt&#x27;s youngest son, but inheritor, notwithstanding, of Israel&#x27;s &quot;firstborn&quot; birthright blessings. These modern Josephites claim, however, that many in their ranks are also of the tribe of Manasseh, Joseph&#x27;s eldest son and a joint-recipient of the &#x27;double portion&#x27; of Jacob&#x27;s birthright blessing upon the heads of his grandsons. 

Church members therefore consider themselves to be a &#x27;covenant people&#x27;, specially called or &quot;foreordained&quot; from &#x27;eternity&#x27; (or before earth&#x27;s creation, which they call &#x27;premortality&#x27;, or &quot;pre-existence&quot;). They profess to attend to sacred saving ordinances as they existed anciently in God&#x27;s holy temple — &quot;the place of the covenant&quot; — with sacred responsibilities and obligations for God-given &#x27;birthright&#x27; blessings that are contingent upon upright living. 

Young people within the church are often referred to as &#x27;youth of the noble birthright&#x27; — a designation inspired by lyrics from one of the faith&#x27;s time-honored hymns.

Much of the story of the House of Joseph, according to Latter-day Saints, is reflected in ancient ancestral prophecies, including those made by the patriarch Jacob and his son, Joseph of Egypt (many of them now restored through revelation by the LDS faith&#x27;s founding prophet). But that story is also relayed in &quot;messianic&quot; Jewish tradition and legend concerning one &#x27;Messiah ben Joseph&#x27; that, for some Latter-day Saints, mirrors the earthly mission of Joseph Smith, the faith&#x27;s founder, who in the LDS worldview stands preeminent among the heirs of Joseph&#x27;s house.

The house of Joseph is mentioned in the Bible several times, notably in ; ; ; and . There is also an allusion to the house of Joseph in .

&lt;poem&gt;&quot;Let the blessing come upon the head of Joseph ...&quot; [&quot;upon&quot;] &quot;him that was separated from his brethren. His glory is like the firstling of his bullock, and his horns are like the horns of the wild-ox: with them he shall push the people together to the ends of the earth: and they are the ten thousands of Ephraim, and they are the thousands of Manasseh ...&quot; (Deut 33:16-17; &quot;see&quot; D&amp;C 110:9)

&quot;I am a father to Israel, and Ephraim is my firstborn. Hear the word of the Lord, O ye nations, and declare it in the isles afar off, and say, He that scattered Israel will gather him, as a shepherd doth his flock ...&quot; (Jer 31:9-10)

&quot;Joseph is a father to Ephraim and to all Israel in these last days ...&quot; (latter-day prophet Brigham Young, 9 Apr 1837)&lt;/poem&gt;

According to LDS doctrine, the Twelve Tribes of Israel descended from the twelve sons of the patriarch Jacob (who was later named Israel) and his two wives, Leah and Rachel, and two concubines, Zilpah and Bilhah. Jacob was the last of a line of ancient biblical patriarchs who held the full power of the &#x27;blessings of the firstborn,&#x27; of &quot;bechor&quot;. But Jacob&#x27;s firstborn by first wife Leah — Reuben — forfeited by transgression his spiritual inheritance, and it passed instead to the Patriarch&#x27;s newly sanctioned &#x27;firstborn&#x27; son by favored but second wife, Rachel. This son&#x27;s name was Joseph — a name signifying &#x27;fruitful&#x27;. 

Leah&#x27;s second and third sons — Simeon and Levi — likewise, because of murder, forfeited any birthright they may have had, and the &#x27;covenant bloodline&#x27; blessing and inheritance of the royal scepter went to Leah&#x27;s fourth, but Jacob&#x27;s first &quot;righteous&quot; son, Judah.

In Genesis, Joseph&#x27;s sons, Manasseh and Ephraim, are taken to see their dying grandfather, who has &#x27;adopted&#x27; them as his own. As with each of his own sons, Israel (Jacob) laid his hands upon the heads of his grandsons to bless them. 

But when the aged patriarch laid his left hand upon the elder grandson Manasseh&#x27;s head and his right hand on the younger Ephraim&#x27;s head, Joseph, seeing that his father had made a mistake, switched his hands. But Israel refused and said: 

&lt;poem&gt;&quot;I know it, my son, I know it: he&quot; [Manasseh] &quot;also shall become a people, and he also shall be great: but truly his younger brother&quot; [Ephraim] &quot;shall be greater than he, and his seed shall become a multitude of nations. And he blessed them that day, saying, In thee shall Israel bless, saying, God make thee as Ephraim and as Manasseh: and he set Ephraim before Manasseh ...&quot; (Gen 48:19-20).&lt;/poem&gt;

Jacob went on to further elevate the status of the descendants of Joseph&#x27;s sons to that of &quot;full tribes in their own right&quot; (Gen 41:50). To the mighty prince Joseph himself the patriarch declared:

&lt;poem&gt;&quot;Joseph is a fruitful bough, even a fruitful bough by a well; whose branches run over the wall: The archers have sorely grieved him, and shot at him, and hated him: But his bow abode in strength, and the arms of his hands were made strong by the hands of the mighty God of Jacob; (from thence is the shepherd, the Stone of Israel:) Even by the God of thy father, who shall help thee; and by the Almighty, who shall bless thee with blessings of heaven above, blessings of the deep that lieth under, blessings of the breasts, and of the womb: The blessings of thy father have prevailed above the blessings of my progenitors unto the utmost bound of the everlasting hills: they shall be on the head of Joseph, and on the crown of the head of him that was separate from his brethren ...&quot; (Gen 49:22-26 KJV)&lt;/poem&gt;

Thus, before he died, the old patriarch blessed his fourth son Judah with the kingly scepter and his eleventh (yet &#x27;anointed&#x27;) son Joseph — or rather Joseph&#x27;s second and &quot;youngest&quot; son, Ephraim, to whom it passed — with the priestly &#x27;firstborn&#x27; birthright (Gen 49:10, 22-26). This divided the blessings of God&#x27;s children into two parts — with &#x27;kingship&#x27; going to the House of Judah, and the &quot;firstborn&quot; &#x27;priesthood&#x27; inheritance going to the House of Joseph — leading to an eventual breach between the children of Judah and those of Joseph&#x27;s sons Ephraim and Manasseh. That critical breach — which widened again later with divisions between Levi and the sons of Aaron — would only be healed in a far-distant, future day, after Israel&#x27;s &#x27;scattering&#x27; (722-586 BC) and centuries-long apostate captivity among Gentile nations.

==Josephite prophecy==

&lt;poem&gt;&quot;Give ear, O Shepherd of Israel, thou that leadest Joseph like a flock; thou that dwellest between the cherubims, shine forth. Before Ephraim and Benjamin and Manasseh stir up thy strength, and come and save us ... Thou hast brought a vine out of Egypt: thou hast cast out the heathen, and planted it... to take deep root, and it filled the land ... The hills were covered with the shadow of it ... She sent out her boughs unto the sea... Return, we beseech thee, O God of hosts: look down from heaven, and behold, and visit this vine; And the vineyard which thy right hand hath planted, and the branch that thou madest strong for thyself ... Let thy hand be upon the man of thy right hand, upon the son of man whom thou madest strong for thyself... Turn us again, O Lord God of hosts, cause thy face to shine; and we shall be saved ...&quot; (Psalm 80:1-2, 8-11, 14-15, 17, 19)
&lt;/poem&gt;

In the latter days, according to LDS interpretation, the tribes of Israel were to be gathered again into one fold (the elect family of God) in the &#x27;second&#x27; promised land of Joseph&#x27;s &#x27;double portioned&#x27; inheritance — which Latter-day Saints believe is the entire American continent of North and South America (with North America serving as the latter-day &#x27;Zion&#x27;) — which God has consecrated to house, at a future day, His holy city of the &#x27;New Jerusalem&#x27;.

The Ephraimite tribe would eventually come to rule over all of Israel&#x27;s tribes (Gen 37:510; 49:22-26). God&#x27;s promises to the House of David (Judah) would also stand sure, in time, but they would be subsumed in a united mission with, and led by, Ephraim to convert the world, under the divine commission given to the house of Joseph — the salvation of God&#x27;s children (2 Sam 7:16; Psalm 89:3-4; and 1 Chron 28:4-5). All of Israel&#x27;s lost tribes, according to LDS theology, will gather to Ephraim at the end of days, for it is at the hands of Ephraim that they will receive the reward of their promises and blessings: &quot;And there shall they fall down and be crowned with glory, even in Zion [the New Jerusalem of the Americas], by the hands of the [royal birthright (priestly) Ephraimite] servants of the Lord, even the children of Ephraim. And they shall be filled with songs [temple psalms, hymns] of everlasting joy. Behold, this is the blessing of the everlasting God upon the tribes of Israel, and the richer blessing upon the head of Ephraim and his fellows [his brethren]. And they also of the tribe of Judah [the Jews], after their pain [from the captivity, exile, and persecutions of millennia], shall be sanctified in holiness before the Lord [they will participate anew in His covenant ordinances], to dwell in his presence [in a third Jerusalem temple] day and night, forever and ever&quot; (D&amp;C 133:32-35; &quot;see also&quot; vv. 25-31).

==New Jerusalem==

The Book of Mormon prophet Ether taught that a remnant of the house of Joseph would build a holy city in the Americas. Afterwards, there would be a New Jerusalem that would come down from heaven where the remnant would live. When Jesus visited the Nephites in the Americas, he taught that they were a remnant of the house of Joseph. After they were brought to the knowledge of the Lord, they would be given the Americas as their inheritance. Repentant Gentiles will assist them in building the New Jerusalem. Early Latter Day Saints interpreted these scriptures to mean that there would be a sudden and dramatic conversion of the American Indians to Mormonism. They viewed themselves as repentant Gentiles that would assist the American Indians in building the New Jerusalem, They warned Americans who did not repent would be destroyed by the American Indians to make way for the New Jerusalem, based on a scripture in the Book of Mormon that warns the Gentiles to repent, &quot;lest a remnant of the seed of Jacob shall go forth among you as a lion, and tear you in pieces, and there is none to deliver.&quot;

After some failed missions to the American Indians, the concept of the New Jerusalem started being reinterpreted. Instead of being built by the Native Americans, it was taught that the New Jerusalem was to be built by white Latter Day Saints. Instead of seeing themselves as repentant Gentiles, Latter Day Saints began seeing themselves as also being a remnant of the house of Joseph, through Ephraim. Instead of building New Jerusalem together with the Native Americans, they began seeing it as two different places, with Zion being built upon the hills and the Lamanites in the wilderness. Bruce R. McConkie, an LDS apostle taught: &quot;An occasional whiff of nonsense goes around the Church acclaiming that the Lamanites will build the temple in the New Jerusalem and that Ephraim and others will come to their assistance. This illusion is born of an inordinate love for Father Lehi&#x27;s children and of a desire to see them all become now as Samuel the Lamanite once was. The Book of Mormon passages upon which it is thought to rest have reference not to the Lamanites but to the whole house of Israel. The temple in Jackson County will be built by Ephraim, meaning the Church as it is now constituted.&quot;

== Samaritan brethren ==
Both the Samaritans and the Latter-day Saints claim Joseph as one of their ancient tribal patriarchs. In LDS interfaith relations with Jews, the Church sometimes calls its people &#x27;Joseph&#x27;, whilst calling the Jews &#x27;Judah&#x27;, emphasizing beliefs of close kinship and mutual sacred covenant. Even though Latter-day Saints do not believe themselves to be &quot;exclusively&quot; descended from these specific tribes, in their use of tribal names, they associate themselves most closely with these specific dominant tribes of &#x27;Joseph&#x27;. No denomination of Judaism affirms these Samaritan or LDS beliefs, nor similar beliefs perhaps adhered to by other faiths.

== Proposed House of Joseph ==


The Church teaches that the gathering of the descendants of Ephraim and Manasseh in the Americas fulfills the prophecy of Jacob that &quot;Joseph is a fruitful bough, even a fruitful bough by a well; whose branches run over the wall&quot; (Gen 49:22), wherein the enclosed &quot;wall&quot; of the water-filled &quot;well&quot; is understood to be an ocean-barrier of safety that separates lands. The &quot;fruitful bough&quot; suggests prosperity and an abundant grapevine that spills over the wall&#x27;s boundaries, to take root in Joseph&#x27;s &#x27;double portion&#x27; land of promise as an abundant &quot;plant of righteousness&quot; and &quot;of renown,&quot; and as the &quot;plant of a great people&quot; (1 Enoch 93:10; Ezek 34:29; 4 Ezra 9:21). With much of the tribe of Joseph gathered, it is now, by divine mandate, an Ephraimite responsibility to gather, and to &quot;receive&quot;, the rest of Israel.

===Members of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints===
The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints (LDS Church), is the largest and best known denomination within the Latter Day Saint movement (a form of Christian Restorationism). The Church is headquartered in Salt Lake City, Utah, and claims through inspired patriarchal blessings to its members throughout the world that many of these are descendants of Josephite Ephraim and Manasseh, with the tribe of Ephraim holding a responsibility of ecclesiastical leadership, but also of spearheading the Church&#x27;s worldwide missionary program in what it considers to be &#x27;the last days&#x27;. The LDS Church believes that scattered descendants of Ephraim from Europe, Scandinavia, and other parts of the world have been led by the guiding hand of God to settle in the Americas, along with the descendants of the Lamanites and others, and that the Americas are a &quot;promised land&quot; of liberty for those who have been led there.

All Church members, however — even if, through their &#x27;patriarchal blessings&#x27;, they are declared by a church patriarch to be of another Israelite tribe, or from a line of descent other than that of Ephraim, Manasseh, or Israel&#x27;s other tribes — are yet, through faith and conversion, &#x27;adopted&#x27; into the house of Israel and equally &#x27;chosen&#x27;. As such, members of the church often refer to themselves collectively as &#x27;modern Israel&#x27;. All are an integral part of the restored church and kingdom of God on earth — which, Latter-day Saints profess, is the same organization of the primitive church that existed anciently, as originally established by Christ and His apostles. 

As descendants principally, therefore, of Joseph of Egypt, and particularly of Ephraim, they believe that theirs is a special latter-day commission from God to &#x27;gather&#x27; into &#x27;one fold&#x27; the remnants of the house of Israel from the nations of the earth, according to ancient prophecy (2 Ne 9:2; 3 Ne 21:1-11, 22). But this &#x27;leadership&#x27; calling with respect to the &#x27;gathering&#x27;, as they believe, extends far beyond this fundamental Ephraimite mandate to reclaim the family of Israel, for they are to seek, as commanded by the Lord in modern revelation, the conversion of &quot;all who seek salvation&quot; in the celestial kingdom of God, who will believe on the Lord Jesus Christ, repent, and accept His &#x27;true&#x27; gospel (D&amp;C 1:30) that was, after a long &#x27;night&#x27; of apostasy, restored through &#x27;the Prophet of the Restoration,&#x27; Joseph Smith, Jr. 

Members of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, who believe themselves predominantly to be of the Ephraimite branch of the House of Joseph, assert that revelations given of God to the Prophet Joseph Smith (JST Gen 50), and as contained in the Book of Mormon (2 Ne 3), bear witness that the Patriarch Jacob&#x27;s &quot;firstborn&quot; &#x27;double portion&#x27; of both &quot;progeny&quot; and &quot;lands&quot; with which he blessed his son, Joseph of Egypt (and his &#x27;double portion&#x27;-inheriting grandsons Ephraim and Manasseh), included the additional &#x27;land&#x27; portion of the whole of the American continent — to which (c. 588 BC), from the southeastern coast of the Arabian Peninsula, a &quot;fruitful branch&quot; of Joseph&#x27;s posterity (the &#x27;Lehite Colony&#x27;, composed of descendants of both Ephraim and Manasseh) traveled by sea. The Book of Mormon professes to be the abridged history of that Josephite branch — Ezekiel&#x27;s &quot;stick of Joseph&quot; which, in its marvelous latter-day re-pairing, or re-union, with the &quot;stick of Judah,&quot; now rests, or &quot;can&quot; rest, as &#x27;one&#x27; in Israelite hands (&quot;see&quot; Ezek 37:16, 19).

=== Book of Mormon bloodlines===

The Book of Mormon frequently identifies itself as a record of Joseph&#x27;s children, with the ancient prophet Lehi (Hebrew לחי Léḥî / Lāḥî &quot;jawbone&quot;) being an Israelite of the Josephite tribe of Manasseh (Alma 10:3) and the wives of his sons, as the Prophet Joseph Smith later explained, being of the Josephite tribe of Ephraim.

In the Book of Mormon, the prophet Lehi lived around 600 BC. He and his family were residents of Jerusalem in the Kingdom of Judah under the reign of King Zedekiah. Lehi also held other property, perhaps outside the city of Jerusalem. Some have suggested that he was a merchant. Lehi had six sons: Laman, Lemuel, Sam, Nephi, Jacob, and Joseph; and at least two daughters, who were not named in the &quot;Book of Mormon&quot;. Lehi&#x27;s sons are said to be characteristically Ephrathite, though it is uncertain what this means or why this would be. Some LDS church leaders have suggested that Lehi&#x27;s wife Sariah may have descended from Ephraim, the son of Joseph. McConkie (1980) notes that Joseph Smith is reported to have said that within the Lost 116 pages Lehi&#x27;s friend, Ishmael (not to be confused with Abraham&#x27;s son Ishmael), who joined Lehi in escaping Jerusalem, was revealed to be a descendant of Ephraim. Lehi&#x27;s sons marrying Ishmael&#x27;s daughters would then explain why their descendants could have belonged to either the Tribe of Ephraim or the Tribe of Manasseh.

Shortly before the destruction of Jerusalem, Lehi and Ishmael and their families escaped, along with another man named Zoram. Lehi led them south down the Arabian Peninsula until they reached a fertile coastal region, which they named Bountiful. There, they built a ship, and sailed across the ocean to the Americas. Lehi&#x27;s sons Nephi and Laman are said to have established themselves and to have founded Israelite nations: the Nephites and the Lamanites.

==== Lamanites====

In &quot;The Book of Mormon&quot;, a &quot;Lamanite&quot; is a member of one of three main ethnic groups described in the book. The other two peoples are the Jaredites and the Nephites. The Lamanites, together with the Nephites, are described as descending from the family of Lehi, a wealthy Jewish merchant, who traveled from the Middle East c. 588 BC to the Americas by boat. The Nephites descended from a younger son, Nephi, while the Lamanites descended from the elder brothers, Laman and Lemuel. Lehi carried with them family genealogical records as well as scriptural records recorded on &quot;brass plates&quot;, which declared that his lineal descent was from the tribe of Manasseh. He later prophesied (2 Ne 3) that a latter-day Joseph, son of Joseph, descended from the house of Joseph, would do a great work that would be a blessing to Lehi&#x27;s descendants. Latter-day Saints believe that this prophecy was fulfilled in Joseph Smith through the translation of the Book of Mormon, establishing the restored Church of Jesus Christ, and initiating the &#x27;Gathering of Israel&#x27; among latter-day descendants of the tribes of Israel, particularly those from Ephraim and Manasseh.

The Book of Mormon describes many interactions between the Lamanites and the Nephites. War, trade, proselytizing all continued with varying degrees through different stages in their histories. The ethnic makeup of both peoples shifted as their story progressed. The Lamanites initially were given a darker skin color from God due to their rebellion. At one point in the book the Lamanites and Nephites unite for two centuries of peace (c. AD 30 to 230). But shortly after this period, factions reemerged, and their unity began to disintegrate with a reestablishment of economic class distinctions. The divisions were due to ideological differences rather than ethnic divides. Some time after AD 400, the Nephite culture and most if not all of its people were destroyed in a series of great wars between the Lamanites, Nephites, and the Gadianton Robbers — a renegade organization of murderous conspirators who, like the ancient Watchers, giants, and Cainites, employed a network of &quot;secret combinations&quot; and oath-bound pacts for personal and collective gain.

==== Theories about modern Lamanite descendants ====

Many Mormons consider Native Americans to be descendants of the Lamanites. Officially, The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints appears to at least partially accept this position. The introduction to the Latter Day Saint (LDS) edition of &quot;The Book of Mormon&quot; states, &quot;[T]he Lamanites ... are among the ancestors of the American Indians.&quot; However, this position of the Lamanites being among the ancestors of the American Indians is controversial. Based on genetic and archeological data, mainstream scientists have concluded that Native Americans are descended from the prehistoric inhabitants of East Asia, although mixed genetics are not precluded by either science or LDS doctrine. Thus, some Mormon scholars view Lamanites as (1) one small tribe among many in the ancient Americas, the remainder of whom were not discussed in the Book of Mormon although they were implied, (2) a tribe that intermarried with indigenous Native American cultures, or (3) those Native Americans who share the Haplogroup X Gene.

An alternate belief would be that they are fictional characters intended to portray an allegory (a similar debate concerns the Old Testament Book of Job). The Book of Mormon prophesied of great pillage and destruction by those who would find the Lamanite descendants and dominate them before a final period of &quot;carrying them upon their shoulders,&quot; implied as bringing them the &quot;fulness of the gospel&quot; and a pattern of free government. Links to various commentaries are listed on the official church website, although they do not represent official church positions.

<text>In Welsh poetry, an awdl () is a long poem in strict metre (i.e. &quot;cynghanedd&quot;). Originally, an &quot;awdl&quot; could be a relatively short poem unified by its use of a single end-rhyme (the word is related to &quot;odl&quot;, &quot;rhyme&quot;), using cynghanedd; such early &quot;awdlau&quot; are associated with the Cynfeirdd such as Aneirin and Taliesin as found in collections such as the &quot;Book of Taliesin&quot;, the &quot;Black Book of Carmarthen&quot;, the &quot;Hendregadredd Manuscript&quot; or &quot;The Red Book of Hergest&quot;. By the nineteenth century however it came to its modern definition as a long poem using at least two of the twenty-four recognised &quot;official&quot; strict forms (without the single end-rhyme).

Each year at the National Eisteddfod the bardic chair is awarded for the &quot;awdl&quot; judged worthiest; this competition is the most famous and prestigious in the Eisteddfod, and perceived to be the most difficult.

==History==
&quot;Awdlau&quot; in the early period are to be distinguished from &quot;Englynion&quot;, which are short, three or four-line stanzas. Since the recorded beginnings, &quot;awdlau&quot; were highly ornamental, and the forms permitted became stricter and stricter until the high Middle Ages. The 11th –13th centuries saw the royal court poets (Poets of the Princes) develop the art to a remarkable level of skill and accomplishment. After the extinction of Welsh royalty with the death of Llywelyn ap Gruffudd in 1282, standardisation and codification of the rules of professional poetry led to recognition of 24 strict metres, each of which must use &quot;cynghanedd&quot;. By this period, the &quot;englyn&quot; metres as well as the &quot;cywydd&quot; metres were included within the 24, and the term &quot;awdl&quot; &quot;simpliciter&quot; became used for any long poem composed in metres chosen from the permitted range, with end-rhyme staying constant within individual sections of the poem. Among those known to have used the form in the early 17th century was Dafydd Llwyd Mathau in 1611.

==Prestige==
Such poems are judged to be among the finest work a poet can aim to produce. Prizes are given at &quot;eisteddfodau&quot; for the best &quot;awdl&quot;, the most lauded being that of chair at the National Eisteddfod of Wales, held each year in August. While 19th-century &quot;awdlau&quot; could run to thousands of lines, it is unusual to find such extensive pieces these days; the National Eisteddfod limits competitors to a few hundred lines.

Perhaps the best known early &quot;awdl&quot; is an apocalyptic elegy by Gruffudd ab yr Ynad Coch, marking the death in 1282 of Llywelyn ap Gruffudd. Well known 20th-century examples include &quot;Ymadawiad Arthur&quot; by T. Gwynn Jones, and &quot;Yr Arwr&quot;, by Hedd Wyn, which won the Eisteddfod chair in 1917 shortly after the death of its author in the First World War.

<doc id="838244" wikidata="Q626066" url="?curid=838244" title="Banquet">
<text>A banquet (; ) is a formal large meal where a number of people consume food together. Banquets are traditionally held to enhance the prestige of a host, or reinforce social bonds among joint contributors. Modern examples of these purposes include a charitable gathering, a ceremony, or a celebration. They often involve speeches in honor of the topic or guest of honour.

The older English term for a lavish meal was feast, and &quot;banquet&quot; originally meant a specific and different kind of meal, often following a feast, but in a different room or even building, which concentrated on sweet foods of various kinds. These became highly fashionable as sugar became much more common in Europe at the start of the 16th century. It was a grand form of the dessert course, and special banqueting houses, often on the roof or in the grounds of large houses, were built for them. Such meals are also called a &quot;sugar collation&quot;.

== Social meanings ==
Banquets feature luxury foods, often including animal meat. Feasts can be divided into two fundamental types: solidarity (or alliance, or empowering) and promotional (or aggrandize, competitive, or diacritical). Solidarity feasts are a joint effort in which families or communities bring equivalent contributions together to reinforce the social ties of all concerned. Promotional feasts are intended to enhance the social status of the host, who provides the food to create obligations to themselves among the guests.
Feasting is related to the control of food production and often is seen as a medium for social interaction, serving as both a way to create prestige for the host and to create commonality within a community through the sharing of food.

==Historical examples==
The earliest archaeological evidence of feasting is at the Natufian site of Hilazon Tachtit Cave, where evidence suggests a feast was conducted at an elderly woman&#x27;s burial about 12,000 years ago.

Communal feasting is evidenced from the early Neolithic in Britain. In Ancient Greece, symposia formed a routine part of life, involving the celebratory drinking of wine, conversation and performances of poetry and music.

Notable historical and legendary examples of banquets include Belshazzar&#x27;s Feast, the Last Supper, the Manchu Han Imperial Feast, and mead halls.

A luau is one variety of traditional banquet originally used in Hawaii. 

Many cultures have developed structures for banquets. In the European Middle Ages, comprehensive ritualised elements were involved in a traditional three-course menu, having up to 25 dishes in each course (this structure persisted into the 19th century). The structure was later altered to two courses, with the pre-existing third course changed to the serving of fruit and nuts.

Banqueting rooms varied greatly with location, but tended to be on an intimate scale, either in a garden room, banquet hall or inside such as the small banqueting turrets in Longleat House. 

Art historians have often noted that banqueters on iconographic records of ancient Mediterranean societies almost always appear to be lying down on their left sides. One possible explanation could lie in the anatomy of the stomach and in the digestive mechanism. When lying on the left, the food has room to expand because the curvature of the stomach is enhanced in that position.

== Contemporary examples ==
Contemporary banquets serve many new purposes in addition to their traditional purposes. These can include anything from during workplace training sessions and formal business dinners to birthday parties and social gatherings. It is common for a banquet to be organized at the end of academic conferences. 

== Government intervention ==
The State Council of the People&#x27;s Republic of China levied a tax on banquets on September 2, 1988, at a tax rate calculated per occasion between 15% and 20% of the banquet&#x27;s value.

<doc id="838246" wikidata="Q1761282" url="?curid=838246" title="Mclusky">
<text>Mclusky (often stylized as mclusky), originally known as Best, are a British post-hardcore band formed in Cardiff in 1996. The group originally consisted of Andrew Falkous (vocals, guitar), originally from Newcastle upon Tyne, Geraint Bevan (bass) and Matthew Harding (drums); the latter two were replaced by Jonathan Chapple and Jack Egglestone in 1997 and late 2003 respectively. The band released three studio albums before splitting in 2004, reconvening in 2014 – without Chapple – under the monikers ″mclusky″ and mclusky*, before ultimately dropping the asterisk.

==History==
According to the band, they originally formed in 1996 when Falkous and Harding met at the Blackwood Miners Institute, a venue in their home town. The pair met Chapple a short time afterwards at the Reading Festival when they caught him urinating on their tent late in the night.

More realistically it has been suggested that Falkous and Harding met when working together at Anglian Windows, a small double-glazing call centre in Cardiff. They discussed their musical ambitions after a conversation about Reading Festival, Falkous gave Harding a tape of songs he had written on his own, and shortly after they formed a band called Best after early Beatles drummer Pete Best. The original bass player for Best was Geraint Bevan, Harding&#x27;s old musical comrade from The Derelicts.

Best existed in this form for almost a year before Bevan left to concentrate on his acting career, but not before Best had played a show with a band called &#x27;Myrtle&#x27;, which featured the bass guitarist Jon Chapple.

Shortly after the departure of Bevan, the remaining two members managed to convince Chapple to join the band; this was based on the strength of the three track demo Best had recently finished at &#x27;Ocean Studios&#x27; in Cardiff (this cassette – which was sold by the band themselves – was the unofficial debut, entitled the &quot;Benedict EP&quot;).

Best signed to London label Seriously Groovy and released their official debut record, the 3-track single &quot;Huwuno&quot;.

The band changed its name to Mclusky in 1999, releasing their first full-length album &quot;My Pain and Sadness is More Sad and Painful Than Yours&quot; in 2000 on the Fuzzbox imprint before drawing international attention with their critically praised second album &quot;Mclusky Do Dallas&quot; in 2002. In 2004 they released their third album &quot;The Difference Between Me and You Is That I&#x27;m Not on Fire&quot; to positive reviews.

They worked frequently with recording engineer Steve Albini.

===Breakup===
The band called it quits on 7 January 2005, with Falkous making the following announcement on the band&#x27;s website three days later:

:The three piece rock band known as mclusky have disbanded, as of Friday 7 January 2005. The reason for this parting is private, though probably not as entertaining as you&#x27;d imagine. Personally, I would like to thank all the people, places and times that occurred on or near us. I&#x27;m grateful for the love and to a lesser degree, the hate. There&#x27;ll be more music soon, from all of us.

Little was said of the reasons behind Mclusky&#x27;s split, but it later emerged that tensions had arisen between Falkous and Chapple. The root of these tensions can be traced back to an incident in 2004 when all of the band&#x27;s equipment was stolen on the Arizona leg of their American tour (this equipment – worth over £5000 – was never recovered).

===New bands and reunion===
A compilation of the band&#x27;s singles, &quot;Mcluskyism&quot;, came out in February 2006; a limited-edition version came with two additional CDs of B-sides (labelled as B-sides and C-sides), rarities and live recordings from their final headline performance at the University of London Union (The band would make one further live appearance on 01/12/04 supporting Shellac at the Scala in London). This compilation is, without doubt, the final chapter in Mclusky&#x27;s nine-year saga, as Falkous informs in the &quot;Mcluskyism&quot; liner notes, &quot;that&#x27;s it, then. No farewell tour... no premature deaths (at time of writing), no live DVDs...&quot;

The first Mclusky member to release material after the band&#x27;s demise was Chapple, with his outfit Shooting at Unarmed Men – Chapple had dabbled with the band as a side project to Mclusky in the years prior, and wasted little time in making it his first priority after Mclusky disbanded. The band released two albums before Chapple emigrated to Australia in 2006. He has since revived the band in Australia with a new lineup, and released another album with the Australian lineup. Shooting at Unarmed Men disbanded shortly after the release of &quot;With The Youthful Energy of a Zealot&quot;. Chapple played drums with Melbourne band Poor People until 2012, and played bass and provided backing vocals for the six-piece outfit Harmony, which also featured Tom Lyngcoln of The Nation Blue.

After Falkous had conducted a handful of interviews discussing the then-fresh Mclusky breakup, he and Egglestone were not heard from publicly for a number of months. Almost immediately, rumours began to swell that the pair were collaborating with some members of also-defunct Cardiff noise-core act Jarcrew (the project, which received no official title for eighteen months, was jokingly referred to as &quot;Jarclusky&quot;) – however, the full extent of the collaboration was not known until Falkous created an unassuming MySpace page for the group under the name Future of the Left, complete with unpolished recordings of the band&#x27;s first songs. The outfit have since incorporated members of now-defunct British punk rock act Million Dead, and have (after several years of resistance from Falkous) started including Mclusky tracks in their live sets.

In 2014, Falkous announced a benefit gig to help save venue Le Pub in Newport, with a lineup consisting of Jarcrew and a set of mclusky songs played by Falkous and Jack Egglestone, joined by future of the left bassist Julia Ruzicka and Damien Sayell, vocalist of Bristol band The St. Pierre Snake Invasion. This lineup has been referred to by Falco as &#x27;mclusky&#x27; (with inverted commas) and announced a second concert at Clwb Ifor Bach upon the quick sale of all tickets for the Newport event. Since, they have played another &#x27;closing venue&#x27; benefit gig, in London at the soon-to-close Buffalo Bar. The following year, mclusky were announced alongside future of the left in the lineup of British music festival 2000trees.

Then known as Mclusky* (the asterisk in reference to missing members), the band reformed to play The Garage in London on 3 December 2015 to raise money for cancer research with Rat the Magnificent (featuring Ian Catskilkin of Art Brut). The band have continued to play since, with Sayell ultimately being brought in as bassist as well as a vocalist. In July 2020, Falkous announced plans to record a new Mclusky album. The asterisk was ultimately dropped, confirming the return to the official moniker.

In April 2022, the band announced a commemorative 20-year anniversary tour of &quot;Mclusky Do Dallas&quot;. This tour, along with the band&#x27;s Australian dates, was later postponed to early 2024 due to a health issue for Falkous. 

In September 2023, the band released a four-track EP – their first new music in 19 years – entitled &quot;unpopular parts of a pig&quot;. Its title track, as well as the second track &quot;the digger you deep&quot;, were said at the time to be lifted from the band&#x27;s fourth studio album. This was ultimately confirmed in February 2025, when the band formally announced the album, &quot;The World is Still Here and So Are We&quot;.

<doc id="838249" wikidata="Q1637009" url="?curid=838249" title="Felicity Party">
<text>The Felicity Party (, SAADET) is an Islamist Turkish political party. It was founded in 2001, and mainly supported by conservative Muslims in Turkey.

It was founded on 20 July 2001 after the Virtue Party (FP) was banned by the Constitutional Court. While the party&#x27;s reformist wing formed the Justice and Development Party (AKP), the hardliners founded the Felicity Party. Although an Islamist party, its policy platform covers the whole span of political issues in Turkey.

The Felicity Party&#x27;s vote has been weakened by the success of the moderately Islamic Justice and Development Party government. It has repeatedly condemned the Turkish government&#x27;s desire to join the European Union, and relationship with Israel and the United States. It has argued that Turkey must adapt its military and foreign policy stance to meet what it argues are increasing threats coming from the West to all Muslim countries. The Party&#x27;s platform is based strongly around Necmettin Erbakan&#x27;s ideas and philosophy.

==History==
The Felicity Party has not been particularly successful electorally, polling just 2.5% of the vote in the 2002 general elections, thereby failing to pass the 10% threshold necessary to gain representation in the Turkish Grand National Assembly. It was slightly more successful in the local elections of 29 March 2004, winning 4.1% of the vote and a number of mayoralties, although none of any particular significance. In the 2011 election they were reduced to 1.24% on the vote. During the period, Recai Kutan (20 July 2001 – 11 May 2003 and again 30 January 2004 – 29 March 2008), Necmettin Erbakan (11 May 2003 – 30 January 2004 and again from 17 October 2010 till his death on 27 February 2011) and Numan Kurtulmuş (26 October 2008 – 1 October 2010) were leaders. In June 2015 elections it won 2.06% of the votes.

=== National Alliance ===
In preparation for the June 2015 general election, the Felicity Party stated that it was open to negotiate an electoral alliance with other parties such as the Great Union Party (BBP) and the larger Nationalist Movement Party (MHP). Although the MHP later announced that it was not willing to form an electoral alliance, the Felicity Party (SP) and BBP agreed upon a new alliance in order to increase their chances of surpassing the election threshold of 10% to gain representation in Parliament. The new alliance was named the National Alliance &quot;(Millî İttifak)&quot;.

The Nation and Justice Party (MİLAD) also expressed their intention to join the alliance, but when they were only given top spots on the candidate lists in only 4 electoral districts, MİLAD withdrew and was unable to contest the election for not sending their own party lists to the Supreme Electoral Council on time.

The candidate lists were drawn up such that BBP candidates were placed top in electoral districts in which they won more votes than the SP in 2011, while SP candidates were placed top in provinces in which the SP had beaten the BBP in 2011. This meant that an SP candidate was placed first in 55 provinces, while a BBP candidate was placed first in 30. The remaining positions subsequently alternated between SP and BBP candidates. SP leader Mustafa Kamalak was selected as the first candidate for İstanbul&#x27;s 1st electoral district while BBP leader Mustafa Destici was selected as the first candidate for Ankara&#x27;s 2nd electoral district.

=== Nation Alliance ===

The party participated in the Nation Alliance in the 2018 general elections with the Republican People&#x27;s Party (CHP), Good Party (İYİ), and Democrat Party (DP).

In 2022, the party took part in the establishment of the Table of Six. It received 10 deputies from CHP&#x27;s list in the 2023 parliamentary election, and supported Kemal Kılıçdaroğlu&#x27;s candidacy in the 2023 presidential election. 

=== Since 2023 ===
On July 6, 2023, SP and the Future Party formed a parliamentary group under SP&#x27;s banner, and competed in the 2024 local election in an electoral alliance. Saadet received 1.09%, and Gelecek 0.07%, of the electorate.

== Political positions ==
The Felicity Party works both as a political party and an enormous social organization. It has party branches in nearly every district, small town and city in the country.

In the past, it has organized demonstrations on a wide range of issues, often involving tens of thousands of participants. Thousands of protesters joined SP organized demonstrations against the 2004 attack on Fallujah, against the cartoons of Muhammad in newspapers around the world, and Israel&#x27;s invasion of Gaza during the 2008–2009 Israel–Gaza conflict. SP has criticized the Trump administration over attacks against Iranian forces, and condemned both the assassination of Jamal Khashoggi and the assassination of Qasem Soleimani.

SP has been accused by Arab and pro-government commentators of pursuing pro-Iranian views due to former SP leader Mustafa Kamalak&#x27;s comments and visits to Iran.

<doc id="838254" wikidata="Q234171" url="?curid=838254" title="Princess Lilian, Duchess of Halland">
<text>Princess Lilian of Sweden, Duchess of Halland (born Lillian May Davies, later Craig; 30 August 1915 – 10 March 2013), was a British fashion model who became a member of the Swedish royal family through her 1976 marriage to Prince Bertil, Duke of Halland (1912–1997). As such, she was an aunt of King Carl XVI Gustaf of Sweden and Queen Margrethe II of Denmark.

==Biography==

===Early life===
Lillian May Davies was born on 30 August 1915, in Swansea, Wales, the daughter of William John Davies, who had a market stall after working in a coal mine, and his wife Gladys Mary (née Curran), a shop assistant. The site of the terraced house where they lived is now beneath the Quadrant Shopping Centre. Her parents separated in the 1920s, but they were not divorced until 1939. She moved to London when she was 16. She dropped one &#x27;l&#x27; from her first name when she became a fashion model. She was photographed for magazines such as &quot;Vogue&quot;. 

In 1940 Lilian married the Scottish actor Ivan Craig (1912–1995) in Horsham, West Sussex. Shortly after their wedding, Craig joined the British Army and left for Africa, where he saw active service during the Second World War. In his absence, Lilian worked in a factory that made radios for the Royal Navy and at a hospital for wounded soldiers.

===Marriage to Prince Bertil of Sweden===
In 1943, she met the Swedish Prince Bertil, Duke of Halland, in London, reportedly at a cocktail party for her 28th birthday. Soon after their meeting, they became lovers although she was still married to Craig. When she and her husband were reunited after the war, Craig expressed his wish to marry another woman, and they were amicably divorced on 7 November 1947.

Bertil&#x27;s older brother, Prince Gustaf Adolf, Duke of Västerbotten, was second in line to the Swedish throne; but he died in 1947. As Gustaf Adolf&#x27;s son, Carl Gustaf, was less than one year old, it seemed likely that, when Bertil&#x27;s grandfather, King Gustaf V, and father (Crown Prince Gustaf Adolf, the future King Gustaf VI Adolf) died, he would have to serve as regent (other heirs having given up their places in the line of succession because of marriages not acceptable to the king). For this reason, Bertil chose not to marry Lilian, so the couple simply lived together discreetly for more than thirty years. In 1946, Prince Bertil acquired a house in Sainte-Maxime, France, that became their private retreat.

Bertil never had to become regent, since his father, who ascended the throne in 1950, lived long enough to see his grandson, Carl Gustaf, come of age. Carl XVI Gustaf of Sweden ascended the throne in 1973, and, having married a commoner himself, he approved Bertil&#x27;s and Lilian&#x27;s marriage, meaning that Bertil would be able to keep his titles and place in the line of succession, and that Lillian would become a princess. They were married on 7 December 1976 at the church of Drottningholm Palace in the presence of the king and the queen.

====Widowhood====
Prince Bertil died on 5 January 1997 in their home. From 1997 until 2010, Lilian continued to represent the royal family at various engagements and other occasions. She was the patron of many organizations. In 2000, Lilian released a biography of her life with Bertil.

In August 2008, Lilian fell and broke her femur in her apartment; and, in February 2009, she again suffered a fall in her home. It was announced on 3 June 2010, that Lilian was afflicted with Alzheimer&#x27;s disease and was no longer able to appear in public. She lived her final years at Villa Solbacken, her longtime home in the Djurgården area of Stockholm, attended by three nurses.
Lilian died in Stockholm on 10 March 2013, aged 97, sixteen years after her husband. The Royal Palace did not give a cause of death, but she had been in poor health for several years. Her death came as the royal family was preparing for Princess Madeleine&#x27;s wedding, and the family interrupted what they were doing to spend her last moments together with her.

Her 16 March funeral was broadcast live on SVT. It was attended by her nephew and niece-in-law the King and the Queen of Sweden; her nieces the Queen of Denmark, Princess Margaretha, Princess Birgitta, Princess Désirée, and Princess Christina; her grandnieces Crown Princess Victoria and Princess Madeleine; and her grandnephew and grandnephew-in-law Prince Carl Philip and Prince Daniel. Princess Astrid of Norway was also in attendance, as were her friends Roger Moore and his Swedish wife Kiki Tholstrup.

<doc id="838255" wikidata="Q1549416" url="?curid=838255" title="Grand Cross">
<text>Grand Cross is the highest class in many orders, and manifested in its insignia. Exceptionally, the highest class may be referred to as Grand Cordon or equivalent. In other cases, there may exist a rank even higher than Grand Cross, e.g. Grand Collar. In rare cases, the insignia itself is referred to as the &quot;grand cross&quot;.

In international relations, many times the class of Grand Cross is typically reserved for royalty, heads of state and equivalent. Sometimes a holder of the highest class or grade are referred to as &quot;Commander Grand Cross&quot;, &quot;Knight Grand Cross&quot;, or just &quot;Grand Cross&quot;.

In the United Kingdom, the rank of &quot;Knight Grand Cross&quot; or &quot;Dame Grand Cross&quot; allows the recipient to continue to use the honorific &quot;Sir&quot; (male) or &quot;Dame&quot; (female) as a style before his or her name. The knighthood is initially conferred, as in other countries, at the lower rank of the order, typically &quot;Knight Commander&quot;. 

In Bavaria, the royal military order established by Maximilian Joseph consisted of three classes with the Grand Crosses ranking above the Commanders and Knights. The Grand Cross title has also been used to confer military merit. For instance, the Grand Duchy of Baden awarded Prince Rupprecht a Grand Cross after World War I. 

From 1870 to 1918, the German Empire also set the Grand Cross as the highest rank of the Order of the Iron Cross, followed by the first and second classes.

<text>Figurational sociology is a research tradition in which figurations of humans—evolving networks of interdependent humans—are the unit of investigation. Although more a methodological stance than a determinate school of practice, the tradition has one essential feature:

* Concern for &quot;process&quot;, not &quot;state&quot;. Figurational sociology is also referred to as process sociology. This feature is an attempt to correct for an in-built language prejudice which tilts theory to reduce processes into static elements, separating, for example, human actors from their actions. Just as linguists rely on etymology to gain a rich understanding of a word&#x27;s history, which may help to understand its later uses, figurational sociologists attempt to look at the process of a social feature&#x27;s emergence and evolution to gain a fuller understanding of its function in the present.

Practitioners may be said to be inspired by the ideal that the usual humanities barrier between micro (e.g. psychological) and macro (e.g. state organization) is removed, and their causal links opened to examination. As a consequence, much of the work done in the name of this approach has examined the connection between changes in psychology and personhood, on the one hand, and changes in macro social structures on the other. 

Norbert Elias is usually acknowledged as an early or primary practitioner, as a consequence of his ground-breaking 1939 work &quot;The Civilizing Process&quot;.

<text>Karnal () is a city located in the state of Haryana, India and is the administrative headquarters of Karnal District. The city is well connected as it lies on National Highway 01, in the south of the city lies the cities of Panipat and Sonipat and in the north lies Kurukshetra and Yamunanagar city while in the east lies the river Yamuna, on the other end of which lies Saharanpur and Shamli district of Uttar Pradesh on the eastern bank. Karnal was used by the East India Company army as a refuge during the Indian Rebellion of 1857 in Delhi. The Battle of Karnal between Nader Shah of Persia and the Mughal Empire took place in this city in 1739.

==Etymology==
The city associates itself with the character Karna from the Indian epic Mahabharata.

== History ==
=== Ancient ===
At the end of 6th century A.D., the area was under the rule of the Vardhanas of Thanesar. The 7th century was a period of religious eclecticism, as Buddhism was declining and Hinduism was resurging in the Indo-Gangetic plains. The region was under Kanauji rule under the Pala Emperors of Bengal from 770 to 810 AD. The authority of Mihira Bhoja, the Pratihara ruler of Kanauj from 836 to 885 AD, penetrated as far as Pehowa, including Karnal.

=== Medieval ===
The Tomaras, established themselves as rulers of this region in the middle of the 9th century. About the beginning of the 10th century, as the Pratihara power began to decline, the Tomaras assumed independence. One of the Tomara rulers, Anangpal Tomar, found the city of Delhi and made it his capital, with the area of Karnal and modern-day Haryana being under his realm. The Tomaras came into conflict with the Chauhans of Ajmer, but continued to rule the Haryana country until the middle of 12th century when they were overthrown by the Chaha mana Vighnaraja IV. The country between the Satluj and the Yamuna including Karnal experienced relative peace for a century and a half except the plundering invasions and eventual conquests of Mahmud of Ghazi. The region then came under Ghurid rule after the Second Battle of Tarain when Muhammad Ghori captured the area. It remained under the Delhi Sultanate until 1526.

In 1526 at the First Battle of Panipat, Mughal emperor Babur defeated the Sultan of Delhi, Ibrahim Lodi, and captured parts of North India, along with Delhi and Panipat. He then established the Mughal Empire in North India.

Karnal is listed in the Mughal Ain-i-Akbari as a pargana under Delhi sarkar, producing a revenue of 5,678,242 dams for the imperial treasury and supplying a force of 800 infantry and 50 cavalry.

In A.D. 1739, Nader Shah of Persia invaded the Mughal empire and Karnal was the scene of the famed Battle of Karnal, in which Nader Shah decisively defeated the Mughal Emperor, Muhammad Shah. Muhammad Shah along with an enormous army occupied a strongly fortified camp at Karnal, but he yielded to the invader as his supplies were cut off from the open country by Shah and was starved into submission. The tactical defeat drastically weakened the Mughal Empire, while the Persian Empire prospered and subsequently hastened the establishment of the British Empire in India. The region then came under Afghan rule. On 24 Feb1739, the Iranian ruler Nadir Shah attacked India. Rao Bal Kishan, with his army and with the forces of Delhi, fought Nadir Shah. His army included 5000 infantry and 2000 cavalry. In February 1739, Nader Shah captured Sirhind and moved towards the field of Karnal, a battle destined to be fateful to the Mughal rulers. Every year on 24 Feb, Rao Bal Kishan Shaurya Diwas celebrated in Rewari.

Sikhs appeared on the scene in the 18th century. The importance of Karnal grew in the time of Raja Gajpat Singh of Jind State who after its capture in A.D. 1763 built the boundary wall and a fort and under whose rule the town increased considerably in size. On 14 January 1764, Sikh Chiefs defeated and killed Zain Khan Sirhindi, the Durrani Governor, and took possession of the whole of Sirhind province as far south as Panipat including Karnal.

=== Modern ===
During the Indian independence movement, a district political conference was organized at Karnal with Lala Lajpat Rai as its chairman.

==Climate==
==Demographics==
The population of the city as of 2011, is 302,140.


The sex ratio in Karnal stood at 915 females per 1000 males in 2011, compared to the 2001 census figure of 862.

==Government==
Karnal Municipal Corporation is the municipal corporation governing Indian city of Karnal. The mayor of the city currently is Renu Bala Gupta and the municipal commissioner is Naresh Narwal, IAS.
===Politics===
The city is part of the Karnal Assembly constituency and jagmohan anand of BJP is the current MLA from Karnal constituency.

Manohar Lal Khattar of BJP is the current elected MP from the Karnal Lok Sabha constituency.

<doc id="838263" wikidata="Q1239326" url="?curid=838263" title="Monolith Soft">
<text>trading as Monolith Soft, is a Japanese video game development studio originally owned by Namco (later Bandai Namco) until being bought out by Nintendo in 2007, best known for the &quot;Xenoblade Chronicles&quot; series of games. The company was founded in 1999 by Tetsuya Takahashi with the support and cooperation of Masaya Nakamura, the founder of Namco. Their first project was the &quot;Xenosaga&quot; series, a spiritual successor to the Square-developed &quot;Xenogears&quot;. Multiple Square staff would join Takahashi at Monolith Soft including Hirohide Sugiura and Yasuyuki Honne.

In addition to the &quot;Xenosaga&quot; series, Monolith Soft worked on other projects including &quot;Baten Kaitos&quot; and &quot;Namco × Capcom&quot;, the precursor to their later &quot;Project X Zone&quot; series, along with assisting on projects from other developers. While several of its games have released on the PlayStation 2, the majority of its games have released on Nintendo platforms following the acquisition. 

As of 2022, Monolith Soft operates in three locations in Japan; its main office in Meguro, Tokyo and the secondary Osaki Studio similarly based in Tokyo, who produce the company&#x27;s original video game properties; and a studio in Kyoto with mainly artists as its employees, which acts as an assisting developer for both Monolith Soft Tokyo and for some Nintendo internal franchises. According to an interview published on the website of the company in February 2022, Monolith Soft&#x27;s Kyoto studio has over 30 employees, which would leave the Tokyo studios with roughly 230 staff in total.

The design approaches of Monolith Soft have shifted over its lifetime, with early games such as &quot;Xenosaga&quot; and &quot;Baten Kaitos&quot; being distinguished by a narrative-heavy approach, while later games have focused more on gameplay. The company&#x27;s stated goals are to create projects with wide creative freedom and to allow younger developers to contribute to these projects. The company is also notable for its focus on promoting a comfortable working environment with little to no overtime in contrast to the majority of other Japanese game developers, alongside collaborating with other studios and companies.

==History==
===Origins===
Monolith Soft was founded by Tetsuya Takahashi, a developer who had previously worked at Nihon Falcom and later at Square, in which the latter was merged into Enix in 2003 to form Square Enix. While at Square, he and his wife Kaori Tanaka (also known as Soraya Saga) would contribute to the development of multiple games including entries in the &quot;Final Fantasy&quot; series. Following their work on &quot;Final Fantasy VI&quot;, Takahashi and Tanaka created a proposal for &quot;Final Fantasy VII&quot;; while deemed too dark for the &quot;Final Fantasy&quot; series, they were allowed to develop it as their own project titled &quot;Xenogears&quot;. Takahashi&#x27;s ambition and drive prompted &quot;Final Fantasy&quot; creator Hironobu Sakaguchi, then Executive Vice President at Square, to appoint him as director. Takahashi also wrote the script with Tanaka. Following the release of &quot;Xenogears&quot;, Takahashi became dissatisfied with Square&#x27;s business approach at the time, which prioritized their major intellectual properties including &quot;Final Fantasy&quot;. This left Takahashi with no funding or creative room to develop further independent projects or continue his planned &quot;Xenogears&quot; series.

In 1999, Takahashi talked with Hirohide Sugiura, who had likewise worked at Square and was beginning to feel frustrated due to a lack of creative freedom. After discussing the matter, the two decided to create their own company and pursue projects they wanted to create. When planning their new company, Takahashi and Sugiura decided that they needed a publisher with substantial market presence to help them rather than being an independent studio. Takahashi and Sugiura approached multiple companies for support, but most of the companies they contacted outright rejected their offer as they believed that Monolith Soft should be an independent company. However, Namco were interested in investing into Monolith Soft as a dedicated subsidiary, whilst handling logistics and marketing so that the core staff could focus on game development. An important supporter of Monolith Soft was Namco&#x27;s founder Masaya Nakamura, who shared many of Takahashi and Sugiura&#x27;s goals and ideals. Monolith Soft is noted as being one of a group of video game companies—alongside Sacnoth, Love-de-Lic and Mistwalker—founded by Square staff who had worked on notable games produced during the 1990s. The company was officially founded on 1 October 1999 by Takahashi, Sugiura, and Yasuyuki Honne, who had worked at Square on both the &quot;Chrono&quot; series and with Takahashi on &quot;Xenogears&quot;. The company&#x27;s offices were originally based in Yokohama.

===2000s===
====Namco era====
Monolith Soft&#x27;s first project was &quot;Xenosaga Episode I&quot;, a role-playing game (RPG) for the PlayStation 2. &quot;Xenosaga&quot; was a spiritual successor to &quot;Xenogears&quot;; development began in 2000 when enough staff had been gathered, lasting approximately two years. As with &quot;Xenogears&quot;, the game was scripted by Takahashi and Tanaka, who planned out the &quot;Xenosaga&quot; series as a hexalogy. In 2001, Namco producer Shinji Noguchi and Monolith Soft&#x27;s Tadashi Nomura conceived a new IP for the GameCube unconnected to &quot;Xenosaga&quot;. Titled &quot;Baten Kaitos: Eternal Wings and the Lost Ocean&quot;, development began six months after the concept was formed, with Honne acting as director. The game development staff of the company was now divided between the &quot;Xenosaga&quot; series and &quot;Baten Kaitos&quot;, the latter a project driven by the younger developers at Monolith Soft. &quot;Baten Kaitos&quot; was co-developed with tri-Crescendo, which came about due to both submitting designs to Namco, which suggested they work together on the project. In 2003, Honne was approached by then-CEO of Nintendo Satoru Iwata about developing a new entry in the &quot;Mother&quot; series for GameCube. Honne created a pitch themed around a &quot;felt-style recreation of 80s America&quot;, but the idea was firmly rejected by series creator Shigesato Itoi.

Following the release of the first &quot;Xenosaga&quot; game, Takahashi and Sugiura reassessed the internal structure of Monolith Soft, determining that the current lead developers were too old, clashing with their intended goals for the company to foster young talent. With this mindset, Takahashi stepped down from his lead role in the &quot;Xenosaga&quot; series. He continued to work for the company in a supervisory role by providing the series&#x27; scenario drafts, while younger staff continued the series development. This move also allowed Takahashi a greater degree of creative freedom in a number of projects as opposed to being tied to a single series. In May 2002, Monolith Soft moved from Yokohama to their current offices in Meguro, Tokyo. The next entry in the &quot;Xenosaga&quot; series, &quot;Xenosaga Episode II&quot;, began development under a new team following the release of &quot;Episode I&quot;. While developing &quot;Episode II&quot;, the staff shifted their focus from the main series to help tell the story through multiple media. Among these additional projects was &quot;&quot;, a spin-off title for mobile devices co-developed with Tom Create and Namco Mobile. &quot;Pied Piper&quot; was Tanaka&#x27;s last work on the &quot;Xenosaga&quot; series. Beginning in 2003, Monolith Soft also developed &quot;Namco × Capcom&quot;, a PlayStation 2 crossover game featuring characters from various Namco and Capcom video games. The idea was proposed by Monolith Soft, with development lasting two years.

In 2006, Monolith Soft was involved in four released games; &quot;Dirge of Cerberus: Final Fantasy VII&quot;, &quot;Xenosaga I &amp; II&quot;, &quot;Xenosaga Episode III&quot; and &quot;Baten Kaitos Origins&quot;. &quot;Dirge of Cerberus&quot; was primarily developed by Square Enix with Monolith Soft providing development support. &quot;Xenosaga I &amp; II&quot; was an expanded re-imagining of the first two games for the Nintendo DS, and is notable for being Monolith Soft&#x27;s first title for handheld game consoles. The game was co-developed by Tom Create in collaboration with multiple staff who had worked on the for the first &quot;Xenosaga&quot;. &quot;Xenosaga Episode III&quot; began development in 2004. While &quot;Xenosaga&quot; was planned as a hexalogy, the new team decided to restructure the series as a trilogy. &quot;Episode III&quot; was the last planned entry in the series, with further games depending on its commercial success. The mixed commercial and critical performance of the &quot;Xenosaga&quot; series left Monolith Soft&#x27;s development staff in a state of low morale. &quot;Baten Kaitos Origins&quot;, again co-developed with tri-Crescendo, was released late in the lifespan of the GameCube shortly before the release of Nintendo&#x27;s new home console the Wii. A &quot;Baten Kaitos&quot; game for the DS was also in development at Monolith Soft, but Namco, which by this point had merged with Bandai to become Namco Bandai, cancelled the project. A third &quot;Baten Kaitos&quot; game was in early development for &quot;a long time&quot; according to Honne, but was cancelled due to unspecified circumstances. Future efforts with the series depended upon both fan demand and the cooperation of IP owners Namco.

====Nintendo era====
According to Sugiura, Monolith Soft&#x27;s relations with Namco had undergone a negative change after Nakamura retired as head of Namco in 2002, three years before the merger with Bandai. The company underwent changes and Monolith Soft felt they were being given less creative freedom, and the newly created Namco Bandai was less willing to take creative risks. The company then received consultation from Shinji Hatano, an executive director at Nintendo, who advised them to continue creating innovative projects. Spurred on by Hatano&#x27;s supportive attitude, Monolith Soft decided to break away from Namco Bandai to become a Nintendo subsidiary; this provided Monolith Soft creative freedom in exchange for software development exclusivity for Nintendo platforms. Nintendo&#x27;s purchasing of the majority of Monolith Soft&#x27;s shares from Namco Bandai Holdings was publicly announced in April 2007. Nintendo became the majority shareholder of Monolith Soft with 80% of shares, while Namco Bandai retained 16% and remained as a development partner. Namco Bandai stated that the exchange of Monolith Soft shares would strengthen their relationship with Nintendo. The remaining shares were divided between Takahashi, Sugiura and Honne. By the beginning of April 2011, Namco Bandai had sold its remaining 400 shares in Monolith Soft to Nintendo, getting Nintendo 96% of the shares. By December 2024, Nintendo fully acquired 100% of Monolith Soft&#x27;s shares. Nintendo&#x27;s acquisition of Monolith Soft contrasted against the company&#x27;s previous publicized approach of not taking part in mergers and acquisitions of other studios and companies. In a statement on the matter, Iwata said that the deal was initiated due to the positive relations between Sugiura and Nintendo, and the two companies&#x27; parallel design and development philosophies.

Monolith Soft&#x27;s first releases following its acquisition by Nintendo were &quot;Soma Bringer&quot; and &quot;Super Robot Wars OG Saga: Endless Frontier&quot; for the Nintendo DS and &quot;&quot; for the Wii, all released in 2008. &quot;Soma Bringer&quot; was the company&#x27;s first portable title to be developed entirely in-house, it was designed as an experience driven by gameplay rather than narrative. Multiple returning staff from the &quot;Xenosaga&quot; series including Takahashi and Tanaka contributed to the game. &quot;Super Robot Wars OG Saga: Endless Frontier&quot;, a crossover RPG, was co-developed with Namco Bandai and featured cameo appearances from Monolith Soft&#x27;s &quot;Xenosaga&quot; series. &quot;Disaster: Day of Crisis&quot;, Monolith Soft&#x27;s first and to-date only non-RPG game, was intended as a showcase for the capabilities of the Wii. Due to quality concerns and Monolith Soft&#x27;s unfamiliarity with the Wii hardware, it was delayed from its planned 2006 release by two years. Monolith Soft was also chosen to develop &quot;Dragon Ball Z: Attack of the Saiyans&quot; due to their pedigree at developing RPGs. During this period they assisted in the development of &quot;Super Smash Bros. Brawl&quot;.

From mid 2006, Takahashi was working on a separate project; struck by an idea of rival civilizations emerging on the frozen bodies of two warring gods, he and Honne constructed a model of the two gods to better visualize the idea. After bringing their idea to Nintendo producer Hitoshi Yamagami, the team began development in 2007. Takahashi later stated that the game&#x27;s development acted as a means of boosting company morale after the failure of the &quot;Xenosaga&quot; series. The director, Koh Kojima, started his directorial debut with this game, having previously written the scenario for &quot;Baten Kaitos Origins&quot;. This game also saw a shift away from the narrative-heavy approach of Monolith Soft&quot;s earlier work, which Takahashi stated had been called out as old-fashioned. In contrast to many earlier Monolith Soft projects, the game was designed with an international release in mind. The intended scale of the game caused problems, and Takahashi reluctantly went to Yamagami with a list of proposals to cut down the game to a suitable size as he was accustomed to doing for previous projects. Yamagami rejected all of Takahashi&#x27;s suggestions, instead persuading Nintendo to keep supporting the project and allow the team to complete their work as envisioned. Originally titled &quot;Monado: Beginning of the World&quot;, Iwata had the title changed to honor Takahashi&#x27;s previous work on &quot;Xenogears&quot; and the &quot;Xenosaga&quot; franchise. The new title was &quot;Xenoblade Chronicles&quot;.

===2010s===
&quot;Xenoblade Chronicles&quot; released in 2010 in Japan, and after multiple delays, also released worldwide to unexpected critical and commercial success. Also released that year was &quot;Super Robot Wars OG Saga: Endless Frontier Exceed&quot;, a sequel to the original game co-developed with Namco Bandai Games that expanded upon the mechanics of the original and featured further &quot;Xenosaga&quot; cameos. In 2011, Monolith Soft founded a new studio in Kyoto, closer to Nintendo&#x27;s home base so the two companies could better interact with each other. Despite some initial reservations, the staff quickly settled into their new offices and the studio became a lauded place of work. Rather than original projects, the Kyoto branch acts as a supplementary studio, providing support for Monolith Soft and on Nintendo&#x27;s in-house projects. The Kyoto branch has provided support for &quot;The Legend of Zelda: Skyward Sword&quot; (2011), &quot;Animal Crossing: New Leaf&quot; (2012), &quot;Pikmin 3&quot; (2013), &quot;The Legend of Zelda: A Link Between Worlds&quot; (2013), &quot;Splatoon&quot;, (2015), &quot;Animal Crossing: Happy Home Designer&quot; (2015), &quot;Splatoon 2&quot; (2017), and &quot;Animal Crossing: New Horizons&quot; (2020).

The next game released from Monolith Soft, again in collaboration with Namco Bandai Games, was &quot;Project X Zone&quot; for the Nintendo 3DS. A successor to &quot;Namco × Capcom&quot;, the game received development support from and featured characters from franchises owned by Namco Bandai, Capcom and Sega. Following the release of &quot;Xenoblade Chronicles&quot;, Monolith Soft was also working on a follow-up titled &quot;Xenoblade Chronicles X&quot; for the Wii U. A spiritual successor to the first game, and the company&#x27;s first high-definition video game title, &quot;Xenoblade Chronicles X&quot; shifted from a story-driven to an open world gameplay-driven structure. The incorporation of an extensive multiplayer element resulted in its release being delayed and the narrative being substantially altered. Monolith Soft also developed a sequel to &quot;Project X Zone&quot;, &quot;Project X Zone 2&quot;. In addition to changing the character roster selected from Sega, Capcom and Bandai Namco, the game introduced characters from the Nintendo franchise &quot;Fire Emblem&quot; in addition to characters from &quot;Xenoblade Chronicles&quot;.

During the last development stages of &quot;Xenoblade Chronicles X&quot;, Monolith Soft began work on a new &quot;Xenoblade&quot; title for the Nintendo Switch. Titled &quot;Xenoblade Chronicles 2&quot;, the game returned to the story-driven structure of &quot;Xenoblade Chronicles&quot; while building upon the gameplay and technology of &quot;Xenoblade Chronicles X&quot;. One of the game&#x27;s story prototypes was later turned into an expansion titled &quot;Xenoblade Chronicles 2: Torna – The Golden Country&quot;, released in 2018. In addition to this, Monolith Soft also began development of an action game, hiring new staff for the project. The company opened new studios in Nakameguro and Iidabashi during 2017 and 2018. The 1st Production team, known for their work on the &quot;Xenoblade Chronicles&quot; series, started hiring staff for development of a new RPG project in October 2018. In March 2019, the 2nd Production team started hiring staff for a new project in &quot;The Legend of Zelda&quot; franchise. Between 2018 and 2019, the Iidabashi studio closed. In April 2019, in the wake of high revenue during the 2018–2019 fiscal period, the company opened a new studio in Ōsaki, Tokyo.

===2020s===
In 2020 Monolith Soft released &quot;Xenoblade Chronicles Definitive Edition&quot; for the Nintendo Switch, a remaster to the original title released in 2010. In 2022 Monolith Soft released &quot;Xenoblade Chronicles 3&quot;, another sequel to the &quot;Xenoblade Chronicles&quot; franchise following &quot;Xenoblade Chronicles&quot; and &quot;Xenoblade Chronicles 2&quot;, and the title ending the original trilogy of the series. Monolith Soft also provided development support to &quot;The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom&quot; (2023).

Nintendo acquired full control of Monolith Soft by December 2024.

==Development organization==
Monolith Soft currently has 3 different buildings in Japan dedicated to development, with 2 being located in Tokyo and 1 in Kyoto. The company has shared the organization of its divisions over the years, being organized as the following:
* Monolith Soft Tokyo, 1st Production Team: Headed by Tetsuya Takahashi, this is the group responsible for the development of the &quot;Xenoblade Chronicles&quot; franchise and the games lead in development by Monolith Soft, being the largest team in the studio with over 140 staff. 
* Monolith Soft Tokyo, 2nd Production Team: This group consists of the Monolith Soft staff in Tokyo that assisted on the development of &quot;The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild&quot; and &quot;The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom&quot; as a support studio, with around 50 employees working on &quot;Breath of the Wild&quot; and after hiring more staff over the years for the group, having 110 employees working on &quot;Tears of the Kingdom&quot;, in both cases supporting over 400 developers from the lead developer Nintendo EPD. Staff in this group previously worked on &quot;Xenoblade Chronicles&quot;, &quot;The Legend of Zelda: Skyward Sword&quot;, and &quot;Xenoblade Chronicles X&quot; before the team was created to work as support for the Nintendo Switch mainline &quot;Zelda&quot; titles. The team also consists of newer staff that were recruited following the completion of &quot;Breath of the Wild&quot;, including artists, programmers, planners, designers, and project managers who began working in the company during the development of &quot;Tears of the Kingdom&quot;.
* Monolith Soft Kyoto: Founded in 2011, Monolith Soft&#x27;s Kyoto studio is a branch dedicated to support other titles, having no lead development roles since it has been established. It has assisted in projects worked on by the Tokyo studio like the &quot;Xenoblade Chronicles&quot; series, as well as Nintendo EPD projects the Tokyo studio wasn&#x27;t involved with, such as &quot;Pikmin 3&quot;, &quot;The Legend of Zelda: A Link Between Worlds&quot;, &quot;Splatoon&quot; series and recent entries in the &quot;Animal Crossing&quot; series. The staff at the Kyoto Studio is mainly focused in art, graphics and asset creation, having around 30 employees.

==Games==

=== Lead development ===
&quot;This list is for games to which Monolith Soft contributed substantially, being either a major co-developer or the main developer.&quot;

=== Support development ===
&quot;This list is for titles where a studio of Monolith Soft acted in a lesser supporting role to the main developer. Refers to development organization for more information about the groups responsible for support development.&quot;

==Philosophy==
From the company&#x27;s inception, Takahashi and Sugiura wanted to give creative freedom to pursue projects outside genre standards, in addition to hiring young staff. An early aim was to encourage younger developers to make their mark in the industry, which at the time was dominated by people in the late 30s and up. This outlook was the reason why younger staff were given charge of the &quot;Xenosaga&quot; series. Kojima stated that younger developers were preferred as they could bring interesting ideas to a project. According to Sugiura, a major element during the period in which Monolith Soft was under Namco was the focus on creativity. They wanted to balance this with the financial logistics of game design rather than having budgetary concerns stifle the creative flare of the staff. When talking about their Wii U projects in 2012, Monolith Soft staff member Michihiko Inaba stated that the company wanted to show that Japan could keep up with the Western market in terms of ambitious games that pushed the industry forward, comparing Monolith Soft to Bethesda Softworks in this desire.

Speaking about the move from Namco Bandai to Nintendo, Sugiura commented that it was a challenge to only be developing games for a single group of consoles. Nintendo endorsed the challenge to Monolith Soft with incentives such as making a particular game within given hardware specifications, providing the company time and resources to accomplish that. Another factor that changed within Monolith Soft&#x27;s development process was Nintendo&#x27;s increased quality control, which would moot any project that did not have the desired quality for their systems. This sense of challenge was also echoed by Takahashi, who described both &quot;Xenoblade Chronicles&quot; and &quot;Xenoblade Chronicles X&quot; as being defined by self-imposed challenges to the development team when creating the environments on limited gaming hardware. Monolith Soft&#x27;s scope and goals are often attributed to Takahashi&#x27;s drive and ambition. While commonly associated with Japanese role-playing games (JRPGs), Monolith Soft focuses more on making role-playing games for a worldwide audience.

Rather than a fixed development structure, Monolith Soft chooses to freely assign staff based on the direction a project takes, in addition to believing in collaborations with other companies on projects rather than developing entirely in-house. According to a 2012 interview with Takahashi, a prerequisite for working at Monolith Soft is a deep passion for games in addition to general knowledge outside the field. As opposed to many other Japanese and Western studios which have come under criticism for excessive overtime and poor working conditions, Monolith Soft strives for a friendly working environment and reasonable hours for its staff. Overtime is also negotiated with the management and receives payment, a rarity in Japanese business. Speaking in relation to this approach, Honne recited the company&#x27;s motto; &quot;Zero overtime and creative work allowed&quot;. Despite the gaming industry&#x27;s workforce being dominated by men, Monolith Soft has a notably high proportion of female developers working at the company, with more than a quarter of its workforce in total.

<text>&quot;Kampfgeschwader&quot; 200 (KG 200) (&quot;[Air] Combat Squadron 200&quot;) was a German Luftwaffe special operations unit during World War II. The unit carried out especially difficult bombing and transport operations and long-distance reconnaissance flights, tested new aircraft designs and operated captured aircraft.
==History==
The unit&#x27;s history began in 1934, when the Luftwaffe formed a reconnaissance squadron under &quot;Oberst&quot; Theodor Rowehl and attached it to the &quot;Abwehr&quot;, the German military intelligence department of the armed forces high command. As the &quot;Abwehr&quot; started to lose Hitler&#x27;s goodwill during the war, a new reconnaissance unit, the &quot;2nd Test Formation&quot;, was formed in 1942 under the command of Werner Baumbach. This unit was combined with &quot;1st Test Formation&quot; in March 1944 to form KG 200 on 20 February 1944.

On 11 November 1944 Baumbach became &quot;Geschwaderkommodore&quot;, after which point all aerial special-ops missions were carried out by KG 200 under Baumbach&#x27;s command.

==Missions==
The unit carried out a wide variety of missions:

===Long-range reconnaissance===
Before the beginning of the war, aerial reconnaissance was usually carried out by civilian Lufthansa planes equipped with cameras. This practice was continued throughout the war as long as civilian airlines remained operational; later on, reconnaissance missions were most often carried out by Junkers Ju 86s flying at very high altitudes or by flying boats. Due to the lack of German aircraft with sufficient range, some recon missions used captured American Boeing B-17 Flying Fortress or Consolidated B-24 Liberator heavy bombers and Soviet Tupolev Tu-2s. For the most part, these machines were used for re-supply roles (dropping in supplies to German forces operating behind enemy lines), or transporting important personnel.

===The &quot;Mistel&quot; programme===
Beginning in 1942, to compensate for its lack of heavy bombers, the &quot;Luftwaffe&quot; started to experiment with packing some of its war-weary Junkers Ju 88 bombers with enormous shaped-charge warheads and guiding them to their targets with a fighter airplane mounted on the back of the unmanned bomber. Although not as effective as the Luftwaffe planners had hoped, the Mistel programme continued to be developed through 1944. However, few effective operations were flown. The unit was originally intended to attack naval installations at Gibraltar, Leningrad or Scapa Flow in Scotland, but the Allied Operation Overlord diverted efforts to Normandy.

On the night of 24 June 1944, Mistels of &quot;Kampfgeschwader&quot; 101 were dispatched to bomb targets in the English Channel. Although one of the Ju 88s had to be jettisoned prematurely, the remaining four pilots had successful launches and sank several blockships. Interest in the Scapa Flow attack was maintained, and in August 1944 &quot;Mistel&quot; forces were concentrated at Grove in Schleswig-Holstein. On 11 November, 1944 RAF Avro Lancasters attacked the German battleship &quot;Tirpitz&quot; and caused her to capsize. With &quot;Tirpitz&quot; out of commission there was no requirement for capital ships to be held in the Atlantic theatre, and soon those with the Home Fleet at Scapa Flow were on their way to the Pacific war, leaving the Mistels no worthwhile targets in Scapa Flow.

All Mistels were placed under the command of KG 200 and &quot;Oberst&quot; (colonel) Joachim Helbig. By late 1944, emphasis was placed on an all-out attack on Soviet armaments and power plants but by March 1945 the bases had been overrun by the Soviet advance. was ordered to concentrate &quot;Mistel&quot; operations against the bridges over the Oder and Neisse rivers. On 27 April, 7 Mistel aircraft under &quot;Leutnant&quot; Dittmann of II./KG 200, escorted by Fw 190s, were launched against crossings at Küstrin, but only two Mistels got to the target to launch, results were inconclusive and the bridges remained intact. By April, all available &quot;Mistel&quot; composite airframes had been expended and aircrew dispersed to nearby fighter units.

On 12 April 1945, Henschel Hs 293 standoff missiles were also used against bridges on the Oder by Dornier Do 217 bombers of KG 200.

===Suicide and near-suicide missions===
In the last months of the war, a small number of high-ranking German officers pressed for a suicide fighter programme as a last-ditch effort to stop Allied bombing runs over the Reich. This programme, known as &quot;Selbstopfer&quot; (&quot;self sacrifice&quot;), was intended to use the Fieseler Fi 103R Reichenberg, a manned version of the V-1 flying bomb, to attack enemy bombers and ground targets. Several test flights were carried out by Leonidas Squadron KG 200, and mass production of the conversions had begun, but the programme was stopped due to intervention from Baumbach who felt that these missions would be a waste of valuable pilots.

As part of the &quot;Aktion&quot; 24 operations, Dornier Do 24 flying boats were modified and loaded with explosives, with the intention that they would be landed on the Vistula River and exploded against river bridges used by Soviet forces. Experienced pilots were to be used to fly the aircraft to a point upstream where it would be left to a &quot;suicide pilot&quot; to ensure a collision with the bridge and ignite the explosives. The assumption that Soviet forces would not react and the unlikelihood of the aircrew managing to return to German-held territory after delivery made the concept highly dubious. The modified aircraft were destroyed on the ground during air raids.
===Special missions===

On 1 December 1943, a lone B-24 joined a bomber formation from the 44th Bomb Group. It was reported to have been a machine carrying the markings of a 392nd Bomb Group aircraft. However this unit did not become operational until 9 December. On 27 June 1944, a B-17 of KG 200, with Luftwaffe &quot;Geschwaderkennung&quot; code A3+FB, landed in Manises airport (Valencia) and was interned by the Spanish government.

===Parachute troops===

In July 1944 para-trained commandos of II./KG 200 carried out a parachute assault in July 1944 against French partisan forces on the Vercors Massif plateau in the French Alps where hundreds of partisans had created a stronghold from which they were mounting operations against the German occupiers. 

These para-trained commandos of II./KG 200 remain a little-known arm of Germany&#x27;s World War II parachute forces and were listed on II./KG 200&#x27;s ORBAT (Order of Battle) as the 3rd Staffel. It is possible the paratroopers were actually Waffen SS paratroopers from the 500th SS Parachute Battalion assigned to Kampfgeschwader 200 for this particular mission.

===KG 200 in the Middle East===
In July 1942, and again in the winter of 1943-44, the short-lived Operations Dora and Bunny-Hop took place in the Gulf of Sirte, Libya, with secret bases inland at Al Mukaram and Wadi Tamet, as well as at Shott al Jerid behind the Mareth Line. The aim was to establish weather stations to provide local and meteorological intelligence, and to ferry agents via French West Africa to Cairo, Freetown and Durban. These used a (long range) Messerschmitt Bf 108, two Heinkel He 111s, and a captured B-17 - given the fictional designation &quot;Dornier Do 288&quot; (as a &quot;confusive reuse&quot; of the &quot;8-288&quot; RLM airframe number for the Junkers Ju 288, a Bomber B design competitor) - which despite being badly damaged during a raid on Al Mukaram by a Sudan Defence Force detachment, managed to return to Athens for repair.

On the night of 27 November 1944, KG 200 pilots Braun and Pohl flew a Junkers Ju 290 transport from Vienna to a position just south of Mosul, Iraq, where they successfully air-dropped five Iraqi parachutists in bright moonlight. The Luftwaffe crew flew back to the island of Rhodes, still under German occupation. After dealing with engineering problems, they evacuated some thirty casualties from Rhodes, reaching Vienna two nights later.

<doc id="838269" wikidata="Q5247413" url="?curid=838269" title="Death of Cook">
<text>Death of Cook is the name of several paintings depicting the 1779 death of the first European visitor to the Hawaiian Islands, Captain James Cook at Kealakekua Bay. 
Most of these paintings seem to go back to an original by John Cleveley the Younger, painted in 1784, although other versions, like that of John Webber, stood model for later copies too. Such artworks were reproduced in paint and engraving over the course of modern world history. The much more famous reproductions, like the one at the Honolulu Museum of Art (allegedly based on the Cleveley version), often depicted Cook as a peacemaker trying to stop the fighting between his sailors and the native Hawaiians that they had challenged in combat.

However, in 2004, the original Cleveley painting was discovered in a private collection belonging to a family since 1851. James, Cleveley&#x27;s brother was a member of Cook&#x27;s crew, and the painting is said to concur with his drawings and eyewitness accounts. The original depicted Cook involved in hand-to-hand combat with the native Hawaiians. The discovery of the original painting has not changed the way most historians view Cook&#x27;s relationship with the Hawaiians, as during his last voyage, Cook was reported by his contemporaries to have become irrationally violent. 
The original watercolour painting, together with three others in a series by Cleveley, was put up for auction by Christie&#x27;s auction house in London in 2004. The lot of four paintings sold for £318,850 (US$572,655).

==Zoffany painting==
A later painting titled &quot;The Death of Captain James Cook, 14 February 1779&quot; by Johann Zoffany was begun in and was the painting owned by Cook&#x27;s widow. This painting is in the National Maritime Museum.

<text>2005 saw the release of many sequels and prequels in video games, such as &quot;Grand Theft Auto: Liberty City Stories&quot;, &quot;Tony Hawk&#x27;s American Wasteland&quot;, &quot;Resident Evil 4&quot;, &quot;Black &amp; White 2&quot;, &quot;Brothers in Arms: Road to Hill 30&quot;, &quot;Devil May Cry 3: Dante&#x27;s Awakening&quot;, &quot;Mario Kart DS&quot;, &quot;Mario &amp; Luigi: Partners in Time&quot;, &quot;Myst V: End of Ages&quot;, &quot;Need for Speed: Most Wanted&quot;,&quot; Prince of Persia: The Two Thrones&quot;, and WWE Smackdown! vs. Raw 2006, alongside prominent new releases including &quot;Brain Age&quot;, &quot;F.E.A.R.&quot;, &quot;Forza Motorsport&quot;, &quot;Dinosaur King&quot;, &quot;God of War&quot;, &quot;Guild Wars&quot;, &quot;Guitar Hero&quot;, &quot;Nintendogs&quot;, &quot;Onechanbara&quot;, &quot;Shadow of the Colossus&quot;, &quot;Madden NFL 06&quot;, &quot;NBA Live 06&quot;, &quot;NBA 2K6&quot;, and &quot;Sniper Elite&quot;. The seventh generation of video game consoles also began with the launch of the Xbox 360, while the Nintendo DS launched in PAL regions.

The year&#x27;s best-selling video game worldwide was &quot;Gran Turismo 4&quot; for the PlayStation 2. The year&#x27;s most critically acclaimed title was &quot;Resident Evil 4&quot; for the GameCube and PlayStation 2.

==Critically acclaimed games==
Metacritic (MC) and GameRankings (GR) are aggregators of video game journalism reviews.

==Trends==
In 2005, the total U.S. sales of video game hardware, software and accessories rose 6% over 2004 to $10.5 billion USD ($9.9 billion, 2004) breaking 2002&#x27;s $10.3 billion record for the industry.

The increase is largely due to the portable game market which counterbalanced sluggish console game sales. Delays, hardware shortages, and anticipation of next-generation video game consoles have been cited as reasoning for slow sales for both console games and console hardware. Console games and hardware dropped by 12% and 3% respectively.

The portable market of the video game industry rose to $1.4 billion, the second time sales broke the $1 billion mark in the industry&#x27;s history. Mostly due to the release of the Nintendo DS and the PlayStation Portable in North America, sales for portable hardware rose 96% over 2004. Although the release of the Nintendo DS and the Sony PSP aided in spurring growth in the portable market, the Game Boy Advance still represented 62% total portable software units sold and 52% of total portable software dollar sales.

Computer games continued its trend and declined by 14%, dropping from $1.1 billion in 2004 to $953 million. Although sales did decrease, NPD claims that playing games on the PC is actually increasing through a variety of different mediums including online websites and MMO subscriptions.

<doc id="838275" wikidata="Q2372717" url="?curid=838275" title="Swift Vets and POWs for Truth">
<text>Swift Vets and POWs for Truth, formerly known as the Swift Boat Veterans for Truth (SBVT), was a political group (527 group) of United States Swift boat veterans; former prisoners of war of the Vietnam War, formed during the 2004 presidential election campaign. It was done for the purpose of opposing John Kerry&#x27;s candidacy for the presidency; the campaign inspired the widely used political pejorative &quot;swiftboating&quot;, to describe an unfair or untrue political attack. The group disbanded and ceased operations on May 31, 2008.

SBVT asserted that Kerry was &quot;unfit to serve&quot; as president, based upon his alleged &quot;willful distortion of the conduct&quot; of American servicemen during that war, and his alleged &quot;withholding and/or distortion of material facts&quot; as to his own conduct during that war. SBVT stated that &quot;Kerry&#x27;s phony war crimes charges, his exaggerated claims about his own service in Vietnam, and his deliberate misrepresentation of the nature and effectiveness of Swift boat operations compel us to step forward.&quot; The group challenged the legitimacy of each of the combat medals awarded to Kerry by the U.S. Navy and the disposition of his discharge. Further, SBVT said that Kerry&#x27;s later criticism of the war was a &quot;betrayal of trust&quot; with other soldiers, and that by his activism he had caused direct &quot;harm&quot; to soldiers still at war.

These claims caused tremendous controversy during the election, particularly because the organization&#x27;s members had not been in a place to assess Kerry, while the Vietnam veterans who had served under him supported Kerry&#x27;s version of events.

Registered under Section 527 of the Internal Revenue Code, SBVT publicized its criticisms of Kerry during the election campaign in a book, in television advertisements that the group ran in swing states and in the media coverage some members received. The group was the subject of several complaints to the Federal Election Commission (FEC). After the election, the group was credited by media and praised by conservatives as contributing to Kerry&#x27;s defeat. The group&#x27;s tactics are considered an example of a successful political smear campaign for its widely publicized and later discredited claims.

==Membership==
SBVT was formed in 2004. Membership was initially limited to veterans of the Vietnam War who at some point served in a Swift boat unit, as did Kerry.

Of the 3,500 Swift boat sailors who served in Vietnam, the names of some 250 appeared on the group&#x27;s statement against Kerry; most did not serve at the same time or in the same place as Kerry. Founding members of SBVT include Rear Admiral Roy Hoffmann (retired), a former commander of Swift boat forces; Colonel Bud Day, who earned the Medal of Honor; Houston attorney John O&#x27;Neill, an officer who became commander of Swift Boat PCF 94 several months after Kerry&#x27;s departure in 1969 and who appeared opposite Kerry in a televised 1971 debate between them on &quot;The Dick Cavett Show&quot;; and 13 other named veterans. Several of those who joined SBVT during the 2004 campaign were officers who had previously praised Kerry&#x27;s conduct during the Vietnam War. These included Division Commander Grant Hibbard, who wrote positive evaluations of Kerry, and Commander George Elliott, who submitted Kerry for a Silver Star. SBVT asserted that it included, in total, 16 officers who served with Kerry in Coastal Division 11 as members.
Despite SBVT&#x27;s statements that Kerry&#x27;s &quot;entire chain of command&quot; belonged to the group, Joseph Streuli, former commander of Coastal Division 13, Charles Horne, former commander of Coastal Squadron 1, and Art Price, former commander CTF 116, who are described in &quot;Unfit for Command&quot; as part of Kerry&#x27;s chain of command, were not affiliated with the group.

The group&#x27;s initial letter against Kerry stated &quot;It is our collective judgment that, upon your return from Vietnam, you grossly and knowingly distorted the conduct of the American soldiers, marines, sailors and airmen of that war (including a betrayal of many of us, without regard for the danger your actions caused us). Further, we believe that you have withheld and/or distorted material facts as to your own conduct in this war.&quot; However, Kerry had posted over 100 pages of his military records at his website nearly two weeks before the issuance of the SBVT letter, and had also made his military medical records available for inspection by reporters (and provided a summary from his doctor).

Not all SBVT members said that they were signing the letter for the same reason. For example, from an interview published the day before the letter was made public: &quot;&#x27;[Kerry] earned his medals, he did what he was supposed to do in Vietnam,&#x27; said retired Coast Guard Captain Adrian Lonsdale, who was in the chain of command above Kerry and oversaw various operations dealing with Navy swift boats of the type Kerry commanded. &#x27;But I was very disappointed in his statements after he got out of the Navy.

Of those who served in Kerry&#x27;s boat crew, only Stephen Gardner joined SBVT. He was not present on any of the occasions when Kerry earned his medals, including his Purple Hearts. Gardner appeared in two of the group&#x27;s television advertisements.

All other living members of Kerry&#x27;s crew supported his presidential bid, and some frequently campaigned with him as his self-described &quot;band of brothers&quot;. Kerry crew members have disputed some of SBVT&#x27;s various allegations, calling them &quot;totally false&quot; (Drew Whitlow), &quot;garbage&quot; (Gene Thorson), and &quot;a pack of lies&quot; (Del Sandusky).

No members of SBVT were aboard Kerry&#x27;s boat during any of the incidents for which he was decorated. The only member of SBVT who was present at the Silver Star incident, Rood&#x27;s crew member Larry Clayton Lee, praised Kerry&#x27;s tactics and stated that he earned his Silver Star. However, he stated that based on discussions with other SBVT members, he came to question whether Kerry deserved other medals for incidents at which he was not present.

On September 29, 2004, SBVT announced that it was joining forces with a group of American prisoners of war who were held captive by the North Vietnamese during the war to form the new group, &quot;Swift Vets and POWs For Truth&quot;.

==Media activities==
SBVT produced several television advertisements created by Stevens Reed Curcio &amp; Potholm attacking Kerry&#x27;s actions both in and after Vietnam. For a detailed discussion of SBVT&#x27;s allegations about Kerry&#x27;s service in Vietnam, see John Kerry military service controversy.

===First television advertisement===
SBVT first went public with a May 4, 2004, press conference declaring opposition to Kerry. When the press conference garnered little attention, the organization produced television advertisements. On August 5, 2004, SBVT began airing a one-minute television spot in three hotly contested states in the ongoing presidential election. The advertisement, entitled &quot;Any Questions?&quot;, was a collage of short clips of 13 SBVT members, many of whom stated they served with John Kerry or had direct contact with Kerry during his service in Vietnam. The veterans appearing in the ad said Kerry was dishonest, unreliable, unfit to lead, and had dishonored his country and fellow veterans. Only one of the men in the advertisement (Steve Gardner) served under Kerry, but some sailed on other boats grouped with Kerry&#x27;s.

Among the first to denounce the first ad was Republican Senator John McCain, a Bush supporter, Vietnam veteran, and former POW. He said, &quot;I condemn the [SBVT] ad. It is dishonest and dishonorable. I think it is very, very wrong&quot;. Senator McCain would be criticized four years later during his own presidential campaign for accepting money and support from many of the same Swiftboaters.

===Book===
SBVT founder and spokesman John O&#x27;Neill and Jerome Corsi are listed as coauthors of the book &quot;Unfit for Command: Swift Boat Veterans Speak Out Against John Kerry&quot;, published by Regnery Publishing. A best-seller upon its release in August 2004, it criticized Kerry&#x27;s judgment in battle, his truthfulness, his entitlement to certain medals, and his later anti-war activities. The book was based in part on interviews with veterans who served in or with Kerry&#x27;s division, and also on biographies of Kerry. Several members of Kerry&#x27;s crew stated that O&#x27;Neill did not interview them; some veterans who were interviewed asserted that their statements were edited to strip out material favorable to Kerry. Neither O&#x27;Neill nor Corsi had any firsthand knowledge of Kerry&#x27;s service. O&#x27;Neill served on the Swift boats after Kerry left Vietnam, and Corsi never served in Vietnam.

After controversial statements made by Corsi became public, O&#x27;Neill denied Corsi&#x27;s coauthorship of the book, saying that Corsi was &quot;simply an editor and not really any sort of co-author.&quot; However, portions of the book contain material also found in articles posted under Corsi&#x27;s name at a website critical of John Kerry, and O&#x27;Neill is cited in a later book as describing Corsi as helping to write &quot;Unfit for Command&quot;, and urging him to back out of media appearances after the controversial comments became public.

===Second television advertisement===
On August 20, 2004, SBVT released a second television advertisement featuring a portion of Kerry&#x27;s , before the Senate Foreign Relations Committee. Kerry, testifying as a member of Vietnam Veterans Against the War (VVAW), had criticized U.S. policy in Vietnam. He had also described VVAW&#x27;s 1971 Winter Soldier Investigation, in which more than 100 soldiers and civilians said they had seen or committed atrocities carried out by U.S. forces in Vietnam. Kerry&#x27;s Senate testimony presented a summary of these men&#x27;s statements; he did not, however, say that he had any personal knowledge of these atrocities. The SBVT advertisement alternated clips of Kerry&#x27;s summary of these statements with charges from Vietnam veterans, particularly former POWs, that Kerry&#x27;s &quot;accusations&quot; had demoralized and &quot;betrayed&quot; soldiers in Vietnam.

===Third television advertisement===
A third television advertisement began airing on August 26, 2004, attacking Kerry&#x27;s past statements that he was in Cambodia on Christmas Eve, 1968. This advertisement featured Stephen Gardner stating, &quot;I spent more time on John Kerry&#x27;s boat than any other crew member. ... John Kerry claims that he spent Christmas in 1968 in Cambodia and that is categorically a lie. Not in December, not in January. We were never in Cambodia on a secret mission, ever.&quot;

However, Gardner was only a member of Kerry&#x27;s crew for a month and a half, from December 6, 1968, to approximately January 22, 1969; crew directories and first hand accounts indicate that other crewmembers served as long or longer under Kerry&#x27;s four-month-long command.

In addition, Kerry had never said that the Christmas Eve incident was a &quot;secret mission&quot;, but happened during a routine patrol; furthermore, he stated at least two weeks prior to the ad&#x27;s appearance that he had been patrolling at or near the border at the time and subsequently ambushed. The account of the patrol appears in Douglas Brinkley&#x27;s &quot;Tour of Duty&quot;, [pp. 209–219] and Cmdr. Elliott noted in Kerry&#x27;s fitness report that his boat was ambushed during the Christmas truce of 1968. Moreover, Kerry&#x27;s biographer, Douglas Brinkley, has stated that Kerry &quot;went into Cambodian waters three or four times in January and February 1969 on clandestine missions&quot;.
===Fourth television advertisement===
On August 31, 2004, a fourth advertisement was released by SBVT. The advertisement described Kerry as a man who &quot;renounced his country&#x27;s symbols&quot;, a reference to a Vietnam War protest where Kerry threw war decorations over the fence of the U.S. Capitol building on April 23, 1971. The advertisement also contained edited video clips of Kerry from a WRC-TV program called &quot;Viewpoints&quot;, in which he stated that he gave back &quot;six, seven, eight, nine&quot; (in response to a question: &quot;How many did you give back, John?&quot;); it then included a clip from another part of that interview where Kerry stated &quot;and that was the medals themselves&quot;, although in the interview it was not in reference to the decorations he returned.

==Controversy==

===Truth of allegations===
Early in the advertising campaign, &quot;Time&quot; magazine surveyed public credence in the SBVT advertisements among those who viewed them. The poll, conducted August 24 through 26, showed that about one-third of viewers believed there was at least &quot;some truth&quot; to the allegations. Among swing voters, about one-fourth felt there was any truth to the ads.

A major part of the SBVT controversy centered on the group&#x27;s testimony. The SBVT statements were accompanied by affidavits. One affiant, Alfred French, acknowledged he had no firsthand knowledge of the events to which he had sworn.

In May 2006, &quot;The New York Times&quot; reported that an early member of the group, Steve Hayes, stated that he came to believe that the group was twisting Kerry&#x27;s record, and broke with the group and voted for Kerry. Hayes told the Times:

Hayes also told &quot;The New York Times&quot; that he provided a long interview to Kerry&#x27;s supporters, backing their version of the incident for which Kerry received the Bronze Star.

====First television advertisement====
The first SBVT ad was contradicted by the statements of several other veterans who observed the incidents, by the Navy&#x27;s official records, and, in some instances, by the contemporaneous statements of SBVT members themselves.

Several major newspapers were also skeptical of the SBVT allegations. For example, a &quot;New York Times&quot; news article stated, &quot;on close examination, the accounts of Swift Boat Veterans for Truth prove to be riddled with inconsistencies.&quot; Regarding the medal dispute, a &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot; editorial stated, &quot;Not limited by the conventions of our colleagues in the newsroom, we can say it outright: These charges against John Kerry are false.&quot; The editorial argued this position on the basis that &quot;Kerry is backed by almost all those who witnessed the events in question, as well as by documentation.&quot; On August 22, 2004 &quot;The Washington Post&quot; reported: &quot;An investigation by &quot;The Washington Post&quot; into what happened that day suggests that both sides have withheld information from the public record and provided an incomplete, and sometimes inaccurate, picture of what took place. But although Kerry&#x27;s accusers have succeeded in raising doubts about his war record, they have failed to come up with sufficient evidence to prove him a liar.&quot;

The ABC television show &quot;Nightline&quot; traveled to Vietnam and interviewed Vietnamese who were involved in the battle for which Kerry was awarded the Silver Star. These witnesses disputed O&#x27;Neill&#x27;s charge that there &quot;was little or no fire&quot; that day; they said that the fighting was fierce. SBVT supporters question whether these witnesses are reliable because they spoke &quot;in the presence of a Communist official&quot;, but their account of enemy fire is substantially the same as that previously given by another former Viet Cong to an AP reporter and by the American witnesses, including the only SBVT member who was actually present that day, Larry Clayton Lee. ABC News&#x27;s &quot;The Note&quot; opined, &quot;the Swift Boat ad and their primary charges about Kerry&#x27;s medals are personal, negative, extremely suspect, or false.&quot;

====Book, other media statements====
Jerome Corsi has said that a picture of Kerry&#x27;s 1993 visit to Vietnam hangs in the War Remnants Museum in Ho Chi Minh City as a gesture of &quot;honor&quot; by the Communists &quot;for his contribution to their victory over [the] United States&quot;, and John O&#x27;Neill has stated that Kerry &quot;is in the North Vietnamese war museum as a hero... . one of the heroes who caused them to win the war in Vietnam&quot;. The statement is also repeated in &quot;Unfit for Command&quot; (pp 167–174). However, Josh Gerstein of the &quot;New York Sun&quot; stated in this regard:

In this connection, the web page Corsi and another anti-Kerry veteran originally published on the Kerry museum photo contained the picture of Robert McNamara&#x27;s 1995 meeting with General Giáp, who was misidentified as &quot;Mao Tse-tung&quot;. (Photo #10).

In addition, John O&#x27;Neill said that in 1971 John Kerry &quot;wanted to abandon ship and leave the POWs [in Vietnam]&quot; and that &quot;[o]n the Dick Cavett show and elsewhere, John Kerry&#x27;s position was that we should accept the Madame Binh seven-point proposal, which called for unilateral withdrawal, setting a date after which at some future time, we&#x27;d negotiate the return of the POWs. So we would set a date. We would withdraw and then we would begin to discuss how to bring them home&quot;. However, in the Cavett debate, Kerry actually said:

===Connections with Republicans===
SBVT characterized itself as a non-partisan group both in the legal sense and in spirit, yet several prominent individuals who assisted SBVT also have had close ties to the Republican Party. According to information released by the IRS on February 22, 2005, more than half of the group&#x27;s reported contributions came from just three sources, all prominent Texas Republican donors: Houston builder Bob J. Perry, a longtime supporter of George W. Bush, donated $4.45 million, Harold Simmons&#x27; Contrans donated $3 million, and T. Boone Pickens, Jr. donated $2 million. Other major contributors included Bush fundraiser Carl Lindner ($300,000), Robert Lindner ($260,000), GOP contributor Aubrey McClendon ($250,000), George Matthews Jr. ($250,000), and Crow Holdings ($100,000).

The initial communications consultant for SBVT was Merrie Spaeth, a Reagan administration press officer and a volunteer consultant to Ken Starr in the Clinton impeachment; she was also a spokesperson for &quot;Republicans for Clean Air&quot;, a 527 group opposing John McCain&#x27;s 2000 presidential campaign and funded by Bush supporters who also helped fund SBVT. John E. O&#x27;Neill — the primary author of &quot;Unfit for Command&quot; and a key player in the formation of SBVT — donated over $14,000 to Republican candidates. He co-operated with the Nixon White House in opposing Kerry in 1971, and seconded Nixon&#x27;s nomination at the 1972 Republican national convention.

Retired Admiral William Schachte, a principal source for the SBVT allegations about Kerry&#x27;s first Purple Heart, has donated to both of Bush&#x27;s presidential campaigns. Schachte was also a lobbyist for FastShip, a firm that recently announced it was receiving $40 million in federal funding for one of its projects. In addition, Schachte&#x27;s lobbying firm associate, David Norcross, was chairman of the 2004 Republican convention. Chris LaCivita, Political Director of the National Republican Senatorial Committee in 2002, worked as a private contractor providing media advice for SBVT.

The SBVT postal address was registered to Susan Arceneaux, treasurer of the Majority Leader&#x27;s Fund, a PAC closely tied to the former Congressional leader, Republican Dick Armey.

Republican activist Sam Fox&#x27;s donation of $50,000 to SBVT during the 2004 campaign caused a controversy when Bush nominated him to the position of ambassador to Belgium. Because the Democratic members of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee indicated that they would not support his nomination, Bush withdrew the nomination; he appointed Fox to the position on April 4, 2007, while Congress was in recess.&lt;ref name=&quot;AP/CNN03283007&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

These ties, along with others (see below), led to suggestions in the popular press that SBVT was a front group for Republicans.

===Connections with the Bush campaign===
The Bush campaign became part of the general SBVT controversy when McCain condemned the first SBVT ad, and said, &quot;I hope that the president will also condemn it.&quot; The Bush campaign did not condemn SBVT or the SBVT ads. The campaign did not endorse the group either, stating &quot;We have not and we will not question Senator Kerry&#x27;s service in Vietnam.&quot; Kerry was dismissive of this statement, saying, &quot;Of course, the President keeps telling people he would never question my service to our country. Instead, he watches as a Republican-funded attack group does just that.&quot; Kerry also alleged that SBVT was &quot;a front for the Bush campaign. And the fact that the President won&#x27;t denounce what they&#x27;re up to tells you everything you need to know—he wants them to do his dirty work&quot;. When pressed on the issue, President Bush called for an end to all 527 group political advertisements, and challenged Kerry to do the same.

Critics and the Kerry campaign pointed to several specific connections between SBVT and the Bush campaign. The Kerry campaign asserted that Bush campaign headquarters in Florida distributed fliers promoting SBVT events, a charge the Bush campaign denied. Kenneth Cordier, former vice-chair of Veterans for Bush/Cheney (in 2000) and volunteer member of the Bush campaign veterans steering committee, appeared in the second SBVT advertisement. The Bush campaign asked him to resign and stated that it had been unaware of his SBVT involvement.

On August 25, 2004, Benjamin Ginsberg, the top election lawyer to the Bush campaign on campaign finance law, also resigned after it was learned that SBVT was one of his clients. Ginsberg stated that he was withdrawing to avoid being a distraction to the campaign. He declared that he had acted &quot;in a manner that is fully appropriate and legal,&quot; arguing that it was not uncommon or illegal for lawyers to represent campaigns or political parties while also representing 527 groups. He also maintained that he did not disclose to the Bush campaign that he was simultaneously representing the SBVT group. After leaving the Bush campaign, Ginsberg retained his status as counsel to SBVT.

In January 2005, Governor Jeb Bush, the President&#x27;s brother and Florida chairman for his 2004 campaign, sent a letter to SBVT member and former POW Bud Day, thanking him for his &quot;personal support of my brother in his re-election.&quot; In addition, Governor Bush said of the SBVT:

===Federal Election Commission filings===
FEC Cases #5511 and #5525

On August 10, 2004, three campaign finance watchdog groups — Democracy 21, the Campaign Legal Center, and OpenSecrets — jointly filed an independent complaint with the Federal Election Commission (Case #5511). The complaint alleged that SBVT&#x27;s sources of funding were in violation of federal election law in that &quot;Swift Boat Veterans for Truth (SBVT) is registered with the IRS as a section 527 group but is not registered with the Commission as a political committee. However, SBVT is, in fact, a federal political committee.&quot;

On August 20, 2004, the Kerry campaign filed a complaint with the FEC (Case #5525) alleging that SBVT and 20 additional named respondents had conducted campaign activity that &quot;has been coordinated with the Bush campaign and the Republican Party from the outset.&quot; Under federal election law, SBVT, as a nonpartisan 527 group, was barred from coordinating with any political campaign. The complaint, citing the &quot;ties&quot; noted above, claimed a &quot;web of connections to the Bush family, high-profile Texas political figures, and President Bush&#x27;s chief political aide, Karl Rove&quot;.

The Bush campaign dismissed charges of ties and asserted there was no co-ordination between SBVT and the campaign. Editorial opinion on the evidence for co-ordination varied. ABC News&#x27; &quot;The Note&quot; stated, &quot;There is no evidence that the Bush campaign is orchestrating the Swift Boat Veterans for Truth.&quot; In contrast, the &quot;New York Times&quot; opined that the SBVT attacks were &quot;orchestrated by negative-campaign specialists deep in the heart of the Texas Republican machine.&quot;

FEC Findings – Cases #5511 and #5525

On December 13, 2006, in a consolidated finding, the FEC ruled against the Kerry campaign allegations (Case #5525) finding that...

In addition, Kerry campaign complaints against 18 other respondents were relegated to &quot;dismissed-other&quot; and 2 relegated to &quot;Reason To Believe/No Further Action&quot; (RTB/NFA) status.

The FEC did, however, find &quot;for&quot; the joint complainants (Case #5511) in that the SBVT failed to register and file disclosure reports as a federal political committee, and accepted contributions in violation of federal limits and source prohibitions. SBVT was assessed a fine of $299,500.

The conciliation agreement between the FEC and the SBVT also stated, in part:

In addition, as part of the conciliation agreement, SBVT stated that upon completing its obligations under the agreement, it &quot;intends to cease operations as an IRC Section 527 organization and to donate the remainder of its funds to a charity supporting the families of U.S. servicemen and servicewomen killed or wounded in the War in Iraq.&quot;

===Disclosure of documents===
During the campaign, SBVT criticized Kerry for not signing a Standard Form 180 authorizing general public access to his Navy personnel records. Kerry responded that the documents were posted on his website. In May 2005, Kerry confirmed his signing of the SF-180 form permitting release of his service records and medical records to reporters from the &quot;Boston Globe&quot;, the &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot;, and the Associated Press; he refused a request by the &quot;New York Sun&quot; for access to the records. The &quot;Boston Globe&quot; and &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot; reported that the records largely duplicated what Kerry had released during the campaign.

SBVT members also criticized Kerry for not releasing his own private journals and letters. However, SBVT members themselves refused to release documents. For example, a journal by another of the Swift boat commanders and the relevant Navy records of some of the SBVT members involved in specific allegations have not been released.

The White House refused to release records detailing any Bush administration contacts with prominent individuals associated with SBVT. The denied Freedom of Information Act request was filed on August 24, 2007 by Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington.

==Discredited==
The claims of the group were discredited; Vietnam veterans who served alongside Kerry or under his command disputed the criticisms and supported Kerry&#x27;s version of events and his presidential aspirations.

==&quot;Swiftboating&quot;==

Since the 2004 election, the term &quot;swiftboating&quot; (or &quot;swift boating&quot;) has become a common expression for a campaign attacking opponents by questioning their credibility and patriotism in a dishonest manner. The term is most often used with the pejorative meaning of a smear campaign.

<text>The Studentencodex is the most widely used commercium book in the Flemish part of Belgium.
Most students use the editions published by the Katholiek Vlaams Hoogstudentenverbond (KVHV), which is composed of three parts: the &quot;corpsboek&quot; with songs of the most fraternities, the clubcodex (&quot;blue pages&quot;) and a part of more than three hundred songs. It is published in two editions: one with a green cover by the KVHV of Leuven (used in the provinces of Flemish Brabant, Limburg, and Antwerp) and one with a blue cover by the KVHV of Ghent (used in East and West Flanders). Since the edition of 1993, they feature a common clubcodex and song part but have a different corpsboek.

In Brussels, students of the Vrije Universiteit Brussel and the Erasmus University College use their own codex with a black cover, which contains no religious songs in it due to the pluralistic position of these institutions of higher education.

<doc id="838284" wikidata="Q190563" url="?curid=838284" title="Pontus (mythology)">
<text>In Greek mythology, Pontus (; ) was an ancient, pre-Olympian sea-god, one of the Greek primordial deities. Pontus was Gaia&#x27;s son and has no father; according to the Greek poet Hesiod, he was born without coupling, though according to Hyginus, Pontus is the son of Aether and Gaia.

==Mythology==
For Hesiod, Pontus seems little more than a personification of the sea, &quot;ho póntos&quot; (), by which Hellenes signified the Mediterranean Sea. After the castration of his brother, Uranus, Pontus, with his mother Gaia, fathered Nereus (the Old Man of the Sea), Thaumas (the awe-striking &quot;wonder&quot; of the Sea, embodiment of the sea&#x27;s dangerous aspects), Phorcys and his sister-consort Ceto, and the &quot;Strong Goddess&quot; Eurybia. With the sea goddess Thalassa (whose own name simply means &quot;sea&quot; but is derived from a Pre-Greek root), he fathered all sea life.

In a Roman sculpture of the 2nd century AD, Pontus, rising from seaweed, grasps a rudder with his right hand and leans on the prow of a ship. He wears a mural crown, and accompanies Fortuna, whose draperies appear at the left, as twin patron deities of the Black Sea port of Tomis in Moesia.

<text>Higher order grammar (HOG) is a grammar theory based on higher-order logic. It can be viewed simultaneously as generative-enumerative (like categorial grammar and principles and parameters) or model theoretic (like head-driven phrase structure grammar or lexical functional grammar).

==Key features==

* There is a propositional logic of types, which denote sets of linguistic (phonological, syntactic, or semantic) entities. For example, the type NP denotes the syntactic category (or form class) of noun phrases.
* HOG maintains Haskell Curry&#x27;s distinction between tectogrammatical structure (abstract syntax) and phenogrammatical structure (concrete syntax).
* Abstract syntactic entities are identified with structuralist (Bloomfield-Hockett) free forms (words and phrases). For example, the NP &quot;your cat&quot; is distinct from its phonology or its semantics.
* Concrete syntax is identified with phonology, broadly construed to include word order.
* The modelling of Fregean senses is broadly similar to Montague&#x27;s, but with intensions replaced by finer-grained hyperintensions.
* There is a (Curry-Howard) proof term calculus, whose terms denote linguistic (phonological, syntactic, or semantic) entities.
* The term calculus is embedded in a classical higher-order logic (HOL).
* The syntax-phonology and syntax-semantics interfaces are expressed as axiomatic theories in the HOL.
* The HOL admits (separation-style) subtyping, e.g. NPacc, the type of accusative noun phrases, is a subtype of NP, and denotes a subset of the category denoted by NP.

<text>Jean-Marc Nattier (; 17 March 1685 – 7 November 1766) was a French painter. He was born in Paris, the second son of Marc Nattier (1642–1705), a portrait painter, and of Marie Courtois (1655–1703), a miniaturist. He is noted for his portraits of the ladies of King Louis XV&#x27;s court in classical mythological attire.

He received his first instruction from his father, and from his uncle, the history painter Jean Jouvenet (1644–1717). He enrolled in the Royal Academy in 1703 and applied himself to copying pictures in the Luxembourg Palace, making a series of drawings of the Marie de Médici painting cycle by Peter Paul Rubens. The publication (1710) of engravings based on these drawings made Nattier famous, but he declined to proceed to the French Academy in Rome, though he had taken the first prize at the Paris Academy at the age of fifteen. In 1715 he went to Amsterdam, where Peter the Great was then staying, and painted portraits of the tsar and the empress Catherine, but declined an offer to go to Russia.

Nattier aspired to be a history painter. Between 1715 and 1720 he devoted himself to compositions like the &quot;Battle of Pultawa&quot;, which he painted for Peter the Great, and the &quot;Petrification of Phineus and of his Companions&quot;, which led to his election to the Academy. He died in Paris in 1766.

==Portraits==

The financial collapse of 1720 caused by the schemes of Law all but ruined Nattier, who found himself forced to devote his whole energy to portraiture, which was more lucrative. He became the painter of the artificial ladies of Louis XV&#x27;s court. He subsequently revived the genre of the allegorical portrait, in which a living person is depicted as a Greco-Roman goddess or other mythological figure.

Nattier&#x27;s graceful and charming portraits of court ladies in this mode were very fashionable, partly because he could beautify a sitter while also retaining her likeness. The most notable examples of his straightforward portraiture are the &quot;Marie Leczinska&quot; at the Dijon Museum, and the group portrait &quot;The Artist Surrounded by His Family&quot;, dated 1730. Another excellent example of Nattier&#x27;s work and sense of composition is his 1738 portrait of Mathilde de Carbonnel-Canisy, marquise d&#x27;Antin. The portrait is permanently exhibited at the musée Jacquemart-André in Paris and remains one of the most popular works in the Jacquemart-André Collection.

Many of his notable paintings are on permanent exhibit at major museums. Thus at the Louvre is his &quot;Magdalen&quot;; in the Musee Jacquemart-Andre his &quot;Portrait of Mathilde de Canisy, marquise d&#x27;Antin&quot;; at Nantes the portrait of &quot;La Camargo&quot; and &quot;A Lady of the Court of Louis XV&quot;. At Orléans a &quot;Head of a Young Girl&quot;, at Marseilles a portrait of &quot;Mme de Pompadour&quot;, at Perpignan a portrait of Louis XV, and at Valenciennes a portrait of &quot;Le Duc de Boufflers&quot;. The Versailles Museum owns an important group of two ladies, and the Dresden Gallery a portrait of the &quot;Maréchal de Saxe&quot;.

At the Wallace collection Nattier is represented by &quot;The comtesse de Tillières&quot; (formerly known as &quot;Portrait of a Lady in Blue&quot;), &quot;Mademoiselle de Clermont en sultane&quot;, and &quot;The marquise de Belestat&quot;. In the early part of the 20th century in the collection of Mr Lionel Phillips were the duchess of Flavacourt as &quot;Le Silence&quot;, and the duchess of Châteauroux as &quot;Le Point du jour&quot; (now at Marseilles). A portrait of the Comtesse de Neubourg and her Daughter formed part of the Vaile Collection, and realized 4500 guineas at the sale of this collection in 1903. Nattier&#x27;s works have been engraved by Alphonse Leroy, Tardieu, Jean Audran (1667–1756), Dupin and many other noted craftsmen.The 1753 &quot;Marquis de Marigny&quot; is in the collection of the Staatliche Kunsthalle Karlsruhe.
The Getty Museum has &quot;Madame Bonier de la Mosson as Diana&quot;, 1742. The Metropolitan Museum of Art has &quot;Madame de Maison-Rouge as Diana&quot;, 1756. The 1744 &quot;Duchesse de Chartres as Hebe Nationalmuseum&quot; is in the collection of Nationalmuseum.

<text>Minnehaha Park is a city park in Minneapolis, Minnesota, United States, and home to Minnehaha Falls and the lower reaches of Minnehaha Creek. Officially named Minnehaha Regional Park, it is part of the Minneapolis Park and Recreation Board system and lies within the Mississippi National River and Recreation Area, a unit of the National Park Service. The park was designed by landscape architect Horace W.S. Cleveland in 1883 as part of the Grand Rounds Scenic Byway system, and was part of the popular steamboat Upper Mississippi River &quot;Fashionable Tour&quot; in the 1800s.

The park preserves historic sites that illustrate transportation, pioneering, and architectural themes. Preserved structures include the Minnehaha Princess Station, a Victorian train depot built in the 1870s; the John H. Stevens House, built in 1849 and moved to the park from its original location in 1896, utilizing horses and 10,000 school children; and the Longfellow House, a house built to resemble the Henry Wadsworth Longfellow&#x27;s house in Cambridge, Massachusetts. The park was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1969 as the Minnehaha Historic District in recognition of its state-level significance in architecture, commerce, conservation, literature, transportation, and urban planning.

The central feature of the park, Minnehaha Falls, was a favorite subject of pioneer photographers, beginning with Alexander Hesler&#x27;s daguerreotype in 1852. Although he never visited the park, Henry Wadsworth Longfellow helped to spread the waterfall&#x27;s fame when he wrote his celebrated poem, &quot;The Song of Hiawatha&quot;. The falls are located on Minnehaha Creek near the creek&#x27;s confluence with the Mississippi River, near Fort Snelling. The main Minnesota Veterans Home is located on a bluff where the Mississippi and Minnehaha Creek converge. More than 850,000 people visit Minnehaha Falls each year, and it continues to be the most photographed site in Minnesota.

==History==

Minnehaha Falls gets its name from the nearby Dakota people, meaning mni (water) and haha (curling). It was considered a safe place for gathering.

European settlement in the area began in 1805 when the US Army bought a nine-square-mile tract of land at the confluence of the Mississippi and Minnesota River from the Dakota people. Sited on the bluff overlooking the rivers, Fort Snelling was built under the command of Colonel Josiah Snelling between 1820 and 1824. In 1821 Snelling&#x27;s son, William Joseph Snelling came to the fort after leaving West Point and spending a year with friendly Sioux. According to a Minnesota history account written in 1858, &quot;The year after he came to the fort young Snelling set out in company with Joseph R. Brown, a frontiersman and local celebrity, to explore the rivulet that supplies the cascade of Minne Ha-Ha, as far as Lake Minne Tonka.&quot; Both &quot;men&quot; were 17-year-old boys at the time.

Some very early records refer to the falls as &quot;Brown&#x27;s Falls&quot; which lead some historians to assume they were named after prominent pioneer Joseph R. Brown. Park Ranger Kathy Swenson, writing for the National Park Service in 2009 states: &quot;The overwhelming evidence points to Brown&#x27;s Falls (and creek) being named for Jacob Brown, major general and commander in chief of the army from 1814 to 1828 rather than for Joseph R. Brown, teenage musician at Fort Snelling and later army sergeant (1820–1828), fur trader, politician, editor, and inventor. However, I have not yet found a document that officially or specifically mentions Jacob Brown as the namesake.&quot; Swenson explains &quot;&#x27;Browns Fall/Creek&#x27; seems to be most associated with military maps and personnel while
&#x27;Little Falls/Creek&#x27; seems to be favored by those without a strong military connection although there are exceptions.&quot; The current name is Dakota for waterfall.

===&quot;The Song of Hiawatha&quot; brings fame ===

The name &quot;Minnehaha Falls&quot; was in common use by 1855, when the publication of &quot;The Song of Hiawatha&quot; by Henry Wadsworth Longfellow brought the falls worldwide fame. Longfellow&#x27;s epic poem features Hiawatha, a Native American hero who falls in love with Minnehaha, a Native American woman who later dies during a severe winter. Longfellow never visited the falls himself. He was inspired by the writings of Mary H. Eastman and Henry Rowe Schoolcraft, and by a daguerreotype created by Alexander Hesler when he chose the name for Hiawatha&#x27;s lover. The image was taken in 1852, according to a letter written by Hesler, as discussed in &quot;Minnesota History&quot; magazine. Clearly, Longfellow took the name of his character Minnehaha from the falls; the falls were not named for her.

===The &quot;Fashionable Tour&quot;===
Beginning in 1828, steamboats began to travel the Mississippi River as far north as St. Paul, the upper limit of commercial navigation on the Mississippi, until two dams and a series of locks were built between 1948 and 1963. The steamboat journey began to attract the attention of tourists, and in 1835 well known artist of American Indian life George Catlin made a trip by steamboat up the Mississippi from St. Louis to the Falls of St. Anthony and Fort Snelling. Impressed with the scenery, Catlin proposed a &quot;Fashionable Tour&quot; of the upper Mississippi, saying:

This Tour would comprehend but a small part of the great &quot;Far West&quot;; but it will furnish to the traveller a fair sample, and being a part of it which is now made so easily accessible to the world, and the only part of it to which ladies can have access, I would recommend to all who have time and inclination to devote to the enjoyment of so splendid a Tour, to wait not, but make it while the subject is new, and capable of producing the greatest degree of pleasure.

Following Catlin&#x27;s visit, each ensuing year saw an increasing number of sightseers, artists, and photographers. Hundreds of Stereoscopic View cards of the falls exist. The visitors were mainly men but a few women took the journey, most notably 80-year-old Elizabeth Schuyler Hamilton, the widow of Alexander Hamilton. The beauty of the area was also spread through moving panoramas, artistic panoramic creations that were shown much like today&#x27;s travel documentaries. Quoting from a 1939 paper written by the Minnesota Historical Society:

Crowds of people went to see these travel movies of the 1840s and 1850s and thus toured the great river vicariously. The throngs that wished to view Banvard&#x27;s panorama were so great when it was displayed in Boston and New York that railroads ran special excursions to accommodate them. In these two cities alone more than four hundred thousand people saw the exhibition. &quot;The river comes to me instead of my going to the river,&quot; wrote Longfellow. John Whittier, after seeing a panorama, sang of the &quot;new Canaan of our Israel,&quot; and Thoreau, who not only viewed a panorama but also made the tour itself, envisaged &quot;a coming heroic age in which simple and obscure men, the real heroes of history, would build the foundations of new castles [i]n the West and throw bridges across a &#x27;Rhine stream of a different kind.&#x27;&quot;

According to an account written in 1852, passengers disembarked St. Paul and &quot;[from there traveled by] stagecoach for what was called the &#x27;grand tour.&#x27; It consisted of a drive from St. Paul to St. Anthony, then out to Lakes Harriet and Calhoun, thence to the Minnehaha Falls and Fort Snelling, and by the Spring Cave [probably &quot;Fountain Cave&quot;] to St. Paul, arriving in time for the visitors, if in haste, to return with the boat down the river.&quot;

By the late 1860s the railroads had extended their rails to Minneapolis/St. Paul and they began to actively advertise Minnesota as a tourist destination. The 1878 Chicago, Burlington &amp; Quincy railway promotional booklet, &quot;A Guide to the Summer Resorts of Minnesota&quot;, told of the delights and health benefits of travel to Minnesota: &quot;The scenery is unequaled and the invigorating air is so rich in oxygen and ozone that it is unsurpassed anywhere in the world and is sure to offer to the tourist and the invalid a hearty welcome, confident that the one will surely find rest and enjoyment, and the other that much coveted of earthly blessings — health.&quot; The booklet describes the coach ride from Minneapolis to Minnehaha Falls: &quot;One of the famous trips that few tourists miss taking is that from Minneapolis to St. Paul by carriage. Starting from the former place on the west side of the river, a pleasant drive of four miles over a level prairie, brings the traveler to &quot;Where the Falls of Minnehaha Flash and gleam among the oak trees. Laugh and leap into the valley.
The round trip fare from St. Louis to Minneapolis was $30 and it featured Pullman sleeping cars. The booklet lists the population of Minneapolis as 40,000 at that time.

===Grand Rounds National Scenic Byway===
Fortunately for the generations to come, in 1883 the state legislature created the Minneapolis Board of Park Commissioners. The board began by acquiring park land near today&#x27;s downtown Minneapolis. Their choice to hire noted landscape architect Horace Cleveland was fortunate. Cleveland was hired by the Board to design a system of parks and interconnected parkways to connect and preserve the existing natural landscape. Cleveland was a preservationist by nature, respecting the natural landscape features and using the existing topography and vegetation to keep his designs as natural as possible. When the park board considered building a photographic stand in the lower glen near the falls in 1889, he responded saying:

I learn that the park commission are seriously thinking of a building at Minnehaha for the express purpose of taking photographs—on the site heretofore profaned by a shanty for that purpose. I cannot remain silent in view of this proposed vandalism which I am sure you cannot sanction—and which I am equally sure will forever be a stigma upon Minneapolis and elicit the anathema of every man of sense and taste who visits the place. If erected it will simply be pandering to the tastes of the army of boobies who think to boost themselves into notoriety by connecting their own stupid features with the representation of one of the most beautiful of God&#x27;s works.

The result of Cleveland&#x27;s vision is the famous &quot;Grand Rounds&quot;, an interconnected series of parkways and parks centered on the Mississippi River. This vision was expanded by subsequent park commissioners and superintendents to encircle a series of lakes, now known as the &quot;Chain of Lakes&quot;, and to follow Minnehaha Creek to Minnehaha Falls. The area was designated as a National Scenic Byway in 1998, and the Minneapolis Grand Rounds is known today as one of the best urban park systems in the world.

===Acquisition and development===
When Minneapolis&#x27; Park Board purchased Minnehaha Falls and surrounding land in 1889, it became one of the first state parks in the United States; only New York had created a state park by that time. The next summer the Park Board began to furnish the park with tables, seating, and lavatories. By 1893 a pavilion had been built and the park approved funding for two bridges &quot;of a rustic nature&quot;, one above the falls and the other below. A refectory was built in 1905 to serve &quot;refreshments of a clean and wholesome nature at a reasonable cost.&quot; In 1926 the park board designated the park to be a center for winter sports activities; plans were made to build a ski jump and the board purchased toboggans for rental. Major improvements including retaining walls, bridges, and stairs were made by federal Works Progress Administration (WPA) crews from 1936 to 1942.

While on the campaign trail in 1964, Lyndon B. Johnson and Minnesota Senator Hubert H. Humphrey visited the park on June 28. Johnson would go on to win the presidential election that year with Humphrey as his running mate. Their visit is commemorated with a plaque which reads:

President Lyndon B. Johnson, Senator Hubert H. Humphrey and Governor Karl Rolvaag enjoy the spray from Minnehaha Falls. On that day, however, Minneapolis was experiencing a drought. In order to create the beautiful spray of the falls pictured here the city had to open many fire hydrants upstream and out of sight, to feed water to the creek.

The park saw conflict in the 1960s when the highway department planned an elevated freeway between Minnehaha Park and Longfellow Gardens over Minnehaha Creek. The park board challenged the plan and brought the case to the U.S. Supreme Court. Fortunately for the park a similar case was decided in favor of the preservation of park land, thus setting a precedent, and the elevated freeway was never built. Eventually a highway was built in the late 1990s that routed the road through a tunnel over the creek and covered by a &quot;land bridge&quot;. A new garden, the Longfellow Garden, was established on top of the land bridge.

Major improvements were also made in the 1990s. The Pergola Garden was created to feature native wildflowers and grasses. The parking lot that once overlooked the falls was removed, replaced by a garden and a low circular wall inscribed with Longfellow&#x27;s words. The old refectory was given a veranda and a bandshell was added. In 2007 a new river overlook was built in the Wabun picnic area and included a children&#x27;s playground.

In 2011 major restoration work on the park was completed. The crumbling historic retaining walls built by the WPA in the 1930s were reinforced, eroded stream banks were restored, natural seating areas made of limestone were added, and trails and paths were improved. Landscape improvements were also done: invasive plants were removed and replaced with native plantings with deeper roots to stabilize the stream banks and prevent erosion.

By the mid-2010s, more than 850,000 people visited Minnehaha Falls each year, and it continued to be the most photographed site in Minnesota.

In 2020, during the COVID-19 pandemic and in the aftermath of protests over the murder of George Floyd, the park board passed a resolution permitting homeless encampments in city parks on an indefinite basis. Minnehaha Regional Park was one of several sites designated by the park board as capable of hosting an encampment for people experiencing homelessness.

==Description==

Minnehaha Park is situated on the banks of the Mississippi River within the Minnehaha Historic District. Located between Hiawatha Avenue and the Minnehaha Parkway, the park includes Minnehaha Creek with its falls and glen. The 167-acre park is divided into two main portions: an upper section above the falls, with grassy open areas like many other city parks, and the lower 54-acre section which is for the most part allowed to maintain its natural state. The creek runs through the upper section and after it drops at the falls, it flows through the lower glen for another three-fourths of a mile.

Minnehaha Park is a popular site for weddings and cultural festivities. Minnesota is well known for its large population of Swedish immigrants. Since 1934 Swedes have celebrated &quot;Svenskarnas Dag&quot; (Swedish Heritage Day) at the park in June of each year. The park has a bandstand with free music concerts in the summer. Bicyclists use miles of off-street trails, including the former Milwaukee Road right-of-way, which leads to Fort Snelling State Park. Bikes are available for rent, and there is an off-leash dog park area. Also located within the park are reservable outdoor picnic sites, and picnic shelters for groups, as well as playgrounds and a summer wading pool for children. The falls freeze in the winter, making the park a popular year-round attraction.

At one time the park also featured a zoo and pony rides. In 1893 the Park Board gave permission for a Shetland pony concession and also began to accept gifts of animals for a zoo in the park. The zoo grew in size, and by 1899 a bear pit and an alligator tank had been added. Although very popular, when Theodore Wirth became the new park superintendent in 1906, the zoo was removed at his urging. The animals were donated to Longfellow Gardens, but a fenced area containing deer and elk remained until 1923. To this day the area is sometimes referred to as &quot;the deer pen&quot;.

Between the 1930s and the 1950s there was also an &quot;Auto Tourist Camp&quot; where large numbers of tourists tented or stayed in small cabins. A park historian states that in those years &quot;the camp was intended to appeal to the many tourists who were traveling the country in their new
automobiles&quot;. At one time there were several grist mills located on Minnehaha Creek. The remains of a stone and earth mill dam, built in the lower glen in 1853 or 1854, is still visible beside the creek.

Gardens in the upper park area include Longfellow Gardens, Minnehaha Falls Pergola Garden, and the Song of Hiawatha Garden. The lower glen area offers examples of a surprisingly large number of trees that are native to Minnesota including basswood, black ash, maples, oaks, willows, and cottonwoods. Unusual plants include the first spring-blooming plant, skunk cabbage, often blooming so early that temperatures are still freezing and snow may still be on the ground. As the name implies, they have a disagreeable odor except to the various insects that prefer to feed on rotting flesh or dung. By consuming carbohydrates stored in its fleshy roots, skunk cabbages can maintain a temperature inside the spathe that is 15–35 degrees warmer than the surrounding air temperature. The warmth helps attract cold-blooded, early-emerging pollinating insects during early spring when temperatures are still chilly. As the spathe dies back the large, showy leaves emerge which die back by mid-August, making the plant difficult to find in late summer. Other wild flowers include wild ginger, trout lilies, anemones, marsh marigold and various ferns and sedges. The Minneapolis Park and Recreation Board is working to remove invasive species that have been introduced into the park in order to promote a healthy environment so that native species may survive and grow.

The central feature of the park, Minnehaha Falls, lies several thousand feet upstream from its original mouth where it emptied into the Mississippi River 10,000 years ago at the end of the last Great Ice Age. Erosion below the falls has exposed Minnesota&#x27;s geologic past from the present day back to over 450 million years ago, when Minnesota was covered with shallow seas.

Statues in the park include a bronze sculpture of &quot;Hiawatha and Minnehaha&quot;, by Jacob Fjelde depicting Hiawatha carrying Minnehaha. It was originally created in plaster for the Columbian Exposition in 1893, and cast in bronze and erected at the park in 1912. Other statues commemorate several notable figures including John H. Stevens, the first authorized resident on the west bank of the Mississippi River in what would become Minneapolis. He was granted permission to occupy the site, then part of the Fort Snelling military reservation, in exchange for providing ferry service to St. Anthony across the river. A statue of Swedish musician and poet Gunnar Wennerberg was placed in the park in 1915. A mask of Dakota leader Taoyateduta (Little Crow) was placed overlooking the falls in 1992.

While the name Minnehaha is often translated as &quot;Laughing Water&quot;, the correct translation is &quot;curling water&quot; or &quot;waterfall&quot;. The name comes from the Dakota language elements &quot;mni,&quot; meaning water, and &quot;ȟaȟa&quot;, meaning waterfall. Thus the expression &quot;Minnehaha Falls&quot; translates as &quot;Waterfall Falls&quot;. The &quot;Laughing Water&quot; translation comes from Mary H. Eastman&#x27;s book &quot;Dahcotah – Life and Legends of the Sioux Around Fort Snelling&quot;, published in 1849. The Dakota called Minnehaha Creek &quot;Wakpa Cistinna&quot;, meaning &quot;Little River&quot;. According to information provided by the National Park Service, an early missionary who had learned the Dakota language wrote: &quot;The Indian name, &#x27;Little Waterfall,&#x27; is given ... in speaking of the falls now called by white people &#x27;Minnehaha&#x27;. The Indians never knew it by the latter name, bestowed upon it by the whites.&quot; 
=== Minnehaha Creek and Falls===
Minnehaha Creek extends from Lake Minnetonka in the west and flows east for 22 miles (35 km) through several suburbs west of Minneapolis, and continuing through south Minneapolis. The watershed for the creek covers . Along the creek is a 53-foot (16-meter) waterfall, Minnehaha Falls, which is situated 3/4 of a mile from where the stream empties into the Mississippi River.

Minnehaha Falls is geologically linked to Saint Anthony Falls, which is the only waterfall on the Mississippi River. Roughly 10,000 years ago St. Anthony Falls was located several miles downstream on the Mississippi River at the confluence of the glacial River Warren (at present-day Ft. Snelling). Geologically, the area has a sandstone layer beneath a layer of limestone. Over the centuries, water in the river beds broke through the limestone layer, and the churning at the bottom of the falls ate away at the soft underlying sandstone. Eventually, the hard limestone cap was unsupported and broke off. Thus St. Anthony Falls receded, moving upstream at a rate of about 4 feet (1.2 m) per year. As St. Anthony Falls on the Mississippi River moved past Minnehaha Creek, a second falls was created, Minnehaha Falls, which also continued to move upstream to its present site in the park.

An island in the Mississippi River near Minnehaha Creek once existed; the receding St. Anthony Falls divided into two as it passed around the island. The falls in the channel farthest from Minnehaha Creek reached the upstream end of the island first, cutting off water to the west channel and resulting in an &quot;abandoned waterfall&quot; at the north end of the channel. The abandoned west channel is now a grassy cul-de-sac known as the &quot;Deer Pen&quot;. Locating the abandoned waterfall was made difficult in recent years since the Deer Pen was partially filled with tons of fill dirt from nearby construction projects. Today, the mouth of Minnehaha Creek where it joins the Mississippi River is the lowest surface point in the city of Minneapolis at 686 ft (209 m) above sea level.
Erosion within the last century has resulted in a falls that is fairly narrowly channeled and vigorous, notably after a heavy rain. Photographs of the waterfall from the 19th century show a much wider, curtain like character to the falls. When the creek is dry, the older, much-broader ledge can be observed. If there were sufficient interest and funding, some remedial work could theoretically restore the 19th-century appearance of the falls.

Due to extremely cold winter temperatures, the falls freeze, creating a dramatic cascade of ice that can last well into the spring. If there is a rain shortage in the autumn, the falls may virtually dry up. In the summer, especially in the rainy months of June and July, the flow can be surprisingly forceful.

On June 19, 2014, professional kayaker Hunt Jennings descended the waterfall in a kayak when it was at record height due to several days of heavy rain. The only injury sustained by Jennings was a small cut above his upper lip. A spokesperson for the Minneapolis Park and Recreation Board commented, &quot;We are deeply concerned that this act and subsequent publicity will inspire others to attempt the same feat. The impact of the drop, the large boulders at the base of the Falls, the deep water and fast current could easily injure or kill a kayaker.&quot;

== Park geology==

Visitors to the park can view the ancient geological history of Minnesota as they walk the path leading from the falls down to the Mississippi River. The uppermost layer of soils and gravels of Minnesota were deposited by the most recent Ice Age, about 10,000 years ago. Four great ice ages have swept away all traces of the more recent Mesozoic and Cenozoic eras in the Twin Cities area, however standing at the upper falls, one is standing directly on the Platteville Limestone Formation laid down during the Ordovician Period of the Paleozoic Era. During the Ordovician Period, about 450 million years ago, the North American continent was situated along the equator and a warm shallow sea covered much of Minnesota. Sea life was abundant and a large number of marine fossils including corals, bryozoans, brachiopods, clams, snails, cephalopods, and trilobites can be found in the limestone and shale sediments at several areas in the Twin Cities and along the Mississippi River in the park.

Descending to the base of the falls one passes through the layered Platteville Limestone Formation and a thin layer of Glenwood Shale. At the base of the falls one enters the level of the Saint Peter Sandstone Formation of pure white quartz sandstone. The Minnesota St. Peter Sandstone is &quot;famous the world over as &quot;the&quot; example of a well-rounded, well-sorted, pure quartz sand. It is the Ivory Snow of sediments, because it is close to 99.44% pure&quot;. This sand was first deposited as beach sand, probably eroded from earlier Cambrian sandstones, along the shores of the Ordovician sea.

At places in the park, especially closer to the Mississippi River, one can see the Glenwood Shale Formation. This thin layer of grey-green rock was probably deposited in deeper-water offshore from the beaches, and now has been exposed by erosion. Together, the three formations that are visible as one walks from the falls to the river represent a sequence of sea-level rise which occurred during the Ordovician period.

A fourth geological layer that lies above the Platteville limestone, Decorah shale, can also be found in the park. The Decorah shale formation is so packed with fossils that it has been called &quot;fossil hash&quot;. It has been washed away directly at the falls area but can be found above the Plattville limestone in the exposed river bank below Fort Snelling.

==Historical buildings==

===Minnehaha Depot===

A small train station officially named Minnehaha Depot and also known as &quot;the Princess Depot&quot; was built around 1875; it was a stop on the Milwaukee Road railroad and provided easy access to the park from Fort Snelling and Minneapolis. The depot handled as many as 39 round trips per day. The interior is complete and well-preserved, containing an iron heating stove, waiting room benches and a ticket window. In 1964, the title was transferred to the Minnesota Historical Society. The Minnesota Transportation Museum assisted in the restoration of the building, and today provides historic interpretation. The depot is open in the summer on Sundays from 1:30 to 4:30. The 50th Street / Minnehaha Park light rail station of the METRO Blue Line currently serves the park.

===Longfellow House===
Despite its name, the Longfellow House was never home to the American poet Henry Wadsworth Longfellow; it was instead the home of Robert F. Jones, a Minneapolis philanthropist and entrepreneur. Built in 1907, the house&#x27;s facade was designed to resemble Longfellow&#x27;s home in Cambridge, Massachusetts. Originally the home was part of Jones&#x27; private 4.6-acre botanical garden and zoological park near Minnehaha Falls. After Jones died, the home fell into disrepair. His will gave the property to the city which used the house as part of the Minneapolis public library from 1936 to 1967. The house was moved in 1994 and renovated. It opened as an information center in 2001. Today the home serves as the home of a botanical art school and provides offices for the Minneapolis Parks Foundation. The Longfellow House and John H. Stevens House also co-sponsor 90-minute historic nature walks around the park.

===John Harrington Stevens House ===

The John Harrington Stevens House, built in 1849 or 1850 near St. Anthony Falls (on the site where the Minneapolis Post Office now sits), was moved to Minnehaha Park in 1896. According to the Minneapolis Park and Recreation Board, the home has the distinction of being the first wood-frame dwelling built west of the Mississippi. John H. Stevens was granted permission to build his house on land controlled by Fort Snelling in exchange for providing ferry service across the Mississippi River. In subsequent years it became a hub of civic and social activity. Dubbed the &quot;Birthplace of Minneapolis&quot;, both Hennepin County and Minneapolis were organized in Stevens&#x27; home; it was in this home that the name &quot;Minneapolis&quot; was suggested.

In 1896 over 10,000 school children helped pull the house to its present location in Minnehaha Park. The children were divided into seven relay teams, each consisting of around 1,000 pupils. As teams finished their designated distance, they dropped the ropes and boarded trolley cars for the park. All went well until &quot;the lads from the South Side High School&quot; refused to give up the ropes to the next relay team. The &quot;Minneapolis Tribune&quot; reported the event:

At this point there was something of unexpected interest. Waving their school flag in triumph from the gable window of the old building the lads from the South Side High School shouted their school yell and BAD DEFIANCE TO ALL COMERS. At this point the Central High School scholars were billed to relieve the South Siders, and consequently surrounded the building. The spirit of school rivalry broke out, strong and bitter. The South Siders refused to surrender the fortress and flaunted their banner from the window in spite of all entreaties and orders. Contractor Pratt could not oust them. Supt. Jordan could not oust them, and finally Sergeant Martinson called for a detail of police and made a rush for the house. But the South Side lads were still game, and did not give up until several had been made to feel the force of police authority. Then they made a break. As they dashed from one door the Centrals entered by the other, and their banner was soon flying from the gable amid vociferous cheers. The South Siders were chased up the street by a detachment of Centrals, and for a moment it looked as if the rush would result in some bruised heads. However, good nature was restored and again the house started on its way.
The house arrived in the park at 3 pm along with the last relay team of children, having covered a distance of four miles. In the evening, 1,000 Japanese lanterns were placed about the park and the festivities included fireworks and an illumination of the falls. The Tribune newspaper reported that some people complained about the children having a day out of school and &quot;...the park commissioners and the park policemen objected to the way in which the children took possession of the park and everything in it. There was no such thing as controlling them, and they ran over everything in sight. It would have taken a small regiment of policemen to have kept that throng in check.&quot;

The house was heavily damaged by three acts of arson in 2022 and required extensive renovations to repair walls, ceilings, and voids.

<text>Minnehaha Creek () is a tributary of the Mississippi River that flows east from Gray&#x27;s Bay Dam on Lake Minnetonka through the suburban cities of Minnetonka, Hopkins, Saint Louis Park, and Edina, and the city of Minneapolis. The creek flows over Minnehaha Falls in Minnehaha Park near its mouth at the Mississippi River.

==History==

As with much of the Midwest, the area around the creek and Lake Minnetonka was originally inhabited by a native culture affiliated with the Mound Builders, but by the 1700s was occupied by the Mdewakanton People, a sub-tribe of the Dakota. The first Euro-Americans whose expedition to the area was documented were Joe Brown and Will Snelling, who canoed up the creek from Fort Snelling.

==Watershed==
The creek&#x27;s watershed covers , including the basin of Lake Minnetonka, and is managed by the Minnehaha Creek Watershed District.

<text>KSAZ-TV (channel 10) is a television station in Phoenix, Arizona, United States. It is owned and operated by the Fox network through its Fox Television Stations division alongside KUTP (channel 45), which airs MyNetworkTV programming. The two stations share studios on West Adams Street in Downtown Phoenix; KSAZ-TV&#x27;s transmitter is located atop South Mountain.

Channel 10 was the third television station established in the Phoenix area, making its first broadcast on October 24, 1953. It was originally allocated as a shared-time channel to stations run by the owners of Phoenix radio stations KOOL and KOY, though both KOOL-TV and KOY-TV operated from the same building. After a year as an independent, it became Phoenix&#x27;s original ABC affiliate in early 1954. KOOL-TV bought out KOY-TV later in 1954 and absorbed its staff, becoming a full-time station. After switching affiliations to CBS in 1955, KOOL-TV rose to become Phoenix&#x27;s highest-rated station under the ownership of Gene Autry and Tom Chauncey. A falling-out between Autry and Chauncey ended with the sale of KOOL-TV to the Gulf United Corporation in 1982; separated from its sister radio properties, channel 10 changed its call sign to KTSP-TV. Initially, the station remained the news leader in Phoenix; however, in the late 1980s and early 1990s, the station lost ground in the news ratings to an ascendant KTVK, which had poached two key KTSP-TV executives as part of a successful effort to turn itself around. Channel 10&#x27;s ratings decline was not helped by several visible personnel miscues.

In February 1994, KTSP-TV changed its call letters to KSAZ-TV. Three months later, as part of the first act in a national realignment of network affiliations initiated by then-owner New World Communications, the station announced it would switch from CBS to Fox. Phoenix was one of the most affected markets; the timing of affiliation contract expirations led to three changes in four months. KSAZ lost CBS in September 1994 but did not begin airing Fox programming until December. Coinciding with the switch to Fox was a major expansion of the station&#x27;s news department, including new morning and prime time newscasts. However, the three months of forced independent status and miscalculations around syndicated programming and new competitors caused the station&#x27;s ratings to fall dramatically, with some newscasts losing half their viewership.

Fox acquired the New World stations in 1996 and steadied the struggling operation, instituting a flashier style to bring it more in line with its target audience. From 1999 to 2021, future Arizona gubernatorial and senatorial candidate Kari Lake was one of the station&#x27;s main anchors. By 2020, KSAZ-TV produced twelve hours a day on weekdays of local news programming.

==History==
===Shared-time era and early years===
While the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) worked its way toward ending a years-long freeze on new television station grants initiated in 1948, it issued a near-final version of the table of allocations for Arizona in 1951 that gave Phoenix channels 4 (changed to 3 the next year), 5 (KPHO-TV, the only pre-freeze station in the state), 8, and 10. KOOL (960 AM), Phoenix&#x27;s CBS radio affiliate, had previously expressed interest in filing for channel 7 prior to the amended table being released, and on September 27, 1951, it applied for channel 10.

KOOL was not alone in its interest. In July 1952, KOY (550 AM), the home of the Mutual Broadcasting System in Phoenix and one of the oldest stations in the state, filed its own bid. The two bids portended what could have been years of comparative hearings over who got the construction permit. To avoid this, in May 1953, KOOL and KOY struck a deal that would result in both getting construction permits to share time on channel 10. The time-sharing proposal, first used by the FCC in television in grants for channel 10 in Rochester, New York, and suggested to KOOL and KOY by the commission, was approved on May 27, 1953, with KOOL-TV and KOY-TV getting construction permits the same day. Under the proposal, the stations would alternate daytime and evening telecasting.

KOOL was the CBS radio affiliate in Phoenix, and KOOL expressed a desire to similarly align its new television station, but this would not be immediately possible. KPHO-TV, which held both CBS and ABC hookups after KTYL-TV signed on with NBC earlier in May, had just signed a renewal agreement with CBS a month and a half before the construction permits were granted. Even though the two stations would have separate staffs and ownership, much of the physical plant would be shared, including a maximum-power transmitter site on South Mountain. Originally proposing to build television studios behind the KOY radio studios near First Avenue and Roosevelt Street, KOOL and KOY arranged instead in July to buy a former car dealership at Fifth Avenue and Adams Street; KOY wanted to continue using the other site for parking. Studio construction started in August, with KOOL and KOY crews leading the way, and a test pattern went out for the first time on October 19, 1953, ahead of both stations&#x27; October 24 launch. The next day, channel 10 carried an opening program featuring KOY and KOOL management, including KOOL majority owner Gene Autry.

As shared-time stations, KOOL-TV and KOY-TV were a conjoined unit: separate staffs, common facilities, and no network affiliation at all. This changed in January 1954, when channel 10 picked up an ABC affiliation; now, each of the three major networks had their own outlet in Phoenix. However, KOY-TV would not last much longer. In March 1954, KOOL reached a deal to buy out KOY&#x27;s stake in channel 10. KOY general manager Albert D. Johnson believed that the station would do better under one operator instead of two and stated that the goal of the shared-time venture—to avoid lengthy comparative hearings—had been met. The FCC approved of the deal—reported as $400,000 by newspapers and $200,000 to the FCC—on May 5, allowing KOOL-TV to become the sole occupant of channel 10. All staff were retained by the enlarged KOOL-TV. It was the first time any of the post-freeze shared-time arrangements had been wound down.

===CBS affiliation and Autry-Chauncey ownership===
On December 29, 1954, KOOL-TV announced it had secured the CBS affiliation in Phoenix, to begin on June 15, 1955. KPHO-TV, whose two-year affiliation agreement ended at that time, was blindsided by the move, but it was a natural fit. Not only was KOOL radio already CBS in Phoenix, but Gene Autry had deep ties to CBS radio and television, as well as Columbia Records. ABC soon found a new home: startup outlet KTVK (channel 3), which joined that network on March 1, 1955.
As a full-time CBS affiliate, it was now able to feature Autry&#x27;s show &quot;Gene Autry&#x27;s Melody Ranch&quot; on its schedule. Tom Chauncey, who also owned the biggest Arabian horse ranch in Phoenix, was a minority partner with Autry. Over the years, KOOL-TV ran nearly the entire CBS schedule; Chauncey was a fierce loyalist to the network. In addition to local news, channel 10 produced a series of other local programs, such as the bilingual children&#x27;s program &quot;Niños Contentos&quot; and investigative and feature series &quot;Chapter 10&quot; and &quot;Copperstate Cavalcade&quot;.

Phoenix audiences&#x27; loyalty to KOOL-TV was proven in 1971. That September, a group of Valley business leaders led by Del Webb, organized as the Valley of the Sun Broadcasting Company, filed an application for a competing channel 10 proposal to KOOL-TV&#x27;s license renewal; this group proposed to return the channel to Phoenix-based ownership. However, the KOOL-TV license challenge was met with a decidedly cool reception by viewers and power brokers alike. Senators Barry Goldwater and Paul Fannin and governor Jack Williams threw their support behind KOOL; Goldwater noted he often cited KOOL as an example of a quality television station, Fannin was &quot;amazed&quot; to learn of the counterproposal, and Williams—a former broadcaster—lauded its &quot;record of public service&quot; and inclusion of minority groups. Further, hundreds of phone calls and letters in support of KOOL were received by the station. Ten days after the application was first made public, Valley of the Sun abandoned their channel 10 bid. It was later revealed that the same Washington law firm had backed a string of similar license challenges to other stations across the country. After the license challenge was rebuffed, Chauncey became the majority stakeholder as a result of a sale of shares by Autry.

In 1978, KOOL AM was sold to Stauffer Communications of Topeka, Kansas, with the FM and television stations remaining under the Autry–Chauncey ownership. However, cracks began to form in the longtime ownership partnership of KOOL-FM-TV. That same year, Autry allegedly began to try and induce Chauncey to reach an agreement with Signal Oil upon which the latter company would have the option to buy Chauncey&#x27;s stake at his death. Chauncey then began negotiating to buy Autry out. These talks ended in April 1981 when Autry sold half of his 48.11-percent stake in the company to the Gulf United Corporation of Jacksonville, Florida. That May, Autry sued Chauncey, alleging that he had mismanaged the assets of KOOL Radio-Television, Inc., to the tune of millions of dollars and had diverted company funds to Arabian horses, cars, and airplanes. Chauncey then filed a countersuit, accusing Autry and Gulf of racketeering and trying to pressure longtime manager Homer Lane, who owned a small but pivotal stake in the firm, to sell. In the wake of the dueling lawsuits, and as early as November 1981, speculation began to circulate that Chauncey and Lane were nearing a sale of their stakes to Gulf.

===Gulf, Taft, and Great American===
On June 8, 1982, Tom Chauncey and Gulf United announced that the latter was buying out the remaining shares in KOOL-TV, with KOOL-FM to be retained by Chauncey and split from the firm; the dueling lawsuits would be dropped when the FCC approved the transaction.
The sale closed on October 1, 1982, a month after receiving FCC approval, and major changes followed at channel 10. The first was a change in call sign, as the FM retained the KOOL designation. The next morning, KOOL-TV became KTSP-TV; while Gulf claimed that it stood for &quot;Tempe, Scottsdale, Phoenix&quot;, the more likely reason was that it mirrored another channel 10 station owned by Gulf, WTSP in St. Petersburg, Florida. Homer Lane, the general manager and minority owner, was replaced by Jack Sander, hired from WTOL in Toledo, Ohio. Gulf also invested in new production equipment to give KTSP a more high-tech look, and it completed a project started under Chauncey to replace the transmitter and tower on South Mountain.
In 1985, Taft Broadcasting acquired Gulf Broadcasting, which had been spun out of Gulf United two years prior. The deal included the entire chain, but so interested was Taft in Phoenix that it obtained an option to buy KTSP-TV alone for $250 million if the entire Gulf deal were to collapse, and KTSP-TV was the most expensive of the properties it purchased from Gulf. Not long after Taft acquired Gulf, however, a major management change occurred that would have long-term ramifications in Phoenix television. KTVK, which had until that time been a perennial third-place finisher in local news, poached Bill Miller, channel 10&#x27;s news director, to be its station manager and hired Phil Alvidrez, the KTSP-TV assistant news director, to run its newsroom. The two hires by channel 3 were partly responsible for KTVK climbing to the top of the Phoenix television market in the late 1980s and early 1990s. On October 12, 1987, Taft was restructured into Great American Broadcasting after the company went through a hostile takeover by investors led by Carl Lindner. KTSP nearly lost its CBS affiliation in 1988; CBS was in negotiations to purchase KPHO from Meredith Corporation. Network officials were interested in buying a station in a fast-growing Sun Belt market. However, talks foundered when neither party could agree to a purchase price.

Other subsidiaries of Great American Communications Corporation filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy in 1993, a move that did not affect the television and radio holdings. The station changed its call sign to KSAZ-TV on February 12, 1994, to match its new slogan, &quot;The Spirit of Arizona&quot;.

===As a Fox station===
After emerging from bankruptcy, Great American Broadcasting (renamed Citicasters soon after) put four of its stations (including KSAZ-TV) up for sale, seeking to raise money to pay down debt and fund more acquisitions in radio. KSAZ-TV, along with WDAF-TV in Kansas City, Missouri; WGHP in High Point, North Carolina; and WBRC in Birmingham, Alabama, were sold to New World Communications on May 5, 1994, for $360 million.

Just 18 days later, New World announced that twelve of its 15 stations (those it already owned and those it was in the process of acquiring) would switch their varying Big Three network affiliations to Fox, which had been affiliated with KNXV-TV (channel 15). A major catalyst for the Fox-New World deal was the network&#x27;s newly signed contract with the National Football League&#x27;s National Football Conference. New World&#x27;s portfolio, dominated by CBS affiliates, included many stations that had long aired the home games of NFC teams in their home cities, such as KSAZ and the Phoenix Cardinals.

The affiliation changes—three of them in all—played out in phases. CBS was the first to move, returning to KPHO-TV on September 10, 1994, after 39 years on channel 10. However, KNXV&#x27;s affiliation contract with Fox did not run out for another three months. In the interim, KSAZ-TV became an independent station, filling the holes once occupied by CBS programming with movies and additional syndicated shows while also using the opportunity to debut a suite of new news programs. Fox programs moved to KSAZ on December 12.
In the aftermath of the change, channel 10 management faced the task of melding the station&#x27;s more mainstream image with the new Fox programming, which proved difficult. Not only did the news programs rate poorly, but the station let go of valuable news lead-ins &quot;Jeopardy!&quot; and &quot;Wheel of Fortune&quot; as skewing too old in viewership, and the competition by KTVK and KNXV was more aggressive than KSAZ-TV had anticipated. In June 1995, general manager Ron Bergamo resigned after seven years and in the wake of sweeps figures showing the station&#x27;s news ratings in some time slots had fallen by as much as 50 percent; that same month, an article in &quot;The Dallas Morning News&quot; called what happened to KSAZ a &quot;worst-case scenario&quot;. Revenue reportedly dipped across the New World stations by 15 percent after their switches; New World management, however, also noted that the three months without network programming had led to the decline being more pronounced at KSAZ than elsewhere. As with most other New World stations, KSAZ declined to run Fox Kids programming, which instead moved to KTVK; in September 1995, KASW (channel 61), a station programmed by KTVK, launched with The WB and Fox Kids programs.

News Corporation purchased New World Communications, acquiring only its ten Fox-affiliated stations, in July 1996; the merger was finalized on January 22, 1997, making KSAZ an owned-and-operated station of Fox. This status almost became short-lived: in February 1997, Fox nearly traded KSAZ and sister station KTBC in Austin, Texas, to the Belo Corporation in exchange for Seattle&#x27;s KIRO-TV. Fox began to upgrade the station&#x27;s programming, adding some high-rated off-network sitcoms (such as &quot;M*A*S*H&quot;, &quot;Seinfeld&quot; and &quot;King of the Hill&quot;) as well as higher-rated syndicated court and reality shows. In the 2010s, Fox began to use KSAZ-TV and other stations on a regular basis to test new programs that later entered national syndication, such as &quot;TMZ Live&quot;—which KSAZ was the second station to air—and &quot;The Real&quot;.

Fox Television Stations purchased KUTP (channel 45) in 2001 as part of its acquisition of United Television; this resulted in the creation of Phoenix&#x27;s second television duopoly.

In 2006, Jordin Sparks won an opportunity to audition for &quot;American Idol&quot; after winning KSAZ&#x27;s own &quot;Arizona Idol&quot; competition; she ultimately went on to win the season.

==News operation==

In 1964, Chauncey merged the KOOL radio and television news departments into a single division under the management of Bill Close, formerly of KOY radio. Close was an 18-year veteran of Phoenix radio and television at the time, and KOOL billed him as &quot;the Dean of Arizona Newscasters&quot;. The newsroom grew from six people when Close arrived to 23 by 1970, making it the largest among Phoenix&#x27;s four news-producing stations; a helicopter, the first of several, was also added to the KOOL arsenal at that time. Under Close&#x27;s watch, &quot;KOOL News 10&quot; became the perennial news leader in Phoenix. At one point, channel 10&#x27;s dominance was so absolute that its 6 p.m. newscast (anchored by Close) attracted 46 percent of all TV households in the market, the same share as the &quot;CBS Evening News with Walter Cronkite&quot;. The news department was largely a reflection of the bola tie-wearing Close. According to his longtime anchor desk partner, Mary Jo West—the second full-time female anchor in Phoenix—Close took a fatherly attitude toward his reporters and placed a high premium on accuracy and professionalism.

The station&#x27;s success produced people who went on to larger jobs, both in and out of Phoenix. In 1979, Kent Dana—who would become a fixture at KPNX and later KPHO—was hired from KOOL-TV, where he was anchoring the weekend news, by channel 12. KOOL was also the first Phoenix television station to win a Peabody Award, doing so in 1980 for a documentary, &quot;The Long Eyes of Kitt Peak&quot;.

On May 28, 1982, at about 5 pm, Joseph Billie Gwin, wanting to &quot;prevent World War III&quot;, forced his way into the KOOL-TV studios and fired a shot from his gun. The butt of the gun struck Luis Villa in the back of the head; Gwin then held Villa in a chokehold, at gunpoint, for nearly five hours. Gwin took four people hostage and demanded nationwide airtime. Two of the hostages, Jack Webb and Bob Cimino, were released three hours later. At 9:30 pm, anchor Bill Close read a 25-minute statement as Gwin sat next to him holding a gun under the table; Close took Gwin&#x27;s gun after the statement and set it on the table. Gwin surrendered to the police following the broadcast of the statement; he was charged with kidnapping, assault, and burglary and was later declared insane. Gwin was put on parole and placed in a halfway house but violated that parole after assaulting two convenience store clerks in 1984; he was released from prison in 2006.

Channel 10 remained at the top of the ratings for a time after becoming KTSP-TV. However, in the late 1980s, after KTVK poached Miller and Alvidrez, channel 10&#x27;s news ratings began to decline, not helped by a series of unforced errors. In 1989, KTSP newscaster Shelly Jamison left the station after appearing as both a cover model and posing nude in a &quot;Playboy&quot; pictorial. The most publicized move, however, was the 1991 dismissal of anchor Karen Carns, who found out she had been fired 15 minutes before the evening newscast when a newspaper reporter called to get her reaction. In the February 1992 sweeps, KTSP-TV lost the lead at 6 p.m. in both the Arbitron and Nielsen ratings, the first time in memory that it had failed to win that timeslot. That year, Close retired from channel 10 after a 28-year career, having stepped down from the anchor desk four years earlier.

With the Fox switch, KSAZ-TV added 30 news staffers and increased its news output from three hours a day to seven, with the addition of the two-hour morning newscast &quot;Arizona Morning&quot;, an additional early evening newscast at 5:30 pm, and a 9 p.m. news hour, &quot;Arizona Prime&quot;. A simulcast of KTAR talk show &quot;McMahon Live&quot; with Pat McMahon was also added in late mornings. However, the switch proved to be very messy for the newsroom. Close, who said he felt &quot;betrayed&quot; by the affiliation switch, predicted that the station would lose its standing in local news. Ratings for KSAZ-TV&#x27;s other newscasts declined after the switch, prompting morale to fall. &quot;Arizona Morning&quot; was retooled just months after its debut, and Heidi Foglesong—the former KTVK anchor who was the show&#x27;s centerpiece—left after just over a year. The McMahon program was dropped in January 1996.

After two years of a news product that was more staid and conservative than had become the norm for a Fox station, things began to change in 1996 under new news director Bill Berra, who promised to &quot;bring up the intensity&quot;. Presentation was revamped that fall; the sound of an emergency siren was incorporated into the opening of the 10 p.m. newscast. One anchor, June Thomson, increased her delivery speed at the behest of the new management, but the relationship broke down, and Thomson took a job at KGO-TV in San Francisco. She told the &quot;San Francisco Examiner&quot; that the station practiced &quot;crime and body-bag journalism, just like Miami&quot; and that she &quot;watched the destruction of a once-fine newsroom&quot; at channel 10. Arizona Prime was replaced in April 1997 with &quot;Fox 10 News at Nine&quot;.

On April 1, 2009, Fox Television Stations and the E. W. Scripps Company, owner of KNXV-TV, announced the formation of Local News Service, a model for pooling newsgathering efforts for local news events in which each station provided employees to the pool service in exchange for the sharing of video. KPHO-TV eventually joined the Phoenix LNS agreement shortly after the announcement. By 2020, all four English-language television newsrooms in Phoenix shared a helicopter.

In 2014, KSAZ debuted an expanded Saturday morning newscast and a new Sunday morning news hour. KSAZ added a 4 p.m. weekday news hour, a second half-hour to its 10 p.m. newscast, and a 7 p.m. nightly hour of news for KUTP in 2018. By 2020, KSAZ-TV&#x27;s daily news output had reached twelve hours on weekdays.

Phoenix was also the starting point for LiveNow from Fox, the over-the-top streaming news offering from the Fox television stations. It began as &quot;Fox 10 News Now&quot; in November 2014, streaming for seven hours a day on the station&#x27;s website and YouTube channel. In 2020, production of the service was spread between the Fox stations in Phoenix, Orlando, and Los Angeles.

==Technical information==
===Subchannels===
The station&#x27;s signal is multiplexed:

Virtual channel 10.2 is assigned to a KUTP simulcast of 10.1 for the convenience of UHF antenna viewers. Three subchannels on the multiplex are hosted for KASW, Phoenix&#x27;s ATSC 3.0 (NextGen TV) station, which in turn broadcasts KSAZ in that format.

===Analog-to-digital conversion===
KSAZ-TV began broadcasting a digital signal, initially in standard definition only, on October 15, 2000. KSAZ-TV shut down its analog signal, over VHF channel 10, at 8:30 a.m. on June 12, 2009, the official date on which full-power television stations in the United States transitioned from analog to digital broadcasts under federal mandate. The station&#x27;s digital signal relocated from its pre-transition UHF channel 31 to VHF channel 10 for post-transition operations.

<doc id="838311" wikidata="Q273608" url="?curid=838311" title="Marie Anne de Mailly-Nesle">
<text>Marie Anne de Mailly-Nesle, duchesse de Châteauroux (; 5 October 1717 – 8 December 1744) was the youngest of the five famous &quot;de Nesle&quot; sisters, four of whom would become the mistress of King Louis XV of France. She was his mistress from 1742 until 1744.

== Early life, family and marriage ==

Marie Anne was born the youngest daughter of Louis de Mailly, Marquis de Nesle et de Mailly, Prince d&#x27;Orange (1689 - 1767), and Armande Félice de La Porte Mazarin (1691 - 1729). Her parents had been married in 1709. Her mother was the daughter of Paul Jules de La Porte, duc Mazarin et de La Meilleraye (1666 - 1731), the son of the famous adventuress, Hortense Mancini, the niece of Cardinal Mazarin. Her mother was a lady-in-waiting in service to the queen, and her father reportedly &quot;wasted his substance on actresses and the capacious requirements of Court life&quot;. 
Marie Anne had four older full sisters:

* Louise Julie de Mailly, &quot;Mademoiselle de Mailly, comtesse de Mailly&quot; (1710 - 1751),
* Pauline Félicité de Mailly, &quot;Mademoiselle de Nesle, marquise de Vintimille&quot; (1712 - 1741),
* Diane Adélaïde de Mailly, &quot;Mademoiselle de Montcavrel, duchesse de Lauraguais&quot; (1714 - 1769),
* Hortense Félicité de Mailly, &quot;Mademoiselle de Chalon, marquise de Flavacourt&quot; (1715 - 1799).

The only one of the &quot;de Nesle&quot; sisters not to become one of Louis XV&#x27;s mistresses was the Marquise de Flavacourt. Louise Julie was the first sister to attract the king followed by Pauline Félicité, but it was Marie Anne who was the most successful in manipulating him and becoming politically powerful.

Marie Anne also had a younger half-sister, Henriette de Bourbon (1725 - 1780), &quot;Mademoiselle de Verneuil&quot;, from her mother&#x27;s relationship with the &quot;duc de Bourbon&quot;, the chief minister of Louis XV from 1723 to 1726.

In her youth, Marie Anne was known as &quot;Mademoiselle de Monchy&quot;. On 19 June 1734, she married Jean Baptiste Louis, marquis de La Tournelle (1708-1740).

She was a friend of Charlotte Aglaé d&#x27;Orléans, granddaughter of Louis XIV and Madame de Montespan.

== Royal Mistress ==

===Introduction===
In 1732, Marie Anne&#x27;s oldest sister Louise Julie, who had succeeded their mother as lady-in-waiting to the queen, caught the attention of King Louis XV, and was permitted by her spouse to become a royal mistress. Although she became the king&#x27;s mistress in 1732, Louise Julie was not officially recognized as his &quot;maîtresse en titre&quot; until 1738. Louise Julie did not use her new position at court to enrich herself or to interfere in politics.

Louise Julie was devoted to her family, and it was said that she was &quot;a loving, sincere little creature with all the qualities of an easy dupe, and she was happy to Introduce her sisters at Court for the sole reason that it gave them pleasure&quot;. She invited all her sisters to court on different occasions and helped them to establish themselves there socially. In 1739, Louise Julie received a letter from her younger sister Pauline-Félicité requesting to be invited to court. Louise Julie granted her sister&#x27;s wish, but upon her arrival at court, Pauline-Félicité seduced the king and became his mistress.

While Louise Julie remained as the official mistress, the king fell in love with Pauline-Félicité, arranged for her to marry the marquis de Vintimille to enable her to stay at court, and gave her the castle of Choisy-le-Roi as a gift. Madame de Vintimille quickly became pregnant by the king, and she died giving birth to his illegitimate son, Louis, the duc de Luc, who looked so much like the king that he was called &quot;Demi-Louis&quot; (&#x27;Small Louis&#x27;). 
Madame de Vintimille&#x27;s remains stood in &quot;Lit de parade&quot; in the town of Versailles, but during the night, a mob broke in and mutilated the body of &quot;the king&#x27;s whore&quot;. The king and Madame de Mailly were both devastated by the death of Madame de Vintimille and shocked by the mutilation of her body. In her despair, Louise Julie is said to have performed a Catholic rite of penitence by washing the feet of the poor.

After this, the recently widowed Marie Anne de Mailly, asked Louise Julie for an invitation to court, and successfully relied upon her family devotion to help her establish herself socially at court, where she made a great social success upon her introduction with her beauty and charm. Marie Anne was described as &quot;magnificently beautiful&quot;, dignified and graceful, with fair hair, &quot;a complexion so white and pure that it glowed&quot;, large blue eyes and red lips with a &quot;childlike smile&quot;, and to her behavior as a charming wit who frequently used irony.

===Struggle with Louise Julie de Mailly===
Louise Julie de Mailly was known to be so in love with the king that she &quot;could do nothing without asking his advice&quot; and never involved herself with state affairs. This made her acceptable to Cardinal Fleury, but also a disappointment to the court nobility who wished for the king to have a mistress who could influence the king against the pacifist policy of Fleury and engage in warfare, which the ideals of nobility regarded as necessary for national dignity and glory. Among the war-favoring aristocrats were the king&#x27;s friends, the manipulative duc de Richelieu, and Charles, Prince of Soubise, who supported the idea to introduce a new mistress to the king who could be used to oppose the influence of the Cardinal and his peace policy and push France to engage in war, and they viewed Louise Julie&#x27;s sister Marie Anne de Mailly, marquise de La Tournelle, as a suitable candidate for this purpose.

At a masked ball on Shrove Tuesday, 1742, Richelieu led Marie Anne up to the king and introduced them. She herself, however, at first rejected the royal advances. She already had a lover, the young duc d&#x27;Agénois, and was not inclined to give him up for the king&#x27;s sake. As a result, Louis conspired with Richelieu, who was d&#x27;Agénois&#x27;s uncle, to rid himself of the young suitor. Richelieu was quite anxious to do anything to bring about a liaison between the king and Marie Anne de La Tournelle because he knew Louise Julie de Mailly did not view him in a kindly light. The result was that Louis, in imitation of the biblical David, sent his rival to fight the Austrians in Italy. Here, more fortunate than the husband of Bathsheba, the duc d&#x27;Agénois was only wounded and returned to the court in glory.

Louis was in despair, but Richelieu, was not one to lightly accept defeat. He sent his nephew to Languedoc, where a woman had been instructed to seduce him. This she did most effectively; letters of a very passionate nature were exchanged; the lady dispatched those which she received to Richelieu, and in due course they were brought to the notice of Marie Anne de La Tournelle, who, furious at her young duke&#x27;s deceitfulness, turned her attentions to the king and agreed to the suggestion of Richeliu and Soubise.

The fall of Louise Julie de Mailly was orchestrated by means of depriving her of her official office as lady-in-waiting, which was her formal justification for participating in court life and without which she would not formally be allowed to live at court. On 13 September 1742, Amable-Gabrielle de Villars, previously a &quot;dame du palais&quot;, was promoted to &quot;dame d&#x27;atour&quot;, and there was thereby a vacancy among the ladies-in-waiting of the queen. The recently deceased Françoise de Mazarin, a personal friend of the queen, had shortly before her death wished for a post for her favorite step-granddaughter Marie Anne de Mailly, in order to embarrass Louise Julie de Mailly, whom she detested, and the queen herself asked for the vacant place to be given to Marie Anne de Mailly, and by the mediation of d&#x27;Argenson, Marie Anne secured the king&#x27;s approval for her candidacy to this office as &quot;dame du palais&quot;. In parallel, Marie Anne persuaded Louise Julie to write to Cardinal Fleury and resign her own post as &quot;dame de palais&quot; in favor of their sister Flavacourt by convincing her that the king wished to favor her sisters for the sake of Louise Julie. She agreed, though she resigned on condition that she be compensated with the post of dame d&#x27;atours at the court of the next &quot;dauphine&quot;. 
When Cardinal Fleury received her request of resignation, he called upon her and warned her about the danger it would mean to her position, and Jean-Frédéric Phélypeaux, Count of Maurepas warned her: &quot;Madame, you do not know your sister, de la Tournelle; when you hand over your office to her, you may expect your dismissal from Court&quot;. Louise Julie, however, refused to suspect her sisters for plotting against her or to retract her resignation, and after her resignation was accepted, she accompanied her sisters Marie Anne de Mailly and Flavacourt to the king and queen to offer the gratitude of herself and her sisters for their new appointments. Although the queen retracted her approval, Marie Anne was appointed to the position on 19 September, and the next day, Cardinal Fleury refused Louise Julie&#x27;s compensatory future post as &quot;dame d&#x27;atours&quot; of the dauphine. Marie Anne had thereby secured a place for herself at court, and deprived Louise Julie of hers.

After her resignation as lady-in-waiting, the court stopped giving Louise Julie attention and instead turned it to her sister and expected successor Marie Anne de Mailly, whom Louis XV himself started to court openly. However, Marie Anne de Mailly was not in love with Louis, and she presented him with conditions before she agreed to consent to be his mistress. She refused intercourse until he had proved his love by agreeing to provide her with the title of duchess, together with a settled income sufficient to enable her to maintain that dignity and safeguard herself against any reversal of fortune; a house &quot;as sumptuous as Madame de Montespan&#x27;s had been&quot;, where she would be able to entertain the king in accordance with royal standards; an assurance that any children born of the union would be provided for and legitimized; to be properly courted before consent, and the dismissal of her sister, his official mistress, from court, and she herself officially acknowledged in her place.

This was a new experience for the king, whose previous sexual partners had never demanded that he court them in any way or made any terms, but he was successfully stimulated to court her by Richelieu, who compared her favorably to his previous lover and presented Marie Anne as a royal mistress to be proud of. The king&#x27;s courting of the reluctant Marie Anne before the royal court attracted attention, and a song was hummed at court and in town, portraying the lovesick king and his attempts to convince the cold Marie Anne to become his mistress. The king reportedly fell passionately in love with her, but she refused to answer his letters and acted coldly. During his courting of Marie Anne, he reportedly treated Louise Julie more and more coldly, sitting in silence through their meals, talking to her only about his hopes to seduce her sister, causing her to cry. Repeatedly, scenes occurred during which he asked Louise Julie to leave court, after which she fell to his feet and begged him to be allowed to stay, upon which he would allow her a couple of days more.

Finally, Louis XV agreed to the list of demands of Marie Anne, and on 2 November 1742, he concluded the first demand and evicted Louise Julie de Mailly from court by having the furniture removed from her rooms next to the king&#x27;s apartments on the pretext that they had been reserved for her sister Flavacourt. She convinced the king to grant her another night through an appeal at supper, but the next day, she refused to leave. Richelieu visited her and advised her to leave out of respect for her own dignity and as a duty to her king, and when she consented, Richelieu informed the king that Marie Anne would agree to meet him that very night provided that it would be a secret, and escorted him in disguise to the house of Richelieu for the meeting. However, Louise Julie would still not leave, and Marie Anne was discontent at the king&#x27;s patience. Louise Julie successfully asked for a last dinner with the king, and when she cried upon departure, he embraced her and promised to meet her a couple of days after her departure.

Marie Anne displayed her discontent over the king&#x27;s last promise to see Louise Julie again and demanded that Louis should retract his promise of a last encounter, and that Louise Julie should never be allowed to court again if he wished to keep her favor. In a letter written soon after, Marie Anne wrote to Richelieu: &quot;Meuse has surely told you, uncle, of the trouble which I had in getting Madame de Mailly to budge&quot;, but added that it would still be difficult to achieve something in politics as long as Cardinal Fleury lived.

Cardinal Fleury, the king&#x27;s chief minister, tried to intervene with the king because he preferred Madame de Mailly as a royal mistress to her more ambitious sister. He did not want Marie Anne interfering in his administration of France. Louis, however, curtly informed him that while he had given the prelate control over the kingdom&#x27;s political affairs, he had not given him control over his personal life.

===Royal Mistress===

Despite having achieved the banishment of her predecessor and the king&#x27;s agreement to her demands, Marie Anne de Mailly reportedly refused to fulfill the sexual union with Louis XV several times from November until 19 December 1742, after which she &quot;ostentatiously showed herself at the opera so that Louis&#x27; 
choice might be approved&quot;, and installed herself in the royal favorite&#x27;s apartment three days after.

In preparation for her own elevation to duchess, she arranged a marriage between her favorite sister, Diane Adelaide, to the Duke of Lauraguais, and secured her a dowry and the office of designated lady-in-waiting to the future bride of the crown prince. On 22 October 1743, letters patent were issued creating Marie Anne duchesse de Chateauroux with a duchy representing an annual income of 80,000 &quot;livres&quot;.

The king &quot;asked for nothing more than a place among those who formed her little court&quot;, was in despair when she refused to attend his dinners, begged her to be allowed to join the suppers in her room, curtailed his councils so that he could be with her, attending her baths and sitting at her bedside while she was recovering from them, and could be observed writing letters to the duc de Richelieu under her direction. 
As royal mistress, Marie Anne was the hostess in the King&#x27;s private apartments where she was known to provide amusement and gaiety and introduced the custom of using nicknames. She herself was known as &quot;the princess&quot;, her sister Flavacourt as &quot;the hen&quot;, and her sister Lauraguais as the &quot;Street of Evil Words&quot;. Her sister Lauraguais was said to be entertaining and once amused the king by producing nicknames for his guests, calling d’Argenson ”the sucking calf&quot;, Monsieur de Florentin ”the sucking pig ”, Monsieur de Maurepas ”the spinning-cat&quot;, and Cardinal de Tencin
”the ostrich&quot;.

Cardinal Fleury&#x27;s death on 29 January 1743 signified the beginning of her own political career as the successor of Fleury, the political adviser of Louis XV, and the &quot;de facto&quot; ruler of France. 
Marie Anne made the king comfortable confiding in her about political issues by giving the impression that she was indifferent to it and made him ask her advice by supporting his own ideas. &quot;She had the supreme cleverness never to question Louis on affairs of State, and so the infatuated King was convinced that his pretty mistress took no interest in politics. The voluptuous nonchalance of her intimacy with him confirmed this opinion. The consequence was that he spoke with her of State affairs without apprehension, and even went so far as to consult her, nay, beg her, to be so kind as to give him advice. In this way she slipped into the government at the King’s request without him being aware of it.&quot;
She only spoke in favor of people she knew he already liked and would be favorable to such as d&#x27;Argensson and Noailles, thereby giving him the impression that she only voiced his own views whenever she spoke of politics, and the king thereby felt comfortable saying that his mistress&#x27; opinions was his own.

However, her influence was opposed by Jean-Frédéric Phélypeaux, Count of Maurepas and his circle whose satirical rhymes started the development which resulted in the loss of respect for the king and his court among the people. When Richelieu was appointed first gentleman of the Bed Chamber the Parisians nicknamed him &quot;the President of La Tournelle&quot;, alluding to Marie Anne&#x27;s former title.

Marie Anne reportedly felt threatened by her sister Flavacourt, who distanced herself from her and whom she therefore suspected of having the ambition to replace her as royal mistress. She suspected the queen of trying to disturb her relationship with the king by presenting Flavacourt as a rival to her position. While the queen regarded Louise Julie de Mailly as the most hurtful of all the mistresses of Louis because she was the first one, she had grown accustomed to her, and she disliked Marie Anne on a more personal level. The queen regarded her as haughty and insolent, seldom spoke to her, and feigned sleep when Marie Anne was in attendance. 
In reality, de Flavacourt had no wish to become a royal mistress and only wanted to enjoy her position as a courtier because it gave her independence from her spouse.

===War of the Austrian Succession===
When her influence over state affairs was secured, the War-Party of Richelieu demanded progress in their military warfare ambitions. Directed by Richelieu, himself dominated by Madame de Tencin who allegedly originated the idea, Marie Anne was given the task to shake the king out of his passive nature and convince him to place himself at the head of his armies on the battlefield during the War of the Austrian Succession, so as to give him and France prestige. The task was to have appealed to Marie Anne&#x27;s pride, ambition, and wish to become a heroine. She worked to stimulate the king&#x27;s pride and sense of responsibility, exclaiming that he owed it to himself to become a great king. Louis XV, exhausted by her reproaches, reportedly cried, &quot;You are killing me&quot;, upon which she replied, &quot;Sire, a King must come to life again&quot;. He was ultimately persuaded to agree when she stated that the glory of a victory would win the adoration of the people and the downfall of his enemies. In April 1744, Louis XV appointed her future Superintendent of the Household to the future Dauphine, took command of his army, and left for the front at the Austrian Netherlands. It was reportedly Marie Anne who convinced Louis XV to make an alliance between France and Frederick II of Prussia during the War of the Austrian Succession, and she received in person the thanks of Frederick of Prussia.

She visited Louis XV when he was with his army at Dunkerque and again in Metz. When Marie Anne visited the king in Metz near the front she was accompanied by Diane Adélaïde. Besides being an amiable companion, Marie Anne did not consider her simple sister much of a rival. It was rumoured at the time that one of the methods by which Marie Anne kept the interest of the king was to periodically offer him a &quot;ménage à trois&quot; with her sister, Diane Adélaïde de Lauraguais. That Lauraguais actually began sleeping with the king at this point is debatable. Nevertheless, the widespread rumors made the two sisters&#x27; visit to the king in Metz a national scandal. During the notorious visit of the sisters in Metz, the king suddenly fell gravely ill on 8 August. Fearing to be at his deathbed, Louis XV was afflicted by a religious crisis and wished to renounce his adultery and mistresses and ask his wife for her forgiveness. The queen was called to Metz, and Marie Anne and Diane Adélaïde ordered to leave. During their journey back to Paris the sisters were taunted by mobs who threatened to lynch them and their coach was attacked with stones.

===Death===
Louis XV recovered from his illness and upon his return from the battlefield made a triumphal entry into Paris. Missing Marie Anne, he visited her in secret on 14 November. On the 25th, minister Maurepas was obliged to recall Marie Anne to Versailles where she was restored in her former position as royal mistress. Her return to court was described as a triumph and there were fears that she would exact revenge upon her enemies. However, she had barely arrived at court before she fell sick with convulsive pains and cramp attacks. She died on 8 December 1744, convinced on her deathbed that she had been poisoned. She was swiftly buried without ceremony in the church of St Sulpice in Paris in 13 December.

After her death, the king for a short time consoled himself with her sister, Diane Adélaïde de Lauraguais. A few months later in 1745, however, the king already had a new mistress, Madame de Pompadour.

==Depiction in fiction==
Marie Anne is one of the central characters in Sally Christie&#x27;s &quot;The Sisters of Versailles&quot; (Simon&amp;Schuster 2015), a novel about Louis XV and the notorious Mailly-Nesle sisters.

Marie Anne is also the mistress on the King&#x27;s arm depicted in Season 2, Episode 2 of Outlander.

<text>Raymond William Postgate (6 November 1896 – 29 March 1971) was an English socialist, writer, journalist and editor, social historian, mystery novelist, and gourmet who founded the &quot;Good Food Guide&quot;. He was a member of the Postgate family.

==Biography==

===Early life===

Raymond Postgate was born in Cambridge, the eldest son of John Percival Postgate and Edith Allen, Postgate was educated at St John&#x27;s College, Oxford, where, despite being sent down for a period because of his pacifism, he gained a First in Honour Moderations in 1917.

Postgate sought exemption from World War I military service as a conscientious objector on socialist grounds, but was allowed only non-combatant service in the army, which he refused to accept. Arrested by the civil police, he was brought before Oxford Magistrates&#x27; Court, which handed him over to the Army. Transferred to Cowley Barracks, Oxford, for forcible enlistment in the Non-Combatant Corps, he was within five days found medically unfit for service and discharged. Fearful of a possible further attempt at conscription, he went &quot;&quot; for a period. While he was in Army hands, his sister Margaret campaigned on his behalf, in the process meeting the socialist writer and economist G. D. H. Cole, whom she subsequently married. In 1918 Postgate married Daisy Lansbury, daughter of the journalist and Labour Party politician George Lansbury, and was barred from the family home by his Tory father.

===Communist period===

From 1918 Postgate worked as a journalist on the &quot;Daily Herald&quot;, then edited by his father-in-law, Lansbury. In 1920 he published &quot;Bolshevik Theory&quot;, a book brought to Lenin’s attention by HG Wells. Impressed with the analysis therein, Lenin sent a signed photograph to Postgate, which he kept for the rest of his life. A founding member of the British Communist Party in 1920, Postgate left the &quot;Herald&quot; to join his colleague Francis Meynell on the staff of the CP&#x27;s first weekly, &quot;The Communist&quot;. Postgate soon became its editor and was briefly a major propagandist for the communist cause but he left the party after falling out with its leadership in 1922, when the Communist International insisted that British communists follow the Moscow line. As such, he was one of Britain&#x27;s first left-wing former communists, and the party came to treat him as an archetypal bourgeois intellectual renegade. He remained a key player in left journalism, however, returning to the &quot;Herald&quot;, then joining Lansbury on &quot;Lansbury&#x27;s Labour Weekly&quot; in 1925–1927.

===Later career===
In the late 1920s and early 1930s he published biographies of John Wilkes and Robert Emmet and his first novel, &quot;No Epitaph&quot; (1932), and worked as an editor for the &quot;Encyclopædia Britannica&quot;. In 1932 he visited the Soviet Union with a Fabian delegation and contributed to the collection &quot;Twelve Studies in Soviet Russia&quot;. Later in the 1930s he co-authored with his brother-in-law G. D. H. Cole &quot;The Common People&quot;, a social history of Britain from the mid-18th century. Postgate edited the left-wing monthly &quot;Fact&quot; from 1937 to 1939, which featured a monograph on a different subject in each issue. &quot;Fact&quot; published material by several well-known left-wing writers, including Ernest Hemingway&#x27;s reports on the Spanish Civil War, C. L. R. James&#x27; &quot;A History of Negro Revolt&quot; and Storm Jameson&#x27;s essay &quot;Documents&quot;. Postgate then edited the socialist weekly &quot;Tribune&quot; from early 1940 until the end of 1941. &quot;Tribune&quot; had previously been a pro-Soviet publication: however, the Soviet fellow travellers at &quot;Tribune&quot; were either dismissed, or, in Postgate&#x27;s words &quot;left soon after in dislike of me&quot;. Under Postgate&#x27;s editorship, &quot;Tribune&quot; would express &quot;critical support&quot; for the Churchill government and condemn the Communist Party.

Postgate&#x27;s anti-fascism led him to move away from his earlier pacifism. Postgate supported the Second World War and joined the Home Guard near his home in Finchley, London. In 1942 he obtained a post as a temporary civil servant in the wartime Board of Trade, concerned with the control of rationed supplies, and he remained in the Service for eight years. He continued his left-wing writings, and his question-and-answer pamphlet &quot;Why you Should Be A Socialist&quot;, widely distributed among the returning military as the war ended, probably contributed significantly to the Labour Party&#x27;s post-war landslide victory.

In the postwar period, Postgate continued to be critical of Russia under Stalin, viewing its direction as an abandonment of socialist ideals.

Always interested in food and wine, after World War II, Postgate wrote a regular column on the poor state of British gastronomy for the pocket magazine &quot;Lilliput&quot;. In these, inspired by the example of a French travel guide called &quot;Le Club des Sans Club&quot;, he invited readers to send him reports on eating places throughout the UK, which he would collate and publish. The response was overwhelming, and Postgate&#x27;s notional &quot;Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Food&quot;, as he had called it, developed into the &quot;Good Food Guide&quot;, becoming independent of &quot;Lilliput&quot; and its successor, &quot;The Leader&quot;. The &quot;Guide&quot;&#x27;s first issue came out in 1951; it accepted no advertisements and still relied on volunteers to visit and report on UK restaurants. As well as democratising ordinary eating out, Postgate sought to demystify the aura surrounding wine, and the flowery language widely used to describe wine flavours. His &quot;A Plain Man&#x27;s Guide To Wine&quot; undoubtedly did much to make Britain more of a wine-drinking nation. In 1965, Postgate wrote an article in &quot;Holiday&quot; magazine in which he warned readers against Babycham, which &quot;looks like champagne and is served in champagne glasses [but] is made of pears&quot;. The company sued for libel, but Postgate was acquitted, and awarded costs. Postgate&#x27;s distinctly amateur writings on both food and wine, though highly influential in Britain in their time, did not endear him to professionals in the catering and wine trades, who avoided referring to him; however his activities were much appreciated in France, where in 1951 he had been made the first British &quot;Peer of the Jurade of St Emilion&quot;.

He continued to work as a journalist, mainly on the Co-operative movement&#x27;s Sunday paper &quot;Reynolds&#x27; News&quot;, and during the 1950s and 1960s published several historical works and a biography of his father-in-law, &quot;The Life of George Lansbury&quot;.

Postgate wrote several mystery novels that drew on his socialist beliefs to set crime, detection and punishment in a broader social and economic context. His most famous novel is &quot;Verdict of Twelve&quot; (1940), his other novels include &quot;Somebody at the Door&quot; (1943) and &quot;The Ledger Is Kept&quot; (1953). (His sister and brother-in-law, the Coles, also became a successful mystery-writing duo.) After the death of H. G. Wells, Postgate edited some revisions of the two-volume &quot;Outline of History&quot; that Wells had first published in 1920.

===Death and legacy===

Raymond Postgate died on 29 March 1971; his wife Daisy committed suicide a month later.

Postgate&#x27;s younger son, Oliver Postgate, also a conscientious objector though in World War II, became a leading creator of children&#x27;s television programmes in the UK including &quot;Bagpuss&quot;, &quot;Ivor the Engine&quot; and &quot;The Clangers&quot;. Oliver&#x27;s brother was the microbiologist and writer John Postgate FRS.

<text>The Harbin Y-12 () is a high wing twin-engine turboprop utility aircraft built by Harbin Aircraft Industry Group (HAIG). It is the first Chinese-designed and produced aircraft to receive type certificate from the FAA in March 1995.
==Design and development==
The Y-12 started as a development of the Harbin Y-11 airframe
called Y-11T in 1980. The design featured numerous improvements including a redesigned wing with a new low drag section, a larger fuselage and bonded rather than riveted construction. It also replaced the radial piston engines with turboprops.

The prototype first flew in 1982, followed by about 30 production Y-12 (I) aircraft before a revised version was produced. This was designated the Y-12 (II), which featured more powerful engines and removal of leading edge slats, first flying on 16 August 1984 and receiving Chinese certification in December of the following year.

China and the US signed a bilateral airworthiness agreement to allow the FAA and General Administration of Civil Aviation of China overseeing the manufacture of US aircraft in China in 1991. Harbin Aircraft Manufacturing Corporation (HAMC) and the Civil Aviation Administration of China (CAAC) applied for Part 23 certification of the Y-12 in September 1992. Modifications are made to the Y-12 (II) to meet US requirements, including a larger, reshaped, wing with wing-lets and landing gear reinforced with stronger struts. The power plants are two locally made Pratt &amp; Whitney Canada PT6A-27 turboprops with Hartzell propellers. The Y-12 has a maximum takeoff weight of 5,700 kg (12,600 lb) with seating for 17 passengers and two crew. The aircraft is operated as a light commuter and transport aircraft. The Y-12 (IV) received its type certificate from the FAA in March 1995, a first for an aircraft designed and produced in China. According to an FAA official: the Y-12 programme was a vehicle to demonstrate the CAAC&#x27;s compatibility with FAR Part 23 and most Chinese CCAR-23 certification procedures for small-category aircraft are recognised by the FAA. In early 1995, it is reported overseas sales totaled 61 aircraft to 13 countries including Fiji, Malaysia, Nepal and Peru.

In 1999, HAMC was reorganised into Hafei Aviation Industry (HAI).

The latest development is the Y-12F, which is almost a new design with many improvements: new wings, landing gear, fuselage, more powerful engines, and extended payload and range. The Y-12F made its maiden flight on December 29, 2010, received CAAC type certification on December 10, 2015, FAA type certification on February 22, 2016, and EASA type certification on July 13, 2023. In 2015, Kenmore Air announced that they would begin development of floats for the Y-12 for FAA certification. The Y-12 completed the FAA evaluation flight tests for its automatic flight control system on June 30, 2018, with its performance meeting the requirements, said AVIC Harbin Aircraft Industry Company Ltd (AVIC HAFEI).

==Variants==


* Y-12 (I): Twin-engined STOL utility transport aircraft, powered by two 500-shp (373-kW) Pratt &amp; Whitney Canada PT6A-11 turboprop engines. Seating for 17 passengers and a MTOW of 5,000 kg.
* Y-12 (II): Fitted with more powerful 600-hp PT6A-27 engines, received type certificate from UK CAA in 1990, with aircraft operate in Malaysia and Fiji.
* Y-12 (III): Planned version to be fitted with WJ-9 turboprop. Evolved to Y-12C because of IV&#x27;s success when WJ-9 development was completed.
* Y-12 (IV): Improved version. Revised wingtips (span increased to 19.2 m (63 ft)) and increased max. takeoff weight to 5,700 kg. 18-19 passengers. This version is the first aircraft in the series certified by the FAA in 1995.
* Y-12C: Basically a (IV) version with WJ-9 turboprop, used by PLAAF for aerial survey.
* Y-12D: Domestically deployed military version with upgraded engines driving four-bladed propellers, used by PLA Airborne Corps for parachute training.
* Y-12E: Variant with 18 passenger seats. PT6A-135A engines of equal horsepower but increased torque driving four-bladed propellers. This version was certified by the FAA in 2006.
* Y-12F: The latest development with almost everything redesigned: wider fuselage, new wings, retractable landing gear and more powerful PT6A-65B engines. The Y-12F has higher cruise speed, longer range and can accommodate 19 passengers or 3x LD3 containers. Design started in April 2005 and the maiden flight was on 29 December 2010. CAAC type certification was received on 10 December 2015 and FAA certification on 22 February 2016. The Y-12F passed flight tests for its automatic flight control system by the FAA on 30 June 2018. It was demonstrated during the 2012 Zhuhai Airshow.
* Y-12G: Proposed cargo version of Y-12F.
* Turbo Panda: Export name for (II) version, marketed by England and Japanese companies. No real order due to airworthiness certification.
* Twin Panda: Originally (II) version for export. Later a modified Y-12 (IV) powered by two Pratt &amp; Whitney Canada PT6A-34 turboprop engines and fitted with uprated undercarriage, upgraded avionics and interior. Thirty-five orders reportedly received by 2000 but production not proceeded with.

<text>The McMaster Students Union (MSU), is the central undergraduate student government at McMaster University, in Hamilton, Ontario, Canada.

==History==
The McMaster Student Body, the original student government, was formed in 1890 when McMaster University&#x27;s official first registrants began their studies. In 1911, McMaster women, protesting gender inequality and not being allowed to vote in the general student body elections, elected a female representative student body and formed the Women&#x27;s Student Body. In 1925, the number of day students began outnumbering the number of residence students. To ensure that both day and resident students were properly represented, the student government split in two bodies, the Student Body and the Residence Council. In 1946 the McMaster Student Body was renamed McMaster Students Union. In 1971 the MSU was incorporated as a non-profit organization without share capital under the &quot;Ontario Corporations Act&quot;.

The MSU&#x27;s offices have been located in four buildings over time. First in the Alumni Memorial Building (opened in 1951 as the campus&#x27; first student centre), then Wentworth House (1961–74), Hamilton Hall (a former science building renovated to serve as a student centre, 1974–2002), and the McMaster University Student Centre (MUSC, 2002–present). referendums in 1987 and 1989 approved a long-term levy that funded approximately two-thirds of the $36 million capital costs of the MUSC. Ground for the new building was broken in March 2000 and the official opening took place in September 2002. A student fee retired the remaining term loan in 2010–11.

==Scope==
The MSU works to enhance both the academic and extracurricular experience of its members by offering a wide array of resources, services and opportunities to McMaster students and through advocacy of student issues with the university administration and relevant levels of government.

The MSU represents approximately 27,000 students, each of whom becomes a member of the students union when registering in a minimum of 18 units of undergraduate courses (3 two-term courses, or equivalent) in an academic session. The university collects mandatory membership fees on the MSU’s behalf as a component of tuition/ancillary fees paid by students on registration. Fees, which are partially courseload-sensitive, are up to a maximum of $587.84 for the MSU, plus up to a further $760.71 in other university or student group supplementary fees which are approved by MSU referendums or General Assembly [2019-20 fee schedule].

==Governance==
The MSU&#x27;s Constitution and Bylaws establish the political apparatus of the union and its component organs, while a separate collection of Operating Policies define the functions of service-providing departments and the operating parameters of the organization.

The political leadership of the MSU is four officers—a President and three Vice-Presidents (Administration, Education and Finance). These positions are filled by students, typically after completing three or four years of study, who take a year off classes to work full-time in student government. The president is elected directly by the student body in annual elections traditionally held in early February, while the vice-presidents are elected by the Student Representative Assembly in early April. Slates and/or political parties, though commonplace at many other student unions, are not a typical feature of the MSU&#x27;s political culture.

The MSU&#x27;s chief legislative body is the Student Representative Assembly (SRA), a 35-member parliament comprising the president, vice-presidents, and 31 elected student representatives from nine (9) academic divisions of the University (Arts &amp; Science, Business, Engineering, Health Sciences, Kinesiology (separated from the Faculty of Science), Humanities, Nursing, Science, and Social Sciences). The SRA is the MSU&#x27;s highest policy-setting body and has the sole authority to approve and modify legislation and elect officers other than the President.

The executive branch of government is the Executive Board (EB), which comprises the President, Vice-Presidents, and five SRA members-at-large; as well as the General Manager, Marketing &amp; Communications Director, Administrative Services Coordinator, and the Associate: Vice-President Services. The board, chaired by the President, supervises the functioning of the union&#x27;s services and bureaucracy and performs planning and priority-setting tasks in a manner somewhat akin to a Westminster-style cabinet. With the exception of the President, the EB&#x27;s membership is elected by and responsible to the SRA. In emergency circumstances and during the summer months it can operate as an executive committee of the SRA and exercise the powers of the full Assembly. Functional authority for full-time staff and the departments they supervise lies with the Corporate Board of Directors (see below) rather than the EB.

== Elections ==
MSU holds elections every year for the presidency and for the SRA positions. Elections are conducted using online voting. Voter turnout in presidential elections was above 40% from 2014 through 2017, but was 10.5% in 2023 and 16.4% in 2024.

==Corporate structure==
The MSU was incorporated in 1971 as a corporation without share capital. For corporate purposes, including major financial decision-making and dealings with full-time staff members, the political organs of the union can reconvene in a corporate rather than political format—the Student Representative Assembly serves as the voting members of the corporation, with the four sabbatical officers assuming the role of a corporate Board of Directors. The Board oversees day-to-day operations and an annual operating budget of over $13 million.

==Affiliated organizations==
The MSU is a member of the Ontario Undergraduate Student Alliance (since 1998), and is a former member (and current observer) of the Canadian Alliance of Student Associations (2001–04 and 2009–14). From 1981 to 1998, MSU members were also members of the Canadian Federation of Students.
The MSU is also a current and founding member of the Undergraduates of Canadian Research Intensive Universities.

==Services==
The MSU employs 36 permanent staff and over 200 part-time student staff. Its more than 30 operational departments include a restaurant-bar (TwelvEighty), a professional production company (AVTEK Productions), Emergency First Response Team, First Year Council (FYC), Child Care Centre, convenience store (Union Market), print shop (Underground Media + Design), food bank (Food Collective Centre), newspaper (The Silhouette), radio station (93.3 CFMU-FM), Student Health Education Centre, and a first-year transition program (MSU Spark).

== Maroons Investigation 2019 ==
The Maroons are a student group created to help facilitate Welcome Week events and increase awareness surrounding MSU services and events. In March 2019, The Silhouette, the student-run newspaper, published an article displaying the numerous cases of sexual assault against the Maroons team. Such incidents go back to an annual ski trip. After weeks of outcry, the MSU President released a statement condemning the incidents and promised an external review will occur. In November 2019, the student association released the results of the review with all recommendations being adopted by the organization.

==Alumni==
In 1986, former MSU activists established the McMaster Students Union Alumni Association – the first student leader alumni association of its kind in Canada – as a branch of the McMaster University Alumni Association.

<doc id="838319" wikidata="Q6946186" url="?curid=838319" title="Don't Dilly Dally on the Way">
<text>&quot;Don&#x27;t Dilly Dally on the Way&quot;, subtitled &quot;The Cock Linnet Song&quot; and often credited as &quot;My Old Man (Said Follow the Van)&quot;, is a music hall song written in 1919 by Fred W. Leigh and Charles Collins, made popular by Marie Lloyd.

The song, although humorous, also reflects some of the hardships of working class life in London at the beginning of the 20th century. It joined a music hall tradition of dealing with life in a determinedly upbeat fashion. In the song a couple are obliged to move house, after dark, because they cannot pay their rent. At the time the song was written, most London houses were rented, so moving in a hurry – a moonlight flit – was common when the husband lost his job or there was insufficient money to pay the rent.

The couple rush to fill up the van, and its tailboard, with their possessions, in case the landlord appears. When the van is packed up, however, there is no room left for the wife. The husband therefore instructs her to follow the van, which she does, carrying the pet bird. Unfortunately, en route, the wife loses her way after stopping at a pub for a drink. Thereafter, she reflects that it would be ill-advised to approach one of the volunteer policemen (a &quot;special&quot;), as they are less trustworthy than a regular police constable (a &quot;copper&quot;) and might take advantage of her inebriation. Alternatively (according to the physical gestures accompanying the song) they may simply be less qualified to give dependable street directions.

==Chorus==
The chorus of the song is well known.
: My old man said &quot;Foller the van,
: And don&#x27;t dilly dally on the way&quot;.
: Off went the van wiv me &#x27;ome packed in it,
: I walked behind wiv me old cock linnet.
: But I dillied and dallied, dallied and I dillied
: Lost me way and don&#x27;t know where to roam.
: Well you can&#x27;t trust a special like the old time coppers.
: When you can&#x27;t find your way &#x27;ome.

There are a number of alternatives to the last two lines: 
: Who&#x27;ll put you up when you&#x27;ve lost your bedstead,
: And you can&#x27;t find your way &#x27;ome?&quot;

: I stopped on the way to have me old half quarten,
: now I can&#x27;t find my way home.

: Well you can&#x27;t trust a man when your life&#x27;s in a van
: an&#x27; you can&#x27;t find your way &#x27;ome.

: I had to stop to have a drop of tiddly in the pub
: Now I can&#x27;t find my way home.

: Stopped off to have one at the old Red Tavern
: And I can&#x27;t find my way home.

==Performances==
Various lineups of the Clancy Brothers (with Tommy Makem, Louis Killen, and Robbie O&#x27;Connell at different times) have performed the refrain as part of a medley, immediately following &quot;They&#x27;re Moving Father&#x27;s Grave to Build a Sewer&quot;, which also deals with the travails of working class Londoners. These two songs appeared together on the group&#x27;s 1965 album, &quot;Recorded Live in Ireland&quot;. Danny La Rue also often sang it in performances.

==Football chant==
The song forms the basis of a football chant in the UK at clubs such as Aston Villa, Manchester United and Linfield FC In the chant, the narrator&#x27;s old man suggests being a fan of a rival club. The narrator responds aggressively and reveals a negative opinion of all fans of that club, using obscene language.

==In popular culture==
*The song is sung by the character Blanche Simmons at the internee’s Christmas concert in the TV series Tenko, shortly before they are marched out of the camp by Japanese soldiers at the end of the first series.
*In &quot;The Catherine Tate Show&quot;, during the &quot;Life at Ma&#x27;s&quot; sketch (a spoof of &quot;Life on Mars&quot;), the last four lines are sung by Catherine Tate and a variety of other characters.
*The song also appeared in the &quot;Only Fools And Horses&quot; episode &quot;Home Sick&quot;, being sung by Del Boy and Grandad.
*The first verse and the chorus were featured in Episode 211 of &quot;The Muppet Show&quot;, performed by Miss Piggy. In the Muppet fan community the song is better known as &quot;Don&#x27;t Dilly Dally On the Way&quot;.
*It is sung in the 1943 black and white romantic comedy film &quot;The Gentle Sex&quot;.
*It is sung in the 1958 war film &quot;Ice Cold in Alex&quot;.
*It is sung in the 1958 movie &quot;Innocent Sinners&quot; by the main character &#x27;Lovejoy&#x27;.
*In 1970, Cardinal Fang (Terry Gilliam) briefly began to recite the tune under his breath after citing charges of heresy against the Holy Church, but was subsequently cut off by Cardinal Ximénez (Michael Palin) before completing the first line. This was part of the famous Spanish Inquisition Sketch from the Monty Python comedy troupe. Palin, Jones, and Gilliam would burst into the room whenever someone uttered a form of the trigger phrase, &quot;I didn&#x27;t expect a Spanish Inquisition.&quot;
*It is sung in the opening of the 1974 TV play &quot;Regan&quot;, written by Ian Kennedy Martin and starring John Thaw as the titular character, which served as the pilot episode of &quot;The Sweeney&quot;.
*It opens Steven Berkoff&#x27;s 1975 play &quot;East&quot;.
*In the &quot;1985 EastEnders Sing-Along&quot;, it is sung by the cast with Gillian Taylforth singing the intro.
*The first verse and chorus is sung in Upstairs, Downstairs by the servants as part of their New Year&#x27;s celebrations in Series 4, Episode 9, &quot;Another Year.&quot; The group seems to mix up the line about the &quot;special&quot; and the old-time copper, but it may be because the butler, Mr. Hudson, serves as a &quot;special.&quot; (See Series 4, Episode 3, &quot;The Beastly Hun.&quot;)
*In an episode of &quot;The Archers&quot; broadcast on Monday 28 September 2015, the chorus is sung by Ruth Archer and her mother immediately before the latter&#x27;s collapse from a &quot;stroke&quot; and subsequent death. An alternative third line is used - &quot;Off went the van with me old man in it&quot;.
*In a commercial for American Express, Jerry Seinfeld is shown singing the song with others in an English pub, part of a montage showing the comedian&#x27;s adjusting to British culture.
*It is sung by Mr. Bean in the 22nd episode of season 4 in animated series.
*Tessie O&#x27;Shea, Kay Kendall and the Pearly Kings and Queens, sang an excerpt of the song in the film &quot;London Town.&quot;
*In the comedy film Confessions from a Holiday Camp, the Lea family sing the song enroute to the holiday camp, drunkenly unaware that they&#x27;ve stumbled into a funeral car instead of a taxi.
